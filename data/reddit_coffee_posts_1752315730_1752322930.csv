  'Brace yourself,' said Miles Mollison, standing in the kitchen of one of the big houses in Church Row.  
  
  He had waited until half-past six in the morning to make the call. It had been a bad night, full of long stretches of wakefulness punctuated by snatches of restless sleep. At four in the morning, he had realized that his wife was awake too, and they had talked quietly for a while in the darkness. Even as they discussed what they had been forced to witness, each trying to drive out vague feelings of fright and shock, feathery little ripples of excitement had tickled Miles' insides at the thought of delivering the news to his father. He had intended to wait until seven, but fear that somebody else might beat him to it had propelled him to the telephone early.  
  
  'What's happened?' boomed Howard's voice, with a slightly tinny edge; Miles had put him on speakerphone for Samantha's benefit. Mahogany brown in her pale pink dressing gown, she had taken advantage of their early waking to apply another handful of Self-Sun to her fading natural tan. The kitchen was full of the mingled smells of instant coffee and synthetic coconut.  
  
  'Fairbrother's dead. Collapsed at the golf club last night. Sam and I were having dinner at the Birdie. '  
  
  'Fairbrother's dead?' roared Howard.  
  
  The inflection implied that he had been expecting some dramatic change in the status of Barry Fairbrother, but that even he had not anticipated actual death.  
  
  'Collapsed in the car park,' repeated Miles.  
  
  'Good God,' said Howard. 'He wasn't much past forty, was he? Good God. '  
  
  Miles and Samantha listened to Howard breathing like a blown horse. He was always short of breath in the mornings.  
  
  'What was it? Heart?'  
  
  'Something in his brain, they think. We went with Mary to the hospital and - '  
  
  But Howard was not paying attention. Miles and Samantha heard him speaking away from his mouthpiece.  
  
  'Barry Fairbrother! Dead! It's Miles!'  
  
  'Sam and I went in the ambulance,' Miles enunciated clearly. 'With Mary and the body. '  
  
  Samantha noticed how Miles' second version emphasized what you might call the more commercial aspect of the story. Samantha did not blame him. Their reward for enduring the awful experience was the right to tell people about it. She did not think she would ever forget it: Mary wailing; Barry's eyes still half open above the muzzle-like mask; she and Miles trying to read the paramedic's expression; the cramped jolting; the dark windows; the terror.  
  
  'Good God,' said Howard for the third time, ignoring Shirley's soft background questioning, his attention all Miles'. 'He just dropped down dead in the car park?'  
  
  'Yep,' said Miles. 'Moment I saw him it was pretty obvious there was nothing to be done. '  
  
  It was his first lie, and he turned his eyes away from his wife as he told it. She remembered his big protective arm around Mary's shaking shoulders: He'll be OK . . . he'll be OK . . .  
  
  But after all, thought Samantha, giving Miles his due, how were you supposed to know one way or the other, when they were strapping on masks and shoving in needles? It had seemed as though they were trying to save Barry, and none of them had known for certain that it was no good until the young doctor had walked towards Mary at the hospital. Samantha could still see, with awful clarity, Mary's naked, petrified face, and the expression of the bespectacled, sleek-haired young woman in the white coat: composed, yet a little wary . . . they showed that sort of thing on television dramas all the time, but when it actually happened . . .  
  
  'Not at all,' Miles was saying. 'Gavin was only playing squash with him on Thursday. '  
  
  'And he seemed all right then?'  
  
  'Oh yeah. Thrashed Gavin. '  
  
  'Good God. Just goes to show you, doesn't it? Just goes to show. Hang on, Mum wants a word. '  
  
  A clunk and a clatter, and Shirley's soft voice came on the line.  
  
  'What a dreadful shock, Miles,' she said. 'Are you all right?'  
  
  Samantha took a clumsy mouthful of coffee; it trickled from the corners of her mouth down the sides of her chin, and she mopped her face and chest with her sleeve. Miles had adopted the voice he often used when speaking to his mother: deeper than usual, a take-command nothing-fazes-me voice, punchy and no-nonsense. Sometimes, especially when drunk, Samantha would imitate Miles and Shirley's conversations. 'Not to worry, Mummy. Miles here. Your little soldier. ' 'Darling, you are wonderful: so big and brave and clever. ' Once or twice, lately, Samantha had done this in front of other people, leaving Miles cross and defensive, though pretending to laugh. There had been a row, last time, in the car going home.  
  
  'You went all the way to the hospital with her?' Shirley was saying from the speakerphone.  
  
  No, thought Samantha, we got bored halfway there and asked to be let out.  
  
  'Least we could do. Wish we could have done more. '  
  
  Samantha got up and walked over to the toaster.  
  
  'I'm sure Mary was very grateful,' said Shirley. Samantha crashed the lid of the bread bin and rammed four pieces of bread into the slots. Miles' voice became more natural.  
  
  'Yeah, well, once the doctors had told - confirmed that he was dead, Mary wanted Colin and Tessa Wall. Sam phoned them, we waited until they arrived and then we left. '  
  
  'Well, it was very lucky for Mary that you were there,' said Shirley. 'Dad wants another word, Miles, I'll put him on. Speak later. '  
  
  '""Speak later,""' Samantha mouthed at the kettle, waggling her head. Her distorted reflection was puffy after their sleepless night, her chestnut-brown eyes bloodshot. In her haste to witness the telling of Howard, Samantha had carelessly rubbed fake tanning lotion into the rims.  
  
  'Why don't you and Sam come over this evening?' Howard was booming. 'No, hang on - Mum's reminded me we're playing bridge with the Bulgens. Come over tomorrow. For dinner. 'Bout seven. '  
  
  'Maybe,' said Miles, glancing at Samantha. 'I'll have to see what Sam's got on. '  
  
  She did not indicate whether or not she wanted to go. A strange sense of anti-climax filled the kitchen as Miles hung up.  
  
  'They can't believe it,' he said, as if she hadn't heard everything.  
  
  They ate their toast and drank fresh mugs of coffee in silence. Some of Samantha's irritability lifted as she chewed. She remembered how she had woken with a jerk in their dark bedroom in the early hours, and had been absurdly relieved and grateful to feel Miles beside her, big and paunchy, smelling of vetiver and old sweat. Then she imagined telling customers at the shop about how a man had dropped dead in front of her, and about the mercy dash to hospital. She thought of ways to describe various aspects of the journey, and of the climactic scene with the doctor. The youth of that self-possessed woman had made the whole thing seem worse. They ought to give the job of breaking the news to someone older. Then, with a further lift of her spirits, she recollected that she had an appointment with the Champ??tre sales rep tomorrow; he had been pleasantly flirty on the telephone.  
  
  'I'd better get moving,' said Miles, and he drained his coffee mug, his eyes on the brightening sky beyond the window. He heaved a deep sigh and patted his wife on her shoulder as he passed on the way to the dishwasher with his empty plate and mug.  
  
  'Christ, it puts everything in perspective, though, doesn't it, eh?'  
  
  Shaking his close-cropped, greying head, he left the kitchen.  
  
  Samantha sometimes found Miles absurd and, increasingly, dull. Every now and then, though, she enjoyed his pomposity in precisely the same spirit as she liked, on formal occasions, to wear a hat. It was appropriate, after all, to be solemn and a little worthy this morning. She finished her toast and cleared away her breakfast things, mentally refining the story she planned to tell her assistant.  
  
  II  
  
  'Barry Fairbrother's dead,' panted Ruth Price.  
  
  She had almost run up the chilly garden path so as to have a few more minutes with her husband before he left for work. She didn't stop in the porch to take off her coat but, st  
ill muffled and gloved, burst into the kitchen where Simon and their teenage sons were eating breakfast.  
  
  Her husband froze, a piece of toast halfway to his lips, then lowered it with theatrical slowness. The two boys, both in school uniform, looked from one parent to the other, mildly interested.  
  
  'An aneurysm, they think,' said Ruth, still a little breathless as she tweaked off her gloves finger by finger, unwinding her scarf and unbuttoning her coat. A thin dark woman with heavy, mournful eyes, the stark blue nurse's uniform suited her. 'He collapsed at the golf club - Sam and Miles Mollison brought him in - and then Colin and Tessa Wall came . . . '  
  
  She darted out to the porch to hang up her things, and was back in time to answer Simon's shouted question.  
  
  'What's ananeurysm?'  
  
  'An. Aneurysm. A burst artery in the brain. '  
  
  She flitted over to the kettle, switched it on, then began to sweep crumbs from the work surface around the toaster, talking all the while.  
  
  'He'll have had a massive cerebral haemorrhage. His poor, poor wife . . . she's absolutely devastated . . . '  
  
  Momentarily stricken, Ruth gazed out of her kitchen window over the crisp whiteness of her frost-crusted lawn, at the abbey across the valley, stark and skeletal against the pale pink and grey sky, and the panoramic view that was the glory of Hilltop House. Pagford, which by night was no more than a cluster of twinkling lights in a dark hollow far below, was emerging into chilly sunlight. Ruth saw none of it: her mind was still at the hospital, watching Mary emerge from the room where Barry lay, all futile aids to life removed. Ruth Price's pity flowed most freely and sincerely for those whom she believed to be like herself. 'No, no, no, no,' Mary had moaned, and that instinctive denial had reverberated inside Ruth, because she had been afforded a glimpse of herself in an identical situation . . .  
  
  Hardly able to bear the thought, she turned to look at Simon. His light-brown hair was still thick, his frame was almost as wiry as it had been in his twenties and the crinkles at the corners of his eyes were merely attractive, but Ruth's return to nursing after a long break had confronted her anew with the million and one ways the human body could malfunction. She had had more detachment when she was young; now she realized how lucky they all were to be alive.  
  
  'Couldn't they do anything for him?' asked Simon. 'Couldn't they plug it up?'  
  
  He sounded frustrated, as though the medical profession had, yet again, bungled the business by refusing to do the simple and obvious thing.  
  
  Andrew thrilled with savage pleasure. He had noticed lately that his father had developed a habit of countering his mother's use of medical terms with crude, ignorant suggestions. Cerebral haemorrhage. Plug it up. His mother didn't realize what his father was up to. She never did. Andrew ate his Weetabix and burned with hatred.  
  
  'It was too late to do anything by the time they got him out to us,' said Ruth, dropping teabags into the pot. 'He died in the ambulance, right before they arrived. '  
  
  'Bloody hell,' said Simon. 'What was he, forty?'  
  
  But Ruth was distracted.  
  
  'Paul, your hair's completely matted at the back. Have you brushed it at all?'  
  
  She pulled a hairbrush from her handbag and pushed it into her younger son's hand.  
  
  'No warning signs or anything?' asked Simon, as Paul dragged the brush through the thick mop of his hair.  
  
  'He'd had a bad headache for a couple of days, apparently. '  
  
  'Ah,' said Simon, chewing toast. 'And he ignored it?'  
  
  'Oh, yes, he didn't think anything of it. '  
  
  Simon swallowed.  
  
  'Goes to show, doesn't it?' he said portentously. 'Got to watch yourself. '  
  
  That's wise, thought Andrew, with furious contempt; that's profound. So it was Barry Fairbrother's own fault his brain had burst open. You self-satisfied fucker, Andrew told his father, loudly, inside his own head.  
  
  Simon pointed his knife at his elder son and said, 'Oh, and by the way. He's going to be getting a job. Old Pizza Face there. '  
  
  Startled, Ruth turned from her husband to her son. Andrew's acne stood out, livid and shiny, from his empurpling cheek, as he stared down into his bowl of beige mush.  
  
  'Yeah,' said Simon. 'Lazy little shit's going to start earning some money. If he wants to smoke, he can pay for it out of his own wages. No more pocket money. '  
  
  'Andrew!' wailed Ruth. 'You haven't been - ?'  
  
  'Oh, yes, he has. I caught him in the woodshed,' said Simon, his expression a distillation of spite.  
  
  'Andrew!'  
  
  'No more money from us. You want fags, you buy 'em,' said Simon.  
  
  'But we said,' whimpered Ruth, 'we said, with his exams coming - '  
  
  'Judging by the way he fucked up his mocks, we'll be lucky if he gets any qualifications. He can get himself out to McDonald's early, get some experience,' said Simon, standing up and pushing in his chair, relishing the sight of Andrew's hanging head, the dark pimpled edge of his face. 'Because we're not supporting you through any resits, pal. It's now or never. '  
  
  'Oh, Simon,' said Ruth reproachfully.  
  
  'What?'  
  
  Simon took two stamping steps towards his wife. Ruth shrank back against the sink. The pink plastic brush fell out of Paul's hand.  
  
  'I'm not going to fund the little fucker's filthy habit! Fucking cheek of him, puffing away in my fucking shed!'  
  
  Simon hit himself on the chest on the word 'my'; the dull thunk made Ruth wince.  
  
  'I was bringing home a salary when I was that spotty little shit's age. If he wants fags, he can pay for them himself, all right? All right?'  
  
  He had thrust his face to within six inches of Ruth's.  
  
  'Yes, Simon,' she said very quietly.  
  
  Andrew's bowels seemed to have become liquid. He had made a vow to himself not ten days previously: had the moment arrived so soon? But his father stepped away from his mother and marched out of the kitchen towards the porch. Ruth, Andrew and Paul remained quite still; they might have promised not to move in his absence.  
  
  'Did you fill up the tank?' Simon shouted, as he always did when she had been working a night shift.  
  
  'Yes,' Ruth called back, striving for brightness, for normality.  
  
  The front door rattled and slammed.  
  
  Ruth busied herself with the teapot, waiting for the billowing atmosphere to shrink back to its usual proportions. Only when Andrew was about to leave the room to clean his teeth did she speak.  
  
  'He worries about you, Andrew. About your health. '  
  
  Like fuck he does, the cunt.  
  
  Inside his head, Andrew matched Simon obscenity for obscenity. Inside his head, he could take Simon in a fair fight.  
  
  Aloud, to his mother, he said, 'Yeah. Right. '  
  
  III  
  
  Evertree Crescent was a sickle moon of 1930s bungalows, which lay two minutes from Pagford's main square. In number thirty-six, a house tenanted longer than any other in the street, Shirley Mollison sat, propped up against her pillows, sipping the tea that her husband had brought her. The reflection facing her in the mirrored doors of the built-in wardrobe had a misty quality, due partly to the fact that she was not wearing glasses, and partly to the soft glow cast over the room by her rose-patterned curtains. In this flattering, hazy light, the dimpled pink and white face beneath the short silver hair was cherubic.  
  
  The bedroom was just large enough to accommodate Shirley's single bed and Howard's double, crammed together, non-identical twins. Howard's mattress, which still bore his prodigious imprint, was empty. The soft purr and hiss of the shower was audible from where Shirley and her rosy reflection sat facing each other, savouring the news that seemed still to effervesce in the atmosphere, like bubbling champagne.  
  
  Barry Fairbrother was dead. Snuffed out. Cut down. No event of national importance, no war, no stock-market collapse, no terrorist attack, could have sparked in Shirley the awe, the avid interest and feverish speculation that currently consumed her.  
  
  She had hated  
Barry Fairbrother. Shirley and her husband, usually as one in all their friendships and enmities, had been a little out of step in this. Howard had sometimes confessed himself entertained by the bearded little man who opposed him so relentlessly across the long scratched tables in Pagford Church Hall; but Shirley made no distinction between the political and the personal. Barry had opposed Howard in the central quest of his life, and this made Barry Fairbrother her bitter enemy.  
  
  Loyalty to her husband was the main, but not the only, reason for Shirley's passionate dislike. Her instincts about people were finely honed in one direction only, like a dog that has been trained to sniff out narcotics. She was perennially aquiver to detect condescension, and had long detected its reek in the attitudes of Barry Fairbrother and his cronies on the Parish Council. The Fairbrothers of the world assumed that their university education made them better than people like her and Howard, that their views counted for more. Well, their arrogance had received a nasty blow today. Fairbrother's sudden death bolstered Shirley in the long-held belief that, whatever he and his followers might have thought, he had been of a lower and weaker order than her husband, who, in addition to all his other virtues, had managed to survive a heart attack seven years previously.  
  
  (Never for an instant had Shirley believed that her Howard would die, even while he was in the operating theatre. Howard's presence on earth was, to Shirley, a given, like sunlight and oxygen. She had said as much afterwards, when friends and neighbours had spoken of miraculous escapes and how lucky that they had the cardiac unit so nearby in Yarvil, and how dreadfully worried she must have been.  
  
  'I always knew he'd pull through,' Shirley had said, unruffled and serene. 'I never doubted it. '  
  
  And here he was, as good as ever; and there was Fairbrother in the morgue. It only went to show. )  
  
  In the elation of this early morning, Shirley was reminded of the day after her son Miles had been born. She had sat up in bed all those years ago, exactly like this, with sunlight streaming through the ward window, a cup of tea that somebody else had made her in her hands, waiting for them to bring in her beautiful new baby boy for feeding. Birth and death: there was the same consciousness of heightened existence and of her own elevated importance. The news of Barry Fairbrother's sudden demise lay in her lap like a fat new baby to be gloated over by all her acquaintances; and she would be the fount, the source, for she was first, or nearly so, to receive the news.  
  
  None of the delight frothing and fizzing inside Shirley had been apparent while Howard had been in the room. They had merely exchanged the comments proper to sudden death before he had taken himself off to the shower. Naturally Shirley had known, as they slid stock words and phrases back and forth between them like beads on an abacus, that Howard must be as brimful of ecstasy as she was; but to express these feelings out loud, when the news of the death was still fresh in the air, would have been tantamount to dancing naked and shrieking obscenities, and Howard and Shirley were clothed, always, in an invisible layer of decorum that they never laid aside.  
  
  Another happy thought came to Shirley. She set down her cup and saucer on the bedside table, slipped out of bed, pulled on her candlewick dressing gown and her glasses, and padded down the hall to tap on the bathroom door.  
  
  'Howard?'  
  
  An interrogative noise answered over the steady patter of the shower.  
  
  'Do you think I should put something on the website? About Fairbrother?'  
  
  'Good idea,' he called through the door, after a moment's consideration. 'Excellent idea. '  
  
  So she bustled along to the study. It had previously been the smallest bedroom in the bungalow, long since vacated by their daughter Patricia who had gone to London and was rarely mentioned.  
  
  Shirley was immensely proud of her skill on the internet. She had been to evening classes in Yarvil ten years previously, where she had been one of the oldest students and the slowest. Nevertheless, she had persevered, determined to be the administrator of Pagford Parish Council's exciting new website. She logged herself in and brought up the Parish Council's homepage.  
  
  The brief statement flowed so easily that it was as if her fingers themselves were composing it.  
  
  Councillor Barry Fairbrother  
  
  It is with great regret that we announce the death of Councillor Barry Fairbrother. Our thoughts are with his family at this difficult time.  
  
  She read this through carefully, hit return and watched the message appear on the message board.  
  
  The Queen had lowered the flag on Buckingham Palace when Princess Diana had died. Her Majesty occupied a very special position in Shirley's interior life. Contemplating the message on the website, she was satisfied and happy that she had done the right thing. Learning from the best . . .  
  
  She navigated away from the Parish Council message board and dropped into her favourite medical website, where she painstakingly entered the words 'brain' and 'death' in the search box.  
  
  The suggestions were endless. Shirley scrolled through the possibilities, her mild eyes rolling up and down, wondering to which of these deadly conditions, some of them unpronounceable, she owed her present happiness. Shirley was a hospital volunteer; she had developed quite a little interest in matters medical since starting work at South West General, and occasionally offered diagnoses to her friends.  
  
  But there was no concentrating on long words and symptoms this morning: her thoughts skittered away to the further dissemination of the news; already she was mentally assembling and reshuffling a list of telephone numbers. She wondered whether Aubrey and Julia knew, and what they would say; and whether Howard would let her tell Maureen or reserve that pleasure for himself.  
  
  It was all immensely exciting.  
  
  IV  
  
  Andrew Price closed the front door of the small white house and followed his younger brother down the steep garden path, crunchy with frost, that led to the icy metal gate in the hedge and the lane beyond. Neither boy spared a glance for the familiar view spread out below them: the tiny town of Pagford cupped in a hollow between three hills, one of which was crested with the remains of the twelfth-century abbey. A thin river snaked around the edge of the hill and through town, straddled by a toy stone bridge. The scene was dull as a flat-painted backdrop to the brothers; Andrew despised the way that, on the rare occasions when the family had guests, his father seemed to take credit for it, as though he had designed and built the whole thing. Andrew had lately decided that he would prefer an outlook of asphalt, broken windows and graffiti; he dreamed of London and of a life that mattered.  
  
  The brothers marched to the end of the lane, ambling to a halt on the corner where they met the wider road. Andrew reached into the hedge, groped around for a while, then drew out a half-full packet of Benson & Hedges and a slightly damp box of matches. After several false starts, the heads of the matches crumbling against the strike, he succeeded in lighting up. Two or three deep drags, and then the grumbling engine of the school bus broke the stillness. Andrew carefully knocked out the glowing head of his cigarette and stowed the rest back in the packet.  
  
  The bus was always two-thirds full by the time it reached the turning for Hilltop House, because it had already skirted outlying farms and houses. The brothers sat apart as usual, each of them taking a double seat and turning to stare out of the window as the bus rumbled and lurched on down into Pagford.  
  
  At the foot of their hill was a house that stood in a wedge-shaped garden. The four Fairbrother children usually waited outside the front gate, but there was nobody there today. The curtains were all closed. Andrew wondered whether you usually sat in the dark when somebody died.  
  
  A few weeks previously, Andrew had got off with Niamh Fairbrother, one of Barry's twin daughters, at a disco in the school drama hall. She had shown a distasteful tendency to shadow his movements for a while afterwards. Andrew's parents were barely acquainted with the Fairbrothers; Simon and Ruth had hardly any friends, but they seemed to have had a tepid liking for Barry, who had  
managed the minuscule branch of the only bank still present in Pagford. Fairbrother's name had cropped up a lot in connection with such things as the Parish Council, town hall theatricals, and the Church Fun Run. These were things in which Andrew had no interest and from which his parents held themselves aloof, excepting the occasional sponsorship form or raffle ticket.  
  
  As the bus turned left and trundled down Church Row, past the spacious Victorian houses ranged in descending tiers, Andrew indulged in a little fantasy in which his father dropped dead, gunned down by an invisible sniper. Andrew visualized himself patting his sobbing mother on the back while he telephoned the undertaker. He had a cigarette in his mouth as he ordered the cheapest coffin.  
  
  The three Jawandas, Jaswant, Sukhvinder and Rajpal, got on the bus at the bottom of Church Row. Andrew had carefully chosen a seat with an empty place in front of it, and he willed Sukhvinder to sit in front of him, not for her own sake (Andrew's best friend Fats referred to her as TNT, short for 'Tits 'N' Tash'), but because She so often chose to sit beside Sukhvinder. And whether because his telepathic promptings were particularly powerful this morning or not, Sukhvinder did indeed choose the seat in front. Jubilant, Andrew stared, unseeing, at the grimy window, and clutched his school bag more closely to him, to conceal the erection brought on by the heavy vibration of the bus.  
  
  Anticipation mounted with every fresh pitch and heave, as the cumbersome vehicle edged its way through the narrow streets, around the tight corner into the village square and towards the corner of Her road.  
  
  Andrew had never experienced this intensity of interest in any girl. She was newly arrived; an odd time to change schools, the spring term of the GCSE year. Her name was Gaia, and that was fitting, because he had never heard it before, and she was something entirely new. She had walked onto the bus one morning like a simple statement of the sublime heights to which nature could reach and sat herself down two seats in front of him, while he sat transfixed by the perfection of her shoulders and the back of her head.  
  
  She would be here any minute, and if she sat beside square and sulky Sukhvinder, as she so often did, she would be close enough to smell the nicotine on him. He liked to see inanimate objects react to her body; liked to see the bus seat give a little as she dropped her weight into it, and that copper-gold mass of hair curve against the steel bar at the top.  
  
  The bus driver slowed, and Andrew turned his face away from the door, pretending to be lost in contemplation; he would look around when she got on, as if he had only just realized that they had stopped; he would make eye contact, possibly nod. He waited to hear the doors open, but the soft throb of the engine was not interrupted by the familiar grind and thump.  
  
  Andrew glanced around and saw nothing but short, shabby little Hope Street: two lines of small terraced houses. The bus driver was leaning over to make sure she was not coming. Andrew wanted to tell him to wait, because only the previous week she had burst from one of those little houses and come running up the pavement (it had been acceptable to watch, because everyone had been watching), and the sight of her running had been enough to occupy his thoughts for hours, but the driver hauled at the big wheel and the bus set off again. Andrew returned to his contemplation of the dirty window with an ache in his heart and in his balls.  
  
  V  
  
  The small terraces in Hope Street had once been labourers' houses. Gavin Hughes was shaving slowly and with unnecessary care in the bathroom of number ten. He was so fair, and his beard so sparse, that the job really only needed to be done twice weekly; but the chilly, slightly grubby bathroom was the only place of sanctuary. If he dawdled in here until eight, he could plausibly say he needed to leave for work immediately. He dreaded having to talk to Kay.  
  
  He had only managed to head off discussion the previous evening by initiating the most prolonged and inventive coupling they had enjoyed since the very earliest days of their relationship. Kay had responded immediately and with unnerving enthusiasm: flicking herself from position to position; drawing up her strong, stocky legs for him; contorting like the Slavic acrobat she so closely resembled, with her olive skin and very short dark hair. Too late, he had realized that she was taking this uncharacteristic act of assertion as a tacit confession of those things he was determined to avoid saying. She had kissed him greedily; he had found her wet intrusive kisses erotic when the affair began, now he found them vaguely repellent. He took a long time to climax, his horror at what he had started constantly threatening to deflate his erection. Even this worked against him: she seemed to take his unusual stamina as a display of virtuosity.  
  
  When at last it was over, she had cuddled close to him in the darkness and stroked his hair for a while. Miserably he stared into the void, aware that after all his vague plans for loosening the ties, he had involuntarily tightened them. After she had fallen asleep, he had lain with one arm trapped underneath her, the damp sheet adhering unpleasantly to his thigh, on a mattress lumpy with old springs, and wished for the courage to be a bastard, to slip away and never return.  
  
  Kay's bathroom smelt of mould and damp sponges. A number of hairs were stuck to the side of the small bath. Paint was peeling off the walls.  
  
  'It needs some work,' Kay had said.  
  
  Gavin had been careful not to volunteer any help. The things he had not said to her were his talisman and safeguard; he strung them together in his mind and checked them off like beads on a rosary. He had never said 'love'. He had never talked about marriage. He had never asked her to move to Pagford. And yet, here she was, and somehow, she made him feel responsible.  
  
  His face stared back at him from out of the tarnished mirror. There were purple shadows under his eyes, and his thinning blond hair was wispy and dry. The naked bulb overhead lit the weak, goaty face with forensic cruelty.  
  
  Thirty-four, he thought, and I look at least forty.  
  
  He lifted the razor and delicately strafed off those two thick blond hairs that grew either side of his prominent Adam's apple.  
  
  Fists pummelled the bathroom door. Gavin's hand slipped and blood dripped from his thin neck to speckle his clean white shirt.  
  
  'Your boyfriend,' came a furious female scream, 'is still in the bathroom and I am going to be late!'  
  
  'I've finished!' he shouted.  
  
  The gash stung, but what did that matter? Here was his excuse, ready-made: Look what your daughter made me do. I'll have to go home and change my shirt before work. With an almost light heart he grabbed the tie and jacket he had hung over the hook on the back of the door, and unlocked it.  
  
  Gaia pushed past, slammed the door behind her and rammed the lock home. Out on the tiny landing, which was thick with an unpleasant smell of burnt rubber, Gavin remembered the headboard banging against the wall last night, the creaking of the cheap pine bed, Kay's groans and yelps. It was easy to forget, sometimes, that her daughter was in the house.  
  
  He jogged down the carpetless stairs. Kay had told him of her plans to sand and polish them, but he doubted that she would ever do it; her flat in London had been shabby and in poor repair. In any case, he was convinced that she was expecting to move in with him quite soon, but he would not allow it; that was the final bastion, and there, if forced, he would make his stand.  
  
  'What have you done to yourself?' Kay squealed, catching sight of the blood on his shirt. She was wearing the cheap scarlet kimono that he did not like, but which suited her so well.  
  
  'Gaia banged on the door and made me jump. I'm going to have to go home and change. '  
  
  'Oh, but I've made you breakfast!' she said quickly.  
  
  He realized that the smell of burning rubber was actually scrambled eggs. They looked anaemic and overcooked.  
  
  'I can't, Kay, I've got to change this shirt, I've got an early - '  
  
  She was already spooning the congealed mass onto plates.  
  
  'Five minutes, surely you can stay five - ?'  
  
  The mobile phone in his jacket pocket buzzed loudly and he pulled it out, wondering whether  
he would have the nerve to pretend that it was an urgent summons.  
  
  'Jesus Christ,' he said, in unfeigned horror.  
  
  'What's the matter?'  
  
  'Barry. Barry Fairbrother! He's . . . fuck, he's . . . he's dead! It's from Miles. Jesus Christ. Jesus fucking Christ!'  
  
  She laid down the wooden spoon.  
  
  'Who's Barry Fairbrother?'  
  
  'I play squash with him. He's only forty-four! Jesus Christ!'  
  
  He read the text message again. Kay watched him, confused. She knew that Miles was Gavin's partner at the solicitor's, but had never been introduced to him. Barry Fairbrother was no more than a name to her.  
  
  There came a thunderous banging from the stairs: Gaia was stamping as she ran.  
  
  'Eggs,' she stated, at the kitchen door. 'Like you make me every morning. Not. And thanks to him,' with a venomous look at the back of Gavin's head, 'I've probably missed the bloody bus. '  
  
  'Well, if you hadn't spent so long doing your hair,' Kay shouted at the figure of her retreating daughter, who did not respond, but stormed down the hall, her bag bouncing off the walls, and slammed the front door behind her.  
  
  'Kay, I've got to go,' said Gavin.  
  
  'But look, I've got it all ready, you could have it before - '  
  
  'I've got to change my shirt. And, shit, I did Barry's will for him, I'll need to look it out. No, I'm sorry, I've got to go. I can't believe it,' he added, rereading Miles' text. 'I can't believe it. We only played squash on Thursday. I can't - Jesus. '  
  
  A man had died; there was nothing she could say, not without putting herself in the wrong. He kissed her briefly on her unresponsive mouth, and then walked away, up the dark narrow hall.  
  
  'Will I see you - ?'  
  
  'I'll call you later,' he shouted over her, pretending not to hear.  
  
  Gavin hurried across the road to his car, gulping the crisp, cold air, holding the fact of Barry's death in his mind like a phial of volatile liquid that he dare not agitate. As he turned the key in the ignition, he imagined Barry's twin daughters crying, face down in their bunk beds. He had seen them lying like that, one above the other, each playing on a Nintendo DS, when he passed the door of their bedroom the very last time he had gone round for dinner.  
  
  The Fairbrothers had been the most devoted couple he knew. He would never eat at their house again. He used to tell Barry how lucky he was. Not so lucky after all.  
  
  Someone was coming down the pavement towards him; in a panic that it was Gaia, coming to shout at him or to demand a lift, he reversed too hard and hit the car behind him: Kay's old Vauxhall Corsa. The passer-by drew level with his window, and was revealed to be an emaciated, hobbling old woman in carpet slippers. Sweating, Gavin swung his steering wheel around and squeezed out of the space. As he accelerated, he glanced in the rear-view mirror and saw Gaia letting herself back into Kay's house.  
  
  He was having difficulty getting enough air into his lungs. There was a tight knot in his chest. Only now did he realize that Barry Fairbrother had been his best friend.  
  
  VI  
  
  The school bus had reached the Fields, the sprawling estate that lay on the outskirts of the city of Yarvil. Dirty grey houses, some of them spray-painted with initials and obscenities; the occasional boarded window; satellite dishes and overgrown grass - none of it was any more worthy of Andrew's sustained attention than the ruined abbey of Pagford, glittering with frost. Andrew had once been intrigued and intimidated by the Fields, but familiarity had long since rendered it all commonplace.  
  
  The pavements swarmed with children and teenagers walking towards school, many of them in T-shirts, despite the cold. Andrew spotted Krystal Weedon, byword and dirty joke. She was bouncing along, laughing uproariously, in the middle of a mixed group of teenagers. Multiple earrings swung from each ear, and the string of her thong was clearly visible above her low-slung tracksuit bottoms. Andrew had known her since primary school, and she featured in many of the most highly coloured memories of his extreme youth. They had jeered at her name, but instead of crying, as most of the little girls would have done, five-year-old Krystal had caught on, cackled and shrieked, 'Weed-on! Krystal weed-on!' And she had pulled down her pants in the middle of class and pretended to do it. He retained a vivid memory of her bare pink vulva; it was as though Father Christmas had popped up in their midst; and he remembered Miss Oates, bright red in the face, marching Krystal from the room.

I usually wake up around 5am and have coffee and mess around on my phone for a bit then fall back asleep. Which is what I did today. I thought I woke up but my vision was messed up and it happened 4 or 5 times with different scenarios each time but all felt extremely real. On the last one before actually waking up. I thought to myself am I dead cause this is a loop have I died and I’m trapped in a loop. This is exactly what I thought so I came back to the bedroom and kneeled in front of the bed just thinking fuck I’ve died. It all felt real. After that one I actually woke up and jumped up and checked my kids and wife and did some stuff outside to make sure it was real and I was actually awake.

1lxz2gx,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1lxz2gx/his_laugh_made_my_eyes_prickle_hey_love_bug/,"His laugh made my eyes prickle. ""Hey love bug.","Please don't do this."" I begged over and over, but no one was listening. ""I am your luna."" I screamed at the top of my lungs, but then his laugh from the other room broke all the fight in me.

""Luke please."" I begged once more time, my voice horse.

""Take it once it's done. Toss her out. She will have to survive on her own from here on out.""

He can't mean that. This was our baby.

""Is a mistake from the Moon Goddess. One I will rectify."" His voice called again from the other room. He wouldn't even face me. ""Now do it. That's a command.""

""Yes, Alpha.""

""Oh, and doctor?"" Her sweet voice called from the other room. My stepsister, Shannon. I gritted my teeth. ""Don't use any anesthetic. She should feel everything.""

""Yes, Luna."" The doctor turned back to me with sad eyes, but when he picked up the scalpel, I knew I was screwed.

I'm sorry, baby. Momma couldn't save you. I tried to rub my stomach, but the nurses had strapped me down. When the doctor approached, I realized he was using a silver blade.

""Silver?"" My whisper was almost silent, but he nodded. I knew then that Shannon didn't want me to survive. She wanted my life so badly that she lied about me cheating on my mate, showing photos as proof.

I cried silently as the doctor cut into my abdomen, and I felt my baby thrash inside. He knew it was too early to be born. This was a death sentence for both of us.

""Bring me the body of the pup.""

""Yes Alpha.""

I felt every slice as he cut into me, and finally I could take it no longer. I thrashed against the restraints. But the silver had made me weak.

""Doctor, now.""

""Yes Alpha."" The doctor picked the baby up and rushed out, leaving me spread open to the elements.

I felt my life slipping away as the door opened and Shannon came in. Her smug smile was firmly in place.

""I told you I would take your life, Amy. I would have your mate. "" Shannon walked over and laid a kiss on my face as I snarled. ""He is perfection. And don't worry. I will give him another son."" She laid her hand on her stomach and I started to laugh. ""What's so funny?""

""I can smell the beta on you. That's Derek's child, and it's a girl. Nice try though.""

She snarled and raised her hand, growing her claws to deliver the final blow, but the door was ripped open and my mate, the man I now hated most in the world, stepped inside. His eyes were red, and I started to laugh again.

""You runt!"" He snarled and struck out, whipping Shannon to the other side of the room.

""Brandon!"" Shannon shrieked as she hit the wall. ""What's wrong?"" She staggered to her feet, but more blood dripped out of me and I closed my eyes.

""You lied!"" He screamed, shaking the walls as his aura struck out, but I could barely feel it. I felt the silver travelling in my veins getting closer to my sluggish heart. ""This was my pup. I can smell me on him."" Brandon's eyes grew redder as the tears gathered. ""She did cheat on you. I guess I was wrong about the pup.""

""You said you smelt it."" From the sound of it, he lunged for her again, but him clutching our baby in his arm was the last thing I saw. And I wanted to never see it again. He did this to us. Not Shannon.

She played her part well, sure, but him not believing me, not waiting for a few more days to smell the pup, that was his fault. And all of our downfalls.

I prayed for the moon goddess to take me. I no longer wanted to be here. I wanted to be with my pup.

""Save her.""

""No!"" Shannon screamed. ""I am the Luna now, you marked me last night."" Ah, so that was the pain I felt last night.

I cracked my eyes to see my mate, Brandon, hovering next to me. ""Stay with me Amy.""

""No!"" I slammed out, putting all of my power in it.

Brandon looked down at me, pleading. ""Let me save you.""

""I am descended from the Moon Goddess, and you don't deserve to save me. You don't deserve our pup. You were weak. And now you lost everything."" I smiled up at him as I felt my life from my body.

Chapter Two

I opened my eyes to find myself surprisingly alive. ""Amy hurry, you're going to be late."" I jolted up and look around, confused. What was going on? Where was I? ""Amy!"" The voice called again and I shook myself. I stood up from the bed and looked around again. I recognized this room. It was my childhood bedroom.

I hadn't stepped foot in this room since I found my mate, Brandon. I heard a knock on the door and my mother opened it. Before I could process what was happening, I ran into my mother's arms. ""Mom, you're here."" I started to cry. ""I've missed you so much.""

""Amy. My girl."" She laughed as she patted my back. ""I saw you yesterday."" She pulled back and I looked into her amber eyes that matched my own. ""Happy birthday, baby.""

I leaned into her hands and realized that today was the last day I spent at home. I found my mate on my eighteenth birthday. ""Thank you, mom.""

""Hopefully, you will meet your mate today and start your new life."" She smiled at me and I felt my blood freeze. I didn't want to meet Brandon. Not when I knew what was going to happen.

""I'd rather stay here with you."" I smiled as I kissed her cheek. ""I don't want to miss you and Morgan.

And I knew that when Brandon thought I cheated on him, before he treated my baby and me like that. He also did the same to my mother for her involvement. Shannon's father, my mother's husband, watched her die.

""Baby. You won't miss us. We will be there every step of the way."" She kissed my cheek, and I wrapped my fingers around hers.

""Mom, can we just leave? You and me? Leave Shannon and Morgan and move back to daddy's pack?"" My father, the Alpha of the Silvermoon pack, wasn't a good husband, but he was a good man. He cheated on my mother, betraying her when he was drunk.

His betrayal cost the life of my brother growing inside of her, and she refused to move past it.

""No baby. I can't go back."" My mother's face fell as she turned away.

""I don't want to be betrayed, mom. Not like you and not any worse. I don't want a mate."" I whispered my new truth.

""What do you know?"" I watched as her eyes searched mine.

I pulled her back into my room and away from the door. ""I don't know for sure, but I am terrified that if I am mated to Shannon's boyfriend, I will die after we are mated. Mom, the chances that he will match with an Alpha far outweigh the chance that he is mated to the daughter of the beta."" I pulled back. ""I don't want this for me.""

She weighed my words, and I watched as she came to the same conclusion. ""Okay baby. But you can't leave. It would be too conspicuous. You will have to mask your scent whenever he is around.""

I tossed my hands in the air. ""How would I do that?""

""There is much you don't know that I would leave in the past but if you are sure..."" She trailed off and I just nodded my head. ""Then let me make a few calls. You don't have to go to school today.""

I lept back into her arms. ""Thank you, mom. I don't know what I would do without you.""

""I love you, baby. You will never be without me. That I can promise you."" She kissed my cheek and then left me alone in my room.

I ran to my phone and checked the date to make sure. It was twenty eighteen; I went back six years. Six years to the day that I met Brandon. I could relive everything, make better choices. I could live, and maybe this time around, so would my pup.

I went into my ensuite and jumped into the shower. No way was I going to face today, looking like I just crawled out of bed. I stood in side my closet in a towel trying to figure out what to wear when I heard my bedroom door open.

I was about to turn and call out to my mother, but I heard a soft step, which my mother wouldn't do. So I hid behind my winter coats and I waited.

""I'm telling you, if she is Brandon's mate, I'm going to destroy her.""

""You can't mean that, Shan."" The nasily voice of Megan, Shannon's best friend, came from the cell phone pressed to her ear.

""Of course I do. Brandon is mine.""

""Only because you put out. He was hoping Shannon would notice him.""

""You shut your mouth, Megan."" Shannon snarled and her eyes flashed. ""He's mine.""

""Whatever I gotta go,"" Megan called, and then the line went dead. A honk sounded from outside and Shannon was snatching something before I grabbed her hand.

""What do you think you're doing in my closet?""

""Amy?"" Shannon's mouth dropped out. I squeezed her hand until I heard a crack. Her scream was muffled by my hand.

""You're lucky I only broke one finger. You just threatened to destroy me. Didn't I hear that correctly? A beta's daughter threatening an alpha."" I tsked.

""I didn't do anything."" She snarled back at me as her hand reformed.

""Lie again and I will break all of your fingers and hold them while the bones heal."" I couldn't stop my grin as I felt her tremble. ""Did you threaten me?""

""Yes."" she screamed at me. ""You're going to take Brandon from me.""

""I don't want your pathetic alpha now or ever. Keep him."" I pushed her away. ""Now get out of my room before I change my mind about maiming you."" I turned back to my clothes and picked out low-rise jeans and a tank top.

""What is your problem?""

""You. Now leave."" I let my wolf come forward and my eyes flashed. I pushed my alpha command into my words and forcing her out of my room. Foolish girl. How dare she come into my room to take something of mine? My wolf growled lowly. This was our den. I shook myself and refocused. Closing the doors, I hopped back into bed, pulling out my phone. I tried to remember everything that happened in the last six years that could help me with my plan. Because make no mistake, Brandon and Shannon would pay.

Chapter Three

""Pack your bags, Amy."" My mom came in, surprising me from the list I was making.

""What?"" I looked up. ""Why?""

""You are going to spend the summer with your father. I already got the approval from the Alpha."" Mom smiled down at me. ""Come on, baby. Pack your bag and get ready.""

I jumped to my feet and ran to my mom. ""I can go?""

""Just for the summer, baby, then you will be back here with me. I had to promise that you would be returning here.""

I pouted. ""Mom, I really don't want to be here."" I wanted to make them pay, but I wouldn't risk him finding me.

""It's okay baby, you will understand once you see your dad."" She patted my hair and kissed my cheek. ""Now get ready.""

""Okay mom."" I kissed her back then she left me alone. I grabbed my phone to lock it and then turned back to my closet. I packed my bag and then headed into my bathroom when I heard the downstairs door slam open.

""I knew it."" I heard Shannon scream down stairs. I ignored her as I grabbed everything from my bathroom and then I grabbed my laptop and chargers. I stuffed everything in to my backpack and headed downstairs.

""Shannon, why are you screaming?"" Morgan was at the table with his coffee, and my mom was running around when I pushed my suitcase into the room.

""I'm not Brandon's mate, daddy."" Shannon flew into the room and dove into his arms.

""How are you so sure?"" Morgan wrapped his arms around her, but I just snickered. She snapped her eyes to me and she flew at me.

""It's you."" Shannon tried to claw out my eyes. But I just sent her flying with a backhand.

""Amy!"" Morgan got to his feet but my mom tsked.

""Morgan, you can't yell ay Amy for protecting herself. Shan attacked her first."" My mom placed my breakfast on the table. ""Amy, come eat. You have a long day ahead.""

""Babe? Why does Amy have a suitcase?""

""She is going away for the summer. To her fathers."" My mother turned to me and opened her arms. ""Come baby. Come eat. The car is coming and you need to be ready to go.""

I walked over and sat down, and dug in.

""Why is she going to her dads?"" Morgan walked over to pick Shannon up.

""She wanted to spend the summer with her dads before college and who am I to say no?"" My mom smiled down at me and I smiled back at her. I didn't know what was going to happen this summer to protect me from Brandon finding out I was his mate, but I needed it. Whatever it was, I needed it.

""Yeah, my dad called me this morning and since I haven't seen him since Christmas break and when he offered to fly me out, I asked my mom."" I smiled sweetly over at Morgan, and Shannon smiled.

""You're leaving?"" Shannon stood up.

""Yup. I'll be gone the full summer."" I smirked over at her. ""But my room is locked, and it will stay that way."" My smile dropped away as I stared at her and used my alpha command.

""Amy!"" Morgan yelled out. ""You know you're not allowed to alpha command your step sister!""

""And I wouldn't have Morgan, if I hdn't found her in my room this morning, trying to take things out of my closet."" I turned and raised my eyebrow, daring her to try to lie.

""Is that true?"" Morgan looked down at Shannon and I just stared at her. I watch her open her mouth to deny it.

""I wouldn't lie. I'll just command you to tell the truth."" She screeched and stomped her foot.

""Yes!"" she screamed. ""Are you happy? Yes, I went into her closet to steal some clothes because I know she is Brandon's mate.""

""How?"" I threw up my hands, playing like I didn't know the truth. ""How could you possibly know that I am his mate? Neither of us has scented each other.""

""Because he scented you on me!"" Her voice was hitting a higher octave, and my ears were starting to hurt.

""Calm down. You're hurting everyone's ears and just explain yourself."" My mom sat next to me at the table, rubbing her head.

""Last month, Brandon turned eighteen, and I was wearing Amy's dress. He scented around me and said I smelt divine. But when I'm not wearing her clothes, he has zero interest in me."" Shannon pouted.

""So he likes the way I smell, doesn't mean we are mates."" I pointed out. Completely and utterly denouncing Brandon as a mate. If I didn't accept him, he would never be my mate anyway, and I would never accept him. That was the only thing I was sure of.

Brandon would be the last male I would ever touch this time around.

""Stop being obtuse Amy. We all know what it means when a wolf likes your smell."" Shannon started to cry and buried her head in her hands. ""He's the male I want, daddy. The only one I would ever accept. But he wants her."" She pointed to me.

I scoffed. ""I don't want your sloppy seconds, Shannon. Even if he was my mate, and I am not saying he is. It would be a cold day before I accepted him as a mate. I would take the Lycan King over Brandon."" I threw my head back and laughed when she gasped.

The Lycan king was the bogeyman of all wolves.

The last Lycan to exist and one who lives in the wild. It's said the only wolves that ever see his face are the council that oversees the packs.

But either way, I wasn't lying. I would take the King as a mate before I would even look in Brandon's vicinity.

""You're lying. He's the alpha.""

""And?""

""Everyone wants to be the luna.""

""Idiots want to be the luna."" I turned back and finished my food as Morgan calmed her down. My mom stood when she heard a horn.

""That's for you.""

I nodded as I stood and kissed my mother goodbye before I left.

Chapter Four

I slipped into the back of the car after putting my bags in the back and buckled in. I had barely takin a breath before I launched myself over the seats and into the driver's arms.

His laugh made my eyes prickle. ""Hey love bug.""

""Uncle Ronnie. I've missed you."" I climbed over the seats and sat up front. ""What are you doing here?"" Ronnie was my dad's beta. Not related, but he had been there for most of my life.

""You think I was going to let my cheeky niece come to pack lands alone? Not on your life.""

""Dad sent you?"" I laughed.

""Dad sent me. He is a worry wart your da."" He smiled over and laughed with me. ""As soon as your mom called, he sent me with the jet.""

""He didn't have to."" I just shook my head and buckled my seatbelt.

""Of course he did. He never gets to see you enough, and now you're sending in the summer. What's going on?"" My uncle looked at me and I just shook my head.

""I don't want to be here.""

""Why?""

I looked down at my hands that were twisted. ""I'm afraid that my mate is here and I don't want to be right. I figured if I ran away, I could push off the inevitability.""

""Why wouldn; t you want your mate?"" My uncle asked as he zipped down the highway toward the airport.

""I'll tell both you and dad, just not now."" My uncle looked over at me, searching my face and then nodding.",1,1752322706.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

*”You have to remember, Julie, that your goal is to win support for your school construction project; you are not there to entertain or to provide grounds for gossip. You have to balance taking risks yourself and asking them to take risks. I mean after all, they are hockey moms who can be as competitive as the young players on ice. You need the eyes and ears to see people who you will not be able to win over. Be in control and pace yourself, don’t rush! You are very trustful, transparent, and sincere--but that doesn't mean that they are. You need to do a lot of your Buddhist chanting.”*

Good point and I hope to report tomorrow on what transpires. In the meanwhile, let's jump back to Daisaku Ikeda’s lecture. He next cites Nichiren’s interpretation of the Tatsunokuchi Persecution.

***On the twelfth day of the ninth month of last year [1271, on the occasion of the Tatsunokuchi Persecution], between the hours of the rat and the ox (11:00 p.m. to 3:00 a.m.), this person named Nichiren was beheaded. It is his soul that has come to this island of Sado and, in the second month of the following year, snowbound, is writing this to send to his close disciples. [The description of the evil age in the “Encouraging Devotion” chapter seems] terrible, but [one who cares nothing about oneself for the sake of the Law has] nothing to be frightened about. Others reading it will be terrified. This scriptural passage is the bright mirror that Shakyamuni, Many Treasures, and the Buddhas of the ten directions left for the future of Japan, and in which the present state of the country is reflected. (WND-1, 269)”***

Daisaku Ikeda comments: 

>At the beginning of his discussion on the twenty-line verse section, the Daishonin explains the significance of his undergoing the Tatsunokuchi Persecution. In other words, he starts by revealing his state of life in having vanquished the three powerful enemies. It is a declaration of spiritual triumph. This important passage signifies that “The Opening of the Eyes” as a whole can be viewed as a paean of victory. 

Wow! “A paean of victory”! I feel deeply in my heart that if I am able to win the support of my half dozen or so friends, our bond issue will be successful! 

Dr. Ikeda:

>In writing “this person named Nichiren was beheaded,” he is declaring that his status up to that time—in which he conducted himself as an ordinary person—came to an end at Tatsunokuchi. 

>The Daishonin is indicating here that at Tatsunokuchi he cast off his transient status and revealed his true identity. He uses the word *soul* to refer to that true identity—the Buddha of limitless joy enlightened since time without beginning. His soul, he says, has come to Sado. This represents a declaration of his state of life, his towering resolve from his place of exile to henceforth, as the original Buddha of the Latter Day, take the lead for the widespread propagation of the Mystic Law. 

Let me cast off a bit of my transient status this morning, vanquish some inner and outer powerful enemies,  declare some spiritual triumph, and reveal a bit of my “Buddha of limitless joy!”

1lxz106,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewTheRoom/comments/1lxz106/explore_aglucky_z5880_red_countertop_ice_maker_is/,Explore AGLUCKY Z5880 Red Countertop Ice Maker: Is it Worth It?,"Testing out the AGLUCKY Z5880-RED has been a game-changer for someone like me who loves hosting gatherings and keeping the fridge stocked with ice-cold beverages. It’s marketed as a countertop portable ice maker that produces 26 pounds of ice in just 24 hours. Naturally, I had to see if it delivered on its bold promises, especially since my previous ice maker was a bit of a disappointment. I’ve spent a solid few weeks letting it work overtime, and I have plenty of thoughts – both good and bad – about this machine.

**Design and Build Quality**

Right out of the box, the sleek, compact design of the portable ice maker caught my attention. Its bright red finish stands out boldly in the kitchen, adding a modern vibe while taking up minimal counter space. Measuring 12.3 inches deep, 8.7 inches wide, and 12.6 inches tall, it’s surprisingly compact for its capacity. It easily tucks into any corner without obstructing my workflow in the kitchen. The transparent top window is a clever addition; I can check the ice level at a glance without opening the lid. Its lightweight build at approximately 15.82 pounds makes it easy to move around, whether I want it on my counter or at a friend’s backyard BBQ. However, while the exterior feels sturdy, the plastic on the inside feels a little flimsy – something that could be a concern for durability in the long run.

**Performance and Ice Production**

AGLUCKY claims this machine produces 9 bullet-shaped ice cubes in just 6-8 minutes, and honestly, I was pretty skeptical. But after multiple trials, the claims hold—this ice maker is impressively fast. By the time dinner’s ready, I’ve got a fresh batch of ice cubes for everyone’s drinks. What’s even better is that it’s efficient enough to churn out up to 26 pounds of ice daily, perfect for parties or even everyday use in a larger household. The two size options (small and large cubes) are convenient depending on what you’re using the ice for. The smaller size works great for blended drinks, while the larger cubes stay solid longer for drinks like iced coffee.

**Ease of Operation**

Everything about how this machine works is intuitive. I didn’t even need to look up the manual (though there’s one included). The interface is straightforward, with indicators that notify you when the water reservoir is empty or when the ice bucket is full. With these reminders, I never had to second-guess whether everything was running smoothly. And let’s not forget the built-in self-cleaning function—a lifesaver! All you need to do is press a button, and the machine does the dirty work of cleaning its interior. No muss, no fuss.

**Highlights**

- Produces 9 ice cubes in under 10 minutes.  
- Can generate up to 26 pounds of ice per day.  
- Compact and portable for versatile usage.  
- Transparent lid to monitor ice production.  
- Self-cleaning function for added convenience.  

**Areas for Improvement**

While the ice machine has plenty of upsides, a few things stood out as less-than-perfect. The first drawback is the noise; while it’s quieter than many alternatives, you can’t ignore the low hum it produces. Not deafening, but certainly noticeable in a quiet space. Additionally, the plastic ice tray and scoop feel a little cheap, and I found myself wondering if they’d hold up without cracking over time. Lastly, for anyone looking to store ice long-term, this machine lacks a freezer compartment. Ice that’s not used quickly begins to melt and recirculates back for future production.  

- Slightly noisy as it operates.  
- Plastic parts feel fragile compared to the rest of the build.  
- Doesn’t store ice long-term due to the absence of freezing capability.  

**Competing Products**

When measured against competitors, this ice maker fares well for its efficiency and compact nature. For example, models like the GE Profile Opal tend to outperform in long-term ice storage due to their built-in freezer aspects, but they often cost significantly more and are bulkier—making them less portable. On the other hand, some cheaper alternatives might cut corners on features like self-cleaning or customizable ice sizes, so the AGLUCKY Z5880-RED strikes a good balance in terms of portability and functionality.  

**Quality for Price**

Balancing its price point with its capabilities, the AGLUCKY ice maker provides solid value for someone after a quick, easy-to-operate ice machine for personal or frequent party use. Its two ice size options, self-cleaning mode, and compact design make it an excellent option in its category. While it doesn’t have the bells and whistles of premium-tier units, you won’t feel like you’ve overpaid for what it delivers. Essentially, you get what you pay for: a reliable, hardworking machine that can handle your daily ice demands.

1lxz0yd,https://www.reddit.com/r/delhi/comments/1lxz0yd/went_to_a_business_interaction_today/,Went to a 'business interaction' today.,"Before you feel bad for me that I fell for such a well known scam, I must clarify that I had a very good idea of this being a scam. I just went there to have an experience with these scammers, to see how the scam world has evolved and also an excuse for a solo date😂
So starting from the beginning, I know this friend from Reddit itself. He and I both are Bangalis( Bengalis; that's what we like to call ourselves, 'Bangalis') and I enjoyed talking to him. We exchanged contacts as well and everything was well except when in March, all of a sudden he tells me ' I have quit my job and Focusing on my start up and making huge profits' Okay, great for him I thought. Then he used to call me often, usually when I am busy so didn't get time to contact him. Recently, as I was sharing my CV to a company for an internship, I thought of sharing it with him as well because he had been asking me for my CV for a LOOOOOOOONG time. He contacted me, said my CV is 'impressive' and his senior partners really liked it. He asked me if I am free tomorrow and that he would schedule a meeting with the 'senior business partner' at Starbucks, CP.
Red Flags till now:

🚩 If this us a profitable venture why would he be calling me several times when I don't even know him that well? Why would he chase after people instead of people chasing him, willing to be a part of such a venture?


🚩The 'senior business partner' just happens to be free the next day at 12PM for a meeting at Starbucks with a random college student?


🚩When I asked him what skills can I bring to the team as I am not formally educated in business administration? He's like business needs no education, just like a Chaiwala sells chai and makes profit, you just need to sell your product and make profit. Seriously?🙏😭


🚩After this a team acquistion member called me, trying to be as professional and Bona Fide as she can. ""Bring aadhar card, don't carry huge luggage, be on time, as our senior partner will be there and we value their time a lot"". Okay bro, the same senior partner who will be meeting a teenager for a business interaction?


🚩Why schedule a direct offline meeting with a potential member? Why at a cafe and not a office? Oh, that's becuase you don't have one and one only needs to work 2-3 hours a day 
I thought to myself, let's go and see what this scam is about (10% of me wanted to trust this guy has he had shared a lot about himself and seemed genuine. Woke up early and all, but this discipline is not wasted at least!)


🚩 My friend's social media was filled with pictures of him in Malaysia. You mean to say you can be profitable enough to make enough to fund a trip to malaysia after working for 3 months for 2-3 hours a day??💀


🚩The talent acquisition woman could barely talk to me in English. If only they took the time to learn English themselves or better yet send a formal email written by ChatGPT, they would probably still have a better chance at fooling someone
Went to starbucks 15 minutes before the meeting, ordered an overpriced orange drink which cost me 280 INR, at least got the container in which I can collect coins✨


The 'partner' came 13mins after Noon. I was about to leave at 12:15 and go grab lunch at Sandoz with a very sweet woman I had met at Starbucks itself. He asked me if I want a coffee or sm to which I replied in the negative. He then ordered one coffee for himself and we sat down to talk. He explained to me everything about business, their venture, history of the company, adulated the 'senior business partner' to such an extent I thought she is the CEO of an MNC💀
He shared so much about this personal life, anyone naive enough would fall for this act, espcially if they had money to spare.
Red flags:


🚩 Didn't drink his coffee in the enitre 1 hour we talked and we know how much starbucks coffee cost, I even reminded him tha your coffee will be cold he is like no matter. You trying to show me you are so rich that you don't care for a meagre 400 rupees capuccinno? Would have been better if you had it. You think the self-made rich waste food they buy to flex their wealth? 


🚩Dodged my questions of:what skills can I bring to the table, what's the history of the company, how did you come up here etc


🚩Poor communication skills. For someone working with international clinetele, you would expect them to have a strong hold on English and basic communication skills. 


Then the 'Senior partner' came along and oh god she told me everything about her family, marriage, son..how she is paying 54000 for her son's tuition without batting an eyelid when she couldn't afford more then 15k before, that she even purchased a home for her parents in Delhi.
She told me the business is about back end web development and research, for companies like Apple,Kent etc and you have to provide market analysis to them, so that they can start their company websites in new countries. Apparently Post-Covid, the whole business shifted online.
She talked to me like a mother and for a moment I genuinely enjoyed talking to her.
She talked about how this business was started by her sister, how she found her two business partners through similar 'interviews'
Ofcourse, my heart sank when I heard initial investment of '3lakhs'. I knew I was right, even though a tiny bit of myself wanted them to be genuine so that I could at least gain some skills and add them to my CV, money was not a priority
She even gave a very genuine sounding breakdown 'You will have your own website, certificate, licence, etc etc'
I told her that  I don't have access to such funds and she's like 'just discuss with your friend about how to arrange the money etc etc'
You yourself struggled with money and you are asking a college student to shell out 3 lakhs out of nowhere??? Like bro?? At least try to tie up the loose ends when you are making such an effort.
I guess I don't need to point out the red flags here.
Thing is, money doesn't come this easily. People work for years after years to be successful and a business is built on ethics. If I was expanding my small, tight-knit business, why would I ask a member to pay money to join when I already have profits? I would rather bear their starting costs and then take a share of their profits.
I am not exposing their names as they will be burnt out soon anyway. If they had just worked hard with the presentation skills they had, I am sure they would have gone a long way and have a strong, ethically grounded career. 
Sadly, these scams are very common as people might see them as a way of easy money, similar to black money, maybe?
My friend and the junior partner who met me first even have genuine, well connected LinkedIn profiles. Baffles me how far these scams have come.
My friend seemed genuine,but then again only had known him for a year that through via reddit. I had hoped for a good future for him and his family. Alas. Maybe he has invested 3 lakhs and is now looking to scam others. Don't know how he got to Malaysia though, maybe other people had fell for it and given him this 'start up money'

🚩Didn't even offer me to buy an expensive Starbucks coffee to flex her wealth. Though I don't drink coffee but would have been fun to exploit these scammer who thought she has me in the palm of her hand.

🚩 My friend didn't even come to the meeting, had an 'urgent meeting'. The senior partner was late too. They think this creates an image of busy bodies making them seem credible. Ofc the usual ' you are luck she is in Delhi today to meet you'. They think being late will impress me. I thank the Universe for giving me enough sense to smell this and other Bullshit logic.

Will report their profiles on LinkedIn and block my friend by calling him out.


Also, it seemed like 80% of Starbucks was filled with these 'business interactions'💀💀💀 Do they all decide on the time and venue or what?
TLDR; MLM scams are very prevalent these days. Easy money is a sham. Stay safe and work hard to live a good life. Stay away from these schemes

Alcee woke with a start and clutched her chest as the loud bang of furniture being knocked over forced her to an upright position.



Hollering in the adjoining room was coupled with the sound of fists flying and she scrambled from the bed. Digging around for the clothing and trench coat she’d worn to this hotel room, she considered her clothes were returning to her body with far more alacrity than her paramour from the night before removed them.



The sound of a man begging another to not kill him raised her hackles. Looking around frantically she knew there was only one door from the bedroom to the main hotel door but as she looked at the sliding balcony door, she deliberated whether the balcony met with the other room she’d crossed through the night before.



Grabbing her phone, purse, and shoes in her hands she quietly tiptoed to the balcony, flinching when the unmistakable sound of a silenced gun went off. She knew the pop sound as sure as her last name was Mariani.



“Fuck, fuck, fuck, Alcee you idiot!” she whimpered to herself as she stepped onto the patio. The sun was barely breaking the horizon, and the view would have been breathtaking had she not quite possibly just heard someone being murdered in the adjoining suite. “Please don’t let them be Dad’s men.”



Desperately she leaned over the balcony and noted the height of the room she was in and mentally berated herself for falling asleep. Turning to slide along the cool concrete of the balcony, she peered through the crack of the curtains into the room and saw the man she’d spent the night with unscrewing the silencer off the pistol in his hand and glaring down at the body on the floor.



She didn’t recognize him at all and as she looked around the room, she admitted even the three other men in the room who were on their knees in front of her lover and two other men towering over them, were also unknown to her. It wasn’t like she knew all of her father’s men but if someone was coming to drag her sorry ass back, he’d send someone she knew.



Which meant, she was in a hotel room with a man who in the last several minutes committed murder, and she was a witness and if her father found out, he’d order a clean up of the entire group. Not that she’d live to see it if he found out what she’d done before she made her escape. Or worse, if the man in the next room opted to simply get rid of the witness he’d fucked the night before.



She looked around again and grimaced as she looked upward. They were in a penthouse suite. The man who’d purchased her virginity for a cool million the night before was living large. She dropped her trench coat, figuring if she was going to have to shimmy onto the roof of the balcony and try to get to the roof of the hotel, she wasn’t going to be able to do it wearing a long coat. Then her eyes caught the drop again and she knew there was no way she was going to be able to get off the balcony.



She needed to find another way. She was a nerd not an athlete and scaling a building to a rooftop was going to lead to her death and she hadn’t just boldly defied her father and grandfather by giving up her virginity to a stranger instead of the man they’d betrothed her to since she was a teenager to die falling off a building.



“Good going Alcee,” she muttered under her breath, “you managed to find your escape from the Mariani family only to stupidly fall into bed with a murderer. Fuck.” She kicked a chair and then cringed as the metal scraped along the concrete floor of the patio then clattered against the glass door.



When the patio door slid open and her lover from the night before stuck his head out, she immediately cowered in the other chair. Bruno was drop dead gorgeous and incredibly massive. Easily six foot six with shoulders as wide as a linebacker’s and his feet were twice the length of hers. Her body clenched with the memory of what else was humungous on him and she shivered. If she hadn’t been so terrified in this moment, she’d be parting her legs like Moses did the sea.



“What are you doing out here?”



“Watching the sunrise,” she met his gaze fearfully, swallowing her terror where it boiled like a festering sourdough-starter in her gut. “I was going to leave but you seemingly have company.” Her hands were visibly shaking.



“Aya,” he spoke her fake name gently, moving to kneel in front of her, his hand brushing a dark curl off her forehead before gripping her fingers. “You should still be sleeping. Did I not wear you out enough?”



She shook her head unable to meet his gaze, “you, um, there was yelling, and I don’t like confrontation, so I came out here until the yelling stopped.”



“Did you look in the window?” He motioned from where he just emerged.



“No. I came out here as soon as the yelling got really loud, and I simply sat here.” She rested her chin on her knees and prayed he bought her story.



“Good girl,” he leaned forward and kissed her forehead. “I would very much like for us to see each other again but I can’t do so if you’re poking your nose where it doesn’t belong.”



“I understand, Bruno,” she whispered twisting her lips.



“You are so fucking beautiful,” he whispered as he leaned closer stroking her cheek. His eyes were a warm honeyed brown with flecks of gold, and they stared into hers like he was staring into her soul.



The scent of gunpowder was on his fingers, and it made her heart pound with fear, but she feigned ignorance as she closed her eyes when his lips connected with hers.



**Chapter 2**



When he broke the kiss she was almost distracted from the goings-on in the adjoining room.



“I told you before, I am a very wealthy man. Do you know why I bought you last night, darling?”



She shook her head, “rich men do crazy things all the time.”



“My last lover gave me an STD.” her eyes flicked to his in horror and he held up his hand, “I am clean now, as attested to by the medical report you insisted, I provide ahead of our meeting, but getting chlamydia a year ago made me want to try something completely different. A virgin was going to ensure I was safe from the machinations of a twisted, cheating, lover’s mind. I wasn’t expecting you to be as,” he paused, the back of his knuckles dragging over her bottom lip, “responsive and excitable as you turned out to be. I want you to stay. If you can be a good girl and sit here and wait until my men finish their discussion,” he drawled the word out, “then we can pick up where we left off. Since I’m your first I was hoping we can continue to see each other.”



She finally met his gaze, “you paid me a million dollars for one night, Bruno. I didn’t think it would lead to more than the one night. I have college classes, and my family is likely waiting for me.” She looked at his watch, “my family always does brunch on Sundays. I can’t miss it.”



“I would like to meet your family. I’m not letting you go, darling girl. Last night was bar none, the most exquisite night of my life and knowing you are untouched by any other man is bringing out the most primal part of me to keep you as mine and mine alone.”



She was truly terrified now, “I don’t understand.”



“I want you to be my mistress. Long term. We will fuck every night and likely every morning too,” his dark eyes were heated as they looked her over, “and in return, I will take care of your every need. There is nothing you or your family should want for. If you wish to continue your education, I have no issue with this. Where do you go to school?”



“NYU.”



“What are you taking?”



“Graphic design.” All the back story she’d concocted when she’d started this game came to her easily. She’d practiced it enough.



“Then you will continue. I’ll have your courses paid for. It won’t cost your family anything.” He frowned, “why did you sell your virginity online? What prompted you to do so?”



Alcee found herself wondering how he could hold a conversation as he was while there was a dead man in the next room but then it dawned on her, he was distracting her while the men cleaned up the situation.



“I needed the money.”



“For?”



Twisting her fingers nervously she shrugged, “school is expensive, and my parents have three kids including me. My program is sixty thousand dollars over four years. I have student loan debt and then when I graduate, I want to start my own business, and the start-up is expensive. One of my girlfriends suggested doing this black-market thing as an auction. One of her cousins did it to pay off her student loans instead of stripping. I was only looking for the sixty thousand for my program, but you bid a million and here we are.”



“You come from a large family.”



“Yes.”



Her family consisted of five children, with four older brothers, another lie told. All four of them were in arranged engagements and marriages. Her eldest brother Mercurio was married seven years ago when he was twenty-five to the daughter of his father’s Consigliere Panfilo. Panfilo was her father’s second cousin which meant her brother married within the family. She herself couldn’t fathom having sex with someone they shared DNA history with but to keep it in the family, her brother toed the line. If he wanted to be Don someday, he did what was demanded of him by their father.



“I will provide for your family.” He said as he rose to stand in front of her, extending his hand out.



A man stuck his head out the door, “Bruno, sir, we have relocated our guests, if you and your companion would like to head to the other suite across the hall for breakfast.”



“Thank you,” he nodded to the man. “Come. We will have breakfast together and discuss our future.” He lifted up her trench coat off the patio table and wrapped it over her shoulders.



Draping his arm around her he edged her through the room where the body had been, and she made certain to keep her eyes averted. Twenty-one years of living as the princess to the Mariani family, she knew when she was supposed to keep her eyes and mouth shut.



Just as he escorted her into a room across the hall, another man wearing an obvious holster came into the hall and she flinched.



“He is my head of security. As I said, I am quite wealthy and have many enemies.”



“Sir, a word?” the man motioned for Bruno to return to the suite they’d just vacated.



She didn’t waste any time. The moment the two men disappeared into the room and closed the door; she was pulling the door to the suite she was in open and racing to the far end of the hall through the emergency stairwell.



After racing down multiple flights of stairs she stopped to take a breath, wheezing like an asthmatic missing their inhaler. “Holy shit, Alcee, you need to exercise more,” she hissed at herself.



Eventually she reached the bottom floor and then made her way to the parking garage. It didn’t take long to find her way into the early morning traffic and to flag down a yellow taxi.



Giving directions to her parent’s estate, she was dropped off outside the gates and made the slow walk up the driveway.



Her mother was right behind the butler who opened the front door, her hand going to her mouth in horror, as she took in her daughter’s walk of shame, “Alcee, what have you done?”



Taking a deep breath, she met her mother’s gaze directly, “if anyone was going to sell off my virginity it was going to be me. You can tell Papa unless Don Lozano is interested in a bride who is no longer pure, I’m of no use to either family.”



A fleeting thought of the passion of the night before taunted her as she considered perhaps, she should have stayed with the murdering rich man named Bruno as all hell broke loose.



**Chapter 3**



“Susana,” Alcee groaned into her cell phone as she knelt under the desk of one of the administrators from the upper management floor, “I don’t have time for this.”



“Make time.”



The constant demands of her friends on her time was something they fought about constantly. While they were under the protection of their family, she was without and they seemed to always forget she was putting her life at risk each time she stepped outside her front door. Life wasn’t so easy when you were an ex-principessa and the streets knew the Mariani Don didn’t care if you lived or died.



“Can’t. I’m working overtime tonight.”



“Ditch it.”



“Unlike you who still has her trust fund,” she grunted as she adjusted an HDMI cable and sighed, “I need to work.” There was always a terrible fear her money would run out and she’d be struggling to provide for Antero.



“You have money in the bank!”



“There are savings in the event something happens, and I lose my job or get sick or suffer an accident or all of the above. My nest egg protects me and my family. My job keeps us fed and housed.” She backed out from under the desk and shoved back up her glasses which slipped down her nose. She plunked herself down in the chair and booted up the computer on the desk and waited for it to come back on.



“Alcee, you need to live a little.”



“Look, I’m working right now. There are six more computers I need to get set up before I can go home at the end of the day. I would very much like to focus on my task.”



“You work too hard. This isn’t good for you.”



“I work exactly hard enough to keep me alive and out of my father’s crosshairs, Susana.”



“You owe me.”



“How? On what planet does me declining a dinner invite which is a double date, a blind date for me, turn into me owing you one? This isn’t adding up.”



“I don’t know how, but you owe me. We are going do to do this double date at some point so stop putting it off.”



“Whatever,” she hung up the phone and then typed on the keyboard and watched with pleasure as the system came up and running. One down. Six more to go.



When she left her parent’s home six years ago, or more accurately when her father threw her out with nothing but the clothes on her back for being a disgrace, she’d managed to find her footing relatively quickly.



Getting hired on as an IT general specialist straight out of college at a large security firm in Manhattan, she’d been able to make a career for herself. The only hiccup was when three years ago, the company switched hands, and the Lozano family purchased the company lock stock and barrel. She’d been terrified for months they would note her last name on the employee list and fire her, or worse, kill her.



Instead, despite the sale, the new owners of the company hadn’t set foot in the building in the three years they’d owned it. The rumor mill said they were quite happy with the way the current president of the company was running things.



The current president of the company, Kylen, was hired by the previous CEO. Kylen was an ex-Navy seal who hired mostly the men and women he’d worked with in the forces or were referred to him. Alcee who was hired by the previous CEO remained one of the few outliers taken on with the recommendations of one of her college professors. She’d passed the vetting process, all the background checks and even her last name hadn’t been able to stop them from hiring her and the prior CEO took her under her wing and made her his honorary granddaughter. When he’d retired and sold the company, she knew he’d insisted to Kylen to keep her on.



It seemed the new owners presumed the current company president kept staff in place he trusted and as such nobody even breathed her name the wrong way during the transition of the company following the sale to the Lozano family. Mr. Kylen Burgess stayed on as the president and the Lozano family never bothered too much.



She knew they came to attend board meetings and the like, but she was what the upper management group called a troll. She and the other six IT generalists lived in the lower levels of the company, often referred to as the bowels of hell, by the rest of the employees. She personally found the moniker funny because in her Italian Catholic upbringing, hell was supposed to be hot, and the computer lab floor was colder than the rest of the building.



She was smirking to herself at the thought when one of her counterparts came grumbling in her direction. “What’s up, Tank?”



Tank was one of the military-trained IT guys and in command of their department. He reported directly to Kylen. He also lived up to his name in terms of size but he was usually a gentle soul, happy to sit behind his desk and plug along on a keyboard.



“All the fucking bigwigs are upstairs. Kylen let me know the CEO is moving from his office in Europe to New York. He let me know now, as in right this minute instead of, you know, giving me a heads up so I could prepare for this shit.”



She felt her stomach drop to her feet. She’d jinxed herself by even thinking of the Lozano family.



“The CEO?”



“Torquato Lozano.”



Fuck. She was going to puke. She was going to projectile vomit all over the desktop she’d put together.



**Chapter 4**



Torquato Lozano. To the business world he was a hard-nosed businessman but to those who knew what la famiglia meant, he was the Don of the Lozano family. He’d boldly and brutally overthrown his own father for the title when his grandfather stepped down. He’d been thirty-two when he took control of his family. He’d done so only one year after his family rescinded the marriage agreement once they found out she wasn’t a virgin any longer.



Now he’d be roughly thirty-seven years old, a Don for five years now and he’d made a hell of a name for himself. Her brother and he were the same age and while her brothers still talked to her and kept her in the loop about things which she needed to be aware of for her protection, the one thing her eldest brother always said was Don Lozano scared the fuck out of him, and they’d grown up with Edgardo Mariani for a father.



To this day, there wasn’t a single direct photograph of the Don of the Lozano family. Unlike his father who frequently postured and grandstanded for the notoriety of it all, Torquato operated in the shadows. Rumors swirled that he was ugly with scars running over his face and a temper to match.



It was why, of course, she’d gone through the lengths she’d gone to avoid marrying him. The last thing she wanted was to be the unwilling bride to a sadist who was ten years older than her and wanted a wife who was nothing more than a brood mare to be raped and bred day in and out until she popped out the heir to his throne.



She’d taken a big risk doing what she’d done but it paid off. Auctioning off her virginity on the dark web had been a burst of insanity. Nobody could trace who she was because she was a damn good hacker so Bruno would never be able to find out anything more than the backstory, she meticulously created and left breadcrumbs about. Her family would never figure out who to whom she’d sold herself because all traces of the experience were wiped clean, by her own hand. Once her mother threw her into her room to await her father’s arrival, she’d been on her computer in seconds, eradicating all the images of her from the hotel surveillance and nearby traffic lights, she’d transferred the money she’d received to an offshore account and erased every digital print of the night as if it never happened.



She knew she’d also done Bruno a solid because in removing every trace of herself from the computer system, she also got rid of all the evidence of his men disposing of the three bodies.



Emerging from her memory she crinkled her nose at Tank, “I’m sorry, what did you say?”



“I need you upstairs with me to help me set up the two offices. I can do the programming for the security systems we need to run but I need a second set of hands to get this done.”



“Tank, I must get the other desks set up. I’m already working overtime.”



“Not my problem. You’ll stay later.”



“Are you going to arrange the babysitter?” she shot back at him angrily, shoving her glasses back up her nose. “In case you forgot I have a kid at home who I’d like to at least see for a few minutes before he goes to bed.”



Tank sighed, “look, let’s set the offices up upstairs and then you and I will come down here and get this done.”



“Which part do you not get? My sitter is only there for two more hours. Not a minute more. If I lose my sitter, I will quit my job and then you lose one of our IT team.”



“Fine. You can come in early tomorrow.”



“Do they call you Tank because you run roughshod all over people like a tank?” It was a comment she’d made multiple times over the years.



He chuckled. “I’ll call one of the other guys to come in early. Deal?”



“Deal.” She dropped what she was doing and followed him down the hall towards the elevator. Her stomach was still churning. “When you said they were upstairs, they’re not in the offices, are they? I mean there is nothing set up yet.”



“They’re working out of the boardroom for now. They showed up unannounced or, according to Kylen with one hour’s notice. Also, the secretary or admin assistant or whatever the socially appropriate name is now for the woman who gets his coffee and dry cleaning, is a piece of work. She’s wearing six-inch heels, more lipstick than a Vogue cover girl and makes me feel every bit as insecure as I did when I got picked on by the cheer captain in middle school. I swear she’s every nerd’s worst nightmare.”



“You were a nerd, Tank?”



“I got big in the army, Alcee and switched my coke-bottle glasses for contacts but in here,” he tapped his chest, “fifteen-year-old skinny Ezekiel who preferred playing chess against the computer than talking to people still doesn’t like bitchy women who chew little boys like me up.”



She chuckled, “she can’t be so bad.”



“She took one look at Kylen, and he made sure to put the entire length of the board room table between them. I’ve known him a long time and let me tell you, even he is steering clear of her. Her name is Genevra and she’s the reason the term mean girls was coined.” He pushed the button to the top floor and jammed his fists into his pockets. “These are the days I miss mine-clearing operations.”



As the doors opened to the top floor, she found herself heartily agreeing with him. A sinking feeling the risk of her being on this floor or doing the task he’d now mentioned were equally devastating if the Lozano family found issue with her working in their building.



**Chapter 5**



She was quickly trying to get the desk set up with dual monitors, ergonomic keyboards, state of the art laptop with all the bells and whistles as far as printers and speakers and all the other accoutrements went.



The longer she worked, the more she realized she needed to resign. She’d worked for three years too long here. The minute the company shifted hands, despite the fact the CEO was rumored to be in Italy and intended to keep his base there, she should have sought employment elsewhere. She’d taken false safety in hiding right under the enemy’s nose.



The clicking of heels on the tiled floor coming in her direction made her cringe as she heard Tank utter a muffled “fuck me”. She looked into the open doorway of the CEO’s office where the giant of a man was working and saw the shudder go through him as he heard the woman approaching before, he saw her.



The woman’s muttering in Italian, a series of curses about how slow the staff was and how uncultured New Yorkers were made Alcee’s head throb and suddenly Alcee forcing herself not to divulge she could speak the language. Instead, she kept her head bent and unravelled a long cord. If she didn’t engage the woman perhaps, she’d be left alone. Her thought was incredibly short lived.



“Make sure those cords are not anywhere I am going to trip on them.” The woman’s voice shrilly skittered along Alcee’s spine.



“Yes ma’am,” she nodded, not looking up to make eye contact. She held up a clip which would conceal and pin the cords to the underside of the desk. “This will keep them off your feet.”



“Ugh, how much longer will you be?”



“Another thirty minutes, forty max.”



“Not acceptable. I want it done in fifteen minutes.”



Alcee shot a glance at Tank at the other desk, and he pressed his lips together in frustration. She felt the same sense of foreboding at the woman’s tone and knew she would not like the answer. “I’m afraid it’s impossible.”



“Make it possible.”



“And if I can’t?”



“Then you’re fired.”



This time the look she shot to Tank had him sitting up and getting ready to rush towards her. She knew the glint in her eye was not anything he could miss. This woman gave her a get out of jail free card and she’d never lost a game of Monopoly in her life. She was taking this little card and running with it.



“No, no, no, Cee, let me help.” Tank moved far faster than a man his size should as he vacated the desk he was working to prepare to come assist her.



“You cannot help her. You need to finish Mr. Lozano’s set up. He needed in his office hours ago. Instead, he is working at an uncomfortable table.”



Her accent was thick, and Alcee was convinced she was exaggerating it because she knew she could do the exact same thing if she wanted. Despite sounding as American as apple pie most of the time, if Alcee were in Italy right now, she’d blend in with her family as if she’d never left the country. The woman was trying to act as if she were better than them because of her Italian background. It made Alcee want to leave all the more. Phony bitch.



“You are given fifteen minutes, or you’re done.” The woman glared at her.



Alcee stood up from the desk, ignoring Tank’s groan and dropped the cords. “You don’t need to fire me. I quit. Ciao stronza,” she bowed deeply at the waist and turned to look at Tank with a smug grin. “Call security to meet me at my locker since it’s protocol to escort all employees who are fired or resigned from the premises.” She considered skipping to her locker.



“No, Alcee, you can’t quit,” he chased after her.



The other woman was blinking incredulously as if she’d expected Alcee to argue and try to keep her job. Did the woman actually believe she’d beg? As if. She was a Mariani. Mariani don’t beg. She might not be her father’s principessa but the name on her birth certificate was deep in her DNA. Her pride ran in her blood thicker than any other of her traits.



Kylen happened to be coming out of the board room as she hit the button for the elevator. “Tank, where are you two going? The set up can’t be done yet.”



“The ice princess over there, fired Alcee because Alcee said it would take thirty-to-forty minutes to finish the desk set up. I’m trying to beg her not to leave. Genevra wanted it done in fifteen minutes and it’s impossible. Not only that but the physical set up can be done in thirty or forty minutes but then I need to get into the computer and get it up to the standard of the company. If their laptops hadn’t gotten destroyed, then we wouldn’t be in this situation, but Mr. Lozano made it clear his personal computer is not to be associated with the business and the one he brought from Italy was destroyed in the car accident this afternoon.” He mumbled under his breath about bullets in a laptop making Alcee’s spine straighten. “We’re setting up a brand-new system for the pair of them and she’s making impossible demands. We were rushing as best we could. As it was, Alcee was supposed to be setting up the new marketing department upgrades this evening, and we let it go until tomorrow. I arranged for a crew to come in at six tomorrow to do what Alcee was taken away from completing downstairs.”



**Chapter 6**



“Alcee,” Kylen reached out to stop her from entering the elevator. He put a hand on her shoulder to keep her still. “We can clear up this misunderstanding.”



“It’s not a misunderstanding, Mr. Burgess. She told me to get it done in a fraction of the available time or I’m fired. I harbor no illusions about my abilities to perform magic and as a result, I’ve accepted my termination. I’ve asked Tank to request security walk me out.”



“While Ms. Verrilli is indeed the assistant to the CEO, she is not HR, and she can’t hire or fire.”



“The hell I can’t,” the woman approached, her heels smacking the floor. It made Alcee think of her mother who often wore the same type of shoes, but you’d never hear her coming. One was graceful, the other was not. The woman’s annoying voice was more evidence she was playing dress-up, trying to be more than she was because elegance and decorum were not anything she possessed. “She is done here. She was talking back to her superiors, and she cursed at me.”



“You heard her.” Alcee flapped her hand as the bitchy woman stomped her heel with enough force, Alcee was surprised the spike didn’t snap off. “She’s my superior and I denied her request to finish in fifteen minutes. I’m done here.”



Kylen grabbed the other woman by the arm and began dragging her away, looking over his shoulder at Alcee. “Alcee, please finish the desk setup. If you still want to quit when you’re done putting it together, then I’ll write you a glowing letter of recommendation. In the meantime, I’m going to beg Mr. Lozano remind Ms. Verrilli of her job demands and expectations.”



“Unhand me you American barbarian.” The woman was yanking on her arm as she was dragged unceremoniously down the hall.



“I’d really rather quit than deal with her,” Alcee met Tank’s eyes and knew the truth was blaring right at him in the soft brown of her irises.



“If you walk out with the job undone, he’ll make sure you can’t get hired anywhere else.” Tank threatened her. “Do you want a letter of recommendation, or do you want to be unemployed forever?”



“Ugh,” she threw her hands up in the air and marched back to the desk. “When I was in high school, I once hacked into the school system and fucked with the SAT results of my bully and made sure she didn’t get into any college and when she retook them, I did it again. I miss how easy those days were compared to this shit,” she found herself back on her knees under the desk setting up the wires she was working on earlier.



The sound of yelling down the hall, coming from the lone female voice at the end, made them both perk up and then not ten minutes after Kylen dragged her away, the woman was back in front of Alcee muttering a not-very-heartfelt apology.



“Take your time and make sure it’s done right.” The woman finished her monologue.



“Yup.” Alcee didn’t even look at the woman as she continued working.



“You are a rude American.”



She heard a man clearing his throat and a rapid exchange of Italian again and the woman stormed off furiously.



“I am sorry for my sister’s behavior.”



“Your sister?” Alcee looked up to meet the eyes of the man now standing opposite the desk she was putting together.



He extended his hand, “Bastiano Verrilli. I am the head of corporate security for Mr. Lozano. It’s nice to meet you Ms. Mariani.”



The way he said her last name sent a shiver of fear down her spine. His eyes were dark and searching and she knew without a shadow of a doubt the man knew who she was. He wasn’t the head of security for Torquato Lozano without knowing who was here on his floor.



“I’m sure the pleasure is all mine,” she whispered back without reaching to shake his proffered hand, instead ducking back under the desk to hook up the cable in her hand. The telltale sound of the printer starting up made her smile with relief. One more thing done.



“When you are done here, you are to come to the board room to see Mr. Lozano.”



She poked her head back out, smacking the top of her skull against the hard wood, “is it an order from the CEO?” The other half of her question, “or the Don,” was left unspoken but the way the man in front of her quirked an eyebrow told her the answer.



He leaned over the desk, his huge meaty hands gripping the top of it to stare straight at her, “does your father know you work for the Lozano family?”



“My father,” she grunted as she yanked on an extension cord from under the desk, “doesn’t miss a trick, Mr. Verrilli, but if you’re asking if I’ve personally been in contact with him to let him know of my day-to-day activities, I have not been permitted to speak to anyone in the Mariani family since he threw me out of their home six years ago. Aside from the occasional call from my brothers who defy his orders to check on my wellbeing, I haven’t spoken with anyone else in the family. If my father knows what I do, it is because he has looked into it, not because I volunteered information.”



The man seemed surprised, “he threw you out?”



“The minute my father found out the one thing he was using to bargain me off to Mr. Lozano was no longer intact, he tossed me on my ass. I cost him a lot of money and his face.”



“Mr. Lozano cancelled the contract.”



“Yes, because my hymen was no longer intact. I was no longer of value to the family without my virginity, so I got thrown out. It was better than the bullet he threatened me with, I suppose.”



“Wait, wait,” Mr. Verrilli seemed completely perplexed, “are you telling me your father threw you out because you weren’t a virgin?”



“Yes. He’d promised my virginity to Mr. Lozano, and I broke the covenant.”



“Mr. Lozano broke the agreement but not because –” he stopped speaking as if he was aware he was talking out of turn. “Excuse me.”



She grimaced as he almost ran to the boardroom at the end of the hall.



Mafia men were strange.

1lxyzn9,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1lxyzn9/fallen_crest_public_by_tijan/,Fallen Crest Public by Tijan,"Mason and Logan Kade are two brothers who did their own thing. They were rich and expected to attend her school, Fallen Crest Academy. They chose public school and now Samantha has to live with them. The problem is that she doesn’t care at all: about them, about her friends, about her cheating boyfriend, or even about her parent’s divorce. But maybe that’s a good thing. Maybe change is a good thing.  
  
  Samantha and Mason are together. Everyone knows it. Not everyone is dealing with it. While Mason’s ready to give them the middle finger, there’s one not going away. Her mother. Threats are issued. Ultimatums are given. Even blackmail is used, but only Samantha can put a stop to Analise. However, when a trauma from her past is triggered, she may not have the courage or strength to do what’s needed. If she doesn’t, Mason’s future could be destroyed.  
  
  I woke to a hand sliding under my top and cupping my breast.  
  
  Mason!  
  
  Then I became aware of a very masculine and muscled thigh sliding between my legs and rolling me to my stomach. As he slid my tank’s strap down, his lips went to my naked shoulder and nibbled on the back of my neck. Goosebumps broke out as I sucked in a breath. My legs pressed together, and a deep, strong throbbing started. It was pounding in a steady beat. As his lips moved down my spine, I gasped out loud. Arching my back for him, I was pressed against him. He was hard, but Mason didn’t grunt, he didn’t make a sound. Instead, his hand fell to my hip, and he pulled me even further into him. His hand caressed down my back and my tank top was bunched together into one tiny scrap of fabric. Slowly, so goddamn slowly, he pressed his chest to my back, but he was holding me up now.  
  
  I needed him now.  
  
  He slid my top up my back, trailing kisses on my spine as he did. When it was lifted over my head, I pushed up from the bed, pushing him upright with me at the same time. Enough. I couldn’t handle it anymore. I needed more of him. We were now kneeling together. As the top fell to the floor, I reached behind me for him. I needed to taste him.  
  
  My hand slid around his neck to his hair, and I grabbed a fistful of it, taking a firm hold and anchoring him to me. He grunted now, grinding into me as his lips went to my ear. I could feel him smiling as his teeth took hold of it, sucking on it. Still holding me to him, one hand cupped my breast firmly while his other hand went to my underwear. They were pushed out of the way as he slid a finger inside me. Then a second.  
  
  “Mason,” I wrenched out, turning my head for his lips.  
  
  A deep chuckle came from him as he nuzzled along my jawline, so achingly close to where I wanted him. I needed him inside of me. Now.  
  
  A shudder went through me.  
  
  God. I was already wet. The throbbing was pounding through me. To wake up like this, feeling him slowly rocking against me, I was almost panting.  
  
  His fingers pushed further inside of me, building a tempo, going slow. Leaning back into him, my hand fell to his and I urged him to go faster. It was building, but I needed it harder. Faster. His lips curved up as he nuzzled along my cheek. His other hand was rubbing over my breast, teasing me, and I fell against him. He was holding all of me up. I could barely kneel anymore, but I moved my head, searching for his lips. The desire was so blinding, but he wouldn’t kiss me, and I growled in frustration. He chuckled as his lips nipped at the corner of my lips.  
  
  “More,” I rasped out. “Now.”  
  
  “More?”  
  
  A thrill went through me when I heard the thick lust in his voice. I wasn’t the only one nearing combustion. He was barely holding back—I could tell—his hips were moving against me harder, faster. Then he started to bend me over. His hand left my breast and it cupped the side of my hip. He whispered against the back of my neck, “Hold onto the headboard.”  
  
  Shit.  
  
  “Mason,” I whimpered again. It was too much, but my hands grasped onto the headboard. My fingers curled around it, and I held on. I had no idea how. I was so focused on him, at how he was almost in me now. I could feel him through his boxers. His hand was still between my legs, but he pulled out. Instantly, I ached for him. I was too empty. I groaned in protest. “No …”  
  
  Then he was back. He had switched his angle now; he was firmly behind me. Urging my legs further apart, his fingers began pistoning in and out of me faster than before.  
  
  I was going crazy.  
  
  I needed him, all of him, and I began moving faster, riding his hand at the same time.  
  
  “Jeezus,” he grunted over me, his mouth next to my ear.  
  
  A delicious shiver rushed through me as his breath caressed my skin.  
  
  “Now,” I cried out, gritting my teeth.  
  
  His fingers kept ramming into me, sliding back and forth, going deeper until I wasn’t sure they could go any deeper.  
  
  “Mason.” I was panting now. Goddamn. “Please.”  
  
  A deep guttural groan was my answer and his hand left me. His boxers were shoved down and in one smooth movement, he thrust deep inside of me.  
  
  Finally.  
  
  I closed my eyes and welcomed the heat. He was home now. We moved together, knowing each other’s bodies so well. Turning my head to the side, his lips were there and they opened for me. I needed him. Sweeping my tongue against his lips, I tasted what was mine. He was mine. All of him was mine.  
  
  Bent over me, he held me anchored in place with a hand gripping my hip, but his other reached under me and took a firm hold of my breast. His thumb rubbed against my nipple. Shit. I gasped, pushing back into him so he’d go harder.  
  
  “Sam,” he whispered against my lips.  
  
  I needed him to go faster. I couldn’t handle it anymore and began to rock against him faster and faster.  
  
  “Shit,” he gasped now, but he straightened. Both of his hands held onto my hips and he slammed into me, pushing me into the headboard now. I didn’t care. My face was to the side now and I was gasping for breath. Some of my hair had fallen into my face so I couldn’t see. The strands dipped into my mouth, but Mason moved them. They were tucked behind my ear and I was gasping for breath. He kept thrusting into me.  
  
  I was nearing.  
  
  I could feel it.  
  
  “Mason.” A low groan came from the bottom of my throat.  
  
  I was right there.  
  
  Then, as his hands dug into my hips one last time, he emptied into me. I was right with him. My body shot over the edge and trembled as the waves rocked over me. He collapsed on my back and chuckled. His hand skimmed past my hip and he pushed off from the headboard. As our skin separated, he grunted.  
  
  I couldn’t move. I hung onto the headboard, panting for breath. My body was still trembling as the waves kept coming.  
  
  “You okay?”  
  
  I shook my head. I couldn’t even attempt to speak. I’d been weakened by that climax, but then he slid a hand in front of me and I was lifted into the air. Curling into him, my arms wound around his neck and my legs wrapped around his waist. His hands gripped my ass now as he moved from the bed. Mason carried me to the bathroom and tested the water before he stepped underneath. I hung onto him, clinging like a monkey as he washed his hair and then mine. When his fingers started to massage my scalp and he rinsed the shampoo from my hair, I closed my eyes. I enjoyed every last minute of his attention.  
  
  I loved him.  
  
  A feeling of contentment swept over me, and I could’ve hung onto him until next week. However, after washing both of us, he moved me back to the counter and I unhooked myself, giving him a rueful grin as he tossed me a towel. When he started to dry himself off, I didn’t do a thing. I just watched. My eyes drank in the sight of him.  
  
  Broad shoulders. Every muscle defined, all the way down to his abdominals and obliques. Even the muscles in his legs bulged and shifted as he bent low to dry the rest of him. A trim waist. Angular cheekbones. Luscious eyelashes that covered his emerald eyes and lips th  
at a girl would die for. Not me. I just died to touch them and feel them against mine.  
  
  I let out a deep breath. I was addicted to him.  
  
  He grinned as his eyes darkened. He knew exactly what I was thinking or feeling. He asked, “Are you going to get ready?”  
  
  “Sure. When my legs can work again. What was that?”  
  
  “That,” he moved closer, pulling the towel from me, “was the best way to start my last semester.”  
  
  I flinched as if a cold bucket of water was dumped on me. Those words left me cold. Plucking the towel from him, I hopped off the counter and shoved past him to the bedroom.  
  
  “What’s wrong?” He followed me.  
  
  “That was the best way to start your last semester?” I dried myself off and stopped to glare at him. Seriously? He was an idiot. “Screw you.”  
  
  The corner of his mouth curved up. “You just did.”  
  
  “Not funny, Mason.”  
  
  He frowned and narrowed his eyes at me. “What’s wrong?”  
  
  “You’re leaving.”  
  
  “Just to college. I’m not going forever.”  
  
  I rolled my eyes and turned my back. Says you, you big ass. Just to college. It’s not that simple.  
  
  “Wait, are you really mad at me?”  
  
  Ignoring him, I grabbed some underwear, jeans, a bra and a shirt. Stopping once, I glanced in the mirror to make sure I looked presentable—I’d do. My dark hair hadn’t been cut so it fell below my shoulders. I’d twist it up in a braid later, but the jeans and shirt were snug. Good. I didn’t care if every inch of me was on display. The jeans were washed out, but clung to me and my shirt was a simple long-sleeve white shirt. The front dipped low, giving a good view of my cleavage, and my black lace bra showed through the thin material, but I didn’t care. Mason was just going to college, my ass. Still ignoring him, I grabbed my backpack and purse. Stuffing the purse inside of the bag, I brushed past him and headed downstairs. As I got into the kitchen, Logan was just putting the coffee pot back on the burner. He turned and stopped. Seeing me when I entered, his eyes went wide and a low wolf whistle came next.  
  
  “You’re smoking, Sam.” He gave me a wicked grin. “Mason must’ve pissed you off, huh?”  
  
  “I know I look pissed.”  
  
  “Nah.” He shook his head, his brown locks had been gelled to perfection. “You’re smoking hot. I know you’re mad because you got that cold as ice look in your eye you always get when you are, but that’s not what I meant. You only come out looking hot as hell when my big bro’s pissed you off.” Checking his watch, he whistled again. “That was fast because I just heard you two going at it like wild animals.”  
  
  Oh. Jeezus. Flushing, I ignored his comments and gestured to the coffee pot. “Are you going to start that?”  
  
  “Nope. It doesn’t work.”  
  
  This morning went from great to crap. “Oh.”  
  
  Grabbing his keys, Logan dangled them at me. “But if we leave now, we can stop at The Quickie. I need to get gas anyway.”  
  
  “Sold.”  
  
  Mason was coming down the stairs as we moved past them. He was pulling his shirt down, and I tried not to watch the movement of his abdominals or how his jeans rode low on his narrow hips. He paused when he saw us. “Where are you guys going?”  
  
  My lips were pressed tight together, and Logan smirked from behind me. He shook his head. “Whatever you said must’ve been good. You pissed your woman off. Not a good move, not on the first day of the semester.”  
  
  Wincing at how close his words hit the target, I gritted my teeth and shoved out the door.  
  
  Mason called after me, “Sam.”  
  
  “What?”  
  
  He looked ready to say something else, glanced at Logan and closed his mouth.  
  
  It didn’t matter. I didn’t want to hear it. “The coffee pot’s broken. I’m going with Logan to get some. Did you want some too? I can serve it to you, another thing to add to the ‘best way to start your last semester.’” A ball of anger rolled over me.  
  
  “Come on …” An apology flashed in those emerald eyes of his.  
  
  “You said that?” Logan chuckled. “Dumb move, dipshit.”  
  
  Moving closer to the door, Mason flashed a warning at his brother. “Give us a minute.”  
  
  “What if I don’t?”  
  
  He bared his teeth at him. “Not a request, dipshit.” Then he shoved him and stepped closer to me. His hand fell to my arm, but he added to Logan, “March. I’ll bring her.”  
  
  Logan smirked at him. “We’re going for coffee. Besides,” he gestured inside the house, “you’ve gotta wait for your other girlfriend. His car’s still blocked in from the party last night.”  
  
  “People are still here? Where is he?”  
  
  He shrugged. “Nah, they all got rides home, but their cars are still here, and as for your girlfriend, I have no idea. Check his room. I think I heard Parker down there.”  
  
  “Parker?”  
  
  “Yeah. Pretty sure I heard her voice from downstairs. I was headed down to see if he knew how to fix the coffee pot.”  
  
  Mason cursed under his breath and twisted around. His hand fell from my arm. “He agreed to the exile.”  
  
  “Guess it starts later today for him.”  
  
  “Not helping.”  
  
  “Not trying to,” Logan sniped back.  
  
  “What is your problem?”  
  
  “With you? Nothing. With your other girlfriend, figure it out.” Logan’s eyes darkened, letting his anger show.  
  
  I held my breath. There hadn’t been a lot of times when the two bickered, but I could tell that Logan was fed up. Not that I could hold it against him. I was getting fed up as well, but I knew that Mason hadn’t let his friendship with his best friend affect our relationship. Not yet. As the two glared at each other, I stepped in between them. Softening my tone, I gestured to Logan’s Escalade. “Let’s go and get coffee.”  
  
  Logan turned on his heel, his jaw rigid as he went to his vehicle.  
  
  Mason caught my wrist and held me back. “Are we okay?”  
  
  “Yeah,” I sighed. I had already melted as soon as I saw his regret earlier. “It just sucks, Mason. You’re leaving. You. Leaving. As in you’re not going to be here on a daily basis anymore. I’m not the only one bothered by that.” I jerked my head over my shoulder, where Logan had started the car and was waiting for me.  
  
  “That’s not Nate’s fault.”  
  
  “No, but it’s not the three of us or even the two of you anymore. Nate came back. This is Logan’s last semester with you, but …” I gestured inside. “Your best friend gets you for the next four years, you know. You’re leaving early for football.”  
  
  He groaned and his head fell back. “Shit, I didn’t even think of it that way.”  
  
  I shrugged. “Anyway, I really want to get some coffee, and I have to talk to my coach. He said to come by his office this morning.”  
  
  Mason’s head lifted back up and he grinned, his eyes darkening as he tugged me close. “Coach Grath is lucky to have you. He knows that.”  
  
  I was about say thanks, but then I stopped thinking. He bent closer to me. Closing my eyes, I felt his lips softly touch mine. One damn touch was all it took. A tingle began and the lust for him sparked again. I became heated as he deepened the kiss, and I burrowed closer to him.  
  
  BEEEEEP!  
  
  Jerking back, I twisted and glared at Logan, who still had his hand on the horn. He flashed me a grin, but hollered out the window, “Let’s go! You can screw later.”  
  
  “Idiot,” Mason muttered under his breath.  
  
  “He’s right. Go see Nate, see what’s going on. I’ll see you at school.”  
  
  He nodded, but flipped off his brother. Logan’s laugh was heard clearly and I gave Mason a quick wave as I got into the yellow Escalade.  
  
  Reversing the vehicle, Logan extended his middle finger in the rearview mirror and gunned the engine. He didn’t pause when we got  to the road. Clicking my seatbelt in place, I settled back in my seat. Logan liked to drive fast, but he had the reflexes to keep us safe, so I wasn’t worried. I did comment, “All you had to do was say something to him, you know. Mason’s a good brother to you.”  
  
  He jerked in his seat. His face grim. “Yeah, well, it’s easy for you to say. You’re supposed to talk to him. You don’t come across as bitching and whining.”  
  
  “I said something.”  
  
  “No.”  
  
  “Yes.” It was getting ridiculous. “You used to be friends with Nate.”  
  
  “That was before he turned shady. I know he had Parker over last night.”  
  
  “You said this morning.”  
  
  “Last night. This morning. What’s the difference? He still violated the exile. Mase won’t forget that.”  
  
  I heard the anger in his voice. It was low and underlining. Frowning, I asked, “Are you mad at Nate about something else? I thought it was just because he came back for his last semester.”  
  
  Logan jerked a shoulder up, holding the steering wheel with one hand. “What does it matter? He’s so far up Mason’s ass, I’m surprised my dipshit brother could even hear you.”  
  
  “Logan.”  
  
  “It’s true.” But his voice lost some of the aggression. “Nate’s not the same. Mason needs to know that.”  
  
  “So just tell him.”  
  
  “Why don’t you tell him?” he shot back, throwing me a sidelong glance.  
  
  “Maybe I will.”  
  
  Rolling his eyes, he looked back to the street. “Mase won’t listen to you.”  
  
  “Yes, he will.”  
  
  “No, he won’t.”  
  
  “Mason’s always listened to me.”  
  
  “Things are going to go to shit. I know it.”  
  
  I frowned, but the knot tightened again in my gut. As Logan turned into The Quickie, I agreed with him. This semester wasn’t going to be an easy one.  
  
  For anybody.  
  
  When Logan turned into the gas station, I laughed when I saw who was sitting on the bench outside of Quickie’s—Jeff. When we got out, a quick grin came over him and he stood up. His hands were pushed deep into his pants pockets and he rolled his shoulders back. His dark hair had been gelled, much the same as Logan’s, and as he came closer, I saw the idol worship he had for the younger Kade.  
  
  “Hey.”  
  
  Logan narrowed his eyes at him, but I asked, “What are you doing here?”  
  
  He jerked a shoulder up. “My car broke down.”  
  
  I glanced at his phone. “Who were you going to call for a ride?”  
  
  “Not that girl I was telling you about on Friday. She hooked up with this guy Saturday.” He gestured to Logan, who had started to reach for the gas nozzle.  
  
  “Me?”  
  
  “Yeah.” Jeff lifted a corner of his mouth up. “No worries. I’m not heartbroken. At least I know what she’s like now.”  
  
  He looked ready to say more, but Logan interrupted after he started the gas, “I’m going in. You want your coffee?”  
  
  I nodded. “Thanks.”  
  
  As he went inside, Jeff laughed to himself. “Man, I forgot how scary—” He stopped suddenly. His eyes darted past my shoulder and widened. I turned to see Mason’s black Escalade pulling into the lot. He parked next to us, on the other side of the gas pump, and hopped out. When he came around, Jeff put a few feet between us. “Hey, man. How’s it going?” His voice sounded strangled as he jerked a hand up and grabbed a fistful of his hair, making it spike even more.  
  
  Mason reached for the nozzle, but turned to me. “Logan’s inside?”  
  
  I nodded. “Where’s Nate?”  
  
  The corner of his mouth dipped down into a brief scowl. It was so quick—there and gone in the blink of an eye—but I caught it. No one else would’ve noticed it. That wasn’t good. A knot tightened in my gut. “Did he have company?”  
  
  “No, but he did last night.” Mason’s tone was cold. I knew it wasn’t because of me.  
  
  “Uh,” Jeff’s hand tightened on his hair, and he tried to give me a halfhearted grin. His other hand shoved down in his front jean pocket, and his shoulders hunched forward. “Maybe I should get going …”  
  
  “Did you call someone for a ride?”  
  
  Jeff’s eyes darted back to Mason.  
  
  Even though he was filling his vehicle with gas and his back was turned to us, I knew he was listening. He was waiting for Jeff to leave.  
  
  “Did you?”  
  
  “Not yet, but since you’re here …” His voice trailed off again. “Oh shit.”  
  
  Two car doors slammed shut, but it wasn’t the sound of them or the alarm that flitted over Jeff’s face that sent alarms off in me.  
  
  It was Mason.  
  
  He wasn’t moving. An unnatural stillness had come over him. His hand fell from the nozzle, and he stopped everything for a second. It was a small pause as he took a breath. It lasted only a second. Then his hand reached over and he flipped up the handle so the gas stopped. The nozzle was left in his vehicle as he walked forward.  
  
  Then I saw them.  
  
  Brett and Budd Broudou. They had gotten out of their car and one yelled inside it, “Hurry up, Shannon. We’ve only got twenty minutes and you’re going to make us late.”  
  
  She climbed out from the back seat, straightening her skirt so her ass didn’t hang out. “Shut up, Brett. I’ll take my time if I want to.”  
  
  “No, you won’t,” Budd interjected. “Not unless you want to call for your own ride. You better piss here too. We’re not stopping.”  
  
  Her lips clamped shut, but if looks could kill.  
  
  Her older brother didn’t care. He gave her a look of death right back. “Bitch.”  
  
  “Screw you.” Jerking forward, she tried to hurry inside but stopped and slowed to a casual walk. Her shirt had ridden up, showing a good dose of skin, including the top of her butt crack. Muttering under her breath, she reached up and pulled it back down. As both her brothers started laughing, she turned towards them, but stopped when she caught sight of us.  
  
  Mason was in front of his vehicle, a human wall between them and me. I knew he had done it on purpose, but I was surprised when Jeff took two steps and positioned himself in the same manner. He was facing them squarely with me right behind him.  
  
  I scooted to see what was going on, but Jeff moved with me. When I went to the right, he went to the right. “Stop. He doesn’t want them to see you.”  
  
  I started to protest, but remembered how Heather had acted when they were at Manny’s. She’d been terrified. Heeding all of their warnings, I stayed put. If Budd recognized me from that night, he’d say something and that was still a conversation I needed to have with Mason.  
  
  Then Logan came out of the gas station. He had two coffees in hand with his head down, clueless of the Broudou brothers as he crossed the lot. There still hadn’t been a word spoken between the brothers and Mason. Yet.  
  
  It was coming.  
  
  A shiver went down my spine.  
  
  Slipping my hand inside my pocket, I made sure my phone was there and pulled it out. If they made one violent move, I was calling 911. I wasn’t going to risk them being hurt. Mason’s future had already been threatened by Analise. It wasn’t going to be threatened again.  
  
  Then it happened.  
  
  I gulped as I watched it in slow motion. Logan stepped forward, he frowned, and then lifted his head. His eyes found me first. He paused. His foot came down hard in mid-step and he glanced around. He saw Mason before he trailed his head where they were.  
  
  It was as if they’d been waiting for him to join.  
  
  Everything happened then, at the same time.  
  
  Shannon’s features scrunched together in an ugly snarl. Her hands found her heavier hips and her arms pinched the sides of her breasts, making them rise from the motion. It was then when her brothers saw us too.  
  
  I jerked forward.  
  
  Mason shifted in front of his car, and Logan disappeared from my eyesight. I moved to see better, but Jeff moved with me, obscuring my view.  
  
  “Stop.” I  
tried to push him aside.  
  
  He remained facing them, but his hand went behind him to touch my arm. “Get in the car, Sam.”  
  
  “No.”  
  
  He hissed, “Get in the car! Now.”  
  
  “No.”  
  
  They weren’t going to do anything to them. They couldn’t. Terror started to rise up, and the hair on the back of my neck stood up.  
  
  They couldn’t hurt Mason or Logan.  
  
  Then a low baritone spoke up, “Kade.”  
  
  The other one added, “Shannon, go inside and get your coffee.”  
  
  “No!” she hissed. “I’m staying, Brett.”  
  
  “What are you doing here, Budd?” Mason asked. I closed my eyes, falling against Logan’s Escalade. He sounded in control, amused even, and a wave of relief went through me at the sound. That meant he was fully in control of the situation. “Quickie’s is in Fallen Crest territory. Not Roussou.”  
  
  “Sam,” Jeff twisted around, his cheeks flushed from insistence. “Get inside.”  
  
  “Who’s that over there?”  
  
  I held my breath, and Jeff froze.  
  
  That was Budd speaking.  
  
  “What are you talking about?” Logan tried to sound casual.  
  
  One of them, probably Budd, snorted. “You’re hiding someone. I heard you have a girlfriend, Mason. That true?”  
  
  “Is that her back there?” Brett added.  
  
  “You never answered my question.” Mason’s tone went cold as ice. “What are you doing here?”  
  
  A shrill, but cocky laugh came from them. “We don’t live far from your butt-buddy’s home. Remember? Quickie’s is on the way to Roussou.”  
  
  “That’s right.” Soft gravel was smashed down. Mason must’ve taken a step forward. His tone was full of quiet authority. “You have a farm a few miles away.”  
  
  Logan let loose with a swift curse. “Forget that. This is Fallen Crest. What are you doing coming to this gas station?”  
  
  “Fuck off, Kade.”  
  
  Mason spoke again, a lethal note in his voice, “This is our town. You’re not welcome here.”  
  
  “Last time you came around here, your cars exploded. Are you back for round two?”  
  
  I shook my head. That was enough; I had to see. I pushed forward, but Jeff caught me. His arms came around me, and he opened the door before lifting me inside.  
  
  “Jeff!”  
  
  “Stop.” The serious warning in his voice made me pause. I hadn’t heard that from him, not in a long time, and my eyes widened. There was a grave note in his usually jovial brown depths. They were as flat as the scowl that hadn’t lifted from his face. His hand went and caught his hair, grabbing chunks of it again. “Just stop, Sam. Stay here.”  
  
  I didn’t say a word as he shut the door and then started forward. His hands went into his pockets and his skinny shoulders hunched down. I knew it was his ‘I’m serious’ walk. It used to excite me during the first year we dated, but it wasn’t amusing anymore. My mouth went dry, and I sat back in the seat.  
  
  Jeff was serious. Jeff was never serious.  
  
  Through the car, I heard Mason’s muffled voice. “Take your sister and leave.”  
  
  Someone snorted. “Who’s in the car?”  
  
  “Leave.”  
  
  “Tsk, tsk, Mason. Your little bro is showing his cards. He must care for her as much as you do.” The voice grew louder as if he’d stepped closer. “Come on, just between you and me. Your little bro loves her, too, doesn’t he? At least, that’s what I’ve heard.”  
  
  Then there was silence. I had stopped breathing and clung to the car’s upholstery. My fingers dug into the seat, and I couldn’t move. It was like a nightmare coming to life. Then I heard a scream. That was it. Flinging open the door, I rushed out. Jeff caught me in the air. “Come on, Sam.”  
  
  I heard another scream followed by a car’s brakes and then a thud. Someone was on the ground. I knew it. “Let me go.” I dug my nails into his arm.  
  
  “No.” He cursed, flinching as I drew blood. “They left me to watch you. Stop it.”  
  
  I dug harder, hard enough that he cried out in pain, and I was dropped. Scrambling up, I burst around Logan’s car. Then I heaved to a stop. Mason and Logan were a united front, but Nate was there, too. All three stood next to each other, another human wall.  
  
  Someone was on the ground, and the girl cried out again, “Pick him up, Brett! You’re so damn slow.”  
  
  “Shut up, Shannon. Open the door.”  
  
  The body was hoisted from the ground, but I couldn’t see who it was anymore. A car door was slammed shut, then two more followed it. The car reversed and sped off as dirt kicked up from the tires. There was five seconds of silence before Logan threw his head back and howled in laughter. He clapped Nate on the shoulder. “I can’t believe you did that.”  
  
  Nate’s shoulder tensed under his hand, but he shrugged. “Trying to make up. I’ve recently learned that I’ve been a dick lately.”  
  
  “You have.” Logan kept chuckling, turning to see me. “You missed it, Sam. Nate clipped Budd Broudou with his car.”  
  
  Mason’s eyes narrowed at Nate. “What were you going to do? You hopped out of your car like you were going to take a bat to him.”  
  
  Nate shrugged again. A brief glimmer of regret crossed his face, but it was gone instantly. “I needed to make sure he stayed down … and to make sure that I won’t get sued.”  
  
  “He’s down now. Don’t worry, you just clipped him. Budd’s a cockroach. They think a lawsuit is a pansy way to deal with a fight.” Logan’s hand was still on him, and he used it to push up from the ground in a semi-skip. His eyes sparked from giddiness. Before I knew what he was doing, he had rushed over to me, and I was thrown over his shoulder. “That was awesome, Sam. I can’t believe you missed that. Shit. I’m horny.”  
  
  “On that note.” An arm slid underneath my waist and I was lifted from him. Mason slid me down his body and kept his arms around me. I wasn’t inclined to leave his shelter. He spoke near my ear, a deep chuckle in his voice, “I’ll be taking Sam with me to school.”  
  
  “Whatever.” Logan’s grin widened. “I’m off then. Got something to do.” He darted to his Escalade, stopping once to punch Jeff in the arm before he climbed in and took off.  
  
  “Ow! That hurt. Oh, Sam. Hey …”  
  
  I knew what he was going to ask and started to answer, but Mason beat me to it. “We’ll give you a ride.”  
  
  Jeff flashed a bright smile quickly before the stoic mask of coolness slid back into place. I shook my head. This would be interesting. Mason didn’t wait around. He got into the front and I climbed into the passenger seat. Jeff got into the back. No one said a word as he turned onto the road leading to Fallen Crest Academy.  
  
  The irony didn’t escape me—my boyfriend was driving my ex-boyfriend to my old school. A lot had changed in such a short amount of time.  
  
  “So, um,” Jeff started, leaning forward, “how much does one of these cost, Mason?

There's been a few promotions in my work place (me included) and now Stacy (47F) has taken it upon herself to organize a last minute lunch/dinner for everyone at 2:30 this afternoon. The problem is that I (32F) have to work until 4. She comes up to me, while I'm getting some coffee, and says ""You're really gonna miss a lot if you don't show up.""

Like what can I do? I have bills to pay and I don't even know half of the people she's invited and although I don't care to go, she's gonna make it personal if I don't show up.

I just told Stacy ""I have bills to pay and can't just skip out whenever.""

She's pouting now (setting her coffee mug down loudly and huffing) and idk why it's such a big deal. We tolerate each other and I don't even care to hang out with coworkers.

1lxyxfw,https://www.reddit.com/r/taoism/comments/1lxyxfw/the_chihuahua_at_the_edge_of_the_world/,The Chihuahua at the Edge of the World,"I found her on an island that didn’t appear on any map. No ferry routes. No signs.  
Just sand that remembered footsteps,  
and wind that had no intention of going anywhere else.

She was lying in a hammock strung between two crooked trees,  
a half-melted pistachio-mango ice cream dripping down her wrist.  
A **chihuahua** sat beside her like a bodyguard that believed in reincarnation.

“You’re here,” she said, like she had been expecting me for years.  
Maybe she had.

She wasn’t what I imagined when I thought of **Being**.  
But then again, most things that matter come in the wrong packaging.

She was wearing cheap sunglasses that didn’t fit quite right and an oversized linen shirt, damp with sea air. Her legs swung slightly over the hammock edge, tanned and sandy. Her left ankle had a faint scar—the kind you don’t remember getting but never fully forget.

“You thought I’d be wearing robes?” she asked, reading my face.  
“Something Greek maybe? A little austere?”

I said nothing.

She grinned.  
“I get that a lot.”

We talked.  
Or rather—she talked, and I listened.

She had a voice like tidewater. Slow, rolling, pulling things from me I didn’t know I still carried.

We talked about what people search for, and how often they skip over it in their rush to define it.

“Everyone wants to arrive,” she said.  
“Nobody wants to *be* where they are.”

I offered her the question anyway, the one that had floated just beneath my chest for most of my adult life:

“What’s the point of all this?”

She didn’t roll her eyes.  
She didn’t laugh.  
She just shifted slightly and held the dripping cone out to the chihuahua, who licked it once and looked away like it had tasted this truth before.

Then, very softly, she answered:

“It’s not the big thing.  
Not the golden revelation or the five-year plan.

It’s lying in a hammock between trees you don’t know the names of.

It’s riding a rusted bike through flat, sunlit streets that smell faintly of tomatoes and detergent.

It’s the hole in your sandal that you forget is there until it rains.  
And then, instead of cursing it, you laugh.  
Because it’s been part of you this whole time.”

She paused.

Then added, as if it were an afterthought:

“Also, I may have had a little rum earlier.  
And smoked something with Aristippus.  
But that doesn’t make it less true.”

We fell into a kind of rhythm.  
Not quite conversation. Not quite silence.

She told me stories.

About the first person who ever tried to bottle purpose and sell it in glass vials. About a fox who had once convinced an entire town to follow the stars instead of the road signs. About a woman who disappeared into a painting of a rice field because it looked more real than her life.

None of the stories had endings. She said that was the point.

“The best ones keep leaking into your life,” she said, “like old ink.”

We talked about **the forks in the road**. The real ones.

Like when I decided, without really deciding, to study abroad. Not because it made sense, not because I had savings, but because something inside me whispered *go* like a hand on the small of my back.

I told her about the time I moved to England for a woman I barely knew. About the day we sat by the canal, and she touched my arm mid-sentence, and for a second, everything in me fell quiet.

“Did it work out?” she asked.

“No,” I said.

She nodded.  
“But it mattered.”

I told her about the **accident**. The one with the bicycle. The wet tram tracks. The sharp twist of bone. How I couldn’t write for six weeks. How silence became a second skin. How one morning I cried because I watched a sparrow eat from a coffee saucer someone had left outside their door.

“Pain folds you,” she said, tracing something in the air.  
“But when it unfolds you again, the creases tell a story.”

The sun shifted. The tide sighed.

She stood and walked a few paces toward the water, the hammock swinging slightly behind her. The chihuahua followed at her heels, half-alert.

“You’ll leave soon,” she said.  
“That’s alright. Just… don’t go back the same way you came.”

I asked her if I could come back.

She looked over her shoulder and smiled.

“You always do,” she said.  
“Usually right before you forget something important.”

When I finally stood to go, she placed a hand briefly on my shoulder.

“You’re doing fine,” she said.  
“Just don’t wait until everything makes sense to begin.”

And then, quieter:  
“Take more naps. Stretch in the mornings. Water the plants even when you’re sad. And buy the better socks.”

The chihuahua sneezed.

The trees leaned closer.

First drop was good, but when pulling away the two large tip over and one of the lids comes off spilling all over the floorboard. Did the right thing and went back for a fresh one (it was on the way), let the customer know. On the way, the order just disappears and was given another without any notification (got the cancellation message several hours later). At the drop, contacted support, the customer cancelled and was upset he didn't get his order in time for his lunch, sadly it was stacked, so nothing could have be done and who knows how long it was holding. He didn't even want the food, and to be honest, I didn't want it either.

Next drop was at a coffee bar, asked if they wanted the cancelled order, they said sure, after handoff, you would have thought the staff won the lottery. Normally would have given the order someone in need, but I wanted to get rid of these possessed drinks ASAP.

1lxyvwr,https://www.reddit.com/r/interviews/comments/1lxyvwr/its_2025_we_have_ai_writing_job_descriptions_and/,It’s 2025. We have AI writing job descriptions and still can’t mention if an interview is remote or not.,"Job hunting in tech be like:  
📩 “Hey! Loved your profile. Let’s do an interview.”  
Me: *Cool cool. Another remote interview.*  
Also me: *Wearing a formal shirt + pajama combo, surrounded by coffee and existential dread.*

Because let’s be real — it’s 2025. I’ve had interviews from:

* Companies 3,000 km away ✅
* A guy in his car ✅
* One where *I was literally ONE FLOOR above their office* and they STILL did it over Google Meet ✅✅

So naturally, I assumed this one’s remote too.

🕐 **Interview day:**  
I’m posted at my desk. Notes open. Ring light ON. Brain half-working. Ready for the link.

📞 **30 minutes before interview:**  
**Tech Lead:** “Hey, where have you reached?”  
**Me:** “Mentally? Or spiritually?”  
**Tech Lead:** “No no, I mean for the in-person interview.”

Me: 😐🧍

I say something professional like, “Ohh! I didn’t know. No worries, we can reschedule!”  
(*Internally screaming in ‘please let this be a bad dream’*)

We reschedule for *later that day.* I STILL think it’s going to be online now, obviously.

⏰ Few hours pass. I ping him:  
**Me:** “Hey! Where’s the interview happening?”  
**Him:** “I’ll send the address in a bit.”  
📍Address drops.  
📍It’s in **Bangalore**.

I’m in **Mumbai.**  
*At this point I’m not even surprised, just disappointed in all my life assumptions.*

**Moral of the story (a.k.a Things Recruiters Should Never “Forget” to Mention):**  
✅ Work Location  
✅ Mode (Remote / Hybrid / In-Office / Telepathic)  
✅ If the role expects me to *relocate* or *respawn in another city*

Because this isn’t “extra” info — it’s the *bare minimum*.

We keep hearing:

* “Candidates should be professional.”
* “Respect the interviewer’s time.” Cool. Now let’s try: 🎯 *“Recruiters should communicate like it's not a secret mission.”*

Because assuming stuff in hiring leads to:  
⛔ Ghost interviews  
⛔ City mismatch  
⛔ A sudden need to teleport across the country

🔻 **TL;DR:**  
Tech lead set up an interview. Never said if it was in-person.  
I assumed remote (like every other one lately — including the one where I was ONE FLOOR above).  
30 mins before: “Where have you reached?”  
Plot twist: The interview is in *Bangalore*.  
I’m chilling in *Mumbai*.

Soo happy to have the entire weekend to myself! I’ve no set plans but who cares!? Up and oob early this morning as I’m unable to sleep in.. Sigh, I wish I could sleep in! Just not happening. I’ll take a Finny out this morning.. trip to the fruit stand on 5th. Finkin’ navel oranges, strawberries and perhaps papaya this morning. Cold because it’s so hot out. I’ll cut/section and stick it in the freezer first. 🤗 Eggs 🍳 too, cause I need more protein.. Thst and because I want to use my 1/2 dozen egg crates from Anthropologie. I have two I never use, but I’ve brought them into the kitchen last week and can’t wait to fill them. Holy moly, I think there are everything whole wheat bagel in the freezer, and 2 unopened containers of Philadelphia scallion cream cheese I’m hoping are still good. 😊 

Sooo I was looking for salmon recipes because I can’t stand pan fried salmon, which is how I’ve been making it in the past.. 🙄 I don’t know how I managed to turn a gorgeous piece of salmon into rubber, but trust me, left alone to my own devices I can do it! Ugh… 😑  So I found a nice looking recipe that calls for coconut milk and lime 🍋‍🟩 It’s giving me Thai vibes, and I’m here for it. Really Looking forward to this recipe.. I’ll report back afterwards ☺️ After the fruit stand, we’ll drop by Union Market for a few fillets and fresh 🌿 herbs. 

You know I’m an iced coffee kinda gal, but I normally like my first cuppa of the morning to be hot. I have so many Nespresso pods… like I’ve been hoarding them. But I finished off my favorites, I’m now left with the ones I’m not too crazy about. I don’t want to waste them, they’re pricey! So I’m using the expert mode on the machine and turning my not so favorites into espresso and having them over ice, which is so gorgeous and 🥰 lovely. Happy to be able to pull a shorter cup from each pod, you just double tap the button and the machine will then turn  the pod into a shorter pull, much like an espresso ☕️ shot. I’m going to make an iced oat milk shaken espresso the next time. Like the Starbucks oat milk shaken espresso, can create it at home. I’ve done it many times, super easy, and so good. 

I have the 🪟 widows in my bedroom all the way open rn. The weather is fair, not too hot right now, in the 70s.. I’ve been reluctant to leave them wide open since I came home one day to find a dirty city pigeon on the inside window sill, but I think it’s safe now while I’m actually home to leave them attended. 

Anyway, hoping you guys are having a good morning ☀️ so far. 🌞 Tootles! ",1,1752322088.0,ghostposter,2,1.0,False

It used to be tents onky until our daughter arrived and then it was cabins. After my wife passed I couldnt bear returning to our old campground. That was about 6 years ago. Im sitting here sipping coffee while my now 10yo daughter is sleeping. Im here, in a cabin at a different campground. Looking out the window w tears in my eyes, thinking about this awesome trip coming to an end. Imagining my wife here...not sitting still ..sweeping up...wiping things down...doin all the things ill tip the housekeepers to do in a few hours. I dont want to leave and say goodbye to another great thing that ebtered our lives.... this trip, but I knew today would come. Silly I know but loss is so evident to me now in all areas of life. 

We go on fun vacations knowing they will end...
We create amazing sand castles with our kids knowing they will crumble when the tide rises...
We make friends knowing one day we will part...
We get married knowing one of the two will pass before the other...
We adopt pets knowing we will likely outlive them...

Yet when all these things come to pass....even when we know the future outcomes in that all these things will expire, we choose them and often choose to repeat them again and again. Why? Not because we look forward to the loss...the grief of parting with that which we find joy in... but we seek these things because of the joy and rewarding feelings. During all good moments in our life we are making ""deposits"" into our emotional bank account so that when the day comes and we have to part and make that ""withdrawal"" we can draw upon all the happiness we were blessed with. 

You cant feel grief without having joy first.  Draw back on those moments you had that cannot be taken. We cry when thinking of them often placing our focus on the fact that we can never make more good memories with who or what we lost when we should shift and remember that noone can take those memories we were blessed to have made. Would any of us grieving go back in time to the moment before the one we lost entered our life and change things so we never met them, thus avoiding future pain? No. I only had 10 years with my wife before she passed and now ill have a lifetime of grief, yet, i wouldnt sacrifice those 10 years for anything. If an angel had told me the day before we met, ""tomorrow youll fall in love but in 10 years it will be town from you and youll have the worst grief imaginable"" I still would take her on that 1st date.

You lived creating those memories...depositing them into your emotional bank account. Now you will find ways to luve off of the interest. Your life with that loved one changed you .  molded you... prepared you for today. Its not easy but you know what would be worse? If you never had them to begin with. True grief isnt just losing someone, its never having them to begin with.

People ask how do I do it and my answer is always, ""I dont. God does"". I think without my faith I could handle one or maybe 2 losses in life, but loss comes daily. It might be losing our favorite car...moving to a new home...or even a rainy day ruining plans.... I face loss more often than I used to think and without my faith Id be lost myself. This isnt a religious post. Its me sitting alone.... noone to talk to other than Him... and just missing her. Im blessed to have today but im so, so grateful now for yesterday. So many people want to know the future but for me my past has been so good too. Heres to praying today can draw close to it.",2,1752321925.0,GriefSupport,0,1.0,False

Whatever happened in the past three years, bury it and forget it, got it? Don't think being the daughter of duke's estate means someone's going to back you up!""

""There never was anyone before, and there sure won't be in the future."" Athena Monson's face was expressionless, her voice hollow. She nodded meekly, not daring to defy the steward.

Leaning against the wall for support, she slowly made her way out of the camp.

She had once lit up Pidence City with her dazzling dance. Now her knees, ruined from years of injury, could barely hold her weight. Without medicine, even her skill in healing was useless.

Just outside the camp, she heard someone call her name. Flinching, she lifted her head hesitantly.

What met her eyes was a majestic steed, a royal gift, and astride it sat the Marquis of Somers—Michael Osborne. The famed war god himself.

He sat tall and poised, broad shoulders tapering to a lean waist, his face strikingly handsome. He still carried that same air of noble elegance.

This was the man she had loved for three long years. She had seen this scene in her dreams countless times—him finally coming to take her home.

Her eyes filled with tears, and she opened her mouth to speak, but no words came.

Because it was him—he was the one who had thrown her into this hellish camp, ordering others to ""teach her a lesson.""

The cold indifference in his eyes made her already shattered heart tremble again.

""I can take you home,"" Michael said, looking down at her from his horse, eyes like ice, his tone as sharp as a blade. ""But tell me—do you finally admit you were wrong?

""If you hadn't poisoned the pastries back then, Willow wouldn't be living with a chronic illness. She still needs daily medicine. You only suffered three years of punishment—she'll suffer for the rest of her life. You owe her forever!""

When Athena remained silent, Michael snapped, ""Answer me! Do you admit your guilt?""

The sudden sharpness in his voice made her jump. Reflexively, she shut her eyes, wrapped her arms around her head, and crouched down, crying out, ""I admit it! I was wrong! I'll never do it again!""

But the lash she expected never came. Only then did she remember—he was the Marquis of Somers. A man like him would never lower himself to beat someone like her.

Still, she truly had been wrong. She was wrong to care. Wrong to love. Wrong to give her heart to people who treated it like nothing.

When she'd first been thrown into the camp, she still clung to a shred of hope.

She had thought, 'My fiancé can't really be that heartless. He has protected me since our engagement—risking his life, even, to spare me from harm.

'And my parents in the duke's estate—surely, they would come for me. I have been framed.'

But she waited. And waited. And what came instead was nothing but torment—merciless, day after day, at the hands of the soldiers.

She was a noblewoman, not a camp whore. They didn't dare touch her, which only made them more creative in how they broke her.

Sometimes, they beat her with slender whips made specifically for disciplining women—tools that cut deep and left her flesh in tatters. Other times, they stripped her naked and tossed her into the snow.

They were waiting for her to beg. To give in. To offer her body in exchange for a bite of food or a few days of peace.

But she never did. So their torment grew nastier, more degrading, every time.

Eventually, she stopped fighting back—not out of obedience, but because she no longer had the strength to resist.

""Athena, what game are you playing now?"" Michael frowned, his tone sharp with disdain.

He wondered, 'Three years of discipline, and she's ended up this pathetic?'

The once-glowing beauty of her face was gone—now it was sickly pale and hollow. Her waist, once soft and full, had thinned so much it looked like it might snap under a strong breeze.

He thought, 'Trying to act pitiful? I am not falling for it. I personally ordered my men to take good care of her. There is no way she's truly been mistreated.'

Turning away, Michael dismounted. He reached out a hand toward her. ""Get in the carriage.""

But she recoiled like a wounded animal, clutching her head, eyes blank, voice trembling as she pleaded, ""No… please don't… don't touch me…""

""That's enough,"" he snapped. ""Still pretending to be pitiful?""

His voice turned colder. ""What, is this your way of making me feel guilty?""

Athena slowly came back to herself. Her voice was dry, hoarse. She gave a hollow laugh, laced with self-mockery.

In front of Michael—or her parents—she had never once had the right to feel wronged.

If they'd ever truly felt guilty, they wouldn't have waited until now.

Thirteen years ago, her birth parents finally brought her home to the duke's estate. That was when she found out the truth—she'd been swapped at birth.

The greedy couple who raised her had traded her away and left her to suffer five bitter years.

She'd thought that returning to her real family meant love and acceptance. But what she got instead was coldness.

Her parents and brothers barely looked at her.

Whenever Willow Monson—the girl who'd lived her life—felt sad or neglected, they rushed to comfort her, as if she were the real daughter.

Little by little, Athena was pushed aside.

They constantly reminded her, ""You're the older sister. You should be the mature one. Be patient with Willow. Don't fight. Don't compete.""

Wanting so desperately to belong, Athena did as she was told. She gave way in everything, always stepping aside for Willow.

Three years ago, she even made pastries by hand to try to please her.

But Willow ended up poisoned—vomiting blood.

Their parents were furious. They said Athena's years away had corrupted her to the bone. Said she wasn't worthy of being their daughter.

Egged on by Willow's whispers, they decided to send her away—banished from Pidence City forever.

Even the brothers who once adored her said, ""Willow might've enjoyed your life for over a decade, but she's innocent. How could you use such cruel tactics just to win attention? We don't have a sister as heartless as you!""

No matter how Athena tried to explain, no one believed her. Not once.

The moment Willow shed a tear, the blame fell on Athena.

In the end, it was Michael who stepped in to stop them from sending her away.

But he didn't save her. He simply had her quietly dumped in the military camp—believing that after enough suffering, she'd finally learn her place.

A gust of wind lifted the tangled strands of Athena's hair, revealing her emaciated, unrecognizable face.

Michael scowled. ""Get up. We're going back to the estate.""

Athena tried, but her legs gave out beneath her, and she crumpled to the ground again.

Michael turned back, his eyes flashing cold steel. ""If you'd rather not go back… then drag yourself back into that camp.""

# 2.Chapter 2 Realize Your Mistake?

Athena lowered her gaze, gritted her teeth, and forced herself to stand. She didn't say a word as she clumsily climbed into the carriage, using both hands and knees.

Her legs throbbed with pain, barely able to hold her, and she looked completely wretched.

Michael turned away, refusing to watch. He had assumed three years of punishment would be enough to wear down her spirit, but the moment they met again, she was already trying to play the victim—putting on a show to win his sympathy.

If it hadn't been for that person's orders, he wouldn't have come for her at all.

What baffled him was why someone of such high rank would even notice Athena—let alone give an order about her the moment he returned to Pidence City.

Michael was the first to get out of the carriage. Without a glance back, he instructed his men, ""I have business back at camp. After you drop her off, get rid of the carriage—I don't want to see it again. It's filthy.""

Filthy. The word hit her like a slap. Athena's chest ached with a dull, sinking pain. She sniffed quietly, face devoid of emotion, and stepped down from the carriage.

Outside the towering red gates of the duke's estate, a woman was already waiting. The moment she saw Athena, she rushed over, eyes full of urgency.

But the first thing she said was, ""My sweet daughter, it's been three years. Have you finally realized your mistake?""

""I have,"" Athena replied flatly.

Her mistake had been wanting love too much. This time, she would sever those ties—for good. Just… not yet. Not while Margaret Monson, her grandmother, still needed her care.

Eloise Monson looked at Athena, her daughter—so thin and pale, her eyes distant—and her expression faltered.

Three years of hardship had changed Athena completely. Just one look was enough to make her heart ache.

No matter how deeply Athena had erred, she was still her daughter—still her flesh and blood. And she had clearly paid the price.

""It's good you understand now,"" Eloise said softly. ""You mustn't be so willful again. Come on, get up."" She reached out to help.

But Athena immediately stood up on her own and took a step back, putting distance between them. Her eyes were guarded, cautious.

Eloise's heart twisted. ""You blame me for being too harsh? But I did it for your own good—for your future! What mother doesn't want the best for her child?""

Her eyes turned red, her voice trembling with a hint of tears. ""Don't hold it against me…""

Her face was full of sorrow, as though she were the one who'd suffered for three years.

Athena stood there, unmoved, making no effort to bridge the gap between them.

Just then, a slender figure stepped gracefully out of the manor and gently supported Eloise's arm.

""Mother, Athena's just come home. She's probably overwhelmed. Don't be upset if she seems distant—give her a little time, all right?""

The girl was delicate and fair, with porcelain skin and a sweet, innocent smile.

She turned to Athena and extended her hand, her eyes wide with sincerity. ""Athena, I don't hold anything against you. Let's forget the past, okay? We're still family—we should love each other, just like before.""

Her smile was as gentle and harmless as ever.

Athena almost laughed out loud. After everything she'd endured, she wondered, 'Do they really think a few nice words can just wipe it all away?'

""Love? Between you and me?"" Disgust flickered in her eyes.

That was when someone finally lost patience.

""Willow's already gone out of her way to be kind to you, and you're still acting like this? What's wrong with your attitude?""

Nicolas Monson had just come from court, still in his crimson official robes. He swung off his horse and walked over, clearly irritated.

""You think you're the only one who's suffered these past three years? Do you have any idea what Mother's been through? She's lost sleep night after night, her hair's turning white!

""If it weren't for Willow taking care of her and fulfilling your duties, who knows what would've happened?""

Nicolas had seen the whole scene earlier—Eloise's joy quickly deflated, Willow's soft voice met with Athena's cold rejection.

Nicolas thought, 'And all because of three years of punishment? What right does she have to act wronged? Willow almost died.'

Eloise frowned at Nicolas, her son, clearly disapproving. ""Don't exaggerate. She just got back. As her big brother, you should be gentler with her. Don't scare her.""

""Mother, you don't need to defend her. The Monson family owes her nothing. She's the one who made the mistake. And because of her, our entire household's reputation suffered.

""Everyone in Pidence City knows the Duke's family raised a vicious, manipulative girl. And Willow? She never complained—she's done everything she could to protect this family.""

Nicolas still hadn't calmed down.

""Athena! Willow even covered for you—she told everyone you never poisoned her, just to protect your name. Shouldn't you be grateful?"" he continued.

When Athena said nothing, his voice rose sharply. ""Say something! Are you mute now?""

Athena blinked, struggling to hold back the sting in her eyes.

Once upon a time, Nicolas had been different. Unlike her second and third brothers, he had been the one who truly cared for her.

He once told her he'd split the love he gave Willow and give half to her—and for a while, he meant it.

When the servants looked down on her, he gave out thirty lashes on her behalf. On her birthday, he carved a jewel pendant for her by hand. When she was sick, he stayed by her side through the night.

But all that kindness vanished the moment Willow acted hurt.

Love that could be so easily withdrawn—that kind of love, she no longer wanted.

The air between them turned stiff with silence.

Eloise quickly stepped in to smooth things over. ""What's done is done. Let's go inside—your father and grandmother are still waiting.""

Nicolas scoffed and gave a dismissive wave of his sleeve as he turned toward the estate.

After a few steps, he looked back, his voice suddenly soft. ""Willow, come here.""

""Yes, Nicolas."" She smiled sweetly, casting a glance at Athena. She said nothing—but somehow, it said everything.

Athena was used to it by now. She had always been the outsider in this family.

She had already made up her mind: she would let go. Let Willow have all of it—Michael, her parents, her brothers.

But even with that resolve, watching this unfold still made her throat tighten and her eyes sting.

# 3.Chapter 3 Oversized Clothes

Eloise led Athena through the gates of the estate, turning to the servants as they entered. ""Take Lady Athena to wash up first. After that, she'll go pay her respects to Lady Margaret.""

Then she looked at Athena with a gentle smile. ""Your grandmother's getting on in years. Her health hasn't been great—she's been relying on herbal tonics these past few years. When you see her, be sweet and respectful, and don't bring up anything about the last three years. It'll only upset her.""

Athena nodded quietly.

Margaret had always been the most fair-minded person in the family—but she was too old now to involve herself in household affairs.

Seeing Athena accept her words without protest, Eloise finally relaxed a little.

She continued, testing the waters, ""You're eighteen now—of marriageable age. What happened in the camp... let's not mention it again. If word gets out that you spent the last three years living among soldiers, day and night, people will start talking.

""That kind of gossip could ruin your chances of a good match. I've already come up with an explanation. We'll say you were away recuperating, and now you've just returned.""

Athena's face remained calm. She gave a soft ""Yes,"" then followed the maid assigned to her.

But after a few turns, she realized something was wrong. This wasn't the way to her old courtyard.

She asked, and the maid smiled brightly as she explained, ""Lady Willow has been in poor health for years. The doctor said the trees in your courtyard were too damp and affected her health. So they were all cut down.

""To help her recover, they leveled your courtyard and merged it with hers. They even diverted hot spring water to the new space for her treatment. But don't worry, Lady Eloise had this new courtyard cleaned and prepared for you before your return.""

The maid said it as if it were completely normal, perfectly reasonable.

As if everyone had conveniently forgotten that Athena was the true daughter of the house—while Willow was merely adopted.

The maid led Athena to a small, modest courtyard and pushed the door open. ""You'll be staying here from now on, Lady Athena.""

The space was much smaller than her original quarters, and with no greenery in sight, it looked bare and lifeless.

Two unfamiliar maids stepped forward and bowed. ""Lady Athena.""

Athena didn't recognize either of them. After three years away, most of the household staff had changed.

One had a round face, the other an oval one. Both were attractive and sharp-eyed—clearly selected for looks and cleverness.

""I'm Siena Hotham.""

""I'm Aliza Crofton.""

Together, they echoed, ""Hi, Lady Athena.""

Athena gave a small nod and motioned for them to rise.

Then she asked, ""Where are Thalia and Macy?""

Those had been her personal maids before she was sent away. But once she entered the military camp, all news of them vanished.

The maid smiled and replied, ""Not long after you left, they both got married. I imagine they're living quiet, peaceful lives now—looking after their husbands and raising children.""

Athena nodded. A peaceful life sounded good. Far better than serving others for the rest of your days.

The thought brought a faint sense of ease. She stepped inside.

The table was already set. The meal was generous—four dishes and a soup—but the plates were no bigger than a clenched fist.

She began to eat. One plate of pasta disappeared in just a few bites.

Her brows knit slightly. ""Is there more?""

Siena looked momentarily stunned, then quickly nodded. ""Yes, of course, I'll get it right away.""

Watching her eat so fast, Aliza spoke up gently, ""Lady Athena, please slow down. You'll upset your stomach if you rush like that.""

Athena's fork paused in mid-air. She had nearly forgotten—this wasn't the military camp anymore.

This was the duke's estate. No one here was going to snatch her food. No one would dump kitchen slop onto her plate.

The pasta was fragrant. The dishes were fresh. And the meat—it was real bacon. Not rat. Not snake.

Siena returned with two more plates of pasta.

Athena ate quickly and without grace. There was nothing delicate or refined in her manners—she looked more like a starving beggar than a noble daughter.

Siena opened her mouth several times to speak but held her tongue each time.

After the meal, the servants had already prepared hot water for her bath. Siena and Aliza followed her in. ""Lady Athena, allow us to help you bathe,"" Siena offered politely.

""That won't be necessary. You can leave."" Athena said.

Siena hesitated, clearly unsure.

Aliza added with concern, ""If Lady Eloise finds out, she'll punish us for not serving you properly…""

Athena didn't speak. She simply looked at them—calm, expressionless.

There was no anger in her eyes, no emotion at all. But the chill behind that blank gaze made both girls shiver.

Without another word, they backed out of the room and quietly closed the door behind them.

Only then did Athena step behind the screen and begin undressing.

Her body was gaunt, skin stretched tightly over bone. Her once-fair skin was now covered in bruises—some new, others long faded.

If she hadn't known medicine, she would have died in that place.

After washing, she reached for the fresh clothes laid out on the rack. The fabric was fine—soft, warm, and tailored to fit.

But on her starved frame, the robe hung loose and shapeless, making her look more like a walking skeleton than a noble daughter.

""Lady Athena, Lady Eloise and the Lady Margaret are waiting,"" Aliza reminded her from outside.

Athena nodded and made her way toward Starling House.

In just three years, the duke's estate had changed so much.

She paused at the edge of the pond, lost in thought. ""What happened to the lotuses?"" she asked.

""Lady Willow said there were too many mosquitoes in summer,"" Aliza replied. ""So Lord Nicolas had them all removed.""

Athena thought, 'Of course. Willow—again.' Athena felt a familiar ache in her chest.

When she had first arrived at the estate, she tried so hard to win everyone over.

She had planted those lotuses herself, hoping to make wine from the blossoms and gift it to Nicolas.

He had laughed at her back then. ""You're my sister. There's no need for all that. But if it makes you happy, I'll help you plant them.""

The proud, aloof heir of the house had actually gotten his hands dirty—for her.

At the time, Athena had thought, 'So this is what it feels like to be cherished.'

But now… it was clear. Whatever kindness they'd shown her didn't come close to how they treated Willow. Not even a tenth of it.

She arrived at Margaret's quarters. The room was already full.

Eloise looked toward the door—and frowned. She wondered, 'Why does the robe look so oversized on Athena?'

# 4.Chapter 4 The One To Blame

Before Athena could say a word, Nicolas stepped forward, blocking Margaret's view.

""Athena! Are you doing this on purpose?"" he snapped. ""Three years weren't enough to teach you some manners? Still playing your little games? You've really let me down!""

""I told you to present yourself properly. What are you wearing?"" His expression was full of disapproval, his tone unconsciously laced with the stern authority of a Justice Ministry official.

He looked at her like she was standing trial. ""If you've got complaints, direct them at me. Why come here and put on a show in front of Grandmother? Are you trying to make her feel sorry for you? Do you want to upset her so badly she falls ill?""

Athena almost laughed out loud.

She raised an eyebrow, her smile cool and detached. ""The clothes? Lady Eloise picked them out. What did you expect me to wear—what I came back in from the military camp?""

That shut him up. For a moment, Nicolas was at a loss. She had called Eloise ""Lady Eloise""—not ""Mother.""

Only then did it hit him: ever since Athena returned, she hadn't regarded him as brother once either.

A flicker of unease crept into his chest. The harsh words caught in his throat and never made it out.

His gaze narrowed, a thought nagging at the back of his mind. 'It's only been three years… how did she waste away like this?'

Eloise quickly stepped in to smooth things over. ""That was my oversight. Don't be too hard on Athena.""

Nicolas stepped aside, allowing Athena to enter.

Margaret's eyes lit up the moment she saw her.

""Come here, come,"" she called, voice trembling slightly. ""Let me take a good look at you.""

That warmth, that longing in her eyes—Athena felt her nose sting. She stepped forward and let Margaret take her hands and look her over from head to toe.

""How did you get so thin?"" Margaret pulled her into a hug, holding her tightly, voice choked with emotion. ""My sweet girl… you've suffered. It's all my fault. I'm too old, too useless… I couldn't protect you…""

Athena knew how things had gone. Back then, Margaret had stood by her, even if it meant alienating the rest of the family. Her health had already been fragile.

The fact she'd made it through these years at all was a miracle. If not for the empire's strict laws, no one knew what would've happened…

She wrapped her arms around Margaret, and whispered through a tight throat, ""Grandmother.""

Just one word—and Margaret broke down completely, tears streaming down her face.

Off to the side, Eloise watched the reunion, a pang of bitterness tightening in her chest.

Athena had been home for some time now… and still hadn't called her ""Mother.""

She dabbed at her eyes with a silk handkerchief, playing the part of the grieving parent.

Willow stepped up, gently hugging her. ""Don't be sad, Mother. Athena's home now."" Her voice was soft, comforting, obedient.

Eloise looked down at her beloved Willow and felt deeply comforted.

She nodded, eyes still wet, but a faint smile tugging at her lips. She thought, 'At least Willow understands.'

But just as she started to feel at ease, that smile froze.

Margaret's voice, quivering and confused, rang out, ""What's going on?""

Athena's once delicate fingers were now covered in scars—blackened bruises and jagged welts. When she lifted her sleeve, old knife wounds and fresh burns marred the skin along her arms.

Margaret's gaze faltered. She couldn't bear to look any longer. ""She was sent to do labor… how did she end up like this?""

Eloise looked genuinely shocked. ""These injuries—how did they happen?""

Surrounded by concerned faces, Athena buried the emptiness in her eyes and replied softly, ""They came from the overseers at the camp, of course…""

Gasps rippled through the room. Athena's lips curled into a faint, mocking smile. ""I was there to work, not to be treated like a young lady. Getting beaten was just part of the routine.""

She didn't say more. Even recalling it made her stomach turn.

But her few words had already shaken everyone to the core. They thought, 'Beaten—for three full years. How has she even survived?'

Margaret's hands trembled as she clutched Athena's. ""How could they? How dare they? You're the duke's daughter! That camp was under your fiancé's command—how could anyone there lay a finger on you?""

Athena's smile grew, cold and biting. ""Because someone gave the order.""

Nicolas's face turned red with fury. ""You really are useless. You let them beat you like that and didn't even fight back?""

Athena's voice stayed flat, almost detached. ""Do you think a place like that gave me the right to speak, let alone resist? Being quiet and obedient meant fewer beatings. That's the reality.""

She looked directly at him, that faint smile still on her lips. ""Isn't that what you wanted, Lord Nicolas? For me to behave? To finally be 'taught a lesson'? Well, I've learned it. I'm quiet now. Isn't that what makes you happy?""

Nicolas stared at her in silence.

She was smiling, yes—but it never reached her eyes. She hadn't said a single word of accusation, yet the guilt hit him like a knife to the chest.

His expression began to soften, just as he opened his mouth to speak—when Willow's voice suddenly broke in.

""This is all my fault. I'm the one who should be blamed. If my body weren't so weak—if I hadn't reacted badly to the medicine—Athena never would've been punished.

""I was never meant to belong to this family anyway. Maybe… maybe I should go live in the countryside with my birth parents…""

She dissolved into sobs, her voice quivering with each breath. Tears streamed freely down her face, as if she were the one who had suffered.

Immediately, Eloise rushed to her side, flustered, gently stroking her back. ""There, don't cry, darling. You'll make yourself sick.""

Nicolas jumped in too, alarmed. ""You know how fragile your health is—what are you doing, crying like this? If I'd known, I never would've let you come. Now look what's happened.""

Then he turned, casting a sharp look at Athena. As if to say, ""Why do you have to show those wounds? Now Grandmother is heartbroken, Willow is in tears, and Mother is riddled with guilt.""

Before long, everyone in the room was fussing over Willow—offering her coffee, passing her medicine, soothing her with kind words.

And Athena? She stood there alone, forgotten, as if she were nothing more than a bystander.

But of course… she wasn't a bystander. She was the cause. The reason for their guilt, their worry, their pain. The one to blame.

# 5.Chapter 5 Should Leave You There

Just then, the Duke of Suffield—Henry Monson—walked into the room.

His commanding gaze swept over everyone before lingering for a moment on Athena. Then, turning to Margaret, he bowed respectfully. ""Mother.""

Margaret quickly waved him up. ""No need for that, get up.""

After he rose, Nicolas and Willow both greeted him warmly. ""Father.""

Only Athena, calm and detached, said, ""Duke of Suffield.""

That one phrase froze the air in the room.

Henry frowned, as if he hadn't heard her right. ""What did you call me?""

A hint of anger crept into his expression.

Athena lowered her eyes and repeated softly, ""Duke of Suffield.""

Smack! The sound of the slap echoed through the hall as Athena's head snapped to the side.

""You ungrateful thing. Three years in the camp, and you still haven't learned a single ounce of humility?"" he roared.

He continued, ""Calling me 'Duke of Suffield'—what, you trying to cut ties with the family? If you still don't know your place, go back to the military camp and stay there! We don't need a disgrace like you in this household!""

Eloise rushed forward, throwing her arms around Athena protectively. ""Enough! If you have to hit someone, then hit me!""

Margaret rose to her feet, trembling with fury, and lifted her cane to strike Henry.

Tears streamed down her face as she shouted, ""Do you have any idea what she's been through these past three years? And now, right in front of me, you hit her? You might as well be hitting me!""

She had only just started to mend Athena's wounded heart. And now, with a single slap, he'd torn it wide open again. He was her father. Her biological father.

Margaret tried to fight for her—but her cane never landed. The moment she raised it, servants rushed in and stopped her. She didn't even touch his robes.

Athena stood silently off to the side, watching the chaos unfold, her expression cold and unreadable.

She thought, 'So this is the family that promises never to hurt me again. How absurd.'

Eloise turned in a panic to check Athena's face—but before she could, a sudden cry rang out. It was Willow.

Everyone turned. A thin trail of blood was trickling from her temple.

The room fell dead silent.

Henry's face twisted in alarm as he called out, ""Quick! Call the physician!""

Nicolas's eyes were red, his brows deeply furrowed. He looked like he'd rather have taken the injury himself. He said, ""Why would you rush in like that? What if it scars? She can handle it—she's used to it. But you? You're delicate. You shouldn't be hurt like this…""

Willow's voice was soft and trembling, her eyes filled with tears that clung to her lashes. ""I was just scared Father might get hurt… I didn't even think. I just moved.""

When Willow spoke, Henry's heart ached even more.

Everyone in the room hovered around Willow, fussing over her.

Meanwhile, Athena stood quietly to the side, her cheek visibly swollen—yet no one paid her any attention.

She said nothing. A flicker of cold amusement passed through her eyes.

When Henry slapped her, Eloise didn't even flinch.

But the moment Willow was accidentally hurt, that same ""mother"" had panicked like her life depended on it.

Anyone watching would've thought Willow was her real daughter.

Henry, still full of concern, didn't forget to glare at Athena.

He said, ""If it weren't for you, none of this would've happened. Honestly, we never should've brought you back thirteen years ago. Should've left you where you were.""

Nicolas also gave her a disapproving look—but when he saw the bruise on her face, he hesitated, and swallowed his words.

""Enough. That's enough. All of you, out,"" Margaret said with a headache brewing behind her temples.

""Yes,"" the others responded, withdrawing.

Margaret gently took Athena's hand and began applying medicine to her swollen cheek herself.

She said, ""Athena, don't hold it against your father. He's got a temper. But from now on, I won't let anyone hurt you again.""

Looking into Margaret's loving, weathered eyes, Athena couldn't bring herself to say the sharp words that had been sitting on the tip of her tongue.

""Of course not,"" she replied, forcing a quiet smile.

Margaret sighed. She wanted to say more, but fatigue overtook her. She waved Athena off to rest. ""We'll talk later.""

After helping Margaret lie down, Athena finally returned to her courtyard.

She had barely sat down when a familiar voice called from outside. ""Athena, are you asleep?""

Irritation flickered across Athena's face. She signaled for Siena to open the door.

Eloise stepped inside. Her gaze landed immediately on Athena's swollen cheek. She walked over, her voice gentle. ""Does it still hurt?""

Athena stared at her, silent, as if asking a question without words.

Eloise quickly realized how foolish her concern must have sounded. She hurried to continue, ""Athena, I brought you some wound medicine from Harmony Apothecary. This one's made by a famous physician—it's the best.

""The healer's been missing for three years now. His medicine is nearly impossible to find. Use it sparingly—it'll fade your bruises in less than a month.""

She reached out, tucking a loose strand of Athena's hair behind her ear. ""Athena, I've let you down. I didn't protect you when you needed it. If you're angry, blame me. Just… don't take it out on anyone else.

""From now on, I'll treat you right. I promise.""

She pressed the medicine jar into Athena's hand. Athena opened it—and saw right away that it was half empty.

She knew this medicine. She was the one who produced it. She knew exactly how much was supposed to be in a full jar.

Of course. It had been used already. Passed down to her only after someone else didn't need it anymore.

Eloise noticed her silence and felt a sting of disappointment.

Athena hadn't always been like this. She used to smile at everything she was given. Used to sweetly call her ""Mother,"" like it meant something.

Now, she was distant. Cold. A stranger.

'Willow would never act like this,' she thought. 'That child is so thoughtful, so gentle.'

""Well, I'll let you rest. I'll stop by again tomorrow,"" Eloise said.

Athena stood. ""Take care, Lady Eloise.""

She made no move to walk her out. Eloise hid her disappointment, turned, and left with slow, unsteady steps.

Athena watched her go, a faint crease forming between her brows.

She thought, 'If not for Margaret's illness… I wouldn't stay in this house another day.'",1,1752321876.0,Novelnews,3,1.0,False

With the nice weather for the last month or so, I’ve been walking round a local park a bit, you get to see people you recognise. There’s a “men’s shed” and there’s usually a few old chaps (ie my age) just hanging out, playing draughts or whatever.  They run a repair service for radios and  hoovers and small stuff like that which can be quite interesting- one guy brought some miniature steam trains the other week, which were really great.  Oh, and you can generally get a coffee and a biscuit for 50p - It’s nice.


So we’re chatting today -  you know how it is, especially if you’re a guy - a lot of talk, but nothing really being said - they ask what I’m up to and I say oh waiting for my son and mother in law - and apparently its great I see my mother ln law and make time for her, and I’m all - “well she lives with me, so can’t avoid her” and we laugh like everyone our age laughs at mother in law jokes…

We have another coffee and enjoy the sunshine and we’re all agreeing that it’s much easier to fill the time in the summer, not so much hanging around bored and you can get out for a bit of air and see people, and I agree, I'm an early bird - my wife has always been a later riser, that sort of easy uncomplicated conversation with people you like well enough but don’t really know.

A bit more chat and then in a break that I didn’t realise was awkward until afterwards one bloke asks me “how long has your wife been gone now”  and I think well it’s my son and my mum In law I’m waiting for, but the guy is confused, no need to correct him” so I say - 

“oh not long, just a couple of hours” 

And they look at me 

And i fill the silence and and i say 

“well, feels like it”

And they kinda nod and agree but seem … off? 

And that’s when I realise … Saturday morning is the meeting for the Bereaved Husbands Group…. It even says so on the coffee mugs we’re holding. 

Fuck.

The onset of my POTS was sudden and severe and I was recently diagnosed. I’m currently in the phase where I cannot leave my house and I must be reclined for most of the day.  

I woke up around 4:15am and was pretty hot. I kicked all the covers off of me. I felt a weird pain in my kidney area. I figured I was sleeping weird and shifted positions. Then, I felt my heart start racing, and I thought “I’m dying, I’m going to call 911, oh wait no, this is probably a POTS episode, don’t panic.” I tried to remain calm. My heart rate shot up to 135 (prior to starting beta blockers, this would have been much higher). I was profusely sweating. I got up and grabbed an ice pack, placing it on my neck. I made a salty electrolyte drink. If I tried to lay down, it got worse (this is very typical of my symptoms) so I had to lean forward and take deep breaths. Eventually I got very cold and started shaking, my bodies indicator that the episode is passing, and my heart rate began to calm. 

I track my daily fluid intake. I had around 130oz of water, electrolyte drinks, and herbal tea yesterday (POTS has stripped me of the joy of coffee and occasional alcohol, so I don’t have those anymore). I’m not sure why this happened in the middle of the night.

  It’s just a dream. I recognized the thought, trying to pull me out of the hands that drug me to the darkest depths of the water. But panic overshadowed the rational thought, and I kicked as hard as I could. It’s just a dream, my voice echoed through my head again, trying to wake me.  
  
  I looked down into the murky water, my breath burning in my lungs. The hands were now long, jagged claws, and as I kicked, one claw pierced my ankle, anchoring me under the water. A dark cloud surrounded me as the blood oozed around its nails. I struggled against it, but it only tore deeper into me. A rush of air bubbled around me as I screamed in pain. I was about to inhale my death when something pressed against my face.  
  
  It didn’t feel like a dream anymore.  
  
  I shot up with a gasp, the pillow falling from my face. Disoriented and panting, I searched the room. Sara stood frozen by her bed, her eyes wide and mouth open.  
  
  “I’m so sorry,” she muttered. “I thought I heard you talking. I thought you were awake. ”  
  
  “I’m awake,” I exhaled quickly. With a deep breath, I pushed the panic away. Sara remained stunned even after I’d recovered.  
  
  “I shouldn’t have thrown the pillow on your head. I’m really sorry,” she frowned guiltily.  
  
  What are you talking about?” I brushed off her apology. “It was just a dream. I’m fine. ” After another deep breath to ease the shaking, I pulled back the covers. They clung to the layer of sweat covering my body.  
  
  “Good morning, Sara. ” I said as normally as I could.  
  
  “Good morning, Emma,” she finally returned, forced out of her guilt-ridden stupor. And just like that, it was over, thankfully. “I’m going to take a shower. We have to hurry. We’re leaving in an hour. ” She grabbed her things and disappeared.  
  
  I’d been trying to prepare myself for this day for over a month. It didn’t matter. I was still freaked just thinking about it. And now it was here.  
  
  I collapsed back on the bed and stared up at the white glowing skylights that lined the ceiling, the morning sun hidden behind the snow.  
  
  I looked around the room that had no true connection to me?the large flatscreen hanging on the wall, and a vanity in the corner, lined with makeup that had seen way too many makeovers at my expense. There were pictures of laughing friends taped to the mirror, and vibrant art adorned the walls. No reminder of my life before I came here. It was the place where I’d been hiding ?hiding from the judgment, whispers and stares.  
  
  Why was I here? I knew the answer. If I had the choice, I’d never leave. It’s not like I had anywhere else to go, and the McKinleys wouldn’t turn their backs on me. They were the only family I had, and for that I would always be grateful. But that wasn’t completely the truth. They werent the only family I had.  
  
  So when the phone rang while Sara was in the shower, I sucked in all the courage I could gather, put the phone to my ear and said, “Hi. ”  
  
  “Oh! You’re there,” my mother exclaimed, completely taken by surprise. “I’m so glad I was finally able to catch you. How are you?”  
  
  “I’m fine,” I replied, my heart stammering in my chest. “Um, so you have plans tonight?”  
  
  “Just a party with some friends,” she replied, sounding just as awkward as I felt. “Listen. I was hoping we could try, you know. . . I mean, I live pretty much in Weslyn now if you ever decide you’d like to. . . ”  
  
  
  “Yeah, sure,” I blurted, before I lost my nerve, “I’ll live with you. ”  
  
  “Oh, um, okay,” she responded in strained excitement. “Really?”  
  
  “Sure,” I answered, trying to sound sincere. “I mean, I’m leaving for college soon, so better reconnect now than when I’m across the country, right?”  
  
  She was silent, probably digesting that Id just invited myself to move in. ""Uh, yeah, that sounds great. When are you thinking?""  
  
  “Since I go back to school on Monday, how about Sunday?”  
  
  “Meaning, this Sunday? As in, three days from now?” There was no hiding the panic in her voice. My heart skipped a beat. She wasnt ready to take me back, was she?  
  
  “Would that be okay? I mean, I don’t need anything, just a bed, or even a couch. But if its too much. . . Sorry, I shouldnt have?”  
  
  “No… no, that’s perfect,” she stumbled. “Um, I have time to get your room ready, so… sure, Sunday it is. I live on Decatur Street. I’ll text you the address. ”  
  
  “Okay. I’ll see you Sunday then. ”  
  
  “Yup,” my mother replied, the shock still lingering in her tone. “Happy New Year, Emily. ”  
  
  “You too,” I returned before hanging up the phone. I stared up at the ceiling. What did I just do?! What was I thinking?  
  
  I grabbed my things and walked past Sara into the bathroom, trying to control the panic rising inside of me. By the time I emerged, I had come to terms with it. It was what I had to do.  
  
  “So, I have something to tell you,” I began, sitting on the stool next to Sara while her mother, Anna, poured herself a cup of coffee. “I spoke to my mother this morning. . . ”  
  
  “It’s about time,” Sara interrupted. “You’ve only been ignoring her for like six months. ”  
  
  “What did she have to say?” Anna encouraged, ignoring Saras outburst.  
  
  “Well. . . I’m moving in with her this Sunday. ” I held my breath as I watched the news sink in.  
  
  Saras spoon clanged inside the cereal bowl, but she didnt say a word.  
  
  “What made you decide that was the best thing to do?” Anna asked calmly, diverting attention from Saras silent disapproval.  
  
  “She’s my mother,” I shrugged. “I’m leaving for college soon, and I don’t think I’ll have another opportunity to try to fix us. I haven’t exactly been fair to her, and she keeps trying to connect, so I thought this was the best way to do it. ”  
  
  Anna nodded, considering my explanation. Sara stood up and briskly walked to the sink to drop her bowl in, still unable to look at me.  
  
  “Well, Carl and I will need to talk about it since we were given guardianship until you’re eighteen. And I’d really like to meet her before anythings final. Okay?”  
  
  I nodded, not expecting Annas answer. I wasnt used to having a parent actually care about me, so I didnt really know what to say.  
  
  “I understand why you want to do this,” Anna assured with a soft smile. “Let us just talk about it first, thats all. ”  
  
  ""Thanks,"" I accepted. ""It would mean a lot to get to know my mother again. ""  
  
  Sara stormed up the stairs without a single word. I exhaled deeply before following her up the stairs.  
  
  ""Okay, say it,"" I demanded flatly while Sara shoved items into her overnight bag.  
  
  ""I dont have anything to say,"" Sara quipped. But she did; it just took a three hour car ride to the hotel and a day of primping before it came out.

After a day of being prepped and primped from head to toe in Newport, I was exhausted, and we hadnt even gone to the party yet. Or maybe it was the drama of the impromptu decision to move in with my mother that drained my energy. Either way, I was having a hard time looking forward to tonight.  
  
  ""I dont understand why youre moving in with her,"" Sara reprimanded out of nowhere as she smoothed the brush over my lids. ""Couldnt you start with. . . uh. . . talking first? I just dont like it. She left you, Em. Why go back?""  
  
  ""Sara, please,"" I implored quietly, ""I need to do this. I know it seems messed up to you, but its important to me. Its not like youre losing me or anything. And if its horrible, Ill move back in with you. I feel like I should give her another chance. ""  
  
  Sara sighed dramatically. ""I still dont think its a good idea, but…"" she paused a moment, ""youre one of the most stubborn people I know, and if this is what you want to do, I know I wont be able to talk you out of it. Um, you can open your eyes now. ""  
  
  I stretched my eyes open and blinked, the mascara sticking along my lashes.  
  
  She deliberated, finally conceding with a roll of her eyes, ""Fine. Live with her. But shed better not do anything monumentally stupid like she did when she left you with psycho. ""  
  
  I grinned, adoring Saras protectiveness. ""Thank you. So. . . how do I look?""  
  
  ""Amazing, of course,"" Sara gloated, taking in her masterpiece. ""Im going to put my dress on, and then well be ready to meet the guys in the lobby. ""  
  
  I picked up the note that had been waiting for us when we returned to the hotel and ran my thumb over the elegant script.  
  
  Dear Emily and Sara,  
  
  I am thrilled that you have arrived safely and hope you enjoy your afternoon together. I am looking forward to seeing you this evening for dinner. I have arranged for the car to pick you up along with Evan and Jared at 6:45pm for our 7:00pm reservation.  
  
  I have no doubt that you will enjoy all that has been planned this evening!  
  
  Sincerely,  
  
  Vivian Mathews  
  
  ""I hope I dont embarrass her,"" I hollered through the bathroom door.  
  
  ""Stop being so nervous,"" Sara returned. ""Vivian really wants you there. This is important to her. She even convinced Jared to take me so I could be here with you. ""  
  
  I grinned, knowing that Jared didnt need much convincing.  
  
  ""What do you think? You havent said anything about how you look. ""  
  
  ""Oh, uh,"" I stepped in front of the full length mirror, and my lips curled up naturally. There was a slight resemblance to the girl who preferred jeans and a ponytail, the girl who still couldn’t conquer applying makeup on her own. Her light brown eyes glistened under a shimmer of pink and dark lashes. And her full lips, veiled with gloss, were smiling back with cheeks of red.  
  
  I turned to the side and the layers of chiffon flowed beneath me. My fingers traced the soft pink embroidered design on the champagne corseted top. Sara chose the same shade of pink to weave in my hair, resembling an inset headband, with a pile of soft curls artistically stacked at the nape of my neck. I picked up the finishing touch from the dresser and secured it around my neck, allowing my fingertips to brush the sparkling diamond as I did the day he’d given it to me.  
  
  As Sara stepped out of the bathroom, I turned toward the door with my cheeks aglow, ready to thank her for her ingenious transformation, but I was held speechless at the sight of her. The sapphire blue dress skimmed her body, brushing her curves in a shimmering dance. Large curls of red traipsed over her right shoulder. She looked… worshipable.  
  
  “Jared is in so much trouble,” I gaped. “Sara, you look amazing. ” I wasn’t sure why I was so in awe. She was the most desired girl in school for a reason, but I guess I forgot that most of the time because she was just Sara to me. There was no denying her modelesque figure and Hellenic beauty now.  
  
  Sara smiled vibrantly, revealing perfect white teeth behind her glossy red lips. “Maybe he is. ”  
  
  “Sara, please dont tell me youre going to sleep with him,"" I begged.  
  
  “Relax. I won’t,” she said with a roll of her eyes. ""But it doesnt mean we cant have fun. ""  
  
  My phone beeped, distracting me from her comment. Spoke with Carl and we called Rachel. She’s sweet, and I believe she wants this too. Meeting her on Saturday, but it looks like everything’s all set for Sunday.  
  
  Sara handed me my jacket and the bag that held Evans gift. ""Your parents are letting me move in with her,"" I announced.  
  
  ""Well, then I guess its official. "" Sara held the door open for me to follow.  
  
  ""I guess so,"" I returned, my stomach flipping with the realization.  
  
  I thought my knees might give out when we rounded the corner into the main lobby and I saw the back of the black tailored jacket. My eyes trailed to find his usually tousled light brown hair neatly swept to the side in a more distinguished look. He was caught up in a conversation with his brother and didn’t notice as we approached.  
  
  Evan stopped mid-sentence when Jared’s mouth dropped open. Jared was in trouble, and it was written all over his face as Sara sauntered toward him.  
  
  I couldn’t feel my legs moving as Evan turned around. My heart stopped at the sight of his smoky blue eyes, and a rush of heat filled my cheeks when his mouth formed that perfect smile. It had only been two weeks since hed left for his skiing trip, but for some reason it was like I was seeing him for the first time all over again.  
  
  “Hi,” I whispered. He stepped up to take my hand, our connection unbroken since our eyes first met.  
  
  “Hi,” he responded, still smiling. He tilted his head down to kiss me, but Sara interrupted.  
  
  “We need to go or we’ll be late. ”  
  
  “Sure,” Evan replied, instantly snapped back to the bustling lobby of formally dressed people, most likely attending the same event. He helped me slip on my jacket. I slid on black leather gloves in preparation for January’s freeze and took his hand again.  
  
  “What’s that?” Evan asked, gesturing toward the bag.  
  
  “A surprise,"" I grinned, having waited so long to give it to him it was killing me.  
  
  “I have one of those too,” he smirked, holding the door open for me.  
  
  “One what?”  
  
  “A surprise,” he revealed, smiling wider and sending another rush of color to my cheeks.  
  
  I ducked into the limo and slid in beside Sara, since she was sitting across from Jared. Evan was forced to sit next to his brother, leaving my hand empty. I glanced across at him, and we silently exchanged the I wish I were sitting next to you too look.  
  
  The limo pulled into a circular cobblestone driveway, and the driver came around to open the door. The restaurant resembled a mansion more than a dining establishment, with multiple eaves and glowing windows on each level.  
  
  We were escorted to a private patio that was glassed in for the winter season, offering a spectacular view of the dark rolling ocean.  
  
  “Wonderful! You’re here,” Vivian greeted brightly with open arms. She gripped each of her sons by the shoulders as they bent to kiss her on the cheek, then admired Sara and I after the guys helped remove our jackets.  
  
  “Exquisite,” she declared, wrapping us each in her signature brief embrace with a brush of her lips on our cheeks. “Come. Sit down. ”  
  
  Stuart remained unmoved. Not giving us a glance since our arrival. He stoically gazed out at the ocean holding a glass of ice, filled with caramel colored liquor.  
  
  At Vivian’s insistence, we each found a seat. I made certain to sit next to Evan at the rectangular table, with Jared and Sara across from us and Vivian and Stuart at each end. Evan took my hand under the draped table, instantly calming my nerves.  
  
  The polite small talk began. I tried my best not to participate unless a question or comment was directed my way, and of course each time it was, I usually had my mouth full or was in mid-gulp. Sara pressed her lips together to keep from laughing, which only made me squirm uncomfortably.  
  
  After surviving th  
e anxiety inducing dinner, I excused myself to use the restroom and promised to meet Evan in the foyer.  
  
  It was a struggle to hold the chiffon over my head so it wouldnt fall in the toilet. I was standing outside the bathroom door, smoothing the layers back in place, when I heard, “I don’t want to talk about this again. ”  
  
  I remained still. Not sure if I should continue around the corner, or wait until they were done. I was thankful I decided not walk in on, “She’s not your future, Evan. It’s about time you realized that. I won’t allow you to pass up on Yale to follow a girl, especially that one, across the country. ”  
  
  “It’s not your choice to make for me, Dad,” Evan bit back. “I don’t expect you to understand. ”  
  
  “Stuart, what are you doing?” Vivian beckoned from afar. “We’re going to be late. ”  
  
  I remained still, having collapsed flat against the restroom door with my heart pounding and my mind racing. What just happened? I knew Stuart was withdrawn, but I had no idea it was because he didn’t approve of me. His reaction sunk in, and my lip quivered.  
  
  I bit my lip, taking a deep breath to compose myself. Then I walked around the corner and forced a smile when I saw Evan waiting for me with my jacket over his arm.  
  
  “Are you okay?” he asked, inspecting my face. I pushed my smile wider with a nod of my head. I slipped my arms into the jacket with my back toward Evan, afraid he could see right through me.  
  
  Evan held the door open and allowed me to lead the way to the limo. Sara and Jared were across from us, lost in conversation about who they deemed to be the best guitarist.  
  
  Evan took my hand. “Are you shaking?”  
  
  “It’s cold,” I lied, wanting to roll my eyes at my involuntary “tell”. Evan wrapped his arm around me to warm me up. I eased away the nerves, nuzzling into him.  
  
  “Wow,” Sara admired the up lit mansion as the limo slowly crept in line with the others. A streak of nerves twisted my stomach. I felt like I was nearing the head of the line for a death defying rollercoaster ride.  
  
  “They’re just people,” Evan assured in my ear, probably noticing I wasn’t breathing. I exhaled to relax my shoulders, squeezing his hand.  
  
  Just people soaked in jewels of every color or poised in tailored tuxedoes, full of judgment and snide comments, I thought. We made our way through the glitz covered bodies shimmering in the candlelight. The voices swirled in time with the smooth jazz band in the ballroom.  
  
  Everywhere I looked, I was struck by more brilliance.  
  
  “Mrs. Mathews, this is incredible,” Sara gawked. “I’ve never seen anything so beautiful. ”  
  
  “I’m not so sure my sons would agree,” Vivian replied with a sparkling smile. My cheeks grew warm when Evan squeezed my hand. “This did turn out more spectacular than I could have hoped. I am so happy to have you all here with me. I need to greet a few more guests, but I will be expecting a dance later, Evan. ” The corner of her mouth rose as she met her son’s eyes, and she glided away in the antiqued ivory dress that floated around her. Vivian was picturesque sophistication with her blond hair swept back into a French twist. I admired how collected she always remained, even in a setting that was completely overwhelming to me.

  “You're fired,” Lucifer bit out as he openly glared at the small woman sitting across from him, silently daring her to argue with him, again.  
  
  Five goddamn long years he'd been trying to fire the woman staring back at him through deceptively innocent baby blue eyes and every single time she’d somehow managed to get out of it, but not today.  
  
  This time she’d gone too far.  
  
  “Is this about the uniforms?” Rebecca Shaw, the bane of his existence, asked with a slight frown that only managed to further piss him off.  
  
  “Yes,” he snarled at the little hypochondriac that missed more days than all his other employees combined as he somehow resisted the urge to throttle the meddling woman that had made his life a living hell since the day that he’d foolishly hired her.  
  
  Her frown deepened as she glanced over her shoulder at the stack of boxes that had arrived only an hour ago. “Did they mess up the order?” she asked, having the balls to look adorably confused as she returned her attention back to him.  
  
  “You could say that,” he said, honestly surprised that he hadn't resorted to shouting at the little pain in the ass yet.  
  
  He glanced at the Coca Cola clock hanging above the door and noted that it was still early. It usually took her a good ten minutes or so to reduce him to monosyllabic words and incoherent rants yelled at the top of his lungs.  
  
  “Damn it!” she groaned, getting to her feet. Shaking her head in disbelief, she walked over to the boxes that were being returned first thing in the morning and ripped open the box sitting by the door. “I was hoping we'd be able to have them by Friday,” she explained as she pulled out a black tee shirt and inspected it.  
  
  “I'm sure you were,” he said dryly as he watched her inspect a few of the shirts, aprons and pants that were neatly piled in the box.  
  
  “I'm not seeing a problem,” she said with that damn small sigh of hers that always grated on his nerves as she looked at the shirt in her hands before starting the inspection process all over again.  
  
  “Don't you?” he asked, cocking an eyebrow as he leaned back in his chair and-  
  
  “What the hell are you doing?” he demanded when the woman that he should have realized was crazy years ago pulled off her off-white Fire & Brimstone tee shirt and tossed it on his desk, leaving her in a black bra that looked like it was struggling to keep the large pale breasts that she'd somehow managed to shove inside it from bursting free.  
  
  “Trying on the new uniform,” she explained with an expression that clearly told him that it should have been more than obvious what the crazed woman was doing while he sat there, watching helplessly as she reached up and adjusted her bra, wondering where he'd gone wrong.  
  
  It was in that moment that he would forever be grateful that he was an ass man, otherwise-  
  
  “Don't. Even. Fucking. Think. Of, it,” he bit out, stressing every syllable to make sure that she’d heard him.  
  
  She stopped unbuttoning her pants, opened her mouth to argue, but something in his expression must have clued the psychotic woman into the fact that he was seconds away from throttling her with his bare hands. With a long-suffering sigh that would put every man in his family to shame, she fixed her pants and tossed the slacks that she’d been seconds away from trying on back in the box.  
  
  “I still don't see the problem,” she said, gesturing to the shirt that she’d had absolutely no business ordering.  
  
  “That's because you're-where the hell are you going?” he demanded when she suddenly turned around and left without another word, making her escape just as he was about to fire her ass and bringing his rage to the homicidal stage  
  
  He sat there for another minute, refusing to chase after her. He'd planned on firing her in his office, had actually fantasized about it, and he was damn well going to do it in his fucking office. He opened his mouth to demand that she get her ass back in there so that he could live out his fantasy when the next words out of her mouth had him releasing a vicious curse and racing for the door.  
  
  “Hey, Tim! What do you think of the new uniforms?”  
  
  He was going to kill her, he decided as he stormed out of his office and across the taproom to find the little pain in the ass showing everyone the uniform that she’d ordered behind his back.  
  
  “I love it!” Abigail, his bar manager, gushed approvingly, further pissing him off because there was nothing wrong with the fucking uniforms that he'd designed tens years ago!  
  
  “It's about damn time,” Tim said with a smile that quickly disappeared when he spotted Lucifer walking towards them.  
  
  “I think this will go a lot better with the new…” Rebecca started to explain only to let her words trail off with a resigned sigh when he grabbed her and threw her over his shoulder. “Didn't we talk about the manhandling?” she asked as she settled in over his shoulder, getting comfortable as he walked back to his office.  
  
  “We need to have a little chat,” he calmly explained, deciding that there really was no need to yell and ruin this momentous occasion.  
  
  “Another one?” she asked, not sounding particularly worried as he carried her back to his office, pausing only long enough to kick the door shut behind him before he deposited his unwanted waitress in the rickety old chair he saved for just such an occasion. With a sigh of his own, he returned to his desk, satisfied that everything in the world was as it should be.  
  
  He sat down, cleared his throat and opened his mouth to recite the speech that he'd been working on since the moment he’d realized his mistake hiring her, but after a slight pause he took a long, satisfying breath, deciding to savor the moment.  
  
  It was a mistake and part of him knew that when he’d decided to do it, but after five long years of hell and bullshit he hadn't been able to help himself. After all the crazy bullshit she’d brought into his life he'd wanted to savor that one precious moment when he finally freed himself of her.  
  
  “I was hoping to talk to you this morning,” his own personal reminder that hell did in fact exist, said as she stood up and walked around his desk, but this time he’d been prepared and had stacked a large pile of folders on the corner of his desk earlier so that she couldn't-  
  
  “What the hell do you think you're doing” he demanded as she simply walked past the large pile of folders he'd stacked on his desk to keep her off her customary spot and hopped up on his desk.  
  
  Right. In. Front. Of. Him.  
  
  “Nothing,” she said, shooting him a frown as though he was the one that had lost his goddamn mind.  
  
  “Move,” he bit out between clenched teeth as she lazily crossed one leg over the other, leaned back and grabbed-  
  
  “Please tell me that you're fucking kidding me,” he said when the crazed woman reached back and grabbed the clipboard that had helped make his life a living hell over the last five years.  
  
  He still wasn't sure how she did it, but whenever she felt the urge to see if he was willing to do ten to life behind bars for manslaughter, she pulled out that damn clipboard. She never carried it around, but it always seemed to be within reaching distance, something that had driven him nuts until he realized that he was allowing this small, plump pain in the ass to have that much power over him. Once he’d figured it out, he'd forced himself not to care that she was able to pull that fucking torture device from thin air and ruin his whole fucking day with just a few key, “points.”  
  
  “I had to switch Jen to the morning shift, because I have an appointment this morning. But, I should be back in time for the lunch rush,” she began, trying to prolong the inevitable and bringing this whole thing to a new level of fucking pathetic.  
  
  “There's no point in you coming back,” he explained before finally adding, “you're fired.”  
  
  “Uh huh,” she mumble  
d absently, clearly ignoring him, which unfortunately for her was one of the things that pissed him off the most about her.  
  
  Well, to be honest he hated a lot of things about pretty much everyone. Except for his family. He tolerated them, because he had to or his mother would probably beat the shit out of him.  
  
  Then his father would, of course, feel obligated to kick his ass for upsetting his mother.  
  
  Then his brothers would try to kick his ass. That is, if he survived the ass whooping from his father, which wasn't likely. So, for self-preservation, he tolerated his family.  
  
  To a point.  
  
  He might have to acknowledge them and refrain from killing them when they annoyed the shit out of him, but he didn't have to let them in his restaurant no matter how much they bitched and God, did they bitch.  
  
  “I'll be back for the lunch rush,” the thorn in his side repeated, reminding him that he was supposed to be living out his fantasy.  
  
  There was no way in hell that he was allowing her to ruin this for him. He'd dreamed of doing this and now that he was doing it, he was going to savor every second of it.  
  
  “You're fired,” he repeated, taking perverse satisfaction in letting those two words roll off his tongue.  
  
  “I had Eric go through the refrigerator this morning and clean it out today instead of tomorrow since we’re getting the delivery in the morning,” she said with a little frown that he refused to find adorable as she absently reached down, grabbed his coffee and took a sip before he could stop her. As soon as she was done, he took the cup away from her.  
  
  “Didn't you hear what I just said?” he asked with a glare as the frustrating woman took the cup out of his and took another sip before handing it back to him, leaving him sitting there, glaring at the woman that refused to leave.  
  
  “I also had to let Jeff go this morning,” she said, grabbing his attention in a big way.  
  
  “You did what?” he snapped, taking note of the time that she'd set a new record for making him lose his fucking mind.  
  
  “I fired him,” she said with a shrug as though it was no big deal.  
  
  It was a big fucking deal!  
  
  “Who the hell do you think you are firing one of my employ-,” he started to demand only to get cut off and left speeches by the little brat as she tossed the clipboard to him, hopped off his desk and headed for the door.  
  
  “He was calling hookers from the business line and using petty cash to pay them. Well, I'll be back in a few hours!” she said cheerfully as he sat there, staring at the door long after she’d left, wondering how she’d managed to keep doing this to him.  
  
  It wouldn't happen again, he promised himself as he grabbed his own clipboard and headed for the morning meeting, determined to salvage the rest of the day. When he was done he’d come back and try this again, but this time he would succeed. After he’d finally managed to fire her, he would focus on finding a way to evict the little pain in the ass from the apartment he’d stupidly leased to her.  
  
  Chapter 2  
  
  “What happened?” Melanie, her best friend since the second grade and roommate, asked as Rebecca quietly closed the door behind her.  
  
  “He fired me again,” she admitted as she tried to go for casual while she walked through their loft-style apartment and headed towards the bathroom.  
  
  “Gonna be sick?” Melanie asked around a yawn from where she lounged on the couch with a magazine, a Coke and her reason for living, a double chocolate fudge Pop-Tart.  
  
  “No, no of course not,” she lied, barely resisting the urge to place her hand over her stomach, dive for the wastebasket by the kitchen island and finally find some relief from the damn nausea that had been plaguing her since breakfast.  
  
  “Really?” Melanie asked, cocking a brow as she continued thumbing through her magazine, pausing only long enough to push back a thick strand of her honey blond hair.  
  
  “I'm fine,” Rebecca swore, forcing herself to stop a mere twenty feet from her salvation.  
  
  “Really?” Melanie asked, not sounding as though she really believed her, which of course was a problem since Rebecca really didn't want to go to this appointment. But, unless she was able to convince Melanie that she was fine, she-  
  
  “You're not getting out of this appointment,” the bossy woman announced with a bored sigh, making Rebecca regret offering to share her juice box back in pre-school.  
  
  “I'm fine,” she bit out, outraged that her best friend refused to believe her.  
  
  “Then explain why you're pale,” Melanie demanded, still not looking up from her magazine. Then again, Melanie probably didn't need to after all these years to know when she was sick.  
  
  “Because I'm Irish,” she reminded her inconsiderate friend.  
  
  “And the trembling?”  
  
  “Leftover adrenaline surge from my meeting with Lucifer,” she explained with a small sniffle, hoping to play on her best friend’s sympathetic heart to get out of this since the last thing that she wanted to do was waste her day at another doctor’s office just so they could tell her that it was all in her head.  
  
  “Nice try, but you're not getting out of this,” Melanie, the cold hearted bitch, said, sounding bored while Rebecca stood there, bottom lip trembling, eyes tearing up as she hugged herself, making sure to look appropriately traumatized.  
  
  “It was so t-terrifying,” she said, waiting two crucial seconds before she added a little sob at the end there, hoping that it would be enough so that they could end this charade and get on with their lives.  
  
  “Uh huh,” Melanie mumbled, still not bothering to grant her the courtesy of a glance as she sipped her Coke.  
  
  “I don't think I'll ever get over it,” Rebecca whispered harshly, taking a discrete step in the direction of the bathroom, praying that the traitor hadn't noticed.  
  
  “First off,” Melanie began, only pausing long enough to take another sip of her soda, “you are probably the only person alive that isn't terrified of Lucifer Bradford.”  
  
  Rebecca began to argue, simply to argue, but the damn woman wasn't done yet. “Secondly, you're not fooling anyone with that pathetic lip tremble. If you're going to be sick then get it over with, because you're not getting sick in my car, again,” Melanie announced on another bored sigh that earned her a glare.  
  
  Rebecca continued to stand there glowering at her best friend while a thousand arguments ran through her head, but her damn stomach decided that it was time to take this to the next level and start cramping, nearly knocking her on her ass and guaranteeing that Melanie won this match.  
  
  That didn't mean that she planned on going quietly to this appointment, because she didn't. She'd get out of this appointment like she'd gotten out of so many before. All she had to do was-  
  
  “Tick, tock,” the annoying bitch that she loathed more with every passing second, said mockingly, forever earning her hatred.  
  
  “This isn't over!” Rebecca snapped, simply because it was and they both knew it.  
  
  “Whatever you say, sunshine,” Melanie said in an annoying singsong voice just to piss her off even more.  
  
  Rebecca opened her mouth to argue, but ended up slapping a hand against her mouth as she narrowed her eyes on the woman that should have rightfully been her nemesis and decided to make a tactical retreat to the bathroom before she did something that would prove the gloating bitch right.  
  
  The door had just shut behind her when she lost the battle and her breakfast, something that she was doing more frequently lately. It was also something that she’d been trying to avoid doing today, knowing that it would be her downfall. She didn’t want to go to this appointment today simply because she was sick and tired of listening to doctors tell her that there was nothing wrong with her all while giving her that look that made her feel worthless. They all thought that she was a hypochondriac and the scary part was that they might be right.  
  
  She couldn’t remember a time when she hadn’t been sick. In school she’d set the record for most absences. Her parents had been terrified that they were going to lose her. That is, until she hit middle  
school and the doctors that she’d depended on to make everything better had come to the conclusion that she was faking it for attention.  
  
  It hadn’t mattered how many times she’d sworn up and down that she wasn’t feeling good, her parents had refused to listen. They’d followed the doctor’s orders, sent her to school every day and when the nurse called them to tell them that they needed to pick her up from school they’d refused.  
  
  The only person that had ever believed that there was something wrong with her was the evil woman in the other room, waiting to ambush her and drag her by the hair to see the latest doctor, who in two hours would explain in the politest way possible that there was absolutely nothing wrong with her seconds before he suggested that she may benefit from seeing a psychiatrist. She used to argue, determined to make them realize that they were making a mistake, that they’d missed something, but none of them had ever listened. Eventually, she’d stopped trying, stopped keeping her appointments and eventually stopped hoping for an answer.  
  
  She just wished that Melanie would accept the fact that there was nothing anyone could do and let this go so that she could live the rest of her life in misery, but the frustrating woman refused to listen to reason. No matter how many times she’d begged, glared and bitched, Melanie refused to drop it. Melanie had always believed that she was sick and had always been there for her. She’d understood when she was too sick to do anything and never got pissed when she had to cancel plans so that she could spend some quality time curled up in bed, trying to pretend that she didn’t hate her life.  
  
  It had meant the world to her to have someone in her life that didn’t think the worst of her. Having Melanie in her life was the one thing that had kept her sane all these years. It was just too  bad that her best friend was driving her insane with all this nagging and threats of violence. She didn’t want to go see another doctor, but unfortunately for her, Melanie didn’t seem to care about what she wanted. Her best friend was determined to figure out what was wrong with her and fix it even if that meant dragging her kicking and screaming to see every doctor in the world.  
  
  Even though it annoyed the hell out of her, it meant the world to her having someone who believed in her the way that Melanie did. No matter what anyone said about her, Melanie always had her back, which was why she resisted the urge to throttle her best friend when she refused to back down and just accept the fact that there was nothing that anyone could do to fix her.  
  
  \*-\*-\*-\*  
  
  “What about the specials?” Rose, a waitress he’d hired a few months ago on the recommendation of his sister-in-law, asked.  
  
  “What about them?” Lucifer asked as he leaned back against the wall, looking through the time cards.  
  
  “Are there any changes?” she asked as she glanced at the menus for the night.  
  
  There should be, but the new recipes that he’d been working on weren’t ready yet. “No. They’re the same as last week,” he said as he glanced up at the whiteboard by the clock to see what last week’s specials were.  
  
  He looked over the list before deciding that the dessert menu was a little weak. “I’ll make a call to Dixon Bakery and see if they have anything they can spare for tonight’s dinner service,” he said, deciding that it would probably be for the best if he went in person and had a Bradford special to help him recover from this morning’s disappointment.  
  
  She really was going to be the death of him, he thought as he initialed this morning’s time stamps. All except two. He set the first one aside and looked for the matching time stamp. It only took him a few seconds to find it.  
  
  Sighing, he said, “Aimee?”  
  
  “Yes?” Aimee said, shifting nervously and for good reason.  
  
  “You’re fired,” he said, not bothering to look up from her time card.  
  
  “But-”  
  
  “You have five minutes to clear out your locker,” he said, placing her time stamp aside before selecting the other time card that she’d decided to stamp this morning and making him wonder why he was having such a hard time firing Rebecca.  
  
  “You can tell Kelly when you see her that she’s fired as well,” he said, putting a line through Kelly’s timecard.  
  
  She didn’t say anything else as she quickly grabbed her stuff and left, because she knew better. He didn’t take any shit from anyone and he rarely gave second chances. There was a reason why everyone called him Lucifer to his face and asshole to his back. He didn’t have a problem with either nickname, because he’d earned both.  
  
  Even as a kid he hadn’t been someone that you wanted to fuck with. He never took any shit from anyone and if you had a problem with that, he’d always been more than happy to clear up any misunderstandings. Although he was an asshole, and he had absolutely no problems with admitting that, he wasn’t a bully and never pulled any shit. If you left him alone, he left you alone, but God help you if he caught you fucking someone over because he’d be in your face before you had a chance to blink.  
  
  He wasn’t like the rest of the men in his family. They were more laid back, easy going while he was straight-laced and probably took everything too seriously. He’d always been like that and had never thought about changing and why should he? He was happy with the way that his life had turned out.  
  
  He had the restaurant of his dreams, which he would admit was still a work in progress, decent friends, a good place to live and a family that accepted him for the asshole that he was. His life was fucking perfect.  
  
  He set his own hours, worked on whatever he wanted and ensured that one day his restaurant would be the best in the city. When he accomplished that he would look into opening more locations and hopefully one day he would be able to sit back and enjoy his success. Until that day happened, he was going to put absolutely everything that he had into making this restaurant great even if that meant spending all his time and every last penny he had to make that happen.  
  
  \*-\*-\*-\*  
  
  “Move your ass, Shaw!” the controlling bitch that she loved more than anything, said in a chipper voice as she walked past the bathroom. “We’re leaving in ten minutes.”  
  
  “No, we’re not!” Rebecca snapped back even though she knew damn well that she didn’t have a choice.  
  
  She was going or Melanie would beat the living shit out of her and then drag her unconscious body to the doctor’s office. As much fun as it would be to wake up by being poked and prodded, she was going to have to pass and accept the fact that she was going to have deal with another doctor telling her that it was all in her head.  
  
  Yup, it was going to be loads of fun, she thought dryly as she grabbed her toothbrush and cleaned her teeth, telling herself that she didn’t have a choice. She either went of her own free will or Melanie would walk in here, grab her by the hair and drag her down the backstairs, out the door and shove her unconscious body in the trunk of her car.  
  
  Since she really didn’t feel like being shoved into the trunk with Melanie’s gym clothes that hadn’t seen the inside of a washing machine in five years, she decided to suck it up and accept the fact that she was going to sit there and smile politely while another doctor explained in the subtlest terms that she was insane. She was going to-  
  
  “Get off me!” Melanie suddenly yelled, sounding pissed and making Rebecca sigh heavily, because by this point Melanie really should have learned how to deal with their sweet, little baby. As Rebecca rinsed her mouth and put her toothbrush away, the bloodcurdling screaming began.  
  
  “Screaming will only make it worse!” she yelled over the screams, wondering why Melanie couldn’t remember that one simple rule.  
  
  “Get him off me!” Melanie screamed hysterically, which was just ridiculous, because Mojo would never hurt her and she knew that.  
  
  Muttering to herself, Rebecca stepped into the small hallway that was made even smaller by the fact that Melanie was laying on the floor with the two-hundred and sixty-five pound mastiff laying on top of her, happily wagging his tail as he continued to drool all over the woman that seemed to have a problem with cuddling.  
  
  “Are you going to get him off me?” Melanie demanded as she tried, and failed, to turn her head to get out of the path of all that drool slowly dripping down on her face and neck.  
  
  “Are you going to cancel the doctor’s appointment?” Rebecca countered, realizing that she might actually have a shot at getting out of this appointment. She’d still get her ass kicked. There was no doubt about that, but at least thanks to Mojo and his love for a good cuddle, she’d miss her appointment and really, that’s all that mattered to her.  
  
  “No!” the stubborn woman that was lying in a large puddle of dog drool snapped, shooting a terrifying glare in her direction as though it was somehow Rebecca’s fault that Mojo loved to tackle her whenever the opportunity presented itself.  
  
  “Are you sure?” Rebecca asked after a slight hesitation, simply because she knew how this was going to end.  
  
  “Yes!”  
  
  “Then I’m afraid that there’s nothing that I can do,” she said with a shrug as she turned around and headed for the back door, deciding that she’d go back to work since it appeared that she suddenly had a few extra hours to kill.  
  
  Chapter 3  
  
  “I’m going to fucking kill her,” he said in resignation as he rubbed his hands down his face, because he no longer had a choice. Not now when every single one of his employees was wearing the uniform that the little demon had ordered behind his back.  
  
  He couldn’t even say that he hadn’t seen this day coming. There had been plenty of clues along the way letting him know that one day he would have no choice but to dump her body into a tub of holy water and let the Devil have his protégé back.  
  
  There was the day that Rebecca Shaw had shown up twenty minutes late to her interview, wearing a Goo  
nies t-shirt, flannel pajama pants, pink bunny slippers and carrying a resume that proudly informed anyone who had the misfortune of reading it about the five years she’d spent finding herself as she’d jumped from job to job…to job.  
  
  Normally he never would have hired someone who clearly didn’t have their shit together, but at the time he’d been short-staffed because he’d mistakenly hired waitresses who couldn’t handle a little fucking criticism without bursting into tears. When she hadn’t turned into a nervous wreck five minutes into the interview, the time it usually took someone to decide that working at Fire & Brimstone just wasn’t for them, he decided to hire her on a temporary basis.  
  
  With her work history he’d figured that it was only a matter of weeks before she’d quit and by the time that happened, he should have been able to find a reliable waitress who knew how to do her job without pissing him off. Unfortunately for his sanity and his blood pressure, things hadn’t worked out that way.  
  
  Like the first time that he’d tried to fire her and had somehow ended up with a new menu, two new waitresses that actually turned out to be pretty good, and renting the apartment across from his to her, her best friend and that fucking dog. He still wasn’t sure how she’d managed it, but every fucking time that he tried to tell her to stop fucking with his head, his life, and his restaurant, she somehow managed to change the subject and fuck with his head until he found himself doing exactly what she wanted just to shut her the fuck up, but no longer.  
  
  He was fucking done.  
  
  Absolutely fucking done.  
  
  Shooting one last glare at the uniforms that would make a lovely addition to a bonfire, he headed towards the back, giving customers a slight nod when they waved hello and ignoring the employees that were trying to derail him from his life’s purpose with petty bullshit. He didn’t stop until he found himself in the employee hallway and was forced to punch in the code to release the security door that lead upstairs to the apartments that he’d added shortly after he’d purchased the building.  
  
  As soon as the door clicked open, he was in the stairwell and heading upstairs where he would finally end the little demon’s reign of terror. This ended today, he promised himself, refusing to put up with her bullshit for one more day. Thirty seconds later, he was at her door and raising his hand as anticipation coursed through his body.  
  
  Finally, this nightmare was about to-  
  
  “Good morning, Christopher,” the little terror greeted him with a huge smile when she opened the door and spotted him, daring to call him the name that not even his mother used anymore, further fueling his determination to get rid of her. “Did you need something?”  
  
  “You’re fired,” he blurted out with absolutely no finesse, ruining what he’d been working on for years, but at the moment he really didn’t fucking care as long as the job got done. The only thing that mattered was finally ridding himself of the biggest mistake of his life.  
  
  Instead of crying, begging for her job or arguing with him like most sane people would have done, she simply nodded and mumbled a distracted, “I see,” as she glanced over her shoulder at something in her apartment, the move causing her curly black hair that he had to admit that he liked about her to slide off her shoulder.  
  
  “You’re fired,” he said a little louder, determined to make sure that there were no misunderstandings.  
  
  “Uh huh,” she mumbled, sounding even more distracted as she turned around, grabbed the door handle and ever so carefully, pulled the door closed behind her. She slowly backed away from the door. Licking her lips nervously, she shot a hopeful glance towards the stairwell door as though she was calculating the odds of making it there before-  
  
  “You little bitch!” came the feminine roar as the door was suddenly thrown open and Melanie, the normal one in this duo as far as he could tell, launched herself at Rebecca before the much smaller woman could so much as gasp in surprise as she took her down to the ground.  
  
  “Get the hell off me!” Rebecca demanded a minute later as she rolled over onto her stomach and attempted to crawl away, but the crazed woman on top of her, who’d clearly been pushed to her limit, refused to let her go.  
  
  “No!”  
  
  “Bitch!” Rebecca shot back, triggering a verbal duel that he was, unfortunately, all too familiar with.  
  
  “Whore!”  
  
  “Tramp!”  
  
  “Bieber lover!” Melanie growled as she put Rebecca in a headlock and earned a gasp of outrage, because clearly that was crossing the line.  
  
  “You bitch!” Rebecca snarled, forgoing her attempts to escape so that she could put her best friend in a headlock of her own.  
  
  Sighing heavily, Lucifer pinched the bridge of his nose, wondering how his life had turned into this fucked up existence. He’d like to say that living with these two was like living with his family, but sadly, he couldn’t even say that, because they were clearly worse than anyone in his family, which was actually fucking disturbing.  
  
  “Are you two done yet?” he asked, not really surprised when they ignored him and continued to fight, argue or whatever they fucking called it.  
  
  “You’re going!” Melanie snapped with a determined expression as she released her hold on Rebecca and-  
  
  “Ow!” Rebecca screamed as Melanie grabbed her by the ear and gave it a good twist, a move that never seemed to fail and one that the little pain in the ass really should have expected.  
  
  “I didn’t come up here to witness more of your bullshit,” he snapped as the pair moved onto ineffectual bitch slaps. “I wanted to make sure that you understood that you’re fired.”  
  
  But, like always, they continued to ignore him and the fact that their “baby,” had come out into the hallway to watch them, already looking bored. Thankful that the dog hadn’t focused on him, Lucifer decided to give it one more try before he left, secure in the knowledge that he’d accomplished what he’d come here to do.  
  
  “You’re fired.”  
  
  “We heard you the first time!” Melanie snapped, looking more determined than he’d ever seen her before as she stood up and attempted to drag her best friend towards the stairwell door by her ear.  
  
  “Let go!” Rebecca snapped right back, but it was clear to everyone in the hallway, including the dog now snoring loudly by the door, that she’d lost.  
  
  Having had enough bullshit today and wanting to make sure that the worst employee that he’d ever had knew that she was fired, he walked over to the struggling duo, reached down and swept Rebecca off her feet. He ignored the twin sounds of outrage, the dog rolling over onto his side and blocking most of the hallway and headed for his apartment.  
  
  \*-\*-\*-\*  
  
  “Hey! I was winning that!” she argued, even though she’d been getting her ass royally kicked and seconds away from being dragged down a flight of stairs by her ear.  
  
  “Shut up and sit down,” Lucifer said evenly as he rudely deposited her on one of the large leather couches taking up the large open space, letting her know that she’d finally pushed him too far, because he’d never once in the five years that she’d worked for him allowed her inside his apartment.  
  
  No one was allowed in here as far as she knew. This was his sanctuary, his escape from the rest of the world and the one place that she’d never attempted to infiltrate, because she hadn’t wanted to see exactly how far she could push him before he snapped and turned the infamous Lucifer Bradford temper on her. It wasn’t as though he hadn’t lost his temper with her before. It happened on a daily basis and usually more than once a day, but she’d never seen him this angry before.  
  
  At other people?  
  
  All. The. Time.  
  
  Since she really didn’t want to be on the receiving end of that aforementioned temper, she decided that it would probably be in her best interest if she made a hasty retreat and gave him a chance to cool off.  
  
  “You and I need to have a talk,” he bit out with a cold glare that didn’t bode well for her.  
  
  Yeah….no, she was good.  
  
  “We definitely should talk,” she agreed with a firm  
nod, because she’d learned years ago that the best way to deal with Lucifer Bradford was to either distract him or avoid him altogether and since she didn’t have her trusty clipboard with her...  
  
  She needed to get out of here for a few hours and unfortunately for her, the only thing that would grant her sanctuary until Mr. Cranky Pants here redirected that anger issue of his onto someone else was a visit to the Doctor’s office.  
  
  Well, there really was no point in putting it off any longer, especially since Lucifer looked liked he was going to try firing her again. He really was cute when he thought that he was in charge, she mused with a resigned sigh as she got to her feet and headed for the door.  
  
  “Where the hell do you think you’re going?” he demanded, somehow managing to look downright adorable for a man that could have easily been a cover model with his brooding green eyes, perfect tan, great build and short jet black hair that he swept forward every morning.  
  
  It really was a shame that he was such an asshole, she thought as she gave him one of those huge smiles that made always seemed to make the muscle beneath his eye tick and said brightly, “Doctor’s appointment!”  
  
  Before he could reply, she was out the door and in a chokehold by a woman who could teach Lucifer Bradford a thing or two about channeling all that anger.

My funeral was quite the spectacle.

A crystal coffin surrounded by white roses—my favorite flowers when I was alive.

My four brothers stood by the coffin in black suits, their faces as pale as ghosts.

At the front, my fiancé, Enoch Leblanc, stood frozen. His trembling fingers brushed the edge of the coffin. His usually indifferent eyes were now swollen and bloodshot with grief.

How ironic.

When I was alive, none of them could even be bothered to look at me. Now that I was gone, they acted like they couldn't live without me.

I hovered above them, watching with cold detachment from the ceiling. If souls could laugh, I'd be laughing my head off right now.

\*\*\*\*\*

""Erika..."" Enoch croaked, his voice hoarse. He choked out, ""I'm sorry. I...""

It was funny that he only knew he was wrong now.

I floated right in front of him. Even though I knew he couldn't hear me, I couldn't help but sneer, ""Oh, Enoch, who exactly are those crocodile tears for? Back when Denise framed me for stealing her necklace, weren't you the one who said, 'I never thought you were that kind of person'?""

Muffled sobs echoed through the funeral hall. Jayden Kline, my eldest brother, punched the wall and scratched his knuckles. He was a titan of business, but at that moment, such an invincible man like him seemed as vulnerable as a child.

""It's my fault,"" Jayden murmured. ""If only I'd listened to her back then.""

Marcus Kline, my second elder brother, stood silently in the corner and clenched something tightly in his hand.

I approached him, stunned to see it was the handcrafted leather wallet I'd given him for his birthday last year. Back then, he tossed it aside with a sneer, saying, ""I don't need this cheap trinket."" Now, he was clutching it like a treasured possession.

Dylan Kline, my third elder brother, was a rational lawyer. Now he stood there with tears streaming down his face and kept his gaze fixed on my face in the coffin.

Sherman Kline, my fourth elder brother, was on his knees. His shoulders trembled uncontrollably. He had always defended Denise most fiercely, but now he couldn't even bring himself to look at my lifeless form.

A nurse entered solemnly and handed an envelope to my adoptive mother, Simone Yarwood. ""These are Ms. Kline's personal effects,"" the nurse said quietly. ""She wrote this during her lucid moments in the hospital.""

All eyes were glued to that thin envelope. I sneered because the real deal was inside. It was irrefutable evidence of all Denise's misdeeds over the years. I risked my life to find the truth.

With trembling hands, Simone opened the envelope. A stack of photos spilled out, revealing my brothers' beloved Denise in a secret meeting with the CEO of their corporate rival. They exchanged documents, including the very confidential files that had nearly bankrupted the Kline Group.

""Impossible!"" Sherman sprang to his feet. ""Denise... How could she...""

More photos lay scattered across the floor. They revealed how Denise tampered with my father, Farrell Kline's medicine, bribed a servant to frame me for theft, and conspired with Enoch's cousin to sabotage my engagement to Enoch.

Enoch picked up a photo, his face instantly drained of color. In the photo, Denise was smiling as she poured something into my cup. That night, I suddenly suffered ""food poisoning"" and nearly died.

""What... have we done to her?"" Dylan said, his voice trembling in anguish.

I floated above the crystal coffin, gazing down at my own peaceful form. How ironic. Now they finally knew who truly loved them, but it was far too late.

""Not too late at all,"" I whispered, though nobody could hear me. ""My vengeance has just begun.""

The air in the funeral hall grew thick with tension. Photos lay scattered across the floor like daggers, mercilessly ripping away the carefully crafted facade Denise had maintained for years.

Jayden was the first to react. His veins bulged as he gripped the photos. He barked, ""Get these checked immediately and see if they photoshopped!""

Dylan wiped his face and picked up several photos, examining them carefully. He said, ""No need for verification. They're real. The angles are covert, but the details are sharp. There's no sign of digital manipulation."" Even the usually composed lawyer's voice was trembling.

I sneered from above. Of course, they were real. I nearly died getting these photos.

""Impossible! Denise would never do something like this,"" Sherman shouted, his eyes blazing with denial. But as soon as his gaze landed on the photo of Denise tampering with Farrell's medicine bottle, his voice died in his throat.

Enoch stared at the photo of the poisoning. Suddenly, he spun around and bolted for the door.

Marcus grabbed his arm, stopping him in his tracks. ""Where the hell are you going?"" he demanded.

""I'm going to make that bitch pay!"" Enoch said, his eyes burning with terrifying fury.

Seeing them like this didn't bring me the relief I'd imagined. If only they had believed me earlier, even just once, and maybe things wouldn't have come to this.

Memories came flooding back like a tidal wave, taking me back to that day a year ago when I was first recognized and taken to the Kline residence.

# Chapter 2

A black stretch limo pulled up in front of the Kline residence. My fingers twisted the hem of my dress, and my palms were sweaty. Only after my adoptive parents, Dalton and Simone Yarwood, passed away did I discover the truth. I was the true heiress of the Kline Group and the long-lost member of the Kline family.

""Erika, we're home."" Farrell gave my shoulder a reassuring pat, his eyes filled with both remorse and hope.

The grand doors of the residence swung open, revealing my four brothers standing in perfect formation. My breath hitched. They looked so accomplished and so utterly untouchable.

Jayden was the current CEO of the Kline Group. He stood there with piercing, cold eyes and was impeccably dressed in a suit. With a slight nod, he said, ""Welcome home."" His voice was polite yet aloof.

Marcus, a renowned painter, had his long hair tied back in a messy bun. His charming eyes sized me up with a scrutinizing gaze. He remarked, ""So you grew up in a small town? Tell me. Can you even paint?""

Dylan adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses and offered a professional smile. ""I'm an attorney. For any legal matters, feel free to consult me.""

Sherman was about my age. He popped his gum and gave me a sidelong glance. ""So you're my real sister,"" he drawled.

Behind them, a girl in a white dress peeked out timidly. Farrell quickly introduced her to me. ""This is Denise. Though we now know she's not our daughter, we'll still raise her as our own.""

Denise dashed over and threw her arms around me. ""Welcome home, Erika!"" Her embrace was uncomfortably tight as she hissed in my ear, ""Don't even think about taking what's mine."" Her voice was low enough for only me to hear.

I froze when she finished speaking.

\*\*\*\*\*

At dinner, I felt like I was totally an outsider.

My brothers chatted about things beyond my understanding. They frequently burst into laughter at Denise's words. She cooed to Jayden, asking him to peel shrimp for her. Marcus immediately piled more food onto her plate. Dylan listened patiently as she prattled on about school, and Sherman even surrendered his dessert to her without a second thought.

""Erika, eat some more,"" Farrell said. He was the only one who noticed my silence.

I forced a smile, but Denise's gaze pierced through me. It was cold and sharp like a knife.

\*\*\*\*\*

That night, I overheard Jayden on the phone in his study. He said in a tired voice, ""The company's stock is still falling. If the loan isn't approved by next week...""

I wanted to do something to soothe him, so I dug out the special coffee recipe Simone had taught me, brewed a pot, and carefully carried it to the study.

Just as my hand was about to knock, Denise suddenly appeared from the side. ""Erika, still awake at this hour?"" she said, her voice deliberately loud. It instantly cut off the conversation inside the study.

""I made some coffee for Jayden,"" I murmured hesitantly.

""Oh, how thoughtful of you!"" Denise said. She flashed a sweet smile as she reached out. ""Let me deliver it for you.""

I instinctively dodged, but she suddenly shrieked and threw herself backward. Scalding coffee splashed on my hand, instantly reddening my skin.

The study door burst open as Jayden stormed out, demanding sharply, ""What the hell is going on here?""

Denise sat on the floor, tears springing to her eyes on cue. ""Maybe it was just an accident. Erika probably didn't mean it."" As she spoke, she showed the small red mark on her arm.

""What the hell did you do?"" Jayden shoved me aside and immediately crouched down to examine Denise's ""injury.""

I clutched my hand, which was far more severely scalded than hers. The pain rendered me speechless.

Farrell rushed over when he heard the commotion. ""Jayden, the company is already in enough trouble. Don't cause more problems at home.""

Jayden shot me an icy glare. ""Causing trouble right after you come back? You're just as uncultured as expected.""

My lips parted, but no sound came out. The pain in my hand was nothing compared to the ache tearing through my heart.

That night, I cried under the covers. It wasn't until the early hours that I finally crept out of bed and gently applied ointment to my burns.

In the mirror, I saw my eyes were swollen like overripe peaches, and my hand was dotted with blisters.

""Is this really my family?"" I whispered to my reflection in the mirror.

As I looked into the mirror, my gaze gradually hardened with resolve. ""No,"" I told myself firmly, ""they don't deserve to be my family.""

From that day on, I learned to mask my feelings and began watching Denise's every move from the shadows. She thought I was just a country bumpkin, but little did she know that I was quietly documenting every one of her schemes.

# Chapter 3

""Found her. Denise's at the Milinton Hotel!"" Sherman burst into the funeral hall with his phone in his hand. His voice brought me back to reality.

Without a second thought, Enoch bolted straight for the door. Jayden snatched up the car keys, with Marcus and Dylan hot on his heels. Their faces were contorted with a fury I'd never witnessed before.

I hovered above the coffin, watching their rushing figures disappear, and I murmured with a cold smile, ""Go on. See for yourselves what your doted-on Denise is really doing right now.""

My soul tagged along. There was no way that I would miss out on this show.

\*\*\*\*\*

The blisters on my hand took three full days to heal. During those three days, not a single family member came to see me, except for the housekeeper Marlene, who brought my meals.

""Erika, your meal is ready."" Marlene set the tray on the bedside table, her eyes full of quiet pity. In this household, even the housekeeper could tell who the favored one was.

""Thank you, Marlene."" I forced a weak smile. With my right hand still bandaged, I awkwardly scooped up food with my left hand.

Marlene hesitated, then finally sighed and said, ""Denise said you were unwell and needed complete rest.""

I clumsily spooned some porridge into my mouth.

Hearing what Marlene said, I sneered.

It was clear that Denise wanted everyone to ignore me.

After that incident, Farrell went on a business trip, leaving me without a single soul who would stand up for me.

The door suddenly swung open, and Denise swept in like a social butterfly. Her pristine white dress was spotless.

""Erika, are you feeling better?"" she said, her voice sickly sweet. Then she sat down on the edge of the bed and reached out to touch my bandage.

I recoiled. Her manicured nails looked nice, yet I was well aware of just how vicious those hands could be.

Denise was dismissive. Leaning in until her lips nearly brushed my ear, she whispered, ""You really think Dad can protect you forever? He's leaving for Topandia on business tomorrow, and he won't be back for a whole month.""

She flashed an innocent smile. ""This month, I'll show you who the real heiress is in this family.""

I tightened my grip on the spoon. ""Why do you have to be like this? We could have gotten along.""

""Get along?"" she scoffed, as if she'd just heard the most ridiculous joke. ""Do you have any idea how many years I've spent making everyone adore me? Why do you, a country bumpkin, think you can just waltz in and take what's mine?""

I looked her straight in the eye and said firmly, ""I want nothing but my family.""

""Family?"" Denise scoffed in disdain.

She added, ""They've been my family for a long time now. Jayden peels shrimp for me. Marcus teaches me how to paint. Dylan tutors me, and Sherman follows me around all day.""

She stood up, looking down at me. ""As for Enoch, he's promised to marry me ever since we were kids.""

That was the first time I had heard Enoch's name.

Denise seemed delighted by my reaction. She said, ""Oh, you didn't know? You and Enoch are engaged. It was arranged by our grandparents."" With a triumphant twirl, she added, ""But don't worry. This engagement will soon be mine.""

After she left, I couldn't take another bite. No one had told me about the engagement.

\*\*\*\*\*

That afternoon, I removed the bandages. The skin on my hand was still red, though the pain had eased. Feeling suffocated by staying cooped up in my room, I decided to take a stroll in the garden instead.

The Kline residence's huge garden was alive with vibrant roses. As I bent down to breathe in their fragrance, footsteps suddenly approached.

""Oh, Denise, there you are,"" a man said.

I turned and saw a strange man standing on the garden path. He wore a charcoal-gray suit. His face was chiseled, and his features were sharp and angular. When our eyes met, he visibly froze for a moment.

""You're not Denise,"" he said.

I stood up, brushing the grass off my skirt. ""I'm Erika, her sister.""

He gave me an appraising look. ""So, you're the Kline family's long-lost heiress?"" he said coolly. ""I'm Enoch Leblanc. Nice to meet you.""

I finally saw Enoch, the man Denise claimed would marry her. I didn't know what to say. All I could do was give a nod.

""Where's Denise?"" he asked, his tone noticeably softening.

""I'm not sure. Maybe inside,"" I replied.

Enoch frowned. ""She told me to meet in the garden at three."" He checked his watch, his expression darkening. ""It's already twenty past three.""

I shrugged. ""Maybe she got the time wrong?""

""Impossible. Denise is never late,"" Enoch said flatly, as if I'd just slandered Denise.

Just as the awkward silence dragged on, Denise's voice rang out from behind. ""Enoch, I'm so sorry I'm late!"" She trotted over and immediately linked arms with Enoch in an intimate gesture. ""I was baking a cake for Erika. I wanted to surprise her, and I completely lost track of time.""

Enoch's expression instantly softened. He said tenderly, ""You're always so thoughtful.""

Denise flashed a sweet smile and then ""suddenly"" noticed my hand. ""Does it still hurt, Erika? I was so worried about you that day,"" she said, reaching out to grab my hand. I instinctively dodged.

My movement was unmistakable. Enoch's gaze turned icy in an instant. ""Erika, is that how you respond to your sister's concern?""

I opened my mouth, but words failed me. Should I say, ""She was actually aiming for my wound?""

""It's alright,"" Denise said in a kind voice. ""She just got home, and she isn't used to things yet."" Turning to Enoch, she added, ""Let's go to the gazebo. I made your favorite macaroons just for you.""

Enoch gave a curt nod. Before leaving, he shot me an icy glare.

I bit my lower lip as I watched their retreating figures. It had only been a few days, and Denise had already succeeded in turning everyone against me.

# Chapter 4

Back in my room, I pulled a new notebook from the drawer, and on the first page, I carefully wrote down the date and every misdeed Denise had committed.

My adoptive father, Dalton Yarwood, once told me that when the enemy was too powerful, one should keep a record of their every move and wait for the perfect moment to strike back.

""Denise,"" I whispered under my breath, ""you think I'm some pushover, but you're dead wrong.""

\*\*\*\*\*

That night, laughter and chatter drifted up from downstairs.

Peeking through the stair railings, I saw Enoch and Denise sitting on the sofa, surrounded by my four brothers. Denise was playing the piano while Enoch gazed at her tenderly.

Sherman was the first to spot me. He called out cheerfully, ""Hey, Erika. You came downstairs. Want to join us and listen to Denise play the piano?""

All eyes suddenly turned to me. Denise's smile faltered for a brief instant before she plastered on an even brighter grin. She urged, ""Yes, Erika, come sit next to me.""

""No thanks,"" I said, taking a step back. ""I've got a bit of a headache. I'll turn in early.""

""Wait,"" Marcus called out to me. ""There's an art exhibition tomorrow. The whole family's going. Why don't you come along?""

I looked up in surprise. This was the first time Marcus had ever invited me to a place.

""Sure—"" I said.

""Denise's friend is coming, too,"" Sherman cut in excitedly. ""None other than the supermodel Lillian!""

It dawned on me instantly.

Marcus only invited me because Denise's friend was coming.

""But I might not be feeling well tomorrow,"" I murmured softly.

Dylan adjusted his glasses. ""Suit yourself,"" he said, his impatience barely concealed.

Enoch didn't even glance my way. His eyes stayed glued to Denise the entire time.

As I ascended upstairs, I heard Denise ""whisper"", ""Don't blame Erika. She's probably just not used to gatherings like this.""

""She's just a country bumpkin. I bet she has never seen anything this fancy, huh?"" Enoch's clear voice rang out.

My nails dug deep into my palms, but I felt no pain. At that moment, it finally hit me just how dire my situation was.

Back in my room, I added a few more lines to my notebook and then carefully slid it beneath the mattress.

The cold moonlight streamed in through the window. I told myself, ""Erika, starting today, you must learn to stand up for yourself.""

\*\*\*\*\*

Three weeks into Farrell's trip to Topandia, I finally made a shocking discovery.

Late that night, I went downstairs for water. As I passed by Farrell's study, I caught faint noises coming from inside.

Who was in his study this late?

I crept closer on tiptoe. The door stood slightly ajar, and a thin beam of light seeped through the gap.

Through the crack in the door, I saw Denise standing at Farrell's desk with her back to me. She was holding a small medicine bottle, adding some suspicious substance to it. My breath hitched. Instinctively, I pulled out my phone and quietly snapped a few photos.

""Who's there?"" Denise snapped, whipping around.

I hurriedly hid around the corner of the hallway. My heart pounded as her footsteps drew nearer. Just then, the sound of the front door opening came from downstairs. Jayden was back.

Denise stopped, and then I heard the study door click shut. Only then did I finally let out the breath I'd been holding. I slipped quietly back to my room. Only after locking the door did I dare to check the photos on my phone.

The angle wasn't perfect, but the photo clearly captured Denise pouring suspicious white powder into the medicine bottle.

Farrell had high blood pressure and needed to take his medication daily.

What was Denise doing? I stared at the photo, my hands trembling uncontrollably.

This was way too serious. I thought I must tell Jayden about it immediately.",1,1752321172.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

The poison is deadly, and my days are numbered.","Six months ago, I was accidentally poisoned by wolfsbane. The poison is deadly, and my days are numbered.

My body gradually weakens.

Today, my wolf is completely gone, and I have three days left to live.

On the last day before I draw my final breath, I agree to donate my kidney to my sister. Thrilled, my mate swears that he'll make it up to me someday.

My sister is being swamped with insults on the college forum after she was caught plagiarizing my Belladonna thesis.

But I come forward and claim that I'm the one who plagiarized it.

Mom and Dad are pleased, saying I've finally become mature.

At last, I've become the perfect mate and daughter in their eyes.

But why are they crying after my body has turned cold and lifeless?

Chapter 1

When I found out I was going to die, I accepted it with ease.

My mate, Simon Knightley, came to me with a sullen expression and said, ""Zora, Laila has been in poor health since birth. She's an Omega with the weakest healing ability.

""One of her kidneys is failing, and she needs a transplant to survive.""

He pulled out a Mate Bond Breaking Agreement to dissolve our mate bond. After hesitating for a long while, he gritted his teeth and said, ""Your kidney is the best match for Laila. But if you refuse to donate your kidney, you'll have to sign this agreement to break our mate bond.

""Laila doesn't have much time left… And she wants to experience the marking ceremony before she dies. After talking to your parents, they agreed that I should be the one to do it.

""I love you, Zora. We're only doing this to make sure Laila doesn't die with regrets.

""Once she's gone, we'll get back together. Okay?""

I stared at the agreement in Simon's hands. Ever since Laila Thorne's kidney failure, everyone in my family had been expecting me to donate my kidney to her.

But what they didn't know was—I only had one kidney left.

When they found out I refused to donate, they were utterly disappointed. They kept saying how ungrateful I was.

""Zora, your sister's dying. All she needs is your kidney to survive. How can you just stand by and watch her die?""

My parents wouldn't listen to my explanation. Instead, they kicked me out.

""An ingrate like you doesn't deserve to be part of this family. If you won't save Laila, then get out!""

And now, even my mate was forcing me to either donate the kidney or he'd mark Laila instead.

But I was dying anyway. At this point, what difference would it make?

""I agree,"" I said airily.

Stunned, Simon jerked his head up. ""Really? That's amazing! Laila has a chance now!""

He tore the agreement and hurried me to the healing hut.

Mom and Dad also received the news. They arrived soon after, and Mom threw her arms around Laila and wept. ""Laila, you have a chance now! You'll be able to stay with me forever…""

Afraid that I'd change my mind, Dad quickly had the healer bring over the surgical consent form.

Once I signed it, my parents finally relaxed.

""Zora, you've finally matured,"" Dad said. ""You're starting to care for your sister. Don't blame us for being biased, okay? Laila's been through so much—she needs our love.

""But we won't mistreat you either. You'll still get your part of the inheritance.""

I shook my head, swallowing the bitterness in my chest. ""Just give it all to Laila. I won't need it anyway.""

Momentarily stunned, Mom patted me and chided, ""What nonsense are you talking about? Of course, you'll need it!

""Even if your mate is the top warrior in the Lunaris pack and can give you a comfortable life, you can't just disregard your family inheritance.""

Slowly, I slipped into a daze.

Ever since I failed to show up for Dad's kidney transplant surgery five years ago and Laila donated hers instead, my family hadn't been this kind to me.

And it was precisely because she had saved Dad that my parents insisted I owed her and that I had to treat her even better.

From then on, Laila got the best of everything.

She also started targeting me by falsely accusing me, making Mom and Dad resent me even more. Eventually, no matter what I did, it was always wrong.

I used to defend myself. Now, I just stayed quiet.

Then Mom rushed to Laila's side, and Dad and Simon followed close behind.

They all surrounded her, and it was the perfect picture of a loving family.

Only I stood alone in the corner, like an outsider who didn't belong.

Chapter 2

My eyes stung.

Rubbing my eyes roughly, I turned to leave, but Simon stopped me at the door.

""Laila has to stay at the healing hut for treatment, and she won't be able to finish her Werewolf Academy thesis,"" he said. ""Aren't you working on the Belladonna Cure thesis? It's exactly the same as Laila's. Why not let her refer to yours?""

A pang of bitterness hit me. I knew there was more to his words.

Laila's health had always been fragile, so I had always done her Werewolf Academy homework for her. She had even asked me to cheat for her in exams.

She didn't want my grades to surpass hers, yet through plagiarizing my work, she became the top student in the Werewolf Academy.

In truth, she hadn't even started her thesis yet. She was just waiting to copy mine.

Noticing my silence, Mom spoke in a low voice. ""You know how bright Laila is. It's just her health… You're her sister. Help her out, okay?""

I had heard this over and over again for the past five years, and I should've been used to it by now. But every time those words echoed in my ears, my chest tightened.

I forced a smile and nodded. ""Alright. I'll go get it now.""

This was the last time. I wondered if Laila could still graduate smoothly without someone to plagiarize from after I was gone.

""I knew you'd say yes!"" Simon exclaimed. ""So when I left home, I brought your thesis with me.""

He quickly pulled it from his bag and handed it to Laila.

Laila stuck her tongue out at me, a smug smile on her face.

Gently stroking her hair, Simon bent down and whispered something in her ear. She flushed and shot him a glare.

I said nothing and watched their intimate interaction.

If my wolf hadn't been killed by wolfsbane, it would've been howling with rage inside me.

I turned and left the healing hut. Laughter echoed behind me, but no one stopped me this time. Perhaps they hadn't even noticed I had left.

I went back home. As I gazed at the cozy interior, I suddenly made up my mind.

I wanted to clear all my belongings. Since no one seemed to care about me at all, I'd just discard everything about myself. After all, I didn't want my things to be a burden.

I packed everything—including my clothes, daily necessities, my pictures, the gifts I'd bought for my family and Simon—and threw them in the trash outside.

I was completely exhausted, and my breathing grew labored. The wolfsbane had taken hold of my body, and with every movement, a wave of excruciating pain shot through me.

I was really dying.

It took hours before I regained some strength. Just as I got into bed and was about to sleep, Simon barged in.

Flanking a crying Laila, Mom and Dad hurried after him.

""Zora, you promised to give Laila your thesis. How could you collude with others and accuse your sister of plagiarism?"" Simon questioned, his eyes thick with disappointment.

""Zora, I understand that you're upset about me borrowing your thesis."" Laila sobbed. ""But how could you ask your supervisor to publicly criticize me online? I've been swarmed with insults! You're so cruel!""

""Zora, we're family. How could you do this to your sister?"" Mom chimed in disapprovingly.

Turning back to Laila, Mom patted her back gently and cooed, ""Don't cry, sweetheart. You'll hurt yourself. I'll make your sister apologize to you!""

Chapter 3

So it turned out after getting my thesis, Laila flaunted it on the academy's forum.

Unfortunately, my supervisor saw the post.

He had always held high expectations for me, even offering to help revise my thesis before. So the moment Laila uploaded it online, he sensed something was off.

He questioned her about the details, but she couldn't answer a single thing.

The people online immediately realized something was wrong.

How could someone fail to answer questions about their own thesis?

Accusations of plagiarism came flooding in.

""Laila's been so devastated that she fainted from crying several times,"" Simon boomed. ""Zora, you're her sister. How could you do this to her? Apologize to her now!""

Ignoring how pale I looked, he dragged me out of bed and shoved me in front of Laila.

My thoughts wandered. Why had he grown so close to her?

Five years ago, after my family disowned me, I had trudged through a downpour, drenched to the bone.

Then Simon appeared.

The moment I saw him, my wounded wolf stirred with hope. I could feel that he was my predestined mate.

He brought me home, gave me clean clothes, a steaming cup of coffee, and sat beside me as I poured out my heartbreak.

He pitied me, swearing he'd treat me well for the rest of my life.

Back then, he had loathed Laila. He never met her, but he despised anyone who hurt me.

But when had things started to change?

Was it when Laila began hovering around him, acting sweet like a lover? Was it when she clung to him during our dates, or when they started texting each other over the phone for long hours?

My lover had become the knight of the person I resented most.

I thought I could handle the pain, but it still hurt.

Now that I was dying, I could've just let them have whatever they wanted.

""It's my fault for putting you in this mess. I'll clear your name by telling them that I was the one who plagiarized your work,"" I said.

The moment I apologized, they were stunned. They hadn't expected me to be this obedient.

""You've really started to care for your sister,"" Mom said, her gaze turning complicated. ""I'm glad that you two are finally looking out for each other.""

""Zora, you've finally matured,"" Dad chimed in. ""If you keep this up, your mom and I will surely dote on you!""

Guilt flickered in Simon's eyes.

""You're my mate, so I'll surely take care of you,"" he said, trying to comfort me. ""Even if you can't continue your studies at the Werewolf Academy, you can still live comfortably.""

I tried to smile through the pallor.

However, the future Simon spoke of didn't exist for me anymore. At this point, their love and affection were luxuries I could no longer afford.

Laila turned on the camera and began recording.

""This thesis was written by me at home…"" she sobbed. ""I never thought my sister would claim it as her own.""

As she spoke, she turned the camera toward me.

Dad, Mom, and Simon all watched closely, as if afraid I might slip.

Forcing a smile, I said, ""Laila's right. I plagiarized her work and told my supervisor it was mine. I'm sorry.""

Everyone exhaled in relief.

Laila quickly uploaded the video to the academy's forum. Soon, waves of criticism and insults crashed down on me.

Pretending to be noble, she stepped in at the perfect time to defend me. ""Guys, stop it. No matter what, she's my sister. I've already forgiven her.""

While no one else was looking, she turned to me with a cold, victorious glare and hissed, ""You have no right to compete with me. Mom, Dad, and even Simon are all mine. You don't deserve to be loved by any of them.""

Chapter 4

Laila and I were twins, but ever since we were kids, she'd always resented me.

She hated sharing her things with me. So she stole our parents' attention, my toys, my dresses—even though she had the exact same ones.

She wanted anything I laid my eyes on.

Back then, Mom and Dad treated us equally. I had everything Laila had, and they often lectured her for taking my things.

But since what had happened five years ago, they poured all their heart and soul into Laila. They thought I was selfish for not visiting Dad when he was hospitalized.

So whenever we got into an argument after that, they always took Laila's side.

""How could you bully your sister?"" was what they often told me.

After feuding with her for so many years, I was indeed the one who lost. I could no longer be at odds with her anymore.

""Yeah, you won,"" I said softly.

The kidney transplant surgery would take place in two hours, and I was about to die.

Given how deep the wolfsbane was already in my system, my soul would also be shattered by the time the Dragonbone scalpel sliced open my body.

What would be left was only my lifeless body.

By then, would Mom, Dad, and Simon weep for me?

Perhaps not. For an eyesore like me to leave, they'd probably be overjoyed. After all, Laila was the apple of their eye.

Before surgery, Mom, Dad, and Simon huddled around Laila, comforting and encouraging her.

""Laila, don't be scared. We'll be waiting for you outside,"" Dad said in a tone so gentle that I'd never heard before. ""The surgery will definitely be successful. You'll become healthy in no time.""

""After your recovery, I'll make you your favorite dishes,"" Mom chimed in lovingly.",1,1752321089.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

I got tired of the “Anyone up for…?” messages that die in group chats, so I spent a few nights hacking together a little iOS app called **Joynme**.

*What it does*

1. You post whatever you’re about to do; walk in a park, coffee somewhere, film night at the eye museum.
2. You can select how many people do you want to join you, (1, 2 or max 3). you can also specify some more details about the cost and what not.
3. People within \~50 km see it and can request to join.
4. On approval, a mini chat opens so you can sort details and meet up.

This is still a **public beta**, dark-mode only, and rough around the edges, exactly why I’d love some local fellas who can try it and tell me what works well and what sucks.

App is only available for iOS now, will be available for android pretty soon.

The tiers are quite arbitrary and the overall quality of their discography is so high that the D-Tier songs are more ""least good"" songs rather than bad. It would be pretty boring to list everything as A or S tier though. For this list, S-tier are my favourites, A-tier are songs I would often go out of my way to listen, B-tier are songs I would sometimes go out of my way to listen to, and D-tier songs that I would consider skipping if they ended up on a playlist.

As seen by the average positions of songs below, I enjoyed the Plagiarism/Creation era the most. They start adding a more jazzy sound, guitar tone and I think the general production sounds better, Suis starts using her low voice more, the songs are all memorable compared to the earlier album where some of the B-sides can blend into each other

Summer Grass: 35.8

Loser Doesn't Need an Encore: 36.8

That's Why I Gave Up on Music: 40.6

Elma: 36.9

Plagiarism: 23.4

Magic Lantern: 38.7

I thanked him and then the next day I brought him a coffee and he smiled at me and he was like thank you and ever since then whenever he sees me, he smiles and waves at me. It's been happening so frequently and yesterday I bought chocolate because I wanted to talk to him and he asked me how I was and then we just talked a little and I asked him what his name was and he said his name and he asked what's your name I said my name and he repeated my name and unfortunately there was a customer behind me so I couldn't stay for long.
I really want to take things further with him but I'm still not quite whether he's interested... He appears very shy with me so idk 😭😭",1,1752321011.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1lxyjoh,https://www.reddit.com/r/mounjarouk/comments/1lxyjoh/food_expense_reality/,Food expense reality,"So, I finally sat down to calculate my preMJ food expense. The best month to take is April because I was travelled nonstop in May and June, so those do not count.

In April, as a single person, I spend £277 on groceries and eating out.

We are now almost halfway through July and I am now on Mounjaro. I have only spent, so far, £101. Even if I end up spending the same, which I doubt, for the rest of July, I will still have saved money.

What I noticed?

Takeaways and eating out are rare since I started MJ. Not because I have prevented myself, I just know I will not enjoy it. It is a waste of money cos I cannot finish meals anyway. The most I have done is get a coffee from Café Nerro.

How are your food expenses looking like?",4,1752320966.0,mounjarouk,3,1.0,False
1lxyjob,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1lxyjob/supporting_a_friend_alcohol/,Supporting a friend (alcohol),"I have a friend who I’ve known on and off for about 20 years.  We met at work and we both liked to go out for after work drinks on a Friday and to be fair, we were usually the ones doing shots, last ones standing at the end of the night.

I grew out of that 20 something lifestyle and settled down and had a child.  My child is now 15 and I’m separated.  Old friend and I reconnected via social media about a year or so ago.

She’s a mess now though, with alcohol.  I’ve only just realised how bad it is.  She keeps a water bottle with her at all times, it’s got vodka and squash in it.  She’s been to stay a couple of times but she often dozes off on the sofa.  If we go out for dinner, she falls over a lot.  Last week she was coming back from Spain, tripped at the airport and they wouldn’t let her on the flight.  I often get rambling messages from her.

I don’t really know what to do.  I don’t really want her to come and stay because of my teenager.  But I’m happy to meet her half way (she lives about an hour away on a direct train) without my daughter.  But if we go for drinks I feel like I’m enabling her but she has no interest in things like a walk or a museum visit or coffee and cake.

I’d like to support her but I also have a teen and a full time job.  She’s asked if she can come and stay tomorrow but I’ve said I’m not well.   She would be more than welcome to join my daughter and I on our hike tomorrow but I really don’t think she could manage it because I’m concerned she would fall, so that’s why I’ve said I’m not well.  I know she is lonely but I’m not sure what to do.

1lxyja5,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1lxyja5/saturday_morning_coffee_thoughts/,Saturday morning coffee thoughts…,"First off, brown sugar shaken espresso coffee creamer is delicious. Picked it up yesterday, and let me tell you—it’s all sorts of deliciousness in the mouth.

Started the day with that familiar “ready to go” energy… below the waist. I tried the classic move—gentle snuggles, kisses, a little hair stroking—but all I got in return was, “Are you walking the dog this morning?” And just like that, my morning was off and running.

Don’t get me wrong—taking our wild golden retriever out for a stroll is always fun. But if I had to choose between dog walking and a more… exciting start to the day, I’d pick something more explosive than tasty coffee creamer.

Anyway, happy weekend, folks! Hope you all have something good lined up.

As for me—Lord Huron “night we met” is playing, the coffee’s hot, the sun is out, and I’m chilling on the patio while the doggo is out there tormenting the birds. Later I’ve got a thrilling trio of errands: Costco, Target, and Trader Joe’s. Try not to get jealous.

Not entirely sure what the point of this post is—maybe just processing another “dead bedroom” kind of day. But the coffee is still great, the dog still loves ear scratches, the sun’s still shining, I beat my kid at basketball yesterday, and tonight might just be a taco and margarita night.

Still plenty of reasons to smile today….",8,1752320932.0,DeadBedrooms,3,1.0,False

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 15-20 people turning up.*

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

*No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

*We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious*

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

**Is this happening today?**

*Is today Monday?*

*Yes: Yes! It'll be today\*\**

*No: Nope, try next Monday\*\**

**Aww, I missed this when is the next one?**

Monday\*\*

\*\* we meet on public holidays, but if Monday falls on Christmas or New Years Day we'll likely skip those.

[Initial meetup.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/oudzf/300112_hammersmith_drinks/)

**Location/Time:** [Latymers, W6 8BS](http://www.latymershammersmith.co.uk/) / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19.30ish. There are usually a few people left when the pub closes - usually 23:00

Our tables are reserved, we start on the circular tables close to the entrance and we might spill over onto the table(s) nearby. There is no need to book a space/get a ticket.

The first table will either be outside or at the front to the right of the door. (also, there will be Reddit on the reserved signs [And hopefully Snoo](https://i.imgur.com/KIm6pYs.jpg)). The bar staff also know who we are if you're not sure.

There's a (usually quiet) optional Whatsapp group for the meetup - message me via chat for an invite link. (whatsapp group is pretty much only me posting this link each week and trying to get people to actually respond.. So no benefit of being in it if you're not showing up).

* Woke up and had some puppy cuddles 
* Took pups for a walk 
* Went out for brunch which wasn’t the best I’ve had but wasn’t at all bad either. The coffee was… I’ve had better. And then we ran some errands - mum, dad, pups & I. I took him for another little walk while they were in some shops too. It was funny watching mum walk out of the shop laden with like six big pillows. 
* Then we went home and did the crossword. 
* I haven’t done a lot else 
* Then mum and dad went out and I made an apple crumble as a surprise for dad when they get home as he was saying he really fancied one, I also made for my dinner bolognese which was delicious. I did it from scratch - roasting tomatoes and garlic and all of that first. I never use jar sauces anyway but I just mean I didn’t use a jar of passata. It was *delightful*. 
* I’m currently watching under the Tuscan sun and the fire is going and I’m keeping it burning :) 
* Now I’m watching howls moving castle. I’ve watched it several times and I still find myself slightly confused for a bit towards the end every time. I love Sophie. And heeeeeeen! 

I have nothing much to say. 

Ummmmmmmm. 

I have a tiny little spot and I have nothing to use on it up here so I’m breaking skincare law and I put a smidge of toothpaste on it. Let’s see if I wake up to it mostly gone or it having gone agro. 

Lots of puppy cuddles :)

1lxyed9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Situationships/comments/1lxyed9/why_wont_he_just_let_a_sleeping_dog_lie/,Why won’t he just let a sleeping dog lie,"LONG READ, sorry you know what these guys do to our heads lol!

Background, I’m 26f and he’s 39m. We hungout everyday for a month and would cuddle and have s*x, which was amazing. He even took me out in public with him and bought me lunch and coffee LOL. We went grocery shopping together and thrifting. He would never kiss me though and that was rly frustrating for me because I’m huge on that, I should have known he wasn’t feeling me like he said he was. 

Anyway, there were a few days where it just felt like he was avoiding hanging out with me or talking to me much, so I kind of crashed out and was like don’t make me feel like a pest for wanting to see you, if you’re not interested in me anymore then just say that instead of making me look stupid. THEN he was like “I’m sorry, I just don’t have the time and energy you seem to require” and “you’re just going so fast and the intensity is too much” WHEN I WAS MATCHING HIS DAMN PACE. Like rly went from if we weren’t together him texting me I miss you why are you not holding me rn, to just doing a complete 180. 

That hurt me bad, I took it very rough, but after that, he still wouldn’t leave me alone. Even after I blocked him on basically everything but text, he was like “Nice meeting you I guess” and I said “You too, I hope you find what you’re looking for” and then the next morning I wake up to him having liked me on a dating app. He would send me game requests and I’d let them expire so he’d send another one, just to keep me on the hook. We had sex one more time because I said ok let’s just be friends bc I do enjoy your personality & dick LOL you guys know I was hoping we’d be friends and then he’d realize what he was missing out on (dumb, bad mistake).

Anyway I found out I was kind of a rebound because his ex girlfriend added me on Facebook and I saw old posts from like 8 months ago of her saying he was being insane bc they broke up. So that situation drove him mad and then he found me I guess. I called him out on using me as a rebound and he basically just said “wow wtf” LOL. And then we didn’t talk for a few days and I deleted his number and text thread so that I wouldn’t be tempted to talk to him at all. I thought it was rly over and that he was just flippant towards me and annoyed whenever I would talk to him.

Well, last night he texts me at 11 saying “Let’s go to the casino” …. LIKE DUDE just stop hitting my line if you don’t want me, why can’t you just leave me alone?????

I'm basically going through a rough patch again in life but I'll bounce back as always 

I'm looking for what I mentioned above. ⬆️

Maybe we just need a friendly chat , who try to understand and listen making connections where you wouldn't think of one to occur.

A few things about me.

*I love music production and anything to do with it 
/( Yes I know everyone but music as a bullet point in interests.

But it's worthwhile to mention I do like to play and learn guitar.
Etc. etc . Lol

* I absolutely Love reading and watching Horror movies.. I gravitate towards slashers and psychological thriller. Suspense is just oxygen to me lol.

Books yes . Dogs or cats ?  Dogs here 

Cooking .. hell yes 🤤 
I don't play much games nowadays. I love black coffee/ Americano
I do like racing games and some fighting games. Mostly fallout and Mortal Kombat Mobile.
Mental health advocate/ empathetic 
Physical fitness .  So so

Not because anyone's asking me to, but because that's who I am.

Shortly after, I took an hour to scrub the kitchen drawers out by myself, made them like new, and I never heard a peep about it. Lol. And that's who she is. She's twice my age, which really highlights the immaturity. Well into July, I haven't seen her cleaning anything else but her own room. The other roommate has some self-awareness and vacuums the shared areas like once a month, so that's cool, but floors still need to be washed. The third one works nights, comes home to snore in his room for the day, and doesn't clean a thing.

I scrub both bathrooms weekly. I also sweep the floors of the shared areas everyday, and wash them every Saturday or Sunday when everyone's away. I make extra sure the floor in front of everyone's doors are spotless. Do away with the coffee stains, hairs and such. Same with the bathroom mirrors, bowls, tub and all. I'll let these people get really comfortable and lulled in the magical, self-cleaning home. You know why? Because once I move out to live alone in a couple of months, they'll see it. They'll have to face their filthy selves. And I won't be around to suffer either the explosion of filth or the fights that are going to ensue over who's going to clean.

This might sound petty or like something I should just move on from, but I just can't. my MIL was always kind of off to me. I wouldn't say we had a bad relationship, but she wasn't very welcoming or interested. When I got engaged she didn't seem happy for us. I didn't include her in wedding planning much because we weren't close. MIL's mom asked me to so I included her in one thing and she didn't speak the whole time.

I stored my dress at their house. FIL said it was ok. Then I got the call a couple of days before the wedding that she had cut the dress into a million pieces. I literally felt like I was going to throw up. In my mind no one could be that evil and the dress was fixable, so we went over there and no, she legit cut it into a million pieces. I really think if my husband didn't hold me back, I would have fought her. We still got married but I had to wear a cheap replacement and I couldn't stop crying the entire morning, so it was ruined for me.

MIL said she did it because she didn't get a wedding, and because she never got ""her turn"" and nothing was ever about her. She didn't seem to feel bad. She seemed kind of in shock she had done it, but no remorse. Trigger warning----- the day after she did it she attempted suicide and was brought to the hospital. She got 30 day impatient and I don't know details but her dad was arrested because of something she said. FIL was also taken in for questioning but released, and she filed for divorce the day she got out.

MIL and I are pretty much no contact, but i occasionally see her at family events. She apologized once but didn't seem sorry and when my husband said he didn't want to talk to her she didn't seem to care. She no longer talks to my husband or her daughter, but like I said we see her occasionally, and i've heard she was in intense therapy for about a year.

She just got engaged and the ring is huge and gorgeous, guy seems perfect, and I am just so overwhelmed by how much I hate her and how angry I am. People keep saying it wasn't her fault, she was sick, but I'm at the point where I don't even care.

[**Update: My MIL cut up my wedding dress. We talked in person for the first and last time. I don't feel much better but I got some clarity.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/vfhcWJRVBE) - DATE OF POST 

[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/o6mb16/my_mil_cut_up_my_wedding_dress_i_hate_her_so_much/)

 I was shocked by how much the last post blew up and how much empathy I got. I thought a lot more people would say suck it up, it was only a dress. Truly thank you, and I am looking into booking a therapy appointment to talk about how much anger I have over this.

A couple people pointed out that if I wanted to know why MIL’s dad had been arrested, I could look it up online. I wasn’t aware of how easy it was to find that stuff, so my husband and I discussed it and we both wanted peace of mind. I looked it up and it was not what I was expecting at all. I’m not going to go into too many details, because if someone recognizes this it is not my story to tell, it is MILs, but pretty much she was forced and potentially sold into marrying FIL. We both immediately felt sick because we let FIL and MIL’s mom around our toddler son. We are still close to FIL and our son adores him. I really felt like for my son’s sake I needed clarity.

I asked the cousin MIL was close to, if she could convey to MIL that we had some questions and wanted to talk (MIL has blocked us on everything and changed her number) I mentioned that I tried looking her up on social media and couldn’t find her. The cousin told me it is because MIL took her new husband’s name, which I didn’t know they were married, and her cousin started talking about how beautiful the wedding was. I had originally heard they were going to elope, but she said that was because MIL thought it was tacky to have a wedding past 30, but he convinced her she should have that wedding she always wanted. It really did feel like a punch to the gut and I know I have a lack of will power, but when the cousin brought out her phone, I didn’t stop her. I vowed it would be the last picture of her I ever looked at, and then seeing her in her white dress just really hit me that it isn’t fair. I don’t know what I expected, she modeled for a long time, she works in high end fashion, but the wedding pictures were gorgeous and it really pissed me off.

Anyway the cousin let me use her phone. I told MIL what was going on and that I needed clarity and to know exact details of who was safe around my son. MIL agreed to meet up. I felt my heart sink, but I thought maybe I would get closure. We met at a coffee place. They were already there when we walked in and the first thing out of MIL’s mouth was that she still wants to be no contact and she just wants to be abundantly clear that there will not be a relationship. Fine, we didn’t want one either.

MIL answered my questions. It was really hard but GMIL and FIL can’t see our son anymore. They just can’t. I don’t think they are safe people, and MIL provided evidence for the stuff she was saying, which honestly made me sad for her because I never doubted. MIL then brought up the wedding dress on her own. She said she snapped because it was another thing she was forced to pay for and she was tired of working so hard so everyone else could have things she couldn’t. She felt that we watched and “aided” in her abuse, which I don’t think is fair because there were a lot of red flags, but a lot of stuff we didn’t know about. Pretty much all of this abuse was a way to keep her under control so her parents and FIL could take her money, and MIL did not want to pay for the things she did for her kids, such as weddings, cars, and a house for SIL. She brought up that she never got “her turn” because she was drugged and sedated when she married FIL, she never got to do stuff like proms or birthday parties because of modeling, and she said cutting the dress was cathartic.

My husband pretty much told her to shut up, because he knew it was upsetting me. MIL’s husband pointed out that we pulled up in a car she bought and said we are both pieces of shit for still driving it. MIL was quiet for a little while and just put her head down on him, it was super awkward and I wanted to leave. Finally her husband said that it is kind of funny because everyone got what they deserved, she finally got her wedding, and I know he was implying we got what we deserved. He asked if she wanted to go, she said yes, and walked out without saying goodbye to my husband.

On one hand I understand that MIL did not agree to have him and views him as something she was forced to do, so her parents could control her money, but it makes me mad that she acts like he was a partner in this crime. We are going to have to cut a lot of people out. There are a lot of details I didn’t share and they just aren’t safe people. What happened to MIL is like something out of a horror movie, they all know but gaslit her for years. Honestly I wish her the best in the sense that she deserves a life, and I know a lot of people are skeptical about the new husband, but he seemed very sincere. I wish her the best in life, but I’m pissed she got the wedding after she ruined mine. I told the cousin that I do not want anymore updates, and for my mental health I will no longer attend events she is at.

> Okay so you know how before we said your feelings were valid. Well they are but human trafficking is a little more valid.

**Deleted user**

> She was trafficked.  I honestly don’t find your situation to be very sympathetic.  I was totally on your side with the last post but there was a lot you didn’t know, and a lot you *left out*.  You couldn’t pay for anything and the woman who was sex trafficked snapped.  Maybe get some fucking perspective?  I think you’re making a situation that’s much bigger than you to be all about how you’ve been supposedly wronged.  Except I don’t feel that bad for you.  And it sounds like you did enable this even if you didn’t know about every single part.

> You’re entitled.  She was raped, trafficked, made to pay for your things.  You lost a dress you didn’t even pay for.  You’re driving the car she bought you.  How old are you?  Are you a victim of child marriage or can you legally work?  I’d be giving things *back* but I guess you can’t afford to not live off of THE SEX TRAFFICKING VICTIM.  If this is real, (probably isn’t) I don’t know how you can feel ok with how you’ve behaved.  You are being a child.  

> You barely even touch how your husband is feeling with all this.  But honestly he doesn’t seem that bothered, so maybe he’s a bit like his dad, and you don’t have much to talk about there.  “I’m so mad the sex trafficking victim got her consensual wedding.  She’s a model and I’m mad she looks pretty.”  Maybe you aren’t old enough to work, in which case I take some of this back.

> Grow up.  Your husband telling her to shut up is disgusting.  Why can’t you do your dream ceremony?  Is she supposed to pay for it?  You’re too good for her but not too good for all her stuff.

> You and your husband seem like awful, awful people.  Good for her for leaving you two behind.  Says a lot you’d want to go down the aisle in a dress from rape money and then whine about not getting it.  A normal human being would have been glad to not wear that dress. You should probably, like, get a job or something.  I’m honestly happy your wedding was shit.  It’s not justice but it’s getting there.

1lxy3qa,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedAtHome/comments/1lxy3qa/does_the_nespresso_pixie_espresso_machine_deliver/,Does the Nespresso Pixie Espresso Machine Deliver on Flavor and Design?,"Finding a reliable espresso machine that fits seamlessly into a small kitchen without occupying half the countertop often feels like hunting for a needle in a haystack. That’s precisely why the Nespresso Pixie Espresso Machine EN127BL piqued my interest. Promising high performance in a sleek, compact form, this little powerhouse seemed like the ultimate combination of aesthetic and functionality. After using this machine for a while, I’m going to share all the highs and lows I’ve found, along with how it stacks up against the competition.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Right off the bat, the design is what grabs attention. Compact and stylish with hammered navy-blue side panels contrasted by the polished metal body, this machine is a stunner. Sitting at just 12.76"" x 4.6"" x 9.25"" in dimensions and weighing around 5.4 pounds, the Pixie is lightweight but doesn’t skimp on sturdiness. It slots easily into the corner of my kitchen next to my jars of coffee capsules. The solid steel handle feels reassuringly durable, and every button on the machine clicks with a satisfying response. While the aesthetics scream “premium,” I’ve also noticed how practical the design is. The drip tray folds up cleverly to accommodate taller mugs, which came in handy when I decided to experiment with an Americano.  

**Ease of Use and Operation**  
For someone who appreciates their morning caffeine but not the ordeal of manual espresso-making, this machine has been a lifesaver. Its buttons are minimal, intuitive, and impossible to misunderstand. The two coffee options, Espresso and Lungo, let me brew my favorite morning pick-me-up with one press. Heat-up time is lightning-fast—it’s ready to go in under 30 seconds, thanks to its 19-bar pressure pump. I didn’t expect to notice much about the pump system, but it really preserves the bold flavor of the coffee. The descaling warning is another helpful touch, reminding me not to slack off with its maintenance. However, the water reservoir, though adequate for single-serve convenience, could prove slightly limiting for heavy coffee drinkers like my parents when they visit.

**Energy Efficiency and Noise Levels**  
If you’ve ever jolted awake to the cranky roar of an espresso machine, you’ll appreciate how quiet this one is. It hums comfortably while working its magic, so I can brew a cup without disturbing anyone. The auto-shutdown feature deserves applause. The Pixie powers off after two minutes of inactivity, which is great for someone who can’t be trusted to remember things while still half-asleep.

[Time to see Nespresso Pixie Espresso Machine EN127BL cost on Amazon.](https://ultrasonicstore.com/p/b0djg16y9s/)

**Coffee Quality and Flavor**  
I’ll admit I wasn’t entirely optimistic about a capsule espresso machine nailing the essence of barista-style coffee, but it surprised me. Each espresso pull is rich, aromatic, and coated with crema that holds up till the final sip. I mostly used the Nespresso Original pods and found their range quite impressive—the quality of the coffee capsules truly complements the machine’s performance. It doesn’t matter if you prefer a mild tone or bold espresso; this setup delivers consistently flavorful results.

**Good Aspects**  
- Stylish and compact design perfect for small kitchens.  
- Fast heat-up time ensures no morning delays.  
- 19-bar pressure system for full-bodied, flavorful espresso.  
- Energy-saving functionality with auto-shutdown.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- The water tank capacity feels small for group brewing.  
- Replacement capsules can get costly, especially for daily users.  

**Competing Products**  
The coffee machine market is brimming with rivals, so I couldn’t help but compare the Pixie to other well-loved options. Against the Keurig K-Elite, the Pixie beats it with its superior coffee flavor and pressure-driven brewing system. However, Keurig’s larger water reservoir and versatility with various beverage types give it a slight edge for larger families or those desiring variety. Compared to the Breville Essenza Mini, which is also part of the Nespresso family, the Pixie trades higher portability for its more durable, robust build and quicker heat-up time.  

**Worth Every Penny**  
While the upfront investment might make some hesitate, the Pixie is a strong contender for anyone who values convenience and indulgent coffee flavors without sabotaging their budget. It’s positioned well within the cost range for premium single-serve machines, and taking its energy-saving features and durable build into account, it’s a product worth considering.

Not as similar to Dubai Chocolat as I thought it would be. This opens up very sweet (sugar), with a heavy dose of pistachio, a small dose of chocolate and vanilla, and a pretty successful attempt at Knafeh (my favorite middle eastern dessert). It's a heavy gourmand, and very mouth watering. It has some sort of unique note I can't put a name on, that makes it smell/feel like actual sweet steaming baked goods. You know how steam can tickle your nose a different way, making the scent airy but thick at the same time? So, that feeling. I never had this with any gourmand I tested (which is over 80 different ones at this point), and I REALLY like it. In the dry-down, I get more chocolate and vanilla. Unfortunately I barely get any coffee at all. I think I like Odyssey Dubai Chocolat better.
They are only about 75% similar.  

 Also, the performance of this is pretty disappointing considering it's a heavy gourmand.  

**Subjective Scent Score**:8.8   
 **Longevity**: 8.0 (8.5 hours)  
 **Projection**: 7.1 (1 hour medium scent bubble, then small scent bubble for another 1-2 hours, then skin scent)  
 **Blind buy safety score**: 7.5 (you need to like very Gourmand fragrances)  
 **Unisex Score**: perfectly unisex.  
 **Value Score**: 8.3 (it's only $20, but the performance isn't great... If the performance was really good, the value would be a 10).   
 **Conclusion**: I'll be waiting for Dubai Chocolat to go down in price, and buy that one. Review of Dubai Chocolat in my profile... Just write ""Dubai Chocolat"" in the search bar after going in my profile and you'll find it.  


#Mandarin Sky Elixir   
Right off the top you get mandarin, vanilla, tonka, and caramel. Very beautiful combination. Not too sweet or Gourmand thanks to the orange that slightly freshens it up. If you tried Mandarin Sky, then this will be pretty redundant, as it's just a much better version of it (IMO). It lowers the playfulness and versatility a bit, but still keeps it sweet and not too serious. I even prefer it to Checkmate King, even though it's not as rich. As it dries down, it becomes more vanilla/tonka dominant, with some patchouli to ground it a bit. I've heard it described as Mandarin Sky mixed with Invictus Victory Elixir. I fully agree with that description, and I think it's better than both!  

**Subjective Scent Score**: 9.2  
 **Longevity**:9.1 (10 hours)   
 **Projection**: 8.6 (strong, almost a room filler for the first 1-2 hours).  
 **Blind buy safety score**: 8.0  
 **Unisex Score**: 55% Male leaning.  
 **Value Score**: 6.0 ($45 on Jomashop) 
 **Bottle design**: 4.5   
 **Conclusion**: Very good, but I already have too many that compete with it in profile, and they are priced much better. It's not a top 3 for me, but it's priced higher than a top 1 right now. So I'm gonna hold out with getting it. Too similar to Mandarin Sky in the opening, too similar to Victory Elixir in the dry-down... And I already have both. If you don't have any of those and think about getting one, get this instead (if you don't mind the price).

Okay... Finally something that has a more unique profile after everything I've tried. This is a pretty versatile scent profile. Much more complex than most of them. Mainly sweet (amber), then spicy, and slightly fresh. It also has orange and caramel, but the other notes like sage (or maybe Insense), make it lean more masculine and more versatile than just being a sweet bomb. It has a middle eastern feel to it due to spices (that aren't in the notes breakdown), but done in a mass-appealing, non-offensive way that even westerners will appreciate. I like it quite a bit. My wife and my brother also really liked it.

**Subjective Scent Score**: 8.9   
 **Longevity**: 7.7 (8 hours)   
 **Projection**: 7.3 (medium-strong first hour, then slowly fades)   
 **Blind buy safety score**: 8.2  
 **Unisex Score**: 60% Male leaning.  
 **Value Score**: 8.7 (only $22, but not a beast performing scent, so won't be a 9+).  
 **Bottle design**: 7.8  
 **Conclusion**: I'm very likely going to get it at some point in the near future.  


 #Pinnace White 
I promise you it's a fluke that I'm testing all these orange scents one after the other! Orange and orange rind are dominating this profile through and through. I barely get any mint, and only after looking at the notes and sniffing for it, I managed to find some. There's some soapy musk that helps it become slightly less boring. Very playful, somewhat uplifting, casual and unassuming. It's not bad at all, but far from my top 10 summer frags. Extremely simplistic, safe, mass appealing, and energetic. Unfortunately, it was over-hyped by influences to death, and they lied to everyone about the performance. This is a skin scent after less than an hour, and doesn't last long at all.  

**Subjective Scent Score**: 7.3  
 **Longevity**: 3.5 (3 hours)  
 **Projection**: 4.0 (about 30 minutes of ""okay"" projection, then small scent bubble for another 30 minutes, then skin scent only)  
 **Blind buy safety score**: 8.5. Nothing offensive, very mass appealing.   
 **Unisex Score**: Gender free  
 **Value Score**: 4.0. $35 for almost 0 performance.  
 **Bottle design**: 3.0  
 **Conclusion**: Easy no for me. Disqualified due  to price and performance. ",4,1752319243.0,fragranceclones,1,1.0,False
1lxy25v,https://www.reddit.com/r/managers/comments/1lxy25v/am_i_lazy_or_a_bad_managers_if_i_take_frequent/,Am I lazy or a bad managers if I take frequent breaks and never stay OT?,"Hi all!

So I've been a lead of a large team with 5 direct reports (all in managerial positions), 30 indirect ones. It used to be 10 inexperienced direct reports and 70 indirect ones in the team, but a reorganization happened at my request at the beginning of the year.  Throughout the years, I've experienced multiple burnouts, I've had troubles with work-life balance, felt constant stress etc. It was massive. At the beginning of this year, my management finally approved to hire three (!) support positions to whom I can delegate stuff to, because I kept complaining and I had threatened to quit.

Now, I finally have a normal workload and I can focus on strategy, processes and team in more detail, rather than rushing everything. I finally have a normal 40hrs week. 

However, I've decided to take more frequent breaks (to read books, to do the chores, to hang out with a friend for coffee). Instead of 8, I now work maybe 4-5 hours. I still have days when I work 9-10 hours without break, but most days I can chill. It's not that I have nothing to do. I have - but I deprioritize and push to next weeks if it's not something of high important or value. I also delegate a lot more. I mentor my team the same -- if they feel overwhelmed, I instruct them to give themselves a huge buffer when communicating any deadlines, and to focus on what matters, and on what adds value. I also encourage them to challenge myself too if they feel that I overload them with work. 

Now I have a happy me and a happy team. I no lomger have a brain fog or dizzy spells after work. I go outside more often. My hormones are back to perfect. My sleep has improved. I can focus on my hobbies without thinking about work.  I feel healthier - both mentally and physically.

But now I feel guilty about this. I feel like I am now lazy and.. I don't know... like I am not as good as I used to be. For example, on Thursday, someone will send me a request for something at 2 PM and I will tell them me and my team would complete it by end of next week even though we have capacity do it the same day. 

My own manager supports me (I don't receive requests from her but from the client). She is the one that advised it in the first place. So this is not a question of whether I will be 'discovered' but of whether I am doing the right thing...

Or maybe this is just a confession of how my health improved. Maybe we all need to stop and think and give ourselves buffers.. I work in a fast-paced environment with millions of stakeholders and yet I somehow managed to create breathing room. Maybe management of large, cross-functional teams doesn't have to be so difficult... Or maybe it will backfore? We are slower now but our quality of work has improved drastically; we don't accept everything anymore but what we do accept is something that makes both us and the client happy in the long run. 

What do you thimk? Do you have any similar stories to share?

The poison is deadly, and my days are numbered.","Six months ago, I was accidentally poisoned by wolfsbane. The poison is deadly, and my days are numbered.

My body gradually weakens.

Today, my wolf is completely gone, and I have three days left to live.

On the last day before I draw my final breath, I agree to donate my kidney to my sister. Thrilled, my mate swears that he'll make it up to me someday.

My sister is being swamped with insults on the college forum after she was caught plagiarizing my Belladonna thesis.

But I come forward and claim that I'm the one who plagiarized it.

Mom and Dad are pleased, saying I've finally become mature.

At last, I've become the perfect mate and daughter in their eyes.

But why are they crying after my body has turned cold and lifeless?

Chapter 1

When I found out I was going to die, I accepted it with ease.

My mate, Simon Knightley, came to me with a sullen expression and said, ""Zora, Laila has been in poor health since birth. She's an Omega with the weakest healing ability.

""One of her kidneys is failing, and she needs a transplant to survive.""

He pulled out a Mate Bond Breaking Agreement to dissolve our mate bond. After hesitating for a long while, he gritted his teeth and said, ""Your kidney is the best match for Laila. But if you refuse to donate your kidney, you'll have to sign this agreement to break our mate bond.

""Laila doesn't have much time left… And she wants to experience the marking ceremony before she dies. After talking to your parents, they agreed that I should be the one to do it.

""I love you, Zora. We're only doing this to make sure Laila doesn't die with regrets.

""Once she's gone, we'll get back together. Okay?""

I stared at the agreement in Simon's hands. Ever since Laila Thorne's kidney failure, everyone in my family had been expecting me to donate my kidney to her.

But what they didn't know was—I only had one kidney left.

When they found out I refused to donate, they were utterly disappointed. They kept saying how ungrateful I was.

""Zora, your sister's dying. All she needs is your kidney to survive. How can you just stand by and watch her die?""

My parents wouldn't listen to my explanation. Instead, they kicked me out.

""An ingrate like you doesn't deserve to be part of this family. If you won't save Laila, then get out!""

And now, even my mate was forcing me to either donate the kidney or he'd mark Laila instead.

But I was dying anyway. At this point, what difference would it make?

""I agree,"" I said airily.

Stunned, Simon jerked his head up. ""Really? That's amazing! Laila has a chance now!""

He tore the agreement and hurried me to the healing hut.

Mom and Dad also received the news. They arrived soon after, and Mom threw her arms around Laila and wept. ""Laila, you have a chance now! You'll be able to stay with me forever…""

Afraid that I'd change my mind, Dad quickly had the healer bring over the surgical consent form.

Once I signed it, my parents finally relaxed.

""Zora, you've finally matured,"" Dad said. ""You're starting to care for your sister. Don't blame us for being biased, okay? Laila's been through so much—she needs our love.

""But we won't mistreat you either. You'll still get your part of the inheritance.""

I shook my head, swallowing the bitterness in my chest. ""Just give it all to Laila. I won't need it anyway.""

Momentarily stunned, Mom patted me and chided, ""What nonsense are you talking about? Of course, you'll need it!

""Even if your mate is the top warrior in the Lunaris pack and can give you a comfortable life, you can't just disregard your family inheritance.""

Slowly, I slipped into a daze.

Ever since I failed to show up for Dad's kidney transplant surgery five years ago and Laila donated hers instead, my family hadn't been this kind to me.

And it was precisely because she had saved Dad that my parents insisted I owed her and that I had to treat her even better.

From then on, Laila got the best of everything.

She also started targeting me by falsely accusing me, making Mom and Dad resent me even more. Eventually, no matter what I did, it was always wrong.

I used to defend myself. Now, I just stayed quiet.

Then Mom rushed to Laila's side, and Dad and Simon followed close behind.

They all surrounded her, and it was the perfect picture of a loving family.

Only I stood alone in the corner, like an outsider who didn't belong.

Chapter 2

My eyes stung.

Rubbing my eyes roughly, I turned to leave, but Simon stopped me at the door.

""Laila has to stay at the healing hut for treatment, and she won't be able to finish her Werewolf Academy thesis,"" he said. ""Aren't you working on the Belladonna Cure thesis? It's exactly the same as Laila's. Why not let her refer to yours?""

A pang of bitterness hit me. I knew there was more to his words.

Laila's health had always been fragile, so I had always done her Werewolf Academy homework for her. She had even asked me to cheat for her in exams.

She didn't want my grades to surpass hers, yet through plagiarizing my work, she became the top student in the Werewolf Academy.

In truth, she hadn't even started her thesis yet. She was just waiting to copy mine.

Noticing my silence, Mom spoke in a low voice. ""You know how bright Laila is. It's just her health… You're her sister. Help her out, okay?""

I had heard this over and over again for the past five years, and I should've been used to it by now. But every time those words echoed in my ears, my chest tightened.

I forced a smile and nodded. ""Alright. I'll go get it now.""

This was the last time. I wondered if Laila could still graduate smoothly without someone to plagiarize from after I was gone.

""I knew you'd say yes!"" Simon exclaimed. ""So when I left home, I brought your thesis with me.""

He quickly pulled it from his bag and handed it to Laila.

Laila stuck her tongue out at me, a smug smile on her face.

Gently stroking her hair, Simon bent down and whispered something in her ear. She flushed and shot him a glare.

I said nothing and watched their intimate interaction.

If my wolf hadn't been killed by wolfsbane, it would've been howling with rage inside me.

I turned and left the healing hut. Laughter echoed behind me, but no one stopped me this time. Perhaps they hadn't even noticed I had left.

I went back home. As I gazed at the cozy interior, I suddenly made up my mind.

I wanted to clear all my belongings. Since no one seemed to care about me at all, I'd just discard everything about myself. After all, I didn't want my things to be a burden.

I packed everything—including my clothes, daily necessities, my pictures, the gifts I'd bought for my family and Simon—and threw them in the trash outside.

I was completely exhausted, and my breathing grew labored. The wolfsbane had taken hold of my body, and with every movement, a wave of excruciating pain shot through me.

I was really dying.

It took hours before I regained some strength. Just as I got into bed and was about to sleep, Simon barged in.

Flanking a crying Laila, Mom and Dad hurried after him.

""Zora, you promised to give Laila your thesis. How could you collude with others and accuse your sister of plagiarism?"" Simon questioned, his eyes thick with disappointment.

""Zora, I understand that you're upset about me borrowing your thesis."" Laila sobbed. ""But how could you ask your supervisor to publicly criticize me online? I've been swarmed with insults! You're so cruel!""

""Zora, we're family. How could you do this to your sister?"" Mom chimed in disapprovingly.

Turning back to Laila, Mom patted her back gently and cooed, ""Don't cry, sweetheart. You'll hurt yourself. I'll make your sister apologize to you!""

Chapter 3

So it turned out after getting my thesis, Laila flaunted it on the academy's forum.

Unfortunately, my supervisor saw the post.

He had always held high expectations for me, even offering to help revise my thesis before. So the moment Laila uploaded it online, he sensed something was off.

He questioned her about the details, but she couldn't answer a single thing.

The people online immediately realized something was wrong.

How could someone fail to answer questions about their own thesis?

Accusations of plagiarism came flooding in.

""Laila's been so devastated that she fainted from crying several times,"" Simon boomed. ""Zora, you're her sister. How could you do this to her? Apologize to her now!""

Ignoring how pale I looked, he dragged me out of bed and shoved me in front of Laila.

My thoughts wandered. Why had he grown so close to her?

Five years ago, after my family disowned me, I had trudged through a downpour, drenched to the bone.

Then Simon appeared.

The moment I saw him, my wounded wolf stirred with hope. I could feel that he was my predestined mate.

He brought me home, gave me clean clothes, a steaming cup of coffee, and sat beside me as I poured out my heartbreak.

He pitied me, swearing he'd treat me well for the rest of my life.

Back then, he had loathed Laila. He never met her, but he despised anyone who hurt me.

But when had things started to change?

Was it when Laila began hovering around him, acting sweet like a lover? Was it when she clung to him during our dates, or when they started texting each other over the phone for long hours?

My lover had become the knight of the person I resented most.

I thought I could handle the pain, but it still hurt.

Now that I was dying, I could've just let them have whatever they wanted.

""It's my fault for putting you in this mess. I'll clear your name by telling them that I was the one who plagiarized your work,"" I said.

The moment I apologized, they were stunned. They hadn't expected me to be this obedient.

""You've really started to care for your sister,"" Mom said, her gaze turning complicated. ""I'm glad that you two are finally looking out for each other.""

""Zora, you've finally matured,"" Dad chimed in. ""If you keep this up, your mom and I will surely dote on you!""

Guilt flickered in Simon's eyes.

""You're my mate, so I'll surely take care of you,"" he said, trying to comfort me. ""Even if you can't continue your studies at the Werewolf Academy, you can still live comfortably.""

I tried to smile through the pallor.

However, the future Simon spoke of didn't exist for me anymore. At this point, their love and affection were luxuries I could no longer afford.

Laila turned on the camera and began recording.

""This thesis was written by me at home…"" she sobbed. ""I never thought my sister would claim it as her own.""

As she spoke, she turned the camera toward me.

Dad, Mom, and Simon all watched closely, as if afraid I might slip.

Forcing a smile, I said, ""Laila's right. I plagiarized her work and told my supervisor it was mine. I'm sorry.""

Everyone exhaled in relief.

Laila quickly uploaded the video to the academy's forum. Soon, waves of criticism and insults crashed down on me.

Pretending to be noble, she stepped in at the perfect time to defend me. ""Guys, stop it. No matter what, she's my sister. I've already forgiven her.""

While no one else was looking, she turned to me with a cold, victorious glare and hissed, ""You have no right to compete with me. Mom, Dad, and even Simon are all mine. You don't deserve to be loved by any of them.""

Chapter 4

Laila and I were twins, but ever since we were kids, she'd always resented me.

She hated sharing her things with me. So she stole our parents' attention, my toys, my dresses—even though she had the exact same ones.

She wanted anything I laid my eyes on.

Back then, Mom and Dad treated us equally. I had everything Laila had, and they often lectured her for taking my things.

But since what had happened five years ago, they poured all their heart and soul into Laila. They thought I was selfish for not visiting Dad when he was hospitalized.

So whenever we got into an argument after that, they always took Laila's side.

""How could you bully your sister?"" was what they often told me.

After feuding with her for so many years, I was indeed the one who lost. I could no longer be at odds with her anymore.

""Yeah, you won,"" I said softly.

The kidney transplant surgery would take place in two hours, and I was about to die.

Given how deep the wolfsbane was already in my system, my soul would also be shattered by the time the Dragonbone scalpel sliced open my body.

What would be left was only my lifeless body.

By then, would Mom, Dad, and Simon weep for me?

Perhaps not. For an eyesore like me to leave, they'd probably be overjoyed. After all, Laila was the apple of their eye.

Before surgery, Mom, Dad, and Simon huddled around Laila, comforting and encouraging her.

""Laila, don't be scared. We'll be waiting for you outside,"" Dad said in a tone so gentle that I'd never heard before. ""The surgery will definitely be successful. You'll become healthy in no time.""

""After your recovery, I'll make you your favorite dishes,"" Mom chimed in lovingly.",1,1752319014.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

1lxxtbk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lxxtbk,"I built a rejection therapy app to overcome my biggest fear. Now it has 3,800 monthly users.","Hey everyone 👋

BACKGROUND
I am a software developer with 5+ years of experience but no mobile app development experience. I started learning how to make mobile apps 1 year ago. This is my third project (first two were AI-related, didn’t go far).

ABOUT THE APP
The app is meant for people who want to do rejection exposure therapy. I myself feel that the fear of rejection has held me back all my life to the point that I ask only for things I am 99% sure I will get. The good news is that one can desensitize oneself to rejection by intentionally trying to get rejected. E.g. ask for a 10% discount at a coffee shop.
So, I built an app that provides a bunch of challenges like these, grouped by difficulty level, so the user can gradually build up their confidence.

You can check it out here 👉 https://rejecto.io/

Would love to hear your thoughts, feedback, and … rejections!
Also, If you are looking to build and launch an app, I’m happy to share my experience so far and answer any questions about the journey from idea to launch.

Happy building!",19,1752318344.0,SideProject,15,0.91,False

NO MORE DIRTY FASTING Changed Everything For Me!,"Clean Fasting changed things for me OVERNIGHT. No more watching the clock to see when I can eat. ( I do 16:8 or 18:6 and sometimes OMD and sometimes 36 hour fasts. I used to be hungry throughout the day that drove me crazy waiting for my eating window.

I used to put honey in my coffee thinking it wouldnt hurt or drink bone broth that many here recommend. The hunger pangs would start almost immediately. It spiked my glucose levels and my body wanted MORE!

Absolutely NO HUNGER now since i started CLEAN FASTING. I only drink water and black coffee with NO additives. You can also drink tea with NOTHING added.



Clean Fasting is water and/or black coffee /tea in your Fasting window.....THAT'S IT!

If you are having issues with hunger in your non-eating hours it is because of ""dirty fasting""

That is adding anything to your coffee such as honey , sweeteners, non sweeteners ( YES any non-sweetener). No more bone broth , No more ""cheating""...no more flavored water. Just water , black coffee, or straight tea.

Check the ingredients on any non-sweetener label. even ascorbic acid will spike your glucose and start hunger cravings.

Anything you think is harmless could spike your glucose  will start hunger all day.

  
I had reached a plateau where I was only losing a half a pound a week ( I have 25 to go after losing 20 initially ) or none at all until I read a book on Clean Fasting. Since then the pounds are coming off easily with ease. No hunger at all in my fasting windows. In fact sometimes I go over the 16-18 hours without even trying. I don't have to watch the clock anymore.

- Cheez Its are BOGO this week at $4.79. There’s a $1 Ibotta rebate for specific new flavors (smoked cheddar, smoked Gouda, and pesto/mozzarella). If you grab 2 of those, it would be $2.79 for 2 boxes.

I begged over and over, but no one was listening. ""I am your luna."" I screamed at the top of my lungs, but then his laugh from the other room broke all the fight in me.

""Luke please."" I begged once more time, my voice horse.

""Take it once it's done. Toss her out. She will have to survive on her own from here on out.""

He can't mean that. This was our baby.

""Is a mistake from the Moon Goddess. One I will rectify."" His voice called again from the other room. He wouldn't even face me. ""Now do it. That's a command.""

""Yes, Alpha.""

""Oh, and doctor?"" Her sweet voice called from the other room. My stepsister, Shannon. I gritted my teeth. ""Don't use any anesthetic. She should feel everything.""

""Yes, Luna."" The doctor turned back to me with sad eyes, but when he picked up the scalpel, I knew I was screwed.

I'm sorry, baby. Momma couldn't save you. I tried to rub my stomach, but the nurses had strapped me down. When the doctor approached, I realized he was using a silver blade.

""Silver?"" My whisper was almost silent, but he nodded. I knew then that Shannon didn't want me to survive. She wanted my life so badly that she lied about me cheating on my mate, showing photos as proof.

I cried silently as the doctor cut into my abdomen, and I felt my baby thrash inside. He knew it was too early to be born. This was a death sentence for both of us.

""Bring me the body of the pup.""

""Yes Alpha.""

I felt every slice as he cut into me, and finally I could take it no longer. I thrashed against the restraints. But the silver had made me weak.

""Doctor, now.""

""Yes Alpha."" The doctor picked the baby up and rushed out, leaving me spread open to the elements.

I felt my life slipping away as the door opened and Shannon came in. Her smug smile was firmly in place.

""I told you I would take your life, Amy. I would have your mate. "" Shannon walked over and laid a kiss on my face as I snarled. ""He is perfection. And don't worry. I will give him another son."" She laid her hand on her stomach and I started to laugh. ""What's so funny?""

""I can smell the beta on you. That's Derek's child, and it's a girl. Nice try though.""

She snarled and raised her hand, growing her claws to deliver the final blow, but the door was ripped open and my mate, the man I now hated most in the world, stepped inside. His eyes were red, and I started to laugh again.

""You runt!"" He snarled and struck out, whipping Shannon to the other side of the room.

""Brandon!"" Shannon shrieked as she hit the wall. ""What's wrong?"" She staggered to her feet, but more blood dripped out of me and I closed my eyes.

""You lied!"" He screamed, shaking the walls as his aura struck out, but I could barely feel it. I felt the silver travelling in my veins getting closer to my sluggish heart. ""This was my pup. I can smell me on him."" Brandon's eyes grew redder as the tears gathered. ""She did cheat on you. I guess I was wrong about the pup.""

""You said you smelt it."" From the sound of it, he lunged for her again, but him clutching our baby in his arm was the last thing I saw. And I wanted to never see it again. He did this to us. Not Shannon.

She played her part well, sure, but him not believing me, not waiting for a few more days to smell the pup, that was his fault. And all of our downfalls.

I prayed for the moon goddess to take me. I no longer wanted to be here. I wanted to be with my pup.

""Save her.""

""No!"" Shannon screamed. ""I am the Luna now, you marked me last night."" Ah, so that was the pain I felt last night.

I cracked my eyes to see my mate, Brandon, hovering next to me. ""Stay with me Amy.""

""No!"" I slammed out, putting all of my power in it.

Brandon looked down at me, pleading. ""Let me save you.""

""I am descended from the Moon Goddess, and you don't deserve to save me. You don't deserve our pup. You were weak. And now you lost everything."" I smiled up at him as I felt my life from my body.

Chapter Two

I opened my eyes to find myself surprisingly alive. ""Amy hurry, you're going to be late."" I jolted up and look around, confused. What was going on? Where was I? ""Amy!"" The voice called again and I shook myself. I stood up from the bed and looked around again. I recognized this room. It was my childhood bedroom.

I hadn't stepped foot in this room since I found my mate, Brandon. I heard a knock on the door and my mother opened it. Before I could process what was happening, I ran into my mother's arms. ""Mom, you're here."" I started to cry. ""I've missed you so much.""

""Amy. My girl."" She laughed as she patted my back. ""I saw you yesterday."" She pulled back and I looked into her amber eyes that matched my own. ""Happy birthday, baby.""

I leaned into her hands and realized that today was the last day I spent at home. I found my mate on my eighteenth birthday. ""Thank you, mom.""

""Hopefully, you will meet your mate today and start your new life."" She smiled at me and I felt my blood freeze. I didn't want to meet Brandon. Not when I knew what was going to happen.

""I'd rather stay here with you."" I smiled as I kissed her cheek. ""I don't want to miss you and Morgan.

And I knew that when Brandon thought I cheated on him, before he treated my baby and me like that. He also did the same to my mother for her involvement. Shannon's father, my mother's husband, watched her die.

""Baby. You won't miss us. We will be there every step of the way."" She kissed my cheek, and I wrapped my fingers around hers.

""Mom, can we just leave? You and me? Leave Shannon and Morgan and move back to daddy's pack?"" My father, the Alpha of the Silvermoon pack, wasn't a good husband, but he was a good man. He cheated on my mother, betraying her when he was drunk.

His betrayal cost the life of my brother growing inside of her, and she refused to move past it.

""No baby. I can't go back."" My mother's face fell as she turned away.

""I don't want to be betrayed, mom. Not like you and not any worse. I don't want a mate."" I whispered my new truth.

""What do you know?"" I watched as her eyes searched mine.

I pulled her back into my room and away from the door. ""I don't know for sure, but I am terrified that if I am mated to Shannon's boyfriend, I will die after we are mated. Mom, the chances that he will match with an Alpha far outweigh the chance that he is mated to the daughter of the beta."" I pulled back. ""I don't want this for me.""

She weighed my words, and I watched as she came to the same conclusion. ""Okay baby. But you can't leave. It would be too conspicuous. You will have to mask your scent whenever he is around.""

I tossed my hands in the air. ""How would I do that?""

""There is much you don't know that I would leave in the past but if you are sure..."" She trailed off and I just nodded my head. ""Then let me make a few calls. You don't have to go to school today.""

I lept back into her arms. ""Thank you, mom. I don't know what I would do without you.""

""I love you, baby. You will never be without me. That I can promise you."" She kissed my cheek and then left me alone in my room.

I ran to my phone and checked the date to make sure. It was twenty eighteen; I went back six years. Six years to the day that I met Brandon. I could relive everything, make better choices. I could live, and maybe this time around, so would my pup.

I went into my ensuite and jumped into the shower. No way was I going to face today, looking like I just crawled out of bed. I stood in side my closet in a towel trying to figure out what to wear when I heard my bedroom door open.

I was about to turn and call out to my mother, but I heard a soft step, which my mother wouldn't do. So I hid behind my winter coats and I waited.

""I'm telling you, if she is Brandon's mate, I'm going to destroy her.""

""You can't mean that, Shan."" The nasily voice of Megan, Shannon's best friend, came from the cell phone pressed to her ear.

""Of course I do. Brandon is mine.""

""Only because you put out. He was hoping Shannon would notice him.""

""You shut your mouth, Megan."" Shannon snarled and her eyes flashed. ""He's mine.""

""Whatever I gotta go,"" Megan called, and then the line went dead. A honk sounded from outside and Shannon was snatching something before I grabbed her hand.

""What do you think you're doing in my closet?""

""Amy?"" Shannon's mouth dropped out. I squeezed her hand until I heard a crack. Her scream was muffled by my hand.

""You're lucky I only broke one finger. You just threatened to destroy me. Didn't I hear that correctly? A beta's daughter threatening an alpha."" I tsked.

""I didn't do anything."" She snarled back at me as her hand reformed.

""Lie again and I will break all of your fingers and hold them while the bones heal."" I couldn't stop my grin as I felt her tremble. ""Did you threaten me?""

""Yes."" she screamed at me. ""You're going to take Brandon from me.""

""I don't want your pathetic alpha now or ever. Keep him."" I pushed her away. ""Now get out of my room before I change my mind about maiming you."" I turned back to my clothes and picked out low-rise jeans and a tank top.

""What is your problem?""

""You. Now leave."" I let my wolf come forward and my eyes flashed. I pushed my alpha command into my words and forcing her out of my room. Foolish girl. How dare she come into my room to take something of mine? My wolf growled lowly. This was our den. I shook myself and refocused. Closing the doors, I hopped back into bed, pulling out my phone. I tried to remember everything that happened in the last six years that could help me with my plan. Because make no mistake, Brandon and Shannon would pay.

Chapter Three

""Pack your bags, Amy."" My mom came in, surprising me from the list I was making.

""What?"" I looked up. ""Why?""

""You are going to spend the summer with your father. I already got the approval from the Alpha."" Mom smiled down at me. ""Come on, baby. Pack your bag and get ready.""

I jumped to my feet and ran to my mom. ""I can go?""

""Just for the summer, baby, then you will be back here with me. I had to promise that you would be returning here.""

I pouted. ""Mom, I really don't want to be here."" I wanted to make them pay, but I wouldn't risk him finding me.

""It's okay baby, you will understand once you see your dad."" She patted my hair and kissed my cheek. ""Now get ready.""

""Okay mom."" I kissed her back then she left me alone. I grabbed my phone to lock it and then turned back to my closet. I packed my bag and then headed into my bathroom when I heard the downstairs door slam open.

""I knew it."" I heard Shannon scream down stairs. I ignored her as I grabbed everything from my bathroom and then I grabbed my laptop and chargers. I stuffed everything in to my backpack and headed downstairs.

""Shannon, why are you screaming?"" Morgan was at the table with his coffee, and my mom was running around when I pushed my suitcase into the room.

""I'm not Brandon's mate, daddy."" Shannon flew into the room and dove into his arms.

""How are you so sure?"" Morgan wrapped his arms around her, but I just snickered. She snapped her eyes to me and she flew at me.

""It's you."" Shannon tried to claw out my eyes. But I just sent her flying with a backhand.

""Amy!"" Morgan got to his feet but my mom tsked.

""Morgan, you can't yell ay Amy for protecting herself. Shan attacked her first."" My mom placed my breakfast on the table. ""Amy, come eat. You have a long day ahead.""

""Babe? Why does Amy have a suitcase?""

""She is going away for the summer. To her fathers."" My mother turned to me and opened her arms. ""Come baby. Come eat. The car is coming and you need to be ready to go.""

I walked over and sat down, and dug in.

""Why is she going to her dads?"" Morgan walked over to pick Shannon up.

""She wanted to spend the summer with her dads before college and who am I to say no?"" My mom smiled down at me and I smiled back at her. I didn't know what was going to happen this summer to protect me from Brandon finding out I was his mate, but I needed it. Whatever it was, I needed it.

""Yeah, my dad called me this morning and since I haven't seen him since Christmas break and when he offered to fly me out, I asked my mom."" I smiled sweetly over at Morgan, and Shannon smiled.

""You're leaving?"" Shannon stood up.

""Yup. I'll be gone the full summer."" I smirked over at her. ""But my room is locked, and it will stay that way."" My smile dropped away as I stared at her and used my alpha command.

""Amy!"" Morgan yelled out. ""You know you're not allowed to alpha command your step sister!""

""And I wouldn't have Morgan, if I hdn't found her in my room this morning, trying to take things out of my closet."" I turned and raised my eyebrow, daring her to try to lie.

""Is that true?"" Morgan looked down at Shannon and I just stared at her. I watch her open her mouth to deny it.

""I wouldn't lie. I'll just command you to tell the truth."" She screeched and stomped her foot.

""Yes!"" she screamed. ""Are you happy? Yes, I went into her closet to steal some clothes because I know she is Brandon's mate.""

""How?"" I threw up my hands, playing like I didn't know the truth. ""How could you possibly know that I am his mate? Neither of us has scented each other.""

""Because he scented you on me!"" Her voice was hitting a higher octave, and my ears were starting to hurt.

""Calm down. You're hurting everyone's ears and just explain yourself."" My mom sat next to me at the table, rubbing her head.

""Last month, Brandon turned eighteen, and I was wearing Amy's dress. He scented around me and said I smelt divine. But when I'm not wearing her clothes, he has zero interest in me."" Shannon pouted.

""So he likes the way I smell, doesn't mean we are mates."" I pointed out. Completely and utterly denouncing Brandon as a mate. If I didn't accept him, he would never be my mate anyway, and I would never accept him. That was the only thing I was sure of.

Brandon would be the last male I would ever touch this time around.

""Stop being obtuse Amy. We all know what it means when a wolf likes your smell."" Shannon started to cry and buried her head in her hands. ""He's the male I want, daddy. The only one I would ever accept. But he wants her."" She pointed to me.

I scoffed. ""I don't want your sloppy seconds, Shannon. Even if he was my mate, and I am not saying he is. It would be a cold day before I accepted him as a mate. I would take the Lycan King over Brandon."" I threw my head back and laughed when she gasped.

The Lycan king was the bogeyman of all wolves.

The last Lycan to exist and one who lives in the wild. It's said the only wolves that ever see his face are the council that oversees the packs.

But either way, I wasn't lying. I would take the King as a mate before I would even look in Brandon's vicinity.

""You're lying. He's the alpha.""

""And?""

""Everyone wants to be the luna.""

""Idiots want to be the luna."" I turned back and finished my food as Morgan calmed her down. My mom stood when she heard a horn.

""That's for you.""

I nodded as I stood and kissed my mother goodbye before I left.

Chapter Four

I slipped into the back of the car after putting my bags in the back and buckled in. I had barely takin a breath before I launched myself over the seats and into the driver's arms.

His laugh made my eyes prickle. ""Hey love bug.""

""Uncle Ronnie. I've missed you."" I climbed over the seats and sat up front. ""What are you doing here?"" Ronnie was my dad's beta. Not related, but he had been there for most of my life.

""You think I was going to let my cheeky niece come to pack lands alone? Not on your life.""

""Dad sent you?"" I laughed.

""Dad sent me. He is a worry wart your da."" He smiled over and laughed with me. ""As soon as your mom called, he sent me with the jet.""

""He didn't have to."" I just shook my head and buckled my seatbelt.

""Of course he did. He never gets to see you enough, and now you're sending in the summer. What's going on?"" My uncle looked at me and I just shook my head.

""I don't want to be here.""

""Why?""

I looked down at my hands that were twisted. ""I'm afraid that my mate is here and I don't want to be right. I figured if I ran away, I could push off the inevitability.""

""Why wouldn; t you want your mate?"" My uncle asked as he zipped down the highway toward the airport.

""I'll tell both you and dad, just not now."" My uncle looked over at me, searching my face and then nodding.",1,1752318175.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

From the Colosseum’s ancient roar to the serenity of the Vatican, every corner holds centuries of stories. Cobblestone streets lead you past ruins, piazzas, and espresso bars where modern life dances with the past.

Whether you're tossing a coin into Trevi Fountain or catching sunset over the Tiber, Rome is more than a destination—it’s a feeling carved in stone and stirred with passion.

🛵 **Getting Around Rome & Capturing the Vibe**

Rome’s charm lies not just in its ruins, but in its rhythm. The city pulses with vespas zipping past ancient arches, locals chatting over espresso, and golden sunsets that light up the skyline.  
🚶 To explore it all, lace up your walking shoes—many treasures are best found on foot. But when you need speed, the Metro’s Line A & B can zip you between landmarks like Termini, Vatican City, and the Spanish Steps.

💡 Tip for fellow travelers: start your mornings early to feel the city waking up. Grab a cornetto and coffee in a quiet piazza and let Rome unfold like a story written in stone.

After countless failed attempts to get rid of them, I had finally decided to get some traps. Yeah, I should have done it much earlier but, to be honest, I was feeling quite hesitant about it. You see, for as long as I can remember I’ve always had a strong sensitivity toward animals – and, for four years now, I’ve been vegan. Because of this, even the thought of killing those tiny pests made me feel really uneasy. I’m well aware of how people see vegans, especially online, and I’m sure some of you are already rolling your eyes and thinking I’m some crazy extremist. That’s fine, I’m used to it. And no, I’m not trying to “convert” anyone. It’s just a personal decision based on my own moral compass.

If anyone reading this is also vegan or vegetarian, I’m sure you’re familiar with the kind of “ethical dilemmas” people love to throw at us when they hear about our diet. Stuff like: “If you were on a desert island with only chickens and pigs, would you eat them to survive?” or “Would you kill an animal if it was attacking you and your family?” – always asked with a satisfied grim, as if it’s some kind of clever ‘gotcha’ moment.

Well, my situation with the pantry moths had turned into something like that. It was no longer just a matter of hygiene or food waste – it had become a matter of survival: either me or them.

So, on my next trip to the supermarket, I filled my basket with those sticky traps that you attach to cupboard doors. That weekend, I committed myself to a full-on cleaning operation. I completely emptied the kitchen shelves, threw away all the food they contained, and even went as far as replacing every single glass container. I vacuumed and washed every shelf, and placed a couple of traps in each cabinet, hoping this would finally put an end to the whole ordeal.

And for a while, it seemed like it had. I wasn’t exactly thrilled to see dead moths stuck to the cabinet doors, but at least I felt a huge sense of relief.

Then, one morning, I found it.

I was just reaching for the sugar for my coffee when I saw it, stuck to one of the traps. At first, I flinched, thinking it was a centipede or some other creepy bug. Then, looking closer, I realized it was something else.

It was about 4 inches long and looked like a piece of fabric, although incredibly thin. It reminded me of the shed skin of a snake, almost transparent, but with faint brown streaks, more similar in color to the moths themselves. There was something deeply unsettling about it. I didn’t know what it was, but the idea that it had come from some weird insect still lurking somewhere in my kitchen made my skin crawl.

At that moment, I – a grown man, nearly thirty years old – found myself wishing I still lived with my parents, that I could just call for my dad and ask him to deal with whatever that thing was. 

Yeah, feel free to laugh about me – scared by a piece of cloth.

I must admit that I felt ridiculous myself, once I really thought about it. Still, I wasn’t completely ready to handle that thing, at least not before understanding what it was.

I turned to Google, but the research turned out quite unsuccessful. At the very least, the fact that no other insect or parasite seemed to match the description of what I had found made me feel much better, and I concluded that there was nothing to worry about.

Doing my best to suppress my gag reflex, I armed myself with some paper towels, managed to remove the trap from the wall and threw it in the trash, replacing it with a new one.

In the days that followed, I never came across anything like that again and, eventually, I ended up completely forgetting about it. At the same time, however, the moth problem—which I thought was over—started getting worse again.

I was seeing them outside the kitchen now. Sometimes a couple would show up on the bathroom walls, in the living room, even in the bedroom. Although many ended up stuck to the traps, their numbers never seemed to shrink. And no matter how often I checked and obsessively cleaned the cupboards, I just couldn’t figure out where they were coming from.

Of course, my discomfort was deeper than ever. I had nearly stopped purchasing dry goods altogether and, in general, made an effort to spend as little time in the kitchen as possible. Most of my meals now consisted of frozen food or takeaway.

It was starting to take a toll on my mental health too. Seeing them crawling on the walls and ceiling would fill me with a sense of overwhelming unease. When the apartment was completely still, especially at night, it felt almost as if I could hear them squirming in the food, chewing through cardboard and wood, sneaking into every crack and corner. Even the tiniest brush against my skin would make me jump.

To the feeling of disgust and revulsion toward the pests, a sense of paranoia had also begun to creep in—one far worse than anything I’d experienced before. This, though, wasn’t due solely to the moths themselves, but rather to other strange events that, at that same time, had begun occurring in my apartment.

I’ll try to recount everything that happened as clearly and logically as I can.

It started with the smell. A sickly-sweet odor, but, at first, barely noticeable. I would catch it now and then, drifting through the air as I moved from one room to another, or when I came home after a day at work. Unable to determine exactly where it was coming from, I first checked the fridge, the trash, the kitchen floor corners under the furniture and the area around the dining table, places where food might have fallen and spoiled. I even looked behind the couch, under the rug, beneath the bed, and around the nightstands—even though I never really eat in the bedroom. Although I found nothing, the smell, in those spots, seemed to intensify slightly. So, I decided to wash the couch cushions and covers, the rug, and the bed linens, but nothing changed. I checked the bathroom too, and the walls that housed the plumbing, searching for signs of leaks or mold.

Still nothing.

A few weeks later, I woke up in the middle of the night, feeling thirsty. I automatically reached for the glass of water on my nightstand. I have this habit of filling one before going to bed, keeping it next to the bed to avoid getting up at moments like this. But then, holding it in front of me in the room dimly lit by the moonlight, I noticed the glass was half empty. Under normal circumstances, being thirsty and still half asleep, I wouldn’t have even registered it. Yet, I hesitated.

I focused, trying to recall if I had taken a sip earlier that night or just before falling asleep.

Maybe I had spilled some while setting it down. Or maybe I had simply filled it only halfway.

Yes, that must have been it. Still, despite my efforts to ease my mind, something prevented me from taking a sip. The thought, weird and irrational as it was, that someone else might have drunk from the glass, had already crawled into in my head.

I stayed perfectly still, holding my breath, ears straining to catch the faintest sound in the apartment – a creaking floorboard, a door handle turning, a quiet breath.

But everything was silent.

I mean, sure, there are some weird people out there. But why would someone sneak into my apartment just to take a sip of water, inches from my face, risking being caught if I woke up?

Besides, my place is pretty safe. I live on the fourth floor, so breaking in through a window was nearly impossible, and the front door, which I always lock before bed, can’t be opened from the outside without a key.

And yet, I couldn’t shake the unease. I got up, still holding the half empty glass, and decided to check every room.

As expected, nothing was out of place. The door was locked. Everything looked normal.

Finally, I made my way to the kitchen. When I turned on the light, I noticed the moths again.

A few dotted the pantry walls, but many more clustered on the ceiling. At least, I thought, it couldn’t have been the moths who drank my water.

Then again, they could still fall in, floating there, dead, until I, distracted, take a sip and...

I couldn’t help but grimace in disgust.

Why the hell was I even thinking about this?

Well, because those damn pests were everywhere – on my plates, in my glasses, in my food.

I washed the glass twice before filling it with water again and going back to bed.

The glass thing happened again, just a few days later. I woke up one morning and found it nearly empty.

But this time, I was sure I hadn’t drunk from it and there was no brushing it off.

Especially because the day before, I had started noticing the stains.

Brown smears—irregular, shifting in shape—like something rancid had been dragged across the surfaces.

The smell was the same one that had been hanging in the air for weeks, only now stronger, denser, harder to ignore. And the moths, they loved it. They were attracted to it, just like with the sticky traps.

The stains showed up in the weirdest places: on some of my clothes, on the glass panel in the shower, on the bookshelves, on the back of the couch—whose cover I had just had professionally cleaned.

It didn’t look like mold, but I was sure it was something like it.

Something organic. Something toxic, that was slowly spreading.

And I couldn’t stop it.

It didn’t matter that I threw away my clothes, tossed the sofa, scrubbed every surface with disinfectant, got rid of food, rags, sponges. They kept coming back.

And I couldn’t find any explanation.

I scoured the internet. I contacted professionals, pest control, cleaning companies. But no one had a clean answer and nothing seemed to fix the problem.

By now, you’re probably asking yourself why I didn’t just leave.

Truth is, I asked myself the same thing, many times.

Every single day, I dreaded the moment I’d walk back into that apartment after work.

The nauseating stench waiting just beyond the door.

Another fresh stain somewhere in the house, covered with writhing moths.

Sometimes, when I couldn’t take it anymore, I’d check into some cheap hotel for the night.

But I always came back.

Something inside me pulled harder than the fear, harder than the repulsion.

A force—no, an obsession—that wouldn’t let go until I uncovered the truth of what was happening in that place.

You see, there’s another detail I haven’t mentioned yet. Sometimes I would step into a room and immediately feel like I was being watched. Then, I would carefully scan every corner, every single object around me.

Even though I never managed to find anything, my mind seemed to register something off, something wrong.

You’ve probably experienced it too: walking into a familiar room and feeling like something is different, without being able to tell exactly what. Maybe an item that has been misplaced or something you seem to notice for the first time, though now you’re unsure if it’s always been there.

That was exactly the feeling I had in those moments.

I knew something had changed, something subtle, but I could never figure out what.

And then, after a few seconds, the sensation would disappear, along with the feeling of being watched.

It was driving me insane.

I know what you’re probably thinking:

“So what? That’s still not a good enough reason to not get the fuck out.”

And yeah, looking back, I can see now that you’re absolutely right. As I write these words, it even sounds to me like I’m describing some idiot willing to risk a home invasion or a biohazard just to satisfy a stupid curiosity.

But you have to understand: during those weeks, my mental state was far from stable.

I could barely sleep, constantly weighed down by anxiety and paranoia.

And when I did manage to fall asleep – usually with the help of a pill – it was a restless sleep, haunted by nightmares. I’d dream of waking up covered in that rancid slime, with moths and larvae crawling all over me, burrowing into every opening they could find, consuming me from the inside, hollowing me out.

In the daytime, it was no better.

I’d move frantically from room to room, turning over furniture, searching without rest.

Other times, I’d just sit there in silence for hours, watching, memorizing every detail, trying hard not to blink, not to miss it.

But that thing – whatever it was – always managed to stay just out of sight.

Until one night, I saw it.

I’d just opened my eyes, unsure if I’d ever actually fallen asleep.

And there it was.

On the wall, just above the bookshelf.

Though I could barely make it out in the darkness, its shape resembled that of a man. And yet, that thing couldn't possibly have been human.

It was thin—almost like a paper cut-out of a man, cut and crookedly glued to the wall.

Its head was slightly lifted, and it seemed to sway gently, moved by the breeze slipping through the cracked window.

Completely overtaken by shock and terror, I laid in bed, petrified. At the same time, though, I felt an urge rising inside of me. I wanted to see. I wanted to know.

Every muscle in my body was tense as I slowly, as quietly as possible, slid my arm out from under the blanket, reaching for the lamp switch on my nightstand.

When I finally felt it beneath my fingers, I waited a few seconds, uncertain, doubting whether I was truly ready to face whatever was there.

Then, holding my breath, I clicked it on.

I barely had time to catch a glimpse before it, startled by the light, crawled fast behind the bookshelf.

But I saw two things clearly. The first was that its entire flattened body appeared to be made of the same semi-transparent, brown-streaked material I had once found stuck to the trap in the cupboard. The second was that its left hand was missing a finger.

It must have been the moment my rational mind finally kicked back in, because I leapt out of bed and ran into the living room, locking myself inside.

I turned on every light I could find and frantically searched for tape, sealing the door shut.

Exhausted, I collapsed onto the floor. And everything went dark.

You’re probably thinking that once I regained consciousness, I finally fled that apartment and never looked back.

I’m sorry to disappoint you, but that’s not what happened.

Although, I did eventually leave the place – and, right now, I’m writing this from the bedroom of a small Airbnb – it didn’t happen that morning.

Don’t get me wrong, I was absolutely terrified.

I stayed locked in the living room for hours, gripped by the fear that it had somehow gotten in and was now watching me from behind a piece of furniture. Beyond the wall, I could hear my phone ringing.

First the alarm, then call after call from my boss.

Only when nature began to call did I somehow find the strength to peel away the tape and leave the room.

Outside, everything appeared to be exactly where it had always been. Even in the hours that followed, nothing happened.

That’s when a new thought started forming in my head: if that thing had truly meant to harm me, wouldn’t it have done so already?

“My boy, it’s more scared of you than you are of it,” my dad used to say, whenever I begged him to remove a spider from my room.

And though I still can’t believe anything could match the terror I felt when I first saw that thing, maybe – just maybe – there was some truth buried in his words.

Slowly, I began to convince myself that I could track the creature down. Maybe even kill it. Or at the very least, force it out.

So I resumed the search, this time even more feverishly, more methodically. And eventually, after a few days, I found something.

Not the creature itself, but something else.

Something that stirred whatever little sense I had left and convinced me, once and for all, that I needed to get out of that apartment.

I discovered it beneath one of the floorboards under the bed, which sat slightly raised. The entire space was stained by that wide, brownish liquid.

At first, I couldn’t quite tell what I was looking at. They resembled shards of old Christmas ornaments – gray and coated in something dark and sticky.

And then it hit me.

They were eggs.

1lxxl89,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1lxxl89/questioning_employees/,Questioning Employees,"Hello all. I have a quick question about a situation that’s bothering me. I’m a small food business owner-operator, usually working alone for a few years now. I’ve finally decided I’m in a better spot to expand, and hired someone who seems great. Motivated, personable, picked up on processes and procedures quickly, and great with customers.

Here’s the thing. They do not stick to the set schedule that was discussed and they even made sure to clarify the hours for. They have a second job which of course is understandable as this is a part time job, but they assured me the job times in no way overlap and from the description and nature of the second job I don’t believe they do. 

So I’m really confused as to why they’ve come in 13 minutes late on their first solo shift, but stayed 10 minutes beyond and made sure to contact me to confirm they have a hard stop at the scheduled time and can not stay after which I agreed with. The next day, they closed the shop almost 15 minutes earlier than closing and clocked out 20 minutes early, which again makes absolutely no sense because if you shifted the time to the actual time you would still be within time to leave. I clarified our closing time and procedures and even broke down step by step and times for pre closing to ensure they are serving customers up to closing time in an abbreviated capacity(last 15 minutes no prepares food or involved beverages, simply grab and go items like hot and iced coffee that can be served in 30 seconds) 

Here’s the final kickers. They not only asked ro leave an hour and a half early for their fourth shift, but on the shift that day after the clarification message  essentially did not serve customers fifteen minutes to close, even missing a small group and single customers while in the back (I clarified to place a bell to make sure we can still serve while doing tasks in the back-which they did not do) and when a duo approached 4 minutes to close responded to their hello with a sorry we’re closed for the day. 

So my question is- what should I do? I started this person out with a higher wage as they had experience and was able to jump in after only a week or so of training. But this blatant disregard for the rules and essentially counterproductive approach to revenue and customer service is making me feel like I can’t really trust them. Considering I can reduce their pay to the standard rate ($2 less per hour) as this has literally only been their first week, or adjust hours to fit the time. It’s been really rough trying to find competent trustworthy and reliably consistent employees (this is about my fourth one) just really at a loss of what to do, as it’s the slow season where I am also considering just closing during the low volume days and continuing to work alone until the fall while I regain the fortitude to start this process again.

So my primary roommate, the one on the lease, lets call him Jeff (30), has an issue with using personal items that don't belong to him. 

It all started with my towel. Initially I had it hanging up in the bathroom until it started disappearing. Turns out Jeff can't tell different towels apart, even if they're a different colour. So I write my name on it in sharpie. Big letters, clearly visible. It keeps happening, so now i have to keep my towel in my room.

Then it was my toenail clippers. Again, they don't even look the same and they were in my part of the vanity. Nope, I find them in the shower, wet. Not only was he using my clippers, he was washing the trimmings down the drain.... when he wasn't just leaving them where ever, like the living room floor, bathroom counter, bath mat.... I tell him it's fucking gross and to stop, but it still happened twice more. It finally stopped when I confronted him in front of his girlfriend at the time.

While we're still in the bathroom, he started using one of my combs, the one I typically use, while he has a bunch of his own. So many reasons this is gross and I doubt he understands any of them. Well of course he denies it, but the comb is sitting out, covered in his or his sons hair. It's really easy to tell, mine is straight and unnatural colours, his is curly and black. Whatever, I disinfect my comb and put it away.... a few weeks later, it's just outright missing. Well he left his bedroom door open and I could see the comb on his dresser all the way from the hallway, so I text him, asking if he's seen it. He denies taking it then ""found"" it under the toilet paper bundle when he got home. 

Stiiiiiill in the bathroom, sorta. So nobody is sleeping (I work nights), we'll listen to music when we shower, with each our own speaker. So one day I accidentally leave mine in the bathroom and as luck would have it, he forgot his at work. So I'm in the living room watching videos on my phone when it suddenly connects to my speaker.... then disconnects. Mother fucker paired to my speaker without even so much as a hey, mind if I borrow this? I told him it was rude and left it at that. I doubt he got it though.

Ok, we're basically downstairs now. So I have a pair of crocs at the back door for back door stuff. You know, taking out garbage, taking a puff, etc. Well I guess he thinks that shoes are communal, because I lost count of the times he would put them on, go outside, come back in and then walk around the house in them. I asked him if he's never heard of athlete's foot and he just shrugs. Like dude, you have your own flipflops. Use them. And what's worse, if he had a guest over, he'd give them my crocs to wear outside! They aren't yours to lend out! Nevermind the disrespect of walking on my rug in shoes! Something I have to tell him not to do on a weekly basis. He still doesn't get it and asked why not if I'm fine with shoes on the door rug..... 

And then there's all the little things. 

Like helping himself to my weed, leaving the lid open, and trying to pin it on the roommate (""Chuck"" 27m, moved out in April) who doesn't even smoke weed. Nevermind the fact that Jeff has a bad habit of not putting lids back on things... which will get it's own episode in this bs saga.

Or taking my benelyn and drinking it straight from the bottle because his kid was sick and he thought it would help keep him from catching cold.... lost the lid, of course.

Or taking my big ass coffee tumbler and using it for a glass of coke, leaving it in the basement for three days so it could start to corrode, and then got snippy with me when I told him I don't want him using it if he's going to mistreat it.

Or looking in my sketchbook without even asking..... No. Just fucking no. It's like reading someone's diary.

I'm sure I'm forgetting some, but it's a decent sample of the shit I have had to put up with. I've also thrown in a pic of his furry little turd who ""steals"" my recliner and drools on the arm rest... but I can't really be mad at that lol. The dog is such a goober

I'm not sure which to do for next episode. His absolute inability to accept responsibility for anything he or his kids do, the poor sink and the hell it has to put up with, the back deck garbage saga, or just a compilation of all the times I've come home to an unflushed toilet?",1,1752317459.0,badroommates,2,0.67,False
1lxxjit,https://www.reddit.com/r/novelsfree/comments/1lxxjit/name_of_the_novel_and_link_please/,Name of the novel and link please,"For four years, Freya played a role as Jaspe’s work helper and secret bed partner .
She hoped that Mr. Whitemore’s cold heart will melt for her in one day.
But fate had other plans.
She called Jaspe after his first love Mia came back.
As expected, Mia answered: ""Jasper, who's this Freya Kingsley calling you and not saying anything?""
A moment later, his cool voice rang out : ""Nobody important. Ignore it. Come back to bed, babe.""
Freya gave a self - mocking smile. She should have realized earlier that Mr. Whitemore's heart still belonged to his first love, Mia Carter.

After a quiet weekend, Monday morning came. Freya arrived at work on time. She was just a poor girl without family support and had to work to survive in this crucial city.

She handled her usual tasks, including telling Jasper about his upcoming meeting. Approaching his office, she glanced through the partially open door and froze.

Mia was sitting in Jasper's lap, feeding him the other half of her cookie. The CEO, who was famously germophobic, actually ate it with a smile and then gently kissed her fingertips.

""You were talking about craving these yesterday, so I stood in line for three hours this morning. Worth it?"" His voice had a tenderness Freya had never heard before.

""Mmm, they're perfect—sweet but not sickeningly so. You used to trek across town for these all the time. Now you're literally running a corporation. Can't you just send someone to get them?"" Mia wiggled her foot as he massaged her ankle.

Jasper's face showed pure devotion. ""Anything that matters to you, I handle myself. Always.""

Mia's face lit up as she wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him. He pulled her closer, lost in the moment.

Watching them, Freya felt a bitter in her chest. Her fingernails dug into her palms, leaving bloody crescents.

As the meeting time approached, Freya composed herself and knocked lightly.

""Mr. Whitemore, your meeting's about to start.""

Hearing her, Jasper tensed and started to rise, but Mia tugged him back down.

""Don't go yet. Five more minutes?"" She gave him puppy - dog eyes.

Her playful plea melted his resolve instantly.

""Push the meeting back two hours,"" he called out.

This meeting involved a collaboration between major New York corporations, crucial to the company's future.

Freya knew its importance and couldn't help adding:

""The CEOs from Verdean, Aurex, and Vireon are already in the conference room...""

""God, Jasper, your helper is such a buzzkill! Can't she take a hint?"" Mia rolled her eyes dramatically.

Jasper's expression hardened instantly. ""I said postpone it two hours. Nothing comes before Mia, got it?""

Freya felt like she couldn't breathe. In the end, she simply closed the door and walked away.

Everyone knew Jasper was a workaholic. No matter what was happening personally—even right after surgery—he'd drag himself in to finish his work. Yet here he was, risking relationships with major partners because of a little whining.

Did he really love Mia that much?

Freya pulled herself together and walked into the conference room to face the waiting executives.

The Whitemore empire was powerful enough that these CEOs, despite being angry, wouldn't directly criticize Jasper. Instead, they unloaded on Freya.

She took all silently, head down.

After an excruciating two - hour wait, Jasper finally showed up. As Freya left the conference room on legs that felt like jelly, Mia called out to her.

""You're Freya, right? Jasper says you make perfect coffee. Everyone looks dead on their feet—whip up some for the whole floor? Mine with ice, no sugar.""

Knowing her place in the hierarchy, Freya headed to the break room without protest.

Two hours later, she finished preparing over four hundred cups, delivering them one by one.

After just one sip, Mia's face darkened. She hurled her mug straight at Freya's head.

The ceramic smashed against Freya's forehead, opening a nasty gash. She let out a gasp of pain and dropped to the floor, clutching her wound.

Not satisfied, Mia grabbed more mugs and kept throwing them.

Bruises bloomed across Freya's body as ceramic shards sliced her skin. Coffee soaked through her clothes, mixing with bright red blood dripping onto the floor.

Despite the blinding pain, she could only curl into a ball, protecting her head and chest.

The office went dead silent. Nobody dared step in as Mia continued her meltdown. They all kept their distance, watching in horror.

The commotion brought Jasper out of his office. He surveyed the chaos and Freya's crumpled form with narrowed eyes.

""What has happened?""

Seeing him, Mia instantly switched to victim mode. ""Jasper, I asked her to make me coffee. I'm on my period, and she deliberately put ice in it. ""

Seeing her teary eyes, Jasper's face darkened immediately.

""You've worked for me for four years and can't handle a simple coffee order? Or do you have some problem with Mia?""

Freya raised her pale face to explain, but he didn't give her the chance. He called over another helper.

""Dock her entire month's salary and quarterly bonus. Send a company - wide notice and have her make a public apology at next week's all - hands.""

""Man, I've never seen him this crazy about anyone. Freya, just watch your back. We're regular folks—we can't compete with trust fund babies. With Jasper backing her play, we just have to eat whatever crap they serve us.""
Freya appreciated their support, but their words left her emotionally tangled. 

Once, when a client tried blaming her for their own mistake on a contract, Jasper had stood rock-solid behind her. He'd believed in her completely, fighting until her name was cleared.

But now? Mia drops one casual lie, and he doesn't even fact-check or let her explain. He just believes she's at fault.

That day, she thought a lot and finally chose to submit her resignation letter to the HR.

""You really decide that, Freya? You are the best helper for Mr. Whitemore and I believe he won’t let you go.""

""Yeah. I I have made up my mind. Just pass it on.""

When HR was about to inform Jasper that she had submitted her resignation application, Jasper was shopping with Mia.

He said impatiently, ""I'm not interested in paying attention to the departure of a junior staff member right now."" 

The HR said, ""But the person who left was..."" 
""Dear, it's so noisy. "" Before the HR could finish speaking, Mia interrupted in a coquettish tone.

""Then let ti go!""Jasper said and hang up.
 
HR signed and informed Jasper the boss’s decision.

""I’ve guessed that.""Freya smiled, but felt heart shattered.

The next morning ,Jasper sat down in the office. 

Mia is sleeping at home today and he can concentrate on his work. 

He shouted loudly, ""What about the content of today's meeting? Why hasn't it been brought over yet? ""

An employee outside replied, ""Freya resigned yesterday. This is her job."" 

Jasper’s face darkened:""What? I don’t know that.""

She hoped that Mr. Whitemore’s cold heart will melt for her in one day.
But fate had other plans.
She called Jaspe after his first love Mia came back.
As expected, Mia answered: ""Jasper, who's this Freya Kingsley calling you and not saying anything?""
A moment later, his cool voice rang out : ""Nobody important. Ignore it. Come back to bed, babe.""
Freya gave a self - mocking smile. She should have realized earlier that Mr. Whitemore's heart still belonged to his first love, Mia Carter.

After a quiet weekend, Monday morning came. Freya arrived at work on time. She was just a poor girl without family support and had to work to survive in this crucial city.

She handled her usual tasks, including telling Jasper about his upcoming meeting. Approaching his office, she glanced through the partially open door and froze.

Mia was sitting in Jasper's lap, feeding him the other half of her cookie. The CEO, who was famously germophobic, actually ate it with a smile and then gently kissed her fingertips.

""You were talking about craving these yesterday, so I stood in line for three hours this morning. Worth it?"" His voice had a tenderness Freya had never heard before.

""Mmm, they're perfect—sweet but not sickeningly so. You used to trek across town for these all the time. Now you're literally running a corporation. Can't you just send someone to get them?"" Mia wiggled her foot as he massaged her ankle.

Jasper's face showed pure devotion. ""Anything that matters to you, I handle myself. Always.""

Mia's face lit up as she wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him. He pulled her closer, lost in the moment.

Watching them, Freya felt a bitter in her chest. Her fingernails dug into her palms, leaving bloody crescents.

As the meeting time approached, Freya composed herself and knocked lightly.

""Mr. Whitemore, your meeting's about to start.""

Hearing her, Jasper tensed and started to rise, but Mia tugged him back down.

""Don't go yet. Five more minutes?"" She gave him puppy - dog eyes.

Her playful plea melted his resolve instantly.

""Push the meeting back two hours,"" he called out.

This meeting involved a collaboration between major New York corporations, crucial to the company's future.

Freya knew its importance and couldn't help adding:

""The CEOs from Verdean, Aurex, and Vireon are already in the conference room...""

""God, Jasper, your helper is such a buzzkill! Can't she take a hint?"" Mia rolled her eyes dramatically.

Jasper's expression hardened instantly. ""I said postpone it two hours. Nothing comes before Mia, got it?""

Freya felt like she couldn't breathe. In the end, she simply closed the door and walked away.

Everyone knew Jasper was a workaholic. No matter what was happening personally—even right after surgery—he'd drag himself in to finish his work. Yet here he was, risking relationships with major partners because of a little whining.

Did he really love Mia that much?

Freya pulled herself together and walked into the conference room to face the waiting executives.

The Whitemore empire was powerful enough that these CEOs, despite being angry, wouldn't directly criticize Jasper. Instead, they unloaded on Freya.

She took all silently, head down.

After an excruciating two - hour wait, Jasper finally showed up. As Freya left the conference room on legs that felt like jelly, Mia called out to her.

""You're Freya, right? Jasper says you make perfect coffee. Everyone looks dead on their feet—whip up some for the whole floor? Mine with ice, no sugar.""

Knowing her place in the hierarchy, Freya headed to the break room without protest.

Two hours later, she finished preparing over four hundred cups, delivering them one by one.

After just one sip, Mia's face darkened. She hurled her mug straight at Freya's head.

The ceramic smashed against Freya's forehead, opening a nasty gash. She let out a gasp of pain and dropped to the floor, clutching her wound.

Not satisfied, Mia grabbed more mugs and kept throwing them.

Bruises bloomed across Freya's body as ceramic shards sliced her skin. Coffee soaked through her clothes, mixing with bright red blood dripping onto the floor.

Despite the blinding pain, she could only curl into a ball, protecting her head and chest.

The office went dead silent. Nobody dared step in as Mia continued her meltdown. They all kept their distance, watching in horror.

The commotion brought Jasper out of his office. He surveyed the chaos and Freya's crumpled form with narrowed eyes.

""What has happened?""

Seeing him, Mia instantly switched to victim mode. ""Jasper, I asked her to make me coffee. I'm on my period, and she deliberately put ice in it. ""

Seeing her teary eyes, Jasper's face darkened immediately.

""You've worked for me for four years and can't handle a simple coffee order? Or do you have some problem with Mia?""

Freya raised her pale face to explain, but he didn't give her the chance. He called over another helper.

""Dock her entire month's salary and quarterly bonus. Send a company - wide notice and have her make a public apology at next week's all - hands.""

""Man, I've never seen him this crazy about anyone. Freya, just watch your back. We're regular folks—we can't compete with trust fund babies. With Jasper backing her play, we just have to eat whatever crap they serve us.""
Freya appreciated their support, but their words left her emotionally tangled. 

Once, when a client tried blaming her for their own mistake on a contract, Jasper had stood rock-solid behind her. He'd believed in her completely, fighting until her name was cleared.

But now? Mia drops one casual lie, and he doesn't even fact-check or let her explain. He just believes she's at fault.

That day, she thought a lot and finally chose to submit her resignation letter to the HR.

""You really decide that, Freya? You are the best helper for Mr. Whitemore and I believe he won’t let you go.""

""Yeah. I I have made up my mind. Just pass it on.""

When HR was about to inform Jasper that she had submitted her resignation application, Jasper was shopping with Mia.

He said impatiently, ""I'm not interested in paying attention to the departure of a junior staff member right now."" 

The HR said, ""But the person who left was..."" 
""Dear, it's so noisy. "" Before the HR could finish speaking, Mia interrupted in a coquettish tone.

""Then let ti go!""Jasper said and hang up.
 
HR signed and informed Jasper the boss’s decision.

""I’ve guessed that.""Freya smiled, but felt heart shattered.

The next morning ,Jasper sat down in the office. 

Mia is sleeping at home today and he can concentrate on his work. 

He shouted loudly, ""What about the content of today's meeting? Why hasn't it been brought over yet? ""

An employee outside replied, ""Freya resigned yesterday. This is her job.""

1lxxip0,https://www.reddit.com/r/fednews/comments/1lxxip0/trump_officials_order_national_park_staff_to/,Trump officials order national park staff to scour gift shops for ‘corrosive ideology’ & retail items that 'inappropriately disparage Americans' |WaPo,"Trump officials have directed staff at national parks to review all items in gift shops for anti-American content, according to an internal directive reviewed by The Washington Post. The move is part of the administration’s wider campaign to scrub federal institutions of “corrosive ideology” recognizing historic racism and sexism.

The directive instructs park staff to report by Friday any retail items that have content that “inappropriately disparages Americans past or living” or that includes “matters unrelated to the beauty, abundance or grandeur” of a natural feature in its description.

President Donald Trump issued an executive order in March seeking to reshape how American history is told at federal institutions including parks and [the Smithsonian museums](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/03/29/smithsonian-african-american-museum-visitors/), blaming former president Joe Biden for casting historic U.S. milestones in a negative light. That order spurred an initiative asking national park visitors to report anti-American signs, which instead drew positive comments in support of the parks and criticisms of Trump officials for staff and budget cuts, according to [a Post review of leaked comments.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/06/30/park-service-negative-signs/)

Park advocacy groups say they are concerned that the Trump administration is attempting to sanitize American history.

“It’d be a shame to pull an actual historical accounting and a well-researched book off the shelves,” said Kristen Brengel, senior vice president of government affairs at the National Parks Conservation Association, an advocacy group.

The National Park Service said in a statement that it was acting in line with a directive by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to implement Trump’s executive order, which also applies to park associations and concession operators.

“We’re working closely with them to facilitate an efficient review that does not hinder or impede retail operations,” the Park Service said.

Brengel said park leaders face a choice of following the administration’s directive to flag everything that could possibly be deemed anti-American or following an individual park’s mission, which may be to inform the public about the civil war, Indigenous history, slavery or other topics this administration might consider defamatory of historical Americans.

“Will this result in the book stores just selling coffee table picture books? I don’t know,” she said.

She said the directive adds to the workload of parks that are already severely understaffed after the administration [fired hundreds of employees](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/02/14/national-park-service-probationary-employees-fired-hired/) and cut funding. “There is no park that can read every book on the book shelves in this time frame,” Brengel said.

The policing effort comes after the related directive to post signs at all parks requesting that visitors report anti-American content.

Thompson and Brengel said the responses received through that initiative have been overwhelmingly supportive of the parks.

Since the Park Service debuted its comment-seeking initiative, it has received at least 1,700 comments from Americans visiting forests, mountains and historic battle sites across the country, according to a spreadsheet obtained by The Post. In some instances, the spreadsheet noted responses from park staffers.

The remarks are a mix of praise for the nation’s beautiful parks and knowledgeable staff, combined with laments that the Trump administration seems determined to slash employees and budgets. Hundreds of commenters took particular issue with a Trump directive seeking to root out national park signs that are “negative about either past or living Americans.”

“The signs are great! The rangers are great. They make me proud to be an” American, someone wrote while visiting Washington’s Mount Rainier National Park in June. “I’m confused why you’re worried about a volcano having signs that portray Americans negatively. … It seems a bit overdone at a geology park.”

The commenter added: “Also if an American did something negative in the past, why shouldn’t a NPS site discuss it? History isn’t just a collection of the good stories. It’s the good and the bad.”

So rather of manually turning on the lights, adjusting the thermostat, and starting the coffee maker every morning, a ""Good Morning"" routine executes all those actions with a single command or trigger, like your alarm going off.

What I'm still a bit fuzzy on, though, is the processing power required to manage these routines, especially larger ones involving multiple devices. Is it all handled locally by the smart home hub (like a typical smart speaker), or is some data always being sent to the cloud for processing? Does the answer change depending on the complexity of the routine or the brand of devices being used? I'm curious if anyone has a deeper understanding of the backend infrastructure that makes all of this work so seamlessly.",1,1752316913.0,TechLifestyleHub,0,1.0,False

Weekends slip by faster than they should. So how about we hit pause on doomscrolling, step out of our comfort zones (and pajamas), and do something refreshingly different?

From there, we wander into one of Bangalore’s greener corners or stumble through a colorful market, just soaking in the chaos or calm, depending on the mood. When our feet (or attention spans) give out, we settle into a cozy café for coffee, or maybe cool off with ice cream that feels way too indulgent for the weather. 

And if the conversation’s still flowing, who knows—maybe a spontaneous detour to a bookshop rounds off the day just right.

But you’re afraid that if you have one, everyone will just see it as being dramatic and that you’ve just turned into a liability and they’ll let you go without being able to prepare for it?

Hi,

Call me Lei, I once started everything from scratch for a start up company. I can’t even tell you what I do, because honestly, I don’t have just 1 job title. I do everything.

When I first started with my employer, there was no one but me and now we’re about 100. I started 5 years ago. I created all the processes, built the company from scratch. Created all processes for every department, I handled clients, I supported each employee, I handled the whole operations, even billing, finance, budgeting, performance reviews, logistics, seriously, everything you could think of in running a business… I even closed sales. I actually applied as an HR, and I don’t even know why I’m here now. I mean, I’m thankful for the opportunity, can’t deny I learned a lot. Not that anyone taught me how, I just kept researching and enrolled to so much online courses so I could keep up.

Until the day I hired people under my team, given we’re growing and there was just too much to handle.

So now, I even support the legal side of the business and all.

You might be thinking, why are you doing this and where’s the boss? Isn’t he supposed to be managing those given it’s his business? You’re absolutely right! But he rarely even responds..

Why do I keep doing it? First, I need the job to support my family, and I thought I’d be irreplaceable if I just do these. And ofcourse, this is like my life’s project, it was my baby, I worked day and night for it, how many gallons of coffee I drank on those sleepless nights, how many tears I’ve cried with all the pressure on my shoulders, and I genuinely care for the people! Like, who else is gonna do this and take care of them if I don’t.

My boss and I though, even if he rarely responds and doesn’t even ask me how I’m doing, we have a pretty good relationship. To the point where I thought we were friends. We joke a round with each other, even know each other’s family.. we know what’s going on with each other’s personal life.. so you know, I thought we were on pretty solid terms..

Until one day, I received this notification that I lost access to one important tool. Which I got curious because it got transferred to someone else without my knowledge. It was a tool I’ve been handling from the beginning and I didn’t think my boss would ever be comfortable to transfer it to anyone else. So I thought it could’ve been a security breach or I am definitely getting fired. And so I panicked.. reached out to the person who it was transferred to, which is my direct report, and denied even knowing about the tool. Reached out to the vendor and thought I should flag it because it was unusual. They said they couldn’t change it without any approval from the admin (which is to whom it was transferred to).

This direct report, doesn’t have any experience in the beginning, I molded him, trained him, and shared every knowledge I could. Made sure he has a career opportunity and that he’d be able to grow…

So later I found out, he’s been feeding stuff to my boss’ head, and that boss doesn’t trust me now. Like in a blink of an eye, everything I built, everything I created, just.. gone..

That’s when I realized, your boss is not your friend. And it doesn’t matter how much you’re good to people, as long as they have a jealous eye, they’d do everything to bring you down…

I haven’t been fired yet, but now my boss is telling me to justify my salary and possibly planning to decrease it, like pushing me to the edge just to resign, probably doesn’t want to pay the separation fee..

I’m at loss for words.. I’m about to break down. I’ve always been good in handling my emotions.. but damn, this feels like I’ve been stabbed 1000000x in the heart…

I really don’t know what to do. And I feel like I’m going to explode and that I’m gonna be in a depression state soon…

1lxxayd,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitLoga/comments/1lxxayd/why_realtime_exchange_rates_matter/,Why real-time exchange rates matter?,"Let’s not dance around it — when you’re exchanging money (crypto, fiat, or anything in between), you’re not just moving numbers around. You’re playing a time-sensitive game. Blink, and the rate shifts. Grab a coffee, and boom — you’ve either scored a better deal or lost a chunk of value. It’s fast. It's slippery. It matters.

And that’s exactly why real-time exchange rates aren’t some nice-to-have feature. They’re the backbone of a smart, frustration-free exchange.

But hold up — what even *is* a “real-time rate,” really?

# So...what are we actually talking about?

Real-time exchange rates are the raw, living numbers that reflect what people are *actually* paying for currencies *right now*. Not what they paid this morning. Not what some outdated calculator tells you. These rates pulse and pivot every second — pulled around by headlines, market vibes, Twitter meltdowns, war news, or a sudden crypto whale making waves.

They’re chaotic. But that’s the point. They show you the truth, unfiltered.

# Why should you even bother?

Let me paint a picture. Say you’re swapping euros for USDT. You see a decent rate, maybe think, “Eh, I’ll click in a sec.” But in that moment of hesitation — boom — the market shifts. Suddenly, your euros buy you less. And not because you did anything wrong, but because time didn’t wait for you.

And honestly? That sucks.

Now, if you're working with real-time rates, this nonsense doesn’t happen. You see the actual number. Not an estimate. Not a vague approximation. You get a crystal-clear amount — *before* you press “Confirm.” No smoke. No mirrors. Just you and the numbers, eye to eye.

# Enter BitLoga — no BS, just clarity

We built [bitloga.com](https://bitloga.com/index.php?ref=274) with one simple goal: make exchanging fast, clear, and drama-free. That’s it.

So every time you visit, you’re not just seeing a static number — you're seeing what’s really happening *right now*. Pick your currencies, and bam — we lock in the best available rate that instant. No weird waiting, no “oops, it changed while you blinked.”

Oh, and by the way? No accounts. No logins. No labyrinth of KYC forms. Just come in, exchange, get out. Clean and done.

# If you take one thing away…

Timing isn't a detail. It’s the entire deal. Especially when it comes to crypto. One second too slow, and the price has already run off without you.

So if you want to exchange like a grown-up — with real numbers, real speed, and zero mystery — go with BitLoga. Built for humans. Not for guesswork.",1,1752316414.0,BitLoga,0,1.0,False

I’ve switched from a morning coffee fix to an evening matcha session, and I swear my sleep and stress levels have never been better.

Anyone else tried this? Or do you think caffeine at night is just asking for insomnia? Curious to hear how other people feel about nighttime matcha vs. morning coffee.

1lxx892,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1lxx892/my_daughter_keeps_drawing_me_dead/,My Daughter Keeps Drawing Me Dead,"When my daughter started drawing pictures of me dead, I thought it was just a phase. Kids are weird, right?

The first drawing showed up on the fridge a few weeks ago. I was half-awake, grabbing some coffee, when I noticed a new crayon sketch next to her usual stick-figure family doodles. But this one… was different.

The bright reds, yellows, and blues were gone, replaced by thick, messy black lines. It showed a stick figure with a crooked smile, labeled “DADDY,” impaled on a giant spike.

Blood or the crayon version of it gushed from the top of my head in heavy red streaks. I just stood there, not sure how to feel. Jenny walked in, dragging her stuffed bunny, and climbed up on the kitchen stool.

“Hey, sweetie,” I said. “What’s this one about?”

She glanced at me, completely calm. “It’s from my dream.”

“Your dream?” I laughed, a little uneasy. “That’s... intense.”

She just nodded and poured herself some cereal like nothing was wrong. I took the drawing and tossed it in the trash. That should’ve been the end of it.

Two days later, I found the second one under my pillow.

This time, the “DADDY” stick figure was being ripped apart by what looked like wild dogs round mouths full of teeth, red, angry eyes, all snarling. Again, way too much red crayon.

“Jenny,” I said when she got home from school. “These drawings... they’re starting to get kind of scary.”

She gave me a little wink. “He told me to draw them.”

“Who?”

She shrugged. “Just... the man in the walls.”

My skin crawled. I told myself it was just her imagination again, maybe something she picked up from a cartoon or a spooky kid in her class.

Still, I emailed her teacher, Mrs. Carter, just to be sure.

She replied the next morning.

*Jenny is a very imaginative child. Exceptionally talented, actually. Some kids just process the world differently. Yes, she talks a lot about her dreams. But they’re only dreams. Let me know if you'd like any resources.* — Mrs. Carter

Only dreams. Right.

A week later, something happened that I couldn’t explain.

I was out back, chopping wood near the shed. One of the big branches, thick and old, suddenly broke loose above me. I heard it at the last second before it slammed into my shoulder. The pain was blinding, but I managed to crawl away. No major injuries, just a bruised collarbone. I iced it and tried to shake it off.

That night, Jenny left another drawing on the kitchen table. It showed me by the shed, crushed under a massive branch. Blood and all. But here’s the part that made me stop cold: I was wearing the exact same hoodie as in the drawing. Same lettering. Same boots. Even the same axe.

“Jenny,” I said, my voice shaking. “When did you draw this?”

She looked up from her juice box. “Before school.”

“No, I mean... before or after I got hurt today?”

“Before,” she said, frowning a little. “But I guess I messed up. You didn’t die.”

Then she skipped away, humming to herself, leaving me alone with the picture. I checked the trash where I’d thrown the old drawings. They were all still there. Too specific. Too real. Impossible to ignore now.

\*\*\*

I started keeping a record. She made a new drawing every night,  sometimes two. Always of me. Always dying. One where I was electrocuted in the bathtub. One where I jumped off the roof. One where a plastic bag was pulled over my head, my fingers clawing at it. They were getting more detailed. More real.

Sometimes I’d wake at 3 a.m. and hear her crayons scratching from across the hall. I stopped sleeping. Then on Tuesday, I found a drawing that chilled me to the bone.

It showed me lying in bed, eyes wide open, mouth agape. Blood pouring from my ears. Above me, something massive and black, faceless, but shaped like a person. Its body was made of lines, like frozen TV static caught mid-buzz. At the top, in red crayon:

**""TOMORROW.""**

That night, I locked my bedroom door. Unplugged everything. Slept with a flashlight and a baseball bat. Every creak in the walls made me jump.

At 4:10 a.m., the baby monitor — which I hadn’t used in months — crackled to life.

No voices. Just… static. I unplugged it. 

But when I woke in the morning, the picture was gone. In its place, a new one: Same bed. Same body. Same blood. Caption:

**""YOU GOT LUCKY.""**

I confronted her. I know she’s only six. I know she’s just a child. But I was falling apart.

“What is this, Jenny? Tell me the truth.”

She looked up and for the first time, her eyes filled with tears.

“He says I have to.”

“Who?”

“The man in the wall. He talks on the radio. He tells me how you’re going to die. He says if I don’t draw it... then it really happens.”

I was shaking. 

“This isn’t real. This is... this is your imagination, sweetheart.”

“No,” she whispered. “Mommy didn’t believe me either.”

I froze.

“What do you mean?”

“She told me to stop drawing her. Said it was scary. So I stopped.” Her voice dropped lower. “Then she died.”

I couldn’t breathe. My wife, Evelyn, passed six months ago. Sudden aneurysm. No warning. Jenny had been home. She was the one who found her. I thought she’d blocked it out. Maybe she hadn’t. Or maybe...

I ran to the attic and pulled out her old sketchbooks. The ones we hadn’t touched since the funeral. Buried deep between crayon scribbles was a single page. Mom lying in a hospital bed. Bruised eyes. Blood dripping from her nose. And behind her, that same faceless, static-man figure. Dated two days before she died.

That night, I tore every drawing off the walls. Burned the sketchbooks in the fireplace. Jenny watched from the stairs, silent.

“I’m sorry,” she whispered. “But he’s still here.”

\*\*\*

We’re in a diner now, holed up at a corner table with two backpacks and nothing else. She’s sleeping beside me, clutching her bunny.

And I’m writing this because I don’t know what else to do. Maybe if someone reads it, they’ll believe me. Maybe they’ll find a way to stop it.

The last drawing...It’s still in the pocket of my coat. I haven’t looked at it since we ran. I’m unfolding it now. It’s not what I expected. It’s me sitting at a table, writing. Jenny asleep beside me.

And behind us, outside the window, is the static man, his face pressed against the glass, arms wide open, waiting. Written above in perfect, red crayon letters:

**“YOU CAN’T RUN.”**

I didn’t want to believe it. But that’s when it hit me. I’m running from something I can’t escape. I don’t know what will happen next. I don’t care. I’ll keep running. Until whatever’s coming finally catches me.

1lxx6d6,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1lxx6d6/my_daughter_keeps_drawing_me_dead/,My Daughter Keeps Drawing Me Dead,"When my daughter started drawing pictures of me dead, I thought it was just a phase. Kids are weird, right?

The first drawing showed up on the fridge a few weeks ago. I was half-awake, grabbing some coffee, when I noticed a new crayon sketch next to her usual stick-figure family doodles. But this one… was different.

The bright reds, yellows, and blues were gone, replaced by thick, messy black lines. It showed a stick figure with a crooked smile, labeled “DADDY,” impaled on a giant spike.

Blood or the crayon version of it gushed from the top of my head in heavy red streaks. I just stood there, not sure how to feel. Jenny walked in, dragging her stuffed bunny, and climbed up on the kitchen stool.

“Hey, sweetie,” I said. “What’s this one about?”

She glanced at me, completely calm. “It’s from my dream.”

“Your dream?” I laughed, a little uneasy. “That’s... intense.”

She just nodded and poured herself some cereal like nothing was wrong. I took the drawing and tossed it in the trash. That should’ve been the end of it.

Two days later, I found the second one under my pillow.

This time, the “DADDY” stick figure was being ripped apart by what looked like wild dogs round mouths full of teeth, red, angry eyes, all snarling. Again, way too much red crayon.

“Jenny,” I said when she got home from school. “These drawings... they’re starting to get kind of scary.”

She gave me a little wink. “He told me to draw them.”

“Who?”

She shrugged. “Just... the man in the walls.”

My skin crawled. I told myself it was just her imagination again, maybe something she picked up from a cartoon or a spooky kid in her class.

Still, I emailed her teacher, Mrs. Carter, just to be sure.

She replied the next morning.

*Jenny is a very imaginative child. Exceptionally talented, actually. Some kids just process the world differently. Yes, she talks a lot about her dreams. But they’re only dreams. Let me know if you'd like any resources.* — Mrs. Carter

Only dreams. Right.

A week later, something happened that I couldn’t explain.

I was out back, chopping wood near the shed. One of the big branches, thick and old, suddenly broke loose above me. I heard it at the last second before it slammed into my shoulder. The pain was blinding, but I managed to crawl away. No major injuries, just a bruised collarbone. I iced it and tried to shake it off.

That night, Jenny left another drawing on the kitchen table. It showed me by the shed, crushed under a massive branch. Blood and all. But here’s the part that made me stop cold: I was wearing the exact same hoodie as in the drawing. Same lettering. Same boots. Even the same axe.

“Jenny,” I said, my voice shaking. “When did you draw this?”

She looked up from her juice box. “Before school.”

“No, I mean... before or after I got hurt today?”

“Before,” she said, frowning a little. “But I guess I messed up. You didn’t die.”

Then she skipped away, humming to herself, leaving me alone with the picture. I checked the trash where I’d thrown the old drawings. They were all still there. Too specific. Too real. Impossible to ignore now.

\*\*\*

I started keeping a record. She made a new drawing every night,  sometimes two. Always of me. Always dying. One where I was electrocuted in the bathtub. One where I jumped off the roof. One where a plastic bag was pulled over my head, my fingers clawing at it. They were getting more detailed. More real.

Sometimes I’d wake at 3 a.m. and hear her crayons scratching from across the hall. I stopped sleeping. Then on Tuesday, I found a drawing that chilled me to the bone.

It showed me lying in bed, eyes wide open, mouth agape. Blood pouring from my ears. Above me, something massive and black, faceless, but shaped like a person. Its body was made of lines, like frozen TV static caught mid-buzz. At the top, in red crayon:

**""TOMORROW.""**

That night, I locked my bedroom door. Unplugged everything. Slept with a flashlight and a baseball bat. Every creak in the walls made me jump.

At 4:10 a.m., the baby monitor — which I hadn’t used in months — crackled to life.

No voices. Just… static. I unplugged it. 

But when I woke in the morning, the picture was gone. In its place, a new one: Same bed. Same body. Same blood. Caption:

**""YOU GOT LUCKY.""**

I confronted her. I know she’s only six. I know she’s just a child. But I was falling apart.

“What is this, Jenny? Tell me the truth.”

She looked up and for the first time, her eyes filled with tears.

“He says I have to.”

“Who?”

“The man in the wall. He talks on the radio. He tells me how you’re going to die. He says if I don’t draw it... then it really happens.”

I was shaking. 

“This isn’t real. This is... this is your imagination, sweetheart.”

“No,” she whispered. “Mommy didn’t believe me either.”

I froze.

“What do you mean?”

“She told me to stop drawing her. Said it was scary. So I stopped.” Her voice dropped lower. “Then she died.”

I couldn’t breathe. My wife, Evelyn, passed six months ago. Sudden aneurysm. No warning. Jenny had been home. She was the one who found her. I thought she’d blocked it out. Maybe she hadn’t. Or maybe...

I ran to the attic and pulled out her old sketchbooks. The ones we hadn’t touched since the funeral. Buried deep between crayon scribbles was a single page. Mom lying in a hospital bed. Bruised eyes. Blood dripping from her nose. And behind her, that same faceless, static-man figure. Dated two days before she died.

That night, I tore every drawing off the walls. Burned the sketchbooks in the fireplace. Jenny watched from the stairs, silent.

“I’m sorry,” she whispered. “But he’s still here.”

\*\*\*

We’re in a diner now, holed up at a corner table with two backpacks and nothing else. She’s sleeping beside me, clutching her bunny.

And I’m writing this because I don’t know what else to do. Maybe if someone reads it, they’ll believe me. Maybe they’ll find a way to stop it.

The last drawing...It’s still in the pocket of my coat. I haven’t looked at it since we ran. I’m unfolding it now. It’s not what I expected. It’s me sitting at a table, writing. Jenny asleep beside me.

And behind us, outside the window, is the static man, his face pressed against the glass, arms wide open, waiting. Written above in perfect, red crayon letters:

**“YOU CAN’T RUN.”**

I didn’t want to believe it. But that’s when it hit me. I’m running from something I can’t escape. I don’t know what will happen next. I don’t care. I’ll keep running. Until whatever’s coming finally catches me.

We wanted to spend $25k at most. Landed at $26k all in all with Tips!

Landed from Dubai to Narobi, stayed 2 days at the Fairmont. I think we only needed 1 day, however, we went to an amazing coffee plantation called Fairview (10/10), Giraffe Center, and some glass blown shopping. Ate at Beit E Salam (amazing!)

We used Uber all around Nairobi and felt totally safe and secure.

Flew to Ol Pejeta where we stayed at the River Camp for 2 nights - it was really peaceful and well run. We had a private 2.5 day guide Would completely recommend. Only 8 tents!

Then we flew to Masai Mara, stayed at the &beyond 3 nights. This was a lot bigger (30 tents) so more “corporate” feeling but incredibly well run and high touch. We had the absolute best guide, paired with another couple our 3 days.

Then we flew (through Nairobi) to Amboselli and stayed at Elewana for 2 nights. This was our favorite camp and food, but least favorite guide. We were paired with a couple on their first day of safari, so it was hard to match what they wanted to see VS us 6 days in.

Then we flew back to Nairobi Wilson, drove to JBO and took a Precision air flight to Zanzibar (would never recommend this airline, fyi)

Stayed at Safira Blu for 4 nights, 5 days. Loved relaxing after such a busy trip! Food was great, service was top notch.
Probably 1-2 days too many in Zanzibar given our resort was really secluded and far from Stone Town / anything else. 

We worked with a local tour operator group, Masai expeditions, who handled mostly everything for us (except flights to / from these countries)
