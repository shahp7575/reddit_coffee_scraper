1okdahu,https://i.redd.it/sdxp1sm1pbyf1.jpeg,Help! There's something seriously wrong with the auto collector,"I don't know what to do, my auto collector is completely glitched out in my barn and it's just hoarding all of my truffles and gesha coffee beans!! As you can see from the picture, my character is walking through the machine and there the prompt to interact with it doesn't come up...just that little hand. 

I've tried restarting my game, I've tried clicking around the machine and nothing. I've looked through older posts and others seemed to have had this issue with some other machines but haven't found any solutions... :'( it's also winter so I literally can't access truffles and beans and I can't use my pickaxe either cause it says there's stuff in it.",1,1761862260.0,coralisland,0,1.0,False
1okda5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Maxwell_Isekaied/comments/1okda5z/017_reuniting_lost_family/,017: Reuniting Lost Family,"Maggie had just finished making some fried chicken when she heard a soft knock at the backdoor. With a hum of expectation she wiped her hands on her apron and hurried towards the rear door in the kitchen. She looked out before opening the door and her face broke out in a huge smile. ""Evee dear! Welcome!"" she called out as she opened the door. Then gave her son's fiance a big hug. ""It's been too long. Wheres Clyde?"" She let go and led Evee inside the fraegrent kitchen, smelling of freshly fried chicken and coffee. Evee sat in her normal spot at the table. ""Clyde went to get that ridiculously colored sports car. He should be back soon with it."" She said as Maggie slid a cup of coffee towards her. ""Thanks Maggie."" she thanked the wonderful woman as she took a sip. ""You know I want you to call me mom."" Maggie chastized. 


Evee smiled into her cup. One of the best things about Clyde was his wonderful parents. ""So what's this life changing thing you couldnt say over the phone?"" ""Oh sweetie the most amazing thing happened today. You wouldn't believe who ran out of the corn towards Arnold while he was harvesting earlier."" ""It's best we wait for Clyde Maggie, that way we can tell the story once."" Arnold mentioned as he enterd the kitchen and gave Evee a small hug. ""How's my favorite daughter?"" he asked. Evee looked at the old farmer with his leathery skin and lined face. ""Im doing quite well old man."" She replied with a smile and a laugh. ""Old man? No I am as spry as a spring chicken."" ""You keep lying like that Arnold and your nose will grow."" Magggie laughed using an old family joke.  Arnold laughed ""Whatever you say dear."" ""Don't give me that 'dear' line."" she waved her finger at her husband. He smiled back at his wife and Evee watched on, loving every minute of it. 


There was a noise in the front yard like something heavy being set down. Everyone at the table looked over towards the front door at the sound. The handle turned after footfalls sounded on the porch and Clyde Conners walked into his parent's home. ""Hey Mom! Hey Dad!"" He greeted them with a big smile as he took a deep wiff of the air. ""Mmmm I love your chicken Mom. Thanks for cooking."" ""You know I love cooking for my son and daughter."" his mother told him as she fixed him a cup of coffee and started putting dinner on the table. ""Now sit down and eat. Your father and I have something important to tell you both."" Clyde sat at the table next to Evee. Arnold and Maggie both couldn't help but notice they sat together like Max and May had. Evee combed her hands through her red currly hair and tied it back before accepting the plate of food from Maggie. ""Wheres mine mom?"" Clyde asked. ""Your a big strapping lad you can get your own plate."" Maggie told him with a teasing note in her voice. Evee laughed ""Ya you big strapping lad. Go make your own plate."" she said, joining in the teasing. 


Clyde fixed a plate and the family talked and caught up. Maggie and Arnold wanting to know everything about how there jobs at the newspaper were going. Evee told them about how Clyde had predicted a nasty gangwar and how she was in line to recieve an award for her article on Titan saving people trapped in a sinking cruise ship. The elderly couple listen on as there son and future daughter talk about there lives, both parents feeling pride for what there son had acomplished. 


After the normal family catch up and talk Clyde finally asked the question. ""So Dad, what's this life changing thing that you came across in the feild and does it have anything to do with that Thunderbird that had a flat?"" Maggie and Arnold look at each outher, a thousands words spoken in a glance. Then Arnold opens his mouth and startes telling his son and future daughter a story. 


He tells them about Max and how he found May with help. How he had escaped from Rex Rucker and brought May to them. He also talks about the trip they took and how they ended up getting a flat just three miles from there destination. Then he tells his son how May flew and how he watched her drag Max into the sky. ""I remember when you were just in middle school and you pulled my arm out of socket. It hurt but I knew you didnt mean to, you just didnt know your own strength. Like her."" ""Wait Dad. Are you saying this May woman flew? What else did she do?"" ""Well she used a fingernail to press a design into solid steel and she said Bor aY' was her cousin."" 


Clyde stared at his father in shock, his ears ringing with the word 'cousin'. ""How sure are you about this Dad?"" ""Were pretty sure son."" his mother replied. Evee's eyes had gone wide ""life changing indeed."" she said. ""But Titania was lost and my family with it."" Clyde mumbled under his breath to himself. ""Well son, it appears that statement is not true anymore. One of your birth family made it out before that planet was lost forever."" Clyde's father said in a calm confident voice. That voice Clyde knew, ment his father was not joking and being deadly serious. He had heard that tone many times in his life and always knew that that tone invited no arguments. His father had just said it plain and true. Clyde had a cousin and her name was May. He still wanted to make sure so he asked. ""So where are they?""



""Oh the poor things were so tired after there long trip that your father sent them upstairs to bed."" She smiled as she told her son, remembering that sweet moment when she had found them curled together on the bed fast asleep in each other's arms. ""I checked on them earlier and there both fast asleep."" Clyde looked upstairs ""Hey no X-ray vision in the house."" his father scolded him. Clyde looked down quickly ""Sorry dad. I forgot the rule."" Evee smiled at him ""Maybe we should make that a rule at our place also. Then I wouldnt have to hide all your gifts in lead boxes."" The parents laugh at her words both remembering a time when little Clyde would search for the gifts they had hidden. Half the reason they created the rule. 


May woke to voices from downstairs. She was covered by a quilt she hadn't seen in the room when Max and her had entered. She enjoyed the smell of soap and Max as she laid with her head on his chest, listening to his heartbeat with one ear as she listened to the conversation downstairs with the other. Her cousin was here and so was his fiance. She smiled as she heard them joke and tease one another as they caught up. She hugged Max tighter as she heard Mr. Arnold telling Clyde and Evee about there journey here from Municiple City. She laughed at Arnold's explanation of how she looked when she had yanked Max into the air. Feeling bad about that again she lightly kissed Max on the forehead. ""sorry again for hurting you."" she whispered so as to not wake him. Then she carefully pulled herself away from Max and slipped silently from the room. She went to the restroom and afterwords headed downstairs to meet her cousin for the first time in 30 or more years. 


""Hi cousin."" a confident female voice said from the entryway to the kitchen. Clyde looked up and saw May. She was standing in the doorway wearing her new clothes. She had donned her new jeans, the purple silk shirt and her wide white belt. With her golden hair golden eyes and pale skin she almost looked like an angel. Clyde couldn't find the words to say. She had the same gold eyes as his birth mother from Titania and he saw other family resemblences in her cheeks and nose. ""So your my fiance's cousin from Titania? Well I am Evee it is a pleasure to meet you May."" Evee stood and introduced herself May put her fingertips together and bowed to Evee. ""It's a pleasure to meet you Evee."" she said responding to Evee's greeting. Clyde stood then and offered his hand ""Welcome to Earth cousin."" he said then was surprised when he was knocked off his feet as his cousin, May, flew into him giving him a big hug. She cried against his chest. ""I never thought I would see you again. I hope you can forgive me for not being here to take care of you."" not knowing what to do Clyde patted her on the back. ""Its ok. Your here now."" He looked at Evee pleading her to help. She stepped back with an gave him a mischievous smile. ""Shes your cousin I think I will let ya'll catch up. Besides theres still some more of your mom's tasty chicken."" With a chuckle she left Clyde laying on the floor under his crying cousin. ""There there."" he awkwardly said as he patted his cousin on her back again. She sniffled, and stood up helping Clyde up also. 


May hugged Clyde close as they stood in the entryway to the kitchen. ""May. Do you want some fried chicken?"" Maggie asked from where she sat at the kitchen table. ""What's fried chicken?"" she asked ""O. Your gonna love mom's fried chicken May."" Clyde mentioned as he walked with May back to the table. Evee had already taken her seat and was crunching into a leg of crispy chicken. May sat in the only other chair and Clyde left the room to grab another one. May took a deep breath her eyes still wet with tears, and smelled the the warm spicy aroma of fried food,. Maggie slid a plate in front of May and without a second glance she picked up a peice and took a big crunchy bite. She moaned in delight as she chewed, little lines of grease running from her lips. ""That's the best praise a cook could ask for."" Maggie responded to the noises of satisfaction May was making.  May was so caught up in the flavor that she jumped when Clyde spoke from nearby, not hearing him approach. She was that distracted by the taste of the food. ""When your..."" 


Clyde slappped May on the back as she began to choke on a mouthful of food. Dislodging it from her airway. She quickly grabbed a glass of brownish liquid, ice-cubes clinked together as she raised the cup to her lips and took a big drink to clear her throat of the disloged mass. . ""You ok?"" Clyde and Arnold asked together the same look of concern on there faces. May started laughing at the site alongside Evee. Then May started hiccuping. ""Here dear."" Maggie said as she poured more of the sweet beverage into May's glass from a pitcher. ""Have some more sweet tea. It should help with the hiccups."" ""Thanks... -hiccup- its really -hiccup- tasty. -hiccup- What's it -hiccup- called?"" May finally asked Maggie through an avalanch of hiccups. She sipped from the liquid trying to banish the horrid hiccups. Clyde and his dad looked at each other not really catching what was so funny before Clyde askes his question fully.


""What can you tell me about what happened to you and Titania?"" Clyde asked ernestly, desperately wanting to know more about the planet of his birth. May put her glass down, having defeated the hiccups for now, and took a deep breath before she looked upstairs then said ""I want Max here for this."" ""I will go get him. You get comfy."" Arnold stood and headed upstairs. Clyde looked around the table, then got up and went for another chair. Maggie stood aswell and cleared away the dishes that were no longer being used as Evee pulled a thin leather bound notebook from her shirts pocket and flipped to a blank page. She clicked her pen open and set it on the notebook and caught May watching her. ""I write news stories for a living. One day May you will be news and I want to get your story written down now."" May understood, there had been people like that on her planet. Someone had to make a record after all.



Soon enough Clyde returned with a spare chair and placed it next to Evee, where he sat. Arnold and Max came down the stairs and joined them. Soon enough Max was sitting next to May and biting into some of Maggies fried chicken. He was eating with one hand because the moment he sat down May took his other one. He didn't seem to mind and enjoyed the freshly cooked food. 


May felt it was easier to tell her story now that Max was beside her. She had told him once already and having him beside her gave her the strength to tell it again. ""When the news came out about the core instability I was kept in the dark. My mom and dad, your aunt and uncle, hid the truth from me. I don't blame them I was only 14 and still a child. So my parents pretended around me that everything was find. When it wasn't and they knew it."" She says with a little bitterness but mainly sadness her eyes glistening with unshed tears. 


""My parents and your parents tried to convince the leadership that the core would destabilize and deglove the crust from the rest of the planet. I found out about this while I was in my podschool on the trip here."" May took a sip of iced-tea and continued ""When leadership failed to respond to the danger our parents knew the planet was lost. They sold everything and moved in together, in a crappy uninsolated warehouse. They used there combined funds to design and build two escape pods. It was originally going to be one but then your Dad, Var aY', thought it was to risky to put us both in the same pod because if something happend, we would both be lost."" May takes a breath and plunges into the part of the story she hates to remember.


""We spent over a year in that warehouse, you were barely a month old when we moved in. For my part I was happy because my parents kept giving me new games to play. I didn't relize then that they were teaching me how to survive on an alien planet and how to take care of others. Games on ethics games on warfare games on life skills, I still have no idea where they found them all."" May smiles at the memory, enjoying this part of the story before it gets bad. ""Then the earthquakes started one mourning while I was playing a flight simulater, I remember because I had just unlocked my pilot's license. The ground shook then my mom was there crying as she yanked the VR helmet from my head. She rushed me to the room they had been building the escape pods in. I saw you Bor aY', you were screaming as loud as you could as your parents hugged you tightly. Then I watched them place you in your pod, just as my dad pulled me into a big hug. He squeezed me like he would..."" May gives a sob and Max squeezes her hand gently before she continues. ""Then mom was hugging me with him. They both... they both told me how much they loved me and how important my mission was. I had no idea what they were talking about, I was scared and could hear explosions, crashing and screams from all around the city. The ground never stopped rumbling and that's when I had relized why our parents moved us into that horrid warehouse. No matter how much the ground shook the warehouse just seemed to sway with it. I will never forget those hanging lights high above dancing as the building rolled with the earthquake. There was a noise of metal hydrolics and I could no longer hear your cries as your parents sealed you inside the pod. My parents soon had me in my own, I tried to stop them from putting me in that small box but they had me buckled in and the hatch closed before I could even tell them goodbye."" She takes a shuddering breath, clamping her emotions down tears now running down her cheeks in fat drops. 


""They stood back with your parents and waved. While your mom, aunt Jal Ay', crying held up a remote and pressed a button. With a rumble our pod's rockets started up and launched through holes cut in the roof of the warehouse. I watched as the rockets backwash rolled across the warehouse burning everything, including our parents, to ash. I then watched through the little window as Titania cracked and flew apart as our pods sped up to portal speed. I remember a bright red smear that started to grow across the planet before there was a flash and my pod started to tumble. I glimpsed yours one last time as the portal opened and it slipped inside. It took my pod months to build up to portal speed but by then I was already in stasis enrolled into podschool."" She paused then not willing to talk further about her years of isolation in that damned pod prison. Maggie reached across the table and patted May's cheeks dry. ""Well you have a new family here. If you will have us."" she said with warmth and kindness. May sobbed ""Thank you Maggie."" ""Call me mom."" ",1,1761862235.0,Maxwell_Isekaied,0,1.0,False
1okd9sq,https://www.reddit.com/r/halloween/comments/1okd9sq/my_mom_loved_halloween_heres_a_few_of_my_silly/,My mom loved Halloween. Heres a few of my silly childhood memories,"Sharing a few  Halloween memories from my childhood. My mom loved Halloween. 

1) One year she put on my grandfathers big old overalls, but the kind with arms in it. She put on men’s shoes, and had leaves sticking out of the armholes and neck area. Also she had on oversized gloves and a paper bag with peek holes over her head. She sat slumped a little sideways on our front porch to look like a dummy, or scarecrow decoration. ( I stayed home that year to pass out candy)  When  parents would bring their children to the door, she’d slowly reach over and wrap her hand around an ankle of parents. ( never did this to small kids, but big ones? Yes)  Im telling you, these parents would jump off the porch running for the road! Often leaving their kids only to come back and grab their kids. It was so funny. 

2) I was spending the night with a friend (sandy) my mom came over  there unexpected. She had on a long trench coat, men’s pants, shoes and gloves. ( she always said hands and feet would give her away)  head covered with a paperbag again. Anyhow, she doesn’t knock, doesn’t speak, just comes into the house kitchen and starts to make herself coffee. We, including myself, had no idea who it was. I remember we all were sitting at the kitchen table just starring at her until she decided to let us know it was her. Today you’d prob get shot trying something like this. 

3) the most embarrassing story… I was in high school! ( I know right? High school!) she walks into my class room dressed completely like an entire clown. 🤡 unrecognizable. She quietly walked in and sat at the back of the classroom. We all sort of giggled, but carried on. Then she got up and walked out. Nobody, including me had no idea what or who the clown was. 
After that class, I met my HS boyfriend at my locker between classes to get a little smooching in. All of the sudden the crazy clown walks up to me and whispers, “no kissing in the hallways” 
Of course I recognized my mom’s voice and whispered back, “omg! Mom, get outta here before anyone figures out you’re my mom!”",1,1761862208.0,halloween,1,1.0,False

1okd521,https://i.redd.it/bpl4qfswnbyf1.jpeg,money bowl tutorial,"what a money bowl is
it’s not a wishing jar or aesthetic decor. it’s a living container that holds the energy of flow, gratitude, and circulation. think of it as a tiny ecosystem of reciprocity — what you feed, feeds you back.

when to make it
waxing moon, Thursday, or any day you feel open and grounded. avoid doing it when you’re anxious or rushing — that energy clogs it.

⸻

you’ll need
	•	a small bowl (ceramic, glass, or copper)
	•	coins or cash
	•	rice, sugar, or salt as a base
	•	a green candle
	•	herbs and oils that call to you (basil, cinnamon, bay, clove, allspice, coffee, rosemary, honey, olive oil)
	•	a written petition

⸻

the setup
	1.	cleanse the bowl. rinse it with salt water or smoke it with rosemary. whisper, “clear what’s stale, invite what’s real.”
	2.	lay your base — rice for stability, sugar for sweetness, or salt for purification. this is the bed your prosperity sits on.
	3.	add your money — coins, small bills, or even digital tokens written on paper (paypal, etsy shop name, etc).
	4.	dress it with herbs — basil for flow, cinnamon for ignition, coffee for speed, bay for luck. go by instinct, not recipe.
	5.	anoint with oil or honey. just a few drops. too much makes it sticky, too dependent.
	6.	write your petition. keep it specific: “Money flows to me through my art, my clients, my ideas, and my consistency. I handle it with grace.” fold toward you and place under the bowl.
	7.	light the green candle on top and say:
“I call in flow, not chase. I call in wealth that stays and circulates. What I give, returns multiplied, steady, and kind.”

⸻

care & feeding
	•	stir the coins or base weekly with your fingers. that re-animates the spell.
	•	add a dollar, coin, or pinch of herbs when you receive money.
	•	refresh fully every lunar cycle or when it feels energetically heavy.
	•	never let it gather dust — a money bowl is meant to live, not sit.

⸻

disposal or renewal

if the energy feels done or stagnant, take the coins out, wash them, and spend them intentionally (food, offerings, business materials). bury the herbs and rice, and thank the bowl for its service.

1okd1jm,https://i.redd.it/pclbigl7nbyf1.jpeg,"pumpkins in spellwork, fully unpacked","why pumpkins matter
pumpkins are guardians and vessels. they’re tied to harvest, protection, prosperity, and light in the dark. every culture that’s touched them has seen them as both food and shield — fullness with teeth. magically, they hold the power to contain, illuminate, and preserve. that’s why they’re used for wealth work, warding, manifestation jars, and ancestor offerings.

how you carve or prepare them changes the current
	•	whole and uncut holds energy. perfect for abundance or grounding spells that need time to ripen.
	•	carved with openings releases energy outward. used for protection, illumination, or banishing.
	•	hollowed and filled turns it into a cauldron or womb for manifestation. ideal for prosperity, beauty, or new creation.
	•	burned or buried transforms energy — end-of-cycle workings, cord-cutting, or final releases.

core correspondences
	•	planet and day: Sun and Sunday for illumination, Jupiter and Thursday for abundance, Saturn and Saturday for protection
	•	elements: earth for stability, fire for drive and manifestation
	•	colors: orange for joy and success, green for growth, white for purity and spirit, black for protection
	•	zones of the fruit: flesh for nourishment and grounding, shell for containment, seeds for fertility and continuation

prep that keeps your spells clean
	•	wash the pumpkin before working to clear old energy.
	•	speak your purpose before cutting; pumpkins hold intention fast.
	•	keep seeds if you’re working for growth — plant or bury later as a living continuation of the spell.
	•	if you burn candles in it, keep the walls thick enough for safety; the shell acts as a ward.

⸻

seven ways to work with pumpkins

1) prosperity cauldron
cut the top, hollow it, and fill it with coins, bay leaves, cinnamon, sugar, basil, and a petition about wealth. light a green candle inside and say, “what I build, I keep; what I keep, multiplies.” when the candle finishes, bury the remains to root the energy.

2) protection jack
carve a simple face or symbol on the front. inside, add salt, cloves, and rosemary. light a black or white candle within and place it at your doorway. it turns away jealousy and ill intent while letting good energy pass.

3) ancestral lantern
use a small pumpkin as a candle holder on your ancestor altar. carve a few holes so the light breathes. add coffee grounds and honey inside as offerings. light it while you speak names or thanks. the glow acts as both offering and beacon.

4) beauty and magnetism spell
cut the pumpkin horizontally. in the base, add rose petals, sugar, honey, and cinnamon. place a pink candle on top and let the wax drip inside. this draws attention and charm that feels natural, not forced.

5) transformation and release ritual
write what you’re ready to let go of on slips of paper. place them inside a hollow pumpkin with salt and sage. as the candle burns on top, imagine the shell holding your pain until it can compost it. when finished, bury or smash the pumpkin in running water.

6) creative fire spell
carve a spiral or flame design. inside, place a petition for inspiration, along with orange peel, ginger, and clove. light an orange candle and visualize your creative energy rising. this one’s great before launches, art, or new business ventures.

7) love and warmth working
bake small pumpkin pieces with honey, cinnamon, and a touch of vanilla. eat mindfully while affirming, “I receive warmth, care, and devotion.” the act of eating binds it to your body — beauty through nourishment, not deprivation.

⸻

timing, tools, and tiny upgrades
	•	moon: waxing for growth and attraction, full for manifestation, waning for release and protection
	•	days: Thursday for abundance, Sunday for empowerment, Saturday for warding
	•	oils that pair well: pumpkin seed oil, cinnamon leaf, clove, vanilla, orange
	•	supporting herbs: bay, basil, rosemary, sugar, honey, coffee
	•	disposal choices: bury for long-term magic, compost for renewal, smash for release

⸻

pumpkin anatomy as spell map
	•	skin: barrier and protection
	•	flesh: abundance and sustenance

1okd12a,https://www.reddit.com/r/CommercialRealEstate/comments/1okd12a/the_bilt_rewards_ceo_session_at_blueprint_vegas/,"The Bilt Rewards CEO session at Blueprint Vegas was mind-blowing. They're not just a rewards program; they're building the ""Apple Ecosystem"" for Multifamily","**The speaker was Ankur Jain, the CEO of Bilt Rewards**

This guy is building something way bigger than a credit card. He's going after the entire **$2 trillion annual housing spend**—what he calls the largest single capital flow in the economy.

Here are my top 3 takeaways from his talk:



# 1. The ""Strategic Capital"" Fundraising Model



This was a masterclass for any tech founders here. Jain was adamant about *not* taking traditional VC money too early.

>

Instead, Bilt’s early backers were his *end-users*: **Blackstone, Related, Starwood, and Camden**.

He spent 18 months in deep, iterative development with their leasing, tech, and operations teams. He got real-world feedback to build a product that *actually* solved their problems, not one that just looked good in a pitch deck. They focused on product-market fit above all else.



# 2. The Vision: It's an ""Ecosystem,"" Not a ""Program""



This is the part that blew my mind. Bilt isn't just about earning points on rent. The real vision is to create a fully connected ""ecosystem"" for residential life, much like Apple has for its devices.

The goal is to connect the apartment building with the entire neighborhood.

>

He described a future where a resident can go to a local coffee shop, fitness studio, or grocery store and simply say, **""Charge my card at my building.""** They've already integrated 40,000 local and national merchants.

For residents, it's a huge value-add that's gamified (earning miles, building credit). For landlords, it creates an incredibly ""sticky"" platform that residents actively search for when choosing a new building.



# 3. The Scale is Staggering



The numbers he shared were wild:

* Launched in **2022** and already has **5 million users**.
* Company is valued at **$11 billion**.
* Jain claims **ONE IN FOUR** multifamily properties in the US now runs on the Bilt platform. (I had to rewind that in my head—that's insane market share in \~3 years).
* He projects that by 2026, **one in seven US** ***mortgages*** will run end-to-end through Bilt.

As a shopping center owner, my mind was racing. He's building a platform that knits together small businesses and local retailers directly with thousands of apartment residents. It’s a powerful way to ""find your tribe"" and build real-world community post-COVID.

Curious what this community thinks:

1. Are any multifamily operators here actually using Bilt? What's the real-world experience?
2. Does that ""1-in-4"" stat feel legit to you?
3. Is this the ""killer app"" for residential, or is it just smart marketing?

I've been experiencing intermittent left abdominal pressure/pain that is usually under my left rib and sometimes radiates into my lower left quadrant and flank.

I'm still trying to figure out what the triggers are but I sometimes experience it the most after I eat heavy meals and maybe coffee. Other times, it'll pop up even if I haven't had anything to eat or drink yet.

As far as my stools go, they're usually loose stools and I'd say they're #5 and #6 on the Bristol stool test.

A year ago, I brought it up to my Doctor and she sent me for an abdominal/pelvic CT scan which came back clear. Around then, it wasn't popping up as much but was still worth the mention. Over the last couple of months, I'd say it's popping up more intermittently than before. No other symptoms present.

I'm trying to wait until health insurance open enrollment as I'm on workers comp as the CT scan I got last year was $400 out of pocket.

It’s been growing (from a 5 gallon) into this space for 1 year. Currently 5’4” height.  

1. Should I shape it to be “single” or “multi-trunk? Would this currently be considered “multi”? (I feel like I see mixed info online for which is better re: strength/disease/wind resistance). 

2. Is this the age to start shaping? or do I leave it to do it’s thing for a while longer? 

3. Should I remove supports ever? If so when? (I realize the tomato planter is bit weird… but it was initially to protect it from getting snapped by pedestrians who sometimes sit on the planter). 

Context: Zone 10A, LA-San Fernando Valley summers & and occasional Santa Ana winds. 
Between Sunset zone 20 & 23. 
It was planted from 5 gallon into this large park strip/alley adjacent planter space about 1 year ago (fall 2024). 
Triangle is roughly: 6’ X 8.5’ X 9.5 ft. 
It is not connected to automatic irrigation. 
There is a staked piece of drip line, snaking along top of soil, w/5-6emitters. I manually drag a hose out, attach it, and water deeply every 2-3 weeks in the peak summer heat. Generally I’ve been going “less is more” w/water to encourage it to root down. 
Full Sun spot, hit with sunset sun, stucco wall gets pretty warm.

For yrs, prior owner had a massive multi trunk jacaranda in this same space— that provided beautiful shade for the attached shed (and nearby fast food/coffee house workers who like to take breaks here) but it was at max life/diseased and clearly way too big a tree to have ever been placed in this spot and stay healthy. We removed it when we moved in. Ground down the stump, drilled in stump killer for prescribed time, and planted shallow rooted succulents in planter for an about 2 years before trying this Palo Verde here. 
I’m not deeply attached to any of the succulents if you think any are a problem for the tree…But they help keep weeds (and cigarette butts) out + act as living mulch…

Thank you for any thoughts/tips!

And what changes have you made in your daily life that help reduce waste or over-consumption?,"I've recently realised how different views can be between the city where I currently live and my home city when it comes to waste reduction and over-consumption. I know that there are definitely different view points on this between different cultures and countries, but I hadn't quite realised how different things could be within one country. In my current city (Wellington, New Zealand) I feel like the community is just generally more conscious of not over-consuming and trying to reduce use of single use disposable products. People in general are really into thrift stores, many cafes and restaurants consciously steer people away from using single use coffee cups, takeaway containers etc., there are very active city-wide zero waste pages where people are able to post things they're wanting to get rid of and find new homes for them instead of going to landfill etc., people are much more into composting and have community compost for those that can't have their own, fruit and vege markets are much more accessible and have more packaging free and affordable options than supermarkets and there are many stalls or shops that have bottle/jar return systems and shops selling dry goods where you can use your own reusable packaging are much more commonplace and easily accessible. I've also noticed people being generally more conscious of not over consuming. In my home city of Auckland (it's a much bigger city than Wellington), it still feels like people are generally less conscious of reducing waste and buying more consciously even though there is now a city wide food waste/compost scheme which is very new. Finding refilleries where you can use your own packaging for dry goods are far less common and most people would buy their fruit and veges from supermarkets and are less concerned with fruits and veges in plastic packaging. Of course, there are times and places where single use products are unavoidable, but I feel many places still widely use these where they are not really necessary. 

What are attitudes like where you live? Do you feel that things are getting better or worse? Are there any changes you've made that have helped you and your family or community reduce waste? Do you notice your city/country making more changes towards reducing waste or is it just not a big priority where you live?",2,1761861037.0,AskWomenOver30,0,1.0,False

1okcjmm,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/1okcjmm/i_think_im_experiencing_a_rare_but_highly/,I think I'm experiencing a rare but highly specific symptom of cancer,"Howdy folks. I'm 22F, this is a throwaway account because I have a difficult time talking about this. Some perspective would be greatly appreciated because I genuinely feel crazy sometimes.

Back in March, I was out for a drink with my friends when I got a sudden stabbing pain in one spot of my neck, about 5 minutes after I starting drinking. For context: I'd say I rarely drink, about 10 drinks per year for the last 3 years or so. I didn't have this issue at all the last time I had a drink, which was New Years Eve. It was pretty intense at first, but once I stopped drinking the pain subsided to just a dull ache within an hour, hurt the rest of the night, and was gone by morning. I figured maybe I had grown allergic to a syrup or fruit in the drink (although I've had this same drink at this same restaurant before). Several weeks later, I had a glass of wine, and got the same pain. That's when I put it together in my head that it was the alcohol causing it.

I know they say not to Google symptoms because Google will always tell you it's cancer. But I didn't have a primary care doctor at time time, and pretty much no concern around my health in general. I was exercising and eating a decent diet. Guess I'm just trying to explain my mindset at the time, and that my immediate reaction to the symptom itself was not anxiety. It was more like, ""Is a Benadryl going to fix this?""

Anyways, I looked it up and read a little bit about pain in a swollen lymph node triggered by drinking alcohol is a rare but specific symptom of lymphoma, particular Hodgkin's lymphoma. I felt around the area I was having the pain and thought I felt a hard lump, sort of in between my ear and chin. I wasn't having other symptoms, so I wasn't really freaking out. I saw a PCP, they did an ultrasound, and found a slightly enlarged, reactive lymph node in the spot I was having the alcohol pain.

What followed were months of new symptoms and tests and seeing many doctors with no answers, so I will keep this part short the best I can.
- After the ultrasound I had a positive ANA (1:320 w/ nuclear/homogeneous pattern). It's been tested two times since and has came back the same each time, the most recent being a month ago. Also showed vitamin D deficiency but I've gotten that to normal levels.
- I've seen two rheumatologists. The PCP I saw ordered a basic autoimmune panel. The first rheumatologist rechecked those panels, checked for fungal infection, as well as some vascular autoimmune panels (I had HSP in 2021). The second rheumatologist I saw ran A LOT of different blood tests checking for antibodies, inflamation, infection, and immune function. I was told both times that there's no rheumatological explanation for what's going on, and that my immune system is functioning fine.
- An ultrasound in May showed the lymph node had grown slightly in size, and two new reactive lymph nodes were found in the same area. Then I had a CT in July, and the report said there were no reactive lymph nodes at all, even though the same lymph nodes that had been labeled reactive multiple times in the past measured larger than they did in the previous ultrasound. The report also described ""irregular lymph nodes of normal morphology"" which really confused me. I can't remember all the measurements off the top of my head, but I think the largest is 1.9 cm (I know that's not anything crazy; but it's not really the size that's concerning me, it's the alcohol pain).
- I've had a full course of antibiotics in April for something unrelated to all this.

As for the main symptoms I'm experiencing now:
-  Around April, I started having fatigue. Every day since then, it's like I wake up a little more drained than the day before. I don't feel a strong difference day to day, but it's been slowly worsening over time. It doesn't get better with sleep or rest. I don't drink caffeine, besides an occassional Dr. Pepper, but no coffee or energy drinks. My vitamin D is back up where it should be and I feel more fatigued than I did when it was low. It's my most constant, debilitating symptom. I struggle to stand for more than 15 minutes without something to lean on, lose steam after about an hour of being up, and really need to rest after about 3 hours. I am sleepy all of the time but I keep myself awake fine. It's much more of a physical fatigue, like my muscles are constantly exhausted. It feels like I'm constantly moving through molasses, or made of lead. Every hour of every day.
- I get sporadic night sweats, also slowly worsening over time. Not in frequency, but in intensity. When they started, it was just dampness around my shirt collar and hairline. Now, when I get them, I'll wake up at night soaking wet all over (even my arms and legs) and freezing cold. Then I change clothes, and still wake up damp. It's less frequent than it used to be when I first started having them. I'd say they're uncommon now, but intense when I do have them.
- I lost 15 pounds over about 3 months without any changes to diet or exercise. This was back when I wasn't as symptomatic as I am now.
- Persistant nausea, which I take Reglan for.

I also want to add I understand mental health can play a huge factor in how we feel physically. I struggled with mental health a lot as a teen, and did a whole lot of therapy from ages 12-17. I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder Type 2 at the end of last year, and after starting on a new medication, I was doing much better mentally than ever before, until all of this happened. I started on another medication I feel like is beneficial, I did an intensive outpatient program, as well as individual therapy. I've been looking into TMS therapy. I've gotten some benfit out of it but it hasn't helped many of my physical symptoms, so it can't all be somatic.

I see my primary care doctor in a week and I'm extremely nervous. I spoke with an NP at my last appointment, and asked if there was any plan to address the alcohol pain. I was told it's likely related to an autoimmune condition that was not showing up on blood tests. They want me to see another rheumatologist in January, and if she rules out that symptom being autoimmune related, they'll refer me to an allergist. I feel really uncomfortable with this treatment plan. There's been discussion of a biopsy in the past but it's always been denied based on the reasoning that the lymph nodes were only slightly enlarged, and not at the size that would warrant a biopsy. And maybe insurance wouldn't approve it unless they get to a specific size. But I feel like all my other symptoms, especially that alcohol pain, aren't being taken into consideration.

I'm not claiming to have cancer, obviously I don't want cancer, but I feel especially concerned now that so many other things have been ruled out. This probably isn't a very relatable situation but if anyone has advice or encouragement I could really use some.",2,1761860388.0,ChronicIllness,0,0.75,False

I need a lot of guidance with my financial situation and cannot afford to pay for someone to help me professionally.

I have always been very financially responsible, until I got into my last relationship. It was very toxic and I ended up having to pick up a lot of financial slack from my partner, which meant living beyond my means, opening multiple credit cards, etc. just to pay the bills.

I left that relationship, and ended up losing my job after. I moved into a new apartment which costs less than my last, and got a new job which also pays about half as much as I made at my last job.

Please no judgement as I have been struggling to keep everything on track. I am hoping to be able to get a second job but it is a bit difficult due to the hours in my current position and the current job market as well.

Anyway,

I have three credit cards, totaling to $10,130.58 in debt.

1.	⁠$4,218.92
2.	⁠1,028.90
3.	⁠$4,882.76

I am also behind on my utilities, both are at about $400 at the moment.

I am struggling as I only make between $1,200.00- $1,400.00 per pay check.

Ignoring all of my debts, this is what my expenses a month look like Rent - $1,500.00 Groceries - $200.00 Utilities -$200.00/$300 depending Cat food - $250.00 (my cat is on prescription food, so this is non negotiable.) This does not include miscellaneous things like monthly transportation, cat litter, cleaning supplies, laundry, etc. on the high end, this leaves me with anywhere from $250.00- 650.00 a month (that is if I do not decide I want a coffee, or to go out one night etc.)

Additionally, this does NOT include health insurance (which I currently do not have but of course will need, which will be anywhere from $227.00 -$320.00) a month.

Anyway, now that I've outlined all that, I am really trying to get my credit card debt down as it just keeps increasing and it is looming over me.

For the card labeled as (1), the $4,218.92 amount, I have the option to settle my debt for $1,687.57 which would be 3 payments of $562.53 paid by 27 January 2026.

1.	⁠is this wise, as I know settling it will stay on my report (for 7 years apparently per google)
2.	⁠is it going to damage my credit more than help it?
3.	⁠if I do opt to do that, I have no clue how to budget the rest of my income to support myself for the next three months.
4.	⁠ties in with question 2, will this impact my ability to get student loans?

Any advice will help, and again please be nice as I really am trying to fix my situation 😭",2,1761860231.0,FinancialPlanning,1,1.0,False

I don’t mind looking old, but I don’t want to look sick or like I don’t care to take care of myself. The bloating, the hair that looks like I’m a meth addict, the red eyes, the dark circles… it feels like more than perimenopause. 

I’m not sleeping terribly. I get anywhere from 7-8 hours. 

Last night I went down a rabbit hole about breast implant illness (BII) and saw pictures of women’s faces before and after removal surgery and the before looked like my face. I’ve had implants for 5 years now. Now I’m wondering if some of what I’m dealing with is actually BII instead of just peri. I’m know I’m in peri as well, but I’m just thinking that this might be an additional issue I could be dealing with. 

Or maybe I’m just looking for something to blame that I can actually control instead of accepting that this is my new face? I don’t know. I’m really bummed about it all. I hate not being able to look like I take care of myself when I spend time and money doing so. 

I’d love to hear any thoughts, supportive encouragement, advice, or even just comments of solidarity. It’s so hard to figure all this stuff out when it all goes to hell. ",3,1761860207.0,Perimenopause,2,1.0,False

1okcdq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/EndPowers/comments/1okcdq4/pirates_and_picketers/,Pirates and Picketers,"Ever since the Longxi Clique had captured Shanghai, it had been exerting more and more pressure on the coasts, which had once been dotted by pirate settlements, seafarers not too keen to listen to a warlord’s thoughts. A plan was put together in consecutive board room meetings with the whole alliance of warlords. They sent in a double pronged attack: firstly their fledgling navy, which intercepted pirate ships and contested the coasts (but could never conquer the vast waters just on its own), and secondly their tax apparatus, which entered the cities and demanded above-board, approved, and scrutinizable economic activity. As before, the clique was never a conqueror: it always came in to set right disobedience and disorder in places already theirs. 


The plan had a few hiccups, such as the first naval battle of Wenzhou, a pirate stronghold, which the pirates won, and the second naval battle of Wenzhou, which was a pyrrhic victory for the warlords. The modest navy they had built was sunken down to something pitiful, and so they had to rely on the second prong much more heavily. The tax collectors were of course unwelcome, but in their guarded offices in the middle of the city they could not be budged out of their position by the townsfolk. From Shanghai to Shantou strung a network of Longxi ports under the watchful eye and brush of authorized administrators. Trade outside these ports was piracy: trade inside was tallied and taxed. The pirates reluctantly became dockworkers, and they felt the blisters on their hands grow and their wages shrink. The end of the pirate way of life doomed many to drudgery, loading crate after crate of coffee and tea onto boats going to shores they once knew as fine places to extract tribute. 

But whispers spread clandestinely of a most interesting revelation: the crates were not their burden, but their greatest weapon. That is, if the crates don’t flow, the clique’s coffers stop growing heavier. So whose bullion was it really, and who really held the cards? The pirates-turned-laborers initiated a double pronged attack of their own. A plan was put together in consecutive hidden meetings under bridges and ships’ decks: firstly they seized ships full of freight and fled into the sea towards Taiwan to rebuild a pirate navy, and secondly they organised a strike in as many ports as they could reach, halting the clique’s incomes until their demands were met. Those demands differed in each port city: most called for taxes to be lowered, sometimes they called for tax collectors to move their offices outside the city, but Wenzhou alone went the furthest in calling for total independence from  the clique’s administration. 

Now it was time for the warlords’ retort. Upon hearing the news, Cao Junwei got on a plane and flew to Wenzhou. He cursed the whole way there that this was betrayal, this was disorder, and this was devilry. His approach would be totally uncompromising: he would line up soldiers to enter the city, break the pickets, and arrest the strike leaders. His men could be scabs until the pirates got any notion of further disobedience firmly out of their heads. After he put down the rebellion in Wenzhou, he would move on to the other coastal cities one by one.",1,1761859984.0,EndPowers,0,1.0,False

1okcd8r,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1okcd8r,Chile or chilly??? Dun dun dunnnnn,"It's been awhile so I'm coming back with a review of a Daff Chilean MRE. It was packed in 2019 and expired in 2022 and I got it from Waffels. This pasta pomodoro with canned apricots, berry jam, big cracker, raisins & peanuts, isotonic drink, coffee, sugar, salt, FRH and that amazing Daff utensil. I finished up my meal with a snort of Four Roses Single Barrel to kills the bugs and MREGene's new review. Plus I wanted some bourbon to end my work day. 

I'll start with the bad. The apricots, ""jam"" and isotonic were spoiled. Pics 6-8 are the drink , jam and apricots. The drink was basically a clump of sugar with pineapple flavoring. It reminded me of brown sugar in it's consistency. It took a bit to dissolve but when I tasted it the burn was rough. More like alcohol than anything else. Real sugar in a moist environment, no doubt it started fermenting. The apricots were very oxidized, no biggie, but the smell was the dead giveaway. It had that sickly sweet rotting smell that only fruit can do. The alleged jam was more like a fruit water. I've never seen jam with that consistency before. It was also fermenting. All of these are 0/10 but I will not hold that against the rest of the ration. Also someone please teach Chile how to make jams and jellies. 

I'll start with the coffee. This has to be the darkest roast instant coffee I've ever had. If you love really dark roast coffee, you'll enjoy this. It's super robust (almost overkill). This could be instant espresso or something really close even the package states coffee. Maybe Chileans drink really dark, strong coffee. Makes a great cup though and 7/10 for me. I ended up with 2 packs of sugar. One of the 6, yes 6, packs of sugar was busted. But don't worry his 5 amigos are there to save your ass. The raisins & peanuts are the sum of their parts. At least the peanuts were roasted. The first peanut I tried had a little off taste but the rest were fine. Normally I consider raisins an abomination and their use should be considered a war crime but in this case these were pretty good. 6.5/10 because of the roasted peanuts. Other countries could learn from this. Plain nuts suck...add a little fire to send the tastebuds soaring. 

The surprising star of the meal are the big crackers. I was fully expecting something liked a French salted biscuit or MRE style savory cracker. Instead these are more like a shortbread cookie and are absolutely amazing. Especially paired with the coffee. They were in perfect condition and incredible. Not overly sweet and a crispy, crumbly, buttery texture. 10/10 for me. 

Now for the main attraction. Pasta pomodoro or pasta in tomato sauce. It looks like canned pasta with tomato sauce. Reminds me of Chef boyardee but better. I'm used to Sunday gravy that's this deep, rich red with loads of flavor. My Granny was a great cook and spaghetti with meatballs was my favorite meal that she made. It was my birthday meal all through college. This is definitely not that. My biggest gripe is the over cooked pasta hence the chef boyardee reference. But that's where the similarities end. The chef is a almost sickly sweet mess that I still indulge in from time to time. The sauce actually tasted more like a fresh tomato sauce rather than a Sunday gravy. Overall this is a very mid main. The sauce is bland and kind of one note. I heated by boiling in water as I normally do because the FRHs stink and can be hit or miss. Visually there's not much to look at either. It really could've done with some basil for a pop of green and flavor. For bland rations though, look no further than your favorite hot sauce to set things right. I did a few squirts of garlic Tabasco and it's exactly what the dish needed to shine brighter. The vinegary heat with the punch of garlic took the sauce from bleh to bam. This is a 4/10 without the hot sauce because of the pasta texture and the blandness of the sauce. With the Tabasco it went to 6/10. If I were going to make this at home, I'd puree several fresh Roma tomatoes with several cloves of garlic. Then I'd saute up a little bit of onion and more thinly sliced garlic be for adding the puree and finishing with some finely chopped basil and parsley. Maybe even throw a few sundried tomatoes and the oil in the puree to add more depth and sweetness. Right before al dente pasta tossed with it. Hot damn there's dinner. 

Overall for what I could eat I'd give the ration a 6/10. I'd love to get one that's a recent pack date to retry and rescore so I can have the whole meal. But seriously thanks Waffels for the opportunity to experience food from a place I'll probably never travel to. This is a huge part of this hobby for many of us. ",4,1761859950.0,MRE,0,1.0,False
1okcd54,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1okcd54/cousin_has_ruined_relationship_with_nearly_all/,Cousin has ruined relationship with nearly all extended family by spreading rumors. How do I earn back my family's trust?,"I (17F) and my older cousin (18F) have always been somewhat friends since we were young. She was adopted into her family as a baby, and I was always hanging around her when I was little, as I didn't have many friends. We vented EVERYTHING to each other. Things started to change as we got older. She started convincing me to leave my younger sister out of things, and doing things that I knew were wrong but would follow her around nonetheless. 

Things got bad when one day, when I had turned 14 I believe, she was visiting with her parents and she wanted to see a game I had told her about. I was grounded at the time (Due to waking up late for homeschool) and was not allowed to play video games, but she didn't know how to use the console so I turned it on and opened the game for her. My older brother walked in, and suddenly she told him that I was trying to play games even though she told me I shouldn't.  
He believed her, and I left the room nearly in tears. She spread that story around to my whole family, and I vented it out to my dad. He helped me get over it, but her mother and father didn't know about the situation at all. 

Queue the second situation. My younger sister, my cousin and I were hanging out in my room. My cousin mentioned her adoption, and my little sister was surprised and asked why she was adopted, thinking she had been part of the family by blood the whole time. She was 8, so didn't know how to word it right.  
So I told my little sister with my cousin there that my aunt was unable to have kids and explained why- not thinking it was anything too sensitive. That was my bad at the time, and I see now it may have hurt my cousin's feelings a bit. She told my aunt, my aunt scolded me, and I wasn't sure why at the time as I had just been trying to help my little sister understand.

Now, they visited two weeks ago, and we went out from coffee. When I returned, I learned some things after she went back to the college that really, really hurt me. The entire time we have been together, hanging out since we were kids, she has compiled a physical list of things that I have ""lied"" about, and shared it with her mother. She told her mother (My aunt) that I said she was cursed for not having kids. She told her that I had been communicating with one of my aunt's foster children (Who treated my oldest sister very badly in college) And has told her mother that I lie about anything and everything I can get the chance at.

My aunt believes that her child is perfect- that she would never lie and that she has raised her to be the sweetest woman, when in reality she has just never told her mother a lot of things. In our time hanging out, I've learned that despite her mother thinking otherwise, she vapes/does drugs/hangs out with multiple men (No s\*x that I know of) and gets drunk at house parties in college, which is something I know for certain her mother condemns.

Despite of all of this, I can't tell my aunt that her daughter is leading her on and making me look like a horrible person. I absolutely love my aunt, and she is the most incredible woman when it comes to keeping her family safe- and I thought our relationship was wonderful until I learned this. My cousin heard that I learned of the lies she spread about me, and has blocked me on everything. 

What do I do? My aunt hates me, my uncle doesn't trust me either, and even my own parents are doubting me. I want to mend my relationship with my aunt, but I can't talk to her at all without her believing that I am lying. Any proof I have would be pushed aside, and I know my aunt (Like my dad, her brother) is not the most level-headed person in some situations and may blow up at me, think I'm being disrespectful, or just think that I'm trying to hurt her relationship with her daughter.",1,1761859943.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

1okcc57,https://i.redd.it/ge4ip1g3hbyf1.jpeg,Is it safe to continue using grouphead when the coating has worn off?,"Recently purchased 2011 classic from eBay and set about fully disassembling and cleaning. 

Reading this sub and other places online, avoided submerging the boiler in descaler and getting the elements wet, but didn't see any concerns with descaling grouphead.

Soaked grouphead in citric acid solution, about 2 standard tablespoons in a litre of hot water.

I understand the grouphead is made from brass and chrome plated. The chrome plating seems to have been, to some extent, removed by the weak acid. It's now brass-coloured on the portafilter side.

Sorry for stating the obvious in the following context:

Brass is mainly made from Copper and Zinc, but from what I have read almost always contains some amount of Lead. Brass can leach Lead into water, especially in acidic (food/coffee containing) environments.

If the grouphead part was intended to be bare Brass, the manufacturer would probably be obliged to use Brass alloy with a low Lead content that is food safe. However, Gaggia intended this Brass to be protected by a Chrome coating, so the Brass wouldn't come into contact with the coffee/water.

Question:

Has Gaggia used a safe material thinking owners like me might later remove this coating with de-scaler (or it might wear off)? Or did they use regular, non-safe Brass thinking, it's covered by Chrome plating? Anyone seen this happen before when de-scaling the grouphead? Is it safe to keep using it?",1,1761859873.0,gaggiaclassic,2,1.0,False

1okcbft,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1okcbft/was_she_avoidant_feedback/,Was she avoidant ? + feedback,"Hey everyone. I (M26) think I was in a situationship with a FA (F23). I didn’t know about attachment theory until after we broke up.

We met at work, I manage a staffing agency, she was a bartender. Her friend got my number and we hit it off. She was shy, reserved, and often said “I don’t know” when asked about herself. We had an amazing first date that ended in sex and deep cuddling, she held onto me like a life jacket.

Afterward, she said she usually doesn’t sleep with someone that fast and hoped I wouldn’t see her differently. She didn’t want it to be casual, and I told her I was fine taking it slow. Early on, I was honest that I wasn’t looking for a relationship, but we kept dating.

Over time, she opened up about her trauma, her father abandoned her, she blamed herself for her parents’ divorce, feared everyone would leave her, and said things like “everyone leaves me” or “all men leave me.” She told me she’d dated emotionally unavailable men who only used her for sex, and that she was a people pleaser who let others walk over her.

Despite this, she treated me incredibly well, cooking, making coffee, asking for me to pick her outfits and perfumes I want her to wear, even sewing my shirt. I always treated her kindly and my feelings grew. She started asking “what are we” multiple times, but I said I wasn’t ready for anything serious. Still, we became emotionally close.

But communication was always one-sided, she rarely asked about me and avoided deeper conversations. Around Valentine’s Day she was so anxious about whether I’d make her my valentine, even asking me straight out, but on the day she became distant and cold. When I tried talking to her about her, she shut down completely. When I pulled away, she panicked but admitted. I ended up telling her how I feel and she was shocked and said “she had no ideas” followed by “I’m not ready for a relationship” and “I don’t know how to be in one.” I never asked her to be exclusive, all I told her was my feelings for her can grow if we don’t communicate, she showed she couldn’t do that.That’s when I ended it.

Our goodbye was emotional, she kissed me harder than ever, and I cried the whole way home. I wanted a healthy, communicative relationship and she couldn’t meet me there.

Months later, she watched all my stories, liked romantic posts, and I reached out to see if we could try again. She kindly declined. It’s been 9 months since, and I still think about her.

Do you think she was a fearful avoidant, or did she just lose attraction?

Note: I had to condense this a lot to make it readable, feel free to ask me any questions and I’ll give more context.

1okcabg,https://v.redd.it/k46y7x1ahbyf1,Maks apology to Jan (transcribed),"(I sped the video up)

First and foremost, I want to apologize to Jan for the way my words made you feel. For hurting your feelings. There's a lot more than I wanna say. I would like an opportunity to do it over coffee or any kind of, you know, time you have to spare. I would love to meet, talk about this, bear the hatchet. But also, most importantly, I think you're gonna walk away with knowing me, feeling completely different. And dare I say we probably might even be friends. And to that point, I'm not not a friend, you know, regardless of what I say. And that's a maybe, it's paradoxical, but, you know, my personality, I love you and I will tell you how it is, you know, let alone if I don't know you. My commentary on dance does not come with feelings and emotions. It just comes with completely different reasoning. I'm that guy. And so I would like to explain myself. I would like this to be personal,cause this is crazy to me.

And the second thing is a little more ego. Ego driven, right? You guys wanted me to be me. Well, you can't really hurt my feelings by saying look at you, loser. You only won once, blah, blah, blah. Yes, I know that more than anybody else.I'm also very well aware that every single member of my family has won Dancing Stars more than I have. They are much better at Dancing With the stars than me.

The part of Dancing With the stars that I was never able to really wrestle with and dominate is the public perception, the public opinion and what people think about me. Fundamentally, I don't care. And I lead with that. And because I lead with that, I'm not fighting for anybody's votes. And so in a platform where that's important, I'm not the guy. On top of it, I made incredible mistakes, incredible mistakes with my partners.

Some of them with how I presented myself. The loss of temper was horrible situations few times. It's not like you saying stuff that I don't already know. I'm 45, I have kids. I try to only lead by example. And because of that, I can point at myself and saying that, don't do that. So there's been examples of that, too.

I'm very honest and I'm very black and white. It may be late in the day, in a game. And I realised something about myself, it's not gonna be because somebody says that to me, its because I finally understood that for myself. So that's how I take everything on and process things.

Please don't come at me for how many times I've won or lost and what that opinion means or doesn't mean. Dancing with the stars comes with that. The participation on dancing with the stars comes with that. With everybody with a keyboard nowadays, you can be heard and can voice their opinion. And that's how I look at it. Let's not defend someone by attacking somebody else. That's all I'm gonna say.

Two weeks ago I shared my interactive plant milk quiz site built with Claude AI. Here's the 14-day update.

**Quick Recap:**

* Niche: Plant-based milk alternatives (oat, almond, soy, etc.)
* Site: Interactive quiz → matches users with plant milk → Amazon affiliate links
* Built with zero coding experience using Claude AI
* Started Oct 9, now Day 20



**What's Changed (Day 6 → Day 20):**

**Content Strategy Shift:**

* Pivoted HARD to SEO content
* Published 8 blog posts in 14 days (2x/week cadence)
* Topics: ""Best Plant Milk for Coffee,"" ""Protein,"" ""Weight Loss,"" ""Kids,"" ""Smoothies,"" ""Keto,"" ""Oat vs Almond,"" ""Is Soy Milk Healthy""
* All 2,000-2,500 words with proper Schema markup, internal linking, affiliate links
* Added ""Latest from Blog"" section to homepage

**Traffic Evolution:**

* Week 1 (Reddit spike): 240 users
* Week 2-3 (post-Reddit crash): \~5-10 users/day (mostly direct)
* Reddit experiment today: Posted golden milk recipe to r/veganrecipes (294 views, low engagement - learned I need photos for recipe posts)

**Monetization:**

* **$6.36 total earnings** (up from $1.69 two weeks ago! 🎉)
* **8 items shipped** (up from 1)
* **102 Amazon clicks** (up from 30 in first week)
* **7.84% conversion rate** (clicks → orders shipped)
* Funny reality: People bought a winter jacket, 5x ultrasonic mouse repellents, a car phone mount... but ZERO actual plant milk 😂
* Amazon's 24-hour cookie captures anything they buy, not just what you link to

**Tech Updates:**

* Added blog index page with green ""NEW"" badge system for latest post
* Internal linking between all 8 posts
* Updated sitemap after each post
* Cookie consent + Google Analytics properly configured
* All posts have affiliate disclosure boxes
* Added homepage blog preview section (shows latest 3 posts)

**Reddit Experiments:**

* Tried helpful comment in r/vegan niche question thread (genuine engagement)
* Posted golden milk recipe to r/veganrecipes today (learned: NEED PHOTOS for recipe posts)
* Being careful not to spam or over-promote
* Focusing on being helpful first, promotional never



**Current Stats (Day 20):**

**Content:**

* 8 blog posts live (2,000+ words each)
* Strong internal linking structure
* All with Schema markup + affiliate disclosures

**Traffic:**

* \~400 total users (lifetime)
* \~5-10 users/day (organic baseline post-Reddit)
* Still waiting on first Google impression (sitemap submitted 7 days ago)

**Monetization:**

* $6.36 earned
* 102 Amazon clicks
* 8 items shipped
* 7.84% conversion rate (solid for affiliate!)

**Investment:**

* Time: \~27 hours total (12 hours week 1, \~15 hours weeks 2-3)
* Money: Claude Pro $250/year + domain $12/year = $262 total
* ROI so far: -$255.64 😅



**What I've Learned:**

**Content Production with AI:**

* Claude AI is INSANE for content creation when you give it structure
* My workflow: I write outlines, Claude writes full posts, I edit/approve
* Can produce a 2,500-word blog post in \~90 minutes
* Quality is solid (readable, well-structured, properly cited with Amazon affiliate links)
* Internal linking happens naturally when you prompt for it

**SEO Reality Check:**

* Google takes FOREVER (submitted sitemap 7 days ago, zero impressions yet)
* Reddit traffic is a drug - spike feels great, crash hurts
* Building content library while waiting for indexing
* Playing the long game now (this is month 1 of a 12+ month play)

**What Actually Matters:**

* Quality internal linking (connects all 8 posts)
* Consistent publishing schedule (2x/week is sustainable for me with full-time job + family)
* Actually helpful content (not keyword-stuffed garbage)
* Patience (everyone says 6-12 months to see real results)

**The Weird Amazon Thing:**

* People click plant milk links but buy random stuff
* That 24-hour cookie is powerful - captures ANY purchase
* 7.84% conversion is actually solid for affiliates
* But you need TRAFFIC to make it work



**Mistakes I Made:**

1. **Relied too much on Reddit early** \- not sustainable, just a vanity spike
2. **Posted recipe without photo** \- Reddit loves visuals, learned that today
3. **Expected faster Google indexing** \- reality = 2-4 weeks minimum
4. **Didn't build email list** \- should've started Day 1 (still haven't)
5. **No returning visitor strategy** \- everyone takes quiz once and bounces forever
6. **Obsessed over analytics too much** \- should focus on content instead



**Next 14 Days (Day 20-34):**

**Content:**

* Publish 2-3 more posts (""Best Plant Milk for Baking,"" ""Is Oat Milk Healthy,"" ""Cashew vs Almond"")
* Target: 10-12 total posts by Day 34
* Keep internal linking strong between all posts

**SEO:**

* Wait for Google indexing (should happen soon... right?)
* Monitor Search Console obsessively for first impression
* Optimize based on what ranks (if anything)

**Traffic:**

* Stop chasing Reddit spikes (not sustainable)
* Focus on building organic foundation
* Maybe experiment with Pinterest (visual platform, recipe-friendly)
* Consider other subreddits for genuine engagement

**Monetization:**

* Add more affiliate opportunities in existing posts (protein powders, kitchen tools, etc.)
* Consider email capture for newsletter (finally)
* Track which posts drive clicks (protein? smoothies? coffee?)



**Questions for the Community:**

1. **How long did YOUR first Google impression take?** (I'm at 7 days post-sitemap submission, getting anxious)
2. **Is 8 posts enough to start seeing traction?** Or should I hit 20-30 first?
3. **Anyone else using Claude/AI for content?** What's your workflow? Quality concerns?

I'm in the ""valley of death"" right now:

* Traffic is \~5-10/day 📉
* Grinding out content hoping it pays off in 3-6 months ⏳
* $6.36 earned vs $262 invested = -$255.64 in the hole 💸

But honestly? I'm learning a ton, the content quality is solid, and I'm building something that *should* work once Google starts sending traffic. The hard part is the waiting and not knowing if you're wasting your time.

The AI workflow is genuinely game-changing though - there's no way I could produce 8 quality blog posts in 2 weeks without Claude. That alone might be the most valuable thing I've learned.

1okc22t,https://www.reddit.com/r/piscesastrology/comments/1okc22t/chin_up_pisces_siblings/,"Chin up, Pisces siblings","Dear sweet struggling Pisces,

There's been an uptick in posts seeking advice, help, support, actionable items to support the Piscean overwhelm and depression. This is for all of us including myself.

I've rehashed some comments I've given others recently under other posts to place them here. I invite all Pisces to contribute, correct, amend and improve upon this starting point.

TLDR: I love you, you're gonna be okay.

My intention is to canvass all of these incoming Pisces SOS pists, not to gloss over anyone's feelings of distress or  bypass with some sort of nauseating wholesomeness or anything like that.

I'm at my best when I'm receptive of healthy guidance, in command of my reactions, centered and responsive in a helpful way, calling in beneficial abundance, in communication with my benevolent entities, balanced in my relationships, feeling buoyant in my heart, secure in my connections, and perceiving my life from a lens of grounded and imaginative play.

I actively conduct myself in a way that fosters my best state. 

I reject feelings of disappointing people, closed-ness, non-receptivity, and trapped-ness. I permit myself righteous anger and even rage, as long as I have a healthy and helpful outlet.

Your words have the power. Any diacomfort is your life is rearranging, it may feel downhill to you but the good, pleasurable abundance WAITS until you say, ""Alright I will love the gifts when I receive them!""

Why would the universe give you blessings if you're just gonna cry over them and bleed all over what you asked for? Would you even know what you wanted had been plopped at your feet if you're so committed to the anguish you feel?

Our lives and energies are constantly reconstituting and restructuring. The universe and our benevolent entities are conspiring on our behalf with what they have already placed before us within arm's reach.

We are alive. We LIVE. Despite all anguish, we are still breathing. That's miraculous! 

We still have a phone in our hands, our hearts are still beating, our lungs still breathing, our aura is still influencing our energetic vicinity and all who enter it.

We still have the wherewithal to reach out to our Piscean community, we still possess the cognizance to type, form sentences, observe, react, reach out with a question that I *know* hopes for reassurance in the answers. We have hope even when we don't feel it.

I don't need to study astrology tell myself that life will get better. It will. The time frames vary, sure. We have to both accept and pursue the transmutation. We have to. It's stagnate or die. I'm not dead so I've not stagnated, and healthy change is absolutely incoming. I stand by that.

Sending a flotilla of hugs and the energy of resolute, unwavering havingness. 

This is what I do for myself regularly and I highly recommend that you...

1. Touch a tree. It's so cliche but it will ground you and release the frenetic energy into the earth. Even if you don't think it did, it did. Any tree. Planted or wild.

2. Hug yourself. Rub your palms up and down your forearms. Get your energy flowing. You can also wrap yourself tightly in a blanket or towel. I sleep in a Hug Sleep Pod for the held sensation. It helps circulate and contain your energy within you.

3. Read something you bookmarked or saved to enjoy later. I know you have a mile long list of things that you haven't revisited. Scroll through and see what sticks out. It's a message from your past self to your current self.

4. Contact someone and make connection. Text, phone call, even drop in here in our sub like you did to post this. Time yourself once the interaction is done and see how long it takes for the dopamine fix to dissipate. I suffer when my dopamine crashes and I'm working on self regulating. Knowing your minutes is one way to start gauging yourself.

5. Maintain your rituals. You do have them. Switch them out as needed but have them as a marker to connect your soul breath and body into one place. I have rituals I do in the morning upon waking and evening before going to sleep. Think of it like brushing your teeth or showering. Maintain your energetic hygiene: call upon benevolent entities, name what you're grateful for, sit in a sense of ""havingness"" like you already have all you need because you actually do.

6. Have some tea. Make a mug cake. Treat yourself to 5 minutes staring up at the sky. Breathe and feel the air move through your sinuses, throat, into your lungs. Feel the way your shower water forms sheets of cleansing movement over your skin. Name what you hear right now: someone's keyboard, wheels on pavement, Canada geese honking overhead, a drippy faucet, creak of wood floors expanding or contracting, the furnace, your dog yawning. Smell the fall (or spring, depending on your hemisphere, or tropical if you're equatorial) air, sun warmed bark, rain moistened vegetation, your coffee, clean laundry, someone's fireplace smoke, someone's cigarette smoke, exhaust from the diesel truck in front of you. Use your senses and Notice things, be present, suck yourself out of your mind and sink into your body.

Those are some starters. 

Living a human existence is tough. Come here any time and hang out, there's always someone here to interact with you.

🐟🐟🩵⛲️🫧

Believe me I'm feeling extra sensitive lately, too. I've been even more aggressive with releasing stale energy, breathwork, meditations, rituals, loving myself because I'm fighting for myself. 

Battle mode, friends. We have living to do.

For context: my girlfriend and I have been together for almost 4 years, both 20. I’m a security guard, she’s a part time office worker and part time nurse.

So we recently went to visit my girlfriend’s grandparents with her and her parents. I was already feeling a little exhausted and had a headache, but I was happy to go anyways. I drove us there in my father-in-law’s car. The ride was about 50 minutes.

When we arrived, me and girlfriend were immediately asked to help with some small chores. It was small things like folding laundry and moving some things. It was understandable, they are old and aren’t in their best ability to handle these things anymore, so I was happy to help.

After we did that, we went inside and drank some coffee. The grandfather then asked me if I wanted to climb on the roof (its only about 10ft high) to get some walnuts and dirt off. I honestly didn’t feel like it, and replied “To be honest, I really don’t feel like doing that.” Later, I did it anyways, as I felt that it wasn’t such an issue. My girlfriend helped and the grandfather also tagged along. It was only a 30/45 minute job in the end.

Then it came to what we were going to eat for dinner, we were going to order take out. I wanted to have food from restaurant A, while the rest was a little mixed about going to restaurant A or B. They kept asking me, I kept saying that I wanted to get food from restaurant A but didn’t care either way, and then they decided we should indeed get food from restaurant A.

The rest of the time we just talked, watched some TV, everything was alright.

We were done eating and wanted to go home, the grandparents asked us if we could bring some items over to my girlfriend’s aunt, who lived in a town nearby. We did so, I drove us to the aunt, and my father-in-law asked if we wanted to get out and go in to say “hi”, but I really did not feel like socializing because it was late and we were just dropping something off*. and just said “I’ll just wait in the car”.

Last thing: when we were driving home (I was the one driving), we were conversing and making some fun. Halfway through, when it was getting dark, I turned on the indoor lights of the car to tease my girlfriend (as she doesn’t like it when I do stuff like pressing random buttons, I often do this just to tease her), but it was clear that no-one liked me doing that and they told me to not do that again, I apologized.

I drove home and swapped places with my father-in-law when we arrived at my home after the 50 min drive and continued to their drive to their home, I went inside. After about 1/2 hours, I still hadn’t gotten a text from my girlfriend that they had arrived home or anything, so I sent a text asking if the ride back was alright. I then got a text message saying that she and her parents felt that the entire visit was uncomfortable, and that I had caused this (<—this isn’t literally what the text message said, but it summarizes it). They felt that I was being rude by being so direct, since they find that it’s normal to people-please.

I explained to my girlfriend -via text- that I did not agree with their opinion, but later told her to apologize on my behalf to her parents. She did this, and after that the situation was fine. I explained to my girlfriend that I have had issues with people-pleasing, since I used to be a people-pleasing person and it was often abused (had “friends” who literally tried to force me into crime - that’s where I drew a line and got more assertive) and then told her I’d try my best to be more pleasing when I’m with her family.

However, I’m left wondering; am I actually wrong in this situation? Should I actually have done something different?

Would appreciate the help. This post is definitely not made to try and create conflict, I love my girlfriend and definitely think her parents are amazing people, but I really want to understand if my behavior was rude and if I should adapt to that, or if my behavior was reasonable.

Thanks in advance (throwaway account by the way)

1okbxge,https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/1okbxge/i_built_an_ai_wedding_planning_platform_to_save/,I built an AI wedding planning platform to save our sanity (it actually helped!),"TL;DR: Planning my own wedding was a chaotic, stress-filled experience. Juggling endless checklists, vendor emails, and budget spreadsheets became overwhelming. As a software geek and a groom-to-be, I decided to create an AI-powered planning buddy (we named her Paige) to automate the boring stuff and keep us on track. I wanted to share what led us here and how it's going.

Why I (desperately) built Paige

My fiancé and I got engaged last year and naively thought we could handle the wedding planning with a simple spreadsheet and some checklists from Google. Fast forward a few weeks: our dining table was covered in notebooks, vendor brochures, and sticky notes. We were both working full-time, and planning started to feel like a second job.

The breaking point for me was one night at 1 AM. We were trying to finalize our guest list and seating arrangements, and it felt impossible to keep track of everyone's preferences and who can't sit with whom (drama!). My partner was in tears over a miscommunication with a caterer earlier that day, and I was this close to eloping just to avoid another late-night ""Did you email the photographer or was I supposed to?"" conversation.

I'm someone who automates stuff for a living, and it hit me: why were we drowning in manual wedding tasks that a computer (maybe even an AI) could help manage? We had seen some wedding planning apps, but they still left us doing all the heavy lifting. We needed something that could bring calm, not more chaos, into our planning process. So, fueled by late-night coffee and frustration, I started hacking together a solution. Over the next couple of months, that scrappy idea grew into Paige – our AI-powered wedding planning assistant.

What Paige does (so far)

Paige isn't a human wedding planner, but she became a pretty handy assistant for us. Here are some of the key things she handles to make wedding planning less insane:

Smart To-Do List Automation: We fed Paige the basics of our wedding (dates, size, style), and she instantly generated a personalized checklist of tasks and deadlines. From “book a venue” down to “confirm headcount with caterer 2 weeks out,” it was all in there. She even sends gentle reminders (emphasis on gentle, because nobody needs a bossy app when you're already stressed) and updates the list as we complete or change things. No more worrying that we forgot some critical detail – Paige keeps track.

Vendor Outreach & Follow-ups: Drafting emails to vendors and keeping track of responses was driving us nuts. Paige now helps automate that process. We can ask her to contact florists or photographers in our area; she’ll generate a polite, personalized outreach email for each, tailored to our wedding details. We still hit send (because we want to control the final message), but it saves hours of writing and copy-pasting. She also keeps a log of who’s responded, who needs a nudge, and even suggests questions to ask (like a friendly reminder to confirm if the DJ brings their own sound equipment – which I definitely would've forgotten to ask).

Realistic Budget Planning: Ah yes, the budget – where we learned that everything in a wedding costs 30% more than you expect. We gave Paige an idea of our total budget and priorities, and she broke it down into a pretty detailed plan based on average costs in our area and for our guest count. It felt like having a financial advisor specifically for the wedding. When we started veering off-track (hello, last-minute décor splurges), Paige flagged it gently. This feature was a lifesaver for us – it turned nebulous “maybe this is enough money?” guesswork into a clear plan. We could actually see, for example, how spending extra on an open bar would affect the rest of our budget before we made the decision.

Seating Chart Wizardry: We were dreading the seating chart more than any other task. To our surprise, Paige made this almost… fun? We uploaded our guest list, and Paige helped visualize the seating arrangements. We could tag guests with things like “family”, “college friends”, “don’t seat near Uncle Bob”, etc., and then drag-and-drop people around virtual tables. Paige would alert us if we accidentally seated certain people together we’d flagged as a bad combo (yes, it did catch that we almost placed two feuding relatives at the same table – crisis averted). It wasn’t fully automatic (we still made the final calls), but having an interactive map with a bit of AI guidance took a huge headache off our shoulders.

Mood Boards & Inspiration: My fiancé had a vision for our theme, but explaining exactly what “rustic chic but not too rustic, with a touch of modern” meant to vendors was surprisingly hard. Paige stepped in here by generating mini mood boards. We’d type in our theme or upload a couple of inspiration pics we liked, and Paige would fetch (or even AI-generate) a set of images that matched that vibe. We ended up with a coherent palette and style references that we could share with our decorator and florist. It was like having a Pinterest curator who actually gets what you want. (And it saved me from nodding along to my partner’s tenth explanation of what exactly “rustic chic” means.)

Timeline & Day-Of Planner: Finally, Paige helped with scheduling – both the long-term planning timeline and the day-of itinerary. 

How it feels using Paige
Honestly, at first I worried introducing an AI would make things feel impersonal or even add more stress. The goal was never to replace the human part of wedding planning – we still made all the decisions and had fun with the creative bits – we just wanted to offload the drudgery.

The biggest thing we learned is that planning a wedding doesn’t have to be a constant panic. With the right tools (or in our case, a friendly AI buddy), it’s possible to actually enjoy the process a bit more. Paige isn’t perfect yet (she’s definitely still learning – sometimes she’ll suggest something slightly off, like reminding us about a “cake tasting” when we already decided on pie, lol). But she turned what felt like an unmanageable mess into a series of manageable, even organized tasks. My fiancé literally said, “I feel like I can breathe again,” a week after we started using Paige. That alone made all those late nights of coding worth it.

Not an Ad, just excited (and a tiny bit nervous)
I want to be super clear: I’m not trying to come off like a salesperson here. I’m just genuinely excited that something we built out of personal desperation is actually helping us and might help other couples too. We’ve shown Paige to a couple of friends (one of them called it “wedding planning on easy mode,” which made us blush).
If this sounds like the kind of help you’d want, we’d love to add a few more folks to try it out. If not, no worries at all – I totally get that everyone has their own way of planning.

At the very least, I hope sharing our story helps validate anyone out there who’s feeling overwhelmed with their wedding to-dos. You’re not failing or behind on your planning – wedding planning is just really freaking hard! If you’re currently in the thick of it: take a breath, remember why you’re doing this (hint: it’s not just about the perfect centerpieces), and don’t be afraid to delegate, whether to friends, family, or yes, even a helpful little AI assistant.

I’d love to hear what you all think. Have you tried using any tools or automation to help with wedding planning (or any big event)? What was the most stressful part of planning for you, and how did you tackle it? I’m all ears for stories or even skepticism – after all, I was pretty skeptical about an AI helper myself until a few months ago.
(And if anyone’s curious about the tech side: Paige runs on a mix of GPT-based magic for text/tasks and some good old-fashioned code for scheduling and charts. Happy to nerd out in the comments if you want more details.)

Thanks for reading this long post. I know it's not the typical “look at this cool automation” or “here’s a planning tip” topic, but it felt right to share. Building Paige has been a humble reminder that sometimes the best innovations come from very personal problems. If even one person here finds this idea helpful (or feels a little less stressed about their own wedding), then hitting “Post” was worth it. Cheers!",2,1761858884.0,automation,1,1.0,False

We were supposed to move in together but we broke up for a month because I think he got cold feet, I ended up moving into a new apartment by myself and refurbished and moved and did the entire home alone. The bills and the rent is all in my name and on my expense. My boyfriend after a month or two moved in with me but still has not offered to take part in any of the bills (not that I need him to) but without him offering to do it, it still just feels like my home and not his or like he has one foot out the door already if he decides. I work more hours than he does, I leave house in morning probably around 9 AM and I get home at 8 PM and two times a week I also have a class for something I am learning. I keep up with all the house cleaning and if I have time, will also cook. You know be an adult and manage my life and household. The issue started when I felt like I was taking care of him or that I felt he was not respecting the space. At first I thought maybe I am just too used to living alone so I need to adjust to having another human here but now I feel like I am his mommy. I have to show him and teach him how to do everything like even how to wipe down a table if there is a smear on it. I feel like he is using weaponized incompetence. He also has his own business so he works less hours than I do because he can choose his own hours, he probably works like maximum 7 hours or less depends. Maybe even 5 hours a day. He goes to bed sometimes at 5 or 6 in the morning and wakes up around noon before chilling with his coffee because he cannot “function” or blink without it and then goes off to work, comes home, plays video games, repeat. I tried to talk to him about mental load and shared responsibility of a hold hold but he told me there is things he is not willing to do at all and my point about me working more and him having more free time made him feel like I was saying he is a woman and needs to take care of all the cleaning (which I didn’t say). I was simply trying to point out that I’m not a super hero woman and I need help and he doesn’t step up or try or take care of anything. I do have a cleaner that I pay to come twice a week so he thinks because of this his contribution is not necessary for anything but I don’t think he realizes that he upkeep of a household requires more sometimes. Like I don’t want a pile of laundry or dishes sitting around waiting for the day the cleaner will come around.. or dirt marks or scum on the counters. He told me he shouldn’t have to clean it if those things don’t bother him and I should do it if it bothers me. I told him I don’t think he cares or realizes this things because the items and things left messy belong to me and not him so he doesn’t have or feel any value in taking care of things or keeping them nicely.. he told me that it’s a woman’s thing to take care and notice the small things and I just ended up getting mad and telling him he is misogynistic and to not speak to me.

1okbv8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthChallenges/comments/1okbv8h/building_loving_relationships_that_last/,Building Loving Relationships That Last,"Attraction and romance are merely part of the story when choosing someone you want to spend the rest of your life with. These challenges are designed to help you build a relationship with someone that creates incredible depth and meaning in both your lives. Simple, yet effective tasks for a happy life.

\-----

**The Quiet Foundation**

This exercise deepens understanding and connection in your relationship by focusing on small, ordinary moments—the true fabric of lasting love. It’s not about grand gestures, but the gentle rhythm of everyday care and the way you meet each other when life feels imperfect.

1) Start with a Morning Observation

• During your next shared morning, slow down for five minutes and notice the tone of your routine together—the silence, gestures, or small kindnesses.

• Ask yourself: “Does this feel like comfort or confinement?” Then share that reflection gently later in the day.

2) Express Specific Appreciation

• Before bed, name one small act your partner did that made your day easier or warmer.

• Keep it precise: “When you made my coffee even though you were rushing, it reminded me how much you care.” No “buts,” no corrections—just appreciation.

3) Repair in the Quiet Moments

• If something felt tense or disconnected today, don’t wait for the perfect moment. Use a calm time—like a walk or washing up together—to say, “I felt distant earlier, and I’d like to reconnect.”

• Keep it short, own your part, and invite repair rather than resolution.

4) Create a Micro-Agreement

• Choose one small recurring friction (chores, schedules, messages left unanswered) and design a tiny, testable fix: “I’ll take out the trash before bed; you’ll handle the morning dishes.”

• Confirm it verbally or by text. Review at the end of the week—did it help ease tension?

5) End the Day in Rhythm

• Sit together in silence for two minutes before sleep—no phones, no talking. Just share the stillness.

• Notice the safety or unease that arises and treat it as information, not judgment. Over time, this quiet presence becomes the strongest kind of connection.

\-----

**Repair Before Repreat**

Conflict doesn’t destroy relationships—avoidance does. This practice trains you to approach tension early, with care and steadiness, before resentment grows.

1) Name the Pause

• When you sense tension building, calmly say, “I need a short pause so I can speak clearly.”

• Step away for 10–15 minutes to regulate yourself. Avoid storming out or disappearing.

2) Return with Intent

• Begin with a grounding line: “I want us to talk about this without hurting each other.”

• Keep focus on one topic—avoid bringing past issues into the current moment.

3) Acknowledge and Own

• Use simple language: “When I said X, I realise it came out sharp. I’m sorry for that.”

• Resist defending. Responsibility is the repair, not the explanation.

4) Invite Their View

• Ask: “How did that feel for you?” Then listen without interruption. Reflect back what you heard to show understanding.

5) Propose a Gentle Next Step

• Suggest one practical action to prevent repeat (“Next time, let’s text if we’re running late rather than assume”).

• End with gratitude for their willingness to talk.

\-----

**Love In The Ordinary**

This challenge shifts attention from idealised romance to the real work of building comfort and rhythm together. It’s about appreciating the quiet, repetitive actions that make a partnership feel safe.

1) Breakfast Check-In

• Over breakfast, ask each other a small but genuine question: “What’s one thing that would make today a bit lighter for you?”

• Listen fully before responding; small insights here often reveal bigger needs.

2) Shared Mundanity

• Choose a routine task (grocery run, laundry, cooking) to do together this week.

• Treat it as connection, not obligation—chat, share music, or enjoy silence side by side.

3) The Patience Practice

• Notice moments when your partner is tired, distracted, or off-form. Replace irritation with small gestures of grace—making tea, finishing their task, offering quiet understanding.

4) Nightly Return

• Before sleep, say: “Thank you for today,” even on days that weren’t easy.

• This phrase becomes a bridge between days, reinforcing that you choose each other daily.

\-----

**The Art of Steady Love**

This practice cultivates steadiness - the quiet strength that carries love through imperfect seasons. It’s about rhythm, not fireworks; repair, not retreat.

1) Morning Kindness Cue

• Start each day with one invisible act of care—making their drink, clearing a small task, or leaving a note.

• Do it without expectation of return; it sets a tone of generosity.

2) Emotional Temperature Check

• Midday, text one honest line: “How’s your energy today?”

• It signals awareness without pressure and keeps emotional attunement alive.

3) End-of-Day Debrief

• Take five minutes to share one good moment and one hard moment from your day.

• Listen fully before responding; empathy matters more than advice.

4) Weekly Reset

• Each weekend, sit together to reflect: “What worked for us this week? What needs adjustment?”

• Choose one small action to improve your shared rhythm.

\-----

**Choosing Again**

Love isn’t a single decision, it’s a daily renewal. This exercise helps you practice deliberate choice and forgiveness, recognising that both partners are growing, imperfect people choosing to stay.

1) Morning Reflection

• Before starting your day, take one minute to think: “What does choosing them look like today?”

• Write a short intention: “Today I’ll speak kindly even when tired,” or “I’ll listen before reacting.”

2) Observe Their Effort

• Notice one thing your partner is trying at, even if it’s imperfect. Acknowledge it aloud: “I saw how you tried to stay calm earlier. I appreciate that.”

3) Practice Soft Repair

• When friction arises, lead with gentleness: “I know we both got tense earlier—I still want us to be okay.”

• Forgiveness is not approval; it’s choosing connection over distance.

4) Evening Recommitment

• Close the day by writing a one-line reflection: “What made me proud to choose them again today?”

• Read one reflection aloud each week to each other. It reaffirms your shared commitment without ceremony.

I asked her out to a movie, but it wasn't coming out for about 2 weeks. I wanted to see her sooner so I asked her to coffee and she said ""yes, sounds like fun"". We talked and laughed the whole time and I think it went well. Just had the movie date yesterday and she didn't want me to pay for snacks because I got the tickets but I insisted that I pay. I compromised with her and said that if I can buy the food/drinks then she can buy the candy and she happily agreed. She whipped her card out first so I told her that I would Venmo her the money for the food/drinks and when I asked for her Venmo today she said ""I'm not telling you, I don't want any money for it!"". I jokingly responded ""That wasn't the agreement 😤"" to which she said ""Too bad!"". I then said ""Fine! I'll pay you back somehow another time then 🤣"" and the final message she responded with was just ""🙄"". I don't know if she was just being flirty or if I overstepped a boundary. I only had good intentions and believe that I should pay considering I asked HER. I appreciate that she wanted to pay, and she didn't seem upset with the agreement we made at the time. This is still a new thing and I fear I messed it up already 🙃. Do you think I should apologize for being stubborn or just keep silent?",1,1761858726.0,relationship_advice,5,1.0,False
1okbutp,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1okbutp/beyond_church_history_and_doctrinal_issues_what/,"Beyond church history and doctrinal issues, what makes you angry as an exmormon?","I’ve been thinking about this a lot lately and am curious what people might say. I’ve noticed the more distanced I become from the church in my beliefs, the angrier I become about certain things that aren’t what made me initially leave. Here are some examples of what I mean:

- Feeling like all my Mormon family and friends think of me as either a failure or a task, but not a human.
- Either explicitly or implicitly being told I just didn’t understand the gospel fully (ESPECIALLY when an active member says things like “You probably don’t know this scripture…” or “It seems like you don’t understand the church’s stance on…”
- Hearing members claim they are just like every other Christian church (I would’ve thought this too until I learned after leaving just how many discrepancies there are between orthodox Christianity and Mormonism).
- Along the same lines, hearing members twist their beliefs to sound normal (The one I hate the most is the temple. “It’s just a sacred space where we worship.” no it’s not just a sacred space!!! No it’s really fucking not!!! It’s weird af, has a LONG creepy history, and it isn’t at all like, say, a cathedral the way you’re implying. I just get so mad.)
- Being told something was either never taught or never solidified as doctrine (I have literally been gaslit about coffee. People telling me “It’s not specifically that drink, so we’re not actually judgmental on the specific drink.” Makes me want to pull my hair out.
- Going to a family function and feeling like I can’t talk about myself or my life without walking on eggshells because so many regular things like getting a drink with friends are so demonized.

I could go on and on. I’ve been out for about 5 years now and it seems like I just get more annoyed about these things and less annoyed about the bullshit like church history, LGBTQ policies/Family Proclamation/etc., teachings that don’t add up, and all of those things. I’m not saying those don’t make me mad still, but it’s lessening.

1okbub8,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingcritiques/comments/1okbub8/opening_chapter_of_horror_novel_768_words/,Opening chapter of horror novel (768 words),"Hi, I would be interested in hearing feedback on the first chapter of my horror novel ""Contance"". The novel is finished and I am considering possible edits before querying. The novel is about an infertile couple who use a faith healer to conceive, but things obviously don't go to plan with supernatural forces unleashed by the ritual.

CHAPTER 1

The old woman moved around the younger woman like a withered wraith in the mist of smoke. She seemed lost in the strange words she recited, like a child hoping to memorize something before an exam.

On the floor Hazel breathed in the heady scent of incense. Her flesh had become numb to the cold tiles which had bristled against her naked back and buttocks when she first lay down an hour ago. She was within a circle of cracked egg shells the faith healer had scattered about, one of several eccentricities the ritual apparently demanded.

Her eyes were closed against the stinging smoke and Constance’s pale stake of naked flesh. The smoke and words tendrilled into her consciousness. Hazel felt herself billow along on the rumble of Constance's words, a ceaseless deep gurgling torrent punctuated by shrill peaks that emerged from the flow seamlessly without interrupting it. It almost seemed as if two voices were harmonizing from different ends of the spectrum.

She concentrated on the flow, latched onto a motif and followed it as it repeated, becoming both itself and its memory in a hypnotic cycle, slowly morphing over time to a new pattern borne on the guttural stream.  

Suddenly the chanting stopped. The silence that followed was stark as a precipice.  

Hazel flinched as an ice-cold hand pressed against her stomach. Her eyes shot open. Constance was hunkered down over her, legs either side, pressing the palm of her hand deep into the flesh above the groin. The old woman’s eyes were open, revealing only the whites. The unseeing cragged face was curtained by long strands of grey frizz, her small breasts sagged into flat triangles.

Hazel shuttered the sight with her eyelids. Constance’s chanting grew faster, louder, till it turned into grunting. It was like she was evacuating something from within herself.

Hazel drew in rapid breaths; the smoke trickled against the back of her throat. Her heart beat faster, harmonizing to the rhythm of Constance’s cacophony.

The grunting stopped and Hazel heard the phlegmy clearing of mucous, the gargling of spittle. The sound of spitting, and a wet sensation around her vagina. Dapples of damp down her thighs.

*What is this?* Hazel thought in a wave of shock.

Constance pressed her hand deeper into Hazel’s stomach, massaging it, kneading it. Hazel felt a pin prick of pain inside her, followed by an electric tingle emanating from that spot that travelled through her body. Her body was suffused with a warm hazy glow.

Constance started up chanting again. Loud and almost like a growl. The old woman’s black labrador Pooka howled from outside as if in chorus with her.

Constance withdrew her hand. Hazel heard her tread around her a few more times, the growl relenting and softening until it fell back into a chant. It became softer and lower still till it receded to a faint whisper, drowned by the dog’s barking, till the dog too stopped as if part of the performance.

Hazel heard the flick of the light switch, the door opening. 

Then Constance’s voice: “You can get dressed.”

Hazel got up after she heard the door closed. She examined the room around her. The cracked egg shells around the chalk circle. The candle flames still flickering, dried wax guttered down their sides. The silver incense burner smouldering the last bits. She felt chilled all of a sudden, like the cold she should have felt over the last however long it was had been stored up to be released all at once. 

She shivered, dressed quickly and went outside. Constance was back in her tatty old jeans and jumper, sipping tea on the couch. There was a steaming cup prepared for Hazel on the coffee table too. Hazel sat down, cupped it between her hands, felt the warm ceramic on her hands and sipped the warmth inside. She slowly felt herself coming back to her normal senses.

“It’s done now. We will wait and see,” said Constance.

They drank in silence.

After a while, Constance got up, moved to the window, drew back the curtain and peered outside. Dusk had fallen and Joachim sat in the driver's seat, face framed with spectral light as he read something on his phone.

“Shall we bring Joachim in?” Constance asked.

Hazel suddenly felt self-conscious. After what she'd been through, it would feel weird to bring him in and adopt the trappings of normality again so casually. She shook her head. Constance nodded agreeably. As if she'd passed some test.

“You two will have a lot to talk about very soon.”

1okbu4s,https://www.reddit.com/r/GuyCry/comments/1okbu4s/long_and_winding_road/,Long and Winding Road,"In my feelings right now, and just wanted to tell my story out in the Reddit wilderness. It's long... and my apologies if I'm breaking any of the community rules!

**TLDR; 34 M, very whelmed with life right now this year but in a good way. Between dating women, coaching football, new architecture job, keeping up with family, just haven't had a chance to breathe in life so I'd like to just get things off my chest here. This community is awesome, so figured I'd just share my perspective.**

This year has been a doozy so far. Couple of things, I do see my therapist every week and have for the past two years (he's awesome and I've grown so much!). So this post is more so just getting my thoughts and story out. I very much enjoy my life, but the way I have things set up can be whelming at times. 

**PREQUEL**

I broke up with my ex of five years, three days before my birthday in 2024. It was not a healthy relationship and I'm happy I ended it, it was the best decision for the both of us but a difficult one. There was no fighting, just mutual respect and understanding. All I told her is that I'm waiving the white flag, that I've given everything I've got and she still wasn't happy. I cooked, I cleaned, I shopped, did the laundry, have a full time job in architecture, own my own house, coach HS football... All that and it wasn't enough.

Spent the rest of the day drinking together, grieving together, making plans on how to move forward and getting honest feelings out on the table. Went to bed one last time together (no sex, just cuddled and cried). Woke up in the morning, I went to my parents house for a couple of days so she could move all of her stuff out of my house.

On my birthday we met up as she didn't want me to be alone since my parents were out traveling. It was very bittersweet for the both of us, but that was the last time I saw her. Met her at a British pub and had a couple of drinks, hugged and went our separate ways. We've only texted each other twice since then, and just logistical things about each others stuff.

Regardless, I was a hurting pup at the time. Getting used to not having a human in your space after so long was eerie but exciting. I could actually play piano without her getting annoyed. But I wouldn't have anyone to greet outside of my dog and cat. I could cook what I wanted. Laundry was reduced by 3/4. It took some work with me and my therapist, but I got a new system where I felt good by myself.

**ACT 1 - WILDING OUT**

My best friend, who is also the head coach of the football team I coach for, was absolutely there for me. I was over at his house all of the time, watching football, planning, strategizing, talking about life and just hanging out. Haven't had that kind of friendship since early college, it was nice to just spend time with someone I trust and have a deep connection with. He gave me a safe space to just be.

But I would definitely go off on my own and go wild, especially the first six months. A lot of drinking out, socializing and general buffoonery. Slept with three women during that time. One night stands aren't really my thing, but drunk me and sober me argue about that all the time. Two of them were standard experiences, one turned into a weird horror story.

I was that guy that slept with a grandma. The memories of the night were somewhat blurry, but I do remember flashes of the night. I was leaving one bar to go to another, and enshrouded in darkness she was outside the first bar with a few people. We got to talking and I invited her to the bar that I was going to, and she agreed. Absolutely had beer goggles on, but at the time I remember feeling safe and she had glacier blue eyes. Went back to my place, drank some more, the last thing I remember was making out with her on my patio couch.

Woke up in the morning, I look to my side and she was sitting next to me just staring at me with a big smile on her face wearing a pair of my boxers and a t-shirt. Throbbing headache, I tried to compose myself. It was about 10AM in the morning, and as I made my way downstairs she was telling me that she was going to leave but saw how beautiful my house was and just couldn't leave without saying goodbye.

Once I was downstairs, I get to my kitchen and there is broken glass everywhere on the floor. I asked what happened, and she said that she went into my pantry and saw that I had a lot of red wine, and helped herself to a couple of bottles. But she dropped a wine glass and didn't want to clean it up... This pissed me off as I have animals! They could seriously hurt themselves, AND she's smashed at 10AM.

Took a breath, cleaned up the glass, made coffee for us both and took some ibuprofen. Decided let me sober her up before letting her drive, so I gave her coffee and just tried to act calm. Sat on the couch and she latched herself onto me. I forget all that we spoke about, but I remember about an hour later I hear a knock on my backdoor and my door opening.

One of my fellow coaches was door-dashing near me and walked inside my house. Quickly I threw the blanket over her and she curled up in a fetal position. I intercepted him, telling him I had a half naked girl in the living room, we dapped up and he left. Bullet dodged.

She was nowhere close to being sober, and I was dead tired. We go upstairs so I can take a nap, she comes with. Ends up giving me a BJ, which physically felt great, but emotionally was just like... What am I doing bro.

We both woke up from our nap, she was sober so I drove her to her car at the bar, said goodbye, drove back home and just rested. Always have that feeling of anxiety after a crazy night, it's hard to explain but you don't feel safe even though physically you are.

Next day comes around. It's Sunday, I'm playing video games trying to reset myself before the work week. 8PM, I hear a knock on my back door. My heart skips a beat, thinking it was my coaching friend stopping by.

No.

As I approach the door, my door opens and I hear her voice saying she was so sorry, but she forgot to leave her number and she walks inside my house, putting a folded piece of paper on my table and darted outside. I just replied ""Oh, thank you very much,"" as she was closing the door, just trying to be polite. She then bursts the door open and puts her arms around me, exclaiming that she missed me so much and had so much fun with me.

I could smell alcohol on her breath. Tried to stay calm, just say whatever and guide her out of my house. She sees my animals, and out of excitement quickly goes after them to get some love. Falls flat on her face. I help her up, and we share a few words before I guide her out of my house. Hear her car leave, take her number and flush it down the toilet.

It was this moment I decided to chill the fuck out, and to stay more in control when I'm out.

**ACT 2 - HEALING**

I wilded out, had a successful football season (won our league and district championship games in dramatic fashion), and once winter came finally some calm came. I was out of being in a productive mode and into a retrospective state of mind. Reflecting, analyzing, making decisions about my life of what I wanted to change and all that.

Started going back to the gym and it felt great. Lost 50 pounds in like 6 months, changed my diet and a lot of lifestyle habits with the help of my therapist. The goal was to find sustainable things to improve my lifestyle, not knee jerk reaction fads or bursts.

My job at the time was not good at all. So much drama behind the scenes. I worked at an architecture firm where both of the partners who headed our local branch left, so leadership was scrambling. Work was starting to dwindle because of all the world events, inflation, interest rates, etc. Day after day was a struggle just to get out of bed, and I was great at my job and could complete it in half of the time they budgeted for.

I spent about 4 hours of my day during that 6 month period writing a silly novel, just getting my creativity out in a different form than I'm used to. You'd be surprised how much you can actually write in 4 hours a day. Ended up with an 80,000 word novel, and only did the first part of three that was in my head.

But taking care of my body, expressing myself creatively, reducing the habit of drinking (I made a rule, no more drinking at my house), just really started working on myself and feeling really positive about my life. Started doing activities that I loved doing by myself, going to the movies, riding my motorcycle around, playing piano more... These things have died down currently, but I'll get to that in a bit.

St. Patricks day. Decided to go out and have a beer with my best friend, and the night starts as any other. Football talk, life talk, he decides to leave and I decide to have one more. Go up to the bar and order something, the guy next to me starts a conversation with me. Just general chit-chat, and he mentions that his sister is coming by and to stop and hang out with them.

I stayed, and she came in. Zero sexual attraction. Sober me would have not thought much about it, drunk me was disappointed. Regardless, we have fun and are all talking about random stuff. The bar was closing down, and we're all feeling toasty and decide to go to another bar that stays open late. We all head off to meet there.

Right when I walk in, the first person I see is the grandma. Every expletive that you can think of bubbles inside me, as I scurried to the table where the two people I met were at. Get to the table, face on my hands, I do not want to be here anymore but it's too late. One of the bartenders knows me, she brings me my drink, I'm stuck for at least one drink.

The guy asks what the problem is, and I said ""You see that lady over there? Well let me tell you all that happened..."" So I started explaining the story. Suddenly he stops me, and I have no idea why. He apologized, and said ""Hey man... sorry to interrupt but I need to let you know that that's my mother.""

Dead. I'm dead inside.

I apologized profusely, he said he doesn't mind he just wanted to know if we had a good time. I told him we did, then said I had to take a piss. Go to the bathroom, and I have calculations in my mind of how to get the fuck out of that bar. At least ten or fifteen minutes passed.

He comes into the bathroom and corners me, asking me if I was alright. I opened up and just told him the truth, I felt so uncomfortable and wanted to get out. He calmed me down, convinced me to stay and so I did. We head back to the table and I tried to forget all about it with a shot and another drink.

Some time passes, we get back to laughing together. His sister is at the table with us, and I'm just toasty enough to forget everything. The brother goes away for a bit, and I remember the girl starts hitting on me... This stood out, she said ""You know, I taught my mom everything she knows. I could show you how a BJ is properly done."" and my soul withered.

Made an excuse that I was too far gone and that I don't even think I could get it up. Waved to the bartender that I was ready to tab out, the daughter gave me her number, I walked home. Lesson learned; if you live in a smallish town, weird things will happen.

But this reinforced my earlier conviction... Chill dude.

**ACT 3 - Dating and Life**

After this blip, I continued my self-improvement. Was furiously sending my applications out for a new job, and finally landed an interview after 8 months of applying for jobs. Met with the president at a coffee shop, had a great conversation about what the job entails, where they wanted to go, how they want me to fit in. A couple days later met with the lead architect, we instantly clicked and told me in my interview that his mind was made up and that he wanted me on his team. I felt the same exact way, as it was pretty much my dream job (high end custom single family homes).

So new job, learning the ropes and it's very creatively demanding. On top of this, I just became the offensive line coach in football so the work-load is intense. The group of boys were raw, so there was going to be a lot of work to be done. But I was up to the challenge, and same with my friend. Before spring ball, we felt confident in the overall structure of the offense that it would fit what our boys could do.

Spring ball hits, and we had some devastating injuries that severely impacted our talent. Just around this time, I was out with the coaches at the bar again (recurring theme, huh?) and just a regular night of talking ball, watching sports, etc.

I saw this cute girl sitting at the table across from ours as I walked into the bar, and was like dang... After some of the other coaches left, I noticed a coach from a rival school sitting with his girlfriend was at the table with the cute girl. So I go over and start talking to him and his girl, and instantly I could feel the magnetism between us. Didn't really speak to each other for the first 15-20 minutes, but we kept shoulder bumping each other and eventually talking.

The rival coach then asked ""Hey, are you two dating?"" and I smiled and simply said ""Not yet."" Probably the smoothest thing that's come out of my mouth. Like an idiot, didn't get her number but I knew her name. She worked at the school district and I've actually met with her before, she did payroll and when I got the coaching job years ago we sat down to discuss benefits, insurance, 401k and all that.

Found her on Facebook and sent out a message. She responded, and just like that we started dating. Now she's a 42 F, so an 8 year age gap. In my head, I was like... she's freaking beautiful dude, don't worry about it. We dated for two months and had such a good time together. Did a whole bunch of activities together, and the sex was wild. The only kicker is that I want to start a family, she already has three kids, the youngest is 8 and the oldest is 19 so she was done having kids.

The last two weeks were rough between us, a lot of hard conversations but we both decided it would be best to end things as our end goals were different. Now we were never exclusive and both of us were still on dating apps. In those last two weeks, I matched with a beautiful girl who was 30F. We spoke for about a week before meeting up for a golf-date at a really nice driving range.

So the last week of our relationship, I also went on two or three dates with this other girl. Extreme guilt the whole time. I still beat myself up over this, but at the time I was sad that one relationship was on it's way out and excited for the opportunity to get to know someone else.

And I remember the first time I saw this new girl, just thinking ""WOW. She's beautiful,"". She had a great smile, she was like 5'3"", beautiful long hair, and she didn't have any pictures of her eyes on her profile but they were glacier blue (like the grandma) but the shape of her eyes were incredibly attractive... Our first date we spend over 5 hours together, having great conversations about life and what we wanted. We aligned on so many things.

But she had a three month rule, no sex in the first three months. I wasn't put off, and in fact was excited about that. Being able to genuinely build connection without the pressure of sex was appealing. And we had a lot of fun together, but there was a weird feeling between us... Like, touching her felt awkward? I've never really felt it before, but there was something that was holding me back.

As time went on, my relationship with the cute bar girl ended and I started dating online girl. I got over the awkward feeling and started holding her hand, doing what I normally do (physical touch is a love language of mine) but it was just a strange feeling of not feeling that warmth back? Idk, I'm still processing what that feeling was. It didn't feel wrong, just... forced.

So a month and a half goes by, and we've had some pretty epic make out sessions. She came over to my house one day and as were making out on the couch she said ""I want you inside of me"". Say no more. And it was GREAT. For an hour and a half we're having fun, laughing as her hair got in my mouth, both sweaty...

And it was a great weekend between the two of us. Football was just starting, we were in about week 2 and things were not looking good on the football field so I could really only see her on Saturdays, Sunday mornings or early coffee dates during the weekdays. 

For context, I get to the office at 7:00AM, leave at 2:00 PM, team meeting/film at 3:00PM, practice from 4-6:30PM, then ""coaches meeting"" from 7:00-8:00 where we go to the bar, grab a drink and watch practice of film and make the next days plans, home to relax then rinse and repeat. Saturday is my only day off, Sunday I have to spend about 4-5 hours breaking down film and grading my lineman, coaches meeting that day lasts for about 3 hours, and then I need to get ready for the work week (laundry/grocery shopping/anything else).

She was also really busy, owned her own company, worked long hours and it was a high stress job. After that awesome weekend, things just kind of fizzled out between us. I really noticed in when I went to the ER for extreme stomach pain under my right rib-cage... Gallstones. Needed to get surgery to remove my gallbladder.

The kicker to that was that my insurance hadn't kicked in yet due to the 90 day waiting period when switching jobs. And my dumb-ass didn't sign up for COBRA because I'm young, I can survive 90 days. Of course, literally a month after getting the job I had to go to the ER for this, got slapped a 4k bill and was told by the doctors to avoid fatty foods, try my best to wait for insurance to kick in, and only come back if I started vomiting.

SO. Gallstones. Dating girl. New job. Coaching football. Social life. Taking care of my animals. Taking care of my house. Family wants to spend time with me. Goodness gracious.

I go to get my surgery, and all went well. Only took the day off from work and football to yank that thing out, and was back the next day high on meds. No PTO, and the football culture is such that you don't miss a day unless it's for a funeral or your dying.

Talking to the new girl, I sent a dumb text (but not really dumb). My parents stayed with me for three days for the surgery to drive me around and in general take care of me. There was a baseball game on that my mom wanted to watch, and my dad wanted to go out to get some food. So I invited my best friend to come along and we all watched the game, they drank and I got to eat regular un-healthy food again. I took a picture of all of us and sent it to her saying ""These are all the people I'd love to introduce you to someday.""

Ya know, you'd think after two-three months of dating this would be okay. But instantly I noticed distance in her texts. Cold, polite. I'm sure inside it triggered something and her response was to create distance. After four days I made plans for a coffee date with her. Right when I sat down next to her, the first thing she did was scooch away and created physical distance between us.

That was my second sign that this wasn't going to work. We texted for about a week and half or so, before I just said ""You know, I've been noticing distance increasing between us and I just wanted to let you know that I'm good taking a step back from this. Good luck with everything."" She responded saying that she felt the same way and wished me luck. Just that like, it was over.

The next day, get a message from the original cute bar girl saying that she heard I just had gallbladder surgery and that if I needed anything to not hesitate to reach out. I knew what she meant. But I didn't give in to temptation, just responded politely saying thank you and exchanged a few words between each other.

Now in football at the time, we are 0-5, it's been a rough year. Far removed from the four back-to-back-to-back-to-back league championships we've just wont he past four years. We go down to a school about 4 hours away from us, just about a week after ending it with the other girl. Get our butt absolutely spanked on a cold, rainy night. Soaked to the bone we're on our way home. I'm riding in a truck with other coaches, when we get a call from another coach just before midnight.

Sounds like he is in a freaking war-zone, just absolute chaos in the background. Someone clipped the back of one of our busses and they crashed over the freeway median. We all turn around, and 20 minutes later arrive at the scene and it was straight out of a movie. The kids were all fine thankfully, but two of them had to go to the hospital as well as the bus driver and the coach that was on the bus. I volunteered to go to the hospital as it was my starting LG and a freshman lineman, and our defensive coordinator volunteered to drive me there and stayed with us.

The young kid turned out to be fine, but my other guy fractured his L4... done for the season. After 6 hours in the hospital, all of us on zero sleep. Bus drive had a severe concussion and when we spoke to her, all she was concerned about was the kids. The coach on the bus broke three ribs. The driver that hit the bus apparently was driving 96 MPH and smacked into the bus which was going 60 MPH. Not sure what happened to him, but I'm sure he just fucked his life over.

So on no sleep, we drive two hours home. Get back at about 8:30, and I'm exhausted. Go to sleep, wake up at about 4PM and I needed to get out of the house. Back to the bar, I can at least get some drinks in me and get back to my usual sleep schedule. I get there and about 30 minutes into it, one of my old coaching buddies calls me asking me if I'm at the bar. Said yup, definitely here and he came over.

He gets there and I start telling him the story of what happened literally just 16 hours ago. Tears coming down my face as I'm explaining it all to him, in retrospect it was a difficult situation. As adults, we have life experience that we can act first and feel later. What got me was just explaining getting the diagnosis of my starting lineman... it wasn't fair that his season got stripped from him because of some dumb kid driving too fast.

I'm wasted at this point and my friend told me he was going to take care of me. He texted the cute bar girl (against my protest) that I was there and needed some support, and she responded immediately saying ""I'm putting on better clothes"". She gets there, and she was very kind and comforting. She drives me home, and we sleep together.

The next three weeks we've been meeting up and having a lot of fun re-connecting. We talked about all that happened with us since we ended things, the new guy she was dating, the girl I dated. We talked about work, life, and this past weekend about us and where we were. I told her I still feel the same way I felt, that if I gave up on my desire to start a family to be with her, there would always be a small part of me that would wonder what-if... And the last thing I would want to do is to resent her for it, she deserves only the best.

**EPILOGUE**

Which brings me to today. We texted each other ending the relationship, and we both agreed that it wouldn't be safe to have a FWB relationship or to continue meeting with each other. And it just killed me. I lie to myself saying ""Right girl, wrong time"" and I know this is a wishy-washy thought, but it's this type of girl that I'm looking for.

Someone who is kind, nurturing, who builds up my confidence and is a genuine joy to be around. To paraphrase her last message to me:

""I want you to have the future you envision for yourself and we both know I can't give you that. Thank you for making me feel truly appreciated ❤️ you've shown me what it could be like when I find the right person, and I am so thankful for that! Good luck!""

  
Broken. Sad. Just in my thoughts and feelings about everything right now. And now I have to wrap this up to go coach more football... I'm sure something crazy nuts is going to happen, but today I just feel a lot of sadness for what could have been. Thinking if I'm making the right choice by ending a great thing for what seems like a far off fantasy.   
  
What if I end up single forever and I blew this chance with a great woman? Maybe I will meet a girl who is just as crazy about me as I would be for her? What if I don't end up having kids... Is what I'm doing good enough?

And I know that I just need to allow myself to feel things, it's just hard because I feel like I have no time to process things. I've been in production mode for so long, so I decided to ignore work and just write all this stuff out. My therapist knows all of this too, so I'll be continuing to take one step in front of the other and keep working on myself.

It's anti-inflammatory, naturally sweet, and way better than any coffee shop version I've tried.

**Ingredients:**

* 1.5 cups oat milk (or any plant milk - see notes below)
* 1 tsp ground turmeric
* 1/2 tsp ground ginger
* 1/4 tsp cinnamon
* Pinch of black pepper (helps turmeric absorption)
* 1-2 tsp maple syrup or sweetener of choice
* Optional: pinch of cardamom or vanilla extract

**Instructions:**

1. Add all ingredients to a small pot
2. Whisk constantly over medium heat until steaming (don't boil)
3. Pour into a mug and enjoy! You can froth it first if you want it extra fancy.

**Tips:**

* The black pepper is KEY - it increases turmeric absorption by like 2000%
* Start with less turmeric if you're new to it (the flavor can be strong)
* I've tried this with different plant milks and oat milk is the creamiest, but soy milk works great too if you want more protein
* Make a big batch and store in the fridge - just reheat as needed

It's perfect for winding down at night, and the turmeric is great if you're dealing with any inflammation or joint pain. Plus it's naturally caffeine-free so it won't mess with your sleep.

Anyone else a golden milk fan? Would love to hear your variations!

1okbk1z,https://www.reddit.com/r/traumatizeThemBack/comments/1okbk1z/dont_wiggle_the_needle/,Don’t wiggle the needle!,"I was watching The Click, and this popped into mind. 

Back in 2018 (I was 43M), I needed bloodwork done the day before my hernia surgery. I have a major issue: the vasovagal reaction. Blood outside my body doesn't bother me; I can clean up a bad cut or nosebleed without issue, but when it's being actively taken? Instant dizziness, nausea, and the whole room turns into the Gravitron.

I told the phlebotomist this upfront. My usual workaround is lying down and having an extra alcohol wipe to smell. Her response was a masterpiece of ""yeeeeah, no."": ""We don't have a place for you to lie down, and I can't spare any wipes."" Okay, fine. I was seated at a table and figured I'd try to tough it out since the bloodwork was mandatory, and I really wanted to get this surgery over and done with. 

She got the needle in and started drawing. Five vials were needed. Five. I assume they were feeding a small hospital vampire. I was doing okay, maybe a little pale and clammy, but holding steady, until the blood flow stopped.

She looked confused. I pointed out, gently, that the tourniquet was still on. She looked me right in the eye and said, ""It's supposed to stay in."" I was already struggling, and this baffling moment of incompetence pushed me over the edge. At that point, she did the worst thing possible. Instead of, you know, taking the tourniquet off to allow more blood to flow into my arm, she reached across the table and WIGGLED THE NEEDLE WHILE IT WAS STILL IN MY ARM.  The second that happened, it was over for me. No amount of white knuckling it could get me through. I instantly went from on the struggle bus to full-on Linda Blair projectile mode. Since I hadn't needed to fast, the massive Denny's feast I'd had on the way in: pancakes, eggs, sausage, and coffee erupted from me and landed all over her. For anyone who remembers You Can’t Do That on Television, it looked like she’d just said “I don’t know,” but Nickelodeon let the slime go bad. 

She had multiple warnings. There were multiple points of failure (the tourniquet, the no-wipes rule, not letting me lie down,) and then the final, catastrophic error of wiggling a sharp object inside a patient. I didn't feel bad for a second. She had to have someone else come in and deal with the biohazard and the needle in my arm. 

I walked out after a short recovery rest, feeling completely fine, ready for surgery the next day, and utterly unbothered by the fact that I had just covered a healthcare professional in a breakfast buffet.

I know, I know some of you might be laughing reading this and it might be a little contradictory but I’m looking for an espresso machine around $500 that has a more durable and industrial feel to it to start my home setup. I already have a DF54 grinder so I’m set there. 

I used to be a barista at a chain coffee shop for about 5 years, so I’m used to working on expensive, high quality, industrial grade equipment (Nuova Simonelli to be specific). My main concern is buying a machine and hating it because it feels too plastic-y and cheap compared to what I’m used to. BUT, my budget doesn’t allow to drop thousands on an espresso machine, unfortunately..

I’m not familiar with home machines or brands whatsoever so I’m curious if there’s any machines out there within or around my budget that would have a higher quality feel to them.

1okb7z8,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1okb7z8/the_ramsey_deer/,The Ramsey Deer,"It must first be said that the deer in Ramsey Township are not of high moral standing. Residents of the township have learned the hard way that trash bins must be locked in at night and toys cannot be left out in the yard. The city has even had to fortify the telephone poles, lest a rutting stage get any ideas. The deer are, by all means, nuisances, but you aren’t allowed to hunt them. Instead, a select few are chosen to feed them intentionally.  
  
My neighbor, Mrs. Chapman, was one of the deer feeders. I used to think she was intimidating. There was no fence between her yard and ours, so after we’d moved in, my mother would chat with her while sipping her morning coffee. Mrs. Chapman spoke in a flat, humorless tone. Her eyes did not convey any particular feeling, unless my mother laughed, then a fleeting smile would cross her face. Her nails were short and chipped, her hands had thick calluses and thin, white scars. They talked about the weather, the mole hills in the lawn, the beautiful flowers around town. If you asked Mrs. Chapman, she could find a way for just about anything to be the deers’ fault.  
  
“They took down the soccer goals at the park. Damn deer must be getting tangled in the nets again.”  
  
“It's rutting season. That’s why your tires are flat.”  
  
“The window at the butcher’s shop is broken. Those damn deer.”  
  
“Why don’t they get rid of them?” My mother once asked. “Surely they’re not worth the trouble?”  
  
“You don’t hurt Ramsey deer,” said Mrs. Chapman. That was the answer anyone gave when it came to the deer. Like a bad football team, people would openly hate the deer until confronted about them. Our neighbors would shake their fists at toppled recycling bins and downed power lines, but at town hall meetings, they’d espouse the environmental benefits of the deer and the ethics of hunting. No, you don’t hurt Ramsey deer. Those are \*our\* deer.   
  
The first time I saw a Ramsey deer up close was in the fall of 2010. I’d crashed into my yard and flopped into a freshly raked pile of leaves, certain that nothing was more difficult than middle school pre-algebra. The sky was streaked with orange and pink. The days were getting shorter, and I hadn’t gotten used to the early arrival of night yet.  
  
The first signal was the sniffing. Something huffed and puffed nearby, a sound deeper than what I’d heard my dog do. Then came the pawing and stomping. The deer had seen me and were curious. Two does filed out of the woods politely, and I sat in awe of their red pelts. I’d never seen deer with coats like this before; faint black streaks stretched over their haunches just like the stripes on a tiger. A stag came out next, velvet fur still covering his magnificent antlers. It was early in the season yet; their antlers would eventually shed that fur and be smooth.  
  
The deer looked directly at me. Their eyes were remarkably feline: forward-facing and round. The male stalked closer, faint scars criss-crossed his snout. I backed away slowly as he drew nearer. His yellow eyes reflected the street lights and seemed to glow menacingly. His lips curled—I hadn’t known they could do that—and revealed rows and rows of hooked teeth with deep orange enamel.  
  
A deep voice called behind me, “Alice.”  
  
The deer dropped its predatory stance. The does pricked their ears towards someone behind me. I scooted all the way backwards until my back hit Mrs. Chapman’s legs.  
  
“The deer! They’re—“  
  
Mrs. Chapman tutted at me and pulled me up by my backpack. “Stand tall, it’s alright.”  
  
I would’ve begged to differ, but Mrs. Chapman had already dropped a large, slightly damp cube into my hands. It was larger than my entire fist, and it dripped red juice down my wrists. Large flakes of salt coated it like breading on chicken. “You ever fed a horse before? Hold your hand out flat.”  
  
“Are you crazy?” I squealed. The deer all bared their teeth at the sound. I tried to hide behind Mrs. Chapman, but she held me firmly in front of her.  
  
“If you give them food, they’ll associate you with something good. Hold out your hand.”  
  
I watched one of the does prowl closer, sniffing the air curiously. I looked back at Mrs. Chapman, expecting her face to be inscrutable. Instead, she had the same smile she wore when joking with my mother. Subtle, but confident and kind.   
  
The doe came closer. I shut my eyes and slowly extended my hand, expecting the scrape of teeth. A long, course tongue lapped at my fingers. Mrs. Chapman tutted at me for not holding my hand flat enough. I stiffened my elbow and held the cube up higher. Soon, all three creatures were lapping at my offering. I opened my eyes just in time for one of the does to delicately pluck the cube from my hand. She pranced away and shook her head, more deer-like than predatory. Mrs. Chapman tossed more cubes indelicately towards the other two, and the stag stupidly rammed his antlers into the dirt in his hurry to get one.  
  
I lowered my arm as Mrs. Chapman pointed to the ground. “Look.”  
  
The first doe had lain down, her yawn revealing many rows of teeth with a few missing canines. She lowered her head, and beneath her nose sprouted fresh, green grass. Beneath the other doe’s hooves, batches of verdant moss erupted from deadened grass. The stag, having finally retrieved his food, pulled his antlers out of the dirt, and in their place was a spray of delicate bean sprouts.  
  
Over time, I noticed more of what other people had to say about the deer. “I hate having them in my yard,” said the old man at the bakery. “But my garden’s never looked greener.” One of my classmates, a puny little girl, wrote a paper about her hero, Mrs. Chapman, who wrestled a soccerball from a deer’s mouth and returned it to her with a bouquet coming out of its seams. My own mother told me never to go outside while the deer were out, yet she cooed at a striped and spotted doe from the porch one evening.  
  
Today, there is a very tentative peace between the deer and the people. More people have signed up to feed the deer, but the complaints against them grow harsher and harsher each year. New construction has had to be cancelled due to ruminant interference. People have moved away. Parks are empty long before sunset. But as I sit on the porch watching a snaggle-toothed fawn wobble through its parents' trail of sprouts and buds, I can’t help but extend a cut of meat and hope for beautiful blooms to follow.",1,1761857197.0,KeepWriting,2,1.0,False

**TLDR: I need a first-experience process guide on how to establish LLC in US with the bank and virtual address/number details explained too, so I can setup both paypal and stripe from Pakistan and use it as payment for international clients.**

I have global (one-time) clients who pay for photoshop edits I do on Psr/ PsRs. I used to use BuyMeaCoffee for a global payment link which was a breeze; whereafter I could withdrew the amount using Payoneer. Unfortunately, a year back they changed their withdrawal to stripe only. Since, it's Pakistan, and no such easy solution exist. I  used my cousin's paypal who resides in Australia but he had to keep 33% of all the amounts received because of the tax slab he falls in which was definitely worst option for me. Lastly, I used a person's paypal, whom I found on reddit, using his company's link to receive funds and then him transferring it to xoom or wise to send them to me. That process also involved delays in response and unorganized transactions. 

Its important to highlight that the [Paypal.me](http://Paypal.me) and paypal donations are most popular (direct) ways all global clients can pay me. Other secondary payments (BMC, KOFI) adds an additional layer to fee deduction if used so I avoid using them, unless absolute necessary.

I am in desperate need to learn and setup paypal/ stripe/ wise on my own.

My partner and I (both 27, both very much in our *“we need to escape capitalism and eat carbs in peace”* era) are heading to Italy for a whole month in April. We’re from Copenhagen, Denmark — which means we’re pale, under-sunned, and emotionally dependent on coffee. ☕️

The plan: rent an apartment somewhere in Italy for a month, live like locals, and pretend we don’t have responsibilities. We want a city that’s fun to *live* in — not just visit for a few days.

After way too many hours of research (and Reddit scrolling), we’ve narrowed it down to **Perugia** or **Bologna**.

Here’s the vibe we’re going for:

* Chill, but not *too* chill.
* Local life > tourist traps.
* Pasta, wine, art, culture — all the clichés, but in a genuine way.
* **Bonus points** if there’s good access to *nature, hiking trails, or day trips into the countryside.*
* A place where we can go on little adventures, but also just hang out and exist.

Our dilemma:

* **Perugia** looks beautiful and authentic, surrounded by nature, but… is it *too* quiet? Like, will we just end up talking to pigeons after week two?
* **Bologna** seems amazing — food, culture, location — but maybe a bit too big or touristy? Or does it depend on the neighborhood?

Basically, we’re looking for that sweet spot between *peaceful Italian life* and *not losing our minds from boredom*, ideally with some great hikes and countryside vibes nearby.

So — anyone been to Perugia in April? Is there life in the streets, or is it just us and the church bells?  
Or should we go with Bologna as the safer “we can always escape to a smaller town” option?

1okb0bm,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePunchFans/comments/1okb0bm/six_degrees_of_stench/,Six Degrees of Stench,"Three years ago, I wrote a series of lightish-hearted what ifs about Kuseno, being pretty sure nothing I put down would come to pass. Original [here](https://gofancyninjaworld.tumblr.com/post/698487693134479360/six-degrees-of-stench) \-- as you see, I've not edited anything. Some rhyme more than I'd like with current events. ONE is annoying. 



I joke/not joke that One-Punch Man canonicity consists of canon and not canon (yet)[ link](https://gofancyninjaworld.tumblr.com/post/672130135925915648/canon-vs-non-canon). Wild shit just happens because it can and somehow it works.

So, for shits and giggles, a handful of headcanons that I’m fairly sure \*won’t\* be becoming canon.

***First degree: cute***

When Genos wants to wheedle a new toy (like a kit car) out of Kuseno, he makes the old man his favourite treat: home-made doughnuts, a chocolate dipping sauce, and freshly-ground coffee made over the stove. Kuseno claims every time that it won’t work. It’s never failed.

Kuseno is strict about his bedtime: from the time he retires at 11 pm to when he appears at 6 am, Genos better have a damn good reason for disturbing him. A leg dropping off does not qualify. Most afternoons, Kuseno also has a nap behind his desk. He has always claimed to be just mediating when Genos has asked.

***Second degree: unexpected***

Although neither man knows it, Kuseno is the reason King quit competitive gaming: there was this one mysterious guy he just couldn’t beat. It still haunts King.

Kuseno himself no longer does competitive gaming: between Genos keeping him busy and missing his once-faithful rival, it’s lost its appeal.

***Third degree: connections***

Bofoi was his old student.  They each changed their names for… reasons.

***Fourth degree: Chekov’s gunman… or there’s no badass like an old badass***

**Manga-only***.*  Kuseno finally shows up to give his boy a hand. As Genos tells Kuseno to fall back already, the old man levels one of the suit’s shoulder-mounted guns and… there’s a void where there was once a dragon-level monster, not even a curl of smoke remaining.  Kuseno: yeah, I came up with this last week but I’ve not yet figured out how to make it small enough to install on you.

***Fifth degree: Old man, you scary***

**Webcomic-only**.  The climax of the battle sees Genos and Saitama get to the heart of the Organization and just as things are getting super tense, a third person joins the fray.  It’s Kuseno, heavily armed and very much alive. That bring-back-a-dead-person-so-long-as-their-brain-is-intact technology we saw elsewhere?  He was the original inventor.  Genos: but you told me to run away!  Kuseno: And yet, here you are. Be so kind as to shelter behind Saitama-kun, will you? Kuseno (to the enemy): I don’t mind if Genos gets beat up, that’s how my boy learns. But you bastards made him cry…*unleashes hell*

***Sixth degree: Cruel, cruel world***

Like something out of a cruel soap opera, the reason Genos and Child Empror look a bit like each other is that they’re siblings but each was so convinced the other was dead that they’d never thought to look into it. In Isamu’s case, his foster parents had been very good at gaslighting him so he doubted his very memories.  As they compare notes, suddenly the random attack makes sense… it’d been intended to grab Isamu in the first place. Something else makes sense too: why Kuseno had arrived so fortuitously. Genos: Oh, I was the consolation prize.

And so…

**Webcomic edition:** Genos finds his inconsolable grief over losing the old man suddenly become consolable, although it’s down to Saitama to accidentally on purpose to say something that puts it in perspective, e.g., by pointing out that there was nothing false about the affection he had had for him.  

**Manga edition:** Since the old man is alive,  Genos confronts him.  He doesn’t deny it but says that he’d intended to kidnap Child Emperor alone to forestall the massacre that happened.  And yes, while to begin with, he’d thought of Genos as a consolation, he’s long since changed his mind. Yes, it’s true that Genos doesn’t have the mind of the century, but he’s got the sort of intellect one meets only a few times a decade.  His courage though?  That’s the sort people write legends about. Now let’s talk about you trying harder to stay alive long enough to become one.",3,1761856700.0,OnePunchFans,2,1.0,False

This time I have two beards that are around the same age and still on my mother's side. Every time either my mother or other relatives tell stories about this two. I can't help but laugh or faceplam or both. I actually had ask my mom for this one since I needed a refresher and y'all my mother spilled the tea! (sorry for my grammar, this time I'm translating and some things don't translate well)

***The story of philosophybeard!***

Now who the hell are these people may ask. Well let start with Philosophybeard since he's the oldest one. He's also my uncle and my mother's oldest brother. As of writing this he is 76 years old but ohhhhh boy I got some stories. Why did I give him this name? Well you see he is ""the smartest in the family and he's totally well versed in Philosophy and Psychology!"" Ah yes, he's the ""smartest"" illiterate person you'll ever meet! I'm not joking nor being a dick, he is 100% illiterate, he could barely read at a first-grade level, barely write his name and he could barely do simple math. But He's totally a owner-op of a fruit import company and he 100% owns a car dealership you guys./s However, keep the that on the backburner cuz I'm taking you back to the 70's!

Picture it! It is the 70's in Mexico and Philosophybeard is 20 and been married for 3 years. It was a different time and back then it was normal to marry young. However, just because one is married doesn't mean they have/is mature. What do I mean by that? Well Another uncle/older bother of my mother who I'll be naming Salty Sal because that's his actual nickname in the family (this is the closes I can translate FYI), Now Salty Sal was around 15-16 at this time and have gotten himself a driver's license and had stopped by to Philosophybeard's place to visit. One thing to note that Philosophybeard's wife at the time just had a baby 6 months ago and Salty Sal just promise to deliver to care package from my grandma. At first, the visit was ok until Salty Sal, being the family's prankster/troublemaker thought of something to ""have fun for a bit"". The wife give a look to Philosophybeard that screamed ""don't you fucking dare"" but being a man of ""Philosophy"" give a bullshit monologue about ""seeking happiness from day to day life"". But Salty Sal ain't got time for that so he said cut the shit and just follow him. Since it's a small town were everybody knows everyone, Salty Sal invited my other uncle Pickled Paul (not is actual name duh) to come with them to an area of their small town dubbed ""Shot-Down Acre"" (again doesn't translate well). Now what's ""Shot-Down Acre"", it's literally an square acre of open field where the town's folk go for target practice. The old school way, as in glass bottles. But wait why are they there? They don't have guns and it's the middle of the week? Y'all, Salty Sal took them there to ""race"" their cars and do ""donuts"" on the dirt! To Note, not only Phliosophybeard is married with a kid, but also Salty Sal and Pickled Pal. (again different times) Just like any small town, word traveled fast and guess heard and got mad? If you guessed the wives then you're 100% WRONG! My grandmother was the one to go over there. Of course my mother being a kid at the time and overheard, she told me this, ""Mijo! When your grandma saw your uncles doing donuts, she stand right in the middle causing them to stop! They yelled at her saying 'what the hell ma I could have killed you'. I've never seen my mother so angry that she, one by one, slapped them in the face!"" All I could say is ""really?"" but I think this next part is just my mother being extra but she said that my grandma dragged all three of them to their wives and basically scold them in front of the wives like they are kids.

lets jump forward to 2003. I was 5-6 years old and visiting Salty Sal because now he lives up in Northern California. It was Salty Sal and his wife and his kids, My mom, dad, my sister and me in that summer. Philosophybeard came alone to visit the family. It was one those simple visit that the family just hangs out but Philosophybread however had other plans that'll come up later. This one I remember clearly because I kinda/sort of had a hand in it. Around these time, Salty Sal's kids were teenagers and they and his wife when out shopping while the rest of us stayed home. It was mostly My mom and uncles remembering their childhood when Philosophybeard pulled out a small box from his pocket and place it on the kitchen counter. Me being the noisy little shit, I grab it and read it. It was a box of men's hair dye, like a dark shade of ginger hair dye. Philosophybeard was never ginger FYI. what I could read, it said ""DO NOT PUT ON FACE"" in bold ass letters. Here's the thing, Philosophybeard was fucking bald but he did had a moustache and beard. He came in and I asked him ""what's this *tio?* And why does it say not for face?"" in Spanish. He just padded my head and when on his usual Philosophy monologue that left child me blankly starring. But what got me is when he explain that hair dye is just paint for hair, I got hella excited and I was yelling ""I WANNA HELP I WANNA HELP! Can I help paint your hair *tio?!*"" He said yes mainly because it was in English, not Spanish and he's illiterate anyway. I helped him mix this powder and liquid into this bottle and he was about to add to his beard but I loudly said ""YOU CAN'T! THE BOX SAID NOT ON FACE!"" Again he padded my head and said not to worry and it's just paint before my mother called for everyone to come and have lunch. He told me to tell my mom that he's busy and I did, leaving him to it because adults know better right? An hour passes and I wanted to see his ""painted beard"", so I when looking for him and I saw him and I was shocked from what I saw and I went running to my mother. I was yelling ""MOMMY MOMMY MOMMY MOMMYYYYYY!"" (I was a handful looking back), My mother angry at for yelling asking ""why are you yelling? Use your indoor voice."" I said ""Mama! Uncle Philosophybeard is wearing lipstick!"" Everybody looked at me then headed towards Philosophybeard. My uncle Philosophybeard was having a chemical reaction from the hair dye and his lips became so red and swollen it look like a baboon's ass. If my family had camera phones back then, bet your sweet bippy they would have taken pictures because they never have let this one down. Everybody was asking what the hell happened and me be being the snot-nose tat-a-tell rat, I told them everything. So, long story short, they took him to the hospital, I was told to stop being nosey and I have a funny story to tell.

***A Tacky Story About a Tacky Guy!***

This part imma start of with earliest tale that a another uncle who I'll call ""Mr. Whisky"" cuz he a good bottle of whisky. This take us back to Mexico. Tackybeard was 16 at the time and Disco was hot and popping for the young people. Have you guy ever seen the movie Saturday Night Fever? The one with John Travolta? Well every dude from the ages of 13 to 35 in the 70's wanted to dress like the main character. Tackybeard got himself the same suit as the main character but instead being white with black, it was a sandy brown and white. But, those suits are not cheap! And he worked as a newspaper boy so where did he get the money? Y'all he ""borrowed"" money from my grandmother's purse. When my grandmother found out, she blew her fucking lid. How did she found out? Well it was the 1970's and cellphones haven't been invented yet and everyone had one house phone and the tailor-shop called that number when my grandmother was so happened to be home and answered the call. At the time, Tackybeard was with my other uncle and my grandmother with fury and determination, she power-walk the four miles (6.5 kilometers) to her sons' hang out spot. Picture a 50-something year old woman entering a small and popular diner where teens would hang-out after school/after work. Tackybeard was shocked to see her, thinking something is wrong. I mean yes, something was wrong but not what he thought at the time. Nope, what he got was a big slap on the back of the head nd grandmother outing him for being a total dumbass. Unfortunately, the tailor-shop couldn't give a full refund since the suit is pretty much done and my grandfather thought it would be a good idea for him to pay off the suit. How? By making Tackybeard work with my grandfather on the farm. Tackybeard would come home tired as hell that it took sometime for him to even show off the suit and dance moves. Honestly, I wish I could see it because from what I've heard, he CAN dance when he was younger.

Now this next beard is another uncle of mine and this time, most of this starts us off in the early 2000's. Picture it, it is the summer of either 2001 or 2002, my mother, father, my sister and me where sitting at the kitchen when my mother's Nokia cell phone started to ring (I think is was a Nokia 6230 but it was years ago). I remember the look of my mother's face when her own brother asked her to ""come visit her in Las Vegas because it's been a long time!"" Now the one thing about Tackybeard is at the time, he owned a jewelry shop in Burbank CA before moving near Las Vegas. He looks exactly like one of those foreign guys with the gold chains, big-ass rings and those stupid sunglasses that are way-too-big for his face but he's only light skinned. My mother being the woman with zero chill, point-blank asked ""what the fuck you want, you only call to gloat"". Cue Tackybeard goes ""what? No I would never! Your my little sister I would never"" and blah blah blah BLAH! So my mom agrees to visit him but under one condition, the moment Tackybeard and his wife talks shit about the way my family lives, we're leaving and taking his Hennessey. Yes my mom would threaten Tackybeard by taking one bottle of his favorite booze. So my mother and father started packing for the weekend and as I grabbing my clothes to pack, my mother comes up to me and sister to uhhh ""brief"" us about my uncle's wife. Tackybeard's wife is a Mormon while he was Catholic. How does that work? Well it did work until he found a ""younger"" girl and divorce his wife at the age of 67 but more on that later. So with the car loaded up we head the road to to visit Tackybeard. Now I barely remember this road trip, which is weird cuz I feel like visiting family and going on a road trip should be a core memory right? No, the only things I could remember is ONE: Tacktbeard's wife, that I'll call her ""Jane"", would give my parents and Tackybeard dirty looks for drinking coffee, tea and booze. I understand the booze part but COFFEE AND TEA?! My dad had to explain my sister and I that Mormons can't drink coffee nor tea cuz of their religion. TWO: my family only stayed for like a week and two things happened, the first is that Tackybeard would argue Jane about her giving up 10% of her checks to the Mormon church. The other thing is that the reason Tackybeard asked my mother to visit is to convince Jane to take out a loan so he can start his own recording studio.

No I'm not joking, he was dead serious about entering the music industry. He even ""help record"" a random band and uploaded one video of their song on his YouTube. I would 100% add a link of the song if it wasn't for, One: Tackybeard put his face, NOT THE BANDMATES, thoughout the video, Two: Song and the band itself suck ass and it's in Spanish and lastly: He took down the video because and I quote ""The internet is so mean! I put out great music and people on the internet don't have good taste!"" Yeah it's the internet fault and not the band's horrible singing that sounded like a dying cat and playing their instruments thinking they're pros when in fact they were playing for six months. Again, I'm not being a dick (okay maybe kinda) but he showed me and my sister the video years later after the loan argument. Now, did he get the loan? HELL NAH! My mom called him a ""fucking dumb ass"" he doesn't know anything about making music and in that moment he asked everyone, including his wife to leave his house.

Lets jump forward about 8 years ago. Tackybeard's divorce! Boy oh bot this one was odd. You see Tackybeard and Jane had been married for 40 years at this point and he wanted to divorce her for two reasons. The first one is he's had it with his wife sending 10% of her paycheck to the church of latter day saints. Being Mormon she had to do it and the second reason for the divorce her is that ""he fall out of love"" I.E he wanted to cheat on her but his Catholic guilt was eating at him even though divorce is a big no-no in the Catholic church. As soon as those papers were signed, Tackybeard set up a dating profile in some of those dating sites for people over 55. At first, he was getting dates left and right and telling family his ""amazing new life"". But he soon realized online dating was shit! His first few dates were just for fun but got real nasty when many of them wanted a partnership. He thought he could find someone will to live in a way he wanted but these are women in their 50's, they ain't got time for that crap! So Tackybeard deleted his profile and made a new one on Tinder, hoping to find someone younger. But he ended up deleting that one after a month cuz in his words ""young women today are nothing but gold diggers!"".

My mom being my mom, asked why and he was jumping around the answer. My mom told to ""cut the shit"" and y'all, this part was the first time I saw my mom smack the shit out of someone older then her. Turns out my uncle listed in his profile as a ""music producer"" and a ""stock market expert"" when the closes thing to stocks was him reading the newspaper about the economy and yelling ""GOD DAMN PRESIDENT \[insert any American president of your chose\]"". My mom told him ""what in the ever loving shit thought this was a good idea?"" to which Tackybeard responded with a simple ""I want to see what is like to date younger girls"" his words and mine. I don't remember much after that other then my mother driving back home with a look of ""My family is exhausting"". But fear not! Unlike Glamourbeard, there's a happy turn around in this tale!

Picture it! It's 2016 and I just graduated from high school! Before I transition to a man and did the whole Queenie saga, I took a year off school to One: rest my brain and Two: help out the family. Since I spend most my years going to schools for Latino kids and high school was my first time going to a school that only spoke English. My family wanted to put my ""skills"" to work. Yup they wanted me and my sister to translate for the English-speaking tourist for the summer. So My sister and I worked on my family bakery as the only ones that spoke English. Cue Philosophybeard, he was in the area and he thought he could bring more costumers by giving a ""philosophy essay"". AKA, not shutting the fuck up about Mexican politics. We lost people that day and my aunt that took over the bakery after my Grandmother died told Philosophybeard to fuck off and don't come back.

This story does have a happy ending however. Philosophybeard ended up mellowing out by a lot when he met his first grandchild. He still talks about Philosophy but now he talks about about folklore which I prefer cuz he's better at it then Philosophy. As for Tackybeard, he ended up moving back to the small town he grew up in. He gives updates on Glamourbeard. Tackybeard however has stopped trying to be someone who has money and now he self reflected and now owns the town's liquor stop that sells American liquor. He's making good profits not going to lie. My mother has gotten closer to her two brother once both of them have mellowed out and when they get together, they have the best tea times and they all have gotten shit-faced, once or twice. The one thing I hate from this, is Philosophybeard won't shut up about the ""Philosophy on transgenderism"". Bro, it's not that deep!

Thank you for reading, this is a shorter one since they aren't as bad as Glamourbeard. I'll have more in the future and maybe ask my father for some stories of his youth cuz y'all, they're wild.

Rating: 10/10!!!

2️⃣ WARM WISHES
Notes: Iced Oatmilk, Fluffy Vanilla & Candy Cane Crunch.
(Label says: Iced Oatmilk, Sweet Almonds, Creamy Caramel & Coffee Beans.)

Okay, so the notes on the label and website don’t quite match but either way, I’m only getting the Candy Cane Crunch! 🍬

Where’s the “latte” vibe it’s supposed to have?? It has a cooling vibe almost like a cough drop. Not bad, just not what I expected!

Rating: 7/10.

3️⃣ LAVENDER SNOWFALL
Notes: Frosted Lavender, Cooling Peppermint, Fallen Snow & White Woods.

Now this is how you do lavender and peppermint!! 💜 The lavender is heavenly not too medicinal, more of a soft herbal lavender.

Rating: 9/10!

6️⃣ COZY HOME
Notes: Warm Woods, Toasted Coconut, Soft Cashmere & Creamy Amber.

An OG Goose Creek scent apparently it’s been 7–10 years since this one last dropped (per YouTube reviews)!

It actually reminds me a bit of Midnight Vanilla from the spring release not quite as strong, but similar in tone. Not my fave of the bunch, but still nice and cozy.

1okashi,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritersGroup/comments/1okashi/critiques_on_first_chapter_of_a_middle_grade/,Critiques on first chapter of a middle grade fantasy book before querying [1360],"Hello,

I'm hoping to start querying this book soon and would love some feedback on my first chapter.

Thanks!

**Chapter 1**

James searched the bottom of his backpack until he felt a pair of wire snips. Heart pounding, he put the blades around the thick wire of a chain-link fence, took a deep breath, and squeezed until his hand shook. It snapped so loudly that he jumped back and peaked over a bush to scan the park for witnesses again. With no one in sight, he got back to work. 

The sun would rise soon so he quickly made five more cuts in a vertical line and squeezed through the flap. The woods were dark, but James moved down the trail with ease. After passing a paper birch, he slowed his pace to check a thin thread stretched across the trail, giving a sigh of relief to see that it was unbroken. He stepped over the thread, rounded a corner, and there it was: a wooden treehouse tucked safely in the branches of a giant maple tree.

James ran up to the tree to give it a hug before stopping himself and settling for a pat on its rough bark. He wasn't sure if it would still be intact after Suncorp, a secretive new company, bought up all the remaining forest outside his small Ohio town and sealed it behind a barbed-wire-topped-fence. It had been a miserable month for him and his friend, Maggie, as they sat on the swings wondering what was happening deep in the woods on the other side. Heavy machinery pounded and strange smells that many described as “violent” would often drift out. He couldn’t wait to tell her that they had a way in and that Operation Surveillance could officially begin.

James walked over to a neighboring tree and pulled a hidden line. A rope ladder unraveled and stopped just before hitting the ground. He climbed the swaying ladder up to the treehouse and poked his head inside. It was intruder-free, so he pulled himself up and lit an oil lamp on the table.

Everything appeared to be as he left it: two of every dish sat neatly in the cabinet, his stack of drawings was still jammed in a cubby, and several playing cards were still strewn about from Maggie throwing her cards up in celebration after a win. Even the *No Trespassing* sign he snatched from a tree before the fence was built was still in the wood stove, ready to be burned.  

James checked his watch and kept moving. A ladder in the corner took him through a hinged opening and onto the roof. He pulled two cameras out of his backpack and screwed them to opposite corners, pointing down at the ground below. He ran the wires back into the house to a tape-covered cookie tin with an antenna sticking out of the top. A flick of a switch turned on a little green light.

“That should do it,” he said with a smile. “We’re watching you now.”

He wished it hadn’t come to cutting fences and setting up cameras, but he couldn’t imagine losing the treehouse forever. He started building it as a place to escape when his dad went missing on an arctic job assignment. Working on it helped keep his mind busy as search parties came back empty-handed. Every detail held a memory; from the window boxes he made at home with his mother to the chimney crafted with his dad’s old coffee cans. With any luck, the network of cameras he was putting up would record Suncorp breaking the law and get them shut down for good.

After one last look around, he blew out the lamp, slung his backpack over his shoulders and closed up the treehouse. James found the faint trail that lead him deeper toward the pounding machines. Ferns brushed against his ankles as he rushed past mature oaks and hickories that towered to the canopy above. The sun began to warm the eastern sky, turning the woods from black to gray. He picked up his pace but skidded to a stop after seeing a large white animal disappear behind a shrub ahead. 

He crouched down and stared into the understory. Eyes wide, James took a few steps closer. The woods were silent aside from Suncorp’s machines, so he gasped when he turned around and saw a barefooted, shirtless boy standing on the trail next to a frost-white coyote. James nearly took off running, but they did not make any moves. James stayed put and studied the wild-looking boy and coyote who both scanned at him with just as much curiosity.

""Hi,"" James eventually said to break the silence.

A hint of a smile pulled at the corner of the boy's lips, but he did not speak.

“Are you with Suncorp?” James asked.

The boy did not like this question and took a step back while the coyote stared at him with piercing blue eyes.  

""Wait! Don’t go!” James pleaded.

The boy paused. A sharp metallic grinding sound reverberated through the trees, causing the boy to wince.  

“I don’t like them either,” James said. “I don’t know what they’re up to, but it can’t be good. I’m going to film them and if they do anything shady, I’ll send it out to every news station in the area.”

The coyote kept its eyes locked on James while the boy looked deep in thought.

“What is that? Over your shoulder,” James asked, pointing to a vine with large black flower buds slung across his chest like a sash. “I’ve never seen any plant like that.""

The boy looked down at his chest and picked one of the bulbs from the vine. He held it between his finger and thumb for James to see. James stepped forward to get a better look, but the boy released the flower from his fingers, letting it fall to the ground.

The flower hit the ground and exploded with a blinding light that left behind a cloud of black smoke. James fell backward onto the ground. He squinted and rubbed away the bright afterimage, only to find that the boy was gone. In a flash, he had vanished into thin air along with the puff of smoke. Feeling uneasy, he turned around and saw the boy standing behind him, coyote at his side.

""What was that!?"" James shouted

The boy smiled.

""Ha ha, very funny,"" James said, blushing. ""Where did you even come from?”

The boy thought for a moment and reached into a pouch that hung at his hip and pulled out a shiny brown seed the size of an acorn. He held the seed in his palm, wrapped his fingers around it, and squeezed until his hand trembled. James watched in amazement as tiny, thread-like roots grew through the cracks of his fingers and dangled below. A green stem shot up between two of his fingers, sprouting leaves and a feathery purple blossom as it grew. The boy opened his hand to expose a bundle of roots sitting on his palm with an exotic-looking flower that bobbed around on its stem. He held it out for James to take.

James hesitated but then carefully took the flower from his hand. The delicate petals spiraled outward form a central hole that seemed to swallow all light. He held it to his nose for a sniff and was immediately transported to a misty swamp below a rocky waterfall. An unusual bird with black and yellow stripes was drinking the nectar of the same type of purple flower he held in his hand. After drinking its fill, the bird flew off to the window of a house built in the canopy of the boggy forest.

""What the—How did--- Is this where you live?"" James asked as the vision faded.

He opened his eyes, expecting to see the boy standing before him, proud and amused, but there was no one there. No poof of smoke, no blinding light. Just James, the flower, and two bouncing ferns. James ran to the ferns, but the boy was long gone. He wondered if he should chase after him but at this point it was fully light out so he had to get back to the fence. ",1,1761856186.0,WritersGroup,1,1.0,False

I'm extremely introverted so it's hard to make new friends, and I think I prefer people similar to me(and similar age as well) since we might get each other more. I'm also a massive nerd and I do like my maths and physics and I've had so many maths memes I want to send to someone but can't coz I don't know anyone who does maths or physics. Also want to game with someone(I mainly game and do physics, but I also do normal activities like archery, climbing, running, batminton, gym). Also just want someone I'll just vibe with immediately, just wanna skip the awkward small talk at the start while dodging in and out of do I talk more or not stuff. Ik it's not realistic, but its a nice comfort thought. I think as a massive introvert I'm just very bad at small talk, especially with new people. Whereas with people I already know I can talk about the stuff I want to talk about and be familiar and make talking easier and actually enjoyable and not tiring.

Basically if you think that when we start talking and the vibe is immediately like the picture below, then you're the right person. Come chat.

1okaq7a,https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoriaCivilis/comments/1okaq7a/the_last_looting/,The Last Looting,"The looting did not begin today.
It began centuries ago, when they crossed the sea with crosses and cannons,
when they called themselves “civilized” while setting entire cultures on fire.
They reached lands that shone for their wisdom,
and they covered them with blood.

They said “savages” to those who knew the rhythm of the stars,
to those who cultivated without destroying,
to those who built cities aligned with the sun and the constellations.
The Mayans calculated time with a precision that Europe would not understand until centuries later.
The Incas designed agricultural and hydraulic systems impossible to match even today.
They lived in balance with the earth,
without needing to dominate it,
because they knew that to dominate what sustains you is to destroy you.

But the real savages were those who came from the north,
with his insatiable thirst for gold, god and power.
They burned libraries, demolished temples, raped women and called that “evangelization.”
In the name of their god they extinguished entire cultures.
And when they couldn't destroy everything, they stole it:
They stole knowledge, art, minerals, bodies, souls.

That looting never ended.
He only changed his flag, his form and his costume.
Today they don't use swords, they use treaties.
They don't use iron chains, they use debts.
They do not crucify in squares, they crucify with hunger.
Colonialism dressed in a suit and tie,
and slavery is called “employment.”

Europe, the United States and their white descendants continue to live off the sweat and soil of the South.
They looted before and they loot now:
gold, oil, lithium, water, data, brains, life.
And they still call themselves “civilized”,
while they export wars, poverty and toxic waste to the same people they once called savages.

They called us primitive because we didn't need money to live,
because we didn't build prisons to lock up time,
because we knew that nature is not possessed, it is respected.
They, who destroyed forests to build concrete temples,
who created borders to divide what never had limits,
They called themselves “humans” and denied us humanity.

And yet, the true superiors were those who sowed without exploiting,
those who looked at the sky to understand the cycle of the world,
those who did not need to conquer to feel alive.
The Mayans, the Incas, the Aztecs, the indigenous peoples of the entire world,
They owned the knowledge before Europe learned to wash its hands.

But the heirs of the looting are still there:
with new flags, with different names,
stealing what's left of the planet and calling it ""progress.""
They have made a religion of their lies:
a religion where money is god, and destruction, worship.

They live believing themselves superior because they only know how to look from above.
But what they see is not power,
It is the shadow of its emptiness.
Because their progress is fed by the misery that they themselves sow.
They are a species that survives by devouring what they hate and fear.

And yet, they depend on the same world they despised.
They depend on the south, the sun, the minerals, the land and the work they do not know how to do.
Without the “savage,” the civilized dies.
And when the “savage” wakes up and closes his hands,
the north will fall under the weight of its own ego.

The power of these “rich” countries is not in what they produce, but in what they steal.
Because if the so-called “poor”—who are actually the richest in natural resources—
decided to close their borders, stop selling their minerals, their water, their lives,
the system would collapse in a matter of months.

The United States lives off debt, from the infinite printing of dollars without real backing.
Europe depends on gas, lithium, copper, cocoa, gold, coffee and cheap labor that comes from the south.
Japan matters even the ground it steps on.
The north needs the south to exist,
but he has made the south believe that it depends on him.
That is the most perfect trap of modern colonialism.

If the people decided to no longer export a grain, a metal, or a drop of oil,
money would cease to have meaning.
What good is gold if you can't get it out anymore?
What good is the dollar if no one accepts it for nothing?
The entire system is based on economic obedience:
in making you believe that you need to sell,
when in reality they need you to sell.

International alliances, “cooperation” treaties, “development aid” forums…
They are simply control mechanisms disguised as solidarity.
They lend you money that they then force you to return multiplied,
They “help” you while they tie you up.

But if the people of the south—the true heirs of the land—awaken,
If they decide to live off the sun, water and land again,
The empire of money will collapse.
Because true power is not in gold or oil,
but in those who still remember how to live without them.

And meanwhile, the planet is dying.
We are on the verge of collapse, with rivers dying, forests disappearing and the air poisoned.
The land, which was once fertile, turns to dust.
Soon we won't even be able to breathe without the poison they made themselves.
And yet, the “world leaders”—the same old ones—do not address the problem,
because chaos would ruin his control.

They know that the planet is doomed,
but they prefer to keep the masses asleep,
believing that everything remains the same,
that progress will still save something.
They won't. They don't want to save anything.
They are creating his escape, not his redemption.

That's why they spend billions on space expeditions,
not to “seek life”, but to escape from what they are killing.
They build ships for their exodus,
while we, the worker ants,
We continue working, extracting, feeding its machinery with our time and our faith.

They don't address the pollution because their plan is not to remedy the damage,
but to abandon the corpse of the Earth.
And while they search for a new planet to devastate,
We continue breathing the smoke of their lies.

Because global pollution is not a theory: it is evidence.
It is in the air, in the seas, in bodies.
And while the world suffocates, they remain silent.
They are silent because their salvation depends on our silence.
They are silent because a slave who wakes up stops working.

And the day we wake up—when the south remembers its power,
When tired hands refuse to hold his empire—
That day, your whole world will fall.
Money will lose meaning,
the borders will dissolve,
and the Earth, although wounded, will speak again with its own voice",0,1761856029.0,HistoriaCivilis,3,0.29,False

1okaoxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1okaoxv/aio_i_30f_had_2_kids_in_3_years_and_my_husband/,AIO I 30F had 2 kids in 3 years and my husband 46M pushes me for more,"Me and him met a few years ago when I was working at the same company. He is Polish and I am Slovak. We in Slovakia have been some sort of outsourcing for the plant in Poland that he was leading. He always spoke down to my department because customer service it seems is very low. I knew from my boss that he said we are "" trash"". But it wasn't personal for me at that point. I did meet him face to face when he was probably ""forced"" by headquarters to come to Slovakia and meet us. He didn't even answer to my hello. not to my colleagues. He did go out for a coffee with the leader of the customer service but nothing more.

I wanted more and I moved to Poland myself internally, directly to the plant. We basically got to know each other from scratch — he had divorced recently. I was 26 and he was my ""first"" so maybe I didn't ask all the right questions out of inexperience. I don't regret marrying him, but I feel I need to address some stuff

At the plant there were like 7 layers between us. Got married in a few months

We have a daughter and a son. Our daughter is only a few months old. He barely spends any time with them, but now he wants another baby. He comes home always tired, always irritated, and he has daily conflicts with his subordinates. He doesn’t waste time with friends; when he’s not at the office or out working, he’s home with us, but he’s either sleeping or on his phone, always talking about work and stressed out. I will return to work soon, so at the plant he leads and I checked some emails, looking for key words. I found an email with a long chain and at the bottom of it was an email from him saying that all those... Sl0vaks are doing tr#sh work and he wants to get rid of them because they are all a bunch of barely out of high school ""philosophy"" students who came here to take our people's jobs.

He wants another baby and keeps pushing me for it. But I told him I am not having sex with him without birth control. For now I just don't want to do it anyway. And we were fighting one evening because he spankd our toddler. He was having a meeting with his subordinates and our son kept pulling his arm to give him milk from the fridge. Husband kept pushing him away and told him he is busy. My kid started crying, husband had to mute his mic and his image for him is everything and he said that because of this, he looked bad. And he spankd him. However he says he did not push him to the floor. It was a tantrum

We had an argument and he wanted to become intimate with me after it to make up and I didnt want and he kinda forced himself on me. He did not go until the end, he let me go though when I started screaming. He said he was not aware I dont want.",2,1761855947.0,AmIOverreacting,7,0.75,False
1okaomq,https://www.reddit.com/r/travelchina/comments/1okaomq/china_itinerary_check_3_weeks_late_march_april/,"China Itinerary Check (3 weeks late March – April, 2026) 🇨🇦","We’re a Canadian couple — I’ve lived and travelled in China before, but it’ll be my husband’s first time. It’s also my first visit to Sichuan, Xi’an, and Beijing.

We love coffee, tea, matcha, and cosy cafés. We’re serious foodies, addicted to Sichuan peppercorn, and can’t wait for dan dan noodles in Chengdu, biang biang noodles in Xi’an, and zhajiangmian in Beijing. We’re very active (walk 20,000+ steps/day, enjoy running and jogging) and would love 5K scenic running routes in each city — similar to our favourites in Tokyo and Seoul.

We’re interested in street food, night markets, and possibly food tours in Chengdu, Xi’an, and Beijing if they’re worth it.

Our current route is:
Hong Kong (layover) → Chengdu (4 nights) → Chongqing (3 nights) → Xi’an (2 nights)→ Pingyao (1 night) → Beijing (4 nights) → Shanghai (4–5 nights) → Hong Kong (layover)

We prefer high-speed trains where possible.

We added Pingyao to break up the intense city itinerary — but wondering if it’s really worth it or if we might find it too quiet or touristy. We mainly want to see a well-preserved ancient town that’s photogenic and atmospheric.

In Beijing, we’d like to visit the Great Wall (considering Jinshanling for fewer crowds or Mutianyu with the toboggan — is it worth it?).

We’re budget to mid-range travellers and will likely book through Trip.com (my Chinese is basic). Looking for accommodation recs in all cities and any “don’t miss” suggestions for eats, street food, cafés, or local experiences.

Also curious:
    •    Is 2 nights enough in Xi’an, or better to stay 3?
    •    How are the train connections Xi’an → Pingyao → Beijing?
    •    Would it make sense to cut Shanghai to 4 nights and add 1 to Xi’an?

I'm extremely introverted so it's hard to make new friends, and I think I prefer people similar to me(and similar age as well) since we might get each other more. I'm also a massive nerd and I do like my maths and physics and I've had so many maths memes I want to send to someone but can't coz I don't know anyone who does maths or physics. Also want to game with someone(I mainly game and do physics, but I also do normal activities like archery, climbing, running, batminton, gym). Also just want someone I'll just vibe with immediately, just wanna skip the awkward small talk at the start while dodging in and out of do I talk more or not stuff. Ik it's not realistic, but its a nice comfort thought. I think as a massive introvert I'm just very bad at small talk, especially with new people. Whereas with people I already know I can talk about the stuff I want to talk about and be familiar and make talking easier and actually enjoyable and not tiring.

Basically if you think that when we start talking and the vibe is immediately like the picture below, then you're the right person. Come chat.

1okansf,https://www.reddit.com/r/OdysseyBookClub/comments/1okansf/how_i_tricked_my_brain_into_being_productive/,How I tricked my brain into being productive again: the NO-BS guide that finally worked,"Way too many people right now are quietly drowning in burnout. They bounce between motivation videos, TikTok advice from 19-year-olds with ring lights, and productivity tools they never open again. Being constantly busy but weirdly unproductive has become the new normal. If that’s you, this post might help.

This isn’t another “just wake up at 5 am and drink lemon water” thread. This is based on what actually works, backed by real research, books, podcasts, and behavioral science. Had to unlearn a bunch of toxic hustle culture takes and relearn how productivity actually operates in a human brain, not a robot.

Here’s what helped and might work for you too:

- Productivity is not about doing more, it’s about doing less distracted. Cal Newport’s book *Deep Work* breaks this down. The brain can’t handle constant task-switching. Try blocking 90 minutes of uninterrupted time for focused work and treat it like a meeting. Don’t let your phone, Slack, or tabs mess it up.

- You’re not lazy, you’re overstimulated. Dopamine overload from scrolling kills your drive to do boring but important things. Dr. Anna Lembke’s *Dopamine Nation* explains how overstimulation leads to under-productivity. Quick fix? Do a dopamine detox for 24 hours. No phone, no sugar, no screen binging. Your brain resets surprisingly fast.

- Stop trying to rely on motivation. The *Huberman Lab Podcast* nails this: discipline comes from systems. Habits don’t form by willpower. They form by reducing friction. Put your to-do list on paper, not in your head. Set up your environment so doing the right thing is default. E.g., if you want to write in the morning, sleep with your laptop on the table, not your phone.

- Your body controls your brain. Productivity starts with sleep, movement, and food. Matthew Walker’s sleep research shows even one bad night reduces focus and memory by over 40%. If you’re tired and can’t focus, it’s not you being lazy. It’s your brain literally glitching. Fix your sleep first.

- The 3-task rule works better than any planner. From *Make Time* by Knapp & Zeratsky (former Google designers): pick 3 meaningful tasks per day, no more. Prioritize for energy, not urgency. Don’t start your day checking email or messages. Start with the one task that moves the needle.

- Your “future self” is not a different person. Behavioral scientist Katy Milkman (from Wharton) says procrastination happens because we treat our future selves like strangers. Trick your brain by making the benefits of finishing a task feel immediate. Set up a reward that hits today, not someday.

- Anxiety is often just unstructured time. When your calendar has big empty gaps, your brain fills it with dread. Structure your time even if you’re not super busy. Pomodoro method, time blocking, or even “fake meetings” with yourself help. Less freedom = more peace when you're overwhelmed.

- Movement boosts focus. Cognitive science from Stanford and University of Illinois shows that walking for 10 minutes increases creativity and attention by 60%. If you feel stuck, get up and move. Walking outside resets the brain way faster than forcing yourself to sit and “grind”.

- Phone addiction is killing your ability to focus. And it’s designed that way. Nir Eyal, author of *Indistractable*, explains how tech hijacks attention with variable reward systems. Solution: turn your phone grayscale. Use apps like Forest to gamify not using your phone. Or go full cold turkey with a digital Sabbath on weekends.

- Your identity shapes your actions. If you want to be productive, stop saying “I’m terrible with time” or “I have no discipline.” James Clear (*Atomic Habits*) says identity-based habits work better than goal-based ones. Say “I’m the kind of person who finishes what they start.” Then act like it for 2 minutes. Repeat.

- Set up “activation triggers.” Dr. BJ Fogg from Stanford talks about this in *Tiny Habits*. It’s easier to start a task if it's paired with a cue. After I pour coffee, I open my laptop. After I brush my teeth, I review tomorrow’s tasks. The smaller the starting point, the more likely you’ll start at all.

- You don’t need a system. You need a rhythm. Burnout often comes from trying to be productive *every* day. Energy isn’t linear. Build a weekly rhythm: 3 high-output days, 1 admin day, 1 creative day, 2 rest or low-load days. This works better than forcing 100% every day and crashing.

- Deadlines make you care. Self-imposed deadlines are usually ignored. But Parkinson’s Law is real: work expands to fill available time. Try public accountability. Tell a friend, post your goal, or use apps like StickK that make you pay money if you don't follow through.

- Celebrate small wins. This isn’t fluffy advice. Research from Harvard Business School (Teresa Amabile) shows that recognizing small progress is the #1 predictor of motivation. Write down or voice record 1 thing you did well that day. It rewires your brain to seek momentum, not perfection.

Too many people think lack of productivity means they’re lazy, broken, or not built for success. That’s not true. Most of us are just dealing with overstimulation, poor systems, and zero recovery.

You can rebuild your focus. You can reset your rhythm. But it has to start with understanding how your brain actually works, not what some TikTok grindset guru yells at you.

For me, first dates are just information gathering. I'm analyzing if they seem like a good person, if we have things in common, if I could see us being friends. But attraction? Sexual interest? That takes weeks or months of actually knowing someone.

Then I feel pressure to ""know"" if I'm interested after one coffee date, and I'm just... not there yet. I need TIME to develop feelings.

Does anyone else experience this? How do you handle dating when you need emotional connection first but dating culture expects immediate chemistry? I understand it can be possible.

I think I just identified that some of the what I thought liberators where actually causing issues because of salicylate. I had slightly elevated calprotectin and have Klebsiella issues and always wondered why its elevated. Well turns out I now know why some food gives me slight headache + feeling dizzy instead of the usual histamine reaction like feeling hot, sweating, nose running, GI issues etc.

I mean the reactions are not severe but I think that the salicylate is how I keep my body in constant fight or flight mode (with coffee aswell).

I can tolerate some histamine foods, which are normally a no go for histamine folks, but some salicylate stuff just hits as hard or harder as some liberators.

How common is the overlap actually with HIT? I think lot of people dont even know they have this, what do you think?",7,1761855746.0,HistamineIntolerance,3,0.9,False

1okakca,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/1okakca/i_30f_had_2_kids_in_3_years_and_my_husband_46m/,I 30F had 2 kids in 3 years and my husband 46M pushes me for more,"Me and him met a few years ago when I was working at the same company. He is Polish and I am Slovak. We in Slovakia have been some sort of outsourcing for the plant in Poland that he was leading. He always spoke down to my department because customer service it seems is very low. I knew from my boss that he said we are "" trash"". But it wasn't personal for me at that point. I did meet him face to face when he was probably ""forced"" by headquarters to come to Slovakia and meet us. He didn't even answer to my hello. not to my colleagues. He did go out for a coffee with the leader of the customer service but nothing more.

I wanted more and I moved to Poland myself internally, directly to the plant. We basically got to know each other from scratch — he had divorced recently. I was 26 and he was my ""first"" so maybe I didn't ask all the right questions out of inexperience. I don't regret marrying him, but I feel I need to address some stuff

At the plant there were like 7 layers between us. Got married in a few months

We have a daughter and a son. Our daughter is only a few months old. He barely spends any time with them, but now he wants another baby. He comes home always tired, always irritated, and he has daily conflicts with his subordinates. He doesn’t waste time with friends; when he’s not at the office or out working, he’s home with us, but he’s either sleeping or on his phone, always talking about work and stressed out. I will return to work soon, so at the plant he leads and I checked some emails, looking for key words. I found an email with a long chain and at the bottom of it was an email from him saying that all those... Sl0vaks are doing tr#sh work and he wants to get rid of them because they are all a bunch of barely out of high school ""philosophy"" students who came here to take our people's jobs.

He wants another baby and keeps pushing me for it. But I told him I am not having sex with him without birth control. For now I just don't want to do it anyway. And we were fighting one evening because he spankd our toddler. He was having a meeting with his subordinates and our son kept pulling his arm to give him milk from the fridge. Husband kept pushing him away and told him he is busy. My kid started crying, husband had to mute his mic and his image for him is everything and he said that because of this, he looked bad. And he spankd him. However he says he did not push him to the floor. It was a tantrum

We had an argument and he wanted to become intimate with me after it to make up and I didnt want and he kinda forced himself on me. He did not go until the end, he let me go though when I started screaming. He said he was not aware I dont want.

TL;DR: My husband forced himself on me and looks down on me for being Slovak",9,1761855637.0,breakingmom,3,1.0,False

Hi! My name is Stephanie! I’m 35 and live in Western Canada (Specifically - Alberta). I am hoping to make a new online friend that is fun/funny, genuine, willing/able to put effort into conversations(I will do the same!). I would prefer to chat with people around my age, or older(please no one under 30!), that is able to text/write full words lol - a bit of slang is cool, but I can’t do the whole “u” instead of “you” thing etc all the time! 

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long. 

If this interests you and you’d like to have a chat, please send me a message with a quick introduction! 

Here’s an icebreaker to help start a conversation / show me if you actually read through the post lol: what is something you are looking forward to / excited about?",3,1761855596.0,R4R30Plus,4,0.71,False

Há pouco mais de um mês, fiz um post [aqui](https://www.reddit.com/r/cafebrasil/s/byji4RIZjp) buscando dicas para melhorar a qualidade dos meus cafés. Recebi muitas recomendações valiosas e acabei entrando de vez nesse novo hobby.

Então, venho mostrar meus novos brinquedos ;)

Queria agradecer a todos que interagiram no meu post anterior. Ainda estou começando e tenho muito a aprender, mas já preparei minha primeira xícara. Foi a primeira vez que tomei café sem açúcar, e para minha surpresa, adorei a experiência! Sei que provavelmente não ficou perfeito, então gostaria de receber maiores recomendações e instruções. Minhas dúvidas principais no momento são sobre:

- Tipos de grãos para experimentar;
- Regulagem do moedor M3 Pro (essa parte achei bem confusa);
- Diferentes métodos de preparo que vocês recomendam.

Já agradeço de antemão e ansioso pra melhorar ainda mais!",7,1761855585.0,cafebrasil,3,0.9,False

Apart from ""*Cup of Roasted Coffee*"" and the other small sing-song moments Emma has, the only song that Emma sings *as Emma* is the title number. At the very start of the show... Weird... I know it can all be chalked up to suspension of disbelief and using the number as exposition for the show. But there are multiple instances that the infected can come back, with Sam after getting his head thumped in w/ the trash can lid, and most of the main and prominent side characters coming back for the final number after experiencing the explosion in the Starlight Theater.

Felt wasteful but reheating it later tastes like garbage. Last month I was too lazy to make iced coffee one afternoon and just poured my leftover morning coffee into ice cube trays. Next day I used those cubes in my iced coffee and realized it doesn't get watered down like with regular ice. Now I just do this automatically. My coffee habit was getting expensive because I'd buy iced coffee at the gas station like 3 times a week for $3 each. That's almost $40 a month I was basically throwing away when I already had coffee at home. The frozen coffee cubes thing sounds so obvious now but I genuinely never thought about it. Been doing it for a few weeks and haven't bought gas station coffee once. Small thing but having a bit of money saved up feels better than I thought it would, and my morning routine is literally the same as before. My girlfriend thinks I'm weird for getting excited about coffee ice cubes but honestly this is the kind of stuff that adds up.",14,1761855327.0,Frugal,6,0.9,False

1okaeka,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bangkok/comments/1okaeka/30_real_scams_happening_in_thailand_right_now/,30 real scams happening in Thailand right now,"Thailand’s a dream for a lot of people. The food, the beaches, the chaos. It’s intoxicating. But the scams aren’t just anecdotal, they’ve happened to many people, including friends, myself and maybe even you.

Many of them are happening in over drive in the city of Bangkok. It is what it is.... and to be honest, a lot of these scams happen around the world, not just Thailand or Bangkok.

Also, this isn’t intended to smear Thailand. I truly love Thailand but you need to have to know a few things before you show up. Its wild how many people post about obvious scams in this sub. 

Here are 30 real scams happening in Thailand right now.

1. Overhead Luggage Theft (Airplane Scam) - you are at risk, even before you land.

Especially, if you’re coming from other Asian countries, this could happen before you even land. You’re tired, crammed in economy, and just want to survive the flight. That’s when a guy with nerves of steel and a carry-on plan of attack helps himself to your overhead stash while you’re dozing off.

Avoid it: Don’t stash the gold in the bin. Keep it at your feet. Thieves love trust and naive travelers.

2. Fake Arrival Card Websites
Imagine Googling ""Thailand arrival card"" and landing on a site that looks like it was built by government interns. It’s not. It’s a well-dressed thief with a payment gateway.

Avoid it: Only trust sites ending in .go.th. If they’re asking for money for a free form, maybe get off that site. Just sayin’

3. Songthaew ""Private Charter"" Trick
You're standing on the side of the road, being polite, respectful. You flag down a red songthaew (those pickup trucks with benches in the back) and ask the driver, ""Do you go to Big C?""

At this point, you've unknowingly stepped into a trap. By asking a direct question, especially in English or broken Thai, the driver now frames this as a private charter request, not a hop-on public fare. So instead of the usual ฿20–฿30 shared ride, you get hit with a ฿300–฿500 quote.

Congratulations, you just played yourself.

Avoid it: Just get on. Don’t ask questions. Locals don’t. Do what they do.

4. Fake Motorbike Theft
This one hurts. You rent the bike, park it by your hotel, and the shop steals it with a spare key. They act surprised. They hand you the bill. You contemplate rage or tears.

Avoid it: Rent from places with real contracts and a Google presence.

5. Phantom Accident Scheme
Your phone buzzes. A guy says you hit his car. You didn’t. But now the shop wants you to settle before the “police” arrive.

Avoid it: Ask for photos. Demand evidence. Say the word ""embassy"" and watch them flinch.

6. Overcharged Fake Damage
Return the scooter and suddenly you’re being charged for every scratch, dent, and possibly a missing screw from 1998.

Avoid it: Take pictures. Document. Be annoying.

7. Fake Fashion Goods at Tourist Markets
If you fall for this one, you deserve it. Do you really think street vendors or shops around tourist sites are selling real brand items? Get real!

Avoid it: Don’t expect brand names from a guy selling belts next to fried squid.

8. Counterfeit Electronics
You scored a deal on a phone. Turns out it’s a Frankenstein of recycled parts. What did you expect?

Avoid it: Only buy from real stores. If it’s outdoors and doesn’t have a receipt printer, walk away.

9. Parts Swap at Repair Shops
You needed a quick fix. You got downgraded by someone with a screwdriver and no conscience.

Avoid it: Chain stores. Stand there. Breathe down their necks.

10. Fake Art Dealer Scam
They’ll tell you it’s one of a kind. They’re right… it’s one of 10,000. Seriously, you’ll see the same paintings around the country. They aren’t even that bad. The first time you see them, it might make you consider pulling out some baht. We did. But eventually, you’ll spot the formulaic templates and be happy you didn’t.

Avoid it: If it looks too polished, it came from a factory, not a painter.

11. Overpriced Taxi/Tuk Tuk Tours
You say yes to a “tour” and suddenly you’re being paraded past souvenir shops with commission tags.

Avoid it: If you didn’t ask for a tour, don’t take one.

12. Bus Van Detour Tour Room Scam
Your van stops. You’re taken inside. Suddenly, people with clipboards are upselling you on temples and tigers.

Avoid it: If you are a passive person, pretend you already booked everything. Maybe fake a phone call. Use your best actor face. If you’re more confrontational, call them out… or just avoid getting in this mess to begin with.

13. Street Exchange Hustlers
A guy says he’s stuck. Needs baht. Offers a killer rate. You get play money. He gets lunch.
Avoid it: Exchange only at booths. Never from a guy with an urgent backstory. Don’t trust anyone, anywhere… not just in Thailand. Don’t be such a sucker. Gawd.

14. Miracle Acne Cure Salesmen
You’re told your face can be fixed. All it takes is one cream and some blind faith. The truth is you’re just a mess and nobody can ever fix it. Especially not with some magic cream.

Avoid it: Nobody on the street can fix your skin... or your life.

15. Currency Sleight-of-Hand Trick
He asks to see your dollars. You hand it over. He does some Vegas stuff. You leave lighter.

Avoid it: Your money stays in your hands, guys. Pretty simple.

16. Friendly Stranger Approach
You chat. You bond. He invites you somewhere. You walk in and now you owe someone 1,500 baht for iced tea.

Avoid it: Kindness is nice. But this isn’t kindness. It is a setup. Didn’t your parents teach you not to go with strangers? It still applies as an adult, champ.

17. Phone Theft Followed by Phishing
This scam blends pick‑pocketing with phishing: a thief lifts your phone, then texts or calls you pretending to be Apple Support (or a “service center”) to say your device has been found. The crook’s real goal is to get you to log in to a fake iCloud site or remove the handset from your account so they can bypass Apple’s Activation Lock and resell it.

Don’t fall for it! Apple will never ask you to disable security features. Mark your phone as lost, remote‑erase it and leave it on your account, and ignore any texts or calls urging you to click a link or unlock the device

Avoid it: Secure your cloud. Never click on mystery links. C’mon, guys! We are better than this.

18. Fake Rescue Texts
""Send 3,000 baht and we’ll return your phone."" They won’t. But you’ll be poorer.

Avoid it: Don’t negotiate with phone-nappers. Move on.

19. Fake Restaurant Invite Scam
""Just a coffee,"" they said. But now there’s a fish platter and a bill that makes you sweat.

Avoid it: Pick the place. Always.

20. Date Drug Setup
That Tinder date seemed amazing. So did your drink. Until it didn’t.

Avoid it: Watch your drink. Meet in public. If it feels fast, it’s a setup.

21. Kidnapping by Job Scam
That job offer online? Turns out it’s a ticket to a scam center across the border. I mean, if the situation seems too good to be true maybe consider living in reality?

Avoid it: If they ask for your passport before you’ve met them, run.

22. Scammy SIM Card Registration = Call Center Spam
Get a SIM. Get a call. Now you’re being told your package is illegal.

Avoid it: Ignore calls from unknowns. Or develop a Thai accent and prank them back

OR just live in the now and get an e-sim. If I was getting paid, I'd put an affiliate link here.

23. Fake Job Interview Pay-to-Play

""We just need a processing fee."" Then the office disappears like your common sense.

Avoid it: Real jobs pay you. Not the other way around.

24. Romance Investment Scams
They fall in love fast. Then ask you to invest. Not in crypto. In a water buffalo! C'mon boys. Not every girl has a sick water buffalo at home. Be real!

Avoid it: Love that asks for money is a transaction. I can't think of the word but I think it rhymes with trostitutes.

25. Fake Expat Mentor
He’s cool. Wise. Then he asks for a “favor.” Or $500.

Avoid it: Real mentors don’t pitch you. Just stick to our platform and you’ll be fine.

26. Fake Condo Listings
The condo you booked? Doesn’t exist. Or is now a chicken shop.

Avoid it: See it first. Or book through platforms with actual humans behind them.

27. Fake Visa/Relocation Agencies
Looks legit. Slick website. But once you pay, your visa and your dignity vanish.

Avoid it: Reviews. Forums. Skepticism.

28. Bait-and-Switch Condos
Photos were dreamy. Reality is moldy.

Avoid it: Demand refund policies. And trust your nose.

29. Facebook Marketplace Scams
Seller’s “abroad.” Wants a deposit. You send it. Crickets.
Avoid it: No meet, no money.

30. Fake Land Titles
You buy a home. So do three other people. Oops.

Avoid it: Land Office. Lawyer. Patience.

She is very independent and a lot of their fights are about money. I think that will be easily fixed. It looks like Matthew teleworks? So if their new apartment is too remote, they need to pick a place they are both happy with. Greta is clear she wants a walkable or public transportation doable commute to coffee and grocery stores.

I’m into cozy games, anime recs, shared playlists, museum strolls, coffee walks, book or study tips, and trading sunset pics during breaks. Zero dating, zero selling, privacy and respect first.
