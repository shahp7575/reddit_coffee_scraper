Tried dialing in with no success - what am I doing wrong? please help,"Got a new BBE for Christmas and finally got around to dialing in. completely new to this. Having done some initial research - out of the box I set my internal burr to 3. 

Working with a medium roast bag of beans I started first with 7 on the outer dial, 9 and then 10. 

NONE of these settings gave me any coffee. I pulled the shot using the double shot and no water or coffee came out. 

I initially thought there was something really wrong with the machine so ran the machine without portafilter - single and double shot. Water flowed normally. Next I ran a single and double shot with the portafilter in and no coffee. Water flowed fine. 

I also tried manual mode. Held the double shot for a long time until the machine cut the flow itself. Pulled some coffee at 10 grind setting and little to no coffee at 7. 

I have more success with coffee flowing when it’s the second and third time I pull a shot with the SAME filled basket (meaning I did not fill the basket with new grinds). 

Can you help me figure out what is wrong? Is this a pressure issue or a grind size issue or both? ",1,1768032872.0,baristaexpress,0,1.0,False

1q8yhqj,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialBlueprint/comments/1q8yhqj/how_to_instantly_look_more_competent_by_showing/,How to Instantly Look MORE Competent by Showing Your Flaws (The PRATFALL Effect Explained),"okay so i spent way too much time reading research papers and psychology books trying to figure out why some people just command respect effortlessly while others try so hard and fall flat. turns out there's this wild psychological phenomenon called the pratfall effect that basically flips everything we think we know about authority on its head.

most people think you need to be perfect to be respected. hide mistakes. never show weakness. project this flawless image. but the research shows the exact opposite. people actually trust and respect you MORE when you reveal carefully chosen flaws. mind blowing right?

i first came across this in elliot aronson's study from 1966 (yeah it's old but the findings are insanely relevant). he had subjects listen to recordings of quiz contestants. the high performing contestant who spilled coffee on himself was rated MORE likeable than the same contestant who didn't spill anything. but here's the kicker, when a low performing contestant spilled coffee, his ratings dropped even further. so the effect only works when you're already demonstrating competence.

the psychology behind it is actually pretty straightforward. perfect people are intimidating and hard to relate to. when someone competent shows a humanizing flaw, it breaks down that barrier and makes them approachable without undermining their expertise. you're still the expert, you're just not a robot about it.

here's how to actually use this:

establish competence FIRST before revealing any vulnerabilities. this is non negotiable. you can't lead with your flaws and expect people to follow you. demonstrate your knowledge, show your track record, prove you know what you're talking about. once that foundation is solid, then you can afford to be human. i see so many people jump straight to the self deprecating humor without ever establishing why anyone should listen to them. that's just shooting yourself in the foot.

strategic vulnerability beats random oversharing every time. this isn't about trauma dumping or complaining about how hard your life is. pick flaws that are either irrelevant to your core competence or that you've already overcome. a finance expert can joke about being terrible at cooking. a public speaker can mention they used to have crippling stage fright (past tense). the vulnerability needs to humanize you without making people question your ability.

adam grant talks about this brilliantly in his podcast worklife. he interviewed leaders who shared mistakes they made early in their careers but framed them as learning experiences. not current incompetence, but past struggles that led to present mastery. that's the sweet spot.

timing matters more than you think. don't open with your flaws. don't close with them either. the research suggests the middle of an interaction is optimal. you've already demonstrated value, but there's still time for the increased likability to pay dividends. in a presentation, this might be 15 minutes in. in a job interview, maybe the second or third question. in writing, definitely not the introduction.

the flaw should be relatable and minor. spilling coffee works. being chronically late doesn't. forgetting someone's name occasionally is fine. forgetting basic professional responsibilities isn't. the goal is ""oh they're human like me"" not ""oh they're a mess i can't trust them."" 

i've been using this in my own life and the difference is honestly shocking. started admitting when i don't know something instead of bluffing my way through. ""great question, i'm not sure but let me find out"" gets way better responses than trying to fake expertise. people respect the honesty.

brené brown's book daring greatly is genuinely one of the best deep dives into vulnerability as strength. she's a research professor who spent decades studying shame and courage. the book completely dismantles the myth that vulnerability equals weakness. her ted talk has like 60 million views for a reason. she explains how leaders who admit uncertainty and mistakes create cultures of trust and innovation. it's backed by tons of organizational psychology research.

there's also this personalized learning app called BeFreed that pulls from high quality sources like research papers, expert talks, and books to create custom audio podcasts on topics you want to master. built by a team from columbia university, it generates learning plans tailored to your specific goals and challenges. you can adjust the depth from a quick 10 minute overview to a 40 minute deep dive with examples, and pick voices that match your mood, everything from calm and soothing to more energetic styles. useful for fitting learning into commutes or workouts without the usual doomscrolling.

robert cialdini covers this in pre suasion too (he's literally THE authority on influence and persuasion). he talks about how strategic self disclosure creates reciprocal trust. when you reveal something personal, others feel psychologically compelled to lower their guard and trust you more. it's one of the most powerful influence techniques that feels completely natural when done right.

the neuroscience backs this up btw. when we perceive someone as ""perfect"" our brains actually create distance. we categorize them as other. but when they show relatable human qualities, mirror neurons fire and we unconsciously see ourselves in them. that neurological connection is what transforms respect into genuine authority.

don't confuse this with false modesty though. people can smell that from a mile away. ""oh i'm terrible at this"" when you're clearly skilled just comes off as fishing for compliments. authentic admission of actual minor flaws hits completely different than performative humility.

the pratfall effect also explains why some of the most magnetic people you know probably have this slightly messy quality about them. they're brilliant at what they do but they'll also tell you about the ridiculous mistake they made last week. that combination is irresistible because it gives permission for others to be imperfect too.

social media has made this even more relevant. everyone's curating these highlight reels of their lives and it's exhausting. the accounts that show behind the scenes struggles while still delivering value? those are the ones people actually connect with. not the carefully filtered perfection.

try this experiment. next time you're in a position where you want to build credibility, establish your competence clearly, then share one small humanizing detail or minor past mistake. watch how the energy in the room shifts. people lean in instead of keeping that professional distance.

the pratfall effect is basically permission to stop pretending you're perfect while still being taken seriously. that's powerful. you get authority without the exhausting performance of flawlessness. and honestly, that's way more sustainable long term than trying to maintain some impossible standard.

Super LSS! Anyway

Hi! I am looking for new people to become friends with. I prefer hanging out to calls and chatting! I'm open to join groups as well. Travel, tambay, count me in! 

about me:
28, 5'11, introvert, working, I don't drink, I don't smoke, single

I am very into music and guitar.

I love traveling. I've been to Cebu, Bangkok, Hong Kong, and hopefully ma-approve ang visa for Japan. I enjoyed outdoor and extreme activities sa Cebu pero more on chill, strolling and taking pictures of places talaga ako. Tikim tikim din ng food kung saan man mapunta. If you'll ask me kung anong favorite chinese food ko, sasagutin kita ng siomai.

I love movies about life, love, relationships, romcom, or anything I find interesting. Before trilogy, Her, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, 500 days of summer, 50 first dates, prisoners, dami pa.

I love romanticizing road trips, city lights. Usually hindi mo ako makakausap kasi naka-earphones ako. But don't get me wrong, I love having conversations lalo na kapag interested ako sa iyo. I ask a lot of questions pero minsan I just listen din. Depende talaga.

I try to push myself to run every now and then lalo na kapag may iniisip. Helps me clear my mind.

I'm not that maligalig type of person but I guess it depends on the chemistry. I almost forgot the most important thing, I love iced coffee.

Ugggh this sucks.

Backstory: We loved each other deeply in our late teens early twenties. Went through a horrible breakup because we both went to uni and long distance didn't work. Kept in contact and nice terms because we clearly loved each other. Last month we started talking to each other again.

This was 4 years after the break up. We were both in different countries and we liked the company too much. We decided to come back home for the holidays, and we met for lunch. 

I've realized she's good for me and it's actually been so nice having her be a part of my life again. Until it got to the time to go our seperate ways, it was nice. Now, we got into a weird lil fight where she said she didn't have time to say bye, and i got emotional and offered to stop talking. 

Tiny overreaction in both our words, but apparently this feeling took us both back to the fights we had when we broke up. We're meeting for coffee tomorrow, and the vibe is not good right now lol i want the earth to just swallow me ATP.

We're gonna stay cordial, and we're gonna say goodbye and I think this is it. I think this is where we stop talking again, and it's crushing me. This feels all too familiar and if i could just go back to not feeling this way about her, I'd love to. 

But we're at an inevitable standstill right now. It's back to a very light version of old attachment habits, and this has activated a shittonne of PTSD for both us, we got emotional and fought yesterday.

Idk what to say or think about the meeting tomorrow morning. Do i rant and be honest, or do i let her have all the say and then agree and thank her for being so nice?

My instinct tells me to do the former and tell her what i feel and be honest and rant. But my gut feeling tells me that I'll be happier if i just let things be, and only stick to the positive parts.

Yeah, i think I'll try my best to play it cool and not let it devolve into an emotional mess. It's not good for either of us, and I'd rather keep things open Incase i move to  Europe or smth. Which is something I'm planning for different reasons.

I don't like it when I feel this way, i don't like making her feel bad about me. I HATE it when we're not on good terms.

2. Who and where should I look for internships? I look at LinkedIn for most of the internships and coming to my networking skills, I would say they r super bad. I am awkward and shy af … so I don’t even know how to hold a coffee chat.

hey everyone, i’ve been looking into ways to make our business district properties more of a destination, you know, get more people walking around and actually coming in the doors. figured i’d share a few things i found that seem like way smart moves.  
  
first, we gotta talk about getting people there in the first place, and honestly, parking is chaos in a lot of business districts. if your property has any extra space, like an unused driveway or garage spot, you should list it on prked. it's a super simple app where you can rent out your spot to people coming into the area. this brings more shoppers and workers to the block because they can skip the parking meter lines and get a cheaper, more convenient spot. for a property owner, it's easy passive income, and for the visitors, they feel safer knowing their car is on someone's property. it’s a big win-win for getting people to stop instead of just driving through.  
  
for the building itself, curb appeal is huge. i'm talking about sparkling windows, no litter, and a fresh look. change your window displays often, like every few weeks, to grab attention from the street. use bright colors and unique props to make people slow down and look.  
  
then you have to give them a reason to stay. hosting events is massive for foot traffic. think community workshops, like a free coffee tasting or a flower arranging class if you have a florist nearby. or team up with your neighboring businesses for a sidewalk sale or a ""block party"" event. make it an experience.  
  
don't forget the online stuff, which totally drives in-person visits. make sure your google business profile is 100 percent up to date with correct hours and good photos. encourage customers to leave reviews. use social media to tease new arrivals or a limited-time sale that's only available in-store, which creates that fomo feeling. and use geotags on all your posts so people nearby can find you when they search.  
  
a lot of the research also points to using a vacant storefront for ""activation."" this means turning an empty space into something exciting like a pop-up shop for a local artist or a temporary themed experience. this immediately brightens up a dead spot and makes the whole district feel more vibrant and active.  
  
i hope this helps some of us brainstorm ways to get more people through our business district.",1,1768030839.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

hey all, i figured i'd share some ideas since it sounds like you're sitting on a little goldmine of unused commercial space. don't let that extra land just be dead grass or asphalt, you can make it a passive income stream pretty easily.  
  
first, if you have any extra parking lot or just a big gravel area that's empty most of the time, you absolutely need to check out prked. it's an app where you can list your unused driveway or commercial lot spaces for people to rent by the hour, day, or month. people are always looking for cheaper and more convenient parking than the big city garages, and they feel safer parking on someone's property. for you, it's super easy passive income—just list the spots, set your own schedule and price, and the app handles all the payments and customers.  
  
beyond parking, there are a bunch of other short-term options that keep your land flexible for future development or business needs.  
  
you could rent out the land for commercial storage. think of it as a temporary self-storage lot. people need space to park their boats, rvs, or work trailers during the off-season. you can even put a few empty shipping containers (sometimes called ccans) on the property and rent those out as secure, cheap storage units. this is especially big for small businesses that need to store inventory or equipment but can't afford a huge warehouse.  
  
pop-up shops and seasonal vendors are another great idea. is there a lot of foot traffic? you could lease a small section to food trucks, a coffee stand, or a christmas tree/fireworks stand during the holidays. it's short-term revenue that also brings more people to your main business.  
  
if the land is more rural, some people do short-term ground leases to big companies who want to put up a temporary drive-thru location or even a digital billboard for signage. others have leased land for things like urban gardens or even a fenced area for a dog park for a local pet business. if you're near a big venue, you could also make a one-off rental deal for event overflow parking.  
  
always check your local zoning laws before you do anything, but the short-term rental market for unused commercial space is huge right now. it's a perfect way to make money from an asset you're not even using.  
  
hope this helps you turn that extra space into some serious passive income.",1,1768030325.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False
1q8xxct,https://www.reddit.com/r/puppy101/comments/1q8xxct/help_i_overwhelmed_my_puppy/,Help I overwhelmed my puppy,"I have a working line black lab puppy - he's 13 weeks, super intelligent and very loving. He's always been very affectionate towards women and slightly reserved towards men but as soon as they are friendly he gains trust pretty quick. 

On our puppy training session at 12 weeks the instructor told us to take them out experience the world etc.. I took him to a coffee shop for his first outing, the door was closed and I didn't see how busy it was from the outside. Super busy inside. He did well at first with two women that stroked him but then loads of people big men came up behind him stroking him and I could see he was getting anxious so we left. 

  
It was a pretty tiring day for him and that evening I had two family members come over to meet him. I know I should have told them not to come as he had enough that day but I didn't expect how my family members would interact with him. They came in approached him from behind on all fours and got in his face terrifying him. I told them to move away and sit down, ignore him. Then one got up to pick up her vape as she walked past him she put his hand in his face and he jumped and barked at her. 

Cut forward a day later someone at work went to greet him - I said please don't touch him just ignore him and same thing - pup was interested went over and then the man got down on his heels and put his hand out so pup jumped back and barked.

  
He's so affectionate with me and my partner but I'm worried now this experience has shaped him for life - he was such a bold and friendly pup. I know it's my fault entirely I didn't put him in safe situations and I didn't manage people quick enough with boundaries. 

My plan going forward is to only allow people in my close circle to greet him with him going to them and they can use a high value treat so he has good experiences. 

  
I also feel anxious about people's reactions now which I know is going to add to the whole tension of it which he will pick up on. But people don't listen when you say don't touch him or they just stare him in the eyes. He's bloody cute it is hard not to gravitate towards him!

1q8xwnv,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConnectBetter/comments/1q8xwnv/how_to_be_unforgettable_the_science_of_emotional/,How to Be UNFORGETTABLE: The Science of Emotional Impact That Actually Works,"Let me hit you with something wild: most people you meet will forget you in about 24 hours. Not because you're boring, but because our brains are wired to filter out the mundane. We're drowning in faces, names, and small talk. But some people? They stick. They leave a mark. They become unforgettable.

I spent months diving into research on memory, neuroscience, and human connection (books, podcasts, psychology papers, the whole deal) because I wanted to crack this code. Turns out, being memorable isn't about being loud or trying too hard. It's about creating emotional impact. When you trigger emotions in people, you literally change their brain chemistry. Their amygdala fires up, cortisol or oxytocin gets released, and boom, you're encoded into their long term memory.

The best part? This isn't manipulation or some fake charisma bullshit. It's about genuine connection and understanding how humans actually work. Here's what I learned.

## Step 1: Stop trying to impress people

This sounds backwards but hear me out. When you're trying to impress someone, you're performing. You're focused on yourself, your words, how you look. People can smell that desperation from a mile away.

Instead, make them feel something. The neuroscientist Antonio Damasio found that emotions are the core of decision making and memory formation. People won't remember what you said, but they'll remember how you made them feel. Cliche? Maybe. But it's backed by decades of research.

Practical moves:

* Ask questions that actually matter. Not ""what do you do?"" but ""what's been taking up most of your headspace lately?"" or ""what's something you're weirdly passionate about?""
* Listen like you give a damn. Put your phone away. Make eye contact. Nod. React. Show that their words are landing.
* Share something real about yourself, not just surface level stuff. Vulnerability creates connection.

## Step 2: Be the anomaly, break patterns

Our brains are prediction machines. They love patterns because patterns save energy. But when something breaks the pattern? That's when attention spikes. That's when memories form.

Think about it. You remember the weird professor who taught class in costume. The friend who texted you at 3am with a random life question. The stranger who complimented something specific about you, not just ""nice shirt.""

The book ""Made to Stick"" by Chip and Dan Heath breaks this down beautifully. They call it the ""unexpectedness principle."" When you violate expectations in a positive way, you become sticky in people's minds. This book is insanely good at explaining why some ideas (and people) stick while others fade. It's based on years of research into memorable communication.

How to apply this:

* Do something slightly unexpected in conversations. If everyone's complaining about Monday, talk about what you're genuinely excited about.
* Send voice notes instead of texts sometimes. It's more personal and catches people off guard.
* Remember tiny details people mention and bring them up later. ""Hey, did your sister's interview go well?"" That specificity hits different.

## Step 3: Create peak moments

Daniel Kahneman won a Nobel Prize for his work on memory and experience. His research shows we don't remember experiences as a whole, we remember peaks (the best or worst moments) and endings. This is called the peak end rule.

If you want to be unforgettable, you need to create peak moments with people. Not every interaction needs to be profound, but sprinkle in moments that spike emotions, good or bad (preferably good, obviously).

Try this:

* End conversations on a high note. Don't let things fizzle out. Leave them with a laugh, a thought provoking question, or genuine enthusiasm.
* Do small unexpected things. Buy someone their coffee when they're not looking. Send an article that made you think of them. Show up when they need help.
* Be present during important moments. If someone's celebrating or struggling, be ALL there. No half assed attention.

## Step 4: Tell stories that hit the feels

Facts tell, stories sell. But more importantly, stories stick. Your brain processes stories differently than random information. When you hear a good story, your brain releases oxytocin (the bonding hormone) and multiple regions light up. You're not just listening, you're experiencing.

""The Storytelling Animal"" by Jonathan Gottschall dives deep into why humans are wired for narrative. We've been telling stories around fires for thousands of years. It's how we make sense of the world and connect with each other. This book will make you question everything you think you know about human communication.

Make your stories work:

* Use sensory details. Don't just say ""I was nervous."" Say ""my hands were shaking and I could feel my heartbeat in my throat.""
* Have a point. Stories without a takeaway or emotion are just rambling.
* Make it about them, not you. Frame your stories so the listener sees themselves in it or learns something they can use.

## Step 5: Master the art of presence

This is the hardest one but the most powerful. Most people are physically present but mentally elsewhere. They're thinking about their next meeting, what to say next, or scrolling through mental to do lists.

When you give someone your full, undivided attention, it's like a drug. They feel seen. They feel valued. Research from Harvard shows that people spend 47% of their waking hours thinking about something other than what they're doing. When you're that rare person who's actually THERE? You stand out.

Tools that help:

* Try the Headspace app for mindfulness training. Being present is a skill you can practice. It teaches you to quiet the mental noise and focus on the now.

* BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app that turns high quality book summaries, research papers, and expert talks into personalized audio content based on what you want to learn. Built by a team from Columbia University, it pulls from verified sources to create custom podcasts tailored to your goals.

What makes it useful here is the adaptive learning plan feature. You can tell it you're working on social skills or presence, and it'll build a structured plan pulling from multiple sources. You customize the depth too, anywhere from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples and context. Plus there's a virtual coach called Freedia that you can chat with mid-podcast if something clicks and you want to explore it further. For anyone serious about continuous growth without the overwhelm, it's worth checking out.

* Put your phone on Do Not Disturb during conversations. Seriously. The mere presence of a phone on the table reduces conversation quality (actual research from the University of Essex).
* Practice active listening. Repeat back what you heard. ""So what you're saying is..."" It shows you're processing, not just waiting to talk.

## Step 6: Show up consistently

One amazing interaction won't make you unforgettable long term. Consistency does. The mere exposure effect (researched by Robert Zajonc) shows that people develop preferences for things simply because they're familiar with them.

But here's the key: consistent doesn't mean boring. It means reliably being that person who brings energy, authenticity, or support.

Consistency moves:

* Check in on people without needing something. ""Thinking of you"" texts hit different.
* Show up to things you said you'd show up to. Reliability is sexy.
* Be consistent in your values and how you treat people. Trust builds over time.

## Step 7: Leave them better than you found them

This is the ultimate move. Every interaction should leave the other person feeling slightly better about themselves or their day. Not in some fake toxic positivity way, but genuinely.

""The Charisma Myth"" by Olivia Fox Cabane breaks down how charismatic people make others feel powerful and valued. It's not about the charismatic person being impressive, it's about making others feel good in their presence. The book is full of science backed techniques on presence, power, and warmth. Best charisma book I've ever read, hands down.

Final moves:

* Compliment specifics, not generics. ""You explained that really clearly"" beats ""you're smart.""
* Celebrate people's wins genuinely. No jealousy, no comparison. Pure hype.
* Offer value without expecting anything back. Share knowledge, make introductions, give help freely.

Look, becoming unforgettable isn't about performing or putting on a show. It's about tapping into what makes us human: emotions, stories, connection, presence. The science is clear. When you trigger positive emotions and make people feel valued, you literally rewire their brains to remember you.

Most people sleepwalk through interactions. Be the person who wakes them up. Be the anomaly. Create those peak moments. And watch how quickly you become someone people can't forget.",2,1768030179.0,ConnectBetter,0,1.0,False

1q8xuc8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q8xuc8,My vintage Jordan 1 Chicago Premium project,"Let me start by clearing a few things up.

My goal with this pair was not to create another over-exaggerated “aged custom.” We’ve all seen that look. Personally, I find the Lost & Found execution theatrical, and this entire project was about avoiding that aesthetic.

What I was aiming for instead was a 1985-accurate, lightly worn, well-stored pair. That’s it. Aging sneakers—just like people—varies wildly depending on conditions. Accuracy is only achievable up to a certain point; after that, real time and wear take over. I’m comfortable stopping where authenticity stops and nature takes the wheel.

Here’s what I did.

I started by tea-aging the laces that came already tied in the shoes. Subtle, controlled, nothing dramatic.

For the midsoles, I used Foxtrot Uniform Sail stainer. Two light sessions, letting it cure for about 1–2 minutes each time, then wiping clean without rubbing alcohol. The goal was a soft off-white patina—not sail, not yellow. Overly yellow soles immediately scream “custom,” and that was never the goal.

Next were the tongues and tags. I used green tea, not black tea. Black tea creates a coffee-dyed, orange tone (again—Lost & Found). I wanted that natural off-white you see on DS or well-stored pairs from the era, not yellowed tongues.

After that, I focused on the uppers. I used a buffing method to knock down as much of the factory sheen as possible. It’s not perfect, but it’s a huge improvement over that glossy, out-of-box reflection. I chose this approach because it’s safe and doesn’t strip the protective coating that prevents red bleed. We’ve all seen what happens when that coating is gone. Nike absolutely missed the mark there.

Finally, I aged the ankle collars. The goal was to expose that beautiful raw leather patina you see on real vintage pairs. I focused on non-uniformity, because real aging is never clean or even. Some will say it doesn’t look natural. I can confidently say it does—especially in hand and on foot.

All things considered, these Premiums are the best Jordan 1 Chicago I’ve ever handled. People will argue VRL had a more accurate shape, and that’s fair—but they missed the most important part: process and materials. Nike hasn’t used this leather or construction method on AJ1s since the ’90s. Boring and his team gave us a genuinely period-accurate canvas. What we do with it is up to us.

Unless you’ve got a time machine—and if you’re reading this, you probably don’t—this is as close as it gets. Buy them. Wear them. Customize them. Beat them up. These are the closest thing to a true 1985 retro we’re likely to see.
Some of you will hate them. Some will say I ruined them. Some will say they don’t look natural. That’s fine. They’re my pair, and I plan to wear them until I can’t anymore—or I’m six feet under.

figured i'd share a few ideas if you own property close to the alumni center. everyone always focuses on student rentals but there is a totally different money stream from the university events they hold there all the time.  
  
first up is the low hanging fruit, parking. all those conferences, weddings, career fairs, and especially the big football/basketball game days bring in hundreds of people who dont have an easy place to park. you could easily list your unused driveway or garage on an app like prked. its a simple way to make passive income because people pay you to use your space for a few hours or a day. for the parker, its way cheaper than campus garages and usually closer, plus they feel safer parking on someones property. super easy to set your own price and schedule on the app, and you can make quick money on event weekends.  
  
for your house itself, short term rentals are the big opportunity. the alumni center hosts tons of events like graduations, alumni weekends, galas, and speaker series. these people are not students, they are alumni, parents, and visiting professionals who are willing to pay a premium for a nice place that is right next to the event. you can make a lot more in a few peak weekends like graduation and homecoming than you would with a regular monthly lease. think about renting out a room for visiting faculty or speakers too, since they sometimes need a place for a week or two.  
  
beyond just renting space, think about services. the center holds career fairs so maybe offer a quick resume printing service or a mobile coffee/snack station on a high traffic day. for weddings and galas, offer a premium car detailing service for the guests car while they are inside, or maybe even a luxury shuttle service if your property is on a main road.  
  
you could even rent out your backyard or a large common room for a pre-event space. people love to have a tailgate or a private reception before a big gala or game watch party. check the alumni center's event calendar regularly so you can time your listings and services perfectly.  
  
hope this helps you figure out the best way to capitalize on your location.",1,1768029931.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

Phones didn’t come with generous data plans. Laptops were heavy. And if you were trying to send an email, sync files, or just connect to the wider world, Wi-Fi wasn’t background—it was the destination.

Today, in 2026, it’s almost impossible to find a place where you can’t connect. Wi-Fi has become part of the atmosphere—so seamlessly embedded in homes, cars, planes, and even rest areas that it’s easy to forget the profound shift we’ve lived through. It’s not just about the internet; it’s about how presence and absence have inverted. Once, you went to the internet. Now, it travels with you. You don’t look for it. It finds you.

We’ve moved from Wi-Fi 4 to Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 in just over a decade. That’s not just faster speeds—it’s smarter networking, lower latency, multi-device stability, and an invisible choreography between all our tools. Add Bluetooth to the mix, and we’ve entered an age of ambient connection. Our phones, watches, speakers, thermostats, tablets, and even cars are in silent conversation with each other, constantly updating, syncing, learning.

But what’s most striking isn’t the tech itself—it’s how human behavior has adapted. The metaphor of Wi-Fi reaches into deeper places. It’s the unseen thread, the always-there link. It reflects how we’ve become used to touching the intangible. Think about tap-to-pay: you walk up, tap your phone, hear a chime, and walk away. No coins. No signing. No handshake. Just trust, signal, confirmation, exit.

And this transformation has happened quietly. While we debated AI and argued about privacy, a different kind of revolution wrapped itself around us—not loud, not dramatic, but total. The same rest stops where we once read paperback books by dome light are now pulsing with wireless signal. Some of us still remember reading The God Particle by Leon Lederman, parked under a sodium lamp, wondering if we’d ever see the inside of CERN. And when we did, maybe the only thing open was the gift shop—but the resonance stayed.

The Wi-Fi era isn’t just about connectivity. It’s about presence. It’s about how the infrastructure of attention has changed. And it raises the question: what are we really connecting to?

Because if everything is reachable, if all knowledge is one breath away—then the frontier isn’t finding signal.

It’s learning when to unplug.",1,1768029837.0,WRXingaround,0,1.0,False

1q8xsjb,https://i.redd.it/l41fyb4jygcg1.jpeg,Akro Awake: Smelling Like a High Functioning Addict,"In 2018, Olivier Cresp, the man who essentially invented the modern gourmand genre, decided it was time to bottle our vices. With his daughter Anais, he launched a niche house called Akro, built around one simple concept - **Addictions.**  
  
They covered weed (Haze), sex (Night), booze (Malt) and chocolate (Dark).  
  
Then in 2019 came the single most important addiction of all time, the only addiction holding modern civilisation together - caffeine.

Enter **Akro Awake -** a tribute to the bitter black fuel that kickstarts the global economy every single morning.

Akro does not do velvet pouches, gold embossing or magnetic caps. The bottle arrives inside what looks like a tiffin box. A literal tin tiffin box. The bottle inside is a sleek slab of glass with stark, utilitarian typography and feels solid in the hand. The liquid is pale yellow, the atomiser works and it sprays stuff. It’s functional. Try to contain your excitement.  

Go look at Fragrantica if you want a chemistry lesson. Here's what I get.

If you are expecting a Starbucks caramel macchiato drowning in high-fructose corn syrup, stop reading and go buy a celebrity fragrance. This isn't that.  

Akro Awake opens with a hyper-realistic Santos coffee note. It’s dark roasted, nutty, oily and bitter. It smells exactly like sticking your head inside your overpriced Comandante grinder after a spin of beans.

What immediately follows is a sharp hit of citrus that is more acidic bite of an espresso than the lemon/lime. It gives the opening a nervous, electric edge. For non-coffee muggles, the citrus smells like a failing lead-acid battery. Delicious. 

About 5-10 minutes in, the initial blast of raw coffee settles. The battery-acid lemon fades out and a blend of cold spices like mace and green cardamom takes over. This is where the fragrance stops smelling like a spilt drink and starts smelling like a perfume. The spices add earthy warmth and bridge the gap between edible and wearable. 

Hours later, Awake settles into a grounded vetiver note that's dry and earthy. There is a distinct nuttiness, particularly reminiscent of dried pumpkin seeds (did not expect that, but here we are).  And yes, there’s also that familiar modern synthetic woodiness that seems legally required in half of today’s fragrances. It’s there. We live with it. 

Performance is longer than your caffeine buzz. The irony is obvious. A coffee buzz lasts maybe ninety minutes. Akro Awake lasts far longer. Solid 7-8 hours on skin and it clings to clothes for days. You will smell it on your hoodie the next morning, reminding you that the grind never stops. 

Projection is strong for the first hour or so after that, it sits closer to the skin, creating a warm, personal scent bubble. Thankfully, this is not a room-filling monster.

This shines in autumn and winter. Cold air makes it feel cosy and rich, so keep it for sweater weather.

This is completely unisex. Coffee has no gender. Caffeine Addiction has no gender. The dry down leans traditionally masculine, but barely. 

This feels like a 25-plus fragrance. It is not playful or sugary. It is for people who pay taxes, have added an ergonomic chair to their wishlist and understand the importance of Isabgol in their morning ritual.

Akro Awake is a masterclass in realism. It captures the bitterness, warmth, and comfort of a morning cup and turns caffeine dependency into a personality trait. It is edgy, funny and extremely well executed.

**Buy it if:** You love coffee, hate sweetness and want to smell genuinely different.  
**Skip it if:** You hate coffee (duh), crave sugar, think Rasasi Hawas and Angham smells ""kewl"", or your parents still pay your bill.

Did you also feel alone despite being surrounded by people ( yayyy introvert vibes 🤌 ), were the class topper during high school but struggling with office politics and is looking for the best buddy you can laugh with, even when we are both 80 years old ?

Ever felt out of place with the entire dating culture and simply just want a bestie you can hang out with and be each others best cheerleader while creating the most insane pizza topping?

My dream growing up was to host a giant outdoor BBQ party, with me taking charge of the BBQ Grill ensuring everything is cooked perfectly, while you would be the classy host who would ensure everyone is comfy. Our pet dog would constantly try to steal a chicken leg from our grill 😅

I do love going for long strolls during sunset and trying out new adventures during weekends ( pottery, coffee making, Pilates, wall climbing, CPR training, visiting art museums etc )

I work in angel investing but also do help out at my parents ice cream shop at nights. ( I know how to make the best falooda ! )

I am mostly an old school romantic who is looking for one person to love for the rest of my life and ignore every other woman in this world 😅

Long hours at a desk, constant screen exposure, high work pressure, irregular meals, and poor sleep cycles are now part of daily life. Professionals working in fast-growing IT hubs like **Panathur** and **Kadubeesanahalli** experience these challenges even more intensely. Over time, this unhealthy routine leads to stress, chronic body pain, weight gain, reduced energy, and mental exhaustion.

This is where **personalized yoga classes** play a life-changing role. Unlike generic group sessions, personalized yoga focuses entirely on *your* body, *your* schedule, and *your* personal goals. Many professionals now search online for **“**[**Personalized Yoga Sessions near me**](https://fitnfirmstudios.in/services/personalized-sessions)**”** because they want a solution that fits their lifestyle instead of forcing them into rigid routines. If you are looking for the **Best Yoga Classes in Bangalore**, **Fit N Firm Studios** stands out as the **Best Yoga and Dance Studio in Bangalore**, offering expert-guided **Personalized Yoga Sessions in Panathur and Kadubeesanahalli** specifically designed for working professionals.

# Why Personalized Yoga is Essential for Modern Professionals

Every person has a unique body structure, work routine, stress level, and fitness requirement. A standard yoga class cannot cater to everyone’s individual needs. Personalized yoga begins with understanding your lifestyle, posture, daily activities, medical history, and fitness goals. Based on this detailed assessment, a customized yoga plan is created just for you.

At **Fit N Firm Studios**, trainers recognize that corporate professionals face specific issues such as stiff neck, lower back pain, anxiety, poor digestion, and lack of sleep. This is why [**Personalized Yoga Classes in Panathur and Kadubeesanahalli**](https://fitnfirmstudios.in/services/personalized-sessions) are designed to solve real-life problems instead of offering random postures. This thoughtful approach ensures that every session brings meaningful improvement to your daily life.

# Customized Yoga Programs Tailored to Your Body

One of the biggest advantages of personalized yoga is the individual attention you receive. If you spend most of your day sitting at a desk, your program will include postures that correct posture, strengthen your core, and improve spinal flexibility. If you suffer from stress or anxiety, your routine will focus more on breathing exercises, relaxation techniques, and meditation.

**Fit N Firm Studios** is known for its experienced instructors who closely monitor your progress. Your sessions are modified as your body adapts, ensuring steady improvement without overexertion. This careful approach prevents injuries and helps you build long-term strength and flexibility. It is this commitment to quality that makes Fit N Firm one of the [**Best Yoga Classes in Bangalore**](https://fitnfirmstudios.in/).

# Flexible Scheduling That Fits Your Work Life

One of the main reasons professionals skip fitness routines is lack of time. With office deadlines, commuting, and family responsibilities, it becomes difficult to follow a fixed schedule. **Personalized Yoga Sessions in Panathur** offer flexible time slots that suit your daily routine. Whether you prefer early mornings, late evenings, or weekend sessions, Fit N Firm Studios accommodates your schedule.

This flexibility is exactly why many people search for **Personalized Yoga Sessions near me** – they want something close, convenient, and easy to maintain. Fit N Firm ensures that your health never becomes a burden. Instead, it becomes a natural part of your lifestyle.

**Improved Mental Health and Stress Management**

Mental health is just as important as physical fitness, especially for professionals working in high-pressure environments. Continuous deadlines, meetings, and targets can lead to burnout, anxiety, and emotional exhaustion. Personalized yoga focuses deeply on calming the mind through guided breathing, mindfulness practices, and meditation.

With regular practice, you will notice better emotional control, sharper focus, and improved productivity at work. **Personalized Yoga Classes in Kadubeesanahalli** help professionals create mental balance and clarity, making them more confident and calm in their professional and personal lives.

# Effective Relief from Office-Related Body Pain

Sitting for long hours causes muscle stiffness, joint pain, and poor circulation. Neck strain, shoulder pain, and lower back discomfort are extremely common among IT professionals. Generic workouts often fail to target these specific issues. Personalized yoga identifies the root cause of your pain and focuses on corrective postures that strengthen weak muscles and improve mobility.

At **Fit N Firm Studios**, trainers ensure that every posture is performed safely with proper alignment. This prevents further injury and provides long-term relief from chronic pain. Many professionals experience noticeable improvement within just a few weeks of starting [**Personalized Fitness Sessions in Panathur and Kadubeesanahalli**](https://fitnfirmstudios.in/services/personalized-sessions).

# Faster and More Sustainable Results

One of the biggest frustrations with regular workouts is slow progress. Personalized sessions eliminate this problem. Your trainer tracks your development and updates your routine as your strength and flexibility improve. This keeps your body challenged and prevents fitness plateaus.

With [**Personalized Yoga & Fitness Sessions in Panathur**](https://fitnfirmstudios.in/services/personalized-sessions), professionals experience faster weight loss, improved stamina, better posture, and increased muscle strength. Because every exercise is chosen based on your body type and goals, the results are more effective and long-lasting.

# Natural Energy Boost Throughout the Day

Many professionals depend on coffee and energy drinks to stay active. However, these provide only temporary energy and cause crashes later. Yoga naturally increases your energy by improving oxygen circulation, balancing hormones, and enhancing digestion.

Professionals attending **Personalized Yoga Sessions in Kadubeesanahalli** often report feeling fresh, alert, and productive throughout the day. This natural energy boost helps you perform better at work without feeling exhausted by evening.

# Healthy Weight Management and Body Toning

Sedentary lifestyles and unhealthy eating habits are major reasons for weight gain. Personalized yoga focuses on fat-burning postures, core strengthening, and metabolism-boosting techniques. Your trainer also provides guidance on daily habits and lifestyle changes to support your fitness journey.

At **Fit N Firm Studios**, weight management programs are designed based on your body type and goals. This holistic approach makes it one of the **Best Yoga Classes in Bangalore** for sustainable weight loss and body toning.

I hope you are having a good day. I apologise if this is a weird or dumb question, I am a revert so I’m sorry if this is an obvious question.

I am about to commence my undergraduate at uni and I’ve done a short course at this uni and there are lots of international students and hijabis.

When I walk around campus, I notice that a lot of the time hijabis are struggling to keep their hijab in place (obviously I lower my gaze and look away).

Would it be weird or inappropriate for me to carry around and give to people if I notice they are struggling?

Also another question, I live in a western country and my family has always raised me to be charitable and friendly to people. Would it be weird for me to pay for Muslim girls coffees if they are in a line behind me? (Without any communication and for everyone not just hijabis lol)",4,1768028780.0,Hijabis,11,0.67,False

Each one may vary in importance from buying a coffee to working on a project for some time. I also incorporate my schedule into it, so each task is in order of completion. If I have classes that day, I build my tasks around the breaks in between. This system has been working pretty well for me the past two years, but I would like a way to save these lists everyday so I dont have to erase them everytime I make a new one. 

I tried habitica but the gamification didn’t appeal to me and it felt arduous creating my todos vs just entering them on my notes app. One thing I liked about it was how it ranked difficulties of each task. 

And for more information, I dont use any pomodoro timers and i dont want to set time periods for each task (unless its a set time for appointments or work, but i have google calendar for that.) Im trying to avoid using apps where logging everything and adding settings to each task is more complex than the actual doing, especially when some of my tasks are so simple. I make my todo lists the night before and I only want to spend around 2-8 minutes making it everyday, with each one averaging 15 tasks 

TLDR im looking for an app that logs each todo list everyday that can adjust difficulty of each task, is fast and easy to enter tasks for, and doesnt overcomplicate things. Otherwise, should I try using a physical planner or google sheets? Should I just consider sticking with what Im doing right now?",1,1768028390.0,productivity,2,1.0,False

Crazy for homemade coffee every morning ( also afternoon... 2 cups daily! always made my day!). I started with pour-overs first. Pour over is great, and feel like pour-over  is good for light roast beans, but also want to try something darker. And a professional coffee machine is a bit over my budget. A friend knew me so well, so gave me this Moka pot for Xmas and I’m happy to try it out!

Still stuck in my grind size for both the pour-over and the Moka pot.

1q8x6x0,https://www.reddit.com/r/parkingguides/comments/1q8x6x0/maximizing_commercial_property_value_near/,maximizing commercial property value near commuter rail,"  
  
hey y'all, been doing a ton of research lately on commercial property, especially stuff near commuter rail or light rail stations. figured i'd share some tips on how to really maximize that location, since being next to transit is basically the new ""location, location, location.""  
  
the first big concept is transit-oriented development or tod. it's not just about being close to the train. you want to think mixed-use. properties that blend commercial spaces, residential units, and retail/service amenities do way better because you're creating a little hub where people can live, work, and shop all within a short, walkable distance. this means higher foot traffic and lower vacancy rates honestly. a report i saw mentioned commercial properties near transit can see their sale prices jump anywhere from 5 to over 40 percent compared to properties further out.  
  
for tenants, look for things that directly serve the commuter flow. a coffee shop or a quick-serve breakfast/lunch spot is golden. dry cleaners, small fitness studios, and convenient office spaces that attract an urban workforce are also in high demand. the accessibility attracts big companies too because it makes it easier to pull in talent from a wider region. your property is now a ""talent magnet.""  
  
one other thing to consider that can turn into passive income is any extra space you have. even though these areas are supposed to be less car-centric, people still drive and need parking sometimes, especially if the station's lot fills up super quick. if you have an unused parking garage spot, a private driveway, or an extra lot space, you can easily list that extra space on an app like prked. you set your own price and schedule. it's a super easy setup and a great way to make some extra money from an asset you're not fully utilizing, like a private vip parking option for commuters willing to pay a little more for a close spot. even unused storage or a small, secure garage space could be listed for storage or short-term parking.  
  
also, check your local zoning. in tod areas, the city sometimes allows for higher-density development, or ""up-zoning,"" which dramatically increases your property's potential value by letting you build more units or more square footage. working with the city planning department on a long-term vision is key to maximizing this kind of investment.  
  
hope this helps anyone looking to buy or develop near a train station. it's a smart long-term bet.",1,1768027652.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False
1q8x6ww,https://www.reddit.com/r/parkingguides/comments/1q8x6ww/optimizing_your_business_district_property_for/,optimizing your business district property for the 7-day week,"  
  
hey everyone, i figured i'd share some thoughts on a weird thing i've noticed with business district properties lately. it used to be that the weekday was everything and the weekend was just a ghost town. now, with wfh and shifting patterns, the whole week needs a fresh look if you own or manage space downtown.  
  
the weekday is still important, for sure, with the typical 9-to-5 crowd. you get your commuter traffic spikes in the morning and late afternoon, which means coffee shops, grab-and-go lunch spots, and dry cleaners still do great then. but what's crazy is how low the office occupancy is compared to a few years ago. a lot of buildings are just sitting half-empty monday to friday. this is why you see some retail vacancies even though the area \*feels\* busy sometimes.  
  
the weekend usage has really changed though. in some major city centers, the foot traffic on saturday and sunday is actually higher than it was before 2020. the vibe changes completely. instead of suits running to meetings, you get people coming for leisure. the peak traffic shifts from the morning commute to a more relaxed 10 am to 5 pm window. this traffic is driven by restaurants, bars, museums, and events. basically, the business district becomes a destination spot for locals and tourists.  
  
for property owners, this empty time is a huge opportunity you're leaving on the table. if you have unused space, especially on the weekends when your main office tenants are gone, you can make money on it. think about renting out a portion of a lobby or an unused common area for a weekend pop-up shop, an art show, or even a small indoor market. you can use flexible, modular furniture and movable partitions to convert the space easily.  
  
also, parking is a huge factor. on weekdays, it's a mess with all the commuters, but then on weekends, your parking garage or lot is almost totally empty because the office workers aren't there. you can list that unused parking space on an app like prked. it's a great way to generate passive income from an asset you already own that's just sitting there on saturdays and sundays, or even every night after 6 pm. people coming downtown for dinner or a show get a safer, often closer, and way cheaper spot to park on someone's private property, and you make easy money from an empty driveway or garage.  
  
the key to maximizing your property's value now is flexibility and multi-use design. design spaces that can be a collaboration zone for an office on a tuesday and a venue for a private event or a group fitness class on a saturday. look into smart building tech to track when and how the space is actually being used so you can make data-driven decisions on where to add value.  
  
hope this helps anyone trying to figure out how to squeeze more juice out of their downtown real estate.",1,1768027652.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

hey everyone, figured i'd share some tips on what works really well for commercial properties near big hospitals or medical centers. the location is gold, you just have to target the right constant flow of people: patients, their families, and the huge staff of doctors and nurses.  
  
first, look at the medical needs that the hospital itself might not cover or has overflow for. things like a specialized elder care center or adult day care are in high demand for families who need short-term respite or post-surgical care. niche businesses like a diagnostic center for blood work and imaging, or a dedicated hyperbaric oxygen therapy center, also thrive because they can partner with the doctors or take overflow from the hospital. a home health-care agency or home nursing services are another great option since a lot of recovery happens at home now.  
  
for retail and services, staff and visitors are your main customers. a coffee shop, a mini mart, or any kind of decent restaurant or pub-style place is always a winner because the doctors and nurses are working crazy hours and always ordering food. a pharmacy is essential for immediate prescription pick-ups after appointments. don't forget the stress factor - a massage therapy service or a gym appeals to the busy staff and patients doing rehab. you can also get into medical equipment rental or sales for things people need to take home.  
  
to truly maximize the \*physical\* property, think about accessibility and space. parking is a nightmare near any medical district, and a lack of it can kill your business. if you have any extra space like a driveway or an unused garage, you should list it on prked. it's a super easy way to make passive income from the property by renting out your parking spot to visitors, patients, or even staff who want a safer, closer, and way cheaper vip parking option. you just set your own price and schedule. check your local zoning laws to make sure your proposed business or any renovations are allowed, and always plan for future growth because these areas only get busier. a high-visibility location is always best for catching that constant foot traffic.

Knowing yourself sounds simple, until you actually try. It’s one thing to know your favorite songs or how you take your coffee. It’s another to face the parts of you that flinch when things don’t go your way. The defensiveness. The habits you call “just who I am.” The excuses that sound like logic because you’ve practiced them for years.

Real self-knowledge isn’t about polishing your image, it’s about standing still long enough to see where you hide. It shows up in the quiet after a mistake, in the sting of being called out, in the moment you realize you’ve been busy avoiding, not becoming.

But here’s the beauty, once you start looking with honesty instead of judgment, something shifts. You stop being trapped by old patterns. You begin to move by choice, not compulsion. And that’s when self-knowledge stops being uncomfortable and starts being liberating.",1,1768027364.0,Word_of_The_Day_Affir,0,1.0,False

1q8x1x5,https://www.reddit.com/r/parkingguides/comments/1q8x1x5/commercial_property_near_a_hospital_extra_cash/,commercial property near a hospital extra cash opportunities,"  
  
hey y’all, figured i’d share some tips if you have or are looking at buying commercial space near a hospital. it’s a gold mine for certain kinds of businesses because of the constant flow of doctors, nurses, visitors, and patients.  
  
first, and honestly this is a big one, everyone working at or visiting the hospital is constantly struggling with parking. if your property has an extra driveway, a garage, or even just some unused parking spots, you can make some serious passive income by listing that space on an app like prked. the parking spots are always way cheaper than hospital parking, and for staff especially it's super convenient. for the ""parkers,"" it feels safer because they’re leaving their car on someone's property, and sometimes the hosts will even drive them right up to the entrance. it lets them skip the parking chaos and long lines. for you as the host, it's super easy to list your extra space and set your own price and schedule. it's one of the easiest ways to make money from the space you already have.  
  
now, for the actual commercial space. a lot of people think only medical offices will work, but there are so many other options.  
  
food and drink is huge. staff work long, crazy hours and visitors are stressed. a 24-hour coffee and snack shop, a juice bar for healthy options, or a restaurant that does quick, reliable delivery to the hospital would be a slam dunk. my friend's wife is a nurse and they are always ordering food to be delivered to the break room.  
  
think about medical-adjacent services that the hospital doesn't offer. a physical therapy and rehabilitation center is always needed for post-op patients. a diagnostic clinic or an independent lab could pull a steady stream of referrals. even a medical supply store that rents and sells equipment like wheelchairs, oxygen tanks, or hospital beds for home use is a great idea.  
  
don't forget the retail and personal services people need. a flower shop for visitors, a uniform or scrub shop for staff, or even a specialized retail store with things like maternity wear, comfortable pajamas, or small toys for kids is smart. also, a convenience store or mini-mart for quick essentials.  
  
finally, consider services for the staff and long-term visitors. a day care facility for nurses and doctors is a huge perk. for visitors of long-term patients, a small, clean, short-term rental or a bunk-bed type of facility for caretakers who just need a few hours of sleep can make a big difference.

1q8x10a,https://www.reddit.com/r/chessbeginners/comments/1q8x10a/more_chess_stories_from_the_swedish_ghetto/,More Chess stories from the Swedish Ghetto.,"thank you. I played a few more matches with other guys but when one just never showed up the following week and I had to get the win through adjudication, , I just lost interest.





I think it was the US Open that brought the Russian Grandmasters to DC and one of them, Shamkovich, played a simultaneous match which I joined. There were 25 of us against him. We were seated in a big square and Shamkovich walked around the middle. 





Very quickly, people were dropping like flies but when he came around to me, I had a very strong player to my left and another one to my right.

Sham spent most of his time right in front of me looking first to his right and then to his left. He didn't pay me enough attention and at move 53 everyone was gone except us 3. That's when it gets tough because while other players were still alive we had some breathing time. Now, he never moved just waited for us to move.

  


My wife at the time was standing behind me wearing the slinkiest outfit she had.





That poor old Russian Grandmaster couldn't decide if the guy on my left needed his focus or the guy on my right did. 

  


And I was up a Pawn too with a drop deag gorgeous young lady with her hand on my shoulder ...  and Shamkovich didn't know whether to quack like a duck or go blind. He looked totally shot. 





Since my end game sucked and before he beat me, I resigned. Hell, I had a scorecard that showed me up a pawn after 52 moves against a Russian Grandmaster. I couldn't have been happier. It was the classy thing to do. Chess was his life, not mine.

  


Lefty and Righty both beat him. 





The next game I played was 6 years later in MPLS against my Uncle. He was a WWII vet and drank a lot but when he talked about Morphy or Casablanca, he lit up the room. He'd play their games and show all four of us cousins (all boys) the most famous games. 





That was the atmosphere I wish I'd had in DC.  





With my uncle, we had to ***live UP to chess*** because it was in a land of heroes. None of us realized how powerful we were and I mean that in an intellectual, boots on the ground sense. My dad's generation were cannon fodder but their ancestors were bigger than life. Both my uncle and my dad were big boys and both came back from WWII with scars, physical and mental. Booze helped them cope because in their day PTSD was called, ""Shell Shock"", not a disorder, just something you had to ""walk off"".



 

Their unlce had ""connections"" in Mpls and at the time only vets could get liquor licenses and he needed one for his bar, The Golden Leaf down on 7 corners near the U of M.  He bought my dad a Liquor store, a car, a chest full of silk ties and suits.  Crazy things went on in those days, and to give you a flavor of what it was like, I'll share a story my ma told me. 





Both my dad and uncle ""buck"" were bouncers and one night she saw them breaking up a riot in the bar. Each came out the door with a guy under each arm and they were bloody as hell. They literally threw the drunks into the street and went back and got four more. Lots of drinking went on for guys coming back from italy and north africa. My dad had scars on his face, shrapnel scars on his back, the nervers to the big toe on his right foot had been severed by a bullet that passed through that leg, burned through the left pant leg and into the calf, leaving a perfect scar showing exactly how big the bullet had been. Many stories like that were drank into oblivion after WWII. We never seem to learn.







I came home on leave from the Navy (before DC) where I had won the ship's chess championship. Tom, my cousin and the middle of the three cousins said, ""Let's go hunting."" So, we loaded up his truck and went. 

  


The weather was horrible and we decided to just sit in the truck's 'topper' and play chess. We had coffee in a thermos, sandwiches and all was right with the world.

  


Tpm beat me 7 games in a row. So much for the bigshot champion. Tom was the deadliest chess player that ever sat across from me. He was never rated, never played under the clock and the only game I could play even with him was pool.

  


I made a friend at a libertarian party meeting who said he played chess and pool and had never met anyone who could beat him at either game.

  


Well, I had a nice table downstairs at home  and invited him over for a game or two. He lost at both and said, ""damn, you're good"". I said, ""yeah? you gotta see my cousin Tom. If you ever meet him do NOT play for money"".



Tom passed away a year ago from alcohol poisoning. After being in the hospital for a week he called me and said, ""Steve, I fucked up"" and he told me what happened. I was furious at him and didn't go see him before he died and I've regretted it ever since.





He never played in a chess tournament but he beat me all the time. We'd play pool all night long, eat chilli with crackers and cheese and play 8-ball, 5 bucks a ball.  20 bucks might change hands by morning. 



Chess players are Warriors. I came home on another leave and Tom was standing in my ma's backyard. He had THE look on his face and that meant it was ass-kicking time. We didn't hug, we wrestled. 

  


By the time we quit, there wasn't a single section of my ma's picket fence still standing. For those moments we were warriors and that's what I miss so very, very much. 





When my uncle Buck talked about chess, there was an intensity that is hard to describe. He imbued it with the majesty of a Cathedral and the mystery of celtic chants and harps.  Someone should do that online. Imagine what could be done to enhance the mystery and history of chess.",1,1768027080.0,chessbeginners,1,1.0,False

1q8wzd5,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1q8wzd5/hi_im_spiraling_out/,"Hi, I'm spiraling out (:","This is my first post on reddit ever, let alone something as personal as this. I even went to make an anonymous account just to post this. I don't really know what I'm doing here. I guess I just need to process the gravity of everything that just happened to me. The problem is that I don't really know where to start because there is a lot of lore that's required for context before I can get to why what's happening now is effecting me like it is, so I guess I'll just give you guys the highlights.

In pre-school, I met my childhood best friend. Let's call her Nicole. Growing up, I thought our families were just close. We were over their house all of the time and for every holiday, including super bowls. I had my own bed, car seat and everything from that house. And when I had just turned 13 years old, that friend died in a very tragic accident at 11 years old: my mother sent me to school the next day.

I don't really remember much of my life, let alone teachers from back then; but I remember that teacher's name, where I was standing and the absolute look of shock on her face. I blacked out and fainted, woke up to my teacher cradling me and I remember thinking that was the first time I felt genuine concern and love.

I also don't know what happened after that, but the conclusion that my therapists and I have come to is I was likely being a disturbance to class with my grief. It's highly likely the administration sat my mother down and asked her to keep me home for a time because I was completely consumed by grief and beyond inconsolable. And on the way back from being sent home, my mother was angry at me. She told me that I got sent home from school because ""no body likes an Eeyore"" and she'd continue to say that to me any time I cried about my sister (friend) dying. It didn't help that in the particular state we lived in, they basically had no homeschooling laws past ""leave your name and number"" and that was it. She realized how easy it was to pull me in and out of school from that scenario, so she'd later weaponize that against me: I'd go to school for a month, get pulled out and locked in my room for 3 months. So on and so forth.

Objectively that is the worst thing she's ever said to me, but it's all just one brick in a very long wall, you know? And to no one's surprise, she was also extremely physically abusive.

For example, and I genuinely don't remember this (meaning there's no emotional connection to this instance), but according to my brother (who is 8 years younger than me), apparently there was a point in our childhood where she held me down, cut my wrists and then took me to a mental hospital to convince them I was suicidal to keep me out of the house. That tracks because she'd do things like kick me out of the house and then report me as a runaway and send me to juvi. Even when I was a toddler, she'd do things like shove a showerhead up my private parts (I'm female) with piping hot water every time she gave me a bath and would then laugh at how I was squirming. I could sincerely go on and on for days with stories like this.

Now my father was ""in my life,"" but not really. He'd watch her beat me, some of which I would classify as attempted murder. Sometimes he'd try to step in, but she'd threaten to divorce him and take the kids, so he'd always backdown. They pretty much got divorced right after Nicole died. I actually wanted them to get divorced because it was easier for me to deal with one shitty parent instead of two, you know? He ended up moving states away. I saw him maybe twice between the ages of 13 and 19: he visited for a Christmas and for my high school graduation. ***We're going to circle back to this dynamic later.***

My high school graduation was a really big deal for me, particularly because I was emancipated right as I hit 14 years old. I never told a soul about the abuse, because with being as isolated as I was up until that point, I didn't know the full gravity of it all. I just thought I was the problem, you know?

One day I come in with marks and my 10th grade math teacher pulls me out into the hallway, grabs me by my shoulders and shakes me as hard as she can, screaming ""this is what we've been waiting for!"" She knew, you know? And she had apparently started a case against my mother with my principal and counselor involved. They knew that I was close to my grandmother (my mom's mom) and called her first. They pretty much told her that if she wasn't willing to take guardianship over me, then I'd go into the foster system and then so would my brother. My grandmother told them she's willing to do it, they pulled my mom in and gave her the ultimatum; and of course she agreed to it because god forbid the family image get's hurt by this. ***We're going to circle back to this, too.***

Now around this time, my grandmother was a recent widow for the second time with her second husband. Her first husband, my blood-related grandfather, worked on oil rigs: they had to move where the job was along with her being the traditional 1950s wife. And despite all of my grandmother's flaws, I do admire that she went back to college with her kids to become a nurse practitioner. It really shows you're never too late for something, you know?

Anyways, she found this foreclosed, tiny 2 bedroom and 1 bathroom cottage style house and then put a boatload of money into fixing it up: I've never seen her happier than living there. Every morning she'd wake up before work and go out onto the porch, drinking her coffee in just complete peace. She was SO proud to finally have a house and a career to herself. It was truly heartwarming to see.

Now I don't recall how long we lived together, but I don't believe it was longer than a year. I don't think the timeframe is entirely relevant anyhow because I was still abandoned, no matter how anyone (my grandmother mainly) tries to spin it; but one day she came to me all dressed up and asked if I could take pictures of her. I said, ""Sure! You look nice. What's this for?"" and she says ""E-harmony."" Me being a 14 year old kid, I said ""You go get it, grandma!""

For a few weeks there, she had gone out on some dates. I didn't know with who or if it was even with the same person. All I know is that within a month of being on E-harmony, she didn't come home for 3 days. My mother and I weren't on speaking terms around this time given everything that just happened, but we were so worried about her that we actually managed to work together to call different hospitals and such for Jane Does. To no-show like that was SO unlike her, like we legitimately thought she was dead.

Fast forward to when my grandmother reappears, she casually comes home and says ""Hey."" It was seriously like Freaky Friday where the roles were reversed because my 14 year-old self was like, ""where have you been (old) lady?"" You know? Come to find out, she had gotten married; and not only that, she was actually expecting me to go live with them an hour and a half away. Mind you, my grandmother is old school southern: you don't talk back or you're going to go out and pick your own switch type of southern, but I let her have it. I could go on about the details of how nasty she treated me during that argument, but overall my argument was that I was starting my 3rd high school as is and did not want to go to a 4th. That and I was just simply not comfortable moving in with some old ass dude I've never met as a 14 year-old girl to a completely different city where I knew no one. It should be noted though that I've met him several times since then and genuinely think he's an alright guy, but at the time, just - absolutely not.

It was also kind of like, ""What the hell are you going to do with the house? I know you don't want to sell it."" And she's like, ""No, I definitely don't want to sell."" So then I said, ""Okay, are you going to rent it?"" She goes, ""No I love this house too much and am too told to deal with the risk of renters trashing it."" So I said, ""Why can't I stay here and just keep up with it? Not like the house isn't paid for. I could even babysit to pay for the utilities."" And she actually had the audacity to be like, ""you're too young to be left on your own like that."" And I'm like, ""but I'm not for you to straight up abandon me for 3 days?"" Needless to say, I won that argument and ended up living on my own at 14 years old. She never asked for me to pay for anything outside of the utilities, but I was so mad at her and the world that I ended up working 4 jobs throughout high school to pay her rent because I couldn't stand the thought of being abandoned again: I wanted to prove to myself I didn't need her or anyone else.

Post high school graduation though, a few things happened. Firstly, I was in a very co-dependent relationship with a guy (same age as me ) who came from a really messed up situation like I did. We were literally in that house, living like a married couple for 5 years. Absolutely wild and still can't believe I did that, but it is what it is.

Anyhow, I eventually ended it with him because it was a very toxic relationship; but we're cool now, you know? We were just broken kids; but nonetheless, breaking that relationship off at the time felt like the end of the world to me. I didn't want to be alone after that, so I invited a friend of mine to come live with me. Two weeks after we graduated, he died in a tragic accident while I watched his parents clean out his room. To see parents actually care about their child like that, that... that was something else for me.

So a couple of months after he passed away, there was a situation where an acquaintance appeared on my front doorstep unannounced, asking if he could stay for the night and for a ride to some place the next morning where his aunt (or someone like that) could pick him up. It seemed like a 911 situation, but I didn't press for details because I literally just got home myself 10 minutes prior from working 14 hours straight. I was exhausted and just said sure, here's the couch, I need to take a shower and I'm crashing, but I'll drive you to wherever in the morning if you need it. Well, he broke into my shower (literally screwed the doorhandle off) and brutally raped me. I didn't want to live alone for safety reasons after that, but I also couldn't bare the thought of letting anyone stay where my recently deceased friend's room, and I certainly didn't want my ex back after grieving that relationship like I did.

All of that said, I decided to move in with my shit dad. He lived in a city on the east coast where as I lived in the middle of no-where town in the deep south: there was no way I was going to be able to move out of there on my own anytime soon anyways. So despite the bad circumstances, I was very excited for a change of pace. Regardless though, the plan was to stay with him only for as long as I needed to. I was going to find a job somewhere, attend a community college and find roommates to bunk with as soon as I possibly could.

Before I go into this next dynamic, it should be noted that both my mother and my uncle are the same person: neither of them can hold down a job for more than 6 months and that's being generous. My mother has PHD and my uncle has 4 bachelors degrees, all of them are in absolutely useless fields.

And I won't go into too much detail about my uncle because he's not really an important figure in my life, but just so you have a clear picture of him; some years ago, I had an ex-boyfriend punch me in the face (hence why he's an ex) and I told my grandmother I was going to press charges. Now I don't speak to my uncle unless it's an emergency, but 5 minutes after I got off of that phone call with my grandmother, he calls me; and before I picked up, my expectation was that of a protective uncle, like ""Where is he?!"" Instead, he went on to tell me about all the times he punched my aunt in the face. I let him yammer on, but eventually I cut him off and said, ""Did you just call me to tell me about all of the times you punched my aunt in the face?"" And he goes, in quote, ""Oh, no! I just wanted to say that when I met (insert ex's name) that one time I picked you guys up from the airport, god spoke to me and told me that he was a disturbed soul."" I couldn't write this shit even if I tried, you know?

Anywho, my grandmother offered them to move into the house I just moved out of. The deal was that he take care of the house and utilities, except he's never found a job and they've had to replace the floors in that house 3 times in under 10 years. We replaced it once when we initially flipped the house, but twice since my uncle moved in. And although he is a hoarder, the main problem was all of the window unites. He would put an AC unit in every single window because he claims that running one in just the room he's in saves money as opposed to running the HVAC on the entire house. And sure, maybe if you lived in a 2 story-house like I do now; but this was seriously a house with MAYBE 800 square foot. We also put in a brand new HVAC when we flipped the damn thing, so I really can't imagine it making THAT much of a difference on the bill; but nonetheless, the condensation from all of these units kept seeping into the floors, which is why my grandmother has paid to replace it twice since I've moved out.

My grandmother always provides both my uncle and my mother. I fought with her over this stuff because I did not like seeing them treat her like a bank; but at one point she goes, ""What am I supposed to do?! Put my son out on the street?"" And I said, ""At this point, you could set them up in a nice double wide trailer and still spend half as much on it compared to the cost of these floor replacements alone."" Know what I mean? That's when she admitted to me that she knows she's being taken advantage of and is okay with it; so at that point, I let it go because there's no point in talking an enabler out of something like that. And I promise, **this is relevant for later too.**

So back to moving across states to live with my dad, yeah? I was unknowingly screaming in my sleep from PTSD and my dad came in, woke me up and seemed worried about me. I was understandably flustered and made an in the moment decision to communicate what's going on, especially as it seemed that I wouldn't be able to hide it if I tried to anyways. He said, in quote,

>""You're going to hate me for saying this, but I think you're making this up for attention just like your mom did.""

I just had just confessed that I was raped and I then had to sit there and process that he not only did that to my mother, but also had to explain to him that no means no. So while my dad isn't verbally or physically abusive to me, he's certainly a is misogynist beyond what words could describe. Just to give you a small taste outside of that conversation, when I got my first big girl job, it wasn't ""Congratulations, sweetheart! I'm proud of you."" It was, ""You only got that job because you have big tits."" It should also be noted that when he talks to my brother, it's ""You're a bright young man!"" Ah, but we're not going to go down that rabbit hole.

Either which way, after a few months of living with my dad, I could barely overhear what sounded like a distressful call from my brother (who is again 8 years younger than me and had been left with my mother this entire time). I asked my dad what all of that was about and he said that my mother hit my then 15 year-old brother in the face with a piece of piping. My brother was trying to ask my dad how to contact CPS. My dad straight up told him that it was his fault for mouthing off and that he's making it up for attention. And remember kids, I was emancipated at 14 years old and worked 4 jobs throughout high school because he continued to give my mother my child support until I aged out: neither of them would give me a dime, but I'm so glad that I also made it up for attention. That just all sounds like such a fun time, yeah?

So as you can imagine, I rightfully lost my shit on my dad. I threatened to never speak to him again if he didn't do something about my brother. I was dead serious, too. You know it and my dad definitely knew it. We managed to get my mother to agree to let my brother come up for a couple of weeks for a summer vacation. After that, my dad grappled back and forth between keeping him or sending him back. Every day and every night for a solid 4 months, I had to convince my dad to keep him. He finally decided to stick to keeping him, but then the next issue is this:

Dad: ""Hey, your brother needs a new bed.""  
Me: ""That's cool, where's your card?""  
Dad: ""You can't get it?""  
Me: ""I already bought him basically everything else, including new clothes. I'm tapped out and he's your son.""  
Dad: ""I'll just ask your grandmother then.""  
Me: ""That is YOUR son and you make $90,000 a year. Do NOT ask her to pay for it.""

So as you can see, I have been protecting my grandmother from my uncle, my mother and my dad. I had no money because all of it was going to my brother since he didn't have anything and not once did I ask for her help. **Keep this in mind for the next bit.**

A couple years later, a homeless guy wrecked and stole my paid for car. I had a surprise trip planned to visit my grandmother on her birthday, but I was on her insurance at time, so I had to spoil the surprise because I needed her to file the claim for me. While we were on the phone, she OFFERED to help me buy a car while I was down there because she said it'd be easier to do that instead of having to later wire the money to me later when the payout finally came through and then I could just drive it back up from there; and because that objectively made so much logistical sense, I agreed to it .

Fast forward to us sitting in the dealership where I found the car I wanted, yeah? They ran my credit. I was approved for the car, but it being my first big girl purchase, the interest rate was high. I don't remember what it was, but it was between 9-12%.

I didn't ask her to do this, but she asked the dealership to run her credit for a co-sign for a lowered interest rate. Her credit ended up being garbage because she doesn't have any open accounts since everything she has is paid for. My step-grandfather, on the other hand, buys and trades in cars every other year: he never wanted to co-sign the car. He even told me he's never co-signed for anyone, not even his kids. He even snatched one of the keys out of my hand and said if I missed a payment, he'd drive back down to grab it (I didn't find it offensive, by the way. I thought his bluntness was funny, actually); but nevertheless, they ran his credit and I got an interest rate for under 3% and I would've been a special kind of stupid to not take that deal, so I did that too.

Now I had the car for about 6 months, paying for it on my own; but something happened at a job I was at that made me snap and quit with no savings to start my own business. I never asked her to help me with the car, but she could see I was struggling and she offered to pay for it and I would've been stupid then too to not accept the help. Granted this was 4 years ago (I'm still in business) and she hasn't asked about the car, but I'm still very up and down some months, so I haven't mentioned it either: I've just been riding the wave, yeah? And I don't feel guilty for it given all of the above situations and because she offered. I see it as her helping a 25 year old start a business, not a 50+ year old trashing her house, but I digress. All of this to say, I've been operating under the notion that if she did mind, she'd say something, yeah?

Well, I get a phone call completely out of the blue. She's very flustered about something, and in a panicked way, so says ""I need you to take on the car note."" I said, ""Yeah, no problem. I can do that. I don't know what's going on, but are you by chance able to wait a month or two so I can get a couple more clients to cover payments? If not, I will figure something out."" And she says, ""I just seem to keep helping you and there's something wrong with that picture.""

The way I had to hang up the phone. THE WAY I HAD TO HANG UP THE PHONE. After ALL of the fights I have had to put up with to protect her, that was THE MOST disrespectful thing I've ever had said to me. It even tops the Eeyore comment for me, honestly. I told her how disrespectful it was and it didn't seem to clock with her fully, so I took the time to write her a well thought out letter. She ended up apologizing and I accepted it.

From there, a few months go by and I decide to go visit her for the holiday season. There were so many nasty things she said to me during my time there, but the one that got me was her saying ""I didn't agree with anything in that letter, but I apologized anyways."" Mind you, she's the closest thing I've had to a parent this far. I didn't know how to describe how I was feeling then, but in hindsight the adjectives I would use is broken and betrayed.

Here's the other thing with my grandmother, too. My dynamic with my mother has been very a flippant topic. There were times where she could partially admit who my mother actually is, but then there are times where it's extreme denial.

Just to give you an example, because it is relative to what I'm about to say in the next segment, I have my mother blocked on 7 Instagram accounts alone and that's when I simply gave up. I have her blocked on everything, but at some point she realized that if she manually input my email on a file on google photos to share something with me specifically, I'd get the notification. I opened the first one, and it's never before seen pictures of Nicole. The next were never before seen pictures of my childhood dog. After opening a few of these, she literally blurred out the photo to put text over it. Though she didn't outright say it, but it was really like ""the only way you'll see these is if you talk to me."" I just straight stopped opening them all together and it took her a few months of spamming my emails before she stopped. This is outright stalking, yeah?

And you know, I've had conversations with my grandmother about that specific thing and she'd say ""It's just a mother desperate to talk to her children."" I even agree with the sentiment, but it's like I still have to explain to her that my mother has not respected this boundary since day one; but if you talk to my grandmother about a similar situation at a different time, she'd actually admit that my mother is crossing a boundary. I've always found that extremely confusing, so I've tried to avoid talking about my mother all together with her, but I've just now been realizing this past week that her answers were never ""flippant."" The answers just hinge on her relationship status with her because they are very on and off. If they're on, I'm the one that's disrespectful. If they're off, my mother's the one that's in the wrong; and because I don't talk to mother dearest for obvious reasons, I just never have a way of knowing which version of my grandmother I'm going to get on that subject.

Anyhow, when I decided to go completely no contact with my mother, my grandmother tried to pressure me to speak with my mother incessantly. It got to a point where I told her that I will have to go no contact with her too if she does not respect that I do not wish to speak to my mother. I even told her that I don't care if she wants to talk to my mother about me or if she wants to talk to me about her: I just want nothing to do with her. My grandmother ""agreed to it,"" but I'm also just now processing that she didn't really. I've just SUBCONSIOUSLY kept it to small talk because (a) I never knew what version I was going to get and (b) if they were on, I'd get the classics: ""you're being mean and cruel to your mother,"" ""people change,"" ""the bible says honor your mother and father,"" ""you need to forgive,"" and blah, blah, blah.

And just to be clear here, I forgave my mother eons ago. In fact, I think narcissism is the saddest disorder to have because you go through your whole life never understanding why your dreams don't work out or why your children don't speak to you. People demonize narcissists and I get it - I do, but to me it's like getting mad at a dementia patient for having an episode. It's just how they are, yeah? But that doesn't mean you have to subject yourself to that behavior. In other words, my stance is that forgiveness does NOT mean reconnection and I've explained that to my grandmother more times than I can count.

About a year ago, my step-grandfather got diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. He's over 80 years old, the treatments aren't doing much and it's made him sick as a dog; so, they've decided to stop the treatments and downsize homes while they can. That is all understandable as was her reason for calling me 6 months ago. She was having a mental breakdown on the side of the interstate. She talked for 3 straight hours and I didn't say a word. I was just happy that she called someone, you know? So she started with ""He usually does this, but now I have to..."" to being nostalgic and reflective about her life to flat nihilistic. She started talking about my mother specifically and I had never heard her be as honest as she was then. She said a lot of things that were shocking, one of which is what's causing this crash out of mine right now.

When I was about 9 years old, her and I got in a very bad car accident. Truly, we're lucky to be alive. We hydroplaned on the interstate, hit a semi-truck, flew off a bridge and onto a treetop. I was thankfully asleep with the passenger seat reclined all the way back and my seatbelt on, or I definitely would be dead. The car was completely crushed to a point where even witnesses that pulled over didn't know what to do or if anyone was alive. There was no way to open the doors, but I managed to take the buckle from my seat and smash the window open. I was tiny enough to crawl out. Keep in mind too that the only time I had seen car accidents like this as a kid was on TV. I thought the powder from the airbag was smoke. My grandmother had several broken bones and was unconscious, like I wasn't even sure if she was alive; but I carefully crawled out onto the other side and tried to pull her out. An off duty firefighter / EMT saw, immediately grabbed me by my shoulders and slapped me in the back of his truck while he stabilized her and called an ambulance.

Ever since around that time, she's had bad neck issues. A small part of me always thought it was my fault because I moved her when I shouldn't have, but I forgave myself for that a long time ago because (a) I was a kid that didn't know any better and (b) it could've just been the wreck itself. Come to find out, she confessed to me that my mother threw her on the ground and repeatedly stomped on her next.

As I'm talking this out, like I've known that my grandmother had some strong narcissistic tendencies, but I was just in denial because... I don't know? I just wanted a parent? And she didn't seem as bad compared to the ones I've been dealt, you know? It was easy for me to revere her as my savior because she ""rescued"" me from my mother's house, but I'm just now realizing that it was never about helping me. It was an image thing.  I mean my god, a couple of years ago my grandmother slipped and had a bad fall where she busted her head: she didn't even call an ambulance because ""what would the neighbors think?""

When she admitted to what my mother did to her neck, I heard it - I did. I just put it on the back burner and didn't process the gravity of it until now, yeah? If she actually gave a damn about me, she would've pulled me and my infant brother out of that house when it happened, not when her hand has been forced.

The sad part is? She's even corned my brother before to tell him I'm the one that hallucinated everything, as in she believes I'm the one that poisoned him against my mother; and believe me, he came to the same conclusion I did all on his own. You know?

One last thing about my mother. I've been realizing the last few months that the reason why I haven't chased my dreams like I should've (I'm a singer) is because I'm scared of my mother. Not because I care what she thinks of me, but because I could 100% see her publicly trying to ride my coattails and then coming up with insane and embarrassing stories in retaliation. I'm not scared of that anymore. Let it come because I'll sue her for defamation and file a restraining order for all I care, yeah? I also used to feel so much shame singing in front of people. There was even a time where I showed up for a voice lesson, tried to sing, and ended up in this random woman's bathroom bawling my eyes out. I showed up next week for my slot and she had given it away. My teacher was shocked I even came back type of mental breakdown, you know?

BUT I finally finished my first vocal cover ever. Just the fact that I finished it means more to me than words can describe. The fact I'm even in a band and can sing in front of people. I've just been in this ""wow I'm so proud of me,"" teary-eyed state of mind the last couple of weeks, which brings me to the last call that I had with my grandmother a week ago.

I called. She asked about what's new with me. I wanted to tell her about the cover so badly, but I didn't and my heart broke. I couldn't process why until after the call, but it's because she always has to compare you to someone else or insert her (negative) opinion on it; but the small talk of a conversation continues nonetheless, and because I've been on that nostalgic kick and my mother holds all of my childhood pictures hostage, I asked my grandmother if she'd be willing to do me a favor. She said ""shoot,"" and I asked her to ask my mother for my childhood pictures anonymously. And I knew that there was a chance I'd get an earful, but this reaction was over the top, even for her because she SCREAMS at me on the top of her lungs ""WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU AND YOUR BROTHER?"" as she goes into absolutely grilling me for not speaking to my mother.

You know what though? Used to, that stuff would upset me. This was the first time I wasn't emotional whatsoever. I talked to her calmly and respectfully, yet she hung up the phone on me. I sent her a long thought out message and she just texts back, ""Stop writing. I see, but I need peace."" The next day, I get ""Happy New Year... I know that you love me and that feels good inside.""

The sad part? I regretted sending out that text message before she could even respond because she never talks about real problems. She'll be as disrespectful as she possibly could be, we'll get into it; and I mean that I could call her after a week of not speaking to her and I'll get ""Hey! How's my favorite granddaughter"" as if nothing happened.

And what gets me is everything she's said, I've heard before. I just think it's just the fact that this has been the first big pow-wow since her last confession of ""I just apologized anyways,"" you know? I realized that even if I were to get an apology out of her, I wouldn't trust it. I think this is getting me as bad as it is now because of that and realizing that I couldn't even tell her about the most important thing I've done so far. That and I never fully processed the whole thing about my mother stomping on her neck thing, like... that's straight attempted murder if you ask me and this woman just left me and my brother in that house.

So yeah, that's my story. I've vented to several friends of mine over this last week. I've tried just about everything to get this out of my system and nothing's working. I figured maybe typing it out somewhere will help, but so far all I feel is numb, especially in my hands because holy cow I just wrote a novel. If you read this all the way through, you're real one - truly.

The only question now is what to do about the car, yeah? I can go in and change my bank information over no problem, but his name is still on the car: she would take it back if I went no-contact with her even if I was paying for it.

The advice I got from my friends was just to call less, come up with excuses over text and keep riding the car payments out until I'm able to pay it off all the way. It's only got like $9k left on it, so I think if I really scrounged and saved I could get it paid off by the end of the year. I'm open to suggestions on that, though.",3,1768026926.0,raisedbynarcissists,3,1.0,False

hey all, saw a lot of questions about this lately and figured i'd share some ideas on how to capitalize on a business property close to a university. that constant flow of students and faculty is a gold mine if you hit the right market.  
  
first things first, your property itself has extra value. whether you open your own business or lease it out, proximity is key. think about student housing. even a commercial building could be converted into co-living spaces or purpose-built student apartments if the zoning works out. if you don't want to go that big, consider using any extra lot space or unused driveway/garage space for parking. that campus parking is usually a nightmare and expensive. you can list that extra space on an app like prked to make passive income. it's super easy to set your own price and schedule, and you can make money while you're closed or if you just have an empty lot.  
  
if you're looking to start your own thing, convenience and affordability are what students care about most. fast-casual dining is always a winner--think pizza, burgers, or healthy quick-service food. or lean into the study crowd with a coffee shop or tea house. having free wi-fi and comfortable seating is non-negotiable for them, and it turns your place into a daily hub for studying and socializing. don't forget the niche retail stuff either, like a secondhand furniture store or a resale bookstore because students are always on a budget and moving things in and out. bike repair and rental shops also thrive if the campus is bike-friendly.  
  
for non-retail options, consider turning the space into co-working offices or a tutoring center. colleges are often big research and innovation hubs, so you might find demand from startups or professionals who want to be close to the intellectual capital. a co-working space offers flexible, cheap office solutions for freelancers and new grads.  
  
finally, don't overlook seasonal or event opportunities. if your space is large enough, you could turn it into a versatile event venue for concerts, campus festivals, or even big study groups before finals week. you can also add value by making physical improvements like renovating common areas, improving curb appeal, or making the building more energy-efficient, which attracts better tenants and increases the property value over time.

hey everyone figured i'd share some ideas since i've been seeing a lot of empty space in commercial buildings lately, and if you bought too much you are def not alone. it's a huge expense but there are ways to offset the cost by renting out the unused bits.  
  
first thing, look at the outside space. if you have extra parking, a private driveway, or an empty garage that's just sitting there, list it on prked. it's an app that lets you rent out your unused space like a driveway or garage for people who need monthly or even hourly parking. it's seriously easy passive income because you just list it in minutes, set your own price and schedule, and you can turn the listing on or off whenever you want. a lot of companies or commuters need way cheaper, safer parking than a commercial garage and your space could be vip for them.  
  
for the indoor space you have a ton of options. you don't have to sublease a whole floor for a year. you can go super flexible with it:  
  
rent out your conference room or extra offices by the hour or day. small businesses, freelancers, and remote workers are always looking for quiet, professional spaces for meetings or just a change of scenery. you can advertise individual desks or ""hot desking"" for a monthly membership fee. you can even offer a small kitchen or coffee area as an added bonus.  
  
if you have a large open area, think about turning it into something completely different a few days a week. people will pay for things like:  
  
pop-up shops or small markets for local vendors.  
photography or art studios that need good light and open space.  
a private event venue for small parties or training seminars (especially after your normal business hours).  
  
for industrial or warehouse space, look into flexible storage solutions. if you have excess land, you can even rent out spots for people to park rvs or put their own self-storage containers for a monthly fee.  
  
just remember to check your lease agreement if you're a renter to make sure you're allowed to sublet, and look into liability insurance for whatever new use you choose.  
  
hope this helps you turn that empty space into an income stream.",1,1768026789.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

Both working corporate jobs, packed schedules, constant deadlines — and only **3 days in hand**.

Their simple request:

>

So we designed a **relaxed Shimla itinerary**, and honestly — their experience might fit you too if time is limited.

🚌 **Day 1: Leaving the Chaos Behind (Delhi → Shimla)**

After office hours, they boarded an **overnight Volvo bus from Delhi**.  
No airport stress, no driving fatigue — just a comfortable overnight journey while the city lights slowly disappeared.

By morning, they were in Shimla, already feeling lighter 🌄

  
🌤️ **Day 2: Action, Calm & Evening City Vibes**

After reaching Shimla, they checked into their hotel, freshened up, and **took proper rest**.  
Instead of rushing out immediately, they chose to start their day slow — something they rarely get to do back home.

Their first outing was to **Annandale Army Museum**.

Here, they didn’t just walk around — they experienced something unique.  
Under the supervision of army personnel, they tried a **guided shooting activity with a real rifle** 🎯.  
They learned **how to aim**, how to hold the weapon, and took turns shooting at targets.  
The experience felt thrilling yet safe — like a real-life action game — and became one of their most talked-about memories.

After the **adrenaline rush**, they wanted peace.

**So** next, they headed to **Advance Study (IIAS)**.  
They walked around the heritage building, sat on the green lawns, talked, laughed, and simply enjoyed the open space 🌿.  
No phones, no rush — just quiet time together.

By evening, they moved towards **Mall Road and The Ridge**.  
They strolled **hand in hand**, explored cafés, had coffee, did a bit of shopping, and watched the sunset paint the sky at The Ridge 🌅.  
The cold breeze and soft lights made the evening feel perfect.

They returned to the hotel relaxed and happy.

  
❄️ **Day 3: Snowy Roads, Valleys & a Peaceful Farewell**

The next morning, they headed towards **Kufri**.  
Here, they enjoyed light adventure activities, took pony rides, and soaked in mountain views 🐎.  
It was playful, fun, and not exhausting — just right for a short trip.

On the way back, they stopped at **Green Valley and Fagu Valley**.  
They slowed down, clicked pictures 📸 and enjoyed the silence that only mountain roads offer.  
This part, they later said, felt the most calming.

As evening approached, they visited **Jakhu Peak**.  
They spent time at the temple, watched the sun slowly disappear behind the hills, and felt a deep sense of peace 🙏.  
It was the perfect way to close their mountain escape.

That night, they boarded an **overnight luxury bus back to Delhi** — refreshed, recharged, and already missing the hills.

  
🌟 If you’re also planning a **short Shimla trip** and don’t want it to feel hectic, this itinerary can work beautifully for you too.

And if you ever need **help with hotels, cabs, Volvo tickets, or a registered local guide in Himachal**, you can always reach out — happy to share genuine, on-ground help 😊🏔️

1q8wwsa,https://www.reddit.com/r/parkingguides/comments/1q8wwsa/how_to_make_money_from_your_downtown_excess_land/,how to make money from your downtown excess land,"  
  
i saw a business owner post about this same thing last week, so i figured i'd share some ideas i came up with. having empty land near downtown is a huge asset because people need space for all sorts of stuff.  
  
the absolute easiest way to make money is to rent it out for parking. seriously, a lot of business owners with unused driveway or land use an app like prked for this. you just list your extra space on the app, set your own price and schedule, and it turns into passive income. people love it because downtown parking is such a chaos, and it's a super easy setup for you.  
  
if you want to get more creative with it, check with your city about temporary use permits.  
  
pop-up and event space: you can lease the land for seasonal things like a christmas tree lot or a pumpkin patch in the fall. or you can rent spots for food trucks to set up a small food court for lunch crowds. i've even seen people host farmers markets or art shows on empty downtown lots on the weekends.  
  
storage and leasing: if it's paved, you could lease a section of it to a quick-service restaurant or coffee chain that wants to build a small drive-thru. those usually only need a small parcel of land. another idea is to rent out industrial storage space for local businesses to keep construction materials or equipment.  
  
advertising: if your land is highly visible, you could lease a small part of it to a company for a billboard or a large sign. or if it's fenced, you can rent out spots on the fence for local business advertisements.  
  
don't forget that you can also rent it to a nonprofit for something like a community garden or a dog park, which might not make a ton of money but is a great way to improve community relations.  
  
hope this helps you figure out a great passive revenue stream.",1,1768026688.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

figured i'd share my two cents on owning a place near a college with good bike trails because it’s been a total game changer for me. it's one of those things that adds value in a lot of unexpected ways.  
  
first off, the lifestyle is just better. i use the path every morning to get coffee and it beats sitting in traffic. the mental health benefit from getting outside for even 15 minutes is real. plus, being near a bike-friendly community often means less noise and air pollution from cars, which is great for everyone. a lot of studies show that these greenway amenities actually increase your property value over time and make your house more desirable when you go to sell.  
  
on the money side, owning near campus is great for rental income. you have this constant stream of students, faculty, and staff looking for places. you can charge a decent rate because the demand is so high, especially if you're within a short bike ride of the main buildings. a lot of investors rent rooms individually to students, which brings in more money than a single-family lease. just be ready for a little more wear and tear than with a typical tenant.  
  
pro tip for passive income: if your house has a driveway or garage you don't use, list it on prked. a lot of people commuting to the campus for work, or even students who do have a car, hate the campus parking chaos and will pay for a safe, convenient spot on someone's property. it's an easy way to make some extra cash every month, and you set the price and schedule. it's super simple to set up and totally hands-off.  
  
the downsides are minimal but you should know about them. noise from student parties can be an issue, especially on weekends, so make sure you check neighborhood rules and lease agreements carefully. also, traffic during move-in and move-out in august and may is insane, but that’s pretty much the only time the congestion is bad.  
  
hope this helps anyone thinking about buying in a college town. it’s a solid investment.",1,1768026688.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

1q8wvgd,https://www.reddit.com/r/parkingguides/comments/1q8wvgd/how_to_make_extra_money_living_near_a_college/,how to make extra money living near a college sports stadium,"  
  
i figured i'd share some ideas for anyone who lives super close to a college sports complex or stadium because you are sitting on a gold mine for extra income and it's mostly low-effort stuff  
  
first and most importantly, your driveway is money on game days. the official stadium lots are a nightmare, always full, and way too expensive. a lot of people are using an app called prked to find parking in private driveways and garages that are much closer. you can easily list your unused driveway or garage spot on prked and make a bunch of passive income on every event day. for the people parking, it feels safer since it's on someone's private property, it’s vip parking for way cheaper, and they get quick in-and-out access with no long lines like the main lots. as the host, you just set your own price and schedule, and the setup is super easy.  
  
for your house, think about short term rentals. if you have a spare room or are willing to crash on a friend's couch for a night or two, you can rent out your whole place on airbnb for football or big basketball weekends. the prices for those days go way up because parents, alumni, and visiting fans want to be as close as possible. just make sure you check your local rules about short term renting.  
  
outside of parking and housing, think about the huge crowds. start a simple pop-up stand on your lawn. people will pay crazy money for convenience. you could sell pre-bottled water and sodas, maybe some hot drinks like coffee or hot chocolate if it's a fall/winter sport. you can also get a cheap face painting kit or temporary tattoos of the school mascot/logo, just be careful about any official trademark issues.  
  
finally, look into working for the stadium itself. they are constantly hiring for game day staff like ushers, ticket takers, or security. these are usually weekend jobs and can be 8-10 hour shifts, and you get to be at all the events for free while getting paid. even when there isn't a game, stadiums host concerts, conferences, and other events year-round that need staff.  
  
hope this helps you turn your location into a side hustle.",1,1768026571.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

The salad is spring mix, grilled chicken, broccoli, onion, and blue cheese dressing. Tonight I had balsamic & herb yellowfin and egg fried in extra virgin olive oil. 

For a snack I'll have a fruit or a hard boiled egg, if I get hungry. I usually just eat whenever I'm hungry and I feel like it, unless it gets too late. That's 2ish meals a day, and maybe a banana on the side.

I've been low-carb, low cholesterol for 4 days. I've been limiting red meat and dairy and avoiding wheat, pasta, bread, and sugary items. I still drink coffee and tea though (trying to switch to black). 4 days doesn't sound like a lot but I think this is the first time I'm actually in control of the food I buy and eat.

I work in a kitchen, and since I started I gained 20lbs. I was able to shave off 5lbs at one point but I think I gained more (I don't have a scale). I wasn't eating that terribly, just whatever I got from work. I guess the portions were just larger than what I was burning off.

1q8wuby,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1q8wuby/could_gastritis_turn_into_stomach_cancer_in_three/,Could gastritis turn into stomach cancer in three months?,"So 2025 has been fun for me lol. I've always been a really ""gassy"" person (mainly burping) even before all of this recent stuff. Being a smoker doesn't help either I'm sure. But I started experiencing some weird stomach and throat stuff during this past summer, and pestered my Dr's for long enough that they finally sent me for an upper endoscopy in September. During the endoscopy, they found gastric nodular mucosa (gastritis) and diagnosed me with LA Grade 1 Esophagitis probably from the gastritis. They biopsied both, and there were no signs of cancer. I was prescribed 40mg of Pantoprazole daily. I took the Pantoprazole for a little less than three months, and stopped cold turkey because the medicine basically made me stop pooping. I'd technically still have bowel movements, but I'd push very hard only to get a few small ""rabit turds"". The Pantoprazole did seem to help with the stomach and throat symptoms some, but I wouldn't say I was ""cured"" by taking it either, so I stopped taking it. 



I was taking no PPIs for about three-ish weeks and almost immediately started pooping regularly again and felt relatively fine initially. Then out of no where one day I got the worst case of nausea/indigestion I've ever had in my life. And there wasn't anything in particular I ate (I think) that set it off. I was burping constantly. I was so miserable, I went to the Dr and she prescribed me 20mg Omeprazole daily, so I've now been on that for about a month. 


I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed, and for some reason I decided I was gonna start drinking coffee around the same time I started taking the Omeprazole. I had no idea that coffee wasn't good for gastritis, and not only did I start drinking coffee, but I was drinking it pretty heavily daily for around a month, and mostly felt fine until this past week. I started feeling a little stomach/chest discomfort, and I thought maybe it was from the coffee and starting Omeprazole around the same time, so I stopped drinking coffee cold turkey. And man has this week been rough. 



I don't know if its the quitting drinking coffee or if the Omeprazole is finally ""kicking in"" after a month of being on it and I'm starting to feel side effects, but I've been having really bad stomach issues and just a slew of other ailments again this week after feeling pretty good when initially starting the omeprazole. Pretty bad Indigestion. Mild stomach/chest cramps/pain. Nausea. Loud stomach gurgling. Dizziness. Hot flashes/high blood pressure. I seem sweatier than normal. Bad anxiety. I've been trying to eat less and more healthy hoping that would help, but it really hasn't done much. Thankfully my poops have still been relatively normal and I have yet to vomit at all during this whole ordeal (going all the way back to the summer even, no vomiting!). Also weirdly, my esophagitis/throat symptoms have pretty much vanished since starting Omeprazole, which I guess is good. But all the other stuff I've been experiencing this week kinda has me freaked out, like did my gastritis turn into stomach cancer in the 3-4 months since my endoscopy?

Hey everyone!

I have a plot in mind which I am willing to work on with you and create fun, mainly longterm wholesome romantic Roleplay that we both enjoy.

So the plot is as follows: I am a young teacher at your kids school and you are a rich single parent (character specifications can be discussed, please come with your ideas). 
You have been divorced and lonely for quite some time.  

One of those days, you visit the school for a parent teacher meeting, your kid loves me a lot, I’m his/her favourite. You fall in love (how fast depends on you), we start bumping into each other for coffee or other places. You are drawn to my warmth, comfort and company. 

You want to be with her and spend time with her, more importantly you want to spoil her because you love her.

You even take her to events as your girlfriend not just because you wanted to present a good image to others but it made you feel good to call her yours.

The role focuses on your life story and falling in with her and wanting a family. Please don’t suggest ideas for my life struggle.

I have certain ideas about how I look in this but I would love to hear your ideas and make it memorable for you.

I have discord for longterm and I play regularly. So hit me up with your detailed ideas and hope to hear from you soon :)

1q8ws14,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/1q8ws14/am_i_just_complaining_over_nothing/,Am I just complaining over nothing?,"First of all I'm a 16 year old, I've seen my fare share of things in life already. Honestly I've just come to a complete stand still in my life. No matter where I look or what I do nothing seems to work. I'm searching for answers that don't even seem to be there.

It all started when I was born, cause pretty much as soon as I was born, my grandmother took my from my mother and then proceeded to basically cut her entirely out of my life. Thing is, I don't really remember any of it. I barely remember my mother from back then. But from what I've heard, my mother was a real piece of work. Got pregnant young, had me at 17 and well, I'm sure you understand where it goes from there. So I do mostly understand why my grandmother took me from her. But I'll cover more on that later.

So my grandmother then went on to raise me for the first 15 years of my life, fed me, the whole ten. And honestly despite what I'm about to share. I'm grateful for every last thing she ever did for me. Because without her I wouldn't be who I am today. Without any of these experiences I wouldn't be who I am today. Or where I am today.

So anyway, my grandmother raised me for a long time, basically my whole life up until this point, but while I was being raised, I wasn't always happy. I had always lived with this sense of unease and suspicion, but me being the naive child I was, I just pretended it was nothing. I believe most everything I was told.

I was always in trouble with her over something as simple as not speaking loud enough or mispronouncing words. And trust me, I'd often get hit for that type of stuff. This all eventually gave me trust issues and confidence issues because I never knew when I'd be hit for something so simple.
And I do want to take a moment to say, in no way was I some little saint of a child. I had a ton, and I mean a TON of my mother's genetics and obviously still do. But back then they were heavily influencing on me. I was manipulative, I lied a lot over small things that didn't matter, things I wouldn't have been in trouble for if I hadn't lied about them to begin with. I was sneaky and dishonest about stupid things. So yeah, some of this was my doing. But not all of it. And that's what I'm about to discuss.

See, aside from her hitting me for small things like talking to quietly, she'd get really angry if I didn't do things as fast as she wanted to, or if I didn't learn things as quickly as she wanted. And again, she'd hit me over things like this. Not all the time. But when she did. It was hard and quiet honestly, part of me resents her for it all.
Throughout my whole elementary school ages it was hit or miss, life was mostly okay, except for when I'd get in trouble. Most of the time it was for something I didn't do at school. And of course my grandmother and her two sons, my uncle's, would find out at home because of course the principals office calls them. Often times when this happened, they'd scold me, refuse to believe me and tell me It was my fault. Sometimes I'd even get beaten until I confessed to it.

Now again, I can't really blame them for not always believing me, as I stated before I was a very deceitful child, but still, I remember a lot of the things said to me. Even with the knowledge that I brought it upon myself with past behavior. It still makes me sick.

As I got towards my teenage years, I began to hit puberty, because... Of course I did. That's how that works. And with puberty came... Attitude. And with that came, a really angry grandmother who.. had no tolerance for it.

My early teen years, and I'm mostly referring to 11-13. Yes I know, technically 11 isn't teen, but just stay with me. It was bad enough when I got yelled at or hit for not speaking loud enough, which had already given me confidence issues when speaking around her or my uncle's to be honest. And early teen stages, I was and still am EXTREMELY moody. Waking up early was not good, and dealing with anyone felt like a burden. But when I get up in the morning at like 4-5 in the morning because my grandmother doesn't sleep and decides to call for me because she wants her four dogs taken out to go use the facilities, and I hit her with morning grumpiness, nah, all gloves are off. She'd chew my head off over that stuff, often times she'd throw objects at me.

Now right around when I was 10 though, she had started a business. A little kitchen, commercial grade, had to be kept up to FDA standards. Well she ran it successfully for 3 years, and trust me those three years were busy as could be. Most days we'd be packed with twenty to thirty customers in a building barely big enough for fifty people to fit. I hadn't even had a childhood, and now I'm already working a job. How fun.

During those three years, I was the dishwasher, the server, and sometimes even the assistant cook. Though not often. And also for three years. Yes. Three years straight. I had to get up at 4 in the morning to make a 45 minute drive with my grandmother to the kitchen so we could get started before the day began. And most days we'd be running from 4:45 AM sharp to 1:00 AM. And no, I'm not just making shit up. That's legit how it went for three years, and my attitude? Oh it got bad, real bad, so bad I almost lost my teeth or ended up with a mutilated face because of it. This one time I had given my grandmother attitude because she had just asked me to wash the dishes and then had asked me to immediately go do something else the had nothing to do with dishes. And I snapped at her, not aggressively per say, but definitely with attitude and so she grabbed my head and tried to slam my face into the industrial sink I was standing in front of. Luckily I only walked away with a semi harmed spine.

Now I'd like to stop at this point and point out that yes, what I'm describing is just how business works, but I'm also just telling you what I felt at the time. 

And at this point in my life I've experienced both physical and psychological trauma. A lot of which I won't mention because. Well.. there's a lot and I just don't want too, but besides getting torn down anytime I got excited or being ignored when I was talking or being forgotten out of spite, heck one time I was beaten by my uncle until I was bloody just because I took a sip of his coffee. I still had worse to come in life.


Like when I was 12, my uncle beat me up pretty bad. Almost broke one of my ribs, threw me around his house and even threw me through a fish tank, probably about 20 gallons in size. And why did he do this? Because I got framed for theft.

And yes I was actually framed, I know for a fact I didn't steal, because at the time I was already in deep crap with my family and pretty much everyone I knew was against me, I really didn't want to make my situation worse. But life sure did.
Because according to the owner of a local dollar general store, I had been stealing from their store for months. Which stuck me as odd because they actually had no proof. Their only words were we always have to try and find him on the cameras.

Which yes is accurate because I was always in a hurry to buy whatever my grandmother needed for the kitchen. That stuff was really time sensitive and couldn't just be squandered.
But of course since I was the only preteen with a big brown winter coat going in and out of the dollar general frequently, they just had to blame me. Which led to my room getting searched. Everyone's trust in me completely being diminished and my one friend I had managed to make in my whole life was now taken away from me. I was alone again. My family against me and... Honestly. This is one of the many times I contemplated suicide. Which has happened a total of 14 different times in my life due to many different things.

And then my life broke it's final straw when I was 15. One final tiny little pet peeve of my grandma's and she had just suddenly said she'd had enough of me and then kicked me out.

Like completely kicked me out. Sent me to live with none other than the woman she took me from. My mother. Who's definitely not the hero in this story.
No, no, no. That'd be too simple. Because of course my family can't just be decent. No, that's too much to ask. No, apparently my mother is every last little bit of the manipulative and self-centered woman my grandmother made her out to be. I've been living with my mother for less than a year. Roughly a year by now and we'll. There's so many lies and inconsistencies in every little thing she's told me. She lies over small things, she's heavily hypocritical, she's hyper judgemental and has this strange omnipotence to her that she never acknowledges.

Oh, and you want to know what my mother did while she had left me with my grandmother for 15 years? She found another man, ""my stepdad"" and had a daughter, ""my sister"" 5 years after leaving me with my grandmother. And then proceeded to forget about me and raise my sister.

Also I forgot to mention that my mother came back into my life when I was about 8, supposedly as a chance to take me back, or really just for me to get to know her and my sister. But uhh this reunion barely lasted a month or so of me and my sister coming over to one another's houses to see each other. Because my mother got too insecure, having seen me, grown up since she gave birth to me, and raised by someone else, so she just... Up and left me.

Keep in mind at that point in her life, she had the option, the capability to take me back. But she still just refused and left me for dead.

Honestly I don't even know what to think about any of this, am I just complaining over nothing? Is this valid to be stressing over? Is there something I'm missing? Because this has seriously been taking a toll on my mental health, I've been having trouble sleeping, I've been more alert than other nights, and I'm always exhausted nowadays, my body's been terribly stiff and I can't help but see the negative side of literally everything.",2,1768026266.0,LifeAdvice,3,0.75,False

I have few Pics in my profile, also feel free to snoop around! I want you to feel like you know me before I know you haha

Heyy everyone, Regardless of whoever is looking this I hope that you are going through a good day! As for me I did have a pretty good day!, I went to gym and read some books, went out with my friends for a really good cup of coffee with dark chocolate. now I am stuck between a movie and stock market analysis......😔 help a guy out here will you?

Imagine this usual scenario......you ever see posts/reels in Instagram/TikTok and wonder when do I get someone who's sweet, caring, possibly confident(definitely haha) and a guy who will be honest if the situation comes up?

just like I have told you in the post, I'm a big fan of life, I love adventures, spontaneous trips or just cuddling in the bed while watching Netflix, I'm mature enough to give you your personal space and support you at times where you need me the most and immature enough to do fight water gun battles with you lol(I will win haha).

I have lot planned in life, financial wise, I pretty much figured out my life and intellectually I feel like I'm smart enough to overcome situations, whereas both of them are good for me, I also want some unpredictability, some fun and someone whom I can call whenever I want, play any kind of game I want(planning to buy PS5, a laptop guy now) and honestly....wake up but still pretend to fall asleep for a few mins so that I can snuggle with you.

I like to watch sports, anime and Hollywood moves and K-dramas so that I can practice my rizz on you hehe(so dumb!) For the gamers out there, I just want to let you know that I have beaten Minecraft like 10 times over haha(I do want to play with someone together tho...house for both of us and all\~?)

**Some of my hobbies:** I play badminton, piano, music, games, I love tinkering with projects and stuff, currently working as a citizen scientist part time and a software engineer for a finance company fulltime(you got to do what you got to do...), I love to explore new places/long drives, vacations. I like hiking and When I am tired I mostly do Netflix and chill. Cook something new or just learn something new. I like stargazing and  paragliding, surfing and many more! I bowled a perfect set btw

I don't really mind the ages or anything like that and if in the off chance that I do get lucky, maybe we can start from LDR and end at ""I do""? hahaha

If you made it until the end thank you :) I'll let you on a little secret before you go!

Do you know you can't feel your tongue while smiling, haha got you! there you gooo ....smile a bit and have a nice day :)",1,1768026193.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

hey all, i saw a post complaining about wasted space on a corner lot right near the college and figured i'd share some ideas. that location is seriously a goldmine, especially with all the students and staff constantly needing spots and quick services.  
  
the absolute easiest thing you can do for passive income is rent out any driveway, garage, or even just a concrete pad if you have one. the parking chaos around universities is real. instead of having a space just sit empty most of the time, list it on an app like prked. you just list your extra space, set your own monthly price, and you get paid for basically doing nothing. it's super easy to set up and it's a great steady income source, honestly. people will pay more for a guaranteed, safe spot on someone's property. we're talking anywhere from $50 to $500 a month depending on your location and if it's a garage or just a driveway.  
  
if you have more space than just a single parking spot or are looking for something a bit bigger, here are a few other options that really capitalize on that corner lot visibility:  
  
1. seasonal vendors. corner lots on high traffic streets have great visibility. you can rent the space out for short-term seasonal sales. think christmas tree lots in december, fireworks stands around july 4th (some hosts make a few thousand for just a few weeks of rental), or maybe halloween costume/pumpkin stands in october. it’s not year-round but it’s a nice cash boost.  
  
2. small commercial rentals. check your local zoning first for sure, but a corner lot is prime for a coffee cart, hot dog stand, or a small snowball/ice cream business, especially when the weather is warm. you don't have to run the business yourself, just lease the corner space to a food truck or small vendor on a monthly basis.  
  
3. extra storage. if you have a full garage or basement you aren't using, people will pay to store cars, boats, rv's, or just their extra household stuff, especially during summer breaks when students go home. one source mentioned you could earn $75 to $470 a month for a garage.  
  
4. advertising space. if you have a wall or a clean spot, you could rent the space for a temporary or permanent billboard or sign for a local business. this is pretty low-effort once the contract is signed.  
  
the university area means huge demand for pretty much everything, so getting rid of that wasted space should be super easy.  
  
hope this helps you turn that corner lot into some easy cash flow!",1,1768026069.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

I'm planning a trip to Colombia and would love some feedback on my rough itinerary. This will be my first solo trip to Latin America, and I'm not sure yet if my plan makes sense. I'll be traveling for 20 days. I tend to get bored easily and prefer to stay busy most of the time.

16/03 – 18/03 | Bogotá
Arriving in Bogotá + one full day in the city. I’d like to visit the old town (La Candelaria), Paloquemao Market, Monserrate, and maybe do a bike tour or a free walking tour to see the main highlights. On 18/03, I would leave around midday to travel to Salento.

18/03 – 22/03 | Salento
Arriving in Salento and exploring the town.

Day 2: Valle de Cocora

Day 3: Visit a finca and a coffee plantation

On 22/03, I would leave Salento and travel to Medellín. Do you think it’s worth combining Valle de Cocora and a coffee plantation in one day to free up an extra day in Medellín?

22/03 – 25/03 | Medellín
Arriving in Medellín.

Day 2: Exploring the city (Comuna 13, city center, etc.)

24/03: Day trip to Guatapé

I’d also really like to go paragliding over Medellín. On 25/03, I would travel to Santa Marta.

25/03 – 29/03 (or 30/03) | Santa Marta / Lost City Trek
Arriving in Santa Marta, then starting the Lost City Trek the following day. I’m hesitating between the 4-day or 5-day hike, as the longer option seems less rushed and includes waterfalls. Any advice on this?

30/03 – 01/04 | Tayrona National Park
Visiting Tayrona. I’m unsure whether it’s better to stay overnight inside the park or do a guided day tour from Santa Marta.

01/04 – 04/04 | Cartagena
Arriving in Cartagena. Exploring the city and possibly doing a day trip to the Rosario Islands. Leaving Colombia on 04/04.

I would also really love to spend one or two days in Palomino, but I’m not sure how to fit it into my itinerary. Any tips on this?

Would you change anything in this schedule? Do you have any other suggestions, tips, or advice?
Also, is there anything special to do during Holy Week in Cartagena, and is transportation during that period reliable?",1,1768025914.0,solofemaletravellers,1,1.0,False
