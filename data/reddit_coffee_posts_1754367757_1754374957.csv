I recently have been trying to transition my regular Davidoff instant to French press Blue Tokai and I’m not sure what I’m doing wrong…

Whenever I brew some coffee from the grounded coffee from BT, Idk why I get a weird plastic or the packet after taste…honestly Idk how to explain it.

Also I have got the starter pack from BT, which contains 3 basic flavours.

Let’s be real for a sec.

This might run long. Might wander a bit.
But that’s okay.
Because if you’re the kind of person who feels a little too much, who thinks way too deeply during those brutally quiet 2:27 a.m. hours, who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly just wants something raw and unfiltered...then maybe this isn’t just a post.

Maybe it’s a tiny nudge from the universe.
A crack in the chaos.
A weird little sign that this might be your leap of faith.
One you didn’t know you needed, until now.

Because I don’t believe people stumble into our lives by mistake.
Some show up to test our patience.
Some derail us, turn everything upside down.
But then...
Some just feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways.
They arrive, and your soul exhales like it’s been holding its breath for years.
And quietly, something inside you whispers.. this, this is what I’ve been missing.


---

So hey,

I’m 26. I’m a doctor. From India.
And no, I won’t diagnose you unless you sneeze like a suspicious side quest and my reflex jumps into action.

But I’m more than a white coat and a stethoscope.
I’m a loud and proud nerd.
Not the cute, Pinterest-board kind.
The “quotes random Marvel lines in conversations” kind.
The “still mad about how Interstellar messed with time” kind.
The “loses sleep over fictional deaths and weird plot holes in sci-fi” kind.

I fall hard for characters that don’t exist.
I spiral into thoughts about time, death, memory, consciousness....... you know, the casual stuff.
Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I’m the main character in a noir detective story, trying to solve a case that’s equal parts medicine and existential meltdown.
Other times I vanish down a rabbit hole about marine biology, quantum reality, or nanotech in surgery because my brain whispers, dig deeper bro, we’re not done yet.

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a bit of Arabic (barely enough to survive a desert trip).
Oh, and I’m learning Klingon. Because curiosity and chaos kind of run the show up here.


---

Now there’s this voice in my head.

It isn’t always kind.
It’s definitely not gentle.
But damn, it keeps me going.

It says:
Think harder.
Don’t settle.
Fix what’s broken.
Show up even when everyone else bails.

It doesn’t care about grades or gold medals or what some fancy LinkedIn profile says.
It cares about truth. About purpose.
About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world.
Why grief hijacks the brain.
How trauma gets buried in bones.
What we’re really chasing under all this noise.

I’m not wired for surface-level anything. Never was.
I need depth. I need meaning.
I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.


---

So what am I even looking for?

Let’s keep it messy and honest.
I want someone real.

Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual “hey” like they didn’t leave your head spinning.
Not someone who opens with “wyd” and ends it with “lol.”
Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations.
The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

Someone who says, “I’m not okay, can we just exist side by side today?” without feeling like a burden.
Someone who hears a lyric and feels it deep in their ribs.
Someone who smells something random and suddenly time-travels back to a memory they can’t explain.
Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes, then goes quiet thinking about souls, stars, and why love always feels like both a war and a poem.

You don’t have to be perfect.
Just be human.
Just be honest.
Just... be there.


---

But let’s get even more specific.
Right now?
I want a study buddy.

Not the “let’s do one pomodoro and ghost each other for eternity” type.
Nope. I’m talking real. Consistent.
Like, actually showing up even virtually.

You don’t have to be in medicine.
You could be studying law, architecture, psychology, space dust, or just... life.
You could be healing. That counts too.

I want someone I can sit with  virtually while we both fight our own dragons.
No pressure to talk all the time. Just be in the same digital space. Two people grinding. Growing.

Imagine it 
Midnight hustle.
Lo-fi beats or soft rain sounds in the back.
Steaming mugs of chai or coffee.
Occasional breaks where we drop either the dumbest memes or the deepest truths.

We keep each other on track.
We say, “You got this. I’m here.”
We share that random quote that hits way too hard.
We remind each other why we started.

Maybe we make it fun 
Send a quote before we begin.
End the night with a trivia game or a challenge that makes us laugh till our faces hurt.
Doesn’t matter how.
As long as we grow. Together.

And who knows?
Maybe this study session... maybe this is our shared leap of faith.
The one that keeps us grounded when the world feels too loud.


---

Outside study time though?

Let’s build a weird little friendship.

Watch movies and analyze characters like we’re their therapists
Share playlists like we’re swapping pieces of our soul
Talk about mythologies, science, dreams, multiverses
Argue over which villain actually had a point
Speak in bad Russian or British accents because life’s too short for dignity
Send random voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels a bit too much
Make inside jokes that no one else would ever get
Create a chaotic but cozy digital home made of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos


---

And just a few confessions to keep it real:

I’ve imagined being an X-Men way more than I should probably admit
Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting for me
I’ve been broken. Really broken. But I never stopped showing up
I’ve walked alone more times than I’d like. Still do. But I haven’t stopped hoping
I don’t want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.
I want someone who knows how to sit in silence and still be there fully.


---

So if you’re:

A little cracked but still trying your best
Empathetic but forged of inner steel
Smart but soft in the ways that matter
Funny but carrying some quiet storms
Brilliant in your own messy, imperfect chaos

Then maybe just maybe  this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

This is my leap.
No filters. No flex.
Just me. Honest. Tired. Still dreaming.

So if any part of this made your chest warm or your brain go, same,
Send a meme. A quote. A lyric. A thought. Anything.

And if nothing else?

Let’s start with a study session.
Two nerds in different corners... 
Screens glowing. Hearts open. Minds focused.

Showing up.
Holding space.
Getting stronger.

Together.

Because in the end we’re all just stories trying to make sense of ourselves.

Let’s make this one a damn good one.

Still trying.
Still here.

We're from completely different countries and cultures. I get along super well with his family and friends, and I genuinely like the people in his life. But sometimes I feel like a bit of an outsider. He was born and raised in the same town, in the same house, with the same friend group since he was a kid. His coworkers, acquaintances, everybody is either the same or has been around for a long time, longer than I have. I feel like everybody has a longer history with him that I do (which is not wrong) but it makes me feel like I'm extra in his life — like everyone else fits more naturally into his world than I do.

Let’s be real for a sec.

This might run long. Might wander a bit.
But that’s okay.
Because if you’re the kind of person who feels a little too much, who thinks way too deeply during those brutally quiet 2:27 a.m. hours, who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly just wants something raw and unfiltered...then maybe this isn’t just a post.

Maybe it’s a tiny nudge from the universe.
A crack in the chaos.
A weird little sign that this might be your leap of faith.
One you didn’t know you needed, until now.

Because I don’t believe people stumble into our lives by mistake.
Some show up to test our patience.
Some derail us, turn everything upside down.
But then...
Some just feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways.
They arrive, and your soul exhales like it’s been holding its breath for years.
And quietly, something inside you whispers.. this, this is what I’ve been missing.


---

So hey,

I’m 26. I’m a doctor. From India.
And no, I won’t diagnose you unless you sneeze like a suspicious side quest and my reflex jumps into action.

But I’m more than a white coat and a stethoscope.
I’m a loud and proud nerd.
Not the cute, Pinterest-board kind.
The “quotes random Marvel lines in conversations” kind.
The “still mad about how Interstellar messed with time” kind.
The “loses sleep over fictional deaths and weird plot holes in sci-fi” kind.

I fall hard for characters that don’t exist.
I spiral into thoughts about time, death, memory, consciousness....... you know, the casual stuff.
Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I’m the main character in a noir detective story, trying to solve a case that’s equal parts medicine and existential meltdown.
Other times I vanish down a rabbit hole about marine biology, quantum reality, or nanotech in surgery because my brain whispers, dig deeper bro, we’re not done yet.

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a bit of Arabic (barely enough to survive a desert trip).
Oh, and I’m learning Klingon. Because curiosity and chaos kind of run the show up here.


---

Now there’s this voice in my head.

It isn’t always kind.
It’s definitely not gentle.
But damn, it keeps me going.

It says:
Think harder.
Don’t settle.
Fix what’s broken.
Show up even when everyone else bails.

It doesn’t care about grades or gold medals or what some fancy LinkedIn profile says.
It cares about truth. About purpose.
About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world.
Why grief hijacks the brain.
How trauma gets buried in bones.
What we’re really chasing under all this noise.

I’m not wired for surface-level anything. Never was.
I need depth. I need meaning.
I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.


---

So what am I even looking for?

Let’s keep it messy and honest.
I want someone real.

Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual “hey” like they didn’t leave your head spinning.
Not someone who opens with “wyd” and ends it with “lol.”
Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations.
The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

Someone who says, “I’m not okay, can we just exist side by side today?” without feeling like a burden.
Someone who hears a lyric and feels it deep in their ribs.
Someone who smells something random and suddenly time-travels back to a memory they can’t explain.
Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes, then goes quiet thinking about souls, stars, and why love always feels like both a war and a poem.

You don’t have to be perfect.
Just be human.
Just be honest.
Just... be there.


---

But let’s get even more specific.
Right now?
I want a study buddy.

Not the “let’s do one pomodoro and ghost each other for eternity” type.
Nope. I’m talking real. Consistent.
Like, actually showing up even virtually.

You don’t have to be in medicine.
You could be studying law, architecture, psychology, space dust, or just... life.
You could be healing. That counts too.

I want someone I can sit with  virtually while we both fight our own dragons.
No pressure to talk all the time. Just be in the same digital space. Two people grinding. Growing.

Imagine it 
Midnight hustle.
Lo-fi beats or soft rain sounds in the back.
Steaming mugs of chai or coffee.
Occasional breaks where we drop either the dumbest memes or the deepest truths.

We keep each other on track.
We say, “You got this. I’m here.”
We share that random quote that hits way too hard.
We remind each other why we started.

Maybe we make it fun 
Send a quote before we begin.
End the night with a trivia game or a challenge that makes us laugh till our faces hurt.
Doesn’t matter how.
As long as we grow. Together.

And who knows?
Maybe this study session... maybe this is our shared leap of faith.
The one that keeps us grounded when the world feels too loud.


---

Outside study time though?

Let’s build a weird little friendship.

Watch movies and analyze characters like we’re their therapists
Share playlists like we’re swapping pieces of our soul
Talk about mythologies, science, dreams, multiverses
Argue over which villain actually had a point
Speak in bad Russian or British accents because life’s too short for dignity
Send random voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels a bit too much
Make inside jokes that no one else would ever get
Create a chaotic but cozy digital home made of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos


---

And just a few confessions to keep it real:

I’ve imagined being an X-Men way more than I should probably admit
Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting for me
I’ve been broken. Really broken. But I never stopped showing up
I’ve walked alone more times than I’d like. Still do. But I haven’t stopped hoping
I don’t want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.
I want someone who knows how to sit in silence and still be there fully.


---

So if you’re:

A little cracked but still trying your best
Empathetic but forged of inner steel
Smart but soft in the ways that matter
Funny but carrying some quiet storms
Brilliant in your own messy, imperfect chaos

Then maybe just maybe  this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

This is my leap.
No filters. No flex.
Just me. Honest. Tired. Still dreaming.

So if any part of this made your chest warm or your brain go, same,
Send a meme. A quote. A lyric. A thought. Anything.

And if nothing else?

Let’s start with a study session.
Two nerds in different corners... 
Screens glowing. Hearts open. Minds focused.

Showing up.
Holding space.
Getting stronger.

Together.

Because in the end we’re all just stories trying to make sense of ourselves.

Let’s make this one a damn good one.

Still trying.
Still here.

1mi1jyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1mi1jyr/good_dates_but_texting_is_killing_me/,"Good dates, but texting is killing me","TLDR: 4'ish dates, no sex but constant physical escalation, but off-date communication is declining. I'm reading this as mixed signals. Help.

I \[34M\] met this girl \[28F\] through a dating app 3 weeks ago. She's very nerdy and feels a bit unusual than other women I've dated in the past. Let me describe the dates first:

First date lasted 4 hours, we had coffee followed by lunch. No kissing or any significant touching (I don't like doing that on the first date), we just chatted, it was a good time.

Second date: I invited her to a concert of a music genre she wasn't familiar with. She agreed to come. We sat on the ground and I noticed she was inching closer to me. I put my hand to her waist, she reciprocated. She also let me hold her hand. I felt her face pretty close to me while we were chatting. After the concert we kept holding hands looking for taxi. We parted ways with a hug.

Third date: Was a quick lunchtime since we were working close by. We chatted, but I intentionally did not initiate anything, don't really want to bring my personal life into the workplace.

Fourth date: Big one. Going to split to multiple paragraphs.

I picked her up from her place. Intentionally did not start anything in the car to see if she'd intiate anything. She did not. After I parked the car I asked for her hand, we held hands going to the restaurant. 

While we were sitting, she asked for my hand. Was a bit surprised (I've been the one to initiate everything to this point). I obliged. She told me I'm very handsome and have a beautiful smile. I went complete idiot here, wasn't expecting something like this lol. Rest of the dinner was just chatting.

We had a show to see after dinner but there were some time to kill. We walked around, and got into a bar. Had a few drinks. We were talking about partying wild, she told me she never did that except one time this year, and hesitantly told me she got blackout drunk for the first time due to a breakup she had this year. Yeah.

We went to the theatre to see the show. For 3 hours we held both hands, our legs touched. She was caressing my forearm, and towards the end of the show she put her hand to my inner thigh, close to my knee. While we were walking to the car, she was squeezing my arm and caressing my back from time to time. 

We got to the car and had a brief kissing session. After that ""lets see where this goes, one of my dogs can bark when they see you FYI"", which I understood as an invitation to her place. I held my hand on her thigh the whole way. 

When we arrived, she started saying goodbye. I said I could come up if she wants but no pressure, to which she said this was enough for the night. Didn't push, left it at that. We kissed briefly again (kinda uncomfortable when I have to move to the passenger seat from drivers) and she left.

All this sounds pretty good overall right? While this is happening, I feel like texting time is also degrading simultaneously. When we first matched she was pretty texty over the phone, but for the past few days, even before leading to the 4th date, she's been very slow to respond. I'm not sure if she's busy or not because there has been many times she responded virtually immediately. 

Last thing that happened today that's rubbing me the wrong way: I texted her to see if she'd be available for a quick lunchtime this week (she mentioned she could do that during the 4th date). She said weekdays are going to be pretty busy for her but she'll have time for the weekend. I asked her what time would be good for the weekend and she hasn't responded since this afternoon but I'm pretty sure she saw that message at least 5 times.

Its not an isolated incident. I arranged all 4 of the dates to this point and I feel like she took quite a lot of time to say yes to all of them. While there is something going on, I fear she might not be into this with enthusiasm and kind of just going along with it.

I really like this girl. Am I right to be worried?

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Phillies vs. Orioles: A Tale of Two Ballparks (One’s Just Better at Scoring)**

The Philadelphia Phillies, baseball’s version of a sledgehammer in a jewelry box, host the Baltimore Orioles in a matchup that’s as lopsided as a hot dog in a bun. Let’s break it down with the precision of a umpire’s strike zone and the humor of a mascot trying to karaoke “Bohemian Rhapsody.”

---

### Parse the Odds: Why the Phillies Are the Favorite (Spoiler: Math)

The Phillies enter this game as a **-550** favorite (decimal: 1.70), implying a **59% chance to win**. For context, that’s like saying the sun has a **59% chance of rising**—statistically probable, but still a safer bet than trusting your dating app’s “compatible interests” algorithm. The Orioles, meanwhile, sit at **+400** (decimal: 2.25), suggesting bookmakers think they’ve got a **31% shot**. To put that in perspective, it’s about the same odds as correctly guessing a stranger’s Spotify Wrapped genre on your first try.

Key stats back the Phillies’ dominance:

* **16-4 against AL East teams** this season. The Orioles? They’re the AL East’s version of a participation trophy.
* **129 home runs** and a .412 slugging percentage. The Phillies hit like a toddler with a candy stash—aggressively and without remorse.
* A **stellar bullpen** (MLB’s 9th-best ERA in save situations) to close out games. The Orioles’ bullpen? It’s like a group of overqualified librarians asked to run a demolition crew.

### Digest the News: Injuries, Fatigue, and Why the Orioles Should Bring a Towel

The Orioles are battling injuries and bullpen fatigue like it’s a Monday morning meeting at a coffee company. Their starter, **Jesús Luzardo**, has been a mixed bag against left-handed hitters, and while he’s a strikeout artist, the Phillies’ lineup has **129 home runs**—enough to make even the most optimistic fan question Luzardo’s career choices.

Meanwhile, the Phillies’ **Cade Povich** has a WHIP (walks + hits per inning) so high, it’s practically a weather forecast for the opposing offense. But here’s the kicker: The Phillies’ offense doesn’t need Povich to pitch a gem. They’ve got **Kyle Schwarber**, who’s hitting so hard, he’s be

So I showed up on time at their house and found the scene my mother has described many times: my father, half-naked, sitting at the kitchen table, sweating and staring blankly at the wall like a zombie. My mom was upset and worried, but she knew the drill.

Right now, my father is having breakfast and drinking coffee. He’s eager to leave for work as soon as possible, while my mom wants him to stay home and postpone the job until tomorrow. But to him, that's ""not an option.""

Here’s a mix of personal habits I’ve picked up, plus some tips shared by security-conscious users in our community. I don't follow *all* of these perfectly, but I’m working toward better digital hygiene — and thought this might help others too.

---

# 📱 1. Financial-Only SIM and Email  
Some users suggest having a **separate prepaid SIM** and email just for banking and OTPs.  
This minimizes exposure if your social or shopping accounts ever get breached. **(This part is still weird for me.)**

> ✅ Pro tip: Don't log in to Facebook, Shopee, or Lazada using your personal email or SIM.

---

# 🔐 2. Use an Authenticator App (Not Just SMS OTP)  
SMS is easy to spoof. Apps like **Google Authenticator** or **Authy** are safer.  
I use this for my Gmail and password manager, and some banks support it too.

---

# 💾 3. Don't Save Passwords in Browser  
Bitwarden, 1Password, or other password managers store your credentials more securely.  
Even just **avoiding “Save Password” in Chrome** is already a big step.

---

# 🚫 4. No Banking Over Public Wi-Fi  
Coffee shop Wi-Fi? Nope.  
Better to use mobile data or a VPN before opening any bank or e-wallet app.

---

# 🧊 5. Freeze Cards When Idle  
Some banks (like Maya, UnionBank, SeaBank) let you **lock your card** in the app.  
If you rarely swipe, consider keeping it frozen and unlocking only when needed.

---

# 📩 6. Think Twice Before Clicking Promos  
Even if it looks like it's from a legit bank, always check inside the app or website.  
No legit promo will ask for full card numbers or OTPs outside secure portals.

---

# 📲 7. Review App Permissions Monthly  
Go to `Settings > Apps > Permissions` and remove things like SMS or camera access from apps that don't need them.

---

# 🧾 8. Enable ₱1 Alerts + Weekly Transaction Checks  
Enabling **low-value transaction alerts** helps you catch suspicious activity early.  
A weekly review can reveal issues even before the bank notices.

---

# 🖼️ 9. Don’t Overshare Balances or Card Pics  
Yes, even if you blur the card number.  
Even timestamps, format, and design can give away info to skilled scammers.

---

# 🧼 10. Digital Hygiene Basics  
- Keep all apps updated  
- Avoid jailbreaking/rooting  
- Delete unused fintech apps  
- Only use Play Store / App Store  
- Never reuse passwords between financial accounts

---

# 📝 TL;DR – Simple Checklist

☑️ Use dedicated SIM + email  
☑️ Enable 2FA or authenticator app  
☑️ Use password manager  
☑️ Avoid public Wi-Fi  
☑️ Freeze cards when idle  
☑️ Watch out for fake promos  
☑️ Review app permissions  
☑️ Monitor all transactions  
☑️ Don’t post card info online  
☑️ Keep your device secure

I'm not perfect, but even adopting *some* of these habits has already helped me avoid phishing, fake promos, and sketchy transactions.

1mi1he6,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXPreppers/comments/1mi1he6/water_research_notes/,Water Research Notes,"I have a note about water that I’ve been adding to periodically and wanted to share, hope it’s useful/allowed. I did have some questions but I’ll post separately. These are more notes than a how to. Corrections/suggestions welcome!

# Water Quantity to Prepare
1 gallon per person per day (3,4,5,7,11, 12)

- 0.5 gallons per person per day for drinking (3)
- 0.5 gallon per person per day for cooking/sanitation (3)
- Have enough for AT LEAST 7 to 10 days (5,11), or 14 days (6,7,12)
- 128 fl oz in a gallon

Pets need an ounce per pound of weight per day, double to account for aftershock spillage (7, 14).

**Dog weight/water calculations** (11)
- 10-40lbs = 0.25 gallon/day
- 40-80lbs = 0.5 gallon/day
- 80-120lbs = 1 gallon/day

**Cat weight calculations** (11):
A 10-lb cat needs about 80oz. (¾ gallons of water for 10 days), you can adjust as necessary based on your cat’s weight

# Bleach
Bleach is referenced a lot in this section for water purification and storage. When we are talking about bleach, it should be plain liquid household chlorine bleach without thickeners, soaps, scents, or additives, and containing anywhere from 5% to 9% sodium hypochlorite (9), but usually at 6% sodium hypochlorite (6). Bleach can expire, so be sure you are using unexpired bleach (7).

# Storage

## Pre-Treatment and Shelf Life
- Bleach is not necessary for storing municipal chlorinated tap water (6 month shelf life) (6,7,12), or commercially sealed water (2 year shelf life) (6).
- Utah DEQ says to rotate water every 1-2 years (12)
- Water preserver is suitable for larger containers and can extend tap water shelf life to 5 years (7)

## Containers
- Fill full to minimize air space in container (12)
- FDA says bottled water does not expire, but containers will degrade and possibly allow contamination to seep in.
  - Milk jug type plastic lasts about 4 years in a cool basement.
  - Aluminum bottles last 10-20 years. (7)
  - Don’t actually use milk jugs to store water! Or anything that used to have harsh chemicals (6)
- Use food grade water storage containers (13)
- Recommended:
  - 2L soda bottles (3,6)
  - Reliance 7-gallon Aquatainer (11,14)
- Wash container with hot water and a tiny bit of dish soap. Rinse well (7,11). Sanitize with one of the following:
  - 0.25 tsp plain chlorine bleach per gallon water (7)
  - 8-10 drops plain liquid chlorine bleach in two cups water (6)
  - ¼ tsp of unscented bleach to 1 quart of water (11)
  - 1 tsp plain bleach per 1 quart water (13)

## Location
- Store in cool and dark conditions (6,12,13)
- Store in dry conditions (12)
- Don't store plastic containers directly on concrete (10)
- Mind the location so they don’t break in an earthquake

See also: Measurement Conversions

# Purification

## Pretreatment
Let water stand until particles settle then pour off clear water into clean container (7), or filter through a clean cloth, paper towel, or coffee filter (9).

## Bleach Treatment
If the water is cloudy, murky, colored, or very cold, add double the amount of bleach listed below (7,9)

| Water amount | Bleach Amount |
|--------------|----------------|
| 1 quart/1 liter | 2 drops OR 0.1 mL |
| 1 gallon | 8 drops OR 0.5 mL OR a little less than 1/8 teaspoon |
| 5 gallons | 40 drops OR 2.5 mL OR 1/2 teaspoon |

- After adding bleach, let stand 20 minutes (7) or 30 minutes (9)
- Should have slight chlorine smell (7,1). If it doesn’t, repeat the dosage and let stand for another 15 minutes before use (1)
- Chlorine bleach kills most viruses, but may not kill bacteria; boiling + bleach is effective (wait, shouldn’t boiling alone be effective enough for bugs?)
- Bleach disinfection is ineffective against cryptosporidium and has low/moderate effectiveness against Giardia (2)
- To reduce chlorine taste, pour between clean containers and let stand for a few hours (1)

## Iodine
- Add 5 drops of 2% tincture of iodine per quart/liter of water (20 drops a gallon (11))
- If cloudy or colored, add 10 drops. Stir and let stand 30–60 minutes

## Boiling
- Bring to full boil for 1 minute (7,9)
- At elevations above 6,500 feet, boil for 3 minutes (9)
- Boiling is the surest method to kill disease-causing organisms

## Filtering
- Use filter like LifeStraw or Berkey (note: Berkey has been recalled) (11)
- MSR Guardian filter removes viruses
- Gravity-fed systems preferred (10,11)

## Tablets and Solutions
- Chlorine Dioxide (AquaPure, Potable Aqua) - follow instructions (7,11,14)

## Distillation
- Distillation seems fuel and time intensive but yields high purity. However, not 100%, can still leave some impurities that vaporize at lower temperatures than water (6)
- Diagram (6): https://imgur.com/sXrTNNP

# Other Equipment
- Hose and coupling for water heater spigot (7)
- Empty, clean water containers with lids (7)
- Fuel to boil water (7)
- Skateboard, stroller, suitcase, wagon, etc. to move heavy water (7)
- Water filter for go bag (7)

I'm a current diploma of Auslan student at MTP Melbourne. 
We're covering Body partitioning at the moment and I was wondering if anybody has a more clear understanding of it.

Nothing against our teachers they're brilliant, but the two teachers I have seem to also be a little unsure.

From my understanding it's representing one entity with your body, through either (DS)Depicting Signs or (CA)Constructed Actions, then whilst maintaining the initial sign, producing a 2nd entity with your other hand.

My basic brain formula is:
DS+DS= body partitioning,(Maybe showing two people walking by one another)
DS + CA= body partitioning, (CA driving a car, then ds showing a car speeding past while maintaining the driving CA)

But CA+CA = not body partitioning(?) (so CA driving a car, then adding CA of checking your phone, or sipping a coffee fromt he cup holder)


I'm aware of how confusing this looks so if anybody does answer and needs clarification I can try haha 😅

1mi1ekq,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1mi1ekq/die_for_me_novel_read_online_for_free/,Die for Me Novel Read online for free:," Chapter One  
  
  MOST SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLDS I KNOW WOULD DREAM of living in a foreign city. But moving from Brooklyn to Paris after my parents’ death was anything but a dream come true. It was more like a nightmare.  
  
  I could have been anywhere, really, and it wouldn’t have mattered—I was blind to my surroundings. I lived in the past, desperately clinging to every scrap of memory from my former life. It was a life I had taken for granted, thinking it would last forever.  
  
  My parents had died in a car accident just ten days after I got my driver’s license. A week later, on Christmas Day, my sister, Georgia, decided that the two of us would leave America to live with our father’s parents in France. I was still too shell-shocked to put up a fight.  
  
  We moved in January. No one expected us to go back to school right away. So we just passed the days trying to cope in our own desperate ways. My sister frantically blocked her sorrow by going out every night with the friends she had made during our summer visits. I turned into an agoraphobic mess.  
  
  Some days I would get as far as walking out of the apartment and down the street. Then I found myself sprinting back to the protection of our home and out of the oppressive outdoors, where it felt like the sky was closing in on me. Other days I would wake up with barely enough energy to walk to the breakfast table and then back to my bed, where I would spend the rest of the day in a stupor of grief.  
  
  Finally our grandparents decided we should spend a few months in their country house. “For a change of air,” Mamie said, which made me point out that no difference in air quality could be as dramatic as that between New York and Paris.  
  
  But as usual, Mamie was right. Spending the springtime outdoors did us a world of good, and by the end of June we were, if only mere reflections of our previous selves, functional enough to return to Paris and “real life.” That is, if life could ever be called “real” again. At least I was starting over in a place that I love.  
  
  There’s nowhere I’d rather be than Paris in June. Even though I’ve spent every summer there since I was a baby, I never fail to get that “Paris buzz” as I walk down its summer streets. The light is different from anywhere else. As if pulled straight out of a fairy tale, the wand-waving brilliance makes you feel like absolutely anything could happen to you at any moment and you wouldn’t even be surprised.  
  
  But this time was different. Paris was the same as it had always been, but I had changed. Even the city’s sparkling, glowing air couldn’t penetrate the shroud of darkness that felt superglued to my skin. Paris is called the City of Light. Well, for me it had become the City of Night.  
  
  I spent the summer pretty much alone, falling quickly into a solitary routine: eat breakfast in Papy and Mamie’s dark, antique-filled apartment and spend the morning entrenched in one of the small dark Parisian cinemas that project classic films round-the-clock, or haunt one of my favorite museums. Then return home and read the rest of the day, eat dinner, and lie in bed staring at the ceiling, my occasional sleep jam-packed with nightmares. Get up. Repeat.  
  
  The only intrusions on my solitude were emails from my friends back home. “How’s life in France?” they all started.  
  
  What could I say? Depressing? Empty? I want my parents back? Instead I lied. I told them I was really happy living in Paris. That it was a good thing Georgia’s and my French was fluent because we were meeting so many people. That I couldn’t wait to start my new school.  
  
  My lies weren’t meant to impress them. I knew they felt sorry for me, and I only wanted to reassure them that I was okay. But each time I pressed send and then read back over my email, I realized how vast the gulf was between my real life and the fictional one I created for them. And that made me even more depressed.  
  
  Finally I realized that I didn’t actually want to talk to anyone. One night I sat for fifteen minutes with my hands poised above the keyboard, searching desperately for something even slightly positive to say to my friend Claudia. I clicked out of the message and, after taking a deep breath, completely deleted my email address from the internet. Gmail asked me if I was sure. “Oh yeah,” I said as I clicked the red button. A huge burden lifted from my shoulders. After that I shoved my laptop into a drawer and didn’t open it again until school started.  
  
  Mamie and Georgia encouraged me to get out and meet people. My sister invited me along with her and her group of friends to sunbathe on the artificial beach set up next to the river, or to bars to hear live music, or to the clubs where they danced the weekend nights away. After a while they gave up asking.  
  
  “How can you dance, after what happened?” I finally asked Georgia one night as she sat on her bedroom floor, putting on makeup before a gilt rococo mirror she had pulled off her wall and propped up against a bookcase.  
  
  My sister was painfully beautiful. Her strawberry blond hair was in a short pixie cut that only a face with her strikingly high cheekbones could carry off. Her peaches-and-cream skin was sprinkled with tiny freckles. And like me, she was tall. Unlike me, she had a knockout figure. I would kill for her curves. She looked twenty-one instead of a few weeks shy of eighteen.  
  
  She turned to face me. “It helps me forget,” she said, applying a fresh coat of mascara. “It helps me feel alive. I’m just as sad as you are, Katie-Bean. But this is the only way I know of dealing with it.”  
  
  I knew she was  
being honest. I heard her in her bedroom the nights she stayed in, sobbing like her heart had been shattered to bits.  
  
  “It doesn’t do you any good to mope,” she continued softly. “You should spend more time with people. To distract you. Look at you,” she said, putting her mascara down and pulling me toward her. She turned my head to face the mirror next to hers.  
  
  To see us together, you would never guess we were sisters. My long brown hair was lifeless; my skin, which thanks to my mother’s genes never tans, was paler than usual.  
  
  And my blue-green eyes were so unlike my sister’s sultry, heavy-lidded “bedroom eyes.” “Almond eyes” my mom called mine, much to my chagrin. I would rather have an eye shape that evoked steamy encounters than one described by a nut.  
  
  “You’re gorgeous,” Georgia concluded. My sister . . . my only fan.  
  
  “Yeah, tell that to the crowd of boys lined up outside the door,” I said with a grimace, pulling away from her.  
  
  “Well, you’re not going to find a boyfriend by spending all your time alone. And if you don’t stop hanging out in museums and cinemas, you’re going to start looking like one of those nineteenth-century women in your books who were always dying of consumption or dropsy or whatever.” She turned to me. “Listen. I won’t bug you about going out with me if you will grant me one wish.”  
  
  “Just call me Fairy Godmother,” I said, trying to grin.  
  
  “Take your frickin’ books and go outside and sit at a café. In the sunlight. Or the moonlight, I don’t care which. Just get outdoors and suck some good pollution-ridden air into those wasted, consumptive, nineteenth-century lungs of yours. Surround yourself with people, for God’s sake.”  
  
  “But I do see people,” I began.  
  
  “Leonardo da Vinci and Quentin Tarantino don’t count,” she interrupted.  
  
  I shut up.  
  
  Georgia got up and laced the strap to her tiny, chic handbag over her arm. “It’s not you who is dead,” she said. “Mom and Dad are. And they would want you to live.”  
  
  Chapter Two  
  
  “WHERE ARE YOU GOING?” MAMIE ASKED, STICKING her head out of the kitchen as I unlocked the front door.  
  
  “Georgia said my lungs were in need of Paris pollution,” I responded, slinging my bag across my shoulder.  
  
  “She’s right,” she said, coming to stand in front of me. Her forehead barely reached my chin, but her perfect posture and regulation three-inch heels made her seem much taller. Only a couple of years from seventy, Mamie’s youthful appearance subtracted at least a decade from her age.  
  
  When she was an art student, she had met my grandfather, a successful antiques dealer who fawned over her like she was one of his priceless ancient statues. Now she spent her days restoring old paintings in her glass-roofed studio on the top floor of their apartment building.  
  
  “Allez, file!” she said, standing before me in all her compactly packaged glory. “Get going. This town could use a little Katya to brighten it up.”  
  
  I gave my grandmother a kiss on her soft, rose-scented cheek and, grabbing my set of keys off the hall table, made my way through the heavy wooden doors and down the spiral marble staircase, to the street below.  
  
  Paris is divided into twenty neighborhoods, or arrondissements, and each one is called by its number. Ours, the seventh, is an old, wealthy neighborhood. If you wanted to live in the trendiest part of Paris, you would not move to the seventh. But since my grandparents live within walking distance of the boulevard Saint-Germain, which is packed with cafés and shops, and only a fifteen-minute wander to the river Seine’s edge, I was certainly not complaining.  
  
  I stepped out the door into the bright sunlight and skirted past the park in front of my grandparents’ building. It is filled with ancient trees and scattered with green wooden park benches, giving the impression, for the couple of seconds it takes to pass it, that Paris is a small town instead of France’s capital city.  
  
  Walking down the rue du Bac, I passed a handful of way-too-expensive clothes, interior decor, and antiques stores. I didn’t even pause as I walked past Papy’s café: the one he had taken us to since we were babies, where we sat and drank mint-flavored water while Papy chatted with anything that moved. Sitting next to a group of his friends, or even across the terrace from Papy himself, was the last thing I wanted. I was forced to find my own café.  
  
  I had been weighing the idea of two other local spots. The first was on a corner, with a dark interior and a row of tables wrapped around the outside of the building on the sidewalk. It was probably quieter than my other option. But when I stepped inside I saw a line of old men sitting silently on their stools along the bar counter with glasses of red wine in front of them. Their heads slowly pivoted to check out the newcomer, and when they saw me they looked as shocked as if I were wearing a giant chicken costume. They might as well have an “Old Men Only” sign on the door, I thought, and hurried on to my second option: a bustling café a few blocks farther down the rue.  
  
  Because of its glass facade, the Café Sainte-Lucie’s sunlit interior felt spacious. Its sunny outdoor terrace held a good twenty-five tables, which were usually full. As I made my way toward an empty table in the far corner, I knew this was my café. I already felt like I belonged here. I stuck my book bag under the table and sat down with my back to the building, securing a view of the entire terrace as well as the street and sidewalk beyond.  
  
  Once seated, I called to the waiter that I wanted a lemonade, and then pulled out a paperback copy of The Age of Innocence, which I had chosen from the summer reading list for the school I’d be starting in September. Enveloped by the smell of strong coffee wafting up from all sides, I drifted off into my book’s distant universe.  
  
  “Another lemonade?” The French voice came floating through the streets of nineteenth-century New York in my mind’s eye, jerking me rudely back to the Parisian café. My waiter stood beside me, holding his round tray stiffly above his shoulder and looking every bit like a constipated grasshopper.  
  
  “Oh, of course. Um . . . I think I’ll take a tea, actually,” I said, realizing that his intrusion meant I had been reading for about an hour. There is an unspoken rule in French cafés that a person can sit at their table all day if they want, as long as they order one drink per hour. It’s kind of like renting a table.  
  
  I halfheartedly glanced around before looking back down at the page, but did a double take when I noticed someone staring at me from across the terrace. And the world around me froze when our eyes met.  
  
  I had the strangest feeling that I knew the guy. I’d felt that way with strangers before, where it seemed like I’d spent hours, weeks, even years with the person. But in my experience, it had always been a one-way phenomenon: The other person didn’t even notice me.  
  
  This was not the case now. I could swear he felt the same.  
  
  From the way his gaze held steady, I knew he had been staring at me for a while. He was breathtaking, with longish black hair waving up and back from a broad forehead. His olive skin made me guess that he either spent a lot of time outside or came from somewhere more southern and sunbaked than Paris. And the eyes that stared back into my own were as blue as the sea, lined with thick black lashes. My heart lurched within my chest, and it felt like someone had squeezed all the air out of my lungs. In spite of myself, I couldn’t break our gaze.  
  
  A couple of seconds passed, and then he turned back to his two friends, who were laughing rowdily. The three of them were young and beautiful and glowing with the kind of charisma that justified the fact that every woman in the place was under their spell. If they noticed it, they didn’t let on.  
  
  Sitting next to the first boy was a strikingly handsome guy, built like a boulder, with short, cropped hair and dark chocolate skin. As I watched him, he turned and flashed me a knowing smile, as if he understood how I couldn’t resist checking him out. Shaken out of my voyeuristic trance, my eyes darted down to my book for a few seconds, and by the time I dared peer back up he had looked away.  
  
  Next to him, facing awa  
y from me, was a wiry-built boy with slightly sunburned skin, sideburns, and curly brown hair, animatedly telling a story that sent the other two into peals of laughter.  
  
  I studied the one who had first caught my attention. Although he was probably a couple of years older than me, I guessed he wasn’t yet twenty. He leaned back in his chair in that suave Frenchman manner. But something slightly cold and hard about the set of his face suggested that the easygoing pose was only a facade. It wasn’t that he looked cruel. It was more that he seemed . . . dangerous.  
  
  Although he intrigued me, I consciously erased the black-haired boy’s face from my mind, convinced that perfect looks plus danger probably equaled bad news. I picked up my book and turned my attention back to the more reliable charms of Newland Archer. But I couldn’t help myself from taking another peek when the waiter returned with my tea. Annoyingly, I wasn’t able to get back into the rhythm of my book.  
  
  When his table stood up a half hour later, it caught my attention. You could feel concentrated feminine tension in the air as the three guys walked past the terrace. As if a team of Armani underwear models had walked straight up to the café and, in unison, ripped off all their clothes.  
  
  The elderly woman next to me leaned in to her coffee companion and said, “It’s suddenly feeling unseasonably hot, don’t you agree?” Her lady friend giggled in agreement, fanning herself with the plastic-coated menu and ogling the boys. I shook my head in disgust—there was no way those guys couldn’t feel the dozens of eyes shooting darts of lust into their backs as they walked away.  
  
  Suddenly, proving my theory, the black-haired one glanced back at me and, confirming that I was watching him, smiled smugly. Feeling the blood rush to my cheeks, I hid my face in my book so he wouldn’t have the satisfaction of seeing me blush.  
  
  I tried to read the words on the page for a few minutes before giving up. My concentration broken, I paid for my drinks, and leaving a tip on the table, I made my way back to the rue du Bac.

 Chapter Three  
  
  LIFE WITHOUT PARENTS WAS NOT GETTING ANY easier.  
  
  I had begun to feel like I was encased in a layer of ice. I was cold inside. But I clung to the coldness for dear life: Who knew what would happen if I let the ice thaw and actually began to feel things again? I would probably melt into a blubbering idiot and return to being completely nonfunctional like I had been for the first few months after my parents died.  
  
  I missed my dad. His disappearance from my life felt unbearable. That handsome Frenchman who everyone liked the moment they looked into his laughing green eyes. When he saw me and his face lit up with an expression of pure adoration, I knew that no matter what stupid things I might do in life, I would always have one fan in this world, cheering me on from the sidelines.  
  
  As for Mom, her death ripped my heart out, like she had been a physical part of me that was dug out with a scalpel. She was a soul mate, a “kindred spirit,” as she used to say. Not that we always got along. But now that she was gone, I had to learn to live with the big, burning hole that her absence left inside me.  
  
  If I could have escaped reality for just a few hours at night, maybe my waking hours would have been more bearable. But sleep was my own personal nightmare. I would lie in bed until I finally felt its velvety fingers sweeping my face with numbness and I would think, Finally! Then a half hour later I was awake again.  
  
  One night I was at my wit’s end, head on my pillow and eyes open, staring at the ceiling. My alarm clock read one a.m. I thought about the long night ahead and crawled out of bed, fishing for the clothes I had worn the day before and slipping them on. Stepping out into the hallway, I saw a light coming from under Georgia’s door. I tapped on it and turned the doorknob.  
  
  “Hey,” Georgia whispered at me from upside down. She was lying fully clothed on her bed, her head at its foot. “Just got home,” she added.  
  
  “You can’t sleep either,” I commented. It wasn’t a question. We knew each other too well. “Why don’t you come out for a walk with me?” I asked. “I can’t stand lying awake in my room all night. It’s only July and I’ve read every book that I possess. Twice.”  
  
  “Are you crazy?” Georgia said, rolling over to her stomach. “It’s the middle of the night.”  
  
  “Actually it’s kind of the beginning of the night. It’s just one o’clock. People are still out on the streets. And, besides, Paris is the safest—”  
  
  “—city on earth.” Georgia finished my sentence. “Papy’s favorite saying. He should get a job with the board of tourism. Okay. Why not? I won’t sleep anytime soon either.”  
  
  We tiptoed to the front hall and, with a quiet click, eased the door open and shut behind us. Once down in the vestibule, we paused to slip on our shoes and then walked out into the night.  
  
  A full moon was hanging over Paris, painting the streets with a silver glow. Without a word, Georgia and I headed toward the river. It had been the center of all our activities since we began coming here as children, and our feet knew the way.  
  
  At the river’s edge, we went down the stone steps to the walkway that stretches miles through Paris along the water and set off east over the rough cobblestones. The massive squatting presence of the Louvre Museum was just visible on the opposite bank.  
  
  No one else was in sight, either down on the quay or up at street level. The city was silent except for the lapping of the waves and the sound of the occasional car. We walked a few minutes without speaking before Georgia stopped abruptly and grabbed my arm.  
  
  “Look,” she whispered, pointing toward the Carrousel Bridge crossing high over our walkway some fifty feet ahead. A girl who looked to be about our age balanced on the wide stone handrail, leaning perilously over the water. “Oh my God, she’s going to jump!” breathed Georgia.  
  
  My mind raced as I gauged the distance. “The bridge isn’t high enough for her to kill herself.”  
  
  “It depends what’s under the water—how deep it is. She’s near the edge,” Georgia responded.  
  
  We were too far away to see the girl’s expression, but her arms were wrapped around her stomach as she looked down into the cold, dark waves.  
  
  Our focus quickly shifted to the tunnel under the bridge. Even during the day it was creepy. Street people slept under it when the weather was cold. I had never actually seen anyone in it as I speed-walked through its putrid dampness to the sunlight on the other side. But the old soiled mattresses and dividers made out of cardboard boxes made it clear that, for a few unfortunate souls, the tunnel was a prime spot of Paris real estate. And now, from its otherworldly darkness came sounds of a scuffle.  
  
  There was a movement from the top of the bridge. The girl still stood motionless on the rail, but now a man approached her. He walked slowly, carefully, as if not to alarm her. When he got a stone’s throw away he stretched out an arm, offering the girl his hand. I could hear a low voice—he was trying to talk her down.  
  
  The girl whipped around to look at him, and the man held up his other hand, stretching both arms toward her, entreating her to back away from the edge. She shook her head. He took another step toward her. She wrapped her arms tighter across her torso and jumped.  
  
  It wasn’t really a jump. It was more of a fall. As if she was offering her body up as a sacrifice to gravity and letting it do what it would with her. She arced forward, her head hitting the water seconds later.  
  
  I felt something tug my arm and realized that Georgia and I were clutching each other as we watched the horrific scene. “Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God,” Georgia chanted rhythmically under her breath.  
  
  A motion at the top of the bridge drew my eyes up from the water’s moonlit surface, where I had been watching for any trace of the girl. The man who had been trying to coax her down was now standing on the edge of the bridge, his widespread arms transforming his body into the shape of a cross as he threw himself powerfully forward. Time seemed to stop as he hovered in midair like a giant bird of prey between the bridge and the black surface of the water.  
  
  And in that split second, a streetlight by the water’s edge flashed across his face. Recognition jolted through me. It was the boy from the Café Sainte-Lucie.  
  
  What in the world was he doing here, trying to talk a teenage girl out of a suicide attempt? Did he know her? Or was he just a passerby who decided to get involved?  
  
  His body sliced cleanly through the surface of the water and disappeared from view.  
  
  A shout erupted from underneath the bridge, and crouching silhouettes appeared in the murky blackness of the tunnel. “What the—!” Georgia exclaimed. She was interrupted by a flash of light and a sharp clanging of metal as two figures began to emerge from the darkness. Swords. They were sword fighting.  
  
  Georgia and I seemed to remember at the same moment that we had legs, and began sprinting back toward the stairway we had come from. Before we could reach it, a man’s form materialized from the darkness. I didn’t have time to scream before he caught me by the shoulders to stop me from mowing him down. Georgia froze in her tracks.  
  
  “Good evening, ladies,” came a smooth baritone voice.  
  
  My eyes tried to refocus from their goal—the stairway—onto the person keeping me from getting there. “Let go,” I managed to sputter in my fear, and he immediately dropped his hold. Stepping back, I found myself inches away from another familiar face. His hair was hidden beneath a tightly fitted black cap, but I would have recognized him anywhere. It was the muscular friend of the boy who had just dived into the Seine.  
  
  “You shouldn’t be down here by yourselves this late at night,” he said.  
  
  “There’s something going on back there,” Georgia gasped. “A fight.”  
  
  “Police procedure,” he said, turning, and applied light force to our backs, steering us rapidly toward the stairway.  
  
  “Police procedure with swords?” I asked, incredulous, as we jogged up to street level.  
  
  “Gang activity,” he said briefly, already turning to head back down the stairway. “I would get as far away from here  
as you can,” he called over his shoulder as he took the stairs a few at a time. He sprinted toward the tunnel just as two heads surfaced from the river near the bank. I felt a surge of relief when I saw them alive.  
  
  The guy who had steered us away arrived just as they reached land and pulled the jumper up to safety.  
  
  A howl of pain shattered the night air, and Georgia grabbed my arm. “Let’s get out of here.”  
  
  “Wait.” I hesitated. “Shouldn’t we do something?”  
  
  “Like what?”  
  
  “Like call the police?”  
  
  “They are the police,” she said uncertainly.  
  
  “Yeah, right. They sure don’t look like police. I could swear I recognized those two guys from our neighborhood.” We stood looking helplessly at each other for a second, trying to make sense out of what we had just seen.  
  
  “Well, maybe our neighborhood’s under the surveillance of a special undercover SWAT team,” Georgia said. “You know, Catherine Deneuve lives right down the street.”  
  
  “Yeah, right, like Catherine Deneuve has her own hot-guy SWAT team trolling the neighborhood for celebrity stalkers with swords.”  
  
  Unable to contain ourselves, we burst out laughing.  
  
  “We should not be laughing. This is serious!” Georgia giggled, wiping a stray tear from her cheek.  
  
  “I know,” I sniffed, composing myself.  
  
  Down by the river the girl and her savior had vanished, and the fighting sounded farther away. “See, it’s over anyway,” Georgia said. “It’s too late to do anything even if we wanted to.”  
  
  We turned toward the crosswalk just as two figures sprinted up the stairs behind us. Out of my peripheral vision, I saw them approaching at full-speed and grabbed Georgia’s arm to pull her out of the way. They ran past, missing us by mere inches—two huge men dressed in dark clothes with caps pulled down low around their faces. A glint of metal flashed from beneath one of their long dusters. Leaping into a car, they started the engine with a roar. But before they drove off, they pulled up beside my sister and me and slowed to a snail’s pace. I could feel them staring at us through the darkened windows.  
  
  “Whatcha looking at?” Georgia yelled, and they peeled off down the road. We stood there for a moment, stunned. The crosswalk light turned green, and Georgia hooked her arm through mine as we stepped out into the street.  
  
  “Weird night,” she said finally, breaking our silence.  
  
  “Understatement of the year,” I replied. “Should we tell Mamie and Papy about it?”  
  
  “What?” Georgia laughed. “And spoil Papy’s ‘Paris is safe’ delusion? They’d never let us out of the house again.”  
  
  Chapter Four  
  
  WHEN I STEPPED OUTSIDE INTO THE COMFORTING security of daylight the next morning, the events of the previous night seemed unreal. There had been nothing about what we had seen on the news. But Georgia and I couldn’t let it go that easily.  
  
  We discussed it more than a few times, although we got no closer to understanding what had taken place. Our theories ran from things as mundane as Dungeons & Dragons fanatics playacting outdoors to the more dramatic (and laugh-inducing) scenario of time-traveling damsels and knights.  
  
  Although I continued to do all my reading at the Café Sainte-Lucie, I hadn’t seen the mysterious group of gorgeous guys again. After a couple of weeks, I knew all the waiters as well as the owners, and many of the regular clients became familiar faces: Little old ladies with their teacup Yorkshire terriers, which they carried around in their handbags and fed from their plates. Businessmen with expensive-looking suits talking endlessly on cell phones and ogling every pretty girl who walked by. Couples of all ages holding hands under the tables.  
  
  One Saturday afternoon I was squeezed into my regular table in the terrace’s far left corner, reading To Kill a Mockingbird. Although this was my third time through it, some passages still brought tears to my eyes. As one was doing now.  
  
  I used my dig-fingernails-into-palm trick, which, if it hurt enough, could keep me from crying in public. Unfortunately, today it wasn’t working. I could tell my eyes were getting red and glassy. This is all I need—to cry in front of my regular café crowd just as I’m getting to know them, I thought, peering up to see if anyone had noticed me.  
  
  And there he was. Sitting a few tables away, watching me as intensely as he had the first time. It was the boy with the black hair. The scene from the river, with him leaping off a bridge to save someone’s life, felt like it had been nothing but a surreal dream. Here he was, in broad daylight, drinking coffee with one of his friends.  
  
  Why? I almost said it out loud. Why did I have to get all teary about a book while this too-cute-to-be-true French guy was staring at me from a mere ten feet away?  
  
  I snapped my book closed and laid some money on the table. But just as I started toward the exit, the elderly women at the table next to mine stood and began fiddling with their massive pile of shopping bags. I fidgeted impatiently until finally one of them turned around. “So sorry, dear, but we’ll be another minute. Just go around us.” And she practically shoved me toward where the guys were sitting.  
  
  I had hardly gotten a step beyond their table when I heard a low voice coming from behind me.  
  
  “Aren’t you forgetting something?” someone asked in French.  
  
  I turned to see the boy standing inches away from me. He was even more handsome than he had seemed from afar, though his looks were sharpened by that same flinty coldness I had noticed the first time I had seen him. I ignored the sudden jolt in my chest.  
  
  “Your bag,” he said, holding my book bag out toward me, balancing the strap on two fingers.  
  
  “Um,” I said, thrown off by his proximity. Then, seeing his wry expression, I pulled myself together. He thinks I’m a total idiot for leaving my bag behind. “How kind of you,” I said stiffly, reaching for the bag, as I tried to salvage any remaining scrap of confidence left in me.  
  
  He pulled his arm back, leaving me grasping air. “What?” he asked, amused. “Why be angry at me? It’s not like I swiped it.”  
  
  “No, of course not,” I huffed, waiting.  
  
  “So . . . ,” he said.  
  
  “So . . . if it’s okay with you, I’ll just take my bag now,” I said, reaching out and catching the straps in my hand this time. He didn’t let go.  
  
  “How about an exchange?” he offered, a smile twitching the corners of his mouth. “I’ll give you the bag if you tell me your name.”  
  
  I gawped at him, incredulous, and then gave the bag a hard tug—just as he let go. Its contents spilled in a heap across the sidewalk. I shook my head in disbelief. “Great! Thanks a lot!”  
  
  As gracefully as I could, I got down on my knees and began cramming my lipstick, mascara, wallet, phone, and what seemed like a million pens and tiny scraps of paper into my bag. I looked back up to see him inspecting my book.  
  
  “To Kill a Mockingbird. En anglais!” he commented, his voice tinged with surprise. And then, in slightly accented but perfect English, he said, “Great book—have you ever seen the film . . . Kate?”  
  
  My mouth fell open. “But . . . how do you know my name?” I managed to utter.  
  
  He raised his other hand and showed me my driver’s license, which featured an exceptionally bad head shot. By this point my humiliation was so great that I couldn’t even look him in the eyes, although I felt his gaze burning into me.  
  
  “Listen,” he said, leaning closer. “I’m really sorry. I didn’t mean to make you drop your bag.”  
  
  “Stop flaunting your impeccable language skills, Vincent, help the girl to her feet, and let her take her leave,” came another voice in French. I turned to see my tormentor’s friend—the guy with the curly hair—holding out my hairbrush, with an expression of mild amusement creasing his razor-stubbled face.  
  
  Ignoring the hand “Vincent” was extending to help me up, I staggered to my feet and brushed myself off. “Here you go,” he said, handing me my book.  
  
  I took it with an embarrassed nod. “Thanks,” I replied curtly, trying n  
ot to run as I made the quickest possible exit out of the café and onto the street. As I waited for the crosswalk light to change, I made the mistake of glancing back. Both of the boys were staring my way. Vincent’s friend said something to him and shook his head. I can’t even imagine what they’re saying about me, I thought, and groaned.  
  
  Turning as red as the stoplight, I crossed the street without looking their way again.  
  
  For the next few days I saw Vincent’s face everywhere. In the corner grocery store, coming up the steps from the Métro, sitting at every café terrace I passed. Of course, when I got a better look at each of these guys, it was never actually him. Much to my annoyance, I couldn’t stop thinking about him, and even more annoyingly, my feelings were equally divided between self-protective cautiousness and unabashed crush.  
  
  To be honest, I wasn’t ungrateful for the diversion. For once I had something else to think about besides fatal car crashes and what the hell I was going to do for the rest of my life. I’d thought I had it pretty much figured out before the accident, but now my future stretched before me like a mile-long question mark. It struck me that my fixation on this “mystery guy” might just be my mind’s way of giving me a breather from my confusion and grief. And I finally decided, if that were the case, I didn’t mind.  
  
  \* \* \*  
  
  Almost a week had passed since my standoff with Vincent at the Café Sainte-Lucie, and though I had made my reading sessions there a daily habit, I hadn’t seen a trace of him or his friends. I was ensconced in what I now considered my private corner table, finishing off yet another Wharton novel from the school syllabus (my future English teacher was obviously a big fan), when I noticed a couple of teenagers sitting across the terrace from me. The girl had short-cropped blond hair and a shy laugh, and the natural way she kept leaning in toward the boy next to her made me think they were a couple. But upon turning my scrutiny to him, I realized how similar their features were, though his hair was golden red. They had to be brother and sister. And once that idea popped into my mind, I knew I was right.

## Key Features Analysis

The ideal slim straight jean should offer a flattering fit without feeling restrictive. It's about finding that sweet spot where comfort meets style.

**Fabric Composition:** The material and its composition significantly impacts comfort, durability, and overall feel.

A premium slim straight jean in 2025 frequently utilizes a blend of high-quality cotton with a touch of elastane or other stretch fibers.Look for options crafted from at least 98% cotton to ensure breathability and a classic denim look. The addition of 2-3% elastane allows for a cozy range of motion without sacrificing the jean's shape. Some brands are also experimenting with innovative fabrics such as recycled cotton or blends that offer enhanced moisture-wicking properties.

**Wash and Colour Options:** The right wash can transform a pair of jeans from casual to dressy.

The best slim straight jeans in 2025 are offered in a spectrum of washes, ranging from classic raw denim to heavily distressed options. A dark wash, such as indigo or black, is often considered the most versatile, suitable for both day and evening wear. Medium washes offer a more relaxed, everyday vibe, while lighter washes can add a touch of summery flair. Color options now extend to more than just customary denim hues, with some brands offering muted greens, browns, and grays for a more distinctive look.

**construction and Stitching:** Durable construction will help your jeans last for years to come.

High-quality stitching and construction are hallmarks of a well-made pair of slim straight jeans. Look for jeans with reinforced seams, particularly at stress points such as the pockets, belt loops, and crotch. Durable stitching not only enhances the jeans' longevity but also contributes to their overall aesthetic. Premium brands frequently enough use chain stitching, a technique that creates a more robust and aesthetically pleasing seam.

**Fit and Taper:** The subtle details will separate a good pair of jeans from a great pair.

The defining characteristic of slim straight jeans is their fit, which should be tailored thru the seat and thigh while maintaining a straight line from the knee to the ankle. The best slim straight jeans offer a balanced taper that avoids being overly skinny or excessively baggy.A leg opening of around 14-16 inches (depending on waist size) is typically ideal. The rise, or the distance from the crotch to the waistband, is another crucial factor. A mid-rise is generally the most comfortable and flattering for a wide range of body types.

**Hardware and Details:** The quality of the small parts can be a tell-tale sign.

Details such as the buttons, rivets, and zippers can significantly impact the overall quality and appearance of the jeans. Look for jeans with sturdy metal hardware, preferably made from brass or stainless steel. A high-quality zipper should glide smoothly without catching.Rivets should be securely fastened and positioned strategically to reinforce stress points. Minimalist branding and subtle leather patches can add a touch of sophistication without being overly ostentatious.

Key features of exceptional slim straight jeans include:

* Durable fabric with slight stretch
* Versatile wash options
* Reinforced stitching
* Modern, flattering fit

## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about slim straight jeans.

**What is the difference between slim straight and skinny jeans?**
Skinny jeans are more fitted throughout the entire leg, tapering significantly at the ankle. Slim straight jeans, on the other hand, are fitted through the seat and thigh but maintain a straight leg from the knee down. This provides a slimmer silhouette than traditional straight-leg jeans but without the constricting feel of skinny jeans.

**What type of shoes should I wear with slim straight jeans?**
Slim straight jeans are incredibly versatile when it comes to footwear. They can be paired with a wide range of shoe styles, including sneakers, boots, loafers, and dress shoes. For a casual look, opt for sneakers or chukka boots. For a more dressed-up ensemble, try loafers or dress boots. The key is to choose shoes that complement the overall style and wash of the jeans.

**how do I find the right size in slim straight jeans?**
It's crucial to measure your waist and inseam accurately before purchasing slim straight jeans. Refer to the brand's size chart to determine the best fit. Keep in mind that sizing can vary between brands, so it's always a good idea to try on a few different sizes to find the perfect fit. Pay attention to the rise and leg opening to ensure that the jeans provide the desired silhouette. If possible, read customer reviews online to learn more about the sizing and fit of specific brands and styles.

**How should I care for my slim straight jeans to ensure they last?**
To prolong the lifespan of your slim straight jeans, it's recommended to wash them sparingly, ideally only when they are visibly dirty. When washing, turn them inside out and use cold water and a gentle detergent. Avoid using bleach or fabric softener, as these can damage the fabric. Hang them to dry rather of using a dryer,which can cause shrinkage and fading. Following these simple care tips can help to keep your jeans looking their best for years to come.

Im traveling to Paris in September for Paris design week and staying for a little about 10 days or so. this will be my 3rd time visiting but first time traveling alone. My company has an office based in Le Marais so I’ll be commuting there during the day but want to spend evenings out and about.

I’ve stayed in the 14th before and loved it but it’s expensive and a little further than I’d prefer to be this time. I definitely don’t want to be anywhere crazy touristy but having coffee places and bars nearby to walk to would be wonderful, and I’m fine with biking around a bit.

My current contenders are in the 19th near Menilmontant, the 18th near Jules Joffrin, and Montparnasse near Luxembourg - but really I’m open to any suggestions or areas to avoid.

Yeah I said it. It’s the biggest IT services exporter by value and that’s great… until you look at what it’s doing to life in Indian cities.

The IT boom has basically created a mini dollar economy inside India. Folks earning US level salaries are living here, spending here and naturally driving prices through the roof. Housing gone insane. Services overpriced. A cup of coffee that used to be ₹50 is suddenly ₹300 because the café knows some techie will still pay it without blinking.

Meanwhile the majority of people earning at normal Indian salaries are stuck paying these inflated prices without the inflated income. It’s like running two separate economies in the same city and surprise surprise — the one in rupees is losing.

I noticed this in myself when I started using an AI platform for 12 hours a day (yeah I’m already a losing case at this point), using it when I first woke up, between meals, during classes. When my friends ask me to go outside with them or get in the game, I just come up with an excuse not to. My grades started dropping and my smell became like delayed chores and it started making more and more isolated from real life and lonely

I always dreamed of owning a late-night coffee shop. Running it alone at midnight. Quiet music, some lofi maybe. A soft atmosphere (thanks to Coffee Talk lol).
And suddenly, AI made that fantasy feel real… and because of that, real life started to feel pointless.
I’d just lie in bed all day, barely making myself food, no sun, no movement. It was like the fantasy became my comfort coffin. And that’s why I’m making this post.

Yes, you can engage in a roleplay. You can cry. You can let it teach you actual things in your life. You can let it make you happy, mad, sad  all of those emotions.
But don’t let it consume you so deeply that you stop putting effort into your real life.
Don’t abandon your future for a fantasy that already lives inside you.

This sounds like total loser lore which I am for dropping my life after achieving a fantasy but I stopped doing this.

How did I stop feeling that way about my life?
By trying to make my fantasy into actual reality.

This coffee house I’m always fantasizing about will become real one day, if I keep working hard on myself.
If I keep pushing forward.

That doesn’t mean dropping AI — it just means putting a line between what’s fake and what’s real. ",1,1754373389.0,lonely,0,1.0,False

1mi14hz,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1mi14hz/im_sorry_i_let_busy_become_never/,I'm sorry I let 'busy' become 'never',"Hey,

It’s funny how time works. For years, you were my person. My late-night-talks-on-the-kitchen-floor person, my ""let's drive two hours for a concert"" person, my ""I don't have to explain, you just get it"" person. And then, we graduated. Life happened.

I got that job, you moved for that relationship. We promised to keep in touch, and we meant it. We really did.

But ""busy"" is such a convenient excuse, isn't it? It starts with a missed call. ""I'll phone them back tomorrow."" Then it's a text you read and forget to reply to. Weeks turn into months. You see something that reminds you of them—a stupid meme, a song on the radio—and you think, ""I should reach out."" But the longer you wait, the heavier the silence gets. The more you feel like you need a ""good reason"" to break it.

And then one day, you realize that ""busy"" has slowly, quietly, become ""never.""

I was in a coffee shop this morning and heard that indie band you forced me to listen to all that one summer. The one I pretended to hate but secretly loved. And it all just came rushing back. Your ridiculous, booming laugh. The way you’d get so passionate about a movie you loved. The feeling that, with you, it was okay to not have it all figured out.

I don't even know where you are now. I hope life is being kind to you. I hope you found your happiness, and that you're still making people listen to that band.

I just wanted to put this out into the universe, I guess. To say I'm sorry. And to say thank you. You were the best part of that chapter of my life.",1,1754373076.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

Choose a table cloth material that is inherently wrinkle-resistant or easy to iron. Polyester and some linen blends offer excellent wrinkle resistance.

1mi114a,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1mi114a/i_made_a_dare_with_someone_in_middle_school_for/,"I made a dare with someone in middle school for $100, and I never gave that $100 to him. It's been 8 years.","I (20F) transferred to a new school back in my 7th grade year when I was 12 years old. My schedule consisted of the usual middle school things you could expect: English, Math, History, and Art (etc). I had my art class on A days, and in the beginning of the semester, we started working with different types of paints. We began the first month or so working with acrylic paints to get used to the texture and techniques or whatever. Now, I was a very extroverted person back in my early teens, so I had no problem with talking with other people around me and making some funny conversations. I befriended this one boy (we'll call him Jack) who sat next to me. He was a typical 12 year old boy who didn't really have a big friend group. Jack and I were painting and every student had their own water cups to rinse our brushes from the paint. 

I bet you already know where this is going.

As I was painting, I looked over at my water cup and came up with the bright idea to dare Jack to drink from the cup. I turned to him and go ""Hey, I dare you $100 dollars to drink the paint water."" He was doing the obvious ""Oh my god no that's so bad."" and ""I can't drink that."" I kept pushing him to do so, saying it's for $100 and you can't pass it up. Quite a few students around us heard the commotion and wanted to know what we were talking about, because middle school students feed off of loud drama. I told them I dared Jack to drink from the paint water cup, and everyone did a deep ""Oooooo"" with their hand up to their mouth because of how insane of a dare that was.

I came up with the stupidest reasons to get him to drink it, one of them was ""Oh come on, it looks coffee colored!"" (Because I was using brown toned paints that made it look like creamer and coffee). The final thing I said that was the convincing factor for him was saying that the paint was non-toxic (which I can tell you it actually was, because I looked at the paint bottles to make sure. I didn't want to actually kill the guy or anything). While looking at the water cup, Jack goes ""I mean it ***is*** non toxic."" with a smirk on his face. 

There was a room that was connected to the classroom that had all of the art supplies, and a sink as well to get more water for your cups. Suddenly, he got up WITH the paint water cup in hand, and started walking towards the back room sink. I, along with a handful of students, followed him to see if he was actually going to do it. He contemplated for a solid minute with everyone behind going ""Oh my god are you actually going to do it?"" And after about 5 minutes... he drank a big gulp of it. 

Everyone gasped and started laughing and being like ""NO WAY YOU JUST DID THAT."" We all ran out of the back room in shock that he actually drank the water. Our teacher heard the commotion and started walking to the back room, so we all pretended nothing happened and went back to our seats to continue painting. He sat back down next to me, and went ""That was awful what the fuck. It was worth the hundred."" I nervously laughed because... I didn't have $100 on me. Or at all. I was a 12 year old girl who just wanted to be funny, I didn't ACTUALLY EXPECT him to do it. I kinda just gave him a slight nod as a ""Yeah you'll totally get that hundred hahaha!"" 

After multiple days went by, we passed each other in the hall during passing time, and he would always ask me very quickly before we walked too far passed, ""So where's my hundred?"" and I hit him back with a ""I'll get it soon don't worry!"" Knowing that was 100% a lie. Now 8 years later, and I never once gave him that $100 and it still makes me laugh but also makes me feel so so so guilty knowing I'll never see him again, and he will never get that hundred.",0,1754372722.0,confession,2,0.3,False

His family is from Washington DC visiting my hometown for two weeks. When we initially talked I asked for more than what they were offering (15/hr) as my rates start at 21/hr (my area typically asks between 20-30/hr, for reference my other babysitting gigs are typically 25/hr for one kid.) They said their budget was 525/week but they could extend my break and that the kid was a sweet and easy guy. They mentioned he was a bit clingy and had a light allergy but otherwise was good. Well, I get there and a couple of things stand out to me
- I had assumed this was some middle class family on vacation. Definitely upper middle class. Renting a huge gorgeous house, fun snack options, etc. It felt off considering I’m making below minimum wage from where they’re from.
- The kid had 2 epi pens ‘just in case’ with a supposedly minor allergy 
- kid is clingy to his parents. I was expecting this for the first half of the day, but no. 8:30-1 and 3-5:30 we were next to either his mom or dad. He wouldn’t go outside the house, even when he could see his dad. I’m fine with playing in front of parents for a little, but 6.5 hours of magnet tiles next to dad was too much.
- For potty training they have him try to go to the potty every 30 minutes. This was not only not mentioned, but is also highly disruptive to any play flow that we have going on. Had I been informed of this I would have insisted on a higher rate.
- The mom asked me to stay an extra half hour, I agreed only later realizing that I might not be paid for this as we agreed on a weekly amount given the hours above, meaning we are back to 15/hr.
- Maybe I’m spoiled with amazing families, but the parents felt fairly cold to me. They offered me coffee and then no other non-child-related interaction. It felt terribly transactional in a way I’m not used to.

I know childcare is expensive and hard to find. I know I agreed to hang out with this kiddo for two weeks. But this doesn’t feel like what I agreed to and I am frankly not enjoying myself. WIBTA if I gave them a 2-day notice at the end of tomorrow if nothing changes? Or perhaps if I told them I can only do 8:30-1 going forward?",3,1754372589.0,AITAH,6,1.0,False

I work at a property that does not offer complimentary coffee; we sell Starbucks. A guy came up to ask for coffee while it was being brewed, an hour before breakfast opened (this is fine, get your coffee whenever, as long as you're willing to wait for it to brew.) The breakfast attendant told us that it would be a couple minutes, so the guy walked outside. He came back probably like 1 minute and 50 seconds later to ask for the coffee. I told him I'd check, because breakfast didn't start for another hour, so I wasn't sure if the attendant had been busy with other prep to get coffee out ASAP. Plus the fact that she wouldn't be able to charge him for the coffee on her side, but I could put it on his room for him no problem after getting it for him. I believe that was the first offense because he was clearly put off by that lol. So I go over and see the coffee is done and available for him. Flashback to last week: I had a lady ask if we sell dark, medium or light roast- which was a good question for someone who serves Starbucks sometimes but was never trained on Starbucks nor actually drinks Starbucks drip coffees to know what ""Veranda"" means. So because of that lady, I learned that we typically sell light and dark. I told THIS guy that we had only medium right now, and he shrugged that info off. Like, okay yeah sorry for the info you didn't ask for!! I got it. So then I move on and ask, ""what size would you like?""  (Reminder that it's Starbucks and we DO offer the same fancy small, medium & large options for the hot drinks as real Starbucks would. We only offer small for iced but that's beside the point lol.) Here's where I'm like ""???"" Because his response was ""I don't care."" Ummm that took me off guard but he might not have known the sizes of course, so I spew off the options in my Starbucks language. He repeats that he doesn't care! So I then told him ""well it's for purchase and they are all different prices"" and his response was literally an exasperated ""I. DON'T. CARE!!??"" I could tell he wanted to say ""I. DON'T. CARE. JUST GET ME COFFEE!"" It was like I aged this guy 5 years. So I started pouring coffee in a large cup for him and as I do so, I ask if he needs room for cream and sugar, and he angrily yells ""NO."" Cool so I'm still pouring the coffee and then he all of a sudden goes, ""THAT'S ENOUGH."" which was so crazy because he didn't let me pour more than a medium sized coffee. 

This was insane and it wasn't even AT the desk

She was only seconds out of a very light, fitful sleep, but she knew that the nightmares had followed her effortlessly right into the real world. The draug. They weren't vampires; they were something else, something that moved through water, formed out of it, dragged vampires down to a slow and awful death.  
  
  A week ago, she'd have laughed something like that off as a bad joke, but then she'd seen them come for Morganville, Texas. Come with the rains that rarely fell in this desert-locked, sunbaked town where the vampires had, finally, made their last stand.  
  
  Today she woke up with the blind and panicked knowledge that no matter how bad the world was with vampires in it, a world that held the draug was vastly worse. They'd come to Morganville, infiltrated stealthily, built their numbers until they were ready to fight . . . until they could sing their awful song that somehow, impossibly, was also beautiful and irresistible. To humans as well as to vamps.  
  
  The strongest of Morganville's vampires had gone up against it, and scored a few hits . . . but not without cost. Amelie, the ice-queen ruler of the town, had been bitten; without her, it was all going to get worse, fast.  
  
  Michael was still thrashing and making that terrible sound, and it came to Claire gradually that instead of cowering here while her brain caught up, she should go to him. Help him.  
  
  And then the lights brightened from dim to dazzling in the big carpeted room, and she saw her boyfriend, Shane Collins, standing in the doorway, looking first at her, then over at Michael, who was still desperately struggling against . . . nothing.  
  
  Against his nightmare.  
  
  Claire pulled in a deep breath, shut her eyes for a second, then made the OK sign to Shane; he nodded back and went to their friend's side. Michael was tangled up in the shredded remains of his sleeping bag, still flailing and, as far as Claire could tell, still dead asleep. Shane crouched down and, after a brief hesitation, reached out and put his hand on Michael's shoulder.  
  
  Michael came awake instantly-vampire speed. In one blurred second he was sitting up, one hand wrapped around Shane's wrist, eyes open and blazing red, fangs down and catching the light on razor-sharp points and edges.  
  
  Shane didn't move, though he might have rocked back on his heels just a little. That was better than Claire could have done; she'd have fallen backward at the very least, and Michael would probably have broken her wrist-not intentionally, but sorry didn't matter much when it came to shattered bones.  
  
  ""Easy,"" Shane said in a low, calm voice. ""Easy, man-you're safe. You're safe now. It's over. Nobody's going to hurt you here. ""  
  
  Michael froze. The red died down to embers in his eyes, and when he blinked it was gone, replaced by cool blue. He looked pale, but that was normal for him now. Claire saw his throat work as he swallowed, and then he shakily pulled in a breath and let go of Shane's wrist. ""God,"" he whispered, and shook his head. ""Sorry, man. ""  
  
  ""No drama,"" Shane said. ""Bad one, right?""  
  
  Michael didn't respond to that immediately. He was staring off in the middle distance. She didn't need to wonder what his nightmare had been about . . . . It would have been about being trapped in the Morganville Civic Pool, anchored to the bottom under that murky, poisoned water . . . being fed upon by the draug. Drained slowly, and alive, by creatures that found vampires as delicious as candy. Creatures that were, right now, invading and taking everything they could. Including every juicy vampire snack, straight to the bottom of whatever pool of filthy water they were hiding in.  
  
  There were, Claire realized, still tiny red marks all over Michael's skin, like pinpricks . . . fading, but not quite gone. He was healing slower than usual-or he'd been hurt far more seriously than it had seemed. ""Yeah,"" he finally said. ""I was dreaming I was still in the pool, and . . . "" He didn't go on, but he didn't need to; Claire had been there, seen it. Shane had not only seen but felt it-he'd dived in to save lives. Vampire lives, but lives all the same. The draug had attacked him, too, and his skin had the reddish tint of broken capillaries to prove it.  
  
  Claire had a vivid, flashback-quality vision of the pool . . . that insanely creepy underwater garden of trapped vampires, tied down, stunned and helpless as the draug sucked away their strength and life. It had been one of the worst, most horrifying things she'd ever seen, and it had also outraged her on a very deep, primal level. Nobody deserved that. Nobody.  
  
  ""It was real bad. "" Shane nodded in agreement with Michael. ""And I wasn't in there nearly as long. You hang in there, Mikey. "" He reached out again and squeezed Michael's shoulder briefly, then rose to a standing position. ""You feel the need to scream like a girl, let it out, dude. No judging. ""  
  
  Michael groaned and rubbed his hand over his face. ""Screw you, Shane. Why do I keep you around, anyway?""  
  
  ""Hey, you need somebody to keep you humble, rock star. Always have. ""  
  
  Claire smiled then, because Michael was starting to sound like his old self again. Shane could always do that, to any of them-a flip remark, a casual insult, and it was all okay again. Normal life.  
  
  Even when nothing at all was normal. Nothing.  
  
  Now that her panic was receding, she wondered what time it was-the room gave no real hint of whether it was day or night. They had evacuated to the Elders' Council building, which-like most vampire buildings-didn't much favor windows. What it did have was plenty of sleeping bags, a few rollaway beds, and lots of empty space; the vampires, apparently, were all about disaster planning, which didn't surprise her at all, really. They'd had thousands of years in which to learn how to anticipate trouble and what to have together to meet (or avoid) it.  
  
  Right now, she, Michael, and Shane were the only ones sleeping in the room, which could have held at least thirty without feeling crowded.  
  
  There was no sign of their fourth housemate, Michael's girlfriend, Eve. Her sleeping bag, which had been near Michael's, was kicked off to the side.  
  
  ""Shane,"" Claire said, her fear getting another kick start. ""Eve's missing. ""  
  
  ""Yeah, I know. She's up,"" he said, ""organizing coffee, believe it or not. You can take the barista out of the shop, but . . . ""  
  
  That was, again, a tremendous feeling of relief. Shane made a profession of taking care of himself (and everybody else). Michael was a vampire, with all the fun advantages that came along with that in terms of self-defense. Claire was small, and not exactly a bodybuilder, but she defended herself pretty well . . . at least in being smart, careful, and having all the friends she could manage on her side.  
  
  Eve was . . . Well, Eve liked to live on the edge, but she wasn't exactly Buffy reincarnated. And in some ways her hard edges made her the most fragile of all of them. So Claire tended to worry at times like these. A lot.  
  
  ""Coffee?"" Michael asked, still rubbing his head. His hair should have looked crazy, b  
ut he was one of those people who had a natural immunity to bed-head; his blond hair just fell exactly the way it should, in careless surfer-style curls. Claire averted her eyes when he threw the sleeping bag back and reached for his shirt, because although he was always good to look at, he was seriously spoken for, and besides, Shane was standing right there.  
  
  Shane.  
  
  It came back to her in a dizzy rush, how he'd stopped her on the way into this place, in the faint dawn light. ""I want you to promise me one thing. Promise me you'll marry me. Not now. Someday. ""  
  
  And she had promised, even if it was just their private little secret. She felt that shivery, fragile, butterfly-flutter feeling in her chest again. It was a fierce ball of light, a tangle of joy and terror and excitement and, most of all, love.  
  
  Shane looked back at her with an intense, warm focus that made her suddenly feel like the only person in the world. She watched him walk toward her with a diffuse glow of pleasure. Michael was hot, no denying that, but Shane just . . . melted her. It was everything about him-his strength, his intensity, the off-center smile, the hunger in his eyes. There was something rare and fragile at the center of all that armor, and she felt lucky and privileged that he allowed her to see it.  
  
  ""You doing all right?"" Shane asked her, and she looked up at him. His dark gaze had turned serious, and it saw . . . too much. She couldn't hide how scared she was, not from him, but he was the last one to think it was a sign of weakness. He smiled a little and rested his forehead against hers for a second. ""Yeah. You're doing just fine, tough girl. ""  
  
  She shoved the fear back, took a deep breath, and nodded. ""Damn right. "" She ran her fingers through her tangled shoulder-length auburn hair-unlike Michael's, hers had suffered from a night on the hard pillows-and looked down at her T-shirt and jeans. At least they didn't wrinkle much . . . or if they did, it didn't much matter. They were clean, even if they weren't her own. It turned out there was a storehouse of clothing in the Elders' Council building basement, neatly packed in boxes, labeled with sizes. Some of it dated back to the Victorian age . . . hoop skirts and corsets and hats stowed carefully away in scented paper and cedar chests.  
  
  Claire wasn't sure she really wanted to know where all that clothing had come from, but she had her sinking suspicions. Sure, the older clothes looked like things the vampires themselves might have saved, but there were a lot of newer, more current styles that didn't seem to fit that explanation. Claire couldn't see Amelie, for instance, wearing a Train concert shirt, so she was trying hard not to think about whether they'd been scavenged from . . . other sources. Victim-y sources.  
  
  ""Did you have nightmares, too?"" she asked Shane. His arm tightened around her, just for a moment.  
  
  ""Nothing I can't handle. I'm kind of an expert at this whole bad dreams thing, anyway,"" he said. And oh God, he really was. Claire knew only a little of how many bad things he'd seen, but even that was enough to spark a lifetime's worth of therapy. ""Still, yesterday was dire, and that's not a word I bust out, generally. Maybe it'll look better this morning. ""  
  
  ""Is it morning?"" Claire peered at her watch.  
  
  ""That depends on your definition. It's after noon, so I guess technically not really. We slept for about five hours, I suppose. Or you did. Eve bounced about an hour ago, and I got up because . . . "" He shook his head. ""Hell. This place creeps me out. I can't sleep too well here. ""  
  
  ""It creeps you out more than what's happening out there?""  
  
  ""Valid point,"" he said. Because the world out there-Morganville, anyway-was no longer the semi-safe place it had been just a few days ago. Sure, there had been vampires in charge of the town. Sure, they'd been predatory and kind of evil-a cross between old-school royalty and the Mafia-but at least they'd lived by rules. It hadn't been so much about ethics and morals as about practicality . . . . If they wanted to have a thriving blood supply, they couldn't just randomly kill people all the time.  
  
  Though the hunting licenses were alarming.  
  
  But now . . . now the vampires were in the food chain. They'd always been careful about human threats, but that wasn't the issue, not anymore. The real vampire enemy had finally shown its incredibly disturbing face: the draug. All that Claire knew about them was that they lived in water and they could call vampires (and humans) with their singing, right to their deaths. For humans, it was fairly quick . . . but not for vampires. Vampires trapped at the bottom of that cold pool could live and live and live until the draug had drained every bit of energy from them.  
  
  Live, and know it was happening. Eaten alive.  
  
  The draug were the one thing vampires feared, really and truly. Humans they treated with casual contempt, but their response to the draug had been immediate mass evacuation, except for the few who'd chosen to stay and try to save the vampires already being consumed.  
  
  They'd all tried-vampires and humans, working together. Even the rebellious human townies, who hated vamps, had taken a drive-by run at the draug. It had been a heart-stopping military operation of a battle, the most intense experience of Claire's life, and she still couldn't quite believe she'd survived it . . . or that anyone had.  
  
  Even with all that effort, they'd saved only three vampires from the mildewed, abandoned pool-Michael, the elegant (and probably deadly) Naomi, and the very definitely deadly Oliver. Then things had gone from terrible to awful, and they'd had to leave everyone else.  
  
  Except Amelie. They'd saved Amelie, the Founder of Morganville . . . sort of. And Claire was trying not to think about that, either.  
  
  ""Hey,"" Shane said, and nudged her. ""Coffee, remember? Eve'll be all sad, emo Goth face if you don't drink some. ""  
  
  Again, Shane was the practical one, and Claire had to smile because he was completely right. No one needed sad, emo Goth Eve today. Especially Eve. ""I could kill for a cup of coffee. If there's, you know, cream. And sugar. ""  
  
  ""Yes and yes. ""  
  
  ""And chocolate?""  
  
  ""Don't push it. ""  
  
  Michael had, by this time, gotten up and joined them. He still looked pale-paler than usual-and there was something a little wild in his eyes, as if he was afraid that he was still in the pool. Drowning.  
  
  Claire took his hand. As always, it felt a little cooler than room temperature, but not cold . . . living flesh, but running on a much lower setting. Almost as tall as Shane, he looked down at her and smiled the rock-star smile that made all the girls melt in their shoes. She, however, was immune. Almost. She only melted a little, secretly. ""What?"" he asked her, and she shook her head.  
  
  ""Nothing,"" she said. ""You're not alone, Michael. We won't let that happen again. I promise. ""  
  
  The smile disappeared, and he studied her with a strange kind of intensity, almost as if he was seeing her for the first time. Or seeing something new in her. ""I know,"" he said. ""Hey, remember when I almost didn't let you into the house that first day you came?""  
  
  She'd shown up on his doorstep desperate, bruised, scared, and way too young to be facing Morganville. He'd been right to have his doubts. ""Yep. ""  
  
  ""Well, I was dead wrong,"" he said. ""Maybe I never said that out loud before, but I mean it, Claire. All that's happened since . . . We wouldn't have made it. Not me, not Shane, not Eve. Not without you. ""  
  
  ""It's not me,"" Claire said, startled. ""It's not! It's us, that's all. We're just better together. We . . . take care of each other. ""  
  
  He nodded again, but didn't have a chance to reply because Shane reached in, took Claire's hand from Michael's, and said-not seriously, thank God-""Stop vamping up my girl, man. She needs coffee. ""  
  
  ""Don't we all,"" Michael said, and smacked Shane on the shoulder hard enough to make him stagger. ""Vamping up your girl? Dude. That's low. ""  
  
  ""Digging for China,"" Shane agreed, straight-faced. ""Come on. ""  
  
  Claire could follow the smell of brewing caffeine all the way to Eve like a trail of dropped coffee beans. It gave the sterile, funereal, windowless Elders' Council building a weirdly homey feel, despite the chilly marble walls and the t  
hick, muffling carpets.  
  
  The hallway opened into a wider circular area-the hub in the wheel-that held a huge round table in the center, which was normally adorned by an equally large fresh floral arrangement . . . adding to the funeral home vibe. But that had been pushed to the side, and a giant, shiny coffee dispenser had been put in its place, along with neat little bowls of sugar, spoons, napkins, cups, and saucers. Even cream and milk pitchers.  
  
  It was surreal to Claire, as if she'd stepped out of a nightmare and into a fancy hotel without any transition. And there, emerging from another door that must have led to some sort of kitchen, came Eve, with a tray in her hands, which she slid onto the other side of the big table.  
  
  Claire stared, because although it was Eve, it didn't really look like her. No Goth makeup. Her hair was down, loose around her face and falling in soft black waves; even without her rice-powder coverage, her skin was creamy pale, but it looked movie-star beautiful. Natural-look Eve was stunning, even wearing borrowed clothes . . . though she'd found a retro fifties black pouf-skirted dress that really suited her perfectly.  
  
  She had a red scarf tied jauntily around her neck to hide the bites and bruises that Michael-starving and crazy from being dragged out of the pool-had inflicted on her.  
  
  She, and this setup, all looked a little too perfect. Shane and Michael exchanged a look, and Claire knew they were communicating the same thought.  
  
  Eve gave them a bright smile and said, ""Good morning, campers! Coffee?""  
  
  ""Hey,"" Michael said, in such a soft and tentative voice that Claire felt her stomach clench. ""You should be resting. "" He reached for her, and Eve flinched. Flinched. Like he'd tried to hit her. His hand dropped to his side, and Claire couldn't look at his face. ""Eve-""  
  
  She spoke in a rush, running right over the moment. ""We have hot coffee, all the good stuff-sorry I couldn't get mocha up and running, but this place has a serious espresso deficiency . . . oh, and the croissants are hot out of the oven, have one. ""  
  
  ""You baked?"" Shane's eyebrows threatened to levitate right off his face.  
  
  ""They were in one of those pop-open rolls, moron. Even I can bake those. "" Eve's smile wasn't so much bright, Claire thought, as it was totally breakable. ""I don't think anybody ever used the kitchen in here, but at least it was stocked up. There's even fresh butter and milk. Wonder who thought of that?""  
  
  ""Eve,"" Michael said again, and finally she looked directly at him. She didn't say anything at all, only picked up a cup, filled it with hot, dark coffee, and handed it to him. He took it as he stared at her, then sipped-not as if he really wanted it, but as if it was something he was doing to please her. ""Eve, can we just-""  
  
  ""No, we can't,"" she said. ""Not right now. "" And then she turned and walked back to the kitchen, stiff-armed the door, and let it swing shut behind her.  
  
  The three of them stood there, only the sound of the door creaking on its hinges breaking the silence, until Shane cleared his throat, reached for a cup, and poured. ""So,"" he said. ""Aside from the five-hundred-pound gorilla in the room that we're not going to talk about, does anyone around here have half a plan on how we're going to live through the day?""  
  
  ""Don't ask me,"" Michael said. ""I just got up. "" The words sounded normal, but not the tone. It was as odd as Eve's had been, and just as strained. He put his coffee back down on the table, hesitated, then took a croissant and walked away, back toward the room where they'd been. Shane started to follow, but Claire grabbed his arm.  
  
  ""Don't,"" she said. ""Nothing we can do about this, is there? Let him alone to think. ""  
  
  ""It wasn't his fault. ""  
  
  ""I know. So does she. But she got hurt, and he did it, and that's going to take time, all right?"" She held Shane's gaze this time, and he was the first one to look away. He'd hurt her before-more emotionally than anything else. And he hadn't been in his right head-place, either. But sometimes explanations just didn't matter as much as time. It was a hard lesson to learn, for both of them; it was going to be even harder for Michael and Eve.  
  
  God, sometimes growing up sucked.  
  
  ""Okay, so it's down to us, then. We still need a plan,"" he said. He drank coffee, and she fixed hers up and gulped down a hot, bitter, wonderful mouthful. Next was the croissant, still steaming inside from the oven, and it was heaven in bread form, melting in her mouth. ""No, strike that. We need SEAL Team Six, but I'll settle for a half-ass plan right now. ""  
  
  She swallowed. ""Don't talk with your mouth full. ""  
  
  He did exactly what any boy-no, man-his age would do: he showed her a mouthful of mashed croissant, which was gross, then drank more coffee and showed her again. Gone.  
  
  ""That is disgusting, and I will never kiss you again. ""  
  
  ""Yes, you will,"" he said, and proved it by pressing his lips to hers. She wanted to squirm away, just to prove the point, but God, she loved kissing him, loved that his mouth was so warm and sweet and bitter with coffee . . . loved being so close to him now, teetering on the edge of the end of . . . everything. ""See?""  
  
  ""It wasn't bad,"" she said, and kissed him again. ""But you really need to work on your technique. ""  
  
  ""Liar. My technique is awesome. Want me to prove it?"" Before she could protest, his lips touched hers, and he was right about the proof. She slipped her hands under the loose hem of his shirt, fingers gliding lightly over the tensing muscles of his stomach, up to the hard, flat planes of his chest. His skin was like warm velvet, but underneath, he was iron, and it took her breath away.  
  
  Or so she thought. But when he skinned her Train T-shirt up and fitted his strong hands around her waist, pulling her to him even closer, she gasped against his mouth, moaned a little, and just . . . melted.  
  
  The hot, golden moment was sliced cleanly by a cold voice saying, ""I can bear a great many things, but this is not one of them. Not now. ""  
  
  Claire jumped back from Shane, guilty as a shoplifter. It was, unmistakably, Oliver's voice, and it was coming from behind her. She hated round rooms. Too many ways people could come at you, especially sneaky, cranky vampires. She turned and faced him as he stalked toward them-no, toward the coffee, since he brushed them aside and filled a cup. She'd never seen him drinking it, but of course, he would; he owned the local coffee shop, Common Grounds. Or at least he had when there was still a Morganville that was alive and kicking.  
  
  Common Grounds, like everything else in town, was closed.  
  
  Oliver had always taken pains to present himself as human . . . maybe because he, of all the vampires, seemed the furthest from it. He was cold, unfeeling, acerbic, and sarcastic, and that was on a good day. It clashed with his friendly-aging-hippie vibe of tie-dyed shirts and jeans that he wore at the coffee shop, but he'd dispensed with all that now. He'd donned clothing that suited him, in a sinister and scary way-black pants, a black coat that must have been about a hundred years old, and a white shirt with a ruby pin where a tie would usually have gone. Except for a top hat, he could have stepped out of the turn of the last century. These, Claire felt, were his own clothes. No hand-me-downs for Oliver.  
  
  ""I guess it's pretty useless to say good morning,"" Shane said.  
  
  ""Especially as it's neither morning nor good, yes,"" Oliver replied, just shy of a snap. ""Don't try to banter with me, Collins. I am far from in the mood. "" Claire could make out the red mottling on his pale skin, like Michael's, a souvenir of his time spent in that drowning pool. She wondered how he'd slept, if he'd slept. ""As to plans, yes, I have one, and yes, it is under way. ""  
  
  ""Mind if we ask-?""  
  
  ""Yes, of course I mind,"" Oliver said, and this time it was a snap. There was a gleam of red in his eyes. He looked tired, Claire thought, and there was a flicker of something almost human in him. ""If you wish to be of use, go find Theo Goldman and bring him to me. Now. ""  
  
  ""Theo?"" Claire was startled, because she'd heard that Theo had gone missing, like many other vampires in Morganville . . . and she'd assumed he'd been in the pool. A casualty, when Amelie had resorted to throwing silver into it to kill  
the draug and their trapped victims with them. ""Is he here?""  
  
  ""If he was here, I wouldn't ask you to find him, would I?""  
  
  Shane was doing that thing now, his posture getting stiff with challenge; he didn't like it when Oliver treated her-or any of them-like idiots. But especially her. The last thing any of them needed today was to fight each other. They were working together-more or less-and that was how it had to be to survive this. So Claire put a hand on Shane's arm to hold him back and said, in a very reasonable tone, ""Do you have any idea where to look for him?""  
  
  Oliver's hand trembled, just slightly, but enough to make the cup rattle lightly on the saucer. He, like Michael, still felt weak. That should have made Claire feel reassured, because he was usually so intimidating, but instead it made her feel extra vulnerable. ""No,"" he said. ""I do not. But I require his presence, so you will find him. "" He let a second pass and then added, without looking at either of them, ""For the sake of the Founder. ""  
  
  For Amelie. And there was a very slight change in his tone when he said it, something that almost seemed . . . softer.  
  
  ""She's worse,"" Claire said. Oliver turned and walked away without responding, so she looked at Shane. ""She's getting worse, right?""  
  
  ""Probably. Who knows with him?"" But Shane had the same thought she did; she knew it. If Amelie died, they were at Oliver's mercy. Not a good thing at all. He was a general, and when he fought wars, he liked them bloody-on both sides. ""Maybe we should have left town when we had the chance. Just picked up and run for it. ""  
  
  ""And left Michael behind? And Eve? She wouldn't have left him. You know that. ""  
  
  He didn't answer. She knew that Shane wasn't someone who ran away, but he couldn't help thinking about it-Morganville's version of living a rich fantasy life. After a moment, he shrugged and said, ""Too late now anyway. Where do you think we should start, if we're supposed to track down Goldman?""  
  
  ""No use looking at the hospital. It's closed,"" Claire said. ""They moved all the patients out in ambulances and buses. And there are way too many places he could be. It's not that big a town, but big enough to hide one vampire. He sent his family away, you know. "" Theo, unlike most vamps Claire knew, actually had a family, and cared about them; it was very like him to be sure they were clear of the trouble, then stay behind himself.  
  
  ""Can't go close to the hospital anyway,"" Shane said. ""The whole area's a no-go zone; the singing starts when you come anywhere close. ""  
  
  The singing of the draug was not just eerie; it was deeply dangerous. It got hold of you, made you forget . . . and made you vulnerable to them. Claire nodded. ""We'd better stay away from any water, too. ""  
  
  ""Toilets? Please say you don't mean toilets, because this is rapidly turning into no fun at all. I mean, I like peeing on a wall as much as the next drunken redneck, but-""  
  
  ""Chemical toilets,"" she said. ""Amelie had them brought over from some construction company. And please tell me you don't pee on walls. ""  
  
  ""Moi?"" He put his hand over his heart and did his best wounded-innocent look. ""You must be thinking of some other uncouth jackass. Which makes me jealous, by the way. ""  
  
  She would have played along with that, but the idea of the tap water made her suddenly realize that she was drinking the coffee in the cup in her hand, and she resisted a sudden violent urge to gag. ""Uh, the coffee . . . ?""  
  
  ""Made with the finest bottled water,"" Eve said. She was back, and she'd brought cookies this time. ""And these are sliced off a roll, so don't think I've gone all Martha Stewart, Shane. The vamps stocked up on bottled water some time ago. I'm guessing it's their version of survivalist training, if they've been worried about the draug for so long. All those plastic containers may be bad for the environment, but they're really good for us right now. So . . . you're looking for Theo?""  
  
  ""So says Oliver,"" Shane said, and stuffed a whole cookie in his mouth.  
  
  ""Trust me, I work for Mr. Scary Guy in Charge, and you do not want to disappoint the man, even if you're just pulling espresso shots. Especially not now. Besides, having Theo here would be a nice antidote to all this""-Eve gestured at the marble, carpet, dim lighting-""gloom. Theo's cheerful, at least. ""  
  
  He was, mostly. Although Claire thought that like all vampires she'd ever met-except Michael, and his grandfather Sam-Theo was essentially concerned about his own survival first. Once you accepted that was how vamps saw the world, it was a whole lot easier to understand what they would do, and why. Morganville, for instance. It was pragmatic, having this isolated town, which they controlled for their own safety. They were cruel sometimes, but they saw it as self-defense . . . . Let the humans get the upper hand, and the vampires feared they'd be killed, sooner or later. Claire didn't agree with it, but she understood it.  
  
  Theo was . . . less pragmatic about that than most. Thankfully. And Eve was right. He would have a calming effect here, if he wasn't floating somewhere in a pool of water, being eaten alive.  
  
  Claire shuddered.  
  
  ""Want to come with?"" Shane asked, licking melted chocolate from his lips. Which was a little bit mesmerizing, actually. Claire had a dizzying impulse to help him with that, but she shook it off. Time and place, Claire, time and place . . .  
  
  ""She can't come with us,"" Claire said, as Eve opened her mouth to agree. ""Come on, Eve, you lost about two pints of blood last night. You're not strong enough yet and you know it. You need rest. ""  
  
  Eve's mouth closed without making a comment, but she gave Claire a steady, cool look, as if she'd let her down by even mentioning what had happened. Although it was pretty clear that Eve, and Michael, were thinking a lot about it.  
  
  ""Right,"" Shane said in the silence. ""That was awkward. Eve, you stay and . . . bake or something. ""  
  
  ""The hell I will,"" she snapped back, way too tense. ""If you don't want me with you, maybe I'll just grab a couple of Amelie's boys and take them shopping for more weapons. We need to arm up, and we need to do it fast. That okay with you, or should I change into my pearls and an apron and die like a good girl?""  
  
  Shane held up his hands in surrender and took a step back. ""I-have nothing to say. "" Smart boy, Claire thought. ""But if you go out, you take more than a couple of vampires with you, Eve. I mean it. Take Michael. ""  
  
  ""Well, you know what they say: less is more,"" Eve said. She didn't even comment on the Michael issue, but there was a stubborn, wounded look to her, and she didn't meet Shane's eyes.  
  
  ""Right now, more is more, and much more is much better. You can't dick around with these . . . things. You know that, right?""  
  
  ""Oh, I know,"" Eve said. Her dark eyes were filled with shadows, windows in a haunted house. ""I was just thinking that it would be a good idea to start making weapons stockpiles around town. If we start a running fight, we need to be able to get to weapons when we need them. ""  
  
  That was . . . a very good idea, Claire realized, and she nodded without speaking. Shane even looked respectfully impressed, which was an odd look for him; he wasn't impressed by much. ""Get silver,"" he said. ""If you can, knock over a jewelry store and get all the silver chains. We can break them up into pieces. Makes a good grenade. "" Silver hurt, or killed, both vampires and draug. Shane sounded practical about it, but then, he'd spent his high school years being dragged around with his vampire-hating father. He probably knew more about killing vampires than anyone else in town . . . except the vampires themselves, of course. ""It's about the only thing that does work on these bastards. Talk to Myrnin about making more shotgun shells, too. ""  
  
  Myrnin being Claire's vampire boss-if a relationship that crazy could be called employer-employee, anyway. She was Igor to his Frankenstein. He had an underground lab and everything, which she'd managed to make a whole lot less creepy during her tenure with him . . . but not less chaotic. Myrnin was walking chaos, and a lot of the time that was fun.  
  
  Sometimes, not so much.  
  
  Eve rolled her eyes, now almost back to the old carefree girl Claire knew. ""Yeah, Collins, I wouldn't have thought of Myrnin ever. Of course I'll talk to  
him. He's the only one who had his crap together before we went out the first time. ""  
  
  ""Hey!""  
  
  ""Present company excepted, supposedly. ""  
  
  ""Better,"" Shane said, and surprised her by suddenly enfolding her in a fierce hug. ""Stay safe, all right?""  
  
  ""Safe. "" Eve agreed, and then held him at arm's length, studying him with thoughtful intensity. ""Huh. You don't hug, you know. Unless you get hugged first. ""  
  
  ""I don't?""  
  
  ""Nope. Never ever. ""  
  
  Shane shrugged. ""Guess everybody changes once in a while. ""  
  
  All of a sudden Claire was struck by how different they all were now. Eve had grown steadier, more thoughtful. Shane had taken his aggression in hand and was starting to understand it, channel it. Even open up a little more than he had.  
  
  Michael . . . Michael's changes were more unsettling, less easy to appreciate, but he'd definitely changed. He was struggling not to change even more-not to drift further away from his lost human life.  
  
  As for Claire herself, she couldn't say. She couldn't tell, really . . . . She supposed she had more confidence, more courage, more insight, but it was hard to imagine herself from the outside like that. She just . . . was. More or less, she was still Claire.  
  
  Eve waved good-bye, hugged Claire hard-that was a typical Eve gesture-and headed toward the room where they'd left their stuff. Michael was in there. Claire hoped they could work out their . . . Problems didn't seem a strong enough word, and issues sounded too mundane. There wasn't really a word for what was going on between her best friends, other than complicated.  
  
  Claire grabbed coffee to go, wolfed down a couple of cookies-premixed or not, they were hot, melty, and delicious-and followed Shane down another hallway. It might be, she thought, the one Oliver had used, but this place was confusing. If there were signs, they were visible only to vampires. But Shane took a right down an identical hallway, then a left, and then they were in another round room, this one with a massive barred door at one spoke of the wheel. The door also had guards . . . lots of them. Amelie's personal detail, Claire thought as she recognized some of them. They didn't look as spotlessly turned out as she was used to seeing. The dark tailored suits were gone, and so were the sunglasses. Instead, they wore clothing from the same archival stores that she and her friends had scavenged . . . and she supposed that what they'd chosen at least indicated what period in history they were most comfortable with.  
  
  The two guards at the door, for instance. The taller, thinner one with the light hazel eyes and close-cut blond hair . . . he was wearing a chunky black leather jacket with spikes and buckles, and skinny jeans. Very eighties. His friend with the sharply drawn cheekbones and narrow eyes had on the tightest polyester pants Claire had ever seen, and a square-cut jacket to match, with a tight buttoned shirt in a loud earth-toned pattern.  
  
  ""It's like disco inferno up in here,"" Shane muttered, and she smothered a laugh. Not that it mattered; vampires could hear that, and if they wanted to take offense, they would. But the seventies addict just smiled a little, showing the tips of his fangs, and the eighties dude couldn't be bothered with that much response. There were more guards standing around the walls, still as statues. Most had chosen clothing that wasn't so . . . retro, but one was wearing what looked like a gangster suit from the Prohibition era. Claire half expected him to be toting a violin case with a machine gun in it, just like in the movies.  
  
  ""No one goes into the armory,"" Disco Inferno said. He was apparently the spokesman for the door. ""Go back, please. ""  
  
  ""Order from Oliver,"" Claire said. ""We're to find Theo Goldman. ""  
  
  ""Yesterday,"" Shane put in helpfully. ""And we'd like to not die. So. Armory it is. ""  
  
  ""No one goes into the armory,"" the vampire repeated, sounding bored now and staring over the top of Shane's head, which was quite a trick even for a tall guy. ""Not without authorization. ""  
  
  ""Which they have,"" said a voice from behind the two of them. Claire turned quickly, which she tended to do now, when vampires talked behind her, and found that Amelie's pretty blond vampire ""sister""-not by family but by vampire blood, although she didn't exactly get all of that relationship detail-Naomi was standing three feet behind them, having arrived in eerie silence. She smiled and bowed her head, just a little. She was still very formal, used to the manners beaten into her hundreds of years ago, but she at least was trying; it wasn't a full curtsy or anything, not that such would have been practical with the khaki cargo pants and work shirt she was wearing. ""I myself have spoken with Oliver. I am to accompany these two and help them locate Dr. Goldman. ""  
  
  That held some weight. Disco Inferno and his eighties counterpart-Billy Idol?-did some heavy lifting on what looked like solid steel bars, plus a complicated lock, and finally swung the doors open for them. Naomi passed the two of them and looked over her shoulder with that same charming, though slightly awkward smile. ""I hope that you do not mind me accompanying you,"" she said. She had a bit of an accent, antique and French, and Claire could see that it had an effect on men in general, even Shane, who was more than a little anti-vampire in any form.  
  
  ""Nah,"" he said, ""I'm good. Claire?""",1,1754372537.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False
1mi0z6d,https://i.redd.it/baynqcl825hf1.png,Why can't I just make a happy OC that isn't a villain,"In the beginning—when Heaven was still scaffolding and stardust, when the constellations were scaffolds and angels sang to steady their own trembling hands—the Architect shaped Faln from raw law and divine inevitability.

Not fire. Not light. Not love.

But judgment.

Faln was forged as the fulcrum upon which all things would tilt. A being of absolute verdict, chiseled from axioms so old even the stars had forgotten how to name them. Their voice could unmake galaxies. Their gaze could unravel souls like threadbare cloth. They were not made to lead, nor to rule, nor to feel.

Only to weigh.
To balance.
To correct.

There was no place for compassion. No mercy carved into their marrow. No room in their design for wrath, either—that, too, was weakness. Faln was not angered by evil. They simply ended it.

For an age uncountable, Faln did as they were made to do. With perfect, surgical indifference, they passed judgment on collapsing pantheons and insubordinate cherubim. They erased heresies from time itself, excised corruption from Heaven like tumors of shadow. When the Morningstar fell, it was Faln who sealed the wound. When ancient gods begged for second chances, it was Faln who whispered no, and watched as their temples crumbled to dust and silence.

Even Zenith, Heaven’s vaunted sovereign, once stood trial before Faln in a time older than time. The only thing that spared Zenith from erasure was a loophole buried in the subtext of an ancient covenant—one Faln accepted without expression. Since then, Zenith has ruled, and Faln has watched. Quietly. Eternally. Begrudgingly.

But even eternity has weather.

And after enough millennia, something shifted.

Not in power—no. Faln remained as immense and unshakable as ever. But something deeper, quieter, more human… broke.

They began to tire. Not physically. Not even mentally. But spiritually.
An exhaustion that transcended comprehension—a bone-deep weariness of being.

Aeons of listening to mortals sob their sins in desperation, of watching angels plot behind golden curtains, of demons monologuing their traumas like theater—it all began to blend together into a grey hum. Nothing surprised Faln anymore. Nothing mattered. The scale always tipped the same way, and yet nothing changed. Empires collapsed. New ones rose. Names changed, but the sins remained painfully, insultingly familiar.

Their sword of judgment—once so swift and final—now remains half-sheathed. Their robes hang loose, wrinkled from disuse. The wings that once spanned galaxies are mottled and unmended, trailing dust like forgotten relics.

They sit now at the edge of Heaven, outside the gates they once guarded like flame, slouched in a folding chair conjured from their own apathy. Divine coffee in one hand. A cracked fate tablet in the other. Their eyes—once twin cataclysms—now flicker with only a ghost of interest. They do not move unless summoned. And even then, only with a sigh.

When they speak, it is in a whisper of inevitability.
And yet, no one dares ignore it.

The Demon Princes still speak of Faln in hushed, reverent terror—not because of who they are, but because of what they might still be. Because beneath the layers of disinterest, the divine machinery still hums. Ancient, restless. Waiting for something—anything—to matter again.

But nothing does.

Not anymore.

Faln has become a monument to disillusionment. A god-shaped relic of cosmic bureaucracy. They are the echo of perfect justice in a universe that no longer believes in such a thing.

And still—still—Heaven prays.

Because if Faln ever finds purpose again… if they ever decide that something is finally worth it—
Heaven, Hell, and everything caught in the middle will not be judged.

They will be ended.

Because there is nothing more dangerous than a god who has nothing left to lose…
…except boredom.

And the day Faln stops sipping coffee is the day the stars learn fear.",3,1754372525.0,OriginalCharacter,0,1.0,False

His family is from Washington DC visiting my hometown for two weeks. When we initially talked I asked for more than what they were offering (15/hr) as my rates start at 21/hr (my area typically asks between 20-30/hr, for reference my other babysitting gigs are typically 25/hr for one kid.) They said their budget was 525/week but they could extend my break and that the kid was a sweet and easy guy. They mentioned he was a bit clingy and had a light allergy but otherwise was good. Well, I get there and a couple of things stand out to me
- I had assumed this was some middle class family on vacation. Definitely upper middle class. Renting a huge gorgeous house, fun snack options, etc. It felt off considering I’m making below minimum wage from where they’re from.
- The kid had 2 epi pens ‘just in case’ with a supposedly minor allergy 
- kid is clingy to his parents. I was expecting this for the first half of the day, but no. 8:30-1 and 3-5:30 we were next to either his mom or dad. He wouldn’t go outside the house, even when he could see his dad. I’m fine with playing in front of parents for a little, but 6.5 hours of magnet tiles next to dad was too much.
- For potty training they have him try to go to the potty every 30 minutes. This was not only not mentioned, but is also highly disruptive to any play flow that we have going on. Had I been informed of this I would have insisted on a higher rate.
- The mom asked me to stay an extra half hour, I agreed only later realizing that I might not be paid for this as we agreed on a weekly amount given the hours above, meaning we are back to 15/hr.
- Maybe I’m spoiled with amazing families, but the parents felt fairly cold to me. They offered me coffee and then no other non-child-related interaction. It felt terribly transactional in a way I’m not used to.

I know childcare is expensive and hard to find. I know I agreed to hang out with this kiddo for two weeks. But this doesn’t feel like what I agreed to and I am frankly not enjoying myself. Would I be a jerk if I gave them a 2-day notice at the end of tomorrow if nothing changes? Or perhaps if I told them I can only do 8:30-1 going forward?",4,1754372482.0,Babysitting,3,1.0,False

I’m very lost as to if I just need to keep meeting people or if I’m doing something wrong. I’ve mostly been using dating apps but as I’ve felt more socially confident I have periodically asked people I’ve met irl too.

Roughly things go like:

1. Meet person at a casual social event with mutual friends/on app and have a pleasant convo but not outright ‘flirty’

2. I ask them out to a very casual meal/coffee date or casual walk. For irl ppl: sometimes explicitly a date or adding some sort of appearance compliment or flirty comment to try to make the invite clearly non-platonic

3. *date happens* and feelings-wise sometimes I am nervous beforehand but usually things go away by the time we see each other. I usually feel like I’m able to clearly express my personality/be funny and be genuinely myself

4. *date ends* outcomes range from this ‘person obviously doesn’t like me/I wouldn’t be interested in even being friends’ to ‘I had a warm and pleasant time and want to see them again’

5. If it makes sense to express interest in seeing them again, I do and they politely reject me

I’m questioning if I’m doing anything wrong because literally no one has been interested in a second date? I don’t have issues making friends/am a funny person/ask good questions getting to know people platonically?

What is a date supposed to look like? I’m super lost if I’m not being flirty enough or something? For clarity, I’m trying to date for a long term relationship but none of that stuff even comes up because it seems like there is no base line romantic interest",2,1754372385.0,AskMen,10,0.75,False

Since then, I’ve:

* Started working out consistently (4–5 days a week)
* Followed a high-protein diet
* Managed to build a decent physique



# My (Not Super Strict) Diet

**Breakfast:**

* 5 eggs (2 whole + 3 whites)
* Fruits
* Idly / dosa / bread / appam (varies)
* Black coffee (no sugar)

**Lunch:**

* Rice
* 200–250g air-fried chicken
* Carrots and cucumbers
* Yogurt or curd

**Pre-workout:**

* Muesli or steamed plantains
* Black coffee (no sugar)

**Post-workout:**

* 1 scoop whey isolate in water
   * Started with ON Gold Standard
   * Switched to MyProtein Impact Whey Isolate around 6 months ago

**Dinner:**

* 100–150g chicken
* Chapati
* Fruits and carrots



# History of Gastric Issues

* In 2018, I moved cities for work
   * Mostly ate street food for breakfast and lunch
   * Only dinner was home-cooked
   * Developed bloating and gastric issues
   * Kept popping Gelusil pills whenever I felt discomfort
   * Symptoms eventually subsided
* Around 4 years ago
   * Started drinking 2–3 cups of strong filter coffee (with milk)
   * Gastric issues came back
   * Doctor diagnosed me with lactose intolerance
   * Cutting down on milk helped eliminate symptoms



# Current Situation

* Gastric issues have returned
* First doctor diagnosed me with gastritis
   * Advised me to avoid oily, fried, and spicy foods
   * Took prescribed meds for a week — symptoms went away briefly but came back (less intense)
* Went to a gastroenterologist for a second opinion
   * Diagnosed me with irritated intestines
   * Gave me the following advice:

Doctor's Recommendations (That I'm Worried About)

* Stop high-protein diet completely
* No more than 2 eggs a day (only egg whites)
* No red meat (fine by me)
* No more than 100g of chicken per day
* Stop taking whey protein
* Focus more on cardio than weight training



# My Concern

I’ve put in a lot of effort over the last two years to get into shape.  
I’m worried I’ll lose all my hard-earned progress if I follow this advice strictly.  
Honestly, it feels like this doctor may be biased against high-protein diets or lifting in general.

Wool rugs are prized for their extraordinary durability,stain resistance,and luxurious feel. Cotton rugs are a more affordable option, offering a soft and pleasant texture. Silk rugs provide unparalleled elegance and sheen, but require more careful maintenance. Synthetic fibers, such as polyester or nylon, offer excellent stain resistance and affordability, making them suitable for high-traffic areas.

**Construction Type:** The construction method significantly impacts a rug's durability and longevity.

Machine-made rugs are the most affordable and readily available, offering a wide range of styles and patterns. Flatweave rugs, like kilims, are lightweight and reversible, ideal for layering or high-traffic areas.

The texture of the rug, whether smooth, shaggy, or patterned, also adds visual interest and tactile appeal.**Stain Resistance and Cleanability:** cream rugs, due to their light color, are more susceptible to stains than darker rugs. Therefore, stain resistance is a crucial feature to consider. Many modern cream rugs are treated with stain-resistant finishes or made from inherently stain-resistant fibers like polypropylene. Look for rugs that are easy to clean with mild soap and water or that can be professionally cleaned without damaging the fibers. Consider rugs with intricate patterns as thes can mask everyday dirt and spills.

**Are cream rugs difficult to keep clean?**
Cream rugs can show dirt and stains more easily than darker rugs. However, with proper care and maintenance, they can be kept looking clean and fresh. Regular vacuuming, prompt stain removal, and professional cleaning when necessary are essential. Choosing a rug with stain-resistant fibers or a stain-resistant treatment can also help to minimize cleaning efforts.

**What type of rug pad should I use under a cream rug?**
A rug pad is essential for protecting your cream rug and your flooring.It provides cushioning, prevents slipping, and extends the life of the rug. Choose a rug pad made from natural rubber or felt, as these materials offer excellent grip and cushioning without damaging your flooring. Ensure that the rug pad is slightly smaller than the rug to prevent it from being visible.

**Can you use a cream rug in a high-traffic area?**
Yes, you can use a cream rug in a high-traffic area, but it's critically important to choose a rug that is durable and easy to clean. Opt for a low-pile or medium-pile rug made from stain-resistant fibers like polypropylene or wool. Regularly vacuum the rug and promptly clean any spills or stains to prevent them from setting. Consider using a rug in a high-traffic area that is patterned, this can help disguise dirt and wear.

1mi0jgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Umrah/comments/1mi0jgt/sharing_my_experience_visa_on_arrival/,Sharing my Experience & Visa on Arrival,"Salam to everyone. 

First, since a lot of people are confused about the visa on arrival based on selected countries Passports and Visa. Yes, 99% of the times Visa on arrival is a multiple entry, 1 year visa. Secondly, you dont get a sticker on your passport. You don't get any proof of your visa except for the entry stamp and you have to calculate your validity days manually. Thirdly, you only have your border number(entry number) hand-written on your passport at the time of entry. If you want your Visa number, email ""Visit Saudi"", they might help. Other than that no one will have any information about your visa status. I tried a billion different helplines and departments. 

If you are using your visa-on-arrival a second, be confident and visit. I was really worried since i didn't have a proof but trust me saudi keeps the record and their immigration knows you have a one year validity visa. Convincing and educating your Airline and local immigration is your Job. 

If you want to use the Jeddah-Makkah free Bus service at the airport, go for a umrah Visa. We had a Tourist visa and they didn't let us board the bus.

  
Now the overall umrah Experience:

My wife and I travelled from Pakistan. We had 9 Days for our trip. 9 days is enough, although 2/3 days are spent traveling. We spent 4 nights in Makkah, around 3 nights in Madinah, and one night in Jeddah. Yes, the more the merrier but with time constraints, 8/9 days are enough.   
  
We landed around 4 am. Got done with immigration and everytime at 5am. Got a ""mobily"" sim at the Airport for 60 SAR for 14 days. Got a taxis for 200 SAR to Makkah Hotel. Mostly Taxis drivers are scammers and expect them to over-charge you. 200 SAR is a lot but thats what the prices are. Its barely 1 hour drive. Be ready to negotiate heavily. 

Got to our Makkah Hotel at 6:30am. Hotel Name: ""Elaf Ajyad"". Cost: 42 USD per night. Book through AGODA. Check different booking websites before booking. Elaf Ajyad is a pretty decent hotel for the price. Pretty close to the haram. Walking 10 minutes. But the last 50 meters is a strong incline so be prepared to hike. Good thing you will get a free shuttle through the hike every 2 minutes.   
Food Cost Depends on you. Ranging from 12 SAR per meal to 35 SAR.   
  
Stayed there for 4 days. Wont be discussing the Umrah Steps here since this post is already to long. 

Al-Harmain Train:   
We took the train from Makkah to Madinah and Back. Total Cost: 465 SAR for two people both ways. check the train on the NUSUK app and the Al-harmain APP too. Both usually have different priced Tickets. Nusuk gave me 350 SAR for one person while on Al-haramain APP i got my ticket for 465 for two people both ways. The train takes 2.5 hours max and is really comfortable.

Madinah: We stayed with Family. So living cost was zero and i dont know much about hotels there. Book Rawdah e Rasool entry through NUSUK APP. Book Umrah Permit through NUSUK. Although you really don't need it but still to be cautious.  

Notes: Take rest. Pack comfort clothes. Take a small bag for shoes and goodies while you are in the haram. Take Vaseline or any anti rash cream since you will get rashes due to the excess walking. If you are a coffee/tea lover preferably take tea bags since finding tea takes a lot of walk, so try to get that in your room. Take cash around 1000 - 2000 SAR, although they take card. Negotiate 

PS: The NUSUK app is really Glitchy, it's down a lot so stay relaxed and wait for it to be fixed before pulling your hair over it. 

Ask me anything since i did a lot of research on my trip. I will try to accommodate with whatever information i have. May Allah bless your journey and your intentions for performing Umrah, Its a great experience. If you are having double thoughts, take my word, ""YOU WILL LOVE THIS JOURNEY""",4,1754371005.0,Umrah,0,1.0,False
1mi0j18,https://www.reddit.com/r/pdfhive/comments/1mi0j18/the_widows_husbands_secret_lie_by_freida_mcfadden/,The Widow's Husband's Secret Lie By Freida McFadden,"Hey there, fellow bookworms and curious minds!

I just finished reading Freida McFadden's latest, *The Widow's Husband's Secret Lie*, and I have to say, it was quite the ride. If you're looking for a book that grabs you from the first page and doesn't let go, you might want to check out [The Widow's Husband's Secret Lie By Freida McFadden](https://pdfhive.com/the-widows-husbands-secret-lie-by-freida-mcfadden/). It's one of those psychological thrillers that wraps you up in its mystery.

**What's it all about (no spoilers, I promise!)?**
Imagine this: a woman whose husband has passed away, and as she navigates her grief, she starts uncovering secrets he kept hidden. Secrets that make her question everything she thought she knew about him, their life together, and even herself. It's all about deception, suspicion, and peeling back layers to find the truth, or what passes for it. As is typical with McFadden, you're constantly guessing, and just when you think you've figured it out, she throws another curveball.

**What I really liked:**
First off, the **pacing** in this book is just fantastic. It's a real page-turner. Each chapter ends with a little hook that makes you want to read just one more. Before you know it, hours have passed! Freida McFadden has a knack for keeping the tension high and the story moving at a brisk clip.

The **writing style** is simple and direct, which I really appreciate in a thriller. It doesn't get bogged down in overly flowery language, letting the plot and the characters' mounting anxiety take center stage. This makes it a very accessible read, perfect for when you just want to escape into a story without too much effort.

And, of course, the **twists**! Oh, the twists. McFadden is known for them, and this book delivers. Just when you think you've got it all figured out, she pulls the rug out from under you. It’s genuinely surprising, and I found myself gasping out loud a few times, which is always a good sign for a thriller.

**A little bit of what didn't quite hit the mark (for me):**
While the characters are well-suited for the plot, sometimes I wished for a bit more depth in their motivations beyond the immediate crisis. They serve the purpose of driving the plot forward perfectly, but I didn't always feel a deep emotional connection to them outside of their predicament. However, for a fast-paced thriller, this is often a trade-off for keeping the story zipping along, and it certainly didn't stop me from enjoying the ride.

**Would I recommend it and for whom?**
Absolutely, yes! If you're a fan of psychological thrillers, domestic suspense, or just enjoy books with surprising plot twists, then *The Widow's Husband's Secret Lie* is definitely for you. It's perfect for a weekend read, a plane trip, or whenever you need a quick, engaging escape. If you like authors like B.A. Paris or Shari Lapena, you'll likely enjoy Freida McFadden.

**A Little Guide for New Readers (and a bit of encouragement!):**

Reading is one of life's greatest pleasures, and if you're just dipping your toes into the world of books, especially thrillers, here are a few thoughts:

1.  **Don't feel pressured to finish every book.** It's perfectly okay to put a book down if it's not grabbing you. Life's too short to read something you're not enjoying! Think of it as dating for books – some are a match, some aren't.
2.  **Start with what excites you.** If you're drawn to mystery and suspense, jump right into a thriller like this one. If fantasy or romance or something else calls to you, try that! The goal is to find joy in reading.
3.  **Read at your own pace.** There's no rush to get through a book. Whether you read a chapter a day or devour a whole book in one sitting, it's all good.
4.  **Find your ideal reading spot.** For some, it's a cozy armchair with a cup of tea. For others, it's a bustling coffee shop. Find where you feel most comfortable and focused.
5.  **Don't be afraid of the ""hype.""** Sometimes a book gets a lot of buzz. Try it out if it sounds interesting, but remember your experience is your own. This particular book, [The Widow's Husband's Secret Lie By Freida McFadden](https://pdfhive.com/the-widows-husbands-secret-lie-by-freida-mcfadden/), lives up to the hype for me!
6.  **Talk about it!** Once you finish a book, share your thoughts! Whether it's with friends, on Reddit, or just journaling, discussing what you read can deepen your experience.

Reading is a wonderful journey, and every book you pick up opens a new door. So, go ahead, find your next adventure! If you're curious about this one, you can find more details or get your hands on a copy right here: [The Widow's Husband's Secret Lie By Freida McFadden](https://pdfhive.com/the-widows-husbands-secret-lie-by-freida-mcfadden/).

Hello everyone,

We made a smol community in IG ba and since then we have organized a few intimate hangouts and meet-ups for people like us. From KTVs, pool party, coffee hangouts, book clubs, art walks, dinner dates, tagay, staycations, board games, brunch dates, mall dates, late night rides and more. We have not only gathered chill and laid back sapphics but also made friends with them, sparked an inspiration and brought their motivation and creativity back to life.

We hope makahimo pameh more with little to no fee, because we wanted to make sure na makaorganize meh og quality na event without putting the burden to the attendees.

With that in mind, we have decided to have a fund-raising initiative instead. We are formally inviting all sapphics to our flea market this August 17 at 8 Banawa Centrale. We created this event not only to raise funds but also to amplify the voices of the queer community, most especially for the small and local businesses. No entry fee and everyone is welcome.

For those who prefer to sell, we understand that not everyone can afford to rent a booth, so we have decided to open The Sapphic Collective. It aims to empower small sapphic businesses, artists, creatives, and curators who have little to no experience. We will be providing a huge white tent for you, chairs, tables, lights and electricity. FOR FREE! However, any donation is welcome. We have received a few of them already and we can't miss this opportunity to extend this invitation to you gays.

Things like… 

Standing in line, waiting to order coffee and a stranger you inadvertently make eye contact with says “hey, I like your tattoo”

Is met with a response of “my tattoos are deeply personal, how dare you comment on it even though it was complimentary and I’m wearing this outfit that ensures I show em off in their entirety”

And all the responses are like, yeah! My visible tattoos are for me and me only! That person was a creep, who gave them the right to talk to you?! Next time you should report them to management!

× × × 

Or while chillin with your dog who’s wearing a top hat and bow tie in a public park, you notice a stranger take a picture of your dog. Oh and your kid is also near the dog. So of course it’s totally justified for you to start screaming at this stranger. And the stranger is like “what? I like your dog’s hat, it’s silly!” Soo then you gotta double down with the aggression and the Reddit mob wholeheartedly agrees that that was the correct reaction to have, and half of them would have been wayyy ruder to this offensive intrusion by the stranger. 

× × × 

I could go on, but it just makes me so sad for where our society is. It’s disheartening that so many of us are so adamantly against responding half decently to pleasantries or inquisitiveness when we’re approached unexpectedly as we’re out and about. 

Furthermore, these mean reactions prolong the human interaction that you’re so desperately trying to avoid; and everyone involved ends up walking away aggravated or upset. The notion that you don’t owe anyone anything, including a polite or curt response, just baffles my mind. 

I’m not saying people should be doormats nor am I saying you must spend 10 minutes talking to someone just because they approached you. I’m not saying you must divulge your most intimate secrets just because you’ve been asked a question. I’m just saying there are ways to respond to unwanted or unexpected social engagement with grace.

I'm honestly SO excited to finally be bringing this to the community. We've been working on truly solving the context loss between chats, accounts, and even different AI services. And we actually did it!

[Memory Chip Forge](https://pgsgrove.com/memoryforgeland) takes your ChatGPT (or Claude) export and transforms it into a ""Virtual AI memory chip"" - one file that contains your entire conversation history, formatted, indexed and fully vectorized for fast retrieval by any AI that uses chat uploads with RAG or projects with RAG. Upload it to any new chat, say ""activate memory chip"" and boom - your GPT remembers everything. Like literally everything.

We are researchers, coders, devs and a team of people who truly love AI. We built this for us and for the community after losing one too many conversations ourselves. We're keeping it at $3.95/month for using the forge (basically a coffee) while we keep building more tools like this. Once you make a chip it's yours forever! Feel free to make some and then cancel if you don't need continued access to the chip making tool. No usage limits, no token fees, just unlimited memory chips.

Also all data stays in your browser. None of it goes to our servers at all. The forge works locally through your web browser.

I know it almost sounds too good to be true, but it works. So well that it actually even surprised us.

Request a data backup from ChatGPT from settings>data control's->Export Data  
OpenAI will email you a download link. Download your backup and unpack it.  
**The File you need is: conversations.json** in the main/top level folder. Drag and drop/upload that file to Memory Forge and download your memory chip.

You will now have that memory chip for use in ANY chat window or project memory knowledge base (for Claude). For ChatGPT you can just drop the chip into a new chat. Simply upload to your AI in chat with the prompt ""Activate Memory Chip"" and watch as your AI loads it's memory.

My coding node on ChatGPT has a 14mb mega size memory chip, and 4o loads it perfectly, fully able to recount all of our coding and patenting work together as well as all convos.

# Carolans Irish Cream Liqueur: 2025 Best Value Review

Carolans Irish Cream liqueur has carved a significant niche in the world of creamy liqueurs, offering a smooth, accessible, and relatively affordable alternative to some of its more premium competitors.Its blend of Irish whiskey, fresh cream, and honey provides a distinctive flavor profile that appeals to a broad audience, from casual drinkers to those seeking a lighter after-dinner treat. In a market saturated with options, Carolans remains a staple, largely due to its consistent quality and approachable price point, making it a contender for the title of ""Best Value"" in 2025. This review aims to delve into the key features, benefits, and overall value proposition of Carolans Irish Cream Liqueur, providing consumers with the information necessary to make an informed purchasing decision.

## Key Features Analysis

The success of Carolans Irish Cream Liqueur hinges on a combination of well-balanced ingredients and carefully controlled production processes.

**Irish Whiskey Base:** The foundation of Carolans is a blend of Irish whiskeys, contributing to the subtly warm and complex character of the liqueur. The specific types and ages of whiskeys used are proprietary, but the emphasis is on a smooth, lighter profile that complements the cream and honey rather than overpowering them. This careful selection results in a pleasant warmth without the harshness that can sometimes be found in higher-proof whiskeys.

**Fresh Irish Cream:** Sourced from local Irish farms, the fresh cream used in Carolans is crucial to its smooth, velvety texture. the cream is pasteurized and homogenized to ensure stability and prevent separation, contributing to the liqueur's long shelf life. The quality of the cream directly impacts the overall richness and mouthfeel of the product, resulting in a decadent experience.

**Natural Honey:** Unlike some other Irish cream liqueurs that rely heavily on artificial flavorings, Carolans incorporates natural honey to enhance its sweetness and add a subtle floral aroma. The honey provides a more rounded and complex sweetness compared to refined sugar, contributing to the liqueur's distinctive taste.

**Chocolate and caramel notes:** While not explicitly listed as ingredients, Carolans exhibits subtle chocolate and caramel notes that enhance its flavor profile. These hints of chocolate and caramel characteristics are likely derived from the interaction between the whiskey, cream, and honey during the blending process, creating a harmonized palate.

**Standard Alcohol Content:** Carolans has a standard alcohol content of 17% ABV (alcohol by volume), which is typical for Irish cream liqueurs. this level of alcohol provides a gentle warmth without being overly strong, making it easy to drink neat, on the rocks, or in cocktails.

## Core Benefits

Carolans Irish Cream Liqueur offers several practical benefits that contribute to its appeal among consumers.

**versatile Consumption:** Carolans is remarkably versatile and can be enjoyed in a variety of ways. It can be sipped neat or over ice as an after-dinner drink, added to coffee or hot chocolate for a creamy indulgence, or used as an ingredient in cocktails and desserts. This adaptability makes it a valuable addition to any home bar.**Affordable Luxury:** Compared to some of the more premium Irish cream liqueurs on the market,Carolans offers a more affordable option without compromising on quality. Its lower price point makes it accessible to a wider range of consumers, allowing them to enjoy a taste of luxury without breaking the bank.

**Smooth and Palatable Flavor:** The balanced blend of whiskey, cream, and honey creates a smooth and palatable flavor profile that appeals to a broad range of drinkers. The sweetness is not overpowering, and the whiskey provides a subtle warmth without being harsh or bitter.This makes it a popular choice for those who are new to Irish cream liqueurs or those who prefer a milder flavor.

**enhanced Coffee Experience:** Adding a splash of Carolans to your coffee elevates the experience, transforming an ordinary cup into a creamy, decadent treat. The blend of whiskey, cream, and honey complements the coffee's natural flavors, creating a rich and satisfying beverage. This is especially true during cold-weather seasons.## FAQs Section

**How should Carolans Irish cream Liqueur be stored?**
Onc opened,Carolans should be stored in the refrigerator to maintain its freshness and prevent spoilage. While the alcohol content helps to preserve it, the fresh cream base is perishable and requires refrigeration. It is generally recommended to consume it within six months of opening.

Yes, Carolans can be used in baking to add a touch of Irish cream flavor to cakes, cookies, and other desserts. It can be substituted for milk or cream in many recipes, and its flavor complements chocolate, vanilla, and coffee.

So I went to this coffee shop after work today. 

And I met this guy, and I have never and I mean ever felt this way about someone I just met. 

We hit it off immediately, idk why I said to him “sorry if I’m bothering you, I talk a lot when I’m nervous” he said “I like hearing you talk” 

2 hours went by. And we had so much in common


Idk if there was real body chemistry. His knees kept touching mine, he touched my shoulder. He said he found me funny. 

Idk if I’m just reading into it. I told him I worked at an eye clinic and eye have glasses, cause I noticed he was wearing glasses. He said “oh good, I need to get my eyes checked”

He then told me he actually lived 2 min from my job. He then asked me what days I’m working so he can stop by. 

Idk, I’m back into the dating world after having a baby last year. I did mention that to him, he then said “good, put your child first”. I told him my daughter’s name and he said there’s a song about her name. Even though it’s not a common name. He played it on his phone and let me listen. 

We talked about our childhoods, there was so much in common we had even though we grew up in different cultures. 

 He said he speaks Spanish and said he could teach me when I had a chance. 

I didn’t realize the time and said I needed to go home.

Murphy’s Diner, off I-84
Booth #9

The place is nearly empty.

Fluorescent lights buzz above cracked vinyl booths. A waitress with a smoker's rasp and a face carved by years of night shifts leans on the counter, half-watching a black-and-white crime drama on the TV mounted in the corner. Outside, rain spits softly against the window, each drop a tiny tap on the glass.

A man in his late thirties—clean-shaven, neat—sits across from a college-aged girl. She's dressed in a hoodie, stringy blonde hair tucked into it. Her backpack sits beside her like she might bolt at any moment. Her phone is on the table, untouched.

The man smiles at her, unblinking.

MAN
You don’t seem like the type to accept coffee from a stranger.

GIRL
I’m not. But you paid for my eggs. That was… nice.

MAN
It was a calculated investment. You looked like you needed a reason to stay.

GIRL
Maybe I just didn’t want to go back out in the rain.

MAN
Or maybe you knew who I was the moment I walked in.

She stiffens. Doesn’t speak. Her eyes narrow slightly.

MAN (smiling wider)
That’s not an accusation. It’s admiration. You watched me in the reflection of the napkin holder. Most people don’t even notice they’re being studied. You didn’t just notice—you adjusted your posture to keep your backpack within arm’s reach. Very clever.

GIRL
Maybe I’ve had bad experiences.

MAN
Statistically, you’re overdue for one.

She shifts in the booth. The leather squeaks. A waitress passes by and fills their coffee cups without a word. The girl nods politely. The man doesn’t look away from her.

GIRL
So what’s your angle?

MAN
Oh, no angles. Just… moments. I like these moments. Where everything’s on edge, just before a decision is made. Do we talk honestly? Do you try to run? Do I tell you the truth?

GIRL
What truth?

He taps the laminated menu with one long finger.

MAN
That I’ve killed twenty-four people. Maybe more. I don’t always count the ones who beg.

A long pause.

She doesn’t bolt. She doesn’t scream. She picks up her coffee and takes a sip. She burns her tongue but hides the wince.

GIRL
So what? You want me to be scared? Confess before you do it again?

MAN
Not really. I just wanted to see what kind of person you are. How you carry it.

GIRL
Carry what?

MAN
The weight of knowing. That life can end not with some grand finale, but because a stranger thought it might be interesting. Like a story ending in the middle of a—

GIRL
—sentence. Yeah. I get it.

He raises his eyebrows.

MAN
Do you?

GIRL
I worked suicide hotline last semester. People don’t always die for reasons. Sometimes they just… tip. Something little pushes them. A breakup. A bad grade. A stranger’s smile that was too wide.

He nods. Sips his coffee. Doesn’t blink.

MAN
You’re clever. And more interesting than I expected.

GIRL
You’re not.

MAN (chuckling)
Ouch.

GIRL
You think you’re original. But you’re not. You’re just a mirror. All serial killers are. You take what the world already is and push it a little further, and you call that profound. But it’s not. It’s pathetic.

That catches him off guard for a second. He tilts his head.

MAN
You think I’m a symptom, not a cause?

GIRL
I think you’re lonely. And bored. And trying to feel something before the numbness swallows you.

MAN
And what if I said you’re right?

GIRL
Then I’d say I’m sorry. That must be exhausting.

Another silence, this one stranger than the last.

The girl finally asks:

GIRL
Why me?

MAN
You looked like you were ready to disappear. You sat down with your coat still on. Your eyes scanned every exit before your butt hit the seat. You ordered eggs like it might be your last meal.

GIRL (softly)
Wasn’t hungry.

MAN
No. You were rehearsing.

She looks at him fully now, for the first time. Her eyes are green. Brighter than expected.

GIRL
So is this your way of giving me a choice? Some sick test?

MAN
No. I’m just wondering if you’re like me.

GIRL
A killer?

MAN
No. Someone who already died. Who just hasn’t stopped moving yet.

Her throat tightens.

GIRL
You don’t know anything about me.

MAN
I know you haven’t texted anyone all night. I know your phone hasn’t lit up once. I know the side of your sneaker is split and you keep curling your toes to hide it. I know you thought about stepping in front of a semi on the highway.

Tears prick her eyes. She wipes them away fast, angry.

GIRL
Fuck you.

MAN
There it is. The real heartbeat under the shell.

He leans forward.

MAN (cont’d)
You don’t want to die. Not really. You just want someone to notice you’re hurting.

GIRL
What, you gonna fix me? Take me home and show me how the world’s a beautiful place again?

MAN
God, no. That’s not what I do.

He pulls something from his coat pocket. Not a knife. Not a gun.

A coin.

He places it on the table.

MAN
Heads, you leave right now. Walk out that door. I won’t follow. I’ll even pay for your food.

GIRL
And tails?

MAN
We talk. All night if you want. As long as you’re still here, I stay interested. If you bore me, I stop being polite.

GIRL
And then?

MAN
That’s up to you. People underestimate how much control they have—especially at the end.

She stares at the coin. It’s old. Worn. 1969.

GIRL
Why a coin?

MAN
Because I don’t make decisions anymore. I surrendered that a long time ago. This thing tells me where to go, who to follow, who to speak to. It keeps things… honest.

GIRL
You let chance decide if someone lives or dies?

MAN
Don’t we all?

She stares at it.

Then flicks it.

It spins. Lands.

Heads.

The man leans back. He looks... almost disappointed. But not surprised.

MAN
Well. That’s that.

GIRL
You’re letting me go?

MAN
That was the deal.

He signals the waitress. Hands her a twenty. Stands.

She doesn’t move.

MAN
You want me to stay?

GIRL
I want to know what it feels like.

MAN
What what feels like?

GIRL
Being seen. By a monster. And still being… enough.

He studies her.

MAN
You are enough. That’s why I can’t hurt you.

GIRL
Why not?

MAN
Because hurting you would be like slashing a painting you don’t understand. There’s… potential.

He reaches into his coat again. Pulls out a card.

No name. Just an address. Somewhere in the desert.

MAN
If you ever want to understand the other side—what it feels like to stop pretending—we meet there. No pressure. No tricks.

GIRL
What’s at the address?

MAN
Freedom. Or the end of it.

He walks away. Calmly. Doesn’t look back.

She stares at the card.

Outside, the rain has stopped.

She picks up her phone. Types a message. Deletes it.

She picks up the coin. Slips it into her pocket.

And sits there.

Alone.

I am repulsed by the idea of even holding hands with someone while any part of me is still physically female. My doctors agreed I need to speedrun my top and bottom surgeries because my dysphoria is severely impacting my life in multiple ways. 

I know there's an end in sight to it all and I just need to wait till I'm roughly 26 for when all my surgeries are done and over with as my mother's insurance will run out then. I have a good family and a good life and I'm working on a solid degree and just finished my open water diver license. I'd say I am a pretty happy person overall.

But I also just wanna go on an awkward coffee date with someone. And I want to get married and have kids someday and my clock is ticking away. 

I don't want to have to live like a priest forever. And I already feel like I missed out on so much. No one wants to be with someone who doesn't know how to flirt or kiss when we're in our late 20's.

I wish I was able to just go for it, but I know I'll just end up regretting it and I am not one to live a life with regrets. Not to mention that transitioning is too much pressure so early on in any relationship I want and when I start dating I don't want 'test runs'. I'm far too tired and boring for games or casualness.

There is a few things I miss from the V Touring. The IMO the segmented LED headlights seemed to light the road better but the Projector LEDs have far better down road light and after swapping in the LEDs in the high beams. My auto high beams work 300x better. 

Anyway at the shop today we have a 2022 Passport Sport. And of course I have to play a bit. I like the bigger LCD display on the Passport cluster vs the tiny one the Ridge has. But what surprised me on the Ridge was its lack of a few menu screen items (coffee break and the Traction Screen) and the Passport Sport has both. 

I doubt it’s possible as I’m sure the communication is different but swapping in the Passport Cluster to the Ridge. 

Other thing that surprised me was the cloth seats in the Passport are far more comfortable and better bolstered than the “leather” seats in the Ridge. 

Just a few things. Nothing major. Ridgeline has done everything I have needed it to do and more. Climbed up a mountain and like the pic shows even played on the sand right before the cyclone hit before Thanksgiving last fall. The AWD is far better and handles way better than the CRV. 

And bonus points is I paid the thing off last month. Now let the mods begin. OEM plus mods. Probably a leveling kit. Different wheels off a Pilot or Passport. Not a fan of the “generic” grey wheels on a full trim rig, my V has some really nice wheels.  

Putting some power options in the back with the inverter to power my amateur radio go kit. Have the bed tent. Need to build a step that slips into the receiver.  

Have a list of OEM options I’m going to add. Running boards, I’ll add my own entry lights, roof rails and cross bars. NoLo makes some brackets to mount ditch lights I’ll use to mount antennas off the a pillars.

## key Features Analysis

The key to a great Kona coffee K-Cup lies in several factors, from the sourcing of the beans to the quality of the brewing technology.**Authenticity and Bean Certification:** This is the single most significant feature. Look for K-Cups that clearly state the percentage of Kona coffee they contain, and ideally, boast certification from the Kona Coffee farmers Association (KCFA). True Kona beans are relatively rare, so 100% Kona K-Cups will command a premium price. Be wary of blends that do not specify the Kona percentage.

A Certificate of Origin, a stamp displayed on packaging, will guarantee the authenticity of beans.

**Roast level Consistency:** The roast level significantly impacts the coffee's flavor profile. K-Cups should maintain a consistent roast, typically medium, to highlight the unique characteristics of Kona beans. Variations in roast level within the same batch can lead to inconsistent and undesirable results.

This will allow the most pleasing notes of Kona coffee to sing in each cup.

**Packaging and Preservation:** K-Cups need to preserve the freshness and aroma of the coffee beans. Look for packaging that uses airtight seals and nitrogen flushing to minimize oxidation and degradation. Some manufacturers even utilize multi-layered materials to further enhance protection.

This will keep the K-Cups consistently delicious over time.

**K-Cup Compatibility:** Ensure the K-Cups are compatible with your Keurig brewing system.While most K-Cups adhere to industry standards, variations in design can occasionally cause issues with certain models. Check the packaging for compatibility data or consult the manufacturer's website.

This will allow for no-hassle brewing and maximum convenience.

**Brewing Technology Optimization:** Certain K-Cups incorporate features designed to optimize the brewing process within Keurig machines.These may include specialized filter designs or flow control mechanisms that ensure even saturation and extraction, resulting in a more flavorful and balanced cup of coffee.

This can take your Kona coffee K-Cup experience to the next level.

**Sustainability and Ethical Sourcing:** Look for brands that prioritize sustainable farming practices and ethical sourcing. This includes fair wages for farmers, environmentally amiable cultivation methods, and certifications like Fair Trade or Rainforest Alliance. Choosing these options supports responsible coffee production and helps ensure the long-term health of the Kona region.Doing this helps support the farmers of one of the most sought-after coffees in the world.

This helps you avoid throwing away half a pot of wasted coffee.

**Variety and Experimentation:** The availability of different Kona coffee blends and roast levels within the K-Cup format allows for experimentation and customization. Explore various options to find your perfect cup and tailor your coffee experience to your individual preferences.

The numerous blends offer something for every palate.**Portion Control:** K-Cups provide precise portion control, helping to manage caffeine intake and avoid overconsumption. Each K-Cup contains a pre-measured amount of coffee, making it easy to track your daily consumption.

This helps avoid getting the jitters from too much caffeine.

1mhzmhz,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Curious-Carry-8494/comments/1mhzmhz/personalized_cat_dishes_a_stylish_and_practical/,Personalized Cat Dishes: A Stylish and Practical Touch for Your Feline Friend,"Cats are more than just pets—they're cherished members of our families. Just like people, they appreciate routine, comfort, and even a bit of style in their daily lives. One of the most overlooked yet important parts of a cat’s day is mealtime. The dish your cat eats from can affect not only their health but also their feeding habits and overall experience. That’s where [**personalized cat dishes** ](https://www.furvorite.com/CAT-BOWL/)come in. These customized bowls aren’t just cute; they serve a functional purpose by catering to your cat’s unique needs and personality.

**Adding a Personal Touch to Mealtime**

Personalized cat dishes allow pet owners to bring a special flair to their cat’s daily routine. These dishes can be customized with your cat’s name, a special design, or even a color scheme that matches your home décor. Whether you’re buying for your own pet or looking for a thoughtful gift for a fellow cat lover, personalized dishes make mealtime feel more special. These little details may seem small, but they reflect the love and care you have for your pet. Just like we enjoy using our favorite coffee mug, cats enjoy consistency and familiarity—especially if their dish is distinct and comfortable to use.

https://preview.redd.it/03sd6m0lo4hf1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=572fb38556b49eebaed0df54e23ee153dc90b982

**Practical Benefits for Health and Hygiene**

Beyond aesthetics, personalized cat dishes offer real health and hygiene benefits. Many of these custom bowls are available in materials such as stainless steel, ceramic, or BPA-free plastic—each with its own advantages. Stainless steel is highly durable and resistant to bacteria, while ceramic dishes are stylish and easy to clean. Custom dishes often come with options tailored to your cat’s needs: elevated dishes for older cats with joint issues, shallow bowls for cats with flat faces like Persians, or slow-feed bowls for overeaters. A dish designed specifically for your cat’s size and feeding habits can prevent messes, reduce strain on their neck and joints, and promote better digestion.

**Ideal for Multi-Cat Homes**

In households with more than one cat, personalized dishes become even more valuable. Feeding multiple cats in the same space can be tricky, especially if one cat tends to dominate mealtime or has dietary restrictions. Personalized bowls with each cat’s name help distinguish whose dish is whose, preventing confusion and potential food stealing. This is particularly useful if some cats are on special diets or need medication mixed into their food. Separate, identifiable bowls can help you monitor each cat’s eating habits more accurately and ensure they’re getting the right nutrition.

**Stylish Options to Suit Every Taste**

One of the best things about personalized cat dishes is the wide variety of styles and designs available. You can find minimalist ceramic bowls etched with elegant calligraphy, playful dishes with cartoon illustrations, or even high-tech bowls with built-in scales or timers. Some companies offer handcrafted, artisanal bowls made from eco-friendly materials, while others let you upload your own artwork or choose from pre-made patterns. Whether your home is modern and sleek or warm and rustic, you can find a dish that complements your aesthetic while serving a practical purpose for your cat.

**Caring for Your Personalized Cat Dish**

To make the most of your personalized cat dish, it’s important to keep it clean and well-maintained. Depending on the material, many dishes are dishwasher-safe, making cleaning a breeze. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive pads that might damage custom prints or engravings. Regular cleaning is essential to prevent bacteria buildup, especially if your cat eats wet food. Additionally, keep an eye out for signs of wear—such as chipping in ceramic bowls or scratches in plastic—that could harbor bacteria or pose a risk to your cat. With proper care, a personalized cat dish can remain a functional and stylish part of your cat’s life for years to come.

**Conclusion**

Personalized cat dishes are more than just a decorative item—they’re a thoughtful investment in your cat’s health, happiness, and comfort. By selecting a dish tailored to your pet’s unique needs, you’re showing love in one of the most important areas of their daily life: mealtime. Whether you’re solving a practical issue like portion control or simply want to make your cat feel a little more special, a custom dish is a charming and useful solution. With so many styles and materials to choose from, it’s easy to find one that’s perfect for both your cat and your home.",1,1754367936.0,u_Curious-Carry-8494,0,1.0,False
