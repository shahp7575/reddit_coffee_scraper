1qatlfo,https://www.reddit.com/r/ouraring/comments/1qatlfo/multiple_bugs_step_count_duplicate_activity_cards/,"Multiple bugs: step count, duplicate activity cards, incorrect activity suggestions","Want to share my recent struggles, didn't find the post about any of them. I just want to vent and share my experience haha

**1. Step count is overestimated.** Previously, step tracking felt more accurate. Recently, the app records steps that clearly did not happen.

Current behavior: Minimal movement is logged as a significant number of steps.

Example: After waking up, I only walked briefly around the kitchen and went to the bathroom to brush my teeth, yet the app recorded 110 steps. This is incorrect and does not reflect my actual movement.

Today all I did was make a coffee, brush my teeth, knit and watched a video about why Taylor Swift is a narcissist haha but Oura thinks I was dancing for some reason + counted 1630 steps.

**2. Duplicate activity confirmation cards.** Previously, detected activities required a single confirmation.

Current behavior: The same activity is shown multiple times as separate “Confirm activity” cards. After confirming one card, another identical card for the same activity appears.

As a result, one activity may need to be confirmed 4–5 times before the next detected activity becomes visible. For example, if I ran, then walked, then danced, and opened the app afterward, all activities are detected, but each one appears multiple times and must be confirmed repeatedly due to duplicated cards in the interface.

It's so annoying that if I was not paying attention, I then need to remove duplicates from the timeline. And the timeline starts glitching also when I tap on View full timeline

**3. Activities suggested when no activity occurred.** Previously, activity suggestions appeared only when there was actual movement or exercise.

Current behavior: The app suggests logging activities even when I was inactive.

Example: Yesterday I spent the entire day at home, did no workouts, and barely walked, yet I received two notifications prompting me to confirm some activity, despite not having done any.

Going back to previous issue: Today all I did was make a coffee, brush my teeth, knit and watched a video about why Taylor Swift is a narcissist haha but Oura thinks I was dancing for some reason + counted 1630 steps.

Support answered that 1 and 2 are known issues, and suggested soft reboot (whish did not help).

I appreciate their supportive words, but there is no clarity — when these issues will be fixed, and how I’ll know that they are fixed. Right now, I’m left in uncertainty and anxiety about the reliability of my data.

I decided not to renew my subscription until these problems are resolved and I can trust the data again.

# 🧨 IMHO~The real takeaway (this is the part that matters most):

This line from Mark Smith is the tell:

***“The team is now working diligently to incorporate these results into an updated mineral resource and reserve and mine plan, which is a key component of the updated Feasibility Study…”***

# ⛏️ NioCorp Final Assays Are In — What the Drill Holes Actually Tell Us (Plain English Breakdown)

Now that the full 2025 infill drilling results are finally released, here’s the straight technical reality without hype or doomposting: the drilling did exactly what it was designed to do — confirm continuity, validate grades, and support resource uplift for the updated DFS and EXIM diligence.

**NEC25-028a** came in very strong:  
105.49m @ 1.58% Nb₂O₅, 111 ppm Sc, 5.11% TiO₂, \~4,672 ppm TREO.  
That’s not “speculative exploration” grade — that’s core deposit strength confirming thickness and quality.

**NEC25-029** is arguably even more important technically:  
A massive 206.57m continuous intercept at \~0.88% Nb₂O₅ with \~100 ppm Sc and consistent TREO throughout. This is exactly the kind of long, consistent mineralization lenders and engineers want to see when validating bulk mineability.

**NEC25-030, 032, 033** collectively show something critical: continuity across multiple zones. Scandium stays consistently around \~100–113 ppm, TiO₂ holds steady, TREO stays in the multi-thousand ppm range. That matters because it supports the geological model — not isolated pockets, but a laterally coherent system.

Then you get into **NEC25-034, 035, 036**, which are clearly REE-enhanced zones. TREO values up to **10,304 ppm**, multiple long intercepts over 7,000–8,000 ppm. These are the holes that support the thesis that the TREO component of Elk Creek could expand materially beyond the older model — but only the updated resource estimate can confirm tonnage officially.

# 🧠 What this data confirms:

* Grades are consistent with historical data
* Mineralization continuity is intact
* Infill drilling did not “break” the model
* The geology remains robust across the deposit

**That’s exactly what you need before publishing a larger updated resource. The only thing missing now is the updated block model and official MRE/DFS numbers.**

# ⚠️ The key line everyone should be paying attention to:

***“The team is now working diligently to incorporate these results into an updated mineral resource and reserve and mine plan, which is a key component of the updated Feasibility Study…”***

# GIVEN****NioCorp has officially checked off some of the key 2026 milestones Jim Sims laid out.

**On Dec. 12th I shared responses to 4 Questions posed to management. On Dec. 22nd. Niocorp ""Checked off"" one of those boxes! For Context-**

[\#NIOCORP\~ Sharing Responses to 4 Questions from management as we head into ""2026\~ The Year!"" : r/NIOCORP\_MINE](https://www.reddit.com/r/NIOCORP_MINE/comments/1pkzkfw/niocorp_sharing_responses_to_4_questions_from/)

# 📌 NioCorp 2026 Milestones — Status Check (as of Jan. 12, 2026)

Based on Jim Sims’ Dec. 12 response and what’s been publicly confirmed:

# ✅ Completed / Clearly Checked Off

* Road construction / site access improvements
* Pre-construction activities at the mine site
* Pentagon-funded drilling campaign **completed**
* Final assay results **released Jan. 12, 2026**
* Drill data now being incorporated into updated resource, reserve & mine plan

These are not promotional wins — they’re physical and technical execution steps.

# 🔄 Actively In Progress

* Completion of work to uplift Probable → Proven resources
* Updated Feasibility Study (DFS/FS-level update)
* FS-level engineering for revised surface processing facility
* Pentagon deliverables:
   * Scandium metal production
   * Lockheed / NAMA Al-Sc alloy milestone work
* Progress milestones in EXIM financing process
* Discussions around offtakes
* Potential commercial deals related to NAMA
* Possible additional Pentagon partnerships
* Conference / institutional outreach activity

This is the heavy institutional workstream — slower, but critical.

# ⏳ Not Yet Announced (But Logically Sequenced After DFS / Financing)

* Final execution of EXIM debt package
* Other accompanying debt financing
* Additional equity raises (if needed for CAPEX gap)
* Formal offtake announcements
* Formal NAMA commercial agreements

**These typically land after DFS + financing clarity, not before.**

**People keep asking “what has actually been accomplished?”** so here’s a grounded update based on Jim Sims’ Dec. 12 milestone list and what’s publicly confirmed as of Jan. 12, 2026. NioCorp has officially checked off real on-the-ground progress: road construction and site improvements are underway, assays from the Pentagon-funded drill program are complete, and portal construction is scheduled to begin in Q1. That means this is no longer a paper project — physical execution has begun.

Several other milestones are clearly in motion even if not yet “completed”: the resource uplift work is actively being incorporated into the updated mine model, the revised FS/DFS is nearing completion, EXIM diligence is ongoing, and Pentagon deliverables (scandium metal, Lockheed Al-Sc milestones) are progressing under contract. Those aren’t retail hype milestones — those are lender-grade, government-grade process milestones, and they move slower because they must be defensible, auditable, and compliant.

**Bottom line: 2025 was about validation and de-risking. January 2026 just delivered the final assays. Portal work is next. DFS update follows. Financing decisions come after. That sequencing is exactly how serious infrastructure projects** move forward — and it’s why “2026 is the year” isn’t hype, it’s the inflection point.

# “We’re there!!” — Why 2026 Is the Year for NioCorp

**Mark Smith & Jim Sims saying it plainly:** ***“We’re there. We’re going to be able to start construction in 2026, next year.”*** After years of permitting, engineering, financing work, and validation, management is now openly talking about construction activity, site work, and visible progress on the ground. That’s not speculative language — that’s execution language.

What stood out most wasn’t just optimism, but certainty. Mark repeatedly emphasized momentum, **calling 2025 “nothing less than a phenomenal year”** and making it clear that 2026 is when the work becomes visible: portals, construction activity, and tangible progress at Elk Creek. **That lines up perfectly with what shareholders have been watching all year — drilling completion, assays underway, DFS work advancing, EXIM engagement, DoD funding, land acquisition finished, and now portal construction approved for Q1 2026.**

# For anyone still wondering “what changes in 2026?” — this is it. The story transitions from validation to build-out. From paperwork to equipment. From waiting to watching. As Mark said, “I hope you walk away realizing that things are about to change — and 2026 is going to be the year that it changes.” After all this time, NioCorp isn’t talking about someday anymore!

# ""We’re There!""....

[I am Joyously waiting for Team Niocorp to drop the DFS & have them PUBLISH the UPDATED RESOURCE!
