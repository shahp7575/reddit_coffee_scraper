A little time ago I started to see some weird stuff between him and a female coworker. After many weird things he has been doing I decided to ask him if what is going on and of course he said nothing, he got very defensive and offended, he also said that in a relationship you must hide some stuff and don’t be completely honest. Which was my confirmation that I am right. I have to mention that I have seen enough things that don’t put him in the position of a loyal man. 

One of the things I have noticed among others was the car chair. The day before I was the last person that stood in the passenger seat and the next day he got to work and right after work he waited me to go for a coffee together and the chair was pulled back, very much and and leaned quite a lot back.. he said nobody got into the car that day. But if I was the last person who sat on the chair why was it completely changed. I also found out that he was going out during the working hours, with his work buddies and probably those women out, he put 15 kilos because of that .. the kilos are a good karma plus he is loosing a lot of hair, so much that he is thinking about hair implant, but he doesn’t has money to pay it. I realised all this relationship was a lie, the only thing he did was to lie and do his life while pretending he is in love, because friends and family sees him like the perfect boyfriend.

Anyway, after a lot of thinking I took the decision to leave him. I talked to a therapist, she said she thinks he is not cheating, but my gut is telling me otherwise. I have chronic anxiety and panic attacks and two years ago I started to suffer by gut inflammation, which is very painful.

I haven’t told him that I am preparing my leave. Why I am still with him? because I want to move to another country and it is not that easy to leave right away. It is very hard for me to pretend that nothing is going on, I am completely disgusted by him, I know every word  from him is another lie.. it is hard, but I try to think about the time when I will leave. It will be in a few months. 

I can tell he is sensing something, because after so many years he asked me to marry and I keep giving stupid reasons to pospone it. I know he must have some dark motive behind it.

Anyway now the only think I dream with is of the moment when I will break free and change my life. My therapist say to go out and start dating in the mean time, not serious but for fun, I also think would make me good, but I don’t want to risk to be catch and then he will look like the good guy and I am not in the mood. ",1,1729152703.0,BreakupBackup,0,1.0,False

# What is a Shipping Container Outdoor Kitchen?

[**Shipping containers,**](https://www.pinterest.ph/tinyhousetalk/shipping-containers/) first made for moving goods worldwide, are now used to build outdoor kitchens. These strong steel containers are great for making kitchen areas with everything you need for cooking, storing, and dining.

# Advantages of Outdoor Kitchens Made from Shipping Containers

# 1. Easy to Move and Flexible

Shipping containers can be easily moved, so you can change the location of your outdoor kitchen if you want. This makes cooking adventures more flexible.

# 2. Eco-Friendly

Turning shipping containers into kitchens helps the environment by reusing these industrial structures. It’s a creative way to reduce waste and support green practices.

# 3. Personalized

One great thing about shipping container kitchens is that you can make them fit your needs and style. You can customize everything from how it’s set up to how it looks inside.

# 4. Strong

Shipping containers are tough because they’re made to handle rough travel conditions. When used as outdoor kitchens, they can withstand different weather conditions, lasting a long time.

# Design Ideas and Inspirations

# 1. Container Bar Concept

Picture a cool[ **bar made from a recycled shipping container**](https://www.pinterest.ph/ISOSpacesSW/pop-up-container-bars/), with a smart counter, seats, and nice lights. This idea gives a modern feel to outdoor parties.

# 2. Compact Mobile Kitchen

For people looking for a small option, a portable kitchen in a shipping container gives you a complete kitchen that you can take anywhere. Great for food trucks, events, or short-term setups.

# 3. Rustic Outdoor Dining Space

Convert a shipping container into a cozy outdoor eating space with wood touches, comfortable seating, and a delightful vibe ideal for dining outdoors.

# 4. Pop-Up Restaurant

If you own a restaurant and want to show your menu to new customers, think about a pop-up container kitchen. It’s like a flexible food truck that you can move around. You can try a temporary spot or a smaller version of your main restaurant for takeout or outdoor dining.

# Factors to Consider When Converting a Shipping Container into an Outdoor Kitchen:

Transforming a[ **shipping container into an outdoor kitchen**](https://www.pinterest.ph/ideas/shipping-container-outdoor-kitchen/957826563970/) involves important things to think about:

1. **Make sure it’s sturdy**: Check that the container can handle modifications for the kitchen.
2. **Keep it cozy and airy**: It needs good insulation and ventilation to control temperature and airflow when using hot appliances.
3. **Set up plumbing and wiring**: Arrange plumbing for sinks, faucets, and maybe gas lines. Ensure safe electrical wiring.
4. **Connect utilities**: Get water, electricity, and gas connections in place correctly. Hire professionals to further assist you with your needs.
5. **Plan layout and look**: Think about where to put appliances, counters, storage, and seating.
6. **Pick sturdy appliances**: Choose tough outdoor-friendly appliances like stainless steel gear, fridges, and grills.
7. **Protect from weather**: Seal gaps, use weatherproof materials, and add proper roofing for weather protection.
8. **Looks and usability**: Balance looks and practicality by matching designs with your outdoor area for a useful and beautiful kitchen.
9. **Follow the rules**: Check local laws for permits and rules when changing a container into a living space.
10. **Keep it maintained**: Regular upkeep is important to keep the outdoor kitchen working well.

# Different Size and Door Configurations of Dry Van Shipping Containers for Your Outdoor Kitchen

When thinking about using shipping containers for an outdoor kitchen, there are various types to pick based on what you need and like. Here are some common types of dry van containers that can be transformed into outdoor kitchens:

* **Standard Shipping Containers**: These are the usual type for shipping goods. They are usually 20 or 40 feet long in standard height and work well for basic outdoor kitchens.

You can opt to have double doors on one end or choose a [**tunnel container**](https://onsitestorage.com/dry-van-double-door-shipping-container/) where you can enter from one side and exit from another. Tunnel containers, with doors on both sides, make it easier to get to what’s inside, helping with better organization and finding things more easily. This setup also improves airflow inside the container and helps lower moisture levels.

* **High Cube Containers**:[ **High cube containers** ](https://onsitestorage.com/high-cube-shipping-containers/)are like standard containers but have an extra foot of height, giving more vertical space. This can be helpful if you need more room above for cabinets or appliances.

Similar to standard shipping containers, you can opt for a tunnel container or a single-door model at one end, depending on your design requirements and needs.

* **Open-Side Containers**: This[ **dry van container has side doors**](https://onsitestorage.com/open-side-container/) that go all the way down, so you can easily reach things from the side or the end. These are available in both 20-foot and 40-foot lengths, including a 40-foot High Cube option. You can turn these containers into useful outdoor kitchens by adding windows, ventilation, insulation, and kitchen stuff.

# Examples of Restaurants Using Shipping Containers as Outdoor Kitchens:

Restaurants always look for special ways to be different and give customers a memorable dining time. One cool idea that’s becoming popular is using shipping containers as outdoor kitchens. These reused containers bring a fun twist to dining and have benefits like being easy to move and customize.

# The Gulf, Orange Beach, Alabama, USA

Alabama’s coast has white, super soft sand. They have a restaurant, [**The Gulf**](https://www.gulfshores.com/restaurants/fan-favorite-outdoor-dining/the-gulf/), sitting right on it. The place is made from reused shipping containers and stuff, giving it a cool, casual feel. They serve up fresh local seafood, salads, and grilled food. You can sit at different levels, all by the beach. They even have a bar and a cute store. It’s pretty much a perfect beach spot.

# Spark: York, North Yorkshire, England, UK

In Piccadilly, within the city,[ **Spark: York**](https://visityork.org/business-directory/spark-york) is a modern and trendy community spot. It’s a hub with various businesses in shipping containers, including small unique shops and a food market.

# Conclusion

Shipping containers are so versatile! They can be turned into cool outdoor kitchens that suit different styles and spaces. You can create a workspace and kitchen in one container or even make a whole restaurant out of them.

By thinking about how things look, how useful they are, and where you’ll eat outside, people can mix the industrial look of shipping containers with cozy outdoor kitchens. This mix adds a special touch to your outdoor area and makes eating and entertaining even better.",1,1729152481.0,landscaping,0,1.0,False
1g5lvhz,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships_advice/comments/1g5lvhz/why_dopeople_stop_trying_soo_early_on_once_in_a/,Why dopeople stop trying soo early on once in a relationship??,"Has anyone else experienced this?  

(Apologies in advance for the essay, but I had to get it all out and there is some context there if you bare with me).  Also for reference I am 36f and my ex was 31m and has ADHD and high functioning autism with great social skills.


I have been thinking about things alot and how my (now ex) was in the beginning (I'd say the first 2 months were the best) and probably some of the happiest and most joyfu I've experienced. In the beginning he couldn't get enough of me, he planned dates and wanted to do stuff (not just hang out at his house), he took me out, i took him out, we would see each other at least once a week, mostly twice, we spent quality time together going out for dinner, breakfast or lunch or coffee, we would wander around the city we live in, go for bush walks, we went on drives and day trips, we spent time together away from his house, he would always text me good morning and goodnight, he would hold my hand in the car, he would want to spend whole days with me and a night too, he would want to take photos together, he would thank me even if I got him something as small as a coffee, he was so sweet and made me feel like I was his priority and told me I was. He was a great source of support for me emotionally when i quit my nursing job due to stress early on in our relationship, and i couldn't fault him. His face would just light up when he saw me and I do believe there was genuinely alot of love there and he wasn't love bombing me or being manipulative. 

But quite abruptly things started to shift in around the end of june (we got together end of April), I noticed he stopped wanting to do stuff together, and instead our routine became me going to his house once a week, usually on a Friday or Saturday evening, we would hang out for a few hours watching something, and wed have sex and go to sleep, then in the morning we'd maybe hang out for a few hours at his house before he would drop me home (I always made sure to tell him how thankful i was for the drive), 

The times we saw each other started to become less (sometimes just every two weeks which he seemed happy with, and he would never have left it that long in the beginning 😔), we didn't spend whole days together anymore (honestly he seemed more interested in playing video games and having the days to himself after dropping me home in the morning which I understood at the time because i knew hed been stressed from work and i understand the importance and need for alone time), the good morning and good night texts stopped, he just wasn't interested in doing anything together anymore. He didn't plan things anymore, he didn't want to do anything that didn't involve me going to his house. 

I met his mum and grandad on the 27th of July on a 2 day trip we took (by that point we hadn't done anything together since 16th june, so 6 weeks at that point), and id only seen him twice in the month leading up to our trip.
He said to his mum in front of me that he had found the woman he wanted to marry, and then we had our first fight after that weekend. We had gone to visit his pop who had dementia and it was very very hard for him, he was also unwell with a chest infection. It sort of felt like he just shut down emotionally on the way back to our hometown. He said some hurtful things on the way home, how he wasn't a good partner, how he saw his life in the future as a truck driver being on his own for weeks at a time, how he's a nomad, how he doesn't care about anyone's opinion even mine. It all felt odd and like someone emotionally shutting themselves off...?after Id spent that weekend trying to support him. 

We ended up having an argument at the end of that weekend around him seeking medical treatment for his chest infection (he's TERRIBLE at looking after himself and seeing a doctor if something is wrong). I offered to pay for the tele health appointment as he was short of money, I found the number for him to ring, told him what he needed to say, tried to be comforting and help how I could. Then he rings me multiple times after we'd got home thinking he need to go to hospital for a chest infection..I explained that the would be ok, that he needed to get a script for antibiotics and he'd be fine and start to feel better (I'm a nurse) and told him that he shouldn't have left it that long. He had actually ended up getting an appointment but cancelled when he knew the doctor had to see him in person. He promptly hung up on me after i told him he should have just gone, accused me of using the situation to prove a point, that he would never come to me for support for anything ever again and to leave him alone. He then sent me a message saying he was depressed and could see he was pushing me away and he'd been on his own so long it was difficult to share his life when he was depressed, and wondered if it was a defence mechanism (well duh!)...it hurt that someone i loved was pushing me away and I again took this personally. He asked for space and to be left alone which I agreed with..

I know I definitely have a tendency to overthink things people say, and i am somewhat anxiously attached, and I took his change in behaviour personally. He had set such a high standard at the beginning of how he treated me that when it stopped I naturally became concerned and upset and internalised it thinking he was losing interest.
But for someone to stop wanting to spend quality time together after just two months seems crazy to me..I've been in relationships before and noone has ever dipped so fast in terms of stopping wanting to do things..I understand about honeymoon phases, but to seemingly stop trying after only 2 months seems ludacris to me...?

I will note that during this period where he stopped wanting to do things together, he was always very good at expressing himself and telling me how much he loved me, how lucky he was to have me and how happy i made him....he had also gone through a period of stress and depression due to work and finding a job he liked but snapped out of that after a month (but still didn't want to do stuff). He always reassured me that if he was going to break up with me he would have just done it and that he wanted to be with me (it was actually me that initiated our breakup, the nail in the coffin being he told me he could now only see me on Friday nights and some of Saturday day...when I asked him to compromise he wouldn't and so we had a real lack of time together due to his job). That combined with the perceived lack of effort and disinterest in doing things on his part led me to feel unwanted, unloved, and like I was some sort of chore he had to schedule in. For us to be able to each other once a week I would have had to rearrange my work schedule and request a roster that fitted his (losing hundreds of dollars in the process each fortnight), and I wasn't willing to do that because he wouldn't compromise. It felt like I would have been settling for scraps of time and attention on his terms when it suited him.

I just don't understand 

Why did he stop trying? 
Why did he stop wanting to do stuff together?
Why do they start off soo strong in the beginning only to fade off in terms of effort after only a couple of months?
Was it that he became complacent?
Was it his depression or adhd or autism?
Was he just bull shitting me with all the beautiful things he said to me?

On one hand I’m a little sad it’s so limited in use, but on the other hand I feel like if anything else game breaking was unlocked there it would kinda take away from the interwoven progression the expansion tries so hard to achieve. Most people would leave it at that…

But it does make me wonder about vanity type items in the future, as updates, mods, or even vanilla.

I think as a feature request (or more likely an eventual mod someone or I will try and get around to) tiling made sense to me. It’s so dumb it works, a crimson colored marble flooring under your ever so expensive machines is almost so opulent it hurts. With the difficulty to get there, the risk on your expensive platforms, storing it, the difficulty getting it back. To take a gift from the gods and essentially use it as a coffee table is pretty much the ultimate punchline the game could possibly give. As funny as this is to me I can see many reasons this isn’t “vanilla fit” so I’m not too bummed and understand why this could only at most be a mod.

But I don’t think the dream is dead though. Along with space age, quality is added along in the expansion. Skipping to the point, you can either choose to bring everything that you need to make quality promethium science and quality recycle that to possibly get legendary promethium chunks or you can quality self-recycle promethium chunks into itself outright to get legendary chunks. Besides being a fun little trophy it would be a fun thing to see the community compete over who’s legendary orb horde is the largest.

Do you often feel that friends and family will make plans to do trips/holidays/fun days and even though they know you love all that stuff, they won't even tell you about it and you find out off Facebook!

My wife and I are recently feeling very swept aside and brushed under the carpet by some of her family.
  I have a daughter from a previous marriage, she's the eldest of all the young ones being seventeen.  All three of us have EDS (Ehlers Danlos Syndrome), fibromyalgia and a bunch of other stuff.

We got a call a few months ago from my Uncle in-law inviting ""just the adults"" to keep numbers down for Granny's birthday.  That's cool, we understand that.  We know my wife's cousin will be there as it's her Granny also.  The babies (obviously) but then to find out that Her cousin is bringing her friend with her and someone else is bringing so and so... But my daughter wasn't invited.

One of our favourite musicals is Moulin Rouge, it's coming to a theatre not too far from us next year and we see on FB that the in-laws have all booked a trip, including the sister and brother in-law.  

Don't get me wrong, we don't ""expect"" and invite, but this seems so very on purpose... The fact that they booked it before mentioning it too us despite having coffee with one of them last week. 

We got invited on a holiday to Scotland then someone else got invited in our place, only to be snorted and laughed at when I suggested we rent our own place for a week due to price (which was no more than a week in Cornwall tbh).

We got asked to babysit our Nephews, cancelled and turned down plans, only to be ditched at the last minute, because a nursery nurse is going to do it until the brother in-laws mum could have them...

I don't have a big and close family, I never have.  So maybe I just don't get how it is, but my wife is so upset and hurt by it.

We know we get looked down upon because we are both disabled and unfit for work, so we claim benefits.  My brother in-law whenever we're alone is very passive aggressive and doesn't believe that the Dr's can't even offer me pain relief.

We can't leave the house most days due to pain and I'm getting royally fecked off with being treated like a second hand citizen.

A little time ago I started to see some weird stuff between him and a female coworker. After many weird things he has been doing I decided to ask him if what is going on and of course he said nothing, he got very defensive and offended, he also said that in a relationship you must hide some stuff and don’t be completely honest. Which was my confirmation that I am right. I have to mention that I have seen enough things that don’t put him in the position of a loyal man. 



One of the things I have noticed among others was the car chair. The day before I was the last person that stood in the passenger seat and the next day he got to work and right after work he waited me to go for a coffee together and the chair was pulled back, very much and and leaned quite a lot back.. he said nobody got into the car that day. But if I was the last person who sat on the chair why was it completely changed. I also found out that he was going out during the working hours, with his work buddies and probably those women out, he put 15 kilos because of that .. the kilos are a good karma plus he is loosing a lot of hair, so much that he is thinking about hair implant, but he doesn’t has money to pay it. I realised all this relationship was a lie, the only thing he did was to lie and do his life while pretending he is in love, because friends and family sees him like the perfect boyfriend.



Anyway, after a lot of thinking I took the decision to leave him. I talked to a therapist, she said she thinks he is not cheating, but my gut is telling me otherwise. I have chronic anxiety and panic attacks and two years ago I started to suffer by gut inflammation, which is very painful.

I haven’t told him that I am preparing my leave. Why I am still with him? because I want to move to another country and it is not that easy to leave right away. It is very hard for me to pretend that nothing is going on, I am completely disgusted by him, I know every word  from him is another lie.. it is hard, but I try to think about the time when I will leave. It will be in a few months. 

I can tell he is sensing something, because after so many years he asked me to marry and I keep giving stupid reasons to pospone it. I know he must have some dark motive behind it.

Anyway now the only think I dream with is of the moment when I will break free and change my life. My therapist say to go out and start dating in the mean time, not serious but for fun, I also think would make me good, but I don’t want to risk to be catch and then he will look like the good guy and I am not in the mood. ",1,1729152339.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

In this post, we introduce our [FAQ](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/kdramas_101) and our [KDRAMA 101](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/generalresources), which contains some of the most commonly asked questions and other basic information about kdramas. This post will focus on a selection of questions about the Korean language and honorifics system, check out our FAQ for even more information.

If you have any additional questions about the information in this post or our FAQ, feel free to leave a comment with your question/feedback.

**What Is Hangeul/Hangul?**

The Korean phonemic writing system, in other words, the written Korean alphabet. [*See More Details*](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/generalresources#wiki_hangeul_and_the_korean_language)

**Why Do Koreans Use So Many English Words?**

Korean language has many naturalized words borrowed from different languages, many of the naturalized words from 21st century come from English (eg. coffee, orange juice).

**How To Romanize Korean Names**

According to [Korea's official romanization system](https://www.korean.go.kr/front_eng/roman/roman_01.do):

* (4) Personal names are written by family name first, followed by a space and the given name. As a rule, syllables in given names are not seperated by hyphen, but it is admitted to use a hyphen between syllables. (Transcription in (  ) is permitted.)

> Example

>> 민용하	Min Yongha (Min Yong-ha)

As for different ways of romanizing last names:

* Transcriptions of family names will be established additionally.

Basically, unifying romanization of last names will be a greater challenge since it involves a lot things (changing passports, verifying identities, cultural value of last names, etc.).

Learn more about [romanization](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/generalresources#wiki_romanization_of_korean) and [how to address others](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/generalresources#wiki_addressing_others). 

**What Is Honorifics/Polite Speech?**

Hierarchy is very important in Korean culture and the Korean language reflects that through its complex honorifics system, the proper use of which is crucial for all social interactions. The Korean honorifics system is comprised of both specialized vocabulary and grammar rules, the most famous being its speech levels (addressee honorifics; distinctive sentence enders). The use of the honorifics system conveys important information about the context of the speech and the speaker’s relationship with the subject (referent) and the listener (addressee) of the speech. The relationship indicated can be based on a variety of factors such as age, gender, social status, and degree of intimacy.

The most well-known aspect of the Korean honorifics system is its speech levels, also known as addressee honorifics (hearer honorifics), represented by distinctive sentence enders. The sentence enders are determined based on sentence type and the speaker’s relationship to the listener (addressee) of the speech. The selection of which speech level to use is heavily context and purpose dependent, thus different speech levels are used to indicate varying degrees of social hierarchy, familiarity, and formality along with the purpose or intent of the speech. This means that sometimes a speaker will even use a mix of different speech levels when interacting with the same person within a given situation. Furthermore, depending on the exact context of use and communicative intent of the speaker, the meaning conveyed by the speech may be opposite or different than what that speech level traditionally represents (for example, if the speaker was being sarcastic). Thus no one style is polite or impolite in all situations, the context must be considered when figuring out the intended meaning. In general though, when the speaker wants to show respect toward the listener (addressee) of their speech, they will choose a honorific speech level. 

When discussing Korean speech levels, note that the Korean language itself is split along the lines of honorific [존댓말 (jondaemal)] and non-honorific [반말 (banmal)] rather than informal and formal. And the key to determining whether honorific level should or should not be used depends on the relationship between the speaker and the listener and the situation. While it is true that in very formal situations, honorific forms will be used, it is not the case that non-honorific forms will always be used in non-formal situations. Honorific forms can still be used in informal situations.

An example to explain this is that you are trying to ask for directions from a stranger, for example the cashier at the convenience store. The situation is not a formal situation but you would still be using the honorific form (jondaemal) because you are addressing a stranger.

In any situation, formal or non-formal, if the listener is of superior status (due to age, generation, work relationship, etc.) and the speaker wants to acknowledge or demonstrate that difference, they would use honorifics when addressing the listener and at the same time ""lower"" themselves when talking about themselves. By ""lower"", it means that the speaker wants their language to reflect their respect for the listener. It's not used in the sense that the speaker consider themselves as inferior to the listener, just that they are trying to demonstrate their respect for the listener. If on the other hand, the speaker does not want to or need to lower themselves in comparison to the listener, their speech can reflect that too.   

>> 존댓말 (jondaemal) is honorific speech (also called polite speech), which includes both the deferential and the polite speech levels, and indicates that the speaker views the listener with respect and is honoring the listener. 존대 (jondae) literally means respect.

>> 반말 (banmal) is non-honorific speech (also called impolite speech), which includes both the plain and the intimate speech level. 반말 (banmal) can be literally translated as *half-speech*.

Below is a ***rough*** guide to honorific markers in Korean and their significance. For more details, see our [full section](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/generalresources#wiki_honorifics_and_speech_levels) on honorifics in our KDRAMA 101. 

**2 Important Things To Remember**

A speaker may use a mix of different speech levels when interacting with the same person within a given situation.

No speech level is polite or impolite in all situations; the context and intent of the speaker is the ultimate determinator of intended meaning. (In other words: *sarcasm* exists.) 

**When You Hear ~ᄇ니다  ~ᄇ니까?  ~ᄇ시오  ~ᄇ시다** { ~pnida  ~pnikka?  ~psio  ~psida }

> ***Speech Level***: Deferential

> ***Used When***: Public or formal discourse such as in broadcasting or conference presentations. | Addressing the public. | When a subordinate addresses a superior in a formal situation.


**When You Hear ~요 (~yo)**

> ***Speech Level***: Polite

> ***Used When***: Addressing someone of senior status in casual, non-formal, and everyday types of conversations. | Addressing someone who is an equal, based on factors such as age/status/power/etc. (coworkers, acquaintances, classmates, etc.) | Between strangers. | Addressing someone older. | In a new relationship (friendship/dating).


**When You Hear ~다  ~니/냐?  ~라  ~자** { ~da  ~ni?/nya?  ~ra  ~ja }

> ***Speech Level***: Plain

> ***Used When***: In written form for nonspecific listeners (books, magazines, etc.) | When a superior addresses a subordinate. | Addressing someone younger in casual situations but the relationship may not be a super close one. | Addressing close friends or otherwise agreed to by both parties (includes dating relationships).


**When You Hear ~어/아 ( ~eo/a)**

> ***Speech Level***: Intimate

> ***Used When***: Between close friends of similar age. | Between family members. | When an elder addresses a child.


**When You Hear ~님 (~nim) and 씨 (~ssi)**

> * ~nim and ~ssi are honorific title suffixes, used to show respect by the speaker for the person who’s name/job title is modified with the suffix.

> * ~nim shows the most respect and can be added directly to names or job titles with or without the surname (used to distinguish when multiple people hold the same position).

> * ~ssi can only be added to names, not job titles. Can be attached to full name (more formal/less intimate), only the given name (less formal/more intimate), or just the surname (implies the addressee is of lower social position).

**When You Hear 나 (na) and 우리 (uri) for I/Me and Us**

> * Used when speaker and listener are relatively equal to each other or are close to each other.

> * Generally not used in formal situations.

**When You Hear 저 (jeo) and 저희 (jeohui) for I/Me and Us**

> * Used when the listener is of superior status or when speaking with strangers.

> * Used often in formal situations.


**Addressing Someone By Name**

Koreans generally do not call people by their given names unless the speaker is a (close) friend, colleague, or superior of the listener. When names are used, they are often modified with honorific suffixes. Below are examples of use. 

> **Full Name + ~님/~씨** Used when addressing someone distant (no close personal relationship) or when a service employee is calling a customer. Used in conjunction with honorific speech levels (존댓말 (jondaemal)). (김진호 님 or 김진호 씨)

> **Given Name + ~씨** Used to address coworkers, acquaintances, friends or when a superior addresses a subordinate (such as in a work or college environment). Can imply that the interpersonal relationship is not a very close one. But can also just be a conscious decision by the relevant parties to remain respectful of each other. Used in conjunction with honorific speech levels (존댓말 (jondaemal)). (진호 씨)

> **Given Name** Used between (close) friends, classmates, or when someone older is addressing a younger person that they know or are familiar with. Parents would also call their children by just their given name. Used in conjunction with non-honorific speech levels (반말 (banmal)). (진호) *Note:* sometimes the vocative marker -a/-ya is added at the end of the name. This generally indicates a very close relationship. 

> **Full Name** When parents are addressing their child, it could either signify the child is in trouble (angry/exasperated tone) or the parent wants to talk to the child as an equal (friend) instead of asserting their parental authority (usually seen in dramas when the parent pulls the child over to sit and discuss something important). When used between friends or in a relationship, the person speaking is probably angry or the person being called is being absentminded/distracted and not paying attention. (김진호 (!))

**Addressing Someone By Title**

Koreans generally address each other by their (work) title. The honorific suffix ~nim can be added to the end of the title to show respect. This is especially the case when subordinates would address their superiors, they would use their superior’s title + ~nim suffix. It is possible to add the full name or just the surname before the title to clarify exactly who is being referred to if multiple people hold the same title. Coworkers may address each other as name + title without the ~nim suffix. When a superior addresses a subordinate, they generally do not add the ~nim suffix to the subordinate’s title or name. Some commonly used examples of titles:

|**Title**|**With Suffix**|**Meaning**|**Notes**|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-|
|사장|사장님|President, CEO, Owner|In a large company, refers to president of the company. For a shop/restaurant, refers to the owner. Can be used without attaching name in front.|
|과장|과장님|Manager|Can be used with just surname or full name.|
|감독|감독님|Director, Superintendent|Can be used with just surname or full name.|
|팀장|팀장님|Team Manager|Can be used with just surname or full name.|
|부장|부장님|Director, Department Head|Can be used with just surname or full name.|
|대리|대리님|Deputy, Assistant Manager|Can be used with just surname or full name.|
|회장|회장님|Chairman|Can be used without attaching name in front. When used to address the person directly, generally only surname is added. When used to refer to the person, full name may be added.|
|이사|이사님|Director|Can be used with just surname or full name.|
|선생|선생님|Teacher, Doctor|Can be used with just surname or full name.|
|교수|교수님|Professor|Can be used with just surname or full name.|

**Addressing Others By Their Social Position/Relationship**

Koreans may also address each other based on their social position or relationship. Below are the most commonly used ones.

* **Seonbae-Hubae (선배/후배)**

> 선배 (seonbae) is a Sino-Korean word that is often translated as a senior or elder in an organization, or an upperclassman when talking about school. But its use is not limited to a work or school setting, it can be applied more broadly as in “a seonbae in life”. Its Hanja is 先輩 and can be literally translated as prior (선/先) generation (배/輩). The priority does not depend on the age of the people in question but rather the achievement. So one can be a 선배 in school, work, or life achievements (such as marriage or having children).

> 후배 (hubae) is the corresponding Sino-Korean word that is often translated as a junior in an organization or an underclassman when talking about school. Its Hanja is 後輩 and can be literally translated as later (후/後) generation (배/輩). Again, the deciding factor is not the age of the people in question but the timing of the achievement.

> When the honorific suffix ~nim is added to 선배, it usually means that the two people are not very close personally or the situation is more formal (business meeting as opposed to coffee). When the hubae has a close relationship with the seonbae, they may use seonbae without the ~nim suffix.

* **Haksaeng (학생)**

> When an adult is talking to a student-aged young person that they do not know, they may address them with 학생 (haksaeng), which literally means student. This does not need to take place near a school, it could be anywhere. For example, it could be an adult asking a student on the street for directions.

* **{Child's Name} + Father/Mother**

> When adults are addressing other adults who are parents, it is possible to call the adult as their child’s name + father/mother instead of the adult's given name. So the father of the child will be called {child’s name} 아버님 (a-beo-nim, father), while the mother will be called {child’s name} 어머님 (eo-meo-nim, mother). If the conversation is one-one, such as when a teacher is talking only to one student’s parents without other people in the conversation, they may not add the child’s name in front and directly use 아버님 and 어머님.

**Kinship Terms**

Traditionally, Korean families were large and several generations would live together in a single household. As a result, kinship terms in Korean are well-developed and very specific according to the relationship in play. However, changes in social structure has affected the use of these terms and some are no longer used as often or how they are used has changed. Additionally, some kinship terms have been adapted for general use in daily life to refer to people other than relatives.

In addition to the abundance of kinship terms available, their proper use is complicated by the fact that choosing the appropriate term depends on who the listener is. 

Examples:

> * A grandson talking directly to his maternal grandmother can just address her as “grandmother” but if he was talking to his classmate, he would use “maternal grandmother” to describe her.

> * An uncle talking to his nephew about the nephew’s father would use “your father” instead of “my younger brother.” 
 
In order to differentiate the uses, this section on kinship terms will be split into two parts, the first part will address kinship terms when used to address relatives and the second part will highlight kinship terms in their other common uses.

I'm nothing special. Trading crypto for two years now. Started out carefully with just top 15 assets with the idea of building some gains higher than my bankaccount would provide for me. A year ago I started dabbling into low marketcap memecoins. Made some mistakes to learn, made some good trades. Basically managed to double my initial investment. Nothing special in meme land, but I'm a smart guy and I learn fast.



**About you**

Several reasons why you could be here reading. I'm going to assume you've heard about Kendu because it's pretty much impossible to not have.

1. You're a confident holder and you are here to read and share alpha. Welcome, I hope I don't dissappoint!
2. You're a holder and you are in doubt. You want to know more and have questions. Welcome! I hope my post will support you in some way. Please feel free to ask, me or anyone else in the KenduArmy will happily answer your questions. But even better: join the TG or one of the many X developer spaces with Miazaki and ask him your questions.
3. You're not into Kendu but sincerely want to know more because it's sparking an interest. Please read on. I hope I can help you make a decision on joining or not.
4. You'don't like Kendu and are just here to spread FUD. I'm not writing this for you. I know Reddit well enough to know that some just don't want information but just want to hate. You probably didn't even read a word of this post. Goodbye, have a nice life!



**Hype vs managing expectations**

People that know me from the TG know that I'm a realistic guy. I prefer real alpha over rumours. My believe is that it's better to surprise people with news that's actually better than the rumours, in stead of creating hype that in the end turns out to be a disappointment. But that makes bullposting about a memecoin hard. Many things happen behind the scenes and there will always be speculation. I try to manage expectations, but also realise many things start their own life. There is lots of alpha in Kendu and much is speculation. I'm trying to stick to the facts as much as possible.



**About Kendu**

Kendu had an all time high of 280MC and is about 7 months old. It's now sitting between 40 and 50 MC. That seems far off the ATH and consolidation is really taking longer than most expected. When I joined Kendu right before ATH Miazaki was talking about 1B MC in July and 10B MC before the end of the year. It's clear the first didn't happen and the second will need some sort of miracle. However, I've been realistic since the start and that helps with not losing faith. I've been buying Kendu all the way down to the lowest point of 35MC a few weeks back and am still buying. Why? Because I have rock solid faith that Kendu willl make me lifechanging money. We will go to 10B and far beyond. 



**From the outside looking in**

Over 90% of crypto traders are chartgazers. And that's fine. In most cases a chart will tell you everything you need to know about an asset, if you look at the right things. Even though I don't believe in TA for small MC coins, it is clear to see when a coin is over or when it is on the rise. Looking at Kendu all time high and the current price action I can understand people feeling negative when they are unknowing of what's actually going on. Especially with all the pump&dump shit going around. I will explain below why with Kendu things are really different. 



**Alpha**

* Marketcap: Kendu has been sitting at a 40-55 million marketcap for some time now. Thats roughly a 75% decline from all time high. However, that all time high was incredibly premature and mostly caused by catalysts. The number of holders at that time really didn't fall in line with the huge rally. It is much better in line now and basically you should look at Kendu as a new asset in DeFi. And looking at it in that way, we are outperforming almost every coin of the same age in numbers of holders, social media output and marketcap. The ones that reached higher in MC are funded by the market (Binance, are you reading?), not holders. Kendu is performing amazing. Just forget about that 280mc surge, begin your journey here. 

* Shiba connection: One of the catalysts that caused our ATH is the connection we had with Shiba. That connection has mostly faded because a large part of the Shiba team sold their souls to the Cabal. It is what it is. However, our dev Miazaki is friends with Shytoshi and is often quoting Ryoshi and using Ryoshi PfP in his X messages. It makes many in the TG wonder if Miazaki is actually Ryoshi or in closer contact to him than anyone suspects. Especially because Miazaki once said he could pump Kendu to 1B with just two clicks on X.... But, this is typically what I was referring to earlier. Managing expectations vs creating hype. We don't know the truth (yet) but it doesn't matter. In Kendu everyone working for the brand is equally important. 

* IRL assets (Decentralised Brand): we're in the DeFi space. But Kendu is more than that. We are not just looking at recycling DeFi money. We are not looking at bringing normies into DeFi. We are bringing the Kendu brand, in a decentralised way, to the people. The Kendu energydrinks are on sale online and finding there way to stores and universities (USA and Australia, for noe). Kendu Coffee will soon be released and brought under the attention of several coffeeshops and moviestudios in Hollywood. A community member is working on Kendu jewelry and someone will soon release a line of Kendu food supplements. There is Kendu Nights club events in India. All this to make Kendu a household name. Everyone in the community can release what they want under the Kendu name and is immediately sure he has thousands of potential customers and a huge KenduArmy working for promotion.

* Community: And that's the real strenght of Kendu. It's a marketing machine. It's a family. It's a cult. We're here for the long run and we are not going away until Kendu is a top 5 crypto with a 100B marketcap. There is no competition. I've been in many coins Telegram groups and all these CTO's, community driven cults and 'next whatevers' are literally in a different game. Name one and it's not even close community wise. They are botted, driven by payd KOL or influencers that dump as soon as it reaches a few million or become CTO after being rugged by the dev. Kendu is the only one thats worth looking at. The community is strong, real and unhinged to a level never seen before in crypto.

* Coinbase connection: Another hype thing, but one that cannot be denied. When advertising there new wallet, Coinbase used several names of huge cryptocurrencies. But up front and center was the name of Kendu. At that time a sub 100m memecoin, joined by all the great MC coins. Now, it could be just an intern with a Kendu bag seeing opportunity. But do you really believe that? Some think the Coinbase contract is already signed and just waiting for the right moment. I don't know if that's true. But there is definitely a link between Coinbase and Miazaki. Coinbase is probably the CEX with the best reputation out there, it doesn't have the foul stench Binance is acquiring at the moment. Real knows real.

**So.....**

I hope I gave you some insights into why I'm bullish on Kendu, despite (or thanks to) the current priceaction. And there is a lot more I'm forgetting to mention or leaving out because the article is getting to long. In short: Kendu is not your typical memecoin, it's a decentralised brand with more potential than anyone can see from the outside. That's why I want to invite everyone to visit our Telegram and to listen to our dev spaces. You really need to experience it to understand. 

  
Kind regards and see you soon!

A little time ago I started to see some weird stuff between him and a female coworker. After many weird things he has been doing I decided to ask him if what is going on and of course he said nothing, he got very defensive and offended, he also said that in a relationship you must hide some stuff and don’t be completely honest. Which was my confirmation that I am right. I have to mention that I have seen enough things that don’t put him in the position of a loyal man. 

One of the things I have noticed among others was the car chair. The day before I was the last person that stood in the passenger seat and the next day he got to work and right after work he waited me to go for a coffee together and the chair was pulled back, very much and and leaned quite a lot back.. he said nobody got into the car that day. But if I was the last person who sat on the chair why was it completely changed. I also found out that he was going out during the working hours, with his work buddies and probably those women out, he put 15 kilos because of that .. the kilos are a good karma plus he is loosing a lot of hair, so much that he is thinking about hair implant, but he doesn’t has money to pay it. I realised all this relationship was a lie, the only thing he did was to lie and do his life while pretending he is in love, because friends and family sees him like the perfect boyfriend.

Anyway, after a lot of thinking I took the decision to leave him. I talked to a therapist, she said she thinks he is not cheating, but my gut is telling me otherwise. I have chronic anxiety and panic attacks and two years ago I started to suffer by gut inflammation, which is very painful.

I haven’t told him that I am preparing my leave. Why I am still with him? because I want to move to another country and it is not that easy to leave right away. It is very hard for me to pretend that nothing is going on, I am completely disgusted by him, I know every word  from him is another lie.. it is hard, but I try to think about the time when I will leave. It will be in a few months. 

I can tell he is sensing something, because after so many years he asked me to marry and I keep giving al type of reasons to pospone it. I know he must have some dark motive behind it.

Anyway now the only think I dream with is of the moment when I will break free and change my life. My therapist say to go out and start dating in the mean time, not serious but for fun, I also think would make me good, but I don’t want to risk to be catch and then he will look like the good guy and I am not in the mood. 

TL;DR:it is time for me to find someone to make me happy and stop living in a lie.",1,1729151839.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

A few weeks ago a met up with a guy in my area who I had been chatting to for a while, and had met up for a quick coffee to see if we liked each other. He was cute and we vibed, so I was happy to see him again.  
He only has free time on a weekday daytime, and I sometimes have Wednesdays off, so managed to get some time together one day.  
He offered to pick me up to drive and go hangout a bit more far from our city.  
I suggested we could go to a love hotel not that far away.  
We drove for a damn hour whilst he was on work calls the whole time, so we could barely talk.  
We then got to a nice park to chat and I decide to cut to the chase and ask if we still wanted to to what we wanted to do.  
We then drove to a Christmas themed love hotel (lol Japan) and just as we were checking in he said, btw I have a small dick and I finish quickly.  
I was like ok... Because I genuinely don't care about size and I feel that if he could satisfy me before sex with touching and oral (which is my thing anyways). I gave him the benefit of a doubt.  
We got to the room, showered, and I wanted to be erotic by just wearing a robe and playing around doing foreplay first. 
He was butt naked ready to go, with all the lights on full brightness and no music or any sounds like a fan on or something.  
I changed the lighting and he wanted to keep it much brighter than I did, so I was like ok whatever.  
We pretty much just kissed he barely touched me down there, asked to have sex and came just as quickly as he said.  
Then we showered and we left because his work was blowing up his phone (he was in his suit before and supposed to go back).  
We were in there for less than damn hour, again on his phone calls to work for an hour back the way, and dropped me off.  
He wants to see me again, and I said only if he can be free of phone calls for at least 3 hours!!  
I really don't care about the size because I've had great sex with smaller guys, and bigger usually hurts me, but this was just taking the piss.  ",1,1729151712.0,adultery,1,1.0,False

I'm 3D printing a floater which will stay submersed in room temperature water tank (for a Senseo coffee machine). The same water will not stay long in contact with it, but maybe a day or two a time.

I am wondering whether the materials I mentioned (ABS/HIPS/ASA), which are the ones easiest to make watertight, will diffuse/leech/release harmful substances in water.

I would expect that the diffusion 

1. would affect only the content of the outermost layers, diffusion through plastic being extremely slow in general,
2. would be decreasing exponentially, for obvious reasons

so it should not be a problem, especially if for the first week the object is left in a separate container just for that purpose and the first water thrown away.

Boredom does things to you. After getting a *surprising* number of matches, I decided to go on a few dates. And let me tell you about my second date.

We both decided to take the WFH route and hang out at the same time (perks of remote work, right?). He even came to pick me up from my house—*green flag!* We headed to Starbucks, 'cause free WiFi *and* coffee? Two essentials for working, obviously. Things were going smoothly, conversation was flowing... until I noticed something. A hickey. Yep. A hickey.

Who shows up on a first date with a hickey?! Seriously, what was I expecting from a Bumble date?

But wait, it gets worse. When I casually (okay, not so casually) asked him about it, he goes, ""Oh, this? My friend's girlfriend gave it to me as a dare during a game."" *What?!* Is that supposed to make it better?

After that little *gem* of a conversation, we headed to ""Daily Sushi""—a Pan-Asian spot. Apparently, he was trying to impress me because, yes, I’m a K-drama fan (he was really trying). But after the hickey incident, he had already lost a *lot* of points.

We were both supposed to be working during this time, right? I got pulled into a few work calls, ended up working for about three hours. And what does he do? Takes a nap. Yep. Three hours. (I’m sure he must be tired after having a rough night with the *hickey girl* )

Oh, and get this—he called me ""blind"" because I wear glasses. Now, I usually take jokes pretty well, but my eyes? That’s a sensitive topic for me.

At this point, I was ready to log off and leave. But he insisted we go to a library because he knows I love reading. So, we go, explore the shelves, and he even read some romantic lines from a book for me. Cute, right? Well, it was... until he hit me on the head with that same book.

By now, the whole vibe felt more ""friendly hangout"" than ""romantic first date."" Where were the butterflies? The excitement? The nervousness? I felt none of that.

Then he drops the bomb. He tells me he feels a special connection and wants to meet again. I straight-up told him, ""I can only see you as a friend, not more."" And his response? ""I’ll make you fall in love with me."" Sir, we just met. Future talk already?

He dropped me home, and the date ended with a hug.

So, here's the question: *Do I give him another shot or stick with my gut and move on?* Also, would you go on a second date with someone who naps during a work date, brings hickeys from ""dare games,"" and throws around books (literally) ?",1,1729151643.0,SwipeRightStories,0,1.0,False

**Background**

Running has always been a bit of an on-again, off-again affair for me. Back in my school days, I dabbled in it but that’s all. In my late 20s, I briefly started a workplace running club but got distracted and moved on.

Then came the knee injury. Mid-20s, playing football (that's soccer for you on the other side of the pond) where a fateful twist (and crunch) ended any aspiring amateur career. Ever since, it's been a bit of a weakness - my own personal Achilles' heel, only located slightly higher.

Fast forward to my mid-30s through to age 40, and let's just say the bathroom scales and I weren't on speaking terms. I struggled with weight, fluctuating between overweight and obese according to the BMI scale. Every year from 2018 to 2022 followed the same frustrating pattern: January to May would be fantastic - I'd be the poster child for healthy living - but as soon as summer rolled around, I'd slip back into old habits. Kettle chips (crisps), homemade wine, and milk-chocolate digestive biscuits have a lot to answer for.

I had years of on-and-off trail running, but consistency was never my strong suit. I decided enough was enough. In September 2023, I drew a line in the sand. I became determinedly consistent with walks, runs, and strength training. No more yo-yo dieting, no more half-hearted attempts. This was the year I would stay within a reasonable weight!

And what better way to commit than by signing up for a long-half marathon and an ultra-marathon? Because naturally, when you're trying to lose weight and get fit, running 50 miles up and down mountains is the logical next step.

Ultra-running became a cornerstone of my new lifestyle. I briefly shared some of my experiences and progress in some Reddit comments. But reading the experiences and camaraderie of others was incredible, fuelling my determination even more.

**The Build-Up**

Training for a 50-mile mountain race across the Brecon Beacons isn't something you decide on a whim - unless you're particularly fond of pain. I did decide on a whim…

I began my journey on the 13^(th) of May 2024, starting from a base mileage of approximately 50km per week, which, funnily enough, was the exact peak of my only previous race on 4^(th) of May 2024: a 27km circular loop through the same mountainous terrain.

Determined to push my limits, I embarked on a 19-week training plan, with a 5-week peak volume period. The first two peak weeks saw me clocking up 105–115km, followed by a self-supported 53km ultra run in the third week. I wrapped up my peak period with another two weeks at 105–110km, also hitting a peak elevation gain of over 4,000m per week.

To prepare for the gruelling challenge ahead, I did two self-supported runs of over 50km during this peak period - both my longest runs since a self-supported trail marathon about a month prior. I mostly didn’t neglect strength training, though I sacrificed some of it towards the end in favour of more mileage volume. I also managed to squeeze in approximately 30-40km of walking per week, usually with a 1,000m elevation gain. Who needs rest days, anyway? (I jest, I did have one rest day each week!).

I entered the taper injury-free, minus a few niggles and the classic taper tantrums. Mentally, I felt strong and well-prepared. Plan A was to complete the race in the 14-hour mark, though I saw this as somewhat ambitious. Plan B was to finish under 16 hours, which seemed reasonable - as long as I could actually finish. Plan C was simply the classic completion plan. Given that this was a mountainous 50-miler with over 3,800m (over 12,000 feet) of elevation gain, finishing would be an achievement in itself.

I optimised and tested all my gear meticulously. Here's a picture of my kit laid out like a tactical military operation (or at least would be for an amateur military operation…):

https://preview.redd.it/rzqpu69sj9vd1.png?width=867&format=png&auto=webp&s=fcf190a066eb3639ead963e692a8d278d6db94e4

**Pre-Race**

The day had finally arrived. This was my first 50-miler and my first ultra race. I woke up at the unreasonable hour of 3 am and went through my pre-race ritual, which I'd practised during training. It included a cup of coffee (runners will know why), a bacon sandwich, and some light fruit. Just to reduce any uncertainty, let's just say the coffee ensures there are no unexpected pit stops later on.

I triple-checked my kit and dressed for the day. Having registered at the race HQ the night before, all I needed to do was be at Pontneddfechan before 6 am, when the bus would take us to the start point at Hay-on-Wye. Ever the early bird, I was there by 5:20 am.

It was a family affair; I walked to the start with my fiancée and children, not entirely sure how I felt about the race, but grateful for their support. As I boarded the bus, I waved goodbye, with classic me trying to appear more confident than I felt.

During the bus journey, I chatted with a mix of experienced runners -some tackling their first ultra, others their first 50-miler, and a few with 100-milers already under their belts. Everyone was nervous to some degree. I met two people I wouldn't see again and one who would become a familiar companion during the race.

Upon arriving at Hay-on-Wye, we were informed of a slight hiccup… someone had forgotten to collect the key for the main toilets. This caused some concern for a few runners, but thanks to my morning coffee, I'd already ""taken care of business.""

Looking around, my nerves began to kick in, but I reminded myself that I was well-trained and mentally strong for this occasion. I thrive when others are nervous, so chatting with fellow runners helped ease my own jitters!

As we waited, some of the 100-milers arrived at the checkpoint. For them, it was the halfway mark, and they'd been running through the night to get here. We cheered - they looked knackered. In a few hours, that would be me, but at least I wouldn't have another 50 miles to run afterwards!

I did some final pre-race checks on my kit.

https://preview.redd.it/ncjba7ytj9vd1.png?width=795&format=png&auto=webp&s=83dbed6ec08716040dffac84d37a118c02bcc201

As 8 am approached, we gathered for the pre-race briefing, followed by the countdown. The adventure was about to begin.

**Start (Hay-on-Wye) to CP1 (Gospel Pass): \~9.5km**

Standing at the start line, I glanced around at my fellow runners. A mantra echoed in my head: *""Don't go off too fast, don't go off too fast.""* But as the announcer said ""30 seconds to go,"" a rebellious thought surfaced: *""Sod it, I've worked too hard not to smash it.""* Feeling confident in my training, I decided to stick with the front of the pack and perhaps build a buffer.

The race started, and off we went! As usual (I say usual, but what I really mean is my only other race!), my breathing felt odd for the first 5-10km. I tried to breathe normally, but it always seems loud or irregular at the start of a race. Perhaps it's just adrenaline, nerves, or the novelty of running surrounded by others - I usually run in solitude.

I managed to stick with the front pack as much as possible, though the guy who would eventually come first had already disappeared within the first couple of kilometres. As we settled into our pace and left the mid-pack behind, we formed a cluster of four: Adam, who was running just a bit faster than I probably should have; Natalie, who would finish second overall and first female; Joe, one of the runners I'd met on the bus; and myself.

I wanted to stick with these three to push the pace, and also because Adam seemed to know exactly where he was going, allowing me to forget about navigating for a while. Around 6-7km into the race, I definitely noticed we were going faster than I'd planned. I started to wonder if I'd made a mistake but decided to push through, hoping I could recover during the downhills. This first section was mostly uphill, which plays to my strengths, so I didn't want to miss the opportunity.

We followed the route south along Offa's Dyke, gaining altitude most of the time, and then veered north towards the first main peak, Hay Bluff. Visibility was poor, and there was a risk of heavy rain and thunderstorms.

https://preview.redd.it/kllb7b9vj9vd1.png?width=831&format=png&auto=webp&s=b339cfee109e8923e7591c90856a0309083f89de

I quickly experienced some sliding downhill in my Brooks Catamount 3 - the muddy terrain was not ideal! I was strong on the uphill and flat sections, often catching up with the others, but they were much better at technical descents than I was. Something to improve on before the Ultra-Trail Snowdonia 100k in May 2025.

I settled into the fast pace, hanging on by sheer determination. Deep down, I expected to have to ease off and let the others go ahead, but for now, I enjoyed the company and the challenge. From Hay Bluff, we descended to the first checkpoint at Gospel Pass. I stopped briefly to swap out two bottles of Tailwind, while the others pushed straight through without stopping. Apparently, pit stops are for the weak! (Note, they did not actually say this 😊).

**CP1 (Gospel Pass) to CP2 (Cockett Hill): 22km**

It took me about 15 minutes to catch up with Joe, Natalie, and Adam, eventually rejoining them partway up Twmpa, our next main peak. From there, we followed the Cambrian Way, contouring around ridges but still unable to see much due to low cloud cover and drizzle.

Shortly after, we were battered by wind, rain, and hailstones! It was like being attacked by a swarm of angry bees. We made jokes about the ""lovely views"" as we peered through the fog. Natalie kept racing ahead, occasionally heading in the wrong direction before circling back. She joked that she was notorious for her navigational skills.

The four of us remained mostly together, tackling a rollercoaster of hills including Y Grib, Pen y Grib, Castell Dinas, and Mynydd Troed, before heading towards our next checkpoint, Cockit Hill.

The descent from Castell Dinas and especially Mynydd Troed was really slippery. The others kept pulling away from me on each technical descent, but this was fortunate because it meant they didn't witness my glorious slide on my arse for about 50 metres down a hill. Partly due to my trail runners not being well-suited for the muddy terrain, but also perhaps my technique needs further work. Each time, I caught up with the others on the flat sections - which were few and far between - and the uphills, of which there were plenty.

https://preview.redd.it/apr0k1mwj9vd1.png?width=741&format=png&auto=webp&s=2043789f7e72d3d33572ba230d131734188cfaea

**CP2 (Cockett Hill) to CP3 (Llangynidr): 32.5km**

At the checkpoint, I did my usual two-bottle Tailwind swap and indulged in my first slice of orange. We began the slog up Mynydd Llangorse, followed by a pleasant, stable descent that continued along the Beacons Way. This section was a much-needed respite after the brutal battering my quads and calves had endured earlier.

As we progressed, Adam and Natalie started to break away while Joe and I settled into our own pace. It wasn't wise to keep pushing at their speed, and we'd already established ourselves towards the front of the pack, though quite some way behind first place.

By the time we reached Bwlch, we'd lost sight of the other two. Occasionally, we'd see them somewhere up a mountain in the distance, but not too far ahead so we knew that we were still pushing the pace.

From Bwlch, we mixed between light trails, road sections, and treacherous bridges with people competing with us in their Range Rovers. One lady in particular frowned at us, and Joe and I joked that we knew what she was thinking as she looked at us: *""Real men do Ironman.""*

We followed the canal route to the next checkpoint, only getting briefly lost because my GPX points didn't correspond correctly with the app I was using. From that point onwards, we decided Joe's route/app combination would be better. Finally, we arrived at the next checkpoint, which also held our drop bags and a chance to change gear if desired. I felt that the drop bags should have been available later, but I guess there was a location-limiting reason for making them available here.

**CP3 (Llangynidr) to CP4 (Blaen y Glyn): 46km**

I did my usual Tailwind swap and grabbed another slice of orange, along with a glass of Coke for a sugar boost. I decided to change my socks - more for psychological comfort than necessity - and swapped out my empty food packets for another eight hours' worth of fuel. I decided to leave behind two sachets of Tailwind because, for some reason, I felt I wouldn't need them and that I'd be finishing faster than expected. Famous last words?

We were pleased with our progress so far. We weren't far behind the rest of the pack at this point (except for first place), and the next few runners were far enough behind that we could take it easy for a bit and prepare for the tough challenges ahead.

Leaving the checkpoint, I felt strong and ecstatic that we were over halfway! I had a few muscle niggles, and the insoles of my shoes were unexpectedly riding up beneath my toes, which was uncomfortable but nothing major. Something I would need to keep an eye on at the next checkpoint.

https://preview.redd.it/6jotm1ixj9vd1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b8662f1cf6dd445b7e0e7ff4ef20674ba05a8dd

We hit a road section, which was a relief for my quads and calves but brought pain to other muscle groups. I tried to ignore the discomfort and concentrated on chatting with Joe, breathing, and maintaining good running form. The road was a good time to get a grip on my form rather than the Chuckle Brothers form I’d been using on the trails.

That relief ended with a challenging climb up Tor y Foel, with its steep incline and multiple demoralising false summits. This hill is much harder than it appears on paper and felt like it took forever. This was where my first mental battle began. While I never doubted that I'd finish the race, thoughts like *""when is this hill ever going to end?""*, *""do I really enjoy this?""*, and *“this is hard”* started to creep in. Joe was amazing at this point; he kept talking, and even though I couldn't always respond, I really appreciated his high spirits. Never stop talking Joe!

Things got easier after Tor y Foel. The steady descent replaced the mental battles with sheer exhilaration. The weather was clearing, and we could now see the Beacons peaking over the reservoir, which helped lift our spirits. We soon encountered forest sections, scree slopes (ok, not quite that bad!), and more road sections. The mental wall was long gone, and I was feeling good again, so we picked up the pace.

Then the climbs started again, up towards the next checkpoint - a seemingly endless uphill that was only partially runnable. More minor mental battles ensued, but nothing that our ultra-train couldn't handle!

**CP4 (Blaen y Glyn) to CP5 (A470): 60km**

At the checkpoint, the Run, Walk, Crawl volunteers asked how I was feeling - about my muscles, energy levels, and so on. I suspect they were assessing whether I should continue. Despite feeling jaded and a bit tired, I had no intention of dropping out. Besides, a few more glasses of Coke and slices of orange worked wonders.

Joe commented that they only had the cheap version of Coke on display but could see the original Coca-Cola hidden away. I responded, ""That was the best bloody Coke I've ever had in my life"" and we both roared with laughter. Perhaps you had to be there...

I knew what to expect coming out of this checkpoint. I'd run up the beast of a climb - Craig y Fan Ddu through to Bwlch y Ddwyallt - twice before and knew the rolling Brecon Beacons lay ahead.

The climb started fine. I was a bit tired, my calves were hurting a bit more, and one specific area of my quads was feeling iffy, but nothing some tactical stretches couldn't solve. We followed the Cambrian and Beacons Way along another rollercoaster of ridges and hills.

https://preview.redd.it/69ljq1gyj9vd1.png?width=822&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e493051fa8fb2683654ab991bc8929cb019767c

We crossed the 50km mark, which was an important milestone for me, and I noted that I'd achieved a personal record. At 54km, I was now into unknown territory - the furthest I'd ever run. Around this point, the risk of calf and quad cramping increased, so I needed to stretch them out as I ran by altering my form, moving through the gears until I reached a good pace. We were still making great time and having great fun!

The terrain turned much more technical along the Brecon Beacon ridges, with lots of puddles, narrow sections, obstacles, scree, talus, and day walkers. Even though it was mostly flat, I couldn't keep pace with Joe and was hitting another mental wall. Joe was torn; he didn't want to leave me behind but also wanted to push the pace. We'd had already kind of agreed that if one of us needed to slow down, the other should carry on. I insisted he go ahead, assuring him I'd catch up if I could. Joe said he'd wait for me at the finish.

This was a good decision because a 20 to 30-minute spell at my own pace, using my own strengths, was exactly what I needed. The climb up Fan y Big was challenging, but I started to recover from my slump and felt strong enough to pick up my pace again.

By the descent from Fan y Big, I could see Joe getting closer and closer. At some point towards the bottom, I finally caught up, shouting, *""I'm baaaack!""* He smiled and said, *""I'm glad you made it.""*

We climbed and descended Cribyn and noticed that we'd now met up with the 50k runners. We started overtaking a lot of them, which also raised our spirits because we'd been running for 7 to 8 hours. Many of the 50k runners were shocked to find out that we were running the 50-mile race and still looking strong. That helped me feel like it was all worthwhile.

During the Cribyn climb, we also passed Adam (remember him?), who later said he'd hit the wall at this point. We cheered him on, told him he was doing amazing, and carried on up the hill at our own pace.

The climb up Pen y Fan was expectedly hard on tired legs, but we made it! This was the point I knew that, barring an injury, I'd be finishing this race.

https://preview.redd.it/ep0qff7zj9vd1.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c49c86ade42efe32e826dee5be5fa26c2cce871

The descent down Pen y Fan was swift, dodging all the walkers who looked at us as if we were crazy - though, I suppose we must be to some extent. I felt fully recovered (in 50-mile terms) by the time we got to the A470.

We made our way to the A470 checkpoint, where there was a buzzing atmosphere full of 50k runners - a nice change from previous checkpoints where we were usually the only runners. Once again, I had a glass (or three) of Coke and a slice (or three) of orange. At this point, I wished I'd packed fewer Trek Bars, which I could no longer stomach even though they'd worked well in training, and instead packed more gels. Live and learn, I guess! I’ll put it down to the pace difference between training and race.

 

**CP5 (A470) to CP6 (Ystradfellte): 72km**

While I knew I'd finish, there was still the challenge of Fan Fawr, muddy and boggy terrain, and, to a lesser extent, the climb up Fan Llia.

I tried not to think too much about the Fan Fawr incline. Joe was having a few niggles at this point but nothing to worry about. I was feeling strong after the slog up Fan Fawr, but from my training runs in this area, I knew exactly where I was and reminded myself that I was going to finish. Our spirits were high, but as Joe correctly pointed out, *""That was a big hill that took forever.""*

Shortly after summiting Fan Fawr, Adam caught up and overtook us. He'd obviously broken through his wall and was back to flying across the terrain. I wouldn't see Adam again until the end.

The terrain between Fan Fawr and Fan Llia was challenging due to the grass height, bogs (I laughed when Joe went knee-deep into one, thanking him for helping me avoid it), missing tracks, and very uneven ground. There were even a few rivers and streams to cross, adding to the sense of adventure.

By the time we climbed Fan Llia, I could see my own training mountain near my home. *""It's just over there,""* I said to Joe. We were well ahead of time; my Plan A of a sub-15-hour finish was definitely on the cards. We even started talking about the impossible: could we actually finish in the 12-hour mark? Surely not, we thought, but decided to keep pushing - sensibly - and find out.

At some point, my fiancée messaged me asking if I actually only had 12km remaining, as she was expecting me much later. I managed my first two-word text message reply during the race: *""Smashing it.""*

I think Joe and I really enjoyed the section between Fan Llia and Ystradfellte. It was all downhill (in the good way) from here, and we laughed, joked, and reflected on what we'd already achieved. This section cemented our brothers-in-arms experience and was great fun. I never actually expected to ""have a laugh"" during a 50-mile mountain run!

We hit a road section after Fan Llia, which wasn't the most interesting - though I pointed out that while tarmac sucks, the mountains still looked stunning. We mostly maintained a nice easy pace, but sometimes even pushed to about 5 to 5:30 minutes per kilometre where possible, which was surprising considering how long we'd been running. I felt very strong (\*with niggles) as we entered the next checkpoint.

**CP6 (Ystradfellte) to Finish (Pontneddfechan): 80km**

We stayed at the checkpoint for only a few of minutes. I realised I'd carried too much food! I'd planned for 16 hours and was now likely to finish in the 12-hour mark. I had extra Trek Bars and Hi5 bars that I couldn't stomach, but also didn’t need. I'd finished all my Tailwind though, which was good because it meant my decision at the drop bag to leave two behind was the correct one. I had one remaining gel, which I took with a few miles remaining for that little extra boost.

At the checkpoint, we were told there was about 5.5 miles remaining. That felt like such a short distance, yet also such a long one. At this point, we knew no one in the 50-mile race would be catching us up. We weren't sure if we were currently in fourth or fifth place but decided to just take it easy for the rest of the race and not get injured.

I still felt strong for the road and forest sections, sometimes running at a good pace of 5 to 5:30 minutes per kilometre, with short tactical walk breaks for uphill sections because, well, why not?

I enjoyed overtaking a few more people running the 50k race, especially kudos to the guy wearing hiking boots rather than trail runners! That must have hurt…

The sun was just starting to set, and we couldn't believe we'd beaten all the mountain and technical sections in the daylight. We decided to turn on our head torches ready for the waterfall of Sgwd Yr Eira.

From this point, everything felt a bit chilled, and we both felt in great spirits, though Joe was worried his family wouldn't make it to the finish line because we were so far ahead of schedule.

The steps to the waterfall were cruel! Joe, being much taller than me, seemed to handle them better, but I needed to do an awkward jump-hop-step movement that came with a reasonable amount of pain. We went under the waterfall (through the back), did a little muddy climb into the forest, and continued along a narrow single track with considerable puddles, nettles, thorns, and stones to dodge. I didn’t make it out scratch free…

The final kilometre lasted forever and was made worse by another set of cruel steps, polished and very slippery. I had to develop a new weird technique involving steps, hops, side lunges, and handrail holding. Not an elegant ending, but Joe and I found a way to make it funny - we'd hit that point of insanity!

We started talking about how we would cross the line together and decided on arms around each other, like brothers for the day.

The final moments were surreal. It was dark, but suddenly we were surrounded by lights. I heard my fiancée and our kids but couldn't see them - just focused on the finish line!

We came joint fifth which was amazing! We’ll, technically I came sixth and Joe beat me by a second, but I don’t think either of us will argue the case on that one!

https://preview.redd.it/whtogxb0k9vd1.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=df206421cdea520f58e4cc2838b07f7f7a5f38ba

It turns out Joe's family just made it in time and saw him crossing the finish line. After 12 hours and 9 minutes of running, they made it with seconds to spare. What timing!

https://preview.redd.it/gnv3t601k9vd1.png?width=546&format=png&auto=webp&s=87f3f02efda01c246376e01b4164980ef25d08ec

Apparently, to my dot watchers, Joe (number 43) was the enemy, while I (number 61) was the enemy of Joe's dot watchers. Nobody could tell we were running together!

**Post-Race**

I limped back to the car, and my fiancée drove us to KFC and then back home. I took the best shower I've had in a long time - I was filthy. The kids went to bed, and I cracked open a beer and had a couple of drinks until I could finally stomach the KFC.

Reflecting on the race, I felt it was well-run by Run, Walk, Crawl, and the volunteers were excellent and so helpful - a big shout-out to them! They lifted my spirits and helped me with the Tailwind transitions, which made a world of difference and made me feel emotional at the time.

The photographers on the day were great, popping up like ninjas when you least expected a picture, lifting our spirits along the way with jokes and jests. He even managed to catch Joe in the act!

https://preview.redd.it/tz4l8mu1k9vd1.png?width=822&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef8a7838ec61f6d45d93b5baca226d3c95b42458

My training was spot on; there's not much I would change, though I do need to improve my technical descent for the next race.

Nutrition was good but not optimal. Tailwind every hour worked well, as did my first two four-hour fuel cycles (every hour a Tailwind, plus on hour one a Trek Bar, hour two a gel, hour three a Hi5 bar, hour four a gel or packet or crisps). But after two cycles, I should switch to gels only - and Coke and oranges at the aid stations, of course.

In the end, finishing the Black Beacon 50 Mile Mountain Race was an incredible experience - filled with challenges, laughter, and new friendships. It taught me a lot about myself, my training, and the kindness of strangers who become companions on the trail. Here's to the next adventure!",2,1729151573.0,trailrunning,0,1.0,False

A little time ago I started to see some weird stuff between him and a female coworker. After many weird things he has been doing I decided to ask him if what is going on and of course he said nothing, he got very defensive and offended, he also said that in a relationship you must hide some stuff and don’t be completely honest. Which was my confirmation that I am right. I have to mention that I have seen enough things that don’t put him in the position of a loyal man. 



One of the things I have noticed among others was the car chair. The day before I was the last person that stood in the passenger seat and the next day he got to work and right after work he waited me to go for a coffee together and the chair was pulled back, very much and and leaned quite a lot back.. he said nobody got into the car that day. But if I was the last person who sat on the chair why was it completely changed. I also found out that he was going out during the working hours, with his work buddies and probably those women out, he put 15 kilos because of that .. the kilos are a good karma plus he is loosing a lot of hair, so much that he is thinking about hair implant, but he doesn’t has money to pay it. I realised all this relationship was a lie, the only thing he did was to lie and do his life while pretending he is in love, because friends and family sees him like the perfect boyfriend.



Anyway, after a lot of thinking I took the decision to leave him. I talked to a therapist, she said she thinks he is not cheating, but my gut is telling me otherwise. I have chronic anxiety and panic attacks and two years ago I started to suffer by gut inflammation, which is very painful.

I haven’t told him that I am preparing my leave. Why I am still with him? because I want to move to another country and it is not that easy to leave right away. It is very hard for me to pretend that nothing is going on, I am completely disgusted by him, I know every word  from him is another lie.. it is hard, but I try to think about the time when I will leave. It will be in a few months. 

I can tell he is sensing something, because after so many years he asked me to marry and I keep giving stupid reasons to pospone it. I know he must have some dark motive behind it.

Anyway now the only think I dream with is of the moment when I will break free and change my life. My therapist say to go out and start dating in the mean time, not serious but for fun, I also think would make me good, but I don’t want to risk to be catch and then he will look like the good guy and I am not in the mood. ",1,1729151214.0,relationshipproblems,1,1.0,False

She is getting more and more frail, frequent falls - but is fiercely independent. It is not feasible for any of us to live with her or for her to live with any of us. She won’t have carers as she has to pay for them herself. My sister in law visits every morning to get her up/washed/dressed and breakfast. And depending on work schedules one of us visits in the evening. She now has to walk with a zimmer frame rather than a stick. 

We have recently installed wifi so that we can maybe install some remote monitoring gadgets as there have been times where she has fallen in the night and been on the floor until my SIL arrived. So far she is refusing everything but we will continue with the conversations. She agreed to an Alexa so that is a start. 
So what are we looking for
- any useful Alexa skills available in the uk for either her benefit or ours
- any useful Alexa compatible gadgets to make life easier for her. Thinking along the lines of answering the door, boiling a kettle etc or even better a coffee machine that could make a coffee for her. Control central heating. We know we will need to purchase these items and smart plugs etc but that’s ok.
- we want to make her home cooked meals - but she really isn’t safe using the cooker and struggles with the microwave. Is there anything out there that i could put a hot home cooked meal into and it would keep it warm enough for her to eat maybe a few hours later (she has arthritis so can’t be too difficult to open)

Trying to be overly detailed and I hope that's ok!

Some background: **7 nights in Oahu** (Waikiki) and **5 nights in Maui** (Kaanapali), **rental car** on both islands, two adults and a **6 year old** in tow, one of us is strictly **gluten free** (Celiac). The gluten free requirement does limit food exploration and will result in a few repeated places due to comfort!

**OAHU:**

Day 0 (Travel)

* Land in Honolulu, get rental car
* Get snacks / drinks at Target Ala Moana (new Target in International Market Place opening 10/27/24)
* Dinner at **Paia Fish Grill** (fish tacos with rice and potatoes)
* Pool time at the hotel (after dark)

Day 1 (Waikiki)

* Breakfast at **Hideout at the Laylow Hotel** (gluten free Loco Moco, macadamian nut foam for the coffee)
* Exploring Waikiki / Shops
* **Catamaran ride** from Maita'i Catamaran (groupon available), pickup at beach by Sheraton, 2 hour trip with cash bar. Affordable, simple, fun views of Waikiki and Diamond Head
* Treat at **Banan Waikiki Beach Shack** (gluten-free banana-based ice cream, make sure to get the macadamia nut butter and puffed quinoa as toppings)
* Brunch at **Hula Grill Waikiki** (balcony views of beach and diamond head)
* Beach / wave / bodyboarding fun with the family
* Dinner at **Paia Fish Grill**

Day 2 (East Side)

* Breakfast at **Hideout at the Laylow Hotel** (bonus rainbow sighting)
* Drive to **Kualoa Ranch** for Jurassic Adventure Tour (the natural beauty of the ranch is undeniable, prepare to get rained on and we did, the movie set pieces are not mind blowing, but neat, I'd still recommend it for the adventure of it / views / guides)
* **Byodo-In Temple** (Worth a short side trip for its beauty and bonus if you were a fan of *Lost*, go feed the fish, ring the bell, enjoy.)
* Drive Back to Waikiki
* Dinner at **Basalt** (prime rib was *good, not great*\*\*,\*\* but for Waikiki decently priced, not too busy)

Day 3 (Waikiki/East)

* Breakfast sandwiches/donuts at **Donut King Waikiki** (no gluten free options)
* Beach / Walking Waikiki
* **Island Vintage Shave Ice** treat
* Strong recommendation from a friend had us drive out to sunset dinner at **Haleiwa Joe's Haiku Gardens** in Kaneohe (no reservations taken, waited 30 min and got an amazing balcony table, fun cocktails, great gluten free fish dish with lobster sauce, view of the gardens and then transition to torches was beautiful, recommended)
* Back in Waikiki, walked around and a bonus **Banan** treat

Day 4 (Central/North)

* Woke up early to **acquire Hanauma Bay Tickets** (opens 7am) for 2 days later, not that difficult if you make an account on the website in advance (easy)
* **Donut King / Kona Coffee** breakfast
* **Dole Plantation and Gardens** (touristy of course, but the gardens were the real highlight, the train is short but the kid loved it). Get a dole whip and relax.
* **Maui Mike's Chicken** in Wahiawa (gluten free roasted chicken, fries, all sauces except teriyaki)
* **Matsumoto Shave Ice** in Haleiwa (was no line, cheap, enjoyable, I found it too sweet but good)
* **Toa Luau** in Waimea Valley (we got to the Valley too late to walk to the waterfall, but Luau passes allow access to the valley for a week before/after, really enjoyed this Luau with a family-run feel, had to organize gluten free food beforehand and it was good but smaller than normal portions, and no seconds. The fire dancing really is great at night and I'd do the nighttime over daytime one just for this fact)
* Night drive back to Waikiki

Day 5 (East/North)

* **Donut King / Kona Coffee** breakfast
* **Nu'uanu Pali Lookout** (worth the stop, silly to pay the parking fee which is all day for a short visit, but what are you going to do, incredible views of the East side)
* **Ho'omaluhia Botanical Garden** (a highlight, free entrance and you can experience the whole thing just driving, but obviously getting out at different sections is ideal, enjoyed the Loko Waimaluhia section, the overlook across from Lehua section, and the park area in Nui section)
* Lunch at **Whiskey Smoke BBQ** (wasn't expecting good Texas BBQ in Hawaii, but was really good, gluten free meats, sauces and sides)
* Beautiful **drive** up East side to North Shore (stopped at multiple beautiful beaches / parks but didn't mark names, so many options, a highlight)
* **Waimea Valley** (makeup trip because we couldn't make it before Toa Luau which gave us access, full walk to the waterfall and stopping and enjoying the gardens, didn't swim at falls but looked easy/fun)
* Sunset at **Haleiwa Beach Park**
* Dinner at **Uncle Bo's** in Haleiwa (separate gluten free menu, the kalua pig fried rice was amazing, baked mauna kea fish dish)

Day 6 (Hanauma Bay/East/Waikiki)

* Had an 8:20 reservation at **Hanauma Bay**, and I know there are a lot of strong opinions about it. So i'll say this, having my 6 year old with me who's a good swimmer but new to snorkeling, Hanauma Bay made it easy, equipment for rent, walk into the water, etc. It does feel very controlled (and that may be good for some), and it's not the same quality of reef/wildlife as when I went as a kid, but overall it was a successful adventure for us that made it easier to snorkel later. So take that as you will! With the 8:20am reservation, when we showed up at the parking lot at 8 there was tons of parking, and with the video presentation and everything we were in the water by 9. Don't reserve umbrellas from the Bay they are in a stuck spot on the far side of the beach. The tram up/down the hill is included in the price.
* **Drove around Hawaii Kai** side to the East side which was beautiful
* **Maui Mike's** **Chicken** (might as well eat at the other location on the island)
* **Island Snow Shave Ice** in Kailua (I thought the best shave ice I had in Oahu, super fine ice texture, natural syrup options, etc)
* Back to Waikiki, ended up at the Waikiki Wall on the east end, watched the body boarders and had a dip at **Kuhio Beach** there
* Dinner at **Lulu's Grill** (gluten free buns available, kalua pork burger)
* Walked basically the length of Waikiki exploring then popped out for beach **Fireworks**, this is... underwhelming. The show is <5 min long and the beach is *crowded*. If you can see it from where you're staying, sure.

Day 7 (East Finale/Transfer to Maui)

* Late afternoon flight let us revisit **Ho'omaluhia Botanical Garden** and get another **Island Snow Shave Ice** before heading to the airport

**MAUI:**

Day 7 (continued)

* Quick flight to Maui and rental car experience
* Drive to Kaanapali, check in
* Dinner at **Miss Arepa** (gluten free arepas and Venezuelan food, it's nice it's dedicated gluten free, but the food was good not great, super friendly staff)

Day 8 (Snorkel Cruise/Kaanapali)

* Early wakeup and mosey to Sheraton Black Rock for **Trilogy Snorkel Cruise** (5 hour cruise with breakfast and lunch, actual service with plates on the boat, and 2 snorkel spots with all equipment and help. Can't overstate how nice this was. **Snorkeled at Honolua Bay and Mokuleia Bay** saw so many fish, an octopus and **TURTLES**! On the sail back, relax and have a mai tai or 3.
* **Big Wave Shave Ice** at Westin Villas (thought this was solid, but finding it in the Villas is a pain, there is public free parking, go through lobby, make a right)
* Nap and pool time at the hotel
* Dinner at **Honu Oceanside** in Lahaina (free parking at the Lahaina Cannery Mall, not cheap but great meal, met the owner, had great discussions about the recovery of Lahaina, Ahi fish and chips, incredible butterscotch and macadamia dessert)

Day 9 (Central/South)

* Breakfast at hotel
* **Iao Valley State Park** (made parking reservation in advance, worth a small trip there, walkup and exploration of whole area took an hour)
* **Maui Ocean Center** (did the behind the scenes tour which was great, fed sharks, turtles, and even coral polyps. I had middling expectations but was pleased with overall time, could have spent more there for exhibits)
* Met up with some friends in Kihei and had dinner at **Three's Bar and Grill**, gluten free amazing jambalaya with kalua pork, shrimp, portuguese sausage, happy hour Mai Tai's.
* Relaxed at **Kalama Park** and also nearby Food Truck Park

Day 10 (Kaanapali Relax)

* Breakfast at the hotel, pool day with the family
* **Trilogy Sunset Cruise** (had such a great time on snorkel I booked a sunset cruise where you get dinner and drinks, 2 hours, was a great time with incredible service, have professional photographer for family sunset pics for purchase)
* Dinner at **Mala Ocean Tavern** (I will say this was a strikeout for me, I made a reservation in advance and asked for oceanfront and didn't get it when I showed up, no big deal, but the cocktail and food was ok, not great for the price. They did have lots of gluten free options)

Day 11 (Upcountry without Haleakala)

* The adults had been to the summit of Haleakala and decided with the kid joining, the drive up was too much, so we decided on other upcountry exploration.
* Stops in Kula at **Kula Bistro**
* Drove and kept going, through the **Keokea** area all the way to the **Ulupalakua Scenic Overlook** and then why not all the way to **Manawainui Gulch**. The roads are paved and very good condition, but yes its remote. I enjoyed the lava rocks visible at the end. Stopped before the unofficial start of Road to Hana backside where the road gets tougher.
* Drove back and stopped in **Makawao** to stroll the old town
* Quick shave ice stop in **Paia** and walk around

Day 12 (Home)

* Fly Home!
* Already planning our return trip to Kauai and BI

**General Notes** (if you're still reading, I appreciate the time):

1. **Gluten free** is easier on Oahu than Maui due to number of options, but locals and tourists use the *Find Me Gluten Free* app more than any other resource, so can use that. Most sit-down places have a grilled fish dish you can ask about. Some other specific highlights I've listed on here.
2. **The people in Lahaina** were genuinely thankful and explicitly said it was great we were visiting because tourism hasn't returned to pre-fire levels. They are done cleaning out debris and are starting to rebuild, which is great. Seeing all the empty lots if saddening of course, but the people and existing food/business etc. is great.
3. **Oahu Highlights**: Ho'omaluhia Botanical Garden, Driving from East to North Shore, Kualoa Ranch Tour, Walking around Haleiwa, Waimea Valley strolling, Toa Luau, Island Snow Shave Ice

1g5lj45,https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/comments/1g5lj45/kendu_an_insiders_view/,"Kendu, an insiders view","**About me**

I'm nothing special. Trading crypto for two years now. Started out carefully with just top 15 assets with the idea of building some gains higher than my bankaccount would provide for me. A year ago I started dabbling into low marketcap memecoins. Made some mistakes to learn, made some good trades. Basically managed to double my initial investment. Nothing special in meme land, but I'm a smart guy and I learn fast.



**About you**

Several reasons why you could be here reading. I'm going to assume you've heard about Kendu because it's pretty much impossible to not have.

1. You're a confident holder and you are here to read and share alpha. Welcome, I hope I don't dissappoint!
2. You're a holder and you are in doubt. You want to know more and have questions. Welcome! I hope my post will support you in some way. Please feel free to ask, me or anyone else in the KenduArmy will happily answer your questions. But even better: join the TG or one of the many X developer spaces with Miazaki and ask him your questions.
3. You're not into Kendu but sincerely want to know more because it's sparking an interest. Please read on. I hope I can help you make a decision on joining or not.
4. You'don't like Kendu and are just here to spread FUD. I'm not writing this for you. I know Reddit well enough to know that some just don't want information but just want to hate. You probably didn't even read a word of this post. Goodbye, have a nice life!



**Hype vs managing expectations**

People that know me from the TG know that I'm a realistic guy. I prefer real alpha over rumours. My believe is that it's better to surprise people with news that's actually better than the rumours, in stead of creating hype that in the end turns out to be a disappointment. But that makes bullposting about a memecoin hard. Many things happen behind the scenes and there will always be speculation. I try to manage expectations, but also realise many things start their own life. There is lots of alpha in Kendu and much is speculation. I'm trying to stick to the facts as much as possible.



**About Kendu**

Kendu had an all time high of 280MC and is about 7 months old. It's now sitting between 40 and 50 MC. That seems far off the ATH and consolidation is really taking longer than most expected. When I joined Kendu right before ATH Miazaki was talking about 1B MC in July and 10B MC before the end of the year. It's clear the first didn't happen and the second will need some sort of miracle. However, I've been realistic since the start and that helps with not losing faith. I've been buying Kendu all the way down to the lowest point of 35MC a few weeks back and am still buying. Why? Because I have rock solid faith that Kendu willl make me lifechanging money. We will go to 10B and far beyond. 



**From the outside looking in**

Over 90% of crypto traders are chartgazers. And that's fine. In most cases a chart will tell you everything you need to know about an asset, if you look at the right things. Even though I don't believe in TA for small MC coins, it is clear to see when a coin is over or when it is on the rise. Looking at Kendu all time high and the current price action I can understand people feeling negative when they are unknowing of what's actually going on. Especially with all the pump&dump shit going around. I will explain below why with Kendu things are really different. 



**Alpha**

* Marketcap: Kendu has been sitting at a 40-55 million marketcap for some time now. Thats roughly a 75% decline from all time high. However, that all time high was incredibly premature and mostly caused by catalysts. The number of holders at that time really didn't fall in line with the huge rally. It is much better in line now and basically you should look at Kendu as a new asset in DeFi. And looking at it in that way, we are outperforming almost every coin of the same age in numbers of holders, social media output and marketcap. The ones that reached higher in MC are funded by the market (Binance, are you reading?), not holders. Kendu is performing amazing. Just forget about that 280mc surge, begin your journey here. 

* Shiba connection: One of the catalysts that caused our ATH is the connection we had with Shiba. That connection has mostly faded because a large part of the Shiba team sold their souls to the Cabal. It is what it is. However, our dev Miazaki is friends with Shytoshi and is often quoting Ryoshi and using Ryoshi PfP in his X messages. It makes many in the TG wonder if Miazaki is actually Ryoshi or in closer contact to him than anyone suspects. Especially because Miazaki once said he could pump Kendu to 1B with just two clicks on X.... But, this is typically what I was referring to earlier. Managing expectations vs creating hype. We don't know the truth (yet) but it doesn't matter. In Kendu everyone working for the brand is equally important. 

* IRL assets (Decentralised Brand): we're in the DeFi space. But Kendu is more than that. We are not just looking at recycling DeFi money. We are not looking at bringing normies into DeFi. We are bringing the Kendu brand, in a decentralised way, to the people. The Kendu energydrinks are on sale online and finding there way to stores and universities (USA and Australia, for noe). Kendu Coffee will soon be released and brought under the attention of several coffeeshops and moviestudios in Hollywood. A community member is working on Kendu jewelry and someone will soon release a line of Kendu food supplements. There is Kendu Nights club events in India. All this to make Kendu a household name. Everyone in the community can release what they want under the Kendu name and is immediately sure he has thousands of potential customers and a huge KenduArmy working for promotion.

* Community: And that's the real strenght of Kendu. It's a marketing machine. It's a family. It's a cult. We're here for the long run and we are not going away until Kendu is a top 5 crypto with a 100B marketcap. There is no competition. I've been in many coins Telegram groups and all these CTO's, community driven cults and 'next whatevers' are literally in a different game. Name one and it's not even close community wise. They are botted, driven by payd KOL or influencers that dump as soon as it reaches a few million or become CTO after being rugged by the dev. Kendu is the only one thats worth looking at. The community is strong, real and unhinged to a level never seen before in crypto.

* Coinbase connection: Another hype thing, but one that cannot be denied. When advertising there new wallet, Coinbase used several names of huge cryptocurrencies. But up front and center was the name of Kendu. At that time a sub 100m memecoin, joined by all the great MC coins. Now, it could be just an intern with a Kendu bag seeing opportunity. But do you really believe that? Some think the Coinbase contract is already signed and just waiting for the right moment. I don't know if that's true. But there is definitely a link between Coinbase and Miazaki. Coinbase is probably the CEX with the best reputation out there, it doesn't have the foul stench Binance is acquiring at the moment. Real knows real.

**So.....**

I hope I gave you some insights into why I'm bullish on Kendu, despite (or thanks to) the current priceaction. And there is a lot more I'm forgetting to mention or leaving out because the article is getting to long. In short: Kendu is not your typical memecoin, it's a decentralised brand with more potential than anyone can see from the outside. That's why I want to invite everyone to visit our Telegram and to listen to our dev spaces. You really need to experience it to understand. 

  
Kind regards and see you soon!

A little time ago I started to see some weird stuff between him and a female coworker. After many weird things he has been doing I decided to ask him if what is going on and of course he said nothing, he got very defensive and offended, he also said that in a relationship you must hide some stuff and don’t be completely honest. Which was my confirmation that I am right. I have to mention that I have seen enough things that don’t put him in the position of a loyal man. 

One of the things I have noticed among others was the car chair. The day before I was the last person that stood in the passenger seat and the next day he got to work and right after work he waited me to go for a coffee together and the chair was pulled back, very much and and leaned quite a lot back.. he said nobody got into the car that day. But if I was the last person who sat on the chair why was it completely changed. I also found out that he was going out during the working hours, with his work buddies and probably those women out, he put 15 kilos because of that .. the kilos are a good karma plus he is loosing a lot of hair, so much that he is thinking about hair implant, but he doesn’t has money to pay it. I realised all this relationship was a lie, the only thing he did was to lie and do his life while pretending he is in love, because friends and family sees him like the perfect boyfriend.

Anyway, after a lot of thinking I took the decision to leave him. I talked to a therapist, she said she thinks he is not cheating, but my gut is telling me otherwise. I have chronic anxiety and panic attacks and two years ago I started to suffer by gut inflammation, which is very painful.

I haven’t told him that I am preparing my leave. Why I am still with him? because I want to move to another country and it is not that easy to leave right away. It is very hard for me to pretend that nothing is going on, I am completely disgusted by him, I know every word  from him is another lie.. it is hard, but I try to think about the time when I will leave. It will be in a few months. 

I can tell he is sensing something, because after so many years he asked me to marry and I keep giving stupid reasons to pospone it. I know he must have some dark motive behind it.

Anyway now the only think I dream with is of the moment when I will break free and change my life. My therapist say to go out and start dating in the mean time, not serious but for fun, I also think would make me good, but I don’t want to risk to be catch and then he will look like the good guy and I am not in the mood.

I'll be on maternity leave until she turns 11 months. My husband runs a family business, so there's constant after-hours admin work done at home, but his actual shifts at the workplace are either 9 am to 4 pm or 11 am to 6 pm, up to 6 days a week. Having a family business is a very intense lifestyle: he manages his siblings as employees despite being the youngest, which can cause tension. He relies on his parents for some work, which is a juggling act as they are also our only babysitters. He and I are together building a new sales channel that I'll run - if it's successful, I'll do it full time. If not, I go back to my corporate career. 

Between my leave, and his stress and weird hours, I do 80% of the childcare, 90% of the housework, and 100% of the cooking. I'm also trying to improve my mental health: I have ptsd after a 2.5 liter postpartum hemmorage. I acknowledge that we're all doing our best, but I kind of feel he's leaving me high and dry in the mornings.

He stays up late gaming, which I feel pressured to support since he says it's ""the only thing that's just for him."" Then he scrolls his phone in bed. It takes another hour for him to fall asleep after that. He wakes up an hour before work. He spends 20 minutes browsing his phone, then takes a shower, does his morning routine, and heads out. I wake up with the baby at 7.30, nurse, change her, eat my breakfast while she plays, feed the dog, feed baby breakfast, clean up, another diaper change, then nap time at 10. If the baby has had a rough night, I try to delay our wakeup, but it's not always possible.  He does not help in the morning, and some days he doesn't even see the baby until he gets home from work. 

I don't want to be one more person demanding something from him, and technically I dont need the help since we have a very easy baby. It feels shitty to say, ""I need the best version of yourself so you can give me even more, not because I need more, but because I want it."" Because I am lucky: many times, i get time in the morning to read a book or have a second cup of coffee while the baby plays. 

Maybe the worst part is his attitude. To hear him say it, he needs to lie in bed until 10 am, chilling and reading Reddit, because he's so exhausted from his ""chronic sleep deprivation."" He's also quick to point out that since I get a long maternity leave, the baby IS my job. As for the housework - since he'd be happy to only clean once a week, everything past that is my own choice, so therefore it's not his fault if I get stressed or burnt out from it. Today when I snapped that he's not the only tired one around here, he asked me to sincerely think about if there's anything in the world that could actually make me happy, since my extremely easy and privileged life somehow isn't enough. 

I feel so shitty for being jealous of his mornings. He's jealous of my life, he tells me all the time. I hate the idea that I see someone else have something good, and I try to take it away just for the sake of it. Plus he says he's not enjoying his mornings, but suffering from them since his late sleeping is a result of exhaustion. But man, is it irritating to be in ""Mom mode"" from the second I'm jolted awake by crying in the morning, while my partner has so much flexibility. ",2,1729150281.0,breakingmom,3,1.0,False
1g5lero,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1g5lero/thats_probably_enough_calories_for_two_days/,that’s probably enough calories for two days.,"So a little background: About 4 years ago I had my first boyfriend, and because I was a young and dumb teenager, I didn’t want to lose him under any circumstances. One of these circumstances happened to be his “best girl friend” repeatedly sending him nudes, him not telling her no because he “didn’t want to make it weird”, and me pretending to be fine with it. I was a dumbass, and of course I just didn’t want to believe he was cheating on me. The relationship ended up lasting over a year and a half and we broke up on his terms. Only after I was out did I realize how miserable I was.



Fast forward to today, and I’m completely over the situation. I have a great boyfriend, getting good grades during my first year of college, and I work at a very popular coffee chain that rhymes with FarDucks on campus.



I’m making drinks at the bar when I see her walk in. I smile, and by her smile back I can tell that she has no memory of me at all. It’s the girl who my ex cheated on me with. She orders a caramel Frappuccino. No biggie. Part of me didn’t want to make her drink, but the other part of me realized I could get a small amount of that sweet cold revenge with this situation.



For blended ice drinks, we have a base syrup that we add that makes it so the ice doesn’t separate from the drink. It’s thick, basically all sugar, and decides the consistency of the drink. So what did I do? I added 2 extra pumps of the base to her drink, while doing one less of the caramel syrup. Nothing that would get me in trouble, I could just say I forgot for a second, but her frappe might taste just a little bit off and too watery.



The rush of adrenaline kept me going for the rest of the night.

When she asks why I moved her stuff I just tell her I washed the counters again and forgot to put it back. I'm always dropping hints like that, but she's either oblivious or doesn't care! 

Anyone have advice? Suck it up? She's getting married in a year and is moving out, but idk. It's also hard to ""just talk to her"" because she makes it superrrr awkward every conflict and I also don't wanna sound rude at all, I like her as a person for the most part and want to maintain a good friendship.

She called it a Twelfth Night cake but when I've looked up Twelfth Night cakes on the internet - what I'm finding in no way resembles what I ate as a child.  This is a description of what I remember:

* it was a large, dense fruit cake
* baked in a large bundt / ring pan 
* if you looked at it from the outside, it looked a lot like a panettone or kouglof glacé in terms of colour and size but there was nothing bread-like about it
* it had dried fruit in it and I remember it had glacé cherries
* it was unfrosted and simply dusted with icing sugar
* it wasn't a moist cake but dry/dense and almost like a soft biscuit (soft crumbly cookie) in its texture. It sounds weird but it was delicious and it wasn't dry in the sense that you needed to spread butter on it etc - it was delicious to eat on its own. I am struggling to find another cake that is similar. Perhaps what the Americans call a Coffee Cake but denser in terms of crumb. 
* colour was a pale creamy colour
* it was quite sweet
* weight-wise it was a heavy-cake and dense but as mentioned, not moist but quite dry. 

Any thoughts? Thanks in advance

I've had a long history with migraines, but lately they suddenly got much much worse and I would love to hear from others what my options are.

When I was 13 I got a concussion that basically never ended and resulted in chronic headaches and migraines. My whole school career I could only go to school for max 3 hours per day and I went through a lot to accept my situation for what it was. I was sick all the time, I went to 3 different hospitals over the course of 6 years, tried different medications, painkillers (and stopped taking them all together at certain points too), physiotherapists, psychotherapists, sports, ostheopathie, needles, antidepressivs, triptans, etc. Nothing helped until it suddenly slowly just.... got better? This was when I was 19 and finished highschool. I still got migraines, usually when I had my period, sometimes for a day and sometimes they would last for up to a week, but with taking Rizatriptan or sitting it out, it was doable. In the last year, I suddenly started to get very blurry vision suddenly, I got my eyes checked, multiple blood tests, but everything seemed fine, until about 2 months ago where the blurry vision would be followed by migraines. Suddenly I have migraines basically every day, together with my vision getting extremely blurry, nausea and oversitivity to light/noises/smells. I went to a neurologist and we will do a MRI scan next month and they talked about trying antidepressivs, but I honestly feel really demotivated to take them, as I tried them in the past and I felt really horrible while taking them. Would you guys give me advice on things to try out besides trying medication? 

What Im trying now:
- I try to swim twice a week (when Im not completely messed up from the headaches)
- I try to do stretches for my neck/shoulders/back every day
- I try to drink enough water
- I used to drink 3 cups of coffee a day and I only drink one now (I also get a headache if I dont drink coffee at all)
- I realise that just 2 sips of wine make me feel horrible so I stopped drinking completely


Im sorry if this is very long, but I would really appreciate any tips of things that I can try, I feel like my neurologist only wants to try medication (which Im willing to try but... Im just a bit afraid of it). Im only 22 years old and I live alone in a different country then my family. Im a musician and things are going really well for my career, but I really need to find a solution because I tried playing gigs with migraines and it's really really challenging. Should I try the medication first? Should I try botox/acapuncture/different diets first? Should I wait a few more months to see if it gets better?

Thank you for whoever can help me <3.",0,1729149761.0,migraine,0,0.5,False

1g5l910,https://i.redd.it/duy8m1ldp9vd1.jpeg,Siemens TE712 maintenance,"Hi I just wanted to share some thought on the TE712 I bought second hand and my experience with it these past few days. 

When I first tried the coffee machine I noticed that the grinder was very loud and and didn't grind especially fine powder even on the lowest setting. I also noticed that to rotary encoder jumped around like crazy in the menu so choosing a beverage or editing settings took forever. 

I opened up the machine which was fairly easy except one of the sides that took me 20 minutes to get off, maybe I'm dumb, I don't know. But eventually I came loose. The top was really hard to get off but like all the other sides it eventually came off using more force than I thought would be needed.

The Grinder:
I disassembled the grinder to find that the ball bearing had seized totally and was impossible to move by hand. I filled a glass with white vinegar and soda and then I placed the glass in my Ultrasonic Cleaner. After 45 minutes all the rust was gone and I could clean out the debris with 5-56 and the grease it with ptfe grease and put the sealings on again. Worked like a charm. The color of the bearing was quite gray from the chemicals but who cares, I'm not going to look at it. 
The I cleaner the entire grinder part by part and the greased the part needed to be greased and put it all together. 

The Rotary Encoder:
The encoder was placed behind the circuit board on the front and it was necessary to remove the top to get to it. I spray contact spray on it several time and exercised it back and forth. The encoder got a lite stiff when turning it but doesn't bother me too much. 

The result:
The machine doest scream like it did before and I can use it knowing that the grinder won't sieze on me and die. Hopefully the little love I applied to it can give me a few years of service. The rotary encoder works really well now. The only thing is that it's a little stiff to turn, I've heard about greasing it but I didn't really know how to and it was late past midnight and my better half didn't want the kitchen full of tools in the morning. If anyone has tips on the encoder I'll gladly accept them.

M, college student.

Ever since I started my life as college student. Sobrang hirap na ng naranasan ko. Nag bh ako, minsan walang food walang baon pero tiniis ko kasi wala nga daw pera. I am now in my 3rd year sa college pero simula 1st year never ako binilhan ng school supply, palaging late pag bigay ng baon ko and all that. Pero nung nag college na yung brother ko. Lahat ng pananaw ko nabago. Yung bh nya, airconditioned. Libre lunch nya sa school nya pero same padin baon namin everyday which is 100  eh walking distance lang yung bh nya sa school nya kaya no need na magpamasahe pero ako ang bh ko anlayo, I need to sakay a tricycle and multicab para makapunta ng school which is 60 pesos back and fort. Minsan naman nilalakad ko nalang para isang sakay nalang pauwi ang maka save at least 15 pesos. Pag nahinge naman ako ng allowance, pahirapan pa kasi kesyo wala daw pera, pag sahod nalang daw, o kaya pag wala na ako pasok saka mag bibigay ng baon then kulang na kasi sasabihin wala naman ako pasok. Yung kapatid ko naman isang hinge lang, sasabihin nila ""sige later send ako"". Ang phone ko pinaglumaan lang ni mama, nag go ghost touch na kadalasan kaya pang call nalang sya. Sabi ko kay mama bilhan man ako phone since need ko naman ng bago kasi for school purposes and such. Wala daw pera ganto ganyan.

One time, nadulas si ate ""Ma, saan mo binalot yung phone?"" (kasi pinadalhan nila gamit yung kapatid ko) and I was like...""wow sanaol binilhan phone"" I felt sad knowing na nung naghihingi ako, ang sabi wala pero yun pala kaya wala kasi inuna yung kapatid ko. Then I asked kung anong klaseng phone and sabi naman android daw, yung mura lang kasi yun manlang ang afford. So sige, baka need man talaga nung kapatid ko ng phone since sira yung front cam ng phone nya pero okay naman sya compare sa phone ko. Tapos yung bunso namin na 10 years old kinausap ako, tinanong ako if nagseselos daw ba ako sa kapatid namin, well syempre kasi okay man phone n ya tas binilhan pa pwede naman paayos. Tapos sabi ng kapatid ko, ""Iphone pala kuya yung binili"" tapos di naman ako naniwala kasi baka ginogoodtime lang ako. 

Then kahapon, yung ex ng kapatid ko inaya ako mag coffee. Libre nya daw ako pero I'm busy tapos sabi nya ""Naka Iphone na pala si ano"" sabay send ng pic ng myday (di ko kasi friend sa fb) tapos yun dun ko nalaman na ganong phone pala ang binili. Pricey yun diba? 11 or 12 ata yun but still. I felt so left behind ng fam ko kasi everytime na nag aask ako ng help palagi madami dahilan pero sa kapatid ko ambilis nila tulungan. Iyak ako nang iyak knowing na andami nila dinedeny saakin tapos nag sekreto pa sila saakin about that phone. 

I don't know if pagpapatuloy ko pa ba pag aaral ko or what kasi ang hirap na. Kulang support ng fam, hirap naman makahanap ng part time job and full load pa sched. At the same time ayoko naman mag stop since malapit na ako eh, kunti nalang na tiis matatapos na pero diko na alam. 

Ano ba kailngan kong gawin?   ",3,1729149379.0,adviceph,1,1.0,False

Last week I tasted a coffee in a cafe with the label ""natural extended fermentation"", the barista explained that this was an anaerobic process.
The espresso was delicious, mild, and fruity and I decided to buy a bag of those beans.
At home I dialed in the espresso as I normally would but noticed that the taste was more boozy and a bit harsher than in the cafe.
This is becoming a trend when I make espresso from anaerobically processed beans at home; it is not as mild and fruity as in the cafe.
I think (but I'm not sure) that the special notes from anaerobic processed coffee come from the formation of alcohol during the fermentation. They might extract very well, resulting in an unbalanced cup.

So my question is:
What is your experience in this?

Should I frind giner and dose slightly less to balance the booze to add more body?

Is my cup overextracted and should I grind coarser?

Should I increase or decrease the water:coffee ratio?

I know my setup is not the endgame but I can't upgrade at the moment. In general I really enjoy my shots though.

To give some context, my endocrinologist had initially told me my earliest appointment was May 29th, 2025. When I heard that, I thought, ""Ugh, that’s such a long wait, but fine, I’ll take it."" I was definitely disappointed, though. Then, out of nowhere, I get a call on Tuesday saying, ""Hey, we had a cancellation—can you come in tomorrow at 10 a.m.?"" I almost spit out my coffee in shock and immediately replied, ""YES! I’ll be there!""

That whole day was spent scrambling to sell some of my Magic cards just to afford everything, but it was totally worth it 😂.

The next day, I went in for my appointment. They did all the necessary checks, and the results surprised them a bit. No issues with drug reactions, no addictions, and besides dyslexia and ADD, my mental health was clear. My weight, height, and overall health were good, and I was fully prepared to handle the costs myself. I’d already gotten the green light from my psychologist, and they were on board with me starting as soon as possible. Now, I'm just waiting on my blood test results to get things moving!

As for yesterday... let's just say I’m feeling a little woozy, but it’s all part of the process. 💕

So, I was curious—how did everyone else start their journey?

I think it's going to make for quite the story one day, starting with, ""I sold my Magic cards to pay for hormone therapy.""",3,1729149075.0,MtF,4,1.0,False

I finally have time to give you guys the part three of me being pushed around. Before I can Continue, I would like to clarify some things that my poor grammar made it seem one thing but it's not that thing. First, My father is not dead, in fact he's the one who helped me get into college and he's still very much alive and well. Sorry that I made it seem that way, my father has help me with a lot of bullshit and he's the type to give up his shirt off his back if you needed a shirt. One of many reasons my mother married him she says. Second, Artlad really was dense and the title is just me giving a little riddle/a brain twister/inside joke of someone going though crap. I'm glad reddx has read my story and he's figured SOME things out while others I guess it does seem Artlad may also have a thing for Queenie but nope that's not the case. (also thanks for the game recommendations, I'll check those out)  

**Time for club row-call:**

**Dizzy:** That's me, 19 at the time, having somewhat cold-feet about the club. Introvert and really just wants to be home and play video games. Closeted trans-guy but the shell is cracking (I did kind of/ sort of off handily mentioned I was studying graphic design but it's not important to the story. But just keep in mind both art and graphic design classes share the same building) 

**Artlad:** 19, friend of high school, art student, extrovert that's very outdoorsy but tends to have chronic ""foot-in-mouth syndrome"". 

**Queenie**: 20 year old, club president, loves food and whine. this club meeting is where she gives her all. But would like see Artlad, gives his all to her as well. 

**Sourface:** 21 year old, club member, he's here to show everyone that ""fat men needs to be heard and no one is going to stop him"" demeanor and a fat guy version of mean girls.  

**Ms. Mal-doll:** 20 years old, club vice-president, one Queenie's ""yes-men"" and named ""mal"" cuz she really didn't like me and ""doll"" for the fact she's really was shaped like one of those Russian dolls.

**Cherry:** 22 years old, the club's treasurer and the only one sane and I guess normal when comes to talking to people. named for the fact she always wears red lipstick and dresses like she's from the 50's. Her body type is of that a plus sized hourglass. 

**Bonbon:** 21 years old, club member, the other ""yes-man"" for Queenie and she's the same height and body type as her too. The reason ""Bonbon"" is given is she, without fail, has some kind of sugary drink/snack. 

**Bestbro:** 19 and Artlad's best friend, he doesn't go to the community college. Instead he's going to the university that's other side of town. Not in the club, but he is in the story. 

**Everybody is counted for, MEETING IS SESSION!**



It's Friday, and the whole week has been very busy. I've been just going to classes, study, and go back home and trying to relax. Queenie hasn't come by to talk to me to tell me about getting pamphlets to give to people but Artlad was more then willing to play messager-boy for her since we are in the same building. I think it would be a lot easier for all of us to share our phone numbers but Queenie doesn't come by and Artlad always says ""No, it's fine. She always stop by my classes either before or after the lesson and tells me what she needs from you"", no point of arguing with a brick-wall. In between of me studying 'til late at night for some projects and developing a coffee addiction, I say college life has been pretty easy at this point. I've also been texting some friends during my down time and one of them was Bestbro. Our conversions was years ago so this just a jest of what was said. 

**Bestbro: Hey dude! Are you alive? You haven't crossed to the other side from studying too hard right?**

**Me: Still breathing. Tho I wish I did crossed to the other side. Maybe I don't have to worry about student loans. Anyway, how's you and your girlfriend?**

**Bestbro: Awesome. Me and my girl are doing well. Actually I was wondering if you want to hang out with me and Artlad after that whole fatty club thing.** 

**Me: Only if is somewhere I can recharge mentally. Being with people just drains me and meeting new people takes a lot out of me.**

**Bestbro: It's that old coffee place near your guys' campus, Artlad wanted to check it out and he told me that he thinks its a good place take my girlfriend there if she wants. You in or out?**

**Me: A quiet place where you can drink coffee and read a nice book? Sounds good! I'm in.**

**Bestbro: Cool. I'm surprised you joined a club since, you know, you hate being outside of your room.** 

**Me: I don't hate being outside, It's just that outside doesn't have my video games.** 

**Bestbro: I thought you where going to be open-minded?**

**Me: About me going outside or me meeting people?** 

**Bestbro: both?**

**Me: Maybe.**

The club was at the other side of campus where they held all the lecture halls and I was starting to ""chicken out"" from going to the first meeting and officially become a club member but Artlad is right there waiting for me. 

**Artlad: Sup dizzy. Ready for the first meeting?**

**Me: Not really.** 

**Artlad: What? Why not? Isn't these the chance for you to make your dad proud? Just think, you coming home, saying to your dad ""hey I did something to try change society!"" Won't that be cool?**

**Me: I don't think me joining a club about body inclusively is me fighting for societal change. It's not like I'm doing anything in terms of getting people aware.**

**Artlad: It's baby steps. Gotta start somewhere.** 

From there I just follow along. We're talking about meeting up Bestbro at the coffee place and that's where we see people waiting outside of one of the lecture halls. I didn't know which one it was so I asked:

**Me: Hey Artlad, where's the actual meeting place? Is it the one where people are standing outside?**

**Artlad: Yeah, but Queenie should already have the key to the hall. And she came by to be to tell where it's at. She's not here?**

**Sourface: Well well, Looks like Queenie pussied out. I guess she couldn't handle being a leader.**

I turn around to see Sourface, with a smug smile just walking towards us. I'm so confused as to why he's smiling like that since I have no idea was kind of relationship he has with Queenie nor why he want's to join her club. 

**Sourface: Artlad, why are you here? A club like these isn't something skinny people should be joining. You don't what it's like to be a fat man.** 

**Artlad: I wanted to help out a friend. What's wrong with that?**

**Sourface: Pfft, yeah, now you want to hang out with Queenie. I mean it's not wrong to help out a pal but, you've been declining Queenie's offer to hang out all week! Not since what happened last week of summer semester.** 

**Artlad:** \*he looks away, his happy-go-lucky smile turns into a frown\*  **I ahh I don't want to talk about it.** 

Just before I could ask if he was ok that when I hear Cherry coming in.

**Cherry: Hi! I'm so sorry that I'm late! The president and vice-president are coming a little late as well but they say they have something for us! Let me get you guys inside and we can get started with sign-ups. OH! I'm Cherry by-the-way and I'm the club's treasurer. It's so nice to meet you all!** (I remember her being way too bubbly) 

It really was a small club, If we include Queenie, Cherry and Ms. Mal-doll, it might have been like 10 or 11 people in total. Most clubs have like 20 to 30 people at once, not including the sports clubs because they're not co-ed. As we entered, Cherry give us a quick run-down on what rules we have to follow and the goal of the club as well as what to see in the club. 

**Cherry: The one problem we have is we don't get funding from the office due our size of the club and we're considered more of a social club than a awareness club. So we might either do fundraising or pay-up-front events.** 

**Sourface: WHAT? PAY-UP-FRONT?! Why do I have to give hard earn money when other clubs get it for free! And I'm not doing fundraising.** 

**Artlad: I thought you live at home? I didn't know you have a job? Doesn't your mom or dad give ya money for stuff?**

**Sourface: DUDE WHAT THE HELL! I TOLD YOU NOT SAY CRAP ABOUT THAT!** 

Artlad slaps his mouth shut with both hands realizing what he did. Again foot-in-mouth syndrome. Artlad was not the kind of guy you tell your secrets to because he'll just say it without thinking and the worst part he'll say ""opps, I forgot haha. didn't mean to"" like it was funny. 

**Cherry: AHEM! Anyway, we need at about 15 people to get some funding. We still have time to get new people!** 

**Ms. Mal-doll: Yes, you don't need to shout. I can feel my ears bleeding.** 

Ms. Mal-doll and Queenie just come in the room with a lot of bags, and I mean A LOT of bags. Both Queenie and Ms. Mal-doll were holding like 4-5 bags each. Like as if they got something for a party. 

**Bonbon: Oh Queenie you're here! I've heard you got something for us! What did our president brought?**

**Ms. Mal-doll: You know how she is. She always has something in her sleeve and she really when above and beyond today.** 

**Cherry: Ummm Ms. President, you do know about the rules right? I hope its what I think it is right?**

**Queenie: Come on Cherry, there's nothing wrong about breaking the rules once in a while, plus it's part of our meeting!**

**Cherry: We only get two hours of club time. How's......having bags of something be part of H.A.E.S?**

**Ms. Mal-doll: Uhhh everything! Come Queenie, let's show them what we have!**

And with that, they dump everything from those bags, all I saw was just a big-ass pile of snacks. I saw snack-cakes, Oreos, cookies, chips, bags of candy, fruit snacks just so much for like a party of maybe 50 people just on top the teacher's desk. I know I can be a real fat-ass but even I know that's just over kill. I was just sitting there with mouth agape from seeing that mountain.

**Artlad: Damn Queenie! You brought enough for the rest of the semester! That's whole lot of food!**

**Queenie: Of course YOU think it's a lot, always starving yourself just to be skinny. Then again you are a guy, you just burn it off just from breathing!**

**Sourface: Not true! I don't eat much and I'm still overweight! I have a glandular problem and people don't believe me!**

**Cherry: If both of you are going to start fighting, Imma have to ask you to take it outside while the rest us who know how to use our inside voice, can actually talk about the club.** 

**Bonbon: Yeah Queenie, You're the President and you shouldn't take crap from anyone.**

**Ms. Mal-doll: Yeah Queenie, you know he's just trying to get on your nerves. WOMAN UP GIRL!**

**Queenie: You're right.** \*she relaxes a bit\* **Today's our first ever meeting and what are we going to do is introduce ourselves and tell the club why you wanted to join.** 

One by one everybody introduces themselves and give their reasons and comes Sourface. 

**Sourface: I'm Sourface, I'm 21 years old and I wanted to join because I wanted to tell a** ***REAL*** **story about fat oppression. A story that our club ""president"" could never understand. Not like she cares at all, and I'm best shoulder to cry on if you need to vent.** 

Queenie just rolls her eyes at this and says ""ok ok thank you, whos up next"" before pointing to Artlad.

**Queenie: How about you? Tell us about yourself and your reason.** 

**Artlad: sweet! I'm next.** \*he stands up and taking a deep breath\* **Hi I'm Artlad. I love meeting new people and I join these club to help out a good friend and maybe learn something about loving your body and stuff.** \*and he sits back down\*

**Queenie: That's it? That's all you have to say?**

**Artlad: Yup! Not much to say.**

**Ms. Mal-doll: Ok then, that just leaves you.** \*looking at me\* **Come on, tell us why you're here.** 

You know that feeling when you're trying to hide behind a book in order for the teacher not to call on you only for said teacher chooses you to read out-loud to the class. That's how I felt at that moment but I did this to myself and I've been very quite during the whole thing. 

**Artlad:** \*whispering\* **Come on dude, you got this!** 

**Me:** \*taking a deep breath and I stand up\* **H-hello everyone, I'm Dizzy and I joined this club with my friend Artlad and I hope I get to learn something from club and to find myself I guess. I hope I don't cause too much trouble since this was the first time hearing about HAES.** \*I just sit back down\*

**Ms. Mal-doll: Really? You've never heard of HAES? And you're a** ***girl*****, like some kind of pick-me?** 

**Queenie: That's why I founded this club, more people should know and it's working too since someone like Dizzy could go their whole life not knowing about social issues and not having a care of the world to join us.** 

Girl! I've seen people protesting in front of mayors' offices just to have better drinking water and opening up a food bank just for low-income households could have better lives. People calling me a fat-fuck is not a social issue. But my back-bone, 'tis too soft! A mere limp noodle that cannot defend against a verbal army of words. So I just look down. Now I know there's one thing that people should know. Assholes are gender-neutral, everybody has one and everybody knows one. 

**Queenie: Now everyone, the topic of this meeting is not only getting to know everybody but get to know your own bodies.** 

**Artlad:** \*trying not to laugh\* **I'm pretty sure if getting to know our bodies is what makes you go blind and grow hair on your palms.** 

**Me:** \*elbowing him and whispering\* **Dude that was a lame-ass joke.** 

**Ms. Mal-doll: UHHG gross, she wasn't talking about that!** 

**Bonbon: Ewww, how immature!**

**Queenie:** \*blushing and looking away\* **I-I-I don't mean in a sex-ed kind of way. I was taking about intuitive eating!**

**Cherry: OH! I've heard of intuitive eating! WAIT! Is that's why you brought snacks?** 

**Queenie: Yup! We need to listen to our bodies and make sure we are giving ourselves the love and attention that it deserves. Come on everyone, grab some snacks!**

 Everybody started grabbing their treats while Artlad and I just stay sitting down.

**Artlad: You're not getting some?**

**Me: Nah, I'm not the mood for snacking. Plus what I really want is a good cup of coffee.**

**Artlad: Oh yeah, Bestbro is meeting us at the back of the coffee place. I heard it's low profile vibe, nothing too fancy.** 

**Me: Thank god, I don't understand why places in college towns have this need to be extra.** 

**Ms. Mal-doll: Are you two not going to grab snacks?** 

**Artlad: No not really.** 

**Me: Thanks for offering, I know it's to teach us about listening to our bodies when we're hungry, however mine's saying that I'm not hungry.** 

**Bonbon: That's bullshit! You may be a small fat but that doesn't mean you have to starve yourself just to play nice with him** \*stares at Artlad as she says that\*

**Me: Uhhhh......small fat?** 

**Queenie: Yes, small fat. It when you're fat but still can find clothes at regular clothing stores. Next week we'll talk about different sizes of fat bodies and how to make your surroundings more fat friendly.** 

**Sourface: You hear that skinny boy? I hope you can keep up, I'm sure Queenie will take the extra time for you HAHAHA.** \*whispers to Artlad\* **Unless you have someone else mind, making Queenie be on her toes.** 

**Artlad:** \*whispers back\* **What the fuck do you mean ""if I have someone else in mind?"" The fuck gave you that idea?** 

Sourface looks at me with the most creepy and slimy grin I've ever seen. It's imprinted in my memory, the way he smiled it was like the Disney's cartoon version Cheshire Cat but showing off gums and he was sizing me down. All can think of is me wishing I was born with a more masculine body so he stop looking at me. I doubt he did it cuz he ""likes"" me, more so to see how Artlad would react. Sourface then move towards me, speaking in normal volume:

**Sourface: So uhhh Dizzy right? Artlad is your friend right? You don't mind tell me more about yourself right? And I want to say sorry about what you saw on Monday when you where helping Queenie during that club rush thing.** 

**Me: I-It's fine, I've known Artlad since freshmen year of high school. I don't really talk about myself all that much, I don't really do much extroverted activities, mostly reading and gaming.** 

**Sourface: OH you play video games! I play from time to time. If there's a game you'll to play, just let me know.** 

That's when he gets really close to me, like he's three inches way from me and I can feel his hot breath on my forehead. I'm just looking down, not wanting to make eye-contact anymore. I. Am. Frozen. This is the most fear I've ever felt and I've been in situations where people made me feel......off. 

**Artlad: Dude! What are you doing! can you see you're making Dizzy uncomfortable!**

**Me: C-Can you please give m-me some elbow room. You're kinda in my personal space.** 

**Sourface:** \*moves away from me and stands next to Artlad"" **What? I was just talking to my fellow club member or maybe YOU want to be in** ***her*** **personal space?** 

**Artlad: Uhhh no! Me and Dizzy are just friends, more like siblings really.** 

**Me: I think it's more like cousins twice removed.** 

**Artlad: Yeah exactly!** 

**Sourface:** \*looking confused and rising an eyebrow\* **Uh huh, so......nothing more?**

**Me and Artlad: YES! NOTHING MORE!**

**Queenie: Sourface, stop being mean to Artlad. He was just sitting there! Dizzy, you shouldn't just sit there and not have a snack. Live once in a while! Or maybe you're just too brainwashed from fatphobia bad speak to be woman enough to get a man with your personality.** 

Again with the back-handedness. Also my personality doesn't land me with on-going turf war with a guy who's a male version of me. But my spine is not shining though and like good little bitch, all I've said: 

**Me: I'm just not hungry, also I've never wanted a guy at all. It never crossed my mind.** 

**Cherry: Yeah girl, who needs relationships when you can be happy with numbero uno! Self-love is important you know!** 

**Sourface: pfft! Whatever.** \*lowers down to Artlad's eye level and says in a low voice\* **I don't know what's your deal, but I know you're up to something. Something that makes Queenie second guess herself and not letting me be part of it. I don't know what you did in the last semester but what I DO know Queenie's thirsting for something both of you once had.** 

Artlad just sit there, stone cold and Sourface just walked away. While I'm just here as confused as Bugs Bunny after taking a wrong turn in Albuquerque. How much damage CAN you in one month and two weeks? It was low but I was just close enough to hear what they were talking about and it seems Artlad did something but Artlad wouldn't hurt someone like that. Right?

**Me: Uh Artlad, are yo-**

**Artlad: I don't want to talk about it.** 

**Me: Sorry, just worried man. I've never seen you this serious. It's really out of character for you.** 

**Queenie: Sooooo Artlad, are doing something after this? There's this really cool garden near this campus and I know you like nature and shit and I was wondering if you and I can go for a walk there?**

**Artlad: Oh ahhh Yeah, I AM doing something after this, me and my buddy, Bestbro, are meeting up at this coffee shop that everybody has been talking about and I wanna check it out.** 

**Queenie:** \*trying not to look annoyed"" **Oh, of course. Why am I not surprised, well at lease have rain check on the garden thing. I swear it's nice.** 

**Artlad: Yeah! totally! I'll ask Bestbro if he's up for it as well when me and Dizzy meet up with-**

cue the sound of heartbreak. 

**Queenie: WAIT! You're taking** ***her?*** **Aren't you two just friends? Why you taking Dizzy?**

**Me: Oh I haven't seen Bestbro in a long time. It's just friends meeting up with a friend.** 

Can guys be friends with someone who's a woman? Well a woman who's a closeted trans-guy who's not ready to come out. 

**Queenie: Oh! Maybe I can part-take? It's Just like you said, ""just friends meeting up with a friend"" right?**

**Artlad: Sorry Queenie, It just old high school friends meeting up. It's a little catch-up thing since leaving high school. You not like sad or mad about it right?**

**Queenie: Oh totally not, I like being left hanging when it comes to not getting an RSVP on plans I've made. It's no biggie.** 

**Artlad: Awesome I knew you would understand. You a good friend Queenie.** 

Artlad really does put the 'upid in stupid. The rest of the club meeting when smoothly and that's when Artlad and I headed out to meet up with Bestbro.

**Bestbro: Dude! how's it going! College hasn't been kicking your asses to next Tuesday?**

**Artlad: Haha no! It's art classes, I'm not studying anything that needs me to use math.** 

**Bestbro: Haha yeah, you're one of those 2 + 2 = 5 type of dumbass**. 

Artlad and Bestbro play fight for a second and Artlad puts him in a choke hold to give them a nuggie and he lets go.

**Bestbro: What about you Dizzy? College hasn't melted your brain yet?** 

**Me: No, It's just graphic design. I'm literally learning about how to make a pamphlets and posters look nice. Not everybody is meant to be a doctor you know.** 

**Bestbro: I'm studying history!**

**Me: Point proven.** 

After a swat on the head with a menu flyer and some laughs, we order our drinks and find a place to sit, we talked about what we've been up to, what I did in the summer, how's Bestbro's girlfriend been doing, you know normal stuff. In my journal I wrote down, ""I'm still hit or miss when it comes to the club but at less today I've talked to friends about life and stuff, I just hope I can be more honest with myself."" After some time It was time for Bestbro to head home.

**Artlad: See ya Monday Dizzy! Don't let that homework kill ya.** 

**Me: Not if I get to me first!** 

**Bestbro: Hey Dizzy, need a ride home? I can give you one.**

**Me: thanks but I don't have money for gas so maybe next time?**

**Bestbro: Actually, I wanted to talk to you alone. You mind?**

**Me: Is something going on with you and your girlfriend? Is this one those ""need a friend who's a girl so I can better understand my girlfriend"" cuz if it is, it start by putting the sit down. It's always putting the sit down.** 

**Bestbro: No dumbass, it's not about me or my girl. It's about Artlad.** 

**Me: What about him?**

**Bestbro: It's best if we head to my car, I tend to think clearly I'm driving.** 

I get in his car. and we start heading towards my home.

**Me: So what's on your mind about Artlad?** 

**Bestbro: I've known Artlad since we were kids, I know when something is not right. Something is bothering him and he's not opening up about. Have you notice something off?**

**Me: Only when the people he meet in art class are around. They keep reminding him of the time he did something during he's time taking summer classes. But I have no idea what it is.** 

**Bestbro: Artlad has a bad habit of not thinking before he acts. Sometimes I wonder if he cares or knows what he does affects people.** 

**Me: Dude this is the same person when in the 10th grade a girl was so obvious that she wanted his dick, and he was all like ""Bro is it me, or that girl is trying tell something but I don't know what tho"" while said girl is sitting in the corner giving that hand gesture.** 

**Bestbro: Then he finally picks up the hint and goes out her only for them to break up right-a-way.** 

**Me: I don't think he even has the chance to sleep with them half the time.** 

**Bestbro: My point I'm trying to make is that he just brushes it off saying ""there's always a better time next time"" now he's all like ""I don't wanna talk about it"".** 

**Me: I don't know man, I wasn't there when it happened. I started this week at that college.** 

**Bestbro: What really? Huh, I guess he....nevermind, just tell me when something is really wrong. He's like my brother and I don't want him be hurt or the one that hurt someone.**

**Me: Yeah for sure. He's the only one I know on campus anyway, so don't worry.** 

**Bestbro: Thanks Dizzy.** 

So he drops me off in front of my house and wave him goodbye and I had this aching feeling that Artlad has something he doesn't want people to know. Just like Reddx, I thought he might have a thing for Queenie and maybe Sourface might also but oh boy I was proven wrong.

I regretted not asking for it without coffee but maybe the coffee helped me focus on reading cuz I got a lot of reading done! Tasted hella worse.

I felt kinship to her struggles and her desire to feel high. But honestly also to the way she found herself in bad situations. I seem to too. I also found a book on how to deal with a loved one with BPD and reading those short excerpts about the person with BPD, it’s like I can read their little BPD minds. I know everything going on in their head. The fear of abandonment. The hypersensitivity. Reading into everything. It just sucks. I forget that I have this thing. To me it seems everyone isn’t feeling enough. But reading it from the authors perspective the BPD person just seemed really sensitive and panicked. Just like me. They mentioned it’s really hard for someone with BPD to hold a job for obvious reasons. And idk THAT sucked. Like wtf do I do? I don’t wanna be homeless but also my emotional sensitivity is just impossibly incompatible with everything out there. But I’m learning. Learning about myself. My boundaries. Maybe I’ll only work a part time for the rest of my life if I can even do that. 

But yeah I’m dressed in all black and I feel good in my black boots. Feels like me. I go to the library and get some reading done. I overthink. I’m always scanning for love but like why?? I gave up! But anyways I realized coming back home, I like being out for as long as I can until I’m tired and need my bed and blanket. I really want more things to do but I’m so broke. I don’t want to fucking learn how to play my guitar at home haha. Why is everything that costs money just funner lol. And I don’t wanna go on fucking hikes. It’s sorta boring to do alone and idk it’s just not fun. 

This post is so useless but it’s fun to look back on. I think I had a better than terrible day today. I mean my days are always mixed, so it’s complicated. But today my mom was going to sleep and idk I loved her. Usually I hate her but today I didn’t hate her. Maybe it’s cuz we didn’t speak much today haha

New member here and wanted to share my experience with Caffeeine. Is it just me or is there anyone else who has had bad withdrawal symptoms from caffeine? mine is so bad that I had a terrible headache (sinus headache was amplified and went on into the morning). I also am sore from the waist down and when I lie down, my legs hurt. The doctor said for at least no month no caffeine, amongst other triggers, and today, I had a small cup of green tea, and I will see how I feel later on. 

It is not all bad news though. 

I have learned that there is a way to alkaline your tea or coffee to make it less of an issue on your stomach.

So for example with the green tea, I added a pinch of baking soda, which alkalinizes the water, and so far I am having no rumbles in my stomach or GI issues. I did also eat a banana with the tea to lessen any potential impacts.

Also, as it relates to coffee, same thing. I like my coffee black unless I am making an espresso. What I may do is experiment with also adding either a non-dairy-based milk or also adding a pinch of baking soda to a black cup of coffee to make it more alkaline.

  
Hopefully these ""hacks"" may help anyone out there.

We met at a library where we both spend all our days studying and became quite close over the last 3 months. We started travelling and having most meals together and we always have a gala time hanging out. We share the same sense of humour so the breaks that we take together help us destress from the stresses of our work. She’s appearing for a competitive exam and I am enrolled in a very costly design program that demands minimum 10 hours of work everyday. I take on the role of the elder sister in the relationship and let her be a little carefree as I found that to be harmless initially. However I started noticing patterns of selfishness and how the friendship was slowly turning to be one sided. I would help her organise her daily time tables for study and help her calm down whenever she got overwhelmed and encouraged her to study more. She was also incredibly nice to me most of the time, bringing ice cream for me during pms and driving me home. But her emotional immaturity is slowly getting on my nerves. She has anger issues (got into a road rage), is into a ldr but questions her attraction towards her boyfriend every time she starts talking to a new guy, becomes extra bubbly and enthusiastic towards guys, and frequently cuts my sentences in both personal conversations and conversations with other people. She spent 5 days making a bday gift for her boyfriend and subsequently went on a movie with another guy friend spending half a day there. There’s a dance festival that happens only once a year here in India and when I urged her to come with me for one day for a mere 3 hours she told me that has to study. The very next day she asked me to come out with her as she was craving fries and coffee (we usually end up spending 2 hours if we got out). The garba dance night meant a lot to me and this imbecile has the audacity to ask me to go out with her when she cancelled my plan. She ended up coming late for two more days and since I know her schedule so well, I know she wasn’t studying. She and I also got into an argument about religion (she’s quite radical with her views) and she walked out on me after instigating the disagreement. Even though the friendship started on even terms it’s becoming more skewed over time, where she uses me for emotional support but doesn’t give it back. She comes to me for relationship problems but when I share my feelings about my traumatic past, she has nothing to say. I stopped talking to her after that incident and she hasn’t tried talking to me since. I feel like this is a good time to stop this behaviour and set a precedent for this friendship if it goes further, that I cannot tolerate such a skewed relationship. The rational part of me doesn’t stress over letting this go but there’s an anxious part of me that still wants the friendship without the fluff. I feel like I’m ruminating over this.

**Background**

Running has always been a bit of an on-again, off-again affair for me. Back in my school days, I dabbled in it but that’s all. In my late 20s, I briefly started a workplace running club but got distracted and moved on.

Then came the knee injury. Mid-20s, playing football (that's soccer for you on the other side of the pond) where a fateful twist (and crunch) ended any aspiring amateur career. Ever since, it's been a bit of a weakness - my own personal Achilles' heel, only located slightly higher.

Fast forward to my mid-30s through to age 40, and let's just say the bathroom scales and I weren't on speaking terms. I struggled with weight, fluctuating between overweight and obese according to the BMI scale. Every year from 2018 to 2022 followed the same frustrating pattern: January to May would be fantastic - I'd be the poster child for healthy living - but as soon as summer rolled around, I'd slip back into old habits. Kettle chips (crisps), homemade wine, and milk-chocolate digestive biscuits have a lot to answer for.

I had years of on-and-off trail running, but consistency was never my strong suit. I decided enough was enough. In September 2023, I drew a line in the sand. I became determinedly consistent with walks, runs, and strength training. No more yo-yo dieting, no more half-hearted attempts. This was the year I would stay within a reasonable weight!

And what better way to commit than by signing up for a long-half marathon and an ultra-marathon? Because naturally, when you're trying to lose weight and get fit, running 50 miles up and down mountains is the logical next step.

Ultra-running became a cornerstone of my new lifestyle. I briefly shared some of my experiences and progress in some Reddit comments. But reading the experiences and camaraderie of others was incredible, fuelling my determination even more.

**The Build-Up**

Training for a 50-mile mountain race across the Brecon Beacons isn't something you decide on a whim - unless you're particularly fond of pain. I did decide on a whim…

I began my journey on the 13^(th) of May 2024, starting from a base mileage of approximately 50km per week, which, funnily enough, was the exact peak of my only previous race on 4^(th) of May 2024: a 27km circular loop through the same mountainous terrain.

Determined to push my limits, I embarked on a 19-week training plan, with a 5-week peak volume period. The first two peak weeks saw me clocking up 105–115km, followed by a self-supported 53km ultra run in the third week. I wrapped up my peak period with another two weeks at 105–110km, also hitting a peak elevation gain of over 4,000m per week.

To prepare for the gruelling challenge ahead, I did two self-supported runs of over 50km during this peak period - both my longest runs since a self-supported trail marathon about a month prior. I mostly didn’t neglect strength training, though I sacrificed some of it towards the end in favour of more mileage volume. I also managed to squeeze in approximately 30-40km of walking per week, usually with a 1,000m elevation gain. Who needs rest days, anyway? (I jest, I did have one rest day each week!).

I entered the taper injury-free, minus a few niggles and the classic taper tantrums. Mentally, I felt strong and well-prepared. Plan A was to complete the race in the 14-hour mark, though I saw this as somewhat ambitious. Plan B was to finish under 16 hours, which seemed reasonable - as long as I could actually finish. Plan C was simply the classic completion plan. Given that this was a mountainous 50-miler with over 3,800m (over 12,000 feet) of elevation gain, finishing would be an achievement in itself.

I optimised and tested all my gear meticulously. Here's a picture of my kit laid out like a tactical military operation (or at least would be for an amateur military operation…):

https://preview.redd.it/rzqpu69sj9vd1.png?width=867&format=png&auto=webp&s=fcf190a066eb3639ead963e692a8d278d6db94e4

**Pre-Race**

The day had finally arrived. This was my first 50-miler and my first ultra race. I woke up at the unreasonable hour of 3 am and went through my pre-race ritual, which I'd practised during training. It included a cup of coffee (runners will know why), a bacon sandwich, and some light fruit. Just to reduce any uncertainty, let's just say the coffee ensures there are no unexpected pit stops later on.

I triple-checked my kit and dressed for the day. Having registered at the race HQ the night before, all I needed to do was be at Pontneddfechan before 6 am, when the bus would take us to the start point at Hay-on-Wye. Ever the early bird, I was there by 5:20 am.

It was a family affair; I walked to the start with my fiancée and children, not entirely sure how I felt about the race, but grateful for their support. As I boarded the bus, I waved goodbye, with classic me trying to appear more confident than I felt.

During the bus journey, I chatted with a mix of experienced runners -some tackling their first ultra, others their first 50-miler, and a few with 100-milers already under their belts. Everyone was nervous to some degree. I met two people I wouldn't see again and one who would become a familiar companion during the race.

Upon arriving at Hay-on-Wye, we were informed of a slight hiccup… someone had forgotten to collect the key for the main toilets. This caused some concern for a few runners, but thanks to my morning coffee, I'd already ""taken care of business.""

Looking around, my nerves began to kick in, but I reminded myself that I was well-trained and mentally strong for this occasion. I thrive when others are nervous, so chatting with fellow runners helped ease my own jitters!

As we waited, some of the 100-milers arrived at the checkpoint. For them, it was the halfway mark, and they'd been running through the night to get here. We cheered - they looked knackered. In a few hours, that would be me, but at least I wouldn't have another 50 miles to run afterwards!

I did some final pre-race checks on my kit.

https://preview.redd.it/ncjba7ytj9vd1.png?width=795&format=png&auto=webp&s=83dbed6ec08716040dffac84d37a118c02bcc201

As 8 am approached, we gathered for the pre-race briefing, followed by the countdown. The adventure was about to begin.

**Start (Hay-on-Wye) to CP1 (Gospel Pass): \~9.5km**

Standing at the start line, I glanced around at my fellow runners. A mantra echoed in my head: *""Don't go off too fast, don't go off too fast.""* But as the announcer said ""30 seconds to go,"" a rebellious thought surfaced: *""Sod it, I've worked too hard not to smash it.""* Feeling confident in my training, I decided to stick with the front of the pack and perhaps build a buffer.

The race started, and off we went! As usual (I say usual, but what I really mean is my only other race!), my breathing felt odd for the first 5-10km. I tried to breathe normally, but it always seems loud or irregular at the start of a race. Perhaps it's just adrenaline, nerves, or the novelty of running surrounded by others - I usually run in solitude.

I managed to stick with the front pack as much as possible, though the guy who would eventually come first had already disappeared within the first couple of kilometres. As we settled into our pace and left the mid-pack behind, we formed a cluster of four: Adam, who was running just a bit faster than I probably should have; Natalie, who would finish second overall and first female; Joe, one of the runners I'd met on the bus; and myself.

I wanted to stick with these three to push the pace, and also because Adam seemed to know exactly where he was going, allowing me to forget about navigating for a while. Around 6-7km into the race, I definitely noticed we were going faster than I'd planned. I started to wonder if I'd made a mistake but decided to push through, hoping I could recover during the downhills. This first section was mostly uphill, which plays to my strengths, so I didn't want to miss the opportunity.

We followed the route south along Offa's Dyke, gaining altitude most of the time, and then veered north towards the first main peak, Hay Bluff. Visibility was poor, and there was a risk of heavy rain and thunderstorms.

https://preview.redd.it/kllb7b9vj9vd1.png?width=831&format=png&auto=webp&s=b339cfee109e8923e7591c90856a0309083f89de

I quickly experienced some sliding downhill in my Brooks Catamount 3 - the muddy terrain was not ideal! I was strong on the uphill and flat sections, often catching up with the others, but they were much better at technical descents than I was. Something to improve on before the Ultra-Trail Snowdonia 100k in May 2025.

I settled into the fast pace, hanging on by sheer determination. Deep down, I expected to have to ease off and let the others go ahead, but for now, I enjoyed the company and the challenge. From Hay Bluff, we descended to the first checkpoint at Gospel Pass. I stopped briefly to swap out two bottles of Tailwind, while the others pushed straight through without stopping. Apparently, pit stops are for the weak! (Note, they did not actually say this 😊).

**CP1 (Gospel Pass) to CP2 (Cockett Hill): 22km**

It took me about 15 minutes to catch up with Joe, Natalie, and Adam, eventually rejoining them partway up Twmpa, our next main peak. From there, we followed the Cambrian Way, contouring around ridges but still unable to see much due to low cloud cover and drizzle.

Shortly after, we were battered by wind, rain, and hailstones! It was like being attacked by a swarm of angry bees. We made jokes about the ""lovely views"" as we peered through the fog. Natalie kept racing ahead, occasionally heading in the wrong direction before circling back. She joked that she was notorious for her navigational skills.

The four of us remained mostly together, tackling a rollercoaster of hills including Y Grib, Pen y Grib, Castell Dinas, and Mynydd Troed, before heading towards our next checkpoint, Cockit Hill.

The descent from Castell Dinas and especially Mynydd Troed was really slippery. The others kept pulling away from me on each technical descent, but this was fortunate because it meant they didn't witness my glorious slide on my arse for about 50 metres down a hill. Partly due to my trail runners not being well-suited for the muddy terrain, but also perhaps my technique needs further work. Each time, I caught up with the others on the flat sections - which were few and far between - and the uphills, of which there were plenty.

**CP2 (Cockett Hill) to CP3 (Llangynidr): 32.5km**

At the checkpoint, I did my usual two-bottle Tailwind swap and indulged in my first slice of orange. We began the slog up Mynydd Llangorse, followed by a pleasant, stable descent that continued along the Beacons Way. This section was a much-needed respite after the brutal battering my quads and calves had endured earlier.

As we progressed, Adam and Natalie started to break away while Joe and I settled into our own pace. It wasn't wise to keep pushing at their speed, and we'd already established ourselves towards the front of the pack, though quite some way behind first place.

By the time we reached Bwlch, we'd lost sight of the other two. Occasionally, we'd see them somewhere up a mountain in the distance, but not too far ahead so we knew that we were still pushing the pace.

From Bwlch, we mixed between light trails, road sections, and treacherous bridges with people competing with us in their Range Rovers. One lady in particular frowned at us, and Joe and I joked that we knew what she was thinking as she looked at us: *""Real men do Ironman.""*

We followed the canal route to the next checkpoint, only getting briefly lost because my GPX points didn't correspond correctly with the app I was using. From that point onwards, we decided Joe's route/app combination would be better. Finally, we arrived at the next checkpoint, which also held our drop bags and a chance to change gear if desired. I felt that the drop bags should have been available later, but I guess there was a location-limiting reason for making them available here.

**CP3 (Llangynidr) to CP4 (Blaen y Glyn): 46km**

I did my usual Tailwind swap and grabbed another slice of orange, along with a glass of Coke for a sugar boost. I decided to change my socks - more for psychological comfort than necessity - and swapped out my empty food packets for another eight hours' worth of fuel. I decided to leave behind two sachets of Tailwind because, for some reason, I felt I wouldn't need them and that I'd be finishing faster than expected. Famous last words?

We were pleased with our progress so far. We weren't far behind the rest of the pack at this point (except for first place), and the next few runners were far enough behind that we could take it easy for a bit and prepare for the tough challenges ahead.

Leaving the checkpoint, I felt strong and ecstatic that we were over halfway! I had a few muscle niggles, and the insoles of my shoes were unexpectedly riding up beneath my toes, which was uncomfortable but nothing major. Something I would need to keep an eye on at the next checkpoint.

https://preview.redd.it/6jotm1ixj9vd1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b8662f1cf6dd445b7e0e7ff4ef20674ba05a8dd

We hit a road section, which was a relief for my quads and calves but brought pain to other muscle groups. I tried to ignore the discomfort and concentrated on chatting with Joe, breathing, and maintaining good running form. The road was a good time to get a grip on my form rather than the Chuckle Brothers form I’d been using on the trails.

That relief ended with a challenging climb up Tor y Foel, with its steep incline and multiple demoralising false summits. This hill is much harder than it appears on paper and felt like it took forever. This was where my first mental battle began. While I never doubted that I'd finish the race, thoughts like *""when is this hill ever going to end?""*, *""do I really enjoy this?""*, and *“this is hard”* started to creep in. Joe was amazing at this point; he kept talking, and even though I couldn't always respond, I really appreciated his high spirits. Never stop talking Joe!

Things got easier after Tor y Foel. The steady descent replaced the mental battles with sheer exhilaration. The weather was clearing, and we could now see the Beacons peaking over the reservoir, which helped lift our spirits. We soon encountered forest sections, scree slopes (ok, not quite that bad!), and more road sections. The mental wall was long gone, and I was feeling good again, so we picked up the pace.

Then the climbs started again, up towards the next checkpoint - a seemingly endless uphill that was only partially runnable. More minor mental battles ensued, but nothing that our ultra-train couldn't handle!

**CP4 (Blaen y Glyn) to CP5 (A470): 60km**

At the checkpoint, the Run, Walk, Crawl volunteers asked how I was feeling - about my muscles, energy levels, and so on. I suspect they were assessing whether I should continue. Despite feeling jaded and a bit tired, I had no intention of dropping out. Besides, a few more glasses of Coke and slices of orange worked wonders.

Joe commented that they only had the cheap version of Coke on display but could see the original Coca-Cola hidden away. I responded, ""That was the best bloody Coke I've ever had in my life"" and we both roared with laughter. Perhaps you had to be there...

I knew what to expect coming out of this checkpoint. I'd run up the beast of a climb - Craig y Fan Ddu through to Bwlch y Ddwyallt - twice before and knew the rolling Brecon Beacons lay ahead.

The climb started fine. I was a bit tired, my calves were hurting a bit more, and one specific area of my quads was feeling iffy, but nothing some tactical stretches couldn't solve. We followed the Cambrian and Beacons Way along another rollercoaster of ridges and hills.

https://preview.redd.it/69ljq1gyj9vd1.png?width=822&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e493051fa8fb2683654ab991bc8929cb019767c

We crossed the 50km mark, which was an important milestone for me, and I noted that I'd achieved a personal record. At 54km, I was now into unknown territory - the furthest I'd ever run. Around this point, the risk of calf and quad cramping increased, so I needed to stretch them out as I ran by altering my form, moving through the gears until I reached a good pace. We were still making great time and having great fun!

The terrain turned much more technical along the Brecon Beacon ridges, with lots of puddles, narrow sections, obstacles, scree, talus, and day walkers. Even though it was mostly flat, I couldn't keep pace with Joe and was hitting another mental wall. Joe was torn; he didn't want to leave me behind but also wanted to push the pace. We'd had already kind of agreed that if one of us needed to slow down, the other should carry on. I insisted he go ahead, assuring him I'd catch up if I could. Joe said he'd wait for me at the finish.

This was a good decision because a 20 to 30-minute spell at my own pace, using my own strengths, was exactly what I needed. The climb up Fan y Big was challenging, but I started to recover from my slump and felt strong enough to pick up my pace again.

By the descent from Fan y Big, I could see Joe getting closer and closer. At some point towards the bottom, I finally caught up, shouting, *""I'm baaaack!""* He smiled and said, *""I'm glad you made it.""*

We climbed and descended Cribyn and noticed that we'd now met up with the 50k runners. We started overtaking a lot of them, which also raised our spirits because we'd been running for 7 to 8 hours. Many of the 50k runners were shocked to find out that we were running the 50-mile race and still looking strong. That helped me feel like it was all worthwhile.

During the Cribyn climb, we also passed Adam (remember him?), who later said he'd hit the wall at this point. We cheered him on, told him he was doing amazing, and carried on up the hill at our own pace.

The climb up Pen y Fan was expectedly hard on tired legs, but we made it! This was the point I knew that, barring an injury, I'd be finishing this race.

https://preview.redd.it/ep0qff7zj9vd1.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c49c86ade42efe32e826dee5be5fa26c2cce871

The descent down Pen y Fan was swift, dodging all the walkers who looked at us as if we were crazy - though, I suppose we must be to some extent. I felt fully recovered (in 50-mile terms) by the time we got to the A470.

We made our way to the A470 checkpoint, where there was a buzzing atmosphere full of 50k runners - a nice change from previous checkpoints where we were usually the only runners. Once again, I had a glass (or three) of Coke and a slice (or three) of orange. At this point, I wished I'd packed fewer Trek Bars, which I could no longer stomach even though they'd worked well in training, and instead packed more gels. Live and learn, I guess! I’ll put it down to the pace difference between training and race.

 

 

**CP5 (A470) to CP6 (Ystradfellte): 72km**

While I knew I'd finish, there was still the challenge of Fan Fawr, muddy and boggy terrain, and, to a lesser extent, the climb up Fan Llia.

I tried not to think too much about the Fan Fawr incline. Joe was having a few niggles at this point but nothing to worry about. I was feeling strong after the slog up Fan Fawr, but from my training runs in this area, I knew exactly where I was and reminded myself that I was going to finish. Our spirits were high, but as Joe correctly pointed out, *""That was a big hill that took forever.""*

Shortly after summiting Fan Fawr, Adam caught up and overtook us. He'd obviously broken through his wall and was back to flying across the terrain. I wouldn't see Adam again until the end.

The terrain between Fan Fawr and Fan Llia was challenging due to the grass height, bogs (I laughed when Joe went knee-deep into one, thanking him for helping me avoid it), missing tracks, and very uneven ground. There were even a few rivers and streams to cross, adding to the sense of adventure.

By the time we climbed Fan Llia, I could see my own training mountain near my home. *""It's just over there,""* I said to Joe. We were well ahead of time; my Plan A of a sub-15-hour finish was definitely on the cards. We even started talking about the impossible: could we actually finish in the 12-hour mark? Surely not, we thought, but decided to keep pushing - sensibly - and find out.

At some point, my fiancée messaged me asking if I actually only had 12km remaining, as she was expecting me much later. I managed my first two-word text message reply during the race: *""Smashing it.""*

I think Joe and I really enjoyed the section between Fan Llia and Ystradfellte. It was all downhill (in the good way) from here, and we laughed, joked, and reflected on what we'd already achieved. This section cemented our brothers-in-arms experience and was great fun. I never actually expected to ""have a laugh"" during a 50-mile mountain run!

We hit a road section after Fan Llia, which wasn't the most interesting - though I pointed out that while tarmac sucks, the mountains still looked stunning. We mostly maintained a nice easy pace, but sometimes even pushed to about 5 to 5:30 minutes per kilometre where possible, which was surprising considering how long we'd been running. I felt very strong (\*with niggles) as we entered the next checkpoint.

**CP6 (Ystradfellte) to Finish (Pontneddfechan): 80km**

We stayed at the checkpoint for only a few of minutes. I realised I'd carried too much food! I'd planned for 16 hours and was now likely to finish in the 12-hour mark. I had extra Trek Bars and Hi5 bars that I couldn't stomach, but also didn’t need. I'd finished all my Tailwind though, which was good because it meant my decision at the drop bag to leave two behind was the correct one. I had one remaining gel, which I took with a few miles remaining for that little extra boost.

At the checkpoint, we were told there was about 5.5 miles remaining. That felt like such a short distance, yet also such a long one. At this point, we knew no one in the 50-mile race would be catching us up. We weren't sure if we were currently in fourth or fifth place but decided to just take it easy for the rest of the race and not get injured.

I still felt strong for the road and forest sections, sometimes running at a good pace of 5 to 5:30 minutes per kilometre, with short tactical walk breaks for uphill sections because, well, why not?

I enjoyed overtaking a few more people running the 50k race, especially kudos to the guy wearing hiking boots rather than trail runners! That must have hurt…

The sun was just starting to set, and we couldn't believe we'd beaten all the mountain and technical sections in the daylight. We decided to turn on our head torches ready for the waterfall of Sgwd Yr Eira.

From this point, everything felt a bit chilled, and we both felt in great spirits, though Joe was worried his family wouldn't make it to the finish line because we were so far ahead of schedule.

The steps to the waterfall were cruel! Joe, being much taller than me, seemed to handle them better, but I needed to do an awkward jump-hop-step movement that came with a reasonable amount of pain. We went under the waterfall (through the back), did a little muddy climb into the forest, and continued along a narrow single track with considerable puddles, nettles, thorns, and stones to dodge. I didn’t make it out scratch free…

The final kilometre lasted forever and was made worse by another set of cruel steps, polished and very slippery. I had to develop a new weird technique involving steps, hops, side lunges, and handrail holding. Not an elegant ending, but Joe and I found a way to make it funny - we'd hit that point of insanity!

We started talking about how we would cross the line together and decided on arms around each other, like brothers for the day.

The final moments were surreal. It was dark, but suddenly we were surrounded by lights. I heard my fiancée and our kids but couldn't see them - just focused on the finish line!

We came joint fifth which was amazing! We’ll, technically I came sixth and Joe beat me by a second, but I don’t think either of us will argue the case on that one!

https://preview.redd.it/whtogxb0k9vd1.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=df206421cdea520f58e4cc2838b07f7f7a5f38ba

It turns out Joe's family just made it in time and saw him crossing the finish line. After 12 hours and 9 minutes of running, they made it with seconds to spare. What timing!

https://preview.redd.it/gnv3t601k9vd1.png?width=546&format=png&auto=webp&s=87f3f02efda01c246376e01b4164980ef25d08ec

Apparently, to my dot watchers, Joe (number 43) was the enemy, while I (number 61) was the enemy of Joe's dot watchers. Nobody could tell we were running together!

**Post-Race**

I limped back to the car, and my fiancée drove us to KFC and then back home. I took the best shower I've had in a long time - I was filthy. The kids went to bed, and I cracked open a beer and had a couple of drinks until I could finally stomach the KFC.

Reflecting on the race, I felt it was well-run by Run, Walk, Crawl, and the volunteers were excellent and so helpful - a big shout-out to them! They lifted my spirits and helped me with the Tailwind transitions, which made a world of difference and made me feel emotional at the time.

The photographers on the day were great, popping up like ninjas when you least expected a picture, lifting our spirits along the way with jokes and jests. He even managed to catch Joe in the act!

https://preview.redd.it/tz4l8mu1k9vd1.png?width=822&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef8a7838ec61f6d45d93b5baca226d3c95b42458

My training was spot on; there's not much I would change, though I do need to improve my technical descent for the next race.

Nutrition was good but not optimal. Tailwind every hour worked well, as did my first two four-hour fuel cycles (every hour a Tailwind, plus on hour one a Trek Bar, hour two a gel, hour three a Hi5 bar, hour four a gel or packet or crisps). But after two cycles, I should switch to gels only - and Coke and oranges at the aid stations, of course.

In the end, finishing the Black Beacon 50 Mile Mountain Race was an incredible experience - filled with challenges, laughter, and new friendships. It taught me a lot about myself, my training, and the kindness of strangers who become companions on the trail. Here's to the next adventure!

I genuinely feel like I cant live a normal life anymore, I am exhausted, things I feel like have helped a tiny bit were doing daily walks, but ive noticed myself just slowing down or i’ll get a cramp while walking as if its like “super hard” and Ive been having a medium challenge with eating, I haven’t been as hungry, before pregnancy I never ate a lot, usually about 2 meals, but now Im having trouble even finishing 1 meal each day.  Ive substituted with some more liquids like veggie/fruit mixed drinks since its much easier to get down.
I don’t even have an issue with any nausea, my whole pregnancy has been free of that minus times ive done long windy car rides or went sailing.  

I can bet that my eating habits don’t help with energy, I still feel like I am getting enough calories since not everyday is a day where I only eat one meal and some snacks.  (Could be denial) 

My lack of energy is genuinely interrupting my day-day life.  

I keep having a guilt feeling for wanting to be in bed at 8pm, not being able to stay out of the house as long.  Im also really starting to have crazy back pains usually tailbone from the pressure of my uterus growing/moving but the main issue for me is the exhaustion.

What tips, tricks has helped.  

I do have my doctors appointment end of next week but I’m desperate to have more energy.

1g5ksy5,https://www.reddit.com/r/howtoworkonlinenow/comments/1g5ksy5/common_issues_people_face_when_trying_to_work/,Common Issues People Face When Trying to Work Online,"The rise of online work has transformed the way we approach our professional lives. With more freedom and flexibility than ever, millions of people are trading traditional office spaces for home offices, coffee shops, or even beaches. But, working online isn't always as dreamy as it sounds. Along with the perks, there are some common challenges that many people face. In this article, we’ll break down these challenges and offer practical solutions.

# Lack of Proper Work-Life Balance

One of the most frequently cited issues with working online is the struggle to maintain a healthy work-life balance. Since online workers often don’t have set hours, the boundaries between personal and professional life can blur quickly.

# Blurring Boundaries Between Personal and Work Life

When your home becomes your office, it can be hard to switch off. Without the physical separation between your workplace and living space, you may find yourself constantly “on” — answering emails during dinner or brainstorming ideas while watching TV. The risk of overworking becomes real when you can work anytime, anywhere.

# The Risk of Burnout in Remote Work

Constantly being available may seem productive at first, but it can lead to burnout over time. Without proper downtime, mental fatigue sets in, making you less efficient and more stressed.

# Solutions for Creating Balance

To avoid this, it’s crucial to establish clear boundaries. Setting fixed work hours, creating a designated workspace, and using apps that block work-related notifications after hours can all help in creating balance.

# Poor Time Management

Online work offers flexibility, but for many, this flexibility turns into a struggle with time management. When you don’t have a supervisor watching over your shoulder, it’s easy to lose track of time.

# Difficulty in Managing Flexible Schedules

Many remote workers find it challenging to manage their schedules effectively. Whether it’s over-scheduling or under-scheduling, time management can make or break your productivity.

# Procrastination in a Remote Setting

Working from home can also breed procrastination. With no one to monitor you, it’s tempting to put off tasks in favor of distractions — be it Netflix, social media, or that sudden urge to clean the house.

# Tools to Improve Time Management Skills

Using time-tracking tools like Toggl or Trello can help. These tools help you manage your daily tasks and keep you accountable for deadlines.

# Inconsistent Internet and Technology Issues

Reliable internet is the backbone of online work, and when it fails, it can create significant problems.

# Impact of Unreliable Internet Connections

Nothing disrupts your workflow more than a spotty internet connection. Whether you’re in the middle of a video call or uploading important documents, an unreliable internet connection can cause delays and frustration.

# Hardware and Software Failures

Besides internet issues, faulty hardware or software crashes can stop your workday in its tracks. If your computer freezes or the platform you’re using goes down, you lose precious time.

# Strategies to Overcome Tech Challenges

Investing in a strong internet connection and reliable equipment can save you headaches down the line. Additionally, always have a backup plan, like using a mobile hotspot in case your home internet fails.

# Isolation and Loneliness

While working from home can be peaceful, it also comes with the risk of isolation.

# Lack of Face-to-Face Interaction

When you work online, especially if you’re a freelancer, the lack of face-to-face interaction can be isolating. You may find yourself missing the camaraderie of an office environment.

# Social Isolation's Effect on Mental Health

Over time, isolation can negatively impact your mental health, leading to feelings of loneliness or depression. Humans are social creatures, and working alone every day can be tough.

# How to Stay Connected and Engaged

To combat this, make an effort to stay connected. Schedule virtual coffee breaks with colleagues, join online communities related to your work, and make time for social activities outside of work.

# Difficulty Staying Motivated

Staying productive when working online can be a challenge, especially when no one is holding you accountable.

# No Supervision and Self-Discipline Struggles

Without a boss or manager nearby, you’re entirely responsible for your productivity. This freedom can be both a blessing and a curse. It’s easy to slack off when you know no one is checking in on you.

# The Temptation of Distractions

From social media to household chores, distractions are everywhere. With so many temptations around, it’s hard to stay focused on work.

# Building a Routine for Success

Creating a daily routine is one of the best ways to stay motivated. Break your day into manageable chunks, schedule breaks, and set clear goals to maintain productivity.

# Miscommunication with Clients and Colleagues

Communication is key in any job, and working online presents its own unique challenges.

# Challenges of Communicating Through Digital Platforms

When communication happens through emails, texts, or video calls, it’s easy for things to get lost in translation. Unlike face-to-face conversations, digital communication lacks nuance.

# Misinterpretations and Lack of Clarity

Miscommunication can lead to misunderstandings, project delays, and frustration. The lack of immediate feedback can also slow down the process.

# Tips for Effective Online Communication

To avoid these pitfalls, always aim for clarity. Use tools like Slack for quick communication, and make sure to clarify any unclear points through follow-up emails or calls.

# Payment and Financial Issues

Freelancers and remote workers often face financial uncertainties that traditional workers might not.

# Delayed Payments and Financial Instability

One common issue is delayed payments. If a client is late in paying, it can disrupt your cash flow and cause stress.

# Navigating Different Payment Platforms

Another challenge is dealing with multiple payment platforms like PayPal, TransferWise, or direct bank transfers, each of which has its own fees and processing times.

# Strategies to Ensure Timely Compensation

Setting clear payment terms in your contracts and using invoicing software can help ensure you get paid on time. Don’t hesitate to follow up if payments are delayed.

# Lack of Job Security and Career Progression

Online work, particularly freelancing, often lacks the stability of a traditional job.

# Freelancing vs. Traditional Jobs

Freelancers don’t have the safety net of benefits like health insurance, pensions, or paid leave, making job security a real concern.

# Building a Stable Career Online

To build stability, diversify your client base and avoid putting all your eggs in one basket. Investing in continuous learning and networking can also help you stay relevant in a fast-changing industry.

# The Importance of Continuous Learning

Keeping up with new trends, tools, and skills can give you a competitive edge and help you climb the career ladder, even in the online world.

# Managing Multiple Roles

Online workers, especially freelancers, often have to juggle several roles at once.

# Balancing Client Work, Marketing, and Admin Tasks

From completing client projects to handling your own marketing and administrative tasks, you’ll find yourself wearing many hats. This can be overwhelming if not managed properly.

# Wearing Multiple Hats: From Freelancer to Entrepreneur

As an online worker, you might need to act as your own marketer, accountant, and project manager all at once. It’s a lot to handle, but tools like Hootsuite or QuickBooks can ease the burden.

# Using Tools to Streamline Tasks

Streamline your workflow with project management tools like Asana or ClickUp. These platforms help you stay organized and ensure nothing falls through the cracks.

# Overcoming the Learning Curve

The online world is constantly evolving, and staying relevant means adapting to new platforms and tools.

# Adapting to New Tools and Platforms

Every platform has its own set of rules and best practices, which means constant learning. Whether it’s a new social media platform or a project management tool, the learning never stops.

# Constant Need for Upskilling

Online workers must continuously upskill to stay competitive. This can be exhausting but is essential to career longevity.

# Resources for Staying Up-to-Date

There are plenty of resources to help you upskill, from online courses on platforms like Coursera and Udemy to webinars and industry blogs.

# Security and Privacy Concerns

Working online opens up a whole host of security and privacy risks.

# Cybersecurity Threats in Remote Work

Cyberattacks and data breaches are common issues in the digital space. Without proper precautions, your personal and professional data could be at risk.

# Protecting Personal and Professional Data

From weak passwords to unsecured Wi-Fi connections, there are many ways your security can be compromised. Ensuring you use strong passwords and encrypted tools can safeguard your data.

# Best Practices for Online Security

Using VPNs, multi-factor authentication, and encrypted communication tools are essential for maintaining privacy and security online.

# Managing Client Expectations

Working online often involves juggling clients from different time zones, which can make managing expectations tricky.

# Setting Boundaries with Clients

Clear communication is vital to managing client expectations. Setting boundaries, such as office hours and response times, ensures that clients respect your time.

# Difficulties in Delivering Work Across Time Zones

Time zone differences can create delays or misalignments in project deadlines. This makes clear project timelines and communication even more critical.

# Effective Project Management Tips

Using tools like [Monday.com](http://Monday.com) or Notion can help you manage projects and keep clients updated on progress, no matter where they’re located.

# Lack of Routine and Structure

While working online offers flexibility, it can also lead to a lack of routine and consistency.

# Difficulty in Maintaining a Consistent Routine

Without a structured environment, it’s easy to slip into irregular work hours and chaotic workdays. This lack of routine can harm your productivity.

# Importance of Creating a Structured Workday

Creating a daily structure — even if you’re working from your living room — is key to staying productive. Set a regular start time, schedule breaks, and establish a clear end to your workday.

# Tools to Help Create Consistency

Productivity apps like Forest or Pomodoro timers can help you stick to a routine and maintain consistency.

# Conclusion

Working online comes with its fair share of challenges, from time management issues to feelings of isolation. However, with the right tools and strategies, these challenges can be overcome. Whether it’s setting clear boundaries, using time-tracking apps, or improving your communication skills, there are many ways to make online work more productive and enjoyable.

I (M29) married my wife (F27) three years ago after falling in love with who she was and portrayed to me as a person. But sadly things changed drastically after marriage. She has abused my parents on multiple occasions privately to me, cursed them, abused me, told me i’m not a man, disrespected me, she slapped me once and even does weird shit like “you dare step out of the bedroom “ when she’s angry and having a heated argument with me. On many occasions when having the said fight she has asked for a divorce and said she regrets ever being with me or meeting me but then after a bit of calming down comes back to me with hugs and kisses and apologies. She has even mocked my childhood traumas and has told me the lack of intimacy between us could be because of that but in reality after so many things coming from her end and on such a high level which i couldn’t let go has caused these intimacy issues. When i tried to speak about these issues between us she would get mad at me and just say i should let go of things more and not cling onto words. 
Dear redditors, please be informed that i have left no stone unturned as a husband. I Support her family financially every month, help do the dishes, help cooking dishes, take her out every single day, even buy food from outside, coffee dates everything and she’s been very happy and satisfied as she knows i have given her the world which she never had come from a unstable financial background then why such treatment? Why does she think i deserve this? And as for my parents they haven’t even asked her for a glass of water or any personal favors. 
Generally, to everyone she comes of a very sweet, kind and sensitive person who is literally even scared of a stray cat walking on the road but turns into this demon when we are within the four walls of our bedroom or inside the car. Screaming on top of her voice, crying, shouting, abusing and cursing. 

She’s currently back in her home country and a couple of days ago we had another such heated argument where she abused my parents again because my father failed to answer her fathers call when he was calling to talk. I couldn’t take it anymore and i finally after 2 years of keeping quiet i broke it all out to my parents and they were shocked to hear all this. My parents have asked me to cancel her visa and let her stay where she is and ask for a divorce. 
Ever since then my so called wife has gotten a stench of things getting worse as my mother confronted her through text and ever since then has been apologists telling me that she’s changed, trying to call me multiple times to talk (but i never answered because i do not have the heart to anymore) but last night i spoke to her and she’s been very apologetic, crying and has promised to change her ways but i don’t feel it anymore.. i don’t feel the love for her anymore nor do i feel the affection for her… 
The worst part is that i’m feeling guilty about letting her go and i’m not able to ask her for a divorce or tell her about how i feel because i’m worried to how she’d react to it, i’m afraid she might harm herself or do something worse and i do not want to listen to her cry and tell me all those sweet things as i know my hearts a sucker for such things and i’d fall right into it again. I do know what the right thing is but i just dont know how to do it..even though i have fought countless battles as a kid and with life in general but in this time when i need it the most i’m failing to do so..

TLDR: I’m not able to divorce my abusive and ungrateful wife, i’m feeling guilty and fear thinking what might happen to her if i do so or how she might react to it but i want out since i do not have any feelings left for her",1,1729147365.0,Marriage,3,1.0,False

If you've seen my other posts most of the stuff that I make is just reworking my existing recipes over to low carb for the boyfriend and is just swapping around ingredients and portion sizes.I use this recipe when I have leftover pumpkin pie filling.Ingredients:For the coffee:16 to 24 oz strong coffee2 cups unsweetened plain almond milk or other unsweetened milk (can make a blend of nut milk and cream)1+ tsp vanilla extract 1 to 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice 2+ tbsp pumpkin puree Sweetener (I use allulose)For the topping:1 cup heavy whipping cream1 tsp vanilla extract 2+ tbsp sweetener (I use allulose)Pumpkin's pie spice or ground cinnamon or ground nutmeg, etc.A pinch of xanthem gum or thickener (optional)Preparation:Brew your coffee strong!If brewing espresso, see notesAfter brewing the coffee, add coffee to a pot, add unsweetened almond milk, vanilla extract, pumpkin pie spice (use more or less vanilla and pumpkin pie spice to taste), pumpkin puree (use more or less to taste, some people like it with no pumpkin puree) add sweetener to taste.Heat on medium heat and stir until it is well mixed and the pumpkin pie spice has dissolved or it will be grainy.Pour into cups and enjoy.Optional topping:For the topping I make a sugar-free whipped topping. Instead of pouring coffee into cups, cover and put the stove on low so it won't burn and keeps it warm.In a bowl, add heavy whipping cream, sweetener and vanilla extract. The amount of vanilla extract and sweeteners up to individual taste.Whisk until peaks start to form.Sprinkling a tiny bit of xanthan gum (optional)Continue whisking until stiff peaks form.Pour coffee into cups, top with whip topping, sprinkle with optional pumpkin pie spice or cinnamon or nutmeg etc.Enjoy.Notes:This works with medium roast or dark roast coffee, I prefer it with a darker roast. This doesn't work with a blonde roast or light roast because it will overpower the coffee and you won't even taste it.I put a little xanthan gum in my whipped topping because I use heavy whipping cream that does not have binders and it will start to separate immediately with the hot coffee.For espresso brewingBrew a few shots of espresso, add the coffee a little at a time into the almond milk mixture until you get the taste and consistency you want.My preferred methodMy usual method for morning coffee is pour over or mocha pot but for coffee drinks like this I use a 12 cup stove top percolator.I make 24 oz coffee.I use roughly 26 oz of water to 6 tbsp coffee after grinding and 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice.Instead of putting the pumpkin pie spice into the almond milk mixture, I put it directly in with the coffee grinds and mix it in before brewing.That way it is not grainy. I add five extra minutes of brewing time. I brew it in a way it doesn't get bitter even with the extra time so I don't have to use extra coffee.One of my supervisor, she will add the pumpkin pie spice and extra coffee into her basket with her 12 cup Mr Coffe.Boyfriend uses 1 tbsp pumpkin pie spice and 3 tbsp pumpkin puree to 24 oz coffee.

1g5kmr9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1g5kmr9/my_marriage_counselor_is_making_me_furious_am_i/,My marriage counselor is making me furious. Am I crazy? ,"My husband I have been struggling with some things and recently decided to see a marriage counselor. Now, I’m still pretty new to my AuDHD diagnoses (a little over a year), but I have been in therapy for over 20 years. I’ve had both good and bad therapists, and I am grateful that my current, personal therapist is amazing. 

My husband has been very receptive and engaged in the process, but he’s not as experienced with therapy. He’s also a veteran and believes very strongly in supporting the VA. So, when we started looking for a therapist, I thought maybe he’d feel more at home in the experience by going somewhere he was already comfortable. So we started seeing a social worker at the VA, who “specializes” in CBCT for PTSD. Both my husband and I have experienced some pretty significant trauma, although very different varieties. 

From our very first meeting, I was put off by this therapist. Her office is absolute chaos. Budgetary constraints of the VA aside, she’s just a mess. Piles of books/papers on the floor, backpack and lunchboxes lying around, candy bar wrappers on her desk, and just an obscene amount of “therapy flair” plastering the walls, most of which is old, faded, and peeling. But these sensory nightmares would be nothing if she were actually competent and professional (I do understand all of us are human and imperfect). 

She has her desk oriented so that her work area faces her clients. And on top of this terrible office layout, she leaves her two monitors on with her email and patient management system just wide open. I can literally read the subjects of all her emails and see every client name on her schedule without even trying. What’s worse, today we were in session and as she was facing us, her monitors only visible in her peripheral vision, they went to sleep. But instead of LEAVING THEM ASLEEP like any sane professional, she turned and tapped a key to turn them back on…in the middle of my husband speaking directly to her! 

But wait, there’s more! For someone that supposedly specializes in a particular type of therapy, you’d expect them to be able to go “off-book,” right? I can understand needing to glance at some notes here and there, but she literally has her CBCT for PTSD manual in her hand and reads from it like a script. Not even in a, “hey, this is actually worded really well and I think it could be helpful to hear,” kind of way. It’s, like she is so barely acquainted with it, you’d think she was a brand new student. But no, she’s been a therapist for 20+ years and has seen “hundreds” of couples. 

Which brings up another issue…she talks about her other client couples and her own marriage incessantly. We can barely get a word in edgewise some sessions because half of them are just her reading to us, and then a quarter of the time she’s going on for the 12th time about how she and her husband fought about who makes the coffee. 

But what really put the nail in the coffin today was her infantilizing me in a way I have never experienced in a therapist’s office. I am a highly sensitive person and suffer from intense hyperemotionality. I cry easily anyway, but most especially when I am dealing with difficult topics. She’s commented on it in prior sessions, usually saying something cutesy and what I assume is intended to be disarming at the end of the session, like “hey, I didn’t even make you cry today.” But today, I had to make a pretty major admission about something extraordinarily painful that happened to me. Something I have never even verbalized fully with my current personal therapist of almost three years. Naturally I had a very strong emotional reaction to it, and it took me several moments to come down. Her response to this? Not to ask me if I was ok or to let me sit in my feelings for a moment. It was to hand me a fucking Beanie Baby. She got up, reached over my head and pulled one down off of a shelf, telling me that she keeps them up there for her kids and she thought I might find it comforting. Because just feel how soft! 

Ugh. My ears are still ringing in fury 14 hours later. 

Ok, this ended up being much longer than I intended, and I doubt anyone will want to read through this wall of text. Regardless, it already feels cathartic enough that I may be able to sleep now. Bless you lovely souls. ",8,1729146819.0,AutismInWomen,4,0.9,False

I'm a 41 year old, married man who is seeking additional partners for himself. I'm 6'3, 220lbs, have a dad bod, long brown hair, a full red beard, and brown eyes.

I don't feel comfortable putting pictures of me up on Reddit as I don't want to be recognized, but I will be happy to share what I look like once we connect.

I promise, there are no surprises. No baldness, not majorly overweight, and probably a solid 6.

No point in lying, right?

I'm into all the standard needy polyam stuff, like TTRPGS, close-knit hangouts, cuddling, and animals. And, in case you're allergic, I have 3 huskies.

I'm a vocal, anarchist-leaning leftist who is interested in dismantling the patriarchy and ending white supremacy. I promise I'm not too serious all the time.

If there is anything else, I am an open book. Feel free to ask.

I'm looking for something meaningful, not purely sexual. If there is no connection when we meet for coffee, it's not going to go further. I'm at a point where I understand what I am looking for and know when it's there.

I'm open to women and trans-femme individuals. Not looking for a unicorn or to include my wife. Seeking a *real* relationship, not something superficial.

And, now that I've made it this far, I kind of like the idea of getting to know eachother before we see eachother, so let's try that.

Look forward to talking to you.

The long-distance aspect initially threw me off because I worry it might be really challenging, and I’m a bit concerned he might only be looking for something casual, even though he says he’s interested in a long-term relationship. I asked him why he listed his location as Australia when he doesn’t live here, and he explained that it was the first day he signed up. His client, who lives in Australia, is in a relationship with someone in San Diego, told him how to change the location, and he thought it was romantic to met someone in Australia. After we connected, he changed his location back.

I’ve continued talking to him because he mentioned he’s open to the possibility of moving to Australia for six months to see if we can make it work. He runs a small company with a partner, so he has some flexibility with his work location. We’ve been getting to know each other slowly, discussing our backgrounds and interests.

A month later, he travelled to the city where I live, and we spent 9 hours together, from 12 PM to 9 PM. We had lunch at a Japanese restaurant and grabbed coffee afterward. I showed him around the city, and we enjoyed a lovely dinner at a romantic restaurant. We kept talking and laughing. This was the longest I’ve ever spent with someone on a first date, and it was amazing. I can’t quite express it, but I felt like he was the perfect person I’ve ever met.

Even though we come from very different backgrounds, we share similar views on life and easily get each other’s jokes. He kept expressing similar feelings throughout the day. The date ended with a sweet kiss, and he called an Uber for me.

One thing I wanted to mention is that he showed me his driver’s ID while we were discussing different laws in various states. He was also wearing a uniform T-shirt with his company logo under his casual business shirt. I looked him up online and found consistent information about him, so everything checks out. There are several articles online that provide detailed information about his work history.

He also mentioned that he plans to travel back to Australia in Dec for a couple of weeks since I told him I would have three weeks of annual leave and holidays during that time.  He seems to have a plan for us to spend time together.

This was followed by another date two days later after work. I ended up waiting about an hour because his business meeting ran late. When we finally met at a restaurant near his hotel, we quickly ordered some food and then headed to his hotel.

Before going to his hotel, I made it clear that I’m looking for a long-term relationship and that I’m not ready for sex. I also mentioned that while I’d love to come over, I wouldn’t be able to stay too late because I had an early morning meeting (which was a bit of an excuse, as I didn’t want to give him the wrong impression since he suggested I stay over). When he brought up the sleepover, I felt a bit concerned that he might just want something casual, so I clarified my feelings with him. He reassured me that he’s not rushing into anything and wouldn’t pressure me. He mentioned that he just wants to have some cuddles.

Throughout our time together, I felt comfortable and truly enjoyed being with him. We cuddled and talked about our past relationships and families. There was a strong chemistry between us, and we shared many kisses. While it felt a bit intense, we managed to keep things in check. He called an Uber for me and walked me to the door around 12am.

We also shared our feelings about the dates in the days that followed. He said I’m pretty and smart, and that we can engage in deeper conversations. I felt the same way.

He travelled to Japan the following week but mentioned he was considering returning to my city after his trip in late October (I asked him initially because it will be my birthday week). Unfortunately, he injured his back when he arrived at the airport in Japan. We’ve kept in touch, doing two video calls over the past week. Last night, he told me he wouldn’t be able to come back to Australia due to his back injury, as well as needing to move and visit family as planned.

During our call, we talked about how much we like each other and discussed a bit about the future. I mentioned that I’m open to moving in the future, but he would need to live in Australia for at least six months to see if the relationship can work. He has more flexibility with his schedule.

One concern I have is that he’s still on the dating app. I brought up the idea of exclusive dating, mentioning that it might be too early to discuss. He explained that he just started using the app and wants to get to know as more people as possibly to figure out who is the best one. He doesn’t want to invest one or two years only to find out the relationship isn’t right. He said he needs to be conscious of not getting hurt or hurting me. He’s currently chatting with two other women in San Diego but hasn’t met them yet. He wants to keep his options open there, but he also mentioned he’ll be back in Australia from mid-Dec until Feb to see if it can work between us.

I know long-distance relationships can be challenging, but I really like him and want to give it a try. A good friend of mime advised me to be realistic and keep my options open, but I’m feeling a bit tired of dating. After matching with over 150 guys in three months and ending up with nothing, I’d rather focus on myself—like getting into tennis, dancing, and joining hiking clubs. But on the other hand, I can’t shake the anxiety about getting older & he’s meeting someone else.

**So here are my questions:**

1. It bothers me that he’s still dating someone in his hometown. I’m worried that our strong feelings might fade between now and mid-December when we meet again. I know he’s the only one who knows what he wants, but do you think he’s still on the app because he doesn’t see me as the best match? How can I maintain our strong connection while we’re apart for the next two months? What i could do to change his mind?
2. I’m likely going to take myself off the app. Should I tell him? What impact might that have?
3. He seems very honest, and I really like him, but am I overlooking any red flags due to my lack of experience?

Anyone in the similar situation before? Any other advice would be greatly appreciated. Please don’t judge me—I’m usually not this brave when it comes to relationships.",1,1729146332.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False
1g5kim8,https://www.reddit.com/r/cliobra/comments/1g5kim8/chief_investment_officer_salary_guide_from_entry/,Chief Investment Officer Salary Guide: From Entry Level to Fortune 50,"Let's cut through the noise and talk real numbers.

The wild thing? Some Chief Investment Officers are pulling in more than half a million dollars annually.

But here's what nobody's talking about - there's a massive gap between the top and bottom of this career ladder.

# The Raw Numbers That'll Make Your Head Spin

Hold onto your coffee cup.

The median CIO salary sits at $168,729 per year.

But that's just scratching the surface.

Some entry-level positions start at $107,650 (not too shabby for starting out).

**Here's where it gets interesting** - top dogs in the industry are banking over $568,035 annually.

And if you're playing in the Fortune 50 league? We're talking $250,000+.

# Why Such a Massive Range? Here's the Real Deal

# Experience Is Still King

**Starting out (1-3 years):** $107,650 

**Mid-career (10-19 years):** $164,414 

**Veterans (20+ years):** $182,845

But here's the thing - these numbers are just base salary.

The real money? It's in the total compensation package.

# Location Matters More Than You Think

Working in San Jose vs. working in Midwest?

That could mean a 50% difference in your take-home.

Tech hubs are where the real money flows.

# Company Size: The Bigger, The Better?

Not always, but usually.

Large enterprises = median salary around $196,000 Fortune 50 companies = $250,000+

# The Truth About Market Trends

**Listen to this:** CIO salaries jumped 7% since 2023.

That's not even the crazy part.

They've shot up more than 20% since 2019.

Why?

**Because companies finally realized something crucial:** Good investment leadership = better bottom line.

# Want to Break Into This Field? Here's What Nobody Tells You

# The Smart Path In:

* Start with financial analysis roles
* Get your CFA certification
* Build a track record of successful investment decisions
* Network like your career depends on it (because it does)
* Focus on emerging technologies and ESG investing

# Red Flags to Watch For:

* Companies that don't give CIOs direct access to the board
* Outdated investment strategies
* Limited decision-making authority
* No clear budget for team development

# Why Starting Your Own Investment Firm Might Be Better

Here's the thing about working for someone else:

Your upside is always capped.

# The Alternative Path:

* Start small with a boutique investment advisory firm
* Focus on a specific niche market
* Build your track record
* Scale gradually
* Keep overhead low initially

The best part?

No salary cap.

No office politics.

Complete control over investment strategies.

# Future Outlook: Where This Career Is Heading

The game is changing fast.

AI and machine learning are reshaping investment strategies.

ESG investing is no longer optional.

**But here's the opportunity:** Those who adapt fastest will command the highest salaries.

# Bottom Line

The CIO role isn't just about managing money anymore.

It's about strategic leadership.

Digital transformation.

Global market understanding.

And guess what?

The compensation reflects that.

Whether you're gunning for that corner office or planning to launch your own firm, the investment management field is more lucrative than ever.

**Just remember:** The real wealth isn't in the salary.

It's in building something of your own.",1,1729146310.0,cliobra,0,1.0,False

My wife and I are (mid 30's from Germany) going to visit Shanghai (and China) for the first time ever in November and are very excited to this trip.

We are staying at the ""Crystal Orange Shanghai Sichuan North Road Hotel"" in the Hongkou District (if I get that right) - do you have any recommendation for some good authentic restaurants serving chinese / shanghainese cuisine in that area? Also nice places to drink some coffee would be great.

It would really help us a lot and we would be grateful for any recommendation.

1g5kdkz,https://www.reddit.com/r/DatingApps/comments/1g5kdkz/dating_app_experience_a_bit_weird/,Dating App Experience: A Bit Weird!,"So, I recently got a bit bored and decided to give a dating app a go. I was surprised at how easy it was to get matches, but finding nice people who really fit what I'm looking for has been a bit tricky. I’m really hoping to find a serious relationship and settle down eventually.



Last week, I managed to schedule a meet-up with a guy on Saturday. He works for the government and is 175 cm tall, which is great because I’m 163 cm! He suggested a pancake café (which I absolutely adore), but mentioned it wasn’t available for reservations, so we might have to queue. No worries there!



About 15 minutes before we were meant to meet, he checked the queue and decided he didn’t want to wait. Instead, he suggested a different restaurant just one station away. I was totally fine with that, and it turned out to be a lovely spot as well. We had a nice chat, and when it was time to pay, he suggested splitting the bill. I agreed and paid my half without any fuss.



After our meal, he proposed a walk in a nearby park. While we were strolling, he asked if I usually split the bill with guys I hang out with. I told him I do, especially with people I’m not that interested in, but for those I fancy, I usually let them pay. He then said, “I thought you were Canadian; don’t they always split the bill when dating?” I just giggled and kept quiet.



Then we went to a café, but it was super busy, and there weren’t enough seats. When we finally found one, he plopped down and said, “I’ll sit first, you don’t mind standing for a bit, right? You’re young after all.” I couldn’t help but think, “WTF?” Anyway, after our coffee, we headed back to the park, and he asked me how he could approach me in the future. I explained that I like to take the initiative and approach people myself.



He walked me to the nearby train station, but now I’m left wondering about this guy. What do you all think?",3,1729145673.0,DatingApps,1,1.0,False
