1l0lhlw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1l0lhlw/i_am_exhausted_19m/,I am exhausted. 19M,"Hi! I'm seeking some advice in terms of being entirely fully exhausted. Since pretty much always, I've just been super tired all the time. Not just regular tired from staying up all night, or spending hours working out or doing strenuous activity, I mean waking up tired, and not feeling fully awake for about 90% of the day. Even when I was younger I would take hour naps after elementary school, middleschool, and highschool. All of my teachers have always had nice things to say ahout me, but all of them always mention that I am lethargic, since I used to take naps in pretty much any class I could. Covid was the worst, because I would log onto class, set my alarm and go to bed. On days when we were introducing going back in person, I would skip class to go to the bathrooms and log in online with my phone, pretending like I was sick but still there so I wouldn't lose my attendance. Like I'm not even kidding I would regularly fall asleep sitting in the school bathrooms just so I could feel more rested

I have been getting it looked into, but I've found very little luck. I have tried the usual methods recommended to me, including:
-coffee/energy drinks
- those 5 hour energy shot things
- trying to find the ""right"" amount of hours of sleep for my personal needs (no amount works)
- sleeping until I'm not tired anymore (after 17 hours i decided to ditch that method)
- vitamin b12 
- iron pills
- exercise/little exercise 
- healthy/varying diets
- varying stress levels

and have recently been taking thyroid medication, but after 2 years of no results, I have strayed from this path as well. My blood tests are almost completely normal aside from the slightly abnormal thyroid level. after at least all of these methods, I've been as tired as I was before trying them, if not more. I do have rare days where that feeling of being tired doesn't hit as much, but that's usually for days when I'm too busy or too focused on something to realize how tired i actually have been. I've kind of always been this way of just being exhausted, but after 19 years of having everything i do in all aspects of my life being hindered by just being tired, I am getting to a point

I by no means have no complaints about where I am in life, and am doing considerably well. I've been a tattoo artist for the past year and a half, I have a car, a wonderful partner and am moving out in a couple weeks, but I know I'm not excelling as much as I could be if I wasn't so exhausted (getting chores done, wasting time with 1.5-3 hour naps a day after getting home, procrastinating on projects because I'm just too tired to do good quality work, being absolutely worn out after work because all my energy was used and I can no longer do much else with my day).

If anyone has any advice on what else I can do, that would be great. Going to the doctor hasn't really been useful when my only symptom is just ""consistent and unfixable tiredness"", along with nothing else. If you have any other questions, I'm sure I've forgotten something so feel free to ask. Appreciate any words",1,1748772683.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I’m new to the espresso game and trying to dial in my first setup. I picked a bean I know from work that I enjoy there, thinking it would be a good baseline to get started. But at home, the taste is just not as expected yet.

# Taste

Balanced-ish, but not in a good way: slightly bitter, slightly sour, and missing sweetness. Not undrinkable, but not great

# Setup

* **Machine:** Ascaso Steel PID DUO Plus
* **Grinder:** Ceado Life X, grind size around **2.9**
* **Basket:** Ascaso 18g double basket (Part #5343)
* **Brew Temp:** \~96°C
* **Pressure:** Peaks around 10-11 bar (OPV lets out a bit during shot)

# Beans

* **Roaster:** Martermühle (local German roaster)
* **Blend:** “Espresso Cioccolato” – 60% Arabica, 40% Robusta
* **Roast level:** Medium to medium-dark
* **Roast date:** Fresh (a few days old)
* **Notes:** Supposed to be low-acid and chocolatey

# Recipe

* **Dose:** 18.0 g
* **Yield:** 38.0 g
* **Time:** 26.7 seconds
* **Ratio:** \~1:2.1

# Workflow

1. Weigh 18g beans, grind at 2.9
2. Use dosing ring
3. WDT to distribute
4. Level the puck
5. Tamp with 13kg spring tamper
6. Pull shot – decent looking flow through bottomless portafilter, no major signs of channeling

Without using the WDT, I sometimes had clear channeling, with water splashing past the side of the cup

# The problem

The grind looks really coarse and fluffy – no clumping at all. The shop that sold me the gear mentioned I’d probably land around **2.2** on the Ceado. And indeed, at 2.2 the grounds *look* better (more like what I see at work, where the coffee tastes fine), but then the shot basically chokes and most water exits via the OPV.

So now I’m stuck:

* **2.9**: decent flow, but meh taste
* **2.2**: better-looking grounds, but painfully slow flow and mostly OPV drain

Where should I go from here? Grind even finer and reduce dose? Lower temp? Or am I totally off?

I attached some photos for more details.

so basically getting a job through networking which make sense but what if you don't have someone to network with?

So the trick is to message your network on LinkedIn who have the job you want, asking them professional questions and talking about themselves. by asking them for coffee, and keeping in touch on LinkedIn by sending occasional messages or sharing articles/videos, so maybe when their company has an opening, you’ll get a referral.

I don’t know if it’s cultural differences or what, but this never worked when I tried years ago. I remember sending messages to 60 different people and not hearing anything back.

It makes sense, why would someone take time out of their day to meet a stranger from LinkedIn for coffee? If I were them, I’d have ignored the message too. But this “tip” or technique gets brought up a lot in articles and videos. So I just wanted to ask: has anyone actually done this and succeeded?",1,1748772354.0,jobsearchhacks,0,1.0,False
1l0ldt9,https://www.reddit.com/r/cfs/comments/1l0ldt9/does_rem_sleep_make_you_tireder/,Does REM sleep make you tireder?,"Mild for reference. If I interrupt my sleep to wake up, and then go back to sleep (biphasic sleep), I usually have vivid dreams and always wake up completely exhausted. I feel groggy and miserable and like a train hit me.

But by coincidence this morning I woke up at 5am ish, then at 6 when someone’s alarm went off, then at 7 by muscle memory, then at 8 when someone left the house and I woke up to the door. In other words, I got interrupted before every REM cycle. 

And I’m tired, but not completely exhausted. Like normally if I go back to sleep I physically can’t get out of bed I’m so exhausted. Nothing hurts right now, mentally I feel alert (or as alert as I feel with this syndrome)— the point is, I don’t feel worse than when I went to sleep. I could get out of bed and change my clothes. Hell, I actually have enough energy to go downstairs and make myself a coffee if I wanted one, which is never really an option for me when I feel groggy and awful .

Now I’m curious if REM sleep has something to do with it. I always feel awful after vivid dreams, bad dreams and nightmares are worse, but even if I don’t have any, biphasic sleep always makes me feel horrible. 

Does anyone else have similar experiences? Could this be worth investigating (I let myself sleep normally for several hours and then set myself hourly alarms for the other partof the night)?? 

Thanks

1l0lcw6,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1l0lcw6/is_he_cheap_or_am_i_being_picky/,Is he cheap or am I being picky?,"Hi guys, would appreciate some advice. I’m a 29 year old girl who recently went on a few dates with a 30 year old guy.

TLDR: he wanted to split dates that have cost between £15 to £30 total. I don’t believe this is appropriate. What to do? 

Here’s what happened:

We met when I was walking home from the gym one afternoon and he approached me saying ‘sorry to disturb you, I don’t want to creep you out but just want to say you look really pretty today’. I felt his approach was sincere and we had a little chat walking some of the way together. He was also coming from a workout session and looked to be in pretty good shape, taller than me and kind face and demeanour.

We exchanged numbers and immediately chatted that evening on the phone, which I don’t normally enjoy but found the convo easygoing and then met for a coffee the next morning and walk in our local area. A few days later we went to a local fair and again the convo has been nice.

But I’m feeling a little apprehensive because of the following:

- every time we’ve been out he’s hung back when it came to paying as if he’s expecting me to pick up the bill or offer to split it. I absolutely do not believe in splitting the bill on the first date - especially when the first date is a chill coffee and sandwich in a local park. It cost a total of like £16. I would not even ask a friend to split that with me if I invited them let alone a romantic partner. So after the cafe I ordered and just kept silent then he payed. 

- when we went to the fair we got to the ticket booth and same thing, a bit of awkward silent so I said ‘I’ll get the entrance tickets you get the games tokens’. He said sure. But then when we got there he said ‘let’s get some food later and you can get that’ or something along those lines. The entrance fee was £4 total and the tokens which he got were £20 so he was trying to recoup the £16 more he spent on tokens by saying I can get the food after.

- after the fair date we left and were walking in the park and I said I was hungry. He hadn’t planned anywhere to go eat after so I recommended some places but he was uming and ahing before suggesting we get a bottle of wine and go back to my place. I told him in no world would I bring a guy I’ve only know for less than a week to my apartment. He lives at home with his family still meanwhile I own my apartment and live alone. 

 -He’s also bald which I never knew. When I first met him he had a hat on, and also again at breakfast. But at the fair he had to take his hat off and he is bald as bald can be. He has a good tall phsyique and handsome face so I wouldn’t write him off for his baldness but it’s worth noting. 

In other words I’m starting to feel like he’s cheap and it’s turning me off. I knew I earned more than him and have a more luxurious social life than him when we met, I could just tell by some of the things he said (he doesn’t know what an aperol spritz is, he talked about his new job as a facilities manager like it was super impressive and exciting. In my current job I’m a director of a tech company and earn between 6-10k per month after tax). 

All of that genuinely didn’t matter to me because I care about a guys character above all which he seems to have, in terms or his personality and communication skills. But I hate stingy behaviour. 

Whether you make 1k or 10k a month there’s no need to be cheap as a man and make a girl split anything before she’s your girlfriend. I don’t need him to take me anywhere fancy right now (although eventually I will need him to plan more special dates than walks coffees and fairs) but where he does choose to take me, he needs to step up and cover the cost. I’m just really concerned that overtime I will resent this part of him especially because I’m used to spending way more money and earning more money.

Any advice would be appreciated!

My own background is, I've been making pourovers for about a year, year & a half, but I alternate bet. coffee and tea a lot, so haven't done a ton of experiments to really dial in my preferences.

I'm in Sapporo (first time!) for a week and I decided to seek out some of the well rated pourover coffee places and try them out. I know Japan has a very good drip coffee culture, and I have to say, I'm I'm already very impressed.

Stop one: Oniyanma Coffee and Beer. I told them I mostly use Ethiopian and Kenyan beans at home, and enjoy a lot of fruity notes in my coffee. They recommended, and I ordered a pourover using Colombian peach co-fermented bean. Served in a wine glass!

[Colombia Los Patios bean, pourover, served in a wine glass](https://preview.redd.it/fa52nwjdda4f1.jpg?width=3472&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b291bb090bb49c724c02e83843c81ef142aa9361)

The peach aroma hit very hard when I first took a sniff. I've never had infused beans in a pourover before, but I really like it. Very light, good fruity notes, decent acidity. They weren't terribly busy so I asked how they made their pourovers, and they provided the recipe (sorry for the Japanese).

15g of coffee, 40g bloom for about 40s, then 100g > 180g > 240g, timing is as each pour finishes dripping. Water temp was, I think 90C? After the bloom, the first two pours are in a spiral, last is a gentle pour into the middle.

And in case you're curious what else they offer...

Deadpool gets absorbed halfway into Ultradead’s mass but slices himself free mid-absorption, leaving chunks behind.

DEADPOOL (CONT’D, exhausted)
Seriously… I feel like a human glow stick right now.

SPIDER-MAN
Wade! I have an idea!

DEADPOOL
No more “ideas,” Peter! The last one involved me ripping my skin off like a demented piñata!

SPIDER-MAN
We have to overload the feedback loop again — but this time, from the inside!

DEADPOOL
Inside?! You mean inside-inside? Like… butt-inside?

SPIDER-MAN (grossed out)
No! I mean molecular core level inside!

DEADPOOL (mocking)
Oh, sure. Use big science words to avoid saying “butt-inside.” Coward.

THE FINAL GAMBIT

Deadpool voluntarily lets Ultradead absorb him again. Inside, it’s a swirling, horrific metal-flesh fusion.

ULTRADEAD (V.O.)
I AM YOU. YOU ARE ME. WE ARE PERFECTION.

DEADPOOL (inside core, whispering)
You really don’t know who you’re dealing with, do you?
He pulls out a small detonator.

DEADPOOL (CONT’D, to camera)
Remember kids: always swallow explosives. Just in case.

He presses the detonator. A regenerative-overload bomb triggers inside Ultradead’s core. The entire creature starts glitching, imploding violently.

ULTRADEAD (screaming, glitching)
ERRRRORRRR…. CAN’T… STABILIZE…

Ultradead explodes in a massive red and silver fireball.

EXT. SMOKING CRATER — DAWN

Spider-Man pulls a half-charred Deadpool from the rubble.

SPIDER-MAN
You okay?

DEADPOOL (wheezing, half burnt)
I’ve been worse…
(pause)
Also, you’re now legally my godfather if I ever create more fleshbots.

SPIDER-MAN (groaning)
Please don’t ever say that again.

MID-CREDIT SCENE

Deadpool sits in a SHIELD medical bay watching Netflix.

DEADPOOL (to camera)
Well, we nuked the bastard. For now. But hey, multiverse rules say he could come back any time! Isn’t franchise filmmaking fun?

POST-CREDIT SCENE — THE MASTERMIND REVEALED

Inside a dark laboratory, filled with corrupted Stark tech, shadowy figures watch surveillance footage of Ultradead’s destruction.

A voice speaks from the shadows — cold, calculating, and familiar:

MISTER SINISTER (V.O.)
Fascinating. The fusion worked… briefly. But now… we refine the experiment.

A pale face with glowing red eyes steps into view. It’s Mister Sinister, surrounded by mutant tech and cloned tissue.

MISTER SINISTER (CONT’D)
Deadpool was merely the prototype. The real Chaosverse begins… now.

He turns to a cloning tank. Inside floats a twisted, half-mutant version of Deadpool…

CUT TO BLACK.

My primary objective is to delineate, by means of unnecessarily exhaustive detail, the psychophysiological impact of unpredictable auditory stimuli and frequent cognitive interruptions, which are seemingly trivial in isolation, yet cumulatively catastrophic.

To commence, let's categorize the stimuli. The chief culprits involve a series of unforeseen auditory disruptions: the erratic tapping of my coworker’s keyboard (hereby dubbed QWERTY Interference Pattern A), intermittent sniffling (Respiratory Sound Series), and the sporadic verbal projections over a Bluetooth headset (Accidental Acoustic Overflows). Each occurrence, when examined microscopically, appears to exert approximately 3.8 neural interference units (NIUs), a hypothetical but methodologically consistent measure I've devised. 

A critical component of the irritation progression model hinges on predictability, or the lack thereof. Each unexpected auditory event augments an underlying sensation of psychic tension, reflected measurably in a statistically significant increase in both sub-vocal tension and a slight elevation in basal heart rate, here quantified as 5 beats per minute per decibel above baseline auditory threshold.

The cumulative impact is manifest in my declining task efficiency, periodically diminished by up to 47% during peak interference exposure periods, notably correlating with synchronous coffee machine noises. The resultant state can be metaphorically compared to a heavily taxed central processing unit, struggling with parallel processing demands, and exhibiting subsequent risk of operational latency.

All the while, an inner narrative of rationalization and reluctant humor prevails, musing silently over the necessity of a silent office revolution, or perhaps the nightly construction of a personal soundproof bubble. Thus, the embodied critique: why must the pursuit of productivity come at the sacrifice of sonic serenity?

Though my assertions may lack strict empirical validation, they serve as an earnest attempt to integrate meticulous observation with a dash of absurdly formalized emotional discourse. I hazard perhaps an ironic enjoyment in the very exercise of overexplaining this nuanced tapestry of frustration, coupled with the sober realization that, in doing so, I afford myself a modicum of control over the uncontrollable.",6,1748771887.0,feelingsUnderMicrosco,0,1.0,False

too full of needless things

and possibilities.

The car doors snapped shut

and the engine rumbled,

cold and complaining,

in the frostbit night.

We shivered and stopped

at that little corner store.

(You remember the one

that had cinnamon bears

and cheap cigarettes?)

You filled the gas tank

with chattering teeth,

as I chugged enough coffee

that my blood grew warm again.

\_

You, my side seat DJ,

drumming on the dashboard

as we sang loudly off key

to all our favorite songs.

Racing towards the horizon,

our eyes were hungry then

for places we'd never seen.

But after a long while,

the music grew sad, and so did we.

Our hoarse voices whispering secrets.

I remember your tears,

the salt in your voice,

when you told me

how much you hated that place.

The home that almost broke you,

and the boy that did.  
\-

The car grew quieter then,

as you were rocked to sleep.

As I cruised these country curves

in the shadows of mountain valleys,

I watched the land become a stranger to me.

My foot grew heavy on the pedal

urging my chariot to hurry.

I had a date at dawn,

and I was eager to be on time.

I could smell the ocean

long before she showed herself.

The billboards greeted us

with letters that curved like waves.

The sand crunched under the tires

as the car stuttered to sleep

in the empty parking lot.  
\_

I looked over just in time

to see you open your eyes,

and drink in the sun.

It wasn't my first sunrise,

but I can't remember another

before or after it.

We stumbled out

stiff and clumsy towards the sea.

The sky and water lovers,

perfect mirrors of each other.

We threw off our shoes

to dance in the tide,

and for a time, all we knew was

this wild and wonderful

laughter and surrender

at the edge of the world.  
\_

Twenty years later,

I returned to that place.

My memory hazy but hopeful

that the azure tide

could enchant me once again.

I walked in the soft warm sand

to the chorus of seagulls,

and the hush of the swell.

My eyes searched the horizon,

but not a single passerby

wore your soft smile

or ocean eyes.

Perhaps my heart was not

love drunk on the sea,

but yearning for a distant memory

of you and me.

1l0l2rz,https://youtu.be/MR6BX2-6qDY,3 Very Scary TRUE Foggy Night Horror Stories,"# ""The Fog Was Watching"":

I’d been at the club for hours, dancing with friends, the bass thumping through my chest. It was late, probably 4:30 a.m., and my feet ached in my heels. The city was quiet when I stepped outside, the air heavy, the streetlights barely cutting through the thick fog. It wrapped around everything, muffling sounds, making the world feel small and strange. I could smell damp asphalt and the faint musty scent of leaves piled in the gutters. My phone was down to 5% battery, just enough to call a taxi. I stood under a flickering streetlamp, shivering in my thin jacket, waiting for the car to pull up.The taxi driver was older, with a tired face and a heavy accent. He kept glancing at his GPS, muttering about the fog messing with the signal. “Can’t get through your street,” he said, pulling over at the corner of my block. “Too narrow, too much fog. You walk from here, okay?” I hesitated, peering out the window. The fog was so dense I could barely see the stop sign ten feet away. But I was exhausted, and home was only a few blocks. “Sure,” I said, forcing a smile as I paid him. I stepped out, the cold biting my legs, and the taxi’s taillights vanished into the haze before I could blink.My heels clicked on the pavement, the sound sharp in the silence. The fog seemed to swallow everything else—no cars, no voices, just me and the faint glow of streetlights, their light smudged into soft halos. My purse swung against my hip, and I tucked my hands into my pockets, trying to keep warm. The street felt different, like it wasn’t my street anymore. Every step echoed in my head, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that I wasn’t alone. I told myself it was just the fog playing tricks, making shadows move where there were none. But my heart was already beating faster, a steady thump I could feel in my throat.I was halfway down the block when I heard it—a low hum, like an engine idling. I glanced back, and through the fog, I saw two faint headlights, moving slow. Too slow. My stomach twisted, a cold knot forming. I kept walking, faster now, my heels clicking louder, almost frantic. The car crept closer, tires crunching on the wet road, the sound deliberate, like it was following me. I moved to the edge of the sidewalk, pressing myself against the curb, hoping it would pass. It didn’t. The car stopped right beside me, the window rolling down with a soft whir.“Hey, excuse me,” a man’s voice called out, calm and smooth, like he was asking for the time. I turned my head just enough to see him—a guy, maybe in his thirties, leaning out the window of a dark sedan. The dashboard light cast shadows across his face, hiding his eyes, but I could see his jaw, stubbled and sharp. “Do you know where Gian Galeazzo Street is?” he asked, his voice almost too friendly.I swallowed, my mouth dry as sand. Something about him felt wrong, like the fog was hiding more than just the street. “Uh, I’m not sure,” I said, my voice barely above a whisper. I pointed vaguely to the left. “Maybe that way? I don’t know.” I took a step back, my heel catching on a crack in the sidewalk. I steadied myself, clutching my purse tighter.He tilted his head, his lips curling into a smile that didn’t reach the shadows where his eyes should be. “You sure? You look like you live around here.” He paused, leaning closer to the window. “Pretty girl like you, walking all alone. You know this place, right?”My heart slammed against my ribs. I forced a nod, trying to keep my voice steady. “Yeah, I… I think it’s that way,” I said, pointing again, my hand shaking. I started walking, faster now, my heels loud against the pavement. The fog seemed to close in, pressing against my skin, making every breath feel heavy. I heard the car move, the engine humming as it rolled forward, keeping pace with me.“Come on, don’t be shy,” he called out, his voice louder now, teasing. “I’m just lost. Help me out. Why don’t you get in? We can find it together.” The words were light, but they felt like a trap, each one tightening the knot in my stomach.“No, I’m good,” I said, my voice cracking. I kept my eyes forward, scanning for the outline of my apartment building. It had to be close—two more blocks, maybe three. The fog made it hard to tell. My hands were trembling now, and I shoved them deeper into my pockets, gripping my dead phone like it could save me. The car stayed with me, its headlights cutting through the fog, casting my shadow ahead, long and distorted.“You’re scared, aren’t you?” he said, his tone shifting, lower, almost amused. “No need for that. I’m just being friendly. It’s not safe out here, you know. Not for someone like you.” He paused, and I heard the creak of his seat as he leaned closer to the window. “Come on, get in. I’ll take you home.”I stopped, my breath hitching. My legs felt like they’d buckle, but I forced myself to stand tall. “Please, leave me alone,” I said, louder now, my voice shaking but firm. I turned to face him, just for a second, and saw that smile again, wider now, like he was enjoying this. My skin crawled, and I started walking again, faster, almost running, my heels slipping on the wet pavement.He laughed, a low, guttural sound that echoed in the fog. “You’re making this harder than it needs to be,” he said, the car rolling forward again, keeping pace. “I just want to talk. Come closer. I don’t bite.” His voice was softer now, but it wasn’t comforting—it was a lure, pulling me toward something dark.I didn’t answer. I couldn’t. My throat was tight, my chest burning with every breath. The fog was everywhere, hiding the street signs, the buildings, everything but the sound of his engine. I glanced back, and the car was closer now, its headlights blinding, like eyes staring through the haze. I broke into a run, my purse bouncing against my side, my heels clacking so loud I thought the whole city could hear me. The car sped up, pulling ahead, then stopped, blocking the sidewalk. I skidded to a halt, my heart pounding so hard I thought it would burst.The fog swirled around the car, making it look like a shadow itself. I couldn’t see him clearly, but I felt his stare, heavy and unyielding. “What do you want?” I whispered, my voice barely audible. I backed up, my heels scraping the pavement, my eyes darting for a way out. The parked cars on my right trapped me against the curb, and the street was too open, too exposed.He leaned out the window, his voice low and cold. “Just a little fun,” he said. “Get in. It’ll be quick.” The words hit me like a punch, stealing my breath. My hands shook as I clutched my purse, my mind screaming at me to move, to run, to do something. But the fog held me there, heavy and suffocating, like it was part of him.Then I heard it—another engine, faint at first, growing louder. Headlights flashed through the fog behind his car, another vehicle coming down the street. Its horn blared, sharp and angry, shattering the silence. The man cursed, his head snapping toward the approaching car. For a moment, he looked at me, his face unreadable in the dim light. Then he slammed his foot on the gas, the sedan lurching forward, tires screeching as it disappeared into the fog.The other car passed by, its driver unaware, just a blur of red taillights fading into the haze. I didn’t wait. I ran, my heels slipping, my breath coming in gasps. The fog seemed to chase me, curling around my legs, but I kept going, my eyes locked on the faint outline of my apartment building. It was there, just ahead, the glass door reflecting a sliver of streetlight. I fumbled for my keys, my hands shaking so badly I dropped them. They clattered on the pavement, and I scrambled to pick them up, my fingers numb, my heart racing. I dropped them again, a sob catching in my throat, but I finally got them, jamming the key into the lock.I stumbled inside, slamming the door shut, my hands trembling as I turned every bolt, checked every lock. The fog pressed against the windows, thick and gray, hiding the street outside. I stood there, back against the door, listening, my breath loud in the quiet. Was he out there? Had he followed me? Every creak in the building, every distant hum of a car, made my stomach lurch. I slid to the floor, my knees weak, and clutched my phone, now charging by the couch. I didn’t move for hours, just sat there, watching the windows, waiting for a shadow to appear.I called the police the next morning, my voice still shaky as I told them everything. The fog, the car, the man’s voice. They asked for details—his face, his license plate—but the fog had hidden it all. They said they’d patrol the area, but I knew he was gone, melted into the night like the fog itself. I couldn’t stop checking the locks, the windows, every night for weeks. I got a new phone, kept it charged, kept a whistle in my purse. I never walked home alone again, not after that. Even now, when the fog rolls in, I feel it—the cold, the silence, the eyes watching from the dark. It’s like the fog knows, like it’s waiting for me to step outside again, to finish what he started.

  


# ""Fifteen Feet Away"":

I was bone-tired, dragging myself through the end of a double shift at the diner. The kind of tired where your eyes burn and your legs feel like they’re made of lead. It was well past midnight, and I just wanted to get home, crawl into bed, and forget the smell of greasy burgers and burnt coffee. My old pickup truck rattled along the rural road I’d driven a thousand times, a narrow stretch of asphalt that twisted through dense woods. The trees loomed tall on both sides, their branches knitting together overhead, blocking out the stars. My radio was on, spitting out a staticky country tune, but I wasn’t really listening. I just needed the noise to keep me awake.About ten miles from home, my headlights caught something up ahead—a car parked on the shoulder, its hazard lights pulsing weakly, like a dying heartbeat. It was an older sedan, gray and battered, with a dented fender and a cracked taillight. I slowed down, my hands tightening on the steering wheel. Out here, where cell service was a cruel joke, a breakdown could leave you stranded for hours. I wasn’t the type to just drive by. Not that I’m some saint—I just knew what it felt like to be stuck, alone, with nobody coming to help.I pulled over behind the sedan, leaving a good gap between us, and kept my engine running. My headlights bathed the car in a harsh white glow, making the scratches on its paint stand out like claw marks. I sat there for a second, debating. Something about the scene felt off, but I couldn’t put my finger on it. The car’s driver-side door was wide open, swinging slightly, like someone had just stepped out. I scanned the road ahead and the trees to either side, but there was nothing—no movement, no sound, just the faint chirp of crickets and the hum of my truck.I cut the engine but left the headlights on, grabbing the small canister of pepper spray I kept in my jacket pocket. Working late nights at the diner had taught me to be cautious. I stepped out, my boots crunching on the gravel, and the air hit me—cool, thick, like it was pressing against my skin. “Hello?” I called, my voice sounding thinner than I meant it to. No answer. I took a few steps toward the sedan, my heart picking up speed. The car looked empty, but the keys were still in the ignition, glinting faintly. A Styrofoam coffee cup sat in the center console, half-full, with lipstick smudged on the rim. A worn denim jacket was slung over the passenger seat, one sleeve dangling like it had been tossed there in a hurry.I leaned in a little, not touching anything, just trying to see if there was a phone or a wallet—something to tell me who this car belonged to. That’s when I heard it: a sharp snap, like a branch breaking underfoot, from the trees to my right. I jerked upright, my pulse hammering in my throat. “Hey, anyone out there?” I called, louder this time, my voice echoing into the dark. Nothing. Just the rustle of leaves, faint and teasing. I told myself it was probably a raccoon or a deer, but my hand tightened around the pepper spray anyway.Then I saw him. A figure stepped out from the tree line, maybe twenty feet away, where the shadows were thickest. He was tall, lanky, wearing a dark hoodie that hung loose on his frame. The hood was up, casting his face in shadow, but I could feel him looking at me. My stomach twisted, and I took a step back toward my truck. He didn’t move, just stood there, hands shoved in his pockets, his posture too still, too deliberate.“Is this your car?” I asked, trying to keep my voice steady, like this was just a normal conversation. “You okay?”He didn’t answer right away. He tilted his head, like he was studying me, and the silence stretched out so long I thought he hadn’t heard me. “Yeah,” he said finally, his voice low and smooth, almost too calm. “Car broke down. You got a phone I could use?”Something about the way he said it made my skin prickle. It wasn’t desperate or panicked, like you’d expect from someone stranded in the middle of nowhere. It was flat, like he was reading a script. “I can call someone for you,” I said, keeping my distance, my hand still in my pocket. “Tow truck, maybe? What’s wrong with it?”He took a step forward, just one, and I felt my muscles tense. “Battery’s dead,” he said. “You got jumper cables?”I nodded, even though every instinct screamed at me to get back in my truck and floor it. “Yeah, I got some. Hang on.” I turned and walked to my truck, moving slow, like I was trying not to spook a wild animal. I could feel his eyes on me, heavy and unblinking. I popped the hood and rummaged in the toolbox in the truck bed, pulling out the jumper cables. My hands were shaking, and I fumbled with the cables, the metal clinking too loudly in the quiet.When I turned back, he was closer—way closer than he should’ve been. He was standing by his car’s hood now, maybe ten feet away, and I hadn’t heard him move at all. My breath caught in my throat. “Whoa, you’re quick,” I said, forcing a laugh that sounded hollow even to me. He didn’t smile, just nodded toward his car.“Pop the hood for me?” he asked, his voice still calm, but there was an edge to it now, like he was testing me.I hesitated, my heart pounding so hard I thought it might burst. I didn’t want to get any closer, but I didn’t want to turn my back on him either. “Sure,” I said, stepping toward the sedan. I leaned into the driver’s side, my eyes flicking between him and the car. The air inside smelled sharp, like gasoline mixed with something metallic, almost like blood, but I told myself I was imagining it. I found the hood release under the dashboard and pulled it, hearing the click as the hood unlatched. He lifted it, and I stepped back fast, clutching the jumper cables like they were a lifeline.“You don’t have to stick around,” he said, not looking at me as he leaned over the battery. “I can handle it.”I should’ve listened. I should’ve just dropped the cables and run. But I didn’t. “It’s fine,” I said, my voice tighter than I wanted. “I’ll wait till you’re good to go.”He didn’t say anything, just started hooking up the cables, his movements slow and deliberate. I stood by my truck, watching him, my pulse racing. The road was dead silent—no cars, no headlights, just the two of us and the endless stretch of trees. I kept glancing at the woods, half-expecting someone else to step out, like this was some kind of trap. That’s when I noticed the scratches on his car’s hood—deep, jagged lines, like someone had dragged a knife across the metal in a frenzy. My stomach dropped, and I felt a cold sweat break out on my neck.“You live around here?” he asked suddenly, his hands still on the battery, his head turned slightly toward me.“Yeah, not far,” I said, keeping it vague. I didn’t like the way he asked, like he was fishing for something. “You?”“Passing through,” he said, his voice low. He straightened up then and looked at me, and for the first time, I saw his eyes. They were dark, almost black, and they didn’t catch the light from my headlights. It was like looking into a void. “You always stop for strangers?” he asked, his lips curling into a faint smile that made my blood run cold.I forced a shrug, my fingers tightening around the pepper spray in my pocket. “If they look like they need help,” I said, trying to sound casual, but my voice was shaking now.His smile widened, but it wasn’t friendly. It was the kind of smile that made you want to bolt. “That’s real kind of you,” he said. “Not a lot of people like that anymore. Most people just drive by.”I didn’t answer. My mouth was dry, and my legs felt like they might give out. He finished hooking up the cables and nodded toward my truck. “Start her up,” he said.I walked to my driver’s side, my boots loud against the gravel. Every step felt like it took forever, like I was moving through quicksand. I climbed in, locked the doors, and turned the key. My engine roared to life, the sound cutting through the silence. I glanced at his car, expecting him to try starting it, but he didn’t. He just stood there, right by his open hood, staring at me through my windshield. His hands were back in his pockets, and he wasn’t moving.“Hey, you gonna try it?” I called through the window, my voice muffled. I gripped the steering wheel, my knuckles white.He didn’t answer. He took a step toward my truck, then another, slow and deliberate, like a predator stalking prey. My heart slammed against my ribs, and I revved the engine, hoping the noise would make him back off. It didn’t. He kept coming, his head tilted slightly, that awful smile still on his face.“Stay back!” I shouted, my voice cracking. I fumbled for the pepper spray and held it up, my hand shaking so bad I could barely aim it. He stopped, maybe fifteen feet away, and just stood there, staring. Then he laughed—a low, quiet laugh that made my skin crawl.“You’re smart,” he said, his voice soft but carrying over the rumble of my engine. “Most people aren’t.”I didn’t wait to hear more. I threw the truck into drive and floored it, the jumper cables still hooked to his car, yanking free with a loud snap as I peeled out. Gravel sprayed behind me, and in my rearview mirror, I saw him standing in the middle of the road, his figure shrinking as I sped away. He didn’t chase me, didn’t move, just watched me go until the darkness swallowed him whole.I didn’t stop driving until I reached my house, my hands trembling so bad I could barely get the key in the lock. I bolted every door, checked every window, and sat on my couch with a kitchen knife clutched in my hands until the sun came up. I didn’t sleep, didn’t even try. Every creak in the house made me jump, every shadow looked like him.The next morning, I called the sheriff’s office and told them about the car. They found it right where I’d left it, still on the shoulder, but the guy was gone. No registration, no fingerprints, just the sedan with those knife scratches on the hood and a trunk full of ropes, duct tape, and a folded tarp. They asked me a lot of questions, took my statement, but they never found him. They said he might’ve been a drifter, someone passing through, but the way they looked at me told me they thought I’d dodged something bad.I still drive that road to work sometimes. I don’t have a choice—it’s the only way to the diner. But I don’t stop anymore, not for anyone. Every time I pass that spot, I see those scratches in my mind, and I wonder how close I came to not making it home.

  


# ""The Smog Follows"":

I stepped out of St. Thomas’ Hospital, my body aching from a twelve-hour shift. The air hit me like a wall, thick and bitter, burning my nose with every breath. It was December 1952, and London was suffocating. The hospital had been a nightmare—wards overflowing with patients, their coughs echoing down the halls, some gasping for air that wouldn’t come. Old men, young mothers, even children, their faces gray from the smog. I’d spent the night holding hands, fetching water, and praying we wouldn’t lose another. My white nurse’s cap was still pinned to my hair, my coat buttoned tight over my uniform, but it did little to block the sharp smell of coal smoke. I clutched my leather bag, its strap worn from years of use, and started the long walk home.The streets were eerily still. No buses ran, their schedules abandoned days ago. Cars sat like ghosts along the road, their headlights dim, useless against the haze. I could barely see the pavement under my feet, and the streetlamps were just faint smudges of light, swallowed by the fog. My flat was a mile away in Lambeth, a walk I’d done a hundred times, but tonight felt different. The city was too quiet, the usual hum of voices and traffic muffled, like the world was wrapped in cotton. I pulled my scarf up over my mouth, the wool scratching my chin, and kept my eyes on the ground, counting my steps to stay calm.I passed a newsstand, its papers unsold, the headlines smudged and unreadable. A man in a flat cap stood nearby, coughing into a handkerchief, his eyes red and watery. “Careful out there, love,” he rasped, his voice barely carrying. “It’s not safe tonight.” I nodded, forcing a small smile, but his words stuck with me. I’d heard whispers at the hospital—stories of muggings, people grabbed in the fog, their cries lost in the haze. I shook my head, telling myself to focus. Just get home.A few minutes later, I heard it—a soft crunch behind me, like boots on gravel. I froze, my heart stuttering. The sound stopped too. I turned, squinting into the fog, but there was nothing, just a wall of gray. My breath came faster, puffing out in clouds that mixed with the haze. “It’s nothing,” I whispered, my voice trembling. I started walking again, faster this time, my shoes clicking on the cobblestones. The footsteps started again, slow and steady, matching my pace. I glanced back, and this time, I saw a shadow—a tall figure, blurred, maybe twenty feet away. My stomach twisted, and I tightened my grip on my bag, the metal clasp cold against my palm.I turned down a side street, hoping to lose them. The road was narrow, lined with dark shopfronts, their windows boarded or empty. My scarf slipped, and the air stung my lungs, sharp and sour. The footsteps followed, closer now, deliberate. I could hear the faint rustle of a coat, the heavy tread of boots. My heart pounded so loud I was sure they could hear it. I stopped under a flickering streetlamp, its light barely cutting through the fog, and called out, “Who’s there?” My voice cracked, echoing faintly before the haze swallowed it. No answer, just the steady crunch of footsteps.I kept moving, my legs shaky, my eyes darting for landmarks—a pub sign, a postbox, anything to tell me where I was. But the fog hid everything, turning familiar streets into a maze. I passed an alley, the smell of damp brick and rotting rubbish hitting me. The footsteps were louder now, closer, maybe ten feet behind. I broke into a run, my bag bouncing against my hip, my nurse’s shoes slipping on the wet stones. I turned another corner, then another, my breath burning, my chest tight. The footsteps kept coming, faster now, relentless.I stopped, gasping, and realized I’d made a mistake. The street ended in a high brick wall, an alley I didn’t know. My heart sank. I pressed myself against the cold bricks, my hands trembling, my scarf damp with sweat. The footsteps slowed, then stopped. I held my breath, listening, praying they’d gone. Then, through the fog, a figure appeared—a man, tall, in a long dark coat and a hat pulled low. He stood at the alley’s mouth, maybe fifteen feet away, his face hidden in shadow. I could feel his eyes on me, heavy, unblinking.“Please,” I said, my voice barely a whisper. “I don’t have anything. Just let me go.” My fingers fumbled with my bag, searching for something, anything—a pen, a bandage roll, anything to use as a weapon. The man didn’t move, just stood there, watching. My legs felt like jelly, but I forced myself to stand straighter, to look braver than I felt.He took a step forward, his boots scraping the ground. “You’re out late,” he said, his voice low, rough, like gravel. “Not safe for a girl like you.”I swallowed hard, my throat dry. “I’m a nurse,” I said, louder now, trying to keep my voice steady. “I’m just going home. I don’t want trouble.”He laughed, a short, sharp sound that made my skin crawl. “Trouble finds you in this fog,” he said, taking another step. His hand moved to his coat pocket, and I saw a glint—metal, maybe a knife. My heart stopped. I’d heard stories at the hospital, nurses whispering about attacks, people disappearing in the smog. I thought of the man at the newsstand, his warning ringing in my ears.“What do you want?” I asked, my voice shaking. I backed up until my shoulders hit the wall, the bricks cold through my coat. My hands gripped my bag tighter, my mind racing. The alley was a trap, but there was a narrow gap to his right, a sliver of space between him and the wall. If I could just get past him.“Don’t want much,” he said, stepping closer. “Just what you’ve got.” His hand was still in his pocket, and he tilted his head, like he was sizing me up. I could smell him now—cigarette smoke, sweat, and something sharp, like metal.I took a deep breath, my chest aching. “I don’t have money,” I said, holding my bag out like a shield. “Just bandages, medical stuff. Please, let me go.”He didn’t answer, just kept coming, slow and deliberate. My eyes darted to the gap again. It was my only chance. I waited until he was close, maybe five feet away, then threw my bag at him with all my strength. It hit his chest, papers and bandages spilling out, and he stumbled, cursing. I bolted for the gap, my shoulder scraping the wall, my coat tearing on a jagged brick. I didn’t look back, just ran, my lungs screaming, my feet slipping on the slick ground.The footsteps started again, heavy, chasing me. I turned corners blindly, the fog blurring everything. My scarf fell, tangling around my neck, but I didn’t stop to fix it. I passed a shuttered bakery, a broken bicycle leaning against a wall, but no people, no help. The fog seemed to press in, muffling my gasps, making every shadow look like him. My legs burned, but I kept running, my eyes scanning for anything familiar.Then I saw it—a faint glow ahead, like a beacon. A police station, its windows barely visible, the sign swinging faintly above the door. I stumbled toward it, my hands shaking as I pounded on the wood. “Help! Please, someone!” I shouted, my voice hoarse.The door opened, and a constable peered out, his face pale, his eyes tired. “What’s happened?” he asked, pulling me inside. The station was warm, smelling of tea and damp wool, but I couldn’t stop shaking.“There’s a man,” I gasped, clutching my torn coat. “He followed me, in the fog. He had a knife, I think. In an alley, back there.”The constable’s face tightened. “Stay here,” he said, grabbing his torch and calling to another officer. “Show us where.”I shook my head, my knees weak. “I don’t know where it was. I got lost. It was a dead end, a brick wall.” My voice broke, and I sank into a wooden chair, the station’s gaslight flickering above me.The two officers stepped outside, their torches cutting weak beams into the fog. I waited, my hands clasped tight, my eyes fixed on the door. Minutes dragged by, each one heavier than the last. When they returned, their faces were grim. “No one out there now,” the first constable said, brushing damp from his coat. “Fog’s too thick to see much. We found your bag, though.” He held it up, the leather scuffed, papers missing.I nodded, my throat too tight to speak. They let me stay in the station, gave me a cup of tea that burned my tongue but warmed my hands. I sat there until dawn, when the fog began to thin, revealing the gray outline of the city. The constables walked me home, their boots loud on the quiet streets. My flat was cold, the windows streaked with soot, but I locked the door and checked it twice.I never saw the man again, but I couldn’t shake him. Every creak in the floor, every shadow outside my window, brought him back—his low laugh, the glint in his hand, the way the fog hid him. I stopped walking alone at night, taking shifts only when I could get a ride. The smog lifted after a few days, but it left something behind in me—a fear that lingered, sharp and cold, like the memory of that alley wall against my back.",1,1748771003.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

1l0l1o3,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1l0l1o3/new_beginnings/,New Beginnings?,"Just stumbled on this thread while being decaf curious and, wow. I didn't know there was such a big community of people trying to get off caffeine. Although, I shouldn't be surprised as I'm a recovering alcoholic/nicotine user, haha. My initial question was wondering about using caffeine only on the weekends, but after reading some of these posts I'm thinking about just giving it up for good. 

I drink about 2 cups of coffee in the mornings before work M-F and the weekends I'll add a Monster Zero an hour or two later. I've also recently started bringing zero sugar sodas to work with caffeine as a little ""boost"" with my 11am lunch. My biggest rule has been no energy drinks during the week, and absolutely no caffeine past noon. I've been that way for years. My initial reason for wanting to give up coffee during the week is to save me some time in the morning. I prep my coffee at night but when I start drinking it I sit for like 10-20 minutes drinking it and scrolling through my phone. It's my morning ritual. I'd much rather get up, drink some water and use that time better. The better sleep and energy was just going to be a plus. But now, I'm seeing people saying the constant back and forth of withdrawal is just not worth it, and me being someone who was a chronic relapser and ""weekend warrior"" with alcohol, that's something I know all too well. I don't do well with moderation and I'm probably not even aware of how much caffeine is affecting me so I guess I'm just gonna test it out and see what happens. 

Unfortunately, I do love the taste of coffee, especially with my favorite creamer. I love the warmth it brings me in the morning, I love the ritual of grabbing one of my favorite mugs and pouring myself a cup. I also REALLY love the Monster flavor ""Strawberry Dreams"", it's my absolute favorite. I love the flavor, and the way it burns my throat going down. I've been trying to find a zero caffeine drink with a similar taste plus carbonation for that bite but have not found anything yet. 


I'm nervous but excited to start this journey. Once I give up the caffeine it will just be 100% me, no alcohol, nicotine, drugs, caffeine. My boyfriend is a heavy nicotine addict and I'm also hoping that maybe my dedication to going decaf will inspire him to at least cut back some. Hoping for the best!

I (M29) posted in this thread a couple of months ago and met a few lovely people. I wanted to follow up with something a bit more specific. This is kind of an add-on.

I’m a practising Buddhist and enthusiastic yogi. I follow teachings by Ajahn Brahm from the Buddhist Society of Western Australia (Thai Forest Tradition), and I practise yoga online with Elena Brower (if you know her!).

I love that technology allows me to access such wonderful teachers from Paris, but I’m really missing in-person connection with other Buddhists and yogis, for low-key chats about everything under the sun, discussing the Dharma, grabbing a tea or coffee, going for walks, meditating, or doing yoga together (especially outdoors 😄).

While I lean towards Theravāda Buddhism these days, I’m also interested in Tibetan Buddhism and open to learning from other traditions.

I’m also curious about other forms of spirituality, so if your practice looks a bit different, I’d still love to connect.

If more than one person is interested, maybe we could even start a small group eventually.

All are welcome – just a note that I prefer speaking English over French. 😊

Looking forward to hearing from you,

Tim

She made me feel wanted. But as soon as things got deeper, she pulled away. 

I now see she had a fearful-avoidant attachment style — craving connection, but terrified once it became real. Our good moments were tender and meaningful, but were always followed by distance, withdrawal, or self-sabotage.

Her background shaped this:

* She was an accidental pregnancy.
* Her dad wanted a boy and raised her to be tough.
* Her mom raised her and her younger twin sisters to be independent.
* They had caregivers, but little consistent emotional support.
* Her dad, a C Executive, was mainly absent.

Now, as an adult, she’s incredibly driven and independent, but almost completely cut off from her own emotional needs. She recently resigned from her job after four years, and it was only after we broke up that I learned she secretly wished to get pregnant by me, yet she never once expressed that out loud. And honestly, I believe history will repeat itself. One day she might accidentally get pregnant, be too proud to move or compromise, and become a single mom — still telling herself that needing no one is a virtue.

She broke up with me in the most spineless way—once, the night before returning home, then again, over the phone — during a call I thought was just an everyday conversation. No closure, no courage, no honesty. She said she was overwhelmed with work, but I knew deep down that wasn’t it. She had made up her mind long before, but just kept postponing the confrontation.

She says she’s empathetic. But when things got real, she detached and justified. That’s not empathy. That’s fear in disguise.

Small control issues told me more than I realized:

* Took over when I tried to cook.
* Corrected me driving/parking the car.
* Interrupted me to answer waiters in her language.
* Criticized my coffee shop choice—even when it was the same.

They were small; it didn't bother me at the time. Most of the time I was in her environment, so I thought I was doing something wrong. I didn’t feel like an equal. I felt like a guest.

If you’ve loved someone like this:  

* How do you stop waiting for the version of them that only appeared in fleeting moments?
   * I should have said something, called her out.
* And if you are someone like this, do you understand what your silence and avoidance really cost?",2,1748770386.0,AvoidantBreakUps,0,1.0,False

These triangle nesting coffee tables feature abstract leather tops and bamboo legs, available in eight distinct variants:

* **Full-Color:** Jewel-toned purples and violets with gold flecks for a dramatic look
* **Azure:** Blue-and-teal gradients evoke a calming, oceanic vibe
* **Black & White:** Bold monochrome waves for a modern, graphic touch
* **Grayscale:** Charcoal-to-light-gray transitions for a subtle, neutral palette

**Key Points:**  
• **Nesting Design:** Smaller 15.8″ triangle tucks completely under the larger 21.7″ triangle for a layered, space-saving setup—or separates for two surfaces.  
• **Bamboo Legs:** Three eco-friendly bamboo legs provide natural warmth and sturdy support.

I tried to brush it off, but it stung. I went to apologize, and she started crying, accusing me of being inconsiderate. Nana overheard and stepped in, calling me a ""whore"" and telling me to stop acting that way. It was harsh, and I felt crushed.

I ended up crying and told my mom everything. She was furious at Nana for saying those things to me. But then Nana started crying too, saying she was old and unloved and that we were making her impatient. It was a lot to take in, and I felt terrible for causing all this.

1l0konv,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1l0konv/feeling_lost_in_life/,Feeling lost in life.,"Hey, don't know if this is the right place, just want to get this out of my system. I (30/M) feel lost for a while now, both in my private and professional life.

I don't know how to start so i'll just type as it comes out. Starting with my professional life because \*i think\* thats where all of this originates from. And i'm not trying to flex but hope that it will help with perspective.

I work in IT, 100% remote with great benefits and pretty good pay for where i live. I can't consider myself rich but i also don't have to check prices in day-to-day life. This career choice started when i was young. It started with video games but not in a ""i want to make video games"" kind of way but in a ""i want to know how it works"" kind of way. As far as i remember, i always was a curious child and am today. I like exploring and learning new stuff.

The problem now is that my work, while sounding like a ""dream"" to most people i explain it to, doesn't fullfil me. Its mostly because i don't have much to do, which in turn makes me fear to get booted because i think i don't contribute enough. Now i was never told this. Its just my mind going crazy on the fear of losing my job. I also have a hard time communicating with others / my teamlead about this due to said fear. I also fear that if i get a new project / task, it will be to hard for me because my self-esteem is pretty low and fail that way.

Now switching over to my private life, its a similar thing. Again not to flex but to have some perspective. I am happily married, we have a house, i drive one of my ""dream cars"" (medium car guy) and a lot more ""toys"" which accumulated over the years. I was diagnosed with depression last year but struggled longer than this. Last december was especially hard with me basically doing nothing other than binge watching youtube and sleep (had vacation for most of december). Since the start of this year, i basically turned around my life. Fixed my sleep schedule, wife and i go to the gym 2-3 times a week (last real physical activity was in 2019), reduced screen time, started to read books recently (have maybe read like 2 books until my 30th birthday, now having read 2.5 books in this month), stopped smoking cigarettes (still vape but health got better already), stopped drinking alcohol, reduced amount of coffee / caffeine intake.

The problem is that nothing really feels good anymore. Nothing seems to make me happy anymore and i've yet to find my passion. One of the examples which is pretty important to me is riding my motorcycle. When i started, it was like therapy. I could get out and clear my head. I barely rode this year and the few times i did, it didn't feel great. I still want to and like the idea of riding but when i do, i either feel numb or get angry if something ""isn't perfect"" which ruins the whole ride (plus anger and motorcycles don't go well together). I also hurt myself in the gym on friday and have back pain now. This means i have to reduce gym time and the motorcycle will have to wait too (will still go to the gym, just have to see what excercises i can do without making it worse).

I don't even know how to explain it really, because everytime i think about it, i feel bad for ""crying about non-issues"". I constantly start new stuff, buy new toys but can't keep at anything (motorcycle and PC being the notable exception here). Just yesterday i got hyped about getting into mountainbiking or RC cars, both of which means spending money. But i know it wont last so i just shove it away to not waste money on impulsive behaviour. I also had this all my life with different hobbies. Too many to list them here.

I am having a lot of mental health issues and while it's a good thing i am aware of it, its also bad because i'm constantly thinking about all of this stuff. Don't get me wrong, i want to work on solving those issues but it feels like a losing battle. I'm also trying to get help. Was in contact with my doctor and a psychiatrist last year. Few weeks ago i reached out to a psychotherapist because i had another breakdown, which mostly shows as bad tantrums. No physical violence but i screamed at my wife because of nonsense, which in turn makes me feel bad even more. I have another appointment next week. I got a preliminary diagnosis of BPD, which from looking at the symptoms would explain a lot of stuff. I feel like this takes ages but i am also aware that there are more people with more severe issues out there which also makes me feel bad ""for taking up space from people who really need help"".

Another issue is that i don't have anyone to talk. Sure i got my wife but she struggles herself because she is burned out from her work (working in IT as well, just another company), which is why i don't want to ""bombard"" her with my problems constantly. She is aware of it and very understanding luckily. And other than my wife, i don't have anything resembling a social circle. No friends really and especially no contacts i think i can talk to about all of this. I also don't know where to start with looking for contacts and i also have a hard time keeping it up (which makes me believe in the BPD diagnosis).

I'll see where the therapy will bring me. Also thank you if you've read to this point. If someone wants to try and help please note that i have enough to ""wait for"" right now. Waiting for PT, waiting for a chance to talk to my team lead, ""waiting"" for my physical health getting better again, waiting for weather to clear to do things outside and so on. I feel like right now i have so few things to do that i have too much time to constantly (over-)think all of this.",1,1748769357.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Occasionally I will also get the kids something like a kinder egg or lollipop. 

I tell my husband it’s payment for all the free labor I do as a mother. I don’t really spend money outside of that. Not because I’m on a budget it is just I am too busy to spend money outside of my coffees.  So while I know it adds up I’m not too fussed about it.


My children call it’s “Mommies payment”  and they know when money drinks her coffee we do not talk to her.

And then my favourite coffee shop raised the prices. By a lot. 3 euros per latte is ridiculous. 

I am so annoyed by this and decided to stop spending money there. Actually everyone in the area is mad about it. It even made the chat group. 

Greeks take our coffee seriously. 

Then today, All the coffee shops in the area raised the prices to the same amount. It was like a the business owners got together and  decided to screw the consumers. 

I am sure it’s because they want to rip off the tourists. 

 1) the price will never come back down 

 2) do you know how inexpensive coffee is to make? It’s like a 200% profit. 

I am so mad that I just bought my own frappe blender and expresso machine I’ll make my own lattes. 

But  I am not happy about it. My husband said it doesn’t matter and if I’m going to be grumpy, which I am. Just to buy them.  

But it’s an extra 300 euros a month. 

It’s the principle.

I read it in one sitting while waiting for my hungover sister - who was visiting me from interstate - to wake up. The reason I read it in one sitting was not because my sister slept-in that late, but because it required a lower literacy level than the first Harry Potter book.

I then read Conversations with Friends which I found bland and full of boring characters striving to be deeper, but who never stood a chance given the elementary writing style. The only redeeming quality of this book was that the protagonist has endometriosis. It was good it raised awareness, however I'm guessing Sally's demographic is women of reproductive age anyway.

This year I read Intermezzo. I deliberately selected this book as what I call a palate cleanser. This means I selected it deliberately because it was a garbage book akin to watching trash TV to cleanse my palate between books that actually interest me. It was the perfect rubbish read to help me reset after I gave birth and was super tired and struggling to comprehend the ingredients on a food label.

Sorry Sally, your books suck. Youre just young enough, Irish and wear frumpy jumpers so you've been conveniently cast as a contemporary female author. You're never getting a Pulitzer but it's great you have reached commerical success.

We’ve built a mobile app - a new kind of social network focused on helping people find company for real-life plans (like grabbing coffee, going for a walk, karaoke nights, etc.). It’s live on the App Store, but we haven’t launched publicly yet - so no real users except ~30 friends for testing. No marketing done.

Here’s what we’ve done so far:
	1.	Fully functioning iOS app (backend ready for scale, built with user safety in mind)
	2.	No users yet, no traction — but not by accident. We’ve intentionally delayed marketing until core is solid
	3.	Company is registered in Dubai, with a corporate bank account
	4.	Trademark filed for name and logo
	5.	Full brand book and design system created
	6.	Infrastructure & cybersecurity designed to support 100M users (seriously - overkill for now, but future-proofed)
	7.	Team of 3:
 - angel investor (who already put in funds)
 - full-time developer (co-founder)
 - CEO (myself, running ops/vision/product)

So the question is:

I'd really like to understand other people's experiences and reasoning. As like most Neuro Atypical people, I struggle to see beyond my own experience.

Currently in titration for Methylphenidate, started on 18mg and went up to 36mg. This felt awful, properly felt like being on drugs with all the side effects and actually felt just as scatterbrained as pre meds. 
Was meant to go up to 54mg but I contacted Psych UK and said absolutely not I'd like to go down which they agreed with but suggested trying 27mg first which I'm waiting for the prescription. Back on 18mg for now and I don't ""feel"" anything, a little upped in the first hour like if you have a redbull or strong coffee then it levels. 
But the main thing for me is basic things, putting things away in drawers or rubbish in the bin. Putting my phone or smartwatch on charge as soon as I see it's low rather than waiting for it to die. Doing a boring admin task straight away rather than waiting until right before the deadline. 
I don't ""feel"" anything, I dont crash later in the day,, I just don't have the mental block stopping me doing basic things. Is that not supposed to be the point? To just be capable of the things everyone else is that we struggle with.
 I don't want to feel great like cocaine or ecstacy makes you feel then you come crashing down, I just want to feel like I'm not ""less than"" and I don't want to feel like it's 100% the meds.

Amex Killer credit card.","Hi all,

Yonder is a lifestyle credit card which provides points to spend on ‘experiences’ such as restaurant meals, flights, hotels, coffee, beer at pubs, flowers, delivery food services, trips away (such as log cabins and Wellness retreats) and much more -**it changes every month**!

If you sign up via my referral link (here: https://join.yondercard.com/bhdfbyx) you will get 10,000 points (worth approximately **£50 in credit** towards various experiences, dependent on experience chosen, in cities of London, Manchester, Birmingham Bristol and Bath, or towards the **online experiences** such as flights, food deliveries, flower deliveries etc - therefore can be used in any city, no matter where you live!).

Some good examples of redemptions I've personally used / I am planning on:

* Fancy massage parlour
* Various restaurants for lunches and dinner
* Ocean Bottle (akin to Chilly's) as a gift
* Freddie's Flowers

On top of this, some other perks of the card and referral include:

* you will be able to claim 3 months *premium* membership for **free** which provides **worldwide family travel insurance** when booking travel on the card and also 5 points per £1 spent.
* From my rough calculations, this correlates to somewhere in the region of 2 to 3% cash back dependent on the experience
* You’ll also be able to get Mastercard foreign exchange fees (i.e essentially the best fees you can get when abroad, akin to cards like Chase/Monzo/Revolut) and purchase protection, which is a **huge perk** and means you can get 2-3% cash back on **holiday spends**!

To sign up, you can go through the referral link (or any referral link!) and follow the steps.

**Application Process** (Including Hard Credit Check)

1. Download Yonder App using the [referral link](https://join.yondercard.com/bhdfbyx)
2. Verify Your Email & Details: Provide accurate information for verification.
3. Give some initial info and it performs a soft credit check to determine if you are eligible. If not, it will say so, so no need for a hard check.
4. Link Your Main Bank Accounts: This step ensures Yonder can offer you an appropriate credit limit.
5. Complete Identity Check: Take a quick selfie and provide a valid government-issued ID.
6. Undergo a Hard Credit Check: As with any credit card application, a hard check will be performed on your credit report.
7. Done

You can also cancel before the 3 months premium ends to avoid the subscription renewing and once you’ve spent all the points on experiences, and switch to a free card or just cancel the card.

On the whole I’m really enjoying Yonder and hope you will too! I’m enjoying so much so that I’m I've continued using the subscription after my first 3 months premium free (and I also use it on top of my AMEX). The nice thing is it tends to be **accepted everywhere** that AMEX is not (because it's Mastercard) and you can spend abroad without a transaction fee.

1l0kcgy,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1l0kcgy/how_to_store_coffee_beans/,How to store coffee beans?,"I have some questions relating to coffee bean storage. For background information: I (almost) make myself a pourover coffee on Saturday and Sunday (weekdays I'm at the office). Therefore, I think I use around 60-90grams of beans per week. I (finally) found a good coffee roaster from where I want to regularly buy my coffee beans: Manhattan Coffee Roasters. I intend to buy 3x 250g of beans everytime I order (to circumvent shipping costs). I only drink light roast coffees using a V60.

They recommend to let the beans rest for 2-3 weeks. However, they are good to drink when you receive them. 

My questions are:

1. What is recommened to store the beans in? I have seen multiple videos of people using the Fellow Atmos (or something similar that pulls a vacuum) but I have never seen Lance Hedrik or James Hofmann use them. Are they really necessary or can I store the beans in their originial package?

2. Is it recommended the freeze 1-2 bags? How would I then freeze them? It is likely that I will not start to use the third bag of beans for 6-10 weeks after having received them since I think one bag will last approximately 3-4 weeks. If it is recommended to freeze some beans, how would I do this? Just chug them in the freezer or is is recommended to vacuum seal them or something else?

Would love your guys' take on this.

I (25F) live with my boyfriend (27M) and have done for just over a year now (previously lived with his parents to save). 

My mum let me use her car when I passed my test in March under the idea that I drop her shopping off etc until we buy one for ourselves. A week later her car breaks down and it's written off due to a burst pipe (she never got it serviced). My partner and I buy ourselves a car, expecting my mother to do the same since she now doesn't have her one. 

I was wrong, she still doesn't have one, saying she needs to scrap the old one first but she can't as she needs the logbook from the dvla. Meanwhile I am doing her shopping every week or taking her shopping every week. On top of this she wants to always arrange the next meeting whenever I see her. I'm going to hers for coffee on my working from home lunch times (and ending up taking more than an hour) which I am starting to not want to do anymore. 

She doesn't seem to be making any moves to getting a car even though I constantly encourage her. 

Throughout all of this, I have a brother (29M) who cannot drive, and she doesn't ask him to do anything but will tell him to ask me for lifts to her house to help her with gardening (new occurrence) and expect me to stay for the whole day. 

My partner and I are quite people and she knew this when moving here. She and I text all day, and she wants to see me multiple times a week and it's just too much for me. Telling her this isn't necessarily an option because she really doesn't take it well and even makes little remarks constantly (a bit emotionally blackmail-ey).

I don't know what to do, I am stuck being a caregiver at 25 for a fully capable 60 year old woman.

* PC / Steam Deck / Switch gamer🎮

* Has 2 tattoos 😎
* Met 3 people from Reddit IRL 😁
* Laid back and easy to talk to - uses emojis a lot (can you tell?)

I'm very social and love to text (or better yet, voice call!) - ideally I'd like to make some new friends who I can talk with on the daily, if you also want to play games that'll be neat too! 

I love to screen share, so watching me play games or watching shows / movies / YouTube together is also on the cards, even if that means just sitting in a call together 😁

If you're based in the UK, big bonus points - you should deffo message, otherwise I'm happy to talk to anyone from anywhere. I'd like to have a little back and forth on Reddit first before possibly moving to another platform (i.e Discord)

Descendents plot: Harry x Ben

It had only been a few weeks since the barrier came down, and Ben was beyond stressed.

He had the help of his parents, sure — their experience, their wisdom, their gentle nudges when he needed them — but he was the king now. And kings didn’t get to tap out when things got complicated.

And things were *very* complicated.

Setting up a judicial system that could govern both Auradon citizens and former Isle residents was proving to be one of the most frustrating, mind-numbing, and emotionally taxing efforts he’d ever been a part of. Nothing about it was straightforward. Every law had to be examined, rewritten, or scrapped altogether. Justice meant something entirely different to those who’d grown up in privilege than it did to those who’d grown up locked behind a magical barrier.

Mal had tried her best to help, at least in the beginning. She sat in on meetings, offered insight, pushed back when things got too polished and political. But lately, she’d been caught up in her own world — discovering herself in ways Ben suspected she’d never had the space to before. He couldn’t even bring himself to be heartbroken over the breakup. Not really. If anything, he was relieved to see her thriving, finding her own identity outside of who she was *supposed* to be.

He missed her, sure. But more than that, he was proud of her.

Uma, of all people, had stepped up in her absence. She wasn’t exactly known for playing nice, but she had a good head for structure — and a bone-deep understanding of what fairness *really* looked like. She helped draft new laws, poked holes in the old ones, and offered sharp, often necessary critiques. Some of her crew had even been appointed to enforcement roles under the new system — minus Gil, who was off with Jay exploring the seas on some months-long voyage that barely checked in with civilization.

It gave them something to do. A purpose. A place in a world that was still trying to figure out what to do with them.

The villains weren’t isolated on the island anymore, but it wasn’t full freedom either. House arrests were in place for many. Surveillance was tighter than ever. People were watching — waiting for someone to mess up, waiting for Ben to slip. Every decision he made felt like it was being scrutinized from every angle. Every hour, the weight of it settled deeper into his spine.

Now, sitting at his desk, surrounded by stacks of legal documents, unfinished drafts, and half-drunk cups of cold coffee, he felt like his brain was turning to mush. His head was pounding, his eyes burned from reading too long, and even his crown felt heavier than usual.

He let out a breath and leaned back in his chair, eyes fluttering shut.

**Please,** he thought, a silent plea to whatever divine force might still be listening. **Just send me *something*. A distraction. Anything.**

As if summoned by that desperate thought, the palace guards shifted at the entrance to the room — and a familiar, swaggering figure stepped into view.

Harry Hook.

Ben blinked, sitting upright slowly, confusion flickering in his eyes before he smoothed it into something more neutral. Of course it would be Harry. That pirate always had impeccable — or infuriating — timing.

He had the same cocky stride, the same glint in his eye, but there was something different about him now. Like he didn’t just want to belong here — he *believed* he already did. And maybe he did. Maybe they all did, in their own way. But Ben couldn’t afford to let his guard down. Not yet. Not when so much was still fragile.

Still, he gave a small nod and gestured for the guards to let him through.

“Harry,” Ben said, keeping his voice calm, composed. “To what do I owe the pleasure?”

It had only been a few weeks since the barrier came down, but Harry Hook had already seen more polished tile and smug nobility than he cared to for the rest of his life.
Freedom, it turned out, came with a price — endless rules, paperwork, and judgmental stares. Still, it was better than the Isle. Almost anything was. He’d spent his whole life on an island where survival meant loyalty, sharp blades, and even sharper smiles. Now? Now he was expected to blend in with princes and courtiers. Pretend he didn’t notice the guards watching him like he’d pocket the silverware at any moment.
Whatever. Let them look.
He hadn’t come to fit in. He’d come to be seen.
Uma was doing her part — working closely with Ben, drafting laws, making herself useful. Harry respected that. Sort of. He’d never say it out loud, but seeing her be taken seriously by Auradon was... satisfying in its own way. Most of their crew had found something to do, too. Even Gil, off exploring with Jay like they were some kind of storybook pirates. Not that Harry missed him. Much.
Still, without Gil and without real purpose, Harry had been bored. Restless. And when Harry Hook got restless, trouble usually followed.
So today, he decided to wander — or rather, saunter — through the palace halls like he owned the place. The guards had stopped trying to intimidate him. It never worked. They let him through with a sigh and a side-eye, and Harry just grinned in return.
He knew exactly where Ben would be: buried under scrolls and stress, probably on the verge of collapsing into a puddle of good intentions and royal pressure.
The thought made him smirk.
By the time he stepped into the room, Ben looked like he hadn’t slept in days. Pale, tense, and surrounded by more parchment than a library fire sale. Harry tilted his head slightly, taking in the sight. The King of Auradon — fraying at the edges.
There was a beat of silence before Ben finally looked up and waved him in.
“Harry,” Ben said, steady but tired. “To what do I owe the pleasure?”
Harry’s grin widened — all charm and a hint of something sharper.
“Oh, y'know,” he drawled, stepping further into the room with a casual shrug. “Thought I’d check in on our fearless king. You look like you could use a break... or maybe just someone more interestin’ than paperwork.”",1,1748767103.0,RoleplayPartnerSearch,0,1.0,False

I (25F) live with my boyfriend (27M) and have done for just over a year now (previously lived with his parents to save). 

My mum let me use her car when I passed my test in March under the idea that I drop her shopping off etc until we buy one for ourselves. A week later her car breaks down and it's written off due to a burst pipe (she never got it serviced). My partner and I buy ourselves a car, expecting my mother to do the same since she now doesn't have her one. She has enough money to buy herself a new car as she is living off the sale money from her old house.

I was wrong, she still doesn't have one, saying she needs to scrap the old one first but she can't as she needs the logbook from the dvla. Meanwhile I am doing her shopping every week or taking her shopping every week. On top of this she wants to always arrange the next meeting whenever I see her. I'm going to hers for coffee on my working from home lunch times (and ending up taking more than an hour) which I am starting to not want to do anymore. 

She doesn't seem to be making any moves to getting a car even though I constantly encourage her. 

Throughout all of this, I have a brother (29M) who cannot drive, and she doesn't ask him to do anything but will tell him to ask me for lifts to her house to help her with gardening (new occurrence) and expect me to stay for the whole day. 

My partner and I are quite people and she knew this when moving here. She and I text all day, and she wants to see me multiple times a week and it's just too much for me. Telling her this isn't necessarily an option because she really doesn't take it well and even makes little remarks constantly (a bit emotionally blackmail-ey).

I don't know what to do, I am stuck being a caregiver at 25 for a fully capable 60 year old woman.

Yeah… you. The one scrolling Reddit because your chest feels tight. Your thoughts are spinning, your hands are a little sweaty, and you're wondering — ""Is this anxiety ever going to stop?""

I’ve been there. And not in the “I had a rough day” kind of way. I mean the can’t breathe, can’t think, can’t sleep for three nights in a row kind of way. The kind where even silence is too loud, and peace feels like a myth.

I tried therapy (still do), meds (some helped, some didn’t), meditation (great… if your brain isn’t on fire). But no one ever told me that food could either be my poison or my medicine.

So I started digging.

I went full rabbit-hole into nutritional neuroscience, biohacking, ancestral diets, and even trauma-gut links. And what I found changed everything. Not overnight, but close. Some of it — shockingly — brought me instant anxiety relief.

Let me share what helped me the most. Because if you’re suffering, you deserve relief. Real, biological, grounded relief.


---

🌱 THE ANXIETY-CRUSHING DIET THAT FINALLY GAVE ME PEACE:

🧠 1. Magnesium-Rich Foods (The Natural Chill Pill)

Magnesium is like nature’s original anti-anxiety drug. I was severely deficient — most of us are, thanks to processed food. Within 30 minutes of eating pumpkin seeds, spinach, or taking a glycinate supplement, I noticed a drop in that buzzing tension. Real talk.

> 💡 Try this: Handful of pumpkin seeds + a square of dark chocolate (85% cocoa) = anxiety magic.




---

🫐 2. Blueberries (Tiny Bombs of Brain Calm)

They’re rich in antioxidants and flavonoids, which boost brain blood flow and reduce cortisol. I call them my “edible Xanax.”

> 🔍 SEO tip: “Superfoods that reduce anxiety instantly” — blueberries are clinically backed to help.




---

🥬 3. Leafy Greens & Omega-3s (Fixing the Gut-Brain Axis)

Spinach, kale, wild salmon, walnuts — all anti-inflammatory. Anxiety lives in inflammation. Lower that, and your baseline mood starts shifting in just a few days.

> 🧠 Gut bacteria produce serotonin. Feed them well — they’ll return the favor.




---

☕️ 4. The Hard Truth: Caffeine & Sugar = Instant Chaos

This one stings. I used to live on iced coffee and granola bars. Turns out that was fueling my fight-or-flight response 24/7.

> 🚨 I swapped coffee for matcha (cleaner energy, L-theanine = calming), and sugar for raw honey or dates in moderation.




---

🍄 SUPERFOODS THAT GAVE ME INSTANT RELIEF (Like, Within Minutes)

Ashwagandha (adaptogen = nervous system reset)

L-theanine (found in green tea — pairs beautifully with caffeine to buffer jitters)

Lion’s Mane (nootropic mushroom = cognitive clarity without stimulation)

Chamomile tea + raw honey (yes, it’s grandma-core, but it works)



---

🔄 The Psychological Twist: I Thought I Needed to Do More… But I Needed to Nourish More.

The real kicker? Once I supported my nervous system with the right nutrients, my mind finally had room to heal. Therapy went deeper. Meditation actually started to work. My thoughts? Slower. My heart? Quieter.

It wasn’t about “fixing” my anxiety with willpower.

It was about feeding the system that keeps me alive — with real food, not stress fuel.


---

🧭 If You’re Feeling Lost, Start Here:

One green smoothie a day (spinach, blueberries, banana, flaxseed, almond milk)

Swap coffee for matcha with L-theanine

Add magnesium (glycinate) before bed

Ditch refined sugar for 7 days — just try

Keep a food & anxiety log — notice the link



---

❤️ You're Not Crazy. Your Brain Might Just Be Starving.

This isn’t woo. It’s neuroscience. It’s biology. And maybe, just maybe, it’s the beginning of you finally breathing deeply again.

If you’ve found foods that helped your anxiety, please share below. Let’s make this a thread of hope — not just hacks.

We heal together.

I tried everything keto, intermittent fasting, even pre-workout drinks that left me jittery. Then my sister mentioned Mitolyn, a “mitochondria-boosting” supplement. Skeptical but hopeful, I gave it six weeks. Here’s what happened.

# First Impressions

Mitolyn arrived in a plain box no flashy marketing. The bottle promised “natural energy” and “metabolic support” with ingredients like rhodiola and maqui berry. I liked that it was stimulant-free. Started with one capsule each morning after breakfast.

**Week 1-2:** Slow but SteadyNo magic overnight. By day 5, I noticed fewer afternoon crashes. Still needed coffee, but only one cup instead of three. My sweet tooth faded a bit fewer snack raids on the pantry. Scale didn’t budge, but my jeans felt less tight.

**Week 3-4:** Energy Kicked InWaking up became easier. I skipped naps and kept up with my kids’ chaos. Started walking 30 minutes daily (a win for me!). Lost 3 pounds. Best part? No jitters or weird heart races like with other supplements.

**Week 5-6:** Real ChangesBy week 5, my focus at work improved. Finished tasks without zoning out. Dropped another 4 pounds total of 7 lbs in six weeks. Even my husband noticed I wasn’t grumpy by 8 p.m.

# What Is Mitolyn?

I’ve used Mitolyn for six weeks and love it. Two capsules each morning gave me steady energy no afternoon crash and helped me lose about eight pounds without changing my diet. I felt calmer, more focused, and less stressed.

It works by boosting mitochondrial function with natural ingredients: Maqui Berry for fat breakdown, Rhodiola for stamina, and Griffonia for mood and cravings.

Pros: real weight loss, more energy, better focus, all‑natural.

Cons: takes a few weeks, daily use, online only.

# How Does Mitolyn Work Inside The Body?

I’ve used Mitolyn for six weeks and saw real change. It fixes the root of stubborn fat mitochondrial slowdown. My energy stayed high and my mood stayed even.

Each morning, I took two capsules with breakfast. By week two, I felt less tired. By week four, my clothes fit looser. By week six, I’d lost seven pounds without changing meals.

Mitolyn’s blend felt gentle but strong. Maqui Berry and Haematococcus cut cell stress. Berberine and Rhodiola kept my blood sugar steady and turned on fat burn. Schisandra and Griffonia eased stress so I didn’t snack out of worry. Amla and cacao helped me feel full of clean energy all day.

Pros: steady fat loss, no jitters, calm focus, natural mix.

Cons: you need to take it daily and wait a few weeks.

For best results, take two capsules with food, drink water, and move a bit each day. It’s not a quick fix. It’s a cell‑level boost that lasts.

On days I forgot, I noticed a slight dip in my focus. So I made it part of my routine—right after I pour my coffee.

I drank plenty of water. That helped the capsules move through my system and kept me hydrated.

I kept eating my normal meals. No extreme diets. Still, I moved more short walks, light stretching, nothing hard. That small activity boosted my results.

If you’re new to Mitolyn: start with one capsule for the first two days. See how you feel. Then move up to two capsules daily. Always take with food.

1l0jwul,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l0jwul,Help with Rug Placemat & Design,"Hello all!

I am trying to figure out where to put a rug, as the couch/tv area in my living room is quite small.

Was thinking two options - either a rectangular rug that is slightly wider than the couch extending toward the TV (but can't go all the way, as the door won't be able to open), or a smaller rug between the TV and couch where the couch does not sit on the rug. Will get a coffee table as well in either scenario that would sit on the rug.

Beau awoke with a yelp as he was forcibly ejected out of bed. The ship was shaken by a terrible impact, sending everything in his quarters flying in all directions.

Beau painstakingly got to his feet, massaging his head as he felt the ship's engines coming to life. The fact that all his possessions had left their place suggested that the ship's gravitational system had been temporarily disrupted. The energy needed to run it must have been temporarily diverted to the engines for an emergency maneuver.

His eyes scanned the room, looking for something. His eyes fell upon pink women's underwear. He quickly grabbed and hid them in a special compartment, hidden behind a portrait of Frank and himself standing on a rowboat, laughing hysterically and chucking grenades in the lake's depths.

He smiled at the pleasant memory of going fishing with his adoptive father. They held a grand feast that night, with all the fish they had caught.

Another tremor shook the ship. His faithful monkey companion handed him his clothes. ""Thanks."" he thanked the animal, patting it on its head. Beau quickly put the clothes on and made for the ship's bridge. The bridge was in utter chaos. Alarms blared, display screens showed multiple alert warnings and the crew operators screamed information at each other.

""Report!"" Beau shouted. A burly old man approached him. ""Greetings, Captain."" he told him, handing him a cup of coffee. ""Thank you, Ivan. What's happening here?"" Beau asked, taking a sip at the cup presented to him and grimacing at the beverage. It was cold. He hurriedly discarded the cup in a disposal container.

""Trouble, Sir. We were just detected by — Captain, you're injured!"" Ivan noted, pointing at a bruise on Beau's neck. Beau blushed and quickly slammed his hand on the bruise. ""Erm, yes. I tripped and fell. It's nothing."" he explained dismissively, pretending to take a glance around the room.

He locked eyes with the CIC operator, a generously-proportioned brunette, who had been glancing furtively at him. Both of them hurriedly broke eye contact. Ivan remained impassive. Beau cleared his throat loudly. ""What kind of trouble, exactly, Ivan?"" he asked his second-in-command.

""We've been detected by an unknown space probe, Sir. We were unable to intercept it before it could take off. Before we could formulate a plan, a blip appeared on the radar and we detected a long-ranged magnetic salve aimed at the ship"" recounted Ivan, pointing at the spot on the navigation map where the blip had come from.

""A salve? From that distance!?"" Beau exclaimed incredulously. ""Yes, Sir."" Ivan confirmed. Beau's expression hardened as he glanced at the navigation map. The Camelia's guns were unable to fire at a target that far away, despite being exceptionally well-armed for a ship of her class. This could only mean that whoever fired at them possessed superior firepower.

""Orders, Captain?"" Ivan asked him, startling him out of his inner thoughts. ""Shut down the gravitational system and re-route the power to our engines. We might have to evade another salve. Release safety locks on all guns. Crank up radar output to 150%."" Beau ordered. The CIC operator's seat swiveled as she turned to address him.

""Captain, if we overcharge the radars, we risk damaging the system's capacitors. Worst case scenario, we could end up losing them."" she warned him. ""I'm aware, Hazel, but I'd rather focus on being able to avoid those long distance salves."" Beau explained to her. ""I understand, Captain. In that case, according to my estimations, we can run them at this range for no more than 10 minutes before meltdown."" she informed him.

""I'll take it. Any asteroid or orbital station we could use to hide?"" Beau inquired. ""No asteroids nearby...Ah! There's...Ah, no. There's a derelict orbital station, but there's too much debris around it to safely approach. The only other option is the planet it's orbiting around, but re-entry would be extremey difficult due to the raging cosmic storm it is caught in. "" she reported. ""We have no other choice. We should be able to whether the storm with our shielding system."" declared Beau. ""All hands, to level one battle stations!"" he shouted in the ship's intercom. The crew scrambled to their seats. Beau fetched his protective equipment and quickly put it on.

""Lower the bridge!"" he declared as he stood next to his commanding chair. Strong uranium shutters extended to cover the bridge's viewing bays. This served to protect them from any impact that might strike the ship during combat. Two large metallic platforms slid sideways, allowing the ship's commanding station to lower itself into a reinforced bunker, at the heart of the ship. Once settled, the platforms returned to their original position, sealing the bridge in place. This way, the ship's commanding station was safest from harm.

A red light illuminated the bunker, casting strange shadows on the walls. Beau secured himself in the seat's straps. Without the gravitational system, the only way to remain seated was to tie yourself in.

A screeching alarm resounded on the bridge. Beau looked to Hazel. ""Captain! We have contact!"" she shouted. ""Three vessels."" ""Can you get a read on them?"" he asked her. ""I can't, there's too much interference."" she said apologetically. Beau gave her a curt nod and turned to The Camelia's helmswoman. ""Danielle, change course for the planet."" he commanded. ""Sir?! There's a cosmic storm there?"" she said, looking nervously at him. He nodded briskly. ""Uh, Yes Sir. Setting course for the planet.""

The Camelia's engine roared as she was propelled forward, rapidly approaching the planet. ""8 minutes left before radar capacitors meltdown."" announced Hazel. ""Hostiles at a distance of 5000, indigo-alpha."" Beau turned to a large man sitting to his right. ""Bagels, activate CIWS, load up all launchers with explosive missiles. Start a charge cycle on the railgun."" he ordered the weapons operator. ""Yes, Captain."" Bagels responded. ""We'll blast our way through the debris if we have to,"" Beau thought to himself. ""Hostiles at a distance of 3000, indigo-alpha."" Hazel relayed. Beau looked at her in surprise. ""Their ships are a lot faster than The Camelia."" he mumbled to himself.

""How much time on that charge cycle?"" he asked Bagels. The weapons operator messed with his station. ""Capacity at 18%. I'd say 2 minutes, Sir."" Bagels told him. Two minutes. They didn't have them. ""Ivan, shut down all auxillary systems except vitals, doors and fire control. Divert all latent energy to the shielding system. Disable safety limiters on the engines."" Beau stated firmly. ""...Right away, Sir."" the man responded after a short moment of hesitation.

""Hostiles distance 800, indigo-alpha. Analyzing profile signature..."" said Hazel, her voice trailing off as she focused on the task.""Heat source detected, approaching rapidly! The front ship fired at us, distance 500, indigo-alpha!"" Hazel yelled. ""EVADE! Hard to port! Maximum thrust!"" Beau bellowed. Danielle tugged hard on the ship's helm, allowing the enemy salve to slip just past The Camelia. A bright glimmer of light shone as the salve grazed the ship. The entire ship shook from the near miss. ""Energy shields are down to 37% charge, Captain."" Ivan coldly stated.

Beau did his best to retain his composure, but he was screaming internally. 37%! The Camelia's overcharged shields had been nearly wiped out from a simple graze! The ship would not survive a direct hit. What kind of weapon system where they using? His thoughts were interrupted by Hazel's smooth voice : ""Analysis complete. According to the intergalactic database, the hostiles match the characteristics of Asterium architecture."" ""DID YOU SAY ASTERIUM!?"" Danielle asked, besides herself. ""Yes. I believe the front vessel to be a frigate. Judging by the substantial size difference of the two other ships, it's safe to assume that they'd belong to the destroyer class."" she stated grimly.

A sense of panic spread through the crew as they realized the severity of their situation. Beau was determined not to show weakness in front of his men, something he learned from watching his father commanding his ship. ""Do not fear, my dear pirates! The Pink Menace has dealt with worse hands than this! We'll be just fine!"" he claimed with fervor, inspiring some courage in his despairing crew. ""Hazel, reduce output on the radars back to normal. Open the vents and activate fire control systems to regulate internal temperatures. There's no need any more, they're right behind us."" he declared confidently. The CIC operator executed his orders in silence. Sweat poured down Danielle's face as she fought with The Camelia's controls, the ship dancing wildly around asteroids while being battered by the full might of the cosmic storm.

""They're preparing to fire again! Detecting rising levels of energy from all three vessels!"" ""R-Railgun cha-rge a-a-at 65%, Captain!"" reported Bagels with a shaky voice. ""Captain, several incoming heat sources 300, indigo-alpha!"" screamed Hazel. ""Raise bow 60, roll 20 degrees to starboard, 140% engine thrust!"" Beau instructed Danielle. The struggling pilot executed his orders, knowing they would set the ship on a collision course with an asteroid. The ship began shuddering uncontrollably as the engines were pushed far beyond their manufacturer's recommended output. ""Bagels, fire all guns at the asteroid straight ahead, now!"" The Camelia's shields wavered off to allow for its guns to unload into the asteroid, blasting it into hundreds of pieces, but exposing the ship to the turbulent swells of the storm.

The incoming barrage of salves hit the tail end of the ship as it curved out of its trajectory, engulfing it into a ball of flames and sending it on an uncontrolled spin towards the planet. The Camelia's shields flickered on and off as it couldn't keep up with the cumulative damage of the storm, the falling pieces of asteroid bombarding the ship and the friction generated by re-entry into the planet's atmosphere.

Many of the ship's crew had already lost consciousness from the great gravitational forces being exerted upon them. Barely holding on, Beau dragged himself to the pilot seat where Danielle laid inert. He pushed her aside and grabbed the controls, attempting to perform an emergency landing on the planet. His consciousness wavered and all he remembered was seeing vast plains of white before an all encompassing darkness overtook him.

## Key Features Analysis

The modern portable keyboard is packed with technology. From connection capabilities to key types, understanding these features is vital when selecting the perfect tool.

**Size and Weight:** Compact and lightweight design for easy portability.

The size and weight of a portable keyboard are crucial for users who prioritize mobility. Most portable keyboards range from 60% to 75% of the size of a standard keyboard, making them easy to fit into a backpack, briefcase, or even a large pocket. Models are generally below 1 lbs, ensuring they won’t add notable weight to your load. These compact dimensions and low weight make portable keyboards ideal for travelers, students, and anyone who needs a keyboard that can be easily carried around and used in various locations.

**Connectivity Options:** Bluetooth 5.0 and USB-C compatibility.

Reliable connectivity is essential for a seamless typing experience. Bluetooth 5.0 provides a stable and fast wireless connection with minimal latency, allowing you to pair your keyboard with multiple devices such as smartphones, tablets, laptops, and even smart TVs. The USB-C port allows for wired connectivity and charging, offering a backup option when Bluetooth connectivity is not available or when you need to charge the keyboard quickly.Some high-end models even support multi-device pairing, allowing you to switch between connected devices with a simple key press.

**Key type and Travel:** Mechanical, scissor-switch, and butterfly mechanisms with varied travel distances.

The key type and travel distance substantially impact the typing experience. Mechanical keyboards offer tactile feedback and longer key travel, providing a more satisfying and precise typing feel favored by many enthusiasts. scissor-switch keyboards, commonly found in laptops, offer a balance of responsiveness and low profile, making them comfortable for extended typing sessions. Butterfly mechanisms,known for their extremely low profile,are often used in ultra-thin keyboards. The optimal key type depends on individual preference and typing style, so it’s essential to consider which key mechanism feels most comfortable and efficient for you.

**Battery Life:** Up to 6 months on a single charge.

Long battery life is a critical consideration for portable keyboards used on the go. Many models offer rechargeable batteries that can last for several weeks or even months on a single charge, minimizing the need for frequent charging. Battery life can vary depending on usage patterns and features, such as backlighting. High-end models incorporate efficient power management technologies to maximize battery life, ensuring that your keyboard is always ready when you need it.

**Material and Build Quality:** Aluminum alloy and durable plastics.

The material and build quality determine the keyboard's durability and overall feel. Aluminum alloy provides a premium look and feel, while also offering robust protection against damage. Durable plastics are also used to create lightweight and sturdy housings that can withstand the rigors of travel. High-quality materials and solid construction ensure that the keyboard maintains its performance and appearance for years to come.

**Backlighting:** Adjustable brightness and color options.

Backlighting enhances visibility in low-light conditions, making it easier to type in dimly lit environments. Adjustable brightness levels allow you to customize the intensity of the backlight to suit your preferences and ambient lighting conditions. Some models offer customizable color options, allowing you to personalize the look of your keyboard and create a more immersive typing experience. Backlighting not only improves visibility but also adds a touch of style to the keyboard.

Key features of a modern portable keyboard include:

*   Compact size and lightweight design

Many models come with a carrying case or sleeve for added protection and convenience. The combination of portability and convenience makes portable keyboards an ideal solution for anyone who needs to type on the go.

**Enhanced Accessibility:** Provides a better typing experience for users with limited mobility.

Portable keyboards can significantly improve accessibility for users with limited mobility or dexterity.
