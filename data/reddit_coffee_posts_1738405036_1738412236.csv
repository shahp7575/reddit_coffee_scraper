I operate a few short-term rentals in different states remotely and my husband has a remote W2, so we have a mix of personal and business expenses. We also travel internationally at least once a year (almost always on Delta) to visit family and drive to our rentals at least twice a year (19-hour drive each way).

# Current Credit Cards:

* **Amazon Prime Visa** – Used for rental supplies and personal purchases.
* **Costco Executive Membership** – Mainly for coffee pods, trash bags, and other supplies for the rental and personal groceries and gas when we're not on the road.
* **Chase Ink (Business)** – Business expenses.
* **Chase Sapphire Preferred (CSP)** – Travel, car rentals.
* **Delta Miles Program (Free, No Card)** – Accumulating SkyMiles.
* **Chase Freedom** – Used for personal expenses, mostly for the rotating 5%
* **Amex Blue Cash Everyday** – Used for one of the rentals, but not a big fan.
* **Capital One Quicksilver**—I recently used this for a balance transfer (0% APR for 12 months), but I plan to stop using it.

# Goals:

* Maximize points for **flights (Delta)** and **hotels (Hyatt preferred)**.
* Possibly add another **Chase Ink** for the bonus points at the end of the year.
* Streamline the cards and stop using Amex Blue Cash Everyday & Quicksilver.
* Optimize business and travel rewards.

Would love to hear your thoughts on how I can fine-tune my setup! Should I add a Chase Ink for the SUB, or is there a better strategy? Any recommendations for maximizing Hyatt stays? Thanks in advance!",1,1738411339.0,CreditCards,0,1.0,False

He hands me his ID but I don’t see his name in the arrivals. “Are you looking to make a reservation?” I ask calmly. “No it’s a reservation under my name.” Of course, after digging through next day’s reservations it pops up. “I apologize sir, check in for this is not until 3PM tomorrow. If possible, you can call beforehand to see if they can check in early past 11am check out time.” Furious, he states that he sent a message to our email that he wanted to check in 2-3am on morning of check in day. After digging through various emails, I find his request which was only typed out: “looking to check in 2-3.” No AM or PM even mentioned lol. I explain that to him and it makes things worse, demanding I change the dates. Given it’s a third party, my hands are tied but I let him know he can call the third party support to see if they can help him. “That’d be good.” He replies before standing there almost 2 minutes in silence giving me a death stare. “Sorry sir, I can’t call the third party website, you have to reach out to them personally.” This man is beyond pissed now, shaking his head and yelling at me about how ridiculous it is he can’t check in early at 3 am. He leaves, and when I finally think he is gone, he comes back to yell at me some more, demanding a pen so he can write something (I’m guessing a complaint).

I have always been a topper in my school until the 12th class. After passing my high school, I decided to go to Kota to prepare for JEE and take a gap year. So, I went to Kota in August. Everything went well with its ups and downs until November. Sometimes I used to get good marks, and sometimes it was demotivating. This happens in everyone’s life. I used to go to class for my JEE prep. I was a good girl, and my maths teacher used to praise me very often. This is where it all started.


There was a boy who used to ask doubts from the teacher during the class. I always sat on the first bench, and since it was the time of the corona pandemic, wearing a mask was mandatory for everyone. As time went by, I started paying attention to the guy who asked doubts in the class. Although I never turned around to see who the boy was, his voice became so familiar to me that I started liking it. One day a boy was passing by my side and I realized that this was his voice. That day, I got to know that the boy wore a blue-colored hoodie. From that point on, I started noticing when he was passing by my side. I had never seen his face, but I just started liking him.


One day, he suddenly asked about my rank and marks in the Allen paper. I told him, and then, seeing the coincidence — the one boy I had started liking approached me. He would then usually ask me about my marks, and I always replied with just the numbers, no further conversation. Then, one day during Diwali time, our professor clicked a class photo, and in that picture, I saw his face for the first time. Although he wasn’t that handsome, I had already fallen in love with his voice, his way of speaking, and his good height. I used to crop his photo from the class photo, zoom in on it, and just look at it. This was the first time I had ever done something like this for a boy.


Then, one day, I thought of installing Telegram because my class used to discuss some doubts in the group. But I don’t know why I had a gut feeling that he might message me on Telegram, and I might get distracted from my studies due to love and all. And you know what? This happened. He messaged me saying, “Your mobile number is visible on Telegram; you might want to hide it if it happened by mistake.” My heartbeat just went up. Can you imagine there’s a boy you think about all day, and then he messages you? From then onwards, we started asking each other doubts because I didn’t have a single friend in Kota. I just went to class in the morning and then went back to my room. I never went outside my hostel even to eat anything. So, I also thought that this was a good opportunity to ask him doubts, and we could discuss things

Things started like this. After he messaged me on Telegram, one week later, the lockdown was imposed again, and we had to attend online classes, unable to go to offline classes. So now, we became good friends in a very short time online. We even started talking on calls and video calls. One day, he was telling me about his best friend, who was a girl. I felt jealous and told him about my feelings for him — that I loved him. I shared everything, about how I had kept notes of every time he spoke to me and how much I was obsessed with him and loved him. He also admitted that he had some feelings for me. From that point, we started talking even more, but it was still only online. One day, we went on a walk, and then one day, we also went to a café after the Allen paper, had some coffee, and I held his hand for the first time. That was such a special moment because it was my first time holding a boy's hand. We had only met offline for these moments.
And then, I always used to get jealous of his female friend, and I would always ask him to give me some time and love. But we both were also busy with our studies. The difference was that, no matter how busy I was with my studies, he was always my first priority. I never even put my phone on silent at night, thinking, ""What if he messages me while I’m sleeping?"" I wanted to be 100% available whenever he called or texted me. I was so obsessive that I used to sleep with my phone on my chest, just so that if it vibrated, I’d know it was his message. But this wasn’t the case on his side. After some time, he just wanted to focus on his studies more because he had been in a relationship before, and he also had trauma from that.


So, whenever I used to tell him that we would always be together for a lifetime, he would get irritated because he had already gone through such experiences and knew how uncertain life could be. He also got irritated when I would get jealous of his female best friend. Under all these circumstances, with the pressure of studies and everything, he asked me if we could just be friends first and think about a relationship later. But I asked him if I could just be friends, then he should give me assurance that we would be in a relationship if everything went well. He wasn’t sure about that either, and it started to feel like a pressure on him. But for me, how could I just be friends with a boy I loved so much?


This went on, and it was such a difficult phase for both of us because he also felt guilty seeing how much I was hurt by him. There were times I used to cry, asking him to love me, even a little. I couldn’t hold all of this in my room in Kota, so I decided to go back home. Classes were online, so there was no point in staying in Kota, crying alone in my room over a boy. All of this was happening, and I went home. After some time, the lockdown ended, and offline classes began again. But those classes were optional, so I decided to go back to Kota and continue my prep. But when I went back to Kota, I felt so miserable. Even though he had asked me to be friends, I still waited for his message, while he could live without messaging me for more than 24 hours, which was unimaginable for me. So, I was at the lowest phase of my life.


Then, a friend of his approached me online. Let’s call the boy I love ""A"" and the other boy ""B."" B asked me a question related to aldol condensation (just to start a conversation), and then he told me that he knew my story. He gave me some advice not to fall into all this. He also shared his story with me. I used to tell him how much I loved A and wanted to be with him. I told him how much I missed A, and he made me understand. So, I started sharing things with him.


And here begins the second chapter of my life — one that I never knew would affect me so much that I would even feel the need to write a Reddit post to tell someone what emotional flux I’m going through.


One day, the JEE Advanced results came, and boy A (my first love) asked me for my marks. It wasn’t up to my expectations, and he told me his marks. He laughed at me and said, ""You used to study more than me always, and you got more in JEE Mains. You always scored more than me in Allen tests, but I got more in JEE Advanced."" Although he didn’t mean to hurt me, he was just happy because he had done well. But this made me feel so sad — I was upset about my marks, and he was laughing.
Then, boy B also asked me for my marks. He had scored higher than both me and boy A. But despite that, he comforted me when there was a wave of happiness in his family. He stayed with me when he could have been celebrating himself. This changed my perception. I realized that I was running behind a boy who didn’t care about me, and I should focus on the boy who was always there for me.
So, boy B and I started talking more, and after some time, we both realized that we could be good for each other. My bond with boy B mostly grew because boy A had made me so mentally dependent that I had no one else after him.
And an interesting fact is that I was always in a long-distance relationship (LDR).
Now, let’s talk about boy B. He was a nice and caring boy who was always available for me, just as I was for boy A. He loved me just as easily as I loved A. Then we both went to college, but our colleges were in different states. I met boy B for the first time when I was in the first year of college. He came to meet me from his state, and everything seemed to be going fine at first.


But then things started to change. Initially, I felt incredibly lucky to have him in my life. He was humble, respectful towards women, and always made me feel special. However, we were in a long-distance relationship and had only met 4-5 times over the years, which made things challenging.


Things began to shift when I moved to college. I’m an introvert and don’t interact much with others, but he started commenting on small things. For example, during a festival, I wore a saree and makeup, and he asked, “Who are you dressing up for? I’m not there to see you.” I explained that I dressed up because I enjoyed it, but he responded, “If that’s the case, you can wear it in your room—why show it to others?” He apologized later, but similar incidents kept happening.


He always struggled with trust issues. When I went out with friends, it often felt like I needed to ask for his permission rather than just inform him. He would say things like, “Be back in the hostel by 10 PM,” even though I reassured him about the company I was with. He frequently said, “All boys are bad,” and when I disagreed, he accused me of taking their side. After several arguments on this topic, he stopped saying such things, but I wasn’t sure if his mindset had truly changed.


One day, after a big argument, I decided to visit him without informing him beforehand. When I told him I was on the train, he asked me to get off at the next station and return to my college. I got off the train, crying. Later, he explained that he didn’t want to risk my relationship with my mom, but the incident deeply hurt me.


Over time, his behavior became more aggressive. During arguments, he used hurtful words like “besharam,” “gandi ladki,” “bekar ho,” and worse. Although he always apologized afterward and felt extremely sorry, this behavior tended to repeat itself during conflicts.


There were also control-related issues. For example, during a family trip to Manali, I posted photos on Instagram. He criticized me, saying I was seeking appreciation online, and told me to turn off the comments. When I refused, explaining that I would delete inappropriate comments if they occurred, he became angry. He had access to my Instagram password and once blocked a classmate without asking me because the person sent me a reel. When I confronted him, he accused me of taking that person’s side.


I decided many times that I should leave him because I couldn’t stay in such a relationship for the rest of my life. Then he would just say, “You’ll face a lot of trouble after me. I was a protective layer around you.” And I would start to think that maybe I was the one who was wrong, and perhaps I was just seeking attention from others. Whenever he found out that I told some incidents to my friends, he would always say, “You’re just a poor thing seeking attention from everyone.”
I had told my mom and sister about him, and everyone always advised me to get out of this relationship. But then I thought, “I’ve told everyone from my perspective, and people are judging based on that without hearing his side of the story.”
And whenever I thought about leaving him, I couldn’t stop thinking about his good qualities. I would wonder, “What if he’s just frustrated because of these fights? What if he’s not able to focus on his studies because of me, and that causes more frustration?” I would generate so many reasons not to leave him. Like, I had my internship sorted, so I was calm, but during his study time, I was the one disturbing him due to my relationship concerns.
I knew my boyfriend was very loyal to me, and I was equally loyal to him. However, things just weren’t working out between us. We ended up fighting most of the time. The reason I was considering ending the relationship wasn’t because I wanted to be with someone else. To be honest, none of my male friends had ever even put a hand on my shoulder.


My boyfriend was extremely possessive. I understood that he might know how other men think, but it was exhausting. Once, a close friend of mine—who was like a brother to me—called me at night because he was going through a tough time and needed someone to talk to. I told my boyfriend about it, and he got so angry, questioning why my friend called me at night, even though he knew that friend very well, as they were roommates for a year.
I was always transparent with him. He even had my Instagram password, and I shared screenshots of my WhatsApp chats whenever he asked. But despite my efforts, he still struggled with insecurity.
When we argued, I tried to stay calm, but his anger got the better of him. On festivals, like anyone, I liked dressing up and posting photos on Instagram. If anyone commented something inappropriate, I was perfectly capable of handling it and deleting it myself. Honestly, only three of my female friends commented on my post, so I didn’t understand why he was so afraid.


I even shared screenshots of messages from people who’d confessed their feelings for me, showing him how I responded to reassure him. What more could I do to prove my loyalty? He was my everything, and I had no interest in anyone else.
But his anger issues ruined so much. During fights, he would block me everywhere—WhatsApp, Instagram, LinkedIn, Gmail, even Google Pay. Imagine my mental state during those times. I never blocked him because I knew it would cause him stress or anxiety. So, why did he do this to me?
I kept calling him, sometimes 50 times, but he would say he needed space and would block me instead.


He was a good and loyal person, but his anger and insecurities were too much to handle. I didn’t know what to do when things just weren’t working anymore.


What was the point of staying in this relationship when we fought so much? What was the point of being in a relationship where I ended up crying every day because of the hurtful things he said to me in anger, only for him to apologize later?
These fights were affecting both of our studies, and he blamed me for his distractions, saying that because of these fights, he wouldn’t be able to achieve anything in the future. That’s when I felt it was better to end the relationship because I loved him and genuinely wanted to see him succeed. If this relationship was causing stress for both of us, then what was the point of staying in it?
Whenever I cried on a call, he would just cut the call and say, “Why do you cry all the time? You end every conversation with tears.” He even accused me of being dramatic. I tried telling him many times, “Please don’t use those hurtful words; they hurt a lot.” He apologized, but ended up saying the same things again in anger.


I was a Google intern, and he hadn’t secured an internship yet. So, I often thought that maybe he was stressed due to the pressure of finding an internship, family responsibilities, financial issues, and other challenges. I really loved him, but the words he said in anger stuck with me. Whenever I looked at him, I couldn’t help but remember those hurtful words.


I also worried about the future. If I married him, would he always judge me whenever I dressed up for an event or anything else? I knew he loved me deeply and would sacrifice his life for me, but what do I do when these things keep happening? I felt so confused and ended up overthinking everything.
So these were the things that happened to me, and one day, during a fight, he said such hurtful things that I just couldn’t live with him anymore. I made myself firm in my decision to not live with him and to stay away from him.


When I was on a call with him, and he was saying things I had never imagined he could say, I felt like I was at the lowest point of my life. At that moment, I texted my ex because I was emotionally shattered—I might have taken a wrong step if I hadn't reached out to someone.

I had no close friends because the person I was in a relationship with was my everything. So, I told my ex everything, and he helped me through it. He had always said that I could message him anytime I needed, and he would always be there as a friend. And he kept his promise—he was there for me.
Right now, I don't want to be in a relationship with anyone, but I feel incredibly alone. I keep checking my phone, hoping someone has messaged me, but there are no notifications. I also miss B and worry about him. I just hope that wherever he is, he is happy. I’ve made up my mind not to be in a relationship for the next 2–3 years and to focus solely on myself but I feel incredibly alone.
That’s why I come to the library early in the morning and try to concentrate on my work. But these thoughts keep running through my mind, and I have no one to share this with. I just don’t know what to do—I feel confused. Even though I know what I should be doing—focusing on myself, my dreams, and avoiding these kinds of thoughts—it's incredibly difficult.


One was B who was very caring and always available but treated me like shit in anger, and then I have A who was my first love and I still expect him sometimes to msg me.


This is why I never wanted to leave A, because I knew my past would never truly leave me.But now I just have memories of two traumas of life with me. And I’ve learned an important lesson—never enter a relationship when you're at your lowest, just because you need someone emotionally.

I'm about to be 23 in about 10ish days, I currently live in the US and I have been wanting to move out of the country since I was young. Because of more recent events, I am thinking of speeding up this process. But I'm also a worry wart, I have never lived outside of my city/planned a huge move like this and I am worried that I may be unprepared.

I have other countries that I want to go to but I am leaning towards Indonesia because my mom's entire family lives there. 

As it stands in any emergency situation I could reliably drop everything get a plane ticket and stay with family but I wouldn't want to be a financial burden/I would like to live there sustainably by myself. 

*I am wondering if becoming a University Student would be the best pathway for LTR/Citizen or if I am better off trying to find work out there using connections. And in general with what I have now, would I be prepared? Or should I take a step back and earn/secure certs?*

I will have roughly 50k in savings by the time I decide to move and expect to take 6 months to 1 year for a job search. 

Current Experience:   
I work in the immigration industry as a document preparer/signer (really low/entry level). I have worked in the tech repair and support industry. I have worked a variety of service, clerical, and warehouse jobs as well. I am trying to become an illustrator full time as a dream career. **But overall I would be willing to do most jobs if it means securing independent living.**   
  
Education:  
Partial college complete, but I have had to stop education due to issues with FAFSA (In the midst of an appeal right now). This is for a graphic design major. 

*I am thinking about switching majors if it means an easier time with living in other countries and I have thought about fast tracking and paying out of pocket for a WGU degree.*

Lifestyle:   
I have lived alone for the last 5ish years and don't have a high standard for living, I like to live frugal, don't mind eating/cooking Indonesian food and dishes. I don't go out much other than for work and the occasional coffee/library study and draw sessions.   
My dream is to eventually become an Illustrator and with the high cost of living in the US I feel it's not as viable to do than in other countries. *Everything I do is to get to this eventual goal.*

Overall any advice would be amazing but the questions above are most important to me.

1if4fcf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD_NSCommunity/comments/1if4fcf/calming_my_system_puts_me_in_a_state_without_any/,Calming my system puts me in a state without any motivation. How do I move on from there?,"I think I am experiencing some form of going back to one of my root problems. My trauma was forged under a whole series of very different sets of circumstances, created by my mother. Some were more to the dramatic side, but I would say the longest impact comes from a situation of silent neglect, severe understimulation during formative years, lack of self development and being used to confirm and regulate others.

On days where I get it all right, I can achieve a great calm in my system. It feels nice. The external agitation and false urgency are gone. In a way, I feel very real in this state. However the downside is: I have no motivation there to do anything. Not having intrinsic enjoyment is one of the biggies in my life, it has perpetuated my lack of self expression. I essentially feel I am just trodding through the years given, with no ME to make them mine.

That is why I think, this state of calm provides me a direct view to my inner void. When I am there, I feel like my undistorted self, but in return I must face the fact that this self wants nothing. It is still at the point where I abandoned it. After realizing this, the calm will eventually subsede into tiredness or some form of coping mechanism (food, have coffee, scroll...).

I do think that achieving this calmness is valuable, and could be the starting point for healthy action. But why is it so passive? How do I merge the calm and doing something?",3,1738409458.0,CPTSD_NSCommunity,0,1.0,False

I learned a very long time ago. **POWER is GIVEN**. This is one of life's truths, **MAKE IT YOUR MANTRA**. 

When you are at your job, the tasks that you complete demonstrate that you are giving YOUR power to someone in authority to direct your actions. This principle applies to ANYTHING you do in life.  

For example, IF the person in the grocery store asks you if you would reach high for them to get them that can of coffee, IN THAT moment you are giving that person POWER. It is a CHOICE.  It applies to everything you do in life. 

EVERYTHING you do in life is a demonstration of power. If you hold the door open for someone, you are giving them POWER.   IF you stop at a RED light, you are allowing the system to control your actions in that moment, by giving  away the POWER to go forward. IF YOU are Choosing to remain silent in a police interrogation then YOU ARE controlling the POWER. 

Walking off the job is a way to demonstrate that OTHERS do not have power over you. When done in MASS the effect becomes an earth shattering epiphany for those who believe they have power over you. 

IF the entire Secret Service DETAIL sat down one day and just said NO. Then this whole shenanigan would end.

 IF all the workers at the capitol building just suddenly had the flu, THIS would end. 

IF every staff member at the FBI called in sick. THIS WOULD END.   Because **Power is given**.

Civil Disobedience works. The reality is simple, THEY cannot FORCE anyone to do anything against YOUR WILL.... Power is given.  **Seriously Ladies and Gentlemen, YOU are not in a place of weakness. YOU are in a a place of POWER.  You always have been.... you just didn't know it.** 

PASS IT ALONG.

love to all, old guy.

1if42ky,https://www.reddit.com/r/narcissisticparents/comments/1if42ky/please_help_could_my_dad_be_a_narcissist/,Please help.. could my dad be a narcissist?,"I grew up with a very violent, abusive, passive aggressive, manipulative father who essentially traumatised our family to this day. He's still married to my mother because she has nowhere to go, and he gets away with it because he's toned it down over the years (after me confronting him numerous times - which I can feel he resents me for) and spoils us with meals and gifts here and there, but it's still very much there 'under the surface' all the time. My sister and I are now in our late 30's .

Having grown older, I think I'm finally coming to the realisation that he may be a narcissist which would explain a lot, but I would still appreciate other opinions.

I've compiled a list of things he's done repeatedly over the years, some quite specific, maybe some of these are recognisable to you?

1. **Treats strangers better than his family**. If my mother is blocking a walkway for example and strangers are trying to pass, he'll shout at her and pull her out the way as if the passer by is more important than his own wife and then berate her afterwards.
2. **Makes demeaning comparisons with other people**. If he sees an old friend of mine in a TV advert for example, the first thing he'll do is ask how my career is going and why I'm not up there on the TV yet.
3. **Wants to control conversations**. Needs so desperately to control every conversation, meal times etc, even if it's a topic nobody cares about, just to hear himself talk, and when someone else starts controlling the conversation he becomes all small, timid and almost child-like.
4. **Requires constant validation like a drug**. He's constantly telling me what he's done for me, for example he'll randomly come to me and say *'hey I re-stocked the fridge with that drink you like'* or *'I hope you enjoyed the dinner last night'* all in an attempt for me to say *'thank you'*. It's like he needs 100 thank-you's a day, whether in real-time or for something in the distant past of future.
5. **Blames everyone but himself**. We went on holiday last year and he forgot to pack an important item, so he blamed everyone else for not helping enough which meant he had to do too much which meant he forgot to pack it because he was overwhelmed.
6. **Downplays his mistakes**. When someone else make a mistake he'll shout and make a huge deal of it, but when he makes a mistake he'll shrug it off being like *'ok I'm sorry guys, I'm sorry, let's just forget about it'* and then change the subject very quickly or offer to go buy us ice cream 🍦
7. **Thinks he can do everything better**. He'll watch whatever someone else is doing like a hawk ready to correct them or their technique and then offer to step in to take over, for example packing the car or doing something around the house.
8. **Sulking**. If one of us says we're not interested in doing something or tell him he's out of line or he makes a mistake, he'll go into a huge sulking mode equivalent to a 6 year old. If you try talk to him he'll give you 1 word answers or just nod his head to let you know he's sulking. It's quite pathetic.
9. **Social anxiety**. I've noticed he gets very insecure in social settings, almost like he panics.
10. **Sense of entitlement**. He expects every situation to cater to his needs, whether it's a form of payment at a vendor, or that the escalators are operational in a foreign country at 4am. If not, he'll let it be know and throw a temper tantrum as if these people have let him down.
11. **Doesn't respect boundaries**. Whether I'm sleeping or lying outside with music in my ears trying to relax, he'll be sure to interrupt with some completely unimportant piece of information and will happily sabotage my relaxing time because he doesn't know how to relax himself.
12. **Extreme emotional volatility**. He'll sit down with his coffee and spill a drop on the table and explode with annoyance, stampeding around to get a dishcloth, and ruin the mood for everyone. He'll go from relatively calm to scarily angry from one second to the next.
13. **Ruins dinners and special occasions.** He'll happily bring up grievances on special occasions or get angry at a restaurant when we go out for dinner, and will knowingly ruin the evening out of arrogance and selfishness.
14. **Guilt tripping**. For example like the above situation, he'll then apologise, and say something like *'i'm sorry guys, I just always f things up blah blah blah'* and then go sit in the corner and sulk and read or something, hoping we feel sorry for him. Yes you are right though, you always f things up and we never do.
15. **Guilt tripping on steroids**. Numerous times he's brought up how much he's had to sacrifice in his life to give us the opportunities he has, and will often do so in a manic rage out of nowhere, and completely disproportionate to the intensity of the conversation that was happening before.
16. **Self pity**. It's him against the world, he's so perfect and can do no wrong, and almost everything around him is a disappointment. Unless it's someone very successful, then he thinks he's found his people, someone who understands him.
17. **Silent treatment**. Out of nowhere I'll notice that he is not responding as verbally anymore, like he's harbouring resentment for something I did or didn't do. Then I land up back-tracking through the day wondering what it was, maybe he feels unappreciated or is disappointed about how something went or how I reacted.

These are the most obvious ones, I could probably find another 10 or so but I think this gives a good idea of what we're dealing with. So does this sound like a narcissist?",1,1738407947.0,narcissisticparents,0,1.0,False

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-electronics-for-kitchen  
  
- High-priced gadgets often come with advanced features but may not be necessary for every home cook.
- Select gadgets based on their importance and use frequency rather than getting swayed by trends.
- Consider the cost of ownership, including durability and warranty options.

By setting a clear budget, you can focus on finding the best devices that fit your financial plan without overspending.

### Research and Reviews

- Ratings from reputable review sites

1if40so,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1if40so/i_reached_my_limit/,I reached my limit,"Hey everyone. I recently found this subreddit when looking for relationship advice and, holy shit, a lot of your stories sound familiar. Here's mine.

 I've been with my partner for almost 10 years. Throughout our years together we've had some pretty serious arguments and they've gotten physical. She has hit me, thrown things at me, thrown my clothes in the trash, poured coffee on me, spit on me, broken some of my important personal items, and has hurt herself. Then there's almost always the verbal poison that comes out of her mouth. After the fights have calmed down, she always feels very guilty and remorseful. It sucks because I can see that she's hurting after she realizes what's happened. She's very aware that what she does isn't right and apologizes but yet the cycle often continues whenever we have our next fight.

I've always wondered why our arguments turn into fights like this. I've told her that the way she thinks can be very polarizing. She can't handle high stress situations very well either. There were times where it should've been ""us against the problem"" but it almost always turns into ""me vs her vs the problem."" Early on in our relationship she was possessive and insecure. I simply thought that I needed to try harder in order to prove to her that she had nothing to worry about. She is still very insecure. Her anxiety, obsessions and insecurities very much dictate how she lives life. I feel as though she solely depended on me to hold her down and help her navigate her emotions. At first, I was ok with doing this but after awhile it started to take it's toll. I'm filled with flaws and unresolved traumas as well, I knew I couldn't be her ""therapist"" and I told her to go back to one. 

I haven't reacted to these fights in the best way over these past couple of years. I shout, I cuss, I have said mean shit or I lock myself in the bedroom for hours because I need space to cool down. She's convinced me that I have anger issues, that I'm a narcissist, and that I also need to go back to therapy since ""she can't be the only one putting all the effort into this relationship.""

The other day, after a little argument that again snowballed into an unnecessarily big fight, something woke up in me and I decided that I was done. I told her that living separately is the best course of action to take right now. I love her but I think that this is what's best for us. This decision hurts so much but if there's a chance that we can both work on ourselves and eventually come back stronger, we should take it.

I read a post about being in a relationship with someone who has BPD and then it hit me. Years ago, when we moved into our first place together, I remembered she had told me that her therapist at the time had diagnosed her with BPD and had given her the ""Walking on Eggshells"" book. Younger me simply brushed it off, I didn't realize how much of an influence BPD would have in our relationship. 

I've been constantly questioning if I'm making the right decision but to be honest, every interaction I've had with her since we talked about separating has further cemented the idea that this is the right decision. She decided to stay with her parents this weekend. We've been texting and she constantly goes back and forth between spamming verbal poison and feeling devastated about the whole thing. She's not capable of ending this without hating me and will blame me for the direction her life is going in now.

Yet, I still love her. She has loved me in a way that no one else has and we share many great memories together. This will be painful as fuck.",2,1738407739.0,BPDlovedones,1,1.0,False

I'm planning a tea/coffee exploration tour in Yunnan for April and I've got both WeChat and Alipay apps set up with my credit card to book transport, hotels etc. 

However, the high speed train fares from Kunming to Puer quoted from Kunming to Puer are about 10-20% cheaper with WeChat vs AliPay. For example the 3-hour trip fares listed on Wechat are around 160 yuan ($23) but the same ones are $27 on Alipay.

The former is in Chinese and yuan currency whereas the latter has English and quotes US dollar prices. 

Am I being charged a foreigner surcharge for the site being available in English and in US dollars? 

Similar situation with the hotel bookings. The typical price of a decent Puer hotel is 150 yuan ($21) with WeChat, but around 200 yuan ($27) with AliPay/Trip.

1. As a sophomore, I have only just started learning some foundational knowledge in my major. I would love to know how I can leverage this to secure an internship or research opportunity. I feel like I might not be very useful in a work or research setting, as I probably wouldn’t be able to contribute to the same tasks as full-time employees.
2. Given my major, should I prioritize finding an internship or a research opportunity over the summer? I understand that it might depend on whether I plan to pursue graduate studies, but I would also love to hear insights from others in my field about whether it's better to enter the workforce after graduation or continue with further studies.
3. How does a coffee chat work, and how should I leverage my school network to find an internship or research opportunity? I’m always worried that reaching out for a coffee chat might lead to rejection or that I might be wasting the other person’s time.

This is just a bit of rant but I also want to see if others feel the same.

Waking up before sunrise and doing your sadhana first thing in the morning is always hard. Yes, the lightness and quiet of the early morning makes for an ideal atmosphere but it takes a certain resolve and commitment in your mind - that, no matter what, I have to wake up, go to the shower and start my Sadhana.

No matter how hungry or tired or groggy or how strong the urge is to drink that coffee with some biscuits and perhaps even have a small breakfast! Before you know it, it's 7am and your family is ready to interrupt your Sadhana just as you are so close to finishing the practice...

I think a busy schedule helps, a community of like minded people helps beyond belief but a strong commitment is good enough.

1if3zbs,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/1if3zbs/q_about_summer_intern_research_opportunities/,Q about Summer Intern / Research opportunities,"I am currently a sophomore international student at UCLA, majoring in Economics and Statistics. I am looking for summer internships or research opportunities related to my field, but since I don’t have much experience, I would really appreciate any advice.

1. As a sophomore, I have only just started learning some foundational knowledge in my major. I would love to know how I can leverage this to secure an internship or research opportunity. I feel like I might not be very useful in a work or research setting, as I probably wouldn’t be able to contribute to the same tasks as full-time employees.
2. Given my major, should I prioritize finding an internship or a research opportunity over the summer? I understand that it might depend on whether I plan to pursue graduate studies, but I would also love to hear insights from others in my field about whether it's better to enter the workforce after graduation or continue with further studies.
3. How does a coffee chat work, and how should I leverage my school network to find an internship or research opportunity? I’m always worried that reaching out for a coffee chat might lead to rejection or that I might be wasting the other person’s time. I don’t quite understand why someone who doesn’t know me would agree to have coffee with me and be willing to help me?

I would greatly appreciate for any advice！！！",1,1738407590.0,ucla,1,1.0,False

1if3m5v,https://www.reddit.com/r/TargetedSolutions/comments/1if3m5v/addressing_gangstalking_to_a_simpler_degree/,addressing gangstalking to a simpler degree.,"I suppose the best way to describe a program that is operated by people without proper training or an education… Is to find a way to do so on their level.  if you are struggling as a target to address the situation as it stands, it's because it's designed to be that way.  So when you do get the opportunities to tell someone about this program, describe it in a way that is less complicated than what you may be led to believe. Try to avoid words that describe nano technology and governments chasing you down because you're on some mystery list. Because none of that is true. The program is very simple like the minds of the operators on HAMS.  It's old school tech, uneducated man babies, a stolen military PSYOPS program designed to locate terrorist threats overseas, an RFID chip and a human being to do this system of attacks on. 

there is nothing about the individuals that are attacking innocent people with this program that can be said politely.  they will do everything in their power to convince a person chosen at random that the system of organize attacks is somehow all about them. To reiterate, none of this is about the target, and it never will be, no matter how much they try to convince you.  Everything that they do is done on a conscious or subconscious level. A lot of the behavioral traits that you may pick up during your system of attack will be a direct result of them subconsciously and subliminal telling you to do those things triggering your brain and your reward sensors until you do what they want you to do. They will then consciously tell you to stop doing whatever that activity is and blame it all on temptation. 

Regardless of them being a fraternal order of the Catholic Church, there are anything but men of God. As a matter of fact, they believe that they are a part of a New World order the foundations of everything that they built themselves upon were founded within this mindset. Using religion, faith, hope all this weapons against people to establish a shroud of trust. All of this was designed around the preservation of this program.  the people conducting this series of attacks on you are tempted with money and talks of climbing a proverbial ladder of command. with the promise of their safety as they provoke someone to murder while they are in some basement of house that is complete trash, a state away. ohio is the hub of all this and where they broadcast from. 

using HAM radios, voice over and a labyrinth of AI systems, all working together to trigger reactions from their psyops attack vectors... to use to claim software bounties with. these men are the equivalent to the neighborhood 5th grade bully... with out the 5th grade education.  they love to bastardize the very religion they nest within. calling the narcotics they manufacture, distribute and use ""angel dust"". the communications system 
""the voice of god weapon"". using blinding white light while driving which is all app controlled. they can make one headlight brighter than the other and gradually increase the lumens so there isn't a crime noticed by flashing. all to mock the empyrean.  seems like a waste of time on their part... but they aren't rational so that explains that. 

they don't care who you are,
what you do or what will become of you as a result of their actions. they just want to please their handlers as the soulless lapdogs they are. their communities are full of the same weak trash that will do anything to preserve the program as it's all they know. they believe they, like the slaves columbus had will be given a new place to build upon in this new world they hope to create. however they are just slaves. their 24/7 obedience to this program
is living proof of that.  the only thing that creates a common ground between them is their sexually abused pasts and the crystal meth (angel dust) they all eagerly ingest via capsule, smoke,
syringe or snorting it.  the elder members call it ""tea time"" and put it in their coffee.  i suppose the best way to insure that you have hyper fixated slaves is to provide them with the drugs to anchor them to their task.  

this is how you describe what's happening. use terms that the public understands. know that whomever you tell is going to be slightly put off and confused. anyone would be when hearing that their loved one is being targeted with an unseen force that is siphoning data for profit.  the groups conducting these attacks will try to stop you as they can hear what you're going to do and say with voice over, screen reader and neural linguistics programming. they will use tone generators to manipulate your natural frequencies causing brain fog. all to try and make you sound as dumb as they are naturally.  just pace yourself and know that the best way to describe anything is calmly and to the best of your ability.

Reasons for NC:
Interaction with him is too acutely triggering. 
I fight back and make it worse when he triggers me.
I want to maintain a friendship so we need to stop this horrible situation.
I am at my limit to handle any more triggers. 

Reasons it's short term plan for now:
He's my only practical support person.
We've been friends for nine years and I value our friendship. 
Permanent NC would cost me a lot of locations and friendships I also value.

What I am doing to avoid contact:
Muted social media notifications from him.
Keeping my phone offline as much as possible. 
Taking myself somewhere with lots of distraction possibilities. Big city, walking, browsing stores, getting coffees.
Hotel for myself for two nights. Full ability to practice autonomy and not interact with anyone so I don't have to mask.

So yeah. Any advice or support hugely helpful. Bear in mind that I'm going through a major bpd symptom flare and even thinking about a NC is huge for me. I do understand that our friendship might not be salvagable but at this point it is very valuable to me and I do want to try. And I think a temp NC is the wisest idea.

Just wondering, has anyone else been dumped before in a cruel and callous way, when you were an amazing partner?

I am codependent person in recovery, and I was in an amazing relationship for 6 months. Due to my codependency, I put my partner on a pedestal, didn’t set boundaries and I did so much for them (you wouldn’t believe how much I gave of myself and of my resources for this person). They had mental health issues, and had trauma and depression which caused their personality to change in the last month of our relationship. They started becoming distant which was incredibly painful for me - (that’s when I discovered what codependency was) then they wanted space, became more and more distant, then came the cowardly breakup text 3 x days ago (couldn’t even call or see me person). Before they changed, we’d both made promises, and were talking about forever, this was my person. After the breakup text, I wanted to let me feelings out, but I didn’t, I just send one paragraph, wishing them well in the future, and if they ever want a coffee in the future, the door was open.

Obviously there's the realisation that your parent has autism, which might be a relief in itself to have a description for why being parented by them was so difficult and hurtful and your upbringing so inadequate.

Then maybe there's realisation that their traits and behaviours are symptoms of their diagnosis and choices by them, not a fault of you. 

Hopefully by that point any self esteem issues you might have are improving and you're working on identifying and gaining any skills they didn't teach you properly.

Where do you go after that, with your relationship with your parent?
If they know about their behaviour or have a diagnosis, ideally they'd work on their behaviour and change.
But what if they don't? 
After all, you can't make them change.

My mother has autism, diagnosed about 2 years ago, no surprise, suspected for decades, level 2. Diagnosis hasn't resulted in change. And it's meant I feel angry more often and call her behaviour out more, because, to me, she knows how she is and why she's like that and has professionals to help her, but she has instead chosen to use her diagnosis to justify her identity as a victim of the world at large, and uses it as an excuse to keep choosing to behave hurtfully instead of using it as the reason to work on changing.

I have always driven and maintained the relationship. She doesn't action even specific, repeated requests to initiate contact, not dominate conversation, or remember and follow up things that are important to me. I have given her tools and advice both task-specific and generally that she should work with her professionals on it. She ignores that. She's well meaning but hurtful, accidentally rude and insulting when she does interact, long spells where she forgets I exist, has a concept of me in her head that is not me. All quite a common experience.

 I've said to her various iterations of ""put more effort in and treat me better or I won't keep putting up with your poor behaviour to have a relationship with you any more."" She's told me responses to the effect that I am being mean and discriminatory and excluding her, because that's just how she is because of her diagnosis.

Of course if I do stop putting effort in, I don't get to have a relationship with her either except for the occasional random message which is 50/50 special interest monologue, or a family emergency I can do nothing about eg a note that she thinks she might have had a stroke in the week beforehand, or grandparents are in hospital again or have died. I dread opening messages from her.

Some options that others might have tried and found helpful are:
1.family therapy (emotionally exhausting. I'm not prepared for the time or emotional committment here because I don't believe she can change)
2. Solo counselling/therapy (which she already does. No evident improvement). I think she needs more of that, but that could be because her health/social issues including autism are a special interest of her and that's all she talks about with me, so she could do that to a counsellor with a more productive result for her and relief for me.
3. I quietly stop putting the effort in but don't mention it. This seems to be the winner except again I don't get the relationship I want with her if I do this. When I waited for her to invite me to things or call, visit, write, message, I saw her three times in two years and only for things I arranged, and she only initiated contact 4 times- once for my birthday, the rest about her special interests. 
4. Maintain contact but reduce duration of direct interaction and therefore opportunity for her to hurt me. Eg, go see a movie together in cinema and sit in silence instead of trying to meet for a coffee or have a meal together with conversation.
5. Cut her off entirely with a dramatic declaration that I won't endure  being hurt anymore to get only scraps of attention from her once in a while. Except I have this irrational fear of being called a Bad Daughter by her if I give up on a relationship with her, because she's the vulnerable one.

I wouldn't feel at all bad for cutting contact if she didn't have a diagnosis, it would feel entirely justified and pragmatic as a response to her hurtful behaviour, my repeated requests to change, and her failure to do so. That's what I'd tell a friend to do. But somehow I feel that with a diagnosis, maybe I should put in more effort and put up with it, because I can, and she can't...

My sister is a master of mother management, and pretends she doesn't hear anything our mother says or see anything she does, and at most treats our mother like a wind-up-and-go monologue machine by asking how she is then tunes out the monologue and says at intervals ""wow, really"" ""how about that"" ""mm"" ""uh huh"" ""if you say so"" ""I don't know anything about that"" ""must be a reason I guess"" ""seems like a mystery"" ""better ask your counseller"" ""I'm sure you'll figure it out"" ""well times up, I guess I'd better go"" - Zero real connection which my sister hates, but our mother loves it (until being told ""times up"").

Any obvious other options that people have found useful to reduce how painful interacting is? Or to get people to put effort in and change?

It's been replaced 3 times by sage and about to be changed a 4th time due to various faults (grinder failure, leaks etc). Sell the brand new replacement or keep it without warranty and risk it?","
Basically they seem pretty poor quality in general and the unit will be out of warranty. 

I think I'll realistically be able to get £380/400 on fleebay.

I also have £150 put aside for an upgrade and have a nice enough wilfa grinder.

So, what do you think:

1. Keep the Sage and hope for the best
2. Sell the Sage and buy a basic but good espresso machine (no steam, grinder etc) as only black coffee drinkers in the house - if so which for around £500?
3. Same as 2 but get a manual pump one like a Flame?",1,1738405088.0,espresso,5,1.0,False
1if3f40,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlternateDayFasting/comments/1if3f40/week_4_of_adf_ended_results_so_far/,Week 4 of ADF ended. Results so far.,"Hi folks,

Starting Weight: 70.4kg. Current Weight: 65.33kg. Goal Weight: 60-61kg.

I concluded my week 4 of ADF. This week was also kept pretty clean, with 1-2 bowls of chicken bone broth (from chicken pho, without meat or noodles) and some coffee + monkfruit extract and maybe 2 tbsp of unsweetened macadamia milk. My hunger during fasting days aren’t as intense as first 3 weeks.

On that note, my libido has increased, and bed-stamina is better than before too. Win!

On eating days, I still keep under TDEE. Only caveat is that due to my work hours, I sometimes eat very late at night (like 1-2AM). I still make sure I am doing 36 hours on fasting days though. Whatever I consumed on eating days have never exceeded 1500 cal, actually. On the highest, it’s 1800 (which is my TDEE).

My weight loss has slowed down since most water weight has been shed. I didn’t really weigh myself on Week 3. But it looks like I lost nearly 1kg in Week 3 + Week 4. I think I am doing around 0.4-0.5kg a week, since my actual TDEE itself is low.

I aim to get an underdesk treadmill and use it together with my standing desk during work hours (WFH so no coworkers to get pissed off) and get 5k-10k steps in daily, which should raise my TDEE and shed even more fat.

I feel pretty fantastic and will keep this up until I reach my goal weight!",3,1738405060.0,AlternateDayFasting,0,1.0,False
