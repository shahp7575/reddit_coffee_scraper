I personally worked with Carl for about a year and can say that he is not only a very bad businessman but also a **threat to children.** 

Carl managed a music shop next door to the coffee shop I worked at (both of which were owned by the same person). We ended up having to fire him for multiple reasons. I will list the most concerning immediately!

1. **Carl was allowing minors into 18+ music events and selling them beer and drugs in exchange for 'favors.'** Himself and his manager Chris (no last name, left Chattanooga) would funnel in GPS girls from our coffee shop, inviting them to come back at night for shows and free drinks. This man wants to teach your kids privately 1-on-1!
2. Carl embezzled money from the venue. Plain and simple!
3. Carl stole money from artists who came to play at our shows, often times not paying artists AT ALL for their performances.
4. Carl threatened to physically attack staff working on the coffee shop side because we recognized he was kind of a sticky businessman and a bit of a creep to the girls before we had to fire him.

Anyways, sounds like a wonderful guy to leave alone with your child for an hour or two.",1,1728288595.0,Chattanooga,0,1.0,False

One such product that has been gaining traction is **Tea Burn**. But, does Tea Burn actually help with weight loss, or is it just another fad? 

In this detailed review, we’ll take an in-depth look at what Tea Burn is, how it works, its ingredients, potential benefits, and what real users are saying about it. By the end of this article, you’ll have a clear understanding of whether Tea Burn can be your ally in your weight loss journey.

# What is Tea Burn?

**Tea Burn** is a powdered dietary supplement designed to supercharge your metabolism and promote fat loss. The concept behind Tea Burn is quite simple: it can be added to your daily cup of tea, and by doing so, it claims to enhance the weight loss effects of the tea. 

According to the manufacturer, Tea Burn’s unique formulation contains natural ingredients that work together to boost metabolism, suppress appetite, and provide long-lasting energy, all while burning fat.

# Key Benefits of Tea Burn

But does Tea Burn live up to these bold claims? Let’s dive deeper into the science behind its ingredients.

[**Check Here >>> Is Ozempic or Rybelsus Better for Weight Loss**](https://creditbord.com/is-ozempic-or-rybelsus-better-for-weight-loss/)

# How Does Tea Burn Work?

Tea Burn works by using a proprietary blend of ingredients that work synergistically to support your body’s fat-burning mechanisms. The idea behind this supplement is that tea, especially green tea, is already known for its metabolism-boosting properties. Tea Burn aims to amplify those benefits by introducing ingredients that enhance the effects of the tea you’re drinking.

Here’s how Tea Burn works step-by-step:

* **Boosts Metabolism**: The ingredients in Tea Burn are designed to increase your metabolic rate, allowing your body to burn more calories, even at rest.
* **Thermogenesis**: Tea Burn promotes thermogenesis, a process where the body produces heat, burning more calories in the process.
* **Appetite Suppression**: By reducing your hunger and cravings, Tea Burn helps you consume fewer calories throughout the day, contributing to a calorie deficit.
* **Energy Boost**: Tea Burn also contains ingredients that provide a clean energy boost without the jittery feeling often associated with other weight loss supplements.
* **Fat Oxidation**: By enhancing fat oxidation, Tea Burn helps your body utilize stored fat for energy.

# Ingredients in Tea Burn

Tea Burn’s formula is made up of a few key ingredients, all of which are backed by research for their ability to support weight loss. Let’s take a closer look at each ingredient:

# 1. Green Tea Extract

Green tea is one of the most popular ingredients in weight loss supplements, and for good reason. It’s packed with antioxidants, particularly EGCG (Epigallocatechin gallate), which has been shown to boost metabolism and enhance fat burning. Studies suggest that EGCG helps increase the breakdown of fat in your body, allowing it to be used as energy more efficiently.

**Research Insight**: Studies have found that green tea extract can boost calorie burning by 4% and fat oxidation by 17%, even at rest.

[**You May Like >>> How To Get Free Government Tablet**](https://creditbord.com/free-government-tablet/)

# 2. L-Theanine

L-Theanine is an amino acid commonly found in tea leaves. It’s known for promoting relaxation and reducing stress levels. One of the key reasons this ingredient is included in Tea Burn is because stress and high cortisol levels can lead to weight gain, especially in the abdominal area. By promoting a calm and relaxed state, L-Theanine helps balance your hormones and can indirectly support weight loss.

**Research Insight**: A 2016 study found that L-Theanine, in combination with caffeine, can lead to enhanced cognitive performance and improved fat oxidation during exercise.

# 3. Chromium

Chromium is an essential mineral that plays a role in regulating blood sugar levels. By maintaining stable blood sugar levels, chromium helps prevent cravings and hunger spikes that can lead to overeating. It also helps your body metabolize fats and carbohydrates more efficiently, further supporting your weight loss goals.

**Research Insight**: Research shows that chromium supplementation can reduce body fat and promote lean muscle mass in individuals trying to lose weight.

# 4. Caffeine

Caffeine is a well-known stimulant that increases metabolism and enhances fat burning. It also provides an energy boost, helping you stay active and focused throughout the day. In combination with the other ingredients in Tea Burn, caffeine helps you stay energized and burn more calories, even during workouts.

**Research Insight**: A 2019 study in the *American Journal of Clinical Nutrition* found that caffeine increases fat oxidation by 10-29%, depending on the individual’s body fat percentage.

# 5. Chlorogenic Acid

Chlorogenic acid is found in coffee beans and is known for its fat-burning properties. It helps to slow the absorption of carbohydrates in the gut, which reduces blood sugar spikes and can prevent fat storage. Chlorogenic acid also promotes fat breakdown and helps regulate cholesterol levels, further aiding weight loss.

**Research Insight**: A 2020 study showed that participants who took chlorogenic acid experienced significant weight loss and reduced body fat compared to the control group.

# Tea Burn and Weight Loss: What the Research Says

The ingredients in Tea Burn all have a solid backing in scientific research for their ability to support fat loss and improve metabolic health. However, it’s important to note that weight loss supplements like Tea Burn work best when combined with a healthy diet and regular exercise.

The combination of ingredients in Tea Burn provides a multi-faceted approach to weight loss by:

* Boosting metabolism

* Providing clean, sustained energy

To get the most out of Tea Burn, it’s recommended that you follow the instructions carefully. Simply add one packet of Tea Burn to your daily cup of tea, and drink it either in the morning or early afternoon. Since it contains caffeine, it’s best to avoid taking it late in the day to prevent any disruption to your sleep.

For best results, combine Tea Burn with:

* A **balanced diet** rich in whole foods like fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats.
* **Regular exercise**, especially a combination of cardio and strength training, to enhance fat burning.
* **Hydration**: Drink plenty of water to support your metabolism and keep your body functioning optimally.

Tea Burn is made from natural ingredients and is generally considered safe for most people. However, some users may experience side effects, especially if they are sensitive to caffeine. These can include:

* Jitters
* Restlessness
* Headaches
* Upset stomach

If you are pregnant, nursing, or have any underlying health conditions, it’s always a good idea to consult with your healthcare provider before starting any new supplement.

# Verdict: Is Tea Burn Worth Trying?

In conclusion, **Tea Burn** offers a promising solution for those looking to boost their weight loss efforts naturally. Its blend of metabolism-boosting ingredients like green tea extract, L-Theanine, and caffeine, coupled with appetite-suppressing agents like chromium, make it a well-rounded supplement for fat loss. While Tea Burn won’t work miracles on its own, when combined with a healthy lifestyle, it can help you reach your weight loss goals faster.

Based on the research and real user reviews, Tea Burn seems like a worthwhile addition to your weight loss routine, especially if you’re looking for an easy-to-use supplement that fits into your daily tea habit.

We started seeing each other during the summer and decided that it would be light-hearted and fun. Basically, we're not exclusive, but we still don't see other people because we're ""enough."" The basis is that we keep seeing each other because we want to, and if not, we just have to tell the other person. However, it feels as if now that I'm so unimportant that it makes me feel unattractive or undesirable to him. It's quite delicate cause I guess it's so subjective, but here we go. At first, we used to see each other in the evenings. He would walk me home, and we'll talk for hours at the front gate. We would just go out to drink, see a film, stay at his place or mine. Now it has changed, and I knew that it would be since we were studying again. Whenever we see each other (almost once/twice a week), it's in between his classes or before he's meeting someone else. As in, he has a few hours for me, and then he has a drink (sometimes several likes, he's meeting a group, then another) with people. He told me that he felt bad we weren't seeing each other as much, but personally, I don't care. I told him that meeting up once a week was fine. But then he told me that he felt like a minister allocating time slots for people. He also said the way this is going to end is by him not having enough time and that I should know that he cares for me.

I can tell that he's making a lot of effort, which is why I feel bad that what bothers me is exactly what he said. What pushed me to write this was yesterday. I didn't mind that much before, but yesterday we were supposed to go thirfting in the afternoon. In my mind, that meant that I'll be spending the entire afternoon with me, especially since he told me that he had spots to go to and that I should prepare myself for a long walk. But as I arrived I found out that he was seeing a friend late in the afternoon and after that he was seeing friends for a drink. To be short, we ended up staying at his place and going for a coffee afterwards. His friend cancelled on him, so we had more time together, but it felt as if I was just there to fill in the time before he was meeting his friends. He was kind of zoning out at one point. We also saw each other after his work. I just think that he could've taken this time to be alone. It's like he saw a break/free time and thought that I could be around. It doesn't feel as if he wants to see me, but that I'm just there. Also, he asked me about my week, and I kept repeating the same four names, and he made a joke out of it. It felt sort of disrespectful. Respect my friendship, please. I want to dedicate my time to them because I love them and I feel completely myself with them. I'm fine with a few close friends rather than seeing a bunch of people who would drain me. I'm sacred that he's going to feel that way. I mean, he told me that he already felt drained and burnt out. But he doesn't want to slow down? 
Also, sometimes, I make jokes, and he shuts them down (in a jokey tone), but still, it makes me feel awkward and questioning why I am even here. For example, when we got dressed, I told him he'll be cold, and laughing that he'll text me, he's freezing. He answered in a sort a serious tone, ""Why would I text you that?"" I don't know, mate, can't you just laugh with me, ffs? And also final little thing that I'll add, yesterday I was telling him about the German figure of speech, a constellation of people, saying that's what he had, and he answered that I was one of many. I just feel very unimportant, and it's not even that it needs to be more, but don't make me feel that way when we're together. I want to keep seeing him, but if it stays that way, it won't work.

I'm fine with a few close friends rather than seeing a bunch of people who would drain me. I'm sacred that he's going to feel that way. I mean, he told me that he already felt drained and burnt out. But he doesn't want to slow down? 
Also, sometimes, I make jokes, and he shuts them down (in a jokey tone), but still, it makes me feel awkward and questioning why I am even here. For example, when we got dressed, I told him he'll be cold, and laughing that he'll text me, he's freezing. He answered in a sort a serious tone, ""Why would I text you that?"" I don't know, mate, can't you just laugh with me, ffs? And also final little thing that I'll add, yesterday I was telling him about the German figure of speech, a constellation of people, saying that's what he had, and he answered that I was one of many. I just feel very unimportant, and it's not even that it needs to be more, but don't make me feel that way when we're together. I want to keep seeing him, but if it stays that way, it won't work. I want to talk to him this week. How should I go about it? Is what I am saying unfair or unreasonable?",1,1728287584.0,AITA_Relationships,0,1.0,False

So, this is a throwaway because well obviously (I want my anonimity) . Here’s some background: I (28F) have been married to my husband (32M) for five years. We met in college, fell in love, and got married pretty quickly after we graduated. At first, everything seemed perfect. He was caring, attentive, and we had similar goals for the future.

But then, about two years into our marriage, things started to shift. It started small—he’d ask why I bought something extra for the house or why I went out with friends for lunch. I figured it was normal, we were budgeting, after all. But over time, it got worse. He began questioning every little thing I spent money on—whether it was groceries, clothes, or even things like personal hygiene products.

One day, I found a notebook in his drawer. In it, he had written down every single purchase I’d made over the last six months. I’m talking from the big stuff to the smallest expenses like a $2 coffee. When I confronted him, he didn’t deny it. He said that it was his “duty” to make sure I wasn’t wasting our money. He even suggested I should quit my job because “I wasn’t contributing enough.” For context, I work full-time, but he makes more than I do.

I felt completely suffocated. He began checking my phone regularly, showing up at my work unannounced, and making comments about what I wore, what I ate, and who I talked to. I tried to justify it for a while, telling myself that maybe I wasn’t being responsible enough, that maybe I was in the wrong. But deep down, I knew this wasn’t normal.

Last month, things escalated. He got angry because I bought a new jacket for winter (which I needed since my old one was falling apart). He yelled at me in front of our neighbors, calling me irresponsible and selfish. That was the breaking point for me. I packed a small bag and left to stay with my sister.

Since then, he’s been blowing up my phone, begging me to come back, saying I’m overreacting and that he’s just trying to “protect” our finances. My sister and some friends think I did the right thing by leaving, but a few others (mostly his friends) are telling me I’m being dramatic and that all couples have issues with money. They’re saying I’m the AH for abandoning him without talking it through.

1fy26wm,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_crimsondrafts/comments/1fy26wm/chapter_5/,Chapter 5,"I stared at the ridiculous mountain of dishes piled in my sink. How had I let it get this bad? A mug with a dried coffee ring caught my eye, and I wrinkled my nose at the faint smell that had settled into my kitchen like an uninvited guest. Great. First, I can’t write a decent sentence, and now I’ve officially crossed the line into slob territory.

Grabbing the offending mug, I tossed it into the sink with a loud clatter, wincing when it knocked into a plate I was pretty sure had once held spaghetti. Or maybe soup? The details were fuzzy.

This was fine. Everything was fine.

“Next stop, eating cereal for dinner and watching reality TV marathons,” I muttered to myself as I rolled up my sleeves. “Maybe that’s my new career path—reality show binge-watching and cereal reviewing. God knows it’s not writing murder scenes.”

I turned on the tap and let the water run, watching it swirl down the drain as if it had all the answers. What would Cade have to say about this? Probably something annoyingly cryptic like, Real life is messier than fiction, Isla. Let things fall apart.

I huffed, grabbing a sponge and scrubbing at the crusted coffee stains. Who says that? Let things fall apart. Easy for him to say. He wasn’t the one staring at a blinking cursor every day, wondering if his best writing years were already behind him. And he definitely wasn’t standing in a kitchen debating whether the smell coming from his fridge was expired milk or something worse.

Maybe I’m thinking too much, I told myself, scrubbing harder. But how could I not think about him? Cade just showed up, waltzing into my life with all the mystery of a bad noir film. Talking about murder like it was an everyday topic, like we were discussing the weather or last night’s game.

And why couldn’t I get him out of my head?

The water splashed up onto the counter, soaking my sleeves. “Perfect,” I groaned, grabbing a towel and dabbing at the wet spot. Was this my life now? A series of minor inconveniences, each one piling up like those dishes until I was buried under the weight of my own incompetence?

I needed a break. A real one. Something more than just escaping into a bookstore and hoping for inspiration to magically hit me in the middle of the mystery section.

I dried my hands and glanced at the stack of mail that had been sitting unopened on the kitchen counter for—what? A week? Maybe more? Whatever. Bills didn’t go bad.

I reached for the top envelope, tearing it open with a little more force than necessary. It was a reminder from my publisher. Deadlines. Of course. Because what I really needed was more pressure.

A deadline I wasn’t even close to meeting. A book I hadn’t even started.

I tossed the envelope onto the growing pile of things I was ignoring and slumped against the counter. What was I doing? It felt like my entire life was on pause, but not in the fun, “let’s take a break and go to Paris” way. More like the “everything’s piling up and I’m just standing still” way.

My phone buzzed on the counter, pulling me from my spiraling thoughts. I reached for it, half-expecting another reminder from my editor or—God forbid—another lukewarm review. Instead, a message from my best friend, Violet, lit up the screen.

Violet: Drinks tonight? Or are you still drowning in self-pity?

I snorted. Violet had a knack for cutting straight to the point. She had been hearing me complain about my writing block for weeks, and I was pretty sure she was one more sad text away from staging an intervention.

Me: Self-pity, mostly. But I guess I could come up for air.

Her reply was instant.

Violet: Good. I’m dragging you out. No excuses. 8pm at The Local.

I stared at the message for a moment, a half-smile tugging at my lips. Maybe she was right. Maybe what I needed wasn’t more time alone in my head, replaying conversations with mysterious men who showed up unannounced. Maybe what I needed was a night out with my best friend and a couple of stiff drinks.

And maybe—just maybe—I’d finally stop thinking about Cade.

Yeah, right.

I glanced back at the dishes, the sponge still sitting in the sink like a sad reminder of my unfinished task. Screw it. The dishes could wait. For now, I needed to get out of my head and into the real world.

I slipped my phone into my pocket and headed toward my bedroom to get ready, but as I passed by the mirror in the hallway, I caught a glimpse of myself. My hair was still in that messy knot I’d tied earlier, and there was a distinct coffee stain on my sweatshirt that I hadn’t even noticed before.

I sighed, running a hand through my hair. “Okay, Isla,” I muttered to my reflection. “Time to pull it together.”

1fy25f7,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Subjectivise/comments/1fy25f7/chapter_one/,Chapter one,"The air was thick with the stench of burnt coffee and unspoken secrets in the dimly lit diner nestled on the outskirts of Washington, D.C. The flickering fluorescent lights cast long shadows over the battered vinyl booths, where patrons rarely exchanged more than glances. In the far corner, behind a stack of newspapers, sat Sam Holloway, his fingers tracing the rim of a chipped mug, the steam rising like the ghost of his former self.

Once, he had been a respected analyst for the CIA, known for his sharp intuition and keen understanding of geopolitical landscapes. But that was before the walls began to close in, before the shadows became too familiar. Now, he was a ghost, a specter haunting the fringes of a city that had turned its back on him.

He glanced at the clock on the wall. 8:45 AM. It was time to go. He couldn’t risk being spotted, not today. Sam slipped a crumpled bill onto the table, stood, and adjusted the collar of his worn jacket. The weight of his past pressed heavily on his shoulders as he stepped into the chilly morning air, blending into the crowd of commuters hustling to their day jobs.

As he walked, his mind swirled with the echoes of betrayal that had driven him from the agency. It had started with a single whisper—rumors of an impending economic collapse, orchestrated by those he once considered allies. It was an unfathomable conspiracy, but the deeper he dug, the more undeniable the evidence became. The truth was buried under layers of deception, hidden by the very people tasked with protecting the nation.

Just two blocks away, a nondescript black SUV waited, engine idling. Sam approached, heart pounding, as he opened the passenger door and slid into the seat. The driver, a tall man with an angular face and cold blue eyes, didn’t turn to greet him. Instead, he adjusted the rearview mirror, his gaze fixed on the road ahead.

“Are you sure about this?” the man asked, his voice low and gravelly.

Sam nodded, the determination in his gut fighting back the anxiety. “I have the documents. Everything is in there. It’s bigger than anything I’ve ever encountered.”

“Are you prepared for the consequences?” The driver glanced at Sam, and the weight of that question hung in the air like a thick fog.

“Consequences? I’ve lived with consequences ever since I uncovered what they were planning. It’s time the public knows the truth.” Sam’s voice cracked slightly, the weight of his words grounding him in a reality he could no longer escape.

The driver’s lips twitched, a fleeting smirk. “Truth is a dangerous game in this city.”

They pulled into a narrow alley, away from prying eyes, and Sam reached into his bag, retrieving a flash drive. It was small, innocuous, yet it held the evidence that could shake the foundations of power. Inside were documents, emails, and memos that painted a chilling picture: high-ranking officials colluding with international corporations to orchestrate a controlled economic collapse that would leave millions vulnerable and desperate.

As Sam handed over the flash drive, the driver’s expression hardened. “Once this is out, there’s no going back. You’ll be a target.”

“I already am a target,” Sam replied, the fire igniting in his chest. “If I don’t do this now, I’ll never forgive myself.”

“Fine. I’ll get it into the right hands,” the driver said, pocketing the flash drive. “But you need to lay low. For now, the best thing you can do is disappear.”

Sam’s heart sank at the thought. He had spent the last two years trying to fade away, and now he was being pushed back into the shadows. “Where do I go?”

“Find a place far from here. You have to stay out of sight until this blows over. I’ll contact you when I have news,” the driver replied.

With a curt nod, Sam opened the door and stepped back into the bustling city. The reality of his choice hit him hard; he was a fugitive, thrust into a world of deceit and danger. He watched the SUV pull away, leaving him alone in the cacophony of the street.

As he navigated the crowded sidewalks, a sense of dread washed over him. He had entered a game he could no longer control, and he had no idea how deep the conspiracy went or who he could trust. Each face that passed him felt like a potential threat, a reminder that the truth was a dangerous weapon—and he was now wielding it.

The sound of a distant siren cut through his thoughts, and Sam instinctively ducked into a side street, the weight of his decision settling heavily in his gut. He needed to figure out his next move, but the clock was ticking, and the shadows were closing in.

Same result you say, no it's not, a more clicks to pay for and more time to qualify with 25% of the clicks converting and asking for more info.   
  
If you can remove the tyre kickers before they ask for more info, you have less work and thus better results.  
  
In order to grow a business you need great leads and great sales.  Sell your way out of trouble.   


Nit picking the cost of coffee and sugar for tea breaks is never going to save your business.

I was attracted to him and made it known and clear that my intention to date is to marry. Due to his work nature (working at oil-rig platform), it allows us to only meet once a month. Fast forward we decided to have a short vacation together for 3 days, that is when I figured that he only sees me as his friend/companion with ''benefits''. It was great he paid everything, but then I just feel there is no emotional connection between us and he's not being romantic at all (not holding hands, even when we went for a walk at the beach, he would kept distance like 50m away from me). After the vacation, I then began to realize that we are technically do not know each other much, he would update me about his routine etc, but I feel something is missing. When he went back to his home-country, I was somehow getting emotional as I began to see that he does not actually plan to have any future with me. He hold me onto him, just because I am the only person that he knows in my country and someone that can bring him around for coffee/dinner. It is also noticeable that he will only want to see me just for a night/two once he reached onshore then he will be off somewhere-else. I then decided to cut him off completely. (but his defense was I'm always complicate things, and should have just go with the flow)

Fast forward 3 months later, I was not happy with my current work situation, and reached out to him if he has a business that requires a staff to manage (throughout our so-called relationship, he has always been wanting to do a business and/or want me to manage it). He then said he has one and would like me take charge. He also said that he did this out of sympathy as he knew how I hate my job. We had a video call few days later to discuss about this new job. He then mentioned about he has been liking me from the start, but he thinks I'm way too stubborn. He convinced me to resign the job and work for him, which I did. My final day will be this week, and guess what, he is missing in action since last Friday, not responding to any of messages nor calls.

I (26 M) was seeing this beautiful lady (21 F), probably 3 weeks now, we had known each other before but she was in a relationship at the time and i was in one as well. We went out for a date and things were great, we talked almost every minute of the day, nice little videos ootd, calls, voice notes. I really opened up to her, really really opened up, and she did to me as well, or so i thought. Her last relationship ended about 4 months before we met, i figured she hadnt healed enough but i didnt push for her to get into a new relationship with me so soon although we agreed we are building this into one. We have done the did once, we kiss, cuddle, watch movies, she comes to my place a lot, etc. I really thought we were in a good place looking to build this relationship. Last week on friday she texts me saying she doesnt feel a spark between us and she does not want to be in a relationship right now, she wants to explore. I said okay, fair enough since she just got out of another relationship and i was not pushing. What crushed me the most is that for the three weeks I feel like she used me, she called, texted, our conversations were always on we'll do this, we'll do that, our expectations getting into this new phase of our lives. I knew with surety we were heading that direction. I feel like she really led me on cause she always wanted to know all these deal breakers etc, typically things you ask getting into a relationship. Worst off she concludes her break up text by telling me i hope i find my person and that she would love for us to still get coffee once in a while, what! i wasnt even looking for anyone before you. I dont think i did something wrong and she acknowledged that everything is okay with me and it was more of her, but why did she do that?? I want to know, has this happened to any guy out there before and ladies, is there a reasoning behind this? After that day I said i am not going to talk to her again, said my goodbyes and accepted that maybe she just wasnt for me. Saturday she calls me asking how im doing, what i am up to, she still sends me tiktoks on where we should go get food, shop etc, as i am typing this she has texted wishing me  a good day and asking how work is.

Husband and I got married 18 months ago. We actually eloped and had only our photographer and her assistant as witnesses. The day was incredible and we wouldn’t change a thing. 

Our photographer was easily the biggest expense of our entire elopement. She cost 10x my dress and more than our accommodation for our five day trip. She’s won prizes and has a huge following on social media. On the day she and her assistant were amazing. They were so friendly and stayed way longer than we had booked them for. The photos are incredible and we got sent a preview gallery only days after. 

After that, a few things happened that kind of dampened our enthusiasm. First, we had very specific shots taken at an unusual location that was special to us. They were my idea and something I detailed in emails before hand. A month later she posted almost identical shots with another couple with a caption saying that she was offering packages with this kind of shot. We were a bit disappointed but shrugged it off as a risk of using someone with such a big social media presence. 

However, following on from that, we just didn’t receive any prints, any info on how to order prints, the USB we were promised or our photo book. Eventually, two days before our first anniversary, and after a lot of chasing, we received the prints we had selected, beautifully packaged but with no note/card or anything. We’ve just clicked now that we’d also paid for an 80 page, hardbound photo book and have never received it. 

I’m wondering if this is a common experience? Or maybe we did something wrong? Or should I send her some private feedback? Like I said, they were amazing on the day, but our “after sales” experience has left a bad taste. We sent thank you cards as soon as we got home but didn’t do gifts. Surely that’s not why?? Based in the UK where tipping is not customary. Considering the amount we paid, we did not tip but did buy in special food for them to share lunch with us, bought them coffees on the day etc. ",1,1728286296.0,wedding,0,1.0,False
1fy2128,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fy2128,Am I being manipulated? Am I the manipulator? no,"Me (22M) and my girlfriend (21M) of 2 years had this conversation tonight. We spent nearly every day together last school year, as I was helping her through some mental stuff and took care of her when she needed help. I put her own needs above my own constantly and am really trying to make this relationship work because I really love her. I love spending time with her, as we’ve both said we’re each other’s best friend. The only issues we’ve ever had were in May of last year, where she said she was losing attraction. She has since claimed to have gotten over that. 

She talked multiple times this summer about spending less time together so she can spend more time with her friends, doing activities, and time by herself. I am disappointed but I understand and have told her I absolutely support her in doing this. Since the school year has started, though, we’ve still been spending a good amount of time together. I’ll meet her for coffee during the day or she’ll come over to my apartment after sorority rush. 

The kicker is that she is always the one initiating time together. She invites me for coffee and dinner. She asks to come over to my apartment. I am more than happy to oblige because, as I said, she’s my best friend and I love spending time with her. She has not been on top of her work or her health this past week and I feel like she’s blaming it on me, despite the fact that I believe that I have been nothing but helpful to her and have been encouraging her to do her work and helping out with her health. 

My question is: did I handle this conversation well? I want to make sure I’m not being manipulative, combative, or otherwise not seeing this situation for what it is. Would love advice on how to better communicate with her, and also, how to navigate this in the future. 

I feel like I’m being manipulated into thinking this is my fault, but when I call her out, she defends herself by saying she’s just thinking out loud. I also am afraid I’M manipulating her by being too apologetic and deflecting the conversation towards an argument rather than just hearing her out. Thoughts?",3,1728286089.0,Manipulation,15,1.0,False

I'm tired of feeling so alone. 

So about two years ago, I started getting that pain on the upper left side of my stomach. Some mild nausea and cramping, along. Then constant stomach gargling and burps. It was annoying but that was all. I went to the ER once and nothing was found in the blood test and ultrasounds, so they said I had gastritis without further verification. I knew it was caused by anxiety and malnutrition as I was 17 living on my own and barely knew how to cook. But then I started waking up with nausea, dry mouth, lots of pain, and night sweats. Since I'm always told I'm overreacting, I didn't do anything about it. Lost so much weight over the time now people are getting worried. So am I. I'm 19 and I'm tired of this. The fatigue and anxiety is one thing, the pain another. Now the pain is mainly located at the left side of my back, going from chest to back. I have muscle spasms and very low energy, I never felt so weak. Trust me I never cry, but I've been crying about how sick of this I am. I just want my normal healthy body again, It feels like I'b be stuck in this forever. But to be honest, I didn't help myself. Had some ice cream, some coffee, some sweets here and there. Fatty foods are the worst actually. I should have sticked to the bland diet but I felt miserable. Now I'll try it again. I want my life back. I want my sleep back. I want my old self back. The anxiety tells me it's probably smth dangerous all the time and it's exhausting to live in this fear.

A part of me is tempted to ask for X-Rays and an H.Pylori test, but ik my doctor will brush me off. Should I insist ?

I appreciate you stopping by to read this. If you’re here, maybe you’re like me—looking for something genuine and meaningful, with the hope it blossoms into something lasting and beautiful.

I’m a 37-year-old based in Riverside, California, but I’m open to connecting with someone across the West Coast, the US, or even Canada. For the right connection, distance can be an adventure worth embracing.

A little about me: I find joy in life’s simple pleasures—cooking together, having deep conversations over coffee, or hopping into the car for spontaneous road trips to explore new places. I’m ready for a long-term relationship that builds toward a future full of love, partnership, and family. I envision a life where laughter, shared experiences, and heartfelt moments are the foundation of our bond, all with the goal of creating a warm, loving home and building a family.

As a first-generation American, I’ve embraced the mix of cultures and values that have shaped me. I’m spiritual, connected to nature, and grounded in respect for mutual boundaries and trust. What I’m looking for is someone who shares these values and is equally passionate about building a future together focused on love and family.

If you’re looking for more than just surface-level conversations and want to explore the potential for something real, I’d love to hear from you. Let’s start by talking, and if the vibe is right, maybe we can move to a voice or video call—because life’s too short for endless texting!

The Delhi government recently decided to shame Cognizant further.

They revised the minimum wages for workers in Delhi.

- Non-matriculate semi-skilled workers are now supposed to get Rs. 19929 per month.

- Matriculate workers will get Rs. 21917.

- Graduates will earn way more than graduates appearing for Cognizant roles: Rs. 23,836.

I Destroyed My Husband's Life for My Lover, and Now I Regret It After His Suicide Attempt   
  
  
  
  
I never thought I’d feel this way. Not after everything I did to him. But today… today changed everything.  
I was sitting at the kitchen table when my phone rang. It was his sister, Charlotte, her voice shaking as she tried to get the words out. “Nicole… it’s John. He—he tried to kill himself.”  
The world stopped.  
My heart, cold as it had become over these past few years, pounded in my chest. “What?” I gasped, dropping my coffee mug, letting it shatter on the floor.  
“John… he took a bunch of pills. The neighbors found him in time, but Nicole… he’s in the hospital. He… he left a note.”  
A note? For me?  
Suddenly, everything rushed back. The arguments. The lies. The betrayal. I thought I could walk away from it all without a care in the world. But hearing those words? Knowing that I had pushed him to this point… that wasn’t part of the plan.  
“Is he going to be okay?” I asked, though the question felt hollow. A few months ago, I would’ve pretended not to care. But now, the fear of what I had done wrapped around me like a suffocating blanket.  
Charlotte was quiet for a moment before answering, “Physically, yes. But Nicole… you need to be here. You need to fix this.”  
Fix this? How could I fix what I had broken so completely? I did this. I ruined him. I didn’t care when I ripped his heart out, but now… now that he’s lying in a hospital bed, it’s like the weight of my choices hit me all at once.  
I hung up without saying goodbye, my hand shaking as I set my phone down. John… my husband… the man who loved me unconditionally. And I destroyed him. I thought I’d feel invincible. Powerful. I was wrong.

We were together for 10 years, married for half of that time. But the last two years together were terrible. We divorced but kept communicating. Every once in a while we would go get dinner together or coffee.

Today she informed me that she and her new bf will be trying for a baby. That just broke me today, I felt such pain, both emotional and physical. She knew I wanted to have kids with her when we were together. But we never did because she was never ready.

I don't think she had any intentions to hurt me. She was so happy to share that news with me and was looking for my praise and support that she finally wanted it and was ready. 

For most following conversations my brain just tuned off. I congratulated her and managed to end dinner early. 

I have never been so upset in my entire life. I accepted that we were no longer together, and I thought I moved on. For the first time in a long time, I went from feeling indifferent to what was happening in her life to being upset. I don't even know why I'm hurt. 
Is it my ego, that some guy managed to woo her more in two months than I did in a decade? Is it because that finally means there are no chances for us - I was okay with that, I was the one who wanted to end the relationship, and I still think that was the right decision.

but the reward of getting coins in a little app? tell me why that works so well! i joined a party yesterday— i had a really long day today that concluded a pretty bad work week of 10 days straight of work. i was ready to just completely melt in front of my computer (and i mostly have all evening!) but an hour before midnight i looked at the challenge we’re working on and thought to myself, i have the energy to do some dishes at least. then that turned into: while im at it i’ll clean for ten minutes and see where that gets me. 

and i never thought ten minute cleans were for me! i always thought of myself of a do it all at once type of person. i feel kind of dumb that i never realized how much a ten minute clean refreshes a room sooo much. i always thought it would barely matter! 

so tonight when i normally would’ve just went to bed and started my day off overwhelmed with a messy space and dirty dishes, i get to start my day off with a (mostly) clean space and an empty sink! 

anyways, thats my long winded way of saying right now, this really helps me and i’m very glad :)",6,1728284534.0,habitica,0,1.0,False

For dinners, drinks, catch ups, walks, coffee, etc. And I live with my partner and 2 cats and dog. But I find myself comparing myself to my friend who is constantly searching for new friends. She is one of my closest friends and we text every day and see each other quite frequently in my opinion, but then I see her on Facebook groups constantly commenting on other girls pictures asking to meet up for coffee. I don’t know, I know I am just looking into this too far, but it kind of bothers me a bit like I feel like just one of the many, and not very important or special. 

Otherwise I feel very satisfied and content in my solitude and quiet time with my partner. So maybe I’m just one of those people who doesn’t need a huge friend group and a full social calendar? And I shouldn’t compare myself to her.

We've been friends since we were really young, so we're pretty close and we hang out often. About a month ago, I took her to my religious club at my university because she wanted to try it out. I'm not religious, but my parents are and they absolutely freak out when I don't attend.

Anyways, I took her to the club, and after we went out for coffee. She told me she didn't really enjoy the overall vibe of the place, but she thought a guy at the club (21M) was attractive. The guy and I were sort of friends, although we never really hung out outside of the club. We hit it off really well, and he was fairly friendly, but I could never tell if he was just being nice or if he was into me. I didn't have any desire to date him. Then my friend asked me if I was interested in him, because she wanted to back off if I was.

If I'm being honest, I always thought he was a good man. He was probably the most decent man I knew. I wasn't sure whether I was interested in him or not, but I was always sort of oblivious when it came to understanding my own feelings. But I knew that I didn't want to date anyone religious because it went against my own values, and it probably wasn't going to end well for anyone. I wasn't really looking to date anyone either, so I didn't really care. I told her to go for it.

But she decided that she wasn't interested in the club, and only came once in a while. Meanwhile, I was forced to go for every meeting. I had this feeling of guilt whenever I was interacting with the guy, knowing my friend was fully into him. It wasn't like I was flirting or anything, but being aware of the fact that I was talking to a guy that my friend was into, I felt like I was being extra aware of my actions and words. Which confused me even more, because I was sure I wasn't into him.

A month passed, and a couple days ago, he contacted me and asked me out on a date. My heart dropped because I felt like it was all my fault somehow, that I had somehow given hints to the guy. Another part of me was extremely flattered, I had never really been asked out by someone who really knew me. I couldn't tell if I reciprocated his feelings or not. But at the same time, I didn't want to date him because he was very very religious. Then I panicked some more because I wasn't feeling immediate disgust that I had betrayed my friend. She's had previous experiences with her friends stealing her crushes.

I was so alarmed I rejected him without giving a proper explanation. And I felt like I needed to tell my friend somehow about this, but I also felt so conflicted as to how to explain my side of the story. When I met up with her yesterday, I was racking up my thoughts and nerves to tell her what happened, but I got too nervous and ended up blurting out that he had asked me out. She looked shocked and I tried to explain, but I couldn't really get proper words out as I was blushing and feeling so much guilt.

She hasn't been texting me back and I know it's only been a day, but I feel so guilty- but at the same time, I don't feel like I'm the one to blame in this whole scenario. I don't know. AITA?",1,1728284462.0,AITA_Relationships,0,0.67,False

Hey everyone,

I'm in the process of furnishing my small apartment and could use some advice to nail down the design. I've got natural oak parquet flooring, and I'm visualizing a kitchen where the cabinets are in a light kashmir/sand color (I've attached a mockup).

The wooden-like cabinets, dining table, countertop, and outlets are where I'm feeling stuck.

I like the idea of the wood matching the floor, but I'm open to experimenting with other finishes for the wooden elements if it makes sense. My apartment is small, so I'm trying to keep everything cohesive and simple, especially since the carpenter making the kitchen will also do my bed and coffee table. I want everything to flow together, but l'm no design expert.

The only other thing I've decided on is a brick red or barn red sofa for the living room. Apart from that, I'm pretty flexible and open to ideas. What wood finishes, color combos, or materials do you think would work well with the oak floor and red sofa?

I appreciate any tips or suggestions!

However, even in Straya, if you say ""lets go drinking"", then, you know they are planning to get tipsy.

1fy1j86,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Loud-Astronaut299/comments/1fy1j86/quenching_your_souls_thirst_lessons_from_psalm_631/,Quenching Your Soul's Thirst: Lessons from Psalm 63:1,"It's easy to overlook our soul's deepest needs in the bustling rhythm of our daily lives. Psalm 63:1 from the New King James Version (NKJV) of the Bible offers a powerful reminder of our innate spiritual thirst: ""O God, You are my God; Early will I seek You; My soul thirsts for You; My flesh longs for You In a dry and thirsty land Where there is no water.""



This verse, penned by King David, vividly describes spiritual longing. It's not just a casual interest or a passing thought—it's an intense, almost physical craving for God's presence. But what can we learn from this ancient text, and how can we apply it to our modern lives?



First, let's consider the timing. David says, ""Early will I seek You."" This isn't about hitting the snooze button or scrolling through social media first thing in the morning. It's about making God a priority. Just as we wouldn't start our day without breakfast or coffee, David suggests we shouldn't begin without seeking God.



Next, notice the intensity of David's desire. He uses words like ""thirsts"" and ""longs,"" comparing his spiritual need to physical thirst in a desert. Have you ever felt that kind of spiritual hunger? It's a deep-seated need that can't be satisfied by material things or worldly success.



David also mentions being in a ""dry and thirsty land."" This could be literal – he might have been in the wilderness – but it's also a powerful metaphor for spiritual emptiness. We all go through ""dry spells"" in our faith journey. The key is recognizing these times and, like David, turning to God rather than trying to quench our thirst elsewhere.



Notably, David's words are personal. He doesn't say, ""O God, You are the God,"" but ""You are my God."" This highlights the intimate, individual nature of our relationship with God. It's not about following rules or traditions but cultivating a personal connection with our Creator.



So, how can we apply these insights to our lives? Start by setting aside time each morning to connect with God. This could be through prayer, reading Scripture, or simply sitting in quiet reflection. Make it a priority, just as David did.



Next, pay attention to your spiritual thirst. When you feel empty or unfulfilled, recognize it as a sign that your soul longs for something more profound. Instead of trying to fill that void with temporary pleasures, turn to God.



Finally, work on developing a personal relationship with God. Talk to Him as you would a close friend. Share your joys, fears, and struggles. Listen for His guidance in your life.



Remember, just as our bodies need regular hydration, our souls need constant nourishment. Following David's example in Psalm 63:1, we can learn to quench our spiritual thirst and experience a deeper, more fulfilling relationship with God.



What step will you take today to seek God early and satisfy your soul's thirst?

Back in the 90’s it was common for plant milk to curdle in coffee and you’d have to warm it gently, stir it at just the right speed, and often chant an incantation to keep it together. 

Now it rarely happens, but I don’t understand why. I always make my coffee the same - cafetière coffee with cold Alpro Soya Light. 99% of the time it’s fine, and then occasionally it splits and I have to chuck it down the drain. 

Any idea why? It’s just odd. Yesterday using the same carton of milk my coffee was fine 🤷🏻‍♀️",3,1728283670.0,vegetarian,5,1.0,False

Its the nature of the beast. But, every once in a blue moon/while/insert cliche, a burning sensation in us causes us to plow through pages and pages, digital or with ink and paper, and the hours get longer and before you know it, you're a couple 1,000 words in and have begun to edit and switch things that no longer make sense. Next thing you know, its 7:20, and a coffee is needed to stay somewhat alert til at least early afternoon.

And yes, the next day or so, where we reset the circadian rhythm, our minds and bodies are out of sorts. But when you look at those pages you created in a burst of pure uninfected inspiration, its worth it.

So, in closing, this is for all writers who spent what should've been a good night sleep hammering down lines on a page, and putting your vision to work, whether it be poetry, prose, or even plays and non fiction, you let that burst out of you. You created something. And no one can take that from you. Even if you can't sleep right for 3 days after.

But basically, I’m not asking for any snide remarks about “brush and floss often!” I know this, and have led myself to my own dental grave in that sense. 

Moreover, I’m looking for someone to explain EXACTLY what is going on here and what my next steps should be from here.

I boiled timothy hay, dried it, made coffee, dried the grounds after. Bagged it all up and crumbled a tiny bit of mushrooms in white chocolate in the bag. 

After a few days of shaking and observing there started to be little white ever so slightly fuzzy looking dots all around different parts of the hay. I just left it, and the next day mold, webs in it. I must have not dried the hay well enough. It makes sense. I sprinkled vinegar in the bag and the next 3 days after that, i had killed it all. The mycelium was all gone, and the only thing i could maybe find was just dead fungi/mold matter, that pretty much was decomposing well. I started a new cult with grounds only and new drops of mush choc. 

I left for a day and a half and when i was back, the vinegar dropplet bag had formed mycelium on the hay again. I made sure within the three days to saturate the coffee grounds and hay with the vinegar water mixture that was still in droplets on the top of the sealed bag. I had just figured if anything started again it would be the mush and not mold. If these grow, am i safe because mold was once in the biome/substrate?

1fy1a3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1fy1a3o/story_time_coffee_induced_anxiety/,Story time! Coffee induced anxiety.,"Okay where do we start! 

Panic attack that changed my life. Ever since that panic attack 8 years ago I had in my room that had me run downstairs and evade something that was WITHIN my own head is scary stuff… it ruined. My. Life.

I was in a state of fight or flight ever since, like legit fight or flight. I knew what not being in fight or flight felt like, and I held strong for a long time knowing that the light at the end of the tunnel was there… but while seeking it I went through hell.

The brain does weird things when you’re in fight or flight (at least for me) it made me think my girlfriend, job, family, personal look, thoughts and EVERYTHING was the issue. It created crazy scenarios, crazy everything in order to prepare me for some fight that was never there…. I’d have crazy headaches, terrible anxiety, depersonalization, derealization and everything Google tells you when you search “am I a schizophrenic.”

I quit alcohol, I quit nicotine, I tried every dies, I hopped on testosterone replacement, I went though therapy.. just anything you can imagine… but while going through this I fucking knew the light was at the end. I’d sometimes fast forward to the tunnel… but quickly my brain would tell me “ DANGER DANGER DANGER”

So this is why I’m here, I’ve tried EVERYTHING. And while trying everything I would drink coffee! Why? Because coffee is what everyone drinks.. 2 cups in the morning, few diet sodas, maybe another coffee, and a monster the next day with a pre workout. Oh and maybe some chocolate (dark) to add to that…

I tried everything, it’s like golf… sometimes you need to just readjust your grip, and it fixes everything. You can buy a new swing, a brand new driver won’t fix your swing, just a few “back to the basics” will fix it mostly.

So back to coffee, I NEVER FUCKING THOUGHT TO ELIMINATE COFFEE…………..

Here we are 1 week after I quit, after dealing with terrible muscle aches though, I’ve made it through that tunnel… and the door is welded fucking shut to that tunnel behind me… I can smell again believe it or not.. you know when you outside when you’re a kid and you can just smell things like grass or whatever small things.. well that smell is back it’s insane. I feel like myself, the person I fucking knew was on the other end… and I went through hell. Absolute fucking hell.. like I thought I was gonna die mentally. 

So why am I writing this? If you are dealing with anything I mentioned, let this be your sign. Let this be your fucking sign that the light is there and sometimes you need to just GO BACK TO THE BASICS AND READJUST YOUR GRIP! 

I’m really fucking happy now for myself, but also for anyone else who might be going through the same thing. I’m not a doctor, but before you try anything crazy like medications for anxiety (to treat a symptom) figure out what it is that’s causing it. I was very close to hopping on because I thought I can “buy a swing.”

I’m 21 and he’s 29. We were only seeing each other, and even when we had sex with others, we would share that with each other. It felt like it was more than just a typical “fuckbuddy” situation. Yesterday, he told me he wasn’t feeling horny, and I said that was fine—we didn’t need to have sex, we could just watch a movie or do something else. But he refused and said we couldn’t hang out unless we were having sex, because he likes to separate friendship and sex.

I got frustrated and told him that he doesn’t respect me or care about my feelings. I thought after seeing someone for a year, it wouldn’t be such a taboo to just hang out like friends. He says he has a busy and tiring job as a foreman at a defense company and that he has no emotional attachment to anyone.

Am I wrong to feel hurt or frustrated by this? I feel like after all this time, it wouldn’t be so hard to just spend time together without sex involved.

Is this a regional or generational thing? I would personally expect to pay upfront at fast food places, coffee shops and casual cafes and only pay at the end in restaurants and gastro pubs, but I'm told at least ten times a day by customers (generally but not always tourists, and usually by people aged 50+) that ""I've NEVER had to do this before"" or ""that's so unusual"" or ""what, even if I'm ordering food?"".

Meanwhile I saw a segment on the news (Sky I think) last week about how 1/3 of places in the UK have experienced ""dine-and-dashers"" and I can only think of a handful of places in my town that charge at the end, so I find it hard to believe that people have never paid upfront before. Is this really so unusual nationwide or is it just becoming more common in recent years? 

Edit to add: wow okay, it's unusual! Perhaps it's the number of places that ask you to order through the app that's skewing my perspective a little, but I really didn't think it would be.

Hi everyone,

I’m a 23-year-old student with a passion for sustainability and fashion. I’m in the early stages of starting an eco-friendly clothing business and want to focus on using fabrics like lotus silk, cotton, hemp, bamboo, milk, pineapple, coconut, and other plant-based fibers.

I know Vietnam is known for producing unique materials like milk fiber, coffee fabric, and lotus silk, but I’m struggling to find reliable sources or suppliers. Can anyone recommend any fabric suppliers, websites, or contacts? Any links or references would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance for your help!",1,1728282319.0,textiles,0,1.0,False

1fy15nn,https://www.reddit.com/r/FellowProducts/comments/1fy15nn/fellow_aiden_review_and_question_about_lid/,Fellow Aiden Review and Question About Lid Moisture,"I absolutely love and live on pour over coffee and used to do a grind on a Baratza with a manual pourover on a Chemex. I was an early adopter of the Chemex Ottomatic V1 and loved that too but sold it when I moved. I got a Nespresso last year for convenience but missed the pour over taste and I ended up still purchasing a lot of my coffee at coffee shops. 

The Aiden has changed that for me entirely. Unless I am driving and run out of my packed Thermos, I don't need to purchase coffee outside the home

I use Hatch Starlight beans and I freeze my beans, a Baratza Vario W+ at 6M, and single serve baskets, I brew it on a ""medium"" roast brew and the coffee is exceptional every time. I tried 7M initially for grind settings but the coffee tasted far too thin for my liking

It is a short review because I do not have anything else to say that I dislike about the machine. Even if it broke down in a year, I would purchase it again. 

My one question here is how are you guys keeping the moisture clean off the lid? Do you leave it open or just wipe it down? My preference would be to leave the whole thing open to dry but I don't want to damage the lid",2,1728282178.0,FellowProducts,1,1.0,False

**Noteworthy:** 

This week is the **1st Monday** and **2nd Tuesday** **through** **Sunday** of the month. 

Mavs are playing preseason home games on Monday and Thursday nights. The Dallas Stars home opener is Saturday (Oct 12). Note that this is also TX OU weekend, so allow extra time if taking the DART rail to AAC. 

**This weekend is TX OU Weekend.** Hotels will be full, downtown and any “party” neighborhoods will be packed on Friday and possibly Saturday night. The State Fair will be busier Saturday than any other day of the fair. DART trains will be packed. 

**Traffic Notes:** Traffic will be intense near Fair Park and along the routes to it through Oct 20, and will be **particularly so on Saturday**, Oct 12 due to TX/OU weekend.

Halloween-themed stuff has started creeping into the daily things to do, but if you want to see ***All*** Things Halloween, see my [Ultimate Guide to Dallas Halloween](https://dallasinsights.com/ultimate-guide-to-halloween-in-the-dallas-area/). For fall feels without the jump scares, see my [Guide to All Things Pumpkin](https://dallasinsights.com/ultimate-dallas-guide-to-all-things-pumpkin/). (The FREE NorthPark Center pumpkin patch opens this Friday.)

Y’all have a great week!

for a senior who wants to make the most of their last year and has semi-broken free from their strict family, what advice would you give? i know people say just show up very simply or phrase interactions as putting yourself out there, but i’d just like some concrete advice that helped you break out of your shell. esp as someone with autism i need things made very clear to me and any tactics you used to actually make true connections and not just friends you meet for coffee once a quarter would be great. i feel like i’m too definitely too late to be in friend groups which were already established earlier on either through dorms or clubs, but i feel like at such a big school like UCLA it’s hard to really find a crowd you’re absolutely devoted to unless you have the opportunity for it (which i didn’t for a good majority of my time here because of my family). but i’m not really into the surface level discussions i have here, and theoretically i’ve “made friends”, but not one i can speak to almost everyday and won’t ghost for a couple days and get back to me saying classes have been really busy for them. i understand schedules misalign especially in college, but i find it depressing people seem to stop responding even if im trying to move past small talk and suggest a hangout that works around our priorities. 

also clubs are hard because there’s so many and this year was the first time i tried EAF. i realized theres so much to explore and so much i potentially can integrate myself in but don’t know where to start..

anything helps a lot and i would love to hear your experiences making friends whether you’re a grad student, alumni, current 4th year like me, extension, etc.. :)",3,1728282153.0,ucla,2,1.0,False

And she still didn't reply so I texted her again the next day and basically asked ""am I fired or what cause if I am just let me know so I can start looking for another job"" cause at this point it had been like 2 weeks since my last work day and then when she finally answered she was like ""sorry I haven't been able to get back to you"" (first of all yes you could have girl it's been 2 MF weeks and you don't even work that often so ik you aint busy) ""i'm redoing the schedule right now and I don't have any hours for you if you want to look for another job go ahead because I don't know when I'll have hours for you again"" and so like what does that meannn like you make the schedule wdym you don't know when I'll have hours we don't even have that many employees and so like idk, I saw a video online today that lots of people were relating to about being quiet fired and so like I feel like that's what's happening to me cause like it sound like I won't have hours for literal months and my birthdays coming up soon. Idk if I should just wait till she texts me again randomly about needing me to work a shift or just say fuck her and quit and start looking for another job at a different Dunkin but like I said I really haven't been here long not even past the training period I'm still technically in training and getting paid the trainees salary but not getting any hours when I literally had 25 hours the week I got sick. I don't think I made anyone at my job angry cause I litterally just come in make coffee and mind my business. This is my first job ever so I'd really really appreciate advice or recommendations.",1,1728282055.0,Advice,4,0.67,False

I’m a 23-year-old student with a passion for sustainability and fashion. I’m in the early stages of starting an eco-friendly clothing business and want to focus on using fabrics like lotus silk, cotton, hemp, bamboo, milk, pineapple, coconut, and other plant-based fibers.

I know Vietnam is known for producing unique materials like milk fiber, coffee fabric, and lotus silk, but I’m struggling to find reliable sources or suppliers. Can anyone recommend any fabric suppliers, websites, or contacts? Any links or references would be greatly appreciated!
