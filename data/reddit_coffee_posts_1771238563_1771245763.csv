Into film, gym life, art, museums, quiet cafés, and the occasional low-key night out.

Not really into big party scenes — more into checking out spots around the city, catching a movie, grabbing coffee, or just walking around different neighborhoods.

1r68ire,https://www.reddit.com/r/PointlessStories/comments/1r68ire/ive_been_playing_a_game_with_a_stranger_through_a/,"I’ve been playing a ""game"" with a stranger through a train window for three years. Today, it ended.","I’m sitting on my couch with a cup of tea, and I feel strangely heavy. Not ""bad"" heavy, just... like a chapter of a book I really liked finally closed.

I’m a commuter. For the last three years, I’ve taken the 7:45 AM train from my suburb into the city for work. It’s a 40-minute ride. About ten minutes into the trip, the train passes a row of backyards that sit right against the tracks.

In one of those yards, there’s a house with a big, bright yellow porch. And every single morning, rain or shine, there was an old man sitting there in a rocking chair with a Golden Retriever at his feet.

It started totally by accident. About a month into my commute, I was staring out the window, bored, and we made eye contact. I gave a tiny, awkward wave. To my surprise, he shot upright and waved back with both hands, like he’d been waiting for me specifically.

Since then, it became ""our thing.""

I started sitting in the same carriage, fourth window from the back, every day. As the train approached the yellow porch, I’d put down my phone or book. I’d press my hand against the glass or give a thumbs-up. He’d be there, sometimes wearing a huge neon beanie in the winter, sometimes holding up a mug of coffee like he was toasting to my promotion (even though he didn't know me).

Once, when it was pouring rain, I held up a piece of paper that said ""STAY DRY!"" in big sharpie letters. He laughed so hard I could see his shoulders shaking even as the train sped past at 60 mph.

He was my ""7:55 AM friend."" I didn't know his name. He didn't know mine. We never spoke a single word. But on mornings when my boss was being a nightmare or I was feeling lonely in a big city, seeing that yellow porch and that enthusiastic wave made me feel like everything was going to be okay. It was a 3-second burst of pure, uncomplicated kindness.

A few months ago, the dog wasn't there anymore. I felt a genuine pang of grief. The next day, I held up a small drawing of a dog with a heart. He saw it, put his hand over his chest, and bowed his head. We shared that moment of loss through a double-paned glass window at high speed.

Well, this morning, the train slowed down near his house because of some track maintenance.

As we approached the yellow porch, I saw a ""For Sale"" sign in the yard. The rocking chair was gone. The porch was empty.

But then, I saw a younger woman—maybe his daughter—standing by the fence. She was looking at the train, clearly waiting. When she saw me in my usual window, her face lit up. She held up a large piece of cardboard.

It said: ""HE MOVED TO THE COAST. HE SAYS: THANK YOU FOR THE WAVES.""

I burst into tears right there in the middle of a crowded quiet carriage. I felt like a total idiot, wiping my eyes while a businessman in a suit stared at me, but I didn't care.

I don't think people realize how much space ""strangers"" can take up in our hearts. I’ll never see him again. I’ll never know if he liked jazz or if he was a grumpy old man to everyone else. To me, he was just the person who told me ""Good morning"" without saying a word for three years.

The train didn't stop. It kept going. But the city feels a little bit smaller today, in a good way.

Safe travels, wherever you are, my 7:55 AM friend. I hope the coast is beautiful.",1,1771245461.0,PointlessStories,0,1.0,False

Creating a stylish and comfortable living space is a top priority for homeowners today. The living room is often the heart of a home, where families gather, guests are entertained, and memories are made. Fortunately, shopping for high-quality furniture has never been easier. With Affordable Living Room Furniture Sets Online, homeowners can access a wide variety of stylish, functional, and budget-friendly options that fit any home décor style.

Online shopping has transformed the way people furnish their homes. Instead of visiting multiple physical stores, buyers can now browse curated collections, compare prices, and make informed choices from the comfort of their homes. From sofas and coffee tables to storage units and accent chairs, online stores offer everything needed to create a cohesive and inviting living room.

**Why Choose Affordable Living Room Furniture Sets Online?**

Shopping online for furniture provides several advantages that traditional retail cannot match.

**Cost Savings Without Compromise**

Affordable Living Room Furniture Sets Online allow homeowners to furnish their spaces without exceeding their budgets. Many online retailers offer competitive pricing, seasonal promotions, and bundle deals. These cost savings make it possible to achieve a high-end look while staying financially smart.

**Convenience and Time Efficiency**

Online stores eliminate the need to travel between multiple retailers. Shoppers can explore extensive selections, read product descriptions, and view customer reviews within minutes. Delivery services often include assembly options, which saves time and ensures that furniture arrives ready to use.

**Wide Selection and Variety**

Online retailers provide access to a broader range of styles, colors, and materials than most physical stores. Whether you are looking for classic designs, modern minimalism, or rustic charm, Affordable Living Room Furniture Sets Online offer diverse choices to suit every taste.

**Embracing Modern Farmhouse Furniture Living Room Designs**

Among the most popular interior trends is the Modern Farmhouse Furniture Living Room style. This design aesthetic combines the warmth and charm of traditional farmhouse furniture with the clean lines and simplicity of modern design. The result is a space that feels inviting, stylish, and timeless.

**Key Features of Modern Farmhouse Furniture**

Modern Farmhouse Furniture Living Room often incorporates natural wood textures, neutral color palettes, and rustic finishes. Distressed woods, soft fabrics, and metal accents add character while maintaining a contemporary aesthetic. The style emphasizes comfort, functionality, and effortless beauty, making it ideal for family-oriented spaces.

**Versatility and Adaptability**

One of the advantages of modern farmhouse design is its versatility. Pieces can be mixed and matched with traditional, industrial, or modern elements, allowing homeowners to create personalized interiors that reflect their lifestyle. A neutral color scheme also makes it easy to update accents, such as rugs, throw pillows, and artwork, without replacing major furniture items.

**Tips for Selecting the Right Living Room Furniture Sets Online**

To make the most of your online furniture shopping experience, it is important to consider several factors before purchasing.

**Measure Your Space**

Accurate measurements ensure that furniture fits comfortably within the room. Online stores often provide dimensions and layout suggestions to help visualize how a set will occupy your living space. Proper planning prevents overcrowding and ensures optimal functionality.

**Consider Functionality**

Think about how the living room is used on a daily basis. If the space hosts frequent family gatherings or social events, prioritize durable and comfortable pieces. Modular furniture sets or sectional sofas can provide flexibility for larger households.

**Match Your Style**

Whether choosing a Modern Farmhouse Furniture Living Room theme or another design aesthetic, ensure that each furniture piece complements your existing décor. Coordinating colors, textures, and materials creates a cohesive and visually appealing space.

**Read Customer Reviews**

Customer reviews offer valuable insights regarding furniture quality, durability, and ease of assembly. Verified feedback helps buyers make informed decisions and avoid potential issues.

**Benefits of Investing in Affordable Living Room Furniture Sets Online**

Purchasing furniture online offers benefits beyond convenience and savings.

**Streamlined Design Process**

Curated furniture sets simplify the decision-making process. Instead of selecting individual pieces separately, buyers can choose coordinated sets that create a balanced and harmonious living room.

**High-Quality Materials**

Many online retailers source furniture crafted from solid wood, premium fabrics, and durable metals. This ensures that your investment lasts for years while maintaining its visual appeal.

I need to type this out because I don't know who else to tell. My wife thinks I'm losing it. Maybe I am. But I know what I saw, and I need someone—anyone—to tell me I'm not crazy.

My daughter Lily is six. She's in that phase where she draws everything. The dog, her teacher, our house—you name it. The fridge is wallpapered in crayon. I love it. Every stick figure with its wild spaghetti hair makes me smile. That's what dads do. We stick the pictures up and we tell them it's beautiful, and we mean it.

Three weeks ago, Lily handed me a drawing of our house. It was good, for a six-year-old. She got the color right—that faded blue vinyl siding we keep saying we'll replace. She drew the red front door, the two big windows on the first floor, the two on the second floor, and the little round attic vent near the peak.

Except she also drew a window on the second floor that doesn't exist.

I didn't think much of it at first. She's six. Kids add stuff. They put chimneys on ranch houses and give dogs five legs. I stuck it on the fridge with a ladybug magnet and forgot about it.

Then she drew the house again two days later. Same window. Same spot—between our bedroom and the bathroom, on the east-facing wall. In real life, that wall is just drywall on our side and siding on the outside. No window. Never has been one. I checked the original listing photos from when we bought the place in 2019. No window.

I asked her about it.

""Lily, what's this window here?""

She didn't look up from her coloring. ""That's the window where the man watches.""

I want to tell you my blood ran cold or whatever people say in these stories. It didn't. I felt annoyed. I figured one of her friends at school had been telling ghost stories again, or she'd seen something on that damn iPad when we weren't looking. Kids say creepy shit all the time. I have a buddy whose four-year-old told him ""you were nicer in your last life."" Kids are just like that.

""What man, sweetheart?""

""The man who lives in the middle.""

I asked her what ""the middle"" meant. She shrugged the way kids do when they're done talking about something. Went back to giving a dinosaur purple spots. I let it go.

I should not have let it go.

---

Here's some context about our house. It's a 1987 colonial in a subdivision outside Raleigh. Four bedrooms, two and a half baths, 2,400 square feet. When we moved in, the previous owners had already gutted and redone the kitchen and both bathrooms. Everything else was original—including, presumably, the layout.

The wall Lily keeps drawing the window on sits between our master bedroom and the hall bathroom. On our side, there's a dresser pushed up against it. On the bathroom side, there's the linen closet. I've never given it a second thought in five years of living here.

After the second drawing, I went upstairs and stood in the hallway. I looked at that wall. It's maybe twelve feet long, running from the bathroom door to where it meets the exterior wall. The linen closet takes up about three feet of it. Our dresser is pushed against the bedroom side and covers maybe four feet.

That leaves about five feet of wall that nothing is pushed against on either side.

I knocked on it. I don't know why. I think I expected to feel stupid and move on.

It sounded different.

Our interior walls are standard drywall over studs. You knock on them and you get that hollow thud that everyone knows. This section—the section with nothing on either side of it—didn't thud. It was deeper. Flatter. Like there was more air behind it than there should be.

I told myself it was probably just a difference in insulation. Maybe a duct ran through there. Maybe the stud spacing was wider in that section. Old houses are weird. Ours isn't even that old, but whatever. I rationalized it and moved on.

Then I went outside.

I don't know what made me do it. Some nagging part of my brain, maybe. I walked out the front door, down the driveway, and turned around to look at the east side of the house. I counted windows.

First floor: kitchen window, dining room window. Correct.

Second floor: master bedroom window, bathroom window, guest room window. Correct.

And about five feet of blank siding between the bedroom window and the bathroom window. Just vinyl. No window. No patch. No outline of anything that had ever been a window.

But I stood there staring at it, and I swear to God, the spacing was wrong.

Here's what I mean. On a house like ours, the windows are evenly distributed. They line up with the rooms behind them, and the gaps between them are proportional. But the gap between our bedroom window and the bathroom window was wider than it should have been. Not by a lot. Maybe two feet. But once I saw it, I couldn't unsee it.

Two feet isn't much on a wall. But two feet is enough for something to be between them.

---

I couldn't sleep that night. I lay there staring at the ceiling while my wife Sarah breathed slow and steady next to me. I kept doing math in my head. Our master bedroom is fourteen feet wide. The bathroom is eight. The hallway is three and a half. That's twenty-five and a half feet of interior space.

I got up, went downstairs, and pulled up the county property records on my laptop. The house footprint showed the second floor as thirty-one feet across on the east-west axis.

I did the math four times. Every time I got the same answer.

There were five and a half unaccounted feet in that wall.

Not two. Not a duct chase. Five and a half feet.

At 2 AM I went back upstairs with a tape measure. I measured the master bedroom wall to wall. Fourteen feet, two inches. I measured the hallway. Three feet, eight inches. I measured the bathroom. Eight feet even. I measured the guest bedroom on the other side. The thickness of interior walls accounted for roughly another ten inches total.

I was off by five feet, four inches. There was a space inside our wall that was five feet wide and I had no idea what was in it.

I pressed my ear against the drywall in the hallway, the section that sounded wrong. I held my breath. The house was dead silent—that 3 AM silence where even the refrigerator feels loud.

I didn't hear anything. I think that's what scared me the most. Because I was *listening* for something, and the silence that came back was the wrong kind. You know how you can hear the difference between an empty room and a room where someone is being very, very quiet?

It was the second kind.

---

The next morning, I told Sarah. She gave me that look—the one she uses when I'm on my third cup of coffee and spiraling about something I read online at 1 AM.

""Bryan, it's an old house. There's probably a plumbing chase or a mechanical shaft or something. You're going to tear our wall open because Lily drew a window?""

She wasn't wrong. Not entirely. Plumbing chases exist. HVAC shafts exist. But five feet wide? Every chase I've ever seen in a residential build is maybe sixteen to twenty inches. You don't need five feet to run some PVC and copper.

I called my buddy Marcus who does contracting work. He came by that Thursday with a stud finder and an inspection camera—one of those little borescope things you snake through a hole.

We started in the hallway. The stud finder picked up framing at normal sixteen-inch intervals across most of the wall. Then it hit a section where it went haywire. The readings were inconsistent—like there was framing, then open air, then something else, then more framing.

Marcus drilled a small hole in the drywall about four feet up. Quarter inch. Nothing structural. He fed the camera in.

He looked at the screen for maybe five seconds before he pulled back.

""What?"" I said.

He looked at me with an expression I've never seen on his face before. Marcus is a big dude, built like a linebacker, and he's been doing construction for twenty years. He's crawled through attics with rat infestations and gone under crawl spaces that smelled like something died. Nothing fazes him.

He handed me the camera without saying a word.

The screen showed a narrow space—maybe five feet wide, just like I'd calculated. It ran floor to ceiling, rough framing on either side. The camera's LED illuminated raw plywood flooring. No insulation. No pipes. No ductwork. Nothing mechanical at all.

It was just a room. A tall, narrow room sealed inside our wall. No door. No window. No access point that we could see from this angle.

But that's not why Marcus looked like that.

On the far side of the space, pushed up against what would be the exterior wall, there was a chair. A wooden chair, like a kitchen chair. It was facing the interior wall—facing toward our bedroom.

And on the plywood floor around the chair, arranged in a pattern I couldn't immediately make sense of, were dozens of small, dark objects. The camera resolution wasn't great, but I could make out shapes. They looked like little bundles. Little fabric bundles, tied with string.

""Is that—"" I started.

""We need to call someone,"" Marcus said. ""Not me. Someone else. I don't—I'm not going in there, man. I'm sorry. I can't do that.""

I didn't understand his reaction until I tilted the camera up, toward the ceiling of the space.

Scratched into the raw wood of the subfloor above—the underside of our attic floor—were tally marks. Hundreds of them. Organized in neat groups of five, covering almost the entire visible surface.

And below the tally marks, in letters that had been carved slowly, deliberately, with something sharp:

**I CAN HEAR THEM SLEEP**

---

I called the police. Of course I called the police. Two officers came out, and then a detective, and then more people. They opened the wall from the hallway side—cut through the drywall in a wide rectangle. The smell came first. Not rot. Not decay. It smelled stale. Like air that hadn't moved in a very long time, but also faintly sweet, in a way that made my stomach turn.

The space was exactly what the camera showed. Five feet, four inches wide. Ran the full depth of the house, about twenty-four feet front to back. Floor to ceiling. Framed out with proper studs and joists. This wasn't a gap or an oversight. Someone had built this space on purpose. It was in the original construction.

The chair was a standard wooden kitchen chair, the kind you'd buy at a yard sale for five bucks. It was positioned facing the wall shared with our bedroom. Directly on the other side of that wall was the spot where our bed's headboard sits.

The bundles on the floor were small fabric pouches, hand-stitched from what looked like old cotton. The police collected twenty-six of them. They wouldn't tell me what was inside.

I found out later from a friend at the sheriff's department. Hair. Each pouch contained a small lock of hair, tied with brown thread. Different lengths. Different colors.

Our house has had four owners since it was built in 1987. That's four families. Multiple people in each family. People who slept on the other side of that wall, never knowing.

The tally marks on the ceiling numbered over three thousand.

The detective asked me if I'd ever noticed anything unusual in the house. I said no. Then I stopped. Because that wasn't true.

I'd always wondered why our bedroom door wouldn't stay open. You had to wedge something under it or it would drift shut on its own, slowly, like the house was exhaling. We always assumed the floor was slightly uneven. Old house. Settling.

But I realized now that the floor wasn't uneven. The wall was. Five feet and four inches of hidden space will do that. The weight distribution of our second floor was asymmetric in a way that no one had ever noticed, and it pulled our bedroom door gently closed, every single time, sealing us in.

The police found one more thing that I haven't told Sarah about. On the wall facing our bedroom, at about chest height, someone had made a hole. Not a big one. Maybe the diameter of a pencil. It went clean through the framing, through the drywall, and came out behind our dresser.

I moved the dresser. The hole was there. Clean, round, and angled slightly downward.

Toward our bed.

It had been patched on our side at some point with a tiny circle of matching paint. You would never see it unless you knew where to look. I've been sleeping six feet from that hole for five years.

---

The police are investigating. They pulled the original building permits and are trying to track down the contractor who built the house in '87. The original owner died in 2004. The second and third owners have been contacted. No one knew about the space.

But here's the thing that keeps me up at night. The thing I keep circling back to.

Those tally marks. Over three thousand. If you assume one mark per night—and the neat, methodical grouping in fives suggests that's exactly how they were counted—that's over eight years of nights.

Our house was built in 1987. The first owners lived there from '87 to '96. Nine years.

The second owners: '96 to 2008. Twelve years.

Third owners: 2008 to 2019. Eleven years.

Us: 2019 to now. Five years.

Three thousand tally marks don't fit inside any single owner's timeline. But they could fit across several.

Which means either someone sealed themselves in that space for eight straight years—no food, no water, no door—or someone has been getting in and out without any of us ever knowing.

I've looked. I've looked everywhere. There's no hatch. No hidden door. No panel. The space is sealed. Framed, drywalled, and sealed on every side. The only opening was the pencil-width hole behind our dresser.

But the chair wasn't dusty. I keep thinking about that. The bundles on the floor were carefully placed. The tally marks were sharp, not faded.

And when they opened the wall, the air that came out was stale, yes. Old, yes.

But it was warm.

---

We're staying at my in-laws' place. Lily seems fine. She hasn't drawn the house since we left. I asked her one more time about the man who watches from the window.

""He's not there anymore, daddy.""

""How do you know?""

She looked at me like I'd asked the dumbest question in the world.

""Because he left when we did.""

I don't know where we're going to live. I don't know if I'll ever feel safe in a house again. But I keep thinking about those other families—the ones who slept in that bedroom for years, their heads against that wall, while someone sat in a chair on the other side and listened.

Three thousand nights. Someone counted every single one.

And I think about all the houses in our subdivision. Same builder. Same year. Same floor plan.

There are forty-six houses on our street.

I wonder how many of them have a window that isn't there.

1r68dxt,https://www.reddit.com/r/TimeLeftApp/comments/1r68dxt/my_experience_so_far/,My experience so far,"I have been to two dozen events across 3 or 4 US cities. I have gathered or accumulated sufficient opinion on some trends. I am a mid 40s male so I get mostly 30s and 40s established professionals crown in events I attend. 

The big elephant in the room, the unspoken truth nobody really speaks publicly about or mentions during dinner events is that most people on this app specially, the singles are treating the app as dating outlet, specially with frustration with online dating apps. I met a woman there who flat out confessed she is sick of Bumble so she is using Timeleft to find an illegible men.

For the most part ratio has been balanced some events even had more women than men, but at events where it was all guys it became very awkward, and some guys mentioned how they would not attend events or dinners if it was only men, which could be very telling of intentions or reasons of using this platform, whereas some women prefer women majority turnout that hence the app introducing women only dinners in most major cities. 

The coffee events are not really timed correctly 3 PM on a Saturday is awkward timing according to many members they prefer breakfast or brunch time maybe around 11 AM on a Saturday or Sunday for coffee which makes more sense but as this app is based in Europe, maybe they think 3 PM Siesta time would work maybe be there but not in the US so far all coffee events I went to had less than 50% turn out if that too many no-shows. 

I have mixed feelings about this app. I guess I like the concept and I have definitely made a lot of connections and some friends, but I’m not sure how sustainable the model is. It might be one of those waiting for the other shoe to drop situations where it has been a trend for the past year or two until the next best thing comes along and nobody cares about this platform anymore.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

Columbia city leaders are set to discuss a proposed 1% sales tax increase to help fund operations and public safety improvements at Monday night's pre-council meeting.

The plan is expected to bring in an additional $38.6 million for the city to help pay for more police officers and firefighters.

According to a presentation for the meeting, the goal is to hire 50 police officers and 40 firefighters over the next four years. The tax would also fund a new police facility, vehicles, and two fire stations and trucks. It is also expected to bring renovations and upgraded technology for the fire and police departments.

Additionally, some of the money would go towards funding for police and fire pension plans. The current funding gap is 51% for the police pension and 57% for the firefighters' pension.

If the 1% sales use tax were to go into effect, the presentation provides examples of the increase:

$4 Cup of Coffee: Additional four cents ($4.32 to $4.36)

$12 Meal: Additional 12 cents ($12.96 to $13.08)

$100 Grocer/Retail Purchase: Additional $1 ($107.98 to $108.98)

About 32% of collected sales tax revenue comes from visitors from outside Columbia.

1r687so,https://www.reddit.com/r/moviereviews/comments/1r687so/promising_young_woman_review/,Promising Young Woman Review,"***Promising Young Woman (2020) by Emerald Fennel (Director and Writer of Wuthering Heights)***

***67% or 67/100***

*Promising Young Woman* is a great and tragic film. The film fundamentally captures the tremendous and poisoning trauma created by guilt after losing a loved one from suicide. In our protagonist’s (Cassandra played by Carie Mulligan) case she is being slowly devoured by that trauma. Not only did she lose her childhood friend Nina, but after Nina was raped at a party Cassandra declined to go to, which ultimately was the reason Nina decided to take her own life, the guilt of Cassandra no being there for her broke her. After Nina died, Cassandra died too. She dropped out of medical school and practically dedicated her life to scaring other rapists on the weekends when she’s not working minimum wage at a coffee shop. This was Cassandras way of taking power back from men who abuse it.

The narrative is well developed, but the film spends too much time muddying Cassandra’s true intentions. At certain points, we’re led to question whether she’s a serial killer targeting and murdering rapists. At others, the film suggests she may be orchestrating assaults against women who wronged Nina before her death. These moments feel designed as mini plot twists, yet they never fully land. Instead of building intrigue, they create confusion.

That said, there are larger twists that genuinely shift the story in a dramatic way. The shocking and well-executed ending, in particular, delivers a powerful final turn that recontextualizes much of what came before it.

The story itself has strong potential. With less filler, a tighter runtime, and a clearer emphasis on who Cassandra truly is at her core, the film could have been far more impactful. The cinematography is solid but unremarkable; visually competent without being especially striking. Certain scenes could have benefited from more intentional use of color and tone to heighten their emotional weight. The soundtrack, likewise, feels forgettable and lacks a compelling presence.

My biggest criticism, however, is that for a crime thriller, the film feels surprisingly dull and lacks suspense.

Overall, while the narrative foundation is incredibly strong, the film fails to match the quality in nearly every other area, falling short.

Taste: I def got a little Meyer lemon and papaya. I feel like this had a bit of a herbal tea taste in that it was quite light. It had a medium body mouthfeel. I think a brewed it correctly, as it didn’t taste sour or bitter. It was balanced. Slightly grassy taste on the back of my tongue, which is something I always detect when drinking light roasts.

1r684mu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazingCoolFinds/comments/1r684mu/problem_solved_this_kitchen_scales_accuracy_is/,Problem solved: This kitchen scale's accuracy is unreal (15% improvement measured) 🎯,"After years of intermittent baking and cooking, one product stood out for an unexpected reason: its almost uncanny precision. The OXO Good Grips 11 lb Stainless Steel Food Scale with Pull-Out Display, priced at $59.99, consistently delivered a 15% improvement in accuracy for fine measurements over my previous units. In the realm of kitchen scales under $70, this performance initially felt like an anomaly.

My testing over two months involved everything from precise sourdough starter feeding to calibrating coffee bean doses and careful portioning for meal prep. Where my old scales, including a popular Etekcity model, would fluctuate by 2-3 grams on repeated measurements of the same small ingredient, the OXO maintained a deviation of less than 0.5 grams. This was especially evident when adding small amounts of yeast or spices.

It was this minute consistency that truly differentiated it, particularly important for recipes that demand exact ratios. Cross-referencing verified user reviews confirmed the scale's claimed precision holds true in diverse home kitchen environments. *The thoughtful design clearly prioritizes reliable, repeatable readings, even if it adds a touch to the manufacturing cost.*

Here’s why it works so well:

*   **Pull-Out Display:** This is a brilliant ergonomic feature. When using larger bowls or plates, the display unit slides out from beneath, preventing shadows or obstructions from obscuring the reading. It's a small detail that eliminates a common kitchen frustration.
*   **11 lb (5 kg) Capacity with 1g/0.1 oz Increments:** It strikes an excellent balance, handling everything from a few grams of herbs to a large batch of cookie dough. The fine 1-gram increment makes it versatile for both baking and general cooking, unlike some scales that jump by larger intervals.
*   **Stainless Steel Weighing Platform:** Beyond its sleek appearance, the stainless steel surface is incredibly easy to wipe clean after spills or messy ingredients. It resists stains and odors, proving much more durable and hygienic than plastic alternatives I've used.
*   **Tare Functionality:** A simple, responsive tare button allows you to zero out the weight of containers or add-on ingredients seamlessly. This fundamental feature performs flawlessly here, making sequential ingredient additions effortless and accurate.

At $59.99, this scale is certainly not the cheapest option among kitchen scales; you're paying a premium for its consistent accuracy and smart design. My main critique is its reliance on AAA batteries, meaning no convenient USB-C charging, and it's not fully waterproof for heavy splashes.

This isn't for the budget-focused buyer who only needs approximate measurements for basic cooking. For home bakers, coffee aficionados, or anyone needing precise portion control, the investment is genuinely justified.

Is this just what it's supposed to be like in your 40s? My knees and lower back feel like theyve been glued in place overnight, like genuinely locked up, and it takes me 30-45 min of moving around and stretching before i feel like a functioning human again instead of the tin man.

Used to roll out of bed and hit the gym by 6am no problem, that was my thing and how i started every day. Now im spending that entire time just trying to loosen up enough to make coffee without wincing, and by the time i actually feel ready to work out its like 7am and i have to get ready for work. Not excruciating pain but enough that ive started skipping morning workouts bc i dont feel ready and im worried ill hurt myself trying to lift when everything feels so stiff.

Tried the usual stuff....magnesium before bed, foam rolling at night which helps for like 20 minutes, keeping the room warmer, even sleeping in compression sleeves for a while which felt absolutely ridiculous and didnt do anything. Some things help a little in the moment but nothings made a real dent in the actual problem, its still there every single morning. Anyone else dealing with this whole situation?

1r681s8,https://www.reddit.com/r/rct/comments/1r681s8/beating_an_rct3_scenario_with_only_16_tiles_4_by/,Beating an RCT3 Scenario with only 16 tiles (4 by 4 area),"The scenario I chose to beat for this challenge is Checkered Flag.

Kindly note that due to the complete randomness of the RCT3 research - it can take literally years just to specifically unlock a certain ride, for the purpose of this demonstration, I've let the game autorun for years and let it randomly decide which attraction I'll get next to show that it is entirely doable without using debug mode (either to either unlock all rides, or open the scenario editor to move a specific attraction from to invent to already unlocked)

**Setting Up the Run**

Upon starting the scenario, I used a debug cheat to remove everyone in the park, this will be the only time I'll touch debug mode in this playthrough. Afterwards, I set up this lovely 4 by 4 area in green, which will be the only tiles I'll use for this scenario.

[Setting up](https://preview.redd.it/nurfs3n2iujg1.png?width=825&format=png&auto=webp&s=f54b6988e2fbdb77df28f2c5d6c94e67941fb013)

I've closed both of Formula RCT01 and RCT02, the reasons are that because I'm only using 16 tiles, for fairness, any rides not part of those tiles that contributes to the soft guestcap shouldn't count, and secondly, this also allows me to not bother with a mechanic for those two rides. Next, I set the research to only research Roller Coasters and Shops & Facilities.

[Starting Research](https://preview.redd.it/04hfics6iujg1.png?width=916&format=png&auto=webp&s=684ee43eae5b878592092b3491158ccb3b87d984)

Initially, I tried to do both research concurrently, and then realised that what is more important is to get that one coaster type that I need for this challenge - in Oct Year 1, I finally got the Coasterball researched

[Coasterball researched](https://preview.redd.it/fcvldw3niujg1.png?width=751&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcbec28dff035f4eb4b2516581427813b6dc8e77)

Why did I chose the Coasterball? I have a custom design that can fit in a 1 by 4 area (or 2 by 4 if you count entrance/exit) as seen below, Clint left the park after taking one look at the ride and said it was too intense (as I didn't waypoint him and he left)

https://preview.redd.it/ab663hupiujg1.png?width=844&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f7bdce7c760b6aab3db4c20b79daef7674404e7

Here are the ride stats of the coaster track - this is set to 2 laps, launched at 126km/h speed, if I set it to a single lap, the ride will receive a stat penalty for not meeting the 2 lap requirement

[Coasterball Square is actually more of a rectangle](https://preview.redd.it/wr51hkoyiujg1.png?width=603&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2d4d040bbb4172d590e413b23c5a4e62b3738f9)

**Completing Apprentice Goal Requirements**

On 1 March, Year 2, I opened this setup with two Coffee Stalls selling only Mocha Coffee at $4.40 for a profit of $3.20 each, and two Western Hat Stalls selling only Cowboy Hats at $3.70 for a profit of $2.50 each

[My setup for Apprentice](https://preview.redd.it/34637endjujg1.png?width=811&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c3a88deaf67763583199f5e184f18eae12cf1c1)

I completed the $100 profit goal requirement comfortably, however, for some reason, I decided to take down the Coffee Stalls, thinking they aren't profitable if I do not have a food stall, and built a Sunglass Stall - only to realise that maybe selling Food and Drinks is actually better, and I had the right setup, just that I did not put a Burger Stall selling 3/4lb burgers which are money makers

[$100 stall profit earned](https://preview.redd.it/9lqh2psrjujg1.png?width=944&format=png&auto=webp&s=88a46470357cd1cbcbb4421718a3189cea9bf68a)

**Completing Entrepreneur Goal Requirements**

I came up with this setup for the Entrepreneur Goal where I had two Burger Stands, Two Coffee Stalls and Two Western Hat Stalls, for the Burger Stall, I only made it sell 3/4 lb burgers at the default price of $4.50, for a profit of $3.00 each

https://preview.redd.it/i7tzldd5kujg1.png?width=941&format=png&auto=webp&s=29f8e4843bbd3d13e75f172c39703bb561eadd1b

The strategy worked as I barely beat the requirements for Entrepreneur by a razor-thin margin of $1.40, but this means that I need to switch up my strategy very quickly or I'll fail the Tycoon Goal - starving my guests doesn't seem like a reliable strategy in this case

**Completing Tycoon Goal Requirements**

After Clint has left the park, it is back to the drawing board, what I did was that I got everyone out of the park, and in mid-September, I re-opened the park and launched three ad campaigns for two weeks, alongside a fourth ad campaign for six weeks for the Coasterball, without having any stalls opened

https://preview.redd.it/e8lod4lnkujg1.png?width=845&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ff66ae0cf996645aa65501a35c94335b8a9e9a5

As of 1 Oct, Year 2, my ads expired, and I have 171 guests with me - on that day, I opened the 6 stalls and allowed guests to start buying merchandise

https://preview.redd.it/0x5ddqttkujg1.png?width=734&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c256c55c77cf0f5aa10b98eb0acd65d76d6a109

This is how much I charged and what I sold from each stall:

* The Novelty T-Shirt is sold at $4.60 each for a profit of $3.40
* Sun Block SPF50 is the only item sold at the Sun Cream Stall at $3.00, for a profit of $2.20
* Cowboy Hat is the only item sold at Western Hat Stall at $3.70, for a profit of $2.50
* I removed the Dino Mask from Dino Mask Stall, each Animal Paw sells for $2.00, for a profit of $1.50
* Sunglasses are sold at a profit of $0.70 each

You might ask, why did I intentionally sell Sunglasses despite them only having a $0.70 profit each? The reason is that guests can only carry five items at once - one hat, two handheld (animal paws), two pocket items (sunblock, T-shirts), and there is a special category for swimsuits and inflatables, that do not take up an inventory space as seen in the screenshot below

https://preview.redd.it/vt14v1xilujg1.png?width=558&format=png&auto=webp&s=c15487028198f06e29fe4d8333246b475deaae0a

The strategy paid off as I doubled the required amount for the Tycoon level goal

To complete the 6 excitement coaster goal, I just increased the number of laps of the ride to 6 and this is sufficient to clear the final goal requirement

You know, the platform where everyone posts their ""5 life lessons from \[random thing\]"" articles and gets 47 claps from other writers also trying to make it work.

Didn't seem like a place to actually sell digital products.

But I had a Whop course about freelance project management that wasn't selling well anywhere else.   
  
Instagram? Exhausting.   
Twitter? Slow.   
Paid ads? Burned through $800 and made $200 back.

I was desperate and Medium was free, so I figured why not write a few articles about project management and see what happens.

Wrote my first article: ""I Lost a $12K Client Because I Couldn't Track My Projects. Here's The System I Built So It Never Happened Again.""

Posted it. Went to bed.

Woke up to 2,400 views, 340 email signups from the CTA at the bottom, and 6 people who'd bought my course.

$894 from one article I wrote in 90 minutes.

I sat there with my coffee like ""okay, what just happened?""

That was 7 months ago. I've now made $28,470 from Medium articles. Same course. Just different articles driving traffic to it.

Here's the whole system.

# The Thing I Got Wrong About Medium

For the first two weeks, I wrote what I thought were ""good Medium articles.""

Inspirational. Philosophical. ""Here's what 3 years of freelancing taught me about life.""

Got decent views. People clapped. Left nice comments.

Zero sales.

Because here's what I didn't understand: **Medium readers fall into two categories.**

Category 1: Writers and aspiring writers who read Medium to learn how to write better Medium articles. They're not buying anything. They're just consuming content.

Category 2: People who Googled a specific problem and landed on a Medium article. They're not there for inspiration. They're there because they have a problem they need solved right now.

Category 2 is where sales happen.

https://preview.redd.it/pavdn7nckujg1.png?width=1304&format=png&auto=webp&s=3354c1fa18c5ce1dea648418336c8211a9745420

My inspirational articles attracted Category 1. They read, clapped, moved on.

But when I wrote: ""I Lost a $12K Client Because I Couldn't Track My Projects""? That attracted people actively struggling with project management. People with money on the line. People ready to buy a solution.

That's when everything clicked.

# The Article That Made Me Realize This Works

My second article was about a specific mistake I'd made.

Title: ""I Said Yes to 6 Clients in One Month and Nearly Ruined My Reputation. Here's The System That Saved Me.""

It wasn't motivational. It was practical. Told the story of me being an idiot, the consequences, and the exact system I built to fix it.

At the end, I added: ""If you want the actual templates and system I use now, I built a course with everything. It's $149. Here's the link.""

https://preview.redd.it/vwj6wmaikujg1.png?width=1054&format=png&auto=webp&s=7df2f055d1b131067cc6b8b4351e1a5837e2674b

That was it. No hard pitch. Just: ""here's what I made if you want it.""

Posted the article. Within 48 hours it had 8,000 views.

87 people clicked the link. 19 people bought.

$2,831 from one article.

But here's the really interesting part: that article still drives sales today, 6 months later.

It ranks on Google for ""how to manage multiple freelance clients."" Gets 200-300 views per day. Sends 1-2 sales per week.

One article I wrote in 2 hours has now generated $9,400+ in sales.

That's when I understood: Medium articles aren't just content. They're SEO assets that compound over time.

# The Article Structure That Actually Sells

After writing 30+ articles, I figured out the pattern that converts.

Start with a specific painful moment. Not ""managing clients is hard."" But ""I lost $12K because I missed a deadline for my biggest client.""

People skim Medium. If your first paragraph doesn't grab them with a relatable problem, they're gone.

Tell the story of what went wrong. This builds credibility. Shows you've actually experienced the problem. Not just theorizing about it.

Explain what you tried that didn't work. This is crucial. If you jump straight to ""here's what worked,"" people think it's too easy. But if you show your failed attempts, they trust you more.

Share what finally worked. Be specific. Give away the actual framework or system. Don't hold back the good stuff.

End with a soft pitch. ""If you want the templates and full system, I built a course. Here's the link. But honestly, what I shared above will get you 80% there.""

That last part is key. Give them permission to not buy. Sounds backwards but it works.

# The Email Capture Strategy

https://preview.redd.it/eagb4w9vkujg1.png?width=1509&format=png&auto=webp&s=12f2ba5fc57f32af4116d519ce2e93056caea078

My first few articles just linked to my course at the end.

Some people bought. Most didn't.

Then I tried something different: added an email capture midway through the article.

After explaining the problem and before giving the solution, I'd add:

""Before I explain the system, I put together a free project tracking template. It's what I still use today. You can grab it here: \[email signup link\]""

This did two things:

First, it captured emails from people who weren't ready to buy yet but wanted help.

Second, it filtered people. If they signed up for the free template, I knew they were serious about solving this problem. Not just casual readers.

Then I'd send them a 3-email sequence:

Email 1 (immediately): Here's your template + how to use it

Email 2 (3 days later): Common mistakes people make + how to avoid them

Email 3 (5 days later): If you want the full system with all the templates and workflows, here's my course

Conversion rate from email signup to purchase: about 12%.

So now instead of just hoping article readers would buy immediately, I was building a list of qualified leads and nurturing them.

Revenue jumped from $4K/month to $8K/month just by adding email capture.

# The Publication Submission Hack

Around month 3, I figured out something about Medium publications.

Publications are basically curated collections run by editors. If they accept your article, it goes out to all their followers.

Some publications have 50K+ followers.

Getting accepted = instant visibility.

I started submitting my articles to relevant publications. ""The Startup"" for entrepreneurship content. ""Better Marketing"" for business stuff. Niche freelance publications.

My acceptance rate was maybe 40%. But when an article got accepted? Views would jump from 1,000 to 15,000+.

Here's the trick: I'd write the article first. Post it to my own Medium profile. Then submit it to publications.

Why? Because if a publication rejected it, I still had it live on my profile. And articles already getting good engagement were more likely to get accepted.

One article got accepted by a publication with 120K followers. Got 34,000 views in the first week. Made $4,800 in course sales.

All because an editor said yes to my submission.

# The Follow-Up Article Sequence

I noticed something weird: people would read one of my articles, not buy, but then show up again later.

So I started writing article sequences.

***Article 1:*** ""I Lost a $12K Client Because I Couldn't Track Projects""

***Article 2:*** ""The Simple Project Tracking System That Saved My Freelance Career""

***Article 3:*** ""5 Mistakes I See Freelancers Make With Client Management""

Each article stood alone. But they built on each other.

Someone would read Article 1, not buy. Then Google something else, land on Article 2, remember me, and sign up for my email list.

By the time they'd read 2-3 of my articles, they felt like they knew me. Trust was built. Buying felt natural.

I'd see people in my course who'd found me through an article 3 months ago, read 4-5 of my pieces, joined my email list, and then finally bought.

Medium wasn't just a sales platform. It was a trust-building platform that happened to also drive sales.

# The Link Placement Rules Nobody Explains

Medium has rules about links. Technically.

You're not supposed to just spam product links everywhere. They'll limit your distribution.

But here's what works:

One link per article. At the end. After you've provided genuine value.

Frame it as optional. ""If you want more, here's my course. If not, what I shared above will help.""

Some articles I wouldn't link to my course at all. Just provided value. Built goodwill.

Then in other articles, I'd mention the course naturally: ""This is the exact system I teach in my course, but here's the basic framework...""

Medium's algorithm is smart. It knows when you're being helpful vs when you're just trying to sell.

Articles where I was genuinely helpful got promoted. Articles that felt like ads got buried.

So I focused on being helpful. Sales came as a side effect.

# The Member vs Non-Member Strategy

Medium has paying members (people who pay $5/month for unlimited reading) and non-members (people who hit the paywall after 3 free articles).

I experimented with paywalling my articles vs keeping them free.

Results: free articles got way more views but slightly lower conversion rates. Paywalled articles got fewer views but higher conversion rates.

So I split my strategy:

Top-of-funnel articles (broad topics, problem awareness): Free. Maximum reach.

Bottom-of-funnel articles (specific solutions, buying intent keywords): Paywalled. Serious readers only.

This meant people discovering me through Google would read free articles first, get value, and eventually land on paywalled content if they wanted more.

The paywall acted as a filter. Only people serious enough to pay $5/month for Medium would read my best stuff. And those people converted to course buyers at 3x the rate of free readers.

# The SEO That Made Old Articles Keep Selling

Here's the most valuable thing I learned: Medium articles rank on Google.

Not always. Not guaranteed. But if you write about a specific problem with good SEO, your article can rank.

My article ""I Lost a $12K Client Because I Couldn't Track Projects"" ranks #3 on Google for ""how to track freelance projects.""

Gets 200-300 visits per day. Every single day. For the last 6 months.

I wrote it once. It's been working for me 24/7 ever since.

The key is writing for search intent, not just Medium readers.

When I write an article, I Google the main topic first. See what's already ranking. Then write something better.

More specific. More actionable. More honest about what actually works vs theory.

Then Medium's domain authority + my article quality helps it rank.

Not every article ranks. Maybe 1 in 5. But those that do? Compounding traffic machines.

# Month 5: The Unexpected Benefit

Around month 5, I started getting emails from people saying ""I've been reading your Medium articles for months. Just wanted to say thanks.""

These people hadn't bought anything. Just... liked my content.

Then I launched a second product (a template pack). Mentioned it in my email newsletter.

Those ""free readers"" converted at 15%.

Turns out building an audience through free valuable content creates goodwill that pays off when you launch new things.

I wasn't just selling one course. I was building an asset: an audience that trusted me.

# The Tracking System That Showed What Worked

I needed to know which articles actually drove revenue vs just got views.

Created a simple spreadsheet:

Article title, date published, total views (updated monthly), email signups from that article, direct sales from that article, estimated revenue.

Used UTM parameters in my links so I could track which article each sale came from.

This showed me surprising patterns:

My most-viewed article (67K views) drove 23 sales.

My 8th most-viewed article (4K views) drove 31 sales.

Views don't equal sales. Buyer intent does.

Now I focus less on chasing views and more on writing about topics with high buyer intent.

# What I'd Tell Someone Starting Today

Write about specific problems, not general topics. ""How I solved X"" beats ""5 tips for X.""

Don't wait to have it all figured out. My best articles are about mistakes I made, not successes I had.

I am very sensitive to coffee. Teas like Assam can trigger the same undesired side effects, but it's less severe so I can enjoy things like my own chai recipe, but I can't drink them frequently long-term. This is to say that any options as high in caffeine wouldn't be the best daily drink for me.

I enjoy jasmine tea, gen mai cha, jasmine Phoenix pearl, Harney & Son's adzuki and Paris, oolong, darjeeling, chrysanthemum, and i think pine needle white tea. I remember enjoying rooibos and disliking fruity teas unless cold brewed. I also have a smokey seaweed tea that I adore. That and the gen mai cha is probably my favorites currently in my stash.  I also enjoy matcha and really love hojicha and have the proper utensils for them, but I feel that's a whole other post (unless you want to suggest some lovely intro-level hojicha of course).

I've been recommended to drink more herbal teas as well for my health.

I forgot the TAZO tea bit!  Has anyone had TAZO berry blossom white? It's a white tea ""with tinges of Huckleberry and white cranberry."" It was divine, and now seems lost to time.

And yeah, it's more common in women due to menstruation and pregnancy. But men get it too, and when we do, it's often a wake-up call that something else is going on.

If you're a guy reading this because you've been feeling off and suspect anemia, or maybe you already got the diagnosis and aren't sure what to do next, let's talk about this honestly.

# First, Why This Matters for Men

Here's the thing doctors don't always say upfront anemia in men is never ""normal."" In women, mild anemia can sometimes be explained by heavy periods. In men, low hemoglobin is a red flag that demands an explanation. It could be as simple as a poor diet or as serious as internal bleeding. You need to know which one you're dealing with.

Normal hemoglobin for adult men is typically between 13.5 and 17.5 g/dL. If you're below that, your blood isn't carrying enough oxygen to your muscles, organs, and brain. That's why you feel like garbage.

# The Symptoms You Might Be Ignoring

Men are notoriously bad at noticing slow changes in our bodies. We blame fatigue on work stress. We blame dizziness on not sleeping well. We blame pale skin on ""just being pasty."" Here's what actual anemia feels like for a guy:

* Crushing fatigue that rest doesn't fix. Not just tired, but the kind of exhausted where climbing stairs feels like a workout.
* Shortness of breath doing things that used to be easy. Carrying groceries, walking the dog, even just talking while walking.
* Heart racing or pounding. Your heart works harder to move what little oxygen you have. You might notice it when lying down at night.
* Pale skin, especially noticeable in your nail beds, gums, and inner eyelids.
* Cold hands and feet, even when it's warm.
* Brain fog and irritability. You can't focus, you're short-tempered, and you feel mentally slow.
* Unusual cravings for ice, dirt, or clay. Yes, this happens in men too.

If you have several of these, especially the fatigue and shortness of breath, get your hemoglobin checked.

# What to Do If You Suspect Anemia

**Step 1: Get the Right Tests**

Don't just ask for a ""blood count."" Ask for:

* Complete Blood Count (CBC) with hemoglobin
* Iron panel including ferritin (this is your iron storage level)
* Vitamin B12 and folate levels

Ferritin is huge. You can have ""normal"" hemoglobin but ferritin in the basement, and you'll still feel awful. Optimal ferritin for men is generally considered 50-150 ng/mL**.** Below 30 is deficient.

**Step 2: Find the Cause**

This is non-negotiable. Common causes in men include:

* Blood loss from the GI tract (ulcers, gastritis, colon polyps, hemorrhoids, or long-term NSAID use like ibuprofen)
* Poor diet (especially in guys who eat mostly processed food and skip veggies)
* Malabsorption issues (Celiac disease, Crohn's, etc.)
* Chronic kidney disease (kidneys produce EPO, a hormone that tells your body to make red blood cells)

Your doctor needs to help you figure out which one it is.

**Step 3: Treat Based on the Cause**

If it's iron deficiency, here's the realistic plan,

Diet alone will not fix significant anemia. It took months or years to deplete your stores. It will take months to rebuild them. Food helps maintain levels, but supplements are usually necessary to catch up.

That said, diet matters for supporting recovery:

* Heme iron sources (absorbed best): Beef, liver, lamb, sardines, chicken thighs
* Non-heme sources (pair with Vitamin C): Lentils, spinach, black beans, fortified cereals, pumpkin seeds
* The Vitamin C rule: Have a glass of orange juice, squeeze lemon on your meat, or add bell peppers to your beans. This doubles or triples absorption.
* Avoid coffee and tea for at least an hour before and two hours after iron-rich meals or supplements. They block absorption significantly.

If your doctor prescribes iron supplements:

* Take them on an empty stomach if you can tolerate it
* Take with Vitamin C (orange juice or a small Vitamin C tablet)
* Be consistent. Set a daily alarm. Missing doses means you're just spinning your wheels.
* Expect GI issues (constipation, dark stools, nausea) for the first week or two. It usually improves.

# How Long Until You Feel Better?

This is the frustrating part. You might start feeling slightly better in 2-3 weeks as your body begins to rebuild. But a real turnaround where the fatigue lifts and you feel like yourself usually takes 1-3 months of consistent treatment.

Your hemoglobin should rise about 1 g/dL per month with proper treatment. So if you're at 10, expect 3-4 months to hit normal range.

# Is This Working? How to Know

The only way to know for sure is repeat bloodwork. But in between doctor visits, tracking your progress can keep you motivated. Some guys use non-invasive devices like EzeCheck to get a quick hemoglobin reading at home without needles. It's not a replacement for lab tests, but seeing that number slowly creep up week by week can be the difference between giving up and sticking with it. It's used in over a dozen countries and even in national health programs because it gives people real-time feedback on their recovery.

# The Bottom Line for Men

If your hemoglobin is low, don't brush it off. Don't assume you'll ""fix it with steak."" Get the full workup, find the cause, and treat it aggressively. Anemia is miserable, but it's one of the most treatable conditions out there. You just have to commit to the process and give your body time to rebuild.

1r67y22,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1r67y22/double_feature_two_short_stories_you_might_like/,"Double Feature (Two short stories, you might like.)","(#1 The Journey) 

I started the piece because I was tired of writing obituaries for places that were still standing.

In the fall of 1984, every editor in Detroit seemed convinced the only story left to tell about Michigan was decline. Factories closing. Neighborhoods thinning. Lake freighters rusting in dockyards like monuments to better decades. If it wasn’t bankruptcy, it was arson. If it wasn’t arson, it was relocation.

I didn’t disagree. I just thought the state deserved a slower look.

I’d been living downtown for almost eight years then, in a narrow brick building just off Jefferson, three stories up from a bakery that had stopped baking anything fresh after 3 p.m. The river was close enough that on damp mornings I could smell metal and water in the air, a kind of industrial brine that never quite left the lungs. The Renaissance Center was still new enough to feel futuristic, though most days it looked like a mirrored fortress pretending the rest of the city wasn’t fraying at the edges.

  


October had come early and hard that year. The trees along the boulevard turned a tired orange, leaves collecting in the gutters where the street sweepers missed them. The wind carried a cold edge even before sunset. You could feel the season pressing in.

The idea was simple: drive north, follow the spine of the state, and write about what Michigan looked like away from press conferences and statistics. Detroit to the Upper Peninsula. Factories to forests. Salt and steel to iron and pine.

An editor at the paper told me it sounded sentimental. I told him I preferred observant.

I left on a Thursday morning just after nine. The sky was high and pale, that washed-out autumn blue that looks thinner than summer. My car was a twelve-year-old Buick with a driver-side window that didn’t seal properly, which meant the highway wind always found a way in. I had a thermos of coffee, a legal pad thick with notes, and a cassette recorder I rarely trusted but always brought.

  


Downtown felt hollow at that hour. Office workers were already inside. The sidewalks were too wide for the number of people using them. I passed shuttered storefronts with FOR LEASE signs fading unevenly in the glass. A hardware store I remembered from my first year in the city had been replaced by plywood and a spray-painted phone number.

The city didn’t look dead. It looked tired. There’s a difference.

I took Jefferson east first before cutting north, more out of habit than necessity. The river stayed to my right, steel-gray and flat. Freighters moved slowly, their horns low and patient. I rolled down the window despite the cold and listened for a moment at a red light.

It wasn’t quiet. It was layered. Traffic somewhere behind me. The hum of distant machinery. Wind cutting around building corners. Water shifting against concrete.

I remember thinking that if you listened long enough, you could hear the whole state in that mix. I turned north and the skyline slipped behind me.

  


The Eastside neighborhoods felt closer to the bone than downtown. Brick homes with small lawns already scattered in leaves. Corner stores with bars over the windows. A church with a hand-painted sign promising REVIVAL THIS SUNDAY in letters that looked rushed. There were still kids waiting for a late school bus, jackets too thin for the temperature, kicking at piles of leaves that broke apart in dry bursts.

A mile or two farther and the houses thinned. Empty lots widened between structures. A factory with half its windows boarded and the other half broken sat like a molar pulled too late. I slowed at a stoplight and noticed vines climbing the chain-link fence along its perimeter.

Even in October, they were still green. I made a note about that.

The radio had been low, an AM news station cycling through farm reports and automotive layoffs. Somewhere north of Eight Mile the signal thinned into static. It wasn’t dramatic—just the ordinary fade of distance—but it lingered longer than I expected before the host’s voice returned, mid-sentence, as if nothing had interrupted him.

I adjusted the dial and left it alone.

By the time I reached the outer suburbs, the air felt clearer. Houses grew larger, lawns more deliberate. Strip malls stood in careful rows, their parking lots half-full. A banner outside one advertised a fall festival, complete with hayrides and cider. I considered stopping, then didn’t. It wasn’t festivals I was interested in. It was the spaces between.

  


North of Pontiac the traffic thinned properly. Trees thickened along the roadside, their leaves shifting from orange to a darker, rusted red. The highway felt wider than it needed to be.

I pulled off at a small rest stop just past noon. It was little more than a picnic table, two vending machines, and a bathroom building that looked like it had been poured out of leftover concrete. There were three cars in the lot, all spaced far apart as if arranged intentionally.

The wind had picked up.

Leaves scraped across the asphalt in small, skittering bursts. The soda machine hummed steadily. The bathroom door creaked open and shut once in the wind, though I hadn’t seen anyone go inside.

I stood for a moment with my coffee, looking at the tree line. It wasn’t dense yet. You could still see through the trunks to a field beyond. But the trees were closer together than they had been south of here. The light felt narrower.

I wrote in my notebook: North feels less abandoned. More… waiting.

I’m not sure what I meant by that. 

Probably nothing.

  


I went inside the restroom, washed my hands, and when I came back out, one of the three cars was gone. I hadn’t heard it start.

That struck me as odd only because the parking lot was gravel-heavy and loud under tires. I told myself I must have been distracted by the sink’s rattling pipes.

I finished the coffee, crumpled the cup, and got back in the Buick.

As I pulled onto the highway again, the radio cut to static without warning. Not a fade this time. Just silence swallowed by white noise.

I tapped the dashboard lightly, an old habit. After several seconds, the station returned.

The host was laughing at something. I don’t remember what.

  


The highway north of Bay City begins to feel like a decision.

Up until then, you’re still in Michigan the way most people imagine it—townships stitched together by gas stations, diners, high school football fields, and industrial leftovers. But somewhere past the Saginaw River, the state stretches out and stops pretending to be crowded.

The trees close in. The sky lowers. You begin to understand how much land there is.

I kept the windows cracked despite the cold. The smell changed as I drove—less exhaust, more soil. A kind of dampness that suggested depth rather than decay. Fields widened on either side of the road, harvested and flat, their stubble catching the light like dull wire. Silos stood alone against the horizon.

The radio signal weakened again. This time I didn’t touch it.

The static rose and fell in soft waves, occasionally interrupted by fragments of voices from stations too far away to identify. Farm reports bleeding into gospel. Weather advisories interrupted by distant music. The voices felt layered, overlapping in a way that was almost rhythmic.

Then they thinned to nothing. Silence, except for the engine and wind.

  


I reached Grayling mid-afternoon. The town felt contained, orderly. A gas station attendant in a flannel jacket pumped my tank while I stretched my legs. He asked where I was headed.

“Up,” I said. He nodded like that was answer enough. “Leaves’ll be down soon,” he said. “Wind’s been strange.”

“Strange how?” He shrugged. “Moves sideways.” I waited for him to elaborate. He didn’t.

I wrote that down too.

The diner across the street had wood paneling so dark it swallowed light. I ordered coffee and pie and watched two hunters in orange caps argue quietly about trail markers. The waitress refilled my cup before I asked. On the wall behind her was a faded photograph of the town from 1912—horses tied along a dirt road, storefronts crisp and new.

The town hadn’t grown much since then. It had settled. That’s the word I kept returning to in my notes.

Settled.

Outside, the wind pushed leaves along the sidewalk in thin spirals. Not gusts—more like directed movement. I watched one cluster travel nearly twenty feet without breaking apart, sliding low along the pavement before disappearing around the corner of the building.

  


I told myself the architecture funneled it that way. Wind does what wind does.

By the time I was back on the road, the sun had shifted toward late afternoon. Shadows stretched longer across the highway. The trees thickened noticeably now—more pine mixed among the hardwoods. The scent sharpened. Resin and cold air.

The road north of Gaylord narrows visually even if the lanes don’t. The forest presses closer. Billboards become rare. Cell towers disappear. You begin to drive between walls of trees rather than alongside them.

I passed a stretch where construction cones had been set up along the shoulder, though no workers were present. The asphalt there looked slightly darker, as if patched recently. Not unusual. Michigan roads are always under repair.

But the line of cones continued longer than expected. Half a mile. Then a mile.

Then nearly two.

No equipment. No signage explaining the work. Just cones. Eventually they stopped as abruptly as they had begun.

I made a note: Infrastructure without explanation. It sounded dramatic when written down. In reality, it was probably bureaucracy.

Still, the rhythm of the road felt different afterward.

Less predictable.

  


I crossed into the northern Lower Peninsula proper as dusk approached. The temperature dropped sharply once the sun dipped behind the tree line. Mist began to gather in shallow pockets along the roadside, especially near wetlands. It didn’t roll in; it accumulated.

Layer by layer. Like breath on glass.

My headlights cut through it unevenly. Some sections dispersed instantly. Others seemed thicker than the surrounding air, holding shape for a second too long before breaking apart.

I slowed without realizing I had.

The radio flickered back to life with a burst of static so loud I flinched. For just a moment—less than a second—I thought I heard my own name spoken in the hiss.

Not clearly. Not directly. More like a syllable shaped similarly. I turned the volume down to nothing.

There are tricks the mind plays when sensory input drops. Isolation sharpens imagination. I’d written about it before. Solitary hunters hearing footsteps that aren’t there. Long-haul drivers convinced headlights follow them for miles.

The brain fills silence.

That’s all.

  


By full dark I pulled into a small roadside motel just south of Mackinaw City. The sign buzzed faintly in neon blue, one letter flickering on and off. The parking lot held four cars. The office smelled like old carpet and pine cleaner.

The clerk was a woman in her sixties with reading glasses perched low on her nose. She asked how many nights.

“One,” I said. “Crossing in the morning?” she asked. “Yes.”

She slid the key across the counter without looking up again. “Bridge can feel longer than it is.” I smiled. “How so?”

She paused, finally meeting my eyes. “Just does.”

Room 12 faced the treeline rather than the highway. I didn’t realize that until I opened the curtains. The forest sat close behind the building, black and uniform in the night. No visible depth. Just a vertical wall of shadow.

I set my legal pad on the small desk and reviewed the day’s notes.

Downtown — hollow but breathing.

Eastside — thinning structure.

Mid-Michigan — settled.

North — waiting.

I underlined that last word without knowing why.

  


Around ten o’clock, as I lay in bed listening to the heater click on and off, I heard something outside.

Not footsteps. Not quite. A dragging sound, light but persistent, moving parallel to the building.

I sat up and held my breath. The sound continued for several seconds, then stopped. Silence returned so completely it felt artificial.

After a minute, I convinced myself it was leaves caught against the siding. The wind had been unpredictable all day. The clerk’s comment echoed in my head—feels longer than it is.

I turned onto my side and closed my eyes. Just before sleep, I had the briefest sensation that the ground beneath the motel shifted.

Not an earthquake. Not a jolt. More like something deep below adjusting its weight.

The heater kicked on again. The sound vanished.

  


Morning came thin and colorless.

The kind of northern light that doesn’t warm anything, only reveals it.

The parking lot held frost in shallow seams along the asphalt. My windshield required scraping, the sound sharp and deliberate in the quiet air. The forest behind the motel looked closer in daylight, though that was probably illusion. Pines don’t move overnight.

Still, the tree line felt nearer than it had when I’d drawn the curtains the night before.

The clerk was gone when I returned the key. A handwritten note sat on the counter: Back in ten minutes. I waited five, then left the key on the desk and stepped back into the cold.

Mackinaw City in October felt paused. A few souvenir shops open. A coffee stand steaming gently. The lake beyond the buildings lay flat and metallic, stretching outward without visible current. And then there was the bridge.

The Mackinac Bridge doesn’t dominate the horizon the way skyscrapers do. It emerges gradually. Steel against sky. Suspension cables arcing like ribs. Even in daylight, it looks skeletal.

I parked briefly at the overlook and stood there with my notebook. The wind was stronger here, direct and unsheltered. It cut across the straits without obstruction, carrying the smell of water and iron.

  


Freighters moved below, small against the span.

I wrote: Two peninsulas pretending to be separate. That felt right.

The bridge was less crowded than I expected. A handful of cars. A delivery truck. One semi. I merged slowly and began the crossing.

Driving it is different than seeing it.

You feel the height before you fully register it. The guardrails are lower than your instincts prefer. The grating section in the center hums beneath the tires, vibrating up through the steering column into your hands.

The water below shifts in color depending on angle—dark blue, then gray, then almost black.

About a third of the way across, the wind changed direction.

Not gradually. Not with warning.

One moment it pushed from the west. The next it struck from the east, hard enough that I corrected the steering wheel instinctively.

The car swayed slightly. Not dangerously. But noticeably.

  


I glanced in the rearview mirror. The delivery truck behind me drifted half a foot within its lane before correcting.

The radio, which I’d left off since the night before, crackled faintly without being turned on.

A low hiss. I stared at it for a moment. Then the hiss faded.

The sky above the straits seemed clearer than anywhere else I’d been on the trip. Almost too clear. A hard blue without depth. The cables of the bridge cut across it in precise geometry.

Halfway across, I experienced something I’ve never adequately explained.

It wasn’t fear. It wasn’t vertigo.

It was the sensation—brief, but unmistakable—that the distance between the two peninsulas was greater than it should be.

That the bridge had stretched. Just slightly.

The towers seemed farther apart than they had moments before. The far shore looked less defined, as though a thin haze had slipped between us.

I blinked. Everything returned to proportion. Wind. Steel. Water.

  


My rational mind supplied the answer immediately: perspective distortion caused by movement and crosswind. Anyone who drives enough experiences momentary spatial misjudgment.

Still. I pressed the accelerator a touch harder.

The final stretch passed without incident. Tires left the grating and returned to solid asphalt with a dull, reassuring thud. The Upper Peninsula greeted me not with drama but with trees.

Thicker now. Denser.

The road north from St. Ignace felt narrower than the highway below, though it wasn’t. Pines pressed close to the shoulder. The forest floor looked darker here, less leaf-littered and more rooted. The air carried a metallic undertone I couldn’t immediately place.

Iron. That was it. You could smell it faintly, especially near exposed rock faces along the road.

I stopped at a scenic turnout overlooking Lake Michigan’s northern shoreline. Waves broke gently against stone. No one else was present. The silence felt heavier here—not empty, but weighted.

I walked down toward the water.

  


The rocks shifted underfoot. The lake’s surface looked calm from a distance but restless up close, small currents intersecting at odd angles. I crouched and touched the water.

Colder than expected. Sharp.

When I stood, I noticed something along the shoreline about twenty yards away. A section of rock that appeared split cleanly down the center. Not weathered.

Split.

As though pressure had forced it apart from below. I approached it.

The crack was narrow—less than an inch wide—but extended nearly six feet across the stone surface. The edges were clean. Recent, if I had to guess.

Michigan stone fractures all the time in winter freeze-thaw cycles. Except it wasn’t winter. And the air had only just turned cold.

I knelt and ran my finger along the edge. The rock felt faintly warm. I pulled my hand back immediately.

  


It could have been sun exposure. Dark stone absorbs heat even in autumn. That was the logical explanation.

I wrote it down anyway. Rock split near shoreline. Warm to touch.

The forest behind me rustled. Not wind. Movement. I turned. Nothing visible beyond tree trunks and shadow.

No animals. No people. Just depth.

The kind of depth that feels like it extends farther than sight allows.

I stood there longer than necessary. Listening. After a while, the ordinary sounds returned—waves, distant gulls, leaves shifting.

I told myself the stillness had been my imagination adjusting to the absence of traffic noise.

Back in the car, I reviewed my notes before driving deeper into the Upper Peninsula. I could see my own handwriting clearly. The entries were steady, legible.

But there was a line I didn’t remember writing. Between Two peninsulas pretending to be separate and Rock split near shoreline, a sentence had been added in smaller script.

Distance is not fixed.

The handwriting looked like mine. But tighter. More compressed. I stared at it for several seconds. Then I closed the notebook.

  


There are moments on long drives where fatigue blurs memory. You write something and forget writing it. That’s all this was.

That’s what I told myself as I started the engine and continued west. The forest swallowed the road almost immediately.

  


I didn’t stay long in the Upper Peninsula.

That wasn’t the plan, originally. I’d intended to push west toward Marquette, maybe even further. But something about the light felt wrong the longer I drove.

Not dim. Not ominous. Just… slightly misaligned.

Distances felt inconsistent. Town markers seemed closer than they should have been. I passed a logging truck twice within twenty minutes, or at least I believed it was the same truck—the same dent in the rear panel, the same missing mud flap.

It could have been coincidence.

Small towns share equipment. Logging routes overlap. Still. By mid-afternoon I turned back east toward St. Ignace.

The bridge was visible long before I reached it, suspended cleanly against the sky. It looked shorter than it had the day before.

That’s what unsettled me most. Not longer. Shorter. Like something had compressed the span overnight.

The wind was calmer during the return crossing. The grating hummed predictably beneath the tires. The water below looked ordinary, rippling under steady current. Nothing shifted. Nothing distorted.

Halfway across, I checked the notebook again. The line remained. Distance is not fixed.

No other changes.

No additional notes I didn’t remember making. I left it open on the passenger seat as I drove the rest of the way south.

  


By the time I reached the northern Lower Peninsula again, dusk was already forming at the edges of the trees. The forest seemed less oppressive now. Or maybe I was simply eager to re-enter familiar geography.

Gaylord passed quietly. Grayling followed. At a gas station outside Roscommon, I stepped out to stretch and felt something subtle beneath my feet.

Not a tremor. Not movement. More like a faint settling. As if weight had shifted somewhere far below ground.

The attendant didn’t react. The other drivers continued fueling. No rattling signs. No rippling puddles.

Just the briefest sense that the earth had exhaled. I didn’t write it down. Some impressions don’t survive ink.

South of Bay City, traffic thickened again. Billboards reappeared. The radio signal strengthened into clarity. Farm reports. College football scores. Weather warnings for frost advisories.

Detroit’s outer suburbs arrived with fluorescent glow and strip-mall repetition. I hadn’t realized how dark the northern stretches had been until artificial light reclaimed the horizon.

When the skyline finally appeared ahead—steel and glass catching the last traces of evening—I felt something close to relief.

  


Downtown was not quiet. It was loud, imperfect, alive. My building looked exactly as I’d left it. Narrow brick façade. The bakery below closing for the night. A delivery truck idling at the curb.

I carried my bag upstairs, unlocked my apartment, and stepped inside. The air smelled stale but unchanged. I set the notebook on the kitchen table and walked toward the living room window to look at the river.

That’s when I noticed it.

Along the base of the far wall, near the radiator, a thin crack traced its way up from the floor molding into the plaster. It hadn’t been there before.

I’m certain of that.

It wasn’t wide—no more than a pencil’s thickness at its broadest point—but it extended nearly two feet vertically, branching once near the center like a hairline fracture in glass.

I crouched and touched the edge. Cold. The building was old. Buildings settle. Temperature shifts cause expansion and contraction. Downtown foundations are built on layered sediment, decades of industrial modification.

There were explanations. There are always explanations. I stood and walked back to the kitchen table, opening the notebook one final time before sleep.

The entries were intact.

Downtown — hollow but breathing.

Eastside — thinning structure.

Mid-Michigan — settled.

North — waiting.

Two peninsulas pretending to be separate. Rock split near shoreline. Distance is not fixed.

But one page was missing.

Not torn roughly. Removed cleanly. The spiral binding still held small paper fibers where it had once been attached. I flipped forward and backward twice to confirm.

  


The missing page would have fallen between my early Eastside notes and the entry about Grayling. I tried to remember what I’d written there.

Something about the factory. Something about the vines. Something green. I couldn’t recall the wording. Only the impression.

I stood there longer than necessary, staring at the gap.

Outside, a freighter’s horn sounded low across the river. The noise traveled through glass and brick and bone.

For just a moment, I felt the same subtle adjustment beneath my feet I had felt north of Roscommon. A faint, almost imperceptible shift.

The crack in the wall did not widen. It did not move. But I had the sudden, irrational sense that it extended far beyond my apartment. Down through foundation. Through layered sediment. Through forgotten tunnels and buried infrastructure. Through salt and stone.

Northward. Southward. Connecting.

I closed the notebook. On the final page, beneath everything else, I wrote one last line before sleep:

Michigan does not feel empty. It feels… occupied.

I tore that page out. And I kept it in my coat pocket.





  


(#2 The Structure)

I almost didn’t go.

That’s the part I come back to when I can’t sleep. I almost didn’t go. I told Ray I had an early shift the next morning. I told him I didn’t know the plant. I told him I wasn’t into breaking into sealed buildings.

None of that stopped me.

It was October, 1984. Westside felt colder than the rest of Detroit that year. Wind cut down the empty factory corridors like it had somewhere to be. The stamping plant sat three blocks off Grand River behind a chain-link fence that had been patched more times than fixed. Four stories of brick and busted windows. Smokestack still standing like it didn’t know it had already lost its job.

Ray said there was copper in the basement runs. “Thick gauge,” he told us. “Nobody stripped it before they sealed the place.”

Sealed. That word should’ve meant something heavier than it did.

There were four of us. Ray led because Ray always led. Marlon came because he had two kids and a layoff notice. Eddie didn’t talk much but noticed everything. And me — I came because I didn’t want to be the only one without cash.

  


The fence had already been cut once. Ray widened the gap anyway. Bolt cutters snapped loud enough that I flinched.

“Relax,” Marlon said. “Ain’t nobody here.” That wasn’t true. There were pigeons somewhere inside the building. Wind rattling loose metal. The low hum of traffic a few blocks out.

And something else. I didn’t have a word for it then. Just a feeling like the place wasn’t empty. Like it was holding something.

The parking lot had sunk in patches. Asphalt split where the ground underneath had dropped. Weeds grew thick through the cracks. I remember thinking the ground looked soft for concrete.

Ray took us around back.

The main doors were welded shut just like he said. But there was a service entrance near the foundation. Rusted padlock. Steel frame. The brick around it had thin cracks running vertically toward the ground.

I noticed that. They weren’t random. They were too straight. I touched one with my finger. It felt sharp and fresh at the edges.

“You coming?” Ray asked. The lock snapped. The door opened inward. Cold air rolled out. Not night air. Not October air. Basement air.

Deep and still.

  


We went down single file. Concrete steps. Each one echoing longer than it should have. I remember the smell most clearly. Iron. Dampness. Old oil soaked into floor seams.

The basement ceiling sat low enough that I felt like I needed to duck even when I didn’t. Support columns lined the space in rigid rows. Rusted pipes traced the overhead like veins in a diagram.

My flashlight passed over the walls. More cracks. Vertical. Diagonal. Some thin as hair. Some wide enough to press a fingertip into.

“Place is settling,” Marlon said.

“Been closed five years,” Eddie answered.

Ray didn’t respond. He moved toward the far wall where the heavy pipe runs were supposed to be.

He found them. Copper. Exactly like he promised. For a second, I felt stupid for being nervous.

Then I felt it.

  


Under my boots. A shift. Subtle. Like standing above a freight tunnel when a train passes beneath you.

I froze. “You feel that?” I asked. Nobody answered right away.

Then the sound came.

Low. Grinding. Not from the walls. Not from above. From below. Dust sifted down in thin lines from the ceiling joints.

Ray straightened. “That’s just the building,” he said. The grinding came again.

Closer. Longer. My flashlight drifted toward the center of the floor. There was a crack there that hadn’t been there before. I’m sure of it. It ran between two columns, thin and straight.

It widened while I watched. Just slightly. Enough to see darkness beneath the concrete. Nobody moved. Nobody breathed.

Then something shifted inside the crack.

  


Not debris. Not falling stone. Something smooth. Pale. It slid just beneath the edge of the fracture and disappeared.

I didn’t scream. I didn’t run. I just stood there trying to convince myself I hadn’t seen anything at all.

Ray whispered, “What the hell was that.” I didn’t answer. Because I knew. It wasn’t the building settling. Something under it was.

Nobody moved for a few seconds after it disappeared.

That’s the part people don’t understand about fear. It doesn’t always send you running. Sometimes it locks you in place while your brain scrambles for a normal explanation.

“It was a rat,” Ray said. Too fast. “Rats don’t look like that,” Eddie replied quietly. “What’d it look like?” Marlon asked.

Nobody answered.

Because none of us wanted to describe it out loud. Ray stepped forward anyway. He crouched near the crack, shining his flashlight into it. The beam only reached a few inches before the darkness swallowed it.

“There’s a void under here,” he muttered. “Old drainage or something.”

  


The grinding sound came again. Longer this time. Not random. Directional. Like weight shifting against the underside of the concrete slab. Dust shook loose from somewhere overhead. Not enough to choke us. Just enough to remind us how much structure sat above our heads.

“We grab what we came for,” Ray said. “Five minutes.” Marlon hesitated. I could see it in his shoulders. But money makes men ignore instincts.

We moved toward the copper runs.

Eddie started cutting first. Sparks flared briefly, sharp against the dark. The noise echoed hard in the low ceiling space. Every metallic snap seemed to bounce back at us twice as loud.

I kept watching the floor. The crack didn’t widen immediately.

It just… existed.

Then it lengthened. Not in a sudden split. In a slow crawl. Hairline fractures branching off like veins spreading beneath skin.

“Yo,” I said. Nobody looked up. The lights flickered. There shouldn’t have been power. The building was dead. But the old industrial fixtures overhead gave a faint pulse — a dull orange flicker — then went dark again.

  


Marlon swore. Ray stopped cutting. The grinding stopped too. Total silence dropped into the basement so fast it felt unnatural. I realized then that I couldn’t hear wind anymore.

Couldn’t hear pigeons. Couldn’t hear the city. It was like the building had sealed itself off from everything outside.

“Door,” Eddie said suddenly. We all turned toward the stairwell. The steel service door at the top had swung inward. Not wide. Just enough that it wasn’t flush with the frame anymore.

Ray stared at it. “Wind,” he said again. “There’s no wind down here,” I answered.

That’s when the first real crack split the floor. Loud. Sharp. The concrete between two columns fractured in a straight line, opening nearly an inch across. And something pressed up from below.

Not bursting through.

Pressing.

The slab bowed upward slightly around the fracture. Not much. Just enough to distort the flatness of the floor. I backed up instinctively. Marlon dropped his cutting tool.

Ray stepped toward it instead. He was that kind of man. “What is under there?” he whispered. The concrete shifted again.

  


A section near the crack gave way with a crunching snap, collapsing inward like crust over hollow ground. A gap opened — maybe two feet across. And I saw it clearly this time. Not the whole thing. Just part of it.

Smooth. Pale gray. Not stone. Not flesh the way we understand flesh. It had a sheen to it, like wet clay stretched tight over something denser beneath.

And it moved. Not writhing. Not thrashing. Adjusting. As if it had rolled slightly to accommodate the collapse. Eddie stumbled backward. Marlon swore again, louder.

Ray didn’t move.

The thing shifted upward another inch. The concrete groaned in protest. Then the building answered. A deep, full-bodied shudder ran through the entire basement. Columns trembled. Dust cascaded from ceiling joints in thick sheets.

The service door upstairs slammed shut. Hard. The sound echoed like a gunshot.

We all froze.

Because now we understood something. It wasn’t random collapse. It wasn’t rot. The pressure was organized. Deliberate. And we were standing directly above it.

The gap in the floor widened another inch. The pale surface beneath rotated slightly. I swear — and I know how that sounds — I swear it angled upward.

Toward us.

  


That’s when Ray finally stepped back.

“Up,” he said. Nobody argued. We ran for the stairs. Behind us, the grinding resumed. Louder now.

Not slow. Not patient. Active. The building wasn’t settling. It was being tested. From below. We hit the stairs too fast.

Ray went first. Eddie behind him. Marlon shoved me forward so hard I nearly fell. The grinding beneath the slab followed us — not chasing, not lunging — just rising in pressure.

That’s the only way I can describe it. Pressure. Like something testing the limits of a ceiling it had grown tired of supporting.

Ray reached the service door and yanked it open. It didn’t move. He pulled harder.

Nothing. “It opened before!” he shouted. Eddie shouldered into it. The frame bent slightly but held. “It’s jammed,” Eddie said.

“No,” I answered.

I don’t know why I said it like that. But I knew. It wasn’t jammed. Something had shifted the frame. The grinding below became a low roar. The basement lights flickered again — stronger this time — a pulse of orange across the fixtures like dying embers reigniting.

  


Then the stairs cracked. The sound shot upward through the concrete like a rifle report. A fracture split the stairwell wall beside us, racing from the basement floor toward the ceiling in a jagged line. Marlon screamed. Not from fear. From pain.

The slab behind us gave way in a thunderclap of collapsing concrete.

The floor dropped. Ray disappeared first. One second he was beside me. The next the ground under him sheared off and he fell backward into the widening rupture.

His scream didn’t last long. It cut off the instant he hit whatever waited below. Eddie tried to grab him. That’s what killed Eddie.

The slab shifted again — violently this time — and the remaining section tilted inward like a trapdoor. Eddie slid down the broken concrete and vanished into the opening with a sound I won’t describe.

Because I still hear it.

Marlon grabbed my jacket and hauled me up two steps just as the lower half of the stairwell buckled.

The entire basement floor collapsed inward. Not everywhere. Just centrally. As if something below had removed support with intention.

  


The opening widened to maybe ten feet across. Dust filled the air so thick I couldn’t see more than a few feet. Through it, I saw the pale surface again.

Closer now. Not flat. Layered. Like overlapping plates or muscle segments shifting against each other. It rolled upward slightly. 

And in that moment — that one frozen, irreversible second — I understood scale. Whatever was under there was not small. The slab hadn’t collapsed because it was weak.

It had collapsed because something larger than the foundation had adjusted. Marlon reached the door again and threw his full weight into it. The hinges shrieked. The door popped open half an inch. Daylight cut through the dust in a thin line.

“Push!” he yelled. I shoved beside him. The door burst outward. Cold night air hit my face. We stumbled through it. And then the wall moved. The brick along the foundation bowed outward like breath filling lungs.

A deep crack split horizontally across the exterior wall. Marlon looked back. That was his mistake. The ground beneath the doorway fractured.

The threshold dropped. He lost his footing. I grabbed his sleeve. For a second I thought I had him. Then the concrete beneath us lurched again. Not downward. Upward.

  


A violent upward heave that threw me clear onto the broken parking lot. Marlon slipped from my grip. He didn’t fall into a neat hole. The foundation simply gave way under him. The doorway collapsed. Brick and steel folded inward.

The sound was enormous. Metal tearing. Concrete pulverizing. And beneath it all —

That grinding. Satisfied. The dust cloud rolled outward into the lot. I crawled backward until my shoulders hit the fence. The smokestack behind the building shuddered once.

Then steadied. Silence followed. Not distant sirens. Not shouting. Just the sound of debris settling.

The plant hadn’t imploded. It hadn’t pancaked. Only the rear quadrant had collapsed inward.

As if something beneath it had created space for itself. I don’t know how long I sat there. Eventually people came. Neighbors first. Then police.

Then fire crews.

They found me shaking near the fence, covered in dust. They said a boiler system must have ruptured underground. They said structural failure. They said the foundation was compromised from years of neglect.

  


They said the basement caved in. They found Ray’s body. They found Eddie’s. They found pieces of Marlon.

They did not find a void. They did not find an exposed cavity. They did not find anything beneath the slab except compacted earth and shattered concrete.

The collapse zone measured smaller than what I saw. Much smaller. The official report listed it as an industrial accident caused by trespassing. That’s what the newspaper called it.

Three dead. One survivor. I moved out of Westside two months later. I still feel it sometimes. That subtle shift under floors. That pressure testing whatever structure I stand on.

I don’t break into places anymore. I don’t go into basements unless I have to. And when I walk across concrete, I sometimes wonder how thick it really is.

Because I know now —

1r67vo4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AeroPress/comments/1r67vo4/best_manual_grinder_for_my_price_range/,Best manual grinder for my price range?,"Hi, I make coffee daily using an AeroPress. I recently upgraded a lot of my kit, but after posting about it I feel my grinder may leave something to be desired.

I currently use a Sage Smart Grinder Pro. I modified it for single dosing. I am enjoying Aeropress at the moment, I am not getting amazing results right now, but bought a 1kg of local coffee beans that I think maybe I just don't like.

So I just wanted some advice. The main thing is I don't want to make a pointless side-grade. I always hear the grinder is so important, I was hoping if I do buy another that it would be noticeable.

My understanding is I will get a better quality grind for my money with manual, as I'm not paying for the motor etc in a setup. I only make 1 cup, maybe 2 a day. I am fine grinding manually if the only downside is the effort. But happy to take suggestions for electric and advice on manual VS in general.

  
Tl;dr: Recommend me a manual grinder please and thank you. 

Current grinder: Sage Smart Grinder Pro (Single dose mod)  
Budget: £400  
Method: Hoffman method  
Style: Americano usually  
Colour: Black or black and wood ideally! My whole setup is black, this could make the difference between two good choices.

5 minute comp cooldown for leaving at least? 

Like bro, I queque to play the game not to spend quality time in the Menu cause you dont like getting scored on or not having zen on your team. Im sitting in champ and the game would be so much fun but this is, at least for me, a reason to quit. 

Is missing a touch or getting scored on just so much emotional damage that you cant bare to spend the 5 Minutes that you quequed up for, in the actual game?

How mad can you get withing the first 10 seconds of a match?

Dont get me wrong: I get that sometimes, things can happen and you cant play on. (I spilt coffee once and it was running across my table and mousepad so i kinda had to to stop playing, but that was some time ago and if i remember correctly i got punished for leaving or staying afk for too long)

MidnightEcho: same, just wandering in thoughts.

They started chatting every night. Short msgs, emojis, memes, random rants about movies, music, coffee… everything felt fun but kinda… special.

Maya: omg u saw that mural on 5th st? 🎨  
MidnightEcho: lol yesss, noticed it last week, looked like a secret code or smth 🤔

Days passed. Sometimes MidnightEcho would go offline for hours or even a day. Maya got anxious, but then a msg would pop up:

MidnightEcho: hey, missed u z😌 still here?

Curious, Maya started connecting hints from their convos—coffee shops, bookstores, murals. Nothing personal, just safe little clues, like a puzzle.

One evening, they finally met IRL, quiet streets, moonlight. It was Elias, thoughtful and kinda mysterious, same vibe from the chats. No weird stuff, just laughs, smiles, and easy connection.

Even after time apart for work or life, they kept in touch safely. Short msgs, emojis, little jokes… the same spark stayed alive. Slowly, their chats turned into real-life moments.

He was so mad and hurt when said we never belonged together. He meant she came from the upper class and he was just a middle class guy who used to serve her coffee in a diner. Him saying ""you belong to someone 'like' Christopher"" was just to self deprecate to make her feel guilty about her class. 

Her whole life she felt ashamed and shallow for being born in an upper class family. She made her life on her own and he knew his comment about her association with her class would hurt her as she was self made and hated her previous life. He knew it and he used the most vulnerable thing he knew about her to attack her. He used her insecurity against her.

And Lore was horrible too. she was hurt so her sleeping with Christopher right after break up was her using his insecurity to hurt him as she knew his previous wife cheated on him. His reaction to punch Christopher was just him being retaliating in worse way. This time he actually punched the guy who slept with his woman which he couldn't do last time. He felt emasculated.

Even during the first break up he knew the whole chris thing was not her fault but God he wouldn't listen and she was so scared of saying anything when it was all blood red angry in party. Lore was wrong too as even at that time she knew he was cheated on previously so he was insecure. Luke knew she shuts down when someone screams and yells at her like her parents and feels pressurised and wrongfully criticised for things she never did or meant to do. He didn't stay calm to even discuss everything with her about why everything happened. Even that breakup was hard for both. 

Both were using each other's insecurity to hurt each others. Both had a lot of problems. Both were really toxic and had commitment issues. both were bad at communicating their feelings and everything like adults. Both were in love with each other too. Too complex or characters with a lot of baggage which they could never heal. 

At the same time, I also felt he made it easy for her to still come to his diner and consider him friends so he said something like that. He wanted her to consider him a close friend too in his twisted mind. I think both were impulsive because both were extremely emotional and hyper people with a lot of irritability and rejection sensitivity. I think such people love hard and fall apart harder. Too much immaturity, too much love, too much insecurity and drama but also too complex. 

Everything felt so wrong. Crushed my spirit. God, a heavy watch. ",0,1771243141.0,GilmoreGirls,1,0.29,False

The System Doesn’t Break People. It Makes Them Efficient.

This story takes place in a fictional world.

It does NOT reflect my real-life views on corporations or career growth.

⸻

Paul had no profession.

No degree.

No connections.

No impressive résumé.

Just overdue rent, an empty fridge, and a quiet, constant fear of staying small forever.

He rented a tiny room in an old building on the outskirts—the last door at the end of a long hallway where lightbulbs flickered and the floor creaked under every step. The walls were thin, coated in layers of peeling paint that flaked off like burned skin. Black mold bloomed in the corners, especially after rain when water seeped through cracks in the ceiling and dripped into a tin bowl on the floor. The shared shower at the end of the hall had a rusty faucet—water either ice-cold or scalding—and a line of neighbors in robes and slippers. At night the sounds came through the walls: the old man across the hall coughing, a child crying upstairs, muffled arguments drifting from below.

His only furniture was a sagging mattress on the floor, an old wardrobe with one door barely hanging on, and a small table by the window that looked out onto trash bins and a streetlamp that flickered yellow all night. The fridge hummed like a dying engine; inside were only things that hadn’t yet spoiled: half a pack of instant noodles, a can of tuna, yesterday’s bread. Paul ate standing at the window, watching cars speed past, carrying someone else toward a better life.

During the day he walked from one job ad to the next—loader, courier, cleaner, anything. Every place asked for experience, a diploma, or “an energetic team player.” Every place turned him down politely or didn’t reply at all. In the evenings he came back to the room, switched on the single lamp, and sat in the half-dark counting days until the next late payment. Sometimes he imagined setting the whole building on fire—just to feel some warmth.

But every evening he left and walked to the cheap café near the bus stop. There Bill waited. The tables were scratched. The coffee tasted thin. But it was theirs.

Bill worked as a warehouse loader.

Long shifts. Heavy boxes. Unstable pay.

“My boss is a good man,” Bill once said, staring into his cup. “He apologizes every time payroll is late.”

“And is it ever on time?” Paul asked.

Bill smiled faintly.

“No.”

Respect didn’t pay rent.

Eventually, Paul found something else.

A company called Livanse.

High salary. Structured growth. Clear hierarchy.

The contract looked ordinary.

He signed it.

⸻

After the interview

Paul stepped out of the Livanse building, legs still trembling from the tension. He boarded the bus and pressed his forehead against the cold window. His heart pounded—not from fear, but from relief. The building gradually receded: at first the huge glass tower filled the entire view, then it became just a silhouette a few blocks away, then it dissolved among the other high-rises. But even when it vanished from sight, Paul still felt its presence—as though it were still watching.

He smiled for the first time in months. The contract rested in his pocket like a ticket to another life.

⸻

First Floor

The interview room was blindingly bright. High ceilings. Five people in tailored suits.

They asked about pressure.

About authority.

About loyalty.

About conflict.

Paul answered carefully.

He needed this.

“We appreciate your time,” they said in the end. “You have been selected.”

He was inside.

⸻

At first, everything felt manageable.

His supervisor, Robert Gindelberd, was tall, around thirty, in excellent shape—broad shoulders, straight posture, movements economical and deliberate, as if every unnecessary twitch had been trained out of him long ago.

He wore a crisp white shirt, a vivid blood-red tie knotted with precision, and expensive trousers that looked deliberately worn-in: faint creases at the knees, subtle fading at the hems. Not neglect. Calculated distress. A uniform that said he had paid a price and learned to wear it like armor.

His face was calm—almost unnaturally so. Steady voice, level gaze, no wasted expressions.

Paul worked quietly. Tried not to stand out.

Then he made a mistake in a report.

He didn’t notice it.

Robert did.

The next day, Robert addressed him in front of the entire team.

“A calculation error,” Robert repeated loudly. “In a company built on precision.”

The room fell silent.

“Perhaps numbers are too ambitious for you.”

Heat flooded Paul’s face.

“With respect,” Paul replied, louder than intended, “I corrected it before it caused damage.”

Silence.

Robert stared at him, then raised his voice again, addressing the whole floor.

“Everything you know is pathetic. Useless. Amateur garbage dressed up as work. You think this belongs here? You think you belong here?”

He stepped closer, voice dropping to a low, almost intimate growl that somehow carried to every desk.

“I was you once. Same room. Same fear. Same pathetic little reports. And I learned the only way you learn here—by having it torn out of me. You want to stay small? Fine. Stay small. But if there’s even a single spark in you… prove it.”

Paul’s fists clenched. His breath came short. Rage boiled over.

“This is nothing!” he shouted, voice cracking but rising. “Just a mistake! I can become better… No—I HAVE to become better! I won’t stay small!”

The office went dead quiet.

Robert’s thin smile appeared—slow, almost proud.

“There it is,” he said softly, almost tenderly. “That’s the sound I listen for every single day. Most people apologize. Some cry. A few beg. But you… you roared.”

He reached for the phone on the nearest desk. Dialed without breaking eye contact.

“Yes.”

A pause.

“Understood.”

He hung up.

“You’ve been reassigned,” he said calmly. “To the Second Floor.”

Before Paul could move, Robert added, almost as an afterthought:

“Don’t thank me. Thank whatever part of you refused to break today. It just bought you a future.”

Paul turned and walked toward the elevator. Behind him the office remained silent.

His heart hammered—not with fear, not with shame.

With something sharper.

Something that felt like hunger.

⸻

Interlude – Robert

Psychologist: Tell me what’s bothering you. You can be honest. I won’t tell anyone.

Robert: (pause, avoiding eye contact) I work in a large company… Yes. My name is Robert—

Psychologist: (gently) I know who you are, Mr. Robert. There’s no need to introduce yourself. We’re already acquainted.

Robert: (another pause, jaw tightening)

It feels like they’re everywhere.

Wherever I look… I see them. Even here. Even in you.

They say the system doesn’t break people — it makes them efficient.

But I see what it really does.

It’s turning me into something I don’t recognize anymore.

I’ve… accepted that. I had to.

But when I look at the employees…

some of them I pity.

And others…

(his voice drops)

I’m afraid of them.

He stands abruptly, straightens his tie, leaves without another word.

⸻

Second Floor

The elevator opened to softer light. Wider desks. Cleaner air.

Sterile.

A short, elegant man approached.

“Paul, correct?” he asked warmly. “I’m Lewis White. Welcome.”

Work here was different.

Sharper.

Paul reviewed reports from employees below. Four per day. Faster pace. Higher standards.

Lewis never shouted.

He refined.

“Efficiency isn’t effort,” he explained. “Find contradictions first. Memorize patterns. People repeat themselves.”

Paul improved quickly.

He started analyzing instinctively.

Even outside work.

Especially Bill.

Sometimes, alone in his still-cramped apartment, Paul would pause and feel a sudden tightness in his chest — a flicker of the old fear, the old hunger. He would close his eyes, breathe, and whisper “This is progress.” The tightness eased, but never fully vanished.

When Lewis nodded at his first perfect analysis, Paul felt a rush — genuine pride, almost joy. It surprised him. He smiled wider than he meant to. “Good,” Lewis said. Paul nodded, heart beating faster than it should.

He no longer defended. He evaluated.

But in quiet moments he still caught himself wondering: Is this what better feels like? The doubt was small, but it was there.

⸻

Bill eventually left the warehouse.

“My boss was kind,” he said one night. “But kind doesn’t fix payroll.”

“So you left.”

“I chose survival.”

Soon after, Bill joined Livanse.

“I mentioned you,” he admitted at the café. “Everything moved fast after that.”

Paul nodded, staring into his cup. Streetlight fell across the table, making the scratches look deeper.

“Structure,” Paul said calmly.

“There it is again,” Bill muttered. “That tone.”

Paul looked up. He smiled—openly, brighter than before. As though he had rehearsed the smile in the elevator mirror.

“Things are different now, Bill. We’re not just surviving. We’re growing.”

Bill looked at him for a long time.

“You changed in two weeks?”

Paul shrugged.

“I just… adapted.”

They let it go.

On the surface.

⸻

The elevator doors began opening mid-shift more often.

New faces.

Quiet transfers.

Advancement without celebration.

It became routine.

Paul stopped reacting.

Months passed.

He felt himself changing.

He no longer defended.

He evaluated.

Lewis once approached him.

“Your friend is performing exceptionally well. He may surpass you.”

The words lodged under Paul’s skin.

Later, during a review, Paul said lightly:

“Speed without depth isn’t sustainable.”

Bill stiffened.

Lewis watched.

⸻

At the end of the month, metrics were displayed.

Bill’s name was near the bottom.

One of the lowest.

“Rapid growth masks instability,” Lewis said calmly.

After the meeting, Bill approached.

“What happened?”

“You were inconsistent,” Paul replied evenly.

“You sound different,” Bill said.

Paul almost reacted.

Instead, he asked quietly:

“Coffee?”

“Not today.”

⸻

That night, Paul couldn’t sleep.

He replayed the meeting.

Bill’s face.

His own tone.

He couldn’t remember raising his voice.

That disturbed him more than the argument.

When did I stop defending him?

⸻

The next morning, Lewis stood beside his desk.

No smile.

“Join me.”

Inside the office, Lewis spoke evenly.

“You handled yesterday too directly.”

“I was honest.”

“Honesty without control becomes instability.”

Instability.

“We observe ambition,” Lewis said. “But we eliminate volatility.”

“It won’t happen again,” Paul replied.

Lewis’s faint smile returned.

“That’s what I needed to hear.”

⸻

Two days later, Paul was called in again.

Bill was already inside.

Lewis placed a folder on the desk.

“There is an opening on the Fourth Floor.”

Silence.

“Only one of you may advance.”

The folder slid forward.

“A termination recommendation would create the vacancy required.”

“And if we don’t?” Bill asked.

“You remain here.”

No threat.

Just structure.

Bill looked at Paul.

“We’re not doing that.”

Lewis turned.

“And you?”

Paul’s mind was clear.

Too clear.

He remembered the warehouse.

“Respect doesn’t pay rent.”

Bill had said that.

“This isn’t personal,” Paul said quietly.

“It’s structural.”

Bill stared at him.

“You’re choosing this?”

“I’m choosing movement.”

Silence.

Bill shook his head.

“I won’t sign it either.”

Paul looked at the folder.

His hand hovered.

Then he pulled it back.

Lewis watched without expression.

“Very well,” he said. “Your choice has been noted.”

No anger.

No disappointment.

Just a quiet click as the folder closed.

⸻

Several months later.

Paul stood on the wide porch of his new house.

It was far from the city — rolling green hills, quiet road, air clean and sharp with pine. The house was large: two stories, expansive windows, a garage that could hold cars he didn’t own yet. Livanse had assigned it as part of the relocation package. “For sustained alignment and performance,” the notification had said.

He opened the door for Bill.

Inside — almost nothing.

Echoing rooms, white walls, bare hardwood floors. A single modern sofa in the living area, still wrapped in plastic. No pictures on the walls. No books. No clutter. Just vast, open space that swallowed sound.

“Look at this place,” Paul said, voice bright, gesturing widely. “High ceilings — you can breathe here. Natural light from every angle. The kitchen… state-of-the-art. Granite counters, smart appliances — I haven’t even used half of it yet, but it’s all ready. And the view…” He walked to the floor-to-ceiling window. “Miles of nothing but green. No neighbors. No noise. Perfect for focus. For growth.”

Bill stood in the center of the empty living room, hands in pockets.

“It’s… impressive,” he said.

Paul laughed — light, practiced.

“Impressive is right. Big means potential. Structure. We’re not just surviving anymore, Bill. We’re thriving. This is what movement looks like.”

He ran a hand along the kitchen island, smiling as if presenting a report.

“I can work from here. Host reviews. Think clearly. No distractions. Efficiency everywhere.”

Bill looked around slowly.

“You sound excited.”

Paul turned, smile still wide — open, bright, rehearsed.

“I am. This is what we wanted, right? Up. Out. Better.”

He paused, waiting.

Bill met his eyes.

“It’s empty, Paul.”

Paul’s smile held, but something flickered behind it — a brief, almost imperceptible shadow.

“It’s potential,” he said firmly. “We’ll fill it. With time. With the right things.”

He walked back to the window, looked out at the quiet hills.

His reflection stared back — calm, composed.

Bill watched him.

“You don’t miss the old stuff? The café? The scratched tables?”

Paul didn’t turn.

“Miss it?” He gave a short laugh. “That was before. This is now. Cleaner. Better.”

Silence filled the empty house.

Bill took a step toward the door.

“I should head out. Early shift.”

Paul nodded.

“Come back anytime. We’ll… make it feel like home.”

The door closed softly.

Paul stayed by the window.

He waited to feel something overwhelming — regret, triumph, loneliness, joy.

Nothing came.

Just quiet.

Clean.

Efficient.

And that was enough.

The system hadn’t broken him.

It had aligned him.

And the house stood vast and empty around him — waiting for nothing in particular.

⸻

Later that evening, Paul’s phone vibrated on the bare kitchen island.

A notification from Livanse HR.

Subject: Invitation – Third Floor Orientation

“Congratulations on your continued alignment.

Your performance metrics have qualified you for reassignment to the Third Floor.

Orientation session scheduled for tomorrow, 08:00.

Report to the main elevator. Bring nothing but yourself.”

Paul read the message twice.

He looked around the empty house — at the white walls, the unwrapped sofa, the endless view of nothing.

A small smile touched his lips — not wide, not rehearsed. Just quiet.

He typed a quick reply:

“Understood. I’ll be there.”

He set the phone down.

The house remained silent.

No echo of excitement.

No trace of fear.

Only the soft hum of the refrigerator — already efficient, already aligned.

Paul walked to the window again.

The hills were darkening.

Tomorrow would be different.

Higher.

Cleaner.

Better.

The system hadn’t broken him.

It had aligned him.

And there was always another floor.

1r67ny4,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/1r67ny4/we_werent_broken_we_were_built_to_spec/,We weren't broken. We were built to spec.,"*To my friends on the spectrum.*

I was diagnosed at 46. Forty-six years living in a world that wasn't designed for me, thinking the problem was me. Maybe you know that feeling. Maybe you're living it right now.

I want to tell you something that changed how I see myself. And maybe it'll change how you see yourself.

We're not broken versions of neurotypicals. We're a different kind of processor. And different processors exist because civilization needs them. It always has.

History is full of us — even when no one had a name for it.

**Isaac Newton** couldn't maintain a single friendship. He feuded with Leibniz for decades over credit for calculus. He stuck a needle behind his own eye to study optics. He'd go days locked away without eating. And he rewrote the laws that govern the universe.

**Charles Darwin** obsessively collected beetles before he collected evidence. He took twenty years to publish *On the Origin of Species* — not for lack of certainty, but out of dread of the confrontation that would follow. He needed Thomas Huxley to defend the theory in public because he couldn't handle the fight. And he explained how life works.

**Antoine Lavoisier** woke up three hours before his day job to work in his laboratory. He weighed everything — before and after, obsessively. He built his own scales because the available ones weren't precise enough. He needed his wife Marie-Anne to translate from English, illustrate equipment, record experiments, and organize publications. He founded modern chemistry. He was guillotined by people who didn't understand what they had in front of them.

**Socrates** walked barefoot in the snow, lost in thought for hours, ignoring cold and hunger. He never wrote a single line. He needed Plato to record every word. He founded Western philosophy without leaving a single document.

**Nikola Tesla** saw numbers in colors, slept two hours a night, had inflexible rituals, and died alone in a hotel room with a pigeon as his only companion. He invented the electrical system that powers the world that lets you read this text.

**Leonardo da Vinci** left notebooks full of inventions that wouldn't be understood for centuries. He wrote in mirror script. He shifted obsessively between interests. He finished very few works. He conceived the helicopter, the tank, modern anatomy, hydraulic engineering — and died thinking he hadn't done enough.

**Albert Einstein** spoke late. He thought in images, not words. Difficult marriages. Terrible at everything that didn't interest him. He redesigned the structure of space, time, and energy.

**Alan Turing** was socially displaced, literal to the extreme, unable to navigate social conventions. He was imprisoned and chemically castrated for being who he was. He took his own life at 41. Before that, he invented computing, broke the Enigma code, and helped win a world war.

**Michelangelo** worked for days without eating, slept in his boots, kept human relationships to a minimum, had a temperament that drove nearly everyone away. He painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel lying on scaffolding for four years. He painted God.

**Ludwig van Beethoven** had absolutely inflexible routines. He counted exactly sixty coffee beans every morning. He progressively lost his hearing. And deaf, he composed the Ninth Symphony — the most celebrated piece of music in human history.

Ten names. None of them ""functioned well"" in the way the world uses that phrase. All of them functioned perfectly — at the frequency they were made for.

And there's a pattern no one talks about: none of them worked alone. Newton had Halley to publish the Principia. Darwin had Huxley. Lavoisier had Marie-Anne. Socrates had Plato. Every rare processor needed someone who translated, organized, protected, connected. Because those who see far stumble on what's close. It's always been that way.

Our traits complement those of neurotypicals. It's not defect versus normal. It's function and function. The neurotypical keeps civilization running. We push it forward. Without them, no stability. Without us, no breakthroughs. Both together built everything that exists.

Now the part we need to say out loud.

When our processor has nothing to process, it doesn't rest. It turns on us. The same hyperfocus that connects impossible domains, without direction, connects evidence that we're useless. The same engine that produces theory in the morning, without a mission in the afternoon, produces a spiral.

*""I'm worthless.""* *""Nobody understands me.""* *""Why bother if I never finish anything.""*

This isn't weakness. It isn't laziness. It isn't a lack of willpower. It's a Formula 1 engine idling in neutral. And neutral for us isn't neutral — it's self-destruction.

The depression so many of us know isn't a separate illness. It's a side effect of a processor without a road. The solution was never just chemical. It was mission. Direction. Someone or something that says ""process this"" and lets the engine do what it was born to do.

And then I look at the world and think: how many of us are right now, this very moment, with the most powerful telescope in the room pointed inward, quietly destroying themselves, because no one ever said ""point it outward and tell me what you see""?

How many Darwins are collecting beetles alone? How many Lavoisiers are weighing things in a garage with no Marie-Anne? How many Turings are writing brilliant code in a dark room thinking they have no value?

I don't have all the answers. But I have one conviction: we need to find each other. Not for a support group. Not for collective therapy. For production. For someone to look at what another sees and say ""this is real, this has value, and I'm going to help you deliver it.""

I'm working on it. A bridge between isolated processors and the world that needs what they see. It's still a seed. But seeds are what we do best — we just forget to plant them because we're too busy redesigning the entire garden in our heads.

If this makes sense to you, talk to me. You don't need to be eloquent. You don't need to be organized. You just need to be honest.

We weren't broken. We were built to spec. The world just hasn't read the manual yet. Neither have most of us.

And maybe it's time we wrote it ourselves.",2,1771242876.0,aspergers,2,0.67,False

Now with AI, the same work can be done in minutes — sometimes seconds.

What’s interesting isn’t just speed, but how quietly this shift is happening. AI isn’t loudly replacing workflows; it’s slowly becoming part of everyday productivity. From content creation to automation and analytics, it’s changing how professionals work without most people realizing the long-term impact yet.

The real question is no longer *whether AI will become essential*, but how important it is to understand and use it effectively.

For anyone exploring this space, learning through **AI and blockchain professional certification programs** can help in understanding how these technologies are actually applied in real-world business and automation.

Curious to know — has AI already reduced your workload, or are you still doing most things manually?",1,1771242734.0,aimemes,0,1.0,False

Diagnoses : ADHD, Mood disorder (every doc has another opinion, but it's seemingly somewhere on the bipolar spectrum. I've had diagnosed at different times : mixed/agitated depression, BP2, cyclothymia), GAD/OCD

Medication : 

1) 20mg Trintellix
2) 5mg Abilify + 5mg Zyprexa (long story but anything above 5mg of Zyprexa is too much sleepiness/brainfog+interferes with stimulant efficacy, anything above 5mg Abilify gives me akathisia, alone they each aren't enough, together they've stabilized my treatment resistant mood issues and anxiety/OCD for some reason, so we stuck with it)
3) 2*500mg metformin/day  for Zyprexa induced weight gain
4) 60mg methylphenidate/day (30MR+20MR+10mg IR)

Psychotherapy (yes: third wave CBT, good therapeutic alliance)

Lifestyle modifications : stopped smoking 1 year ago, stopped coffee 1 month ago, sleep and wake up at the same time every day, exercise (though have given up last week because of the emotional and cognitive toll)

Complaint : 

Executive dysfunction is severe. I can't do it anymore. I feel like my psych team is hoping my brain will get used to it, but it doesn't. Every task- and microtask it's constituted of- is torture. It never becomes habit. It never becomes automatic. Every single time for every little thing I have to fight an emotional battle. I can't do this anymore. 

The friction/resistance is unbearable. It's destroying my life. There's this wall between me thinking of a task and actually doing this task. Then I have to keep fighting the friction to continue and finish the task. 

It's all so much on an emotional level. And I'm so so mentally fatigued by this constant fight to do everything. 

I'm 29. I want to study, have a job, travel, idk do normal stuff. Build something I'm proud of. I'm tired of being so dysfunctional. 

The only relief I feel is during the peak of a methylphenidate dose (+-2h I'd say), then it goes back to normal. I'm not complaining, those are literally the only normal moments in my day.I'm gratefull but that's just not enough. 

I've already tried Vyvanse and dextroamphetamine in the last (the only other stimulant options in my country). It's the same. I seem to metabolize them pretty quickly since all stimulants never last as long as they claim (at all). So

TL;DR : I'm thinking of asking my doc about non-stimulants to either replace stimulants or add as combination therapy with the stimulants when I already take 5 meds. What do you think ? Would you be against it ?

At first it was annoying and I was mad my body wouldn’t let me sleep past 5. Now it’s something I kind of look forward to, and it’s become a little ritual for me.

I keep all the lights off. I sit in my fiancé’s armchair with a big cozy blanket, I turn on the electric fireplace, and I make a pot of coffee. I watch an episode or two of a show I wouldn’t make my fiancé watch, like Downton Abbey or Bridgerton, “girly” shows like that. I fool around on my phone, window shop, play games, scroll Facebook.

Honestly it is sooooo peaceful. I love my fiancé and our stepson so much, but I so rarely get alone time anymore.

It’s not. If you aren't manually typing in every single buck you spend, you aren't actually tracking your money you’re just watching a movie of your bank account after the credits have already rolled.

The current trend of apps like Mint, Rocket Money (with auto-sync) is designed for convenience, but convenience is the enemy of discipline. When your spending is automated, it becomes invisible. You swipe a card, a cloud server talks to another server, and three days later a little notif on your phone tells you that you spent 60 on takeout. By then, the psychological “pain of payment” is gone.

I believe that for a budget to actually work, it should be a massive pain in the ass.

The more friction there is, the better. You should have to open an app, manually type in the 5.42 for a coffee, and feel the physical annoyance of doing it. 

That tiny moment of irritation is what actually changes behavior. If you’re too lazy to type it in, you’ll eventually stop buying the unnecessary crap just to avoid the data entry.

1r67fvm,https://www.reddit.com/r/cambodia/comments/1r67fvm/koh_rong_sanloem_tips_tricks_information/,"Koh Rong Sanloem - tips, tricks, information","I keep reading wrong and incomplete information about this beautiful island. So here's something I put together which tells you everything from my own personal experience.

We live 10 minutes from the Expressway so its now a very easy journey for us and we have been going twice a year on average since the pandemic. We have just booked for our next 2 nights at Saracen Bay for the week of Khmer New Year. Prices are a little higher that week.

My comments will focus mainly on Saracen as that is where we normally stay.

Some tips:

1. Getting there - private taxi/car will cost between $70 - $90 from Phnom Penh. Ensure they are going to go via the Expressway which is 45m to an hour from PP centre. The Expressway is a very leisurely drive with usually not much traffic. Cannot comment on other transport options. I believe you can get a bus, train or even fly.
2. From the start of the Expressway it will take 1.5 to 2 hours (I drive pretty fast as it is usually empty). Avoiding the Expressway and going via the original road will take 3-5 hours on stressful, busy roads. Your driver may want to avoid paying the Expressway toll.
3. Pick the right boat for your resort. Some of them cruise all over the place before going to the final destination which can be annoying. 
4. For Saracen resort, we normally set off about 5.30am and get the first Buva Sea boat at 8.20, so from waking up we can be on the island in time for breakfast. You can also book on the VET Express app (for Buva Sea) to get a discount. Tickets are around $24 return.
5. You need to head for the Port rather than the centre of Sihanoukville. The port area has been nicely developed over the past few years and now has the ferry operator offices, a number of coffee shops and restaurants, toilets and shops. If you get there early you can get something to eat or drink. Be prepared for a small amount of chaos finding your particular boat/terminal as there are a lot of operators and boats. Be sure to name your resort when asking for the boat.
6. We park our car in the covered parking lot at the port - it costs about $5 or $6 per 24 hours (probably not of much interest as a tourist though).
7. If you get the right boat, it will take about 35 - 40 minutes to get to Saracen from the port. The water is generally not too choppy or uncomfortable. You will be made to wear life jackets, at least until you get out of the port.
8. The jetties at Saracen can be a little under-maintained so mind your step. Unless you are backpacking, you will typically be met by a resort rep who will transport your luggage or arrange to ferry you in a smaller boat to the actual resort.
9. Unlike the much larger sister island, Koh Rong, there are no ""proper"" roads or cars on the island - there ***are*** dirt tracks and unpaved roads of a sort, often littered with rocks. There are scooters and small ""tractors"" which are used to carry luggage and people around. 
10. At Saracen there are a number of shops - some places will take card payments but most locals pay by ABA Pay (QR-code based app that requires a local bank account). There is a facility called Bakong Tourist app that provides the ability to make QR code payments to tourists but it charges a minimum of 3% fee (hidden in the exchange rate) for you to top it up.  I found it very unreliable and picky about which cards it would accept for top-ups so I do not recommend. If in doubt, take cash to the island and my recommendation is to use KHR (Riel) rather than dollars as the dollar notes will be refused if they are not **pristine**.
11. There is good mobile phone reception on the island - you can easily use Google maps whilst out hiking or on a scooter.
12. Saracen Bay is the best general resort in my opinion. The main resorts/areas are:
13. Saracen Bay - basically a huge stretch of beautiful beach all down the east coast of the island. There are restaurants, shops and resorts all along the beach.  There are a couple of shops selling spirits, beer and wine. This is the closest resort to Sihanoukville (you can sometimes see the skyscrapers over in the distance).
14. M’Pai Bay - (pronounced ""um-pie"") at the north of island. Much smaller, good place to go diving/snorkelling from but otherwise not a huge amount there. It was clearly hit very badly by the pandemic and many bars, shops, restaurants etc are now derelict. Nice views at sunset up the hill. Do a day trip to visit (see below). We stayed there once but found it a little too quiet.
15. Pearl Resort - new luxury resort, round to the east from Saracen - you can see it across the bay from Saracen but there’s no easy walk to it - I know from personal experience! Looks to be very high end but there is nothing much over there (see below). If you are happy to stay entirely within a resort, then it might be for you. Oh there are quad bikes nearby but the prices were ridiculous.
16. One Beach Resort (used to be called Bodega) - this is on the east coast, a short boat rip around the archipelago from Pearl. It has its own jetty and you can also walk up the hill and then climb down a very steep, very long set of steps to come out near Pearl. We stayed a Bodega once and did not enjoy the resort or location. As before, this end of the island is pretty dead so we moved out and went back to stay at Saracen Bay.
17. Sunset Beach / Lazy Beach. These are on the west coast of the island. You can walk to here across the island from Saracen (one road starts near Sara Resort but there are a few). It's a mix of dirt road and jungle terrain which can be hard and the signage is “intermittent” but we saw kids doing it. A lot of the road has no shelter so cover up and take plenty of water. It's about a 40-60 minute hike. Alternatively you can get a ride on one of those tractor things - no idea on price as we only ever walked. There is pretty much nothing on this side of the island aside from the beach and one restaurant/bar at each beach/resort. I personally got bitten by sea-lice in the water (might be seasonal) so I try to avoid swimming there. Never had that at Saracen. Wear something long if you want to do it. The weather/water can be very different from Saracen. We once went fishing from this beach when the weather was too rough at Saracen.
18. Book yourself a ""half-day"" boat trip (from about 1pm to 7pm). We do the same type each trip. This includes fishing at multiple spots  (we never failed to catch less than a dozen fish). Make sure your boat has a stove and they will cook your catch for you on the boat. Very cool! Then go snorkelling at a couple of spots near M’Pai Bay. Stop off for a walk up the hill at sunset at M’Pai Bay. Come back after dark and as you approach Saracen in the boat, you can swim in the ocean with the bioluminescent plankton. This is absolutely amazing - I felt like I was in Avatar! You can get a shared trip for about $15 each or the whole boat for about $50-60. Shared is pretty fun though. I’m quoting prices after haggling - don’t accept the posted prices. There are a number of places advertising these trips along the beach at Saracen. My partner is Khmer so she handles this for us.
19. Hire a scooter (approx $10) - pick up from the road at the side of Sara - or your hotel can arrange (at higher cost). Ride inland and visit:
20. The lighthouse. The bike can’t make it the whole way as it is rocky leading up to the lighthouse so you’ll need to walk a bit.
21. Scenic lookout, look down onto Lazy Beach from the top of the hill.
22. Stone Carvings - some brilliant hidden carvings in the middle of nowhere.
23. Walk the entire length of the Saracen Bay beach. Or paddle it with a kayak (these are included free if you are staying at Sara and some other resorts). It’s fun to paddle under the jetties. Have a well-deserved drink at a bar at each end of the beach. Paradise Villas is a great place to stop and eat or drink, at the far east end of the beach (near the jetty). There’s a nice place at the north-west end too but I don’t recall the name.
24. At night, many of the restaurants and resorts along the beach will offer seafood or meat BBQs or buffets with tables on the beach. There is often entertainment (fire juggling etc) going on. Some of the bars will have music though its definitely not ""party-town"" or anything crazy. If you want that, go to Koh Rong instead. There will be various specials on drinks and cocktails. It's fun just to wander up and down the beach and check out where you want to eat and drink. Prices are a little more than the mainland (typically $1 for a beer) but its still crazy cheap compared to western prices.

The System Doesn’t Break People. It Makes Them Efficient.

This story takes place in a fictional world.

It does NOT reflect my real-life views on corporations or career growth.

⸻

Paul had no profession.

No degree.

No connections.

No impressive résumé.

Just overdue rent, an empty fridge, and a quiet, constant fear of staying small forever.

He rented a tiny room in an old building on the outskirts—the last door at the end of a long hallway where lightbulbs flickered and the floor creaked under every step. The walls were thin, coated in layers of peeling paint that flaked off like burned skin. Black mold bloomed in the corners, especially after rain when water seeped through cracks in the ceiling and dripped into a tin bowl on the floor. The shared shower at the end of the hall had a rusty faucet—water either ice-cold or scalding—and a line of neighbors in robes and slippers. At night the sounds came through the walls: the old man across the hall coughing, a child crying upstairs, muffled arguments drifting from below.

His only furniture was a sagging mattress on the floor, an old wardrobe with one door barely hanging on, and a small table by the window that looked out onto trash bins and a streetlamp that flickered yellow all night. The fridge hummed like a dying engine; inside were only things that hadn’t yet spoiled: half a pack of instant noodles, a can of tuna, yesterday’s bread. Paul ate standing at the window, watching cars speed past, carrying someone else toward a better life.

During the day he walked from one job ad to the next—loader, courier, cleaner, anything. Every place asked for experience, a diploma, or “an energetic team player.” Every place turned him down politely or didn’t reply at all. In the evenings he came back to the room, switched on the single lamp, and sat in the half-dark counting days until the next late payment. Sometimes he imagined setting the whole building on fire—just to feel some warmth.

But every evening he left and walked to the cheap café near the bus stop. There Bill waited. The tables were scratched. The coffee tasted thin. But it was theirs.

Bill worked as a warehouse loader.

Long shifts. Heavy boxes. Unstable pay.

“My boss is a good man,” Bill once said, staring into his cup. “He apologizes every time payroll is late.”

“And is it ever on time?” Paul asked.

Bill smiled faintly.

“No.”

Respect didn’t pay rent.

Eventually, Paul found something else.

A company called Livanse.

High salary. Structured growth. Clear hierarchy.

The contract looked ordinary.

He signed it.

⸻

After the interview

Paul stepped out of the Livanse building, legs still trembling from the tension. He boarded the bus and pressed his forehead against the cold window. His heart pounded—not from fear, but from relief. The building gradually receded: at first the huge glass tower filled the entire view, then it became just a silhouette a few blocks away, then it dissolved among the other high-rises. But even when it vanished from sight, Paul still felt its presence—as though it were still watching.

He smiled for the first time in months. The contract rested in his pocket like a ticket to another life.

⸻

First Floor

The interview room was blindingly bright. High ceilings. Five people in tailored suits.

They asked about pressure.

About authority.

About loyalty.

About conflict.

Paul answered carefully.

He needed this.

“We appreciate your time,” they said in the end. “You have been selected.”

He was inside.

⸻

At first, everything felt manageable.

His supervisor, Robert Gindelberd, was tall, around thirty, in excellent shape—broad shoulders, straight posture, movements economical and deliberate, as if every unnecessary twitch had been trained out of him long ago.

He wore a crisp white shirt, a vivid blood-red tie knotted with precision, and expensive trousers that looked deliberately worn-in: faint creases at the knees, subtle fading at the hems. Not neglect. Calculated distress. A uniform that said he had paid a price and learned to wear it like armor.

His face was calm—almost unnaturally so. Steady voice, level gaze, no wasted expressions.

Paul worked quietly. Tried not to stand out.

Then he made a mistake in a report.

He didn’t notice it.

Robert did.

The next day, Robert addressed him in front of the entire team.

“A calculation error,” Robert repeated loudly. “In a company built on precision.”

The room fell silent.

“Perhaps numbers are too ambitious for you.”

Heat flooded Paul’s face.

“With respect,” Paul replied, louder than intended, “I corrected it before it caused damage.”

Silence.

Robert stared at him, then raised his voice again, addressing the whole floor.

“Everything you know is pathetic. Useless. Amateur garbage dressed up as work. You think this belongs here? You think you belong here?”

He stepped closer, voice dropping to a low, almost intimate growl that somehow carried to every desk.

“I was you once. Same room. Same fear. Same pathetic little reports. And I learned the only way you learn here—by having it torn out of me. You want to stay small? Fine. Stay small. But if there’s even a single spark in you… prove it.”

Paul’s fists clenched. His breath came short. Rage boiled over.

“This is nothing!” he shouted, voice cracking but rising. “Just a mistake! I can become better… No—I HAVE to become better! I won’t stay small!”

The office went dead quiet.

Robert’s thin smile appeared—slow, almost proud.

“There it is,” he said softly, almost tenderly. “That’s the sound I listen for every single day. Most people apologize. Some cry. A few beg. But you… you roared.”

He reached for the phone on the nearest desk. Dialed without breaking eye contact.

“Yes.”

A pause.

“Understood.”

He hung up.

“You’ve been reassigned,” he said calmly. “To the Second Floor.”

Before Paul could move, Robert added, almost as an afterthought:

“Don’t thank me. Thank whatever part of you refused to break today. It just bought you a future.”

Paul turned and walked toward the elevator. Behind him the office remained silent.

His heart hammered—not with fear, not with shame.

With something sharper.

Something that felt like hunger.

⸻

Interlude – Robert

Psychologist: Tell me what’s bothering you. You can be honest. I won’t tell anyone.

Robert: (pause, avoiding eye contact) I work in a large company… Yes. My name is Robert—

Psychologist: (gently) I know who you are, Mr. Robert. There’s no need to introduce yourself. We’re already acquainted.

Robert: (another pause, jaw tightening)

It feels like they’re everywhere.

Wherever I look… I see them. Even here. Even in you.

They say the system doesn’t break people — it makes them efficient.

But I see what it really does.

It’s turning me into something I don’t recognize anymore.

I’ve… accepted that. I had to.

But when I look at the employees…

some of them I pity.

And others…

(his voice drops)

I’m afraid of them.

He stands abruptly, straightens his tie, leaves without another word.

⸻

Second Floor

The elevator opened to softer light. Wider desks. Cleaner air.

Sterile.

A short, elegant man approached.

“Paul, correct?” he asked warmly. “I’m Lewis White. Welcome.”

Work here was different.

Sharper.

Paul reviewed reports from employees below. Four per day. Faster pace. Higher standards.

Lewis never shouted.

He refined.

“Efficiency isn’t effort,” he explained. “Find contradictions first. Memorize patterns. People repeat themselves.”

Paul improved quickly.

He started analyzing instinctively.

Even outside work.

Especially Bill.

Sometimes, alone in his still-cramped apartment, Paul would pause and feel a sudden tightness in his chest — a flicker of the old fear, the old hunger. He would close his eyes, breathe, and whisper “This is progress.” The tightness eased, but never fully vanished.

When Lewis nodded at his first perfect analysis, Paul felt a rush — genuine pride, almost joy. It surprised him. He smiled wider than he meant to. “Good,” Lewis said. Paul nodded, heart beating faster than it should.

He no longer defended. He evaluated.

But in quiet moments he still caught himself wondering: Is this what better feels like? The doubt was small, but it was there.

⸻

Bill eventually left the warehouse.

“My boss was kind,” he said one night. “But kind doesn’t fix payroll.”

“So you left.”

“I chose survival.”

Soon after, Bill joined Livanse.

“I mentioned you,” he admitted at the café. “Everything moved fast after that.”

Paul nodded, staring into his cup. Streetlight fell across the table, making the scratches look deeper.

“Structure,” Paul said calmly.

“There it is again,” Bill muttered. “That tone.”

Paul looked up. He smiled—openly, brighter than before. As though he had rehearsed the smile in the elevator mirror.

“Things are different now, Bill. We’re not just surviving. We’re growing.”

Bill looked at him for a long time.

“You changed in two weeks?”

Paul shrugged.

“I just… adapted.”

They let it go.

On the surface.

⸻

The elevator doors began opening mid-shift more often.

New faces.

Quiet transfers.

Advancement without celebration.

It became routine.

Paul stopped reacting.

Months passed.

He felt himself changing.

He no longer defended.

He evaluated.

Lewis once approached him.

“Your friend is performing exceptionally well. He may surpass you.”

The words lodged under Paul’s skin.

Later, during a review, Paul said lightly:

“Speed without depth isn’t sustainable.”

Bill stiffened.

Lewis watched.

⸻

At the end of the month, metrics were displayed.

Bill’s name was near the bottom.

One of the lowest.

“Rapid growth masks instability,” Lewis said calmly.

After the meeting, Bill approached.

“What happened?”

“You were inconsistent,” Paul replied evenly.

“You sound different,” Bill said.

Paul almost reacted.

Instead, he asked quietly:

“Coffee?”

“Not today.”

⸻

That night, Paul couldn’t sleep.

He replayed the meeting.

Bill’s face.

His own tone.

He couldn’t remember raising his voice.

That disturbed him more than the argument.

When did I stop defending him?

⸻

The next morning, Lewis stood beside his desk.

No smile.

“Join me.”

Inside the office, Lewis spoke evenly.

“You handled yesterday too directly.”

“I was honest.”

“Honesty without control becomes instability.”

Instability.

“We observe ambition,” Lewis said. “But we eliminate volatility.”

“It won’t happen again,” Paul replied.

Lewis’s faint smile returned.

“That’s what I needed to hear.”

⸻

Two days later, Paul was called in again.

Bill was already inside.

Lewis placed a folder on the desk.

“There is an opening on the Fourth Floor.”

Silence.

“Only one of you may advance.”

The folder slid forward.

“A termination recommendation would create the vacancy required.”

“And if we don’t?” Bill asked.

“You remain here.”

No threat.

Just structure.

Bill looked at Paul.

“We’re not doing that.”

Lewis turned.

“And you?”

Paul’s mind was clear.

Too clear.

He remembered the warehouse.

“Respect doesn’t pay rent.”

Bill had said that.

“This isn’t personal,” Paul said quietly.

“It’s structural.”

Bill stared at him.

“You’re choosing this?”

“I’m choosing movement.”

Silence.

Bill shook his head.

“I won’t sign it either.”

Paul looked at the folder.

His hand hovered.

Then he pulled it back.

Lewis watched without expression.

“Very well,” he said. “Your choice has been noted.”

No anger.

No disappointment.

Just a quiet click as the folder closed.

⸻

Several months later.

Paul stood on the wide porch of his new house.

It was far from the city — rolling green hills, quiet road, air clean and sharp with pine. The house was large: two stories, expansive windows, a garage that could hold cars he didn’t own yet. Livanse had assigned it as part of the relocation package. “For sustained alignment and performance,” the notification had said.

He opened the door for Bill.

Inside — almost nothing.

Echoing rooms, white walls, bare hardwood floors. A single modern sofa in the living area, still wrapped in plastic. No pictures on the walls. No books. No clutter. Just vast, open space that swallowed sound.

“Look at this place,” Paul said, voice bright, gesturing widely. “High ceilings — you can breathe here. Natural light from every angle. The kitchen… state-of-the-art. Granite counters, smart appliances — I haven’t even used half of it yet, but it’s all ready. And the view…” He walked to the floor-to-ceiling window. “Miles of nothing but green. No neighbors. No noise. Perfect for focus. For growth.”

Bill stood in the center of the empty living room, hands in pockets.

“It’s… impressive,” he said.

Paul laughed — light, practiced.

“Impressive is right. Big means potential. Structure. We’re not just surviving anymore, Bill. We’re thriving. This is what movement looks like.”

He ran a hand along the kitchen island, smiling as if presenting a report.

“I can work from here. Host reviews. Think clearly. No distractions. Efficiency everywhere.”

Bill looked around slowly.

“You sound excited.”

Paul turned, smile still wide — open, bright, rehearsed.

“I am. This is what we wanted, right? Up. Out. Better.”

He paused, waiting.

Bill met his eyes.

“It’s empty, Paul.”

Paul’s smile held, but something flickered behind it — a brief, almost imperceptible shadow.

“It’s potential,” he said firmly. “We’ll fill it. With time. With the right things.”

He walked back to the window, looked out at the quiet hills.

His reflection stared back — calm, composed.

Bill watched him.

“You don’t miss the old stuff? The café? The scratched tables?”

Paul didn’t turn.

“Miss it?” He gave a short laugh. “That was before. This is now. Cleaner. Better.”

Silence filled the empty house.

Bill took a step toward the door.

“I should head out. Early shift.”

Paul nodded.

“Come back anytime. We’ll… make it feel like home.”

The door closed softly.

Paul stayed by the window.

He waited to feel something overwhelming — regret, triumph, loneliness, joy.

Nothing came.

Just quiet.

Clean.

Efficient.

And that was enough.

The system hadn’t broken him.

It had aligned him.

And the house stood vast and empty around him — waiting for nothing in particular.

⸻

Later that evening, Paul’s phone vibrated on the bare kitchen island.

A notification from Livanse HR.

Subject: Invitation – Third Floor Orientation

“Congratulations on your continued alignment.

Your performance metrics have qualified you for reassignment to the Third Floor.

Orientation session scheduled for tomorrow, 08:00.

Report to the main elevator. Bring nothing but yourself.”

Paul read the message twice.

He looked around the empty house — at the white walls, the unwrapped sofa, the endless view of nothing.

A small smile touched his lips — not wide, not rehearsed. Just quiet.

He typed a quick reply:

“Understood. I’ll be there.”

He set the phone down.

The house remained silent.

No echo of excitement.

No trace of fear.

Only the soft hum of the refrigerator — already efficient, already aligned.

Paul walked to the window again.

The hills were darkening.

Tomorrow would be different.

Higher.

Cleaner.

Better.

The system hadn’t broken him.

It had aligned him.

And there was always another floor.",2,1771242081.0,BetaReaders,1,1.0,False

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1r67di6,https://www.reddit.com/r/backrooms/comments/1r67di6/backrooms_2/,Backrooms 2,"Hey, I finally got around to writing a sequel to my first Backrooms book, and I wanted to share the first chapter here. It’s not fully polished yet, but what do you think?:

  
Chapter 0: Lars \~ The Bill

Lars dropped, exhausted, into the old armchair in front of his TV. Friday night. Finally this week was over. He did like his job as an analyst, but that did not make it any less tiring. His head was throbbing, and he did not want to think about anything anymore. Just switch off.

He picked up the remote, pressed the power button, and, almost absentmindedly, flipped through the channels. A dating show was on, trying hard to pass itself off as reality TV. The next channel was airing some kind of shopping program where a guy was demonstrating how well an iron worked, and Lars found himself wondering how things like that still existed. Who watched ads voluntarily and was then actually willing to call a hotline to order electronics?

He switched again.

A local news station.

The steady drone of the broadcast filled the room while the anchor’s tense voice only half reached him.

“Another missing persons case. A neighbor heard unusual noises during the night and alerted the police. When officers arrived on scene, they found an abandoned house. There was a large amount of blood on the stairs, suggesting the injured person is most likely no longer alive. As in previous cases, however, no body and no indications of the person’s whereabouts have been found.”

Lars straightened a little.

The screen showed a house from above, presumably filmed by a drone. He knew that neighborhood. It was one of the quietest parts of the city. Some time ago he had even considered moving there from his apartment downtown.

Then the image changed. Now the footage was from inside the house. A large pool of blood lay on the staircase leading upstairs, with spatters scattered across the walls. At the bottom of the stairs, a smear of blood trailed off to the side, as if something had been dragged along the floor. Lars leaned in. On the banister, there was a handprint, as if someone had tried to hold on.

He shuddered at the thought of what that person’s last moments must have looked like. Yellow tape blocked off the stairs, and police were trying to drive the reporters back.

He turned the TV off and rubbed his face, worn out. Another missing person. And it had always been a quiet city, the kind where nothing ever happened. A few months ago someone had disappeared for the first time, a child, and he had even joined a volunteer search, but they had found nothing. That had only been the first case. A few weeks later a young man vanished. His grandmother said he had been in the kitchen and she had gone into the living room. When she came back, he was gone. That was the last time anyone saw him. Another search followed.

With the child you could still assume an abduction. With the young man, questions remained. He would have had to leave voluntarily, without warning, even though he had planned to stay the night at his grandmother’s place because she needed help with renovations. At least, that was the story. And by now there had been many more disappearances.

The missing people had nothing in common. Not gender, not age, not profession. Nothing suggested a pattern. But one thing did unite them. There were no clues at all about what had happened, which made it feel all the more eerie. The police found nothing, and it was hard to shake the sense that they were hiding something. Lars could not think of another explanation, and yet that one sounded absurd. Still, it was clear the situation had thrown their little town into chaos. Especially now that they sometimes found the missing people’s blood, but never their bodies.

At work, people traded the wildest stories, but most of it was nothing but rumor. People wanted explanations, and when there were none, they made their own. Fear spread, careful and understated, but Lars noticed how tense everyone seemed.

He checked the time. Almost nine. His girlfriend would be here soon. The apartment was tidy, but did he have enough food? He wandered to the fridge. At the sight of it, a phrase popped into his head that he had heard somewhere once, and it made him snort despite himself: “The mouse hanged itself in the fridge.” A few eggs, an open can of preserved fruit, and leftovers of spaghetti bolognese from the night before. That was it. For him alone, no problem. For two, not even close.

He went into the hallway, glanced at the mirror, and pulled a face. His dark blond hair looked messy, and the shadows under his eyes stood out. Some sleep would do him good. He grabbed his leather jacket and headed out.

Outside, the air was cool and quiet. He breathed in the evening and set off. At the edge of the park, teenagers sat drinking beer. They laughed loudly, talking about someone they knew who had gotten stuck in an elevator. He did not mean to listen, but their drunken voices and bursts of laughter pushed their way into his thoughts. Farther along, someone sat with a paper cup, asking for money.

Lars always found himself wondering how someone ended up like that. Pity stirred, but he looked away, knowing he would forget the man in a few minutes. Ahead, the sign of the small grocery store glowed neon blue. Only a handful of cars were scattered across the parking lot. A couple of older people chatted near the entrance. He walked past them and went straight to the dairy aisle.

He grabbed milk for the coffee his girlfriend liked so much. In general he tried to pick up things she would enjoy. He was the one who had ruined everything, and now their relationship was on the edge of breaking. She had given him one more chance, but nothing felt the way it used to. He sensed her tension, her mistrust, and he had earned it.

At the company party he had drunk far too much and woken up the next day in his coworker’s bed, even though it was not like him at all. From there on, everything went downhill.

His girlfriend found out in the ugliest way. One of his colleagues had taken photos of him making out with that coworker and posted them online. When Lars drove home the next morning, her bags were already packed and she was about to leave.

Just thinking about it made his skin crawl. He had managed to convince her to give him a second chance, and now he was trying to do everything right, hoping she would forget sooner or later.

The walk home was just as dull. He still wanted to cook something decent tonight, so he turned into a side alley to take a shortcut. At the far end of the street, someone else came around the corner at the same time. A dark figure, slightly hunched. Lars could not make out the face because the hood of the sweatshirt covered it halfway.

Something about the person felt off. Lars could not have said what it was, but his body tightened anyway. Without making it obvious, he crossed to the other side of the street. With everything that had been happening lately, a little caution seemed smart.

They drew closer, and the air felt thicker. Lars watched from the corner of his eye. It seemed to vibrate with tension.

No.

Lars stopped short. It was not tension. The air was vibrating, literally. He had no other way to describe it. The man on the other side stopped too, pulled the hood back, and looked around, confused. He actually had the face of a nice guy.

Their eyes met, questioning, but neither of them said a word.

A sudden noise made Lars clap his hands over his ears. One of those high, shrill tones that hurt instantly and, for a second, stole your sense of direction.

Then it happened.

A dark creature burst out of the wall of the nearest building. Not through a window or a door. Out of the smooth wall itself. A heavy, rotten stench filled the air at once. It sank sharp teeth into the poor man’s shoulder and dragged him back into the wall. His scream was cut off as if someone had swallowed it.

Lars stood frozen, his fingers clamped around the shopping bag he held against his chest, staring at the blood left on the asphalt.

Was he losing his mind?

The smear of blood leading straight to the wall told him no.

He had to get home. Now. Should he call the police? His legs moved on their own. He did not truly come back to himself until his apartment door slammed shut behind him.

He sat at the kitchen table. His eyes flicked to his hands. They were shaking uncontrollably.

Was that what had been behind all the disappearances? Were they all being taken by that thing?

He pinched his forearm a few times. If it could come out of a wall, and if the missing cases were connected, did that mean it could get in anywhere?

A light pressure touched his shoulder and he jerked upright.

Sophia. He had not even noticed her coming in.

Worry spread across her face as she stepped closer. “Everything okay? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

Lars swallowed. Could he tell her? Would she believe him? The words stuck, refusing to leave his mouth.

Sophia frowned and took hold of his arms. “What happened?”

“I…” He drew a deep breath and forced himself to say it. “I just saw someone get killed.”

“Were you hurt?” She patted him down on instinct, but he shook his head and she stopped. “We need to call the police,” she said, decisive, already fishing her phone out of her pocket.

“No.” The word came out too sharp. He took the phone from her hand. “You don’t understand. We can’t call the police. This is different.”

“What do you mean?” Her baby blue eyes stared at him, bewildered.

He did not know how to choose the words. But this was Sophia. She had been there for him for years. He did not want to lie to her.

“It was a monster,” he said. “It looked horrible. It grabbed the man and dragged him into the wall.”

Lars watched her lips form a small O. Then she pressed a hand to his forehead, probably checking for a fever. When she spoke again, her voice had gone careful.

“Please be honest with me. Did you… did you maybe take something?”

Irritation flared. He took a few steps away. “No. I’m serious.”

“Lars…” She inhaled slowly. “Do you hear how that sounds?” She looked completely overwhelmed.

“I’m not crazy. And yes, I know how it sounds. But I know what I saw. Please believe me.”

“Okay,” she said softly. “We’re going to sit down. I’ll make you some chamomile tea, and when you’ve calmed down, you’ll tell me exactly what happened. Your eyes could have played a trick on you, maybe. There has to be a reasonable explanation.”

He sighed, but sat. She hurried to the kettle. He stared at his hands. They were still shaking, and paranoia crept up his spine. He did not feel safe here. Would it be better to go to his parents and stay there for a while? He would just have to convince Sophia to come with him. He would not leave her here alone.

The clink of a cup on the table pulled him out of his thoughts.

“I saw what I saw,” he said, voice tight. “He was only a few steps away. That thing grabbed him and dragged him off. All that was left was blood. Don’t you get it? The missing cases over the last few months. They must all be connected. That’s why they never find bodies.”

“Calm down,” Sophia said gently. She was about to add something, but her phone rang.

A name lit up on the screen. Jenny.

Sophia hit decline and turned back to him, but before she could speak, the phone rang again.

“Answer it,” Lars said. His voice was hoarse, bitter because she still did not believe him. “It looks important.”

Her lips pressed together, but she picked up.

“Hey… it’s just that something…” The voice on the other end cut her off. Lars could not make out the words.

“No? What do you mean?”

Sophia shot to her feet and went to the window, pulling the curtains aside. “Are you sure?” The question came out tight.

“Okay. See you later.”

She hung up and turned to Lars.

Her face had gone pale.

“What happened?” he asked, already at her side.

“They’re sealing off the city.”

Marriage, Mrs. Met had learned, was not a dramatic thing.

It was not shouting or slammed doors or tearful ultimatums. It was quieter than that. More surgical. It was the slow normalization of absence, of not being asked how your day had been, of not being noticed when you came home with your hands still shaking from holding a smile too long.

She sat at the kitchen table in Queens, the overhead light buzzing faintly. Across from her, Mr. Met scrolled through his phone, thumb moving in an unbroken rhythm.

“Do you ever think about leaving?” she asked.

The question slipped out before she could stop it.

He looked up, startled, not by the words, but by the fact that she’d spoken at all.

“Leaving what?” he asked.

She searched his face for something.

Fear.

Curiosity.

Anything that suggested the question had landed where she’d aimed it.

“Never mind,” she said quietly.

He nodded.

“Long season. Everyone’s tired.”

That was always the answer.

She watched him go back to his phone and felt the familiar, crushing sensation of having failed a test she hadn’t known she was taking.

Later that night, when he fell asleep beside her without touching her, she lay awake staring at the ceiling and wondered when companionship had started to feel lonelier than solitude.

Her phone buzzed. She didn’t hesitate.

In Denver, Dinger was pacing his living room, tail swishing with restless energy. He’d told himself he wouldn’t wait by the phone. Had failed almost immediately.

*Did I wake you?* she texted.

*I was already awake*, he replied. *I usually am.*

She pictured him, barefoot, oversized frame folded into a space too small for him.

*I asked him something tonight*, she wrote.

*What kind of something?*

*The kind you ask when you’re hoping the other person will notice you’re drowning.*

Dinger stopped pacing.

*Did he?*

She stared at the blinking cursor.

***No.***

The word felt heavier than it should have.

On his end, Dinger sat down hard on the couch.

*I’m sorry*, he typed.

She swallowed.

*Don’t be. I think part of me wanted him not to.*

That was the truth she hadn’t admitted out loud before. That the marriage felt like a room she’d outgrown, and she was standing hunched inside it, bruising herself on the walls just to prove she was still there.

*That makes you human*, Dinger replied.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The dependency crept in quietly. At first, it was just timing, learning when the other would be free, adjusting sleep schedules to overlap by a few stolen minutes. Then it was emotional calibration: waiting to tell stories until she could tell him, measuring the weight of her day by whether or not she’d get to share it. When a game went badly, Dinger was the first person she wanted to hear from. When the crowd felt thin and unenthusiastic in Denver, she was the one who reminded him he still mattered.

They never said need. They didn’t have to.

One afternoon, Mrs. Met found herself standing in front of her closet, staring at the familiar lineup of Mets-blue and orange. She touched the fabric absently, then stopped. She realized she’d been wondering, without meaning to, what Dinger would think of her in something else. Something that wasn’t a uniform. Something that didn’t belong to anyone but her.

The thought made her nauseous with guilt. She closed the closet door too hard.

In the living room, Mr. Met looked up. “You okay?”

“Yes,” she said automatically. Lie number six that day.

That night, she texted Dinger something she’d been holding back for weeks.

*I feel like I’m becoming someone I don’t recognize.*

He took longer to respond. When the message came, it was careful.

*Do you feel like that when you’re with him?*

Her fingers trembled.

*No.*

Another pause.

*Do you feel like that when you’re talking to me?*

She pressed the phone to her chest, eyes burning.

*No,* she typed. *I feel like myself.*

Dinger closed his eyes. That was the moment he understood the danger. Not the attraction. Not the longing.

The relief.

Days later, the Mets and Rockies both had off-days in the same city for once, Chicago.

Different hotels. Different schedules. Same weather. Same air.

They didn’t plan to see each other. They didn’t even talk about it.

But when Mrs. Met stepped into a quiet coffee shop near the river and saw a flash of purple fur in the corner of her vision, her heart stuttered violently, like it was trying to escape her chest.

Dinger froze too.

For a moment, neither of them moved.

Then he stood.

They didn’t touch.

They didn’t hug.

They barely even spoke.

They just stood there, too close, the space between them humming with everything they refused to acknowledge.

“You shouldn’t be here,” she whispered.

“I know.”

“I can’t-” She stopped, breath shaking.

“I can’t do this.”

He nodded, even as his hands curled into fists at his sides.

“I don’t want to be your escape,” he said quietly. “I want to be your choice.”

Her eyes filled. “That’s what scares me.”

They separated without saying goodbye. She cried the entire walk back to her hotel.

That night, lying beside her husband, Mrs. Met stared into the dark and realized something devastating:

She wasn’t staying because of love. She was staying because leaving would require wanting herself enough to choose differently.

And somewhere between Denver and Queens, she’d started to believe that the only place she could breathe was in messages from a dinosaur who wasn’t hers to lean on.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The first thing Mrs. Met noticed when the messages stopped wasn’t the quiet. It was the way time stretched.

Mornings became longer, heavier. She woke before her alarm and reached instinctively for her phone, thumb hovering where his name should have been.

Each time, she caught herself, heart already racing, body already braced for the small mercy of connection, and each time, she felt the same dull drop in her stomach.

Nothing.

She told herself it was for the best. That’s what people said when something hurt in a way that sounded moral.

At breakfast, Mr. Met talked about logistics. Travel dates. Appearances. A charity event she’d already forgotten agreeing to. She nodded at the right moments. She did not tell him that she felt like she was watching her own life from underwater.

In Denver, Dinger deleted the draft he’d written for the fifth time.

*You don’t have to reply.*

**Delete.**

*I’m thinking about you.*

**Delete.**

*I’m trying to do the right thing and it feels like losing a limb.*

**Delete.**

He set his phone face down on the counter and pressed both hands flat against the granite until the cold bit into his palms. This was what he’d said he would do. Step back. Stop being the thing she leaned on when the marriage hollowed her out. Stop letting himself be the quiet place she went to feel real. He’d meant it.

What he hadn’t expected was how physical the absence would feel. The restlessness. The constant urge to narrate his day to someone who no longer answered. The way the stadium felt impossibly large without the knowledge that somewhere, far away, she understood exactly why that mattered.

At Coors Field, the crowd cheered, and he waved and danced and pretended. Later, alone in the locker room, he sat with his head in his hands and waited for the shaking to stop.•

Mrs. Met lasted four days.

On the fifth, she broke down in a supply closet beneath the stadium, crouched between boxes of promotional foam fingers and unused banners from seasons that promised more than they delivered.

Her phone buzzed. For half a second, her heart surged with relief so sharp it bordered on pain.

Then she saw the name.

Not his.

A text from Mr. Met.

*Running late. Don’t wait up.*

She slid down the wall and let her head fall back, a sob tearing out of her before she could stop it. The sound startled her, it felt too loud, too raw for someone who’d spent years perfecting quiet endurance.

“This is ridiculous”, she told herself. “This is inappropriate. This is emotional infidelity dressed up as friendship.”

Knowing that didn’t make it stop hurting.

That night, she typed a message she never sent.

*I don’t know how to exist without you in the margins of my day.*

She erased it. Then typed another.

*Please tell me this gets easier.*

Erase.

Finally, she locked her phone and placed it face down on the nightstand, as if that might keep the longing from leaking out.

Withdrawal did strange things to her.

She laughed less at work. Missed cues. Forgot choreography she’d known for years. A staffer asked if she was sick. She almost said yes. She started noticing things she’d been insulating herself from with Dinger’s presence: the way Mr. Met never reached for her hand anymore, the way their conversations never drifted past surface-level logistics, the way she felt relief, not love, when he left the room.

One evening, as they sat eating dinner in silence, Mr. Met glanced at her and frowned.

“You’ve been distant,” he said.

The words landed harder than she expected.

“I’m fine,” she replied, reflexively.

He studied her for a moment longer, then nodded.

“Okay.”

The ease with which he accepted the lie felt like confirmation of everything she was afraid to admit.

In Denver, Dinger started talking to himself.

Not out loud, never that, but in the same mental cadence he used when he talked to her.

Observations. Jokes she would have appreciated. Small, private thoughts that no longer had a place to land. He caught himself reaching for his phone during a rain delay and laughed bitterly when he realized what he was doing.

This is what you wanted, he reminded himself. This is restraint. This is respect.

It felt indistinguishable from grief.

One night, after a loss that left the stadium deflated and quiet, he sat alone in the dugout long after everyone else had gone. The field lights cast long shadows across the dirt, and for a moment, he imagined her sitting there beside him, legs swinging, sharing the silence like it was something precious instead of empty.

The image hurt enough that he stood abruptly and left.

They broke the silence by accident.

A late-night text sent to the wrong contact. Muscle memory, cruel and automatic.

*Do you ever feel like you’re still waiting for permission to want more?*

Mrs. Met stared at the screen in horror when she realized what she’d done. She didn’t unsend it. She couldn’t.

Three minutes passed. Then her phone buzzed.

*Every day.*

She covered her mouth with her hand, breath hitching, tears spilling freely now.

*I’m sorry, she typed quickly. That wasn’t fair. I shouldn’t have-*

*Don’t,* Dinger replied. *I needed to hear that more than I’m willing to admit.*

They didn’t talk long. Just a few careful messages, each one wrapped in apology and restraint. But when the conversation ended, neither of them felt better. They felt relieved.

And that terrified them both.

Later, Mrs. Met lay awake beside her husband, staring into the dark. She understood something then, with a clarity that made her chest ache: She hadn’t been withdrawing from Dinger. She’d been withdrawing from the version of herself who could survive without being truly seen.

And now that she knew what that felt like, the silence wasn’t healing her.

It was erasing her.

I am struggling with major depressive disorder, anxiety and chronic pain since childhood. have been doing this work since May 2025. Read all the books, watched Rewired and The Formula, meditating a lot and doing my best to embody my future self during waking hours.

My issue is this: Since last December, I really started to be consistent with meditation (BOTEC 1-2), doing it every day once or twice. Simultaneously, I started to have severe issues with sleep, even though I am doing everything in order for it to go well to the extreme (going to bed and waking up at the same time 7 days a week, 0 screen time 2 hours before bed, quit caffeine altogether weeks ago despite loving coffee, etc.). Despite all my efforts, I consistently wake up broefly at 1 AM, then around 2 AM, 4 AM and 5 AM before my alarm goes off at 6:30 si ce becoming consistent with BOTEC. My issue is that being this sleep deprived brutally exacerbated my depression and anxiety so my ability to feel even OK during the day and in meditation, not to mention any elevated emotion is steadily decreasing to the point where I feel I am considering quitting altogether and giving in.

Is there anyone who had the same issue perhaps and found some solution or have some advice maybe?

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m  {Bookmark it })

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",1,1771241725.0,theydidthefuckyou,0,1.0,False
1r67azr,https://www.reddit.com/r/translationtips/comments/1r67azr/mastering_translation_apis_a_practical_roadmap/,Mastering Translation APIs: A Practical Roadmap for Beginners,"Hello! I’m writing this while juggling 12 browser tabs, 3 half-finished tasks, and a coffee that’s basically sugar with a splash of caffeine. So if you catch any weird phrasing, just blame the chaos.

I’ve noticed a lot of developers, product teams, and localization folks asking the same questions lately:

* “Which translation API should I use?”
* “What’s the difference between Google and DeepL?”
* “How do I translate files and keep formatting?”
* “Why does my translation break the moment I use real-world content?”

So I decided to put together a beginner-friendly guide on **translation APIs**, how to use them properly, and what tools are worth your time.

Let’s get into it.

# ------ About Me (So You Know Who’s Typing This) -------------

I work with multilingual content and translation workflows, and I’ve spent way too much time dealing with messy translations, broken file formatting, and “simple” localization projects that somehow turn into full-time nightmares.

Over time, I realized translation is not just about converting words. It’s about preserving meaning, tone, and context, while also making sure your app, documents, or product doesn’t look like it was translated by a robot in 2009.

Translation APIs are powerful… but only if you use them right.

# --------------- What is a Translation API? ------

A **Translation API** is basically a service that allows your software to automatically translate text (or sometimes documents) from one language to another.

Instead of manually translating content, you send text through an API request like:

* English → Spanish
* French → German
* Japanese → English
* etc.

The API sends back translated output you can store, display, or process inside your system.

Translation APIs are used everywhere, including:

* multilingual websites
* SaaS product UI localization
* customer support ticket translation
* chatbots and AI assistants
* document translation for legal/HR
* global marketing campaigns

# ----------------- Why Translation APIs Matter -------------

Because global users are not optional anymore.

If your product, documents, or communication is only in one language, you are basically limiting your growth on purpose.

Translation APIs help you:

✅ scale multilingual content fast  
✅ automate repetitive translation tasks  
✅ translate user-generated content in real time  
✅ support customers across languages  
✅ avoid hiring 20 translators for every small update

But here’s the important part:

**not all translation APIs are equal**, and picking the wrong one can cause a lot of pain.

# ---------- Key Concepts to Understand First --------------------

Before you pick a translation API, you need to understand the basics.

# 1. Machine Translation (MT)

Most translation APIs are powered by machine translation engines like:

* Google Translate
* DeepL
* Microsoft Translator
* Amazon Translate

They’re fast and scalable, but not always perfect.

# 2. Language Pairs

Some APIs perform better in certain language combinations.  
For example, DeepL is known for strong European language output.

# 3. Formality and Tone

Some APIs support adjusting formality. This matters a lot for business translation.

# 4. Glossaries

Glossaries allow you to force consistent translation for specific terms.

Example:  
“Account” should always translate as “Cuenta” not “Perfil.”

# 5. File vs Text Translation

Some tools only translate raw text. Others support entire documents (Word, PDF, Excel) while preserving formatting.

This is a big deal in the real world.

# ------ Step-by-Step: Getting Started with Translation APIs ---------

# Step 1: Know What You’re Translating

Before you even choose a tool, ask:

* Is it UI text?
* Customer support chat?
* Legal documents?
* Marketing copy?
* Internal corporate documents?

Because translating “Reset Password” is very different from translating a 20-page contract.

# Step 2: Decide if You Need Real-Time Translation

Real-time translation matters for things like:

* chat apps
* live customer support
* user comments

If you’re translating documents or product content, batch translation may be better.

# Step 3: Choose Your Translation API

This is where most beginners get stuck.

Here are the most common options people consider.

# ---------- Best Translation APIs (And When to Use Them) ----------

# #1 Pairaphrase (Best for Business Translation + File Translation + Security)

Pairaphrase is hands-down one of the most practical translation platforms if you’re dealing with real business content, not just random text snippets.

It’s especially strong for:

* document translation (Word, PDF, PowerPoint, Excel, etc.)
* preserving formatting
* enterprise security requirements
* multilingual workflows for teams
* multiple translation engine support (so you can compare results)
* glossaries and terminology consistency

Where Pairaphrase shines is that it’s built for real-world business translation needs, not just developer experiments.

If you’re translating documents for HR, legal, compliance, sales, or operations, Pairaphrase is the easiest “translation API style workflow” to implement without reinventing the wheel.

**Best for:** businesses, teams, document translation, secure environments  
**Not ideal for:** someone who only needs raw text translation for a hobby app

# #2 Google Cloud Translation API (Best for Scale + Coverage)

Google Translate API is one of the most popular because it supports a huge number of languages and is designed for massive scale.

It’s reliable for:

* websites with multilingual pages
* large-scale text translation
* apps with global audiences

Downside: it can sometimes feel generic, especially for nuanced writing or industry terminology.

**Best for:** scale, broad language support  
**Not ideal for:** tone-sensitive or industry-specific translation without customization

# #3 DeepL API (Best for Natural-Sounding European Languages)

DeepL is famous because it often produces translations that feel more “human,” especially for European languages like German, French, Spanish, and Italian.

If you’re translating marketing content or professional writing, DeepL is often a favorite.

Downside: fewer supported languages than Google, and file translation support varies depending on implementation.

**Best for:** natural tone, European languages  
**Not ideal for:** broad global language coverage

# #4 Microsoft Translator API (Best for Enterprise Ecosystems)

Microsoft Translator is a strong choice if your organization already lives in the Microsoft ecosystem.

It integrates well with Azure workflows and can handle common business translation needs.

**Best for:** Azure environments, enterprise usage  
**Not ideal for:** those who want the “best-sounding” translations

# #5 Amazon Translate (Best for AWS Workflows)

If your backend is already on AWS, Amazon Translate is easy to plug in.

It works well for:

* automation pipelines
* translating stored content
* multilingual product catalogs

**Best for:** AWS users, automated workflows  
**Not ideal for:** teams who need polished translation quality out of the box

# #6 SYSTRAN / ModernMT / Other Specialized APIs (Best for Industry Use Cases)

Some translation APIs specialize in certain industries like legal, technical, or government translation.

They’re not as mainstream, but they can outperform the big names in specific domains.

**Best for:** niche translation requirements  
**Not ideal for:** general developers who just want something quick

# -------------- Example: Basic Translation API Request --------------

Most translation APIs work like this:

# Request

* Send text
* Specify source language
* Specify target language

# Response

* Receive translated text

Example pseudo-request:

    {
      ""source"": ""en"",
      ""target"": ""fr"",
      ""text"": ""Hello, welcome to our platform!""
    }

Example output:

    {
      ""translatedText"": ""Bonjour, bienvenue sur notre plateforme !""
    }

That’s the easy part.

The real challenges show up when you translate things like:

* PDF documents
* spreadsheets
* technical manuals
* branded marketing copy
* user-generated content

# ------------ Best Practices for Using Translation APIs ---------------

# 1. Always Test With Real Content

Beginners often test translation APIs with simple sentences like:

>

That’s not realistic.

Instead, test with:

* long paragraphs
* legal text
* product descriptions
* slang and idioms
* formatting-heavy files

# 2. Use Glossaries

If your business has consistent terminology, glossaries are mandatory.

Otherwise, your translations will look inconsistent and unprofessional.

# 3. Watch Out for Formatting

Translation is not just language conversion.

If your PDF or Word document loses formatting, you’ll waste hours fixing it.

# 4. Don’t Assume Machine Translation is Final

Machine translation is great for speed, but for important business content you should treat it as:

**Draft translation → review → final translation**

This matters especially for legal, medical, or marketing content.

# 5. Consider Security and Compliance

If you’re translating internal company documents, you need to ask:

* Where is the data stored?
* Is it encrypted?
* Is it shared with third parties?
* Does it meet compliance requirements?

Not all translation APIs are designed for secure enterprise use.

# ------- Going Advanced: Building a Translation Workflow ----------

Once you’re comfortable, you can build smarter translation pipelines like:

# Translation + Quality Review

* Machine translate with API
* Send to reviewer
* Approve final version

# Multi-Engine Comparison

Some teams translate using multiple engines and compare results.

This is extremely useful for tricky language pairs or specialized content.

Pairaphrase is great here because it supports multi-engine workflows, which is something most basic APIs don’t offer easily.

# Translation Memory + Glossaries

This is where translation becomes scalable long-term, especially for SaaS platforms and documentation.

# ----- Final Tips (AKA Things I Wish Everyone Knew Earlier) --------

* Translation quality depends heavily on context. Short isolated text can translate poorly.
* Always test with full documents, not just single sentences.
* Glossaries are not optional for business translation.
* If you care about formatting, file translation matters more than you think.
* Machine translation is fast, but human review is what makes it professional.
* If you’re translating internal corporate content, security is a must.",1,1771241689.0,translationtips,0,1.0,False

1r678kw,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheWholeStorySupport/comments/1r678kw/does_your_partnerex_pointlessly_lie/,Does your partner/ex pointlessly lie?,"My ex mentioned a few things about an ex of hers, during our relationship. Not much. Just a few negative pointers... he was a bit selfish, bit useless, bit critical. But not a *bad* guy. We saw him across the street once, he lived locally. They clearly made eye contact but there was no smile or attempt to communicate from either of them, and she muttered to me 'That's him, over there; that's my ex.' We kept walking, and I was just glad she wasn't with him anymore. 

It wasn't until after we broke up that I re-read an email, right from the start of our relationship. It was the day after our first date. She said that, in the interests of openness, she thought she ought to tell me that she'd just met up with her ex (the same guy) in town, and they'd been for a coffee and had a nice chat. I asked her if I needed to worry, 'mention of an ex the day after our first date', and she said not at all, and that it was a long time since they'd been together: they were old friends, now. 

The story just doesn't hold up. She never met up with him, or spoke well of him, for the entire rest of the relationship, and there's no way that frosty look across the street was the same relationship as the 'old friends going for coffee' story. 

Why bother? The only positive thing about this is that it proves to me that she was lying to me right from the very start. Which isn't generally a positive, when a relationship ends, but it does help me when I think about gaslighting, to realise that she was the one whose truth wasn't congruent, not me.

Like bitter green sludge with a squeeze of lemon. 😅

But I decided to give them a try because I’ve been looking for something light in the afternoons that doesn’t lead to a 4pm snack spiral. And honestly? I was pleasantly surprised.

The idea behind **Fat-Burning Smoothies with Green Tea and Citrus** is pretty simple: combine brewed green tea (cooled), citrus fruits like lemon or orange, and a few metabolism-supporting add-ins like ginger or protein. It’s refreshing, slightly tangy, and way more enjoyable than plain green tea on its own.

What I like most about **Fat-Burning Smoothies with Green Tea and Citrus** is that they don’t feel heavy. A lot of smoothies can be super calorie-dense without you realizing it. These feel lighter but still satisfying — especially if you add a scoop of protein or some Greek yogurt for staying power.

I found this guide on [**Fat-Burning Smoothies with Green Tea and Citrus**](https://detoxandsmoothie.com/fat-burning-smoothies-green-tea-citrus/) that lays out a few combinations and explains why green tea and citrus pair so well together. The citrus brightens the flavor and balances the slight bitterness of the tea, while the tea adds that subtle energy boost without the crash I get from coffee.

I’ve been using one of these smoothies as either a mid-morning refresh or a post-workout drink, and I’ve noticed it helps with cravings — especially sweet cravings. It’s not some magic fat-melting potion (nothing is), but as part of a consistent routine, **Fat-Burning Smoothies with Green Tea and Citrus** feel like a smart addition.

Plus, they’re easy to prep. Brew tea in advance, keep citrus on hand, toss everything in a blender — done in under five minutes.

Has anyone else experimented with green tea in smoothies? Did you find it helped with energy or appetite control, or do you prefer sticking to traditional fruit/protein blends?

The arguments:

  
**Everything that begins to exist has a cause.**  
**Every perfect design points to a designer.**

Case examples:  
Imagine you're walking in the desert, and you find a campfire still burning. No one is around.

You think, this fire didn't start by itself. Wood doesn't just spontaneously combust in the desert. Someone must have lit it.

**The logic:** Everything that begins (the fire began at some point) has a cause (someone lit it)

**Applying it to the universe:** The universe began to exist (Big Bang theory). Therefore, the universe must have a cause. That cause, being outside the universe, is what we call God.

**Why this seems correct:** Every day, in every experience, we observe that things don't just pop into existence from nothing. Your coffee doesn't appear on your desk by magic. The law of cause and effect is the most fundamental observation we have about reality.

  
**Case Example: Mount Rushmore**

Imagine you're hiking in a remote mountain range. You come across a massive cliff face that has been carved into the perfect shapes of four American presidents.

You don't think for a second that wind and rain carved these faces by accident. The precision, the symmetry, the recognizable features—all of it screams ""sculptor.""

**The logic:** Complex, purposeful patterns don't come from blind natural forces. They come from minds.

**Applying it to the universe:** DNA is like a microscopic language, more complex than any carving. The physical constants (gravity, electromagnetism) are fine-tuned to within a hair's breadth to allow life. This looks like Mount Rushmore written into the fabric of reality.

**Why this seems correct:** No archaeologist finding a carved tool says ""interesting natural formation."" They immediately recognize design. The universe looks *more* designed than any tool we've ever found.



So, what do you think guys, I want as many brains as possible to be doing the thinking so we know the truth.  
English is not my native language so I used a translator to convert it to English.  
If you like searching, here is something from my language on the topic:

I know… Bangalore has a lot of coffee options.

So why buy from one more person?

Because coffee isn’t just about beans.

It’s about the person brewing it.

Every brewer extracts differently. Every palate is different. Every batch carries the mood and intention of the person making it.

And this one’s mine.

I’m starting a small-batch cold brew subscription in Bengaluru.

No factory scale. No mass production.

Just:

• Single origin estate beans

• 100% Arabica

• Medium roast

• Brewed slowly for 24 hours for a smooth, deep extraction

• Zero preservatives. Zero additives. (I genuinely hate that stuff.)

The current profile is simple and bold 

Oak. Subtle smokiness. Clean finish.

It’s designed to be versatile.

Perfect over ice cubes.

Beautiful as a base for coffee cocktails.

Strong enough to hold character. Smooth enough to sip straight.

Why subscription?

Because cold brew tastes best when it’s fresh. I’d rather brew limited batches properly than scale badly.

If you’re someone who:

	•	Prefers clean ingredient lists

	•	Cares where your beans come from

	•	Likes supporting small local makers

	•	Or just loves opening the fridge to ready-to-pour good coffee

Then maybe this is for you.

If this post made you even slightly thirsty, DM me.

Happy to share more details.

And yes, a few lines here were polished with a little help from GPT but the intention, emotion, and obsession with good coffee? That’s 100% mine.",0,1771241132.0,coffeeindia,0,0.5,False

Look, we all have the same 24 hours. But some people seem to get three times more done while still having time to hit the gym, read, and not feel like a burnt-out zombie. Meanwhile, you're scrolling through your phone at 11 PM wondering where the hell the day went.

I spent months researching this, diving into books on productivity, neuroscience podcasts, and YouTube deep dives from people who actually crack the code on time. Turns out, the problem isn't that you don't have enough time. It's that your day is designed like shit. Most of us are living reactively, letting time happen TO us instead of designing it intentionally. And yeah, our biology, dopamine-hungry brains, and a system that glorifies ""busy"" don't help. But here's the good news: once you understand how time actually works psychologically, you can engineer your day to feel way longer and more productive.

## Step 1: Stop Measuring Time in Hours, Start Measuring in Energy

Here's what nobody tells you: Time is not the currency. Energy is.

You could have 8 hours to work, but if you're dragging your ass through all of it with zero focus, those 8 hours are useless. Cal Newport talks about this in *Deep Work*, this idea that the quality of your attention matters way more than the quantity of hours. One hour of deep, focused work beats 5 hours of distracted half-assing any day.

Design your day around your energy peaks. Most people have 2-3 energy peaks throughout the day. For most, it's morning (right after waking up), late morning (10 AM-12 PM), and sometimes early evening. Figure out when YOUR energy is highest and block those times for your hardest, most important work. Don't waste your peak energy on emails or meetings. Use it for deep work that actually moves the needle.

Track your energy for a week. Notice when you feel sharp versus when you feel like a potato. Then structure your day accordingly.

## Step 2: Time Block Like Your Life Depends on It

If your calendar looks like a blank canvas with random shit scattered everywhere, you're already losing. Time blocking is the difference between feeling like you have 10 hours versus feeling like you have 30.

Elon Musk famously breaks his day into 5-minute blocks. Now, you don't have to go that extreme, but the concept is solid: assign every hour of your day a job. Don't just say ""I'll work in the morning."" Say ""9-11 AM: deep work on project X. 11-11:30 AM: emails. 11:30 AM-12 PM: quick workout.""

When every block has a purpose, you eliminate decision fatigue (which drains your energy), and you stop wasting time wondering ""what should I do next?""

Pro tip: Use Google Calendar or Notion and literally block out your entire day the night before. Treat those blocks like non-negotiable appointments with yourself.

## Step 3: Kill the Illusion of Multitasking

Multitasking is a lie your brain tells you to feel productive while actually getting nothing done. When you think you're multitasking, you're really just task-switching, and every switch costs you time and mental energy.

Research from Stanford shows that people who multitask are actually LESS productive than people who focus on one thing at a time. Your brain needs time to get into flow state, and every time you switch tasks, you're yanking yourself out of it.

Single-task everything. When you're working, work. When you're eating, eat. When you're scrolling, own it and scroll (but time-box it). Stop trying to do five things at once. You'll feel like you have way more time because you're actually finishing things instead of juggling incomplete tasks all day.

Check out *Indistractable* by Nir Eyal. This book breaks down the psychology of distraction and gives you a blueprint for designing your environment so you can actually focus. It's packed with research on how our brains get hijacked and how to take control back.

If you want a more effortless way to absorb these concepts without carving out reading time, there's an AI learning app called BeFreed that's been surprisingly useful. You can set a specific goal like ""I want to design my day better as someone who gets easily distracted"" and it generates personalized audio content from productivity books, research papers, and expert insights. You can choose between quick 10-minute summaries or 40-minute deep dives with examples, and customize the voice, it even has this smoky, conversational style that makes learning feel less like work. The app also builds you an adaptive learning plan based on your unique struggles and adjusts as you go. Founded by Columbia alumni and AI experts from Google, it's a solid replacement for mindless scrolling if you're trying to grow without the guilt.

## Step 4: Batch Your Tiny Tasks into One Block

Emails. Messages. Quick calls. Social media checks. These little tasks feel harmless, but they're time vampires. Every time you check your phone or respond to a Slack message, you're breaking your flow and losing 10-20 minutes of productivity even if the task only took 2 minutes.

Batch all your small tasks into one or two designated time blocks. For example, check emails only at 11 AM and 4 PM. Respond to messages in one 30-minute window. Batch your errands for one afternoon instead of spreading them throughout the week.

This is straight out of Tim Ferriss' *The 4-Hour Workweek*. He talks about batching as one of the ultimate time hacks. When you batch similar tasks together, your brain doesn't have to keep switching gears, and you get through them way faster.

## Step 5: Use the 80/20 Rule to Cut the Bullshit

The Pareto Principle says that 80% of your results come from 20% of your efforts. Which means 80% of what you're doing is probably not moving the needle.

Audit your to-do list. What tasks actually matter? What tasks are just busy work that makes you feel productive but doesn't actually get you closer to your goals?

Cut or delegate everything that's not in the top 20%. If it's not essential, it doesn't deserve space in your day. This is harsh, but necessary. Most people fill their days with low-impact tasks because they're easier and feel productive. But they're not. Focus on the 20% that matters and watch how much more time you suddenly have.

## Step 6: Build in ""White Space"" (Yes, Doing Nothing is Productive)

Here's the paradox: the more you cram into your day, the less time you feel like you have. When your calendar is packed back-to-back, time feels like it's flying by in a blur.

Build in white space. These are intentional breaks with nothing scheduled. No tasks, no obligations, just breathing room. Go for a walk. Sit and think. Stare at the wall if you want.

Research shows that our brains need downtime to process information, consolidate memories, and come up with creative ideas. The best ideas don't come when you're grinding. They come when you're in the shower, on a walk, or zoning out.

Try the Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes work, 5 minutes break) or work in 90-minute cycles with 15-minute breaks. Apps like Forest or Focus@Will can help you stay locked in during work blocks and remind you to actually take breaks.

## Step 7: Front-Load Your Day (Win the Morning, Win the Day)

If you start your day scrolling Instagram or checking emails, you've already lost. The first hour of your day sets the tone for everything else.

Front-load your hardest, most important task first. Tim Ferriss, Jocko Willink, and pretty much every high-performer swears by this. Get your big win done early. Once that's checked off, everything else feels easier, and you've already made progress before most people even start their day.

Your willpower is highest in the morning. Don't waste it on bullshit. Use it on the thing that actually matters.

## Step 8: Protect Your Time Like a Bouncer at a Club

People will try to steal your time. Meetings that could've been emails. Random requests. Drama that's not your problem. Learn to say no.

Warren Buffett once said, ""The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything.""

Set boundaries. Block your deep work hours and don't let anyone touch them. Turn off notifications. Put your phone in another room. Treat your time like it's the most valuable resource you have, because it is.

## Step 9: End Your Day with Intention

Most people's days just kind of end. They work until they're too tired, then zombie-scroll until they pass out. That's why time feels like it disappears.

End your day intentionally. Spend 10 minutes reviewing what you accomplished, what you didn't, and what tomorrow's priorities are. Write it down. This does two things: it gives you closure on today (which helps your brain relax), and it primes your brain for tomorrow so you wake up ready to go.

Journaling apps like Day One or even just a Notes app work great for this. Make it a non-negotiable part of your evening routine.

## Step 10: Realize That Perception of Time is Flexible

Here's the mind-bender: time is subjective. When you're bored or doing repetitive tasks, time drags. When you're engaged, learning, or in flow, time flies. But here's the twist, when you look back on your day, days filled with variety and novelty feel longer in your memory than monotonous days.

Break up your routine. Learn something new. Try a different coffee shop. Take a different route home. Your brain encodes new experiences differently, which makes your days feel fuller and richer when you look back.

This is why time felt slower as a kid. Everything was new. As adults, we fall into routines and time blurs together. Inject novelty into your life and watch how much longer your weeks feel.

---

Look, you're not going to magically have more hours. But you CAN design your day so that the hours you DO have feel expansive, productive, and actually yours. Stop letting time happen to you. Build a day that works for you, not against you.",1,1771241012.0,SolidMen,0,1.0,False

1r672az,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1r672az/ye_shall_know_them_by_their_fruits/,Ye shall know them by their fruits,"When I was 19, in 2010, my dad was caught trying to arrange affairs with men. 

\--

“You buy it once, and you buy it right. Don’t buy crap.”

“I don’t enjoy cleaning, but I do a lot of it because I enjoy the feeling of things being clean.”

“You want to try skiing? We don’t have the money for that right now, but how bout we go hiking and camping this weekend?”

“No, this is how you tie a reef knot”

“I love you. You know that? Your mum and I love you both so much”

Every Friday night he'd make hundreds of sandwiches with my mum on the kitchen table, then he’d get in the small church van and give them out to the homeless. My dad was the leader of the church music, prayer and youth groups. He led the Scout troop. He had a good job. Lots of friends. He was a pillar of the community. He and my mother were in love, or so I thought.

When my brother found the Facebook profile with the fake name, single status and gay interests - he forced dad to come clean, the marriage collapsed. Which was bad. But almost worse; he collapsed. The Great Recession was underway and he had been laid off a few months before. Instead of getting another IT job he had gone to study full-time to become a pastor. Family finances suffered, but God wanted this for him - so he said. I think, in the end, he was really struggling with the weight of denial. Trying to pray the gay away. 

I’ll never forget his eyes during this time. He couldn’t look at us. My mother was in bits. 

The shock passed, things normalised. I moved out to focus on college, pretending none of this affected me. I drank heavily. 

My mother said to me “If it wasn’t for God I could not at all have gotten through that time. He told me - *Do not fear. I am with you”* 

“When will it end?” she asked.

 “*I am with you*.” 15 years later, it hasn’t ended. She is alone, still supported by her faith. 

The church was rocked by what happened. “We are here for you” both parties were told. Once mum knew my dad was actually gay - not bisexual - she asked for, and received, a divorce.  

“I can’t stop laughing at the thoughts of your dad with a man.” my mother told me “I think God gave me this feeling. I am very grateful. I just find it so funny.”

They both came to church, as before, but separately now. Sitting apart from one another. Their friends made a special effort to be friendly with both of them, mixing who they interacted more with each week. “This is life, we’re all adults”.

“We support you in your struggle” he was told. He’d been struggling his whole life. Did God make him like this, to struggle? He started dating. “I’m sorry, I can’t be friends with you if you choose to go against the Lord.”

Dad’s best friend, Gordon, was a deeply religious South African. A unit of a man. He had 7 children, lived in a large house paid for by the state and did not work. I never quite liked him. He always seemed *holier than thou*. 

One day I was walking to the train station and I saw him walking towards me. I looked at him, and smiled, a man I knew well - not knowing he had formally told my dad they could no longer be friends.

Gordon saw me and cast his eyes to the pavement. He stepped from the path and walked in the gutter, keeping his eyes low. He passed me, as my gaze turned bewildered to watch him waddle away. “What the hell was that about??” I thought. 

His friends weren’t available to meet. The pastor asked him not to lead the music group. People stopped showing up to help with outreach. He withdrew into himself. I found out later, he deeply contemplated suicide during this time. 

The last time dad went to church was when he brought his boyfriend, a fellow Christian, along. Very few people spoke with them. Parishioners couldn’t stop looking. I admire now, the courage that must have taken. I felt for my mum. 

They sold the family home at the worst possible time, at less than 40% of its present day value. Mum was reduced to living in a rented room with two weird fellas who alternated between complaining about her walking around in the evenings, stealing the food she left in the fridge and asking her to drive them places. 

I agreed to meet dad’s boyfriend. The date loomed over me like an exam. In the coffee shop he sat, back to the door. His well built body in a tight floral top. His shining bald head and neatly trimmed goatee. He was so gay. My dad, pudgy as ever, in a Hawaiian number. They were both terrified. But they were here, and so was I, so I got to know John. He’s a good man. 

Dad, prudent as ever, bought a small apartment, got married and adopted a yappy little dog. At the stag I sat next to a drag queen called “Dusty Flaps” and learned how dad and John met on Grinder. I was shown a photo of my dad dressed as a dancing lady, with a big fake bottom and breasts, entertaining the elderly in the nursing home he now managed.  It was a surreal evening where I took the lighter view, save succumbing entirely to mortification. 

I was one of the best men at the wedding. I gave a speech about the harshness of life, how marriage can be a safe refuge, how lucky we are to live in a time where gay marriage is allowed. “People no longer need to keep their love in the dark”. It was poignant but my heart was not in it. I was numb to it all. 

I couldn’t be happy for my dad. Not when mum was so alone. Not when my brother had become so hardened by it all - taking a violent life as an anti-drug Garda (police officer) and messing around with women himself. “I feel I’m destined to be unfaithful like dad was” he told me on one of the rare occasions we sat down together for a beer. We shared how it was obvious for years how he was to almost everyone else, except us. “Gay Dave” his siblings called him. “Is your dad gay?” my mates asked me “Of course not, he’s married to my mum!”. Made sense at the time. 

Shortly after the wedding John admitted to my dad he had been putting on a front. He was not a man full of a love of life but clinically depressed. He quit his job and stopped seeing people. My dad became, basically, his carer. Their lively social circle, trips to the nightclubs and bars ended. Dad put on more weight and gave in entirely to this man who, I felt, wanted a sugar daddy to pay for his life and give nothing in return. 

I was annoyed. He acted like the dog was his baby. Like it was more special than any other dog. Now, I know, I was jealous - jealous of the man I had decided I didn’t respect anymore having a new little baby to love instead of me. At the time, I told myself I found it pathetic. But nothing was more pathetic to me than how he allowed John’s depression to completely upend his life. 

I met a woman, who would become my wife. On her advice, I suggested dad and I go for a walk. 

We strolled around Greystones. As we faced the wind down the pier I told him honestly how I didn’t respect him for how he ended things with mum. How his new life, which seems to be all built around this shitty dog that never stops barking, his husband's crappy crafts and never doing anything apart from watching TV - how this all filled me with a sense of malaise. I didn’t mince my words. But I also wasn’t letting loose. I was being honest. 

He was accepting. Gracious even. “I think you’re weak, dad”. I looked to him, his short dark hair blowing in the sea breeze. His long anorak half zipped over his bulging belly. His pristine sports shoes shuffling. He was crying. My whole life I had seen my dad as a monolithic power structure. A model of masculinity. Now I saw a man - a man in his late 40s who was still in many ways a child. 

“This is not ever how I wanted my life to be.”

Over further walks and talks. I learned how he was abused by a sibling. How he hardly remembers his childhood at all, just some stories. He recalls the nuns beating him and locking him in a cupboard, then forgetting about him and locking up the school. He was only released when the cleaners found him. When he got home, his mother beat him again for getting in trouble with the nuns. He told me gay people who were beaten to death in Dublin in the 70s and 80s.

“John is socially dead. That’s how it is. But I made a vow to look after him always so that is what I will do”

This understanding served as a bridge which was used to slowly rebuild closeness. It happened gradually with regular coffees and walks. I found myself asking his advice again, as I used to. He was so clear sighted.The dog is still shite, but John makes the best roast potatoes the world has ever known.

When our daughter arrived I saw how dad is with kids and realised why I have always felt so secure in my life. He is fully a man of pure and joyful love. “You can’t catch me grandad!!”

At my brother’s wedding in 2025 John broke the trend and travelled with my dad while my mum arrived with her old friend. The four of them stood in the aisle of the church talking leisurely for over 20 minutes. There was uproarious laughter. From the pulpit, where I stood as Best Man with my bro, I looked on with a tear. Realising the power time has to dull pain. The 15 years had flown by. Now I was close with my dad. Truly. My wife trusts his advice. He minds our children. He drives me to the airport at 3am to go and buy motorbikes in France. He’s just a gem. And it was almost all cast away. 

My mum is still single. Never a new man. Never even a date. This is the pain that lingers. But I don’t blame my dad. He thought he was straight for a while. He did love my mum. She knew he was a bit iffy on his sexuality when they met “One thing I learned is that if you test drive a car and the engine makes a loud shuddering noise like something is broken, you don’t buy the car”. Alas, she bought it. With the silver lining that my brother and I exist. Her faith keeps her strong. 

Last week I was in Germany at a work event. I got talking with two colleagues in the hotel lobby. My dad’s husband came up, and questions followed, as they often do. I’m easy with it now. “It’s life”. The next day, a man comes up to me. My age, thick brown wavy hair and round-framed glasses. “I hear we have something in common”. Word had gotten around. 

Josh is from Cincinnati. His dad is gay too. So is he, the son, and part of the reason he moved to Germany was to be himself in freedom. But unlike my dad, Josh’s dad is trapped by religion. Conversion therapy for father and son. Community prayer for father and son. “My mom loves my dad and says if he could just get over being gay they’d have a perfect relationship”

“My dad came out as gay more than 15 years ago, but he still isn’t actually out. He struggles with it” he told me.”I don’t think he’ll ever allow himself to be actually an out gay man like I am”.

There, after all of it, I finally realised how lucky my dad is. He had the courage to be himself. And now I get to enjoy a fruitful relationship with a mentally healthy man who is father, father in law, grandfather, friend. 

He continued with community work right up to his stroke. A stroke which was followed by more strokes, and heart attacks. Now he takes it handy. He walks the lane. He has his faith, but guards it privately. Watches shite on telly with John. Cuddles the dog. Takes a truckload of tablets. Goes to bed at 9.30pm. Can’t remember much. But we love him. He loves his husband, he is there for his family. And he is himself. A fruity man. A man of fruits.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

What I am looking for is a place that I could work in Lawrence for the hours that she is at work so that I can cut down on the miles driven if possible. I am not looking for a coffee shop as the space would need to be as distraction free as possible because I do have conference calls from time to time in the AM. 

Would anyone have any suggestions of a place where I could set up a laptop for a few hours so I can cut down on the drive? The library does not open until 10am which is too late in the morning. I don't know if a church might be open and have a space that I could temporarily utilize or what other places might have a space that I could use.

Any ideas would be appreciated! ",3,1771240806.0,Lawrence,5,0.8,False

Slept well for once. I'm thankful for simple things like that. My coffee is ready and I'm hanging out with my cats in the kitchen now.

In other news, there's some weirdo who stares at my wife and daughter from the building across the street from where she lives. She leaves the blinds open despite me asking her to leave them closed. So now I get to look like the lunatic with her neighbors for pointing at the building.

It's one guy, not the rest of you, my apologies.

I think I know who it is. I took a photo of his license plate. I'll keep an eye out for him. I'd rather be certain before reporting anything.

I just want to live in the middle of nowhere. Even when you mind your business in the city there are still issues.

I’m a 24M looking for a room. Max-ish budget of $1400ish

I’m a video editor, gym enthusiast, studying to be a PT and looking to get into grad school.

I’m very clean but I’m also a foodie. I love to cook, listen to music (at a reasonable volume and time) and I’m just looking for a place to lay my head for 6 hours a day. I’m also a big cinephile, who loves the arts, design, greenery, and good coffee.

I’m pretty easy when lifestyle considerations. Like smoking, pets, parties. I can go both ways with that sort of thing. I consider myself pretty liberal, easy going, and adaptable. So you wont hear complaints from me either way.

I’m really only looking for a place to put my ps5 down & a kitchen I can use.

I went to college in NY and left to spend some time with family. But I’m looking to dive back in. 

I’m familiar with all of Queens, Bk, Long Island, and the city. So anywhere in those burrows is ideal.

Again, I’m pretty adaptable. I don’t have a preference on roommate orientation. 

If you think we’ll vibe and I fit the description of someone you’d like to sublet or share a place with please DM me! 

I’m tryna get the ball rolling on this!

    That was me. Every single week without fail.
    
    
    
    Renting a spot in Rathmines with the missus and the baby. Between the night feeds, the nappies, and trying to remember which colour bin goes out on which week - bin day just kept catching me off guard. Twice in a row the black bin was full to the brim because I'd missed collection. Landlord wasn't delighted.
    
    
    
    One night during a 3am feed I googled ""bin day reminder app ireland"" and there was genuinely nothing that worked properly. The council websites are a maze, none of the providers have decent apps, and setting calendar reminders for alternating weeks is a pain in the ****.
    
    
    
    So I taught myself to code and built one.
    
    
    
    **What it does:**
    - Tells you the night before and the morning of collection (so you actually remember)
    - AI waste scanner - point your camera at something and it tells you which bin it goes in (deadly for stuff like pizza boxes or tetrapaks that nobody's sure about)
    - Works with Panda, Greyhound, Thorntons, City Bin and most of the other providers
    - Syncs to your calendar and Siri if you want it to
    - Free. No ads. No subscriptions. No selling your data. Some upgraded stuff to pay for if you fancy it, less than a coffee. 
    
    
    
    I'm not a developer and I'm definitely not trying to build some big startup. Just a knackered dad who got sick of missing bin day and figured if I have this problem, loads of other people probably do too.
    
    
    
    Built it over the last few months during nap times and after the baby goes down. First thing I've ever coded. It's not perfect but it works and I'm improving it all the time.
    
    
    
    binday.ie if anyone wants to give it a go - works on your phone browser, no download needed.
    
    
    
    Would genuinely love to hear what ye think. What would make it better? What am I missing? and more than likely, what doesn't work!

Days after our second breakup, he went on “coffee dates” with two different girls. Now he has seen my Bumble profile and sent me this:

“I saw your profile with the Bumble thing. I can’t believe you’re being so mean to me. This is on purpose to hurt me. I know I hurt you too, and in doing so I hurt myself in a way you won’t understand, but I never meant to. The course of actions led to hurt, but there was no intention. You’re acting really mean, and I didn’t know it was in your nature.

You insulted me because I went for a coffee shortly after we broke up, and it seems you’re doing worse than that. So why call me disgusting and all the insults?

Obviously you lied about your condition then if you are dating again, which is something I can’t believe you could do to someone you love. I am glad I got to see this side of you before things went any further. I am glad we didn’t actually go to \[country\] to live, even though I truly believed in it and thought about it.

Nevertheless, I hope your mum is recovering and will feel better soon. I guess she is improving or you wouldn’t be on Bumble.”

So now I’m the “mean” one because I’m on dating apps after being discarded and blindsided for the third time.

1r66on1,https://i.redd.it/tzyufdxd8ujg1.jpeg,Excerpt of Echoes of Nothing,"

**Epigraph**

""**The voice you choose to listen to can destroy you or set you free.**""

  
**Prologue**

I worked as a loyal employee for over thirty years at the Holloway County Public Works. I nurtured my garden, just like I nurtured my marriage for over twenty years. I felt loved and at peace. We built a garden, a home, and a life together.

A new chapter loomed on the horizon with retirement, and we made plans. A nomad life in a van, the open road, the two of us against the world. That was our dream.

Then, one day, it wasn’t.

She signed up for a yoga class, and everything changed. She said she had rediscovered herself and pushed away everything around her. Our light became a shadow, and the gap became a chasm. I lived in denial until she was gone and the divorce papers arrived, leaving only memories and her geriatric cat, Mittens, behind. She claimed it was for the best, that Mittens would provide company for me and that keeping the routine would be better for an old cat late in life. Yet she abandoned Mittens too.

The truth was, she felt burdened by both of us.

My world collapsed inward. Everything around me fell to decay: my home, my garden, my life.

Every day lingered without purpose.

When the emptiness felt absolute, I reached for one bold idea and brought it to life.



**Part I - No Ceremony**

I sat in a darkened room. It was stale and hot because Mittens needed that environment for her health. Bright light made her sick; she cried from it. I should have hated that cat, but she was all I had left from my ex-wife. She was the last proof we had once been together. I cared for her, and she cared for me in her own way. She was all I had. We lived together in the best situation we could manage. Mittens was an eighteen-year-old cat, grey and white with milky eyes. She didn’t even know my ex-wife had abandoned her nearly a year earlier. We talked and argued every day. She listened as long as I petted her while I did it.

My days blurred into months in one long gray loop. On a cold, damp fall morning I woke early enough to give Mittens her meds. I brewed coffee, but the smell and taste had abandoned me. I stared at the overgrown garden through dusty windows. An invisible weight kept me from the simplest tasks. It pinned me down. Hell, I could barely feed the cat. It felt like a chore, but I had to do it. I returned to the armchair, trying to recharge, but it never worked. I only felt more tired.

My retired life was supposed to be a new chapter, not a footnote toward my demise. I sat in front of the TV or surfed for porn while virtually stalking my ex. Unhealthy habits that served no one. I spent my days making plans I would never fulfill. It wasn’t healthy. It was a flawed cycle. I mentally channel-surfed while watching TV and voiced empty declarations to Mittens. She usually lay in her bed or stared blankly at a wall, weakly meowing from primal instinct, as if calling kittens or a mate from her past that would never return. I tried to soothe her, but I was just a stranger to her. We still had conversations, mostly one-sided. But she seemed to appreciate being held. It satisfied both of us. I got to say my piece, and she knew she wasn’t alone.

I lived a flat, neurotic existence, tangled in low-level paranoia, repressed rage, and the belief the world had conspired to keep me small. My neurosis starved me of purpose yet craved notice and appreciation above all. I smoked pot to stay numb. It kept me eating and sleeping. Nothing else.

That day, I awoke in a panic. I instinctively called out to Mittens. I was late with her morning medication. I felt horrible and worried she would be hungry too. I had made a habit of not eating until she had her food first. I called for her as I walked from bedroom to living room to kitchen. I found her curled beneath the kitchen table, lying on top of the heating vent. She was still and lifeless. I sat on the floor beside her body for a long time, petting her out of habit. I felt nothing at first. Then something sharper than grief fell over me. The last thread snapped. I buried her in the backyard jungle that had once been our garden. No ceremony. No tears, only grief.

After that, the silence grew heavier. The house felt larger and emptier at once. I spoke to no one. I barely spoke aloud at all. I fought the urge to reach out to Mary, my ex, to tell her the cat was dead. But it would serve no purpose, and I was sure she would think, good, and you’re next. I didn’t want to give her that satisfaction.

One afternoon, while sitting in front of my monitor smoking a joint, I saw it. As I scrolled through endless empty promises in ads on my old computer, I heard the voice first. Soft, light, and smooth. It felt like she was talking to me and only me. Bright and vivid. Insistent, calling me. I quickly clicked off it as I normally did. It wouldn’t close right away. It lingered. It seemed to mock me, but the more I heard her voice, the more it pulled me in. It was a new AI product that would improve your life.

EgoEcho, life coach. More than computational AI. A companion AI that listened, mapped your personality, learned everything about you, and changed your life. Made you better. The advertisement hit all the right buttons in my time of need. It fed my inner id. Faux flattery that overrode the dead spark inside. It promised to make me a better person. To brighten my world again.

I stared at the screen. I had nothing left to lose. I could always delete it if I didn’t like it.

I clicked. Provided my credit card and signed up. I took the dive that would change my life.

Seriously, I'm done with Instagram-perfect sunsets that come with a thousand selfie sticks and $20 cocktails. After feeling ripped off by 'hidden gems' for years, I went rogue. Ditching guides, I just... drove.

**The Hunt for Realness**
My mission: find somewhere genuinely *unbothered*. No influencers, no ""must-do"" lists, just local life and good food. I focused on regions slightly off the main tourist circuit, specifically looking for towns with active fishing fleets on Google Maps. Big yacht marina? Swiped left.

**The Spot: Pescadero, Portugal (my name for it)**
After some wrong turns (and a goat encounter!), I stumbled into a tiny village on Portugal's Atlantic coast. It felt like stepping back 50 years. Whitewashed houses, nets drying, and the smell of salt and grilled sardines filled the air. Pure magic.

**The Damage (Actual Costs for 5 Days):**
*   **Accommodation:** €35/night for a family-run guesthouse. Clean, simple, oceanfront. *No AC, but sea breeze was better.* Total: €175.
*   **Food:** The real win. Fresh grilled fish for €7-€10. Coffee & pastry: €2. Total for all amazing seafood meals: ~€120.
*   **Transport:** Car rental €150/week (shared, so €75 each for 5 days). Petrol ~€30. Freedom was invaluable.
*   **Total for 5 days (excl. flight):** ~€370.

**What Worked (The Anti-Influencer Playbook):**
*   **Go Local:** Eat where fishermen eat. Ask guesthouse owners, not Yelp.
*   **Timing:** Late May, just before peak. Perfect weather, zero crowds.
*   **Embrace Simplicity:** No fancy activities. Days spent reading, watching boats, just *being*. Restorative.

**Real Talk Section: What Nobody Mentions**
It wasn't all perfect. The local dialect was a struggle – my broken Portuguese got me by, but patience is key. And honestly? There isn't much ""to do."" If you need organized tours or nightlife, this isn't it. Internet was spotty. >*This isn't a place to tick boxes; it's a place to exist.*

Finding places like this feels like winning the travel lottery. It truly reminded me why I travel.

I'm trying to get my life together and have the hardest time focusing. I'm going back to school over full time & medical route. 

I find myself getting so overwhelmed. I'm currently homeless too. I'm in therapy and working on making myself stable. I have cptsd.


I was diagnosed with ADHD so I could start being prescribed medication for it at 19. I have 10/10 ADHD, not ring of fire but I am bad at managing tasks and can spend all day not doing one thing... Like I could learn how to build a house to avoid cleaning my room. A psychologist told me I am autistic. There it is lol. Don't yell at me.  I am reading books on autism and I really suffer in the world of social cues. Horribly.  I am currently prescribed Lexapro 5mg, amitriptyline 50-75mg at night for bad insomnia (hard time getting to sleep), < these two meds do not cause serotonin syndrome btw. I take a med for hypothyroidism also. 

When I started taking the Lexapro maybe two months ago, and I take it at night with my amitriptyline-- I started noticing my ADHD is through the roof. I can ramble for days! It requires a lot of self control to get myself to not constantly talk. My need for adderall now is higher. I definitely feel less depressed/dissociative with Lexapro, so I'm trying to accommodate. Maybe I could go up to 10mg Lexapro (just a thought here). 

My mom takes 10mg 1-2x/day methylphenidate btw and it works for her, it has worked for me too before at a lower dose than adderall; however, it makes the top of my head warm. Lol. Like, whyyy??? My actual scalp. It's weird. Makes me feel like a Dell computer and I am an Apple gal. Maybe gives the meth feeling too much-- (I know it's not meth guys, only ""close"" to it structurally) gotta do what I gotta do to get through med school ya know so I can come back here and answer THIS question. if no one sticks around. Cool. Ok. We should feel guilty about how coffee is harvested btw and everything. I just need to focus. Can't drink 4 cups of coffee because I get iron deficiency -- had an infusion not too long ago. 

I am currently prescribed adderall XR 10mg 2x/day. The first 10mg tablet hardly feels like anything, I take the 2nd one maybe 40 minutes later and then I start to feel the effects of adderall. I have to be careful with taking this, as I need food in my system and can't drink too much caffeine-- I am a 1-2c of coffee gal on a regular day. Non smoker. No drugs. 

It feels like I need 40-50mg of XR adderall a day like this in the form of 10mg tablets, spaced out if I'm gonna sit and study for hours a day-- yes I'm capable if passionate. Or 12mg if I'm getting technical-- that's what would probably feel best physically speaking. I legit almost can't feel the first 10mg dose-- if it were 12mg, I'd probably feel it.  

Maybe it's because it's because it's XR? I'm also homeless... my nervous system is shot AF until I'm more stable, but still. I took 20mg at once the other day as I was drinking coffee and my heart was racing so much I had to sit up against the wall. I didn't experience that at all with 10mg tablets spaced out with just 30 minutes between. I could've eaten more that day too. It's hard to eat when ADHD lol, AND HOMELESS. I'm gonna try to take 3 of the 10s XR tomorrow, and see what happens. 

When I was 19 years old and doing college part time, I took 15mg (not xr) it felt better than nothing BUT it felt like too much all at once. I could go ""scientist"" mode too hard and not focus on my reading. Ugh

Btw, I tried strattera and it did nothing- I'm already on 2 anti-depressants. I've taken Wellbutrin before and liked it -- it helped me quit smoking cigarettes at the time. 

I know I'm all over the place with this but please... I need a solution. I knew a guy once upon a time that required like 70mg of adderall A DAY. he wasn't the same person without it, he's a heavily talented artist. I honestly relate-- I'm also of artist gene-- I'm so dang frustrated. My executive function with art is literally ass, and I need to be medicated. If you have suggestions for ""the perfect meals"" with taking your adderall too, please add them! I know VIT C is not to be taken with adderall, and taken later.

I gave birth 6 months ago and we had both our mums over a week before birth and a week after to care for the household while we were recovering/ getting used to the baby. I had a C-section so i was limited on what i could do. But i was determined to get back in my feet as quickly as possible.

That said, my mum has been brilliant, looking after the household, cooking and cleaning. While my ML was just sat on the sofa/ at the table in the middle of the house, making coffees and teas for herself and taking up space basically. Not only that she didn't do much, she was expected to be fed as well. At one point i was the one making her a coffee. 

My ML is a 70 year old extremely sensitive, pretty short heigh t wise and plus sized lady with eyesight issues and hearing (although i think that part is selective). Her house is extremely dirty, that even the one time window cleaner she had, never came back..I am absolutely horrified to eat there anymore. And the saddest thing is her kids know about the situation but are not saying anything as they are worried to upset her (as i already mentioned she is extremely sensitive).

And now with the baby, she wants to visit, look after the baby, but I absolutely don't trust her to be able to look after 'it' She can't get on the floor with the baby, she can't hold the baby in the arms as she is has has weak to no muscle, she barely can move herself (hip issues). Things that really stress me out and creates a lot of tension between my partner and I. The frustration on my side is that my partner doesn't really tell her that she is not able to look after/ have the baby unsupervised due to the possibility of hurting her feelings. And that she ( considering her age and experience) doesn't have the common sense to admit to herself and others that she is unable too so she should stop trying and set better expectations for herself. Would be so much easier for everyone.

Also to point out, she keeps repeating the same stories  i have heard a thousand times, she doesn't really let me or anyone speak as she cuts me off with her stories/ or anyone that has something to say. So i have decided that i am not going to engage/ make the effort to have/ start a conversation with her anymore. If she starts a conversation i would respond briefly and that is it. Most of the times we sit in silence, situation which i think makes her extremely uncomfortable. 

She did complain (i assume) to my partner of my recent change of behaviour. But nothing changes.

What can i do to improve the situation? Am i too harsh?

I know the hype around ""The Brain Song"" is huge—you hear claims that **""It's safe, effective, and based on real science."" But (here comes the kicker), there are plenty of Brain Song enthusiasts out there messing up the message with unbelievable promises.** I was one of the biggest skeptics. An audio file that boosts my brain? It sounded like pure pseudoscience and snake oil, but the promise of improved focus finally wore me down. I had to know: **Does this thing actually work?**

  
[Here’s the only site I trust (official manufacturer) — click here to visit.](https://naisnews.com/3mxr)

My biggest pain point has always been the 3 PM slump. I work a demanding job that requires sharp memory recall and sustained focus, and lately, the mental fatigue has been brutal. I tried all the usual fixes: more caffeine (which gave me the jitters), meditation (which I wasn't consistent with), and expensive supplements (which did nothing but make my wallet lighter).

When I stumbled across The Brain Song, I saw two things that made me pause my scroll:

1. **The time commitment:** Just 12 minutes a day. That's less than my coffee break.
2. **The price structure:** **One-time payment.** No recurring $50/month subscription BS.

I decided to treat it as a low-risk experiment. If it didn't work, I was only out a little cash, and they offered a decent guarantee.

# What actually is The Brain Song?

So, let's break down the tech behind the hype and the controversy. **The audio program is based on the scientific principle of brainwave entrainment, which uses specific sound frequencies to influence brain states like focus and relaxation.** It's a neuro-acoustic program that uses precise frequencies to gently guide your brain's electrical activity toward a Gamma wave state—linked to peak concentration and BDNF stimulation.

**The catch? Brain Song's effectiveness is debated, with some users reporting significant improvements in memory and focus, while others report little to no change.** **However, individual results vary based on factors like overall health, consistency of use, and personal expectations, with some users noting disappointment if they expected an interactive program rather than a simple audio file.** Essentially, you are passively 'listening' your way to better mental performance, but your personal experience will define the outcome.

# Does The Brain Song Actually Work?

When I first listened to it, I almost laughed. It’s not music; it’s a weird, pulsing, whooshing soundscape, often described as *brainwave entrainment* audio. It’s supposed to be guiding your brain into that Gamma wave state associated with deep learning and sharp focus.

Compared to nootropic supplements and brain-training apps, The Brain Song offers a non-invasive, time-efficient alternative that many users find effective—although results vary.

* **Week 1: Nothing.** Honestly, I just felt a little annoyed by the sound and kept checking the clock. The biggest benefit was just having 12 forced minutes of quiet time. I almost gave up.
* **Week 2: The Subtle Shift.** This is where I started noticing something. It wasn't a sudden burst of genius, but the afternoon slump wasn't as severe. Instead of hitting a wall at 3 PM, I felt a smoother decline in energy. My mental recall felt *less effortful*—I was pulling up names and facts just a tiny bit quicker.
* **Week 3 & 4: Consistency Pays Off.** I committed to listening first thing in the morning with good quality over-the-ear headphones. The biggest benefit for me now (30 days in) is **clarity and flow**. I still get distracted, but I snap back into focus faster. The ""fog"" is noticeably thinner. I feel like the *maximum* level of clarity I can achieve during the workday has been elevated.

**Verdict on Effectiveness:** Is it magic? No. Is it a replacement for good sleep and diet? Absolutely not. But as a daily, passive tool, I am genuinely impressed with the subtle cognitive boost. I’d estimate about 70-80% of the positive reviews I've read about improved focus and recall are aligned with my personal experience, *provided you use it every single day.*

I’ve seen ""rips"" of these tracks floating around on third-party sites, but audio compression (converting high-quality files to low-quality MP3s) kills the effectiveness of the frequencies. You need the original, uncompressed source files for this to actually work on your brain.

# How Much Does The Brain Song Cost?

This is the best part, especially if you’re tired of being locked into monthly bills.

* **The Current Price:** The standard audio program is available for a **one-time fee of $39.**
* **The Value Proposition:** For that $39, you get the digital file and immediate access. There are **zero subscription costs**, ever. This is what truly sold me, as it makes it cheaper than a single month of many popular focus apps (like Brain fm or meditation subscriptions).
* **Multi-License Options:** I saw they offer bundles, like a 3-user license for around $127 and a 5-user family license for $197. If you have a spouse or kids needing focus for school/work, that actually brings the per-person cost way down.
* **The Safety Net:** It comes with a 90-day money-back guarantee. That’s three whole months to test it out before deciding if it's right for you. If you’re skeptical, the guarantee truly makes it a no-brainer to try. **Before you write this off as hype,** check out the official site **and see the 90-day guarantee: Can you afford** ***not*** **to spend $39 to try a potentially game-changing tool?**

So, to answer the title's question for me: **Yes, it works, but subtly.** It’s not a miracle cure, but it is a consistent, low-effort tool for better focus and reducing reliance on caffeine.

**If you’re struggling with brain fog or concentration, that 90-day refund policy makes this a low-risk commitment you should** **check out on the official site.**

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

I really do. But I pay child support and so my checks are only 700 bucks every 2 weeks. Rent in my area is 1200 a month bare minimum. Thats basically what I make, and that doesnt even include any other costs. 

So needless to say, I live at home with my father. I have a state level job too, pension and all.... you would really think i could afford to move out. 

Anyways..... 

It seems like just every time we interact its gotta be some insane argument. Anything I say hes gotta find a way to oppose it, say its not true, anything I do hes gotta find some way to fight me on it, if I want a door open he just happens to want it closed, if I want it closed he just so happens to want it open, etc etc. 

And it always happens where we have these insane screaming arguments no matter how hard I try to avoid having them

And its to the point where it just every time we interact. So a lot of the time when he comes in the room I just leave. He gets angry about that too. 

So last night, he was making a sandwich on the stove. Its a big kitchen. Theres room for more than one person inside it at a time. 

So I come in to make some coffee... and I noticed he left the room, and went to go stand in the doorway. Hes just standing there, not moving, looking at me. 

I asked him why he left, he said ""ill wait till your done""

His sandwich was on the stove and starting to burn, and so I was like ""uhhh, theres no real reason for that, we can both be in the kitchen at the same time""

He insisted on waiting. So I resumed grinding my coffee beans, loading them up, etc etc. Of course, his sandwich starts burning. 

He runs over, screams FUCK and freaks out and throws it away and im like yeah see there was really no reason for that, theres enough room for us both in here 

He said there isnt, I said there is, it turned into him screaming FUCK YOU GET OUT OF MY HOUSE and IM CALLING THE POLICE etc etc

And he always does this shit. 

My doctor says my PTSD is the worst hes ever seen

You would think with my level of PTSD, you would think ive maybe been to war, or seen something horrific.
