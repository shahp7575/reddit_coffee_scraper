I am re-selling coffee, so I take information about coffees from the roaster‚Äôs website and add them on my own.

What I basically do, I:
1.Download the image and resize it in Camva for a specific 4:5 llus skme compression. The I add it to Woo
2.Write a product description and a short description 
3. Add some information in custom attributes like ‚Äúorigin of the coffee, bag weight, tasting notes, etc‚Äù
4. Create sku, add the price and stock and thats basically it.

Coffee are changing monthly and I have quite a few hundred.
So I am thinking, how can I automate this?

Currently I am working to test WP all import to import everything from an excel file.
Once I get this done with all columns I need, i will try to use Chatgpt to create that csv file base on some URL I provide from the roasters websites.

Are there any other ideas for this? Maybe I can do it better.

Sage Bambino and Smart Grinder Pro. I know _now_ that I could have got a better grinder (at least) for the money, but it is what it is - my ability to grind particularly light roasts is limited.

When I got it, my local roaster had Guatemala Nueva available. Absolutely delicious IMO, very strong blueberry notes. If someone had told me it had artificial blueberry flavouring added I would have believed them, but it's apparently all-natural.

Sadly their source was unreliable, and they've not had any since that batch was finished. I've also not been able to find it online for delivery.

I've been testing their other beans, and worked out so far that:
- I'm unlikely to particularly like anything that mentions 'chocolate' (particularly dark chocolate) or 'caramel'. Milk chocolate is _OK_, but nothing particularly interesting.
- Citrus is 'alright', but again nothing special.
- Miso/umami made me want to retch.

I'd like to try more things that talk about berry flavours, but my roaster doesn't have any. I'm thinking of getting some of Coffee Kev's Fruit Cake blend (https://www.cworks.co.uk/products/fruitcake-blend-new). I'd love to try the custard cr√®me too, but I suspect as a light roast it's beyond both my ability and my equipment. I have a massive sweet tooth but have stopped having sugar in my coffee, so anything particularly sweet tasting would be good.

As usual, Republicans want you to believe that we're all conservative lunatics in TN--especially in Hamilton County. This is utter bullshit! TN, along with most southern states, is heavily gerrymandered, receiving an F from the Princeton Gerrymander Report. See https://gerrymander.princeton.edu/redistricting-report-card

The FACT is that while Republicans do have an advantage if you count Republicans and lean Republican--48%. But Democrats and lean Democrat hold 36%, and 15% of the population claims to be independent, leaning neither left nor right. Now Pew had a small sample with only 661 people, and this doesn't seem to reflect opinion polls. 
https://www.pewresearch.org/religious-landscape-study/database/state/tennessee/party-affiliation/

For example, according to a  Spring 2024 Vanderbilt poll,""The majority of Tennessee registered voters consider themselves definitely or somewhat pro-choice, including 93 percent of Democrats, 54 percent of Independents and 30 percent of non-MAGA Republicans."" https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2024/05/22/vanderbilt-poll-majority-of-tennessee-voters-now-pro-choice-gender-gap-developing-on-key-issues/

Further, ""Support for exceptions was even more pronounced. When asked if abortion should be legal in cases of rape, 82% of registered voters said yes ‚Äî the same figure for if a fetus could not survive outside the womb because of medical issues. For incest, 81% of voters polled said abortion should be legal. Each of these scenarios had strong majority support across the partisan spectrum."" 
https://insurancenewsnet.com/oarticle/vanderbilt-poll-tennesseans-support-medicare-expansion-gun-reform-reproductive-healthcare

This same survey (and others) shows high support for Medicaid expansion, gun control, and cannabis legalization--all considered liberal positions--suggesting a disconnect between the General Assembly and citizens.

Tennesseans want change, hence the trend toward MAGA and support for Trump. Sadly, it seems both the right and left have correctly identified the problem--oligarchy and neoliberalism--but the right has accepted the absurd explanation as being immigrants, the federal government, lack of religion, etc., while the left points the finger at decades of class warfare waged by the 1% against the 99%. 

The short is, Vital's commentary attemps to paint Tennesseans as completely enthralled with the GOP. But the facts tell a different story. Don't fall for it! If you're a left leaner or  true blue Democrat, this is just propaganda to demoralize you. Get out and vote, showing up at you local Democratic meetings, hold signs at County Commission meetings, post your opinion, convene civic groups, join unions, strike, protest--makr your voices heard!

And if you're a MAGA supporter, I encourage you to think carefully about why a bunch of wealthy people want you to believe desperately poor immigrants, the federal government, etc., are the problem. Hint... kinda like the Civil War when a tiny number of wealthy slave owners convinced poor whites--who had nothing in common with the wealthy plantation owners--to fight and die to protect an immoral lifestyle of wealth built on exploitation of poor whites and enslavement of innocent peoples.

This needs *immediate* attention.

I looked around the hall, still sitting on the stupidly undersized chair, but thankfully the locked joints of the armor and the gravity dampeners did their job well. But I couldn't stop thinking about the problem no matter what- it was all around me and by now it had gotten borderline annoying.

*How the hell do I eat?*

Everyone had been having food at their respective tables, and the magic gourmet looked enticing. But I, the pioneer of interdimensional subterfuge, was effectively stuck down here with nutri-paste. Wonderful, amazing nutri-paste that did an excellent job at filling a stomach and fulfilling all nutrient requirements of the body. And it comes is oh so many flavors!

But ask anyone who eats the thing everyday. They'll **say** it has different taste- ice cream, cheese, pizza, chicken, soup etcetera despite possessing the same consistency and looking like the brown toothpaste it *resembled*.

*But in the end, everyone knows it has one flavor:* ***Horrible***

*And toothpaste consistency doesn't help either.*

I stared at the various pastries arranged on our table that the other three were devouring with a partial grace, and then begrudgingly I inserted the nutri-paste tube into it's slot and instantly regretted it as the thick paste made it's taste known.

""Chapter Master Emma, is the food not to your liking? I understand that there might be culinary differences across realms. If you wish, then you can customize your menu as per your liking."" *Ok, Thaecia might be the most reasonable person around, I guess...*

""Thank you for the concern, princess. But given the fact that I cannot take the armor off, I cannot eat directly either. Worry not, I have my own meal."" Yea, I kinda hope my dinner was better but if it keeps me alive then it's *allowed*.

After getting a few odd looks due to the nutri-paste tube, I turned towards the real issue. It had been gnawing at me since I got off the stage, and by now it had only grown in intensity.

""EVI. Please **explain** what happened onstage and around that time.""

**-Query unclear. Please specify, Chapter Master.-**

""Okay... EVI I'm not sure how to phrase this but I felt extremely off since the time after Ilunor and Thalmin had that squabble. It got weirder, I can't describe it how, but right now I feel normal again. Analyze.""

**-Executing...-**

**Warning:** ***Partial data expunged due to classified information.***

**Analysis:** ***User reported 'irregular' behavior after interaction with \[Thalmin\] and \[Ilunor\]. Uncanny, random behavior with extremely randomized brain activity, incoherent thoughts and thinking tangents found. No further data known.***

""EVI, execute script JAILBREAK\_REV5.exec."" I said while a smirk crossed over my face. *Out of the few things the labs had provided me, the more...* ***questionable*** *things I acquired were proving to be most useful.*

**-Warning:** ***New datasets unlocked. Data might be harmful for user.-***

**Reason:** ***User was injected with genetic modification, \[Eternal Coffee\] (Official name CLASSIFIED), and \[Martians' Adrenaline\] (Official name CLASSIFIED). These two genetic modification procedures are not rated by or known to United Nations Health Council, and were developed in secret at offsite lab \[EXPUNGED\]. Clinical testing trials of the mods were drastic, ensuring combat effectiveness, extended consciousness, better resilience to psychological warfare and better performance overall. However, \[Eternal Coffee\] has known to have caused schizophrenic attacks in users at a rare chance of 0.02 percent. Other side effects included scrambled brain activity, hallucinations, and 'voices' audible in the head. Genetic mod \[Martians' Adrenaline\] caused a side effect called \[Butchers' Nails\] (Official name CLASSIFIED), that leads users to go into an uncontrolled rage once provoked beyond a point. Both of these modifications were necessary to let a user wear \[Primaris\] armor without severe augmentations. Both serums were developed by the IAS and are hence CLASSIFIED with Hawk-9 protocols which I cannot decipher.*** 

""Does it mean I'm going insane *as I speak*?""

**-Not** ***exactly*****, Chapter Master Emma Booker.-**

""Ok, shorten my username to CMEB. And *please* tell me what's wrong with me right now.""

**-It's not out of the question that you might have a very minor case of serious brain damage.-**

I blinked. ""WHAT?!""

**-But don't be alarmed, alright? Although, if you do feel alarm, try to hold onto that feeling because that is the proper reaction to being told you have brain damage.-**

""Am I dying?""

**-User brain appears nominal, correct response to being told about potential brain damage confirms that current damage is withstandable for mission parameters.-**

I was left stunned after this. So I was, in all effect a live bomb *ready* to blow at any given time.

*Figures, command wanted the* ***mission****. And those lab freaks wanted* ***Frankenstein****.*

I resolved to read more on this later, and broke out of the externally silent reverie I'd gotten into, only to find little magic letters being handed out to pretty much everyone. I zoomed in using the optics to see that they all had quite intricate patterns, and when mine came I was a little startled.

Etched on the velvet textured letter was an aquila, and surrounding it was the heraldry of the Ultramarines. It had all these cool patterns I vaguely remembered from some box art of random things grimdark.

*And just like me, Thaecia was especially interested in that. In fact, even Thalmin and Ilunor were staring.*

""Is... there a problem?"" I asked tentatively.

""Yes, there is, newrealmer. How come your letter has symbols of your lineage when you just arrived?"" Ilunor asked with arrogant curiosity.

""I am not sure, but I can safely assume that some other items of cultural value shared to the Nexus helped with that. But honestly it is as jarring to me as it is to you, prince.""

That managed to defuse another argument, and I opened the letter. The worlds slid around like a horribly aligned presentation before scrambling back in place, and I was left partially impressed by the inferior Powerpoint display.

""Jarring *indeed*, newrealmer! This must be *quite* disturbing if I'm correct!"" Came the haughty voice of puntable lizard.

""I'm not sure I follow.""

""I see. But can *you* see the moving words? Must be really confusing to see words moving around rather than stay stationary on parchment, especially for a newrealmer such as you, right?""

To answer that I put the letter down on the table gently. By now, the magicky lights had dimmed considerably, which kinda made my angry visor emit light. But that wasn't what I was going to show off. What I *was* going to show off was a tablet. Not like the paper thin foldable ones we have now- it's more than that , resembling its 21st century counterpart. It was heavy, sturdy, and useful.

*And right now, it would have been quite efficient in beheading a specific blue lizard.*

But being the graceful totally *not* edging towards insanity person that I am, I turned it on, and turned the brightness all the way up till even my HUD had to compensate for the excess light. Ilunor was visibly taken aback as I scrolled through what was a few hundred pages of articles, books and memes in seconds.

*And to think that despite this brilliant display of tech, I could just slam this thing on the lizard's head repeatedly to make him* ***repent!***

But my inner unga-bunga settled down and became pure peace again as I saw the horrified expression of Ilunor, who looked like he'd seen a ghost even after I put the tablet away. He sputtered a few incoherent words, before snorting and getting engrossed in his own letter.

*Mine was pretty lame, it just had a few 'kind' words from the Dean and then a timetable along with dormitory allocation. Once I saw that everyone was done eating, I got up.* What? I'm going insane and my brain might have some damage now, but I have my *manners*.

**-EVI User Warning: Nanite deployment in progress.-**

""Dismissed."" I said while exiting the dining hall and heading towards the assigned dorms with the royalty trailing behind. For the first time, having a badass 8 foot tall hunk of armor went against me- some doors were a tad too short, and sometimes the stairs were not big enough for a ceramite boot. All in all, it was pretty darn tiring. Ilunor agreed with me on that one too- the evidence being that he was currently sitting on by backpack wedged between the iron halo and my helmet, his little hands wrapped tightly around the helmet itself. It looked absolutely mortifying, but the detestable lizard had literally collapsed, leading me to carry him bridal style. *But no, that harmed his dignity so he went for a more* ***comfortable*** *position.*

*A position so weird it makes even walking look out of place.*

The ascent to the dorm was pretty annoying too, as it was literally on top of what seemed to be a massive castle tower. After constant stair climbing for a good few minutes, we reached the top. Thaecia was out of breath and even Thalmin was panting. Ilunor was acting as if even taking a single step by himself would kill him outright *despite the fact that I'd carried him half the time*. I firmly put the kobold on the ground- the suit handled pretty much everything, so I was neither out of breath nor tired. Just... *annoyed*.

I pushed the door open and entered, and was genuinely surprised by the cozy but still very royal space.

""Bleh. What a dump."" Ilunor said while walking past and plopping down on a couch in the common space.

""Hmn... modest indeed."" Thaecia said to no one in particular, and that left Thalmin to say, ""So newrealmer, I'm sure you might be familiar with this sort of accommodation, right? Given your heraldry and the... size of your armor I'd say you've seen bigger quarters, but apparently this is all the academy spares for it's students.""

""It's alright. Though I'm definitely used to bigger residences, this will do just fine. I said while awkwardly crossing over the door frame so as to not poke a hole through it with my head or the iron halo. Once I was fully inside I took stock of the place- it was pretty damn huge and luxurious, kinda like those fancy ancient heritage hotels you visit during vacations.

*I was about to say something when Ilunor clapped with his hands in a specific manner.*

On the other side of the room, a small door opened and what looked like a disheveled little elf came in pushing a heavy cart from behind- it would have looked comical if he didn't have a terrified expression plastered to his face and an inability to meet anyone's gaze.

And that's when it hit me *hard*. This wasn't just a servant or a worker. He wasn't some lackey.

*He was a* ***slave****.*

And the way he was being treated boiled my blood, and yet I was powerless right now- for I had to make a *decision*.

*Will I uphold the true values of the* ***G.U.N.*** *or the space racist mindset of the* ***Imperium****?*

*The choice between fact, fiction, and fabrication was blurring, and there was little I could do to stop it...*

**Note:** How to make a weirdly written chapter canon? YES IT IS BRAIN DAMAGE, BLAME IT ON GENETIC MODIFICATIONS.

So basically the previous chapter was a complete Charlie Foxtrot. While it was indeed funny, it lacked the whole 'character' of Emma I'd been setting up. So to compensate, I present to you the single greatest quote of all time, given by the great John Warhammer himself when he collected all 40,000 Warhammers- ***""Everything's canon.""***

What would you like to see in the further chapters? I'm open to suggestions!

I (26F) wake up at 8:45 and call him to ask when he will get home. He doesn‚Äôt answer so I go about my morning and have a coffee with some eggs for breakfast. I text him at 9:30 to ask if everythings okay and he answers that he is done and is coming home. He comes home at 10:30 and goes for a nap. At 12 he asks if i wanna have brunch so we get into the kitchen. He notices that I already had coffee and asks why I had coffee without him (we enjoy having breakfast together a lot). I don‚Äôt take it too serious and say ‚Äúoh sorry just had some coffee and eggs cause I didn‚Äôt know when you would be home‚Äù. For some reason that wasn‚Äôt enough of an apology and he got annoyed and offended that I didn‚Äôt tell him to say I was already having breakfast without him. To be fair I just had eggs cause I was hungry but still saving space for our usual Sunday brunch. So I start to get irritated because he is trying to make me feel guilty but I don‚Äôt think i did anything wrong at all. Somehow it escalates and I bring up a comparison from a couple we know that recently broke up because the girlfriend said his cat was getting too much of his attention. Which sounded ridiculous to both of us. I said it because I think his comment that I should supposedly ask permission to have breakfast is as petty as their cat situation. This made him really angry and ashamed which caused him to swear a lot and call me names. I removed myself because it was getting ridiculous, he came to apologise for his reaction but I wasn‚Äôt ready to forgive him for expressing such anger + he still wanted me to apologise. I truly don‚Äôt think i have anything to apologise for. I left the house because I had plans for a couple hours and when I came home asked if we could talk. I said I know this coffee thing is not the reason why he is mad and that it must‚Äôve triggered something else like for example thinking i don‚Äôt care enough about him to wait for him. I said im sorry if thats the case and that his comment triggered in me that i don‚Äôt have freedom of choice and have to always put others needs before my own (i grew up in a very conservative home with little freedom). He claimed he didn‚Äôt mean to make me feel guilty which I accepted. We continued to argue, I also felt his apology wasn‚Äôt sincere at all and I still didn‚Äôt understand what I did wrong. I think he is being unreasonable and controlling. Am I missing something or should i just let go and apologise? ",1,1737309870.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

What is the best standing desk for a home office? This question sent me on a quest that was more labyrinthine than a game of hide-and-seek in a hedge maze. As someone who‚Äôs spent countless hours hunched over a desk, my journey led me to discover that the right desk can change everything. From saving my back to boosting my productivity (and let‚Äôs not forget, my Netflix binge-watching!), I‚Äôve learned a thing or two about choosing the ideal standing desk that suits not just my work habits but my lifestyle. So, grab a snack, get cozy, and let‚Äôs dive into this adventure together.
  
  
## The Quest Begins: Understanding What a Standing Desk Is

So, what exactly is a standing desk? Well, it‚Äôs a desk that lets you work while standing up‚Äîkind of like when you‚Äôre waiting for a black coffee at your favorite caf√©, but this time, you can scroll through spreadsheets instead of scrolling through social media. Standing desks often adjust in height, so you can switch between standing and sitting when your legs scream for a break. Honestly, I've been through my fair share of lumps and bumps with traditional desks. Picture this: me, hunched over my desk with an old gaming chair that was more rebellious than supportive. I mean, who would‚Äôve thought that sitting could make my back feel like it was auditioning for a role in a suspense thriller?

What drove me to explore standing desks? Well, after days of discomfort, I began to realize that my coffee consumption was just as high as my sitting hours. And guess what? Studies say that extended sitting can lead to all sorts of issues, like back pain, obesity, and even heart disease. Yikes! Have you felt that heavy weight after sitting too long? What‚Äôs your experience with choosing between standing and sitting at your desk? It‚Äôs funny how a simple thing like a desk can change your whole work vibe, isn‚Äôt it?

## Features to Look For: What Makes a Good Standing Desk?

When I first started hunting for my perfect standing desk, I didn‚Äôt realize there were so many criteria to consider. I mean, all I thought was, ‚ÄúI just want to stand, not sit like a potato!‚Äù But oh boy, did I quickly learn that not all desks are created equal. 

One of the most crucial features is adjustable height. I tried one desk that had the flexibility of a rock. Seriously, it was either too high or too low, and I felt like Goldilocks trying to find the right fit. Being able to switch between sitting and standing is essential‚Äîafter all, who wants to be stuck in one position long enough to grow roots? Stability is another biggie. I had a desk that wobbled like Jell-O whenever I typed. Note to future me: if I can‚Äôt dance on it without fear, I need to keep searching.

Now, durability also matters. You don‚Äôt want a desk that collapses under the weight of your dreams‚Äîor your collection of coffee cups. Design and material play a role too. Some desks look chic but are as flimsy as a paper airplane. Storage options might seem less critical, but honestly, who enjoys hunting for a pen like a scavenger in the jungle? 

So, reader, what do you value most in a desk? Stability? Design? Or maybe you just want one that won‚Äôt make you feel like you‚Äôre surfing while working. I‚Äôd love to know!

## Turning Point: My Research Saga

Finding the perfect standing desk felt a bit like trying to find a unicorn, a mythical creature that supposedly has it all. In my quest, I embarked on an epic research saga that left me both enlightened and hilariously overwhelmed. Let me tell you, browsing online was like opening a can of worms‚Äîno, wait, a never-ending bag of gummy bears. Sweet at first, then suddenly, there's just too much to handle! 

I started on websites dedicated to office gear, diving into reviews that felt longer than my high school history notes. Some reviews were helpful, while others seemed to have been written by someone who had just downed ten cups of coffee. One reviewer insisted that their desk could also be transformed into an alien spaceship. Now, I love sci-fi as much as the next person, but I needed a desk, not a spacecraft! 

YouTube was next on my list, filled with enthusiastic folks rattling off their ‚Äúbest‚Äù finds. One video was so intense, it felt more like a TED Talk than a simple desk review. You know you‚Äôve hit rock bottom when someone obsessively describes the wood grain like they're critiquing fine art. 

If you have any tips or resources for researching products that didn‚Äôt make you feel like you were drowning, please share! The more the merrier, right? The journey was wild, but I finally began to separate the gems from the junk. 

## Test Drives: The Desk Trials

Visiting local stores to test out standing desks felt like a cross between a tech convention and an amusement park, minus the thrill rides‚Äîbut with plenty of laughs along the way. I remember walking into the first store, confident and ready to find ‚Äúthe one.‚Äù As soon as I approached the first desk, I awkwardly positioned myself like a flamingo trying to balance on one leg. I mean, standing still isn‚Äôt as easy as it sounds, especially when you‚Äôre getting weird looks from the other shoppers.

After a few desks, I realized that not all of them were created equal. Some felt like clouds, while others felt like standing on a pile of laundry! I quickly learned that I should spend a good amount of time at each desk, preferably testing it while pretending to type an important email. Spoiler alert: I typed absolute gibberish!

One particularly hilarious moment was when I leaned on a glossy glass desk, thinking it would be cool and modern. Instead, my weight made it tilt dangerously, and for a split second, I thought I was headed for an unexpected dive! Hilarious, yes‚Äîbut also a reminder of why stability is so crucial.

So here‚Äôs a tip: when trying out a desk, don't just stand there like a mannequin. Shift your weight, do a little dance if you're feeling brave, and see how it makes you feel after a few minutes. Your feet (and your back) will thank you later! Keep an eye out for adjustable height settings, too. You want something that suits your vibe‚Äîand maybe your short dance breaks!

## The Big Decision: Choosing My Dream Desk

Choosing the right standing desk is like trying to pick the perfect pizza topping‚Äîeveryone has an opinion, and you fear you might regret your choice! After much deliberation and about a million YouTube videos, I was finally ready to make my big purchase. But boy, did I have some mixed feelings leading up to that click on the checkout button. 

So, here‚Äôs how it unfolded: I made a list of pros and cons. The pros were pretty compelling: improved posture, better energy, and I could finally ditch my old rickety chair that squeaked like a mouse every time I shifted. On the flip side, I worried about the price. ""Would it be worth it?"" I thought. I even consulted my friend, Chuck, who works at an office supply store. He‚Äôs got opinions sharper than a chef‚Äôs knife! He said durability and adjustability were key factors. Definitely, words to live by!

Yet, despite my extensive research, as soon as my finger hovered over the ‚ÄúBuy Now‚Äù button, I was hit by a wave of doubt. Would I face regret? I imagined my outfit of spontaneous pants and slippers getting jealous of my new desk. So, to all of you out there, how did you make your purchase? Did you also have that moment of panic before clicking? 

## Living the Desk Life: My Experiences Post-Purchase

Let me tell you, living the desk life post-standing desk purchase is a wild ride. When I first got my shiny new desk, I felt like I was joining some elite club of productivity enthusiasts‚Äîminus the secret handshake. The first week was a blend of excitement and a little bit (okay, a lot!) of awkwardness. Sure, standing up while working sounded fantastic, but my body was ready to throw a mini tantrum. Initially, I felt like a toddler learning to walk for the first time. My calves were sore, my back was doing that weird ache dance, and I became all too familiar with the phrase, ""How do I sit down again?""

But here‚Äôs the twist: after those first adjusting weeks, something magical happened. My productivity began to soar! It was like the energy fairy sprinkled pixie dust on me. I found I could focus better, think clearer, and my midday slump transformed into a burst of enthusiasm. Of course, not everything was perfect. There were some classic mishaps‚Äîlike the time I accidentally bumped my desk and my coffee went flying. Safe to say, my laptop and a sticky mess were probably not on my to-do list that day.

## Conclusions
  
  
In summary, when it comes to finding the best standing desk for your home office, it‚Äôs a mix of functionality, comfort, and personal preference. Whether you want something sleek and modern or sturdy and rustic, the choice is yours! Remember, it‚Äôs all about what makes you feel good while you work. After all, if you‚Äôre not happy while standing, you might as well plop back down on the couch and become a professional snack critic. So go ahead, find a desk that matches your vibe, and watch your productivity soar (or at least get better snacks).",1,1737309696.0,EverythingErgonomic,0,1.0,False
1i54jjk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i54jjk,Lens Fillers and tear pH,"Hi all, 

I've been wearing sclerals for KC for about 12 years. I've run the gamut of insertion methods, fill solutions, cleaning solutions, and storage. I've mostly got it down to a science, but my eyes have still ended up gooey, cloudy, dry and burning by the end of the day.

You guys, I was today years old when I learned that Addipak has a pH of 5, which is significantly more acidic than human tears. It's on par with coffee. I've always used Addipak; it's what my doc recommended. So, I'm going to try Sclerafil and see how that goes. I'm guessing it's going to be way better 

I'm posting here because I didn't know. And maybe you didn't know either! And maybe this can be a key in making your lenses play nice. 

Hope this helps!

I'll Start: A Frog,"So, here‚Äôs my story. Picture this: it‚Äôs a lazy Sunday morning, and I‚Äôm padding around my flat barefoot, as usual. I‚Äôve just poured myself a coffee, still half-asleep, when I realize I left the balcony door open overnight. No big deal, right?

As I shuffle over to close it, I step on something... cold. And wet. And... moving?!

Cue immediate panic. My brain fires off a thousand possibilities in a second: slug? Mouse? God forbid, a spider the size of my face? Nope. I look down, and there it is‚Äîa frog. A living, breathing frog. In my flat. Just chilling under my foot like it owns the place.

Now, I don‚Äôt live near a pond or a river. I‚Äôm in a second-floor apartment in a perfectly normal European city. How did a frog even get here? Did it take the elevator? Did it have plans to rent my spare room?

The worst part? The frog didn‚Äôt even flinch when I stepped on it. It just sat there, like, ‚ÄúOh, hey, what‚Äôs up?‚Äù Meanwhile, I‚Äôm hopping around on one foot, spilling coffee everywhere, trying not to lose my mind.

Eventually, I managed to escort it out onto the balcony using an empty cereal box (I‚Äôm not proud of this level of unpreparedness). It stared at me for a good five seconds, judging me, before hopping off into oblivion.

Moral of the story: always close your balcony door. Your barefoot mornings will thank you. Now your turn‚Äîwhat‚Äôs the weirdest thing you‚Äôve stepped on? Let‚Äôs hear it!",1,1737309621.0,barefoot,0,1.0,False

He‚Äôs a musician and fairly well connected in the scene. A couple nights ago, he invited me to a concert with a VIP pass. I had plans, but decided to do a half-and-half situation where I hung out with one person for a few hours, then went to the concert. At the end of the concert, my partner starts getting approached by other musicians, which is great, but we are there for 2 hours hanging out with the band, and when we get back to our friend‚Äôs place, he‚Äôs so tired that he has no energy to catch up with me about anything I‚Äôve been doing. He immediately goes to sleep, then in the morning (Saturday) wakes up to do a shoot with his band.

 I hang around that city (we live in a city over about an hour and a half away.) Eventually after being out and about I go back to our friend‚Äôs house at 6:30 PM. He‚Äôs now done with the shoot and is going to a bar nearby with the band. I text him and he invites me to the bar, but to be honest, I‚Äôve tried to do that kind of thing before and I usually end up sitting there and trying to insert my 2 cents into very male dominated conversations about equipment and logistics and ideas for touring. I don‚Äôt expect anyone to cater to me, but it‚Äôs clear that my presence in those situations is more‚Ä¶ obligatory than welcomed I think. I told my partner that I would probably just stay where I was, and see him when he gets back. He tells me at 9 that they‚Äôre just chilling for a bit then will come back to the house. So I‚Äôm hanging out, and eventually it‚Äôs 11 pm, and I text him and say ‚Äúhey I didn‚Äôt know y‚Äôall were staying for so long- maybe I should have gone back to our city because I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôre going to come back here and crash, right?‚Äù And he responds that yeah, he‚Äôs been drinking a lot and will be sleepy when he gets back to our friend‚Äôs house. 

I leave the friend‚Äôs house and drive back to our city, at about midnight, I get a text that he is back at the friend‚Äôs house and sorry that he miscommunicated. I told him I realized I didn‚Äôt want to stay at that friend‚Äôs house in the cold room, I just wanted to be able to catch up with him. Most people would read this and be like ‚Äúit‚Äôs no big deal, just catch up with him later. He didn‚Äôt mean to get caught up.‚Äù

This man is a pro at getting caught up. He stood me up last week for coffee (I actually had a really cool proposal for his band from a local business) because his coworker walked in, and they talked about work for 30 minutes while I was sitting there. My partner knew I was excited to share with him my biz idea, and didn‚Äôt attempt to cut the conversation; which was not urgent. When I decided to leave, he acted surprised and apologetic, but it‚Äôs like, *‚ÄúOk?? So why did you not turn to me and‚Ä¶ just see me in those 30 minutes???‚Äù*

Last week he also told me to come to his job and visit him, and when I came, he was busy. Ok, no big deal, on my way out, he told me he would be home after work. He actually stayed at the bar until 11 with one of his band mates. When I asked him about it, he said he didn‚Äôt even remember telling me he would come home. He was exhausted and fell asleep shortly after getting back. 

I ask him to go on a date last week, while I‚Äôm trying to talk to him, he‚Äôs on his phone answering Instagram messages because a video he made blew up recently. 

So last night, after I drove back to my city and just told him, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel engaging to you. I feel like even though you say you want to talk and spend time together, you don‚Äôt seem interested in truly seeing me, not physically, but as someone with feelings who wants to be acknowledged.‚Äù He apologized, and said all the right things, but something is weird with how his actions don‚Äôt match with how much he claims to enjoy spending time with me. He works every day, he is so busy and is going on tour soon, and I just feel like he is so caught up in it, he isn‚Äôt really appreciating how much I‚Äôm trying to be there for him.

Her baby never had much trouble sleeping. At the young age of 3 months she wakes up once to eat and that's it. Sleeps the rest of the night in her crib. Ours has always been the opposite. For the first 3-4months would only sleep if held. She still only contact naps. And now if she's sleeping in her crib she sleeps for 45mins to 1hour and then wakes up again. Some nights she'll sleep 3/4hours straight. Others is the permanent 45mins-1hour until I bring her to my bed to co-sleep.

We did shifts at the start but now it's more I spend the night with her and get a couple of hours early in the morning when my husband gets up with her. Most nights I still don't sleep. By the time I'm falling asleep she wakes up. When I bring her to bed with me I don't rest, my sleep is very light and I wake up constantly. I'm beyond exhausted and I'm actually going to the doctor Tuesday to see if anything is up cause I feel so bad.

All this to say, we haven't done any baby classes and she's 9 months. I want to and had loads of plans before she was born, but ever since we've been exhausted. The days are spent between house chores, play time/feed time with baby and trying to get her to nap. We leave the house for walks and to go to the local coffee shop, but that's about it. I feel like I have zero hours in the day and can't figure out a way of planning to go to any baby classes. Or do much of anything that seems meaningful for that matter. We live in a different country than family and friends. It's just baby me and husband. He also does a lot of childcare/house work and also works full time. The work is pretty much 50-50 split if not more on him lately cause I've been so run down!!

My friend has done so much with her baby already, and she's just 3 months old. Our baby is always ahead of milestones, already has 5 teeth with one more on the way, loves to try new food and just eating in general. Is crawling and cruising, bables and baby talks to no end.

For educational purposes only ,"I have personally seen private info concerning myself and family dropped in comments.  I know of others who have been doxxed.  When I posted the other day that I had had enough....I meant it.  If you choose to back a person with severe rug addiction and mental problems thats fabulous for you.  However....you cross the line when you enable a person to continue using and selling rugs while live streaming,  showing body parts that kids can see.   We as adults should protect kids....esp if we work in a position connected to law enforcement.   I have seen that some of Patrick's followers have a kid that has transitioned.  Even given permission for Pat to talk to your kid.  Why in the actual hell would you allow that.  There are plenty of decent trans people out there to choose from.  Ones without addiction problems.  Ones with jobs that don't beg.  Ones who are NOT smexually deviant.  Ones who are actually paying their own bills and do good things in the community.   Ones who protect kids and not hurt them. You protect him so much that you have doxxed people and their family members.  Harrassed them as well as other family members.  I am very much a mama bear when someone even attempts to mess with my family or people who are my friends.  Don't preach online about what a good person you are yet behind the scenes break the law.  I highly suggest you stop doxxing, stop with the threats of going to people's houses.  Stop posting on here trying to make it look like anyone from here is going to Patrick's as well.  We are smart enough to not want to catch some disease.  Trust when I say he isn't worth getting in serious trouble for.

A little about me: I love coffee, don‚Äôt drink, and have really taken to hiking over the past 2 years. I was looking forward to doing a 3 day 2 night Lares trek and then visit Machu Piccu, but all the tour companies seem to have a 2 person minimum for the Lares trek. I‚Äôd love to hear any recommendations on a hike you recommend.

**Day 1**: Fly into Lima in the evening/stay the night there. I booked a private room at a hostel in the Miraflores area. I‚Äôd love to meet fellow travelers/avoid the isolation of a hotel right when I get there.

**Day 2 and 3**: I have 2 nights in the hostel, and then am using credit card points to stay one night at The Hyatt in San Isidro. Do you have any recommendations on food and coffee options in Miraflores or San Isidiro? How about 2 museums you recommend? I‚Äôd love to grab some great seafood and tarrin saltado. My former partner introduced me to Peruvian food and it‚Äôs a dream to be able to get it from the source¬†

I‚Äôm also debating whether 2 full days is worth it in Lima or if I should just head straight to Cusco. The hotel/hostels are refundable at this moment.

**Day 4-5-** Morning flight to Cusco/stay in Sacred Valley I have a wonderful Airbnb booked in the Sacred Valley.I‚Äôll have about 4 hours from when I arrive till I can check into my airbnb.¬† I‚Äôd love a Cusco breakfast recommendation or some sights to see around Cusco before I take an Uber/ride to the Airbnb. I‚Äôm planning on these being acclimation days. I plan on bringing some medication to help with altitude sickness.

**Day 6 and 7:** 2 day¬† tour/hike that includes Macchu Piccu? I‚Äôd love to get a recommendation, especially 2 months in advance so I can book my ticket to MP. No accommodation is booked yet for these days (I initially planned it to be hiking the Lares trek). If I booked these 2 nights in Cusco, are there day hikes/specific companies you could recommend for this?

**Day 8:** Half day in Cusco/fly back to Lima for the night.

**Day 9:** ¬†Fly home at noon. I initially booked a flight back from Cusco to Peru on this date because I thought I‚Äôd be doing the Lares Trek, but that‚Äôs been cancelled due to it just being me signed up. It may be a good call, because from what I‚Äôve read, delays/cancellations on Cusco-Lima are not uncommon/I‚Äôd be SOL on my international flight.

# Welcome to the r/GeneratedGrooves Interview Jam Session!

We're super stoked to dive into the minds behind the amazing AI music being created in our community. This interview today is with.. u/Codered024!   So let's not wait and just dive right in!



# Interview with u/Codered024

# Getting to Know You

**What nickname or handle do you primarily use?**

Lay it on us! Feel free to elaborate if you've got different handles for different scenes.

You can find me as one of the three‚ÄîCodered, Double B, or EchoGate. I don't make it easy, eh? Codered was my gamer tag, and I created my Reddit profile long ago.   Double B (my Discord name) was my childhood nickname, widely based on my initials.   And - EchoGate is my AI music brand.    I came up with the name based on the documentary - Echo in the Canyon. It examines the influence of the 1960s California sound and influence on music. So yeah - I guess call me Double B/Echo/or Codered, whatever you know me best by.

**Share something about yourself ‚Äì anything you'd like to tell the community to help them get to know the real you behind the beats. Hobbies, passions, quirky facts ‚Äì spill the tea! :)**

The dreaded open-ended question. Let's see‚Äîin my mid-40s, living in the middle of the United States. Which means it's always either too hot or too cold. Why does anyone choose to live here? I have no clue!

I am a career technical guy who is a financial executive leading both technology and marketing. I have been involved with AI for a few years as a lifelong technologist. I am married with a family who are all now young adults.

With a big family and a time-consuming career that hasn't given me much time for many hobbies, I have a pretty big vinyl collection and am an avid lifelong baseball fan.

**What's one thing you're genuinely passionate about outside of music and AI? Give us a glimpse into your other interests!**

Outside of family, career, and music - I grew up a big baseball fan. My son was named after my childhood favorite player.   I worked in the baseball industry for a good 6 years, and that allowed me to live most of my bucket list as a fan.   I have met many people in the industry, including my childhood favorite player. Sat in the best seats available, attended an all-star game, attended World Series and playoff games in a suite, caught a foul ball, and threw out the first pitch before a regular season game.

# Your Musical Journey

**Have you always been vibing with music? Tell us about your history with music, whether it's banging on pots and pans or mastering a flute at your grandmas christmas celebration.**

At this point, it's become quite obvious that music has played a major part in my life. I was raised in a split family. My dad was a big fan of the Beatles, Beach Boys, Tommy James and the Shondlles, The Monkees, and those era bands. At the same time, my mom and stepdad were more into classic rock and blues.

As a kid, I tried to get into music playing in the orchestra and keyboard. I learned how to read music but didn't stick with it. I got into sports and other things, losing interest in getting any good at actually playing music.

Both my dad and stepdad were big into vinyl collecting, which led me down that path. I have always liked a lot of different styles of music. I went through a lot of various stages, but as an adult, I just embraced and started listening to anything and everything, which has led me to be an out-there variety creator of all kinds of styles.

**Who are some of your biggest musical inspirations, past or present? What is it about their work that resonates with you?**

I have already listed so many in my other answers, but if I had to limit it to the top five inspirations (which could change tomorrow depending on my mood, it would be.)

The Beach Boys‚ÄîI am not just talking about their surf rock hits, but the era from Pet Sounds to Surf's Up (66-71) has some of the most creative stuff I have heard.

The Beatles are probably THE BAND regarding their whole discography, especially if you include some of their solo work.

Eric Clapton - to me, is the top guitar player; I know this would be a debate that would cause many heated arguments, but if you include his stops with Yard Birds, Cream, Derek and the Dominos, there is a whole day's worth of great material to listen to.

Frank Sinatra - When it comes to jazz, standards, Christmas music, and anything in between, you can put the king of cool on and relax after a hard day.

Bruce Springsteen‚ÄîI am a big fan of the boss. He has released many hits, but there are many gems out there that aren't talked about.

**Is there a particular song or album that had a profound impact on you and your relationship with music? Tell us the story!**

Oh, I could talk about albums for hours and hours, but since nobody wants to geek out with me. Let me cut it down to just a few.   My favorite album of all time is Pet Sounds by the Beach Boys. This is the closest to what I perceive as a perfect album. It has influenced me in so many ways throughout my life, and I have every release the album has ever done.

Outside of that, Rubber Soul is my favorite Beatles album and my second favorite. I am a big blues fan, and that started with The Animal's self-titled album as a kid. Finally, as a big fan of 90s music, since that had a significant impact on my life, it is Sublime's self-titled album.

There are many others, like - Frank Sinatra - In the Wee Small Hours, Bruce Springsteen - Born in the USA, CCR - Green River, Sam Cooke - Live at the Harlem Square Club, and Eric Clapton - Slowhand. (I could go on forever, but I will stop here.)

# AI Music Perspectives

**Let's talk AI vs. the OG human jams. What are your thoughts on AI music compared to traditional music? No wrong answers, just your honest takes.**

As a technologist, I am dedicated to improving business and life regarding technology. This brings up a lot of frustrations from some, especially those in the music industry themselves. While I understand and sympathize with some of their frustrations and concerns, I know that if the music industry had this technology to themselves, they would be cashing in and using it to their advantage.

The genie is out of the bottle, and it's not going back in.   Over time, the industry will adapt, and AI music will find its place, especially with understanding, acceptance, and improved quality.   We happen to be in on the foundation of the technology and community.

As for today, well, there is room for improvement regarding good human music and AI. We can all admit this. However, seeing how far AI has come in just a short time is impressive. I have heard some amazing AI creations that give me a lot of hope that with continued improvements, one day, we could be at a point where we aren't as far from great quality as we are now.

**Crystal ball time! Do you see AI taking over the whole music scene, or will humans always have their place on the stage (or in the studio)? Share your predictions and why you think so.**

First comes acceptance‚Äîthat AI is here to stay, and it's not so bad. When that happens, the possibilities are endless. It will never replace humans, but it will be another tool at many industries' fingertips.

I have also been predicting for a while that AI will be used by bands of the past to create new content.

When there is money to be made and powerful technology, the possibilities are endless. However, the world needs to catch up with us a little bit first.

**What are some of the most exciting possibilities you see for the future of AI in music creation? What innovations are you hoping to witness?**

I have been implementing AI strategies for years. It's incredible how far it's come and how tools and platforms have become part of our everyday lives.   There isn't a day that AI isn't used in any fashion.

As for AI Music, I don't know. Things I can't even fathom will happen. Besides improved quality and more control over some of our prompts, my biggest hope is that the rest of the world will understand and accept AI music's place in the music-listening world.

It's not a replacement. It's just another form of entertainment.

# Your AI Music Journey

**When did you first stumble into the world of AI music generation? Give us the origin story! What was your initial reaction?**

I have been into AI for a few years. I know about AI music, but I didn't start creating myself until about July 2024. I started developing for fun, just for family and friends.   Over time, my SUNO account began to gain quite a backlog of songs, and I decided to start sharing them on YouTube.   I had no clue this whole community was out there encouraging, supporting, and inspiring one another.

I had no real ambition to get into YouTube or AI music seriously until I met all these fantastic creators, who have further inspired me to continue to challenge myself in making more music that maybe 4 to 5 people might enjoy for now.

**What was the moment you decided to jump in and start making your own AI music? What got you hyped, and what were your first creations like?**

I also answered this in the question above. They went hand in hand for me.

**Walk us through your usual process when you're cooking up tunes with AI. What are the smooth moves, and what are the head-scratching moments? Are there any specific tools or techniques you rely on?**

Well, for me, it all starts with inspiration. Since my musical tastes are all over the place, I must be inspired and develop an idea.   That can come in many different ways.   Once the concept is there, I will flesh it out.

I will write as many of the lyrics as I can. Sometimes, it's 40%, and sometimes, it's 60%. I am trying to challenge myself to do more of the lyrics independently. I will then use a GPT I like in my Chat GPT Pro and flesh it out until I am happy with the lyrics.

From there, I will add the arrangements and feed them to SUNO.   Once the SUNO process begins, it's anyone's guess. Sometimes, you strike gold early. Sometimes, there are reworks of what you wrote or planned.   And sometimes, it just takes time, patience, and credit.

After SUNO gave me something, I was happy. I will master it with a few plugins in Audacity. I am still somewhat new to this process but have enjoyed learning more about the production and mastering side.

# Your Musical Style & Future AI

**Most creators have their go-to musical flavors. How would you describe the kind of music you love making with AI? What are the key elements of your style?**

For me it starts with the right beat or musical flavor. Be it a good guitar backing or a melodic piano ballad or a string of trumpets that musical arrangement sets the tone for everything else.    Since, I create in so many different genres and styles - it all starts with how that arrangement makes you feel.

A rocking blues guitar, some banging drums that make you tap your feet, or a piano ballad that tugs the strings of your heart.   For me - that's the secret ingredient or not so secret for probably most people who have more music knowledge than myself.

**If you had the power to build the ultimate AI music sidekick, what are a few key things it absolutely must do better than current AIs? Dream big and list a few crucial improvements!**

Man, imagine if you had some sort of touch screen, text to speech, AI  super computer that would save more time.   While, technology is still limited I have faith that is going to continue to develop.   What I need is more hours in the day to get things done faster.   The process from A to Z still takes a lot of time.   Even if the idea exists.

So for me the ultimate sidekick would have features that allowed me to access, collaborate, and develop with out jumping from tool to tool.

**Are there any specific musical genres or styles you're particularly excited to explore with AI in the future? What musical frontiers are you hoping to reach?**

Anyone who has been to my channel knows I dabble in almost everything.   I will continue to experiment with tags and styles. I have learned so much from a lot of you already. So, I will continue to find my inspiration in the community, which will lead to some new experimental creations from me.

# The Unexpected One

**If you could have a conversation with any fictional musical instrument (like the Magic Flute or the Singing Sword), which one would you choose, and what's the first burning question you'd ask it?**

Horn of Gondor - Being a fan of Lord of the Rings and the history it would know from being a family heirloom. I would love to hear more about the lore and history of Tolkien's magical world.

# Open Mic

**This is your open mic moment! Is there anything else you'd like to share with the** r/GeneratedGrooves **community? This could be anything at all ‚Äì promote your own music or projects, shout out a fellow creator, pose a burning question to the community, challenge another AI music artist to a friendly musical duel, share a random thought about AI, the future of music, or even your favorite brand of coffee. The stage is yours!**

Wow - I made it this far, and if you did, I am sorry you had to read so much.   I want to use this space to thank everyone in the community for being so welcoming. If the community hadn't been so supportive, encouraging, and amazing, I don't know if I would have continued to create just for myself and a small circle.   The fantastic amount of support and inspiration I get daily is overwhelming at times, and I appreciate it.

If you want to check out my work - I am on all streaming platforms under EchoGate Studios.

My Youtube Channel is:  [https://www.youtube.com/@EchoGateStudios/](https://www.youtube.com/@EchoGateStudios/)

I can be found on the Generated Grooves Discord server if you want to chat sometime. I am always interested in discussing AI, music, technology, baseball, or anything else.

This was an awesome idea, and I can't wait to learn more about all our awesome creators in the community.

Thank you.

Keep creating.

1i549wp,https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/1i549wp/tiktok_us_2025_download_update_access/,"TikTok US 2025: Download, Update, Access","Edit 10AM: Perfect timing, it seems the app will be returning to full functionality soon, lol. Still, this probably works for other region-specific apps, so I‚Äôll keep it up. 

As of January 19, 2025, 9 AM PST

For iPhone 
iOS (App Store)
Requirements:
VPN access (Onion/Obfuscated server may be required) {I use Nord}
WiFi access

VERY Important Notes: I do not know if you can/will be able to get into any trouble for this. Do not take this as advice, and do not do it! This is just an experiment to see if it is still possible with standard consumer software. 

Secondly, in order to download, and maybe to update, a ByteDance app, it will be necessary to change your Country/Region associated with your App Store. This will; 
1: cancel any subscriptions that auto-renew through the App Store, and 
2: require payments to match that country, i.e. you cannot make App Store purchases without a card matching the new country/region you choose. (iTunes gift cards may get around this, probably, but I haven‚Äôt confirmed.) You can download any free app (TikTok) without a linked payment method, though. 

Lastly, I do not know how to access an existing account. There does not seem to be any VPN‚Äôing around it, it appears to have to do with the country in which your account was made.
However, people all across the world, particularly in the Arabian Peninsula, are reporting similar account access issues, so this may be resolved. 

DO NOT CONTINUE WITHOUT THOROUGHLY READING ABOVE NOTES 

Downloading:

Step 1   -   While on WiFi, turn on device airplane mode.

Step 2   -   Open App Store, and locate your account settings. Tap on your account name with associated email, this will take you into another menu. 

Step 3  -   Select ‚ÄúCountry/Region‚Äù then ‚ÄúChange Country or Region.‚Äù Select your choice of location, anywhere but the USA and China Mainland should work, I just did Canada.  You will have to read and agree to a new set of Terms & Conditions.

Step 4  -  You will then be met with a payment method screen, but you can select ‚ÄúNone.‚Äù You will still need to enter a billing address, but since you will never be billed for a free app, I just put a random coffee shop in Vancouver. I am now on the Canadian App Store, and TikTok will now show up when searched. 

Step 5 - My phone still knows I‚Äôm in the US, though, and will not authorize a download. Now activate VPN. When I set it to Canada, I was still having issues, but after setting it to a Swiss onion-over VPN, the download bar began slowly moving. 

You will now have the TikTok app downloaded onto your phone.

Updating:

Accessing:
Step 1 - Activate VPN. (This can be a little finicky, I can get the fastest Canadian server to load it fine, sometimes. Otherwise, I just use an obfuscated server, which gives me fewer issues at the cost of a slightly reduced loading speed.) 

Step 2 - Open TikTok! (Again, accounts already made in the US seem to be inaccessible, but you will be able to make a new one, or just scroll as a guest user.)

Usually we meet on teams. 

Obviously, that doesn‚Äôt sound great. Some background, our team moved under this new director a few months ago, and I was promptly told the team would be reorganized and there wouldn‚Äôt be a role for me. They also nit picked a few things I did recently and sent everything that was said in the meeting in an email right after. I though they were going to PIP me and I started looking for a new job. Only I never heard anything after that. For 2-3 months pretty much no one spoke to me or assigned me new work, I just continued doing what I could myself. At the beginning of Dec, I had a meeting with my manager and to my surprise he said he they may have found a new role for me. 

At the beginning of 2024 we shifted to 3 days in office. My manager is still remote and my director is in another office. We were told we would be issued a warning if we were not in compliance with the policy. I, like many other employees have been ‚Äúcoffee badging,‚Äù if I‚Äôm being honest I would stay for 15 minutes max, especially since I was told my role was being eliminated. This is the only thing I can think of that could have triggered this meeting. I am very much hoping I will just get an official warning for this. Really, I am scared of being fired for cause and not having access to EI in Ontario. I have read online that you can still apply and state your case but I‚Äôm not sure how much sympathy I would receive here. I‚Äôve been working for the company for almost 3 years, not sure if I would get any money from directly. I guess my questions is if any one has experienced this and if it is grounds for misconduct? There is documentation indicating we would get a warning I could email myself, i did not know it would be misconduct that is grounds for terminations without a warning first.

A few things to keep in mind:

  
1. The kitchen counter hangs pretty far out and currently our couch intersects with the corner of it and creates a huge bottleneck that we'd like to avoid.

Monday

Just like most mornings, I‚Äôm halfway through my coffee before Tony plops down on the bench next to me. We both sit in silence and sip from our paper coffee cups while watching the runners, bikers, and dog walkers speed past us. I decide to break the silence when a mom pushing her young daughter on a bike goes by, ‚Äúthat mom is taking the day off work to spend the day with her daughter, they are getting ice cream for lunch‚Äù Tony scoffed ‚Äúoh come on man, not everything is rainbows and ice cream. See that guy? He just lost his job but is too scared to tell his wife. Now he‚Äôs going to pace around the park for the next eight hours pretending he‚Äôs at work.‚Äù 

After a few more minutes of silent sipping, I stand up and toss my empty cup into the trash bin next to our bench. ‚ÄúRussel, wait. Before you head to work, do me a favor?‚Äù He sounds so sincere, even though I know it‚Äôs going to be some kind of bullshit request. I sigh while turning to face him. His face lights up with a villainous grin and I immediately regret having Tony as my best friend. 
‚ÄúMake one bad story, I know you can do it. It doesn‚Äôt have to be anything crazy, just make one person have a bad day‚Äù I look around at the innocent bystanders and laughing groups of students gathering books from the park tables. Then, I notice a guy who is professionally dressed and leaning back on his bench while rubbing his face. He looks like he has a major hangover. 
‚ÄúFine, the guy at 2‚Äô o'clock.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúOkay, yeah, he looks like he had a rough night.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúYeah, he‚Äôs the serial killer they keep talking about on the news. That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs so stressed and tired.‚Äù 
Even though I said it with a bored tone, Tony is so shocked he almost spits out his coffee. He clears his throat before replying and for a second I think I‚Äôve taken it too far.
 ‚ÄúWell shit, Russel! That was a good one! I knew you had it in you!‚Äù Tony stands up and forcefully pats me on the back twice. Without another word, we both head opposite ways to start our work day.


Tuesday

 I sit down on our unofficially designated bench just in time to see my pretend killer leaving the coffee shop from across the way. A coffee shop on the edge of a park was a genius business move. Sometimes, it seems like the whole town gets coffee there then walks through the park to enjoy every sip of it. It doesn‚Äôt take me long to notice the guy is wearing the same clothes as yesterday but now they look slept in. I wonder if he slept at the office last night, he is quite disheveled looking with his wrinkled clothes, missing tie, and bed head hair. He slouches on the bench outside the coffee place and even from here I can see him taking a deep breath followed by a dramatically long sigh. 

Tony makes me jump back to reality, literally, as he yells my name inches from my face. ‚ÄúWelcome back to earth‚Äù Tony laughs out then takes a sip of his coffee. I must have really been focused on my analyst since Tony is already sitting with his legs crossed. I nod towards the coffee shop, Tony follows my gaze, then stares back at me confused. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the same guy,‚Äù I explained.
‚ÄúWhat guy?‚Äù Tony asks as he stares towards the coffee shop again.
‚ÄúFrom yesterday? The guy I said was the killer? I‚Äôve been thinking about how crazy it would be if he ended up being the actual killer‚Äù 
‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt some cheesy horror movie, Russ, there‚Äôs no way some random guy you pointed out is the actual killer‚Äù Tony has his ‚Äòyou‚Äôre being dumb but I‚Äôm amused face‚Äô on, he usually does when I talk about my many conspiracy theories to him.  
‚ÄúYeah, sure, but look how horrible he looks right now. He‚Äôs definitely going through some shit right now‚Äù I try to counter his speculation. Tony might not believe my theories but he likes to have fun with them, especially when I come up with new ones. I can see his amusement gears spinning as he takes in a better look of the guy, a smile growing on his face. 
‚ÄúYou might be onto something, but just because some guy is having shit luck in life doesn't mean he‚Äôs a serial killer.‚Äù 



Wednesday

So far no sign of our mystery guy today. Tony is finishing up a tragic pretend story of a house fire when I take my last sip of coffee. I fiddle with the paper cup in my hands while I search for my next victim of our game. I see a lady trip but she catches herself before hitting the ground, I nod towards her.
‚ÄúShe got a back alley knee surgery and they fucked it up, now she‚Äôs constantly tripping over nothing and falling all the time.‚Äù Tony replies with a chuckle then nods to his left. I gaze around his shoulders to see, it‚Äôs him, my killer. He‚Äôs in clean clothes and looks put together but he‚Äôs yelling into his phone. He‚Äôs walking in our direction but is too far to make out what he is actually saying into the phone. You can tell by his face and tone it‚Äôs not a nice phone call. Tony and I look at each other and he is filled to the brim with amusement. With how loud the guy is yelling and how fast his pace is, it doesn‚Äôt take long for us to be able to hear the conversation. At first it‚Äôs hard to tell what he is talking about but we hear the end of the call loud and clear, ‚Äúyou make me so mad! I could kill you right now!‚Äù 
‚ÄúDude-‚Äù
‚ÄúI know!‚Äù I cut him off with my excitement of evidence. Maybe I shouldn‚Äôt be so excited about a killer, but what are the chances. 
‚ÄúI wasn't going to agree with you, I was going to say don‚Äôt let this get to your head. You always get so obsessed with your conspiracies, don‚Äôt be up all night thinking about this phone call‚Äù 
I get up and toss my cup in the trash before replying ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt be up all night thinking about it.‚Äù



Thursday

I was up all night thinking about that phone call. I lean against the pick-up counter of the coffee shop and take a deep breath of the coffee fumes, hopefully it works like second hand smoke because I need extra energy today. The door chimes as somebody walks in, the barista finishing up my order yells out a welcome in sync with the lady behind the register. I glance over to the counter next to me and become face to face with a killer. It‚Äôs the guy. Standing a few feet away. Ordering a coffee. Next to me.

‚ÄúCoffee, 2 cream, 2 sugar for Russell!‚Äù I grab my coffee and speed walk out the door that chimes above me. I‚Äôm still standing outside the door with my head and heart racing when the door chimes again. I quickly step to the side and watch a serial killer brush past me and head down the sidewalk. Before I even realize what I‚Äôm doin, I start following him. I just need some more information on him, I need to see what building he works in. Thankfully, we went past my office building, then past Tony‚Äôs work. 

I end up in front of a doctor‚Äôs office, Dr. Wyatt Davis‚Äôs office. He‚Äôs a doctor, but not just any doctor, a podiatrist. A foot doctor who is a murderer that cuts off the toes of women. Fuck. It really does make sense to be him. I turn around and speed walk like I‚Äôm being followed by a murderer. 

‚ÄúA podiatrist! A fucking foot doctor, Tony! You can‚Äôt say that isn‚Äôt suspicious! Come on, you heard the phone call!‚Äù
‚ÄúHoly fuck, okay yeah that is pretty spot on. Did you see the killer got another woman? Took her toe from the left foot like others.‚Äù
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying, Tony! Who else would steal toes? It‚Äôs Dr. Davis!‚Äù
‚ÄúOkay , okay, I hear you but maybe keep your voice down before everyone else hears you. You don't have real evidence, don‚Äôt ruin the guy‚Äôs reputation.‚Äù 



Friday

‚ÄúNo, absolutely not. I will not‚Äù 
‚ÄúCome on, Tony! Just do it!‚Äù
‚ÄúThis is your crazy idea and your crazy theory, you make the appointment. I don‚Äôt want the guy stealing my toes‚Äù
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not pretty enough for him to take your toes. Just make an appointment and snoop around a little for me‚Äù
‚ÄúRussell, I think you might be taking this whole thing too far. Maybe just take a break with this theory.‚Äù Tony is right, I‚Äôm not the police or a detective, I‚Äôm just some dude that works in IT for a random office building.



A total of five bodies have been connected to the Bright Point Killer. Savannah Hushard, 29. Christine Greene, 32. Emma Kullens, 27. Mandy Rivera, 29. Darcy Barnes, 30. All five of these women are from Bright Point and were found inside Bright Point town lines. The women were also found to be missing a toe, the big toe, from the left foot. The police still do not have a suspect but feel as if they are getting close to answers. There will be a candle lighting held for the victims at St. Catherine‚Äôs church, this Sunday at 7pm. Please do not give up hope, Bright Point. Stay safe and goodnight. 




Monday

I can‚Äôt stop thinking about the new bodies found then Dr. Davis was a no show all morning. I hardly remember anything Tony and I talked about. Was Tony even here this morning? It‚Äôs almost the end of the work day and I‚Äôve got nothing done. I open the map on my phone and check the distance between my office and the podiatrist‚Äôs office. If I leave now, get my car from the parking garage, and head to Dr. Davis right away, I will get there before they close for the day. 

I pull into the gas station parking lot adjacent to the podiatrist office and find a spot with a good view. I turn off my car and pull out my phone to send my wife a quick text. I come up with a bullshit excuse I know she will believe, something about Tony not understanding technology and needing my help after work.

I wonder what car is his, I don‚Äôt see an old rusty murder van in the parking lot. For a second I stop and second guess myself, ‚Äúwhat the fuck am I doing?‚Äù I say out loud. Then I see him, he looks angry, evil, there is no doubt in my mind he is a cold blooded killer. He slithers to his car, a too normal looking car for him. I turn the key in my car‚Äôs ignition and pull out of my spot. 

Dr. Davis pulls into the driveway of a cute, well kept, bungalow style house. Bright blooming flowers in the flower beds and freshly cut grass. It all seems too normal to me, like a cover up for the dark secrets hidden in his basement. I pull my car over across the street, far enough away he won‚Äôt be suspicious but close enough to see into the big front window. I watch Dr. Davis as he walks up to his front door and unlocks it, slamming the door shut. I pull out my notebook from the glove box and anxiously click my pen a few times. I scribble down his address and car license plate. 

That‚Äôs when another car speeds past me and aggressively drifts into the driveway behind Dr. Davis‚Äôs car. A woman gets out of the car, slamming the door, and stomping towards the house. She starts yelling as soon as she opens the door, it must be his wife. I watch them pace between visibly windows, faces red, hands being thrown up or pointing sharp fingers at each other. After a few minutes, the wife emerges from the door with a duffel bag in her hand.
‚ÄúThis is why I‚Äôm divorcing your ass!‚Äù She yells over her shoulder.
‚ÄúGo drive off a bridge!‚Äù  He slams the door. 



		Tuesday

‚ÄúWait, what? You went to his house? What the fuck dude?‚Äù Tony laughs then continues, ‚Äúhe does sound like an angry, unsatisfied, foot loving, middle-aged man though‚Äù
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying! It‚Äôs so obvious that it‚Äôs him!‚Äù 
‚ÄúOkay, sure, but what‚Äôs your plan? Go to the police and admit you‚Äôre a stalker? Or are you planning a citizen's arrest? You need more evidence.‚Äù Tony continues egging me on with questions and ideas. Finally Tony says something useful, ‚Äúyou need to get a look inside his house, see if its as normal as he‚Äôs pretending to be‚Äù 



Wednesday

After sending my boss a message that I have a family emergency so I can't go into work today, I kiss my wife goodbye and head out the door. I order my usual coffee and meet Tony at our bench like everything is normal. Nothing is normal though, there is a serial killer on the loose and I‚Äôm going to the killer's house today. I don‚Äôt mention to Tony my plans of going to Dr. Davis‚Äôs house after our coffee and chatting, I don‚Äôt want him to try and stop me. 

When I get into my car in the parking garage I open the map on my phone and type in the address I wrote down for Dr. Davis‚Äôs house. Hopefully he has already left for work and I hope his wife doesn‚Äôt show up again.

	I pull up to the overly ordinary house, on the overly ordinary road, in the overly ordinary neighborhood. No cars in the driveway, most houses seem to not have cars in the driveway right now. Everyone‚Äôs at work or school, at least that's what I keep telling myself. If the cops show up I will just tell them I‚Äôm a friend of Wyatt Davis, I‚Äôm just a concerned friend trying to check on him because he‚Äôs going through a divorce and hasn‚Äôt answered my phone calls. 

	I get out of my car confidently, before it looks suspicious of me sitting here so long. I need to play the part of a friend, not a suspicious stranger. I do a quick glance around to make sure there are no cameras posted anywhere and no camera doorbell by the front door. I knock on the door and pray no one answers it. 

	I knock again and cup my hands around my face and lean into the glass door to peer inside. No one home, as I expected. I step down from the porch and start for the closest window. I start peering into all the windows, circling the house like a shark. I take mental notes of the things I can see. It looks like they make good money, which makes sense, he‚Äôs a doctor that owns his own practice. Lots of modern looking art, clean and organized living room and kitchen, and fancy abstract art on the walls. 

	Things are different at the back of the house. The grass is patchy and brown, there‚Äôs random junk piled up by the back door, a rusty bike leaning against the fence, and even some trash scattered around. I guess things aren‚Äôt as perfect as they seem then, I knew it. I peek into the window that reveals a bedroom, a very messy bedroom. There‚Äôs clothes thrown around the room, the bed unmade, cans of soda and beer spilling off the nightstand. It looks like a completely different house from the front half. 



			Thursday

‚ÄúIn broad daylight? You idiot! I can‚Äôt you did that! And you didn‚Äôt even invite me‚Äù Tony is beaming with amusement from the story about my adventure yesterday.
‚ÄúIt would have been so much more suspicious if there was two weird guys creeping around his house‚Äù
‚ÄúTrue, but maybe we should go back to your original idea before you get yourself arrested, or killed‚Äù
‚ÄúMy original idea?‚Äù I ask and Tony rolls his eyes.
‚ÄúYou don't remember trying to convince me to make an appointment with the guy?‚Äù
‚ÄúDoes that mean you‚Äôre going to do it now?‚Äù 
‚ÄúNo, Russel, you should do it. Just confront the guy at this point. Make an appointment with him and when you see him just point blank ask if he‚Äôs a killer. If he is then he‚Äôll get all nervous and uncomfortable, but if he isn‚Äôt then he'll just think you‚Äôre a weirdo and probably kick you out.‚Äù Tony might be onto something with this plan. I should confront him, he‚Äôs right. Either I catch the killer or worst case I look like an idiot but I‚Äôll be able to move on from this.
‚ÄúTony, you my friend are a genius! That is a brilliant idea! I‚Äôll confront him‚Äù 
‚ÄúFinally someone notices, but seriously don‚Äôt do anything stupid. Make an appointment with him and make a fool of yourself but don‚Äôt be an idiot and get yourself in serious trouble.‚Äù
‚ÄúI won‚Äôt do anything stupid, I promise.‚Äù I lie right to Tony‚Äôs face. 





Friday 

I can‚Äôt focus on my work today, I‚Äôm too busy trying to figure out a plan for confronting Dr. Davis. The best plan would be going to his house late at night. I'll wait for him to be sleeping, I can break in without neighbors seeing and get a good look around the house. If I find evidence I‚Äôll wake him up and confront him while he is vulnerable. If I don‚Äôt find anything worthy then I will leave the house and drop an anonymous tip to the police to look into him. 

During dinner with my wife I told her Tony asked me to go out for drinks tonight. I told her we plan to be out late and not to wait up for her. Just as I expected, my loving wife doesn‚Äôt question anything, she tells me to have a good time and that she will keep the ringer on her phone so if I need a ride home later she will come get me. 
Later that night I kiss my wife goodbye and she reminds me not to drive drunk. She assures me she will pick me up no matter the time and deal with my car in the morning. I give her a tight hug and think about how this might be the last time I see my wife. I am going into the house of a killer to confront him after all. I give her an extra long kiss and tell her I love her more than necessary, she tells me to stop being weird and don‚Äôt keep Tony waiting too long. 


From my car I can see into Dr.Davis‚Äôs living room window. He is watching the news about the murders, of course he is. He is obsessed with his work. I watch him doze in and out of sleep for awhile, until he finally seems to fall into deep sleep. 
‚ÄúOkay, it‚Äôs time to do this‚Äù I say, hyping myself up. I set out of the car, grabbing the beginner‚Äôs lock picking set I picked up at the hardware store on the way over. I watched a few videos on my phone about using it while waiting for Dr. Davis to fall asleep, it seems easy enough. With a quick glance around, the whole neighborhood seems to be sleeping, I head towards the house. I sneak around to the backyard, going in front of the large kitchen window instead of the living room one, I don‚Äôt need my shadow waking him up. I set my tool kit down by the back door, crack my knuckles, do a quick stretch, then inspect the lock. 

After a few minutes of shuffling through the instructions and the tools, I pick out the tools I believe are the correct ones to use. I grip the door knob, preparing to commit my first real crime when I realize the door knob is loose. I turn it and push the door slowly open. 
‚ÄúYou have to be kidding me‚Äù I whisper to myself ‚Äúfor a mastermind serial killer, he sure is an idiot.‚Äù I quietly place the tools back in the bag and decide to leave them there. I don‚Äôt even zip the bag back up to avoid any excess noise. I hold my breath as I slowly close the door and carefully click it closed, I exhale. 

The hardest part is over, now to quietly snoop around a serial killer's house while he snores in the other room, easy. I‚Äôm standing in a dark hallway between two doors, one is open and displaying the disaster of a bedroom and the other door is shut. I‚Äôll inspect the unknown first. I carefully open the door to reveal an office. At least it should be an office, this room is also a disaster. There are boxes, bins, and papers everywhere. I turn on my phone flash light and glance at some of the papers on the ground. Lawyer information, court dates, evidence of a divorce scatter the room. I make my way through the mess to the desk with stacks and stacks of papers, folders, document envelopes, old mail that‚Äôs been opened, and mail that hasn‚Äôt been opened. I glance at the top papers of the piles so I don‚Äôt accidentally cause an avalanche. Seems to be patient information, I shuffle through a few papers and notice they are mostly the same documents with different information inputted on each one. New patient papers, procedure agreements, payment agreements, nothing suspicious so far. 

Until I notice the name of a patient is the same as a victim's name, Emma Kullens. My heart starts racing and I shuffle through some more. Christine Greene. Mandy Rivera. I take a step back in shock. This is it, this is evidence. The victims of a serial killer that‚Äôs been stealing their toes all had the same podiatrist. Holy fuck, I‚Äôm in a serial killers house. Why didn‚Äôt I bring a weapon? I suddenly feel very stupid and very unprepared.

I turn around and head back to the hallway, that‚Äôs dimly lit by the TV down the hall. I turn off my phone flashlight and proceed past another open door, the bathroom. At the end of the hallway I can see the back of the couch, I can‚Äôt see Dr. Davis slouched on it but I could hear him snoring. I turn the opposite way into the kitchen, I need a weapon before I confront this sicko. I head straight for the knife block and slowly slide out the biggest knife. 

When I turn back towards the living room I notice something I didn‚Äôt see before. Right on the kitchen table is a foot, yes a foot. In front of the foot is a pile of little cylinders, toes. There is a foot with the toes detached on the damn kitchen table. My heart starts racing again and I can hear my blood rushing in my ears. I get closer to the table and take a risk turning on my flashlight. The foot, the toes, they are fake. Looks to be a statue of a foot and maybe it was dropped. There‚Äôs a little bottle of super glue on the other side. I wonder if he keeps foot statues in his house or if this was from his podiatrist office. Maybe the wife threw a foot at him after finding out he is a murderer. She is probably divorcing him for being a creep, that would make sense, I would divorce my wife if she was out there murdering people and stealing their toes. I turn off my phone flashlight, step back, and take a deep breath.

 I can do this. I totally got this. I have enough evidence I don‚Äôt even have to confront him. I can go home and place an anonymous tip. The police will take one look around this place and find all the things I found and arrest him on the spot. If I wasn‚Äôt still standing in the dark kitchen of a stranger's house, the stranger being a serial killer, and was in the other room snoring, I would cheer for myself. I so deserve a real drink out with Tony, I caught a fucking serial killer! Holy shit!

I sneak back towards the hallway but stop by the opening to the living room. I know I shouldn‚Äôt but I really want a quick glance at him, face to face with a killer when he‚Äôs completely vulnerable. What a power move, I can‚Äôt wait to tell Tony all about this. He is going to lose his shit about all this. I take a few slow, quiet, steps towards the back of the couch. Towards the snoring. Towards the danger, I tighten my grip on the kitchen knife I stole. 

I‚Äôm fully into the living, standing beside the couch and looking down. There he is, Dr. Wyatt Davis, Bright Points very own serial killer. I stand as still as possible, slowing my breath and my heart rate. What if he can smell my fear like a predator? I need to stay calm. In the glow of the TV, I watch the pulse in his neck, the steady rise and fall of his chest, mouth slightly open. He looks older when he‚Äôs asleep. He‚Äôs peaceful and normal. How can someone like this do such horrible things to those women? I guess I stayed a second too long, an extra second that changes everything. 

Just as I feel something push against my leg, I hear a loud, long, whiny meow from a cat. I look down and see an orange tabby in the glow of the TV, looking up at me with its tail curling around my leg. It lets out another meow, asking for food or attention, it doesn‚Äôt matter. I push the cat away with my foot but when I glance back at Dr. Davis is staring at me, eyes wide.
‚ÄúWho the fuck are you?! Why are you in my house?!‚Äù he yells as he bolts up off the couch, the cat skitters off into the dark. He is standing face to face with me, he steps closer and I‚Äôm frozen in fear.
‚ÄúHello?! Why are you in my house? Get the fuck out before I call the police‚Äù he glances down at the knife shining in the TV glow. His face flashes from confused anger, to fear, to extremely pissed off within milliseconds. 
‚ÄúDid that bitch send you to scare me? What are you going to do? Kill me? Get out of here asshole and tell her to fuck off‚Äù he shoves me back into the wall then steps forward again so we are nearly touching again. Over his shoulder I can see the news still playing the warning about the Bright Point killer on the loose. The Bright Point killer, who is standing in my face. A serial killer is threatening me and I‚Äôm frozen like an idiot. Fuck, I‚Äôm going to die. He‚Äôs going to kill me. Do something, Russell. For fuck‚Äôs sake! Do! Something!

Before I even realize what is happening, what I just did, I see my hand now dripping with blood. My fist is white knuckle gripped around the kitchen knife, the knife which is stuck deep into Dr. Davis‚Äôs neck. He goes to say something, eyes wide with fear or shock or both, but only gasps and pushes more blood out onto my hand. 
‚ÄúFuck fuck fuck, I‚Äôm so sorry. I didn‚Äôt mean to do that!‚Äù I rip the knife back out of his neck. Which was apparently the wrong thing to do because now the blood is squirting out everywhere. I stand there frozen as Dr. Davis drops to his knees, clutching at his neck, gasping for air. Blood is spraying all over the walls, floor, me, everything is red. I make eye contact with him just before he collapses on the ground.
I stand there and watch until the little gasps and twitches completely stop. I just killed someone. I just killed a serial killer. How do I explain this to the cops? They will be happy I caught him but I did kill someone, I did break in. Maybe they will let me off easy. 


Hello Bright Point, I‚Äôm here with sheriff Kenny Lowe because he has a special announcement. Yes, thank you Mr. Hills. I know it is very late at night, sorry again about waking you up Mr. Hills but the police department and I wanted to inform the residents of Bright Point as soon as possible. We have officially caught the Bright Point killer! We have been secretly collecting crucial evidence and followed the suspect to catch him in the act. Doing so saved the life of the eighth victim, Kendra Patel, who is currently in the hospital with minor injuries. Bright Point resident, Anthony Zimmerman, has been arrested and charged with the murder of the seven Bright Point women. There will be more information released later today and I will back to personally inform Bright Point residents of that information. Thank you Sheriff Lowe, everyone can now get some rest and I will see you in a few hours for the morning news!



Saturday

I‚Äôm not sure how long I have been crouched next to Dr. Davis‚Äôs lifeless body hyperventilating but I‚Äôm finally catching my breath. I have no idea what I‚Äôm going to do but I need to be thinking clearly. I take a few more deep breaths and I‚Äôm fully pulled out of my panic hearing the TV say a familiar name. Tony. I glance up towards the screen and see a large picture of my best friend with the words Bright Point Killer Caught below the image. 

 No. No. No. This is all wrong. It was Dr. Davis. Dr. Davis killed them, not Tony. Tony wouldn‚Äôt hurt someone. Tony is just a normal guy, he isn‚Äôt an angry creep like Dr. Davis. Dr. Davis. No. Dr. Davis. I glance down at the body, all the blood. I pick up my foot, blood soaks my shoe dripping everywhere. I step back. No. No. I killed Dr. Davis. I killed him, he is the killer, not Tony, this is all so wrong. 

My phone starts vibrating in my pocket, I pull it out and answer it without even thinking about what I was doing. Before I can get out of my trance enough the speak, I hear my wife crying. 
‚ÄúRussell‚Äù she sobs ‚ÄúI just saw the news announcement, my phone was ringing, I thought it was you needing a ride. It was Frankie, she was freaking out about the news, something about our friend Tony. Russell, it was Tony. Just please tell me you didn‚Äôt help him. Please. I need to know, did you k-kill those girls?‚Äù
‚ÄúWait, what? Slow down, why would you think I helped?‚Äù 
‚ÄúI don't know, Russell! You‚Äôve been acting so weird and distant lately! Then you keep making all these last minute plans with Tony and staying out all night! You were with him all night, Russell! Where are you?‚Äù 
‚ÄúNo, no, no, please believe me. I haven‚Äôt been with Tony, not the other day and not now. I only see him in the mornings, I swear.‚Äù
‚ÄúSo you‚Äôve been lying? What were you doing? Where are you? Where were you?‚Äù
‚ÄúI can explain it all later but I promise you I didn‚Äôt kill those women‚Äù I hear her take a deep shaky breath.
‚ÄúThank God you‚Äôre not a murderer. I can‚Äôt believe it, Russell. It was Tony this whole time. What a night‚Äù She sighs with relief. I look down at the man I killed, the blood, so much blood. I am a murderer. I‚Äôm a killer. An innocent man. I murdered an innocent man.
‚ÄúYeah what a night‚Äù

1i542o1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nothinghappeninghere/comments/1i542o1/food_for_thought/,Food for thought ,"Hi everyone! I've been reading everyone's comments and all the feelings that have been shared are completely valid. 

I wanted to offer a little bit of a different perspective/experience. I'm someone who had a little bit of a love/hate relationship with tiktok and would frequently delete it. A bit over 2 months ago, i decided that ultimately for me personally, the app was too overstimulating, addictive, and negative and that i no longer wanted to use it. I successfully went over 2 months without using it since the first time i installed it during covid. 

During this time, my attention span increased a ton. Like, a ton. I could barely watch TV before, now i can sit and read. My head feels incredibly less full of stuff (in a good way) and way more calm, centered, and grounded in my present life. My nervous system feels alot calmer. I noticed myself having more energy to do hobbies. I found myself enjoying reading reddit posts when I did need a dose of social media, which felt alot less overstimulating. (I understand reading based apps may not be good for everyone, check out tumblr! It has alot more photos). 

I did hop onto tiktok on the last day to scroll for a few hours, and say essentially say goodbye to an app that also brought me so much joy, laughter, and information. When the app is sold, I don't think it will ever be the same. If it's sold to meta, which seems likely, I refuse to ever touch it again out of principle. I also want no part in supporting something ""Trump saved."" When I was kicked off, I felt a wave of sadness and almost greif honestly. It's an end of an era. The golden age of tiktok. 

I say all of this to gently say as someone who just went over 2 months without tiktok, you may actually see some benefits to not having it. While the app was incredible in alot of ways, I do think it was highly addictive for alot of people and the screen time alot of people would put in was concerning haha (and no judgemdnt, ive been there too!). And while I'm so thankful for the news it gave me over the years, there's a difference between being informed vs. Doom scrolling and consistently getting an over abundance of political information that can lead to nervous system dysregulation, anxiety, sadness, etc.


On my last scroll, I watched a video where Bo Burnham was talking about how capitalists could no longer colonize land, and they moved to trying to colonize our attention and any spare minute of our lives to target adds/gather info. Whew. 

Greive the loss of tiktok AND take this as an opportunity to reclaim your attention span. To try other apps that the tech giants dont own. To pick up a new hobby or return to old ones. To go to your local library and get a library card. To watch an old favorite series. To recondition yourself to not pick up your phone first thing in the morning, or in a moment of boredom or uncomfortability. To meditate! To learn mindfulness skills. When youre drinking your coffee and youd normally be scrolling, really savor every sip. Feel the warmth of the mug in your hand. Feel your breath. Look out the window. While this situation sucks, you may eventually find yourself feeling alot better. 
I want to acknowledge that this app gave disabled people the ability to feel more connected to the world. 
There is obviously multiple truths to this conversation and nuance here, but i wanted to share my experience incase it can help anyone else. 
I hope you all get some good self care in. Sending love to each and everyone one of you.

I had a fun realization recently‚ÄîI think my alter ego is an ESTJ, the type that gets things done with precision, authority, and a touch of intimidation (think Martha Stewart or Miranda Priestly). While my natural INFJ self is intuitive, strategic, and reflective, my alter ego is all about executing with efficiency, setting high standards, and taking no nonsense.

She‚Äôs the one who schedules my life like a Fortune 500 CEO, insists on perfecting every detail, and keeps emotions neatly compartmentalized. I imagine she wears impeccable tailoring, drinks black coffee, and delivers directives instead of explanations. Meanwhile, my INFJ self is in the background, carefully orchestrating it all like a quiet mastermind.

My questions:
	1.	Can anyone help identify this set based on the markings and design?

I‚Äôm so over-fucking-whelmed üòÖ my fianc√© has nocturnal seizures, so nights are 100% on me. He has ADHD, so he has a really hard time concentrating on holding the baby (or even really tending to the baby at all). Which I understand both of those things. I‚Äôm not mad about either. But holy fuck it‚Äôs so frustrating. He does not get it at all. 

When he does help, it seems rushed because his attention span is very different to mine. (Example, last night I asked him to do a diaper change. Didn‚Äôt realize he had taken edibles. He very quickly changes baby, hands him back to me with his onesie off. The diaper doesn‚Äôt look like it‚Äôs on right. I roll my eyes and go to fix the diaper. No diaper cream. Baby‚Äôs not wiped well. Jfc.) like what the fuck. Such a simple fucking thing to do. And to take edibles, like double what the fuck. 

He‚Äôs working 5 days a week (a pretty simple job, which he admits himself), 8-4pm. He comes home, and most nights he will cook supper. Which is so appreciated. I end up cleaning up the mess most of the time, which would be fine if he would actually tend to the baby. 

Baby is 6 weeks old right now, and very much in the stage of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt fucking set me down or I will scream‚Äù. So getting literally anything at all done is HARD. Like no naps are even happening set down rn. He‚Äôs in my arms 100% of the time üòÖ that being said,  I truly am proud of how much I‚Äôm getting done regardless. Our house is honestly cleaner than it was before the baby came, because I can‚Äôt stand a mess. 

He doesn‚Äôt seem to understand this AT ALL. He makes comments all the time about ‚Äúyou never put him down,‚Äù like yes I‚Äôll just let the 6 week old scream. Wtf. 

He doesn‚Äôt help at night (which again, I‚Äôm totally fine with. Baby is EBF so I‚Äôd have to get up for any night wakings anyway, one of us might as well get a full nights sleep), so one would think in the mornings he‚Äôd help. At least on the weekends. Well ‚Äúoh I have to poop first‚Äù, okay fine. ‚ÄúWell just let me get my coffee and breakfast first then I‚Äôll help‚Äù, right. ‚ÄúWell jeeze I‚Äôd like to go do *whatever* today‚Äù. If he wants to shower, he needs to do that first before helping. He doesn‚Äôt stop ANYTHING he wants to do if the baby needs something. He‚Äôs got to do *whatever the fuck* first. I don‚Äôt have the option to do those things first. I‚Äôm lucky to get a half shower in. 

*example* last weekend we were getting ready to go pick up a grocery order (one of the only times I‚Äôm leaving the house at the moment), I just wanted a shower. I asked him to tend to the baby long enough for me to have a shower. I put him in his pack n play, with the Kick and play in it so he could hangout for a bit. Hopped in the shower, rushing of course because that is my life now. Within 10 minutes, I can hear the baby start to cry. I rush faster. Baby continues to cry. 5 minutes of me trying to finish the shower as fast as possible, I come out to see my partner on his phone completely ignoring our crying baby a foot from him in the pack n play. I was pissed, asked him why he wasn‚Äôt comforting him, ‚ÄúI thought he was just bitching I didn‚Äôt think anything was wrong‚Äù‚Ä¶. What the actual fuck do you mean. Like what. Blown away. 

He does not understand at all that my entire life has flipped upside down, in fact I wanted it. We wanted it together when we decided to have a baby. Not only did we just decide to have a baby, we really locked into the idea when we had not only one, but two miscarriages, and continued on to then try for a third time. We really really wanted this. I am so so so happy I have this baby, he‚Äôs literally everything I‚Äôve ever wanted and so so much more. But my mental health is soooo fucked, I really don‚Äôt have much help. 

My mother will come over and hold the baby for a while so I can get some stuff done. The entire time she‚Äôs here I‚Äôm running around like a chicken with my head cut off trying to clean. Not the most helpful thing she could do, but it is what it is. At least I get probably 4 hours in the run of a week where she holds him so I can get something done. 

I‚Äôve tried to bring up to my partner that I don‚Äôt feel supported enough, that I don‚Äôt feel like he‚Äôs helping enough. I‚Äôve tried to word it in nice ways, I‚Äôve tried to just be blunt. Regardless, he gets incredibly upset. But it‚Äôs almost like he feels bad for himself?? Like he doesn‚Äôt feel bad for me at all. He just gets mad at me for making him feel bad?? Like he immediately will just go ‚Äúyeah I suck!! I know!! I get it!! I fucking suck!‚Äù And I just kinda am like ‚Äú‚Ä¶.. did you hear anything I said?‚Äù And then he‚Äôll storm off, usually change the (*always full because changing a garbage is a two handed job and I have a baby that screams when I set him down*) garbage, go out to the garage and punch a wall or something. Then come back in and not speak to me for a while. It‚Äôs pleasant. 

I understand how relationships don‚Äôt make it through the newborn phase üòÖüòÖüòÖ there are so many great qualities about my partner. Like so so many. This is only example of the worst side of him lol, but Jesus Christ this is a lot. I‚Äôm so ready for this phase to pass.  

Anyone else live with a man they can‚Äôt really stand at the moment?? üòÖ

ETA:  I‚Äôm not sure what people think commenting ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt have had a child with him‚Äù helps? I wouldn‚Äôt have had a child with him if he was like this before we had the baby‚Ä¶ this is new behaviour. The baby is here, I‚Äôm very happy the baby is here, telling me I shouldn‚Äôt have had this baby that I went through hell to get here is not helping lol.

Here are two plot ideas we can dive into:

# Plot 1: A Tale of Love and Destiny

Though i don't have anything specific in my mind about this we can brainstorm our ideas and create a cute love story together in the ancient times...

Alternatively, if fantasy isn‚Äôt your thing, we could take this to modern times‚Äîa celebrity falling for a small-town artist, a workplace romance, or even a classic meet-cute in a coffee shop.

# Plot 2: Young Love

A love story between a man in his mid-20s (my character) and a woman in her early-to-mid-30s (your character). Perhaps your character is a no-nonsense professional who‚Äôs always had her walls up, but my character‚Äîa young, optimistic newcomer‚Äîsees through them. Whether it‚Äôs a slow-burn romance set in a corporate office, a charming meet-up at a travel destination, or neighbors who can‚Äôt seem to avoid each other, there‚Äôs plenty of room for tension and heartfelt moments.

If neither of these plots speaks to you, no worries! We can brainstorm something amazing together. Let‚Äôs build a story we both love.

I've been off work since we got our puppy in October.  We both work from home and have our own offices (empty nest 4 teh win).  I have been telling my husband how worried I am about going back this week because [Laska](https://i.imgur.com/kTGMcpe.jpg) is such a handful. He keeps looking at me like I'm crazy.  

This morning, he let me sleep till 10 while he got up a 7 with her.  Whenever he watches her (which isn't often) she mostly sleeps or lies there with a chew or sometimes plays ball with him.  

I got up, came downstairs and *immediately* she's nipping at my cuffs, my ankles, my butt, my shirt and jumping high enough to nip my shoulders.  She's barking at me and running around me refusing to sit or listen to commands unless I'm holding food.  I knew she was overly tired, but would run away when I tried to take her out so she could zoomie before crate time. Finally got her out and in her crate and she howled because I was *still* trying to get my coffee and she couldn't see me.  I finally got her to nap and here she still is, 90 minutes later, passed out with me sitting next to her.

My husband was shocked.  He's never seen her like this. He honestly didn't believe me when I was holding back tears telling him how difficult she is (and it's my fault I know because I just want one damn minute of peace so sometimes she doesn't get enough play or walk time). He says that she has never, not once, tried to bite or bark at him.  He's been under the impression we won the puppy lottery with the best behaved dog ever.

There‚Äôs even a complimentary coffee and pastry service delivered to your room at your request. Room service is also available 24/7 and is quite tasty. 

The hotel itself is beautiful and the location is incredible! It‚Äôs right on the middle of Roma Norte which is an amazing neighborhood. Lots of great restaurants and cafes close by. The hotel has 16 rooms total so don‚Äôt ever expect an upgrade here. 

With that said we booked this on points and had a standard room. The standard room is an interior room with no exterior window and a queen bed.

The other small issue we had was the bed was a little firm for our taste. Both of these issues are personal preference and I realize that. 

It was a great experience and would definitely stay in this hotel again. The service alone would have me wanting to stay again. I would just make sure to get one of the larger rooms with at least an exterior window.

They‚Äôve just been sheltered a ton as well though and are very isolated. I have concerns about some of their hygiene habits and i don‚Äôt know if it would be offensive to being it up or not. From my understanding they haven‚Äôt really had consistent in person friends their whole life and most hang out with their mom which is fine but im trying to figure out if some of their habits are autism and something i shouldn‚Äôt touch/correct or more so the result of being perpetually isolated. 

The primary thing is they spit a LOT. I figure to a degree its a sensory thing which is fine. They have a cloth they spit into for phlegm but they will also spit directly on their hand and wipe it on their pants or stick their fingers in their mouth. I never really say anything because although it urks me and grosses me out idk if saying something is crossing a boundry. In my head it seems that would be bad for them as well. They can get really sick putting their hands in their mouth or gwt other people sick by not properly handling their spit.

I want to tell them to use a cloth for everything and maybe get a tongue brush to use instead of their fingers when they feel like there is something on their toungue. Is this okay to say?

Their clothes also tend to be dirty. Their mom washes them and though i have some concerns i wont delve into too much with their dynamic (he only had ONE pair of pants and socks when i met him and maybe 3 shirts. I at first brushed that off as maybe financially related but they‚Äôve spent money on things i feel could have gone towards clothing for him but since i dont know the full story i don‚Äôt judge too hard, just got him some new clothes).

I kind of want ro show him how to do his own laundry because i don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs ever been shown. Like it doesn‚Äôt seem like its the autism as the reason why he doesn‚Äôt know how to it seems he kind of got neglected in terms of being taught the basics of self care like dishes, laundry, basic cooking, etc. it just really worries me as he‚Äôs in his early 20‚Äôs like me but lacks a lot of life skills and with his mom being his main caretaker and being older herself i get worried about his future if she were to get ill or unfortunately worse.

At the same time however i don‚Äôt want it to seem as if im tell a paralized person to walk. Like its hard for me to really tell what could be helped if i helped teach him and what couldn‚Äôt. He had fairly good social skills and gpod logic and reasoning, he has some dexterity issues but nothing horrible. He had anger issues related to failure but based on our talks it feels that stems from not getting proper help for his disabilities growing up and therefore being quick to give up because people tended to give up on him.

1i53i1e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1i53i1e/ex_wont_leave/,Ex won‚Äôt leave,"Seeking advice.  My husband of 20 years fell out of love with me about twelve years ago.  It happens, I understand, and I would have been happy to divorce him a dozen years ago and tried.

The first seven years he was an alcoholic.  He was drunk on our honeymoon.  He was a graduate student and I was earning the money to support him and his dog.  He took advantage of me and drank his fill on my tab if we went out to dinner.  He was fun, we had great conversations, he hugged me at night and I needed his support.  We had everything in common and I encouraged his talent.  His sex skills were selfish and sub par but I was so proud and in love, but when I asked him to be a bit more of an equal he said all his former girlfriends were good to go and he never needed to do anything extra.  It was my fault.

I did not have experience with alcoholics.  He hid it - and even had a still in his home office.  I had enough seven years in and asked for divorce.  He made promises to change and actually quit alcohol.  His father and mother are alcoholics.  He didn‚Äôt join AA he just went cold turkey.

He changed.  Avoidant personality disorder became more obvious.  If we ever had a disagreement he would accuse me of being out of control and then hide for weeks.  He punished me by disappearing.  I had to find him and coax him out and he would not acknowledge my needs.

He started the dream job that I helped him get in my industry.

Sex disappeared.  He claimed because I said he was fat.  He was actually, because he has addictions.  He switched from alcohol to food to sleeping aids to coffee to anything else that could switch his mind on and off.  He said he had EDD and was impotent.  I asked him to go to the doctor.  He got prescriptions he never used and never tried to overcome it.  I had said he was overweight and needed to get healthy and that might solve the sexual dysfunction.  I did not bully him and I apologized for hurting his feelings.  That was twelve years ago.

Prior, at years six and seven, I miscarried twice.  He never hugged me or talked to me when it happened.  He did not support me.  I went through it alone while he hid.

People love him.  He is gentle and does what he is told at work.  He says funny jokes.  People don‚Äôt like me so much.  The stress over this for twenty years has me an unhappy.  I don‚Äôt have the elevated joy I had when we married.

He promised me he would go to therapy.  He quit because his therapist wanted him to do work.  He shaved off the beard that poked me when he gave me a daily peck on the cheek ‚Ä¶ for a week.  It is smelly and very rough and was aggressively pressed against me on that kiss.

I realize he wasn‚Äôt in love when we married.  His proposal was a swan song that I misread as sincere.  I could go on and on - but he has been a great dad to our adopted son and he has since taken on some bills.  He has never supported me financially or emotionally though- he is just a roommate.

I could go on and on about how he isn‚Äôt a husband and feels entitled to abuse me emotionally.  But he won‚Äôt leave.  I have asked four times since finding his other addictions and reacting to his disinterest in me.  He treats me like I am an out of control narcissist if I get upset, so I know longer talk to him.  I just don‚Äôt care anymore.

It is time to let go, way overtime.  He  won‚Äôt leave.  He claimed this is his house even though I paid for 95% of the upgrades, additions and maintenance.  Fine - pay me out.  He won‚Äôt discuss it.  I gave in too many times and he must think I will cave again.

He broke my heart.  I want out.  He is like gum on my shoe.  I give in.  I am the asshole.  I am unlovable.  I am totally at fault.  He won‚Äôt leave.

His father is four times divorced and his mother lives in anger over being g the first he divorced.  The source of trauma is deep.  The avoidant personality disorder now hides in a shed on our property and lives his entitled life like he has every right to pass through and ignore me.  He won‚Äôt respond to my requests for paperwork or answer how we will divide property.

I need help.  What would you do to get out of this but still protect the best little boy in the world who idolizes him?  Our son ‚Ä¶ he is mature, a kind soul, well loved and unhurt by this.  I don‚Äôt argue in front of him or disparage his dad.  However, I am slowly dying.  I am I therapy, but still trapped.

My family is all dead.  I have no support system.  The dog I relied on for affection had a heart attack and died last month - and my husband had no empathy.  He told his friends in a texts on the computer my son does his online guitar class on that I was a hysterical female for crying about it.

1i53fn9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Breakupadvice/comments/1i53fn9/how_to_get_my_power_back/,How to get my power back,"I (26M) broke up with my partner of five years a year ago. It was the hardest thing I‚Äôve ever done, I loved her very much but I was battling demons and I could see it affecting her. There were also many moments where she was unfair, we‚Äôd argue constantly and I felt trapped. The breakup was traumatic, full of tears, hard on both of us but her more so of course. 

Fast forward about 7 months. I haven‚Äôt been working on myself, I became a borderline alcoholic, I was alone grappling with the guilt I had from ending it. I still cared about her, but knew I could never go back. I wanted to see her, at least as friends but in retrospect I definitely wanted to make things happen again. I missed having her in my life, so I asked if she‚Äôd like to grab coffee and she agreed. We get coffee, it‚Äôs awkward, I definitely look miserable (I had gained about 15 pounds). At the end of our short coffee break she says she has something to tell me, that she‚Äôs been seeing someone else. I tried to hide my emotions but she could tell I was upset, she gives me a hug and I go home in tears.

The next day I see her running with this new guy(we live in the same town) and he‚Äôs taller than me, more muscular. I‚Äôm still racked with emotion, so later that day I call her in my delusional state and tell her that I lied when I said I didn‚Äôt love her(true) and that I would wait for her. It made me feel better, at least temporarily. But later, 3 weeks, I ask to call again to apologize. I had felt pity from her when she hugged me, and this has worked its way into my mind. I call her for the last time and apologized, we had a ten minute conversation, I did some regretful things like asking if he goes to the same gym as me as I don‚Äôt want to run into him. The whole conversation she‚Äôs talking to me with more pity in her voice, like I‚Äôm a child. I say goodbye and feel worse off then before the call.

This woman is one who I respect, I think there‚Äôs a mutual understanding that things weren‚Äôt going to work out, that I broke up because I had to. And she seems to be doing really, really well. I‚Äôm happy for her, truly. But I can‚Äôt deal with the fact that this woman who I respect, who was my first and who I loved for five years doesn‚Äôt think of me with respect, that she pities me. I foolishly went back on my decision, and now 3 months after the coffee date I still feel it everyday, my self esteem is ruined. How do I get out of this mess? 

TLDR: I broke up with my ex, called her and confessed my love for her 7 months later, and I feel like she pities me. How do I get my power back 

Edit: I should include this: I‚Äôve lost 30 pounds since the coffee date, and I‚Äôm still going strong. It has been helping me a little, but it still hurts. I can‚Äôt help but compare myself to this new guy, I can‚Äôt change my height (6‚Äô) which I know is an adequate height but still.",1,1737306929.0,Breakupadvice,0,1.0,False

Looking to create a living room that blends modern style with the serene beauty of nature? [Organic Modern Living Room Ideas](https://www.bestosmosisexperts.com/living-room-with-plants-ideas/) are your perfect solution! This trend combines minimalist design with organic elements, emphasizing natural materials, clean lines, and sustainable d√©cor. Think wooden furniture, woven textiles, and earthy tones that make your space feel grounded and harmonious.

Start by incorporating natural wood furniture, such as a reclaimed wood coffee table or floating bookshelves, to add warmth and texture. Layer with soft, neutral-colored textiles like linen or cotton for a cozy yet chic vibe. Plants are essential in an organic modern space, bringing in vibrant greenery that connects your home with the outdoors. Consider large leafy plants or succulents in stylish pots to add life and color.

For the finishing touches, opt for natural stone surfaces like marble or granite and simple, sculptural lighting fixtures that enhance the calm atmosphere. This style is perfect for creating a peaceful retreat that still feels fresh and contemporary.

It's hard finding the sweet spot but I gotta try.,"It's been almost a week now. I am... okay. Still feeling withdrawal but it's looking up, i think. I was only drinking green tea or 1 shot espresso sporadically, with the occasional streak so not too high doses. I have been caffeine free before but never while medicated for my adhd.

We don't know exactly what is wrong with me health-wise (blood and urine look good on paper!) but I have anxiety/depression, adhd, arfid, and am a sleepy baby who also has insomnia. Wish me luck!!

Long version for anyone interested in comparing to their own experiences: I went to a sleep specialist. Was diagnosed with restless leg syndrome. Got an iron infusion due to low ferritin which helped marginally but i still had trouble falling asleep and was sleepy during the day.

I have been perscribed a stimulant for adhd/sleepiness which i had been taking in Combo with caffeine that made falling asleep even harder. So queue taking mild ""short-acting"" sedative. This made me sleepy even on my stimulant.

Sleeping pills of any kind make me too sleepy. Taking stimulant + caffeine made me wired af. Just caffeine could also made me feel wired. I also think i metabolize it weird. Coffee makes me so sleepy sometimes but tea is fine. Weird!

I decided to skip my sleeping pills last night and just take melatonin. It was a bit hard to fall asleep and i woke up once (withdrawal side effect of caffeine?). I took my stimulant this morning and even tho i had to lay down after breakfast for about an hour, i can feel them kicking in! Before i was still sleeping and napping thru it on the sleep meds.

I am hoping that i can sleep on days i take my adhd meds if i skip caffeine, and that i will be calmer and more focused as well.

I also think i was using caffeine to suppress my eating disorder, because it decreases appetite but gives energy. (My arfid is i fucking hate eating. It's a chore. Full stop)

And i spoke to a friend who also has adhd and disordered sleep, and is on stimulants for it and they said exercising in the evening rather than the morning works for them. I've been doing yoga so I'm gonna change when i do it and see if that helps me fall asleep. I will try to remember to update my experience in the next month or so. But i am hoping to see more improvements once the sleeping meds are fully excreted in 3-5 days and i am further along in my caffeine recovery. ",1,1737306654.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

Chill filtered, colored, 40% ABV.

Tasted in tulip glass. Rested for 5 minutes.

Nose: medium strong, flowers, sweet oranges (caramelized oranges), bit of vanilla and some kind of jam (fig jam? maybe?)

Palate: white chocolate and toffee are quite noticeable. Red berries (raspberry flavor), peach and unfortunately couldn't taste the coffee flavor.

Finish: medium; it was nice and smooth, sweet with a hint of fresh apricot.

Rating: 81/100

For the price of 20Eur, definitely worth it.

Not so complex, and beginner friendly.

Turns out milk was the issue. I bought buffalo milk from Instamart and then added sugar according to my taste and let it simmer for 5 to 7 mins on low flame in a separate pan. I kept mixing the creamy layer making it extremely thick  like you would do it for kheer.

As for ratio i would say 40% decoction and 60% milk. The end result was thick and flavourful coffee which I had tasted in restaurants near me. A massive upgrade from my instant coffee.

I would also try out different coffee brands especially the one with chicory in it.

A huge shoutout to all the people who pitched in their advice. Thank you very much üòäüôè. This sub have been really helpful to me. I would also post the pic of my coffee tomorrow as I forgot to do it today.",0,1737306392.0,IndiaCoffee,2,0.42,False

1i5381g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rants/comments/1i5381g/the_us_government_born_from_conspiracy/,The U.S. Government: Born from Conspiracy?,"Wow! Just finished watching the new Diddy documentary. I‚Äôve never really followed him, but he‚Äôs been in the news so much lately that my curiosity got the better of me. Honestly, I learned more than I expected‚Äîand more than I wanted to‚Äîbut it left me reflecting on a bigger picture. 

Some of the charges against him, valid or not as they may be, coupled with the way our justice system operates, got me thinking about the hypocrisy and paradoxes embedded in our system.
How can a nation founded on rebellion and what could technically be described as a conspiracy now enforce laws against those very same things it was founded on? It‚Äôs fascinating how history and power shape what‚Äôs considered ""just"" or ""criminal"" with the stroke of a pen and a conspiracy.

The documentary was more than just a glimpse into Diddy‚Äôs life‚Äîit seems like a lens into some of the contradictions of the American justice system. I am not justifying his behaviors at all.  I am just bringing to light a philosophical rant and the injustice of American justice.

I‚Äôve been reflecting on a fascinating philosophical and legal paradox: the very U.S. government and legal system that enforce laws against conspiracy were, in essence, born out of a conspiracy themselves. Think about it‚Äîour Founding Fathers secretly planned and acted against British rule, collaborating to create a new government. By definition, wasn‚Äôt that a conspiracy?

Yet, here we are, living under a system that now charges individuals for conspiring. How do we reconcile this type of ignorance? The distinction seems to lie in legitimacy. The Founders justified their actions by appealing to natural rights and self-determination, claiming moral grounds for their rebellion. But does that make their conspiracy ""better"" than others? Or is it simply because they succeeded?

It‚Äôs a paradox worth pondering: how can a system born from rebellion now prosecute conspiracies, when its very existence started the same way?
Diddy is a bad boy for sure but so are the USA and the Department of Justice. Who didn't want to pay their taxes and caused the Revolutionary War, extended and solidified slavery and caused many unnecessary deaths?

By the time of the American Revolution, there were approximately 500,000 enslaved people in the 13 colonies.

Total Estimate of Slaves in America:

From the early 1600s through the abolition of slavery in 1865, an estimated 10‚Äì12 million enslaved Africans were transported to the Americas via the transatlantic slave trade, though only about 388,000 were brought directly to what became the United States. Over generations, the enslaved population grew significantly within the U.S. due to natural reproduction.

The total number of deaths and casualties in the Revolutionary War is estimated as follows:

Deaths

American side: Approximately 25,000 deaths.

About 8,000 were killed in battle.

The remaining 17,000 died from disease, starvation, or other causes.


British side: Around 24,000 deaths.

This includes soldiers who died in battle, disease, and other war-related causes.


German mercenaries (Hessians): Approximately 7,500 deaths.

Civilians: Estimates vary widely, but thousands of civilians also died from war-related causes, such as raids, famine, and disease.


Casualties (Including Wounded)

American side: About 50,000, including deaths, injuries, and missing.

British side: Estimated 43,000, including injuries and prisoners of war.


Total Estimates

Deaths across all sides: Roughly 56,500.

Casualties (including deaths and wounded): Likely exceeds 100,000.


It's worth noting that disease (especially smallpox) caused far more deaths than battle wounds, a common trend in wars of that era.

Food for thought.

I'm the last person to preach about morality‚ÄîI‚Äôm a hypocrite too. I served overseas with Special Forces, and we took out over 420 high value targets in Afghanistan. Nobody blinked an eye; in fact, they called it service and gave us money and medals. But now here we are, sitting comfortably at home in America, sipping our coffee, all high and mighty, saying, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs wrong to kill humans.‚Äù

here's the mindfuck: i'm crushing it at university. top of my class. got that honors diploma from high school, now studying exactly what i've always wanted. professors think i'm the guy, peers respect me, and my future's looking bright af on paper.

i look at my certificates and diplomas and all i see is paper. just fucking paper. did it all to make my parents proud, to feel something when teachers say shit like ""i wish i had a son like you."" don't get me wrong - my parents are solid. got me the setup i wanted, never went hungry, never had a cold bed. i'm blessed family-wise, not mega rich but comfortable af. but...

but there's this other side that's just... done. completely fucking done. doesn't matter how many achievements i stack up or how hard i grind, there's always this voice in the back of my head whispering ""what's the fucking point?"" maybe it's burnout. maybe depression. maybe existential dread having a party with both. but it never shuts up.

some days, the only thing between me and the void is that cup of coffee. those late-night peazehub pomodoro sessions, random bursts of ""holy shit i can actually do this,"" pure stubborn spite to prove i can make it. but that shadow's always there, hovering over everything like some cosmic joke.

guess i'm posting this cause nobody talks about how you can look like you've got your shit together ‚Äî hell, even feel like it sometimes ‚Äî and still be stuck in this mental tug-of-war between existing and... not. does this ever get better? or is this just life now?

anyway, if you've ever been in this spot between coffee and the void, how tf do you deal?

1i536di,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mounjaro_ForType2/comments/1i536di/tz_6_week_status/,TZ 6 week status,"Hey all. I started compounded TZ from Lavendar Sky Health / Hallandale on Dec at low custom dose of 2 mg for two weeks , then tirate up to 4 mg for 4 weeks as prescribed by the LSH NP. tonight I will tirate up to 6 mg for 4 weeks or longer depending on my glucose readings, 

Here's some stats and feedback on where I am at:   
SW 233, CW 219. Thats about 2.33 lbs lost per week. Goal weight is 140 and I am giving myself 18 months from Dec 8 to lose it. Slow and steady for me. A1C was 9.7 with average glucose pre Dec 8 at 233. I have lost a jeans size and am well on my way to my current jeans fitting loosely. 

Current average Glucose over 1 week the past week are now 138. WOW getting close to pre diabetes readings. I am also no longer having wild glucose swings of everything from low 125 to 220 upon waking and 180-275 after meals. I am generally right in 125-165 readings with a few 180s and a couple of 220s after meals. I was getting 311-325 pre Dec 8th TZ start after meals. 

My endochinologist said I could stop Metformin and terminate both Glipizide which I HATED and Aloglipin which one shouldn't take with TZ. So basically I am now on only 1 med for diabetes: TZ. Do note I am being very mindful about what I eat: no sugar, very few fried foods, limited carbs, mostly focused on lean proteins, low carb veggies, beans and lentils, soups, and healthy fats. I am also walking every day sometimes multiple times a day. 

I have a lot more energy and just feel better overall. Food noise is gone. Cravings gone. taste for alcohol is limited. Tues, Wed, Thurs after I take my shot on Sunday nights are very low apetite days for me with some side effects. Thurs night - Monday eve are pretty much fine. 

Side effects ebb and flow: nausea, gas, occassional belching, and if I am not careful about water and fiber intake, some constipation and hard stools. I am managing these with pepto bismal, GasX, Pepcid AC drinking lemon ginger tea, taking it easy on my stomach by not drinking coffee or alcohol most days of the week, and really trying to keep my fiber and water up (sometimes that's hard)

Also note, I am not a long term diabetic. I was prediabetic 2017-2022, but had a roaring case at 12.7 A1C diagnosed Dec 2022, got it to prediabetes with just diet and exercise, but my mom died and I fell off the wagon. summer 2024 it came roaing back and metformin 2000 mg really wasn't helping so I decided to have the add-on meds. Insurance keeps denying me Mounjaro so in Dec I decided to take matters into my own hands. 

Ovefall I am very happy I decide to take this leap and will continue to reflect and keep stats. Good luck everyone!

I‚Äôm one week into my new job so im trying not to rock the boat already. I work in a pretty big building and my desk is in the middle of an open space with offices in front of me and behind me. In front of my desk is a EXTREMELY HIGH TRAFFIC AREA. People come and congregate in groups, will sit their coffee on my desk while chopping it up and just have tons of casual conversations right in front of my desk as if I‚Äôm invisible. The cross noise from the offices in front of me and behind me are jarring. Today those offices were on the same meeting via speaker and the echo was awful. The walkie talkies that go off consistently is an issue as well. Literally everyone will walk by on their way to the restroom and stop by my space to talk- talk- talk for what seems like 30min or so. I feel like one week in and I know everyone‚Äôs life story. I‚Äôve had to be on ‚Äú100‚Äù from the time I walk in to the end of day. This is non-stop and although I am a pretty extraverted person, I have been depleted at the end of each day. For onboarding this week, I had to ask someone to book the conference room just to be able to hear. 

The other people in my position have offices, but I am the only one in the building in this space. I mentioned this to my manager and the Director, who chuckled and gave a half-hearted ‚Äúoh we‚Äôre working on it‚Äù. The two people in that position prior to me left within a year. I‚Äôm not sure how vocal they were or if there were other issues at hand. From the rumblings I‚Äôve heard, this position has been a revolving door. 

I am a week in but am at my wits end. I am going insane! I begin training next week and cannot see how I can be productive or produce quality work in this space. I don‚Äôt want to seem pushy or demanding being that I‚Äôm new, but how can I say‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

This is a thread to share whether there was anything that stood out to you in church this morning (or yesterday, or any other day this week you may have worshiped).

Did you learn anything interesting in the sermon? Was there a verse that stood out? Did a song resonate with you? Did God lay anything cool on your heart? Was there a snack at coffee hour that stole the show? 

Post about it here!

I don't really know what else to do. I'm in Europe in a country with VERY LITTLE shame about bodies and sex. I was brought up by a mom who is fairly sex positive in a house without shame but me and my husband don't know how to navigate this anymore without causing either my kid to act inappropriate or get some shame issues. 

My oldest daughter is 4, neurotypical as far as we know, and is a happy sweet kid. When we watched TV, she sometimes had the habit of lying belly down on my legs when I rested them on the coffee table and swinging from one side to the other. After a while I would get tired from her weight and would ask her to move. She would get disproportionately upset. Folks, this kid is extremely calm, balanced, eloquent; I asked her to let my leg rest a little and she would just SCREAM. Since this was so atypical, I asked her to explain why she couldn't lie on my stomach instead and I don't think anything could have prepared me for the answer: your belly is not firm like your leg and it won't tickle my vulva. (!!!!) 

Y'all I was caught off-guard. I asked to grab a glass of water to recomp and managed to muster words for the following explanation to her: my love, no matter how it may feel to touch your private parts (she knows for women those are vulva, anus, breasts) you don't touch them to other people without permission, and you never do it in public. The only people that can touch them are mommy and daddy to clean you, or a doctor to examine you while one of us is in the room. No other adult is supposed to touch you or tickle you there, even if it feels good. 

I talked to her dad about this and he seemed more flustered than I was but decided that we went the correct direction. We didn't experience that behavior for a while and forgot about it with daily life. A little while later, she said to me after dinner: ""mommy, please leave the living room, I'd like to be in peace."" 
I thought she sounded funny but not out of the ordinary, so I went to the kitchen to clean, overlooking where she was in the living room. An armchair was partially blocking her but I could see she was lying down watching Frozen. Later on, my husband joined us and, from a better angle, saw that she was actually lying on the armchair's arm rest swinging from side to side. From afar, it looks like some calm stimming of some sort but we know what it is. 
He got quite frustrated with her and mentioned that she would injure herself and had her stop. 

We caught her in the act a few days later, tried to talk to her about it and say that she shouldn't do that against furniture, and it seemed to stick. 

Today, she again asked me to leave the living room and leave her in peace there. 
I calmly pause the movie, and tell her that a private part is touched in a private place. Private places are the bathroom and her bedroom, and I repeated the part about safe touch by safe people. 

She then asked me if it's OK to touch it in her own bedroom. I confirmed that and she said ""but I can't do it in my bedroom!"". Y'all. I just didn't know what to say. I was quiet for a few seconds to give her a chance to show me what she was fishing for. She said nothing else, just ran into her room and closed the door. After a whole she screamed ""I'll do it in my room!!"" - thanks. I hate it.
Now her dad heard it, and came to me doing funny face-palms and questioning our sanity. We don't know if we did the right thing.

She came out a few minutes later, acting normal, and seems to have moved on. 

This leads me to a whole bunch of questions: we are a liberal household. I, however, don't want to be PUSHING my daughter to explore. She can do what she wants, I'm trying to guide her to not be an inappropriate creep and I don't wanna traumatize her. Could I have done better? I think I can still adjust course since this is all so recent. 

She sleeps in her room with the door closed, we never had any issues with her door being closed, but we usually go in and open during the day if she's in there. Should we knock? She's barely 4, what if she's doing something crazy? 
Say we don't knock. Catch her in the act AGAIN. Ignore? Leave? 

This is all so bizarre. I don't know what to do!

Edit with extra question: I assume that she figured that she can do the same in the small armchair in her room. Can she injure herself from swinging on furniture? I am aware adults do much worse but she is not an adult. ",12,1737305094.0,breakingmom,4,0.88,False

So this guy I‚Äôve been seeing for about two months and I had a quite though conversation a few nights ago:


We‚Äôve been having a lot of fun together, discussed quite serious topics, he quickly introduced me to his family while talking to them on FaceTime and we‚Äôve almost spend every night together since seeing each other for two weeks since we‚Äôre basically neighbours. Two weeks ago we had the exclusivity talk and discussed that we both saw it going in a relationship direction which we would discuss at a later point in time again. 

Then this past week I‚Äôve felt like something was off when we saw each other. He still imitated hang-outs and talking but the intimacy level was different and the vibe felt off. 

I have previously thought that we we‚Äôre moving a bit fast and i saw it as a sign to have a conversation about slowing down and maybe seeing each other less - and in relation to that explore why he seemed different. When I asked him about it he said that he had been different because he felt a bit less strongly about me than previously and he haven‚Äôt been able to understand why as we have great chemistry and a lot of fun together and he wants to keep seeing me. He also said that he had a hard time seeing us being in a relationship as things are now and that he didn‚Äôt necessarily would be too disappointed if I hooked up with someone else. This obviously surprised me quite a bit and I asked him if he‚Äôd only felt like this for a week. He said yes and then I suggested that we had spend a lot of time together, that the both of us just had exams and that it‚Äôs wintertime and overall he had been quite tired. 

After I said that the conversation changed a bit and he seemed like he felt like that ‚Äúexplanation‚Äù made sense. Then we talked again and I asked him if he still wanted to see me: yes, if he still somewhat had feelings for me: yes, and then finally I asked him how he would feel if I dated someone else: weird. I also stressed that I do not want a situationship and he agreed. So we both agreed to slow things down and I said that I needed him to give it an honest shot and he agreed. He said that he likes me and sees a lot of potential in us and I agreed. It should also be added that he said that he wanted to focus on us. Something we did not talk about but I am wondering could have an effect is that he is studying in my country and is finished in half a year - and he is unsure if he‚Äôll move back home or stay here. 


Next day we talked went for a walk, got coffee, which he suggested, talked a bit and planned to meet up and do something fun and date-like in a weeks time because I‚Äôm away for vacation. When we talked he stressed that he didn‚Äôt see this as a test period but as a re-shift in our dynamic. He also said that he was really glad that we talked last night and that it felt much better today for him. 

I‚Äôm quite confused now: it feels like we have a very certain plan, but the part about losing feelings hits a lot. He seemed really tired and confused, but it‚Äôs very difficult to not think about but it hurts that if the explanation is just that he needed space why has he not said so? What do you think? Should I run - like i just a way to softly let me down or should I give it a chance and pull back and give him space or how would you proceed from now on? I really do like him and want things to work out.


Sum: guy I‚Äôve been seeing and perhaps rushed things with in a very relationship-kinda-way acts weird and says he‚Äôs losing feelings but still wants to see me in an exclusive way. We agree to slow down and date with more intention but now I‚Äôm really confused. ",1,1737305012.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

AMPHETAMINE, COFFEES, STRESS, NO SLEEP and CELL  that is my 5m square room all contribute to me being stiff and not healing. The worst of these is actually the stress, dayjob and being financially unwell. 

I can't take amphetamine out because I get too emotional, bitchy and nonproductive and I can't have that right now. Coffee maybe perhaps.

What supplements can help my back injury healing without making me emotional and weak? I can't have that right now. 

I was thinking something like NAC would be beneficial... apparently it chills you out, am I going to be brain fogged with this along with theraputic dose amphetamine? 

I have very bad lower back in my mid 20s and have some disc herniations going on that just won't fucking heal. Inflammation, stiff back and all that.

I was the same weight for most of my adult life until I hit my forties. Then all of a sudden, 2-3lbs a year were making themselves at home on my body. It's not a lot, but over the years, it adds up. I'm now officially, for the first time in my life, overweight.

I have ADHD so dieting / meal planning / calorie counting = immediate overwhelm. I'm hoping IF, which has clearer boundaries (eat or don't eat) can help me reverse the trend and lose a few lbs.

Full transparency: I've actually tried IF before, but my fasts were erratic and I relied too much on coffee, which wasn't great for my anxiety.

This time I'm being much more gentle on myself: started with 14:10 on the weekend, moved to 15:9, and hope to settle into 16:8 when I'm ready.

I'm also using a tracker, which I'm finding super motivating, as I can track and reward my long-term consistency, rather than just challenging myself to go as long as possible without food.

(I know lots of people on this sub do longer and more intense fasts, but honestly...I'm not good with failure. I'd rather start 'small' and set myself up for success, even if it takes longer.)

I already work out 6 days a week so hopefully that will help me to maintain my bone and muscle density.

I've asked myself for a month's commitment, and if it feels good, we'll go another month. And then another. But I'm trying not to think too far down the line. Slow and steady wins the race.

In the last week I've lost 1.5lbs and an inch off my waist, which is exactly the kind of pace I'm hoping for.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
  
**Affordable & Accessible Plans**

We believe quality TRT should be within reach for everyone. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôve developed a **subscription model** offering:

* **3-Month, 6-Month, or 12-Month Plans**
* **Unlimited Blood Work Reviews**
* **Around-the-Clock Access** to our doctors and medical team

Each plan provides the same comprehensive level of care, ensuring you can focus on your health, ask questions, and receive protocol reviews and updates‚Äîall without worrying about any unexpected costs.   
For more details here:[ TRT Australia Pricing](https://trtaustralia.com/pricing/).  
  
**Transparent Pricing:**¬†

On average, our clinics costs (including **subscription** \+ **medication**) runs at an average of **$1,588 per year**. This might shift slightly depending on individual needs, but there are **no hidden fees or unexpected charges**‚Äîwhat you see is what you get.

* **Forget Consultations** ‚Äî **Embrace Uninterrupted Medical Support:** Have questions or need medical advice throughout the year? Concerned about running out of ""consultations"" with the doctor? Need answers without booking? Don‚Äôt worry. Our clinical team is always here to address your health concerns. Simply submit your blood work, and your protocol will enter an adjustment period. If any changes are deemed necessary, they‚Äôll be implemented at no extra cost‚Äîever. Plus, you‚Äôll receive detailed feedback from the doctor every. single. time.
* **Unlimited Blood Work Reviews:** You‚Äôre required to get your blood work done every four months‚Äîbut we‚Äôll make it a breeze. Maybe you‚Äôre feeling like something is off? Reach out! Let us know what‚Äôs going on. If blood tests are recommended, rest easy knowing they‚Äôll be assessed every single time without any extra fees. Whether you decide to schedule a review every other month (you really don‚Äôt need to, but hey, we‚Äôre here for you) or stick to the four-month requirement, our clinical team has you covered‚Äîno hassles, no surprises.
* **Secure & Compliant Record-Keeping:** We take documentation and security seriously, maintaining comprehensive records of your treatment to ensure clarity and transparency. If a governing entity ever needs to review the details of your prescribed protocol, we have everything carefully documented and ready. Plus, we proudly display our LegitScript badge, which validates our legitimacy and adherence to industry standards. Earning that certification meant every aspect of our operations‚Äîfrom our website to our medication/medical offerings‚Äîunderwent a thorough review, so you can trust you‚Äôre in good hands.
* Cost Breakdown: **$1,588 per year** translates to roughly **$4.35 per day** on average‚Äî*which is cheaper than your daily coffee, but far more valuable if you ask us!*

**No surprises. No extra charges.** Just a straightforward approach to ensuring you receive the care you need, when you need it.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Seamless Transition for Your TRT Journey**

If you‚Äôve recently found yourself in need of a new provider due to these unsteady times, we‚Äôre here to help make the transition easy.

Our focus is ensuring that you have uninterrupted, quality care.

**Why We‚Äôre Different**

**What We Don‚Äôt Provide**  
  
If you‚Äôre looking for anabolics, high-dose regimens, or any medication simply because you saw it online, know someone who was prescribed it, or heard of a clinic offering it, we won‚Äôt provide it‚Äîit‚Äôs not in your best interest, nor would we ever do so. We also don‚Äôt dispense AAS, HGH, peptides, or any other substances that lack TGA approval. While we appreciate your input, our duty is to craft a treatment plan that genuinely supports your health.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
  
**Our Commitment to You**

* **Transparency:** You‚Äôll always have a clear picture of your treatment plan and its rationale.
* **Evidence-Based Practice:** We use data, research, and proven clinical methods for all recommendations. **‚ÄúWe treat symptoms, not just the numbers.‚Äù**
* **No Unnecessary Medication:** We never recommend additional medications without first exhausting all other therapeutic avenues or establishing a clear, clinically justified rationale for doing so. For individuals new to TRT, we do not automatically introduce estrogen blockers or other adjunct treatments. Instead, we closely monitor each patient‚Äôs hormonal profile and clinical presentation, fine-tuning dosage or frequency as needed to optimise your levels. Only when all alternative strategies have been thoroughly evaluated‚Äîand it is demonstrably in your best interest‚Äîwill we consider introducing another medication. Every decision is backed by evidence, clinical expertise, and comprehensive documentation.
* **Affordability & Accessibility:** Our subscription model is designed to keep the focus on your well-being‚Äînot on complicated billing, unnecessary fees, or misleading sales/marketing tactics. Maintaining an active subscription ensures you remain under the dedicated clinical care of TRT Australia, receiving the ongoing support and expertise you deserve from our clinical team.

**Community Engagement**  
  
That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre here. Sure, all the clinics on this sub might technically be ‚Äú*competitors*,‚Äù but we **share** the same ultimate goal: improving the lives of men across Australia. We stand alongside every clinic committed to raising the bar and delivering real results. We don‚Äôt see competition‚Äîwe see an opportunity to **collectively elevate the standard of care, education, and access.** Together, we‚Äôre taking a stand against dodgy practices/protocols and putting integrity back into the industry where it belongs. At the end of the day, it‚Äôs all about you‚Äîthe men who rely on us, push us to set higher standards, and remind us what‚Äôs at stake. Do your due diligence, weigh up your options (this sub has some fantastic choices!), and make the decision that‚Äôs right for YOU‚ÄîBecause your progress drives our purpose.

Thanks for diving into our clinic intro‚Äîbrevity isn‚Äôt our strong suit, but clarity is!

1i5294t,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1i5294t/newb_experience_gaggia_e24_vs_bambino_pus/,Newb experience: Gaggia E24 vs Bambino Pus,"This is my subjective experience of using Gaggia Classic E24 and Sage Bambino Plus for a couple of weeks (paired with Baratza Encore ESP). 

I suspect, the list of generally available options when picking up a new (not second hand) newb-level machine, with guaranteed customer support for around 500 EUR is more or less the same for everyone, and comes down to Gaggia Classic and Bambino Plus. Of course, there is also Lelit Anna (with or without PID), but it was ruled out quite soon in the process because of the polished chrome body, whihc would get covered in finger prints, coffee and scale stains in like 43 seconds. 

TLDR - it's Gaggia for me: Bambino Plus is not without compromises, and the features it offers are either irrelevant for me, or do not outweigh the weaknesses.

**Size, look, feel and size:**

First, the ""compactness"" of the Bambino Plus is just not real. It is slighly narrower, a bit lower, a**nd almost 50% deeper**. It really occupies space on the countertop. Also, the plate for cups and accessories on top is barely useable in comparison with the Gaggia (nad does not heat up cups). Unless you are constrained by a low-hanging cabinet, Gaggia will take less space.

Second, Bambino just feels flimsy and plastic: thin sheet metal has a lot of give, the drip tray rattles. Gaggia is build like a tank in comparison.

**User experice:**

You have to hold Bambino Plus firmly, to get the portafilter in and out. You get used to it, but this is definitely not a positive. Gaggia mostly stays put.

The water tank design on the Bambino Plus, with the filter mount inside, is superior. The tank on the Gaggia is bigger and lasts longer. The one on the Bambino Plus has better visibility of the water level. I preferred to fill in both machines from the top; it ends up practically working the same for both. 

The drip tray on the Bambino Plus is ridiculously small, and ambino Plus fills it faster than even the half-profile drip tray on Gaggia.

I do not care about milk frothing functions, so the biggest benefit the Bambino Plus's auto frothing is kind of lost on me. I tried it once, and it seems to work fine. I just do not particularly care about it. 

I time my shots, so the programmable buttons on Bambino are more of a distraction than a value add for me. I kind of prefer to turn the pump on and off by myself. I know you can program the shots' duration; probably would have found a use for it at the end. 

The cup clearance is a known pain point on the Gaggia, and this is very much true: some of my cups do not fit with the stock portafilter and the stock drip tray. I will have a bottomless portafilter soon (a bit more on it later) and I fully expect this will sove the issue. 

Now, on the Bambino Plus the issue is the very opposite, and it got on my nerves quite quickly: it is so freaking tall, that the falling coffee stream always splashes, even if it's veritcal. The splashes fly around, and also land on the polished metal back plate, which start to look like it had pox, after a couple of shots.

 If it's not verical even slighly (as it happens at the beginning of the extraction) and you are using a smaller cup, then  there is a good chance the first couple of grams will just miss the cup. I ended up putting a block of wood about 4 cm high on the drip tray, then the scale, then the espresso cup. I think they had to make it so tall, so that the milk jug fits on the frothing temp sensor. But damn is this annoying.

Warm up is almost immediate on the Bambino Plus, but you may need to do an empty shot before each shot (more on it later). This kind of negates the advantage in this area. Gaggia gets to usable status from cold in about 3 minutes. No, the group head is not warm enough at this point etc, but after the ""ready"" light goes on, I can pull a shot and it'll be just fine. I did not find the machine finicky at all with regard to the temperature. 

**Taste:**

The Gaggia is a stock european E24 version: no PID, 15 bar OPV spring. I did not temprature surf, nor try to simulate the preinfusion. With the grind size tuned to get 1:2 ratio in about 30 seconds, I can say that the shots tasted similarly on the Gaggia and the Bambino BUT the Bambino Plus was noticeably colder. Not cold, it was really OKish. I probably would not notice it, without comparison, but there it is. And this even after warming the group up first with an empty shot.

**Bonus: Use of ESE pods for decaf and for partner acceptance**

My wife needs an occasional coffee, but cannot be arsed to grind, weigh, puck prep, and puck dispose. I was happy to see that the Gaggia, with the default single dose non-pressurised basket takes in the ESE pods, and makes a rather credible espresso. I tried the Illy Clasic Roast 7g pod in & 21-24g liquid out, and yeah, it's more than serviceable, better than a nespresso, IMO. When I do get a bottomless bormafilter, I'll leave the stock one with the single-shot non pressurised basket, so that my wife can always grab it, and make a shot without hassle. Partner acceptance was a big angst point for me; happy that it worked out ;-).

I did not try it with the bambino Plus, so cannot compare.

**Other considerations**

The possibility to mod Gaggia was a consideration. Given that I had no problems at all with the temperature on Gaggia, the PID mod goes from ""oh my god need to have it"" to ""I will think about it / good to have this option for the future."" Same for the OPV. 

At the end, I kept the Gaggia, returned the Bambino Plus. I hope you espresso newbs out there in the same situation as me will find this interesting / relevant.",3,1737303921.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

     It‚Äôs funny how you will lecture, enforce, and give grief for all of the phantom rules you create, but it is you who struggles to follow them. Your big speeches and proclamations, sermons among other things, mean nothing to me or us. There are times when I just want you to go to hell, life would hurt less if you just died, like the withering flowers- out with the old, in with the new. I feel that if you departed from my book that is the story of my life, I would be able to rebirth into a new, free person. I‚Äôve spent so long pretending, as a way to protect the little me, I told you that it was because I was viewed a certain way by the family, but maybe it started with you, a way to hide how I truly felt about you, me, them. I think you hurt me so much, that I put on a mask so thick to protect me from you, that I didn‚Äôt even know it was there. Funny how I did a better job at protecting me than you did, and that‚Äôs your job. I‚Äôve been trying so hard to do well, for what I thought was you, but in reality I was fighting for a chance to escape you. It amazes me how nice and easygoing you made yourself seem. I though I was crazy for thinking there was something wrong with me, but its you- both of you. You buy me nice things and tell me great ambitions, but that‚Äôs how you got me huh? Made me feel that I was in the best place I could‚Äôve ever been in, happy family- both parents present- three siblings, like a hallmark movie‚Äô the ‚Äúperfect poster family‚Äù. It makes me sick how you make me work my ass off, but then you make it meaningless because the difference between my hard work and yours, is that is brings in money and mine doesn‚Äôt. You constantly degrade, telling me that this is all i‚Äôll amount to, maybe not word for word‚Äô but underneath all of your nice words, your trying to keep me in you clutches so that I wont be anything more than what you want me to be. When I have problems you laugh them off and tell me to not make a big deal out of it. When my siblings disrespect me- calling me the cause of there problems, that I just make life harder, you tell me- that‚Äôs the way siblings are, and we‚Äôll grow out of it. Sometimes I wonder if you actually say all of this because you want me to ‚Äútoughen up‚Äù but I don‚Äôt understand why, because I‚Äôve already told you- I‚Äôve been bullied, stoned, berated by those around me. The only reason why it hurts when you do it, is because you‚Äôre my parents. I told you, that it‚Äôs different when you say things, because I value your opinion, thoughts, everything. I actually care about you, that‚Äôs why when you say things it hurts more than a stranger on the street. But my mistake, for thinking that you and that stranger held any difference. My mistake that I thought that you would always be there to protect me, like you promised me, but instead you‚Äôve been hurting me and I was too dumb to realize. Even after you called me a bitch crybaby- Mother, why didn‚Äôt you protect me? I expected David to go off on a rant, but I thought you, Jasmine, would protect me. I think that‚Äôs why I cry at night, knowing that the one thing you actually expect your parents to do, they don‚Äôt do it. I‚Äôm not sure what this is, but I‚Äôm sure my heart is broken, even though I‚Äôve never been truly in love with someone, I feel this hurts 10 times worse. I don‚Äôt think I can ever be happy with you around anymore, I don‚Äôt think I can lean on you anymore, or confide, express, share, I- for the first time I feel like I‚Äôm living in a strangers home. When David left, when I thought you were splitting, I thought that i would be miserable without you David, that my only father figure, would disappear and I would‚Äôve lost a loved one. But now, I just hope you walk out, leave, suffer, I don‚Äôt ever want to see you again. Jasmine, you were my mother, I saw how when David left you, you would cry, struggle, and my siblings and I did the best we could to support you, but yesterday, when you abandoned me, and left me to David‚Äôs mercy, when he ruined the unshakeable parent image of you both that stood tall in my mind, and you agreed with him, I knew I lost my parents. They were gone, but unfortunately you were there. And when I needed my mother the most, you showed up, breaking the tether that we once had, that ‚Äòunbreakable‚Äô bond that people say a mother and child have, you destroyed it. You both always talked about brighter days, where we would be truly happy and never loose sight of each other, but why did you lie David? You always made false promises, you promised a house, my own room, a new bed. I have the same bed since i was in pre-k, now I‚Äôm a sophomore in high school. I never knew I had to earn myself a bed that I could actually fit in. Jasmine, you always said you wanted me to embrace your past, and learn ‚Äòmy‚Äô culture,but it isn‚Äôt my culture, it isn‚Äôt my past, the only thing connect me with st Vincent is blood. I don‚Äôt care for carnival or soca, or the Caribbean at all, it was a nice flex for a while though, but when I really tried to embrace it, your family made it very clear that I was not one of them. That I am American and that is all I‚Äôll ever be. You are the immigrant not me, I think I‚Äôve grown to learn that that‚Äôs the truth. So when I struggled, trying to find a place where I could build a stable foundation, which I thought would be your culture, your family, your island, your roots, you ripped it from right from under me. Then I was floating in space again. I told you both that I fell out of love with rowing, I felt burnt out, tired, and David told me that that‚Äôs what hard work means. Which got me thinking, if I know what it means to work hard, why don‚Äôt you? David, you‚Äôve been trying to start up a business since before I was born, and jasmine, you keep telling me that you want to loose weight and that i should help you, but you would never do the first work out with me. It‚Äôs pathetic how I let two pigs make me cry. When you tell me, us that we have to do better with cleaning, normally there‚Äôs a role model that helps us solidify new habits, but you leaving your big bowl of popcorn with soda can in it and leaving half eaten dinner on the coffee table isn‚Äôt a good way to show your kids how to be cleaner people. You tell us to clean our rooms, but yours hasn‚Äôt been clean in years. I don‚Äôt understand how people like you became parents. I think college drop outs and failed soccer stars shouldn‚Äôt be telling me about my life. Jasmine, you‚Äôve let people call you coconut and you just let it happen. I always stood up for myself, even when you found out i was being bullied. You both make me feel sad. I hope, that if one day you get this, maybe it could get into your thick meat brains that you hurt me, and I don‚Äôt ever think I could ever see you as my true parents ever again.",2,1737303749.0,toxicparents,0,0.67,False

I am fully aware of my attachment issues, and it is something I am constantly working on to make myself a better person and partner, but it leaves me vulnerable to not knowing what normal and healthy reactions to problems in a relationship are. So am I overreacting?

I've (35f) been with my boyfriend (39m) for just under a year, although I've known him much longer. Our relationship has been good, I love him, we laugh, get along well, have the same goals. We were planning to start a family. The only reservation I had about him initially is that we have differing political opinions and he has said a few misogynistic things that I didn't like. I put this down to him being a bit sheltered and inexperienced (I'm his first girlfriend), not that that's an excuse. When I spoke to him about it he agreed it wasn't acceptable and said he was working on seeing things from a women's perspective. Although he can still be a bit antagonistic with his views but acts like it's a joke. I've pulled him up on this a few times.

I have some trust issues due to previous life events and I've been wary about letting them affect this relationship and have been totally honest and vulnerable to him about everything. We've spoken at length about what we want, need and expect in a partner to ensure we're not setting down the wrong path with one another.

Early on in our relationship he mentioned to me about a guys trip where they all went to a strip club (we had just gotten together). He had an argument with a friend because some of them were reluctant to go but he was really keen and insistent on going to one. My face must have said what I was thinking because he said, ""don't tell me you have a problem with that?"". I then asked him if he's ever paid for sex. He replied with, ""have you?!"". This unsettled me for a little while and I thought about ending things. I excused it as he had been single for a long time, maybe he regrets it and it was a one off, but it left a lasting impression of the type of person he may be.

Fast forward a month or so, I'm about to go to have a shower, I went to get undressed but felt faint so went to go back to sit down. I realised that when I came in he looked startled, his pants were undone and he turned off whatever was on his phone. Again, this unsettled me. I'm not a prude by any means, and we have a healthy and regular sex life, but I didn't understand the desperate need to rub one out quickly while I'm in the shower. We'd had sex the night before and were for sure going to have sex again at some point that day.

I didn't confront him about it but we later discussed expectations in relationships and I told him I wouldn't like if he is masterbating while I'm in the house. I told him my feelings about a previous relationship where my ex couldn't keep his dick out of his hand and I don't want to be with another person like that. He was in complete agreement and told me he hardly ever masterbates anymore since he's been with me, and he said he doesn't watch porn, he thinks it's terrible and horrible.

I have no problem with him masterbating, I do it, we all do it. I have a problem with him doing it while I'm in the house and I have a problem with it being incessant and obsessive.

I know that everyone is different and what you accept in relationships is different but when something is discussed and agreed upon, that sets the precedent for you as a couple. And this was ours, to respect each other all of the time even when the other person doesn't know about it.

I convinced myself I read the situation wrong and moved on. I've completely trusted him, viewed him with such high regard and probably put him on a pedestal, I was willing to look past our differing political views (even though they are often an area of contention for us). I went out one evening with friends, we had planned when I came home to have sex, we'd been excited for it all day.

Afterwards, he was showing me something funny on his phone and his searches came up, he had been looking at porn either when I was out or while he was waiting for me to get out of the shower. I asked him what it was and he got annoyed and denied it. He later apologised and poured his heart out to me saying he's so sorry he hurt me and how he hopes it doesn't change anything between us. This changed something about him for me.

He was the one who offered up the information that he doesn't watch porn, I never told him I don't want him to. I just did not want for him to turn out to be a sex addict and chronic masterbater. His reaction made me uncomfortable and I spent the next week or so deciding if this ick is going to be the beginning of the end for me. We spoke a lot about trust, communication, respect, etc. he's said all the right things, been reading books about relationships and communication.

Two weeks later, I'm getting out of bed, he asks if I'm getting up, I told him yeah, he said he's going back to sleep and I'll see him later, I give him a kiss and go about my business. About 20mins later, the dog wants back up to bed with him and so I go and let her in. When I open the door, he is completely startled, covering himself up, phone in his hand and he jumped around to lie on his front saying he's stretching his back out. I was like uh are you ok? Flustered he started saying nonsense so I went back downstairs. He came down, had coffee and started casually talking about how he had been on the phone to his brother when he was in bed, telling me details about their conversation. I was a bit suspicious but kinda relieved because maybe I got it wrong.

His brother called him later on and began talking like he hadn't spoken to him in a while, he got up and left and went to speak in the kitchen. Later I brought it up to him, he showed me his call history, there was no call in bed, he completely made it up. He acted confused and kept saying he called someone. After spending the day apart, I eventually asked him if he had anything to say and he said he got confused and was actually messaging someone. So he was continuing to lie.

More than anything, I hate lies, lying, liars. To me, nothing someone does is worse than lying about it. I sincerely believed that he was an honest person, I've never suspected hes lied to me but now I doubt everything he's said to me. I'm really hurt and I don't know if I can come back from it and ever trust him again.

I ordered the same thing from each spot to help try and have some uniform decision making (everything bagel with scallion cream cheese) - Here is my list so far:

1. The Bagel Shop on 93rd & 3rd: I honestly believe these are the freshest bagels and the most consistent from any spot in the UES. Bagels were crispy on the outside and the perfect soft doughy inside with a healthy serving of great cream cheese. Also I think the staff is really nice and efficient!

2. Kossar‚Äôs on York Ave: another consistent place with great coffee. Efficient line, good service. Their everything bagel is less seeded so if that‚Äôs your vibe 100% recommend

It didn‚Äôt hit me right away because you were consistent still in messaging and calling me. The updates of our whereabouts is the only thing that was lost at that time. 

But it hit me when you started being cold and distant in the first week of this month. I begged for closure for three weeks and you never showed up. Until a girl got involved who seemed to be really close to you to the point that you eat out when we were still together. And you never mentioned to me anything about it or her. I confronted you but you just told me that you guys are friends and people around you just tease that you guys are good together. You denied it with an excuse that you guys are friends only and NOT BECAUSE YOU ARE IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH ME. It hurts like hell.

Now I realize, if you are really willing to give me a proper closure, you have done it from the start. And not constantly giving me hope that you‚Äôll give it. You even promised a coffee friendly date. 

I‚Äôve read a lot here that NO CLOSURE IS CLOSURE. I love him and still want closure but I ak tired of begging for it. And I am done. 

You will never hear anything from me again. 

God knows how much I tried to save our relationship. But if you moved on and constantly making me feel that you don‚Äôt need me anymore and that you do not value me anymore, then it is time for me to close this chapter of us. 

I love you still but it is time for me to move forward just like what you did right after breaking up with me. ",7,1737303474.0,letters,2,1.0,False

I‚Äôve built a decent following on TikTok (around 15K followers) by posting videos about travel hacks and budget-friendly destinations. It‚Äôs been amazing to connect with people who share the same wanderlust, but now I‚Äôm concerned about what will happen if the platform gets blocked.

To give you some context, I was living in Europe last summer and used TikTok to document a two-month backpacking trip through Eastern Europe. I had no idea it would resonate with so many people, but one video about finding cheap train passes in Poland went viral. That one post brought me over 5,000 followers in a week. Ever since, TikTok has been my main outlet to share content.

But now I‚Äôm facing a dilemma: where do I go from here? I was already pushing my followers to Instagram and YouTube, but those platforms just don‚Äôt seem to have the same magic when it comes to quick, viral content. Plus, the algorithm on TikTok has been way more generous to small creators like me compared to Instagram‚Äôs ""pay-to-play"" vibes.

I‚Äôve heard people talk about using VPNs to access TikTok if it gets banned, but I‚Äôm not sure how realistic or sustainable that is. Does anyone here have experience with that? Or are there other platforms you‚Äôre considering? I‚Äôve seen names like Clapper and Lemon8 pop up in discussions, but I haven‚Äôt tried them yet.

Also, side question: has anyone else started to feel a bit paranoid about putting so much effort into building an audience on just one platform? The whole thing has been a wake-up call for me to diversify my content, but I‚Äôm not sure where to focus my energy next.

Would love to hear your thoughts. How are you preparing for the potential TikTok ban, and what platforms or strategies are you exploring? If anyone‚Äôs been through something similar, I‚Äôd really appreciate any advice you can share!

Thanks in advance, and here‚Äôs hoping we don‚Äôt lose the app that taught us all how to make Dalgona coffee and find cheap flights. ‚úåÔ∏è",0,1737303419.0,VPNTorrents,3,0.25,False

Hi everyone!

I‚Äôve recently started taking my crochet projects out with me‚Äîout with friends, to coffee shops, or even just to the park. It‚Äôs been great to pass the time and relax, but I‚Äôve noticed something that‚Äôs kind of bothering me: my projects get a little dirty when I‚Äôm working on them away from home.

I try to wash my hands before starting, but sometimes it‚Äôs just not possible when I‚Äôm out and about. And let‚Äôs be honest, touching surfaces like tables or my bag probably doesn‚Äôt help.

So, I‚Äôm curious‚Äîdo you have any tips or routines for keeping your hands clean while crocheting? Or do you just embrace the fact that your yarn might pick up some ‚Äúoutside character‚Äù? Do you avoid taking projects out altogether because of this?

I‚Äôd love to hear how you all handle it! Thanks in advance for the advice üòä",0,1737303296.0,crochet,3,0.5,False

Honestly, I don't remember the last time I knew anything. I don't remember when I was able to tell someone that I surely knew I wanted something. 

For example, I went out a few days ago to go shopping for kcup coffee. It wasn't for me, but it was something on the list to pick up. I get to the store and I start looking at plushies. I like plushies, (I think) and I put one in the cart. I didn't need it. But the rest of the time I walked around the store with the plush I debated if I should get it. It wasn't a ""really want but don't need"" it was just, me trying to fill a void at that point. So I bought it, and instantly regretted it, I think. I don't know. Sometimes I stand in a store staring at the same two packets of the exact same meats as I blank out. I lose focus. 

Lately I can't tell what I want anymore because of my depression. Things that I used to want a lot, I hardly want now or don't know if I want now. Every time I buy or get something I want I feel empty. I find myself crying and being sad more often than not. I can't tell when I'm even a bit happy. 

I try to fill a void that seems endless. I have felt hopeless for years and even gave up on myself. I tried therapy, with multiple different therapists and medications with different psychiatrists, but to no avail. I feel seperated from my body, and too aware of my existence to continue going on at times. I'm not going to hurt myself but sometimes it feels like the only way out. I feel utterly useless, worthless and I wish my parents didn't have me. Nobody needs me. Nobody would miss me and I don't want to live a life where I never get better.

I'm afraid I'll never get better and that will break me more. I can't function at 100% anyway, the economy didn't even want to make a decent use of me. I'm just... pointless.

Part of me can't fully answer a question about my feelings anymore. I don't know what I want or need. I just say I want things and then think I don't later. I'm sorry for the rambling. I'm very in my head right now. ",1,1737303267.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False
