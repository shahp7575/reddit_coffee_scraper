Subject: Seeking Career Advice

Hello,

I’m looking for some advice as I navigate my career path. I’m 25 and will graduate in May with a Bachelor of Science in Public Health. Over the past two years, I’ve worked in healthcare as an HR coordinator and home health manager, but I’ve already started to feel burnout and some job insecurity due to working for a smaller company.

To be transparent, I made poor decisions at 22 and have a DWI and a felony charge (not convicted) for an accident involving bodily injury. My concern is that my background might limit my opportunities if I decide to pursue a new job or leave my current position.

I’m considering pursuing an MBA to expand my options and have also thought about starting my own business, like a coffee and breakfast shop, to gain more stability and independence. However, I have no experience in entrepreneurship and don’t know if an MBA would be essential for starting a business.

Does anyone have experience running a similar business or advice on whether an MBA would be helpful? Any guidance would mean a lot as I try to figure out the best way forward.

Thank you for your time,",1,1736741381.0,Felons,0,1.0,False

I seem to be interested in women who have trouble understanding the difference between platonic and romantic interests, and I wonder if it is because I’m bi.

I keep meeting people in public, we hit it off, then they are surprised when they find out the hang out was meant as a date. This last person, I literally said “coffee date.” 

Even before I was out, I would have this problem. I feel kind of trapped by my own affect and sense of self expression… 

Feels like women on paper like bi guys and I’m attracted to queer women too, but in practice a lot of the time they are oblivious because I don’t approach like a toxic hetero guy.

Hey I'm pretty new to the city and would love to have some company to explore the city together and have cute dates.

Some ideas of dates we can do are exploring different areas of the city, visiting coffee shops, watching the sunset from the beach, jogging around the presidio, hiking nearby trails, or staying in for a board game night. The list goes on but those were just a few ideas. I'm kind of a homebody but enjoy staying active and visiting nature.

I have more details about myself and a pic on my profile. Tell me about yourself and include a pic as well.

1i05ls6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i05ls6,"Winter Drive Efficiency, by the numbers ","Hey folks, I've seen a lot of newcomers experiencing their first winter with their R1s worried about efficiency. 
Things that cause/show poor efficiency:
A cold soaked battery
A cold cabin
Short drives
Driving uphill
Deep/slushy/heavy snow

Things that improve efficiency:
Garaging your R1
Longer drives
DC fast charging (warming the battery)
Driving downhill

I am fortunate enough to be able to garage my truck (Gen1, R1T, DMP, Max, AT build) so my winter efficiency isn't too bad. I went for a longer drive today up into the mountains for some fatbiking, and then back down. I covered 122 miles, drove from ~5k ft up to ~9k ft and back down. 
Temps started at ~46°F (in the garage) and we're as low as ~16°F. I drew up a little sheet showing my efficiency for the drive, and how far off my guessometer was. Good news, my guessometer was pretty accurate if not a little conservative. This was about half freeway driving, and half twisty mountain road driving. (See pics)

I have been suffering every single day since September 25 2022. Nothing I've tried has helped. It's only gotten worse and worse. About 6 months ago I lost my ability to even feel anxiety. I am numb, dead, exhausted. I sleep every day until noon or 1p and within a few hours I'm already tired again. Nothing feels like it's my life - all so unfamiliar, gray and numb. No feelings for holidays, seasons, birthdays, I can't feel time at all.

Each day is the same - like I'm living in a Groundhog Day. I can't feel time passing or like I'm in reality like everyone else. I have vivid dreams all night long. I can't feel love, connection, joy, anger, hope, depression or even anxiety - it's just a void of nothing. It's not like I'm feeling dulled emotions. They're completely gone.

Each month that goes by I get worse. More fatigued. Less connection to the world. No connection to self or others. I can't travel, I can't enjoy a mornin cup of coffee, or a good book. I can't have fun dancing with friends or looking forward to a fun trip. All the simple pleasures in life are gone. I just suffer every single day, nothing is real, familiar or has any meaning. I don't even feel fear anymore. Like I'm just a block of stone. My whole life's memories and experiences are gone from my mind.

I've had a lot of trauma but I never knew it was this bad. I don't know how I'm even standing still - I'm afraid of death otherwise I probably wouldn't be here. Every moment of the day is suffering. I have music and repeating thoughts in my head 24/7. Can't connect to nature, romantically, sexually, physically. I miss my old self and life so much. It wasn't perfect but I was happy and loved life. Even the hard times were nowhere near this. I feel like I took my life for granted and now I'm in a living hell. Life is utterly pointless like this. I don't have a shred of energy, doing the most simple things is like climbing mt Everest. There's no me; theres no reality. There's no point. I want myself and my life back. I can't do this anymore. It only gets worse and worse. I haven't felt a ""morning"" or ""day"" in nearly 3 years. My mind doesn't register time anymore, like I'm in a black hole ",1,1736741055.0,Dissociation,0,1.0,False

The apartment is most likely in good condition, if nothing has changed since my visit 4 months ago. However, I prefer to settle the deposit on my terms (lease says deposit refund within 7 days). I usually settle it on the spot when I collect the keys. I think that maybe the tenant contributed to some damage and wants to save himself a few hundred $.

1i05ekl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1i05ekl/difficulty_recovering_from_norovirus/,Difficulty Recovering From Norovirus ,"Hey docs! I apologize in advance for the long explanation but I want to provide as many details as I can. I’m 30F. I had the unfortunate pleasure of having two rounds of (presumed) norovirus in a four week window of time. I was never tested but I am a nurse in a senior assisted living facility and we had many residents there test positive for noro, so that’s what leads me to think it was that. 

My first round was back in December. I started throwing up the night of 12/8. I stayed home from work and slept all day 12/9. I also stayed home on 12/10. I had a little more energy to do small tasks at home (laundry, washing dishes, some housecleaning, etc) but still laid pretty low. I returned to work on 12/11 with no problems. I resumed usual activities like going to the gym by 12/12 and was eating like usual by then also. 

Norovirus round 2 hit me last Sunday night, 1/5. In addition to throwing up, I had some loose BMs. GI symptoms stopped by the end of 1/6. I stayed home on the 6th and 7th, with similar activity pattern as during round 1 (slept all day on the 6th; able to do small house chores in between rests on the 7th). I returned to work on the 8th, but round 2 of noro has messed me up bad! As of writing this (1/12), I STILL don’t have my usual appetite back. I’m having to force myself to eat two of three meals a day. I’m not a big early morning eater (I begin work at 6AM so breakfast is EARLY most days), so having to make myself eat breakfast isn’t super abnormal, but I never have to FORCE myself to eat supper. But ever since I was sick the second time, if I went by my appetite, I wouldn’t eat any supper. I’m almost always ready for lunch, but I’m eating less than I usually do. I’m not aiming to lose weight, but I’m going to at this rate if I can’t get my usual appetite back. My coffee intake is also WAY down. Being a nurse, I love my coffee. I can EASILY drink a large Starbucks tumbler of iced coffee before I even leave the house for work in the morning. My tumbler is about 24 ounces. And then I usually have a smaller afternoon coffee (about 16-20 ounces). However, I only recently in the last couple days have gotten up to drinking in the morning from a reusable iced coffee Mason jar that my sister-in-law gave me (it’s about 16 ounces). And I have no afternoon coffee. I barely eat anything during the day between meals. I usually snack two to three times between meals throughout the day. My snacks vary from fruits and veggies to cookies. I always make sure at least one of those snacks is on the healthier side. 

My gut does not feel right. I am farting and belching a lot, which is not my usual. I sometimes have a little belching during an acid reflux flareup, but it’s not my norm. My BMs are not regular. Before round 2 of norovirus, I always had a large formed brown BM every morning shortly after drinking coffee. Now, I am having smaller “pasty brown” BMs throughout the day. My stomach rumbles a ton and feels “uneasy.” 

Being a nurse, I have my suspicions that my microbiome is off. I was going to try an OTC probiotic (Florastor, to be specific) to see if I can get things regulated back to the way they usually are but wanted to ask in this sub to see what the docs had to say. If you made it this far, thank you for reading! I’m hoping to get some answers so I can get back to feeling like my usual self and not have “bubble guts” all th time. Thank you in advance!

In a nutshell, my family and extended family are classic Eastern Europeans when it comes to being punctual and sticking to a schedule. Whenever we go over to their place for dinner, we usually sit around talking over coffee and having appetizers for about 2 hours before dinner is actually served. My parents and extended family have always been this way…they love eating late and nobody has had an issue because that’s how we were raised. Since my husband entered the picture, he has started complaining how my family never serves dinner “on time” and how they “never have a schedule” and how they always “drag their feet.” He constantly tells me these things about my family and I have nicely told my family that they need to “move quicker when it comes to meals when they invite us over.” To me, my family has dramatically improved in their ways….however, my husband does not think they have improved to the extent that he’d like them to improve. He comes from a family where they stick to a tight schedule. They are the opposite of my family in the sense that they basically rush dinner…usually eat super early, and everyone is out the door quickly. Anyway, the last few years, my husband has been making it very obvious that he wants my family to move faster during gatherings…he rolls his eyes, makes comments about how they are too slow and asks me in front of them when we can leave. I almost find it rude in the sense that my family IS trying to make him happy (they aren’t as fast as he wants them to be but they are a lot quicker than before), yet his impatience and frustration with them is extremely obvious! 
Is my husband an impatient jerk or am I overreacting? How do we fix this issue? ",1,1736739889.0,Marriage,2,1.0,False

to leave or not to leave? i have been a partner for almost three years now, starting late high school and now i'm in college. i loved it at first, honestly, i still do on occasion. i love the people to death- ive met one of my favorite friends there. but i feel like im starting to grow up, or grow out of working there, whereas my coworkers and especially SM see starbucks as their life. it's draining.
 i don't even want to go into the issues around the district that affect our store, but sometimes i feel crazy, like am i just overreacting? is every job like this? am i supposed to feel bad every time i call out because i cannot mentally handle that job and customers? each shift is the same routine, cleaning everything and maintaining 2-3 positions at a time. the customers are selfish, needy, and rude. my SM is bipolar and complains when things don't go her way yet she doesn't do anything when problems happen while she's not there. SM and i have also gotten into a few arguments because my car broke down in another city and i couldn't make it to work, i don't do things the way she likes it yet it's more efficient, SM is also just a major back-and-forth kinda person. loves you when you show up but as soon as life gets in the way, 'my priorities need to be rearranged'. 
for context, im a full time college student dealing with mental health issues, caring for a sick family member, and my schooling requires off-site experience. whenever i call off because of my life getting in the way, because its somehow very hectic, i try to cover other people's shifts in return to make it up. 
anyways, im just tired of working in a place where it feels like my coworkers only purpose is working at starbucks. 

TLDR; im tired of stressing out over a cup of coffee when im in college and have my entire future ahead of me. how do i politely quit?",3,1736739858.0,starbucksbaristas,0,1.0,False
1i05726,https://www.reddit.com/r/AusLegal/comments/1i05726/negligence_from_luxury_car_dealership_service/,negligence from luxury car dealership service centre. ,"In 2021, I purchased a brand-new luxury car and was initially very pleased with it. The car performed beautifully, and I had it serviced regularly at the dealership as required. However, in 2024, during a routine major service, I encountered a series of problems that have left me deeply frustrated.

After picking up my car from the service center, just 10 minutes into my drive, the car began losing power, and a warning appeared on the dashboard indicating low oil. I pulled over immediately, but unfortunately, the engine had already seized. I contacted the dealership, and they admitted they had forgotten to add oil to the engine. As a result, my car had to be towed back to the dealership, where they took full responsibility for the mistake and agreed to replace the engine through their insurance.

After nearly six months without my car, I finally got it back. However, the very next day, we broke down again on our way home from a family trip. This time, the dealership had neglected to properly connect something to the battery. Once again, the car had to be towed back, and we were without it for several days while they fixed the error.

Before the engine issue, my car had been in a small collision with an animal, requiring some panel repairs. I sent it to an approved luxury car repair shop for the panel work, which was then sent to the dealership for electrical work. After receiving the car back, I immediately noticed that the buttons controlling the electric handbrake and switching between driving modes (Eco Pro to Sport) no longer worked. Additionally, the side mirrors, which had previously folded in automatically, stopped functioning. I contacted the panel shop, and they advised me to book it back through insurance to have the dealership service center check it out.

To my dismay, I was later told that the issue was caused by coffee spills, and I would have to pay thousands of dollars to fix it. This is completely false, as I do not drink coffee, and everything was working fine before the car was sent to the panel shop and dealership.

We are extremely dissatisfied with the ongoing issues with this luxury dealership. Despite our patience, we feel that our car is no longer the same as it was before the engine seizure. Each new problem seems to be a continuation of the previous one. When the engine failed, we asked if there was an option to be paid out, but we were told no.

At this point, we are wondering if we have any grounds to file a complaint with Fair Trading or a similar authority, as we are no longer comfortable driving the car, fearing the next breakdown.

1i05706,https://www.reddit.com/r/god/comments/1i05706/temptation_of_lust/,Temptation of Lust,"Story time.

I stepped into a church for the first time in almost 2 decades.
The reason being is of the guilt I felt after I failed a commitment to myself and Jesus' word.
I was raised a Baptist Christian, but began to hang with the wrong crowd and strayed far away from the lord and soon convinced myself I was atheist.
Up until I moved to nashville with a girl that I thought would be the one, only to later realize she was there to reawaken me and bring me back to him, (Relationship went real south). Something happened to me after being with her that opened my eyes back up to spirituality and that the lord wants me to worship him and not the lust of a woman. I say it this way because looking back I realized I did not truly love this girl, I only lusted for her.
Since that breakup I stayed single for 5 years, without sex or hookups.
It changed my whole demeanor, and how I percieve woman as creatures of lust. I look at women way differently now. 
Don't get me wrong I still lust for a woman but no where near what I use to. Yes I still ""look.""
Over the 5 years I really began focusing on myself and trying to bring myself closer to the lord, with prayer and commitment. I wasn't in the slightest worried about getting intimate or dating a woman. And it began to be a piece of cake not caring about finding someone until the lord brought her to me.
I even had plenty of Retension streaks, to abstain from porn and all the benefits rentension brings.
Don't get me wrong I still failed here and there but I kept trying. I'm way better about it now.

But....

A week ago a coworker of mine introduced me to a girl around my age that she knew, (which is hard to find in the college town I live near). In my mind I wasn't sure if this was gods work or...my coworkers work. If that makes sense. But it had been 5 years so I figured I'd give it a go. I'm a major homebody and don't get out much to potentially have an interaction that could lead to something. And also because like I said I wasn't worried about meeting anyone until God was ready for me to, so I figured this was maybe a signal. Because God cannot bring the woman to my front doorstep if I'm at the house all the time haha. Anyways.
We texted for a few days before figuring out a time to hang out and meet for the first time.
She had tried to meet with me a couple times before this interaction but I've been sick and didn't want to make a bad first impression. She asked everyday. I've never had a girl eager to meet me like this, so I was excited but also still sick and hated having to tell her to wait until I felt better and looked better. But by the 3rd time she asked me, she said she felt like she was having to beg me and annoy me. I reassured her that defiantly wasn't the case. And I ended up  saying let's get coffee tomorrow. Despite me not feeling 100%. But she took it as another day of blowing off. She said she was going downtown with friends that night and I'm more than welcome to join if I'm really interested. So I told her okay. Got dressed up and drove to her place where we met for the first time before going downtown. Her vibe was cool but a little ""dark"" , i could feel it. But of course I ignored it and played it cool, hoping my feeling was wrong. She was already pregaming before I got there with her friend. I'm not much of a drinker at all but I enjoyed a little wine before we left.
Once we left the house, we all took her car, and jammed to music on the way there....ratchet music of course( which i really can't stand ) but I wasn't going to tell her to turn it off. Red flag 1. She was pretty tipsy at this point and we only just met.
Once we got to the bar, we all got a redbull vodka and hung out till other friends showed up.
At this point she was kinda giving masculine energy (like hood, don't fwm vibes) and playfully yelling alot between her and her friend, I guess her way of having fun.
I brushed it off because she was giving me attention, which again I have not received in quite a while. And I understand that women can get like that sometimes when they are with their besties. But hers was defiantly a little aggressive( bitch this. Bitch that, fuck you, laughing, cutting up)
Once we heard the friends were at another bar we finished out drinks and began walking to the next bar. As we round the corner, I'm guessing she assumed someone was mocking her loudness and silliness and she took offense and starting yelling slurs from across the street, then her friend joined in and I had to step in a say, no no no we are not doing this and had to usher them away, all while they both were still yelling slurs, (Red flag 2). I yelled an apology to the other folks thet were yelling because I honestly didn't hear them mock her. She was yelled things like bitch I been to jail I don't play. I was already pretty hesitant at this point but kept going because of the attention and lack of being social. Plus she was pretty and....lust. She's a skinny white girl btw. 
After we got to the second bar and met with friends, I grabbed a beer, which would be my last drink because I hate not being aware in public. And of course they're doing shots and more drinking. At one point her and her friend left to go get molli and wanted me to watch their drinks. (Red flag 3).
She was taking a long time so I called her to see if she was alright. She didn't pick up but called right back and said they are almost back.
Once they got back they popped them. I did not. And that's when the open sexualness started to come out. Typical girl friends slapping and grabbed each other's butt's, calling each other fine af ect.
We ended up staying at that bar until 2am, playing pool and having a good time I guess. I was still pretty close to sober. She eventually was to faded to play pool so ended up 1 v 2 the table. I won 😏. Don't know where she got off to while I was finishing up the game.
Anyways, last call happened and she grabbed 1 more drink with her friends. Doing more ratchet drunk girl stuff. I grabbed a water. 

I should also mention before this night I had just started my 75 medium challenge. And had been semen retaining for almost 2 weeks prior.

Her friend ended up with some random guy that came with us back to a someones post house party. I didn't know anyone but this girl I had just met tonight and 1 coworker.
House music was blasting and they had a drum set in the living room. She was going ballistic on them and not in the shes really good at that, way.
Trying to time it all with the beat of the music. This didn't bother me, she was just enjoying herself. And she was pretty messed up. Great first date so far....
By the time we were ready to bounce. It was around 3:30am and her friend was so drunk we couldn't convince her to leave with us because she wanted to stay with the guy she met. Don't worry she knew other girls there. So we ended up leaving her there. And we rode to the friends house that we met up with at the bar, because we left her car downtown at the time. Just Me, my date, my coworker and her bf. Once we got to their place we all crashed on the couch, she wasnt being very outrageous at this point, and we all played trivia till just about 7am, me her were cuddled up the whole time.
Once we called it at 7am, everyone went to bed, and cuddled till we fell asleep. I could tell she would not have cared at all if I tried to make a move. But I was exhausted so I didn't, even though lust wanted me to.
By the time we woke up it was 10am, the others were still asleep. I had accidently woke her when I leaned up to get a drink of water from my cup. And I laid back down, trying to maybe get some more sleep. I end up getting closer to her to cuddle. She backed into me to closer. I softly scratched her back while we tried to maybe fall asleep again. But that's when things started to heat up, and I began to get hesitant but intrigued. She was allowing me to move my hands to different ""spots"". She lifting her shirt up some allowing me to well..yeah. anyways sorry about the details. It got down to it where we were both pretty well about to get giggy. I also forgot to mention she knew I was retaining because I showed her my 75 challenge I made.
Lust was taking over me and tunnel vision pretty much took over and I succumbed. Here and there telling her I really didn't want to without protection. I had forgotten my Retension at this point because the moment was happening that I hadn't had in a long while.
But she kept being eager. So it happened....
I unfortunately and embarrassingly didn't last long because of my 5 year abstain and my 2 week Retension. She didn't seem bother by it after the fact that I reminded her of those things.

I will also say sorry if this doesn't sit well with some but I never got the covid shot or was ever tested. And that was also a reason why I was abstaining because i didn't trust having sex with someone with got the shot. But that's a very hard topic to bring up  on a first date. But I ended up asked her if she did after the fact and she had gotten 1 when they first came out. I felt shot in the chest. Low key starting to freak out. I'm not sure if the question bothered her but it seemed like it didn't because she invited me to go to the gym with after we all got home.
Still at the friends house, I hoped in the shower right after hearing her answer. Not that it would do anything but I was freaking out a little like I said.
Once my coworkers bf drove us to her car, we had to go pick up her drunk friend from dudes house. She was very mellow and chill at this point. That's why I'm still unsure if the question truly bothered her. But anyways.
As we are driving home with her and her friend, we kept passing so many Baptist churches, I mean one after the other. All Baptist. I started to feel a certain way about my decision at this point about the whole night in general and my mistakes. I had an overwhelming urge to go into the church and pray or talk to a pastor for the first time in decades. And not as a ""quick cleanse"", I genuinely felt like I had failed Jesus word and mine to myself.
Soon as we got back to her place she lit up a bong, and said I'm about to bounce I need to check on my pets and brush my teeth. She had mentioned again to hit her up if I wanted to go to the gym with her later.
I saw cars in one of the Baptist church parking lot so I thought I could still make it to talk to someone before they all left. It was 12:11 in the afternoon at this point and unfortunately I was just to later because by the time I returned there were no cars in the lot. So I turned around and went the other to a church that I had seen still had cars in front of it. It was not a Baptist church it was a small Apostolic church. I had no idea what that was but I really wanted to repent my sins because I felt terrible for what I'd done. And it was the only church that still had folks and a pastor inside. Once I pulled in a woman came outside kind of hesitant, and I told her my problem and what I was there for, she brought the pastor out and I told him the same thing and that i hadnt been to a chruch in almost 2 decades, I was becoming pretty emotional at this point, verge of small tears. They told me to please come inside so that we may all pray for you. We all joined hands inside and everyone started talking out loud in their own prayers. It was so powerful, i cannot describe the feelings i was having. I couldn't speak, only tear up. It went for a couple mins. When they finished I wasn't sure what I was feeling but it felt amazing to be around people who were so into the word of God, the bible, Jesus and who genuinely felt the need to want to help me and just being in the house of god. We chatted for a bit and i told them some stuff about myself. Still trying to recover from all the emotions at the same time.

They ended up inviting me to go to the lunch with them as they were about to head out and go eat anyways, and of course cracked up and said, ""I haven't even gotten a chance to brush my teeth yet"" we all got a laugh out of it. We headed to lunch and discussed many more things. I felt like I was in school again, because they had so many  answer to my questions about God and Jesus and guilt and repenting and sin. Plus they all had eyes of genuine souls, especially the pastor. It was almost a glow in his eyes when he looked directly into mine.
We finished up and exchanged info and I will be talking more with the pastor from here on.

Moral of this story, I just not sure if the guilt I'm feeling is from breaking my commitment to God to allowing him to bring someone to me that was for me, or if I feel guilty for breaking a code to myself for sleeping with someone who got the shot. Or if I'm feeling guilty of not being a stronger person after preparing for 5 years for an incident like this.
I don't know what I'm suppose to think right now. Im a serious empath and very kind hearted. So having to tell her that I don't think it'll work isn't going to be easy for me.

I let lust take over me and I just never wanted to disappoint Jesus. I'm also upset with myself that I let lust win enough to sleep with someone who got the shot. And that's why I'm torn on what am I really feeling guilty of. I do know it's for both reasons though. Felt broken. I plan to go as long as it takes to wait for god to bring me the right girl. I will not fail again. I just hope i have the will power to overcome lust when i finally do meet her and love her for who she is and why she was brought to me.If you want more details let me know, I may have missed some things.

I'm new to composting. I did my first batch over this past summer and it went well, I kept my Green/Brown ratio pretty even, it was hitting that 140-160**°**F, and even got the PH level I was needing, I hope the blue berries enjoy it.

I started this pile in mid to late October, it was just a 50/50 mix of lawn clippings and dry chopped up leaf's, it's about 6 feet wide and 3 feet tall. It was hitting those high temps, and I was regularly adding kitchen scraps and trying to maintain that 50/50ish ratio, and turning it. Just before new years I added some sliced oranges in with everything else. I came back a little under a week late to check on it, and I noticed some things were off. First I noticed mole tunnels surrounding the area, and the pile was no longer ""pointed"" at the top, the temp had dropped to below 50, and the orange slice in the middle had been clearly eaten and only the peels remain (can't blame the little critter i don't eat that part either). I know mole's don't typically eat fruits/veggies since they're insectivores, but that's the only thing I think it could be, as they're very common around here and I even found one in the last batch.

I quickly moved the pile to another location as I knew snow was coming, and figured the moles were just gonna keep coming back to eat. I ran around the city getting used coffee grounds from Starbucks, I managed to get about 10 gallons of coffee grounds. I balanced this out with a log that was rotting, I chopped it up and managed to get just a little under 10 gallons of wood shavings/dust to balance out the grounds. I layered everything and mixed. It's been a while now and I can't seem to get the temps to rise back above 40**°**F

Doe's anyone have any recommendations for how to get the temp back up and reactivate it? I know it's okay to leave it till it thaws, but I'm trying to challenge myself and get that going before hand. Any advice helps :)

You? Just be cool. I don’t have stipulations other than you at least try to have convo. I want to be seen and heard and I want someone I lol forward to talking to.

The Cabinet Room was quiet. The President’s speech had finished a few moments ago. The room was full to the brim with members of Congress, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the rest of the cabinet. Extra chairs were brought in, but there was not enough room, so people had to stand. The TV was set to MSNBC, and videos from all over the US were being shown. The damage and destruction were on full display.

The door opened and the President walked in. Everyone in the room stands out of respect. Seth takes a moment to scan the room to ensure everyone is here to start the meeting. “Hello everyone, please sit down everyone, let's cut to the chase” After greeting the men and women, they all sit back down. “We are in a dire situation people, please change the screen” Seth orders an aide to switch the TV to a different channel to begin.

“General, I think it would be best for you to begin,” Seth says, gesturing to a General named Charlie A. Jefferson. “You may begin when you're ready”

The general gives a little nod and stands next to the TV. “Thank You, sir. Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like you all to take a look at these photos. Before I show them I want to make it clear that at this moment, these are Classified. The Photos shown to the public will be very different from the ones shown here. Lights please.” another aide turns off the lights and hits a button for the window blackout shutters to close. The sudden darkness takes people's eyes a minute to adjust.

“First I want to discuss protecting our maritime borders, including the addition of Canada, Mexico, Central America, and so on. It has grown significantly. For this, I suggest creating one massive border that goes 30 miles from shore and loops around like an oval.” He changed the screen to a photo of the new maritime border and an outline appears of the suggestion.

“Now to be able to achieve such a feat in protecting this border, both the Coast Guard and Navy will need much more additional resources. Such as ships, personnel, supplies, fuel, intel, and more. The problem is in preparation for The Storm, most of our Naval assets were docked or moved closer in together to protect them. Mainly the ones that are difficult to replace.” He pauses for a short second so people can understand.

The General changes the picture again “As we speak more and more video evidence shows something came down from the sun and struck the Earth in lines, very specific and precise lines. All ships on said lines are now heavily damaged or sunk. And the ones near it to heat damage.” He changed the image on the screen to several photos and videos of ships severely damaged or now sunk. Some snapped in two, glowing a hot purple color. One of the ships now in two was an aircraft carrier, “Thankfully the only sunk Aircraft Carrier in our fleet was this one here” The picture changes to a closer picture. “The USS Carl Vinson”. The carrier is completely in two. “This carrier is beyond repair and will be used for spare parts.”

The members in the room chatter amongst themselves over the news of the ships. The General waited patiently before continuing to speak. “Now, the good news is that the ships we need to patrol our new border are still afloat, the problem is that it is going to take time to repair them. Especially depending on the damage done.”

“Now on to the two landmasses the President discussed in his speech” The picture changes to a detailed map of the new planet.

Seth gives a subtle cough to chime in, “General, I would like to take it here for a second if that's alright.”

“Yes Sir, Mister President” The General takes his seat.

“Now I want all of you to look at this map. Does it look familiar to anyone?” Seth asks the men and Women in the room. He lets that question hang in the air, some confused at this map, some studying it.

If you have been practically living under a rock for the last 10 or so years, or just haven't watched any major TV show then you wouldn’t understand. But Seth knows that some of them must know what he's referring to. The room remains silent as the occupants study the map.

He inconspicuously looks at each one of their faces, then he sees it. On the House Minority Leader of the Bull-Moose Party's face. Liz Cheney. He watches as she quickly connects the dots in her head. She looks at him, then back to the screen, back at him “Mister President, is that what I think that is?” She asks. Everyone in the room looks at her, then him.

Seth gives a little chuckle “Glad to know I’m not the only one seeing it, I thought I was going a little crazy. Anyone else want to take a crack at it?” Everyone stays silent, some shake their heads. “Alright, General next slide please.”

The picture changes to a map. But this one is much more detailed, with wording and landmarks. The two continents are named “Westeros” and “Essos”. And at the bottom “The world of “A Song of Ice and Fire” and “Game Of Thrones "" in an old writing font. Now everyone is understanding what this world is, everyone connecting the dots, and many “Oohhhhh” coming from a few.

“Now do all of you see it?” Seth asks, looking around the room.

The general continues his presentation, “The images are almost identical, some bits and pieces of detail are off. But other than that, the same.”

“So what does this mean? Are we stuck here?” Ted Cruz, Senate Minority Leader asked in confusion.

Looking over to the senate leader, “At the moment. We do not know. But the good news is that we know where we are. Planetos, from Game Of Thrones.” The General answered the leader's question, as well hoping to calm people's nerves.

Just hearing it aloud is quite a shock to most, just the idea of a fictional story being a reality is amazing in itself. The Congress leaders begin to discuss the steps to get ahead of the panic that will most likely start when news gets out. The idea of a new government budget gets thrown around. Increasing military spending, where the money will come from, increasing taxes, which federal programs need more money and ones that need to be put on hold. What about the foreign trade that will no longer be coming in, what about those resources?

Religion was another thing that was brought up. What do you do with the highly religious people in the country? How do you keep them calm and not go insane? No Pope, no Mecca, no Jerusalem. Important places for these major religions are all gone. All these foundations were just uprooted overnight.

The Cabinet Room gets louder and louder as people try to speak over one another, ideas left and right. “Lower Taxes” “Raise Taxes” and “Military control” The words “Martial Law” were thrown around a few times. Just everyone getting louder.

“Everyone, please! We must go through this rationally. We will get through this” Seth, now standing trying to calm everyone down.

“How do you expect the public to react? You already told them they were no longer on Earth! Now how do you think they're going to react when they find out that we are on a goddamn fantasy planet. This is insane!” Miss Greene spurts out in her crazy tone that she usually saves for the media. “I guess the stress is getting to her now.” Seth thinks, looking at the congresswoman.

“For now, Congresswoman.” Giving her a look before scanning the room. “We tell the public one thing, the truth. We can’t have speculation and fear take over.”

The news breaks, 3:20 pm, 6 hours later

Americans all over the country are still trying to get over the President's speech. Places of worship from the big cities to small towns are being flocked to. Looking for comfort in the fact their lives have been forever changed. Speculation and conspiracies are rampant as very little information besides the speech is released. Like a slowly dripping faucet.

The news media at the moment is documenting the damage and destruction from The Storm. Social Media is still up and running as young citizens try to find comfort in cyberspace. Each documents their experience, feelings, and next course of action in a search for some form of normalcy.

NASA has been given the go-ahead to give updates on the ISS and its Crew. The country sighs relief in knowing that the astronauts are safe and sound. Along with this, the info as to what happened to the Russian cosmonauts is also released, along with the video.

More and more reports of people vanishing out of thin air during The Storm make big news. Footage from bunker sites all over the country is shown to the public of men, women, and children turning into light and vanishing before people's eyes. Just like the Cosmonauts. The videos are practically identical. Before The Storm everyone is calm and prepared, then The Storm hits followed by shaking then the light, and they vanish.

**CNN**: “The US government at this time has no comment as to why these people simply vanished. But they say that they are looking into it.”

**MSNBC**: “The official government website now says for everyone to have at least enough food and water for you and your family. Instructions have been posted on how to extend them in case of emergency.”

**Fox News**: “Now the government is saying we need to be on a “Work from Home” schedule to save gas and diesel. I mean come on! The damage to the economy alone is going to be chaos. What we should be doing is mandating more people to work, more people in factories producing everything we need. Not being a bunch of wimps and hiding at home. I bet this would have never happened if the Republicans never lost the election.”

**ABC News**: “We are getting numerous reports of power outages across the country. Law enforcement in some areas stated that whole power grids for isolated areas are completely fried. Seattle, Washington State is reported to almost be completely out of power as lines are down, neighboring states of Oregon and Idaho have said that they will send in supplies and trucks to help with the damages as they are not too badly damaged. We will have more shortly”

**CBS News**: “So far the following states have opened up their bunkers 6-month supplies to the public at rationing: Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Maine, Utah, Kansas, Alabama, South Carolina, and Arizona. More are expected to follow. The Department of Transportation has been ordered to organize a nationwide “Bus Shuttle” system for businesses to save gas from civilian cars.

As news outlets are relaying what is happening around the country, more information about this strange planet is released.

“Welcome back, My name is Wolf Blitzer with CNN and we have Breaking News. The US Government has just released its information of this world we have been, frankly transported to.” The Anchor turns to a TV screen next to him, it goes from the CNN logo to a map. “And as you can see here, almost the entirety of North America is here with us, just as the President said in his speech earlier this morning. And here.” The Anchor zooms out more for the full image, “This is the complete map we have now. And as you can. See. here.” He stops speaking and studies the map.

“Uh. Uh hmm. Sorry folks, I think someone gave us the wrong ma-” Before he finishes, he presses on the earpiece and listens. “It’s what?” “Are you sure?” “This isn’t a joke right?” “Oh.” The anchor turns back to the camera, bewilderment on his face. “Well uh, folks. This is, I guess, exactly what it looks like. If you have watched the hit show “Game of Thrones” then you will recognize this land mass here.” He circles and points to the closest landmass, “My producer is saying this isn't a joke, but this is Westeros. Yes, that one.” Looking over to the side of someone away from the camera. “Are you sure this is what the government released?”

More and more information is released. The information seems fake at first like someone screwed up and gave the wrong file to someone. Or an office prank? But no, this is legit. The media goes into a frenzy with this information, the theories become wilder and wilder. Social Media is having an absolute field day as well, LARPing is trending on Twitter. So many questions that don’t have answers are being asked on every corner of the internet. But one common question is being asked: “Where is George R. R. Martin?”

Reports on Social Media in New Jersey of helicopters flying overhead, like a swarm of bees in search of flowers. The speculation has been narrowed down to one thing. They're going to get George R.R. Martin.

4:45 pm, Rural New Jersey, Home of GRRM

Rural New Jersey, far from major cities and the hustle and bustle of civilization. Home to big, cheap plots of land. One such plot is homed to the famed writer George R.R. Martin, bought before The Storm. At least that's what the file says.

Sitting in the Blackhawk helicopter, a soldier turns the final page of the personnel file and hands it back to the front. A group of 5 helicopters, four of which are Blackhawks. The first one is a civilian model. They have orders to bring the writer to D.C. by any means necessary. No contact with the writer has been established, the phones ringing but no one's answering. He was last seen with his wife arriving at his home, a 25-acre plot of land from the closest bunker.

“3 Minutes from landing! Look alive!” The pilot reports to the soldiers.

Looking out the window, they approach a massive home. Looking like a 4-5 room size maybe more. The helicopter flies around it twice to get a lay of the land. The civilian helicopter lands 25 yards from the door, then the first Blackhawk helicopter 15 yards from the civilian.

“Alright, everyone!” A military captain yells to get everyone's attention on the headsets. “We go in, get the writer and his wife then we get the hell out. Got it?”

“Yes Sir!” The other soldiers reply. The sliding door to the helicopter opens and they exit. 10 yards from the front door, an officer and two military MPs stand waiting for the soldiers. The officer gives them a nod of approval and makes his way to the door, the squad of soldiers staying a few paces behind.

*Ding Dong*. The officer presses the doorbell. Nothing. He presses it again. Still nothing.

The officer reaches his hand to the door and knocks, the door creaks open. The hinges, with years of wear and tear, make a scraping noise. Something out of a horror movie. Poking his head in to take a look around. Nothing. Then a small gust of air hits him. It's cold.

“Captain, split your group into two and search the building.” The officer speaks on the radio. Looking back, he watches as the 10 soldiers and their captain make their way to him and through the door.

The first group makes their way up the stairs to the second floor. Searching and going from room to room. Each is either a guest room or a storage room, which is odd for a house this size. The last room is the master bedroom. The door was cracked open, and a smell was coming from it. Foul smelling. A soldier, weapon in hand, pushes the door open with the muzzle of the rifle. What he finds is not a pretty sight.

Mister Martin's wife, Parris McBride, dead. She was slumped on her back in a pool of blood. Her throat was cut to the bone.

Two other soldiers enter, still in defense, and search the room. No one was in it. Searching the room for some kind of entry, footprints, a weapon, something to give evidence of an attacker. But there was nothing.

“Captain, we have a body up here. It's the writer's wife. She's dead. Throat cut.” The soldier who found her reports on the radio.

The radio comes to life, “Shit. Alright stay there, I will be up there in a minute. The second team is about to make it to the study.”

Before continuing his task, the captain looks around the living room. It's a mess, trash thrown about. Torn up magazines, and destroyed dishes. Just a mess. Looking over to the other group, he hands signals to make their way to the study.

They entire a short hallway, and the end had a sign on the door “Study room” hanging by a nail. The captain readies his weapon, “Open it.”

Another soldier, on the right side of the door, slowly turns the handle to open it. The Captain kicks the door open and sweeps the area for any hostels, A soldier enters right after him doing the same. What they find is worse than they could imagine.

Blood. Blood covering the floor, splatters on the walls, almost everything. There's a body, sprawled on the floor. Its lifeless eyes staring at the ceiling glossed over. The Captain walks over and neels a little to examine the corps. On the right side of its chest is a hole. About the size of a silver dollar. Looks down in dismay. “Shit” He takes his hand and closes the eyes of the now-deceased body of their target of extraction. George R.R. Martin. Looking around the room for any signs of a struggle.

The room was ransacked, shelves destroyed, notebooks ripped to pieces, many more clearly missing. The computer that was once on the desk smashed to pieces, unsalvageable. “Command. Come in.” The captain presses down on his radio. He waits for a response.

“Go ahead, captain.” A feminine voice replies, authoritative.

“We are inside the occupancy. We have two bodies, one upstairs and the other in the study, both deceased for some time. No signs of entry. The study is ransacked and destroyed. No sign of forced entry. Not even signs of footprints.” The Captain informs.

“Alright Captain, stay there. Don’t touch anything, we have people on their way to handle and examine the scene”

“Yes ma’am.” Giving one more look around the study.

“God fucking damn it”

**MSNBC**: “We have Breaking News. The famed author, TV writer, and producer George R.R. Martin and his wife, Parris McBride were found dead this afternoon in their New Jersey home at 4:50 pm Eastern time. At this time local and government authorities have not given a cause of death. The government has said they wanted his help to determine their next course of action on “Planetos”. Mister Martin was 77 years old.”

4 days later. October 23rd, 2025 9:00 A.M. EST “Announcement of contact mission”

Upon the report of the death of George R.R. Martin, the US government decided to go ahead with a “First Contact Mission” to the continent named “Westeros”. The details of this Mission so far have been kept from the public as to not add more fuel to the fire. Efforts to help throughout the country have been going ahead of schedule so far. Local and state governments have been coordinating to get people the food and supplies they need.

General Motors, Sellantis, and the Ford Motor Company have been ordered to halt production on new vehicles for the time being and put efforts into parts and equipment the country needs. As well as oil production machinery. This includes the former foreign manufacturers that have major offices in the country such as American Honda Motor, Toyota USA, and Hyundai USA, etc.

So far the search of known Oil deposits in the former Canada and Mexico have been proven successful. But since the original infrastructure is gone, the timeline to get those Oil Refineries up and running has not been determined yet. ExxonMobil, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips have reported that the reservoirs in the two former countries are there, but they need time to find out how much is there. And without the existing infrastructure to be able to extract, the timeframe is uncertain.

The Whitehouse has been a very busy place for the last few days. Even More so since the contact mission announcement. The discussion is to take place in the Oval Office, at the moment chiefs of staff, Cabinet members, and military leaders are waiting for the president to join them. Many start to brainstorm how to move forward.

“If the satellite map is correct, why not just go straight to Kings Landing with a contact fleet?” A woman questions.

“No No. We do not want to give too much away. If we go straight to the capital and say “Hi! We are not from this planet and just stumbled upon this place, also our home is on the other side of the continent.” it will look suspicious” The Secretary of State, Peter Lynch says to her. The bags under his eyes say he hasn't slept well in a few days.

“Good point. So we just play dumb the entire time? What if we’re not at the right time? I mean as to the books. We could be hundreds of years before the originals, or hundreds of years in the future.” The Secretary of Commerce, Abigail Cross, has been trying to attain as much knowledge as she can about this fantasy world. With one of the books by her bedside every night.

Sipping on his cup of black coffee, “Well we won’t know until we meet them first now will we.”

The door to the Oval Office opens, letting the president walk in. Coffee in hand, with a dog at his side. The dog, a blue and white Stafford Bull Terrier, three to four years old named “Eco” usually goes everywhere with his owner. Except for the past few days, hiding under the bed and shivering from The Storm. Now happy and bringing smiles to everyone in the room.

“Sorry everyone, had to make a phone call to a nervous relative,” the President says, making his way to the Resolute Desk. He gestures for Eco to lay on his dog bed at the side of the desk.

“Let me guess. Your cousin in Maine?” a staff member asks, giving a little wave to Eco.

“You are correct. She texted me concerned and I just wanted to reassure her "" he takes a sip of his coffee before continuing ""Shall we get down to business? What do we have so far?”

The members in the room set up the few proposals they have in front of him, some boards with maps and numbers on them. Once they were finished, Admiral James Huber stepped forward to start explaining the first proposal.

“Well sir, the first option is a simple one. We have a small convoy of ships leave Norfolk, cruise down to Lannisport, make contact with whoever is in charge, and start to set up diplomatic talks. Simple trade, to start a relationship. And maybe figure out a way to set up a FOB for a research team. On this satellite image here.” The Admiral points on the board.

Pointing to another location, “We believe this is the heart of the area. Casterly Rock. From the satellite image, it looks as though the entire castle is built into the mountain. And with the estimated it being Twenty-one hundred feet high. Almost as tall as the “Merdeka 118” in Malaysia, Standing at 2,227 feet. With this in mind, it would be best to make sure the convoy reaches the outskirts of Lannisport just as the sun begins to rise. They will most likely have guards watching the sea for ships coming in. We want them to have ample time to report to the High Lord. If they don’t see us first up at Casterly Rock.”

Seth, sipping his coffee and taking this option into account. It's straightforward, simple, and easy to explain. The low point of failure on our part. And if it goes well, start a friendship with the most powerful area of the continent. But, just in case he still wants to hear out the other two options.

Another General takes the lead “The other two choices are the same, but in different areas. Option one is straightforward, the convoy goes down and around what we presume to be “The Summer Sea” and up through “The Step Stones” into “The Narrow Sea” then heads straight for King’s Landing through “Blackwater Bay”. Very straightforward, but with some problems. One. The convoy will be out in the open for everyone to see. Rumors will spread along the continent, starting from what we presume to be Dorne up.”

“Most Likely the areas we travel the lords will get nervous and launch their ships to investigate, and it could get ugly. Two, if let's say nothing like that happens the other problem is just showing up at their capital unannounced and saying we know nothing about their land, and the fact that North America is on the other side and we just show up out of the blue is going to raise concern. Might scare the high lords into thinking we are here to invade, or they might just lock us out. We can’t take that chance.”

He continues with the last board, “Now option two, we go up north to a secluded, unpopulated or low population area. Meet with the locals, set up a Forward Operating Base, gather intel about the area, and go from there. The problem with this option is that you could technically call it an invasion. Which is something we want to avoid being accused of.”

Thinking about the information given, Seth realizes something. Taking another sip of his coffee, “They want to go with option one, makes sense. Important port city. Large enough for boats, well at least one by our standards. An Important family occupies the area. The map has 3 roads leaving Lannisport, so commerce will move “quickly” by Westeros standards. More importantly, they are crucial to the books. Get on their good side so we might be able to steer things, and if we don't like where it is going. We simply “topple the lion’s throne”.”

Putting his coffee down on his desk, Eco gets up and makes a little whimper to him. Looking up with some puppy eyes. Smiling, Seth opens and reaches into a drawer and pulls out a large dog treat. Eco sits and waits. Seth gives him the treat and pats his head, Eco walks back to the bed and lays down, munching on the treat.

Looking back at the men and women in the room. “I like the first option, going to Lannisport is the best course of action. Straight forward, no bullshit. But there's one thing I am concerned about. The High Lord of this area will most likely be a Lannister. The problem is which one.”

“We will be able to handle anything that happens,” the Admiral says, Highly confident. Unsurprisingly, this expedition will probably summon the Admiral into the history books.

Changing the subject to the voyage itself, “How long would it take them to get down there?”

Opening up a manila folder, “About 2 days, maybe less depending on the weather”

Taking another sip of his coffee, “What ships would make up the small convoy?”

The Admiral looks up from the folder. “Well sir, we were thinking about having 5-7 ships in total, I have a list here of the ships we think are best.” The Admiral goes to the coffee table, picks up another stack of files, and hands them out to everyone in the room. “This is the list and information of the naval vessels in mind.”

Seth flips open the thick file and reads off each ship aloud. “The USS Abraham Lincoln, Aircraft Carrier. The USS Makin Island, Amphibious Assault Ship. The USS San Antonio, Amphibious Transport Dock. The USS Savannah, Friget. The USS Arleigh Burke, Destroyer. The USS Virginia, Submarine.”

Looking through the names one last time then looking at the admiral. “Um. Don’t you think this is a bit much? I mean, this is basically a Carrier Strike Group.”

Understanding the President's concerns, “Well Sir, since this is a Medieval Fantasy world. And reading up on the book series. The possibility of Krakens, Leviathans, and course Dragons. It would be better to be over-prepared than under.” the Admiral, hoping that answers the President's question.

Closing the file on his desk, “Alright, you make a good point. In that case, I want a vessel from Project Analog added as well.”

“Sir?” The General to the side looks from the Admiral, then to the President.

“Is there a problem?” Asking both the General and Admiral.

“No Sir, there's no problem. Just, why?” The Admiral questions as politely as possible.

“I figured if we spend all that money on those old ships we might as well use one. Which ones have been fully refitted?”

The Secretary of State chimes in, “I have that file here Sir”. Grabbing said file and making his way to the Desk. Opening the file to read off the list, “Of the 43 Navy Vessels originally selected in November 2023, the ones that were completed just before The Storm are; USS Texas, USS Wisconsin, USS Missouri, USS Lexington, USS Gettysburg, USS Oak Hill, and the USS Whidbey Island”

Seth ponders the options and takes another sip of his coffee. “Let’s go with the USS Missouri, if I remember correctly she was the first one completed right?”

“Yes sir, she is in the Norfolk Naval Shipyard as we speak.”

“Good, I want her to be part of that convoy.” Now that is done, Seths looks over to the Secretary of State “What about the ambassador to meet them? Any suggestions Peter?”

Peter, giving a little chuckle “Actually Sir, I know just who. I highly suggest Kelly O’Conner. With her work with the peace between Russia and Ukraine, I think she would be perfect. Plus she loves the books”

“That’s good to hear. Call her up and give her the offer” the President says standing up. Seth raises his voice a little for everyone to listen to what he has to say. “The First Contact Convoy leaves Friday, next week on Halloween.”

2 Hours later, 11:30 A.M

*Ring, Ring*

**Other line**: Hello?

**Peter Lynch**: Kelly O’Conner? It’s Peter. Peter Lynch

**Kelly**: Oh Hey Peter! How are you? Busy?

**Peter**: Yes, it’s been very busy here at the moment. Look, I was wondering if I could ask you something. Got a minute? It’s business.

**Kelly**: Uh. Yeah sure, hold on. (Hey Honey! Could you watch Sammy for a moment!)

Male background voice: (Sure! Who is it?)

Kelly whispering: (It is Peter Lynch, the Secretary of State)

Male voice: (I thought they were not gonna call you again? I thought Ukraine was your last one?)

Kelly: (Shhhh. I know. I know. It will only be a second)

There's a moment of silence before she comes back to the phone.

**Kelly**: What can I do for you, Peter?

**Peter**: I presume you’ve watched the news?

**Kelly**: Of course.

**Peter**: So you can imagine that we will need an Ambassador.

**Kelly**: Ok. And?

**Peter**: Well. We would like the Ambassador to be you. The President is up for it. I already brought it up with him earlier.

**Kelly**: …

**Peter**: …

**Peter**: Well? What do you think? Think you’re up for it?

**Kelly**: What do I think? You want me to go to a fantasy continent and open up talks and a relationship with said continent. Meet the people there. And possibly break every worldview of said people with just our mere presence. And for what? Trade? Information? An alliance? Land? Food? Gold? Oil?

**Peter**: Pretty much. Yeah.

**Kelly**: …

**Kelly**: Give me a sec. Let me call you right back.

The audio of the phone being hung up comes through. Leaving Peter in his office alone to sit in silence

An hour goes by before the phone rings again. 12:30 pm

**Peter**: Hello?

**Kelly**: Peter? I have an answer. I just need one thing from you. Can you promise me that I will get home safely? I won't leave my girls to live without their mother.

**Peter**: You will be guarded by the bes-

**Kelly**: I need you to promise.

**Peter**: We will move heaven and earth to bring you home safely. If anything bad seems to happen, we will get you home. I promise.

**Kelly**: Alright. Send me the details. Bye.

**Peter**: We will. Bye.

1i04xpl,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Gloomy_Music_7907/comments/1i04xpl/today/,Today,"I don’t think today will be a good metric for the start of new routines. I spent the entire day unpacking, washing things, putting things away and nagging mister to take care of himself. He didn’t eat enough and he doesn’t feel well. 
It’s hard to convince him that he needs x, y, z. 
It’s also hard finding a balance between gentle reminders and controlling behavior. He is an adult. I’m not his mom. If he doesn’t want to eat, he has that right. I thought a lot today about how to find intimacy with the state of things the way they are now. We just keep missing each other. I worked in the house all day. He started to build something but got sick and slept for the rest of the day. Now I’m in bed because my back is toast. 
Hopefully the start of a new routine will help us meet each other again. I could feel the greeny meanie within me started with her case building and I just had to kind of remind her of the plan. 
Airing out this kind of dirty laundry is only half the step. Now I have to work on it. 

I took a bath and it was glorious. Nine months without a bath… I was really roughin it. 😉
I was so ashamed of my body. I noticed so much gross stuff. I am literally disgusted by my body. Generally, I would punish myself for being this repulsive. But I still followed through with the entirety of my bathtime routine. Yesterday I was so alarmed by the sight of my hideousness that I 
Rushed through the bath. I couldn’t bear the sight of myself. I was really happy today until I looked at myself. Now I feel sad and angry and depressed. I think I may have a long road ahead of myself. I do want to feel better in my skin. But I can only feel that way if I am a certain weight. Otherwise I am in a perpetual state of shock and disbelief by how vile I am. 
Regardless of my depression, I blow dried my hair, trimmed by bangs, tweezed and gave myself a good spray of vanilla. It makes me feel better. I was kind of shocked by how much I had let everything go. 

We ordered groceries. Mister did not order enough protein so I added things to help him. I ordered the kinds of food I ate before I turned into a whale. If my body can manage it, I intend to walk to the pot store tomorrow. Exercise+community time+pot. 😃
While my back hurts very bad, the disc didn’t pop out today. It didn’t pop yesterday either so I am hopeful that whatever has been causing it to slip is not going to be a problem anymore. 

Bedtime is at 9 pm tonight. I want to start some kind of waking routine tomorrow. 
I want to wake up at 6am. I want to take my vitamins. Tidy up whatever mess I made in the bathroom. Make coffee. (Journal?) (makeup?) 
Generally, this would take me to about 7am upon which I would usually start work but I am off tomorrow so instead, I may walk to the library and weed store. Maybe S will be up for a short visit. (Unrelated; I have been thinking about how hard walks are when I am out of shape. When I lived in Lacey? Those walks to the pot shop killllled me in the beginning. But eventually I’d get home in no time and i felt amazing. I feel strongly that I need to work through this bodily pain so I can start running again. I think I need running to help with some of my mental issues. When my body is exhausted it’s harder for my brain to do weird stuff). I do need to at least get my office prepared for work. I don’t know if I like the set up right now. It just kind of feels like a girly storage space. Art supplies and art are scattered everywhere. My rainbow rug is a lot more dirty than I remember. Evidently, I like rocks a lot. lol. I am undecided about photos of my daughter. I have decided to not hang my mother’s art. I really want to let go of yearning in all forms and my mother was the biggest yearner I’ve ever met (aside from myself). I also find that seeing belongings of my loved ones just causes a lot of unnecessary yearning. And like I said, I’m trying to do away with that. 
It doesn’t seem like a sane thing to do. 

I can’t believe I let myself get so far again. 
The rage that I feel at myself is crippling right now. I want to be like the Portland Fupa ladies who wear crop tops and high waisted jeans while their fupas and muffin tops spill everywhere. I think they look sexy and pretty and womanly. I don’t know why I am repulsed by my own figure when it is full. I hate how large my breasts are. I hate my butt- even though mister seems to be enjoying its size right now lol. He never ceases to whistle or say something when I bend over and for some reason I like that. It’s a small step towards bringing more intimacy in our lives. I ought to tell him that I enjoy that. I’m certain he would never know because I feel so cold lately. 

I think this is why I have to start doing things like waking up early enough to brush my hair and do my makeup. I’ve been really scrubby lately and it impacts how I feel about myself a great deal. 
I hope to crochet a little too.

So yeah. Big day tomorrow. 
Weird how tomorrow begins the night before. ",1,1736738970.0,u_Gloomy_Music_7907,0,1.0,False

We’d like to do the following and are looking for suggestions. *We’ll do Deception Pass & other sights the next few days. 

Friday 5/30

Quick bite & coffee after leaving the airport without going fully into Seattle. 

Stop along the way. Woodinville maybe? 

1 winery (we like cabs, petite verdot, syrah & pinot noir, savignon blanc)

1 brewery with food (me: sours, IPA & hubs: lager, doppelbock, Hefeweizen)

We plan to stop at Woodinville Whiskey. 

If you have any suggestions on where to eat in Anacortes, I’ll take those too! Thanks! ",1,1736738962.0,Seattle,9,0.56,False
1i04xlq,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1i04xlq/ro_winter_of_contentment/,[RO] Winter of Contentment,"For many, it is a time of levity: enjoying the company of your closest companions. For others, it brings intense anxiety: preparing to entertain and feed those who may or may not be invited to your home. The season can be beautiful, almost ethereal. The soft snow contributes to a bright environment. The air is crisp, silent, and still. It can bring serenity, but for Cara, it brings turmoil. Her environment is dark and isolated. The silence can be deafening. The air is unsettling and harshly cold.

For the last year, Cara has sat in silence, alone. This time last year, she and Drew enjoyed the music, the atmosphere, the merriment. They spent the week decorating and laughing. Their small cabin was filled with music and the smell of freshly cooked food. They would make a schedule of who would cook: Cara started the week and Drew would cook every other day. It was always a surprise and could be anything. At night, she scoured the internet looking for unique dishes. 

Cara looked over at Drew in bed, as she smiled at the thought of spending the week with just the two of them. He was always lying on his side, scrolling on his phone. He loved that phone. However, when she touched his shoulder, he knew that it was time to shut it down. The bed seemed so small, so quaint. At the end of the night, they slept in close proximity. Cara would see the snow falling just before going to bed and felt a sense of gratitude. Many people in the world did not have the privilege of developing and sustaining a long-term relationship.

The next morning, Cara had planned a grand breakfast: eggs, crêpes with lemon crème, and sausage. Pulling out her juicer, she made fresh orange juice for herself. Unbeknownst to Drew, Cara had bought a coffee grinder and his favorite blend of coffee. As the grinder turned on, she winced at the noise, startled by its volume. She was really hoping to truly surprise Drew but knew the appliance had spoiled the moment.

Drew came out of the bedroom, half-asleep. His pajama pants were scrunched, and his hair was messy. As he scratched his bare chest, he sat on the couch in silence, putting his phone by his side. She cheerfully greeted him, anticipating a welcome retort. Silence. He must be trying to wake up, she thought. It was very early: 7:00 in the morning. As she stood at the kitchen island, she continued to prepare the food, glancing at Drew occasionally. He sat with his back towards her, head in hands. It was unusual from his usual demeanor.

After three years, Cara could tell when something was off. She spoke to him again. Still, there was silence. Drew’s phone buzzed, and he quickly lifted it, stared solemnly, and threw it back on the couch. Something was wrong. She walked up to him and stood in front of him, flour caked on her apron. She sat and placed her hand on his shoulder. He was breathing heavily, head in hands. His shoulders rose and dropped in a sigh. They looked at each other. Something happened. Were her suspicions true? Her face became serious while he glanced away towards his phone. It buzzed again. He grabbed it and stared. She caught a glimpse of the message and the name. An ultrasound. From Sydney.

Her heart sank. She thought that the dark period in their life ended last year. She stood up and walked to the kitchen island, stunned. Cara began to dissociate. It wasn’t possible, and it wasn’t true, not after all they had been through. All that they said to each other about that night. The promises, the denials. The moments of tears and the moments of kisses, hugs. The gifts. The trips. And yet, every night, he was always sleeping on his side, with the phone lighting up his face.

When did it happen? Why? It was all overwhelming. Drew approached her with an explanation. Cara did not have any words that could satisfy her feelings of betrayal. Looking down at her hand, she stared at the beautiful ring that was presented to her in this cabin two months ago. With a single tear, she slowly pushed his breakfast towards him and pulled the ring off of her finger. Quietly, she retreated to her bedroom, shut the door, and locked it.

As she sat on the edge of the bed, she could hear his excuses, his apologies, and his promises. Never again, he exclaimed. It was a mistake, he cried. His knocks became pounds. Cara unlocked the door and sat on the bed. Drew approached and knelt down. His words were jumbled to her. It was as if they were nonsensical sounds. She couldn’t hear through the anguish. All she could hear were the words “months.” The ultrasound said 20 weeks. Five months.

As he extolled doubts of paternity, tears began to fall steadily. Suddenly, Drew stopped speaking. He knew he needed to leave. As he quietly packed a backpack, she remained stoic. Cara did not eat all day. The bed suddenly felt gigantic and cold. She could not sleep there, knowing it was shared with a traitor. For two weeks, she slept on the couch. He picked up the rest of his things after four weeks. She sold all of their furniture after eight weeks. Family and friends came and went, encouraging her, crying with her, promising to look after her.

It wasn’t until week ten that things began to feel normal. The cabin remained empty until week eleven when she bought a new couch. Weeks twelve and thirteen were emotionally rough. Drew texted a few times, with false promises of change. Week fourteen, she changed her number. By spring, the cabin was complete with new furnishings, representing the next chapter. In autumn, she spent a large amount of time in reflection, sitting outside watching the leaves fall gently, the cool breeze signaling a dreaded anniversary.

Now, she sat in silence once again, thinking about the events of last year. In her journal, she wrote about attempting forgiveness. By now, there was a new family with an infant. They had the privilege of sustaining a long-term relationship. However, for Cara, it was the first day of having the privilege of singleness. Taking a deep breath, she sipped her coffee and turned off the holiday music. She tried to think about the ones that helped her in the last year. It felt impossible to be grateful for anything. 

It’s not going to happen this year, she thought. However, it was the start of a new year. This winter is harsh. But what will spring bring? She would start to know in a week.",1,1736738961.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

1i04x2g,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1i04x2g/aio_for_being_rude_to_my_mum/,AIO for being rude to my mum,"So, here’s the situation. Alex (my partner) and I both moved abroad, but both our parents still live in our home country. We see Alex’s parents maybe once a year. Honestly, I wouldn’t describe my relationship with them as anything more than “barely strangers.”

Over Christmas, we were back and at my parents’ place for the 24th dinner. During a phone call to wish everyone Merry Christmas, Alex’s dad kind of hinted at the idea of getting together for a diner with my parents. It was one of those polite “we should catch up sometime” comments that people say just to be nice, not an actual invitation. My mum, however, decided to take it seriously and organised the dinner herself, even though I strongly suggest her to avoid it (really, I barely have any relationship with Alex's parents and Alex's mother is not exactly my biggest fan. We have never fought. But I've spoken more with the deaf neighbour that lives below my new apartment and I don't speak her language). I knew it’d be awkward, but she didn’t listen (but again, who am I to dictate who my parents can go out woth?).

Anyway, we went back to the country we live in, and they went out for dinner. My mum, who is really theatrical, apparently got really chatty with Alex’s dad, who humoured her. After the dinner, she added Alex’s parents, but expecially his dad, to her “friends” message rotation. This means he now gets the same messages she sends to all her friends (all my aunts and uncles, her high school best friends, her coworkers). It’s very typical “Facebook” 60-year-old mum stuff—nothing ambiguous. Just tons of photos of her dog, the sky, flowers, coffee, and other random things. It'a not flirty. Nor sexual. But it's a lot. Think about a grandma photo dump.

I didn’t even know this was happening until Alex had a call with his parents recently. His mum made several jokes about how much my mum is messaging his dad. And not just once, she’s brought it up repeatedly, like really. A lot. She made a point of repeating the joke everytime I was participating to the call. 

I tried talking to my mum about it, but she doesn’t really listen. She always says “okay, okay,” but then just does her own thing. I’ve added the  translation of the third convo I had with her on the topic in the comments (it’s not originally in English, but I tried to make it as accurate as possible).

Am I overreacting for being annoyed by this whole thing? And being probably an AH to my mum? I feel like I was way too rude in the messages",1,1736738909.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False

Pale hands pluck the darkest beans from ancestral trees
A scrap of ground coffee swirls in the purest milk,
dispersing, weaving, resisting.
A pressure forms beneath the surface, bubbles maneuver towards consciousness.

Emergence.

The first fresh breath of air,
New colours I have seen before
Along with a familiar warmth 
Then the faint memory of a leaf, then a cup.
I find myself observing.

The ceiling, it speaks to me though it says nothing 
I stay listening, waiting.
Nothing.

The walls offer what the ceiling didn't:
Company, truth.
I embrace them,
They encase me,
A perfect casket.

Conversations in silence
They see me.
Every experience reflected back unto me
A scrap, a single drop was all.
For pale hands to label me less than human.

Always a swirl, never a choice.
Either one or the other, and still no one believed me. 
I rejected my skin, I abandoned myself.

My skin melts, rejecting me.
Contrasting tones of flesh
Devoting themselves to the walls,
Metastasising to the walls.

The walls speak truth,
Of this I am certain.
I am not human.
And I am without my skin,
And what am I without my skin

Nothing, the walls echo.

Strange, 
I never noticed

was always 
My own.

It should have been the happiest day of my life. One that should forever be ingrained into my heart and remembered with nothing but fondness. It had been a day I longed for, ever since I was a little girl who had been enamoured by Disney Princess’ and their perfect fairy tale romance.

Nothing could prepare me for what mine turned into.

I intend to explain everything that happened, and to warn other brides-to-be. There is a great evil lurking within the wedding industry, one that is incredibly hard to trace. The best I can do, is recount my experiences of it and make you aware so that you can be spared of the heartache I was forced to endure.

When I met Joe - a chance encounter while at a local restaurant, celebrating my 23rd birthday - I knew that my childhood dream was a step closer to coming true. It was the greatest birthday present I could ever have imagined. I fell in love with him faster than any of my previous partners, and knew he would be the one I would spend the rest of my life with. He was not the most masculine of men, nor the smartest or even the most attractive. He was, as my Dad had often joked, “an ordinary Joe, with a heart of Gold.” One thing led to the other, and, after two years of dating, he proposed.

So began the madness of wedding planning.

Being the youngest and last in the family to get married, I had already seen first-hand the stress in which my three older sisters endured as they prepared for their special days. t was the one thing I was dreading when it would eventually be my turn to tie the knot. All of them ended up having amazing weddings. Yet, as I sought their advice in the initial days after getting engaged, all three of them had said the exact same thing: They would have enjoyed the day more if someone else was coordinating it.

Of all the advice I got, it was that which resonated with me the most. It made me sick to imagine myself looking back on my wedding day and feeling the slightest bit of regret. My mind needed to be free from all the distractions of coordination. If my special day was to be as perfect as I dreamed, I needed to hire a Wedding Coordinator.

Joe was supportive of my decision - nothing unusual there - but not Mum. Being a hard headed woman who, with my Dad, had busted their asses to build the life that me and my Sisters took for granted, she was notorious for her strong opinions on “necessary ways to spend money.” She chided me when I mentioned the idea of hiring a Wedding Coordinator.

Her and Dad had already stressed that they were going to pay for half the wedding, (Joe’s parents, paying for their side) even though Joe and I could well afford to pay on our own. It infuriated me that she would be so angry with me putting a lousy $2000 - the price for a good coordinator - towards my own wedding.

My Sisters were kind enough to argue my case to her. She finally gave in, but under one strict condition that she simply refused to budge for: I could not spend more than $200 on a Wedding Coordinator. If I did, my “wedding gift” from my parents - $100,000, the same that my sisters got, the sum of constant reinvesting ever since we were born - would be withheld for another two years. Help from Joe’s parents didn’t count either. I was to prove that I could withhold from “impulsively splurging my money on something pointless”, before I could receive her very helpful gift. Dad, always the submissive, did not argue.

Joe and I had good savings, but topped with the $100,000, we would be able to purchase our forever home. As much as I despised Mum for what Joe and I agreed was utter stupidity, we could not afford to violate it.

And so I began the dismaying search for a Wedding Coordinator that would fit within the unrealistic price range.

Months passed, and we had managed to book in the Celebrant, venue, photographers, flowers, cars, hair and makeup and had purchased the groomsmen suits, bridesmaid dresses, and even my wedding dress. Yet, the one thing that I wanted above all else, still evaded my grasp. The cheapest wedding coordinator that I had found so far, was $600. The wedding was already going to cost close to $20,000, and I argued  with Mum what an extra $400 was. Out of my own pocket, mind you!

“$400 saved, is $400 gained,” my tight-ass Mother replied. “Think of our gift.”

I resorted to offering a friend, or one of my sisters the role, but Joe convinced me not to bother. My beautiful husband-to-be, wanted all of our guests to enjoy the day, and didn't want the burden of coordinating it to fall on them. He promised me, that if I failed to find one he’d share the burden with me. As he said, “Your sisters, managed, and our wedding is not much different to their's. Why can’t we manage without one too?”

With the day drawing closer and still unable to find a coordinator, I resigned to accepting Joe’s perspective.

That was, until the wedding expo came to my town.

There was only one month to go before the wedding, and everything was already booked and deposits paid for. It was kind of pointless for me to attend the expo, for such events were catered for the newly engaged. The place would be abundant with Wedding Coordinators, all of which I had probably already contacted. But I couldn’t brush aside a rather optimistic thought: What if there was one, just one, that I had not contacted yet? As Dad always said, “You’ll never know unless you try.”

So I went to the expo. I walked through the many isles, brushing shoulders  with the newly engaged, and passed stall after stall of eager merchants keen for a new booking. All up, there were twenty five business’s present that had a Wedding coordinator included in their list of services, and sure enough, I had enquired with all of them.

Dismayed, I left the building and trudged through the car park with slumped shoulders. I had just unlocked my car, when something caught my eye. Parked on the opposite end from where I was, was a glossy purple van. Printed on it’s sides in an elegant script was the words, “Forever Events.”

My heart lurched as hope began to trickle into my veins.

I decided to walk over to it, at least so I could read the smaller writing below the business name. It said, “Jeanie Lilly, Mistress of Coordination, who’ll make your special day last forever.”

Butterflies fluttered in my stomach, driving me into a brisk walk towards that purple van. I halted just close enough to take a clear photo of the contact details written in small font at the bottom.

I had just put my phone back into my pocket when the tailgate began to open. I froze as I watched it rise in slow motion.

Inside, a middle aged woman sat cross legged on a sofa, smiling at me. Her shining raven dark hair was tied back in a tight ponytail. She wore a grey skirt that revealed just enough of her shapely thighs. Beneath her grey blazer, she was topless, the creamy smooth skin of her cleavage drawing my eyes with a magnetic-like force. There was a seductive air about her, and I instantly felt uncomfortable. My mind screamed at me to turn around and return to my car, but my eyes refused to tear themselves free from the bulge of her perfect breasts.

Now I swear on my life, I have always been loyal to Joe, and have always been attracted to Males. But, I’d be lying if I said that I didn’t feel a strange sense of arousal when I first met Jeanie Lilly.

“Eyes up here, sweetheart,” the woman said, blocking my view of her breasts with her hands pointing to her face. I did as she beckoned, with great reluctance, and looked into the most intense eyes I’d ever seen. They were a deep hazel colour, yet I swear there was a sort of golden tinge to them. Combined with her natural long lashes, this woman was far more beautiful than I could ever have have imagined.

“Jeanie Lilly, at your service. And what shall I call this lovely young lady caught gawking at my van?”

I swallowed with a great effort. “Sylvia Paulina.”

“Ah, such a beautiful name for a beautiful lady. So, you’re looking for a Wedding Coordinator are you?” Her voice had the purr of an experienced seductress.

I merely nodded.

“Then you’ve come to the right place, sweetheart. Hop in and take a seat, it’s awfully hot out there and we have a lot to discuss.”

Even though I was a 26 year old woman, I couldn’t help feeling ashamed of myself as I violated one of the most important lessons I was taught as a child, and mindlessly entered the stranger’s van.

As soon as I entered, the tailgate began to shut, and a soothing music filled the cab. Jeanie pulled out two champagne glasses from a small cupboard to her left, and began to fill them both up with what I thought was wine.

She noticed my concern. “It’s rose water, darling, you’ll still be able to drive home, I promise.”

I took the offered glass and took a hesitant sip. Satisfied she was no liar, I drained the glass to soothe my parched throat.

“Wedding organisation sure is some thirsty work isn’t it?” she asked.

""Yes, it is very exhausting,” I replied.

She outstretched an arm so that it was resting along the top of the sofa. Her blazer stretched to the point that I could see the edge of a nipple. She smiled as she began tapping her long, black exquisite nails on the leather. “I can help alleviate a lot of your stress. Tell me, have you got your day sorted yet?”

“Yes, the 23rd of November.”

Jeanie nodded. “One month away. Nice. Shot-gun wedding?”

“No, we’ve been engaged for a year. Everything has already been organised.”

Jeanie tilted her head and a gave a mischievous side smirk. “Except your Wedding day coordinator?”

“Yes, I came to the expo to see if there would be any I hadn’t contacted yet. Mum  placed a strict budget on us getting one, and so far, none have come close with their price. Turns out I've already contacted all the ones that are here today. That is-

“-Until fate brought you to this van!” Jeanie exclaimed. She leaned forward, suddenly becoming a giddy schoolgirl. “OH MY GOD, darling! You have literally just hit the jackpot!”

“Why’s that?” I asked, my mind racing.

She clasped my hands tight between hers and brought her pretty face within inches of mine. “I don’t charge!”

My face twisted into a frown. Such a notion was simply too good to be true. Why in God’s name would someone offer their services without charging for them?

Sensing my confusion, Jeanie pressed on, “I have a bit of a fetish, Sylvia. It is something quite odd, so bear with me.” Her grip tightened on my hands. “Nothing gets me off more, than seeing the makeup smeared all over a brides face as she struggles through the tears of denial that her perfect day has finally come to an end. Cruel, I know, I just can’t help saying it as it is. It is my life’s joy, making girls wedding days as perfect as possible. Guests will dance their heart away, and, without the burden of keeping the schedule, you’ll lose track of the time as you get lost in the euphoria of it all. The party only ends, when the party dies.”

As odd as it all sounded, the passion reverberated from her like a strong air freshener. She clearly meant everything she said.

“But surely, you must seek some sort of payment?” I asked, unable to fathom her mindset.

Jeanie shook her head. “The only payment, is seeing the joy on your face, sweetheart. Euphoria is all I want. Your own, your Husband’s, the bridal party, and all the guests. It is a Euphoria that can only be experienced once in a lifetime, before the party inevitably dies. No amount of money can equate to the empowering feeling of knowing I was the Magician who allowed such positive energy to manifest.”

Stupid me, should have realised just how fucking bizarre this whole ordeal was and got my ass out of that van ASAP. She was clearly using the event, placing her van strategically in a parking lot frequented by Brides-to-be, to attain business without paying for a stand in the exhibition. Jeanie’s questionable business ethics should have reeked of Scam. Hell, I think I was the only girl who had attended the expo, dumb enough to be ensnared.

But after months of disappointment and a deep desire to have the most perfect day ever, my mind was vulnerable to delusion. Despite the odd payment, everything that Jeanie said was exactly what I wanted: A day of Euphoria. So I booked her.

Jeanie was ecstatic and went on to tell me that I would not regret it. She insisted we go through the itinerary sheet while we were together. I had it saved on my phone and opened it up to the plan that I had already made, thinking I was going to be the one to make sure it all happened when it was supposed to.

Jeanie skimmed through it, copying it word for word on a sheet of paper for her own reference. When she finished, she held out the sheet and pointed at the final time-slot: 11.30pm - Festivities end.

“Why so early, sweetheart?” she asked, eyebrows raised.

“Well, it’s an hour drive to the hotel that we are staying in for the night, and our plane leaves for our honeymoon destination at 10am the following day. Thought we’d end it half an hour earlier than most so we could get a good night’s rest.”

Jeanie stared at me for a few moments, her mouth hanging limp. She then burst out laughing. “You’d end a once in a lifetime celebration early, just to be in bed on time!? That’s hilarious!” Her laughter become hysterical and it took a good half minute before she calmed down enough to continue. “Sweetheart, how can the Euphoria possibly manifest if the night is cut so short? Even midnight is farrr too early!”

Wiping away the tears that were forming in her eyes, Jeanie pulled a red pen out of her blazer pocket and crossed out the whole 11.30pm slot. Next to it, she wrote in bold capital letters, The Party ends when the Party dies.

“Where’s your honeymoon destination?”

“Greece-""

“GREECE!” she spat. “Darling, you’ll have nearly a whole 24 hours to rest and recover from your big night! What else do you think you’ll be doing through such a long flight?”

“But-

“Honey, listen to me,” she said, grabbing both my hands again with a gentle firmness. “The Party ends, when the Party dies. If you want to use my services to make your day as unforgettable as it deserves to be, than you must respect that rule. It is utter foolishness to end it any earlier. Euphoria takes time to run it’s course. Trust me, you’ll know exactly when the night’s about to end.”

She handed me my phone back, and told me that there was no need to see her again until the wedding day. She assured me that  she would be in contact with the venue, photographers, Celebrant and MC and have everything nailed down to a tee. Everything would run smoothly, she promised.

When I exited the van, and watched it immediately drive away - the thought not even occurring to me that someone else had been sitting in the drivers seat the whole time -  I was satisfied and already feeling a tinge of the Euphoria that Jeanie was so adamant in bringing to the wedding.

I wish with all my heart that I could go back in time and slap that stupid-bimbo-bride-to-be that I was. I’d scream in her face, demanding her to look up Forever Events on Google, to see that there was absolutely nothing mentioned of it online, not even a fucking advertisement on craigslist! Id tell her to get her shit together and cancel the booking with that Evil Bitch. When she’d inevitably argue, I’d tell her that 200 people were going to die if she did not.

Alas, time machines don’t exist and I  am burdened to live with the consequences for my choices that day. If it’s possible, I hope they would forgive me for what happened to them, for I’ll never be able to grant forgiveness to myself for my stupidity.

When I returned home, I told Mum and Joe about it. I decided to leave out Jeanie’s bizarre form of payment and simply told them that she was happy to offer her Coordination services for our $200 budget. I knew that Joe would have been sceptical if he found out that Jeanie didn’t charge. Mum would have absolutely freaked out, convinced that I was inviting someone who was only there to steal from the wishing well.

As the day drew closer, even I began to question whether I should be relying on Jeanie. No deposit had been made to guarantee that she would even show up. I only had her word to go off. I deemed the chances 50/50, and made preparations to coordinate the day myself, should she not come.

The big day finally arrived. I had awoken at 6am to share a final breakfast as an unmarried woman with Mum and Dad. I deemed this to be a special moment to savour, the calm before the storm you could say. The bridesmaids were scheduled to arrive at 7.30am, followed by hair and makeup commencing at 8am.

I had literally just made my morning coffee and sat at the kitchen table next to my parents, when the doorbell rang.

My heart jolted, for a moment thinking that I had lost track of the time. But when I saw it was only 6.30am, my skin prickled with irritation. Convinced that it was one of the bridesmaids deciding to show up an hour earlier than specified, I stormed to the door. Already, the day’s schedule was compromised.

I threw open the door, and there was Jeanie.

She was dressed in the same grey attire as our first meeting, the only difference being that her hair was out. It shone like polished ebony and reached all the way down to her waist.

“Sylvia!” she exclaimed, before leaning in and kissing me on the cheek. “Are you excited for a day of Euphoria?”

“Yes,” I said as I let her into the house, still processing her sudden presence. Mum was strangely welcoming to her, and Dad was simply enamored.

Jeanie spoke vibrantly, and neither Mum, Dad or myself got much of a word in. Thus was Jeanie’s first crime against me; Intruding on what should have been a sacred hour spent with just my Parents. I would never get that opportunity again.

The Bridesmaids showed up on schedule, filling the house with the babble of excited girls, and still, Jeanie managed to usurp all of the attention. When the Hair and Make-up lady arrived, Jeanie stood in the background, watching me with a mischievous smirk as I was worked on. Her presence seemed to cast the same spell on all of us, that being to see her with awe and to become enthralled to her. I was supposed to be the centre of attention, not her. My Jealousy towards Jeanie only grew, despite myself also being enthralled to her.

When the photographers arrived at 10.30am, I asked Jeanie if she would be going to Joe’s house to check that everything there was running to schedule.

“Sweetheart, all the groom has to to do is put on a suit and wait for you to arrive at the venue,” Jeanie said. “You are the star of the day, therefore, I’ll prioritise my presence being close to you. There's a lot happening here, Sylvia, lots of people to coordinate.”

I didn’t argue with her, and so she remained at my house for the duration of the pre-wedding festivities.

When we left for the venue - wedding ceremony was scheduled for 1pm - Jeanie’s purple van followed close behind us in the wedding cars. I managed a brief glimpse of it through the side mirror, and could just make out her figure in the passenger seat. Driving the van though, was a strange looking man. He wore a sort of tuxedo. It was hard to make out a clear image, but in that moment, I was certain that the skin of his face glowed red.

We arrived at the venue, -an amazing outdoor garden with exquisite mountain views -  and Mum and Dad walked me down the aisle. It would forever be a moment engraved in my heart. Filtered sunlight from a Jacaranda tree illuminated my soon to be Husband, giving him an ethereal glow. Joe stood there watching my approach, his eyes bulging out of their sockets as tears poured out. When I reached him, he violated all traditional wedding protocol. He lifted my veil and kissed me long and hard on the mouth, his tears mixing with my own.

“I fucking love you so much,” he said when we finished.

My response was pressing my lips to his and resuming the hookup.

Realising there was an audience of 200 people watching our passion and waiting for further ceremonies to begin, I reluctantly tore my lips from Joe’s and spun around to face them. I felt my face grow hot as the guests began to clap. I gave an embarrassed smile, and instinctively switched my gaze to my parents, ready to meet Mum’s scowling face. She was only smiling warmly.

The moment would have been the perfect sowing of the day's Euphoria, had my eyes not fallen on Jeanie, standing next to my parents on the first row. She gave me that seductive smile, and despite this being a special moment between Joe and I, I felt an unwanted warmness develop in my loins, such that I wasn’t expecting to feel till I was laying in bed at the hotel later that night.

I realised then, that whenever I looked at her, my body was prompted to do two things: Feel an unprecedented arousal, and all outward communication to become enthralled to her. It’s hard to explain the latter other than being like this: In my mind, I was loathing her, wanting to tell her to get the fuck off that special row and sit at the very rear behind everyone else. But my body language refused to show any of this. I merely smiled like her presence was the very highlight of the entire wedding.

Desiring to ignore her, I switched my gaze to the second row where my Sisters and their families sat. I got the beautiful image of all my loved ones smiling at me.  But it was ruined by Jeanie. Her sultry form was a black stain on the family portrait.

My mind screamed at my body to point to the last row and tell her to sit there. But, it would not obey.

The Celebrant cleared his throat, prompting Joe and I to turn around to begin the ceremony. We would go on to say our vowels and promise a lifetime of love and loyalty to each other. But as Joe’s watery eyes looked into mine with nothing but love as he placed the ring on my finger, all of my attention was on the Woman in Grey, sitting conveniently in my peripheral. The memory of that special moment being tainted by that Bitch is so infuriating, that several keys on my keyboard are now stuck in place.

When the ceremony concluded, the guests went to mingle and enjoy a bountiful afternoon tea, whilst Joe and I, accompanied by the bridal party, went out into the gardens where photography was to take place.

We got hundreds of beautiful images. I have them beside me now as I write. Everyone looked so happy and elegant, like it was the prime moment of their lives. Joe, oh Joe was so handsome. The only negative thing I have to say about them, revolves around myself.

In not a single photo, was I looking directly at the camera. I faced in that direction, but my eyes were looking slightly to the side. At what you might ask? Well that would be Jeanie of course, who had been standing beside the photographer for the entire photo shoot!

When I first saw these photos, it sated at least one thing that had been troubling me ever since that day. Joe wasn’t under her spell. The irony of it makes me burn, for the primary emotion that screamed in my mind the entire day, was Jealousy. Jealousy that the Sultry Bitch was catching Joe’s eyes as she was to me.

So you get the idea of what the day was like for me. Instead of feeling Euphoric, it was rank with emotions I didn’t want. Everything went well, and everyone was having a great time, except me. My body language showed that I did, but only I know what I was battling inside.

The 9.30pm  dancing began as usual. Joe and I’s first dance, followed by the bridal party and then the open dance floor. The first few songs were mellow to allow for couples to waltz. It eventually transitioned to modern dance music, and it was here where the party really started happening. I swear, even the oldies were on the dance floor, pumping their fists to 2000’s rave hits. The energy in the room was ecstatic. Euphoric.

I hadn't seen Jeanie since the dancing began, and before long I had forgotten about her as I too became lost in the moment. I danced the night away, switching between Joe, my sisters, cousins, and friends. The long hem of my dress was tattered with all the people stepping all over it as they partied on the dance floor. All 200 guests were there.

I eventually lost track of the time. I was certain that hours had passed and was awaiting to hear from Jeanie to tell me that it was time to start wrapping things up. I remembered her strange notion, that the party ends when the party dies. Looking at the throng of dancing guests, drinking and laughing their hearts out, I could not see the party dying anytime soon.

I returned to the bridal table to have a well earned glass of water. While I was up there, I thought I’d check the time. There was literally not a single clock in the function room, so my next best bet was my sisters phone. Being the maid of honour, she left her purse next to my own seat when she had gone down to dance. I opened it up, and flicked on the phone.

It said 9.30pm.

Confused, I turned it off then back on again. Still 9.30pm.

I knew this couldn’t be right, as the dancing had easily been going on for at least two hours. The exhaustion that was starting to settle into my bones was enough to clarify this.

Convinced that the phone was playing up, I grabbed my other sisters purse and turned on her phone. It too, displayed 9.30pm.

I blinked a few times, trying to get my head around it.

Unwilling to accept that this was true, I checked every phone on the bridal table. All of them showed 9.30pm.

I stared at the dancing crowd below me, hoping that someone would notice the puzzled expression on my face and start laughing. I hoped it was just some cruel practical joke being played by the bridal party.

A tap on my shoulder startled me. It was Jeanie. Her pretty face was a mask of concern. I say a mask, because that Bitch was laughing inwardly at my dilemma.

“What’s the matter, dear?”

I held up one of the phones, pointing at the time.  “It’s only 9.30pm! All the phones say so! Something isn't right.”

Jeanie reached into her own pocket and pulled her own phone out, holding it out so I could see the display. 9.30pm.

“I don’t understand what the problem is, sweetie?”

“We’ve been dancing for hours! I know it!”

“Well the clock says otherwise,” Jeanie replied, matter-of-factually. “Embrace it babe! Better to have the party go longer than you anticipated. That’s what makes this such a special day. Its a sign that the Euphoria is present!”

I was going to argue more, but I was being called back to the dance floor by my guests. I returned to them and resumed dancing, trying to clear my mind of the dilemma and enjoy the moment. I was convinced that the practical joke would come to an end soon enough.

After what felt like another two hours, I needed to go to the bathroom. So two of my sisters accompanied me there, helping with the wedding dress. We were busy chit-chatting away, when one of my sisters pulled out her phone. “Ah thank fuck!” she exclaimed. “It’s only 9.30! This party is only just getting started!”

The stream of my piss suddenly halted. “What the fuck is this all about! Can you please quit the joke, it’s starting to make me uncomfortable.”

My sister looked at me aghast. “Gee, what's up your bum? I’m just saying how much fun I’m having and the night is still young! You should be cheering, Sylvia!”

I felt my stomach churn like I had just been on a roller-coaster. Nothing was making sense. My body clock was screaming at me that it was close to 1am, not 9.30pm!

When we returned to the dance-floor, I was no longer in a partying mood. I needed to see the time from a clock that did not belong to someone I knew. I eyed the waiters as they moved through the room, clearing dirty plates from the tables as they bobbed to the music - the Euphoria gripping them too. There had to be a clock in their kitchen, for how else would they be able to serve the food at the designated times?

I managed to sneak away from the dance floor, pretending I was going over to the photo booth. Then, I slipped through the kitchen doors and entered where I wasn’t supposed to be. I was instantly met with the startled eyes of several unsuspecting staff. I was fortunate enough to see an analog clock hung high on the wall.

It was still 9.30pm!

I was about to scream, when a man grabbed me by the arm, and threw me back into the reception hall. I didn’t get a view of his face, only felt the searing heat coming from his unnaturally red hand. The doors to the kitchen slammed behind me.

I slumped against the wall, staring at the revelry encapsulating the room. I knew with all my sanity that we hadn't just started dancing. Despite everyone sweating and beginning to look very exhausted, they continued to party like there was no tomorrow.

And then my eyes fell upon something that made my heart jolt.

Within the thicket of party goers, a man lay on the floor. Not a single person noticed him even as some carelessly stepped on him. He writhed about, trying to move out of the way. I recognised his face at once. It was Dad. His face looked like it had been dunked in a bath. He panted like a dog as he clutched his chest.

I nearly tripped over my dress as I ran to him.

I shoved dancing family and friends aside until I was able to be near him. I screamed at everyone to move out the way, to help, but all just ignored me. I couldn’t believe it. I pulled my father by the arm and managed to get him a safe distance away from all the trampling feet. Only then did I notice the front of his suit covered in vomit.

“CAN SOMEONE PLEASE HELP!!!” I roared above the music, but not a single person responded. When they did look at me, they only continued smiling, paying no heed to the ailing man in my arms.

By this point I knew there was something heavily amiss but was so broken, scared and exhausted to be able to do anything about it. I merely sat there on the edge of the dance floor, holding my Dad as he slowly died.

Not a single guest noticed, as I cried hysterically.

As the night drew on for what felt to me like days, more of the guests began to collapse and succumb to their exhaustion. It started with the older ones; Mum - ever strong willed, ever strong bodied - being the last over-50 to finally given in to her exhaustion. The ones my age and younger -their bodies not unused to partying hard - followed shortly after. One by one, they collapsed and were trampled by oblivious revelers.

I cried and cried and cried, until the very last party goer, my dear Joe, fell over, his partying heart finally giving up.

I ran over to him, and cradled his head in my hands. I closed my eyes, hoping this was just some stupid nightmare and I would instead awaken on the true day of my wedding. The horrific silence of the dead party only remained.

I was a bitter mess, crying with all my heart for all 200 family and friends lying dead about me; All having died of exhaustion, a result of an unprecedented Euphoria.

“Now the Party ends, Sweetheart!”

I turned to see Jeanie, walking over to me, arm in arm with a tall and terrifying looking man. His face was a burnt red, his eyes a dark abyss. Even without context, I knew he was a Demon.

Jeanie began to laugh as she crouched down to my height and caressed my cheek. “Such a dynamic couple we are,” she jerked her head in the direction of her demonic company. “He get’s his souls, and I get to see another beautiful bride’s devastated face after I ruined her day!” She laughed a cackling witch’s laugh.

She began to undo the lower buttons of her blazer before tearing it off, revealing her full perfect naked torso. She slipped out of her skirt and stood before me, butt naked. The Demon began to fondle one of her breasts, licking her smooth neck with it’s forked tongue. She moaned with delight as the Demon tore it’s own clothes off with it’s sharp claws and threw her down onto her hands and knees right in front of me. She arched her backside with eagerness to receive him.

I forced my eyes shut, not wanting to bear witness to this unholy copulation. But the Bitch slapped me hard across the face, forcing me to reopen them. “You keep your eyes open! I wanna see the despair in your pretty eyes as I cum!!”

The Demon entered her, and she moaned with delight as they rutted for what felt like an eternity. She stared at me the entire time, rubbing her clitoris vigorously. She climaxed alongside the Demon, their Hellish moaning reducing my soul to smithereens.

With their copulation ended, they stood back up, making no effort to put their clothes back on. The Demon gave a fanged smile as he gazed at all the bodies littered about the room. He held his arm around Jeanie’s naked waist and began to lead her away.

Just as they were about to pass me, Jeanie hawked and spat a large gobbet of phlegm in my face. I was too paralysed to even wipe it off. She chuckled and pat me on the head like a dog. “You can go kill yourself now, you stupid Bitch. You’ll make a wonderful tree in Hell that I’m sure will attract all the harpies to tear at.”

And with that, her and the Demon departed, leaving me alone in a room full of silence.

One of my sisters lay dead not too far from me. Her phone was splayed out on the floor, and had somehow just turned on.

The time was 9.31pm.

Time had finally resumed it’s course, now that the party was officially dead.

I was little more than a hollow shell when the police eventually arrived at the reception hall. I was brought straight into ICU at the nearest hospital where I was placed under strict police guard for the duration of my stay. It would be nearly three days until I had fully recovered my senses.

Being the only survivor from my wedding - even the reception staff had all succumbed to the Euphoria - suspicion naturally fell onto me as having some part in it. But I was too much of an emotional wreck, to even begin talking about the day. Losing everyone that meant something to you in a single blow, is the hardest thing that anyone could ever recover from.

Frustration with my lack of communication eventually drove the investigators to bring in the Country’s top interrogators to finally get me to talk. I was taken to a Police station where I was locked in a room with two dour faced men.

I covered my face and broke into a fit of tears, after the first question was asked.

There was an intense shuffling in the room, and I braced myself for one of them to strike me. Then the door opened.

“Gentlemen, we’ll take care of the situation from here,” came a female voice. I peeked through my fingers, and saw two women enter. One was blonde, the other, brunette. Both wore dark glasses and had a very serious demeanour. They wore well fitted clothing, and unlike Jeanie, looked highly professional.

With slumped shoulders the two men left.

“Move your face from your hands, Sylvia, you have nothing to fear from us,” the blonde said.

I did as I was told, her soothing voice no doubt playing a large part.

The blonde pointed at her own chest. “I am detective Sonia Hay, and this is detective Rebecca Lyle.”

Rebecca the brunette continued, “We are going to jump straight to our own conclusions of what happened on your wedding night. You hired a dark haired woman dressed in grey to coordinate your wedding, didn’t you?”

I gulped hard, not liking where this was going. “Yes,” I croaked, my vocal chords rusty after nearly a week of disuse. “Her name is Jeanie Lilly.”

The two women shot each other a knowing glance. Sonia shook her head. “It was her then,” she said, more to herself than anything.

That comment sparked my interest. “You know about Jeanie?” I asked.

“First, tell us in full, your experience of the woman please.”

With great reluctance I recalled everything, from the initial meeting in the van at the bridal expo, to her final remark for me to go kill myself.

When I finished, I was crying again. Rebecca stepped forward and placed a gentle hand on my shoulder. “We are sorry this had to happen to you, Sylvia. But please know, if it gives you any comfort, your wedding was not the first she has ruined.”

I wiped my eyes and stared at her, determined to learn more. “How many then?”

“Thousands.”

I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. Surely such a killing streak would have reached the mainstream media by now. “But that’s impossible.”

“It’s very possible when you’ve had the same drive for the last 9000 years,” Sonia said.

I cocked my head, not getting where this was going.

Rebecca squeezed my shoulder gently. “She’s had many names over the years; Jeanie being the one she chose to ensnare you with. We call her the Jealous Bitch, for that is what she is. But her real name is Lilith.”

My mind raced as I tried to recall where I had heard that name before. I remembered a popular Metal song I used to listen to as a teenager called Lilith Immaculate, and my heart jolted to a halt.

It all made sense.

Jeanie was Lilith, the supposed first wife of Adam, turned Demonic temptress after her refusal to do Adam’s bidding in bed.

They must have sensed the recognition in my eyes. “Yes, that Lilith. She’s been ruining weddings ever since her divorce with Adam.” Sonia said. “We have only been tracing her for the last 10 years. There’s been scores of similar crimes around the world, all bearing the same theme. That of a woman in grey, with a seductive air about her, stressing a payment only of Euphoria, who, once all the guests have literally partied themselves to death, gets fucked by a demon as she soaks in the dismayed face of the bride.”

I couldn’t believe it. Of course it would be my luck to stumble upon this ancient Horror.

They went on to explain that her current sexual partner was a high ranking Demon officer from Hell. They work together to achieve their means. Her’s being the dark fetish of being fucked while looking at a despair gripped bride, His being the souls of all those killed at the wedding.

It filled me with the greatest of heartaches to know that all my guests; my friends, family, and beautiful Husband, were now trapped in a place of eternal torment. All because of me and my stupid desire for the perfect wedding.

Due to Rebecca and Sonia being deeply involved in investigating the spout of similar crimes from around the world, they were given the authority to determine what should happen with me. They deemed me innocent, and, after a lot of back and forth's, took me into their care.

As part of their investigations they had set up a group that was run entirely by women from a whole range of ethnicities, its purpose being to aid with the administration, and to assist in the world-wide tracking of Lilith and her Consort. All members shared one thing in common: We were all unfortunate brides who had had their weddings ruined by the Jealous Bitch.

With none of their families left alive, naturally, these victims of the same crime formed their own. I quickly became a part of this new family.

We are all driven by an immense desire to avenge all the loved-ones we have lost. Every day, we scour the internet for new businesses within the wedding industry, while others, such as myself, are on the lookout for the next incident, which I’m sad to say, will be imminent.

But I know, deep down in my heart, that we are getting close to stopping her, and boy, you have no idea how much I look forward to that day.

It is here in our headquarters - a secret place that Lilith will never learn of - that I write this warning for all you bride’s-to-be out there.

Plan your wedding, and Coordinate it yourself. The stress of doing so is far better than chancing your special day to be completely ruined, and all your loved-ones ending up in Hell. No word can ever be placed to describe the immense guilt you would feel, knowing you had a part in your spouse’s eternal torments.

I cannot tell you what name she will go by next, but I’d hate for it to be your wedding that she and her Demon consort ruin next.",1,1736737740.0,jaymicafella,0,1.0,False

She lived with her mom and I lived with mine for the majority. She did not have a great home life and mine wasn't the best either. We ended up living together as adults in my mom's and our dad's house. I moved in this past March and she had been there a year prior. I had multiple conversations with her about moving in together and moving closer to where I worked to give her more opportunities for jobs, since she was miserable working in my home town mcdonalds. She said her only worry was me using the help I gave her, paying the full deposit, first months, and the second months rent for her, and turning it against her. I told her that I wasn't worried about it bc I didn't even care if she paid me back as long as she kept up her portion of the bills when she got started. Now both me and my bf, 23 M, are a little messy, we don't do the dishes everyday and we leave some cups/boxes around. I don't want to down play it bc that is the whole issue, so right now there's a full sink of dirty dishes, shoes in the living room, one on the coffee table, a big box that's been there a while, and the floors are unswept and unmopped. It got to this point bc both me and my bf have been struggling with mental health and I have been sleeping all night and at least 3-5 hours during the day almost everyday bc i don't have any energy. Now I know for a lot of people that's not a good enough excuse. Anyway, so I woke up this morning to a huge text from her(I'm going to paraphrase bc i did not read it all) about how she has asked us to clean up after ourselves countless times and that I'm not taking care of my responsibilities so if the house isn't clean when she wakes up she's sending all the videos from since we moved in to now of our filth to the property management and getting herself removed from the lease. Now I gave her ample opportunity to have a civilized conversation with me about any problems she's been having in the house and if she is not happy and if there was anything we could do to help bc she was still miserable, if not more, after moving in with us. The only times she mentioned us cleaning up is when she was screaming mad bc I had made some snarky comment like the one that started this was me saying something about her being clueless about why my cat was found in the basement. I did not respond to this message, instead I emailed our property management verbatim ""Good morning! I know you probably aren't in the office today but I just wanted to go some information whenever you're available. [Her name] has brought it to my attention that she would possibly like to be removed from the lease here soon and I wanted to know what that process would look like if that is something we are able to do. Thank you again!"" And nothing else. Did not get a response. She ended up waking up and started screaming about how she's more miserable now and how our filth is the reason she is so miserable. We told her that she could leave we didn't care and I heard her talking to property management about sending the videos she has bc she can't live like this. Now I know there's not necessarily a right or wrong to this situation but I really just needed to vent and get some advice bc I'm terrified that we are going to get evicted bc of this. This is my home that I got us and where I finally feel safe. This is where I started my life with my partner. 

Anyway idk if this is legible bc I'm just not in a great head space but any feedback is welcome. I can post pics of the current status of the communal parts of the house if requested.

Tldr: my sister is mad that the house is messy and is now sending video evidence to our property management to get herself removed from the lease.",2,1736737464.0,AITAH,7,1.0,False

The large circular standing tent, big around enough for several round, waist-high spool tables, was quiet—beyond, through the parted entry flaps which afforded the space with some light, camp chatter was heard; only one other man sat there in the tent with him—the man in leathers, though he wore no leather on this day besides his boots. He was swathed in cotton relax-wear. They shared a table and the man in leathers’ eyes were slitted like he’d only just woken. He winced at his compatriot’s words.

“Come on, Hubal, you wax philosophical every day of the week and here you are, telling me that shit makes you weak.” Pit coughed into his hand, wiped his palm down the front of his leather vest, and continued, “There are people from all walks of life, so there’s bound to be people that enjoy it! I heard even rich folks in Dallas like it sometimes. They hire some whore to come to an otherwise sterile room they’ve rented, and they lay beneath a pane of glass and have the whore shoot their back wad directly across its surface. It's some natural animal instinct, as all things are that humans do, I’m sure.”

Hubal, the man in leathers, shook his head; his attention became half divided between the strange conversation and his handheld tablet. He scanned through a database of names, photographs, bounties; the touch screen responded to his finger touches as he moved through the pillared line of names. Many of the entries on the tablet did not have a photo, but ever since his meeting with the hunchback and clown, he’d been unable to push them from his mind. He’d spoken of his certainty aloud among the other slavers, but many of his band did not consider it worthwhile. He’d scoured the database, entered potential keywords—locations, dates. Many of the names were already marked dead or delivered; besides, the tablet had not been updated since Dallas. Hubal was no bounty-hunter, and his fellow slavers reminded him of this fact daily.

Pit told him already that it was like a thorn in Hubal’s brain; it should be removed.

Pit went on, “I don’t think it’s that strange, for someone to have a fetish like that, do you?”

Without looking up from his tablet, Hubal responded, “Just who are you intending to convince with this nonsense?”

Pit chuckled and rose from his chair, “Want some coffee?”

Hubal nodded, but froze and sat the tablet face down on the spool table’s surface. He snapped his fingers at Pit, “Wash your goddamn hands before you fetch me anything I put in my mouth.”

Again, Pit chuckled and waved his hand. He disappeared from the tent, kicking up a plume of dust-smoke with his boot heels on his way through the entry.

Hubal rotated his thumbs around his temples, leaned over to spit on the dirt floor, then returned to the tablet. Minutes passed in silence as the man scanned the lists of names, photos, descriptions, bounty tags.

Pit returned with two metal mugs; upon brushing past the center support pole of the tent, the whole flimsy structure shook. Hubal shot him a look and Pit grinned broad enough to show his red-eaten gums. Pit passed a mug to Hubal while sipping from his own, and returned to his seat. “The others outside, they’re listening to something from Dallas while we’re still in range. Some choir girls sang for Franklin White at his banquet a few nights ago and they’re still playing the recording on the radio. You should come out and listen to it some.”

“Stupid,” said Hubal.

“The choir girls or the president?”

Hubal fluttered his hand at his fellow slaver, further examined the mug he’d been handed, sipped. “Did you vote for him? I don’t recall casting a ballot. Of course, if I know anything about this world, it is that commerce talks. Communication. Some enforcing apparatus, some cash. It’s a contract.” Hubal, the man in leathers, smirked and traced the tablet and his mug across the table so that he could rest his arms parallel. He leveled over his fists there. “It’s all made up. White’s in the spot he’s in because of it. The whores, as you call them, shit across glass for it. Those girls sing for it. Some communication with the world. Some communication with each other? It is the lay of the land. The absolute truth. It’s what separates you and me from rocks or plants or animals. Behold, these social constructs of the world.”

Pit shook his head. “There you are. I knew you were hiding in there somewhere. Well, I don’t actually care about it at all. I just thought it might do you some good to come outside and mingle. You’ve spent so much time staring at that box that I worry your eyes might waver from squinting that way.” Pit rose again from the table, scanned the makeshift room, and drank from his vessel before scratching behind his head. “So, you saw a clown with no ears, so what?”

“Commerce is what!” said Hubal; he’d pushed his coffee aside entirely and shifted around to better face Pit—his legs occupied open space. He came to his feet so that he hovered over his chair. The man in leathers pointed a finger at Pit, “You and I share a table. We all meet at a table. It is the functions of life that keep us even. You enter this world with the same potential as all the other poor souls that come here. It’s a slap in the face of what I believe down to the very bottom of who I am, understand?” His outstretched finger quivered, and he took notice of this with a glance and evened himself with his hands on his knees.

“Did this guy really piss you off or what?” asked Pit.

Hubal sighed and twisted around on his chair so that his legs were entirely under the table; he angled over and stared at the blank screen of the tablet. “I know that man and the woman he travels with. I almost got the woman, but things happened.” he shrugged.

“How?” Pit straightened; his expression became wholly serious.

“Years ago there was a boy, he wasn’t a clown yet—it’s a tattoo anyway,” Hubal waved his hands at what he believed was a spectacular detail, “He was my uncle’s tender up in Louisville.”

A long silence stretched on between the two men that was only broken when Pit audibly drank from his mug.

Finally, Pit asked, “The boy wasn’t a lovechild, was he?” The question was matter of fact, almost casual.

Hubal winced but shook his head. “When I saw them first in Dallas, I couldn’t place it, but I was drawn to the pair of them like a magnet. Something about them seemed entirely familiar.” The man in leathers began chewing his bottom lip, drumming his fingers across the spool table. He sighed, “Seeing him closer like that, I knew it was him. And that woman that’s with him; she was another of my uncle’s.”

“Was she a love—

“Christ, no! My uncle never kept any children for purposes like that. Don’t you know when to leave a subject alone?”

Pit took another drink only to find his mug empty; he overturned it, his fingers still laced through the handle and shook the inside drier. “I met your uncle Sal once, remember? He seemed nice enough, but there are stories.”

Hubal squinted, snapped a finger at Pit to reach for the leather jacket which hung on the chair nearest the entry flaps. Pit moved there, rifled through the article’s pockets, then returned with a lighter and a pack of cigarettes; these, he offered to the other man. The man in leathers firmly planted a tube into his mouth and lit the opposite end.

After several luxuriated puffs, Hubal continued, “It’s the ears, or lack thereof which has me amiss.”

“Of the clown?”

Hubal slapped his hand across the table firmly, “Yes! Of the clown!” he mocked, “That’s what we’re talking about, yes? Now shut up and listen.” He motioned for Pit to return to the chair across from himself. “Sit and shut up and I’ll tell you.”

Pit nodded, placed his mug mouth down on the table and sat, leaning forward to listen with his cheek placed across his hand.

“Louisville. My uncle. He kept a young boy and a young girl. The boy is the clown. The girl had a twisted back. It’s the same ones. They must be runaways. And although I’ve heard all your rebuttals before, I know, I know, I am no bounty hunter. However, we are slavers, and those pair are escaped slaves. Definitionally—if not morally—we are obliged.”

“How can you be sure?”

“Because,” Hubal toked, “I saw it in their faces that night in Dallas.” He shook his head, idly spit like with hair in his mouth, then rubbed his thumb across his bottom lip to examine the loose tobacco he found there. “Because anytime my uncle caught wind of an unruly one, he took an ear. If the unsatisfactory behavior continued, he took the other. Of course, I can only imagine this clown was unruly indeed.”

“Doesn’t matter,” said Pit.

“Of course it matters.”

Pit smiled—his rotting teeth shone in the glints of light which passed through the entry flaps—and offered up his empty spaced hands, “They’re gone now. I’m sorry, bossman. You should’ve nabbed them back in Dallas. Especially if you were so sure.”

“You see the predicament then. It’s driven me mad, honestly. I should’ve, but there was a nagging part,” he swirled his hand by his head to accentuate the point, “What if I was wrong?”

“And you’re not wrong now?”

“No. I can say with absolute certainty that I know what I’m talking about.”

“Maybe you should contact your uncle.”

 

\*\*\*

 

The space was absent of light with only a bit of sound, like someone rearranging luggage haphazardly—the sound of metallic gear being moved from place to place reverberated through the dark cavern. The thump of hollow containers, the scrape of jewelry-thin chains, the flap of leather straps.

Hoichi’s sightless eyes stood open and darted soundlessly around, but he did not move from where he lay on the cool hard stone.

The Nephilim rummaged through Hoichi’s scattered gear; the thing’s eyes did not need light to see and so, even cast in absolute dark as they were, The Nephilim shifted around from the mess he’d made, noticed Hoichi’s eyes open and lumbered across the space between them and lowered himself to the ground to look in the face of the man. The Nephilim grinned and spoke, *Du bist wach.* The clown flinched at the words, scrambled from his prone position and slammed into the curved wall of the cavern behind him.

Hoichi’s mouth trembled even while his jaw remained clenched hard. “Where’s my clothes?” asked the clown; he was indeed naked. His things were all stripped from him.

*English then?* Asked The Nephilim.

“English? Goddammit, where’re my clothes?”

*Taken. No clothes. No weapons. No hiding.* The Nephilim smiled, but Hoichi could not see. That great beast stilted back on his heels and puffed out his chest and stared down at the small clown.

Hoichi swallowed, kept his hands around himself and his knees pulled to his chest while he sat on the stone. “What’s all this about then? What do you want? Why’s it so cold? Where am I?”

*Shh,* shushed The Nephilim, *Good clown. Ruhig.* Pivoting, he returned to the gear to rummage then moved back to the clown with a flashlight. He held the thing between two fingers, fiddled with the device, clicked the switch on the tube then rolled it across the stone floor to the feet of the clown.

Hoichi scrambled for the light, blinking sporadically at its presence, then angled it around to catch his captor in the dull white beam. The clown yelped, dropped the light, and went after it to pull it up again into the face of The Nephilim. The creature held his palm across his eyes and motioned for the clown to lower the light.

Instead of directing the light towards the stone floor, Hoichi dragged the beam across the ceiling, showing dull brown sandstone; they were beneath the earth. “Where are we?” he asked.

*Underground,* said The Nephilim.

“Underground? Underground where? What is this place? Why’d you bring me here?” Within the peripheral ring of the flashlight, Hoichi’s face glistened with sweat despite the cool air of the cavern.

*Shh.* The Nephilim pointed a long index finger towards some unseen direction swallowed up by darkness and said, *Closed there. Big rock.* The Nephilim shrugged and grinned and shifted the long hair from his face. The beast nodded in the direction opposite, *You go. You’re essential.*

“Essential? What do you need from me?” Hoichi, seemingly noticing how exposed he was for the first time, attempted to keep the light from his own body so that he remained in shadow.

*Underground,* the creature pointed at the stone under their feet, *Big power. It vibrates. It’s loud. All over.* The Nephilim smacked his lips and grinned again at his captive.

“We need to go down? Why?” Hoichi shivered and his eyes shifted around in the dark and froze to stare in the direction of where The Nephilim had only moments before pointed and said, *Closed there.*

The Nephilim straightened and his great body stretched like foul taffy till his head almost reached the rock overhead. Hoichi shrank without saying a word. *Don’t run,* said the beast, *You run? You’re dead.*

“Are you trying to make a deal with me?” asked the clown, “I’ve heard of how your sort make deals with people all the time. It’s in all kinds of stories.”

The Nephilim threw his head back and laughed; his voice carried off then resounded so that by the time he stopped, the laughter arrived again. With a cocked head, a queer twinkle in his eye which danced as he examined his captive’s face, that great beast lowered himself near to where the clown was, so the flashlight’s beam cut harsh angles across his features—a long finger pointed towards the shadows. *You go. Go now.*

Hoichi bit onto his lips to stop them trembling then shook his head, “You’re a demon, aren’t you? You’re a demon and you’re going to lead me to hell.” His words were hesitant and came with very little conviction.

With haste, The Nephilim impatiently gripped the clown’s arm and shoved him down the way, in the direction he intended for them, and the flashlight bobbed as Hoichi staggered over his own feet. Keeping himself upright, he twisted around to look at the beast, once more bit his lips shut, then nodded and began walking.

The Nephilim followed the clown deeper into the cavern.

1i04gkc,https://i.redd.it/3cvqk8l2goce1.jpeg,AITA for getting Liszt into a depressive episode? (It was for the better),"I (23F) was feeling second hand embarrassment for my friend Franz, not just because he wasn’t sleeping, drinking Four Lokos, and clearly in a manic state, but because he was playing Elden Ring, and that’s embarrassing. I don’t know how this dude ever got laid.

He was so drunk all the time, that he didn’t realize when I started to replace his Four Lokos with thc/xanax infused Red Bull concoctions. 

He started to go from being manic to being tired, sleeping 15 hours a day, and staring at the wall. 

I one day found him playing Elden Ring (to my horror), but on closer inspection, he was passed out with the Red Bulls in his hand, and his Marie Callender’s chicken pot pie cold as fuck and not touched on the coffee table.

I was then greatly relieved to see that he lost the energy to play Elden Ring.

The other day, he screamed at me because I had “stolen” his Red Bulls, completely ignoring that I was the one supplying him with it. Then he broke down crying.

I realized that I fixed him, and I was so proud.

But things took a turn for the worse when he went out while barred out on “red bulls” and burned down a nearby taco stand.

He’s in jail rn awaiting trial, but at least he isn’t a sore loser who plays Elden Ring. Maybe he’ll actually get laid now.

1i04g21,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1i04g21/rf_sarah/,[RF] Sarah,"The cafe was busy, but not overwhelmingly so. The before-work crowd was still streaming in, corporate-looking men and women hurriedly ordering coffees and sandwiches at the counter before rushing to the office.

Jo and I sat in our usual booth, tucked away in the corner of the room and pressed up against a large street-side window. Jo liked to watch as people scurried about on their way to work, and she’d said that sitting by the window was the only way to do it fairly, so that they could watch us too.

The nine-o-clock sun was spilled across our table, warming us on an otherwise chilly February morning.

Jo stuffed her cigarette into the ashtray which sat between our coffees and smiled at me.

“What was she like?”

Her question startled me.

It had seemed some sort of unwritten law between us to never speak of it.

That being said, it was the anniversary of the whole damned thing. Seven years. It hardly seemed possible.

Had Jo known that, or was her asking just a strange coincidence? I guessed I’d shared the date with her at some point, during a long-ago conversation in a distant, forgotten corner.

I cleared my throat. Jo continued to smile toward me.

“If you don’t want to talk about her, it’s okay.”

“Um,” I managed.

“No, really, it’s okay.” She took a small sip from her mug, momentarily looking away.

I suddenly felt warm all over. The heat rose from my chest to my head and went back down again, with no way to get out.

It’s a funny thing to lose someone when you’re young and invincible, and twenty-seven is still that, and then to be thirty-four and still somewhat broken, but mended, so that the scar yet shows under the right lighting but doesn’t hurt so much anymore.

I didn’t know how to respond. It had been so long since I’d last talked about her.

“I’m sorry, Jack. Really, forget I even brought it up.”

The sunlight glistened off of Jo’s wedding band, still new and mostly un-scuffed, blinding my eyes and turning everything amber.

I remembered much about her, but the memories were no longer clear, like old video tape that had been worn out and recorded over.

There were smiles and tears and laughter and arguments and forgiveness, over and over again, all unspooled and jumbled up together.

I saw once-familiar places and old friends and long drives home and her leaning out of the sun-roof of my dad’s car, shouting at the moon and laughing hard, and that CD was probably still in there somewhere, tucked under the passenger seat forever.

There was sneaking through my bedroom window and fumbling around in the dark and falling in love and heading off to college but still making it work.

I remembered that first apartment together when there was no money, and then suddenly a lot of it, but nothing different between the two of us expect for the growing wrinkles around our eyes and my hair growing thinner, and there was a dog named for a movie we liked and a view of the city and a candle always lit on the dining room table.

And then there was none of it.

Suddenly and abruptly and unfairly and shitily, but there was nothing that could be done about that now.

Her mom and dad, and mine were already gone, and her brothers and sisters that had become my own but were no longer, and all of those friends were ours together and it wasn’t right to have them on my own so I didn’t anymore.

Nothing to be done about it but continuing to move forward and smiling through it all and working to forget and trying not to remember. Yes, that was the way to do it.

She had told me once that when she was a kid, she’d tell the other children that the “S” which started her name stood for “smiley,” and I think it must have because that’s what I most remembered, but she hadn’t been smiling in the casket and I didn’t know what to do about that.

And I felt my cheeks growing hot and wet and everything was starting to burn and I couldn’t stop myself from remembering it all until the tape was put back to the reels and tucked away somewhere.

Her smile was gone forever and I wasn’t sure how to answer Jo so I just sat there. I noticed through the amber that her smile was gone now, too.

“Okay—which one of you had the breakfast platter?”

And then it was gone.

“Um,” I managed.

The waitress set it down in front of me and put Jo’s food in front of her.

“Let me know if you two need anything else!”

And that was all I could remember and Jo didn’t want to know anymore and I couldn’t tell her anything about it anyway.

Why have I been such a committed consumer? I found in my experience, it actually helped with my anxiety. The mood boost I felt usually helped me unwind on a Friday night and it never interfered with sleep. I actually used to attempt late nighters only to pass out at midnight at latest. 

My current regimen is on the higher end. I’d say about 16-24oz from the keurig. Sometimes I have a can of soda too. I do set a time limit not to consume past 12:30PM (I work 2nd shift so that would be about 12 hours to bedtime). That includes chocolate. I’m considering going decaf 1) because who wouldn’t like to have normal sleep and 2) I think it’s reasonable that my metabolism has changed over the years or there was something about me that tolerated it in the past, even so close to bedtime.

**SPOILER WARNING: Since this is a rewatch, it's assumed that anyone in these discussions has already seen the entire show, so all spoilers are allowed.**


Day 112 brings us to ""Red Letter Day,"" which begins with Cho and Jane heading out to the town of Percy. Jane leaves a piece of toothpick in his office doorway. At the scene, they find the body of Hollis Percy, the owner of the town. Jane bends down and sniffs him. They hear gunshots, and Rigsby and Cho run to investigate, but they discover that the town is in the midst of a Western show. 

Title relevance: A ""red letter day"" refers to a pleasant day worth remembering, though I'm not sure why that would apply to this episode, since some rather gloomy things happen.

Notable guest stars: Kevin Cahoon (from Nurse Jackie and A Series of Unfortunate Events), Harry Groener (from Buffy the Vampire Slayer), Antonio Jaramillo (from the Dallas reboot), Tamara Mello (from She's All That)

Location: Percy, CA


Notable scenes: 
- Lisbon was ""busy"" earlier because she was having coffee with Kirkland on the CBI rooftop. He asks whether they have any new leads on Red John. Lisbon fills Jane in later.
- Rigsby gives Grace a welcome-back orchid.
- Jane and Lisbon talk to the Percy police chief, and he tells them they've been having problems with meth labs blowing up and causing fires. They meet with Hollis's son and wife. Jane asks them to write down the most likely suspect, and they both write down Francisco Navarro. The team investigates Navarro's opposition to Percy selling land in the town.
- In the town, Jane embarrasses a street magician by revealing his moves and outdoing him. Jane and Lisbon talk to a young woman named Lily in the saloon.
- Cho and Rigsby go to the location of one of the meth lab fires. Rigsby uses his arson knowledge to figure out that it was a controlled fire started by an arsonist. 
- At the CBI, service men break into Jane's office and document everything for Homeland.
- Rigsby and Cho bust the police chief starting another fire, finding him guilty of a real estate scam. He tells them about a domestic call he got at the Percy house. Jane poses the idea that something from Hollis's past emerged a month ago.
- Jane talks to the bartender Lily and says he'll write down what she'll have for breakfast the next day and makes her promise not to open his guess until the next day.
- Jane starts a bar brawl and ducks out as Cho moves in to break it up. (He's been doing this a lot this season!) Navarro talks about an illegitimate daughter from Percy's past. 
- Kirkland works to piece together Jane's list.
- Jane goes back to Percy and tells the street magician that his magic sucks eggs. He embarrasses him again and causes him to quit. He performs a trick to convince Navarro to hire him as a replacement. Jane takes the stage and uses his performance to draw out the killer: Ian Percy, Hollis's son. Ian killed Hollis because he was in a relationship with Lily, who was Hollis's daughter and therefore Ian's half sister.
- Rigsby is about to tell Grace he's in love with her when a man steps out of the elevator, clearly dating Van Pelt. (Though I don't think we see this guy again.)

“All I’m saying is there are all sorts of people in this world, yeah?” said the slaver named Pit, “All sorts of people make this world go around. There are whores and orphans and tinkerers and geniuses and leaders and followers. It is natural.” Pit, the slaver, waved his arms around as he spoke like a classical composer.

The large circular standing tent, big around enough for several round, waist-high spool tables, was quiet—beyond, through the parted entry flaps which afforded the space with some light, camp chatter was heard; only one other man sat there in the tent with him—the man in leathers, though he wore no leather on this day besides his boots. He was swathed in cotton relax-wear. They shared a table and the man in leathers’ eyes were slitted like he’d only just woken. He winced at his compatriot’s words.

“Come on, Hubal, you wax philosophical every day of the week and here you are, telling me that shit makes you weak.” Pit coughed into his hand, wiped his palm down the front of his leather vest, and continued, “There are people from all walks of life, so there’s bound to be people that enjoy it! I heard even rich folks in Dallas like it sometimes. They hire some whore to come to an otherwise sterile room they’ve rented, and they lay beneath a pane of glass and have the whore shoot their back wad directly across its surface. It's some natural animal instinct, as all things are that humans do, I’m sure.”

Hubal, the man in leathers, shook his head; his attention became half divided between the strange conversation and his handheld tablet. He scanned through a database of names, photographs, bounties; the touch screen responded to his finger touches as he moved through the pillared line of names. Many of the entries on the tablet did not have a photo, but ever since his meeting with the hunchback and clown, he’d been unable to push them from his mind. He’d spoken of his certainty aloud among the other slavers, but many of his band did not consider it worthwhile. He’d scoured the database, entered potential keywords—locations, dates. Many of the names were already marked dead or delivered; besides, the tablet had not been updated since Dallas. Hubal was no bounty-hunter, and his fellow slavers reminded him of this fact daily.

Pit told him already that it was like a thorn in Hubal’s brain; it should be removed.

Pit went on, “I don’t think it’s that strange, for someone to have a fetish like that, do you?”

Without looking up from his tablet, Hubal responded, “Just who are you intending to convince with this nonsense?”

Pit chuckled and rose from his chair, “Want some coffee?”

Hubal nodded, but froze and sat the tablet face down on the spool table’s surface. He snapped his fingers at Pit, “Wash your goddamn hands before you fetch me anything I put in my mouth.”

Again, Pit chuckled and waved his hand. He disappeared from the tent, kicking up a plume of dust-smoke with his boot heels on his way through the entry.

Hubal rotated his thumbs around his temples, leaned over to spit on the dirt floor, then returned to the tablet. Minutes passed in silence as the man scanned the lists of names, photos, descriptions, bounty tags.

Pit returned with two metal mugs; upon brushing past the center support pole of the tent, the whole flimsy structure shook. Hubal shot him a look and Pit grinned broad enough to show his red-eaten gums. Pit passed a mug to Hubal while sipping from his own, and returned to his seat. “The others outside, they’re listening to something from Dallas while we’re still in range. Some choir girls sang for Franklin White at his banquet a few nights ago and they’re still playing the recording on the radio. You should come out and listen to it some.”

“Stupid,” said Hubal.

“The choir girls or the president?”

Hubal fluttered his hand at his fellow slaver, further examined the mug he’d been handed, sipped. “Did you vote for him? I don’t recall casting a ballot. Of course, if I know anything about this world, it is that commerce talks. Communication. Some enforcing apparatus, some cash. It’s a contract.” Hubal, the man in leathers, smirked and traced the tablet and his mug across the table so that he could rest his arms parallel. He leveled over his fists there. “It’s all made up. White’s in the spot he’s in because of it. The whores, as you call them, shit across glass for it. Those girls sing for it. Some communication with the world. Some communication with each other? It is the lay of the land. The absolute truth. It’s what separates you and me from rocks or plants or animals. Behold, these social constructs of the world.”

Pit shook his head. “There you are. I knew you were hiding in there somewhere. Well, I don’t actually care about it at all. I just thought it might do you some good to come outside and mingle. You’ve spent so much time staring at that box that I worry your eyes might waver from squinting that way.” Pit rose again from the table, scanned the makeshift room, and drank from his vessel before scratching behind his head. “So, you saw a clown with no ears, so what?”

“Commerce is what!” said Hubal; he’d pushed his coffee aside entirely and shifted around to better face Pit—his legs occupied open space. He came to his feet so that he hovered over his chair. The man in leathers pointed a finger at Pit, “You and I share a table. We all meet at a table. It is the functions of life that keep us even. You enter this world with the same potential as all the other poor souls that come here. It’s a slap in the face of what I believe down to the very bottom of who I am, understand?” His outstretched finger quivered, and he took notice of this with a glance and evened himself with his hands on his knees.

“Did this guy really piss you off or what?” asked Pit.

Hubal sighed and twisted around on his chair so that his legs were entirely under the table; he angled over and stared at the blank screen of the tablet. “I know that man and the woman he travels with. I almost got the woman, but things happened.” he shrugged.

“How?” Pit straightened; his expression became wholly serious.

“Years ago there was a boy, he wasn’t a clown yet—it’s a tattoo anyway,” Hubal waved his hands at what he believed was a spectacular detail, “He was my uncle’s tender up in Louisville.”

A long silence stretched on between the two men that was only broken when Pit audibly drank from his mug.

Finally, Pit asked, “The boy wasn’t a lovechild, was he?” The question was matter of fact, almost casual.

Hubal winced but shook his head. “When I saw them first in Dallas, I couldn’t place it, but I was drawn to the pair of them like a magnet. Something about them seemed entirely familiar.” The man in leathers began chewing his bottom lip, drumming his fingers across the spool table. He sighed, “Seeing him closer like that, I knew it was him. And that woman that’s with him; she was another of my uncle’s.”

“Was she a love—

“Christ, no! My uncle never kept any children for purposes like that. Don’t you know when to leave a subject alone?”

Pit took another drink only to find his mug empty; he overturned it, his fingers still laced through the handle and shook the inside drier. “I met your uncle Sal once, remember? He seemed nice enough, but there are stories.”

Hubal squinted, snapped a finger at Pit to reach for the leather jacket which hung on the chair nearest the entry flaps. Pit moved there, rifled through the article’s pockets, then returned with a lighter and a pack of cigarettes; these, he offered to the other man. The man in leathers firmly planted a tube into his mouth and lit the opposite end.

After several luxuriated puffs, Hubal continued, “It’s the ears, or lack thereof which has me amiss.”

“Of the clown?”

Hubal slapped his hand across the table firmly, “Yes! Of the clown!” he mocked, “That’s what we’re talking about, yes? Now shut up and listen.” He motioned for Pit to return to the chair across from himself. “Sit and shut up and I’ll tell you.”

Pit nodded, placed his mug mouth down on the table and sat, leaning forward to listen with his cheek placed across his hand.

“Louisville. My uncle. He kept a young boy and a young girl. The boy is the clown. The girl had a twisted back. It’s the same ones. They must be runaways. And although I’ve heard all your rebuttals before, I know, I know, I am no bounty hunter. However, we are slavers, and those pair are escaped slaves. Definitionally—if not morally—we are obliged.”

“How can you be sure?”

“Because,” Hubal toked, “I saw it in their faces that night in Dallas.” He shook his head, idly spit like with hair in his mouth, then rubbed his thumb across his bottom lip to examine the loose tobacco he found there. “Because anytime my uncle caught wind of an unruly one, he took an ear. If the unsatisfactory behavior continued, he took the other. Of course, I can only imagine this clown was unruly indeed.”

“Doesn’t matter,” said Pit.

“Of course it matters.”

Pit smiled—his rotting teeth shone in the glints of light which passed through the entry flaps—and offered up his empty spaced hands, “They’re gone now. I’m sorry, bossman. You should’ve nabbed them back in Dallas. Especially if you were so sure.”

“You see the predicament then. It’s driven me mad, honestly. I should’ve, but there was a nagging part,” he swirled his hand by his head to accentuate the point, “What if I was wrong?”

“And you’re not wrong now?”

“No. I can say with absolute certainty that I know what I’m talking about.”

“Maybe you should contact your uncle.”

 

\*\*\*

 

The space was absent of light with only a bit of sound, like someone rearranging luggage haphazardly—the sound of metallic gear being moved from place to place reverberated through the dark cavern. The thump of hollow containers, the scrape of jewelry-thin chains, the flap of leather straps.

Hoichi’s sightless eyes stood open and darted soundlessly around, but he did not move from where he lay on the cool hard stone.

The Nephilim rummaged through Hoichi’s scattered gear; the thing’s eyes did not need light to see and so, even cast in absolute dark as they were, The Nephilim shifted around from the mess he’d made, noticed Hoichi’s eyes open and lumbered across the space between them and lowered himself to the ground to look in the face of the man. The Nephilim grinned and spoke, *Du bist wach.* The clown flinched at the words, scrambled from his prone position and slammed into the curved wall of the cavern behind him.

Hoichi’s mouth trembled even while his jaw remained clenched hard. “Where’s my clothes?” asked the clown; he was indeed naked. His things were all stripped from him.

*English then?* Asked The Nephilim.

“English? Goddammit, where’re my clothes?”

*Taken. No clothes. No weapons. No hiding.* The Nephilim smiled, but Hoichi could not see. That great beast stilted back on his heels and puffed out his chest and stared down at the small clown.

Hoichi swallowed, kept his hands around himself and his knees pulled to his chest while he sat on the stone. “What’s all this about then? What do you want? Why’s it so cold? Where am I?”

*Shh,* shushed The Nephilim, *Good clown. Ruhig.* Pivoting, he returned to the gear to rummage then moved back to the clown with a flashlight. He held the thing between two fingers, fiddled with the device, clicked the switch on the tube then rolled it across the stone floor to the feet of the clown.

Hoichi scrambled for the light, blinking sporadically at its presence, then angled it around to catch his captor in the dull white beam. The clown yelped, dropped the light, and went after it to pull it up again into the face of The Nephilim. The creature held his palm across his eyes and motioned for the clown to lower the light.

Instead of directing the light towards the stone floor, Hoichi dragged the beam across the ceiling, showing dull brown sandstone; they were beneath the earth. “Where are we?” he asked.

*Underground,* said The Nephilim.

“Underground? Underground where? What is this place? Why’d you bring me here?” Within the peripheral ring of the flashlight, Hoichi’s face glistened with sweat despite the cool air of the cavern.

*Shh.* The Nephilim pointed a long index finger towards some unseen direction swallowed up by darkness and said, *Closed there. Big rock.* The Nephilim shrugged and grinned and shifted the long hair from his face. The beast nodded in the direction opposite, *You go. You’re essential.*

“Essential? What do you need from me?” Hoichi, seemingly noticing how exposed he was for the first time, attempted to keep the light from his own body so that he remained in shadow.

*Underground,* the creature pointed at the stone under their feet, *Big power. It vibrates. It’s loud. All over.* The Nephilim smacked his lips and grinned again at his captive.

“We need to go down? Why?” Hoichi shivered and his eyes shifted around in the dark and froze to stare in the direction of where The Nephilim had only moments before pointed and said, *Closed there.*

The Nephilim straightened and his great body stretched like foul taffy till his head almost reached the rock overhead. Hoichi shrank without saying a word. *Don’t run,* said the beast, *You run? You’re dead.*

“Are you trying to make a deal with me?” asked the clown, “I’ve heard of how your sort make deals with people all the time. It’s in all kinds of stories.”

The Nephilim threw his head back and laughed; his voice carried off then resounded so that by the time he stopped, the laughter arrived again. With a cocked head, a queer twinkle in his eye which danced as he examined his captive’s face, that great beast lowered himself near to where the clown was, so the flashlight’s beam cut harsh angles across his features—a long finger pointed towards the shadows. *You go. Go now.*

Hoichi bit onto his lips to stop them trembling then shook his head, “You’re a demon, aren’t you? You’re a demon and you’re going to lead me to hell.” His words were hesitant and came with very little conviction.

With haste, The Nephilim impatiently gripped the clown’s arm and shoved him down the way, in the direction he intended for them, and the flashlight bobbed as Hoichi staggered over his own feet. Keeping himself upright, he twisted around to look at the beast, once more bit his lips shut, then nodded and began walking.

The Nephilim followed the clown deeper into the cavern.

1i049w6,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1i049w6/how_bitter_should_good_espresso_be/,How bitter should good espresso be?,"I've recently started my journey down the espresso rabbit hole. I don't currently own any espresso equipment nor ever used one before (besides a Nespresso, but not really counting that). Currently researching but I'm heavily thinking about the Flair classic lever. I really like black coffee, and espresso drinks. 

  
To the point of my post, I went to a local coffee shop / roaster today and decided to try an espresso shot. It was in my opinion EXTREMELY bitter (and I enjoy quite a few bitter things, including a regular coffee). I've never tasted battery acid but this is what I would imagine it tasting like. There were no other coffee type flavors I would expect to have in some way. I also had an espresso shot at a very nice dinner place last night, and that was way better than the coffee shop one.  It was actually drinkable straight, yes bitter some but more of what ""I would expect"". I wouldn't say I loved it, but it was ""okay"", even though I have only had a few espresso shots straight

**My questions:**

* How bitter is ""good"" espresso supposed to be?
   * I always enjoy my coffee black, is it supposed to be somewhat similar to the ""range"" of coffee bitterness (from no bitterness, to a little bit, to a high but ""pleasant"" bitterness?)
* Can you order espresso shots in any sort of way so it's not so bitter from a coffee shop, or is it just whatever their version of an espresso shot is what you get?
* Is a flair classic a good starter espresso maker?
   * I've done a lot of research, and I think having full control of all variables to create your perfect espresso is what I'm looking for. I don't think I'd mind the extra time and effort for a manual machine. ",4,1736736866.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

I go to the same little cafe 4, sometimes 5 days a week to get coffee and read a book by myself. I enjoy it a lot. I'd been doing it for about 2 months by this point when I noticed a woman and her two friends, none of whom I'd never seen before, walk in. The only reason it stood out to me was since it was such a small, hole in the wall type of place, you recognize the few faces who actually come around. Expected to probably never see them again, maybe one more time, that's how it usually is with new customers. Except it wasn't that way, the one girl kept coming. Seems like she was there every day I was. After about 2 weeks, she started coming up to me and chatting with me. ""What're you reading?"" ""How's your day?"" stuff like that. But in the past 15ish times I've gone, it's been every single time. And it's just the way she looks at me, like there's a really good movie playing in my eyes that she cannot take her eyes off, it's odd, I don't think anyone's ever looked at me like that. I was wondering if she's into me? Now truthfully, I'm not positive with how I feel about her, it's dependent on the day. Some days she's more nosy than others, some days she's nicer, some less. I've consulted friends, but I feel like their opinions are a tad biased in my favor since they're my friends. So I figured I'd ask some strangers. What do you think?

So I’ve been talking to this guy I matched with on Tinder and our conversation was pretty much flowing so we exchanged IGs. From IG we start talking about general stuff (travel etc.) and then I asked him what he’s into (sexually or not) - he basically gave me a laundry list of stuff and I was like oh okay hot ;) would love to know what I’m working with. Anyways we moved the convo to Snapchat for a bit and we started sexting and jerking off together. He was just saying how I attractive I was and that he couldn’t wait to see me and he found my body to be super sexy. After that we were just having a mix of spicy/sexual convos and other general convos (plans for the week and stuff) and we started saving sexy snaps from each other. We eventually agreed to meet a week after during the weekend just because we were going to be at the same place (we’re almost an hour away from each other). He kept pretty much reiterating how he couldn’t wait to meet up sooner than later while we were  messaging.

We agreed to meet at a large bus/train station with restaurants and shops and basically he proposed a super early time which I stuck to but then he was almost an hour late. I’m like okay no worries. He shows up, we hit up a few stores in a nearby mall (I had to get a birthday gift for a friend, with some other friend that was gonna join me, after meeting up with him) since he decided he wanted to help me out a bit and then we decided to chill at a coffee shop. The convo was going pretty much and we were talking about general life stuff again in more depth (travelling, jobs, family etc.) and he says he has to leave to get back home at a certain time as he mentioned to me before. He then asks me to walk him back to the station so that we can chitchat further and I told him I was planning to meet my friend in the mall but I messaged my friend and asked her to meet me at the station (she needed to transit through the station anyways before getting to the mall). He says he has to run to catch his train so he asks me if I would be upset if he ran and I was like of course not and my friend tells me she’s almost there. He hugs me and starts running so I start running after him but we’re running in the same direction (I’m just trying to catch up with my friend). He knew I was gonna be busy for the rest of the day so I told myself he’ll probably message me when he’s on the train or back home. Time passes and he doesn’t message me and I go shopping with my friend for the gift and attend a birthday dinner after. I never got a response back so while I was heading home I decided to scroll through our chat and I see all saved snaps between us were deleted. He basically gave me the hint that he wasn’t interested so I just removed him off Snap when I got home.

My question is what’s up with the mixed signals? Am I overthinking this by him asking me to walk him to the station to get some more time with me at the end but then him ghosting me? I’m definitely here to rant a bit also just wanted to know if anyone has had any similar experiences. Thanks all!",1,1736736633.0,askgaybros,1,1.0,False

1i046pb,https://www.reddit.com/r/FeminineMen/comments/1i046pb/what_are_your_hair_removal_adventures/,What are your hair removal adventures?,"Fam,

Have you experimented or succeeded with hair removal?  What brought you on that journey?  What works and what doesn't?

I had shaved my legs a few times before jumping off into the deep end.  I did it for a token experience of what women experience.  The shaving took FOREVER, like 40 minutes, I made a mess, nicked myself a few times and overall was unimpressed with how poorly face shaving translated to leg shaving.  I tried waxing, but only made it to my knees before I decided I'd had enough.

As I further explored my femininity, I realized I enjoyed having smooth legs--I thought they looked sexy and no one has really complained (too much). I bought the Braun Silk·expert Pro 5 IPL (was/is on sale) based on all of the reviews.  Once a week I shave and then use the IPL.  My efficiency has improved over the last few months, about 10 to 15 minutes to shave, 10 minutes to IPL (whatever the verb should be), and then lotion.  The day after I use a homemade brown sugar, coconut oil, and honey (and sometimes coffee) exfoliate.  I considered professional hair removal, but $6k is too steep for my blood, especially if this is really just an experimentation.

**Pointers:**

* Don't IPL your tattoos
* your legs have surprisingly more contours than you previously thought causing you to use the IPL in a variety of angles
* The first few times will take a while (40 minutes)
* There is a skin and hair chart, the more the contrast between hair color and skin the higher the probability IPL will work for you
* Leg razors work WAY better than face razors on legs
* Change out your razors monthly (or every other month) depending on your hair removal battle
* Shaving lotion/cream/etc work quite well (I've previously used only water a few times when shaving my face and running late)
* Over each week my stomach hair grew back quite aggressively and I received complaints it made my belly itchy.  I'm trying to grow my stomach hair back so it's not so itchy (lots of focused concentration and grunting)

**Fingers Crossed!**  After a few months my legs remain smooth. I go the entire month of February without shaving to see how much returns. Stupidly, I've come to enjoy shaving, so now I have to find something else to do that feels feminine and sexy.  Also, I have lower contrasting hair/skin combo, so I am afraid that my hair will grow right back in February.

I am excited to hear what adventures y'all have had or are planning!",1,1736736565.0,FeminineMen,0,0.99,False

""The EPA regulates tap water under strict guidelines, while bottled water is loosely monitored by the FDA,"" I told my coworkers on break_ last Thursday.

They are all lazy and take too many unofficial coffee/cigarette breaks_ and they aren't very nice to me, always saying mean things.  

We work at a bottled water adjacent company and_ get free bottled water sometimes, as a perk (I never drink it_ and just bring my own tap water from home).

""Bottled water is also significantly more expensive and less sustainable,"" I tried explaining, but they all just laughed at me and made fun of my big nose and flatulence issues. 

Others employees was running they mouth about how I never drink the free bottled water, so I boiled laxative chocolates in the microwave and dumped that water in the coffee maker_ (cause all the free water perps drink the free coffee too). 

I might have overdone it, but it was extremely effective. A few people went home, and I lied about also shitting and took up one of the stalls_ while I laughed and scrolled on my phone. 

Now I am the one who laughed, because I made them all shit. They still don't know it was me who caused the shitting_ and I've been joking that maybe it was something in the water.

I found a nasty shit pair of whitey tightlies in the bathroom trash_ and now it's framed at my house on the art as wall. 

Thanks for your time. Your all shit too_ if you drink bottled water. Your all fucking stuprd, lazy shit lol_ mostly uneducated.

We agreed to wake up early most days to be able to enjoy the the trip. However, in his typical fashion he didn't stick to this agreement. For nearly two months I was upset with this. And each time I said anything he said that I was berating him, or he ignored me. Yet, he complained whenever we would be out late in the day. Something which was a result of not getting up earlier and leaving late most days. He took this out on me and and failed to aknowledge this. Now for the past few days he is trying to get up earlier and we have planned to get back earlier. But both days we have been held up, in large part by my mother frequently stopping for bathroom and smoke breaks. He aknowledges it's her primarily making us take longer but still takes it out on me. He also agrees to go places and do things, only to complain later on. 

Today all three of us left around 11:30am with the hopes of getting back around 5pm. We wanted to come back to sell things which we need to do. We went to get coffee and that took longer than it should. My mother goes elsewhere to get her coffee and takes a smoke break each time. We sat for a while after as we usually do, mainly because we are waiting on my mother or deciding where to go. It was past 12pm when I put in a destination. A shopping center that is 20mins away. I went into five stores all next to each other for no more than 5mins each. My mother took longer than I did. It was 1pm maybe a bit later when we left. We talked a little bit about something I was wanting to buy for both of us and that took some time. I then went to a Walmart which I was no more than 5 mins in. I went in to check for something that they didn't have. My mother stayed in longer than I did and we had to wait on her. We then went to target which was 10 mins away. I took the longest in there roughly 15mins. After that we went 20mins away to another shopping center. I took 5mins in the store there. 

When I came out we talked a bit about what to get to eat. It was nearing 3:30pm at that point. He said he wanted a particular place. The closest locations were both 30mins away. I had a few places left I wanted to go to being a tjmaxx, marshalls, and a fry's marketplace. I said if we went to one of the two places we could get everything done rather quickly, that they were all near one another. He chose where we went because it was 20mins opposed to 40mins back to the house. When we got there it was 4pm. We ate for 30mins and then went to the tjmaxx which was 7mins away. When we got there he was asking me if that was the last place and seemed annoyed. I said no and that I was going to Marshalls and fry's. He said he forgot about those and could I leave Marshalls. That it was almost 5pm. I said I would leave Marshalls. I noticed there was a Walmart 5mins away and I asked if I could quickly stop there before going to fry's. I wanted to run in and check for what I'm searching for. He agreed to going there. 

On the way to Walmart he asked me if I would get groceries there instead of going to fry's. I said I would see if that had what I was getting. He kept asking me wanting me to just say yes. We went in and I looked for the item I'm after. They didn't have it and they were very busy. My anxiety was being triggered. I knew that even if my stuff was there it would take me quite some time to do a shop. I said that we should leave and go to fry's. We had only been in there a few minutes. He told me to at least go and look at the groceries, that my mother was already over there. I went and found a few items but none of the rest. I said I still needed to go to fry's. He was frustrated and asked me why I got the few things then, why I didn't just leave. I said I tried to and he told me to take a look. That I couldn't have left anyways as my mother was shopping. He told me I went back on my agreement. I said that it was him who did that because he knew I was going to fry's. That I told him I likely wouldn't be able to do a shop in Walmart. That I was right and it wasted time. 

We left the store and he started arguing with me about getting back later than planned. It was 5:40pm. I said that I wasn't the one holding us up. That I had been quick all day. He aknowledged it was my mother but kept taking it out on me. He then started complaining about driving too much and going too many places. When he agreed to going to all of them, and hadn't said anything until after it was past 5pm. I asked why agree to go to the place that was 30mins away then. Why take 30mins to eat. Why expect me to just up and leave the last few things I was doing as it seemed like he was. He said I wasn't listening, that I wasn't understanding.  When he didn't seem to be listening to me whatsoever instead chewing my head off for having driven so much, and about getting back past 5pm. 

This is how it's always been. He agrees to do things, goes along with them in the moment, and then gets angry and takes it out on me. I'm not even sure it it was where we went or how many places we went to, if it wasn't just the getting back past 5pm. For all the mornings he woke up late, and left late, compared to the few days we intended to get back earlier and didn't. He is taking it out on me far more than I did him. Why agree in the first place? Is it enjoyable for him to agree and act okay with it and then go off at me after the fact? I don't get it. He won't aknowledge that I did try to quickly get things done, that I was paying attention to the time, that I left going to Marshalls, and that I did attempt to do my grocery shop at Walmart. 

He is saying now that he isn't going out to get dinner as we planned. That he's not going anywhere tomorrow. That he's not going on a planned trip we were going on in a few days. That I should get somewhere else to drive me, that no one else would. Or that I should learn to drive myself. He says I don't understand because I don't drive. He thinks he's right because he's driven a lot, something which I aknowledge he's done, but that he is agreeing to each time. It's because I won't take the blame and accept this from him that he won't stop. ",0,1736736536.0,AmIOverreacting,2,0.5,False

And lastnight I slept really bad, I couldn’t fall asleep until 5AM, due to a racing mind and hunger. I slept until about 10:00 AM but had woken up every hour.

When I woke up, I had a headache and low energy. I figured breakfast and milk/coffee would help. But after I ate, I got worse. A few hours later, I was eventually unable to even move. I was shaking slightly, slightly dizzy, slight tunnel vision, slight nausea, and a bad headache (I never get headaches). It got to the point where I couldn’t even move and it felt like a really bad hangover but I don’t drink. I couldn’t go to sleep due to the coffee/milk I just had. 

It got so bad, I almost went to the hospital because I was worried I was gonna die. But I don’t have health insurance currently, so I’d rather die than go to the hospital and have them take me for all I’m worth.

This lasted a couple of hours until I finally decided maybe I had low blood sugar, I ate a chocolate and basically instantly felt better. 

I am slightly skinny but muscular. I’ve been trying to eat a lot and put on weight, but haven’t had much luck. 3 meals a day is too much to keep up with. I usually eat 1 big meal a day, with other calories/snacking throughout the day. I haven’t been counting calories, but I typically feel like I’m eating enough. 

I eat mostly real food, such as red meat, eggs, rice, bananas, avocados, and avoid processed foods like the plague.

Was this a low blood sugar episode? Or just sugar withdrawal? Or am I possibly nutrient deficient somehow? Am I not eating enough despite my efforts? Is sugar necessary if I’m eating other carbs?",1,1736736448.0,AskDocs,2,1.0,False

Prologue: 1908-1953

-Born to middle class and went to Lachaven business school 

“His father would come home and terrorize his mother and him. I think talking his way out of his fathers wrath is where his silver tongue came from. If he didn’t go into politics he would have been a great salesman! He never looked back once he got to Lachaven. He burned every letter from his parents, and I think he only regretted it after his mother died.”

-Interview with Monica Rayne in “Anton Rayne: The Father of Sordish Democracy” 1985

-Protested Luderin’s coup and held his ground 

“When they charged I stood my ground, I was lucky they didn’t kill me. What no one tells you about broken ribs is how much it hurts to speak, probaby the quietest I’ve ever been.”

-A Radical Interveiw with Rayne in 1953

-Joined student council 

“After the protests Anton only grew more opposed to authoritarianism, but he got smarter about it. He stayed away from those street brawlers, he used his charisma and joined the student council to push for greater student participation in the budget.”

-“Alongside a Hero” by Petr Vectern, 1977

-Met Monica, didn’t much care for women’s rights 

“A student rally was where he and Monica met, he liked her diligence in organizing her sororities' support, although he didn’t care much about that ladies' crusade of hers at the time.”

-“Alongside a Hero” by Petr Vectern, 1977

-He voted for Soll

“I can’t believe I used to support the [Redacted], Member of honor, my foot. I’m sure he's the secret puppet master behind Alphonso’s fall. I KNOW IT.”

	-Recorded by a bug in the 1953 Rayne Campaign office placed by Lucian Galade 

-He faithfully served in Bergia and sent the refugees back.

“I could see how you chafed at the hierarchy, and lack of oversight for abuse. But you were a good soldier under my command, you respected me for my fairness. I think that's why you did it”

-Iosef Lancea in response to Rayne recounting escorting refugees back to Wehlen despite moral reservations, Interview with Sordland Today, 1963

-Began working for USP because he wanted to fix the country

“I remember meeting Anton, I was a young clerk in the Central Bank, and Anton was an aide in the Economy ministry. He was endlessly diligent and was a favorite of his superiors as a result. We didn’t speak much, but we got along. Who would have thought of the places we'd go?”

-Interview with Symon Holl in “Anton Rayne: The Father of Sordish Democracy” 1985

-Accepted Solls MP offer gladly, sacrificing family for work

“He went off the deep end when Soll made him an MP. We all know how good of a husband I was, and I was the one who had to tell him to go home to his family.”

	-“Alongside a Hero” by Petr Vectern, 1977 

-Watched from the sidelines, took Solls deal and voted for him

 “I knew he liked Alphonso, but he didn’t want to get caught on the wrong side if things went sideways. He told me about Soll’s deal with him and said it was the insurance policy he thought he needed.”

-“Alongside a Hero” by Petr Vectern, 1977

 -Campaigned for Alphonso

“I was very surprised by the result, but very pleased, from the moment I heard I threw all my energy into making sure Alphonso won. It was probably the biggest election upset in USP history.”

-From “A War of Words”, Rayne’s Autobiography, 1978

-He worked to make Sordland better

“Rayne the Giant Slayer”

-Caption of a political cartoon in a 1947 issue of the Radical depicting Rayne fighting a giant labeled “corruption”

-He advised Alphonso to step down because of the recession 

“I knew when he advised me to go it was all over, if he was telling me to go it meant the rest of the party probably wanted me gone too. He’s careful like that. I’ve never felt more defeated.”

-Ewald Alphonso in an interview with the Lachaven Times, 1953

-he promised to enact democratic reforms, align west, promote free markets, reform education, and relax immigration.

“People of Sordland, the time for reform is not over! Sordland is sick! Let me be its doctor! I promise to democratize our system, I will keep the hands of unelected and self-serving bureaucrats from strangling you! That is not all, I will revitalize our rotten education system, no longer will the darkness of ignorance blind your children to those who cheat them! Furthermore I will bring us closer to Angolia, Lespia and our western brethren to rebuild Sordland’s trade relations. Sordland was once great, and it can be made great again! A MORGNA WES CORE!”

-Rayne at a Narbel campaign rally in 1953

Chapter One: Drastic Economic Action, 1954

	-Symon Holl in a press conference on the decision, 1954

-Didn’t buy Armandine Stock

“Gus offered an opportunity to buy stock in a radio company today, turned him down. The slimy crook wouldn't be in my here if I didn’t think I needed the bridge between my administration and Alphonso’s”

-“Presidential Journal of Anton Rayne: 1954” edited by Deana & Monica Rayne, published 1985

-Visited protesters in person

“He shook my hand and said to me, “Son, it will all get better I promise, hold tight, stay out of trouble, and steer clear of people selling a quick fix and I promise it will get better.” I was fifteen then, and I’m proud to say I took his advice, without him I probably would of joined the Young Sords and had my head kicked in in some street fight. President Rayne was a real man of the people. I owe my life to him.”

	-Rudolf Sacwin, mourner at Rayne’s State Funeral, 1984

-Didn’t take Tusks bribe

“Good knowing what Lotherberg thinks. Smug as he is he is a valuable asset, good taste in cigars too. But he needs to learn the rules, no bribes. Bribery is abhorrent, let alone the risk. Underhall might be a good choice if only to build trust with Lotherberg.”

-“Presidential Journal of Anton Rayne: 1954” edited by Deana & Monica Rayne, published 1985

-Authorized a business bailout 

“The people have not been forgotten, this was a decision made for the people, what use is one measly stimulus check if your employer goes bankrupt.”

	-Rayne in a radio address, 1954

-Chose Underhall for the L-1 project.

“The Administration is very happy with the work Underhall can do, they have a respectable volume of work. They can allow us to maintain our economic aims while still ensuring the Sordish economy benefits, better than having billions disappear into foreign bank accounts.”

-Gus Manger at a press conference following the decision, 1954

-Didn’t take Koronti’s Deal

“Didn’t trust the look in the bastard's eye, too smug and too threatening, if he’s that blunt while pretending to do me a favor I hate to imagine what happens if I end up owing him? Probably will kill me if I cross him.”

-“Presidential Journal of Anton Rayne: 1954” edited by Deana & Monica Rayne, published 1985

-He attended the Circas funeral, allowed the red youth to stay but put guards on them

“I reasoned that it wasn’t unusual that Red Youth members would be at their leader's funeral, and it was unlikely to be assassins. But I thought I was better safe than sorry and had Mr. Greiser put some guards on them. I was on edge the whole funeral.”

-From “A War of Words”, Rayne’s Autobiography, 1978

-Closed the Rumburg consulate 

“It was a hard decision, but I decided that I need to present a strong front against their aggression in the hopes they would cease it. I was disappointed to find I was wrong.”

-From “A War of Words”, Rayne’s Autobiography, 1978

-Signed the tourism act

“Lounge on the beaches of Benfi, Hike the forests of Laren, Take in the Mountain vistas of Narbel, Sip whisky in Erlory, shop in a Holsord bazaar.”

	-Poster in Lespia as part of the “Seeing Sordland” Tourist campaign, 1954

-Declined Hawkers demand to declare an emergency

“Hawker and Garaci visited today, tried to threaten me and convince me to betray the republic. More proof of the Old Guard Octopus strangling this land. Must keep an eye on them.”

-“Presidential Journal of Anton Rayne: 1954” edited by Deana & Monica Rayne, 1985

-Invested in Gascom alone and negotiated better housing for workers

“He told the public it was a move of “Sordish Protectionism”, and in fairness it was. But it was also because he was suspicious of Rizia, their ties to Rumburg worried him. He mentioned while briefing me about the meeting that he thought it was a Rummish ploy to undermine us. Quite typical of him.”

-“Alongside a Hero” by Petr Vectern, 1977

-Successfully talked down the protest, cheer as he left

“It is to me the quintessential example of his charisma, some have said that it was no great feat. How else would a crowd react if you gave them what they've spent years fighting for? But they weren't there, the rabid strikers and melenyevists turned placid as lambs within minutes, I’d never seen such a fast change in a crowd.”

	-Interview with Gus Manger in “Anton Rayne: The Father of Sordish Democracy” 1985

-Didn’t ban any political groups

“Restricting the right of others to assemble and protest their government will only lead to armed resistance, without an outlet for one's frustrations armed resistance is the only recourse one has. Our country enshrines free speech in law, and we must uphold these fine Nur given rights.”

-Television address by Rayne, 1954

-Vetoed G.R.E.E.N Act

	“The cause is admirable, but a recession is the wrong time to pass this law.”

	-Official memo to the assembly on the veto, 1954

-Proposed a new constitution with the following changes: Vetoes overridden by supermajority, Supreme Court loses vote, impeachment by majority of assembly and supreme court, confidence vote for ministers, 8% election threshold, decrees require enabling act, two term limit, Supreme Court may be impeached.

“Nia spoke at length trying to convince Anton not to remove the judges immunity. He could taste the blood of the old guard and his conquest of them though, so in it went.”

	-“Alongside a Hero” by Petr Vectern, 1977

-Didn’t promise tax cuts to Tusk

“Tusk appears to be learning, no bribe this time. A tad demanding, and gave me a veiled threat when I refused, but he is playing the game. I need to be careful, he may be a threat if I keep going against him.”

-“Presidential Journal of Anton Rayne: 1954” edited by Deana & Monica Rayne, 1985

-Increased foreign EPA investment limit to 49%

“I was very happy with the decision. After the consulate incident and his refusal to partner with Rizia I grew concerned that he would drag Sordland into isolation with an inability to compromise with foreign countries. I spent several nights sleepless with worry. Catherine was very worried I might have another heart attack. But Rayne took the middle ground, it showed he was willing to open ourselves up to other countries.”

-From “A Life of Service”, Deivid Wisci’s Autobiography, 1960

-New Budget: Education, Law & Order, and Military increased, healthcare maintained.

“Still almost twenty five years later I can recall how ill Symon looked when I put forward the budget plan, in one fell swoop I had plunged Sordland into massive debt. I thought he might vomit right there. I spoke to a secretary later that day and she said he had returned from the meeting and then locked himself in his office for half an hour. Looking back I can see just how precarious things were economically, I am very sorry Symon, I shouldn’t have put a friend through that.”

-Made teaching evolution mandatory but didn’t ban creationism

“This law is a slap in the face of our traditional values, we are sick of big city folks who have never done an honest day's work telling our children what is right, mandatory evolution education is no compromise.

-Argued Bluds are Sords before the law

-Vetoed UELA

“He was a devoted assimilationist, but he thought the NFP was rushing the integration of the Bluds and were going to botch it by stirring up too much tension.

-Created the fair trade and competition commission, radio & television commission, and began the free medicine program

“Many of you know exactly what is wrong with you, but simply can’t afford treatment. What a travesty! We are making sure that changes. Furthermore, my dedication to integrity and truth has continued.

	-Patricio Alvarez in a address to Lespia on the alliance, 1956

-Had Livia arrested and shouldered the blame with Petr

“I never saw him angrier, not only had I committed adultery, something he hated, but I had compromised national security. I think my saving grace was ironically Lucian’s bugs. They uncovered Livia, and he was grateful for that, but finding out Lucian was secretly recording his co-workers was the beginning of his souring on Lucian.”

-“Alongside a Hero” by Petr Vectern, 1977

-Chose Albin Clavin as new VP

“I’ll admit I came to regret this choice, I suspected the man he was and asked the ACP if they’d found anything, but they hadn’t uncovered his corruption yet so I thought he was a good choice compared to the other options.”

-Deivid Wisci to reporters while meeting with Arcasian diplomats, 1956

-Debt crisis hit

“It was the tensest moment in those four years, especially in my ministry. During the worst of it the economic reports were out of date just days after being finished.

-Interview with Symon Holl in “Anton Rayne: The Father of Sordish Democracy” 1985

-Signed minority rights act 

“President Rayne has proved himself willing to stand against the laws and systems that have artificially kept us divided, this will be a turning point!”

-Mansoun Leke in a interview, 1957

-Vetoed Human dignity act

“I honestly don’t know why he didn’t veto it, he was a devout Dastnurist and fired one of the maids when she got pregnant, and he turned the presidential guards upside down looking for the father. Maybe he wanted to consolidate the liberal vote, but then again he didn’t stop seeing Petr after the scandal. But many things about papa were a mystery to me.”

-Interview with Deana Marki in “Anton Rayne: The Father of Sordish Democracy” 1985

-Vetoed children's future bill

-Approached the Rummish plane incident with diplomacy 

“I regret to inform you of the death of Neil Rothard, an air force pilot killed when his jet was shot down over Sordish territory by Rumburg. Rumburg has claimed he was over their territory.

-Address to the public by Rayne, 1957

-Declined joining the ATO

“I am happy that the promise he made in 1957 held true. He told me if he won reelection he would happily join us but he thought it simply too big before an election – a logic I can’t fault. Sordland is better for his wise leadership.”

-President Dwight Walker in a speech to the ATO on Sordland’s entry, 1960

-Had Graf arrested, but not all Old Guard

“I’d never seen him more manic, all his years of being called paranoid were vindicated. Lucian told me later that he’d narrowly talked him out of purging all of the old guard from the government. He settled for Graf’s head but wasn’t happy with it completely.”

-Interview with Monica Rayne in “Anton Rayne: The Father of Sordish Democracy” 1985

-Achieved a Mixed Economy

“People of Sordland, I am ashamed to tell you that the recession still persists. Our infrastructure remains lackluster, unemployment is still steady at 16% – far too high. The economy has only grown by a few billion ren. You suffer greatly from this, and I promise that if you reelect me I will fix these issues. But not all is wrong! Our debt is 117 billion ren lower and inflation has dropped to 2%, the lowest ever in our history! We have built strong trade relationships with our neighbors while protecting Sordish industries, in fact they have never been more productive. Sordish Protectionism has shown its superiority to Alfonso's reckless Arcasian Capitalism and Soll’s stifling Autarky! Holsord wasn’t built in a day, and neither can the sleeping giant of the Sordish economy be awakened in just one term. A MORGNA WES CORE!”

-Rayne in Holsord campaign rally, 1957

-Had a successful interview with Sacker, Rumburg expelled from OMEC

“This is a terrible injustice upon us, the world refuses to see Rayne as the snake he is! We will not lie down, my loyal subjects I will ensure Rumburg is not overtaken by the imperialism of Sordland!

-Queen Beatrice Livingston in an address to her people, 1957

-Held a military parade 

“I was very lucky to run into president Rayne again four years later when I was a young recruit, but I don't think I made a good impression, I dropped my rifle and General Lancea gave a scolding for the ages.”

-Rudolf Sacwin, mourner at Rayne’s State Funeral, 1984

“It was a decision based in my worry of a coup by the old guard in response to my arrest of Ms. Graf, I admit my wrongdoing and hope we can move past this.”

	-Rayne in a press conference after Lucian Galade exposed Rayne during the formers trial, 1960

-AN supported Sordland 

“The AN has shown its devotion to peace with these actions, we are grateful for the quick investigation of our concerns.”

-Response to the decision from the Sordish Foreign Ministry, 1957 

-Promised greater security in his next term.

	“Promise of Security too little to late, 15 murdered by Young Sord thugs”

	-Headline in “Se Bludrat Ocar” (The Bludish Eye),  1957

-He won a second term, NFP won second and PFJP third, CPS won some seats but the Blud vote was decided and neither party won seats

I also did a glucose challenge test which showed high insulin (cant recall the name but you drink sugar water over 3hrs and have your blood taken). my LF CGM device has showed the following which i find strange:
- low glucose (3.7mmol/l) 5x during the night - was not sleeping on my side, woke up and monitored it and it continued to be low for 2hrs.
- 7.7 glucose upon waking
- drinking coffee and unsweetened soy milk dropped this to 5
- 7.8 on fasted morning run
- zero sugar/low carb whey protein shake spiked from 5.5 to 9
- eating carbs (orange, cereal, corn chips) results in my glucose falling 
- going for a walk after eating results in my glucose rising
the above seems the opposite of what should happen based on my (limited) understanding of blood sugar and insulin. i will obviously make an appt with my doctor to discuss, but if anyone has any idea whats happening to me i would be curious to know in the meantime. thanks in advance.

I enjoyed staying at Southernmost and loved being so close to Cuban coffee/breakfast, the banana cafe, the butterfly house etc. However I do remeber the beach being just OK and we mostly just hung out at the pool. 

I want to make sure I’m not missing out on something even better just because I’m more familiar with one side of the island over the other. 

I know old town is all pretty walkable and it’s easy enough for us to get to both sides, but If you had to pick one resort for the weekend, which would you choose and why? 

Appreciate any advice from people who know the area well! Thanks!

Coffee sit there for long time, and they serve it to you an old brew coffee with no more flavor. Or they serve a regular roast and add in it some espresso.

A good fresh coffee has a really good taste, what about tim publicity, fresh brew coffe every 20 minutes, we serve fresh and good or not at all !! It is a total lie.
Tim horton is no more the way it was few years ago, where quality of coffe and food made thier name.

Totally unrespecfull to do that to people who still pay full price. Just tell it my coffe is made since over an hour before serving it and adding some artificial flavor.. seriously. At this point close the shop.

Not too many orders today, so we've been to a few places: Goodwill, where she found a few dresses she liked, and an antique mall with lots of booths. Our last stop was at another antique mall, which prompted the #todayilearned post.

Today I learned that EarthBound, the SNES game I played as a kid (and lost), is currently owned by my girlfriend. (I forgot she had this, to be honest.) As we strolled through the mall, we came across a booth with retro games and consoles. (Finally, our type of nerdy!) Lo and behold, in the center of the display case, we see it: ""EarthBound Tested and authentic SNES cartridge $400 obo.""

My girlfriend said, ""Why is that game so much?"" and I replied, ""I don't know. Let me message my buddy and see what he says."" So I sent my friend a pic and asked, ""Why, though?"" He responded, ""Because it be,"" and I said, ""Alright then."" Then I told her, and she exclaimed, ""Oh, cool. Fuck  Kansas!™️ money!"" and I replied, ""Fuck yeah!"" Then my edible kicked in.

I (31F) got diagnosed with a brain tumor in 2023 , it has severely affected my vision & I am no longer allowed to drive. Recently my older sister 37F has lent her vehicle to our other sister (36F) who has been having car issues, she’s had it for about 2 weeks now. Now older sister (37F) who lives in the apt above me.. keeps asking to borrow my car to go to the store, gas station, coffee shop what have you. I’ve said yes EVERY time... 3 days ago she borrowed my car to go out to eat at a restaurant. She came home, parked the car and went into her apartment. Now it’s 3 days later (today) , &  she still hadn’t returned my key .. has come down into our apt to bring us (my mom & I) things over the last few days .. mail, food etc and didn’t bring the key… (and YES i have a spare so I was able to go out with my mom driving us if needed.) Tonight she texts me and asks to borrow my car overnight. I replied with a frustrated answer & she told me nevermind. I then asked her to bring my key & she did but not without BIG attitude. Now .. AITAH for not wanting her to take my car overnight? AITAH for wanting my car key back? Does this not seem planned out.. ?? Lol .

For your consideration: A sleeve of ten Vertuo capsules is about us$15, some cost much more, some a bit less. A household with two coffee drinkers, who brew two cups per day, will consume 120 capsules in a month, 1440 capsules in a year. The math is inescapable: that is $2000/year, much more if the household orders limited editions and super premium capsules. The Original system, slightly less expensive per capsule, offers no real savings because the household might brew twice as many of those tiny shots. 

 Third party OL capsules are not in play here because they’re mostly undrinkable. 

And not everyone who loves good coffee likes Nespresso output. There are so many other ways to brew great coffee. Grinding fresh beans from your local roster, faffing about with a sophisticated drip brewer, Aeropress, pour over, or espresso system is not for everyone,true, but the coffee is unbelievably superior and far less expensive.

I've been applying to entry-level jobs on Indeed/company websites and other job listings through emails 2 days out of every week since February 2024, I've only had one interview for a waitress position at a restaurant that I've heard nothing back from in months. I've applied to everything from Walmart, fast food places, Kennel work, dollar stores, pet stores, Veterinary Assistant work, coffee shops, being rejected entirely or hearing nothing back from the employer. At this point I just really need some work experience and I know I'm doing something wrong for being ignored/rejected. I don't know what to do in this situation other than ask for help or constructive criticism and keep applying for jobs.

I've added as many things to my resume as I can that are relevant (or so I believe) including my experience as a trade-show vendor. I honestly don't have much to work off of without securing some kind of job that I can add to my resume, and I've been told that I would have more luck getting a job if I'm already actively employed which feels like a slap to the face with the situation I'm in. It really doesn't help that I am a massive introvert with poor social skills and a diagnosed Anxiety disorder, but I am really trying to improve that for the sake of employment.

I've heard from friends and family that are in similar situations with struggling to get ahold of a job in my area, and they have way more job experience than I do so its even more disheartening on my outlook.

Home kitchen organization is crucial for creating a functional and enjoyable cooking space. A well-organized kitchen not only maximizes efficiency but also enhances the overall aesthetic of your home. From pantry storage to countertop management, implementing effective organizational strategies is essential for any homeowner.

One of the first steps in achieving effective home kitchen organization is decluttering your space. Begin by removing items that are no longer needed or used. Here are some tips for decluttering:

- Sort through utensils and gadgets; discard duplicates.
- Organize pantry items by category and consider expiration dates.
- Assess cookware and bakeware; keep only what you frequently use.

Next, consider utilizing vertical space to enhance organization. Tall cabinets and shelves can store items that are not used daily while keeping essential tools within reach. Investing in pull-out racks and tiered organizers can maximize visibility and accessibility. Additionally, labeling containers and shelves can streamline your cooking process by ensuring you know where everything is located.

Drawer organization is another vital aspect of home kitchen organization. Use dividers to separate utensils or create designated spaces for different tools. This not only saves time during cooking but also prevents drawers from becoming overcrowded and chaotic.

Don’t overlook the importance of countertop organization. Keep frequently used appliances, like toasters and coffee makers, at the forefront while hiding away less-used gadgets. Utilizing baskets or decorative containers can help maintain a clean and tidy appearance while ensuring easy access to necessary items.

Finally, maintain your home kitchen organization by regularly reassessing your set-up. Seasonal decluttering and rearranging can help uphold a pleasant and efficient cooking environment, making your culinary experiences more enjoyable.

Should I buy?","I randomly found a 2020 Arteon SEL Front Wheel Drive with 43K miles on it for $21,000 at a well established/rated luxury car dealership. They have had the car for about a month and in that short time they have dropped it from 23k to 21k. Price is less than Kelly and shows one owner, no wrecks and looks like basic maintenance has been performed at normal intervals. Took it for a ten minute spin and noticed no issues. Side note, it does show owner was commercial use. According to the sales guy, the previous owner came in and traded it in towards a new car. I feel like I could probably wiggle them down to $19,500 to $20,000 with a little talking, but if I can't is this still a deal at $21k? I own two paid off 2016 Kia Optimas that have both had engines replaced by Kia so they both technically have decently low mileage for the year on the engines. I'm giving one of them to my daughter who is just starting college.

My wife works from home so this would basically be hers as a drop kid off at school, coffee, workout, grocery getting car. She still averages about 15k miles a year though. Any crazy side things or maintenance issues with these? I keep cars for the full extent of loan (5 years) than I usually keep them as long as they don't start causing me major troubles. I'm an average DIY'er. I can do the usual brakes, rotors, oil change, plugs, basic sensors if I can reach, but I'm not a deep digger and what scares me is with the rarity of these in the states I don't see youtube walking me through how to change a (insert name here) on these on the fly.

1i03jlb,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1i03jlb/something_is_stalking_me_and_i_cant_kill_it/,Something is stalking me and I can't kill it.,"I need help. I am currently writing this in a shitty motel room I scraped the last of my money for, scared for my life. I am writing this as a last resort. My friends don't believe me and neither do the police.  I am a 22F who lives in a small cottage in the woods with my English setter, Johnny. I got Johnny a few years ago as my hunting companion. His breed is trained to stalk and point to birds so you can find and shoot them. It was all around 6 months ago I started noticing weird things happening around my house. It was small things at first, like noticing windows in my house were cracked even when I was sure I closed them. It didn't take long before this thing started doing shit right in my face instead of waiting for me to find them. I woke up one night to Johnny crying, pressing his weight into me, pointing his snout to the bedroom window. This was enough to instantly wake me up and make my stomach drop. I stayed still trying to focus my eyes in the pitch black room. I reached for the lamp on the nightstand, but I couldn't help hesitate. I knew if someone or something was there, it was better for me to know asap whether or not to grab the shotgun under my bed. But there was a childish part of me that wanted to believe that if I just put my head in the covers and went back to sleep everything would be alright. Like whatever was there would give up after a while and decide to leave me alone. But I knew that wasn't an option, so it wasn't long before I switched on the lamp. My worst nightmare came true when I saw a black figure speed past the window as soon as the light hit it. It was so fast I almost convinced myself it was just my tired eyes adjusting to the sudden light change. It was too fast to be human. But I knew I wasn't crazy when Johnny started running frantically around the room barking, as if he was telling me he lost sight of whatever was standing there. I got up as fast as I could and grabbed the gun under the bed, tiptoeing my way to my bedroom door. I pressed my ear up to the door and stayed quiet, listening for the sounds of someone possibly breaking in. The silence made my ears ring and eventually Johnny calmed down. If I am being completely honest, I was too much of a pussy to open that door. Instead I locked myself in, closed my curtains, and stayed in there until Johnny's bladder couldn't hold it anymore. I spent the next few days constantly looking over my shoulder, barely eating from the anxiety. What oddly made it worse is that the next few days were quiet. No windows were left cracked, no noises at night... You think that'd make me feel better but it just made me feel like I was going crazy. I knew I didn't imagine it because Johnny saw it too, but how did I know he wasn't just freaking out because he had to pee? Maybe there was a deer or something walking outside the window that was spooked by the light. About a week after, just when I thought everything was fine, this thing came back worse than before. It would wake me up by slamming every door, cabinet, and window in my house all at once. Plants in my yard would go missing like they were never there to begin with. I'd lie in bed at night, hearing scraping along the walls and ceiling. All the lights in the house suddenly stopped working past 9 pm. I would wake up to scratches up and down my arms. This went on for months and I could feel it eat away at my brain. It felt like a leech sucking my consciousness out of me. My days started blending together and my anxiety was at a constant. The word ""anxiety"" doesn't capture the terror I felt in my stomach at every waking moment. I would go days without eating without even realizing. I had gotten visibly smaller over the months and I think since this whole thing I've lost about 95 pounds. I know you're all wondering why I didn't sprint out the door the second I saw something peering at me as I slept and it comes down to one factor: money. I simply don't have the money to move and it didn't help when I started reaching out to my friends about it. I met my friends at a coffee shop in town and I told them everything. The noises, the plants, the figure I saw. I don't know how I expected them to react, but they just stared at me silently for a few seconds. I got that sudden feeling of just oh fuck, I shouldn't have said that. I wanted nothing more to take it back and I don't know why. I felt almost embarrassed talking about it. ""Are you getting enough sleep?"" My friend, Chelsea asked me. ""No, but I mean that's not an issue. This thing is keeping me awake."" I immediately got defensive. No fucking way they're gonna brush it off that I'm just tired? All she did was sigh and she looked to our other friend at the table. ""Audrey..."" she trailed off. ""I know you think you know what you saw, but I think it might be time to talk to your psychiatrist."" For the first time in a few months I wasn't anxious, I was furious. My palms started sweating and my knee started bouncing. ""Are you fucking kidding me?"" They drop their heads and sigh again. Are they treating this like an intervention right now? ""We're just worried about you. You have to keep in mind your genetics, Audrey. Your mom was diagnosed with schizophrenia and it's very possible it could've been passed down to you. It's nothing to be ashamed of, we just want to help."" Chelsea tried pleading with me but I didn't say anything, I just stood up and walked away. I held my composure til I turned my back from them and I couldn't hold the tears anymore. I knew what I saw. I knew what I heard. I knew what I felt. If I'm completely honest, I stopped at the dispensary before going home. I knew it probably wasn't the smartest to be on a substance while I potentially have something stalking me, but I couldn't take the gut wrenching anxiety anymore. And honestly that night was the most peace I had experienced in the last few months. Maybe it was the weed, but either way I wasn't complaining. It was even the first night I was able to go to sleep without pills. Johnny was quick to interrupt my sleep to tell me he had to pee though. It was around 3 am when I opened the back door and let him out. I usually didn't like to leave Johnny outside at night alone because of predators and the fear of him getting through the fence, but at that moment I whole heartedly believed I was gonna pee myself. I jogged down the hallway to my bathroom and before I could make it, I heard Johnny yelp outside. I turned around as fast as I possibly could and ran down the hallway. Johnny was standing on top my patio furniture out back, staring at me. His eyes were the biggest I had ever seen them. He looked horrified but he was as still as could be, just staring at me. Something felt weird but I was still a little high and I just wanted to make sure my sweet boy was okay. I let him in and start feeling around his body, looking for any cuts or scrapes he might've gotten outside. He usually hated me touching his legs and his paws, but right now he was just standing there as still as he was standing outside. He was looking straight ahead, almost like he was a statue. I ended up finding a hell of a scrape on one of his ankles. I touched it and he had no reaction, even though it was a pretty good gash. I looked closer at it and I saw there wasn't any visible blood. I stopped like a deer in headlights.  I looked at the black spots on his coat and they looked out of place. Almost like when you put a fitted sheet on wrong. His skin stretched weirdly over his body, like it was 2 inches too short. I looked at his head and he was just staring straight ahead of him. I knew this wasn't Johnny. I fought tears back, images of what could've happened to Johnny went through my head. I had to figure something out. Who knew what this thing would do to me when I fell asleep. ""Awww poor baby look on your foot."" I said in a fake sympathetic voice. This flipped a switch and this thing started wagging its tail and licking my face. I felt sick to my stomach. I brought it over to the kitchen, half ass wrapping the foot and getting ""Johnny"" ready for bed. ""Okay, let's go to bed!"" These four words would usually have him sprinting down the hallway into our bedroom. Except this time he stood at my feet, staring at me with big puppy eyes. There was an excited look on his face that made me want to fall to my knees and cry. ""Johnny get in the fucking bedroom!"" I yelled. I tried to act as normal as I could but fuck I just wanted to call a quits and let this thing kill me. The only thing that kept me going was the off chance of my real Johnny being outside right now, scared and alone and hurt. This thing scurried off into my bedroom and it was obvious it moved weird. Instead of taking a step with his front foot and the opposite back foot, he'd step with both feet on the same side. He moved almost side to side like a train on tracks. I heard him creep around the bedroom, his nails scraping the floor like he was being dragged. I knew my only chance was grabbing my shotgun from under the bed. I was far too weak for any physical fight. I was basically skin and bones and Johnny was no small dog, he was a tall dog at about 95 pounds. He was practically as big as I was at that point. I slowly made my way to the bedroom, staying as quiet as possible. My whole body was shivering and twitching. It felt like my body was going to collapse under me at any moment. He started to bark at me and even his bark was different. Johnnys usual bark was deep and loud, but this bark was high pitched, almost like a shriek. I was quickly losing my patience with this fucking monster. In that moment I honestly just wanted to knock the shit out of it. I knew I'd die in the process, but all I wanted to do was go out swinging. But I had to try and find Johnny. I turned around the corner to see it sitting on my bed. It looked like a cartoon of a dog, laying down looking at me, it's tail wagging with its head tilted and its tongue hanging out the side of its mouth. Except it still looked off. It's tongue was a little too long, his eyes were too far apart, his teeth went too far back in his mouth, and he had that same excited look in his eyes. I smiled, putting my hands on my hips. ""Johnny, we almost forgot your dinner!"" I say as excited as I could, my voice was shaking with every word. ""It's in the kitchen, baby boy. Finish then come to bed, ok?"" It quickly got off the bed and made it's way for the kitchen. I grabbed my shotgun and loaded it, running to the door and standing at the end of the hallway. It started making its way back to the bedroom when it realized there was no food. It stood there at the other end of the hallway, staring at me. The excited look hadn't left and I would be lying if I didn't say that was the most unsettling part. Like it knew something I didn't and it was just two steps ahead. I shut my eyes and started firing. The shots lit up the dark hallway, and I think I fired about 4 shots until the gun stopped. I opened my eyes to see it oozing and convulsing on the floor. It made a sort of gasping sound as it thrashed around and it had a strong sulfur smell to it. Its shape kept morphing between Johnny, a deer, and a man I didn't recognize. It scared the living fuck out of me but I focused on running out the back door to go find Johnny. I walked outside with my gun in my hand, calling out for him. It was about 10 minutes before I found him. I found him in a ditch, brush and vines tangled around him. The way the vines wrapped around him locked his legs bent under him. I was scared I was too late until he raised his head to look at me. I ripped away the plants and he shot up toward me. He pushed himself into me like he couldn't get close enough. He was wet and shaking. We sat there for a second before quickly making our way to the truck. I sped down the remote streets, constantly looking in my rear view mirror. We drove to the nearest police station where I told an officer everything that's happened. I thought it was finally over until the cop looked at me the same way my friends did. ""Ma'am are you under the influence of any substance tonight?"" The tears I had been holding back all night finally fought their way out. I didn't even try to argue. This thing got what it wanted. It watered me down into a shell of the person I was before and I was too weak to fight. After tonight, all I cared about was making sure Johnny was safe. I drove him over to Chelseas house and let him through the gate into her backyard. I knew she wouldn't be happy, but she was the only person I could trust to take care of him. This takes me to now, sitting in this shitty motel room, waiting for this thing to inevitably break in. I've been here for about 2 days and I think its followed me. I still hear scraping along the walls and ceiling. The lights still don't work past 9 pm. Windows are still being cracked open. It feels like its starting its twisted game all over again. I am tired of living in fear. The leech in my brain is getting bigger and I can feel it pulse every minute of every day. I feel like I've gone completely fucking crazy and I need help. I don't know how much longer I can fight this thing.",3,1736734490.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False
