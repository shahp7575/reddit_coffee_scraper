I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1iv8an6,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1iv8an6/55_year_partner_broke_up_with_me_2_weeks_before/,5.5 year partner broke up with me 2 weeks before the wedding she insisted on,"I was with my ex partner for 5.5 years on the dot. In the beginning, we were so in love - like we had finally met our person after so many failed relationships. There was a fairy tale like narrative to our relationship. Our first date lasted 12 hours. Within one month, she ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù told me that she loved me.
She suffered from chronic illness and depression, and before she met me she was active in the kink community. She assured me that kink was not something she needed any longer, and all of her kink relationships had been very abusive. (Not saying that all are, but hers were.)
Within a few months of our relationship, she began to sexually distance herself. She told me it was because she had started her fast tracked masters program and was overwhelmed. Later, she told me that because of her chronic illness and all of the medications she was on, she was no longer capable of the same sexual experience she‚Äôd had in the past, and it was a testament to her attraction to me that she had interest in sex at all. Later, it came out that her kinky abusive partners before me were the sexual highlight of her life and were better sex, and when I tried to ask how I could satisfy her, she wouldn‚Äôt be upfront and tell me because I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúnaturally kinky.‚Äù I began to shut down sexually because it felt like a huge rejection and felt awful. We were still so in love, and when I look back at pictures I can see the love for me in her eyes. The pandemic began, and she began to become depressed. She gained a bunch of weight because of a new medication and felt out of touch with herself. We still loved each other and seemed to be very happy to be with eachother. She began to spiral into depression and told me it was just part of her life and would be something that would come and go . She became incredible agoraphobic and would not leave the house to go anywhere or do anything with anyone, stating her chronic illness as the reason, which I felt I could not challenge. So she had only 2 active friendships, she was unwilling to go to social events or dates and made a huge fuss for obligatory events like birthdays and Christmas, and we were not having any new experiences together. I felt like our life together consisted of me doing things on my own and interacting with her inside of our home, the only place she wanted to be. I remember her crying and telling me this was the happiest she‚Äôd ever been and that she was so happy that she didn‚Äôt give in to suicidal ideations so she could experience her life with me. She proposed to me 4.5 years ago, and after Trump was elected, she insisted that we rush our marriage and get legally married before he took office. We made plans to get legally married and had our immediate family involved in our plans. 2 weeks before the wedding, after she had gone home for thanksgiving for 4 days, she returned and called the wedding off out of nowhere. She told me that we had just become friends and companionate, because we didn‚Äôt have sex, and that she had decided to be more masculine (she is trans and constantly changing her gender expression) and that she needed to be part of the kink community. She told me we had just become best friends, but then after I had a panic attack 3 days later, she told me that my processing the abrupt end of our relationship was too rough for her and she completely withdrew. I had to replace almost everything because her family was wealthy and bought her house, and over the course of our relationship we got rid of almost all of my household things: bed, bed frame, couch, coffee table, dishes, silverware etc. When she abruptly ended our relationship, I told her I was taking $2k from our joint account to cover some
Of my moving expenses (it literally only covered my first months rent/deposit and a mattress), and she later came back at me that her mother was mad at me and that she was ‚Äúicked out that it was all about the money for me.‚Äù
She said she wanted to remain friends but was cold, distant, spacious and bread crumbing. A month before our breakup, she (a therapist) told me she ended the therapeutic relationship with a new client because they ‚Äúknew what this was‚Äù and that they had too much in common/ too much of a vibe to be in a therapeutic relationship ship: she said they were best friend material. I think this was inappropriate and strange, and in the beginning of our breakup I asked if she was seeing this person. She said ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt assume that I‚Äôm an asshole.‚Äù Maybe she isn‚Äôt seeing him. I have no idea what to think. Up until 3 days before she broke up with me, she was insisting on and planning our wedding. I have almost 6 years of text messages of her telling me how much she loves me and wants to spend her life with me. And in 3 days, she changed her mind and changed the entire narrative of our relationship. 2 months after our breakup, I sent a long therapist approved letter stating my experience of our relationship and the inconsistency of what she told me for 5.5 years verses what she told me when she ended our relationship: I told her I need an apology from her to be able to offer friendship. I haven‚Äôt heard a reply in over a month.
How could someone do this? Who could justify this kind of behavior? I feel like I am on the edge of losing my mind. I am so devastated and she seemingly literally doesn‚Äôt give a shit. I compromised so much for this person to accommodate her issues and illnesses, and she literally threw me in the trash with no warning and didn‚Äôt look back.

We continued talking and have since met up for a dine-in movie and coffee a few times. I gave her really good christmas/bday presents too.

So about her being engaged, yeah she's never told me directly. If I didnt snoop, for all I know I could think he's a family member the few times she's posted him. I've made that mistake before.

Yesterday, we hung out all day at a amusement park. Just us. And I was hoping to talk a bit about some truths, boundaries. But we didnt. I didnt want to make things awkward. I think she would say she's engaged if I asked. But she also avoids talking about him to me.

Cause when she picked me up (I can drive, but it worked out better she drove) she got a call from ""Baby"" and she quickly ended the call and texted him. But she talks to her sister on the phone.

Her relationship is currently long distance. Hey, if he's okay with me - more power to them. But I don't know if he knows about me just as how she doesnt tell me about him.

We didn't talk about boundaries, her fiance or my own feelings about her but I did try to make the first step towards defining our friendship moving forward by saying we have a ""close cousins"" type of relationship. She agreed.

I‚Äôm a long time fan and subscriber (been here since the T days) and have been wanting to share some of my favorite paranormal experiences. This experience in particular is one I thought I had made up. That was until years later, when the friend involved confirmed that it, had indeed, happened. I have several so I‚Äôll share more if everyone likes this one!! 

I grew up in a highly religious family in Wyoming. The morbid and morose were always highly taboo. But every October my mom and I would throw big Halloween parties (my dad hated it but mom always won that argument) and reserved the entire month to binge watch every ghost hunter show we could. 
This was around the time that I became fast friends with Dee. She was by far the coolest person I had ever met. She was obsessed with all things spooky which I found exhilarating. Finally, I could explore all the paranormal and supernatural things that I was never allowed to normally! 
The one time I was allowed to spend the night at her house was something I will never forget! 
We were eating classic sleep over foods; pizza, soda, and the stash of candy her mom had obviously hidden for herself. While we‚Äôd been rooting around in areas of the house we shouldn‚Äôt have been we found an ouija board. Dee eventually convinced me to try it. So we set it up on the pizza box in the middle of the coffee table and set the planchet down. 
When I say the temperature changed in the room, the second i touched it, I mean it. And it seemed to be only affecting me. Suddenly I was insanely thirsty and felt like I had been walking around in a theme park in the summer. I remember Dee asking me if i was okay. Of course I lied and kept my hands engaged with the game. We waited for a while but nothing was happening. Even when we tried moving the planchet ourselves it was like pushing it through oobleck (that weird goo you get when you mix cornstarch and water). After a few minutes I couldn‚Äôt stand it and I practically ran to the kitchen to get water. As soon as I was in the other room I felt better, I didn‚Äôt feel like i was in a hot tent anymore and i could breathe again. I went to the sink to get some water, hoping to get my pulse under control. 
Dee was still in the other room. As soon as I had my back turned she yelled ‚Äúhey‚Äù. Thinking she was mad at me (the way she had said it sounded strange) I was about to suggest we do something else. Just in time to see the planchet flying straight at me. I felt the wind it made as it slammed into the wall next to me. Dee hadn‚Äôt moved. All of the color had drained out of her face and she was just sat at the coffee table shaking. All the hair on my body was standing straight up, it was so scary. 
I didn‚Äôt even think when I grabbed the planchet from where it had landed on the counter and threw it out the kitchen window behind the sink. 
I grabbed my backpack off the couch, mumbled something about seeing Dee at school later, and left. I walked 4 blocks to the nearby church and called my mom on my flip phone, begging her to come get me. And because my life is comically sitcom-like it, of course,  started raining while I stood there and waited for my mom. 
I got insanely sick. So sick I spent nearly a week stuck in bed. Basically unconscious. I literally couldn‚Äôt speak, due to tonsillitis and a random antibiotic resistant re-occurring strep infection, for nearly a month, and I ended up having to get my tonsils out. And the ring finger on my right hand got a crazy infection that sent me to the ER and had to be lanced in order to keep me from losing my finger. Anyone wanna guess which hand I used to throw the planchet out the window? 
I don‚Äôt think I ever spoke to Dee in person again. When we talked years later (on facebook) she told me that everything was so bad at the house afterwards. She and her family moved because her dad lost his job, her parents got divorced, I think one of her grandparents died like 6 months later (they lived with them at the time). We never really regained our friendship either. On a cooler note though, ever since I recovered from my illness I have been able to see peoples auras. So I guess fun perk.

Ever feel like you're drowning in a sea of motivational quotes that scream *""You can do ANYTHING!!!""* while you‚Äôre just trying to remember where you left your keys? Mark Manson's *""The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck""\* is the antidote to all that toxic positivity. With a healthy dose of brutal honesty and dark humor, Manson argues that life is limited‚Äîand so are your f\*cks. The secret? Choose wisely where you spend them.

üëâ **Book Club Rating: 8.5/10** (Good slap in the face, but not for the faint of heart.)

# üí° Key Takeaways 

**Chapter 1: Don‚Äôt Try**

* Happiness doesn‚Äôt come from chasing success‚Äîit comes from accepting your limitations.
* Constantly striving to be ‚Äúexceptional‚Äù just makes you feel worse. *Spoiler alert:* Most of us are average. And that‚Äôs fine.

**Chapter 2: Happiness Is a Problem**

* Pain and struggle are inevitable. The key is choosing the problems worth struggling for.
* Pursuing happiness as an end goal = chasing a carrot on a stick. Exhausting and pointless.

**Chapter 3: You Are Not Special**

* Harsh but true: You‚Äôre not a unique little snowflake. Accepting this helps you stop obsessing over what others think and start focusing on what matters.

**Chapter 4: The Value of Suffering**

* Meaning comes from choosing how you suffer. If something‚Äôs not worth suffering for, it‚Äôs probably not worth your time.

**Chapter 5: You‚Äôre Always Choosing**

* Life is a series of choices. Even in crappy situations, you control your response. Own it, or stay stuck.

**Chapter 9: ...And Then You Die**

* Memento mori: Remembering your mortality helps you focus on what actually matters. Bonus: It makes sweating the small stuff seem ridiculous.

# Memorable Quotes You‚Äôll Want to Tattoo on Your Forearm 

* *‚ÄúWho you are is defined by what you‚Äôre willing to struggle for.‚Äù*
* *‚ÄúYou will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of.‚Äù*
* *‚ÄúYou are not special. And that‚Äôs a good thing.‚Äù*
* ‚ÄúDeath is the light by which the shadow of all of life‚Äôs meaning is measured.‚Äù

Honestly? This book hit harder than my morning coffee. The whole ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not special‚Äù bit was a slap to the ego, but a necessary one. We waste too much energy stressing over things that don‚Äôt matter. Manson‚Äôs approach isn‚Äôt about becoming indifferent‚Äîit‚Äôs about prioritizing what truly matters and letting the rest go. Basically, give fewer, but better, f\*cks.",1,1740190294.0,OdysseyBookClub,0,1.0,False

1iv80gs,https://www.reddit.com/r/amiwrong/comments/1iv80gs/i_didnt_want_to_share_my_gatorade_with_my/,I didn‚Äôt want to share my Gatorade with my boyfriend. Am I wrong?,"My boyfriend (32M) and I (31F) have been dating for almost two years, and today we got into a pretty heated argument. He believes that I should share anything of mine with him, without question, at all times. I'm an only child and sharing has never come easily to me, but l am overall a generous person and I tend to share my things with him most of the time (or at least half of the time). He has told me that l've made great strides and he himself cannot remember the last time I said no to sharing with him.

Our argument today perfectly encapsulates our disagreement: He went to the grocery store to pick up a few things, then he went to get a coffee. When he got home I remarked on the fact that he was having another coffee, and he said ""Yeah, I don't even want this, I want your gatorade instead."" Upon saying so, he opened the fridge and went for an unopened Gatorade that l'd gotten myself a few days prior. This immediately bothered me and I said ""You're so entitled!"" half-jokingly, to which he replied with ""Why? You're not going to drink it right now."" My argument in response is that 1) it's mine, 2) he could've at least had the decency to ask me first and 3) if he had asked, it's okay for me to say no to a request like that, and ""like that"" I mean one where it's not life or death or especially cruel for me to saying no to sharing.

He believes that since I'm his girlfriend, he shouldn't even have to ask. He also ended up taking it and drinking it despite my ""no"" and told me that he'd get me another one within 30 minutes. When I pressed him about the next 30 minutes (he was jumping on a call when he said so) he made me feel like I was making a big deal out of nothing. I tried to tell him that the basis of my argument is in the principle. I generally share with him, and it's okay for me to say no 1) once in a while and 2) when it's something so inconsequential.

Am I wrong here? Am I being selfish? We argued for multiple hours and he refuses to agree that not sharing once in a while won‚Äôt make him think it‚Äôs shitty of me. ",12,1740190270.0,amiwrong,28,0.88,False

1iv7y00,https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/1iv7y00/success_with_green_tea_no_caffeine/,Success with green tea/ no caffeine,"Hey everyone.  I've been dealing with migraines for a years now and have enjoyed this sub so I figured I'd share some success I've had.

I've always known that coffee could be a trigger but for my migraines but did it anyways.  Something about it just made me too excited and often pushed me over the edge or off balance into migraine land.  That's not the only trigger, but it was one.

This fall, I got a bunch of loose leaf green tea.  I started drinking that in the morning and noticed that immediately, my migraines got much fewer.  In fact, overnight I had a 2-week clear streak and then the day I had a coffee, WHAM, migraine time.  Seemed obvious to me.

I told this to my neurologist  and he suggested avoiding caffeine altogether.  Mine are, according to him, because of spinal fluid pressure which is raised by caffeine.  Eventually in January I went (mostly) caffeine free for a while and its been good too.  My energy levels are more stable and its easier not thinking about when/ what I can drink next as a pick-me-up.  And no migraines, or at least, if I feel funny, I can chill out and let it fade.

To be fair, all this happened around the same time I started taking Topirimate as well as B2 and Magnesium supplements (glycinate and oxide both seem to help).  Coq-10 didn't seem to make a difference.  I can't be sure if its the supplements or the reduced caffeine, but in general I feel much better and more resilient. So far in 2025, I've only had 1 migraine. 

Food for thought, hope it helps!

She had no shoes, ragged unwashed hair, and she clung to a tattered old book.

One of the boys had found an old, mostly broken baby carriage in a nearby junk pile, and they shoved it at her, taunting ""Don't you even know how to play like a girl?... Here's your baby carriage, girl... girls don't need books... girls don't wear pants... nah, nah, nah"" things like that while they pushed and shoved her.

Niki was in a diner wishing for better coffee and better company, or at least a clean tablecloth, when she saw this from across the street. The waitress who could actually fill a coffee cup with a disdain usually reserved for deadbeat husbands and palookas, and whose apron gave little doubt about the last week's menu specials, grumbled ""serves her right""

Niki looked up at her, with a look that could even melt the gravy in this joint. ""Can I help you honey?"" she mumbled, with her same coffee serving disdain. ""No, but I wish I could help you"" Niki quietly replied as she slipped out of the booth and headed across the street.

Now, Niki was wearing pants too... but, no one... no man, no boy... and darn few women could say that she shouldn't be. They fit in all the right places and looked just as good coming as going.

She put herself between the boys and the little girl, who wasn't letting herself cry and said to the very little men. "" I understand that girls don't wear pants"" She pivoted slowly so they could get the full effect, their adolescent brains looking quickly for a response, or at least a way to pull their mouths shut"".

She walked over to the boy who seemed to be the leader of the rest and bent down to whisper in his ear ‚Äúdon‚Äôt I look like a girl to you‚Äù?

She straightened up and he froze like a two dollar statue. ‚ÄúYeeees‚Ä¶ yeees ma‚Äôm‚Äù he stammered. ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, well okay‚Äù¬† she thought to herself. ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, do I look like a ma‚Äôam to you‚Ä¶ isn‚Äôt your mother a ma‚Äôam‚Ä¶ do you look at your mother like that?‚Äù

The boy said nothing‚Ä¶ his little boy brain was fresh out of quick comebacks and his little boy body shook with a mixture of forbidden thoughts and general desperation. He wanted to run as much as he never wanted to move again. He both wanted her never to have said those things and to say them again.

Niki pivoted again and turned her attention to the little girl, who had by then become transfixed, as if watching her favorite movie serial hero in action.

The girl had loosened her grip on the book, which was her prize possession, and smiled when Niki knelt down in front of her. It was a smile she kept for loved ones and special moments and happy thoughts‚Ä¶. A smile all too rare in her young life.

Niki smiled back and stopped herself from saying ‚Äúhoney‚Äù, because she just knew that the girl would get enough of that in her life.

‚ÄúWell, young lady‚Ä¶ what do we have here‚Äù, She looked down at the book and the little girl‚Äôs expression brightened even more. It was the first time anyone had ever looked past her clothes and her hair, and showed an interest in the book that never left her side.

50g water + 3g instant coffee. I should have made it more concentrated (same amount of water and more instant coffee - it doesn't really come through). 50g starter. 325g warm water. 55g brown sugar.

Separately, 470g bread flour, 9g salt, and 30g cocoa powder. Add to your wet mix until shaggy. 

All below are in a closed oven with the light on, covered in a shower cap. One hour rest, fold, repeat x4. On the second fold, add 180g chocolate chips. I like chocolate but this is too much IMO. Bulk ferment in a linen and flour lined bowl for another 3 hours. 

Bake at 450 in a preheated Dutch oven for 27m, then do lid off additional 12 minutes. Crust was pretty soft here.

1iv7tv6,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1iv7tv6/the_watcher_on_the_bridge/,The watcher on the bridge,"I never believed the stories about the Silverbrook Bridge.

People in town whispered about strange things happening there‚Äîcars breaking down for no reason, shadowy figures glimpsed through the trees, a feeling of being watched from the cliffs above. A few people swore they saw something huge lurking near the bridge late at night, but when pressed for details, their voices would lower, and their eyes would dart away, as if speaking of it too openly would call it back.

I thought it was all superstition. I wanted to believe that. Until the night I found out the truth.

It was mid-November when my friend Danny called, his voice tight with panic.

‚ÄúJosh,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs following me.‚Äù

I frowned. ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, man. I was driving past Silverbrook Bridge and‚Äî‚Äù His breath came in short, frantic bursts. ‚ÄúThere was something in the road. It moved when I swerved, like it knew where I was going. It was too big to be a deer. I don‚Äôt‚ÄîI don‚Äôt know what it was.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou probably just saw a shadow.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù His voice was sharp, desperate. ‚ÄúIt was real. It had‚Äî‚Äù He stopped himself. ‚ÄúNever mind. Just meet me at the gas station, okay?‚Äù

Then the line went dead.

I grabbed my jacket and keys, trying to shake the uneasy feeling creeping up my spine.

Danny looked pale when I got there, his hands trembling around a half-empty coffee cup.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not crazy,‚Äù he muttered before I even sat down. ‚ÄúI know what I saw.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen tell me.‚Äù

He hesitated. ‚ÄúIt was tall. At least seven feet. It was‚Ä¶ wrong. Its limbs were too long. Its eyes‚Äî‚Äù He swallowed. ‚ÄúThey glowed red, Josh. Bright red.‚Äù

I felt a flicker of something cold settle in my gut.

‚ÄúLook, man,‚Äù I said, trying to keep my voice steady. ‚ÄúMaybe it was just an animal. A trick of the light. Your headlights‚Äî‚Äù

Danny slammed his coffee cup down. ‚ÄúNo. You don‚Äôt get it. It was watching me.‚Äù He exhaled sharply, running a shaking hand through his hair. ‚ÄúAnd I think it followed me here.‚Äù

I turned my head toward the window, my breath hitching. The fog had thickened outside, curling around the streetlights in long, ghostly tendrils. The street beyond was empty.

But for the first time, I felt it too. That terrible sensation of being watched.

I should have left it alone. I should have told Danny to go home, get some rest, and forget the whole thing.

But instead, I let him convince me to drive back to the bridge.

‚ÄúI need to know,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI need to see if it‚Äôs still there.‚Äù

And like an idiot, I agreed.

The road leading to Silverbrook Bridge was lined with gnarled trees, their bare branches twisting like skeletal fingers. The further we drove, the denser the fog became, until the headlights barely cut through it.

Danny was gripping the dashboard so hard his knuckles had gone white. ‚ÄúThis is where it happened,‚Äù he whispered.

I slowed the car. The bridge loomed ahead, its rusted metal frame half-lost in the mist.

Then the headlights caught something.

A dark shape, crouched on the railing.

My heart hammered against my ribs. It was big.

Too big.

At first, I thought it was a man, but no man had limbs like that‚Äîlong, unnaturally thin. And no man could move like that. Because the second the light touched it, the figure unfolded, standing upright in one impossibly fluid motion.

That‚Äôs when I saw them.

The eyes.

Two burning red orbs, staring straight at us.

Danny made a sound‚Äîa half-strangled cry. ‚ÄúOh, God.‚Äù

The thing tilted its head, as if it was studying us.

Then, before either of us could react, it leapt.

Not down. Up.

It spread something wide‚Äîsomething vast and black that swallowed the light. And then it was gone, vanishing into the fog above the bridge, leaving nothing but the pounding of our hearts and the echo of the wind.

Danny was breathing fast, his hands shaking violently. ‚ÄúDid you see‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

We didn‚Äôt speak after that. I turned the car around and drove back to town, both of us too shaken to say another word.

Neither of us ever went back to Silverbrook Bridge.

But sometimes, late at night, when the sky is heavy with mist, I dream of glowing red eyes staring at me from the darkness.

I can say, that about 1000mg of caffeine a day. I am a fairly active person that work out 3-4 times a week, easily 200 minutes of MVPA.

I had been getting anxiety issues, and nerve irritation, where my finger pinching happens often. One day,i decided to quit it cold turkey. Im also trying to lose weight as my BMI is hitting 29 though im athletic, and on a daily calorie deficit now. Averging losing 250g to 400g of weight a week

The first week of cutting coffee cold turkey is really bad. I felt like i am getting a heart attack. Massive headach/brain fog, anxiety, depression. I cannot concentrate at all. Paracetamol not helpibg either. 
Everytime i tried to focus, the headach worsen, and my heart pound harder. Every thought in my mind is pointing towards ""im dying!""

Come the 2nd week, the anxiety subsided. Headach not as bad, but still there. Breathing normalize but ocassional heavy, but chest still tight. I sleeps better now. No more toss n turn trying to fall asleep. 

I though the internet version of withdrawal takes 2-9 day is true, and i am coming out of it soon

Now,i am day 25 into no coffee, i still get the same symptoms

I wakes up feeling lack of energy. Chest tightness still there, but not as bad as the 1st week. Whenever i am at work work, im getting an after lunch crash where my brain stop functioning, and im feeling sick. I can literally feel a chill up my back and feeling nausea. My breathing still feels slight labored, and there is also a lingering weird feeling at my left chest whole day. 


I went to see a cardiologist, and he ruled out any heart issues. 


The brain fog is still happening. It comes and goes a few times in a day. I always feels better during and shortly after my mornning exercise (i usually do a zone2/3 for 30min in the morning), but it is short lived. The crash always comes around lunch time, and i always start feeling better with much lesser symptons in the evening

Last but not least, im always feeling cold now (no fever), the wind can just blow into my room and i feel chilly, even when the weather says its 28degree celsius.

* Wine: Red, white, prosecco (since we'll already have it for the mimosas), and possibly a little dessert wine for a couple of close family members who only like sweet wines lol (although mimosas are already sweeter so maybe it's not super necessary)
* Beer: A couple types, TBD
* Other N/A options: Coke, Diet Coke, Sprite (or lemonade?), coffee, tea, OJ (again, we'll already have it for the mimosas), and sparkling cider (so the mimosas can also be made N/A if people want - but if we have the N/A bellinis, do we even need this?)

Is this way too many options? We ourselves aren't big drinkers and since it's a daytime wedding, we know people may not even drink that much - but I still feel so conscious of trying to make everyone happy.

Also, is it annoying to offer the N/A bellini but not an alcoholic one? Technically people COULD have them alcoholic by just adding the little bottle to prosecco, which is theoretically fine to me, but they're kind of pricey and I don't want to have to buy a ton extra for mixer purposes. We also don't want to forgo these for a generic mixer because we love them and a local small business we frequent already said they could order some specifically for us.

I enjoy life‚Äôs simple pleasures: sipping a cranberry vodka or gin and tonic while taking in the city lights, or sharing a good laugh over coffee and cake.

Most importantly... Why am I here, especially on Reddit, with all the dating apps out there? Glad you asked! It‚Äôs because Reddit feels more authentic than those apps. You know the drill, right? You meet someone on a dating app, go on a date, and then realize you just don‚Äôt click. Afterward, there‚Äôs that empty feeling that lingers. Maybe they talk over you when they're drunk, dominate the conversation, or even ghost you with no explanation. The cycle also continues by deleting the app, reinstalling it and repeating the process all over again.¬†

Well, I‚Äôm here today to help you break that cycle. If you choose to respond to this post, you might just be putting an end to the repetitive dating app cycle‚Äîfor good. What I‚Äôm looking for is an old-fashioned romance. The kind where you go on real dates‚Äîwhere you‚Äôre picked up at your place and the date never, ever takes place at their home. It‚Äôs about creating memories in real-life settings, not just online or in someone‚Äôs living room.

When I‚Äôm not working, you‚Äôll find me writing, drawing, listening to synthwave, or watching nostalgic 80s/90s films. I‚Äôm a die-hard fan of the original *Gossip Girl* (2007‚Äîno reboot, please!) and would love a partner who‚Äôs down to binge it with me. My favorite films include *Dogfight*, *Cruel Intentions*, *Stand By Me*, *Career Opportunities*, *Secret Admirer*, and *The Bling Ring*. My playlists are filled with dreamy tracks like ‚ÄúSunset‚Äù by The Midnight, ‚ÄúSummer Eyes‚Äù by Coastal, and ‚ÄúMiracle Love‚Äù by Lazer Club.

While I treasure my independence, I‚Äôm ready to share my life with someone who feels like my best friend. I‚Äôm looking for a connection that‚Äôs rooted in laughter, trust, and genuine care. I want us to be that couple who creates silly inside jokes, enjoys the little things, and has each other‚Äôs backs through it all. Romantic moments are my favorite‚Äîthose quiet seconds when you lock eyes, smile, and know you‚Äôve found your person.

What I‚Äôm looking for:

* **Age Range:** 28-37
* **Height:** 5‚Äô10‚Äù or taller
* **Build:** Slim/fit/lean
* **Lifestyle:** Drug-free (molly, edibles, coke, etc.) with moderate drinking okay
* **Location:** Connecticut or within 25-35 miles, US/Canada preferred
* **Relationship Goals:** Long-term, monogamous, with marriage potential. Bonus points if you‚Äôre open to starting a family someday!

A few non-negotiables: You‚Äôre emotionally available, employed, stable, single, and not in touch with exes (I think it‚Äôs important we‚Äôre both fully present). You‚Äôre someone who communicates openly and values consistency‚Äîit‚Äôs the small, thoughtful texts and actions that mean the most to me.

If you‚Äôre kind, stable, and seeking a relationship filled with joy and mutual respect, I‚Äôd love to hear from you! Please include a photo in your message, and if we vibe, I‚Äôll happily share one back. Let‚Äôs see where this journey could take us! üíï

However, after our first band hangout thing outside of rehearsal we kinda had a moment and I started developing feelings for him. They've only gotten stronger since. We've been texting consistently for basically two months now and each time I think we're getting somewhere he doesn't take the bait. He's literally the nicest guy ever so I'm not sure if he's just being nice, but he asks about my family and my schoolwork and is genuinely interested. He is soooo boyfriend if you know what I mean. I hadn't seen him in person for two weeks but when I saw him today it just really hit me how down bad I am. But at this point it's extremely painful. I'm a super anxious person and I overthink everything. I've imagined every possible scenario. I'm also super shy- I can't imagine myself texting him one day like ""hey wanna get coffee?"". Cringe. I'm not sure what the right thing to do is. Part of me just wants to text him and say something like ""just thought you should know that I have feelings for you. I don't expect anything and I don't want to make things weird in the band but this has been weighing on me for awhile and it hurts too much to keep it bottled up.""

# [BEGIN TRANSCRIPT]

>**Dr. Vance:** *""Candidate Summers, thank you for coming in today. We have a few things to go over regarding your written evaluation.""*

>**Caleb:** *""Of course. Happy to be here. Love a good existential interrogation.""*

>*(Evaluator notes initial sarcasm but remains neutral.)*

>**Dr. Vance:** *""Let‚Äôs start with your response to the first question. You were asked what you fear most when flying. You wrote, ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs hard to get home in time.‚Äô Can you elaborate?""*

>**Caleb:** *""Sure. It‚Äôs a logistical issue. Schedules don‚Äôt always line up, and, you know, space travel isn‚Äôt exactly forgiving when it comes to delays.""*

>**Dr. Vance:** *""That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ not quite what we were asking. Most candidates mention equipment failure, mechanical malfunctions, or loss of control. Your response suggests a personal attachment that outweighs self-preservation.""*

>**Caleb:** *""I mean, if I die, I won‚Äôt be making it home anyway. So technically, the answer still fits.""*

>*(Evaluator pauses. Scribes a note.)*

>**Dr. Vance:** *""You mentioned that when overwhelmed, you distract yourself with workouts until the feeling ‚Äògoes away.‚Äô Do you think that‚Äôs an effective long-term strategy?""*

>**Caleb:** *""Depends. Do you need me to last a decade or just get through the next mission?""*

>**Dr. Vance:** *""That‚Äôs not an answer.""*

>**Caleb:** *""But it‚Äôs a good question.""*

>*(Evaluator exhales audibly. Adjusts glasses.)*

>**Dr. Vance:** *""Your answer to how you handle extreme distress was, ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt make it other people‚Äôs problem. Fix the problem.‚Äô Would you say you have difficulty asking for help?""*

>**Caleb:** *""Nope. I delegate all the time. Just last week, I told someone else to refill the coffee machine. True leadership.""*

>**Dr. Vance:** *""That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ not what I meant.""*

>**Caleb:** *""Then maybe you should be more specific.""*

>*(Evaluator marks response as ‚Äòevasive.‚Äô)*

>**Dr. Vance:** *""Let‚Äôs talk about your stance on therapy. You said, ‚ÄòSounds like a great idea for other people.‚Äô What about for you?""*

>**Caleb:** *""Listen, I‚Äôm sure therapy works wonders for people who enjoy unpacking their emotional baggage with strangers. I personally prefer to keep mine in a locked briefcase labeled ‚ÄòDo Not Open.‚Äô""*

>**Dr. Vance:** *""And you don‚Äôt think that might be a problem?""*

>**Caleb:** *""No, because the lock is really sturdy.""*

>*(Evaluator scribbles furiously.)*

>**Dr. Vance:** *""Regarding your response to whether you have intrusive thoughts, you wrote, ‚ÄòSometimes I get stuck on thinking about things I should‚Äôve done differently.‚Äô Can you expand on that?""*

>**Caleb:** *""Pretty self-explanatory, doc. Sometimes you think back to a moment and go, ‚ÄòWow, I could‚Äôve handled that better.‚Äô Then you try not to let it keep you up at night.""*

>**Dr. Vance:** *""Does it keep you up at night?""*

>**Caleb:** *""It doesn‚Äôt not keep me up at night.""*

>*(Evaluator underlines response twice.)*

>**Dr. Vance:** *""Your file suggests you failed this assessment multiple times. Does that concern you?""*

>**Caleb:** *""Not really. I‚Äôm still flying, aren‚Äôt I?""*

>**Dr. Vance:** *""It suggests a pattern, though. Avoidance of emotional distress, prioritization of others over yourself, unwillingness to engage in self-reflection-""*

>**Caleb:** *""Look, doc, I appreciate the concern, really. But the way I see it, I‚Äôm functional. I get the job done. I don‚Äôt freeze under pressure. And if I ever do need a therapist, I‚Äôll be sure to schedule an appointment‚Ä¶ right after I survive my next mission.""*

>**Dr. Vance:** *""And what if something happens that you can‚Äôt just ignore? That you can‚Äôt just work through?""*

>**Caleb:** *(Pauses. Shrugs.)* *""Guess I‚Äôll deal with that when it happens.""*

>**Dr. Vance:** *(Exhales slowly.)* *""Final question. If you had to summarize yourself in one sentence, what would it be?""*

>**Caleb:** *""Too stubborn to die, too competent to get fired.""*

>*(Evaluator sets pen down. Stares at Caleb.)*

>**Dr. Vance:** *""That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ quite the motto.""*

>**Caleb:** *""Right? I was thinking of getting it printed on a T-shirt.""*

# Final Evaluator‚Äôs Notes:

>üîç *""Candidate remains evasive and uncooperative in self-reflection. Avoids discussing personal distress and repeatedly redirects with humor or sarcasm. Displays an apparent reliance on external validation and responsibility for others, often at the expense of personal well-being. While highly competent, candidate exhibits patterns of emotional suppression and avoidance that, if left unaddressed, could impact long-term psychological resilience. Therapy remains strongly recommended.""*

# Caleb‚Äôs Unsubmitted Reply Letter to the Interview:

>*Dear Dr. Vance,*

>*First off, I want to commend your patience. If I had to deal with me, I‚Äôd probably be tired too.*

>*That said, I feel like we may have different definitions of ‚Äòevasive.‚Äô Just because I don‚Äôt enjoy unpacking trauma like a Christmas present doesn‚Äôt mean I have issues. Maybe I just don‚Äôt see the point in sitting in a sterile office rehashing the worst parts of my life for an hour.*

>*And yeah, I prioritize external responsibilities. Because someone has to. If it‚Äôs a choice between dealing with my own issues or making sure the people I care about don‚Äôt die, guess which one‚Äôs gonna win?*

>*As for therapy being ‚Äòstrongly recommended,‚Äô look - I get why you‚Äôre saying that. But what exactly do you expect me to do? Walk in, sit down, and say, ‚ÄòHey, doc, fun fact, I was experimented on as a kid, watched Mei die repeatedly, and was forced to use my Evol on living things against my will. Let‚Äôs unpack that, shall we?‚Äô*

>*Yeah. That‚Äôll go well. They totally won‚Äôt think I‚Äôm insane and lock me up for observation.*

>*Anyway, thanks for the concern. Appreciate it. Still not going to therapy, though. Hope that doesn‚Äôt keep you up at night.*

>*Sincerely (but not really),*

Any other recs you all can give?,"I'm not not the biggest green tea connoisseur, but after reading some of the posts here, I was on the hunt for a ""sencha"" tea. To my surprise, a random tea I bought off Amazon - ""Sen-Cha Ryoku-Cha Extra Volume"" (literally called just that) tasted pretty good, like the tea they serve in Japanese restaurants around here in NY. Perhaps even better, to be honest.

With that said, I am wondering if anyone can give any other recommendations (with direct links) for purchase, and which I can buy in the US or get shipped to the US. I don't know if I am describing this correctly, but I enjoy the ""broth"" and algae-like taste of the sencha tea I bought so far. Wouldn't mind something with an even more pronounced taste. I've read around here there are even ones that might have a little bit of rice, too? That's something I am willing to try, too.

I've been a heavy coffee drinker most of my life, and I'm finally revisiting (and enjoying) tea much more. Appreciate any recommendations. The only ""green tea"" I knew were the Chinese varieties I'd get at the local supermarket. But it seems Japanese sencha is really what I wanted all along.

Their partnership began as a simple trade agreement, but it quickly evolved into something far more ambitious‚Äîa plan to unite the world under a single banner: the ""United States of Canica.""

Paige Stansal, a brilliant strategist with a calm demeanor and a knack for diplomacy, was beloved by her people for her progressive policies and unwavering dedication to environmental sustainability. Aiden Rivera, on the other hand, was a fiery orator with a magnetic personality, known for his bold ideas and unrelenting drive to put America first. Together, they were an unstoppable force.

It all started with a secret meeting in a secluded cabin in the Canadian Rockies. Over steaming mugs of maple syrup-infused coffee, Paige and Aiden laid out their vision for a unified world. They believed that the only way to achieve lasting peace and prosperity was to bring all nations under one flag. Their plan was as audacious as it was controversial: they would use a combination of economic pressure, technological superiority, and strategic alliances to bring the world to its knees‚Äîwithout firing a single shot.

The first step was to merge Canada and the United States into a single superpower. They called it ""Canica,"" a portmanteau of their two nations. The merger was seamless, thanks to their shared values and complementary strengths. Canada's vast natural resources and technological innovations paired perfectly with America's military might and economic influence. Within months, Canica became the most powerful nation on Earth.

Next, they turned their attention to the rest of the world. Using their combined resources, they launched a global campaign to persuade‚Äîor coerce‚Äîother nations to join the United States of Canica. They offered economic incentives to countries that willingly joined, while subtly threatening those that resisted with trade embargoes and cyberattacks. One by one, nations fell in line, unable to resist the sheer power of Canica.

Europe was the first to capitulate, lured by promises of economic stability and technological advancement. Asia followed suit, with China and Japan reluctantly agreeing to join after realizing they couldn't compete with Canica's dominance. Africa and South America were more challenging, but Paige and Aiden's relentless diplomacy eventually won them over.

However, there was one nation that remained untouched: Mexico. From the beginning, Paige and Aiden had made a pact to spare Mexico from their global takeover. The reason was deeply personal. Years ago, during a diplomatic mission, Paige had been stranded in a remote Mexican village during a hurricane. The villagers had taken her in, fed her, and kept her safe until the storm passed. She had never forgotten their kindness.

Aiden, too, had a soft spot for Mexico. His grandmother had been born in Mexico City, and he had spent summers there as a child, learning about his heritage and falling in love with the culture. To him, Mexico was a symbol of resilience and beauty, a place that deserved to remain free.

When the time came to bring Mexico into the fold, Paige and Aiden stood firm. ""Mexico will remain independent,"" they declared. ""It will be a beacon of freedom in a united world."" The decision was met with confusion and outrage by some, but Paige and Aiden refused to budge. They even went so far as to sign a treaty guaranteeing Mexico's sovereignty in perpetuity.

As the years passed, the United States of Canica flourished. Poverty and war became relics of the past, and technological advancements improved the quality of life for billions. Yet, amidst the prosperity, Mexico stood apart‚Äîa vibrant, independent nation that served as a reminder of the world that once was.

Paige and Aiden often visited Mexico, not as conquerors, but as humble guests. They would stroll through the colorful streets of Oaxaca, savoring tacos al pastor and listening to mariachi bands. In those moments, they were not the leaders of a global superpower‚Äîthey were simply two people who had dared to dream of a better world, and who had spared a small piece of it to remain free.

And so, the world moved forward, united yet diverse, under the watchful eyes of Paige Stansal and Aiden Rivera. And Mexico, with its rich culture and indomitable spirit, remained a testament to the power of kindness, heritage, and the enduring value of freedom.

Their partnership began as a simple trade agreement, but it quickly evolved into something far more ambitious‚Äîa plan to unite the world under a single banner: the ""United States of Canica.""

Paige Stansal, a brilliant strategist with a calm demeanor and a knack for diplomacy, was beloved by her people for her progressive policies and unwavering dedication to environmental sustainability. Aiden Rivera, on the other hand, was a fiery orator with a magnetic personality, known for his bold ideas and unrelenting drive to put America first. Together, they were an unstoppable force.

It all started with a secret meeting in a secluded cabin in the Canadian Rockies. Over steaming mugs of maple syrup-infused coffee, Paige and Aiden laid out their vision for a unified world. They believed that the only way to achieve lasting peace and prosperity was to bring all nations under one flag. Their plan was as audacious as it was controversial: they would use a combination of economic pressure, technological superiority, and strategic alliances to bring the world to its knees‚Äîwithout firing a single shot.

The first step was to merge Canada and the United States into a single superpower. They called it ""Canica,"" a portmanteau of their two nations. The merger was seamless, thanks to their shared values and complementary strengths. Canada's vast natural resources and technological innovations paired perfectly with America's military might and economic influence. Within months, Canica became the most powerful nation on Earth.

Next, they turned their attention to the rest of the world. Using their combined resources, they launched a global campaign to persuade‚Äîor coerce‚Äîother nations to join the United States of Canica. They offered economic incentives to countries that willingly joined, while subtly threatening those that resisted with trade embargoes and cyberattacks. One by one, nations fell in line, unable to resist the sheer power of Canica.

Europe was the first to capitulate, lured by promises of economic stability and technological advancement. Asia followed suit, with China and Japan reluctantly agreeing to join after realizing they couldn't compete with Canica's dominance. Africa and South America were more challenging, but Paige and Aiden's relentless diplomacy eventually won them over.

However, there was one nation that remained untouched: Mexico. From the beginning, Paige and Aiden had made a pact to spare Mexico from their global takeover. The reason was deeply personal. Years ago, during a diplomatic mission, Paige had been stranded in a remote Mexican village during a hurricane. The villagers had taken her in, fed her, and kept her safe until the storm passed. She had never forgotten their kindness.

Aiden, too, had a soft spot for Mexico. His grandmother had been born in Mexico City, and he had spent summers there as a child, learning about his heritage and falling in love with the culture. To him, Mexico was a symbol of resilience and beauty, a place that deserved to remain free.

When the time came to bring Mexico into the fold, Paige and Aiden stood firm. ""Mexico will remain independent,"" they declared. ""It will be a beacon of freedom in a united world."" The decision was met with confusion and outrage by some, but Paige and Aiden refused to budge. They even went so far as to sign a treaty guaranteeing Mexico's sovereignty in perpetuity.

As the years passed, the United States of Canica flourished. Poverty and war became relics of the past, and technological advancements improved the quality of life for billions. Yet, amidst the prosperity, Mexico stood apart‚Äîa vibrant, independent nation that served as a reminder of the world that once was.

Paige and Aiden often visited Mexico, not as conquerors, but as humble guests. They would stroll through the colorful streets of Oaxaca, savoring tacos al pastor and listening to mariachi bands. In those moments, they were not the leaders of a global superpower‚Äîthey were simply two people who had dared to dream of a better world, and who had spared a small piece of it to remain free.

And so, the world moved forward, united yet diverse, under the watchful eyes of Paige Stansal and Aiden Rivera. And Mexico, with its rich culture and indomitable spirit, remained a testament to the power of kindness, heritage, and the enduring value of freedom.

Just moved to ATL and quickly realized that operating a coffee cart here comes with some unexpected challenges. We need a legit space with a sink just to store our cart, which we weren‚Äôt fully prepared for.

We‚Äôre super early in the game and don‚Äôt exactly have the budget to rent out a kitchen just for storage, so we‚Äôre kinda stuck. Feeling overwhelmed and hoping to hear from others who‚Äôve been through this.

Is this just how it is for mobile coffee businesses here? Are there any loopholes, affordable options, or workarounds we should know about? Any advice from seasoned ATL coffee cart folks would be massively appreciated!

Seems like renting a kitchen space is more than our current take home. We just started here but have some events booked started in April.

1iv6we4,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1iv6we4/leave_squeaky_floorboards_alone/,Leave Squeaky Floorboards Alone,"The dark floorboard in the spare bedroom- when pressure was applied to it- produced an uncanny sound resembling a voice, easily startling any poor soul who happened to plant their sole on it. I noticed ‚Äúthe voice‚Äù (as I eventually named it) shortly before Tyler¬†moved out.¬†



I was preparing the room for the next tenant, Nicole, Tyler‚Äôs friend and fellow student at the local university, when I first stepped on that dark panel of wood,¬†many shades darker than the others. The ""voice"" startled me- was someone speaking to me?



""Tyler? You here man?"", I yelled down the hallway. But it couldn't be, Tyler went to school. I saw him leave.



The contrast of this panel of wood flooring with the others was difficult to ignore- you couldn‚Äôt¬†*not*¬†notice it, the unusual arrangement compelled you to study it, drawing you near.¬† I couldn't figure out why this one panel was so different from the others.



A cozy little corner room with two windows, the morning sun illuminated the pale blue walls on nice autumn mornings.¬† It was a pleasure to sit on the windowsill, sipping coffee and gazing at the neighboring houses.¬† Two letters ""MB"" were etched in a beautiful cursive on the frame of the north-facing window, the flowing drapes occasionally revealed the letters when the wind was high.¬† In very small writing underneath the letters was a date, 10/3/84, and a number ‚Äú39‚Äù. Above that near the top of the frame was yet another date, 10/3/45, but in a blunt font and painted over; really only noticeable when the sun was setting.



I heard ‚Äúthe voice‚Äù before when the room was occupied, the sound cut through the muffled conversation and laughter of Tyler and his friends, smoking weed and listening to music.¬† The cacophony of noises kept my mind off more troubling thoughts, plus the aroma of weed brought me back to my college days, when life was full of promise, and not responsibilities.¬† What the hell was that sound though?



Tyler said to me when walking out of the house on his last day, ‚ÄúHey Rodger, that dark floorboard by the closet makes this weird noise when I step on it.¬† Maybe you got rodents down there or somethin‚Äô.¬† That sound though, I dunno man‚Ä¶¬†¬†*spooky.*‚Äù, mimicking a shudder.¬† Call it instinct, but something in his delivery sent an electric surge up my spine, the hairs on my arms felt electrified. I knew exactly what he was talking about, that sound was indeed spooky.



Before he stepped off the porch, I assured him I would check the floorboard before Nicole moved in.¬† I forgot to ask Tyler when she was coming, but the rent and deposit were already paid so I didn‚Äôt worry.¬† We shook hands and nodded farewell. Tyler‚Äôs stay here was brief, he just needed a place to crash for a few weeks in September until he secured a room at his fraternity house I imagine. I liked him though, he could have stayed here longer if he chose to.



‚ÄúBest of luck at your new abode, brother.‚Äù Tyler nodded thank you and off he went.



When I ""inherited"" the house and moved my stuff in, I soon realized grandma didn‚Äôt have many tools, plus I was a lazy bastard when it came to house repairs (which there were many), so I decided to simply fix the panel with a hammer and an old nail I found in the garage.¬† The only other tool in the garage was a crowbar, oddly. Boxes of old newspapers, photo albums, and vinyl records lined the walls. Maybe one of these boxes contained more tools, but I wasn't ready to go through them yet.



*I recall as a child, when my parents would drop me off at grandma‚Äôs house to attend a gathering or some function, grandma never once entered this room.*¬†



*One afternoon when boredom and curiosity overcame me, I tried entering. I reached for the doorknob, but something gave me pause; I kneeled down and peered into the room through the old fashioned key hole. The room was dark- and it was only mid-afternoon- yet I... I saw something, an object resembling an eyeball slowly gliding towards me, towards the door, me and the ""eye"" now mere inches apart.*



*Not a second later, grandma began screaming, ‚ÄúNever, ever go in there!!¬† Do you hear me?!?‚Äù. Grandma never raised her voice at me before or since.*



*My fear of the unknown germinated in my mind then and there.¬† When an elder (especially one who barely ever spoke), without warning screams at you to NOT do something- for reasons you couldn‚Äôt possibly understand- it changes you.¬† The world wasn‚Äôt the cozy, safe place I previously thought.¬† I never again went near the room after that when I stayed at grandma‚Äôs.¬† Hell, I slept on the couch during those visits.¬† After Love Boat or some shit, grandma would put her cup of tea in the kitchen and wander off to bed, leaving me on the couch with the TV and my imagination.*



I learned later the corner room used to be her twin sister‚Äôs, Mary Beth.¬† On a stormy night in autumn 1984, Mary Beth went missing. One moment she was there, then... gone. Grandma was never the same after that, according to my father.¬† He waited a long time before he told me about Mary Beth.



Grandma passed away in December '23 and the house became my responsibility, and my new home.¬† For some reason my uncle didn‚Äôt want anything to do with the house and basically signed it over to me.¬† I have no doubt Mary Beth‚Äôs disappearance affected him too in ways I couldn‚Äôt imagine.



A gold chain with locket containing both twin‚Äôs photos- two beautiful brunettes in their prime, grandma on the left, Mary Beth on the right- dangled from a picture frame in the living room that had an old photo of a small boat inside. My uncle told me at the funeral reception that Mary Beth had an identical locket, but with a silver foxtail chain.



Every time I glanced at that picture frame, I felt pangs of guilt for renting the room out, but I really needed the extra money, and to be honest, being alone in the house creeped me out.¬† I‚Äôd hear strange, unexplainable sounds at night.



*I moved in officially in late summer '24, finally getting an opportunity to examine the interior of that room for the first time. I was so accustomed to avoiding it- I almost forgot it was even there. There was no one around to stop me.*



*I turned the knob. To my surprise the room was completely empty, and clean, besides some dust and cobwebs. I always imagined it would be full of Mary Beth's things, but no. Then I saw it- the strange, doesn't-belong-here floor panel. Odd, yes, but otherwise this was a cozy, unused little room. I listed it for rent that very night. Sorry, grandma.*



When the hammer struck the nail- penetrating the wood with ease- I heard an extraordinarily loud, blood curdling, inhuman scream; followed by a wailing howl of an unimaginable variety. I recalled the Tall Man‚Äôs agonizing scream when Mike cut off his fingers in Phantasm.



With trembling hands, I removed the nail.¬† The screaming ceased, but gentle weeping continued for a short time.



After the weeping subsided (and a few glasses of bourbon were consumed), I removed the adjacent panel to see what made that horrible sound.¬† Was it an animal?¬† Did I puncture an old pipe of some kind?¬† No animal I was aware of could make that sound,¬†*and pipes don‚Äôt weep*.



My cellphone flashlight revealed what lied beneath- a large, bloodshot eye moving rapidly from side to side, surrounded by a darkness the flashlight couldn‚Äôt penetrate.¬† Then the pupil constricted, focusing its gaze directly at me; the hairs on the back of my neck stood up, the room grew darker, yet I remained transfixed on the Eye.



It spoke.



‚ÄúHello, Rodger.‚Äù



It knew my name.¬† The voice felt like it was coming from inside my own head, yet very far away.



‚ÄúCan you put the panel back on?¬† It is getting cold down here.‚Äù it quipped.



I hurriedly placed the panel back on and scampered out of the room, dropping the hammer on the floor.



‚ÄúThanks mate.‚Äù the voice replied, sounding a bit muffled with the panel back in place.



I laid on the couch, my eyes sealed shut, never once looking in the direction of the spare room until I eventually fell asleep.



The next morning it spoke again, ‚ÄúWhen are you getting another lodger in here mate? I‚Äôm lonely.¬† The time is coming, soon.‚Äù



*The sentence echoed in my head, ""The time is coming, is coming, coming...""*



What did this mean??



I somehow convinced myself none of this was happening and continued to look for that hammer.¬† Where did I put it?



Later that evening, again, ‚ÄúWhen are you getting a new lodger, Rodger?¬† Don‚Äôt ignore me‚Äù.



I drove around the neighborhood for hours just to get out of the house, but eventually I returned and attempted sleep in my bedroom, which was oddly cold.¬†



‚ÄúGoodnight, Rodger.‚Äù¬†



The words came from underneath my bedroom floor, adding, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be down here.‚Äù



*Neither do I, I concurred. Neither. Do. I.*



The next morning was blissfully quiet.¬† I peeked into the spare room- completely empty save a whiskey glass on the windowsill.¬† The rays of the morning sun streamed through the curtain, coating the walls with a pleasing amber hue against the walls of pale blue.¬† I opened the window to breath in fresh autumn air when a knock came from the front door. Oh fuck, Nicole!¬† I grabbed the empty whiskey glass and shuffled over to the foyer.



Nicole, a pretty blond-haired woman, entered carrying an inflatable mattress and a few bags.¬† She was dropping off some belongings, then would spend her first night in the room the following day.¬† She slapped a post-it on the bedroom door with a phone number.¬† I got the impression this was only for emergencies from the gaze in her eyes.¬† I already missed Tyler.



‚ÄúSee you tomorrow.‚Äù she said as she skipped out of the house and into her black Volvo parked in the driveway.



Just to have something to say in return, I yelled out to her, ""Street cleaning days are Mondays and Thursdays 11am-1pm"", followed by a curt ‚ÄúSee you later‚Äù. I don't think she even heard me.



That night, furious scratching sounds emanated from the spare room.



I screamed, ‚ÄúStop it!‚Äù



The voice openly sighed, no doubt coming from underneath the floor in my bedroom again, then said something I'll never forget, ‚ÄúYou better start praying this one stays you FUCKING LITTLE SHIT!‚Äù



I moved to the couch and turned on the television, loud.¬† The floor in the sunken living room was carpeted, no squeaky floor panels.¬† Thankfully I didn‚Äôt hear anything from the ‚Äúvoice‚Äù again the rest of the night.¬†



I awoke the next morning on the floor cradling an empty bottle of bourbon.¬† The details of the previous evening forgotten, erased from the chalkboard of memory.¬† If you‚Äôve been there before, you know what I mean.¬† I threw the empty bottle of bourbon into the backyard brush, vowing to never touch the stuff again.¬† Of course this was bullshit, but the storm on the horizon was not, and approaching fast.



Nicole returned later that evening with more luggage, soaked from the rain. During the night she repeatedly had to re-inflate the mattress.¬† Between the noise of the motor, thunder, pounding rain, and Nicole‚Äôs frustrated sighs, was the squeaking of that damn floorboard.¬† A paralyzing realization swept over me... I didn‚Äôt nail the floorboards back in!¬† Oh, please God, I hope she doesn‚Äôt try to open it.



I slept fitfully that night on my bed- although I really wanted to sleep on the couch- but with a new tenant in the house, that would be weird. Tyler didn‚Äôt give a shit when I fell asleep in the living room.



I had a terrifying nightmare of being absorbed into an amorphous ether, a black void absorbing all sound and light.¬† Deep within this nothingness were sharp, stained teeth.¬† Mere words could not describe the horror of this‚Ä¶¬†*thing.*¬† Even if there were, the words themselves would be consumed by its insatiable hunger.



I awoke at 9am and moved into the living room to lay on the couch, trying to forget the nightmare I just had.¬† The house was dead silent all day, the storm passed, all seemed well. I made a pot a coffee just to appear that I was a person who does something, anything.



Later that night I knocked on the door to ask Nicole if everything was ok, I hadn‚Äôt heard a sound after waking from that nightmare.¬† Nothing.



After no answer for twenty minutes, I let myself in.¬† No Nicole, just the deflated mattress and her luggage, her black Volvo clearly visible through the window.



I waited an agonizing four days before calling the phone number she wrote on the post-it.¬† Does she walk to her job?¬† Does she have a boyfriend that lives nearby?¬† Something felt very, very wrong.¬† A few more glasses of bourbon were poured before I had the nerve to reach for my phone.¬† I squinted at the date to make sure I wasn‚Äôt losing my mind, which felt more and more like a real possibility.



I reached the voicemail of an office she worked at.¬† I struggled to speak, ‚ÄúHi, Nicole?¬† Umm‚Ä¶ this is Rodger, just checking in‚Äù, already regretting calling the number. Nicole is gonna walk through the front door any second now... I hope.



I threw the phone across the room in a fit, almost hitting the picture frame and locket. The name of the boat, ""Eye of the Sea"",¬†was clearly stenciled on the side. I stared at it until it appeared the letters were moving around. A small fly buzzed my ear, snapping me out of my daze.¬† I opened the front door to shoo the fly out, then walked around the block to the liquor store, leaving the front door wide open. After that intense storm, the neighborhood was now calm, serene, with a gentle breeze.



*‚ÄúNicole, where are you?!?‚Äù I shouted inside my head, repeatedly.*



The neighbors were hanging Halloween decorations on their garage door when I returned.¬† I politely nodded, pausing to admire the skeletons, witches and smiling Jack-O-Lanterns.¬† I nervously turned away and spotted an orange parking ticket on Nicole‚Äôs Volvo. The admiration of my neighbor‚Äôs Halloween decorations turned to apprehension.¬†



I slammed down a huge slug of bourbon and laid sideways on my bed, staring across the hallway to Nicole's room.¬† I could see a small bundle of blond hair poking out from between the floorboards.¬† The deflated mattress obscured it somewhat, but there was no doubt it was a clump of blond hair.



Pulling up the panel slowly with the crowbar revealed a ripped, blood-stained blouse, torn away from the mutilated torso lying next to it; covered in a sea of squirming maggots, dozens of small flies escaped into the air. ¬†



From the neck down to the pelvis- one arm missing entirely- were deep gauges, bites, shredded internal organs, blood, mayhem.¬† I did not have the nerve to pull up another panel, where I imagine was Nicole‚Äôs head, but I could see the side of her face, frozen in a terrifying grimace.¬† There is something else, lying beyond the horrifying remains of a person who I only knew as ""Nicole"".



With crowbar in hand, I pull on the object.¬† A dusty, yet well-preserved skull with brown hair rolled onto its side. The front of the skull now facing me, revealing a slightly degraded silver foxtail chain around it's neck, reflecting the rays of the late morning sun.",6,1740186925.0,nosleep,0,0.88,False

1iv6sbh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1iv6sbh/my_coworker_has_made_me_less_enthusiastic_about/,My coworker has made me less enthusiastic about my job.,"Hi there!

The title hits it right on the nailhead. I'll try to give a condensed version of my situation with background. The advice I'm seeking here is essentially: what should I do? What would you do? Is it time to transition to a new job?

I work in the research field and have been with my lab for 4 years. I enjoy my work and am happy I have a great manager as well as boss. No complaints there. We've worked well together and have overcome a lot of hurdles where I was taking on the bulk of the work when it was just my manager and I running our site with multiple studies going on. I'm glad I can reflect back and be proud of the work I've done (multiple papers, abstracts, and contributions to the research field). At times, I've felt the pressure but I'm pretty good with rolling with the punches and getting my work done. Our lab has flourished since then and we've had students and techs come and go. All of them great to work with and I was sad to see them go but happy to see them pursue different avenues of endeavors. Currently, our site has a several techs working. One tech has an extensive background in the field we work in and I get along them great both personally and professionally. I know they don't need to depend on me or I need to step in to help them. I can **trust** them. Now, our new tech who we hired on at the beginning of this year started off well enough. They came from an industry we work with constantly but had little to no research experience. This isn't a red flag as the job we were hiring for did not require this since the position is essentially 'learn as you go but we look favorably upon those with experience'. Given their extensive work history and the group interview I conducted with them, I gave my input to my manager and boss that I viewed them as a top applicant. I had high expectations since our previous students and techs had little to no experience - one of them transitioned from coffee server to tech so my initial line of thinking was it was great they had a strong foundation for our line of work compared to previous employees. Well, those hopes have since dwindled. Since they've started, I noticed that tasks they were trained on can take up to several hours or the entire work day when they shouldn't. Tasks assigned to them as a priority don't get accomplished until I (or the other tech) tell them to do the task. They have poor time management where they'll start a task that I tell them should take a few hours but somehow ends up taking double that time. This especially in a case where the materials we work with have to be used in a strict set amount of time. From the observations made by the other tech and my self over the past month, I find myself stressing and worrying over working with this new hire. I feel like I'll have to do the bulk of the work on projects we're paired up on when I shouldn't because we essentially hired them to relieve my and the other tech's workloads. 

I know with the transition period of industry work to research would be something the new hire would have to adjust to, especially since they worked a 12-hr shift instead of a standard 9-5 and was also on shift for evenings/nights and was accustomed to working OT. I get there's a transition period but does something like really take 2 months of getting used to?

I've voiced my concerns to my manager (and so has the other tech) but were met with 'I hear you' and 'give them more time'. I get it and I've told myself that this is just a bump in the road and they'll get better. BUT I also think back on techs with less experience and how they picked up on tasks/trainings quickly and didn't have to touch base with me every 5 seconds (an exaggeration for the most part) or had to have to repeat myself multiple times when they sought my advice/guidance. The new hire is competent but with the work environment we have, I need someone I can rely on and not have to essentially handhold through procedures/workflows especially if it takes time away from my tasks/work that needs to be done in a day. 

I'll add that the stress of all this compounded with the fact that their pay grade is dang near similar to mine (when I have almost 5 years of experience on them, very extensive background in my field from uni/work, and am 2 job grades above them) is making me frustrated at the situation. I find myself wondering why I'm working at my site when I know I'm an integral part of the team but it feels like that's not being reflected. It's giving me a headache to even think about this and just makes me feel undervalued. 

Overall, the last 2 months have been stressful. I just find myself being more conscious of the new hire and their work which I haven't had to do - probably because I don't trust them so I'm less reliant on them. I wish I wasn't because it's sucking out the joy I found in my job. Now I'm having thoughts of transitioning to a different site. I don't want to but I really can't make manager and boss choose one of us. One, I rather not be a 'pick-me' person and make them relocate the new hire. I think I'd find it awkward to continue working there if that were to happen, especially if they move the new hire to a site we were in conjunction with. And two, I'd rather not find out that how much value I have at the site because I know people are replaceable in my field. My manager and boss can continue telling and confirming how much I'm needed at the site but I feel like in this situation, they'd tell me to just hang in there or it's cool if you leave.

Well, if you've read this far, thanks. Please excuse any typos/grammatical errors! I'm hoping I can get some feedback/advice on the situation. Especially since I have an annual review coming up in April.

Thanks!  ",1,1740186522.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

I am from the Waterloo region, though I am open to driving to meet up with people if that is the case. I am white, 5'10/5'11 I honestly don't know what one is correct. I have light brown hair, usually short/buzzed as I can't be bothered to fix my messy bed hair in the morning for work. Have a mustache; green/olive coloured eyes. I will say I am over weight; working on it, down 20lbs this year so far.

I work both days and nights, though do get a decent amount of days off for my weekends ( 4 on 5 off); so my schedule is really all over the place. It dose not stop me from responding as quickly as I can; as I am the type that hates having notifications on my phone. lol. I don't feel comfortable saying what I do in a post, as it is forward facing; though if we do connect I will absolutely say what I do.

Outside of work I'm mainly a homebody; though I am working on being more extrovert on my days off. You can find me at the gym, playing video games or chores/ meal prepping for the next couple days. For video games I pretty much play anything, especially if it's with a group of friends. Right now I've been playing Marvel Rivals and Pok√©mon Radical red.

I am looking for a long term relationship, though if it only ends up in a friendship later I am good with that. I am the type that will gladly drive and bring you coffee to your work if you want/need to. I am also probably a little addicted to coffee. I would like someone to be at the same point in life, that being ready/looking to settle down. Age range would be 28-34, but I am open to anyone as long as our goals and ideal for a relationship is inline with each other.

If you think we would connect, reach out and let's see how it goes. ",1,1740185523.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,0.67,False
1iv6qew,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideBereavement/comments/1iv6qew/guilt_over_not_reaching_out_before_he_died/,Guilt over not reaching out before he died,"It's been 7 months since an old friend of mine took his life and I can't shake the feeling that this could've been different. We were childhood friends, grew up together, like siblings. We fell out as teenagers over stupid shit. It was nothing really personal but we lost contact and that was that. 

I randomly thought about texting him last summer and asking him to catch up over coffee. He was briefly back in our hometown before heading off abroad again, and we hadn't spoken in about 6 years by this point. I eventually decided against it because I assumed he was busy with other stuff and probably wouldn't even want to hear from me. So I forgot about it, and less than a month later he killed himself. I still remember reading the text and my face going numb. 

I know it sounds stupid but I can't help feeling I could've prevented it somehow. I know in all likelihood I wouldn't have, he might have not even read the text. But perhaps having an old friend reach out would've helped with whatever state of mind he was in. I don't know. I just wish I'd done something instead of absolutely fucking nothing. 

I assumed he had the perfect fucking life, and on the surface of it, he did. A few years back he won a full-ride scholarship to study in America, where he'd always dreamt of going. He was about to go back there to start a career he'd wanted since he was a kid. He was a talented sportsman, always had been. He had tonnes of friends, a supportive family, and women threw themselves at him from all directions. From the outside looking in, I simply cannot understand why he did it, and I've made peace with the fact that I probably never will. 

My life is drastically different now compared to 7 months ago, I moved out of our hometown very shortly after it happened. I would have had to move in the near future anyway, but I felt haunted walking through the streets where we grew up together and the fields we used to play football in as kids, and I just wanted to get away from there as soon as possible tbh. I feel generally happier in life now, but a part of me is still stuck in the summer of 2024, and perhaps it always will be.

I still feel occasional waves of guilt as I'm going about my day, especially if I'm having a good day, because it reminds me he'll never get to experience one again. I don't blame myself for what happened, but I wish so, so badly that I could go back and do things differently. 

I'll stop here since I'm basically just rambling but I feel sad tonight and just needed to get things off my chest. Sending love to anyone going through a  similar situation ",3,1740185500.0,SuicideBereavement,1,1.0,False

1iv6oth,https://v.redd.it/pcm57u748lke1,First try at bottomless [Delonghi Dedica],"After upgrading to a proper grinder (Varia VS3) and seeing some immediate improvement, I‚Äôve now taken the next step in ditching the stock pressurised portafilter and trying bottomless. Picked up the Muvna version.

Having a bit of trouble getting the right settings. I‚Äôd normally dose 13g at a grind setting of 6 on the VS3 for the pressurised basket, so first try I did 14g at a setting of 1.5. (Varia suggest 1 to 3 for espresso, and watching some of Tom‚Äôs Coffee Corner Delonghi videos he seemed to use a setting of 12 on his DF63 which seems to match up according to the Honest Coffee Guide grind size chart). It completely chocked, not a drop came through and had a swimming pool on top of the puck.

Second try, I did 15g (the 14g puck seemed to be sitting quite low below the rim of the basket so upped it a bit), and did a grind size of 3. Again it struggled, but got a small bit of liquid through (about 20-25g).

The video is my third try. I did 16g (which seemed a bit too much as tamping pushed about a gram of coffee out the sides), at a grind size of 4. It initially sounded like the pump was having a hard time, but then started coming through. Got a bit less out than I normally would for a double shot with the pressurised basket, but was closer to the mark. No swimming pool on top of the puck, but it was fairly wet looking.

What should my next step be? I feel like on that third try it was just on the edge of choking, so going any finer again isn‚Äôt going to work, but then 4 already seems too course given that it‚Äôs getting close to what I would use for the pressurised basket.",1,1740185251.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

Does it ever get better?,"I‚Äôm struggling with titration and the idea that I have to take elvanse almost EVERY day until I get the right dosage/ am used to it. 

Two weeks ago I started elvanse 30mg. Last week I took the week off because I was on holiday and wanted to drink (probably a bad idea I know) but I really just wanted a break from them for a bit. The first few days on the 30 were great motivation wise but I‚Äôd crash in the late afternoon with a really low and hopeless mood. Not every day, but a good few.   

I started the 50mg yesterday because I have to, and I just felt wired and anxious and a feeling of impending doom. Yeah I felt energised and like i could do stuff, but at the same time quite stiff and distant about it like I was an alien on earth? I‚Äôm hoping that gets better or my body gets used to the dosage. I really dislike having to do this every day because all this anxiety and low mood isn‚Äôt worth it at all in my opinion. I also felt very nonverbal and just really not myself, like there was no one inside. Obviously anyone would hate that feeling and it‚Äôs scary and sad. I don‚Äôt enjoy my parents seeing me in this vacant weird way either. 

How long until I feel more normal on it/ do these negative side effects wear off eventually? Would it be really bad if I allowed myself a few days of the week not to take it, where I can just relax and have a day break and finally be able to drink coffee and alcohol or do I have to stick it out every day for a whole month/s until I‚Äôm ‚Äòallowed‚Äô to have breaks?
