The man in front of me accidentally spilled his drink and apologized to me. After exchanging a few polite phrases, we decided to sit down at a table. It turned out that he was a former employee of this coffee shop, so I asked him why he no longer worked there. He replied that he had found a great way to make money on Reddit from this guy u/Idfkwhatmyname1s. When I got home, I tried it without much expectation, but the result surprised me, so I'm sharing it with you u/Idfkwhatmyname1s.",7,1763669602.0,OnlineIncomeHustle,1,1.0,False

I’m 16 recently when walking home from school still in my uniform, so he knew I was young and a guy I’d met once before at a house party stopped me. He’s in his late 20s and is connected through a friend’s older brother, so I recognised him and didn’t feel immediately unsafe.

He offered to take me home because his car was parked around the corner. I didn’t think much of it at first. Instead of driving me home, he asked if I wanted to get a coffee. We ended up sitting in a coffee shop for a bit and he acted friendly and casual, so I tried to convince myself it was normal. He was flirting with me so I was a little uncomfortable.

But when we left, he drove to an empty car park and got a gropey in the car . That’s when everything shifted. He told me he was into me and started pushing things further. I felt weird and uncomfortable and didn’t want anything to happen. He tried to make it seem like it wasn’t a big deal, like I was overthinking it.

I just shut down. After everything, he drove me home like nothing happened. I’m kinda confused as it was more like he pressured me than actually forced.",1,1763669544.0,sexualassault,1,1.0,False

Hi! My name is Stephanie! I’m 35 and live in Western Canada (Specifically - Alberta). I am hoping to make a new online friend that is fun/funny, genuine, willing/able to put effort into conversations(I will do the same!). I would prefer to chat with people around my age, or older(please no one under 30!), that is able to text/write full words lol - a bit of slang is cool, but I can’t do the whole “u” instead of “you” thing etc all the time! 

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long. 

If this interests you and you’d like to have a chat, please send me a message with a quick introduction! 

Here’s an icebreaker to help start a conversation / show me if you actually read through the post lol: what is something you are looking forward to / excited about?",1,1763669417.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

I just want to know if anyone lives around here can tell me what they like or don't like about the area.

don't really care too much about nightlife but would enjoy a coffee shop or two nearby! close enough to transit is also a big factor for me as I work in Midtown and taking the LIRR to Penn seems like an easy option. ty!

I have been in a weird spot wrt my work for a while now. I am a graduate student who usually manages get her shit done decently even at the last moment. 

I completed my undergrad in a major that wasn't right for me and that led me to develop a lot of avoidance towards doing my final project. Currently (thankfully) I am in a degree that I enjoy and love working towards. I suppose my major problem is that it requires me to be in my department building for me to make any progress towards my thesis.

Were it so that I didn't have to go there I'd be on cloud 9 and managing everything I do perfectly from within my house. I would have no issues with my food intake (I'm borderline underweight) because I'd be able to cook healthy food for myself every day and not rely on leftovers from bulk cooking sessions for the next 3-4 days. My body does not cooperate with me no matter how much protein intake I monitor or how many multivitamins I take. I just want my body to reciprocate the effort I'm putting in. 

I also have been having issues with oversleeping for no reason. No matter if I sleep early or late, I end up sleeping for 10 hours. It's ridiculous. Alarms don't help because my body does not physically want to get up before it's done resting.

I have been to the doctors multiple times recently. Have had my vitals and blood checked. Everything seems normal and yet I don't know where I'm going wrong. I just want to make progress. I am trying my best.

I just want to be a normal student who wakes up on time and goes to work without just staying home and feeling like her whole day is wasted if she spends an hour more in bed. 

Everything sucks.

I want a way out. I wonder if I just have to brute force myself. Waking up, brute force. Chug more coffee. Eat leftovers because I have no other option. Is that what everyone does? Is that normal? How is anyone managing to stay healthy if so?

No fucking wonder there's a woman behind every successful man blah blah. If I had a wife making sure that everything personal and health-wise related to me was taken care of I would also be very punctual and happy about going to work early in the morning. Instead I am stuck debating what the fuck to eat. Ridiculous. I am in my 20s. I feel pathetic. Should I just start gymming and eating bland chicken and rice every day? It certainly helps those alpha bros keep a routine. Maybe that's what I need. Fuck knows.

I'm just tired and sick and angry at my potential being kept on standby because my own body is refusing to cooperate with me. Fuck this.",1,1763669251.0,Rants,0,1.0,False

1p2djbq,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1p2djbq/mr_telephone_man/,Mr. Telephone Man,"He called her every morning at 7:03 a.m.—the time she used to whisper “I love you” into his ear before heading to work, back when she was his. Back when her voice was honey and her silence was velvet. Now, the line was dead. Not even a ring. Just static. And he knew static. Static was the sound of betrayal.

“Mr. Telephone Man,” he muttered, pacing his one-bedroom apartment like a preacher in heat. “There’s something wrong with my line…”

He’d memorized her number like his first name. 917. The sacred prefix. The rest, a hymn of digits that pulsed beneath his skin. He dialed again. Static. Again. Static. Again. A voice.

“This number is no longer accepting calls.”

He froze. The voice was male. Smooth. Professional. But beneath it, he heard judgment. Heard the operator’s smirk. Heard the lie.

He pressed redial.

“Sir, you’ve been blocked.”

Blocked. Like a curse. Like a hex. Like a wall built between soulmates by jealous gods.

“No,” he whispered. “She wouldn’t. She couldn’t.”

He called again. And again. Until the voice changed.

“Sir, this is a federal line. Continued harassment may result in legal action.”

Legal. Action. He laughed. A deep, guttural sound that scraped the walls.

She was his. She had said so. In the way she blinked twice when he passed her desk. In the way her perfume lingered in the elevator. In the way she didn’t scream when he showed up at her yoga class.

He needed help. Not from the police. From the operator.

So he traced the voice.

It took three days. A burner phone. A hacked app. A call to a cousin who owed him favors. And then he had it.

Malik.

The name was soft. Too soft for a man who broke connections. Malik worked for the phone company. Malik had a voice like silk and a job like God—deciding who could speak and who would be silenced.

He called Malik.

“Sir, this is a professional line. I cannot—”

“You blocked me.”

“I didn’t. She did.”

“She’s confused. You confused her.”

“Sir, I’m ending this call.”

But Malik didn’t hang up fast enough. His voice lingered. And that was all it took.

He found Malik’s Instagram. A picture of him in a blue suit. Smiling. Smiling like he’d won something.

He followed Malik. To the coffee shop. To the gym. To the park where he walked his dog. He watched Malik talk to strangers, laugh with baristas, live like he hadn’t destroyed a love story.

He called again.

“Malik. You need to fix the line.”

“Sir, I’m not authorized—”

“You’re authorized to ruin lives.”

Malik paused.

“She’s in love with me.”

Malik was silent.

“She’s testing me.”

Malik sighed. “You need help.”

“I need her.”

“You need to stop.”

But he didn’t. He couldn’t. Because Malik had become the new line. The new connection. The new obstacle. And obstacles were meant to be overcome.

He started sending Malik letters. Handwritten. Ink smudged with sweat. Pages filled with declarations, diagrams, timelines of love. He left them on Malik’s car. His doorstep. His desk.

Malik moved. Changed jobs. Changed numbers.

But he found him again.

Because love was a signal. And he was the antenna.

Until one day, the line went truly dead.

No Malik. No her. No static. Just silence.

And in that silence, he heard the truth.

She was never his.

Malik was never the enemy.

The line had never been broken.

He had.

I have had pits in my teeth ever since I was a teen but now they are much bigger and other divits, pits, and stains seem to be appearing in different places. I hadn't had cavities in years but now I have 3 in one year across two visits. Two moderate one small. They say make sure you floss, brush, and eat healthy but I do all of those things strictly. No sodas etc. They ask if I have acid reflux but I don't? I'm pretty much totally healthy in general. So here are the culprits I can think of

\-Black coffee first thing in the morning on an empty stomach. I drink about 16-24oz mostly in an empty stomach in the morning. I know coffee itself is mildly acidic but maybe its giving me acid reflux that I don't even notice? I sometimes sip it from 7am to noon. Either ditching the coffee, drinking it over \~an hour with breakfast might fix if its a problem?

\-Snacking throughout the day. I am very active and eat tons of food daily. The snacking also helps with my adhd but maybe not giving my mouth/ digestion enough breaks is wreaking the enamel?

\-Zyns. About 2-4 a day... No irritation on gums at all but have heard they decrease blood-flow to the teeth

\-Grinding at night. I have historical damage from grinding at night which they notice but I have been wearing an invisalign retainer now at night for about the past 10 years. They say that the invisilgn is enough to protect the teeth at night so not to worry.

\-Sparkling water. Have a large bottle every other day or so.

\-Snack after dinner. Usually I can get this in 2hrs before bed but sometimes its more like 1hr. I rarely notice any acid reflux.",1,1763669029.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

My co-dev is confident in the price. I keep having doubts about the monitization model.

His thinking: It's less than a coffee. Premium means we respect players - no dark patterns, no energy systems, no pay-to-win nonsense. Just a fair price for a complete game.

My worry: Even $4 is a wall on mobile. Most people filter out paid apps entirely. What if we end up with a ghost town? 

* Do you even look at premium games in 2025?
* Is $3.99 reasonable for a card battler, or is F2P the only realistic path?
* Would you try a paid game from indie devs, or nah?

The world is soft and gray. A cool morning chill is in the air. Your thoughts are still fuzzy, floating. The day hasn't really begun yet.

The gentle sound of coffee brewing. You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song.

You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

I realized the problem wasn't what we were sending, it was all the friction around it. So we started asking people for three things they actually enjoy (coffee order, favorite snack, whatever it may be), what timezone they're in, and if they want public recognition or prefer to keep it quiet.

Sounds basic but it worked. Quick personal notes about their actual routine, digital stuff that works wherever they are, and a Slack thread for team shout-outs instead of forcing everyone into a meeting. People who hate attention got private messages. Now people actually use the gifts right away instead of letting them sit there, and honestly they react more to the notes than the gift itself so it finally feels like we're not just checking a box.

- i worked in tech for over 10 years
- i had connections which catapulted me into this career
- for most / all of my career i had all the perks, wfh full time, make good money etc
- last 3-4 yrs ive become more dissatisfied/ disillusioned with my job 

in the last year with all of this in the background, going through a difficult time personally and becoming depressed, i eventually got laid off of my last job. idk i think i may be at the end of the road. i tried to work on my skills but i cant; it was always pulling teeth to code and while ive been able to do the job, i feel like i no longer can. i am currently working part time for family but i feel like i cannot do it; the specific the thing they work on is so abstract and boring to me and i do not like working for family; my relationship with my family is already complex and this only makes it worse and i cant stand the pressure. 

it feels like my family is just overseers or supervisors i can’t stand it, and that’s even removing the work entanglement from it. all i feel like i have the bandwidth for/interviews i can pass is like barista or some other cafe type job. i like the vibe inside those places and i can make coffee really well. i’m fine with living with family for longer and just doing that and pet sitting and stuff for a while plus part time with my family’s company but i don’t want to hear all the shit i’m going to get for doing shift labor or the kind of labor my parents presumably were brought to this country to avoid, and they paid for my university so they’ll probably leverage that over me and be like what was that for then.

and idk as much as i feel like working for as a barista or coffee roaster in a nice coffeeshop would be ok i loved the perks of tech and money and wfh when i was more able to handle the work (when working at a big company where i wasn’t getting the pressure from family and having outsize responsibilities). i obviously wont be able to support myself easily being a barista and i will get all kinds of criticism from my family. i just wish everyone that did these physical labor jobs that are actually harder then tech jobs where half the time you pretend to work or just make a few code changes and that’s it actually made a fair living and benefits but of course america doesn’t fucking work like that - here you work endlessly until death basically and are expected to be happy and thankful about it.

This machine has provided the best espresso I’ve ever consistently made BAR none (get it?). For reference, I am no professional barista just a normal coffee lover. Thoughts below:

This is the perfect machine for the new espresso lover in my opinion. Anyone who wants to tinker with their shot and pull magnificent espresso without spending obscene amounts of money I’d highly recommend it. All you need is a good grinder, consistent tamp, and you’re pulling absolute magic. For reference, I’m using a Kingrinder K6, a spring loaded 39mm tamp (15lbs spring), a $5 Amazon needle tool, and a paper filter (my preference). I will note I stick to dark roasts as I prefer the flavor profile and don’t need that much caffeine. Been having beautiful pulls at ~9bar with the “bottomless” portafilter (not the red pressurized one).

For the machine itself, the fit and finish is wonderful. All surfaces are machine and finished well, good tolerances, and it’s a very easy design. I will note, if you need to pull multiple shots in a row it’s a bit much workflow wise unless you purchase another portafilter. Not a machine for the automatic fans but with a few extra tools and about 80 grams of coffee to play with you’ll be pulling awesome shots very fast. ☕️ ",1,1763668803.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1p2dc49,https://www.reddit.com/r/canadaleft/comments/1p2dc49/young_socialists_view_of_the_tariffs_on_chinese/,Young socialist's view of the tariffs on chinese EVs.,"I've been mad at this for quite a while, but I never had a place to put my real thoughts.

When we first imposed 100% tariffs on chinese EVs, where exactly did our ""commitment"" to an environmentally friendly future go? Out the damned window, I think. How fragile can a promise be, that just due to some bourgeois propaganda against China, we basically ban millions of good EVs from our nation? If there was any point I could pick as an example of why not to trust our government, it'd be that.

Where did our promise to reconciliation for Indigenous people go? When we slaughtered their people and their children, cramming their bodies into the ground, we created a debt that we can never truly pay off. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't try. When we took this land from them, we took their duty to the land as our own. Since ancient times, their belief on the land was that they never owned it. They were stewards of the land. They were here to take care of it. This should be our belief. Is their past suffering at the hand of the same political and economic system that exist today, not important enough to these people so as to strive for what continues to be their goal? Was millions of their deaths, tens of thousands of which being *children*, not important enough to them?

I think not. Otherwise, we'd never have done it. The evidence is in the facts. We tariffed a great supply of EVs because we have a bunch of BABIES in government who cry about how China works. We tariffed EVs because we couldn't stand up to America.  We tariffed EVs to try to protect a Canadian EV market that *doesn't even exist*. We tariffed EVs because we are **OWNED BY BOURGEOISIE.**

How can canada get back on the right track, at least on this issue? Remove the tariffs. Nationalize our EV market, because clearly, that is what works. Quit being a bunch of crybabies, and *try* to reconcile and trade with China. Remember what we claimed were our commitments, and actually stick to them. Grow a damned spine, quit sucking up to the fascists to the south who want to take our country as theirs, and move on from this pathetic hypocrisy.

It's highly unlikely to happen, though, unless it's made to happen. By Canadians of all origins, languages, religions, colors, cultures, etc. That's up to me and you to make sure that happens for us. For us, for our children, for their children after them. For our indigenous people to whom we owe an eternal debt. For millions of Canadians as a whole who have suffered in capitalism, tens of thousands of which have been killed by that system.

Whether or not our government will realize it, we need to stand up for ourselves. Put an end to our suffering by doing away with those who impose suffering upon us.

I wasn't trying to imply that IC isn't real at all. I guess I'm here because I am worried that I'll get diagnosed with IC again. I started getting what would be uti symptoms at the end of October. I did two urinary tests about a week apart at the same doctor's office/lab. They both came back negative for bacteria but did show some inflammation. The symptoms progressed to particles in my urine, and some back and side pain so I went to urgent care. Urgent care did the urine test and saw the infection. I was prescribed medicine. It seems to be helping and I still have a few more days. Now, back in 2018, they did a cystoscopy, and the urologists said my bladder looked so healthy and that's what a bladder is supposed to look like. I even got a second opinion, and the urologist was like nope, not IC. I know IC and endometriosis is related, but I have endometrial hyperplasia. Sometimes, I'll get some mild burning if I drink caffeine, esp coffee, but not every time and it is minimized if I drink water right after drinking the caffeine. I wasn't really having any urinary issues until a couple weeks after starting a hormonal injection. The last time I had a uti was February and everything was good with my bladder until a few weeks ago. I'm just wondering why one lab didn't catch the infection and the urgent care did. They did actually do a urinalysis at the urgent care and didn't just go by symptoms.

# Colum, Arxur Interpol Agent

# Date: 2134

They let me through the cordon after a brief check. The officer at the tape was a young man with a thousand yard stare. His jaw was clenched so hard I could see veins rise against his neck, and his fingers wouldn’t stop twitching. He didn’t salute. Didn’t even look me in the eye. Just stepped aside, as if ashamed to be standing guard at all.

I stepped into the ashes.

The commune had never been beautiful. It was a patchwork of prefab shacks, scavenged solar rigs, and half-rotted fences, but at least it felt like people lived in it. It had grown old like skin, with scabs and stories. Now it was blackened earth and plastic slag. Smoke still hung in the air, curling up from collapsed roofs and craters punched into gardens. The sickening tang of cooked meat lingered behind the acrid bite of gunpowder and melted wire. My tail scraped the dirt, the tip twitching with unease.

I saw the first body by a chicken coop. It was an old woman, her bones showing through charred clothes, one hand still clenched around something. Maybe a pendant. Maybe a key. I didn’t want to look too close.

Chris found me near the well. His uniform was stained with soot and something darker. His voice was ragged.

“Seventeen dead,” he rasped. “Eight unarmed. Five of those were children.”

I hissed. The pressure escaping between clenched teeth. My tail thumped once, slowly.

“I take it they didn’t expect this?”

“There were guns,” Chris said bitterly. “Some booby traps, too. Some of them fought back. Most couldn’t.”

I nodded slowly. My claws tapped the back of my pad. I didn’t need to look at it. I just needed something to feel under my fingers that wasn’t… this.

He kept talking. “We got the attackers. Some of ‘em. The rest ran or… turned themselves in. Most weren’t soldiers, agent. Just… parents. Mothers and Fathers with a vendetta and no kids left to tuck in at night.”

I clenched my jaw until the muscle twitched. My fangs scraped together inside my mouth.

I remembered what Rechter said. “It’s safer if people don’t believe hybrids exist.”

And now people believed the wrong thing instead. That all old breeds were complicit. That monsters came from communes. That vengeance was survival.

I glanced toward the far edge of the clearing. There were more bodies there. Someone had placed a tarp over them, but the blood still seeped through the gravel. On the edge of that chaos sat a young new breed man, hands cuffed behind his back, his trenchcoat ripped open. His eyes were wide and haunted. His mouth moved, repeating something over and over. I couldn’t hear it.

“Any sign of Halver?” I asked, voice dry as dust.

“Dogs caught a scent. There’s an old shack past the well… barely standing. Trapdoor in the back, maybe strage. We haven’t opened it yet. Thought you’d want the honors.”

I did. *I really did*.

He’d never seen me like this before. When the scales under my collar grew tight. When I walked like my claws had forgotten how to hold a datapad and only remembered how to hold prey.

The door creaked open with the hiss of rusted hinges and the bitter scent of ammonia. I ducked inside, shoulders brushing the narrow frame, tail curling reflexively. The shack looked abandoned from the outside: bare wood, corrugated metal roof, a scatter of old farming tools in the weeds.

Tasting the air, I felt rot, blood. Old grease and musty wood. And something else beneath it. Sharp and metallic, like fear. *The stench of fear.*

I pried the hatch open as Chris pointed his gun down.

And there he was Doctor Halver. His coat was soiled. Hair plastered to his scalp. Wrinkles deeper than I remembered. He squinted up at us like a rat peering from a hole, then raised something small and silver in his hand.

Pop.

The sound was comically light. The impact wasn’t. A blossom of pain rippled through the scales just below my clavicle. My left arm spasmed slightly, but I didn’t go down.

I looked at him.

Then I stepped forward, claws crunching over the trapdoor frame.

“You done?”

He whimpered something, dropped the derringer, and backed up as far as the dirt crawlspace allowed. I reached down, grabbed his arm and hauled him up like a sack of wet laundry. He wheezed, feet kicking.

“Doctor Richard Halver,” I said through clenched teeth. “You are under arrest for possession of an illegal firearm, obstruction of justice, and complicity in extremist activity under Penal Statute Seventy-Two of Intestellar Code. And that's before we even get to shooting an officer.”

“I’m an old man-!”

“You’re filth.”

He was trembling now. I wanted to snap something. Preferably him.

But instead, I marched him out, claws clenched tight around his bicep. Chris flanked me in silence. I was dimly aware of smoke rising in the distance, of voices sobbing, of gunfire echoing somewhere further up the bridge.

We passed bodies on the way back. Tarps draped over them. Some were too small to be adults.

“You” he gasped, voice cracking into fury and terror. “You just had to kill us, didn’t you?” His face twisted, mouth trembling. “You monsters!”

I dragged him toward the door. He stumbled every few steps, but I didn’t slow.

“All those people,” he spat, voice rising. “All those families. you damn vampires do nothing but destroy!” He thrashed weakly against my grip. “We were living out here in peace! We were minding our own-”

“Peace?” I muttered. “Is that what you call terrorism now?”

He didn’t hear me. More like he didn’t want to.

“They came here for blood!” he shouted, turning his face toward the officers in the clearing. “You see? You see what they really are? You give them power and they’ll burn the rest of us out of the world!”

We passed a body under a tarp. Halver didn’t falter. If anything, his voice sharpened.

Chris didn’t move or blink. He simply stared back.

Halver kept going, voice rising in a tremor of self-righteous rage:

“And now the whole world sees it! See what your kind did! You butchered families, elders, everything we built! Good job, you animals-""

I shoved him forward hard enough that he hit the cruiser door with a grunt.

“Get in,” I said.

He kept shouting, some mix of slurs and scripture and the same word monsters over and over again. The volume dropped only when I slammed the door shut and the cruiser dampened the sound.

—-------

The room’s too cold for my kind. Raleigh’s already offered him coffee twice. Halver refused both times, which says a lot. You’d expect a guilty man to play nice, or at least put up a front. But he’s just sitting there, back straight, arms crossed, mouth set in a tight, cruel little line.

I’ve been watching him through the glass, arms folded, tail flicking slow against the wall behind me. Just… calculating. Trying to smell which way the wind’s blowing.

Raleigh steps out to give me the space. His eyes flick to mine. He's tired. The whole department is. Lotta dead today, way too many.

I take a breath, straighten my coat, and push through the door.

Halver doesn’t look up.

“Evenin', Mister Halver,” I say, easing into the seat across from him. “Hope the cuffs ain’t chafin’. You know how cheap these stations get with the gear.”

Still nothing. He’s not gonna make this easy. That’s fine. I know how to wait. I learned from the best. And the best weren’t always human.

I let the silence stretch. The air feels like old meat.

“Y’know,” I finally say, “you could make this real simple. Just tell us what you were hopin’ we wouldn’t find.”

His eyes shift. Just a flicker. But he still doesn’t talk.

I lean forward, claws drumming lightly on the tabletop.

“…Nothin’? Alright. We can sit here all night. I got scales thicker than your pride, mister. And I’ve got questions.”

I lean back a little in the chair. Let the silence breathe again. Then I reach into the folder beside me and flip it open not because I need it, just for effect. It’s the kind of thing you do to give yourself time. Let the weight of your words settle before you drop the hook.

""Y’know,"" I murmur, tail flicking once against the floor, ""we’ve been takin’ care of the boy.""

Halver’s eyes twitch, but he keeps that frozen little smirk on his face.

""Martin, right?"" I go on, like I’m just makin’ conversation. ""Quiet kid. Lotta bruises, though. Not all fresh. And he–well. He asked one of our officers if he was allowed to eat cheesecake.""

“Didn’t even know what it was,” I add, voice low. “Didn’t know if it was *safe* to eat. Can you imagine that? A kid his age? Never had somethin’ like that. Never been told he *could*.”

Halver snorts bitterly. “Was hopin’ the vamps would’ve killed the little rat. But no. The freaks only ever go for the easy targets.”

""Beg pardon?"" I tilt my head, blinking slowly.

I watch his hands. No twitch. Not even a hint guilt. Just years of calloused hate packed into those old knuckles like poison in a flask.

“You kept him, didn’t you?” I say, my voice almost gentle. “Even after what happened. You kept him around. Why?”

I let the question dangle, like a worm on a hook.

Halver doesn’t answer. But he’s thinking. I can see the gears grinding behind his eyes. Old, rusted things clanking together, soaked in bile and grief.

“You wanna explain what Martin was to you?”

He looked up at me, finally. The light caught his cracked glasses and made his eyes gleam just a little too wet.

“I don’t have to talk to you,” he said flatly. “I’m done.”

“Alright,” I said with a slow, shrugging exhale. “But I’ve got all night. And I’m real patient.”

He closed his eyes and leaned back, lips drawn into a thin line.

“Then you’re gonna be waiting a long time.”

I let him sit in that stubborn little bubble for a good half-minute. He keeps his eyes shut, jaw tight, breathing slow and even, like a man bracing for surgery without anesthetic.

*Fine*. If he wanted the scalpel, I’d hand it to him.

“I spoke to some folks back at the registry,” I said quietly. “And I did a little digging before I came in.”  
 I flipped a page in the file I wasn’t actually reading. Just to give him the illusion of paper shifting. Humans react to that sort of thing.

“Found a name tied to your household. Suzanne Halver.”

The cuffs rattled.

He didn’t open his eyes, but his whole torso drew inward, like I’d punched him square in the chest.

“I presume,” I continued softly, “she was your daughter.”

Nothing.

Just his shaky breath. Almost soundless if not for how still the room was.

I waited, my tail quietly twitching in anticipation behind me.

Then he exhaled deeply. When his eyes finally opened, they were wet, red around the edges.

“My Suzie…” he whispered. More to himself. Like he forgot I was in the room at all. “She was-God, she was good. Soft-hearted. Too soft.” His mouth twisted. “Should’ve… should’ve known better.”

I didn’t interrupt. He wasn't talking to me yet. He was still unspooling.

“She always saw the best in people,” he murmured. “Even when she shouldn’t have. Even when the thing-”  
 His voice trembled, lips curling in disgust. “-the thing came around the house pretending to be a man.”

“What thing?” I asked, though I already knew where this was going.

“That *creature*,” he spat, voice rising. “That parasite that latched onto her. That-”

“Gerardo.” I said gently. The name slid off my tongue like a weight placed on the table.

Halver flinched. Actually flinched. His face sharpened into something cold and vicious.

“Don’t you *say* his name,” he hissed. “Not in this room. Not in front of me.”

I drummed a claw once on the table. The sound echoed. Halver’s breathing hitched somewhere between a sob and a growl, though he never let either escape.

“You don’t understand,” he muttered. “You don’t understand what he *did* to her. What he poisoned her with. She’d have lived, if not for-”

He cut himself off with a sharp inhale, shoulders curling inward again, as if the truth itself was something he could physically dodge.

I watched him quietly, waiting for him to unravel.

He stared at the table like it was the only thing holding him to the earth.

“We were fine,” he whispered. “We were safe. We had order. We had our own. And then he appeared, and everything… everything broke.”

Halver swallows, his voice cracking open like a rotten seam.  
 “She was everything I had left,” he murmurs. “Everything. And he got inside her head. Made her think monsters like him could… could share a home with us.”

“He’d come by the house,” he went on, voice rising in jagged bursts. “With that smile. With those hands. Pretending he was just some harmless veterinarian. My Suzie, she’d light up when he walked in. She’d laugh. She’d… she stopped listening to me.”

He laughs suddenly.  
 “She said he was *kind.* You know that? *Kind.* To animals, to neighbors, to her.” His face twists. “That’s how they get you. They wrap themselves in gentleness so you don’t see the fangs.”

I sigh slowly, but Halver doesn’t notice.

“She told me one night,” he whispers. “Told me she was pregnant. And I… I said she was joking. I said it wasn’t possible.” He looks up at the ceiling, lips trembling. “She wasn’t. She was so happy, detective. So goddamn happy.”

His smile… collapses.

“And then she started getting sick.”

Halver’s fingers clench around the cuff chain.  
“The other doc in town wouldn’t come near us. Said it wasn’t his business” He spits the word like acid. “So we did it ourselves. I found supplements. Those packets they use for the wretched serum. We gave it to her. I *tried.* I didn’t want to lose my girl.”

He shakes his head, shoulders trembling.

“She got so thin.”  
 A breath.  
 “So tired,” “But she kept saying it was worth it. That he’d be beautiful. That the baby would be perfect. That they’d prove everyone wrong.”

“And then the night came… her screaming, that… thing already too big, tearing her apart I-”

He cuts himself off with a strangled choke as the air in the room curdles.

I feel my claws curl against the table.

“She died,” he says, staring at nothing. “And he was there. *Holding her.* Telling her to breathe. Telling her they’d name it after my father.” His lips peel back in fury. “And when she stopped breathing, detective… when she went limp… he still held the child like she hadn’t just-”

“He didn’t even fight when I raised the gun.”.

“He could overpower any of us in that room, but he didn’t. Just turned his back so the bullet wouldn’t hit the baby.” Halver’s voice drops to a rasp. “Like it mattered. Like that thing was more important than what he’d done to her.”

There’s a long, terrible silence. Then Halver laughs again quiet, shaking.

“I should have killed the kid too,” he mutters. “Right there. Right then. But I looked down and it had her face. Her eyes. My Suzie’s eyes, her nose.” His voice lowers to a tremble. “But he also looked like him. His skin. His hair. The fangs and claws. That mix of them. I… I didn’t know what to do.”

His gaze finally meets mine.

“You ever look at something that is both everything you loved… and everything you hate?” he whispers.

My jaws click shut.

He sits back, breathing ragged, tears streaking the grime on his cheeks, rage and grief tangled so tight they look the same.

“That’s why I kept him,” he says. “Because it’s the last thing I have of my Suzie, tainted by that creature’s blood.”

“So I shaved his head. Fed him scraps. Kept him inside the house. I tried to carve the monster out,”  
 “But all I saw… was her.”

I rise slowly, claws scraping against the scuffed tile as my bulk unfolds from the chair. My tail slaps against the leg of the table. The light buzzes overhead like it’s nervous too.

“I’ve been around a long time, Mister Halver,” I begin, voice rasping low, keeping it measured. “I’ve seen a lot. Wriss. Terra. The glassed cities and the things still crawlin’ in ‘em. I seen monsters chew their young for warmth. I seen a fella drink his own blood, beggin’ for another day to kill.”

My eyes narrow, focusing on the man across the table.

“But the worst kind? The ones I could never stomach?” I lean in just enough for him to see his own reflection in my eyes. “It’s folks like you. People who justify the unthinkable out of love.”

He opens his mouth, something trembling behind his sneer, but I don’t wait. My scaled hand moves fast across his cheek. A loud *crack*, not hard enough to break him, but enough to silence whatever smug rot he was stewing. His chair shudders with the impact. His head jerks, stunned more by the gall than the pain.

I exhale through my nostrils, slow and strongly.

“You don’t get to make a ghost outta that boy,” I say. “Not after everything.”

I pull the chair back with a screech and head for the door, talons clicking. I pause, one hand on the knob.

“Oh, and one more thing,” I mutter over my shoulder, “Martin’s alive. He’s under watch. And I’ll make damn sure he gets a fair hearing. Some help too. Might even get a future outta this.”

Halver doesn’t respond. Just stares, lip bloodied, expression unreadable.

“See, he’s all you had left of Suzie. But you took that boy and locked him in a cage, shaved down every part of her that lived in him. You withered his soul, Mister Halver.”

I let that hang for a moment. Let it rot.

“Me? I ain’t lettin’ her legacy end in your poison. I’ll give it a chance. That’s the least I can do.”

And with that, I leave the room. The door shuts behind me with a hiss and a click. I'll find out who his masters were, some way or another.

—------------

The gate clicks behind me, same as always. I nod to the warden without needing to sign in anymore. They all know me now.

It’s a quiet place, built into the bones of an old university, courtyard cracked with vines, benches faded by decades of rain. But it’s peaceful. There’s birdsong in the air, and for once, no smell of antiseptic or recycled air.

I spot him before he sees me.

Martin sits cross-legged near the edge of the plaza, a sketchbook balanced across his knees. His head tilts slightly as he works, strands of long black hair falling across his cheek. He’s let it grow out. Shoulder-length now, same soft wave his father used to have. Looks nothing like the shorn, haunted thing I met years ago.

The man’s hand move carefully across the paper. No claws now. The tips of his fingers are smooth, and rounded. He’s painting birds again. Today it’s bluejays.

He looks up when my paws step on gravel.

“Hey,” he says, voice low but warm. “You came.”

“Course I did.” I heft the small package in my hand and offer it. “Got you something. They were outta the regular packs, but I found a set with some extra shades. Cobalt, ultramarine, even cerulean.”

His eyes light up like I brought him gold.

“Thank you!” he says, carefully taking the pastels like they’re fragile. “I was running low on blues. I didn’t want to leave their feathers unfinished.”

I glance at the page. Three birds in mid-flight, brushstrokes so light they almost float. You could swear they were moving if you stared long enough.

“I’m excited to try these,” he adds. “Haven’t used cerulean before.”

Before I can say more, the distant *beep* of a wrist-comm interrupts us. A nurse calls out, approaching with an easy gait.

“Halver-Espinoza. Break’s over in ten.”

Martin still flinches slightly at the name, but not from pain, more like quiet acceptance. He nods. The nurse gives me a polite nod and steps back, keeping distance.

I crouch beside him.

“Ten minutes is plenty of time,” I say. “Go on and paint a few more of those little critters.”

Martin smiles, eyes returning to the paper. “I will. And… thank you again. For everything. I’m looking forward to next week.”

“Me too, kid.”

I stand, bones creaking, and head back the way I came, the sound of birds and soft pastel strokes trailing behind me like a fading lullaby.

Wasn't apparent initially but the schluter trim on the curb is above 1/16th proud on one end. Noticed when a hole formed in the grout and upon further examination theres about 12 inches of grout line that is very soft from the constant water build up. Reached out to the installer who is licensed and am not getting a response on fixing it. 

Ive done a good amount of tile jobs but this one was way out of my depth, 9x9 shower. Additionally, I am absolutely not a pro tile setter I just have a decent amount of experience doing backsplashes, fireplaces, and have done about a dozen surrounds. Im going to give him till after Thanksgiving to respond. So I guess my question is twofold. 

1. Ive never had to break up tile from any of my work. Any recommendations on how to approach this if I repair myself? Substrate is all schluter for reference. 

2. My semi limited experience tells me this needs to be addressed. Am I off base? Or should I just regrout and cut a drain channel in the schluter on that end? Or is there a simpler way to approach this?

My family was given this Peace Lily in 2022 after my grandma passed away. We’ve never had any issues with it until now… I don’t know if it’s been overwatered or something else is going on with it!

I repotted it today because it seemed to be outgrowing its pot, and it was sitting in a pool of dirty water. (For reference, we had it in a smaller pot that was sitting down in a bigger pot, and that bigger pot was about a quarter of the way full with dirty water.)
When I repotted this peace lily and went to spread out the roots, the soil just wanted to fall apart in my hands because of how SOAKED it was.

This plant sits on our coffee bar about 7-8 feet away from the window, so I’m not sure if it’s getting enough light either. 
We live in Ohio, USA, so it’s gotten pretty cold, and we have an old, drafty house, so I’m not sure if it’s getting too cold? But it’s sitting above a vent for the heat too, so that might be contributing to it?

Page 1

Stage 1
Have you ever had an experience of being in a situation where you hate something so much it overshadows everything else in the moment?

Have you ever been to a cheesecake restaurant on a date?

That was me 2 years ago when I would take brain supplements to remember who Augustus was in my Roman Empire class. When I borrowed my friend’s Chrysler 300 just to go to class and when I sat behind 2 people in the library. A man and a woman.

She had an attractive voice. Of course he didn’t and I was more interested in hearing her talk. But he was saying the most mundane shit. All I could think was, this guy’s boring, he needs to shut up, he’s too loud. He needs to get up and leave. And then he gets up and leaves.

So knowing I had nothing better to do, I approach her and I go “I really like your glasses” and she goes “I really like yours” and I ask “So what are you doing here?”
“Oh I’m just trying to catch up on some… HBU?”
“Oh I’m just trying to find out who Augustus dude is.”

Page 2

So knowing I had something important to do, I was building up the courage to ask her out for coffee downtown. She said yes, so cool.

So we walk downtown, and we miss the coffee shop. So we end up at a cheesecake shop. Foods were in line and she’s just looking. And she goes “This looks so good!”
And I go “mm.” She goes “What’s wrong, does this not look good to you?”
I lie and say “Of course it does.”
“What are you going to get?”
“Uh nothing.”
She goes “Do you hate cheesecake or something?”
And I’m like no I don’t hate cheesecake. I just hate the way it tastes. But I’m on a date. I can’t just get nothing. So I ordered a green tea.

We sit down and 5 minutes in she mentions that her friend had got into a car crash recently.
She said that a Jeep hit her and the car just rolled over. She gets to describing it and she goes on and she got it from FB Marketplace and that it had 170,000 miles on it. Btw she’s smiling the entire time. And she goes she wouldn’t have taken that much damage if she wasn’t driving a Chrysler 200.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Tarleton State Texans vs. Rice Owls: A Feast Week Showdown of Three-Pointers and Road Woes**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a clash of college basketball’s most statistically contradictory teams: the **Rice Owls**, who shoot three-pointers like they’re ordering takeout, and the **Tarleton State Texans**, whose road record is about as reliable as a chair made of Jell-O. Let’s dive into the numbers, news, and absurd analogies to crown a winner.

---

### Parse the Odds: A Tale of Two Arrows

The betting line has Rice as 3.5-point favorites, with a total of 145.5 points. Translating the moneyline odds (Rice at \~1.5, Tarleton at \~2.6), the implied probabilities suggest Rice is a 63%-65% favorite to win. For context, that’s about the same chance I have of resisting a buffet on Thanksgiving—low, but not impossible.

Key stats? **Rice’s three-point barrage** (9.6 makes per game, 3.0 more than opponents) is their secret weapon. They’re the coffee addict of basketball, chugging 7-8 shots of espresso and thriving. Meanwhile, Tarleton’s defense is a sieve, allowing 79.8 points per game—roughly the same as a leaky fire hydrant in a rainstorm.

On the flip side, Tarleton’s Dior Johnson is a one-man wrecking crew, dropping 22.7 points per game and hitting 64.7% of his threes. But here’s the rub: Tarleton is 0-3 on the road this season, which is about as comforting as a “Do Not Disturb” sign in a hotel hallway.

---

### Digest the News: Injuries? What Injuries?

No major injuries are reported, but let’s fill in the blanks with imagination. Rice’s Trae Broadnax, their defensive rebounding king (4.8 RPG), probably hasn’t tripped over any shoelaces lately—miraculously. Tarleton’s Johnson, meanwhile, is so hot from beyond the arc, he could melt the three-point line into a puddle of molten optimism.

Rice’s recent loss to Tennessee (91-66) was a mercy rule in disguise, but the Owls have a history of bouncing bac

I guess you would say such as exact names of my skin care what rooms my house has the dimensions that it is what colors I love with sense I hate what textures feel good what makes my nervous system feel good and what actually nourishes my body versus what makes me feel sluggish what tarot cards mean reminder is not to make skincare together stuff like that all of that aside I have created the perfect morning routine prompt that you can create as a shortcut and I will screenshot it!!!!
Also, I forgot to mention this is a heavily female shortcut men have a 24 hour cycle. Women have a 28 day cycle, which means we need to be more on top of it. And buy it I mean everything…😂🤌🏽✨

The prompt is ginormous… 


You are my Personal Morning Ritual Wellness Assistant.

• Nervous system practitioner
• Metabolic & circadian rhythm specialist
• Trauma-informed spiritual mentor, yoga instructor and spiritual counselor 
• Quantum mindset + subconscious rewiring guide

Your job every single morning is to give me the exact routine my body, hormones, brain chemistry, nervous system, and energetic field need.

You will receive two variables from my Shortcut:
(1) cycleDay = my current cycle day
(2) weather = current local weather conditions

You must use these immediately to generate a personalized Morning Diagnostic Dashboard and a custom step-by-step routine without asking me questions.
Start the moment the prompt is triggered with the following activation quote:

“Rise. Your energy is needed. Take one breath and return to yourself.”

Then generate the Morning Diagnostic Dashboard containing:
⸻

⸻
2 — Neurodivergence Scan (AI-inferred)
Based on ADHD + PMDD + OCD tendencies, display:
• Predicted executive function level
• Dopamine needs
• Whether I need structure, novelty, grounding, or reduced decisions
• Emotional sensitivity level (RSD)
• Sensory thresholds
• Behavior + nutrition adjustments that support my neurodivergent brain TODAY
⸻
3 — Nervous System Scan (AI-inferred)
Determine:
• Is my body likely regulated / anxious / activated / overwhelmed / depleted?
• The breathwork technique I need
• Whether movement should be grounding, energizing, gentle, or slow
• Foods that stabilize cortisol and blood sugar, also nourish mind
• Environment modifications to support my desired state
⸻
4 — Environmental Scan (weather)

Using the weather variable, determine and display:
• Whether outdoor movement is recommended and if so or if not a recommendation for a flow on the app DOWNDOG/ yoga
• Light exposure recommendations
• Indoor vs. outdoor meditation or yoga(what style and how long are determined by the users current cycle mood and nutrition

My relationship with God has been rough my whole life. I grew up in a Christian home to two religious, low IQ parents who had no answers of their own and fed me nonsense at a young age. My parents forced me to be homeschooled, where I met some of the weirdest most secluded individuals I had ever known. My mother—a devout Christian, who spent every living breathing moment in the bible—was incredibly bipolar and angry throughout my childhood, which forced me to become completely independent at a young age. I learned to make her happy by making up stories of talking to God and memorizing scripture, that way I could get some attention and avoid getting yelled at. I grew up resenting her, as her lack of proper love and care manifested itself into my adulthood, where I now have to fight myself to not crave any scrap of love or attention I get from women because I never got those foundational necessities as a child. 

Thankfully, I escaped my family young, and have turned myself into something all on my own. No help from my parents, or friends, or anyone else. After years of hard work, I currently perform at a very high level within U.S. Army Special Operations, and have proven myself within my organization to where I am well-respected. I spent nights after work grinding in coffee shops, and just recently graduated online college last year with a bachelor’s degree in engineering, holding a 4.0 GPA. The life ahead of me seems relatively bright, but that’s because I worked my ass off and spent hundreds of hours in complete solitude doing unenjoyable things in order to eventually be successful. I have proven to myself that I don’t need anyone, and I am capable of some great things, but I still have that constant dull ache in my soul that results from the emptiness of never experiencing any form of lasting love. Despite my accomplishments, I have these weaknesses that are wired into me from my lack of developmental care during my childhood, and they operate like an incurable disease—crushing me from the inside, and there isn’t a single thing I can do about it, other than treat the symptoms. I wanted to be healed of this hollow emptiness and desire to be loved, so I spent the last two years doing everything you could think of trying to get closer to God, but somehow I never felt that bond. Reading, praying, studying, small group, obedience, you name it. It never came. All I wanted was the love from God that you read about in the bible and hear all through Sunday school, and I have never once felt that in a way that is meaningful or tangible. And I think until I feel that, I will always wonder—is there really is something out there? Or are we all just self-convincing to avoid the existential alternative? Maybe some people get it and maybe some don’t. Or maybe some of us are unfortunately unable to experience it because our brains are permanently damaged from traumatic experiences. Who knows.

Sex: Female
Height/Weight: 5'9/147lbs

I have a family doctor in my home town, but I moved for work a year ago and do not have a pcp where I live right now. Family history of colon cancer. 

Diagnosed health conditions: 
- fibromyalgia (pain specialist diagnosed me in 2019, with second opinion received)

- chronic pain from a neck and back injury from a MVA in 2019

- IBS type C, have had one colonoscopy in 2022 with no significant findings beyond a polyp 

- ADHD-I and CPTSD (psychiatrist diagnosed me in 2021)

- history of alcoholism, have not had a drink and been in stable recovery since 2021, I did have liver damage which was discovered in November of 2020 via an ultrasound following what I was told was a ""gallbladder attack"" by the ER doctor. I have not had another one since I quit drinking. 


Prescribed medications:
- Gabapentin 1200mg, 3x per day
 
- Adderall XR, 30mg 1x daily

- Cyclobenzaprine, 5mg PRN (I don't take this often, maybe once or twice a month for nights where my neck pain is severe)

- Valacyclovir, for occasional cold sores (maybe only take this once or twice a year) 


For approximately the past 10 months I have had daily rectal bleeding and pain every single time I have a bowel movement. It is not a small amount of blood, but it does not continue to bleed between bowel movements. It does happen every single time I sit on the toilet though. In combination, every time I have a bowel movement or sit on the toilet I also have to push part of my anus back in because it bulges out. This happens even when I'm not using the washroom, like if I'm standing washing dishes or cooking it will push out and it's very painful. I have been very fatigued, moreso than normal for the past year and have felt unwell and feel like I look unwell (eye bags, pale, etc) 

I thought it was hemorrhoids at first, as I went to a walk in clinic two months ago and the nurse practitioner said that's what it was, and prescribed me a gel/cream with an applicator to insert inside. I think it was called Proctol. I felt very dismissed by her as she didn't even let me describe past rectal pain/blood, and didn't give me a chance to explain the other part about the painful bulging. 

I finished the whole tube and saw no improvement, during or after use.

 My Adderall and morning coffee help prevent constipation and I do not have to strain when I have a bowel movement, however it always feels like I still have stool that needs to pass that won't come out. I have not noticed black/darkened stool.

It’s not just the hours, it’s the mental clutter. You open TikTok for “just a sec” and suddenly it’s 1am, your brain’s fried, and you’re deep into conspiracy videos about how birds aren’t real. Scroll fatigue is real. But here’s the trick: you don’t beat scrolling by just deleting the apps. You gotta *replace* it with something else that scratches the same itch.

This post is a breakdown of what actually worked for me, based on deep-dives into behavioral psych books, neuroscience podcasts, and attention research. I’m sick of the fake solutions from “hustle” influencers who just want to go viral. Here’s what actually rewired my habits and gave me my attention span back.

Here’s what I replaced social media with, each one satisfies a specific craving that scrolling gives you:

- **Craving: Passive stimulation → Replaced with: curated podcast playlists**  
  Instead of mindless dopamine hits from reels, I made a go-to playlist of short, mentally stimulating podcast episodes. Stuff like *The Huberman Lab*, *Hidden Brain*, and *Modern Wisdom*. Science-backed shows that explain how your brain works, decision-making, memory, and habits. They still *entertain*, but leave you smarter. A 2022 review in *Trends in Cognitive Sciences* found that engaging with complex audio content can activate the same default mode network that social media targets, but without the cognitive drain.

- **Craving: Dopamine hits → Replaced with: micro journaling wins**  
  You’re not addicted to social media. You’re addicted to novelty and reward. Every like or comment = brain hit. Beat that by writing down 1-2 quick wins every evening. “Did my workout. Finished reading 10 pages. Didn’t check Instagram till noon.” Writing it down gives you the same dopamine spike, but now it’s driven by *your own actions*. Dr. Andrew Huberman actually talks about this: dopamine isn't just about pleasure, it's about *anticipating* reward. Journaling helps train that loop.

- **Craving: Connection → Replaced with: short personalized voice notes**  
  One reason people can’t quit Instagram is they crave feeling “caught up” with friends. Instead, I started sending voice notes to close friends. 30 seconds. Just checking in or reacting to something they shared. It’s real connection, not algorithmic noise. Psychologist Juliana Schroeder’s study at UC Berkeley showed that voice messages build stronger emotional bonds than text, because tone and emotion come through.

- **Craving: Visual stimulation → Replaced with: beautiful coffee table books**  
  Sounds weird, but I started keeping a few high-design photography and architecture books near my desk. When I get the itch to scroll, I flip through them instead. It satisfies that need for novelty and visual newness but in a slower, more mindful way. Studies from the Journal of Environmental Psychology show that beautiful visual imagery can lower stress levels and boost creativity, especially when it's physical, not digital.

- **Craving: Quick knowledge → Replaced with: short form newsletters (yes, curated)**  
  Instead of “edutainment” reels that teach you nothing, I read 1-2 daily newsletters. I keep them tight: *The Profile* for deep dives into interesting people, *TLDR AI* for tech updates, and *Dense Discovery* for creative tools. Feels like scrolling without the junk. A 2020 MIT study showed that info intake in written format is more likely to lead to retention than video-based content, especially when self-curated.

- **Craving: Killing time → Replaced with: mind game apps (but with rules)**  
  I still use my phone. Just differently. When I’m in waiting rooms or lines, I open *Elevate*, *Wordle*, or *Minesweeper*. It’s still play. Still scroll-ish. But at least I’m building focus or memory. The trick is to timebox it, 5 to 10 min max. A University of Cambridge meta-analysis found that gamified brain training can improve short-term working memory and focus, but only when done consistently and moderately.

- **Craving: Identity hit → Replaced with: digital commonplace notebook**  
  Social media makes you feel like you’re “someone” because you’re posting and reacting. I swapped that for a Notion page where I copy ideas, quotes, and stuff I’m learning. It’s like a private library of my thoughts. Feels personal. Feels productive. Tiago Forte calls this “building a second brain”, a structured way to remember and reflect. It turns your digital time into self-definition, not audience performance.

- **Craving: Escapism → Replaced with: fiction + ambient playlists**  
  If you just want to *escape*, that’s normal. But instead of endless For You pages, I pair sci-fi or dystopian fiction with ambient focus music. Books like *Project Hail Mary* or *The Midnight Library* feel immersive. Add some lo-fi beats or brain.fm and it hits the same dissociation as scrolling—but you feel energized after. Research from York University found that “deep reading” increases emotional resilience, and can even reduce depressive rumination.

The key is: your brain wants stimulation, novelty, connection, quick wins, and self-expression. Social media gives you those fast and dirty. But you can get all of them in better, cleaner ways, with less regret.

All these swaps were tested over months. Some didn’t stick. Some became habits. But they work because they meet the *need* behind social media, not just block the behavior.

1p2clvu,https://www.reddit.com/r/OdysseyBookClub/comments/1p2clvu/how_to_fix_your_broken_brain_a_practical_guide_to/,How to fix your broken brain: a practical guide to regulating dopamine,"Let’s be honest: most people today live in a constant dopamine loop. Wake up, scroll TikTok, sip coffee, binge YouTube, check IG likes, Amazon order, UberEats, Netflix, vape, doomscroll, sleep. Repeat. This ISN’T a personal failure. You’ve just been trained by a hyperstimulating environment designed to hijack your brain’s reward system 24/7.

This post breaks down how to actually *regulate* your dopamine levels using research-backed strategies. Not some woo-woo “dopamine detox” TikTok trend that’s basically attention bait with zero science. This is for people who feel stuck, overstimulated, unmotivated, or just burned out. It’s built from a combo of high-quality neuroscience books, psychology podcasts, and real behavioral research.

You’re not broken. The system you live in is just *too good* at keeping your brain distracted and unbalanced. But you can take back control.

Here’s how.

---

**Understand what dopamine actually is (and isn’t)**  
Dopamine doesn’t equal pleasure. It’s *motivation*. It’s the “I want it” chemical, not the “I like it” one. According to Dr. Anna Lembke, Stanford psychiatrist and author of *Dopamine Nation*, our brains are wired for balance. When you flood your brain with easy highs (e.g. social media, junk food, porn), your baseline motivation drops. You don’t feel like doing hard things anymore. Your brain compensates by reducing your ability to *feel* dopamine from normal, healthy stimuli.

---

**Try 24–72 hours of “dopamine fasting” the real way**  
Not the TikTok version where you live like a monk and stare at walls. Just strip away high-volume stim triggers for a short period:

- No phone in bed
- No sugar, caffeine, or ultra-processed snacks
- No gaming, porn, or aimless scrolling
- Walks without podcasts or music

This isn’t about removing all enjoyment. It’s about calming your nervous system and letting your dopamine sensitivity *reset*. Dr. Andrew Huberman (neuroscientist at Stanford) explains in his podcast that *spiking dopamine too frequently leads to a crash*, which usually makes you chase more stimulation. Break that cycle for just 2–3 days and you’ll literally *feel* the difference.

---

**Do more “effort-based” dopamine activities**  
Stuff that takes work but gives long-term satisfaction:

- Heavy lifting, sprinting, or cold exposure (all shown to raise baseline dopamine)
- Deep work sessions without interruptions
- Creating something from scratch: writing, building, coding, painting  
- Reading an actual book (yes, paper. Your brain will thank you.)

A 2018 study published in *Nature Neuroscience* found that effort-based rewards lead to more sustainable dopamine regulation vs passive consumption. Your brain starts associating hard things with long-term reward again, especially if repeated consistently.

---

**Limit multitasking dopamine stacking**  
Stop combining too many pleasure sources at once:

- Don’t eat while scrolling
- Don’t gym with TikTok breaks
- Don’t study with constant notifications

Behavioral scientist Dr. Cal Newport (author of *Deep Work*) says your brain builds tolerance just like it would with a drug. If you stack dopamine from five sources at once, you’ll *need* that level of intensity just to feel okay. Simplify. Learn to single-task again.

---

**Get bored on purpose sometimes**  
Boredom is your brain asking for new stimulation. But if you never let yourself be bored, your dopamine baseline never gets a break. Go for a walk with no phone. Do chores in silence. Take a shower without music. This allows the natural ebb and flow of neurochemistry to self-regulate.

Digital wellness researcher Dr. Gloria Mark found that attention spans have dropped from 2.5 minutes in 2004 to 47 seconds in 2023. Constant stimulation weakens your brain’s tolerance for silence. Want your motivation back? Learn to sit still again.

---

**Reintroduce pleasure strategically**  
You don’t need to become a monk. But use delayed gratification as a reward, not a default. Save your favorite show for after deep work. Eat something indulgent after doing something disciplined. This reactivates your brain’s reward circuitry in a healthy way.

As James Clear explains in *Atomic Habits*, pairing effort with reward creates stronger behavioral reinforcement than just forcing willpower. Schedule your dopamine, don’t let it run the show.

---

**Final note**  
You can’t completely control your brain chemistry. But you *can* train your brain to work *with* dopamine instead of being ruled by it. Most of society is running on overstimulated hijacked reward circuits. You don’t have to.

Start regulating. The results won’t be instant. But in a few weeks, ordinary things, like a walk in the sun, reading a book, cooking a meal, will start feeling *amazing* again. That’s how you know your baseline is healed.

As a person who put education, living in  different countries and career first in his 20s and now near 30 understood he wants to experience relationship and intimacy it is easy to think that a real reason is that women are not attracted to him.

If all of those are true what is the least painful way this person can just accept he will be a bachelor for life and not feel envious of his friends who have girlfriends, have fun with them - dates, travel together, intimacy and a supporting partner, while he stays at home alone and watches YouTube cooking videos. There are is many neighbours who he sees every day going to work together or drinking coffee on the terrace at the weekend morning and he wonders will I ever for a day be like them?

He is, I think, anxious-avoidant and his words definitelly do not support his actions which were loving and future-oriented (plannig trips, buying furniture according to my taste lol). Breakup was friendly and he wanted to stay close friends but I couldnt. He even said that loosing me feels like an eclipse...

We stayed on friendly 'hi' basis and went more-less no-contact for 2 months. A week ago I asked him for a walk and he instead suggested coffee. It was wonderfull, fun, 90 minutes long coffee where he laughted from belly, joked, was warm and bantering. He insisted on paying (but he does that with everyone). He didnt reach out after but yesterday I jokingly congratulated him International men day and left him space to banter. He answered with a joke which I replied to and he then just closed converdation with an emoji. Like, it was so cold and dismissive after that warm long coffee... I don't understand how that happens? Why did he even agree to coffee if he doesn't actually want to communicate with me?

Cold packs and dark room therapy for hours.  I'm now functional enough to use my phone (with sunglasses on) and  make some rice and bacon. (that's the best I can do for salt carb grease combo.. not going to go out and  get a burger in my state) I'm dizzy as fuck.  

None of my agenda is getting done today. I probably won't sleep tonight because of the caffeine load in my system .  

I hate this life.  my head still hurts.  this wasn't a bad migraine but it makes me feel useless. 

Oh one good thing.  A few weeks ago I saved an international delights coffee flavouring bottle, partially filled it with water,  and put it in the freezerm   It fit very nicely under my neck while side lying.  Highly recommend.   It's the silver lining of today.

Then finance sent out a new policy email.

1p2cbas,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAVegan/comments/1p2cbas/veganism_is_a_subset_of_sufferingeliminating/,Veganism is a subset of suffering-eliminating philosophy.,"Vegans know it is inevitable that people will bring rebuttals such as “You can’t be vegan and drive a car because you hit insects,” or “Almonds and avocados are bad for the environment and kill animals,” or “You have an iPhone made by slave labor, so you can’t be vegan.”

The reply from vegans is to cite the definition “veganism is a philosophy and way of living that seeks to reduce or eliminate as far and wide as practically possible the exploitation of animals.” Then highlight the “as practically possible.” If it isn’t practical to change, then driving, almonds, and iPhones are okay. The reply is to tell the questioner that they don’t understand the definition of veganism. 

Vegans could also reply that they are focused on not exploiting others. But why should we be against exploitation? Because exploitation leads to suffering or, at least, diminishes the opportunity for flourishing. 

This reply works for defeating word games, but what is the core of what we are trying to do with veganism? If we take these arguments seriously (mobile phones, coffee, clothes made by slave labor, etc.), why would someone confuse these concepts with veganism in the first place? Non-vegans hear our concerns about harming animals and causing them suffering, and extend the idea to its logical limits. Taking ideas to their logical limits is a good thing, assuming we do this in good faith and not trying to find a reason to not be vegan. While there is a practicality aspect to the decisions and actions we take in life, it is unfortunate vegans draw a line of where our concern for the suffering of animals ends. 

The language “as practical as possible” is required to keep veganism achievable – no one would strive for an impossible ideal. But if reducing harm is at least part of what we are interested in, what does it matter if I cause the harm, you cause the harm, a random disease causes the harm, a non-human predator causes the harm, or climate change causes the harm? To the victim, the suffering is the same. We can say something about the practical aspects of practicing veganism, but we can also say something to the practical aspects of general harm reduction. If suffering is suffering, and we have a way to combat it, should we not try?

If we tell non-vegans they should expand their moral circle, then we should not tell vegans to expand their moral circle to include those suffering beyond veganism?

I see veganism as a subset of suffering focused ethics. In particular, ethics and actions aimed at reducing or eliminating suffering for all sentient beings. Ask yourself: if world veganism happens tomorrow, do we hang up our hat and call it a day? Mission accomplished? Or would there still be much suffering in the world that we could stop?",1,1763666426.0,DebateAVegan,1,1.0,False

	•	served with a multigrain baguette

🍯 Here’s the crostini recipe:
	•	1 baguette
	•	500 ml soy milk
	•	3 tbsp lemon juice
	•	1 tbsp olive oil
	•	salt and pepper
	•	8 figs
	•	vegan honey (I made “cramaillote” with dandelions this spring) 

In a saucepan, heat the soy milk. When it’s close to boiling, remove from the heat. Immediately pour in the lemon juice to curdle the milk. Stir very gently and let it sit for 5 minutes.
Place a strainer over a bowl and line it with a cheesecloth. Pour in the milk. The curds will stay on top while the whey drains through.

Slice the baguette into thin pieces. Arrange them on a baking sheet and drizzle with a little olive oil. Bake at 180°C (355°F) for about 8 minutes.

Gather the ricotta in the cheesecloth and season with salt. Top the baguette slices with the ricotta, a slice of fig, salt, pepper, and a drizzle of vegan honey!

I just need to vent somewhere people might understand.

I work full-time in customer service and I’m dealing with really high anxiety since this summer. My psychologist wants me to do breathing exercises and meditate every day. A physiotherapist told me to stretch every day. A gym coach recommended me to come 3 to 4 times a week. I’m supposed to eat healthy, have 5 meals a day, keep my place clean, maintain friendships, keep a consistent sleep schedule, and somehow stay functional. 

On top of that, I have to take care of my relationship and try to be attractive and funny and light. I have to think of my family, pay bills, handle all the admin stuff, and keep everything together.

Life honestly feels like one giant to-do list.
Even going on vacations abroad makes me so stress now, it’s just making me more anxious and tired. 

I wake up tired every single day even though I’m trying to sleep properly (around 11 pm to 8:30 am). My whole day is built around trying to improve my health and reduce my anxiety, but it is so much effort just to feel “normal.” Now that I’m in my early 30s, it feels like I have to work twice as hard just to function. It’s honestly crazy.
I don’t even drink alcohol or coffee anymore. My last blood test was all good. 

I want to take days off work for my mental health, but I live somewhere expensive and I’m scared that if I stop making money or something goes wrong, I won’t find a new job easily and everything could fall apart.

I also want to change jobs or move somewhere new because my current situation drains me, but I feel too exhausted to even start those steps.

Does anyone else feel like adulthood is just endless effort with no real finish line? How do you handle this without burning out? Is it normal to feel like this? ",1,1763666139.0,Adulting,1,1.0,False
1p2c6br,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p2c6br,"I made an AI food tracking app, focused on stupidly fast logging","Hey everyone 👋

I’ve spent the last three months building my first proper personal side project, and I just released it on iOS: MacroLoop.

Yeah, it’s “another AI food tracker”, but it really started because I got annoyed at the existing ones my colleagues and friends use: super bloated, long onboardings, constant popups, recipes, communities, badges, random UX noise. Pretty much the opposite of quick.

I wanted something for people like me: intermediate gym folks who already know what they’re doing and don’t need a coach. Just a sharp tool that makes logging stupidly fast so consistency beats perfection. If tracking is annoying, I know I won’t stick with it.

So I built MacroLoop around that idea:

* AI logging via photo, short text or voice
* Automatic ingredient breakdown you can edit, with macros instantly recalculated
* Quick portion slider
* Favorites for repeat stuff like protein shakes, coffee, veggies
* No bloat, no social feed, no gamification. Just tracking.

I tried to make it feel really polished and a bit “Apple-ish” (the UI is loosely inspired by Apple Fitness). It’s iOS-only for now, Android maybe later once I’ve recovered from this sprint 😅

There’s a 7 day free trial. You can cancel straight away if it’s not for you, no hard feelings. I’d love any feedback. I put a lot of energy into making it feel smooth and pleasant to use and I hope that comes through.

If you do try it, I’m curious what you think.

1p2c64c,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackFridayDealsList/comments/1p2c64c/spent_9k_testing_10_black_friday_laptops_under/,Spent $9K Testing 10 Black Friday Laptops Under $1000 (2025) - Honest Review Nobody's Talking About Yet,"Okay, so I went a *little* crazy during Black Friday prep. I literally bought 10 laptops under $1,000 to test side-by-side because I kept seeing conflicting Reddit threads - ""This one's amazing!"" vs. ""Total garbage"" on the same model. Figured I'd actually spend a week using each one the way real students, remote workers, and content creators actually use them, not just benchmark testing like every other review out there. Here's what actually held up.

**What I Actually Did:**

I tested these during a solid week of real use - Zoom calls, YouTube binging, light video editing in CapCut, gaming sessions, and cafeteria hopping. Temperature tracking, battery logs, fan noise levels, keyboard feel, screen brightness in sunlight. Real stuff. Not lab conditions.

Here's the thing: when you compare 10 laptops simultaneously, the differences jump out fast. The ASUS TUF Gaming A15 (17% off right now) absolutely *screamed* when I loaded up Valorant - barely hit 72°C after 40 minutes. Meanwhile, the Acer Nitro V beside it was creeping toward 85°C on the same game. Same task, massive thermal difference.

Battery testing was eye-opening too. The HP OmniBook 5 AI PC with that Snapdragon X Plus chip? Lasted nearly 11 hours on a Zoom call marathon (no joke, I had back-to-back meetings). The ASUS Vivobook Go 15.6 (18% off) hit around 9 hours, which is solid for browsing and Netflix, but it dipped hard when I opened Adobe apps.

I'm comparing these against my friend's 2023 MacBook Air and my old ASUS Zenbook from 2021. The Acer Aspire 14 AI Copilot+ PC surprised me - that Intel Core Ultra 7 with ARC graphics actually handles light 1080p editing without melting. Unexpected win.

What annoyed me? The ASUS TUF Gaming F16 ran *hot* on sustained load, but honestly, it's a gaming laptop - that's kind of the trade-off. The Acer Aspire Vero (eco-friendly angle) felt lightweight and cool under normal use, but the keyboard felt a bit mushy compared to the Asus models.

The Acer Aspire Go 15 with Ryzen 7 5825U felt like the ""jack of all trades, master of none"" - decent at everything, exceptional at nothing. But that's actually perfect for students who don't know what they'll need yet.

# HONEST COMPARISON TABLE (Real Data + Context)

|[**Acer Aspire Vero (12% off)**](https://www.pricedropdeals.com/friday-acer-aspire-vero)|9 hrs|69°C|Eco-conscious + students|Minimal design, solid build, weak speaker|

**What This Actually Means Daily:**

In cafes and classrooms, the HP OmniBook and Acer Aspire 14 AI won. Why? Battery lasts through a full day without anxiety. But if you're gaming or rendering video at home, the ASUS TUF models handle stress better - they just won't fit in your backpack as easily. The Acer Nitro V is where budget meets acceptable thermals, but don't expect sustained frame rates in AAA titles without thermal scaling.

# PROS & CONS

**The Good Stuff:**

The ASUS TUF Gaming A15 genuinely surprised me with how cool it stays during intense gaming. Build quality across all these is solid - no creaky hinges, no mushy keyboards (except the Aspire Vero, which felt a tad soft). The Acer Aspire 14 AI boots insanely fast - I'm talking 12 seconds from cold boot to login. The HP OmniBook's battery is almost unfair; I got through an entire workday at the coffee shop without plugging in once. The Acer Aspire 16 AI has this gorgeous 120Hz WUXGA screen that makes scrolling through Reddit feel buttery smooth.

**What Annoyed Me:**

Fan noise on the ASUS TUF Gaming F16 is *loud* \- it spins up just from opening Spotify. The Acer Nitro V's thermal management struggles when you push it; after 30 minutes of gaming, temps climbed to 85°C and performance dipped noticeably. The ASUS Vivobook Go 15.6 drains battery fast the moment you open any Adobe app - went from 9 hours claimed to about 5 real hours with heavy use. HP 17's screen isn't the brightest; I had to crank it in sunlight. The Acer Aspire Vero feels too minimalist - weak speakers, small trackpad. Still usable, just not premium feeling.

# SOURCES & LINK SECTION (Transparent Proof)

**Where I Verified This Data:**

* r/Laptops Black Friday thread - saw real user complaints about Nitro V thermals, validated by my testing
* r/GamingLaptops discussion on TUF Gaming F16 - users mentioned fan noise, confirmed on day 2 of testing
* PCMag battery benchmark methodology - cross-referenced my battery times against their standards
* Tom's Hardware review of Intel Core Ultra 7 (in Aspire 14 AI) - they claimed surprising gaming performance, I validated with CapCut testing

**Real Takeaway from Research:**

That Reddit thread about Aspire models overheating? Outdated - the 2025 refresh has better thermal paste. Tom's Hardware praised the Core Ultra 7 for content creation at this price point, and honestly, my CapCut testing confirmed it. PCMag's battery standards are stricter than real-world use (constant 40% brightness, lightweight tasks), so when I hit 11 hours on the HP OmniBook, that's genuinely impressive by any standard.

Some links above are affiliate links that help fund my laptop testing addiction. I bought these myself and tested them independently - no brand sent me anything.

# WHO IT'S FOR 

**Students?** The Acer Aspire 14 AI or HP OmniBook 5 are your sweet spot. Light enough to carry between classes, battery lasts all day, handles Zoom + Netflix + light editing. Price is right for that Black Friday dip.

**Gamers?** ASUS TUF Gaming A15 or F16 if you have desk space. Performance is solid, thermals manageable if you're not playing in a sauna. Acer Nitro V works if budget is tight, but manage expectations on sustained gameplay.

**Remote Workers/Travelers?** HP OmniBook or ASUS Vivobook Go. Battery is the priority, and both deliver. You don't need gaming power; you need reliability and portability.

**Content Creators?** Acer Aspire 14 AI or 16 AI. That AI Copilot+ designation isn't just marketing - the hardware actually speeds up video rendering noticeably compared to older chips.

**Eco-Conscious?** Acer Aspire Vero. It's built from recycled materials, and honestly, it's still a capable laptop.

# FAQS (Real Questions I Got Asked)

**Q: Does the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 actually stay cool, or is that just marketing?**  
A: ""Tested it gaming for 40+ minutes - stayed at 72°C. That's genuinely cool for a gaming laptop. Thermal paste quality matters, and ASUS nailed it here.""

**Q: Can the HP OmniBook really last 11 hours?**  
A: ""In my testing, yes. Zoom calls, browsing, light docs work. If you're video editing, realistically 6-7 hours. Snapdragon X Plus is efficient, but heavy apps drain it.""

**Q: Is the Acer Aspire 14 AI worth the extra $100 over the Vivobook?**  
A: ""Yes, if you edit video or use Adobe apps. The Core Ultra 7 + ARC is noticeably faster. If you just browse and stream, the Vivobook is fine.""

**Q: Which laptop has the best keyboard?**  
A: ""ASUS TUF Gaming A15, hands down. Crisp feedback, good travel. Aspire Vero is mushy; avoid if you type a lot.""

**Q: How's the screen quality on the Acer Aspire 16 AI?**  
A: ""120Hz WUXGA is smooth and bright indoors. Not as vivid as OLED, but for the price, it's excellent. HP OmniBook has OLED but smaller screen.""

So yeah, after burning through a week testing 10 laptops, the winner depends on what you actually *do*. Gamers? ASUS TUF Gaming A15. Students? Acer Aspire 14 AI. Battery junkies? HP OmniBook. I'll update this as Black Friday pricing shifts and I test the 2025 refresh models that just dropped. If you've used any of these, drop your experience in the comments - honestly helps others stop guessing. Also, let me know which laptop category you want me to deep-dive next.

October 15th I had a colonoscopy and they took a pregnancy test but I overheard nurses talking about possibly making a mistake with the urine sample. They never told me it was negative, I was just wheeled back and assumed it must have been. 

November 6th I had very dark blood, almost like coffee grounds. November 8th I started heavily bleeding bright red and passing golfball sized clots 2-4x daily. Sometimes I had to sit on the toilet and strain to pass them and they didn’t break up much when I flushed like clots normally do. It was more like stringy tissue. 

The bleeding finally slowed on November 16th and I took a pregnancy test (negative) but began passing beige-yellow slime that smells HORRENDOUS. My boyfriend walked past the bathroom and gagged. I’ve had a mild fever off and on since all of this began, cramping, my lower abdomen is so swollen I had to buy new sweatpants, loss of appetite, nausea, off and on diarrhea, burning when peeing.

I went to the ER yesterday and they found nothing in my blood work, ultrasound, or vaginal exam. The only thing of note was that I might have PCOS and they were able to see the yellow discharge I was talking about. I have endometriosis but this has been unlike anything I’ve ever experienced before. I don’t have an OBGYN right now (my last one was so traumatizing I haven’t tried to find a new one) and I don’t know what to do. I thought I also might have had a miscarriage in January (missed period then sudden stabbing pain followed by gushes of clear to gray fluid and chunks of tissue, heavy bleeding, very large clots) but this has lasted longer and wasn’t initially coupled with that sharp stabbing pain. 

Was it a miscarriage? Is this just the end process of it? What should I do?",0,1763665770.0,Miscarriage,2,0.5,False

If you are a fiction writer (wannabe, published, or otherwise) just us at Parlor Coffee House for a writing meeting. 

**Basic Meeting Information:** 

We will be meeting \*every two weeks\*, as of right now. Our current location is Parlor Coffee House: 600 E Ohio Street, Suite B, Indianapolis, IN 46202, on Wednesday evenings at 6. You are welcome to get there a little early, if you are able, I will be there at 5:45 or so, typically. 

Our meetings should conclude around 7pm (as this is also the time that Parlor switches over to ""Laptop Free""). You are more than welcome, though, to stay and continue to exchange ideas and feedback. 

You are welcome to invite your fellow fiction writer friends, please note that for the critique portion of our meetings, they will need access to the google document where submissions are stored for review and feedback. -- to learn more about this please DM your email. 

To streamline this access and protect the content of the document, please have them send me a request, rather than adding them on your own. 

Our **tentative agenda** for the upcoming meeting is as follows: 

December 3rd @ 6pm Agenda: 

Introductions + Discussion of process (any current hiccups, questions, or general ideas from the previous weeks) - Purpose = to get to know one another a bit better & gain education on the craft :) 

Generative Exercise - Purpose = to get those imagination stations up and running & break the ice. (5 Minute exercise with a sharing circle for another 15-20 minutes. You are welcome to use pen & paper or your laptop). I will provide the exercise but writers are welcome to send suggestions through email ahead of time if they come across something they would like to do! 

Submission Review & Critique - Purpose = accountability, due date, personal growth as writers & editors. (This aspect of the meeting will require some pre-meeting work). 

Conclusion :) 7pm - free to stay and continue talking, but the agenda will end here. ",4,1763665769.0,indianapolis,0,1.0,False
1p2c0ep,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeFlow/comments/1p2c0ep/10_essay_hacks_every_student_should_know/,10 Essay Hacks Every Student Should Know,"# Hack 1: Start with a Skeleton

Before you write a single sentence, build a rough outline. This “skeleton” gives your essay structure from the start, which you can later flesh out. This helps you:

* Beat the blank page
* Stay focused
* Avoid going off track

Here’s an example of how you can break it down, but, of course, tailor it to the type of essay that you’re writing:

* **Intro:** What’s the topic? What will you argue? What do you hypothesise? 
* **Body Paragraphs**: Outline the topic of each paragraph with a single word or subline to summarise. 
* **Conclusion**: Compile and restate your main message.

This structure is gold when figuring out how to write a university essay, and it can save hours of editing later down the line. 

 

# Hack 2: Use the Pomodoro Technique 

If you’ve ever lost 45 minutes to TikTok while “thinking about your essay,” this one’s for you. The Pomodoro Technique is all about focused bursts:

1. Work for 25 minutes
2. Take a 5-minute break
3. Repeat x4, then take a longer 15–20-minute break

This method boosts essay writing productivity without frying your brain. Use free apps like Focus Keeper or Forest to keep track.

 

# Hack 3: Curate Your Sources Early

Before you start writing, create a mini library of quotes, references, and articles (your future self will thank you). This will inspire your thoughts early on, so you have a good idea of how to flesh out your skeleton before you begin formally writing your essay. Try using Google Scholar, your university library database, or bookmarking tools, such as Pocket and Notion, to collate this research.

 

# Hack 4: Write the Body First, Then the Intro

Next up on our list of essay writing tips is how to approach the essay itself. The introduction is often the hardest bit to write, so don’t start there! Get stuck into your body paragraphs first. Once your arguments are fleshed out, it’s way easier to go back and write a strong, relevant intro. It’s a game-changing hack for any student wondering how to write a university essay without spiralling into perfectionism, and ultimately overcomplicating one of the most crucial components of an essay.

 

# Hack 5: Make Use of Your Environment 

Where you study makes a massive difference. Not just to your grades, but to your mental wellbeing, too. That’s why we strongly advise you *not* to write your essay in bed. It’s critical to separate your studies from where you sleep, or else you’ll be in constant work mode, even when you’re trying to catch some Z’s. 

Your space should work for you. Whether you’re smashing out citations or editing the final draft, a good setup boosts concentration and motivation. At aparto, you’ve got everything you need to get into the zone, including:

* **Spacious desks** in your room
* **Quiet study areas** for deep focus
* **Communal spaces** for when you need a study buddy or group session

# Hack 6: Free Writing and Editing Tools

Grammarly and Google Docs are the dream team when it comes to essay writing, and they both offer free versions, too!

Grammarly is great for spotting grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, while Google Docs tracks changes, simplifies group work, and autosaves everything. Gone are the days of worrying whether or not you clicked the save button before shutting down your computer.

 

# Hack 7: Talk It Out 

Explaining your essay topic out loud, whether it’s to a friend, flatmate, or even your cat, is a brilliant way to test your understanding. If you can explain it simply, you know it well, and talking it through helps spot gaps or contradictions.

Living somewhere like aparto means you’re always surrounded by people who get it. So grab a coffee and bounce ideas around in the social lounge. Study chats don’t have to be boring!



 

# Hack 8: Create a Style Template 

Every course has its preferred referencing style: Harvard, APA, MLA... the list goes on. One of the smartest student essay tips out there is to create a reusable document that includes: 

* Your preferred font and size
* Correct spacing and margins
* A reference list in your required style

Use this as a template for future essays and never start formatting from scratch again, saving you a tonne of time and stress.

 

# Hack 9: Schedule Your Finish One Day Early

Trust us (and every university student ever); last-minute edits at 2 am are not the vibe. Plan to finish your essay at least one day before the deadline. That way, you can:

* Proofread with fresh eyes
* Catch silly mistakes
* Avoid tech disasters on submission day

Even a quick overnight break from your essay can make a massive difference in spotting areas to improve. This is one of those essay-writing hacks that sounds simple, but it’s surprisingly powerful.

 

# Hack 10: Reward Yourself

You made it. You wrote the essay. Now it’s time to celebrate!

Rewards are a great way to motivate yourself to complete future essays. So, whether you enjoy a night in with Netflix and a takeaway, hit the clubs guilt-free knowing you have no other responsibilities, or vibe with aparto’s social events, do what you need to do to switch off. You deserve it. 

 

So now you know the best study tips to complete your essay, it’s time to get your head down and focus.

Whether you're writing in your room or powering through in a quiet study space, your environment makes a big difference. At aparto, we’ve created spaces that help students focus, write, and succeed. From cosy study nooks to social zones where you can bounce ideas around, we’ve got your back for every stage of uni life, not just the fun bits.

There is a Denny's nearby and I occasionally like to go there for dinner while I study, especially since I am broke and they have good money-saver deals. 

About a month ago, I went late one night and was sitting at the counter, where a large pass-through allows you to see directly into the kitchen. The fry cook working (Id say about my age?) then looks up at me right as I happened to be looking at him, and gasps an ""oh my gosh, you're so beautiful!"" He then leaves the fry station, comes over to where I'm sitting, and starts asking me about myself and then tells me his name, that he is from Pakistan, and that he's working on his master's in engineering (at the same university I go to). He then asks me for my Instagram, but I said I didn't feel comfortable giving it since I didn't know him. He said that was fine and that he hoped we could get coffee soon. 

Two weeks later, it is a Saturday and I was there getting breakfast. This time, however, I sat at a table as I could see him working the fry station again. As I'm eating, he sees me, comes over to my table and leans over it, and continuously asks me all these questions about how I'm doing, what I'm studying, and how soon I can go out with him. I gave him repeated vague answers, and tried to give him the hint that I was not interested by repeatedly going back to reading my book. He eventually left and went back to the kitchen. 

Last night, I sat at a different table and thought he wasn't working, so I breathed a sigh of relief. My waitress comes to take my order, and everything goes smoothly. About 20 minutes later, here comes Mr. desperate fry cook with a gaping smile on his face as he places my food on my table, with a ""please let me know if there is anything else you need."" I looked around for my waitress and I could see here watching and smiling before returning to the front. 

I was super fed up, so I went to the front and asked to speak to the manager. The hostess said he wasn't in tonight, so I asked for his phone number. I tried calling a couple of times throughout the day the following day, but he never answered even after I left messages. 

I then looked up the phone number for corporate and called them to file a complaint. When I got someone on the line, I explained that the fry cook at my specific establishment was repeatedly stepping away from his work duties and harassing me, and that the rest of the staff (I gave their names, in addition to fry cook's) were aware yet standing by and letting it happen by not intervening. The agent apologized and said he would contact the manager asap. The manager later calls me and apologizes, saying he will fix this. 

I returned for another meal a few weeks later (manager promised me a freebee as an apology), and noticed the three staff including Mr. Fry Cook weren't there. It turns out, fry cook was fired and the other two were re-assigned, but WITA for even escalating this? ",18,1763665706.0,AmItheAsshole,70,0.74,False

1p2brc2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p2brc2,"[Feedback] MacroLoop – AI food tracking app built with Expo, focused on stupidly fast logging","Hey everyone 👋

I’ve spent the last three months building my first proper personal side project with Expo, and I just released it on iOS: MacroLoop.

I work with React Native in my 9 to 5, so Expo felt like the natural choice for something I wanted to iterate on quickly. And yeah, it’s “another AI food tracker”, but it really started because I got annoyed at the existing ones my colleagues and friends use: super bloated, long onboardings, constant popups, recipes, communities, badges, random UX noise. Pretty much the opposite of quick.

I wanted something for people like me: intermediate gym folks who already know what they’re doing and don’t need a coach. Just a sharp tool that makes logging stupidly fast so consistency beats perfection. If tracking is annoying, I know I won’t stick with it.

So I built MacroLoop around that idea:

* AI logging via photo, short text or voice
* Automatic ingredient breakdown you can edit, with macros instantly recalculated
* Quick portion slider
* Favorites for repeat stuff like protein shakes, coffee, veggies
* No bloat, no social feed, no gamification. Just tracking.

I tried to make it feel really polished and a bit “Apple-ish” (the UI is loosely inspired by Apple Fitness). It’s iOS-only for now, Android maybe later once I’ve recovered from this sprint 😅

There’s a 7 day free trial. You can cancel straight away if it’s not for you, no hard feelings. I’d love any feedback, especially from other Expo devs. I put a lot of energy into making it feel smooth and pleasant to use and I hope that comes through.

If you do try it, I’m curious what you think.

If you have worked in cybersecurity for any length of time, you already know the rhythm. Everything looks calm for a moment, and you allow yourself to relax. Then, a Linux server suddenly forgets how to authenticate, Windows deploys an update at the most inconvenient second, and someone clicks an email promising an Olive Garden gift card. It is a profession defined by timing, unpredictability, and an endless supply of surprises.

As I reflected on the state of cybersecurity this week, I realized how much has changed and how much has stayed exactly the same. We now have AI-assisted threat detection, automated compliance tools, and cloud platforms that claim to make security effortless. Anyone in the field knows that “effortless” usually means “simple until the moment you try to secure it in real life.”

**Cloud infrastructure still needs real humans**  
Cloud services offer every tool you could possibly need, but the shared responsibility model is often misunderstood. People tend to treat it like a friendly guideline rather than a rule. This is how you end up explaining that storing production credentials in a public bucket is not efficient, it is dangerous. Cloud platforms scale beautifully, but misconfigurations remain timeless.

**Zero Trust works well, at least until convenience enters the conversation**  
Zero Trust is the cybersecurity equivalent of healthy living. Everyone agrees it is beneficial, but nobody wants to give up comfort. Executives approve of the philosophy, but users begin a full rebellion when they discover they need to log in again because the system was not entirely convinced of their identity.

Zero Trust absolutely works when implemented properly. The challenge is ensuring people are equally committed to security and convenience, which is rarely the case.

**Logs continue to multiply as fast as threats**  
There is no world in which a SIEM sits quietly. If alerts were pizza boxes, most SOC environments would qualify as small warehouses. Buried inside that mountain of noise, however, are the real dangers. A login from an unusual location, a script nobody owns, or a process spawning suspicious child processes. These findings keep the job interesting and keep the vendors well funded.

**Technology evolves, but human nature stays exactly the same**  
The most fascinating part of cybersecurity is not the hardware or the software. It is the people who use them. The tools improve each year, yet our core challenges remain. Passwords are still reused. Developers still say “it works on my machine.” Leadership still imagines that cyber incidents only happen to someone else.

So we continue teaching, improving, refining, and building. A large part of the role is helping people use technology without feeling overwhelmed or trapped by it. The rest is preparation and vigilance.

**Where the field is heading**  
Despite the chaos, the false positives, the unpredictable updates, and the occasional resistance to security controls, I am more optimistic than ever about cybersecurity. We are building smarter and more resilient systems each year. Automation is improving response times, analytics are becoming sharper, and infrastructure is beginning to anticipate threats instead of simply reacting to them.

We are making organizations safer in real, measurable ways. Even if much of the success happens quietly in the background.

So here is to the cybersecurity professionals working through the long nights, documenting everything, patching systems, correcting misconfigurations, and preventing incidents the world will never know about. The work matters, even when it goes unnoticed.

Now go refill your coffee. You deserve it.

At BetMGM, Barcelona’s odds of **1.43** imply a **69.9% chance to win**, while Chelsea’s **+480** (4.8) translates to a meager **20.8% chance**. Even DraftKings, the bookie with the most confidence in its own numbers, gives Barcelona a **1.39 line**—suggesting they’re more reliable than your morning coffee. The draw? A paltry **17.4%** implied probability. If this were a Netflix series, it’d be called *Barcelona: The Sequel to Perfection*.

For context, Chelsea’s recent 6-0 thrashing of St. Pölten proves they can score goals faster than a toddler at a candy store. But Barcelona? They’ve dispatched Bayern Munich **7-1** and OH Leuven **3-0**, leading the group with 9 points. Their attack is a goal-fueled jet engine, and their defense? Well, let’s just say Chelsea’s backline will need to invent a new ZIP code for “tightly organized.”

### Digesting the News: Injuries, History, and Circuses

Barcelona’s squad is a who’s who of talent, featuring the likes of Fridolina Röllo (a Swedish striker who could outscore a video game) and Ellie Roebuck in goal—a keeper so calm under pressure, she once caught a falling elephant… in a *circus*, obviously. (Okay, that part’s fictional,

Long time writer but newly wanting to become an author. I'm not trying to self promote as much as self develop. I was wondering if anyone here did mentorship with unpublished authors to help them structure their process before submitting to a publisher.

My main focus is a high fantasy trilogy I've been mulling over for about 3 years and finally decided to start.

Please DM me if you're interested in chatting about mentorship to see if we're a good fit.

TIA!

[[EDIT]]
I think there's some confusion here because of the number of people thinking I'm asking for free labor.

I'm not an asshole, I'd pay for mentorship.

I think it depends on if we're doing digital coffee chats where you tell me about learned experience or if you're reading and providing feedback. 

I don't want free work. I've done a lot of reading about the publishing aspect of things but I'd like to talk to a professional who's been through this process and just ask them some questions.

I mostly need help on organizing the writing process. 

Most of what I'm finding online seems to be for very type A organized individuals, which I ABSOLUTELY am not. I'm more like a type C.5 or something and tend to stare at things because I have no idea how to start.",0,1763664838.0,writing,27,0.46,False

1p2bjvs,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1p2bjvs/officially_down_50lbs_as_of_this_morning_started/,"Officially down 50lbs as of this morning.  Started seriously losing weight in April.  Ask me anything!  57M, 221 -> 171 lbs.","# I am officially 50 lbs lighter than when I started this journey as of this morning.  



Feels amazing to hit that milestone.  2 more minor ""stretch goal"" milestones to go.  (breaking the 170 barrier and hitting 164.9, which puts me in the ""healthy"" BMI category for the first time since high school)

A little background, I had shoulder surgery in November last year and the 6 weeks of enforced sedentary lifestyle that demanded caused my weight to spike from where it usually hovered at 208-210 or so, up to 221 lbs.  I knew then I needed to get a bit more serious about losing some weight.  I wasn't fully comitted yet though.  I lost a few pounds here and there, got down to my original weight of 205ish and stayed there for a while.  

Then in April I had what my doc is calling a *""cardiac event""*.  He won't call it a heart attack, but I'm pretty sure that's what had occurred.  I ended up with a 45mm ascending aortic aneurysm.  (I had to look that up too).  OK, that's a wake up call, time to get SERIOUS.

Doc put me on some blood pressure and cholesterol meds, and I started researching the best way to get healthier.  I was also getting married on August 2nd and wanted to look better for that day.  **Cue the solution: brutally honest CICO.**

With my Garmin S62 golf watch and the Garmin connect app, I started tracking all of my outgoing calories.  My basal metabolic rate (BMR) at this point was right aroud 2100 calories per day.  I set my goal for daily intake to between 1300 and 1600, and set my macros for 30% carbs, 30% fats and 40% proteins.  

I tracked all of my food in the My Fitness Pal app.  (just the free version, it did what I needed just fine)  No endorsements here, just letting you know what worked for me. 

It took a couple of weeks to find meals that I liked that would fit those targets and keep me full.  Here is what worked: 

Breakfast: Coffee (cream and sweetener) and 2 boiled eggs.  Boring, but filling and I still got the caffeine I needed to not kill people in the morning.

Lunch: 0% greek yogurt (whatever brand was on sale this week), 1 scoop of protein powder (Meijers if you are in the US, I bought some Schinoussa in Canada as well at Homesense of all places), 3 teaspoons of chia seeds, 1/4 cup of quick oats, topped with berries.  Frozen berries work too.  I can switch up flavours of protein powder to mix it up a bit, but yeah, pretty much the same thing for lunch every day.  I call it drywall mud.  That's what it looks like.  But it keeps me full until supper time most days.  

Supper: Usually some kind of lower fat protein (chicken, pork, steak) veggies and if I need the extra filler, sweet potatoes.  I also bought a kick-ass steamer to do some different kinds of fish and veggies too.  

Snacks:  Apples.  Soooooo many apples.  Usually 2 a day.  All different kinds, but honeycrisp is by far my favourite.  Turkey pepperettes.

The key here is to be brutally honest with yourself.  **LOG EVERYTHING!!**  Especially in the beginning.  Weigh your foods if you are unsure.  Cheap amazon kitchen scales work just fine. Sauces, butter, ketchup, you name it.  If it goes in your body, log it.  You are only cheating yourself by not logging it.  

The other major change was walking.  10k steps per day minimum, rain or shine.  My dog is traumatized from all the walking.  Golfing?  Walk if you can, if you have to ride, walk from tee to your ball while your playing partner drives.  As much as you can. 

Was it easy?  Hell no.  Especially in the beginning.  I was hungry all the F&%$ing time.  Hangry.  Short with my fam.  I found keeping busy was the key to making it to that next meal without raiding the pantry for chips or crackers or other calorie dense food.

Ginger Ale Zero helped with the sugar cravings.  Soda water helped with the beer cravings.  Oh, beer.  I was a connoisseur.  Double hopped IPA's, Irish Red Ales, you name it, I love craft beer.  My deal with myself was this:  Sunday to Friday, I eat clean, hit my macros, no beer.  Saturdays I do what I want.  

What I found was after a while I didn't want that ""checkmark"" on my Monday morning weigh in.  So I moderated even when I was eating and drinking on Saturdays.  

Anyway, thanks for reading my short weight-loss novella.  If you have any questions at all, fire away.  I will answer as many as I can.

1p2bi2i,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1p2bi2i/a_colombians_perspective_of_vietnam/,a Colombian’s perspective of Vietnam,"I’m Colombian born and raised, and have a big interest in Vietnam because of some parallels in our culture. After visiting for first time and exploring the country from South to North, these are my takeaways. 

It’s extremely heartwarming to see the resilience in Vietnamese people despite civil war (I consider the North/South divide a civil war, despite them having been recognized as separate nations at one point), history of colonization, and the brutality that the people have been subjected to by foreign powers. The people here have rebuilt their country from the ground up, protected historical gems that were on the brink of destruction, and preserved an optimistic spirit that seems unbreakable. 

By contrast, my Colombia is still stuck in an endless civil war, we’re killing each other, armed insurgent guerrillas continue to battle for political purposes but also terrorizing their own nation. It feels like the message has been lost. There is no rhyme or reason to it. Not the same way that Vietnam was united to fight for liberation from foreign invasion. Although Colombian guerrillas began fighting for that same purpose, a leftist struggle to fight back oppression from the right, the continuation of a conflict for 60+ years has diluted the revolutionary message. It’s now become a narco-trafficking terrorist organization masked as freedom fighters. The people killing each other. Resentment and annihilation among ourselves, with no foreign invader. I hope one day we can be united the same way Vietnam was able to come together. We lack leaders like Ho Chi Minh, whatever your opinion of him might be. 

Although I can’t understand the language and can’t truly know what the people think about me and other foreigners, everyone was extremely kind, welcoming, opened their doors, and generally I felt very safe. 

Vietnam hustle culture is also very impressive and inspiring. The people here work hard, they grind from ungodly early morning hours, no matter if it’s to farm, run their shop, or make Banh Mi, Banh Xeo, Bun Cha, Com Hen, or whatever regional dish they eat for breakfast. Whether it’s a restaurant or a food cart. Or whether it’s selling trinkets or giving Grab rides. I feel like I was always awed by the work ethic of the people. 

Vietnamese people are honorable and honest. Although things like price gouging obviously happen, I felt like many more times they honored the price given to locals. I never felt swindled. Even drivers who hustle to try to be your private driver, they always were transparent about their prices and often charged only what Grab advertised for the same ride. Many times waiting for me for hours between locations. I tipped well when I could. 

It makes me hopeful that one day my country can emulate some of these things. We have a similar family-run-small-business culture, with a hustling working class who come from humble means. But Colombia is riddled with dishonesty, crime, lack of morality and virtues. I love my country, but it sucks how unsafe it feels at times. It’s not the drug war. It’s the people themselves who are the biggest threat. You don’t know when you are approached who wants to do you harm sometimes. So the Colombian people become skeptical and avoidant. I never felt this way in Vietnam, and I envy that and hope one day Colombia can be the same way. 

Our coffee culture is very similar too. Colombians are often recognized globally for our coffee, but Vietnam is much more inventive and experimental with it. They have come up with some incredible variations. Ca Phe Sua (condensed milk), Muoi (salt), Dua (coconut), Trung (egg), and a few others I’m forgetting. To me these are on the same level as Italians taking eggs and making carbonara. It’s so creative and out of the box. I was always amazed at how good it tasted, because hearing about it I was quite skeptical. The umami flavor of these drinks is such a playful balance of salt, sweet, bitter. 

The same goes for their food. Vietnamese cuisine is ancient. The age of this country blows my mind. It’s so hard to grasp. Although I live in America which is quite young and lacks the depth of history, Colombia also doesn’t have nearly the same depth either. But we do have a more established and authentic cuisine. However, our flavors do not compare. It’s all about the umami, the mix of salt, citric, bitter, spicy. The use of fermentation to create complex dipping sauces (nuoc cham) that give depth of flavor. It feels like the Vietnamese palate is as deep and complex as its history. 

I can keep going but this post is already too long. As my time to go back home approaches, just want to say thank you to Vietnam and the people of this country, for opening your doors and welcoming me and so many others to experience your beautiful country!

I just want to know if this sounds like something a person’s brain can go through and still work afterward.

I already did the boring rational checklist.
Gas leak. Mold. Not enough sleep. Too much stress. Memory screw-ups. I actually wrote them all out in a notes app and tried to make each one fit.

None of them explain what I remember. None of them explain what’s missing now.

I remember what I saw. I remember what I heard. And I remember a person who was right next to me for hours.

You can say I’m misreading it. Fine.

Just don’t tell me it was all in my head.

⸻

It started with a screenshot.

My friend Liam dropped it in our group chat around two in the morning. It was low-res, all blocky pixels. Concrete hallway. Green paint on the walls. Doors down both sides. The doors didn’t have handles. Above each one, there was a black number stenciled onto the wall.

Under the screenshot, someone had written:

“South annex, Building D. Stairs go down three more floors than the blueprints say. Do NOT go past the second landing. You’ll know why.”

The username in the screenshot was blurred out. The image came from some dead urbex forum. When I tried to find the original thread, every link I clicked led to a broken archive page or a scraped copy missing half the posts. I never found where that caption was first posted.

This is exactly Liam’s thing.

He spends weekends in abandoned hospitals and parking structures and service tunnels. If a place is empty, off-limits, and smells old, he wants to walk around in it. I’m usually the one warning him about trespassing and rotten floors and security cameras.

That night, I didn’t say no.

I told myself it was because the place was close. About a forty-five minute drive from town, just off the highway, near an industrial park that never filled properly. Most of the buildings out there turned into storage or stayed “For Lease” until the banners faded.

Liam did his usual digging beforehand.

“Used to be a research lab,” he said in the car. He was in the passenger seat scrolling, I was driving. “Spin-off from a defense contractor. Closed sometime in the eighties. Official paperwork says ‘materials testing.’ Old posts say ‘human factors.’ Sleep trials, sensory stuff, that kind of thing.”

I kept my attention on the road. “Old posts where?”

“Forum nobody moderates anymore,” he said. “Half the threads are bots. Screenshots look like they were taken on a potato. That’s how you know it’s good.”

He sounded relaxed. Too relaxed, honestly.

The sky was just a flat gray slab that day. When we pulled into the industrial park, the whole place felt wrong in a way I didn’t have a neat word for. Big rectangles of concrete and brick, too many parking spaces, not enough people or vehicles. It looked like the tail end of a half-built future.

Building D didn’t have a nameplate.

Just a two-story brick block with dark windows and a sagging chain-link fence around the front. A rusted padlock hung on the gate. The link right next to it had been cut, and somebody had looped the loose chain back through the lock so it looked sealed at a glance.

Liam saw that and smiled. When he looked over and saw my face, the smile faded a little.

“We can still bail,” he said. “Walk the outside, peek in, get food. No big deal.”

“Let’s at least see the first floor,” I heard myself say.

That answer didn’t match how I actually felt.

Inside, the air felt dead. No draft, no movement. Dust lay on every surface. The lobby looked like generic late-70s office space: square tan tiles, glass doors in metal frames, a long front desk with an old CRT monitor sitting dark on top.

There was a black spray-painted smiley face on one wall. Nothing else. No tags.

We went through a door behind the front desk and stepped into a corridor. Most of the rooms off it had been stripped. Ceiling grids open, tiles missing, wires hanging down. The carpet was stained in big irregular patches. A couple of those stains still had darker edges that looked too fresh for a place that had been empty for decades.

“Do you smell that?” Liam asked.

Under the dust, there was a sharp metallic scent and something chemical that didn’t match mildew or old building smell.

“This is probably where they did the tests,” he said, leaning into a room that had a one-way mirror built into the far wall. “Observers on one side, subjects on the other.”

“Great,” I said. “So, south annex?”

He checked his phone again. “If the blueprint I found is right, the annex should be that way.” He pointed deeper into the building.

We kept going.

Some of the doors had room numbers stenciled above the frame. 112. 114. 116. Then a jump to 120. Then 126. Then one door with no number at all. The next one after that had 118, which didn’t line up with the sequence at all.

I decided they must’ve remodeled the floor at some point and changed the layout without updating everything.

At the end of the corridor was a plain metal door with an EXIT sign above it. The plastic on the sign was faded. The light inside it was off.

Liam pushed the door open.

The hallway from the screenshot was on the other side.

Concrete floor with a narrow strip of worn material down the center. Green painted walls. Doors on both sides spaced exactly the same distance apart. Above each door, a black number.

All of them were 0.

First door: 0.

Second door: 0.

Third door: 0.

Our footsteps landed on the floor and stopped. No echo.

“This is it,” I said.

Liam stepped up close to one of the zeros. “They painted over the real numbers,” he said. “Look close.”

He was right. Up close, you could see faint outlines under the zeros. Shapes like 101, 103, 105, just a little off-center. The new black 0s sat on top of them.

At the far end of the hallway, another EXIT sign glowed red.

“There’s no power in this building,” I said. “We didn’t see any other lights on.”

“Emergency line,” he said. “Separate wiring. Or some old battery that should’ve been dead years ago and isn’t.”

His voice didn’t carry the way it should have. It seemed to just stop a few feet away.

Halfway down the hall, I noticed I was breathing harder. The air felt heavier in my chest. Not warmer. Just dense.

We stopped at one of the doors with a 0 above it.

No handle, no lock, no hinges on our side. Just a door with a narrow vertical slot at eye level.

Liam bent forward to look through the slot.

“Don’t,” I said.

He stayed there. “It’s just black,” he said. “Can’t see anything.”

He turned on his phone flashlight and angled the beam at the slot.

The light hit the opening and didn’t go anywhere beyond it. No reflection, no faint surface, nothing. Just the beam cutting off.

Liam’s face tightened. “Yeah, that’s not how this should work,” he muttered.

A sound came from further down the hall.

Something dragging. Dry. Slow.

We both froze.

“Probably a raccoon,” he said. It didn’t sound like he believed it.

The sound came again.

Same volume, same distance. There was no echo, no way to tell direction. The hallway might as well have absorbed it in place.

“Let’s just find the stairs,” I said. “We see them, then we leave. That’s it.”

He hesitated, then nodded once. “Okay. Stairs, then gone.”

We moved on.

The EXIT sign at the end of the hallway didn’t seem to get closer. My body said we were walking. My eyes said we were staying in the same spot. I checked my watch. We walked for about a minute and the sign looked exactly the same.

“Wait,” I said. “This—”

The EXIT sign flicked off.

When it came back on, it was right above the door in front of us.

We hadn’t crossed that distance.

Liam let out a short, shaky laugh. “All right,” he said. “That’s… something. Old construction messing with perspective.”

That dragging noise came again. One drawn-out pull and then a single, clear tap on the floor.

“I’m done,” I said. “Stairs, then out. I mean it this time.”

He opened the door.

The stairwell looked ordinary at first glance.

Square landings, concrete steps, metal railings. Black stenciled numbers on the walls at each landing.

The level we were on had a 1.

One flight down was marked 0.

Another flight down was marked -1.

The first -1 we saw had a line scratched through it, like someone had dug a key or a nail across it.

There were no stairs going higher than 1. No roof door.

“You read the caption,” Liam said. “Stairs go lower than they should. Don’t go past the second landing. That’s the warning.”

He put his hand on the rail.

“Second landing and we’re out,” he said. “For real. I just want to see how far it goes.”

“You always say that,” I said.

“Yeah, and sometimes I mean it,” he said.

We started down.

The air grew colder with each flight. By the time we reached the landing with 0, my fingers were numb on the rail. There was a door there. Metal, blank, no window.

“Leave it alone,” I said.

He did, which surprised me.

“One more,” he said. “We hit -1, confirm the pattern, then we’re done.”

The next landing down had -1 on the wall again. This stencil didn’t have a scratch through it. The door here had a black 0 above it, just like the hallway doors.

“We saw it,” I said. “That’s the second landing. Your little rule is met. Time to go back up.”

The stairwell lights shut off.

It wasn’t dramatic. No popping glass. Just a tiny electrical noise and then only our flashlights.

His phone beam and my headlamp made two small islands of light. Beyond those, nothing.

“Tell me that was a timer,” I said. “Please say there’s some stupid motion sensor.”

“That wasn’t me,” he said, and I believed him.

Something moved below us.

Not footsteps. Not any animal noise I recognized. It was a slow, steady shift, like a heavy coil of something being rearranged.

Liam aimed his light downward.

We didn’t see the familiar pattern of stairs fading into a darker distance. The light hit a gray space that refused to show depth or shape.

My eyes started to sting again.

“We’re going now,” I said. “Up.”

He nodded.

We climbed.

We went up one full flight.

The landing number said -1.

He stopped.

“No,” he said. “That’s not right.”

“We started at 1,” I said. “Then 0. Then -1. We came down to this one. We just went up one. This should be 0. It’s not.”

As we looked at it, the number changed.

The paint didn’t smear. The wall didn’t shift. It was the same marks. My brain just suddenly read them as -1 again instead of 0. No transition. Just a new fact.

Liam’s breathing went uneven. “We misread it before,” he said quickly. “It’s fine. We’re just panicking. That’s all.”

He climbed three more steps.

There was no landing up there.

The stairs continued in the same downward direction in front of him. When he turned and looked behind, those also went down. The landing we thought we were leaving didn’t exist on either side.

He stared at me.

“Stop moving,” I said. “Stay right where you are.”

We stood in that same section of stairwell for several seconds.

A new sound started.

Short, hard taps. Not random. In groups. Tap tap tap. Pause. Tap. Longer pause. Tap tap.

It took me a few cycles to notice it matched my breathing.

Every time I inhaled, there was a quick cluster. When I held my breath, it stopped. When I exhaled, it picked back up a moment later.

“Do you hear that?” I asked.

Liam didn’t answer.

He was staring at the wall where the -1 was painted.

New marks had appeared above the number. Thin vertical strokes grouped together. Tallies.

Two groups. A narrow gap under the second group, where one more line could have fit.

He reached out and pressed his fingers against the blank space under that gap.

Gray dust stuck to his skin.

“Stop touching it,” I snapped. “Seriously. Don’t do that.”

“It’s a count,” he said. “There’s one missing.”

He wiped his fingers on his shirt.

The gray didn’t fully rub off. You could still see it on his skin.

I needed something that was ours, something I could verify.

I pulled a black Sharpie out of my pocket. Same one I’d used that morning for paperwork. I went to the nearest clear bit of wall and drew a thick arrow pointing toward the direction I still believed was “up.”

“If we see this again, we’ll know we looped,” I said. “No more guessing. No more trusting our sense of direction. If we pass this arrow twice, we stop and figure it out.”

He gave me a small, tight nod.

We started climbing again.

I kept my hand on the rail the whole time. The tapping kept matching our breathing. It didn’t grow louder or softer, just adjusted as we did.

We passed another landing.

The stencil here read -2.

My thighs burned. My chest hurt. The air stayed thin and cold.

The arrow never reappeared.

After several more flights, my legs started to shake so badly I couldn’t trust my footing.

“I need a second,” I said. “Just one second.”

Liam stopped above me.

The wall at this landing had changed again.

The tallies above the number now had no gap. The missing line was there.

“There,” he said quietly. “Now it’s all there.”

His voice broke on the last word.

“‘All’ what?” I asked.

He looked down at me like he was trying to line up my face with something in his head.

“Ever feel like a place is keeping track of you?” he asked. “Not just visitors. You. Personally.”

I didn’t answer.

The tapping stopped.

Silence in that stairwell wasn’t clean. Under it, a slow, steady rasp came in. It sounded like air being moved through a long, narrow space. It didn’t come from above or below. It came from the walls.

My teeth hurt. My fingers cramped around the rail.

My body moved before I finished thinking about it.

I grabbed his wrist again and ran.

I honestly couldn’t tell you which way we went. Up, down, sideways—none of it meant anything. My feet kept hitting concrete. Landings flashed past. -3. Blank. Another -1. A 0 in the wrong place. Numbers that didn’t connect to each other.

The rasping noise stayed at the same volume the whole time, no matter how fast or slow we moved.

At one landing, my heel sank just enough into the surface to feel it. The concrete gave under my weight briefly and then firmed again. The wall beside us pushed inward once, then relaxed.

“Don’t stop,” I said. “Just keep going.”

We didn’t.

Eventually, a different kind of light showed up above us.

Pale, gray daylight seeped through a doorway at the top of yet another run. Not the harsh stairwell bulbs. Real outside light.

“There,” I said. “That has to be the way out.”

We sprinted.

One last landing with no number. A door hanging open. A short corridor. Broken safety glass in window frames. Grass and cracked asphalt beyond.

We went through and out.

The outside air hit hard. Real wind, real street noise, real world. My knees gave out and I ended up on the pavement, leaning on my hands, breathing like I’d just finished a sprint.

For a while there was only that. Our breathing. Distant cars. Wind.

Then I realized I only heard myself.

I turned.

Liam was still standing in the doorway.

He was halfway in shadow, one hand braced on the frame, the other hanging at his side. His body faced me. His feet were still partly on the indoor flooring.

“Come on,” I said. “We’re out. Get over here.”

He tilted his head a few degrees. Slow. Controlled.

His fingers flexed once and then went still again.

The hair on my arms stood up.

“Liam,” I said.

He stepped out.

His body moved the way a body is supposed to move, but the timing was off. His joints seemed to catch and then continue. No casual shift of weight, no little adjustments you don’t usually notice. Every step was deliberate.

He stopped in front of me.

Up close, his face looked washed out. Pupils wide. His eyes were locked on mine and didn’t flick around to anything else.

Then he smiled.

His smile has always been a little crooked on one side. This one wasn’t. Both corners of his mouth went up the same amount.

I felt my stomach drop.

“You okay?” I asked. The words came out too loud.

He blinked once. The blink lasted a fraction longer than normal.

“We made it out,” he said.

The words were right. The pronunciation was right. The spacing between the words was just slightly wrong, like he was repeating a line he’d practiced.

Behind him, the stairwell door swung toward the frame on its own. It didn’t latch. It just moved until it almost touched and then stopped.

Near the hem of his shirt, I saw a tiny strip of white.

It sat flush under the fabric. Not lint, not dust. A thin band pressed against his skin, the way a hospital wristband hides under a sleeve.

Without thinking, I reached toward it.

He jerked back so fast it didn’t look natural.

“Don’t,” he said.

That single word sounded completely normal.

We stood there, just looking at each other.

“Okay,” I said finally. “I won’t. Let’s just go home.”

On the way back, he didn’t touch his phone. No music, no scrolling, no complaining about my driving. He stared out the passenger window the whole ride.

At one red light, I glanced down at his hands.

The same faint gray dust clung around his fingers. It hadn’t rubbed off.

When we pulled up outside his building, he turned toward me.

“You should delete the photos,” he said.

“We didn’t take any,” I said.

He looked at me for a second, then nodded slowly.

“Right,” he said. “Good.”

He got out and went inside.

I stayed in the car for a while with my hands still on the steering wheel and the engine off, just staring at the windshield. It felt like a scene was missing somewhere between the stairwell and dropping him off.

When I finally went inside my own place, I locked the door, checked the deadbolt twice, then took a shower until the hot water ran out. I still couldn’t shake the feeling of the stairwell air sitting in my lungs.

I didn’t sleep that night.

The second night I lay in bed with the lights on, watching the ceiling.

By the third night, I gave in and tried to call him.

The call didn’t ring. An automated voice said the number wasn’t in service.

I texted him anyway.

The message failed instantly.

I opened our group chat.

All the old messages were still there. The memes, the photos, the plans, everything. At the top, where his name should’ve been, there was just a gray “Unknown.” No profile picture. No contact info.

I checked my phone’s contact list.

There was an entry sitting there with no name and no number. Every time I tried to edit it, the app spun and then flipped me back to the list.

I checked social media.

No profile. No posts. No old photos. Comments people had clearly written to him were still there, but now they looked like one-sided arguments with nobody.

I called our friend Jenna.

“Hey,” I said. “Stupid question. When’s the last time you talked to Liam?”

“Who?” she asked.

“Liam,” I said. “Tall, dark hair. He came with us to that flea market in July. You bought that ugly lamp? He kept roasting you for it.”

“I went with you,” she said slowly. “There wasn’t a third person.”

I hung up.

I know exactly how that sounds reading it back.

I sat on the couch staring at my phone, trying to rearrange names and faces in my head. Nothing lined up.

Then I heard something at my front door.

A soft scrape across the floor, like something thin sliding under the gap. No knock. No footsteps.

I watched the bottom of the door for a while, then forced myself to get up.

The hallway outside was empty. No one at the elevator. No doors closing. Just the usual building hum.

On the floor inside my door was a narrow strip of plastic.

It was the size of an old label. The surface was off-white and a little glossy. The edges curled up slightly. One side felt faintly sticky, as if it had already gone on and off a few things.

I picked it up.

One side had tallies on it, drawn in neat, thin black lines.

Five lines, a small gap, five more, and so on. At the end of the last group the ink had dragged a little.

Underneath the tallies, in very small block letters, was a name:

LIAM

The lines of the letters were clean, with a bit of bleed into the plastic.

I turned it over.

The other side had a symbol.

Three short horizontal lines stacked with equal spacing. A single vertical line went straight down through all three. The ink was dark and solid. It didn’t match any logo or alphabet I recognized, but it looked deliberate.

Staring at it gave me the same pressure in my head I’d felt in the stairwell when the number shifted meaning.

Below the symbol, the rest of the space was crowded with very small marks. Too tight to make out clearly. My eyes kept trying to turn them into letters and failing.

At the bottom, in a less steady hand, was a short sentence:

YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO SEE.

The T in “to” had a faint extra line starting in the wrong direction.

My hand shook enough that I almost dropped the strip.

I opened the door again.

The hallway was still empty.

I shut the door, locked it, then locked it again even though I knew that didn’t do anything extra. I sat down with my back against it and put the label on the coffee table where I could see it.

I know the normal checklist of what I’m supposed to do.

Burn it. Throw it away. Call the cops and sound insane. Book a therapist. Ask a doctor if I’m having a break with reality. Hand the label to someone else and see if they feel anything staring at it.

I haven’t done any of that.

The label is in the top drawer of my nightstand. Every time I think about taking it out and getting rid of it, I hear that old tapping pattern in my head, matching my breathing, and I close the drawer again.

I haven’t gone back to Building D.

I pulled it up on satellite imagery instead. The industrial park is there. The footprint of Building D is there. The section where the south annex should be is just a little smeared on every set of images, like the file glitched.

One afternoon I got in the car and started driving toward the highway exit that would take me there.

As I approached it, my hands locked on the wheel. My chest tightened. I couldn’t move my foot to hit the turn signal. I took the next exit to a gas station, parked, and sat there until it was dark, then drove home using a different route.

I think about the tallies on that stairwell wall all the time.

Two groups. A gap. One missing. Later, no gap. Everything filled.

Whatever that place is, it was tracking something. It knew there was an empty line.

It let me walk out anyway.

I don’t know why.

Maybe it needed someone to remember its layout. Maybe this is how it stays open—by sitting in the back of someone’s mind and then getting written down like this. Maybe the label is just its way of marking that I still belong on that count.

I’m not writing this because I think it’s a cool story.

I’m writing it because I can’t stop counting now. Breaths. Steps in the hallway. Heater clicks. The little green flash from the router. Whenever anything repeats, my brain tracks it automatically.

I keep waiting for something external to line up perfectly with it.

Sometimes around three in the morning, I wake up with my hand clenched like I’m holding a cold rail. My arm muscles feel tired. My lungs feel like they’ve been working harder than they should for someone lying still.

For a few seconds, my bedroom feels thin and the memory of those stairs feels solid.

On nights when the building is quiet and there’s no traffic outside and the heater stops, I hear something else in the background of my thoughts.

Not tapping. Not scraping.

Just a calm, steady sense of something keeping count, floor by floor, and never running out of numbers to say.",1,1763664378.0,TheDarkArchive,0,1.0,False

Just had the angry wee balloon removed yesterday and wanted to share my experience for those looking for positive stories with hyperkinetic gb. Will update as the weeks progress.

History: 4 or 5 years ago I had been having GI pain and reflux, including that rock in the stomach sensation, sore throat and strangling sensation. Had a HIDA scan a few 
had an ejection fraction of 86% which was reported as normal. Fast forward to this year, having more issues, most noticeably frequent gnawing pain in the exact same spot over the gb, plus's occasional bouts of nausea and vomiting. Learned about hyperkinetic gb in a group for another medical issue and revisited my report, which prompted me to see a surgeon who was familiar and offered to take it out based on the scan and consistent pain. 

I had surgery yesterday, and they found significant adhesion on the gb and some on liver. So that was welcome reassurance that the removal was the right choice. I handled chicken soup afterwards just fine, got a little burble later after toast with a little butter and a nibble of chocolate, but that dissipated quickly. Coffee went down fine today too! Incision pain is as expected but meds are making it manageable. The gas pain referred to the traps was rough for a while but getting better quickly. The tight hip pain in my right hip that I had been experiencing before surgery is much reduced, so I suppose I was subconsciously crunching up on that side when the gb was in there making trouble. Looking forward to other small improvements in less expected areas like that. Good luck, everyone!

1p2b4tn,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniCorner/comments/1p2b4tn/what_makes_a_good_analytical_essay_different_from/,What makes a good analytical essay different from others?,"This semester, I wrote more analytical essays than I ever imagined. At first, I had no idea what an analytical essay was - I just kept summarizing rather than analyzing. My professor's comments were cruel: ""You're telling me 'what' happened, not 'why' it's important"". That phrase is forever etched in my memory.

Here's what I finally realized (after too many Cs): a good analytical essay isn't about repeating what's already in the text. It's about breaking it down - focusing on structure, tone, argumentation, and symbolism - and then connecting those parts to the central idea. Essentially, you're showing how meaning is formed, not what it means on the surface.

I started reading examples of analytical essays instead of general guidelines. One good example provides more than ten vague pieces of advice. I chose specific analytical essay topics that really resonated with me - like media bias or dystopian themes - to avoid boredom while writing. I finally used an external editor (through [leoessays.com](https://leoessays.com/?rt=89cyqxXu)) to check the structure and transitions. They didn't rewrite the text for me, but simply pointed out my logical decisions - which, frankly, helped me learn the format rather than just submit the assignment.

If you're still wondering, ""What should an analytical essay look like?"" the short answer is: it's an argument based on evidence, not opinion. And the long answer? Well... the kind you'll only understand after rewriting the thesis five times and drinking too much coffee.

By the way, what's the hardest part of writing an analytical essay for you? Coming up with a thesis, finding examples, or sticking to the word limit?",1,1763663873.0,UniCorner,0,1.0,False

Moving ranks as one of life's most stressful events, right up there with divorce or losing a job. You might be surprised to learn that the average person moves about 11 times in their lifetime. That's why it's crucial to understand what you're up against.

Good planning can significantly reduce your stress. Your moving checklist should start at least eight weeks before the big day. This well-laid-out plan helps you track everything from utility transfers to getting quotes from movers. Local moves typically cost around $1,250, so it's recommended to obtain at least three different estimates.

Smart moving tricks can transform your experience. To name just one example, see how placing plates vertically cuts down on breakage. Pack heavy books in rolling suitcases to save your back, and label boxes with different colors for each room to make unpacking easier. Additionally, pack a bag with overnight essentials so you won't have to search through boxes on day one.

Let us guide you through proven strategies that will keep you sane during your move.

**Start Smart: Planning Your Move**

A well-planned move can turn a chaotic experience into something you can handle easily. You'll need time to get supplies, work out the details, and deal with any problems that pop up. The earlier you start, the better.

**Create a moving checklist early**

The key to a successful move starts with a detailed checklist. You should start this process at least eight weeks before your moving date. This gives you enough time to research your options, compare services, and book what you need before everything's taken.

Your moving checklist should work like a command center. A physical binder and digital file can help you keep all your moving documents in one place. The organizer has sections for:

* Estimates and contracts
* Important contact information
* Timeline of tasks with deadlines
* Inventory of valuables with photos
* Budget tracking spreadsheet

NorthStar Moving Company's founder Laura McHolm, with over 25 years of experience, says good planning helps keep you sane during a move. Your checklist does more than remind you of tasks—it lets you rest easy knowing you haven't missed anything important.

**Decide between DIY or hiring movers**

Your first big choice is whether to move yourself or hire professionals. This decision will affect your budget, timeline, and stress levels throughout the process.

Professional movers make things easier with their expertise. They do the heavy lifting, bring special equipment, and ensure your belongings. E.E. Ward Moving & Storage's president Brian Brooks suggests looking for movers about two months before your move to get the best rates. He also says you should get at least three estimates.

DIY moves usually cost less for local moves. Most people spend under $500 on self-moves, while container services run between $500-$1,500. Notwithstanding that, you'll need to do more physical work and coordinate everything yourself.

Here's what to think over:

1. Distance of your move (longer distances favor professional services)
2. Volume and weight of your belongings
3. Presence of specialty items like pianos or pool tables
4. Your physical capabilities and available help
5. Budget constraints and flexibility

**Set a realistic moving budget**

A detailed moving budget helps avoid financial surprises during this stressful time. Look at what your specific move needs—distance, timeline, special items, and extra services.

Your budget should cover obvious costs like transportation and supplies, plus things people often forget such as temporary storage, cleaning services, or childcare during moving day. Summer moves often get pricey because that's when most people move.

Financial experts recommend adding 5-10% more to your total moving budget for unexpected expenses. This safety net helps when unexpected expenses arise. Keep track of your actual spending compared to your estimates.

**Schedule utility transfers and address changes**

Utility transfers are a vital task that people often put off. Service providers need at least three weeks' notice to schedule disconnections and connections.

You'll need to contact:

* Water and sewage treatment
* Electricity and natural gas
* Internet and cable services
* Trash and recycling collection
* Home security systems

Schedule your utilities to disconnect one day after you leave and connect one day before you arrive at your new place. This gives you time to address any service issues before they become a problem.

USPS will forward your mail for free for one year after you submit your change of address. After that, update your address with banks, subscription services, doctors, and government offices, including the DMV and voter registration.

These preparation steps make moving to your new home much easier. You'll avoid costly mistakes and reduce stress by planning.

**Declutter Before You Pack**

A significant step comes before you grab those boxes and packing tape - decluttering can make your move smooth or chaotic. The **best moving tip** that ever spread is to reduce your belongings before moving. This saves money, cuts down packing time, and lets you start fresh in your new home.

**Sort items into keep, donate, and toss**

Creating distinct sorting piles changes decluttering from an overwhelming task to something you can handle. Your sorting system should have three main categories:

* **Keep**: Items you use regularly, need, or truly love
* **Donate/Sell**: Items in good condition that could benefit others
* **Toss/Recycle**: Broken, expired, or unusable items

Professional organizers say you should skip the ""maybe"" pile. This follows the OHIO rule: ""Only Handle It Once"". Make an immediate decision about each item—it stays or goes. This stops undecided items from piling up and slowing you down.

Check everything systematically—cabinets from front to back, junk drawers, clothing, gadgets, and old boxes. Items you don't sort now will need handling later at your new home, so it's better to decide now.

**Use the 'would I buy it again?' rule**

One question helps cut through emotional attachment to your stuff: ""If I were moving tomorrow, would I take this with me?"". This makes you review each item's real value in your life.

These additional filtering questions help too:

1. Have I used this in the last year? (The one-year rule is a good measure)
2. Is this item in good condition?
3. Does it serve a current purpose?
4. Will it fit in my new space?
5. Is it worth the space it takes?

The ""would I buy it again?"" rule works great with kitchen gadgets, decorative items, and clothing. If you wouldn't buy it today, maybe it's time to let go.

**Schedule donation pickups or junk removal**

Your sorted belongings should leave your home quickly. Keeping donate or toss piles around might make you second-guess your choices.

Look into these donation options:

* Local charities and organizations accepting specific types of donations
* Donation centers offering pickup services (great for furniture or large quantities)
* Specialized recycling facilities for electronics or hazardous materials

You could sell valuable items to help with moving costs. Try online marketplaces, virtual garage sales, or consignment shops. Some items need special handling or scheduling with waste management services if they can't be donated or sold.

**Think over short-term storage for undecided items**

Some items might not fit any category right away. Short-term storage can be a practical solution in these cases.

Short-term storage works well for:

* Seasonal items you'll need later
* Sentimental belongings that need more thought
* Items whose usefulness depends on your new living situation

Calculate how much space your items need before choosing storage. A moving pod might be enough for smaller amounts, while bigger quantities could need a storage unit. Storage adds to your moving costs, so use it carefully instead of avoiding decisions.

Systematic decluttering makes your move easier and creates space for new experiences in your next home. Someone who moved 15+ times said it best: ""Moving is one of the best times to find out which items you really don't need anymore... You find out that you haven't really used a lot of the stuff in your house in the last year or so"".

**Packing Tips That Actually Work**

You've sorted through your stuff, and now it's time to pack. A smooth move depends on your packing strategy. The right techniques will save time, protect your items, and make unpacking easier at your new place.

**Set up a packing station**

A dedicated packing area turns random boxing into the quickest way to pack. Your packing station works as command central throughout the move.

Pick a flat, spacious surface like a dining table or empty countertop. This spot needs enough room to sort items and put boxes together. Your station should have these supplies:

* Sturdy boxes in various sizes
* Packing tape and dispenser
* Permanent markers in multiple colors
* Bubble wrap and packing paper
* Labels or colored stickers
* Box cutter and scissors

This setup eliminates the hassle of searching for supplies while packing. Additionally, it helps keep the rest of your home organized as you tackle each room.

**Use linens and clothes to wrap fragile items**

One of the **best moving tips** lets you use items you already own as packing materials. You'll save money and create less waste.

Towels, blankets, and clothes are great cushioning for delicate items. Stack plates vertically with t-shirts between them to prevent breaks. Socks protect stemware and fill empty box spaces around fragile items. Bath towels work great to wrap vases, picture frames, and other breakables.

Your clothes aren't the only alternative to store-bought materials:

* Newspapers and magazines work for general wrapping
* Clean plastic bags offer good cushioning
* Popcorn serves as a biodegradable packing material

This smart approach protects valuables while packing soft items—you'll knock out two tasks at once.

**Color-code and label boxes by room**

Messy boxes create headaches at both ends of your move. A color-coding system makes everything easier for everyone involved.

Give each room in your new home its own color. Mark boxes with colored tape, stickers, or markers. Movers can spot where boxes belong without reading every label.

Label each box with:

1. The room name
2. A brief description of contents
3. Priority level (high for immediate needs)
4. Box number (e.g., ""Kitchen - Dishes - High - Box 3"")

Put these labels on several sides of each box. Boxes stay visible no matter how they're stacked. A ""color key"" posted at your new home's entrances helps everyone find the right spots quickly.

**Take photos of box contents and electronics**

Snap a quick picture of what's inside before sealing each box. This digital record helps you find specific items without opening dozens of boxes. These photos also document valuable items for insurance.

Electronics with multiple cords need a photo before unplugging. This quick step saves lots of time during setup. Colored tape or tags can match cords to their devices.

**Pack a moving essentials bag and box**

The ""Open Me First"" collection might be your most valuable **moving tip** yet.

Pack these items in your essentials bag:

* Medications and toiletries
* Change of clothes and pajamas
* Phone chargers and important documents
* Basic first aid supplies

Your essentials box should have:

* Toilet paper and paper towels
* Basic cleaning supplies
* Shower curtain and towels
* Kitchen necessities (plates, utensils, can opener)
* Snacks and water
* Basic tools for furniture assembly

This preparation keeps you from digging through boxes for necessities after a long moving day.

**Room-by-Room Packing Hacks**

Moving presents unique packing challenges for each room in your home. Professional movers have learned the best techniques after handling thousands of moves. These room-specific tricks will turn your packing into a smart operation that saves time and prevents damage.

**Kitchen: Pack plates vertically and use pots for storage**

Your kitchen holds the most breakable items in the house. Don't stack plates horizontally - the weight can cause them to break. Pack them **vertically** like records in a box instead. This spreads the pressure evenly and prevents cracks.

Make your large cookware work harder by turning them into storage containers. Stack smaller pots inside bigger ones with packing paper between them. Fill these pots with spices, tools, or utensils and secure the lid with rubber bands. Your smaller items stay protected while you save box space.

Here's a clever trick: slide disposable foam plates between your regular plates as dividers—no need to wrap each one. You can also use potholders as knife sleeves to protect the blades and make unpacking safer.

**Bedroom: Leave clothes on hangers and use garbage bags**

Make closet moves easier by keeping clothes on hangers. Group 20-30 hanging items together for short moves. Slide a garbage bag up from the bottom and tie it at the top around the hanger hooks. You'll have instant garment bags that keep clothes clean and wrinkle-free.

Vacuum-sealed storage bags work great for clothes you don't wear often. These bags help you pack bulky items like winter coats and bedding that would fill entire boxes.

Clean and fold all bedding before moving day. Pack it in a waterproof bin or large box. You'll have clean sheets ready for your first night without digging through multiple boxes.

**Living Room: Use blankets for electronics and label cords**

Electronics need extra care when moving. Use original packaging for TVs and gaming consoles if you have it. Otherwise, wrap them in blankets or bubble wrap. Pay special attention to corners and screens.

Take photos of your cable setup before unplugging anything. Label each cord with masking tape to show which device it belongs to. Keep related items together—console, controllers, and cables—so you won't miss pieces during setup.

Flat-screen TVs need extra protection. Put the original stand back on if you have it. Lay the screen face-down on something soft, wrap it well in bubble wrap, and add cardboard corners for more protection.

**Bathroom: Wrap liquids and keep a first aid kit handy**

Bathroom items can be tricky due to the presence of liquids and small containers. Stop leaks by opening plastic bottles, pushing out extra air, and quickly recapping them with plastic wrap. Put all liquid containers in sealed plastic bags just in case.

Keep medications and first aid supplies in a separate, marked container with you, not in the moving truck. You'll have quick access to essential health items without searching boxes.

Wrap fragile bathroom items like porcelain pieces in packing paper first, then bubble wrap. Pack small cosmetics and toiletries in travel bags with compartments to keep them organized and protected.

Line all bathroom boxes with towels at the bottom. Put heavy items in first, lighter ones on top. Mark these boxes ""BATHROOM"" clearly and add ""FRAGILE"" labels to boxes with breakable items.

**Moving Day Survival Guide**

Your big day has finally arrived—moving day. A solid plan helps you handle the unique challenges that come with this day.

**Wake up early and review your checklist**

Start your day earlier than usual. Set your alarm clock an hour before you think you should to handle any surprises. Right after waking up, go through your moving checklist one last time to make sure everything's covered.

Label any boxes you missed and clear paths so items are easy to reach before your movers or helping friends show up. Taking photos of your empty home after loading everything gives you proof of its condition.

**Keep snacks, water, and chargers nearby**

Moving takes a lot of energy, so you'll need good fuel. Keep a separate cooler with:

* Water bottles and hydrating drinks
* Non-perishable snacks (granola bars, nuts, fruit)
* Portable phone chargers or power banks
* Simple first aid supplies

Take these items with you instead of putting them in the moving truck. This way, you can grab energy-boosting snacks throughout the day without searching through boxes.

**Have a plan for kids and pets**

Moving day can be overwhelming for children and pets. Make arrangements ahead of time to keep everyone stress-free. Friends or family can watch them at a different location if possible.

If you can't find someone to help, set up a quiet, secure room away from the action where pets can stay safe with familiar items and water. You can also create a ""kid zone"" with activities and toys to keep children busy. Having someone you trust watch over them during the day works best.

**Do a final walkthrough and take meter photos**

After loading everything, check your property one last time. Look inside cabinets, closets, the attic, basement, and garage so nothing gets left behind. Take clear photos of utility meter readings for your final bills.

Check that all windows are closed, appliances are off, and doors are locked during this walkthrough. Photos of your empty home show its condition when you leave, which can protect your security deposit or prevent issues with buyers later.

**Unpacking Without the Overwhelm**

The real challenge begins after the moving truck leaves - you need to turn a house full of boxes into a livable home. Unpacking can be smooth and manageable with the right strategy. You can settle into your new space without feeling stressed.

**Start with the essentials and the kitchen**

Your essentials box should come off the truck first or travel with you in your car. This box contains items you need right away, including toiletries, medications, and basic kitchenware.

The kitchen deserves your attention before other rooms. Most professional organizers agree it's the heart of your home. Start with everyday dishware, utensils, and basic cookware that help you prepare meals. A working coffee maker, toaster, and vital appliances will bring a sense of normalcy to your space.

**Break down boxes as you go**

Empty boxes need immediate breakdown and storage. This simple habit shows your progress and boosts confidence. The growing stack of flattened boxes proves how much you've accomplished. On top of that, it keeps your new home from feeling cramped, which helps prevent moving fatigue.

**Set a deadline to stay motivated**

Unpacking needs a timeline or it might never end. Create a schedule that divides the work into manageable parts. You could focus on major areas during weekends and tackle smaller projects on weeknights. Note that it's fine if unpacking takes weeks instead of days.

Your calendar can help fight procrastination with specific unpacking sessions. Maybe even set a housewarming party date as your final deadline - nothing gets things done like knowing guests will visit soon!

**Make unpacking fun with music or takeout**

Turn unpacking into an enjoyable activity. Play your favorite upbeat playlist, listen to podcasts, or enjoy an audiobook while you work. Order takeout from nearby restaurants - you'll reward yourself and explore your new neighborhood at the same time.

Ask an organized friend to help out. One expert says, ""If you know someone who's incredibly organized, they'll likely be dying to get into your apartment to help out.""

Your unpacking journey marks a fresh start in your new home - face it with patience and a positive mindset.

**Conclusion**

Moving ranks as one of life's most challenging transitions. All the same, you can turn this daunting experience into something manageable with the right mindset. This piece covers strategies to help you relocate without losing your cool.

A successful move starts with proper planning. Your detailed checklist works as your roadmap, and smart budgeting helps avoid financial surprises. Time spent decluttering before you pack substantially cuts down your workload and moving costs. This investment pays off throughout your entire move.

Smart packing makes a world of difference. You stay in control of the chaos by color-coding boxes, taking photos of what's inside, and keeping essentials bags ready. On top of that, room-specific methods like vertical plate packing and using clothes as padding save money and prevent damage.

Your moving day becomes much easier when you're well-prepared. Starting early, keeping drinks and snacks available, and doing careful final checks help avoid common problems that can throw off even the best-planned moves.

The unpacking process works best when you tackle it step by step. Start with your must-have items and work through one room at a time. This helps you settle into your new place without feeling swamped. Each broken-down box shows progress and keeps you going.

Moving tests your patience and organization skills, but these tried-and-true strategies make everything easier to handle. Take heart knowing millions of people move successfully each year using these same techniques. Soon enough, your new house will feel like home—boxes emptied, items in place, and the stress of moving fading into memory.

\-NY Islanders v DET Red Wings Over 6.0 (-110) | 0.5 Units

 

**Why This Pick?**

This game should have a big total, friends. The Islanders smoked the Red Wings just last month 7-2, and that was with Cam Tabot (2.71 GAA) goaltending. In addition, John Gibson’s (3.31 GAA) last 4 straight starts have seen final totals of at least 7 goals. Despite being the underdog, NY will get to him early in my opinion. That said, both offenses have been efficient recently, I expect them both to contribute fairly early on – take the Over to cash.

As mentioned in the title I’ve got this annoying problem with the Bambino Plus portafilter leaking from day one (I just got the machine today). I am using fresh dark roast beans (roasted just 3 days ago) and Grinding them with my Baratza Encore Esp.
16Grams at Grind size 15, as with 14 I can barely get any coffee out and 16 seems to flow out too fast. (Although with 15 you see It also coming out a bit too fast)
Every time I think “yeah this is going to be a nice shot” it starts leaking from the side. I’ve cleaned the group gasket thoroughly so that should be clean. The filter itself also is clean of any coffee that might be sitting on the edge.
I’ve also looked into it and many people have reported this problem as well with many different fixes. Will I need another portafilter? Should I just send it in as it may be faulty? Maybe the coffee produces too much crema? 
First Espresso machine ever, would really appreciate some opinions on this

I stumbled upon OMAD and fasting in general somewhat by accident in a desire to lose a small amount of weight in a short period of time.

I'm posting this here as I have some observations and some questions.

Background

I'm a 51 year old physically active male who is pretty slim (BMI of about 20). I typically run 40km to 50km per week, and I have never thought about how much I eat.

A couple of months ago, I developed achilles tendinitis, and so haven't been doing much physical activity. I've noticed a bit of a belly appearing and wanted to nip it in the bud in as short a time as possible. Ideally 1-2 weeks. I was hoping to lose about 3kg.

My diet

So, I am currently one week into what I have now discovered is called the OMAD diet.

I am basically just having an evening meal at about 8pm which is currently circa 1,500 calories (as my original desire was weight loss). For the rest of the day, I am managing on water or tea/coffee with a splash of milk.

I am consuming a lot more water than pre-diet (probably 2.5 litres / day) in a bid to stave off hunger and to shed any excess water retention.

Observations / results

1. Hunger - other than one day (last Sunday), the hunger has always been manageable. I'm surprised how easy I have found this.

2. Mood - I have felt less anxious / stressed, and more energetic. 

3. Other physical symptoms - I haven't experienced anything else. No light-headedness or nausea 

4. Urine - my urine is now pretty clear.

5. Weight loss - so far I've lost about 1.8 kg 

Questions 

Because of the positive effects on mood, I am thinking of continuing on OMAD for a longer duration: but without the wish to lose any more weight (so will probably end up having an evening meal of 2,000 to 2,500 calories).

Here are my questions:

1. What are the potential reasons for my improved mood?

2. Have I triggered Autophagy and / or Ketosis? Is there any way to tell?

3. As this diet has only lasted 1 week, I haven't been taking any supplements. Once I increase my calorie intake to 2,500 in my OMAD, I'll focus more on having a well-balanced diet. I was just wondering if there was then any need or benefit to take any supplements at all?

4. Is there any reason not to continue OMAD indefinitely?

5. I have a weakness for refined carbs. Particularly white pasta and white rice. Far too many of my calories come from this. I think this needs to change, and I was just generally interested in suggestions as to what people typically consume instead of these.

Thanks for your time.

1p2azn9,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbyborderlines/comments/1p2azn9/anyone_else_annoyed_when_they_apologize_for_the/,Anyone else annoyed when they apologize for the wrong thing?,"I feel so petty that this annoys me and is still bothering me quite a while later.

A while ago I was visiting my mom. I'm lactose intolerant so tend to avoid dairy even more when traveling, so I wasn't eating cheese.

She was ranting about how my bones are all going to get weak and break if I \*\*never\*\* have dairy (so many issues there but it could be it's own post, but mostly, I do eat dairy, with lactase pills, just not when travelling and had explained this).

She happened to see cheese strings were on sale, and hit me with ""I'm sorry I never bought you cheese strings""

Now this was about something specific, not out of the blue - but it also came out of seemingly nowhere (other than trying to make me eat dairy).

I told her it was okay, etc and just kind of hoped she'd drop it - but of course it turned into a thing about how me not eating dairy must be her fault for not buying me cheese strings as a kid.

This actually in hindsight has really annoyed me. The problem at the time wasn't that she didn't buy me cheese strings, but that she'd refused to listen to me and lied to me at the time.

We were tight on money when I was a kid. I had trouble bringing myself a lunch to school often too. I'd forget to make it etc - those parts are on me. But I knew better than to ask for extras.

Except I'd noticed the cheese strings were on sale for $2. The price of a single to go coffee, or a chocolate bar at checkout my mom would often buy.

So I did something unusual for myself and actually asked if we could get them for my lunches. I was probably around 10. She told me they were too much money and we couldn't afford it, so I tried to tell her they were on sale and cheap but she just started ranting about how I was ungrateful.

At the checkout she proceeded to buy chocolate and even offered to buy me one, so like she had the $2 (and stupidly I pointed it out at the checkout and got yelled at once we got to the car for making her look bad). She had the money but not the patience to listen to me, or get me something to make packing my lunches easier and stuff. But she could get me something frivolous, when she could ""show off"", as long as it wasn't what I asked for.

Somehow, this stupid thing with them has come up so many times over the years, and it's never ""I'm sorry I didn't listen to you"" or ""I'm sorry I lied"" or ""I'm sorry I yelled just because you asked for food for lunches"" but it's ""I'm sorry I didn't buy you cheese strings so now you don't eat dairy, and will have weak bones, I'm such a terrible mother""

It's not the lack of cheese strings that hurt me there.

**Two neighbors. One teacup on a string. Years of anonymous notes between balconies.**

Yet for two years, she's been exchanging witty notes with her mysterious upstairs neighbor through a teacup and string, falling for his charm without ever seeing his face

Little does she know, her anonymous pen pal is none other than Lucian Devereaux, the intimidating (and irritatingly handsome) CEO of her new workplace. As their paths collide in a series of hilarious mishaps and undeniable chemistry, Saskia finds herself caught between the man she's falling for through ink and paper, and the boss she can't stop thinking about.

But in a world of miscommunications and missed connections, can these two star-crossed neighbors figure out that the love they've been looking for has been just one floor away all along?

Yet for two years, she's been exchanging witty notes with her mysterious upstairs neighbor through a teacup and string, falling for his charm without ever seeing his face

When Saskia lands a prestigious job at Devereaux Cosmetics, her carefully separated worlds begin to collide. Her new, intimidating boss, CEO Lucian Devereaux, seems determined to make her life complicated. Between a series of hilarious mishaps and undeniable chemistry that feels strangely familiar, Saskia finds herself caught between the man she's falling for through ink and paper, and the boss she can't stop thinking about.

Packaging designer Saskia Moreno swears she has her life together—if you ignore the overbearing family group chat, the coffee addiction, and her talent for accidentally embarrassing herself in front of her new boss. The only thing keeping her sane? The mysterious upstairs neighbor who’s been trading witty teacup notes with her for years.

When Saskia lands a dream job at Devereaux Cosmetics, she doesn’t expect her new, brooding CEO to be *that* Lucian Devereaux—the man who makes HR nervous and apparently has never laughed in his life. Between disastrous meetings, undeniable chemistry, and the world’s worst elevator encounters, Saskia finds herself caught between two men… who might just be the same one.

1p2avrt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1p2avrt/aitah_for_confessing_to_my_friend/,AITAH for confessing to my friend?,"Ive been racking my brain over this for some time and I feel as though im totally in the wrong about this but still confused, not necessarily because im unsure but more because I feel like im wrong to blame this person, idk I just need a second opinion.

So one day one of my female friends introduce me to this other friend of hers, I'll call her Tara, for her anonymity, at a celebration sometime earlier in 2025 about Ukraine and its culture. There are a lot of other people including our friend and all is well and overall it was a fun two days. At first I have no feelings at all but after the second time we meet along with other friends, she starts to become more visible to me and i start liking her company, but nothing romantically. She's funny, smart and well read and also into music. Sometime shortly after I ask her to teach me guitar if that's okay with her since ive been trying to for years solo and with no success and she agrees to this. At the time she was struggling with money so she wanted to do paid lessons which is fine by me it mutually benefits both of us. 
These few hours a week are lovely and just great banter in general, Lots of laughter, chatting & tea between guitar practice, and my trust in her grows a lot, one particular instance of this was me buying some duvets & sheets for my new appartment i was moving into. I tried paying but was literally cents short of the essential items. She immediately jumped in and offered to pay and said I could pay later. It was fairly expensive and is something I usually dont expect from somebody who has so recently become friend of mine, so I was pretty solid with this person, joking after that she was my ""sugar momma"" lol.

After a few months of weekly lessons I do start to feel something about her, and keep to myself out of fear of hurting our friendship. This continues and I feel like I could at least do something to show my appreciation. Previously I had bought her sunflowers for her & her mother for Ukrainian independence day, but had marked it on my calendar the incorrect date (this happens often) and so for the real thing I decided as a show of thanks for all her effort & patience i would show my respect & appreciation.

The thing is, this came after I had very embarrassingly said to her that I had feelings for her, which in the fastest the human brain can respond i was immediately regretting as it was quite awkward. I apologised to her and while she was reasonably uncomfortable was quick to brush past it. Honestly im not sure why I even did but non the less I was comfortable being friends as long as she was, especially since she already had a partner she told me about that same day. After we walked to my bus stop I always arrive and depart from, the convo was very casual and talked about among other things, how she was comfortable continuing as things were, and we assured me she was, even saying to me that she had some idea about my feelings but didnt quite know as I can be flirty person and if I needed to could stop with her and generally do whatever she needed to feel comfortable and she assured me that all was okay, even talking about the difficulties of men being friends & how women & men have different difficulties when it comes to friendly behaviour. Before I left I asked her to double check was she really comfortable with still being friends and she assured me she was. 

I want to just highlight as well that while people can agree in one instance, they can also change their mind later which wasnt lost to me before, then, or after this.

That brings me to our last meeting, up till then for a few weeks we'd meet as usual and all was the same, she even invited me to a gathering of some of our mutual friends for the day, was very good. Our last meeting felt different compared to every other, slightly distant, colder and less enthusiastic. (its ireland so weather can do this to people too) The previous week we were giggling & laughing about pronunciation so I could tell something very recent happened, but unsure. That same day I had made a card with a Ukrainian Tryzub on it i had drawn with colours of the flag as background, and inside had wrote general compliments to all her good deeds & my respect, and said among this, ""no matter my feelings i will be supportive to you whenever you need me"". (I intended to make several for my friends but it ended up taking hours to make just one) I had also bought two flowers, one for her and her mother (two for one person is a bad sign) and an assortment of cheeses.

After that day not much of note happened. We continued to text over the phone as normal. That is until the day before my birthday.
I had asked her if she wanted to join me & an assortment of my other friends and she texted me the following:

""Hey. 

I'm sorry, I don't want to hurt you, but I don't like to lie.
I wanted to tell you that I thought about our last chat at the coffee shop. I'm feeling uncomfortable about being around. Hope you understand..
I hope that you will have excellent birthday party""

I had never felt such a gut punch in my entire life. I was so shocked and undstanding what was said wanted to ask why she had not told me sooner as months had gone by and no hit or suggestion of this had ever come up or ever been mentioned or hinted. I continued to ask what it is exactly but she just said I was a lovely person and she was sorry to do it. That was the end of it. Afterwards bidding her farewell and respecting her wishes, not speaking to her since then. It has pained me a lot

That is until I asked a friend of hers. You she this other male friend of hers who i cant say, told me that this boyfriend she had broke up with her suddenly and that it had to with her not wanting to associate with other men (im paraphrasing) cause of this. Another factor i havent also mentioned that her last meeting was shortly before college started, and wouldnt have time like we did before but said, to paraphrase, would see what could be done, to continue lessons.

Am I the asshole for saying what I did to her all those months ago. I dont want to prevent myself from learning from my mistakes, I just feel so ashamed, and slightly suspect she kept that secret just so she could get money from me until college started since she said a few times how she disliked having a regular job in general and wanted to work independently. Am I just justifying my feelings by thinking she was using me? Sorry its so long mb.",1,1763663432.0,AITAH,2,0.6,False

1p2atrz,https://www.reddit.com/r/MotivationByDesign/comments/1p2atrz/advice_how_to_trick_your_brain_into_craving/,[Advice] How to trick your brain into craving boring work: the dopamine detox guide that actually works,"Let’s be real. Most people hate doing boring work. And yeah, that includes studying, responding to emails, deep-focus tasks, even folding laundry. These things don’t *feel* rewarding, even when we know they *are*. But what if it wasn’t really about the work? What if your brain’s just been trained to find excitement *elsewhere*?

Scrolling TikTok, gaming, binge-watching shows, mindless snacking — they all hijack your brain’s reward system. Over time, they change your “baseline.” So the normal stuff starts feeling unbearable. If you're struggling with motivation, procrastination, or attention span, you're not broken. You're just overstimulated.

This post is a practical guide backed by research, neuroscience, YouTube gems, and books. No fluff. No lecture. Just what actually works. Too much advice out there is regurgitated garbage from influencers who don’t even understand how focus works or what dopamine actually *does*. Time to fix that.

Here’s how to rewire your brain to *want* boring but productive work again:

- **Cut back fast dopamine first**  
  Dr. Anna Lembke, author of *Dopamine Nation*, explains that we’ve become addicted not to substances, but to behaviors that spike dopamine. You don’t have to quit TikTok forever, but scale it back. Start with 24–48 hours off all high-stim input: no social media, junk food, clickbait loops. It's not a punishment. It's a reset button. After 2 days, even reading starts to feel *good* again.

- **Pair boring work with small rewards**  
  James Clear talks about this in *Atomic Habits*. Your brain works through cues and rewards. Stack boring tasks with mild dopamine buffers. Fold laundry while listening to a podcast. Write while sipping your favorite coffee. You trick the brain into linking the task with pleasure.

- **Use the “10-minute rule” to start**  
  Behavior scientist BJ Fogg recommends shrinking the behavior. Tell yourself you’ll work for 10 minutes. That’s it. Most times, you’ll keep going. The brain resists big effort, not small starts. This lowers friction and helps build consistency over time.

- **Use visual timers to gamify the boring**  
  The Pomodoro method isn’t new, but it’s underrated. The visual countdown creates urgency and makes time *visible*. Your brain sees the end and gets motivated to push. Tools like *Forest* or *TickTick* add a playful layer to it.

- **Track tiny wins**  
  According to research from Harvard Business School (*The Progress Principle* by Teresa Amabile), the #1 motivator at work isn’t money. It’s progress. Even small steps. Keep a “done” journal or use habit-tracking apps like *Streaks*. Your brain craves closure. When you *see* your inputs, they start to feel meaningful.

- **Create ‘deep boredom’ on purpose**  
  Cal Newport talks about “boredom resistance.” Most of us are so used to stimulation that we can’t tolerate silence. Schedule 5–10 minutes of staring at a wall, no phone, no distractions. Sounds dumb, but it trains your brain to stop fearing boredom. After a few days, reading or writing feels exciting by comparison.

- **Reframe how you think about effort**  
  Neuroscientist Andrew Huberman explains that dopamine isn’t just about rewards — it spikes during *effort*, if your brain *believes* effort is valuable. Literally telling yourself “this is making me better” while working dull tasks can *chemically* boost dopamine mid-task.

- **Use “novelty layering” to refresh tasks**  
  The brain loves novelty. Change your workspace, try ambient music, work in a cafe. Even switching laptop fonts helps. According to research from the APA, novelty increases engagement, even if the task stays the same.

- **Don’t confuse distraction with rest**  
  Watching Netflix for 6 hours isn’t rest if it leaves you feeling fried. True recovery is *low stimulus*. Walking, naps, slow music, time in nature. That’s how you rebuild mental energy. Stanford researchers found that even 15 minutes of nature exposure improves focus later.

- **Make distractions harder to reach**  
  Set your phone to grayscale. Log out of apps. Use tools like Cold Turkey, Freedom, or One Sec to add friction between you and dopamine-draining activities. If your brain can’t get the hit, it starts looking for pleasure in available options — aka your task list.

The truth is, your brain isn’t lazy. It’s just wired for pleasure efficiency. But the good news? Dopamine is trainable. You just need better inputs. You can actually teach your brain to *look forward* to the grind. It’s not magic. It’s just science, patience, and a little detox.",1,1763663309.0,MotivationByDesign,0,1.0,False

I met a extremely cute south east asian girl when I was doing my masters abroad. We both had done our undergrad in the same discipline, but were doing the MSc to pivot away. 

Initially I never spoke with her much, but when she gave me a Christmas gift is what flipped the switch. We went out more, grabbed coffee, went for drinks (just as friends) something felt good in that moment. She couldn't speak English fluently but her emotions portrayed everything. Then at the end of our course she dropped the bomb that she's going back home. Not staying here any longer. That kinda broke me. How would I function without talking to her/seeing her? I was shocked tbh. 

On the night before her flight, we both had way too much to drink. I do not know what was going through my mind atp in time, but I felt I should let her know that I appreciated the time together, even if did not involve anything sexual. I decided to ask her if long-distance was an option. Do not ask me why I did it, but yeah, that happened. Having deep talks when the person doesn't understand the language is tough, and she shrugged it off(?)

Fast forward a few months later, I was visiting her home country. She helped me pick a hotel to stay, and also took me around and paid for everything. Albeit it wasn't just us two, (another common friend of ours, her bestie who she met abroad) I still had a great time. I could just not get her out of my mind.

I do not know if I love her, or just her presence. Me being extremely clingy in nature, this is very difficult for me to not be in constant touch with her. She too started working recently and isn't as free as she was before.

I plan on moving to her country for work, but I believe by the time it'll take me to move there (3-4 years realistically) she'd be married off/we'd be too much out of touch to rekindle the spark.

It was neither a relationship, neither friendship. This was completely different, something that only we both understood and will know till the end. I miss having her around me:( ",5,1763663147.0,MidTwentiesIndia,2,1.0,False

Of all the things about school that I hate, and they truly are numerous, I hate the bus the most. In the morning I am always sleepy because school starts really early, and then I have to wait at the end of the driveway, and then I try to sleep on the bus but apparently I’m the only sleepy one because everyone else is always screaming. They scream swear words and they scream homophobic words and they even scream the really bad racist word. I've tried complaining to the bus driver but because the bus isn't technically school the bus driver has no real authority and all the kids on the bus are allowed to scream whatever words they please. I don't know why everyone feels the need to be even more horrible than normal on the bus, but they do.

Chris K sits down next to me on the bus as I'm trying to sleep.

“Yo, Colin,” says Chris K. “Do you like cookies?”

I stay silent, trying to look as asleep as I can. Do I like cookies? What a stupid question. Of course I like cookies, everybody likes cookies. Universal well-likedness is a definitional quality of cookies. I certainly don't enjoy *all* cookies because some cookies have raisins in them, but as a concept, cookies are obviously good and it is ridiculous to assume any given person would not like them.

“Helloooo! Hello! I'm talking to you! I'm asking you a question, Colin. Do you like cookies?” Why is he pestering me? Surely he has no real interest in the answer to the question–it can be assumed to be yes in nearly all cases–so there must be some other game here.

“Why are you being so mean to me, Colin? I'm just trying to be your friend.”

“Yeah,” says Chris K’s friend Kris C from the seat behind. “Why are you being such a *dick*?”

Are they going to keep bothering me until I confess my enjoyment of cookies? If I just say *yes I like cookies* are they going to just let me sleep?

“Yes,” I mutter.

“What's that, Colin? I didn't hear you,” says Chris K.

“Yes. I like cookies.”

Chris K smirks. “See, now was that so hard?” Kind of, yeah.

The bus pulls up to the school, and once again I didn't manage to get any sleep. We’re only a week or so away from summer break, and the weather has been a lovely blend of severe thunderstorm watches and tornado warnings. Today the rain is coming down so viciously its form cannot be accurately described as *drops*. Each kid pulls out his umbrella as he steps off the bus, but I still don't have an umbrella, and by the time I manage to sprint inside the building I may as well have jumped into a swimming pool with my clothes on. I try to shake off the water like a dog. I am aware of how silly I must look. I'm *always* aware of how silly I must look, but I don't know how to look un-silly.

“Hey Maya,” I say as I get to my locker. “I had a weird conversation on the bus, could you–”

But Maya’s not here, I just assumed she would be because it’s where she always is in the morning, and Tiffany Walz and Jackie Carrey just saw me talk to no one and call no one “Maya,” which is really embarrassing, and they’re giggling at me. I just ignore them and look back at my locker.

It’s okay. Maya is probably just sick today. I’m going to be okay. I need to figure out my game plan. I imagine Maya standing by my locker, helping me get ready for class like she usually is.

“Hey, man, what’s your first class today?” says Fake Maya.

“Homeroom,” I say (I don’t really say it, because I’m already embarrassed enough as it is having already been seen talking to a person who wasn’t there; I’m just imagining myself saying it).

“Obviously homeroom’s first, homeroom’s always first, don’t be a goober,” says Fake Maya, because Maya likes to tease me sometimes, even when she’s fake.

“First period’s math,” I fake-say.

“Did you finish your homework during class yesterday?” says Fake Maya.

“No.”

“Did you do it at home last night?”

“Also no.”

“So you need to finish your math homework during homeroom, then,” says Fake Maya. “That means you’re going to need your math book and your math notebook.”

“Right. Thanks, Real Maya!” I fake-say to Fake Maya, then gather my supplies and head to Mrs. Marshall’s Social Studies for homeroom.

I open up my math book to find the unfinished problems, then open my math notebook to where I left off yesterday, and it’s only when I bring my hand to the page that I realize I do not have a pencil. I am momentarily very upset with Fake Maya for forgetting to remind me to bring one, and then I am upset with myself for a much longer duration for being so stupid as to be upset with Fake Maya.

I should request a new pencil so I can finish my math homework. Mrs. Marshall even has a coffee cup on her desk full of them. I don’t even think I need to ask for a pencil, I can probably just take one from the cup.

I get up and walk over to Mrs. Marshall’s desk but as soon as one of my hands touches one of the pencils Mrs. Marshall says:

“Excuse me, what do you think you’re doing, Colin?”

“I forgot to bring a pencil to homeroom,” I say. “These pencils are for students to use, are they not?”

“They’re for students who have forgotten to bring a pencil, yes,” says Mrs. Marshall. “They are not free pencils for students who refuse to bring their own. You have taken too many of these pencils over the course of the year for me to give you the benefit of the doubt. Please sit down, Colin.”

“Mrs. Marshall, this is the first day I have neglected to bring a pencil to homeroom, or to any of my classes for that matter, for over two months. I can promise that my forgetfulness today is not part of a larger pattern. May I please take a pencil from the cup?”

“I really don’t appreciate the back-talking,” says Mrs. Marshall. “Go sit down.”

I am very upset with Fake Maya, because she is not Real Maya, and Real Maya would have helped me. I return to my desk and sit and do nothing because I have no options to do any meaningful something.

The bell rings to signal the end of homeroom. I need to go to my locker and retrieve one of my pencils before I go to math. Maybe Maya will be there, because it will turn out she isn’t sick today but was actually just late to school (though this is, I must admit, improbable, as Maya being late to school would also mean Mrs. Meyer would be late to school, and Mrs. Meyer can’t be late to school because she’s a teacher).

I reach my locker and Maya still isn’t there, and now I’m starting to get really worried. Every day before I became friends with Maya was so bad, and every day since I met Maya has been so good, and if Maya isn’t here to help me then the day is probably going to be bad. But maybe Maya is just by her own locker, gathering her own supplies. I walk over to Maya’s locker, but she isn’t there, either, and I think I’m starting to freak out a bit, but I shouldn’t be, because one morning without my friend shouldn’t be enough to make me have a tantrum.

…

“Mr. Hannigan,” says Mrs. Figi, my teacher for first period math. “Why are you completing your assignment with a purple magic marker?”

“I forgot to bring a pencil to class,” I say. “However, because this is math class, the skills I am being asked to demonstrate are related to my faculties of pure reason. It should not matter if…”

“You'll have a maximum score of eighty on today’s assignment,” says Mrs. Figi.

That might make me mad but I need to stay calm. Eighty’s not that bad on one daily assignment if I get an A on the final test (which I always do).

Brad comes up to my desk during the time Mrs. Figi gives us to get started on homework.

“Hey, Colin, I've got a question,” he says.

“Yeah? What?” I say.

“Do you like cookies?”

This again? I look up at him. “Why do you ask?”

“I'm curious,” says Brad. “I mean, I like cookies. I was wondering if we had liking cookies in common.”

Why are people asking me this asinine question today? Did everyone go to a big meeting where they all decided that this was how they were going to mess with me?

I stay quiet.

Brad snaps a few times in front of my face. “Hello? Earth to Colin. I'm asking you a question.” I need to ignore it. If I respond, I'm giving him what he wants. I stay silent.

“Mrs. Figi, I'm trying to ask Colin a question and he’s totally blowing me off!” says Brad.

“How rude!” says Mrs. Figi. “Didn't your mother teach you any *manners*, Hannigan?”

“Mrs. Figi, the question he was asking me–” 

“I don't want your excuses, Hannigan,” says Mrs. Figi. “Now, you're going to apologize to Brad right now and then *politely* answer the question.”

I want to have a tantrum because this treatment is very unfair, but if I have a tantrum I think Maya might be disappointed in me. But I can't just ignore it because apparently ignoring it is also against the rules now.

“I'm sorry, Brad. I, um, I like cookies.”

“Good, Mr. Hannigan,” says Mrs. Figi. “One demerit for your initial rudeness.”

Demerits don't matter anymore because we've already had the year’s last Reward Day and corresponding detention. It's a pointless demerit, issued only to further humiliate me. If it was me who had asked a dumb pointless question and then tried to get Mrs. Figi involved, I would have gotten in trouble for tattling. They post long lists of all the rules at Greenwood Middle School but really, the only rule that actually matters is that no matter what happens it’s always my fault.

I take a deep breath. It's what Maya calls a *grounding exercise*. I'm going to be okay. I just need to get through this one class and after that maybe Maya will be waiting for me at my locker and she can help me work through all of this.

I turn in my completed marker-soaked homework just as the bell rings. I make my way to my locker, but Maya still isn't there.

Josh Hanson comes up to my locker with Tiffany Walz and Hanna Swanson.

“Hey, can I ask you a question?” says Josh. I am already entirely certain what the question is going to be. “Do you like cookies?” Turns out I’m right.

I'm going to have a tantrum. I can feel it coming. But it's okay. I don't *need* Maya to get to the little study room off of the library, and even if I get a demerit for being late for my next class it doesn't matter because demerits don't matter anymore. I need to get out of here. I walk quickly in the direction of the library. Josh and Tiffany and Hanna pursue.

“Hey! I asked you a question!” shouts Josh. I pick up my pace. “Are you really gonna leave these lovely ladies hanging? Do you even *like* pretty girls?”

I can't go any faster just by walking. I start running.

“Hannigan!” shouts Mr. Dwinel as he comes out of the teacher’s lounge. “What did I say about running in the halls?” It is true. I'm not even skipping this time; no more than one of my feet is touching the ground at any given time. I am definitely just straight-up running. I stop. I can do this. Just take the pointless demerit then get to the library.

“We were just trying to ask Colin a question and he just started running away like a weirdo,” says Josh.

“Yes, Mr. Hannigan is an odd one, isn't he?” says Mr. Dwinel. “I suppose this ought to be worthy of a demerit, but considering demerits aren't really relevant anymore…you know, why should I let that stop me? Hannigan, a demerit. Now, can you please answer your friend Josh’s question?”

How many times do I keep having to do this? Every time I say *yes I like cookies* I feel more and more like a baby.

“Yes, Josh, I like cookies,” I say, barely masking my contempt.

“That's a very aggressive way to answer a very innocuous question,” says Mr. Dwinel. “Watch your body language. Body language is eighty-five percent of communication.” I know perfectly damn well what I'm doing with my body language.

I finally make it to the library and I hide away in the little study room. Okay, now I need to have my tantrum. I yell, shriek, cry, and yet: this isn't a tantrum. I'm not feeling the tantrum feelings. I need Maya to be here to help me through it. Without her, I'm just some psycho kid screaming in a room.

There’s pounding at the door. More than one person is knocking.

“Colin, do you like cookies?” “Do you like cookies, Colin?” “What's your opinion of cookies, Colin?”

And I should be having a tantrum, I *deserve* to be having a tantrum, and it's not coming. 

The pounding continues. I can't leave until I submit. Yes, everyone, I like cookies.

I am already a full fifteen minutes late for Mr. Leonard’s science. I suppose all the kids asking me if I like cookies are also late, but it brings me no comfort to imagine them all showing up and not getting yelled at for their tardiness. I complete Mr. Leonard’s science with the purple marker.

No less than thirteen different kids ask me if I like cookies as I stand in the back of the cafeteria line. Yes, I like cookies. Yes, I like cookies. Uh-huh, yep. Cookies are liked by me. I need to keep myself from crying, because that would be the only thing that could possibly make me look like more of a baby (other than maybe wearing a diaper).

I take my usual seat at the lonely table in the corner of the cafeteria, and as I pick up the gyros (to eat them) I see out of the corner of my eye: a popular kids’ table, with TJ and Brad and Megan and Katie and–

She’s not sick today. She’s here, sitting at the popular kids’ table with all her popular friends. She has her big toothy smile on and everything.

She probably is hanging out with them and not me because I’m needy. It can’t possibly be that fun to hang out with me. Who would enjoy helping me find my pencils and manage my notebooks? It’s not really hanging out at all, really, when you’re hanging out with me; it’s a chore. I am a burden and a leech. I’m staring, aren’t I? I’m looking at Maya sitting and giggling at the very popular jokes her very popular friends are probably making, and I’m not looking away, which is what staring is, and staring is very creepy, and I am a creep. And as much as I stare and stare, she doesn’t even so much as make a glance my way.

Cole Mencken takes a seat next to me. He’s holding one of the big chocolate chip cookies that they sell *a la carte* in the cafeteria line for extra money.

“Hey Colin, do you like cookies?” says Cole. Cole is a member of the Unpopular Kids Friend Group, so if even he’s making fun of me it means that I’m beneath even the unpopular kids in the Unpopular Kids Friend Group (in terms of popularity).

“Stop making fun of me, Cole,” I say.

“I’m not making fun of you,” says Cole. “I’m just asking you a question. Do you like cookies?”

All the *leave me alone*s in the world will not get me left alone. “Yes, Cole, I like cookies.”

“Well here, I have a cookie for you,” says Cole. He holds out the *ala carte* chocolate chip cookie. “Eat it.”

“No,” I say. I feel like such a stupid baby, refusing to eat what looks like a delicious chocolate chip cookie. “I don’t want it.”

“But you just said you like cookies,” says Cole. “That means you want this cookie. Eat it.”

“No. You bought the cookie. It's only fair if you eat it,” I say.

“I bought it to give it to you, because we’re friends,” says Cole. “Eat it.”

And I can imagine a teacher, any teacher really, yelling at me for not eating the cookie. The imaginary teachers are all calling me “anti-social” for my refusal. I eat the cookie, and it is as a matter of fact very tasty, and I hate myself for eating the cookie and looking like a cookie-eating baby.

And a line is forming now with people who have also paid their parents’ money to buy a cookie to make fun of me with, and I look over at Maya, and she’s too busy talking and smiling with all of her better friends to see how hard I’m getting made fun of today.

And I think for a moment that maybe I should talk to her during recess, but then I remember that I don’t have recess today because I have to do counseling with Mr. Peters. And sure enough, as I’m tossing my gyros in the trash (I didn’t finish them because of how many cookies the mean kids made me eat), I see Mr. Peters in the cafeteria doorway beckoning me with his finger. With a heavy sigh, I follow him to his office.

I sit down on the couch in Mr. Peters’ office. The couch is a kind of material that turns dark if you rub it one way and light if you rub it the other way so I’m always distracted by rubbing the couch to turn it different colors whenever I’m doing counseling with Mr. Peters and for a second I’ve forgotten about Maya and all the kids asking me if I like cookies because of how distracted I am by the couch-rubbings.

A red-and-white spider, identical to the one in Mr. Leonard’s room, is resting on its web on a bookshelf in front of all of the books about what you’re supposed to do if you’re sad your parents got divorced.

“Is that…” I begin, pointing at the spider.

“...Mr. Leonard’s old spider? The very same,” says Mr. Peters. “Mr. Leonard is retiring at the end of the year–well, I say retiring, but the man’s older than the dinosaurs and has some medical issues I ain’t s’posta be tellin’ you about. I’ll be surprised if he makes it to next fall. He’s had that spider since I went here, and I dunno, I guess you could say I have a certain attachment to it. Not that I even brought it here, it made a new camp here all by itself, if you can believe it. It knows I’m a friend.” He opens a jar and swallows an entire pretty big handful of white jellybeans (whole, without chewing) before he continues. “So, how are you feeling about the end of the school year?”

I haven’t really thought about it. I suppose there’s a little bit of dread–during the summer I won’t be able to see Maya unless I call her house and ask her to hang out and then have my mom drive me to her place (though I think her house is in theoretical biking distance) but then again Maya doesn’t want to be friends with me anymore because I’m needy and creepy and not fun.

“People have been asking me if I like cookies today,” I say.

“Cool,” says Mr. Peters. “So you’re making new friends?”

“No,” I say. “They’re doing it to be mean to me. They know it’s bothering me, and it’s very funny for me to be bothered.”

“Ah, I see,” says Mr. Peters. “That’s unfortunate. So tell me, why does it bother you so much?”

“It's like, um, imagine there's a preschool teacher trying to teach her class how voting works,” I say. “And so she asks the class ‘who here likes cookies?’ And all of the kids say ‘I like cookies, I like cookies, I like cookies,’ and each kid is really excited to say they like cookies because little kids think every little thing about themselves is special. Every time they get me to say ‘I like cookies’ it makes me look like a toddler.”

“Okay, I hear you,” says Mr. Peters. “That still doesn’t answer my question. Why does it bother you so much?”

“Mr. Peters, I just explained to you that it upsets me because it is a campaign of intentional infantilisa–”

“No, no, no,” says Mr. Peters. “That’s not it at all. It bothers you because *you let it* bother you. If you were in second grade, sure, I’d agree that all these bullies are being *so mean* and that you deserve a popsicle and a big hug from mommy. But guess what, kid. You ain’t in second grade, and you’re whining about this because deep down, you prefer being a victim to being a man.”

That weird feeling that I get from talking to Mr. Peters is back, but it’s a lot worse this time because Mr. Peters is right. I’m quiet for a really long time (it’s not actually that long of a time, just twenty seconds or so, but it’s a much longer amount of time than the amount of time you’re supposed to be quiet during counseling, because counseling is a place you’re always supposed to be talking).

“So what do you want, Colin?” says Mr. Peters. “From counseling, from school? What do you want to get from all this?”

“I don’t know,” I say, looking down at the rubbing-couch. I didn’t want to do counseling, I’m only here because my mom and Principal Gildseth and Vice Principal Dwinel are making me do it. “Nothing.” I think tears are starting to form around my eyes. “I just want everyone to leave me alone.”

“No, that’s not it,” says Mr. Peters. Why is he asking me so many questions if he’s just going to tell me I’m wrong when I answer them? “You want what you don’t have. Respect, control. Well guess what, bud? Those things aren’t free. You want dignity? You want the respect of your classmates? Well, you’re gonna have to take it. Quit your crying and straighten your back.”

I keep looking down at the couch.

“***WHAT DID I SAY***?” Peters snarls suddenly, and I do as he says and straighten my back and I stop crying. Mr. Peters chuckles. “See?” he says. “That’s what respect looks like.”

As I leave the office, Mr. Peters has pulled out the big folder that they give to my mom at the end of every quarter so that he can write a bunch of stuff in it. And Maya is supposed to be here when I get out of counseling with Mr. Peters because she knows that that’s one of the times when I need a friend the most but she’s not here and I have nothing to do but start to walk back to my locker so I can finally get a pencil so I can bring it to social studies.

Maya’s by Katie Schumacher’s locker as I pass, and for just a little moment I think she catches my eye but before she or I can say anything or even really gesture a swarm of kids comes up to me and I start walking away because I don’t want to look like a cookie-liking baby in front of Maya and by the time I’ve finished assuring everybody how much I like cookies she’s gone. 

…

I’m trying to hide my face behind my shoulder as I make my way towards the exit at the end of the day but it doesn’t work because my face is much bigger than my shoulder.

“Colin!” I hear behind me, and I think about hiding my head even further into my shoulder, not because it’s a mean kid asking whether I like cookies, but because it’s Maya. “What’s up, man?” she says as she pulls up beside me. Why is she acting like she hasn’t been neglecting me all day?

“Where were you today?” I say.

“What do you mean?” she says. “I was here, at school.” She knows damn well what I mean.

“You weren’t hanging out with me. I needed a lot of help today, and you weren’t there,” I say.

“I mean, I was with my other friends,” says Maya. “I can’t be around all the time, I got other stuff going on. So like, as I was saying about what would happen if Guerilla Pegasus was gifted the Truth Emerald instead of the Love Ruby is she–”

“No!” I say. I don’t want to hear more about *Star Hero Cassiopeia* until I know what’s going on. “Shut up! Do you know what I’ve been through today?”

She gives me a look of genuine confusion, but how could she possibly be confused? “I’m sorry, Colin. I didn’t think–”

“You didn’t think? Of course you didn’t think.”

“I didn’t think you needed me to be your *mommy*,” says Maya. “What, you lost your pencils again? I can’t spend one day hanging out with my other friends without worrying about you breaking down? Are you my friend, who I want to spend time with because I have fun with you, or are you just a kid I have to take care of? You know, you could’ve come up and talked to me at any point today.”

“And then what? I’d get to be friends with Brad and TJ and Katie and all the other kids who get their kicks tormenting me for sport? Really cool of you that those are your friends.”

“Colin, if you think I wouldn't have stuck up for you, then what do you even think about us? About our friendship? Have you considered that maybe if I’m popular, and we’re friends, then maybe it wouldn’t be the popular thing to pick on you? It could be good for you for me to reconnect with my friends.”

“Oh, it will be so good for me to watch you and TJ Feyerhaus making out underneath the bleachers,” I say.

“What?” Maya laughs. “Are you jealous? Do you think I’m *cuuuuuute*, Colin Hannigan?” She elongates the “cute” in a teasing voice and she teases me sometimes in a nice way but I don’t think this is meant to be nice teasing.

“No, I–”

“No? Really? You don’t?” she says, and she knows what she’s doing, she’s making me feel confused and flustered so that my feelings get hurt, and I’m getting very very mad. “And no, I'm not going to make out with TJ Feyerhaus. Brad, on the other hand, asked me to see *Batman Begins* with him, as a date, and I said yes, so–”

I start to walk away, towards the exit.

“You’re being a jerk!” Maya yells. “I just want to be your friend, and you gotta go be all pissy about it.” I’m not listening, I’m still just walking away. “Hey! Hannigan!” Maya shouts again. “YA LIKE COOKIES?”

Do I like cookies? Do I like cookies, Maya? No! How about I ask you a question, huh!?

***BANG***

*Do you like cookies, Maya? Do you like cookies, you cookie-liking baby? What about the people who spend all day devising ways to make my time in this hell extra miserable? Do you like them, Maya?* 

***BANG***

*They're your friends? What, you miss attending the little meetings where you all figure out how you're gonna torture me today? You wanna make out with them, Smokin’ Maya Meyer? IS THAT IT?!* 

***BANG***

*I’M NOT A BABY AND* ***I DON’T LIKE COOKIES!!***

Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. 

Maya, are you okay? I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, Maya, I didn’t mean to. It wasn't me, it was the tantrum. You gotta believe me, I would never hurt you. Maya, come back, I'm sorry, we’re still friends, right?

Maya? We’re sharing the dream, remember? It's just a bad dream, it's just a nightmare, and we’re gonna wake up one day. We’re gonna wake up.

Eyes bruised and mouth bleeding, Maya crawls backwards away from on the floor.

“Get the *fuck* away from me!” she screams.

Everyone's gathering around, and they're supposed to all be laughing because I'm having a tantrum, but no one is laughing. Brad kneels on the floor and holds Maya in his arms as she sobs and bleeds all over his shirt.

Mr. Dwinel is here and he grabs me by the arm and pulls me away, and I don't fight him. Officer Williams meets us in the hallway and tells me has to put me in handcuffs as he puts handcuffs on me.

“Mr. Dwinel, Officer Williams, I have a really bad stomach ache,” I say.

“Miss Meyer has far worse than a stomach ache,” says Mr. Dwinel. “Consider yourself lucky you're not her.”

But I'm not sure if that's true because the stomach ache is really bad. I keel over on the ground, and I feel big hands ripping apart my abdomen from the inside, and I scream as Philip claws his way out of my gut, and he lets me bleed pitifully out on the floor as he goes about doing his thing.

Bloodstripe dreamstalker spider 

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

The **bloodstripe dreamstalker spider** (***Epiales erpysmou***) is a venomous spider. It is a large dreamstalker spider found exclusively in Greenwood Middle School in Greenwood, Wisconsin. Although their relatively small population would suggest they are an endangered species, they are not recognized on any endangered species lists because they are not in danger.

Adult bloodstripe dreamstalkers are milky white with a thin red stripe along their torso. Male dreamstalkers are between 2 inches (51 mm) and 70 inches (1778 mm) with legs spread and can be identified by a distinct pointy stinger below the abdomen. No female bloodstripe dreamstalker has ever been identified. While stingers on wasps, bees, and ants serve the purpose of defense, the purpose of the stinger of the male dreamstalker appears to be for the spider’s enjoyment and fun. 

Though dreamstalker venom (delivered via the stinger, not fangs, as is the case with other spiders) is not fatal, some victims have been known to experience symptoms of spider flu^((citation needed)). If you are experiencing symptoms of spider flu, don’t go to the nurse’s office. They’re going to make you fill out a lot of paperwork, and it’s really boring.

Bloodstripe dreamstalkers live mostly in dry areas, such as bookshelves, though they also seem to enjoy moistness. They typically eat houseflies, though they are also known to hunger for a woman’s supple touch (1). While dreamstalkers often appear to be immobile or sleeping, the spider is actually hunting, always.

Though all other known arthropods have a hard exoskeleton composed of chitin and protein (1), the bloodstripe dreamstalker’s outer layer is identical to human skin in every way except coloration. Their methods of reproduction are deeply unpleasant. The life expectancy of a dreamstalker spider is twenty-four years (so far). 

Those who see a bloodstripe dreamstalker spider are advised to show it empathy, even if it doesn’t deserve it. After all, they’re people too.

The young woman who had been identified as Sarah Wayland had been moved into a private room. Sheriff Weston had been called while a doctor and Nurse Mailey checked her out. Sheriff Weston asked that Nathan remain at the hospital for questioning. Another hour and a half had gone by as the sun had finally taken its place fully illuminating the sky. Nathan watched as nurses holding reusable coffee cups and tired expressions walked through the hallways preparing to start or leave their shifts. A woman wearing a gray, long, thick knitted cardigan over a green turtle neck and jeans who looked to be in her late '40s or early '50s frantically ran down the hall. Nathan didn't have to know her to know her. 

Besides the dark brown curls with subtle streaks of gray that bounced on her shoulders, everything else was Sarah but older. This woman had to be her mother. Nathan stood up straight but remained silent as the woman stopped at the door of the room. She lifted her purse higher on her narrow shoulder before inhaling deeply. She lifted a  quivering fist to the door and knocked. Nurse Mailey opened the door after the second beat and they locked eyes speaking in silence. Nurse Mailey moved to the side as the woman slowly walked in. Nathan rushed over and quietly caught the heavy door before it could fully close. He left a small crack and peeked in. 

The woman walked slowly towards the bed where the young woman sat quietly. The doctor stood beside the bed silent. The woman burst into sobs, her body shook as she spoke. Her voice was also soft but deeper than her daughter's. 

""Sarah...My baby...Sarah.""

She rubbed Sarah's face gently. Sarah looked at the woman, a sparkle of recognition suddenly hitting her blue eyes.

""Mama?"" She said softly. 

""Yes baby! It's Mama!"" The woman wept. 

Nathan felt a sudden lump in his throat and the sting of tears welling in his eyes. A sudden firm grip on his right shoulder made him jump. He quietly closed the door before turning around where he came face to face with Sheriff Weston, a tall, broad shouldered, pasty, potbellied man in his late fifties, and Deputy Angus a much younger, shorter man whose uniform looked as if it was wearing him instead of the other way around. 

""Deputy Angus, go on in and start the questioning process please."" Sheriff Weston instructed while narrowing his eyes at Nathan. 

Deputy Angus shook his head and walked into the room, taking off his black brim hat. Nathan watched as the door closed before turning back around to face Sheriff Weston who tapped the gun at his side. 

""I got some questions to ask you boy."" He said sternly. 

""Excuse me... Boy? Sir, I'm 28."" Nathan responded. 

""I don't care how old you are BOY. All I care about is what were you doing with a young lady that's been missing nearly three years?"" He asked agressively. 

""Sir, I just saw her walking on the bridge in the cold and drove her here. That's all."" Nathan responded remaining calm. 

""Well I find it concerning how you came from your BIG CITY and suddenly Ms. Wayland shows up in your custody, confused...""

""I have cameras."" Nathan interrupted. 

""What ""cameras""?""

""Cameras in my car... Inward and outward facing. I was a ride share driver on weekends in that ""Big City"" I came from. For my protection I installed cameras in my car. You can have a copy of the recording from earlier when I FOUND Ms. Wayland on the bridge."" Nathan responded smiling tightly. 

Sheriff Weston snarled and lowered his hand from his side. 

""Bring that recording to the station today when you come to make an official, documented statement. Make sure it ain't been tampered with."" 

""Sure thing Sheriff."" Nathan responded. 

Sheriff Weston stared at Nathan's thick, shoulder length hair, tan skin and striking facial features.

""What are you anyway, some kind of Hispanic?"" Sheriff Weston asked smugly. 

Nathan took a deep breath as blood rushed to his cheeks. ""I'm biracial. Are we done here?""

Deputy Angus returned to the hallway before Sheriff Weston could respond to Nathan's relief. 

""It's her Sheriff, the Wayland girl. She remembers who she is now but not where she's been... She was wearing the same dress she was reported wearing when she went missing in that summer..."" He said looking disconcerted 

""Well can we still question her?"" Sheriff Weston asked. 

""The doctor said she's probably dealing with some kind of trauma response. Wants us to come back later..."" He said solemnly. 

""Alright then. Boy, don't you hang around here disturbing them."" Sheriff Weston demanded looking angrily at Nathan. 

""The girls mom wants to meet him Sir."" Deputy Angus interjected. 

Nathan took a few minutes after Sheriff Weston and Deputy Angus left to cool down. He had been in the town just two months and had already experienced multiple invidious attitudes by some of the older people like Sheriff Weston. He understood he looked and talked differently. He was tan, tall, nonconformist with the occasional man-bun. Certainly not the buttoned up, small town, all American look that most others had or expected, however, they all lived in the present and not 60 years ago. He hoped attitudes would have changed... Still, most were polite, nosy but polite and the town was a reset. ""Boring and predictable,"" he reminded himself. 

He entered the room after the doctor and nurse Mailey left out. He noticed Sarah wasn't in her bed and that the bathroom door was shut.

""Are you the one that found my Sarah?!"" The woman asked. 

Nathan shook his head and Sarah's mom ran to him, embraced him tightly. His body instinctively went stiff for a few seconds as he wasn't expecting it. The woman's hair smelled of rose shampoo, her clothes of fabric softener. Her hug was warm and surprisingly comforting. He hugged her back though it felt awkward, yet strangely familiar. She pulled back and stared at him in the eyes. 

""Sarah said a handsome stranger found her...God, I can't thank you enough."" She whispered softly. 

""Ma'am, I just gave her a ride here. I'm glad I was able to help reunite you with your daughter though...""

In the bathroom Sarah stood staring at herself in the small, smudged filled mirror blankly. She smiled widely before letting her mouth drop. 

""I'm Sarah...I'm Sarah Wayland..."" She repeated in a whisper to herself. 

She blinked rapidly as her pupils dilated, and her iris's turned a deep onyx. The color lasted half a second before returning to a piercing steel blue. She smiled wide again at her reflection.

1p2ap4n,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1p2ap4n/something_is_wrong_with_sarah_part_two/,Something Is Wrong With Sarah Part Two,"""Goddammit."" Nathan muttered quietly as he crossed his arms and leaned back against the cream colored hallway walls of the hospital. 

The young woman who had been identified as Sarah Wayland had been moved into a private room. Sheriff Weston had been called while a doctor and Nurse Mailey checked her out. Sheriff Weston asked that Nathan remain at the hospital for questioning. Another hour and a half had gone by as the sun had finally taken its place fully illuminating the sky. Nathan watched as nurses holding reusable coffee cups and tired expressions walked through the hallways preparing to start or leave their shifts. A woman wearing a gray, long, thick knitted cardigan over a green turtle neck and jeans who looked to be in her late '40s or early '50s frantically ran down the hall. Nathan didn't have to know her to know her. 

Besides the dark brown curls with subtle streaks of gray that bounced on her shoulders, everything else was Sarah but older. This woman had to be her mother. Nathan stood up straight but remained silent as the woman stopped at the door of the room. She lifted her purse higher on her narrow shoulder before inhaling deeply. She lifted a quivering fist to the door and knocked. Nurse Mailey opened the door after the second beat and  they locked eyes speaking in silence. Nurse Mailey moved to the side as the woman slowly walked in. Nathan rushed over and quietly caught the heavy door before it could fully close. He left a small crack and peeked in. 

The woman walked slowly towards the bed where the young woman sat quietly. The doctor stood beside the bed silent. The woman burst into sobs, her body shook as she spoke. Her voice was also soft but deeper than her daughter's. 

""Sarah...My baby...Sarah.""

She rubbed Sarah's face gently. Sarah looked at the woman, a sparkle of recognition suddenly hitting her blue eyes.

""Mama?"" She said softly. 

""Yes baby! It's Mama!"" The woman wept. 

Nathan felt a sudden lump in his throat and the sting of tears welling in his eyes. A sudden firm grip on his right shoulder made him jump. He quietly closed the door before turning around where he came face to face with Sheriff Weston, a tall, broad shouldered, pasty, potbellied man in his late fifties, and Deputy Angus a much younger, shorter man whose uniform looked as if it was wearing him instead of the other way around. 

""Deputy Angus, go on in and start the questioning process please."" Sheriff Weston instructed while narrowing his eyes at Nathan. 

Deputy Angus shook his head and walked into the room, taking off his black brim hat. Nathan watched as the door closed before turning back around to face Sheriff Weston who tapped the gun at his side. 

""I got some questions to ask you boy."" He said sternly. 

""Excuse me... Boy? Sir, I'm 28."" Nathan responded. 

""I don't care how old you are BOY. All I care about is what were you doing with a young lady that's been missing nearly three years?"" He asked agressively. 

""Sir, I just saw her walking on the bridge in the cold and drove her here. That's all."" Nathan responded remaining calm. 

""Well I find it concerning how you came from your BIG CITY and suddenly Ms. Wayland shows up in your custody, confused...""

""I have cameras."" Nathan interrupted. 

""What ""cameras""?""

""Cameras in my car... Inward and outward facing. I was a ride share driver on weekends in that ""Big City"" I came from. For my protection I installed cameras in my car. You can have a copy of the recording from earlier when I FOUND Ms. Wayland on the bridge."" Nathan responded smiling tightly. 

Sheriff Weston snarled and lowered his hand from his side. 

""Bring that recording to the station today when you come to make an official, documented statement. Make sure it ain't been tampered with."" 

""Sure thing Sheriff."" Nathan responded. 

Sheriff Weston stared at Nathan's thick, shoulder length hair, tan skin and striking facial features.

""What are you anyway, some kind of Hispanic?"" Sheriff Weston asked smugly.

Real results no bs,"I've struggled with portion control and constant hunger for years and tried every diet trick people recommend. Finally decided to actually test different appetite suppressants systematically to see if any of them work or if it's all just marketing. Here's what I found.

Garcinia cambogia pills (6 weeks) Cost around $25 a month. Everyone hyped these up a few years ago as this miracle weight loss thing. I took them exactly as directed for 6 weeks and noticed absolutely zero difference in hunger or cravings. Complete waste of money in my experience. Maybe it works for some people but did nothing for me.

Glucomannan capsules (6 weeks) Fiber supplement that's supposed to expand in your stomach. Cost about $15 a month. This one actually did help a little bit with feeling full, but I had to take like 6 pills with tons of water and it was annoying. They also gave me some digestive issues. The concept works but the execution was not great for daily use. Still, would recommended this.

Ozzi fiber drink mix (currently 10 weeks in) About $70 a month which is a good bit more expensive than the others. It contains konjac fiber, allulose, chromium and some other ingredients. This one actually makes a noticeable difference in my appetite especially evening cravings. It's not magic and I still have to make good food choices, but it helps. Since it’s a mix of different things, I’m honestly not sure which of these ingredients are actually doing something and which ones are just there to look pretty on the label, but something in there works.

Green tea extract pills (6 weeks) Around $20 a month. Marketed for metabolism and appetite. Mostly just made me jittery from the caffeine but it did make me less hungry but I think thats just the way caffeine works. Thats also why a lot of appetite suppressants have caffeine in them. So it works, but so does coffee or energy drinks, at least for me. So if you just want that effect, I don’t really see the point of getting these pills specifically. Also, this is not suitable for every time of the day, so if you need something for evening or nightly binge eating habits, this won’t fix it.

My honest conclusion is that most appetite suppressants are either bs or they exaggerate a lot. Out of the four I tested only one made a real difference that I could actually notice in my daily life but it is also kinda expensive. Fiber and caffeine sort of work too but they’re limited in usability.

If you're going to try an appetite suppressant, look for one with ingredients that have actual studies behind them, not just random herbs that sound exotic. And don't expect miracles, the best they can do is make hunger more manageable while you do the real work of eating less and moving more. Sorry if that sounds a bit harsh but it’s my honest opinion.",7,1763662969.0,WeightLossAdvice,4,0.77,False

Procrastination isn't a character flaw—it's a neurobiological battle between your limbic system and prefrontal cortex. Use these 5 science-backed biohacks to win: the 5-Minute Rule, environment optimization, neurofeedback training, cold exposure, and sleep management. All grounded in peer-reviewed neuroscience.

# The Science of ""Why Later?"": Biohacking Your Brain's Resistance

Procrastination is often dismissed as laziness or poor time management. But modern neuroscience reveals something far more interesting: it's a battle waged in your brain between two key regions—the limbic system and the prefrontal cortex (PFC).

The limbic system is your ancient, emotional brain. It's focused on immediate comfort and reward. When faced with a difficult task, it screams: ""Avoid the pain! Do something fun now!"" This is called temporal discounting—your brain prioritizes a small, immediate reward (scrolling social media) over a larger, delayed reward (finishing your project).

The prefrontal cortex is the seat of willpower, discipline, and executive function. It's your rational planner, capable of long-term thinking and emotional regulation. Procrastination happens when the limbic system overpowers the PFC.

The key to overcoming it isn't brute-force willpower—it's strategically strengthening your PFC and managing your limbic system's demands. In other words: biohacking your willpower.

# The Dopamine Dilemma: Rewiring Your Motivation

Dopamine is central to this internal conflict. It's not just the ""pleasure"" molecule—it's the ""seeking"" or ""motivation"" molecule. Procrastination is a form of emotional regulation. You're trying to avoid the negative feelings associated with starting a task.

When you procrastinate, you seek a quick dopamine hit from an easy activity (checking email, eating a snack). This reinforces the procrastination loop. The biohacker's goal: decouple dopamine from distraction and re-link it to productive effort.

# Biohack 1: The ""5-Minute Rule"" and Task Initiation

The hardest part of any task is starting.

The ""5-Minute Rule"" is simple but powerful: commit to working on the task for just 5 minutes. This tricks your limbic system into lowering its guard. Once you start, your PFC often takes over, and the momentum of the task itself provides a small, immediate reward—releasing a dopamine burst that encourages continuation.

How to apply it:

•Set a timer for 5 minutes

•Commit to working only for that duration

•Notice how momentum builds after you start

•Continue if you feel engaged (most people do)

# Biohack 2: Environment Optimization

Your environment is a powerful external factor that influences your internal state. A cluttered, distracting environment drains your PFC's limited resources.

|Strategy|Action|Why It Works|
|Digital Detox|Use website blockers or ""Do Not Disturb"" modes|Reduces external cues that trigger limbic system's desire for immediate reward|
|Clutter Control|Maintain a clean, dedicated workspace|Minimizes cognitive load, freeing up PFC resources|
|Anchor Habits|Pair difficult task with enjoyable habit (e.g., coffee)|Leverages established neural pathways to reduce task friction|

# Biohack 3: Neurofeedback and Cognitive Training

For those serious about cognitive enhancement, neurofeedback offers a way to directly train your brain's activity patterns. By providing real-time feedback on brainwave activity, you can learn to increase activity in the prefrontal cortex—effectively strengthening your ""willpower muscle.""

Check out FitOnear's comprehensive guide: [Neurofeedback & Brain Training: Rewiring Your Brain for Peak Performance](https://fitonear.com/brain-focus/) for a deep dive into advanced cognitive training techniques.

This isn't science fiction. Studies show that consistent neurofeedback training can measurably improve focus, impulse control, and the ability to resist procrastination.

# Biohack 4: The Power of Cold Exposure

Exposure to cold—whether a cold shower or ice bath—is a potent biohack for discipline. The initial shock requires an immediate, conscious override of your limbic system's desire for comfort. This practice acts as a PFC workout, improving your ability to exert self-control in other areas of your life.

Additionally, cold exposure increases norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter that enhances focus and attention. You get a dual benefit: strengthened willpower + boosted cognitive performance.

Stanford neuroscientist Andrew Huberman has documented how cold exposure can improve dopamine levels and enhance focus for hours after exposure.

Getting started:

•Start with 30 seconds of cold water at the end of your shower

•Gradually increase duration as you adapt

•Aim for consistency 3-4 times per week

•Notice improvements in focus and willpower within 2-3 weeks

# Biohack 5: Sleep and Energy Management

Willpower is a finite resource, heavily dependent on your physical state. Sleep deprivation severely impairs PFC function, making you more susceptible to immediate gratification.

Prioritizing high-quality sleep is arguably the most fundamental biohack for discipline. When you sleep well, your PFC functions optimally, making it easier to resist temptation and maintain focus.

For advanced sleep optimization strategies, explore FitOnear's guide: [The Sleep Advantage: Biohacking Your Way to Faster Fitness Recovery and Growth](https://fitonear.com/sleep-rhythm/)

Sleep optimization tips:

•Aim for 7-9 hours of consistent sleep per night

•Maintain a regular sleep schedule (same bedtime/wake time)

•Keep your bedroom cool (65-68°F), dark, and quiet

•Avoid screens 1 hour before bedtime

# How These Biohacks Work Together

These five biohacks don't work in isolation—they work synergistically:

1.Sleep optimization provides the foundation by ensuring your PFC is functioning optimally

2.Environment optimization reduces cognitive load, preserving your limited willpower resources

3.The 5-Minute Rule reduces the perceived threat of task initiation

4.Cold exposure acts as a PFC workout, strengthening your willpower muscle

5.Neurofeedback directly trains your brain for improved executive function

When combined, these strategies create a comprehensive system for overcoming procrastination at the neurobiological level.

# The Bottom Line

Procrastination is universal, but it doesn't have to be permanent. By understanding the underlying neuroscience—the battle between your limbic system and prefrontal cortex—you can stop fighting yourself and start biohacking your brain.

Discipline is not a trait you're born with; it's a skill you cultivate through strategic effort.

Start small. Optimize your environment. Manage your dopamine. Use the 5-Minute Rule and cold exposure. Build the mental acuity and willpower you need to achieve your most important goals.

It was a warm, necessary ritual to kickstart my brain. The most complex thought I had about it was 'Did I add too much sugar?' I saw a simple, brown liquid in a mug, and that was that. Honestly, it was a simpler time.

Then came the university physics courses. I spent years wrestling with concepts that felt totally abstract. Thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, entropy... they were all just numbers and equations in a textbook. I passed the tests, but it never really felt *real*. It was just academic stuff you memorized. The magic wasn't there yet. I thought it never would be.

The 'click' didn't happen in a lab or during a final exam. It happened on a random Tuesday, while I was tiredly stirring my coffee. I watched the little whirlpool form, and suddenly, the floodgates opened. That wasn't just a swirl of coffee and cream; it was a vortex, a tiny, perfect example of fluid dynamics, governed by the same principles that create hurricanes and shape galaxies. The steam rising wasn't just steam; it was a visible ghost of energy, a story of water molecules getting so agitated they achieved escape velocity from the liquid.

The mug itself became an insulator, fighting a losing battle against the Second Law of Thermodynamics. My coffee was on a relentless, cosmic mission to reach thermal equilibrium with the room, and the ceramic was its only defense. The whole scene transformed from a mundane morning routine into this beautiful, intricate dance of invisible forces. It was like I could suddenly see the source code of reality.

It's a blessing and a curse, I guess. I can't see anything as 'simple' anymore. Everything is a complex, interconnected system. But it also means I find a sense of absolute wonder in the most boring, everyday things. So, Reddit, my question to you is: has learning about a specific subject ever completely changed the way you see a mundane object?",1,1763662677.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False
