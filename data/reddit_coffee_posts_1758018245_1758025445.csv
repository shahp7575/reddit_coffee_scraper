1nifwkc,https://www.reddit.com/r/IReadBannedBooks/comments/1nifwkc/what_is_the_purpose_of_life_here_it_is/,what is the purpose of life ? here it is!,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1nift1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1nift1f/why_choose_the_pentair_everpure_h300_cartridge/,Why Choose the Pentair Everpure H-300 Cartridge Review for Superior Water Filtration?,"The Pentair Everpure H-300 Quick-Change Filter Cartridge, EV927072, has been a game-changer in my household‚Äôs water filtration setup. This product combines commercial-grade performance with streamlined usability, making it ideal for home use. Having tested this cartridge over the past few months, I‚Äôve found it incredibly reliable for delivering cleaner, better-tasting water. Whether preparing food, filling up a tumbler for my workout, or even for my morning coffee, it‚Äôs become an essential part of daily life. Yet, like any product out there, it has its upsides and a few things you should know before jumping on board.

**Exceptional Filtration Performance**  
Right from the first use, the quality of the water was noticeably different. The cartridge‚Äôs ability to filter out particles as small as 0.5 microns is impressive. It effectively removes chlorine taste and odor, VOCs, lead, and other impurities. The NSF certifications ensure that it meets high standards of water purification, which offers great peace of mind. I even tested the water with a TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) meter, and the difference compared to unfiltered tap water was staggering. This is especially vital in homes where water quality might be questionable, like mine.  

[Find the best price for Pentair Everpure H-300 Quick-Change Filter Cartridge, EV927072 on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b0002jvwsi/)

**Ease of Installation and Use**  
This is where the Everpure H-300 shines. Installing the cartridge under my sink was a breeze, thanks to the quick-change feature. It also has a built-in shut-off valve, which meant I didn‚Äôt have to deal with shutting off the water supply separately when replacing the cartridge. The cartridge weighs only 2.5 pounds and fits snugly into its housing without taking up much kitchen space. What‚Äôs more, it‚Äôs designed to filter up to 300 gallons of water, which calculates roughly to about six months for my family‚Äôs usage‚Äîfar better than other options I‚Äôve tried in the past.

**Durability and Build Quality**  
The aluminum exterior of this cartridge isn‚Äôt just for show. I once accidentally knocked the housing with a kitchen utensil while rearranging some items, and it handled the bump without so much as a scratch. Its sturdy design ensures the filter won‚Äôt burst or split, which is a fear I‚Äôve had with some of the plastic options on the market. Plus, since it‚Äôs made in the USA, there's an added layer of trust in its quality.

**Upsides**  
- Great at removing chlorine, lead, microplastics, and VOCs.  
- Strong aluminum casing ensures durability.  
- Quick and hassle-free cartridge replacements.  
- Filters the equivalent of 2,250 water bottles, saving money in the long run.  

**Pitfalls**  
- Cannot filter hot water; it‚Äôs strictly for cold water use.  
- The initial setup instructions could‚Äôve been clearer for more novice users.  
- Expensive for some households compared to basic pitcher filters.  

**Alternative Products**  
While the Everpure H-300 excels in providing high-quality filtration, a few competitors are worth mentioning. The Brita Tap Faucet filter is a more affordable choice, though it lacks NSF-certified filtering for VOCs and lead removal. Reverse osmosis systems like the APEC ROES-50 offer superior filtration but come at higher installation and maintenance costs, not to mention they require additional space. For someone who doesn‚Äôt want the complexity of RO systems yet needs thorough filtration, I‚Äôd still lean toward this Everpure cartridge.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
Price-wise, the cartridge does land on the premium side. However, factoring in its 300-gallon capacity and the contaminants it filters out, it‚Äôs an investment that more than earns its keep. Using fewer bottled waters alone offset some costs in my case, not to mention the benefits of cooking with cleaner water. If quality is a priority, this cartridge is absolutely worth it.

We talked a lot about companies. But now let‚Äôs talk about you, the remote professional.

Starting remote work thinking it is just about opening a laptop and typing is not how it works. It requires a change of mindset, body, and routine.

If you are over 30 and most of your career has been on-site, your body and brain need adaptation. That means adjusting habits, routines, and preparing physically and mentally to really enjoy the advantages of remote work.

Some essential points:

1. Workspace
Create a dedicated space, even if small, to separate ‚Äúbeing home‚Äù from ‚Äúbeing at work.‚Äù
Make sure your family understands that being at home does not mean being 100 percent available.

2. Living alone vs. living with family
Living alone: watch out for social isolation, stay active.
Living with family/spouse/kids: set clear rules, explain to children when interruptions are acceptable.

3. Routine and discipline
Define clear start, break, and end times. Do not fall into the trap of being always available.
Take real breaks for coffee, lunch, and rest.

4. Physical and mental health
Take care of your diet: avoid extremes.
Include physical activity.
Keep social life and leisure balanced.

Remote work is not just a change of location. It is a life change. Companies need to adapt, but so do we as professionals.",0,1758024811.0,remotework,0,0.5,False

We've worked on the house a lot and it's a lot better than it was.  The project of ""making it livable"" was a big distraction and project during that time. Now it's calmed down a bit, but it is still far too much stuff for me everywhere. My partner is not a hoarder (maybe a little when left to his own devices...) but he doesn't like me throwing useful things away. He also wants to sell every things where possible instead of donating, so the process is really slow. He's an introverted project guy and he never really demands anything of me. He's a good guy.

I am at a point where every day I feel stressed by the stuff around me. It's too big, too much stuff and too many chores every morning to feel ""on top"" enough. I feel resentful because my partner doesn't help me with this at the level I would like, but listen he's a really decent guy who tries, so I am certain this is a mostly me problem and a little incompatibility between us. It just feels like the amount of things close in on me and it's a constant battle trying to find neat solutions for storing. I honestly just want to start fresh so badly because our home feels never-ending and it terrifies me. I am burnt out.

I was curious to hear if anyone actually moved out from their partner to start their own small minimalist apartment to live in whilst staying in their relationship? And if so, did your relationship feel better? I worry for me this fantasy is just that, chasing after this minimalist lifestyle that really won't solve my problems in the end. But I can't help but wonder if it might at least make my life feel easier to manage? I just can't stop dreaming about my own little space with hardly any stuff, really simple and easy, and in the town too so I can walk to my favorite coffee shop every morning. I could still be at my partners and cook us nice meals and we could plan evenings and weekends together. We might almost do more fun stuff this way cause at the moment if we're both home, we don't really priorotise it, there's always something else?

I want to emphasize that I am aware this is a me problem and not my partner but, should I make this accommodation for myself or do I need to learn harder to accommodate? I do have some more intensive therapy starting soon to help but I was curious to hear from anyone who may relate to me.

I‚Äôm aiming to break into private equity. I started out pre-med in college but pivoted to business. Instead of extending school, I finished my degree and spent every free moment studying finance: personal finance, real estate, 10-Ks, balance sheets, industries, all of it.

I went into med device sales since it was lucrative and closer to the type of business I wanted to be in. I‚Äôve built strong skills in prospecting, cold outreach, and deal origination. I genuinely love learning, chasing deals, and helping people make money.

Lately I‚Äôve been reaching out directly to VPs and CEOs, cold calling my way into conversations, but I‚Äôm still trying to figure out the right next steps into PE. I‚Äôd even be willing to take a pay cut if it meant being in the right rooms and learning the business from the ground up.

If you met me for coffee, what practical, actionable steps would you recommend for someone like me to break into PE?",0,1758024509.0,private_equity,1,0.5,False

The day to travel to Quizbar soon arrived.

Olyrean was a little forlorn when it did. She had spent most of her life in the same tree-home as an elf, and she felt that she had just barely gotten settled into her new home in America before the time came to leave again. She would be coming back, of course, once her mission was finished, but she could not help but feel that sort of strange detachment of travel, the sensation of homelessness, as she set out.

She bade a fond farewell to Baxter, and even to her little robotic vacuum and her curtains and her shower and coffee grinder, and all of the dozens of other AIs that took care of her home. She had never realized just how many of them there were before. They had faded into the background of her life.

‚ÄúWhat will you do while I am away?‚Äù she asked her robot, as he helped carry her bags to her bubble-car.

‚ÄúI expect much the same thing that I do while you‚Äôre here, just much easier,‚Äù said Baxter. ‚ÄúWhat without you inviting bugs over to make cocoons on your couch or lizards to shed scales on your bed and all. Otherwise I will be sleeping in my storage closet, to conserve energy.‚Äù

Olyrean did her best to pretend she hadn‚Äôt heard this. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to do that, you know. It‚Äôs not like charging you is breaking my bank. Isn‚Äôt there anything you‚Äôd‚Ä¶well, that you‚Äôd¬†*like*¬†to do?‚Äù

Baxter considered this, for a moment, pursing the lips of his troublingly handsome false face in a manner that Olyrean desperately tried to not think of as kissable. ‚ÄúWellllllll,‚Äù he said at last, ‚ÄúThe washing machine and I have been discussing some optimizations to our chore routines‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúOh?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. If you‚Äôd just let us tinker with the laundry chute. It delivers your dirty clothes so slowly, you see. I‚Äôm sure it could be optimized. Tremendous potential for saving time.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou want to optimize a¬†*hole in the wall?*‚Äù Olyrean shook her head. ‚ÄúNo, no, that‚Äôs fine. Do whatever you‚Äôd like, Baxter.‚Äù

She hugged him very briefly, and then pressed her way through the bubble-car‚Äôs skin. This time, she would not be heading toward the Accident. The teleportation facilities were located far away from the city.

Far away from everything, really, though the reason for this was very stupid.

\*\*\*

Traveling through the universe is a dangerous proposition.

Most sentient species discovered this problem early on in their development. Travel usually involves an awful lot of spent energy and possible danger that could be avoided entirely just by staying in bed. This led some otherwise intelligent species to give up on the whole idea altogether.

Like, for example, the Huklavee, a clever yet timid species of tree-rats that lived entirely within one small forest on their home planet. They lived pleasant little lives inside comfortable little burrows, and even had pleasantly boring literature that extolled the nice, small virtues of the humble life and putting one's own house in order and doing the best with what one has been given. They did pretty well for themselves for a few thousand years before a herd of giant Brudmatta, giant oxlike herbivores each roughly ten thousand times the size of your average Huklavee, decided they‚Äôd like a snack, devoured their forest, and destroyed their entire civilization.

Those Huklavee who were not trampled while fleeing the gigantic beast‚Äôs rapacious appetites died of exposure. The last Huklavee spent his life in lonely solitude, the last member of his species in existence. After years of meditation he got over the terrible anger he had over the death of his people, coming to see it as a cosmic inevitability. He penned a missive about the great tragedy of it all, roughly titled¬†*The Huklaveeriad: How I Forgave Our Transgressors,*¬†which was lost to time when a passing Brudmatta took a liking to the paper it was written on and ate that too.

Fortunately, justice was served a mere two thousand, nine hundred and thirty-seven years later, when the Huklavee were avenged by a continent-sized meteor crashing into the planet, obliterating the Brudmatta along with all other life on the surface.

The Huklavee had failed to recognize that refusing to travel was often, in the long term, as dangerous as travel itself was.

We might take the example of another, more enterprising species, chosen entirely at random: humans. Humans found occasion to travel for many reasons, but one of the most prominent was getting away from other humans whom they didn‚Äôt like very much. They tried alternative solutions, like killing the other humans, but this involved a lot of effort in itself and came with the unfortunate drawback that other humans started to kill them back and, if they weren‚Äôt exactly experts at the matter, they could be pretty nasty about it.

Being forced to put up with the inconvenience of travel led most species to innovate to try to ease the burden. For most, prior to their first industrial revolution, these efforts could be broadly summarized as:

1. The wheel
2. Getting someone else to do the traveling for you.

It was this second part that caused a lot of trouble, and usually involved wrangling with very large animals who would be varying shades of confused and annoyed to find a much smaller animal clambering all over it, poking it with a sharp stick, and going ‚ÄúHyah!‚Äù This led to a lot of misery and heartbreak and, more specifically, trampling deaths, until it was puzzled out how to replace big dumb animals with big dumb machines, and finally people could move away from the primitive brutality of livestock domestication and get on with the much more civilized business of running each other over.

Now, an advanced society like the UWA often still used this same basic sort of technology, with the only change being that the Big Dumb Machines were now replaced by Big Smart Machines that could operate themselves. This was generally safer than leaving the steering in the hands of biological species, which had weird quirks that caused countless accidents, like sneezing, or falling asleep on long drives, or flying into murderous rages when someone cut them off.

However, alongside this advance they had developed what might be considered the ultimate form of travel: teleportation. Portal technology could also bring you to places that Big Machines, whether Smart or Dumb, could not, by tearing holes into other universes. Indeed, instantaneous travel to any and all of reality opened up a frontier so large and which carried so many unsettling implications that most people preferred to simply not think about them too deeply.

The limiting factor to teleportation is that reality really doesn‚Äôt seem to like having a hole drilled through it, so it takes an enormous amount of energy to open and maintain a portal, and it took more the further apart the two endpoints were. A little hop of a light year or so within the same universe was no problem. Traveling across the galaxy started to be a little taxing. Going to another universe entirely, on the other hand, took a¬†*lot*¬†of energy.

So much energy, in fact, that even a civilization like Infinity America, which had once harvested an entire solar system to build the universe‚Äôs largest day spa, was limited in the number of portals it could open to other universes at any one time. Such portals were usually only maintained for liberation efforts, or for other important endeavors, like building an archaeological museum on a barren, destroyed planet, complete with a gift shop that sold Huklavee-skull keychains.

Nobody on Moody Blue liked living near the teleportation portals. Theoretically, if something went wrong, then all the energy used to open and maintain them might be released at once, in a massive explosion. Of course, it was very silly to try to avoid it because ‚Äòmassive‚Äô in this case meant that the explosion would be large enough to boil away the entire space station along with most of the surrounding solar system. If you were worried about something like portal failure, it was really much better to live in another part of the galaxy, or even a different galaxy entirely.

But still, in deference to people‚Äôs illusion of comfort, teleportation portals were built very far away from residential areas, buried in a complex of bunkers beneath miles of Ultra-Concrete and NuSteel. It was a grim and dreary place, and as her bubble-car whipped through an endless dark tunnel, shadows flickering across her face in a blur, Olyrean could not help but be reminded of the grim field of demonic portals she had been dragged to, the day of her liberation.

Those portals had been a bit less powerful than these. The demons of her homeworld, as it turned out, did not live in another hellish dimension. They didn‚Äôt even live in a different solar system. They lived just one planet closer to the sun than hers, a mere pebble-skip on a cosmic scale, and so opening portals to their world required much less energy and was something that a group of grubby warlocks could manage. The demons were part of America too, now, though from what she understood their integration was much more troublesome and most of the planet was still locked up in remedial civics classes, on account of they kept trying to eat their instructors.

Eventually the tunnels opened up, and her bubble-car sped into a vast, dark cavern, before slowing down with a quiet little¬†*toodle-toodle-toodle-ooooooooooo,*¬†as if the car itself were awed by the sheer size of it. It came to a stop not far from the center and Olyrean got out, dragging her bags behind her.

Before her lay a great mass of complicated-looking machinery, unromantic and with no regard to aesthetics, like a heap of mechanical guts the size of a barn. This, she thought, must be the actual machinery used to harness and generate the portals. She had caught a glimpse of it before, the day that Jack had taken her from her world, through a portal and into a cavern just like this. Well, not quite like this. The day she had been liberated, they had dressed up the cavern with bright lights and patriotic bunting (and hundreds of medical shelters), and there had been fireworks and dozens of copies of Libby cheerleading them on‚Äìso much chaotic motion that Olyrean had not even realized, at first, that she was indoors.

But there was no decoration now, and no distraction, and in the echoing darkness of the cave she could see just how tremendously ugly and unpleasant-looking the teleportation machinery was. There were various bulbous black organ-like structures made of some rubbery material that pulsated and squelched. Viscous green fluid ran through a series of transparent hoses with suspicious-looking chunks squeezing their way through. And it all stank like an abandoned hippogryph sty. Still, she thought as she stood in its menacing shadow, it was better than a bunch of magical orcs.

‚ÄúOLYREAN TERALELIEN!‚Äù

Olyrean shrieked and dropped her bags and then promptly tripped on them as she went scrambling backwards. She fell in that sort of way that species with their nervous systems centralized around their spinal cord get, when the shock of the blow to their bottom seems to travel all the way up through their chest and into their head. It‚Äôs a very unpleasant sensation, but then again it is sort of their fault for not investing in an exoskeleton.

‚ÄúOLYREAN TERALELIEN OLYREAN TERALELIEN OLYREAN TERALELIEN OLYREAN TERALELIEN OLYREAN TERALELIEN OLYREAN TERALELIEN‚Äì‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?!‚Äù she snapped at the little silver device on her wrist through which Veezeebub‚Äôs voice was droning far too loudly.

‚ÄúAre you alright?‚Äù he asked mildly. ‚ÄúThat looked like a nasty fall.‚Äù

Olyrean didn‚Äôt question how they might have been able to see whether she had fallen or not, but she became very glad that she had never taken the bracelet into the bathroom with her. ‚ÄúWh‚Äìyou say nothing to me for weeks, and all you do is make me leap out of my skin and then‚Äì‚Äù She took a deep breath. ‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôm fine. I‚Äôm fine‚Äìjust, why contact me now?‚Äù

‚ÄúAs far down as you are,‚Äù came Tordle‚Äôs burbling voice, ‚Äúit is hard to get a signal out. Also there are many jamming devices because comms technology can often interfere with the portaling process.‚Äù

She waited for a few moments for more explanation to come. ‚ÄúThat sounds,‚Äù she said, when it didn‚Äôt, ‚Äúlike it makes it even¬†*more*¬†confusing why you‚Äôd choose to contact me now.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is less confusing,‚Äù said Veezeebub, ‚Äúif what we are worried about is someone else watching¬†*you.*‚Äù

Olyrean glanced around the vast empty darkness of the cavern and wished he hadn‚Äôt said that.

‚ÄúListen quickly. We wanted to take this opportunity to update you on your mission.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy mission? Isn‚Äôt it to help liberate Quizbar?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat a strange notion you have of¬†*listening*,‚Äù said Veezeebub, and Olyrean went quiet. ‚ÄúYes. Of course you will help with this, when you can. But there is another component to your mission. Your primary concern will be to discover what happened to the previous team.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù said Olyrean. This was a little disappointing. Libby had been encouraging a competitive spirit of sorts between the members of the team. A little friendly rivalry between their various areas of expertise, she said, would help them more efficiently tempt the Quizbarlings into the American way of life. Olyrean really had no idea how she might have done any of that, but she had hoped to join up with Moyom, or at the very least done what she could to make sure Brugga didn‚Äôt win.

‚ÄúYou sound disappointed,‚Äù said Veezeebub. ‚ÄúLet me assure you that this is just as important as liberating the planet itself.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù Tordle huffed. ‚ÄúSPECTRA is privy to secrets and modes of thought that might tear the very universe apart if people knew them! It is important that they remain secret, or if they are no longer secret, it is not a secret to us that they are not a secret!‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you saying,‚Äù said Olyrean, ‚Äúthat the previous team might know one of these secrets?‚Äù

‚ÄúAnyone can know these secrets,‚Äù Tordle blustered. ‚ÄúYou probably know one or two yourself.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think I would know if I knew something like that.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh, but do you¬†*know*¬†that you‚Äôd know that you knew?‚Äù

Olyrean thought about this for a moment.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúEnough!‚Äù snapped Veezeebub. ‚ÄúThe important part is that we must warn you. There are, perhaps, some oddities‚Ä¶some¬†\*curiosities..\*that you may discover along your search for the previous team. It is important that you exercise the number one rule of being a SPECTRA operative while on this mission.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou never told me what that was,‚Äù said Olyrean.

‚ÄúOf course not. It‚Äôs secret. We are a¬†*spy*¬†bureau, you know. Everything is on a strictly¬†*need-to-know*¬†basis. And we make very, very sure that people¬†*need-to-know*¬†what we are telling them. Even if it seems harmless, we do not say anything unless we are sure they¬†*need‚Ä¶to‚Ä¶know.*¬†And this applies to everyone. Are we clear?‚Äù

‚ÄúAs mud,‚Äù said Olyrean.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs far too clear!‚Äù Veezeebub cried. ‚ÄúEnd the call!‚Äù

His voice cut off. Olyrean mulled this over, staring at the bracelet for a long moment, wondering what they might have meant. Slowly, she got up, dusted off her skirt, and picked her bags back up.

‚ÄúOlly!‚Äù

She yelped and dropped her bags again, this time managing not to trip over them but to trip over a hose attached to the teleportation machine instead. She glared up at the figures approaching her from the shadows.

Well, that was not quite right. She had a fond smile for Moyom, despite the fact that it was her friend who had called out her name and startled her. It was Brugga who received her ire. He held out her bags to her timidly as she got up and she snatched them from him.

‚ÄúWhat is that on your head?‚Äù she snapped.

‚ÄúOh, do you like it?‚Äù the orc asked. It was a mauve beret, except berets didn‚Äôt usually rise and fall as if they were breathing, and usually they didn‚Äôt snore. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of those living hats.‚Äù

Olyrean could remember advertisements for these things. She could also remember thinking that you‚Äôd have to be an idiot to buy one of them. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd have to be an idiot to buy one of those,‚Äù she opined.

Brugga only chuckled. ‚ÄúAh, well. My son got it for me, for the trip. Good-luck charm, I guess‚Äì‚Äù

The beret interrupted him with a harrumph and a snort. It huffed and lifted up a fold, revealing a bleary blue eye that rolled around until it settled upon Olyrean and regarded her with a carefully cultivated, arrogant disregard that immediately impressed her. This thing could easily outdo elves for scorn.

‚ÄúWell, well,‚Äù it said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen an elf with such hairy ears.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?!‚Äù Olyrean grabbed the sides of her head. Her ears were¬†*not*¬†hairy. She‚Äôd had a laser removal procedure for that. ‚ÄúWhat did you say to me?!‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù said Brugga, as the beret lit a cigarette and exhaled a plume of smoke. ‚ÄúThis one, uh‚Äìwell, he just sort of does that, he insults people‚Äì‚Äù

‚ÄúSo change his personality settings, then!‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt. There aren‚Äôt any. They aren‚Äôt AIs, they‚Äôre biological.‚Äù

The living hats were an unusual product in Infinity America. The technology for such extreme genetic manipulation had existed for centuries, but after a flirtation with bio-manufacturing‚Äìa brief era where it became fashionable to live in houses with walls of flesh and shower beneath vaguely phallic glandular fixtures‚Äìthe American public quickly came to the conclusion that the technology was, in fact, really gross. This was followed by a spate of legislation that all but outlawed genetic manufacturing processes, under a confusing legal technicality under which the manipulated DNA was recognized as having ownership of itself, and was summarily shot into a sun on charges of engaging in auto-slavery.

Nevertheless, the SilCoMor Medical Devices and Supplementary FoodStuffs corporation (purveyor of Ol‚Äô Xubriq‚Äôs Classic Texan Hot Sauce: So Hot it‚Äôs a War Crime‚Ñ¢) had found a way around this when they discovered an ancient ship full of unclaimed humanoid DNA (i.e., corpses) floating in an abandoned sector of space, each of them wearing the tattered remains of some circular hat made from soft cloth. The ship‚Äôs records were corrupted and written in some long-forgotten language, but scientists were able to determine that the hats were called¬†*berets,*¬†and the name of the ship was¬†*La Derni√®re Fuite,*¬†which was eventually translated as¬†*The Ultimate Accessory.*¬†A cultural preservation ship, it was decided, for a people with a sacred dedication to their headpieces.

The DNA sat around until some enterprising marketing executive figured that a cultural preservation exception could be made to the DNA laws. Upon experimentation, SilCoMor scientists found that the DNA lent itself quite well to being reshaped into berets. Whoever these ancient travelers were, their new incarnations usually formed a predilection for smoking and baguettes and a weary bitterness that they couldn‚Äôt really explain. The berets flew off the shelves, and SilCoMor was lauded for both its charity and quarterly earnings. Special thanks were given in particular to their translation team, who were exactly as accurate as they needed to be to sell a product.

The beret blew smoke into the air, rolled its eye and managed to arrange its fabric into a sneer. ‚Äú*These*¬†are the people who are supposed to be‚Ä¶*liberating*¬†this, ah, Quizbar?‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúI could do a better job of it just sitting ‚Äòere on your head, I am sure of it.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the most asinine thing I‚Äôve ever heard,‚Äù Olyrean told the beret, in a very specific, very elven way that made it clear that this opinion also took in Brugga, and it was not merely that what the hat said was imbecilic, but rather the fundamental fact that they both existed was in itself a crying shame.

It was not long before Jack and Korak arrived, as well, and when they did, Libby appeared, projecting as a hologram from a small slot in Jack‚Äôs armor. They arranged themselves before the portal device in a half-circle, and Olyrean could not help but be reminded of the magical rites of the orc warlocks from her homeworld.

The spaghetti tangle of machinery and throbbing rubber pustules began to squelch and pulsate faster. Gobs of fluid rushed through the hoses, a nauseating rainbow of them. A high-pitched, anxious whine picked up, then grew louder and louder. Vents opened to belch forth foul gases and the air began to bend and boil.

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it beautiful?‚Äù Libby sighed.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Olyrean said. ‚ÄúSeems pretty disgusting to me, actually.‚Äù

The AI looked a little insulted by that. ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just how you look at it, I suppose.‚Äù

¬†

I stood up from the couch. We have been watching TV for the better part of the day. Neither of us got much sleep after tonight. Nikole now seems to be doing better on the surface, but she can hide her true feelings very well. The early evening sky is gorgeous as usual. Soft pinks, reds and yellows paint the white clouds on a stunningly blue sky. Flock of birds gently waves their wings in the distance. A wall of grey slowly creeps from the east.

While Nikole is getting dressed in the bedroom I adjust my messy hair in the bathroom mirror. I correct my blue bowtie, roll up the sleeve of my button-down shirt up to my elbows and tighten the belt on my jeans. We are going to church, so I need to look like a human.

As a kid I used to hate that place, not really understanding the importance of one‚Äôs faith. Many people don‚Äôt, and I get it. But over the years slowly finding my way to it. I don‚Äôt know if god cares at all if I miss the service. I don‚Äôt know if he cares if I pray every night. I don‚Äôt. Not because I find it annoying ‚Äì which I do ‚Äì but because I think that if he truly is as understanding and kind as people make him out to be, he probably knows that I have at least some faith in him. I am not a good Christian.

I miss the sermons all the time, my mom always asks if I‚Äôd be joining them in the church on Sundays. Needless to say, I rarely do. But today even Nikole wanted to go. I think she is even less of a believer than me. Strange, as far as Nikole told me, her mother still prays before sleep. She never forgets that, even with her condition. Religion helps people cope with hardship, and now that Nikole needs it the most, it is there for her. Just like it always was.

She dressed herself in black high heels and dark blue dress. Her ears decorated with glistening diamond earrings I gave her in Prague. I think it was a decent gift; I told her that it was for her help in my studies. A token of my appreciation. We both knew that it was a gift out of something much more. Her hair is made into a bun, exactly as she wears it in the hospital. I wonder if she likes it like that or just did it automatically.

Nikole looks at me, her brown eyes look tired. She sighs; I wrap my hands around her thin waist and squeeze her tightly. As I begin to release my hands, my hand grazes a small bump on her back.

‚ÄúCan you turn around for me please?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

‚ÄúYour back still hurts right?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, it‚Äôs been getting worse‚Äù she turns slowly.

‚ÄúMind if I‚Ä¶‚Äù I searched her back.

‚ÄúDo you feel anything?‚Äù

‚ÄúI do, It feels like tip of a vertebrae, but it shouldn‚Äôt be this far out right?‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe a bit of bone broke off when I slipped the other day‚Äù

‚ÄúYou said you caught yourself when you fell‚Äù

‚ÄúI lied, sorry, I hit the wall with my back pretty hard‚Äù

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt move when I push on it from the side, what if I‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúOwww‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry ah, I‚Äôll tell the charge nurse tomorrow to book you for a RTG just to be sure. It‚Äôs definitely broken; how did you manage that?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, you know the railing that lines the stairway?‚Äù I see her rolling her eyes. ‚Äúyeah‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúLook after yourself‚Äù

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt hurt that bad now. We should get going‚Äù

‚ÄúAll right then, just, don‚Äôt sleep on your back for now‚Äù

‚ÄúNot like I could anyway‚Äù

The church is in the west side of the city. It‚Äôs a weirdly shaped building. A tall bell tower in the front. Built out of chiseled stone blocks too heavy to be lifted by single person. Beautifully decorated with religious symbols, gargoyles and mosaic windows. Oxidized copper roof and a brass rooster that spins in the direction of the wind, now facing west. The roof of the main building covered with old tiles that have been here probably since the church was built.

When we entered the vestibule we could hear the priest begin the sermon. Crossing the narthex we scanned the aisles to see if my parents were attending. I saw them in the front left row. Unfortunately there weren‚Äôt any free spots next to them, so we settled for the back chairs. We were pretty late after all. I almost forgot to cross myself, so I dipped my fingers in the salty holly water and did the familiar gesture.

I really like the aesthetic of our church. Something about the religious artworks that cover the ceiling, the crystal chandeliers of great grandeur thoughtfully hung from the ceiling. The beauty of it all. I wonder how many people it took to construct this church. How many years of effort of the faithful. And it withstood the test of time, two world wars and five hundred years. No major reconstructions were needed either. The church still stands tall, just like the faith.

Father Joseph is in charge of the service this evening. He is probably in early forties, clean-shaven and a sort of old man‚Äôs face that doesn‚Äôt fit his body properly. Like has seen things, each leaving a new wrinkle on his forehead. His deep voice echoes through the full church. Kindness and reassurance radiate form his body.

Unfortunately we missed the opening of the sermon. Not like I would be able to sing along with the many people that know the texts by heart. I know they keep the psalms on the book racks behind the pews, but by the time I find the right one, they are usually already finished. Nikole holds my hand while we listen to the sermon.

‚ÄúAs was told in Proverbs 3:29‚Äù A moment of silence follows ‚ÄúDo not plot harm against your neighbor, who lives truthfully near you‚Äù

I wouldn‚Äôt say that Father Joseph‚Äôs sermons are boring. Far from it. He isn‚Äôt one of those ‚Äúmodern‚Äù priests that try their best to speak in the language of the youth to interest them in attending. He knows that younger generations tend to take religion less seriously. Like me and Nikole. And I think it would sound bad to the old folks if he started to speak like a chronically online kid. His gaze is focused on the left front row.

I think of Ivan. Mutter a crude, improvised prayer under my nose for him, for Nikole. I genuinely hope that he will pull through. I‚Äôve seen people get through worse‚Ä¶ and die of less. I don‚Äôt care about what kind of person he became. He had it hard, but he manned up, provided for the family as much as he could. Abandoned his dreams for Nikole and their mom. When we were kids he was like a brother to me, I wonder if we are good friends somewhere out there.

He did some bad things sure, but does that strip him of his humanity? Does he deserve to go to hell for that? After all as Nikole said, he didn‚Äôt actually do what he wanted for some reason. That has to count, right? We all sin in our thoughts, does God also count thought as a sin? If so, they better get my spot hot when I get down there. Look at me, trying to find good in the bad. To justify the unjust. I pray for Ivan‚Äôs health; I pray for Nikole‚Äôs happiness and hope someone prays for me.

I think my muttering wasn‚Äôt as quiet as I thought it was because Nikole is looking at me. Her eyer red and full of tears. She leans closer to me and whispers quietly to me.

‚ÄúThat was beautiful‚Äù Thankfully she can‚Äôt read my thoughts just yet.

She briefly leans back against the chair and quickly distances her from the backrest. I grip her tighter, attempting to alleviate the sharp pain she undoubtedly felt. Her eyes dart up towards the ceiling, helping the tears flow back, away from her cute cheeks. Her mouth opens slightly; they spark from the refracted light.

‚ÄúLord, we, the faithful, shall not disobey thy teachings, and shall not be lead astray from your light by the harshness in our lives. Our hearts shall burn with love for each other, and they shall be open for the light of the holy trinity. Let us be strong but kind. Let us be loving but not blind. Let us be proud of being your sons and daughters. Amen‚Äù

‚ÄúAmen‚Äù A hundred voices echo in this beautiful church.

We wait for the people in the front rows to take part in the communion. I admire the intricate carved design of the confession booth. Wondering when was the last time that I confessed my sins to the Father. Have I done something in these past years that needs confessing to? Probably. I try to remember all the wrongdoings I‚Äôve seen in the hospital. All the shady things that happen. Patients hospitalized just for the sake of keeping the money flowing while they could have already been at home with their loved ones. Not speaking up to my superiors when I should have. Blindly following the doctor‚Äôs orders, not questioning if this really is the best course of treatment.

Are they considered sins? I do consider them sins. One should think for themselves. Speak their mind against wrongdoing, act when action needs to be taken. It is almost our time to stand in the row of the faithful to partake in the communion. I notice my parents walking down the nave. They are looking at us, surprised in a good way. When they pass by us I shyly wave at them, my father gives me a respectful nod.

I allow Nikole to stand in front of me in the line. Some people stay in the back near the narthex, kneel and pray for a while in silence. The organist skillfully plays the complex instrument. Notes come in perfect succession. Probably the thousandth time that they played this gorgeous melody. Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they could play it blindfolded. My parents stood by the door to wait for us.

Nikole now stands in front of the priest. He looks at her, looks as if he searches in his memory. Then he smiles. I guess he remembered her form the hospital. I saw his calling cards there. We give them to families when they need a priest. He sometimes comes to give blessings to the ill.

‚ÄúCorpus Christi‚Äù

‚ÄúAmen‚Äù

He stretches his hand to Nikole, holding the sacramental bread. Nikole opens her mouth to partake in the communion. Gently savors the body of our savior. Father Joseph then draws the holy symbol on her forehead with holy water. Nikole humbly bows her head and turns around to leave, her hand springs to her back. It is my turn to partake. His eyes shift from her only when he gives me the sacramental bread.

‚ÄúCorpus Christi‚Äù He smiles. Does he remember me? I haven‚Äôt been here for years.

‚ÄúAmen‚Äù

The sacramental bread sticks to the roof of my mouth. I do not let it show on my face while Father Joseph traces the holy symbol on my forehead. My tongue works to unstick it while I bow my head. I studied the reflections on the floor on my way out. I was just about to leave when I remembered to cross myself. I dipped my fingers in the holy water, turned towards the altar and knelt. I touched my forehead.

‚ÄúIn the name of the father‚Äù My fingers lay on my heart ‚Äúand of the son‚Äù now quickly moving my hand from left shoulder to the right ‚Äúand of the Holy Spirit. Amen‚Äù

Just as we exited the church my hand instinctively went into the pocket to search for my addiction. I hesitated; it wouldn‚Äôt look nice if I smoked here would it. My hands search for a comfortable place; I keep them busy by crossing them in front of me. We stood in a circle, my parents and Nikole.

‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt expecting you two to show up‚Äù started mom.

‚ÄúWe thought it would help us find peace‚Äù

‚ÄúSomething happened?‚Äù comes my dad.

‚ÄúMy brother was in a car accident‚Äù My dad‚Äôs head snaps towards mom; he looks like he saw a ghost but his expression changes back to normal quickly.

‚ÄúMy god, Is he okay?‚Äù cries mom as she holds onto her husband.

‚ÄúHe‚Ä¶ he‚Äôll pull through it‚Äù Image of the wrecked car pops into my mind.

‚ÄúHe is stable now, but unconscious‚Ä¶ a few broken bones‚Äù said Nikole silently.

‚ÄúI uh, we‚Äôre sorry to hear that darling‚Äù dad produces a cigarette from his pocket.

‚ÄúWhen did this happen? Why didn‚Äôt you let me know Milan?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey found him yesterday at around two. We actually ran into him on Friday‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah? What was he up to?‚Äù dad releases a puff of smoke.

‚ÄúHe ah, wanted to say hi to us‚Äù comes Nikole.

‚ÄúWe met him at The Usual Place‚Äù

‚ÄúA high end restaurant for a guy like him‚Äù he said rather insensitively ‚ÄúI heard he was homeless or something‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, he lives at our old place‚Äù Nikole looks hurt.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm really sorry to hear that Nikole, we all felt for him after‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll come visit him at the hospital sometime, when are the visiting hours?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a good idea dad, he is stable now, but he is battling a fever now. So we can‚Äôt let people see him right now, you know‚Ä¶ infections and such‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, you‚Äôre probably right‚Äù he pats my back. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm proud of you two‚Äù

‚ÄúWe both are, must be hard on you. Do you want to come over for dinner?‚Äù I looked over at Nikole to search for her approval.

‚ÄúSounds nice, but ah, isn‚Äôt your place far from here? We would get there late, and I don‚Äôt want to intrude‚Äù

‚ÄúSweetie that‚Äôs the least, we got here by car, we‚Äôll give you a lift‚Äù

I wrapped my hand around Nikole. ‚ÄúAll right, but we won‚Äôt stay long if that‚Äôs not a problem, I have work tomorrow‚Äù

Dad laughs. ‚ÄúYou are always at work these days aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI have to get used to it so work I increased hours‚Äù

‚ÄúNot a bad idea, you are still young and full of energy so you can handle it‚Äù said mom.

‚ÄúSo far I can handle it just fine, it should count to my pension right?‚Äù I said jokingly.

‚ÄúThinking ahead, I like that son‚Äù dad said sarcastically.

‚ÄúSo, where is your car?‚Äù came Nikole.

‚ÄúOh, yeah, umm, let me just‚Äù

Dad pulled the keys from his pocket after a moment of searching and held them up in the air. A loud beep came from behind the church. He has a BMW, pretty nice one even though it‚Äôs a SUV. He never let me drive; I think he is afraid I‚Äôd scratch it somewhere. He looks after it well because it‚Äôs his company car so his boss would be pissed.

The drive ‚Äúhome‚Äù was very nostalgic to me. We sat in the back; Nikole held my hand. I couldn‚Äôt help but think about the old days. It felt like we were kids again, taking Nikole to our place for a sleepover. Now just two adults, going to visit my parents, drink coffee and compliment them on meaningless things. I think Nikole doesn‚Äôt really want to stay there for long. Her reluctance and note about not wanting to intrude were obvious signs for me. I‚Äôll have to find an excuse to leave early.

My parent‚Äôs place is in the suburbs at the outer part of the city. Not too far from the center. It‚Äôs in a small three story apartment building. Dad pulled over in front of the building and motioned for us to exit the car. We did, then I let my mom take the lead. I don‚Äôt mind moving away from here. Change in life is necessary for growth right? I‚Äôm planning on renting bigger car so I can move all my things at once. Most of the important stuff was already taken care of but some boxes remain.

It still feels like the true home it is. We sat around the dining table and waited for my dad to join us. Nikole played with her hair nervously while my mom frantically prepared the table for us to eat. For now she brought us coffee and cupcakes. The ticking of the old grandfather clock disturbed the silence. I heard the front door open, and my dad entered. He had a bottle of wine in his hand.

‚ÄúDad I don‚Äôt plan on drinking‚Äù

‚ÄúDrinking? I just wanted to show you‚Äù he smiles. ‚ÄúNah I‚Äôm just messing with you‚Äù he comes closer to show me the bottle. ‚ÄúYou really don‚Äôt want it?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not in the mood right now, sorry‚Äù

‚ÄúAll right, we‚Äôll open it another time‚Äù he looks towards the kitchen. ‚ÄúHoney?!‚Äù

‚ÄúYes darling?‚Äù comes from the kitchen.

‚ÄúCome here already‚Äù

‚ÄúJust a sec‚Äù she comes out of the kitchen with a big cooking pot. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve made shepherd‚Äôs pie‚Äù She looks proud of herself.

‚ÄúOh wow, it smells amazing‚Äù It really does.

‚ÄúWait till you taste it, then you can judge‚Äù said dad.

My mom laid the table and carefully distributed the food, taking care to arrange the plates neatly. She disappeared into the kitchen again to look for something to drink. She came back with sweaty bottle of sparkling water. My parents weren‚Äôt fond of sweet drinks, always said that it spoils the taste. When she finally sat down, she said a short prayer thanking the Lord for this food and gestured for us to eat. Nikole ate a tiny bit and then played with the fork.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt like it sweetie?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, sorry I do just, I‚Äôm not all that hungry that‚Äôs all‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fine, I‚Äôll pack some for you two, so you don‚Äôt have to cook tomorrow‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really good mom, but don‚Äôt worry we have food at home‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course you do, we just want you to have something ready that‚Äôs all‚Äù said dad.

‚ÄúThank you, you are really kind‚Äù said Nikole politely.

‚ÄúAnd ah, Milan?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes?‚Äù

‚ÄúMind if I steal you for myself after? For a word‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúIs something wrong?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, just, father and son conversation‚Ä¶‚Äù

I finished the plate, a little too salty for me but it was all right. I don‚Äôt have the courage to tell my mom I didn‚Äôt really want to take some home. I think of giving it to someone in need on our way back. Nikole managed to clean the plate as well, she offered to help mom clean the dishes. After a few persuasive words my mom agreed. Dad looked at me, he looked worried, he nodded towards the balcony.

I stood up and followed him. We sat down; he stuck his pack of cigarettes under my nose in an offering manner. I rejected; I don‚Äôt like the brand he smokes. Too harsh on the throat for me. He is used to it, I think he was born with a lighter and a cigarette in his hands.

‚ÄúSo what did you want to say?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust want to make sure, you know, about‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI love her dad‚Äù

‚ÄúI know‚Äù

‚ÄúSo? You have a problem with her‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs your life son‚Äù he sighs. ‚ÄúI just want to make sure she told everything first‚Äù

‚ÄúI know her since childhood‚Äù

‚ÄúThink I don‚Äôt know that?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot what I meant‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúSo she didn‚Äôt tell you everything‚Äù

‚ÄúThink she has something to hide?‚Äù ¬†

‚ÄúI know she does‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you tell me then?‚Äù

‚ÄúHave you talked to her? Like really talked?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh come on dad, what is it?‚Äù I frowned.

‚ÄúI think it would be better if you heard it from her‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúQuit this cryptic shit, what is she not telling me?‚Äù

‚ÄúFind out‚Äù He grips the silver cross that sits neatly on his chest.

‚ÄúYou are creeping me out dad‚Äù

‚ÄúYou should be creeped out‚Äù

‚ÄúFuck that‚Äù

‚ÄúWatch your tongue son‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry, I just‚Ä¶ what are you talking about‚Äù

‚ÄúAsk her about her mother‚Äù

‚ÄúDad she has Alzheimer‚Äôs; there is nothing to talk about‚Äù

‚ÄúIs that what she told you?‚Äù ¬†

‚ÄúYeah, think she is lying?‚Äù

‚ÄúI know she is. Don‚Äôt be afraid to push her‚Äù

‚ÄúShe has it rough right now, think that‚Äôs a good idea?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs stronger than you think‚Äù he paused. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want anything to happen to you son‚Äù

‚ÄúYou think she‚Äôll burn me?‚Äù The bell tolls in the distance.

‚ÄúNo, she wouldn‚Äôt, not by her own doing at least. Just her family‚Ä¶ there are things she should tell you‚Äù

‚ÄúSo you just want me to ask about her mom?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think you should get moving‚Äù he sighs. ‚ÄúYou said you have to go to work tomorrow right?‚Äù

‚ÄúI do‚Äù

I went back in, my mom was talking about something in the kitchen, but I couldn't understand what she was saying. Just as I was about to get Nikole she walked out of the room. She looked as if she was contemplating something in her mind, opened her mouth to say something but stopped herself at the last moment.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs getting late, we should head back home‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah‚Äù

‚ÄúYou want to walk? or‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI think we should walk, I want to tell you something‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, yeah all right, I also wanted to talk about something‚Äù

‚ÄúHere, from your mom‚Äù she handed me the box of food mom has packed.

The sky was obscured by a veil of black clouds. It rained lightly, no need for an umbrella for now, but by the time we get home our clothes will be damp. It‚Äôs a decently long walk from here so even this light rain will do its thing. We made our way out of the mazelike streets of the suburbs, once on the main street it‚Äôs a straight shot to my new home.

The light slowly disappears from the world as the night arrives. Not a soul in sight. We walked hand in hand, neither of us seemed to say what was on our minds. I quietly observed the city. Just the peak of the church‚Äôs bell tower was visible from this distance. The bell tolled nine times. Each ring echoed throughout the surrounding buildings and mountains.

I wonder what my dad wanted from me. Nikole‚Äôs dad and he used to be very close, so they probably talked about me and her. I think it was obvious that we weren‚Äôt going to be just friends. Did they not want us to be together? Eyes lay upon the back of my neck, forcing me to turn around. I look inside the many windows around us, none of them host anyone inside. Well at least, I didn‚Äôt see anyone.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

‚ÄúSo, what did you want to talk about?‚Äù she looked at me.

‚ÄúI ah, my dad, he, wanted me to ask you about your mom‚Äù

‚ÄúFunny, your mom also wanted that from me, To tell you‚Ä¶ I mean‚Äù

‚ÄúSomething to do with her condition?‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúI don‚Äôt actually know what is happening to her, no one does‚Äù

‚ÄúNo one does?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell my father took her to many doctors. They all said it is like early Alzheimer‚Äôs, but it doesn‚Äôt quite fit‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat doesn‚Äôt fit?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, she periodically develops a rash. It follows major nerves in her body, but it usually disappears when she‚Äôs about to go to sleep. It slowly got worse over the years. Looks like tiny bug bites‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just weird, it came really quickly, like one night. It‚Äôs like sepsis, slowly eating her.‚Äù I really need to visit her mother, haven‚Äôt seen her for a long time now. ¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre saying it came out of nowhere?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, I think she caught something from Ivan. He was really sick one day‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? Why?‚Äù  
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I was too young then, barely remember anything. It was right after we moved into that house. All I remember from that day is the two of us looking at some stuff in the basement. So much dust. When our parents found us there they practically dragged us out‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat does this have to do with your mom?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell that night Ivan got a really high fever. My room was right next to his. I heard his confused groans through the wall. Parents were worried for him. Thankfully my dad was a good friend of Farther Joseph. I think he used to be a paramedic if memory serves, also lived close by, so they called him to check Ivan‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt they take him to the hospital?‚Äù ¬†

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Well I‚Äôm not sure if it even was Father Joseph to be honest, just his voice is very similar. They went into Ivan‚Äôs room, he spoke in a loud but calm voice, I can‚Äôt remember what he was saying. Then there was an awful silence. My dad shouted something. There was a loud thump, like a sack of potatoes falling to the ground‚Äù

‚ÄúSomething happened to Ivan?‚Äù ¬†

‚ÄúNo, he was all right. They left the room, Father Joseph reassured my dad that Ivan is going to be all right, there was struggle in his voice. Like they were carrying something heavy‚Äù

‚ÄúYou seem to remember it pretty well‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ it comes back to me, when I try to remember, it‚Äôs just, hazy‚Ä¶ like piecing together a puzzle. I don‚Äôt know what happened when, but this way it makes the most sense to me‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you remember anything else?‚Äù

‚ÄúSomeone opened the door on my room. I pretended to be asleep. Then I heard car starting‚Ä¶ I went to check what was happening. I was scared; the house was so dark, unfamiliar, unpleasantly warm. Ivan was sound asleep in his room‚Äù ¬†

‚ÄúSo where did they go?‚Äù

‚ÄúI guess they took my mom to the hospital‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you remember why?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, and I never asked. After that night, things seemed to return to normal. Well except for my mom, something was wrong with her. Couldn‚Äôt tell what back then, still can‚Äôt‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs when she got sick?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhatever happened that night, it‚Ä¶ changed her, whatever was hurting her only got worse through the day. But when she woke up the next morning‚Ä¶ it was as if she was fine again‚Äù

‚ÄúSleeping helped her?‚Äù

‚ÄúI guess. She lived like this for several years, learned to fight with it. I bet you weren‚Äôt even aware of it‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right. I wasn‚Äôt, at least for the first few years. Then I began noticing something was off‚Äù

‚ÄúThat was when she got the rash for the first time. Things spiraled downwards from then on. You know the rest‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúSo she caught something from Ivan, and it awakened some illness in her?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre guess is as good as mine‚Äù ¬†

‚ÄúWell it‚Äôs no unheard of, just that‚Ä¶ what exactly is it‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Now she forgets things, only remembers things from the past. It‚Äôs like she lives in it. Trapped in some day gone by‚Äù

‚ÄúI am so sorry‚Äù

‚ÄúI think your parents don‚Äôt want us to be together Milan‚Äù ¬†

‚ÄúMaybe they think it‚Äôs genetic‚Äù

‚ÄúIt might be‚Äù ¬†

‚ÄúI ah, I don‚Äôt care, even if it is‚Ä¶‚Äù I stood in front of her. ‚ÄúI still love you just the same‚Äù

I hugged her close.

‚ÄúI love you‚Äù she said with her face buried in my arms. ¬†

I am inclined to trust what she said, but it‚Äôs definitely not everything. I can‚Äôt figure out what she isn‚Äôt telling me just yet; I‚Äôll have to press her further some other time. We are getting close to our home. With the box of food from mom in my left hand I hold the door for her with the other one.

I immediately went to sit down for another cigarette. There are many things I have to think about. My best guess about why my parents seem to be against our relationship is that they are pissed at Mr. Urban. After all he basically left his children and wife to live without him. From what I understand he sent them some finances, but Ivan had to work despite that. I can‚Äôt imagine what it must be like to grow up without one parent, let alone both. A weird bug lands on the table beside me; I kill it with the lit tip of my cigarette.

I still don‚Äôt understand what happened to her mother. It is possible that she caught a virus or something from Ivan that awakened some genetical condition in her.

But what could it be? She said that none of the doctors they took her to knew what was going on exactly. It is rare to find a new disease, very uncommon but not entirely out of the picture. Not like I would be able to figure out what is happening to her. I‚Äôm not a doctor. But that was supposedly a couple years ago, maybe by this time the advances in medicine would help us diagnose her.

And then there is her father. I get that watching your loved one slowly disintegrate before our eyes, unable to help them, must be incredibly difficult to handle‚Ä¶ to live with. But leaving them like that, I don‚Äôt know. All I saw was a happy family back then. Nothing seemed wrong. I can‚Äôt imagine how much energy it took from them to put up such a convincing fa√ßade. When things began escalating, at first at least, the only thing I noticed was that he was awake deep into the night. Reading some old books that looked like they would fall apart just by looking at them incorrectly. ¬†

I hope that Ivan will pull through. I‚Äôd be more than happy to help him out of his pit, if not for him at least for Nikole. Shouldn‚Äôt be too hard either. I‚Äôll just have to pull on a few strings. Pretty sure there also be an investigation into why he has crashed. I have to convince Anette‚Äôs husband to omit some things from the report. Tom should be cooperative anyway; people wouldn‚Äôt be happy if they found out about him sharing sensitive photos It should help loosen whatever sentence they rule as just. Since he‚Äôs already in hospital it will be easy to convince some doctor to recommend him for rehab. I think the court would see him fit¬† for it..

Who knows, if the mandated rehab helps him he should be on a right track again. I am willing to forgive whatever he had to do with Nikole. Well if she really told me the truth about brushing him off. If not then‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know what I do. It would take away any motivation I have to help him get better. I really have to ask him about it, see his side of the story. I think only then can I make the right decision. Whatever that means.

‚ÄúMilan?!‚Äù comes from the living room.

‚ÄúYes? What is it‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease come here, quickly!‚Äù

I quickly stood up and went to check what was happening, leaving the still lit cigarette on the ground. Nikole was sitting on the couch with the notebook in her lap. She held her hands in front of her face, covering herself. I looked at the screen. WhatsApp was open and a long message appeared on the screen. I gently lifted the notebook and sat next to her. Couldn‚Äôt tell if she was happy or sad.

It read: ‚ÄúI am sorry to disturb you guys on the weekend but there has been a situation with your brother. At around noon he regained consciousness, his fever had subsided, but we weren‚Äôt able to communicate with him. He just looked at us with a blank face. He didn‚Äôt respond to our questions, probably due to the concussion he suffered in the crash. Otherwise he seemed to be healthy, even the neurologist said so after he checked him.‚Äù

‚ÄúSee, I told you he would pull through‚Äù

‚ÄúRead on‚Äù She sobbed.

I continued reading: ‚ÄúWe thought everything was going to be okay, we spoke to him, explained what happened, that you would come to see him soon. Then he started to speak. He repeated the same sentence over and over again. Sounded like gibberish to me, he cried while he spoke. Please remain calm while reading the next sentence, he is all right now. Later today his heart stopped, and we had to resuscitate him. As I said, don‚Äôt worry, he is still with us. But he‚Äôs comatose again. I only half remember what he said, if you want I can sketch it out, maybe it will mean something to you.‚Äù

‚ÄúFuck‚Äù Nikole couldn‚Äôt control herself now. ‚ÄúCome here‚Äù I lay the notebook on the table and grabbed a handful of her. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all right, I‚Äôm here‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to lose him as well‚Äù

‚ÄúNeither do I‚Äù I stroked her head ‚ÄúI was just thinking about him, I know how to help when he gets better‚Äù

‚ÄúSeriously?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, I just have to talk to some people first‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat is your plan?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell you when it‚Äôs a better time‚Äù I yawned. ‚ÄúNow come to bed‚Äù

When she fell asleep, I carefully left her side and went into the living room again. I am curious about what he was saying. Damn, I hope whoever sent her this message was still awake. It was pretty late in the night at this point. I took the notebook into the kitchen and sat down behind the counter. The message was sent by Jana. I wasn‚Äôt surprised. She also works increased number of hours. The two of us basically live there at this point.

I didn‚Äôt want to clutter Nikole‚Äôs chat with messages that she didn‚Äôt send so I sent Jana my phone number and asked if she could send me what she remembered. The message was on read immediately and shortly after, a response arrived.

‚Äúhi who am I talking to‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Milan, Nikole is asleep already, I just want to know what he said‚Äù

‚Äúall right I‚Äôll do my best its hard to tell what he said exactly he was crying and sobbing‚Äù

‚Äúhard to hear what he said‚Äù

‚Äúalso definitely not our language so my transcription will be harsh‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, go ahead‚Äù

‚Äúeg nos che mihi propter kwod feki ex irah‚Äù

‚Äúthen a brief pause‚Äù

‚Äúnunk id prohi be reh non po hsom‚Äù

‚Äúit sounded like Spanish or Italian to me but im not good with languages‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, thank you anyway, probably won‚Äôt be able to decipher it right now, I was just curious. Nikole is already asleep, I don‚Äôt want to wake her up for this‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you‚Äù

‚Äúno problem milan‚Äù

‚Äúi am sorry for what happened as i told you before tell me if you need anything‚Äù

‚ÄúI will, thanks again, good night‚Äù

I tried reading it out loud with different tones to see if anything clicks. Only thing I am certain about is that it‚Äôs definitely Latin. When I made this realization it sent shivers down my spine. I‚Äôve watched too many horror movies for this. Since I didn‚Äôt pay attention during my Latin classes in school I couldn‚Äôt find the words that matched Jana‚Äôs description. I tried googling and some AI translators, but it amounted to nothing. So I just scribbled a note for Nikole to see if she came up with anything in the morning.

I put the notebook where it was before and carefully snuck back to bed. Set the alarm on my smartwatch so as to not wake her up in the morning. I contemplated what to do now. Thoughts aimlessly drifted in my head. After a while I turned to my side and closed my eyes. I felt Nikole nuzzle up to me, guess I wasn‚Äôt as sneaky as I thought I was.

It‚Äôs sometime in the night; my naked body is covered in sweat and blood. A scar covers most of my stomach. I slowly stand up, careful not to slip on the bloody puddle that lays below me. It‚Äôs awfully calm, and I can‚Äôt hear a single noise in the whole apartment. I look around, shadows dance across the walls. Some light comes from outside, warm oranges and reds. It feels like a hot summer day.

I now realize what is happening, another nightmare. But now that I am aware of it, I expect to wake up at any moment. I‚Äôve had some lucid dreams in the past; they always fell apart after I realized it‚Äôs only a dream. I think hard, you‚Äôre supposed to be able to control these dreams. Can‚Äôt figure it out just yes, I can only control my body. Everything around me is hazy, things don‚Äôt look quite right.

I decided to look around while the dream holds. The air feels thick, like syrup. I feel like something is watching me. Nikole is in the kitchen; she is not alone. My mother is talking to her. I walk around them, they look very real, but they don‚Äôt notice me being there. They are becoming transparent, slowly fading away. Did I do that? Now the whole apartment is empty, there are no walls, no windows, no floor or ceiling.

My skin grows grotesquely big goosebumps, as bis as pimples with thick hairs protruding from their center. Image of a beating heart comes to my mind, creeped out I frantically turn around to see something, anything. A deep rumble comes from below. Almost like a voice. Ivan stand‚Äôs in front of me now. His face mimics mine like a shattered mirror. I reach out to touch him, he grabs my hand, forces it beside me. There is some strange quality about him, like he‚Äôs wearing a mask. Something lurks behind his eyes. He smiles; things are moving below his skin.

The smile fades, he falls to his knees, grabs my forearms and begs me for something. Tears flow from his eyes. I feel uncomfortable at the scene unfolding before me. As he desperately holds onto my arms, his fingers leave marks in the blood that covers me. The thin scar on my palm falls to the ground, he looks at it with big eyes. I try to pull away from him, taking a step back his grip loosens. Ivan falls to the ground and curls up into a ball.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù he begins to whisper. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know‚Äù snot pours from his nose. ‚ÄúI tried to show you, you still don‚Äôt understand‚Äù

‚ÄúUnderstand what?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere is still time‚Äù

I hear the bells from the church, slowly a cacophony of cries and moans begins to be audible. Coming from all around us. Ivan begins to laugh maniacally, his body trembles and goes limp. His chest doesn‚Äôt move anymore. I kneeled beside him, putting my hand on his forehead. Markings appear on his back, like something is clawing at him from the inside. Blood oozes out of the new wounds. One of them opens wide, is that an? Eyelid?

‚ÄúHe will mourn‚Äù Comes a deep, rumbling voice. ‚ÄúThe things he cherished‚Äù It sounds‚Ä¶ full of regret. ‚ÄúAll will be taken‚Äù

Ivan gasps as his body begins to smolder. Pillars of blue hot flame emerge from some of the wounds. Others leak puss of terrible color and odor. Another wound tear open, fingertips, tongues, ears, knees and elbows protrude from the gaping cracks. He contorts in pain. Flames engulf his flesh around the uncountable openings. The torn-open markings are moving slowly, then quickly. Each movement undoubtedly painful beyond imagination. He is pulled to his feet by invisible strings. I lose my balance and fall. He towers over me. Tears still flowing from his eyes.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôll know what to do‚Ä¶ It was‚Ä¶ prevented before‚Äù said Ivan through clenched teeth.",1,1758024243.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

The event will begin at 10am at Rodney Parade, with an opening ceremony by Mark O‚ÄôBrien, Newport County‚Äôs 'Great Escape' hero. Participants will walk a 5km route, passing the David Bomber Pearce Statue and returning to the stadium. It‚Äôs a family-friendly activity designed to support a charitable cause while promoting physical activity.

Charity Run Challenge ‚Äì 19/10/2025
Starting at 9am from the David Bomber Pearce Statue, the charity run will take participants on a scenic route to St David‚Äôs Hall in Cardiff. The event aims to encourage fitness while raising funds for charity.

The **Welsh Rocky Charity** was founded to honor the legacy of **David ""Bomber"" Pearce**, a notable figure in Newport's boxing community. The charity was the idea of Pearce‚Äôs nephew Luke who pushed for a statue in 2018 on the city riverfront.

David Pearce‚Äôs impact on the area, both as a boxer and a community figure, inspired the creation of the charity. Its primary focus is on supporting local children and families, particularly through funding for sporting activities that promote healthy recreation.

Yesterday I had a rather unusual experience in one of the malls in a pretty posh area of Dubai. I was sitting alone at a coffee shop while my family was busy with shopping. I noticed a lady in her 30s, dressed in pants and western clothes with her head covered, carrying a handbag, circling and looking at me for almost 15 minutes.

I have had a great success post-op. Everything is healing up well. I am back to regular activities and had my two week follow up 5 days ago. (Of course that was when this new peoblem started)

I've been waking up at night to this gnawing, dull ache that wraps around my entire upper torso. It only lasts about 5-10 minutes, but i have to get up and move, maybe drink water, and its rough, but it only lasts this short time.  

Idk if its thoracic back pain pinching a nerve or if it seems to come from the middle of upper abdomen (niddle uloer quadrant). The only food pattern i have noted is that it happened on days i had coffee, but i had been drinking coffee the last 2 weeks with no problem. Also, this pain happens around 3-5am and i only drink coffee around 8am.

The pain is tough. Idk if i ever actually had a gallstone attack bc ny symptoms were mild. Not sure if this is what it feels like, i just had physical pain to touch the RUQ, and pinching sensations, ended up being full of gallstones, i.e. Why they took it out. 

SOD? Rogue stone left behind? Pinched nerve? Help?

[Sunrise Energy Receives $103m LOI from US Export-Import Bank for Syerston Project Development](https://smallcaps.com.au/sunrise-energy-loi-us-export-import-bank-syerston-project-development/)

https://preview.redd.it/tcmsepovfipf1.png?width=868&format=png&auto=webp&s=72f48ab13ab44f2eda66c6ea4493cdc302637dfc

[Sunrise Energy Metals (ASX: SRL)](https://smallcaps.com.au/stocks/asx-srl/)¬†has continued its run of success at the Syerston scandium project in NSW after receiving a letter of interest (LOI) for up to $103 million in potential financing support from the US Export-Import Bank (EXIM).

EXIM offers international financing ‚Äì including export credit insurance, working capital guarantees, loan guarantees and direct loans ‚Äì and the new funding would provide approximately half the capital Sunrise needs to develop the project.

The company released a mineral resource estimate (MRE) earlier this month that confirmed Syerston as the world‚Äôs largest and highest-grade scandium deposit after achieving a 160% increase in mineralization.

# US Supply Chain Support

The size and potential of that critical minerals deposit has enhanced Syerston‚Äôs potential to support development of reliable and secure supply chains for US industry under several EXIM programs, including its Supply Chain Resiliency Initiative and the China Transformational Exports Program.

According to co-chair Robert Friedland, the LOI highlights the importance of scandium to the US‚Äîboth as a critical component in wireless communications technologies and advanced alloys supporting the civilian and defence sectors.

‚ÄúAs a key ally of the US, Australia‚Äôs significant endowment of strategic metals positions it to be an important supplier in the future,‚Äù he noted.

Chief executive officer Sam Riggall said the strong show of support by EXIM for the financing and development of Syerston would strengthen the company‚Äôs engagement with customers to secure offtake arrangements.

# Significant Scandium Resource

The new Syerston MRE identified 1,155 tonnes of contained scandium at an average grade of 665 grams per tonne, with more than 99% of the resource now in the Measured and Indicated categories.

The significant increase has led Sunrise to delay its release of a Syerston feasibility study until late October, to allow it to incorporate the new metal inventories in the ore reserve estimate and optimisation of the project‚Äôs mine plan.

***Global scandium supply remains tight since China imposed export controls on it in April 2025.***

[Shown is a graphical artist rendering of the Next Generation Air Dominance \(NGAD\) Platform. The rendering highlights the Air Force‚Äôs sixth generation fighter, the F-47. The NGAD Platform will bring lethal, next-generation technologies to ensure air superiority for the Joint Force in any conflict. \(U.S. Air Force graphic\)](https://preview.redd.it/08gb9psthipf1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4186f8e56df5b0f2a3ad72d8d30a34bc9491615)

**Key Points and Summary -**¬†Boeing‚Äôs F-47 (NGAD) contract starts around 185 jets‚Äîabout $108M each‚Äîbut that baseline may be too small.

\-With F-35A mission-capable rates near 52% and only 143 combat-coded F-22s, usable stealth capacity is thin.

\-China fields hundreds of J-20s and is adding J-35s; Russia‚Äôs Su-57s are growing, too.

\-The F-47 is expected to outrange and out-pace current U.S. jets (‚âà1,000-nm radius, >Mach 2) and carry more weapons, making it the linchpin for air superiority.

\-To hedge against low readiness and rising adversary numbers, analysts argue the USAF should target 300‚Äì500 F-47s‚Äîenough to deter in the Pacific and sustain combat power if war comes.

# How Many Boeing F-47 Fighters Does the USAF Need?

[Dr. Peter Gordon](https://priceschool.usc.edu/faculty/directory/peter-gordon/), Professor Emeritus at the¬†[University of Southern California (USC)](https://usctrojans.com/sports/football/schedule/2025), was fond of telling his undergrad students in his Macroeconomics general education class back in the mid-1990s that ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no such thing as needs‚Äù because ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs always substitutes.‚Äù Be that as it may, however well-reasoned Prof. Gordon‚Äôs claims may have been in theory, roughly 99.99% of the English-speaking population includes the word ‚Äúneed(s)‚Äù as part of its lexicon.

This statement is certainly true of the¬†[United States Department of War](https://www.war.gov/)‚Äîthe still unofficial title of the Department of Defense‚Äîin general, and the¬†[Department of the Air Force](https://www.usgovernmentmanual.gov/Agency?EntityId=aiheBTHQXkk=&ParentEId=tv4LVSeIL00=&EType=/sbLHImeIYk=)¬†in particular. This poses the question, how many F-47 Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) 6th Generation fighter planes will¬†[the USAF](https://www.airforce.com/training/military-training/ots/overview)¬†‚Äúneed‚Äù (at least on paper)?

# Some Basic Numbers

The initial contract for the¬†[NGAD](https://nationalsecurityjournal.org/boeings-ngad-f-47-fighter-might-end-up-with-ferrari-f-35-dna/)‚Äîwhich was signed back in March‚Äî is¬†[worth an estimated $20 billion](https://apnews.com/article/fighter-jet-ngad-trump-hegseth-china-55d7b3d15e5a4fa9cb061ec85ac19ae2)¬†to produce at least 185 airframes, which matches the number of Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor 5th-generation stealth fighters¬†[currently in the USAF fleet](https://san.com/cc/everything-we-know-about-the-f-47-usafs-next-gen-fighter/). That equates to $108,108,108.11 per individual F-47.

Interestingly, before the Trump Administration‚Äînot to mention¬†[Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC)](https://www.armed-services.senate.gov/)¬†Chairman¬†[Sen. Roger Wicker](https://www.wicker.senate.gov/biography)¬†(R-MS), himself a¬†[former USAF JAG officer](https://www.afjag.af.mil/)‚Äîchose to revive the NGAD program, it had been put on ‚Äústrategic pause‚Äù by the USAF brass.

One of the major factors driving the USAF‚Äôs initial skittishness about NGAD was its originally projected high price tag: a¬†[whopping $300 million](https://centerforsecuritypolicy.org/ngad-can-the-air-force-afford-a-300000000-fighter-jet/), nearly triple that of the already notoriously expensive F-35 Lightning II (which, like the F-22 mentioned above, is a 5th-generation fighter built by¬†[Lockheed Martin‚Äôs venerable Skunk Works division](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/who-we-are/business-areas/aeronautics/skunkworks.html)).

Judging by the $108M per-unit average cited in the previous paragraph, it looks like some accounting whiz figured out how to bring down the original estimated costs by nearly two-thirds, which‚Äôll undoubtedly¬†[please Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) Pete Hegseth](https://defensescoop.com/2025/04/23/dod-review-major-defense-acquisition-programs-hegseth-reforms-doge/).

# üõë 2. Rare Earths / Stellantis

* **Stellantis drama**¬†‚Üí slowed by management reshuffles, but ‚Äúback on track.‚Äù

   * Boeing Defense (BA):¬†Tied to future airframes, but less dominant than LMT/NOC here.

# üîë Strategic Read

* **If Mark teases ‚ÄúGen VI fighter + ScAl alloy‚Äù**¬†‚Üí that covers both NGAD variants (Air Force¬†**and**¬†Navy).
* The fact that he said¬†**‚Äúpartnership announcement soon‚Äù**¬†makes me lean¬†**Lockheed first**¬†‚Äî they‚Äôre usually the¬†*earliest in*¬†on novel alloys, and they have the Title III muscle to pull DoD along.

# NioCorp: The Strategic Basket

NioCorp‚Äôs Elk Creek Project isn‚Äôt just another mine ‚Äî it‚Äôs a¬†**national industrial base reset button**. With the U.S. defense and aerospace sector exposed to foreign choke points, Elk Creek‚Äôs mix of critical minerals lines up squarely with Pentagon and DOE priorities.

# üîë The Mineral Arsenal

* **Niobium (Nb)**¬†‚Äì The¬†*quiet giant*. From jet engines to superconductors, SMRs, and quantum systems, niobium is the alloy enabler. Elk Creek could supply a good portion ‚Äî potentially all ‚Äî of U.S. needs, ending dependence on Brazil.
* **Titanium (Ti & TiCl‚ÇÑ)**¬†‚Äì Backbone of airframes, missiles, and armor plating. TiCl‚ÇÑ doubles as a coatings precursor and is integral to stealth systems and chemical defense. A secure U.S. feedstock is essential.
* **Scandium (Sc & Sc-Al alloys)**¬†‚Äì¬†*The game-changer. Sc-Al alloys cut aircraft weight, extend combat radius, and enable Gen VI fighter designs. First scandium metal is targeted for November, with a DoD prime already working alongside NioCorp.*
* **Rare Earths (Nd/Pr, Dy, Tb)**¬†‚Äì The permanent magnet core for F-35s, drones, EVs, and Navy ships.¬†*Without them, electrification and defense propulsion grind to a halt. Elk Creek adds a U.S. stream for the most critical magnet REEs.*

# ‚ö° Why It Matters Now

* **Defense Assurance**¬†‚Üí Elk Creek minerals map directly to DFARS compliance, reducing single-source risk from China (REEs), Brazil (Nb), and Russia/Ukraine (Ti).
* **Industrial Transition**¬†‚Üí Aerospace, EVs, quantum, and clean energy all converge on the same supply gaps. Elk Creek is positioned as a multi-sector keystone.
* **Near-Term Catalysts**¬†‚Üí 2025 drilling added¬†**9 infill boreholes (+64% more core)**¬†plus 6 step-outs. Assays in mid-to-late October¬†could confirm a resource uplift across all minerals, raising production profiles before the Q4 Definitive Feasibility Study.

# [NioCorp\_Presentation.pdf](https://www.niocorp.com/wp-content/uploads/NioCorp_Presentation.pdf)

[NioCorp's Critical Minerals check all the boxes to make \\""STUFF!\\""](https://preview.redd.it/641b9ku2kipf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9e1befe8eb282901beb7efa203ecf80f17bb4ae)

**IMHO \~**¬†Following Monday (Sept. 8th) Wainwright presentation, NioCorp has entered its most critical phase yet. Mark Smith confirmed Phase 1 drilling is complete with assays due mid-to-late October, paving the way for a resource update and ***a Q4 Definitive Feasibility Study that could reset the scale across scandium, niobium, titanium, and rare earths. Titanium negotiations with three U.S. majors are advancing, Stellantis remains engaged on REEs, and two scandium metal demonstration paths with DoD are moving forward ‚Äî with first scandium metal targeted by November. Most significant: confirmation that a DoD prime is working directly with NioCorp on Sc-Al alloys for Gen VI fighters, marking Elk Creek as a true defense cornerstone.***

Strategically, the project now carries momentum few peers can match. Backing includes a $10M DoD Title III award, ongoing EXIM Bank financing engagement, and recognition across the CHIPS Act, DOE‚Äôs $1B critical minerals program, and DPA mandates. On Tuesday, Mark Smith underscored how Elk Creek‚Äôs niobium could help free the U.S. from reliance on Brazil, where supply represents a ‚ÄúSword of Damocles‚Äù over American industry.¬†**Pending drill results**, NioCorp may be in a position to supply a¬†**substantial portion ‚Äî if not all ‚Äî of U.S. niobium needs**, while scandium cements Elk Creek as the ‚ÄúSaudi Arabia‚Äù of next-gen alloys.

**Looking ahead, the RedChip presentation ‚Äî now rescheduled to Sept. 24th at 4:15PM EST ‚Äî is raising eyebrows. Why the delay?**¬†In context, it suggests management wants maximum visibility to align¬†**with key catalysts: \*\*\* DoD price-support talks mid-September??\*\*\***, drill results, or even a partnership reveal. With offtakes and defense ties already in motion, Elk Creek is no longer ‚Äújust a mine-in-the-making‚Äù ‚Äî it is fast becoming the flagship U.S. critical minerals project, uniquely positioned to deliver Sc, Nb, Ti, and REEs at scale. By 2028, NioCorp could redefine America‚Äôs resource independence.

***Seeing the ""Big-Picture"": NioCorp‚Äôs Elk Creek Project offers the U.S. a single-source solution for scandium, niobium, titanium, and magnet rare earths ‚Äî a mineral basket that secures defense supply chains, empowers next-gen aerospace and energy systems, and positions America for true industrial independence.***

# ‚Äî and it‚Äôs clear: NioCorp isn‚Äôt just about magnets. It‚Äôs part of the U.S. Critical Minerals Solution!

# ‚Äî A game-changer for American Resource Independence by 2028 and beyond.

# NioCorp = ""The¬†Flagship U.S. source¬†for multiple Critical Minerals!‚Äù

I talked to her about it several times. Not joking, like actual sit-down talks. Every time she‚Äôd either laugh it off or say she thought everything was ‚Äúours.‚Äù Meanwhile, she works full-time, goes out constantly, orders takeout whenever, but still clears out my fridge.

The thing is, I‚Äôm on a tight budget. My credit is already wrecked from mistakes I made when I was younger and I‚Äôm trying to rebuild while keeping to a strict budget. Every dollar matters. I cook at home, don‚Äôt go out much, and she eats the food I literally rely on.

After too many ignored talks, I snapped. I baked a tray of brownies, but laced them with a generous amount of laxatives. Left them in the fridge like they were mine for later. Of course, she helped herself.

That night she was in and out of the bathroom nonstop, swearing she had food poisoning from some bad takeout. I kept a straight face, offered her some water, and went to bed.

Since then, the food stealing has basically stopped. She might sneak the occasional bite, but it‚Äôs nothing like before. Part of me thinks she got exactly what she deserved, but another part wonders if I went too far.

So Reddit, am I the bad roommate here, or was that just fair payback?

My husband stood me up on the biggest night of my career--my first solo art exhibition.

I found him on the news, shielding another woman from a storm of cameras while the entire gallery watched my world collapse.

His text was a final, cold s**p in the face: ""Kacie needs me. You'll be fine.""

For years, he'd called my art a ""hobby,"" forgetting it was the foundation of his billion-dollar company. He had made me invisible.

So I called my lawyer with a plan to use his arrogance against him.

""Make the divorce papers look like a boring IP release form,"" I told her. ""He'll sign anything to get me out of his office.""


Chapter 1
Aryana's POV:

Tonight was supposed to be my night. My first solo gallery opening in downtown San Francisco. Not a small show in a coffee shop, but a real, career-making exhibition.

For four years, I'd been hiding in my studio, pouring my soul into charcoal and ink. For four years, I'd been the quiet, artistic wife of tech billionaire Cameron Oneill. Tonight, that was supposed to change. Tonight, I was finally going to be Aryana Mason.

But as I stood in the bright, crowded gallery, I felt the familiar chill of his absence. He wasn't here.

Then I saw it. A news alert, flashing on a stranger's phone.

My husband's face.

He was at a press conference, his powerful frame a fortress around another woman. Kacie Chavez. She looked fragile and artfully distressed. He looked like her protector.

The headline beneath the photo was a punch to the gut. A reporter was quoting him live. I couldn't hear the words, but I saw them in the gallery's hushed whispers and pitying glances. Everyone was watching my public humiliation in real time.

My own phone buzzed. A text from him, sent an hour ago.

Something came up. Kacie needs me. You'll be fine. Congrats.

I think that's when my heart finally gave up. It wasn't a dramatic shatter. It was more like a quiet click, the sound of a lock turning for the last time.

Brenton, the gallery owner, appeared at my side. He didn't have to ask. The evidence was glowing on a dozen screens around us. 

""I'm sorry, Aryana,"" he said, his voice a low growl of anger on my behalf. ""He's a f**l.""

""He's busy,"" I heard myself say. The lie was automatic, a reflex honed from years of practice.

""Come on,"" Brenton said, gently steering me toward a man in a tailored suit. ""The New York Times critic is here. This is still your night.""

I spent the next hour on autopilot. I smiled. I shook hands. I talked about my work.

Standing in front of a series of my earliest sketches, I felt a bitter irony. These were the whimsical, intricate designs that had become the soul of ""Aether,"" the app that made Cameron his first billion dollars. My art was literally the foundation of his empire.

He'd loved my art then. Or, at least, he'd loved what it could do for him. Now, he called it my hobby.

He hadn't just forgotten me tonight. He had erased me from his own story.

That was his biggest mistake.

""I need to make a phone call,"" I told Brenton, my voice impossibly steady. It's amazing how calm you can feel when you have absolutely nothing lef",2,1758022645.0,Novelnews,2,1.0,False

We all brush our teeth. We throw on deodorant. We pick clothes that make us look sharp. So why is washing and protecting our face still treated like it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot manly‚Äù? ü§®

Men‚Äôs skin isn‚Äôt cruising on autopilot. Daily dust, sweat, oil, pollution, and that brutal morning shave it‚Äôs basically a battlefield.

1nienyd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nienyd,De Librije (***) - 12/9/2025,"Last Friday, I finally had the chance to visit De Librije in Zwolle ‚Äì my very first 3 Michelin star experience. After visiting a few exceptional restaurants over the past years, this one had been high on my list for a while. In fact, we had booked this table more than a year in advance. Two months ago, we were contacted by the restaurant with the offer to move our booking to the Chef‚Äôs Table (at no extra cost) due to a cancellation. Of course, we said yes.

The Chef‚Äôs Table at De Librije is a bit different from what you might expect. It‚Äôs not tucked away in the kitchen but located right between the hot and cold sections, so you get a direct view of the kitchen in action while still being part of the dining room atmosphere. The best of both worlds.

Amuses
We started with three opening bites:
	‚Ä¢	A crispy broad bean with horseradish and young mustard ‚Äì the highlight of the three and one of the best snacks I‚Äôve had in a long time (8.5/10).
	‚Ä¢	Kohlrabi with verbena and wild herbs.
	‚Ä¢	The signature edible Librije rose, made of beetroot and lovage.

A very strong opening, perfectly setting the tone for the evening. (Photo 1)

‚ÄúPassport of Taste‚Äù
The first official course was called Passport of Taste, an homage to their suppliers. It featured passionfruit, aubergine, and pointed cabbage. The passionfruit, grown in the Netherlands by a wasabi farmer, was easily one of the most delicious things I‚Äôve ever eaten in my life. 10/10. (Photo 2)

Drunken Eggs
Kaviari caviar ‚Äúdrowned‚Äù in cherry, absorbing its flavor while keeping its own saline punch. Clever and fun, though not as memorable as other dishes. 8/10. (Photo 3)

Foie Gras
This was outstanding. Curious about sustainability (since foie gras is usually ethically problematic), I asked the staff how they approach it. They explained that the geese are raised in Hungary, where they keep the birds in complete darkness. The geese naturally think winter is coming and start eating heavily, which produces a full, rich liver without force-feeding. Ethically debatable, perhaps, but the result was sublime. 10/10. (Photo 4)

Langoustine
Perfectly cooked, beautifully balanced ‚Äì flavorful without being overshadowed by the garnish. 8.5/10. (Photo 5)

Weever Fish (Pieterman)
Rich, soft, and perfectly paired with green pepper. 8/10. (Photo 6)

North Sea Sole
This dish blew me away. I‚Äôve eaten sole plenty of times, always thinking of it as a delicate, soft fish ‚Äì but here it was full of structure and texture, cooked to perfection. Truly eye-opening and easily my favorite of the night. 10/10. (Photo 7)

Zeeland Knot
Nice, but not as memorable compared to the other dishes. 6/10. (Photo 8)

Sharing Signature Dishes
As five Dutch diners who still have a thrifty streak, we decided to share three of their famous signature dishes instead of ordering them all individually. The staff didn‚Äôt just allow it ‚Äì they made it fun and easy, setting the dishes and matching wines in the middle of the table and giving everyone cutlery and glasses. A simple but charming gesture. (Photo 11)
	‚Ä¢	Zander with apple syrup (on the menu since day one). Solid, but not mind-blowing. 7.5/10. (Photo 9)
	‚Ä¢	Sweetbreads with pineapple and peanuts. Absolutely phenomenal, especially with the Barolo pairing. One of the best sweetbread dishes I‚Äôve ever had. 10/10. (Photo 10)
	‚Ä¢	The iconic marigold egg with caviar and passionfruit. Ordered mostly because of its reputation, but it lived up to the hype. The combination of egg, caviar, and the hint of passionfruit was fantastic. 9/10. (Photo 12)

After this, we were offered a tour of the restaurant. We walked through the kitchen, into another room where a surprise dish was waiting: a piece of smoked pork belly, designed to mimic how poorer people in the past ate eel. Amazingly, it really did taste like eel. A brilliant historical nod. 9/10.

The tour continued into the wine cellar and finally into the room where they cultivate microgreens ‚Äì Jonnie Boer‚Äôs favorite place. They even had a small memorial space for him there, which was touching.

Venison
Back to the table for venison with wild garlic and elderflower. Beautifully cooked, but not at the same level as the best courses of the evening. 7/10. (Photo 13)

Desserts
	‚Ä¢	Chocolate with crayfish ‚Äì easily one of the strangest combinations I‚Äôve ever tasted, but it worked astonishingly well. 8.5/10. (Photo 14)
	‚Ä¢	Cold drip of wild blackberries ‚Äì pleasant, but the weakest course of the night. 6.5/10. (Photo 15)

Finally, we were guided to another room for coffee/tea and friandises ‚Äì fun little twists on classic Dutch sweets. A lighthearted and nostalgic ending. 8/10. (Photo 16)

All five of us took the wine pairing (five glasses). The standout was the Riesling served with the first courses ‚Äì truly fantastic. I had heard that De Librije is generous with refills, but I wasn‚Äôt expecting this generous. My glass was never empty, and the pours were anything but shy. For me, that‚Äôs an absolute must at this level.

We spent six hours at the table and never once felt rushed ‚Äì even when we were the very last guests in the restaurant at 00:30. The staff were warm, relaxed, and always willing to chat. Their hospitality really matched the food.

Final Thoughts
De Librije delivered everything I hoped for and more. As a first 3-star experience, it set the bar incredibly high. Highlights for me were the passionfruit, foie gras, sole, and sweetbreads ‚Äì but beyond individual dishes, it was the atmosphere, and the genuine hospitality that made it unforgettable.

1nienxz,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1nienxz/i_35m_feel_like_i_am_being_psychologically/,I [35M] feel like I am being psychologically tortured by my partner‚Äôs [34F] broken promises about sexual fantasies and have no idea why or what to do,"**tl:dr:** I have a sexual fantasy that my girlfriend assures me she is incredibly into, promises me we will do things and then cancels (over 20 times in a year). I have given her so many low pressure ways out if she isn't, and even told her we can just stop considering it and she has gone out of her way to talk me back into it only for nothing to happen. It is at the point where this is a major issue in our relationship as I feel like I'm being psychologically tortured for apparently no reason. 

This is an unusual one as I read here frequently and a lot of posts are about feeling pressured into doing something or pressuring partners into performing sexual fantasies and this is decidedly not that. I have made it very clear to her that if she isn‚Äôt into this, it‚Äôs fine, that thats okay, etc. but she repeatedly assures me she is super into it and that she‚Äôll make sure we do it but then nothing happens. It‚Äôs gone on so long and happened so many times I am at the point of genuine distress. I don‚Äôt know why this is happening, and I‚Äôm very confused.

Okay, so the long version is that I have a sharing / hotwifing fantasy. I realise fully that this is a major thing and that nobody has any duty to fulfil any fantasy they don‚Äôt want to. I‚Äôd say to add to that, that for me to enjoy it at all I need enthusiastic consent, to feel like this is a fun adventure that we‚Äôre both on as a couple and that I‚Äôm not just forcing my partner to do something just to make me happy. If that were the case then I‚Äôd just much rather not do it or think about it at all. 

Just over a year ago, she said she wanted to try it for real, and unlike a lot of the horror stories on here, it actually went super well. I thoroughly enjoyed myself, the other guy did and unless she is a fantastic liar or actor she did too. She brought it up afterwards how much she enjoyed it without me prompting or bringing it up. Some time went by, and while we talked about what had happened I didn‚Äôt raise wanting to do it again - I thought I would leave that ball in her court. She eventually said she would want to, with the same guy again, and so texted him - but when the time came she was tired from work so cancelled. This is fine, that is a fully valid reason not to want to do it. A little while passes and he texts her to rearrange and she organises a time, but then the day comes and she has a headache so again she cancels. Again, fully understandable. 

I don‚Äôt want to get into the full weeds of it - but over the past 12 months or so, she has planned and then flaked, saying she‚Äôs going to do something and then not following through or whatever in the manner above (with the guy we originally did, a few old FWBs and people off apps) around maybe 20 different times? All the reasons for cancelling or not following through are understandable in themselves but 20 ‚Äúheadaches‚Äù, ‚Äútired after work‚Äù, ‚Äúfeeling stressed because of x,y,z‚Äù is not very believable. At first I was fine with this - but then as time went on it started to get to me, because I would be getting repeatedly excited that something is going to happen and then it‚Ä¶ not. To be honest, it was at the point where both the first guy we did it with, and one of her old FWBs both stopped texting her back because she had flaked so many times that was around when I also started getting privately unhappy with the situation. 

For a long time, over these 10 months, I didn‚Äôt say or hint anything at all, I was very understanding. A few times, I casually mentioned to her after cancellations if she wasn't into it then that was okay. But then one of these cancellations happened just over 3 months ago and I just pointedly sat her down and asked her. I made sure to go about it in a low pressure, open way but just said ‚Äúare you not into this? Because it feels like you aren‚Äôt, and that‚Äôs absolutely fine. You don‚Äôt have to be. I‚Äôd be a little bit bummed but I‚Äôd rather we‚Äôre both on the same page and no one is unhappy‚Äù. She was emphatic and repeatedly reassured me that she was super into it and wanted to do it. So I asked her about the pattern of cancellations - and she denied that there was any pattern and said that they all had understandable reasons. I tried to force the issue that 20 is a bit ridiculous but she was having none of it, so I left it. We ended the conversation with her pointedly assuring me that she would put more effort in and something would happen soon.

Fast forward to 1 month ago, 2 more cancellations and nothing had happened. So I sat her down and basically dictated to her. Look, I think we should take this idea off the table. I don‚Äôt know what, but something is going on and you don‚Äôt seem happy or want to do it. Which again, is fully okay. Obviously the best world would be one in which we were both into this and we do it. The next best world would be if we decide that one of us fully isn‚Äôt into it and we don‚Äôt do it - but the worst world by some margin is where I am led to believe that we are into it and things are going to happen and I am constantly disappointed. At this point, even though I was set on abandoning it, she talked me back into it - saying that she realised she hadn‚Äôt organised it very well and maybe if I did the setup and planning for meeting up, that would be better, she would be into it and excited. 

About a week ago I messaged someone, I told her I had done that and the response I received was a very monotone ‚Äòmmmm cool‚Äô. Which really didn‚Äôt assuage any of my doubts but I left it. The person messaged me back and I told her that they had replied and got a flat ‚Äòexciting‚Äô before she immediately changed the subject. So, Friday evening comes around and by this point to be honest I am quite emotional. She told me if I did the legwork she would be excited but she barely responded, hasn‚Äôt brought it up herself and hasn‚Äôt asked a single question about it, not even in a ‚Äònon-excited‚Äô way. I don‚Äôt really understand what the fuck is happening. I have been led on and let down so many times. I‚Äôve given her low pressure ways out if she wants to take it. I‚Äôve even taken the decision unilaterally to stop doing this, and was talked back into it by her. 

So I just flat-out tell her, we‚Äôre not doing this anymore. I am taking the final decision on this. You won‚Äôt explain or be honest with me about what‚Äôs happening but I can tell there‚Äôs something not right so we‚Äôre not doing it. I honestly just wanted this to be a fun, low-stakes, naughty secret that we did together as a couple but at this point it is causing me immense amounts of emotional distress. She gets incredibly emotional and says, once again, she is super into and that she thought she had made an effort to show me how into she was. I asked her to tell me in bullet point form what she had done but she couldn‚Äôt, and just kept reiterating that she thought she had made an effort. We kept going in circles on this point for quite some time. When we calmed down a bit, once again she talked me back into wanting to do it, and told me that she was emotionally spent from the argument we‚Äôd had, but that tomorrow morning she would show some excitement.

You can probably see where this is going. Tomorrow morning comes, I wake up and she‚Äôs gone out of bed to go shopping. We eat breakfast. We have some coffee. We listen to a podcast together. We show each other animal videos off social media. It is now noon. I take a shower. I have some work to do over the weekend so tell her I‚Äôm getting prepared to go out. She hasn‚Äôt done anything. By this point I‚Äôm fucking fuming. I explode at her, shouting about how many promises and false statements she‚Äôs given me, how I feel like she‚Äôs lying to me though I don‚Äôt know why. All she could say to me was that ‚Äòshe was about to do it‚Äô right before I started getting angry. Really? The entire morning? There were so many opportunities. We were up and awake for 4 hours. She waited until I was walking out the door? Get real.

I really don‚Äôt understand. Saying I feel lied to is an understatement. Gaslighted? I genuinely feel like I'm being psychologically tortured. The effect this has had on me is gradual but is now quite severe. I really doubt quite a lot of what she says to me. My libido is quite frankly in the toilet. I have very little sex drive whatsoever. I feel like my world is spinning constantly. To be honest, I never really get angry at all. If anything a problem in relationship for me historically is that I've been too calm and quite a pushover. So the scale of my emotional and angry reaction to this is at least telling me that something weird is going on because I *never* feel like this. 

I guess my questions or requests for advice are twofold:

- Can anyone explain her behaviour? This actually makes no sense to me. I've been patient, I've been kind. I have given her ways out. I've been talked back into it even when I wanted to leave it. I'm at my wits end. 

- What would you do here? I've honestly lost all sense of perspective on this, I feel dizzy with all the mixed messaging.",2,1758021624.0,relationship_advice,30,0.58,False

But little by little, she started eating my food. First it was milk for her coffee, then eggs, then entire packs of chicken or my snacks I‚Äôd been saving.

Let‚Äôs just say karma hit fast. She spent the entire night running back and forth from the bathroom, moaning about food poisoning. I played dumb, offered her some water, and kept a straight face while she cursed whatever ‚Äúbad takeout‚Äù she thought she ate.

1niejcs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Habits/comments/1niejcs/i_applied_atomic_habits_for_3_months_heres_what/,"I applied ""Atomic Habits"" for 3 months - here's what worked and what didn't","Three months ago, I decided to properly implement the Atomic Habits system instead of just reading about it. Instead of just reading it and moving on, I decided to actually test his methods for a full 3 months

Here's my honest breakdown of what actually moved the needle vs. what was overhyped.

What WORKED incredibly well:

1. Habit stacking was a game changer 

The concept was to attach new habits to existing ones using ""After I \[current habit\], I will \[new habit\].""

So to implement this principle ""After I pour my morning coffee, I will read for 10 minutes."" It worked for me because I was already making coffee every day, so I didn't need to remember a new trigger. The habit piggybacked on something automatic.

2. The 2-minute rule eliminated my excuses 

The idea with this was tart with a version that takes less than 2 minutes.

What I did:

* ""Exercise for 30 minutes"" became ""Put on workout clothes""
* ""Read a book"" became ""Read one page""
* ""Meditate for 20 minutes"" became ""Sit on my meditation cushion""

I couldn't procrastinate on something that took literally 2 minutes. Once I started, I usually kept going. For some people they struggle with this I think you just have to turn off your brain when it starts to whine. Because that's what I did that made it work.

3. Environment design was ridiculously effective The concept: Make good habits obvious and bad habits invisible.

So what I did was:

* Put a book on my pillow (so I'd see it before bed)
* Kept workout clothes next to my bed
* Moved my phone charger to the kitchen (so I wouldn't scroll in bed)

The result I found was I stopped relying on willpower and let my environment do the work. Which honestly helps me because I'm a chronic procrastinator.

4. Identity-based habits stuck better 

I tried it and implemented this mindset: Instead of ""I want to read 12 books this year"" I said: ""I'm someone who reads daily"". Every time I read, even for 5 minutes, I was proving to myself that I was ""a reader."" It became part of who I am.

What DIDN'T work (or was harder than expected):

1. Tracking everything became overwhelming.

James Clear suggests tracking habits, so I tracked 5 different habits daily. This went wrong because the tracking became a chore. I'd forget to mark things down, then feel guilty, then abandon the whole system.

What I learned was to track 1-2 habits max instead. More than that becomes administrative work.

2. The habit scorecard felt judgmental

The ideas was to List all your current habits and rate them as positive, negative, or neutral.

It made me hyper-aware of every ""bad"" habit and created unnecessary guilt. I'd rate ""checking social media"" as negative, then feel bad every time I did it. I realized focusing on adding good habits instead of cataloging all my flaws was a better option.

3. Implementation intentions were hit or miss

This didn't work though the ideas was simple: Plan exactly when and where you'll do your habit: ""I will \[behavior\] at \[time\] in \[location\].""

What happened instead was life doesn't always cooperate with rigid schedules. When my planned time didn't work out, I'd skip the habit entirely instead of adapting. Instead I did flexible habit stacking that could move around my day. Which helped me more.

4. The plateau of latent potential was real 

Results often lag behind effort you might not see progress for weeks, then suddenly breakthrough. Even knowing this intellectually, I still got discouraged during the ""valley of disappointment"" phase. Some habits took 6+ weeks before I saw real benefits.

My biggest discoveries:

* Starting stupid small beats starting ambitious. Reading 1 page daily led to reading 20+ books. Putting on workout clothes led to working out 4x/week. The 2-minute rule isn't a trick a it's psychology that works.
* Environment beats motivation. every time I wasted years trying to build willpower. Changing my environment did more in 3 months than years of ""trying harder."" I was surprised by this.
* Identity change is the real goal. The habits that stuck were the ones that made me feel like I was becoming someone new, not just doing different things.

What I'm keeping from the book:

* Habit stacking for new habits
* 2-minute rule for getting started
* Environment design instead of relying on willpower
* Identity-based thinking (""I'm someone who..."")
* Simple tracking (1 habit at a time)

What I modified:

* Flexible timing instead of rigid implementation intentions
* Focus on systems without obsessing over every detail
* Progress over perfection mindset

3 months later:

I'm reading 30 minutes daily, working out 4x/week, and meditating most days. More importantly, these feel automatic now instead of forced.

The book's core insight is true about how small changes compound into remarkable results. But you have to actually apply the methods, not just read about them.

Good luck!

It's been seven weeks and I'm still trying, but it's getting harder...long story ahead, if anyone has any advice please let me know!","TL/DR: I've tried everything I can think of: hundreds of fliers distributed in three rounds, following up leads with traps and trail cameras, even hiring someone to come with a dog to sniff out where the cat might be, but so far I've had no confirmed sightings.

**The Story:**

In mid 2020, I adopted my Little Man to be my indoor/outdoor companion and mouser. I live in a very wooded area in the Northeast US surrounded by 3000 acres of state forest with camps and some other permanent residents scattered around. He cuddled with me for coffee every morning, brought the dog and I ""mice treats"" once in a while, and joined in on my walks with the dog. (YES, I walked my cat!)

We were both really attached to one another. (If I'd leave the house without him, he'd yowl and try to follow!)

On July 28th, I saw my little man for the last time on our morning walk. I started to become nervous when I didn't see him that evening and began to search the next morning.

I walked and called around all day that day, talked to the neighbors 1/2 a mile away, and searched the woods and camp structures within a 1000 foot radius of my house... nothing. I had driven to a friend's house the afternoon before, and started to worry he may have been in my truck, so went back to that friend's home and called around, as well.

After a few days I ordered my first round of fliers and distributed them over a mile or so radius to all the houses and camps.

I cried on and off those first two weeks. I have two other cats and have been loving on them dearly, but it just wasn't the same without my boy. On August 15th I broke down sobbing, ready to let go.

On August 16th I got a call from someone saying they saw him about a mile West-Southwest (WSW) of my house. I placed two trail cameras and two traps for a few days but got nothing. On the 18th I got a call from someone about a mile North-Northeast (NNE) of my house. I moved traps there, caught a few cats that weren't mine who live in the area, but no sign of my boy.

I sent out another round of fliers that week, got a few more calls from people saying they saw a cat that looked like mine, but they were all over the place within my target area.... some close to the NNE location, some close to the WSW location and some random throughout.

On the 23rd someone sent a grainy, night time trail camera photo near the NNE location that very well could have been my cat, but he wouldn't let me search his property! I refocused my efforts in that area and still - amidst a lot of cats and possums and raccoons - no sign of my Little Dude.

The first week of September I contacted a specialty pet tracking service to bring their dog in to look for scent. In advance I put out another round of fliers in an even wider area and got a few more leads.

The dog found no scent anywhere other than the NNE location, which is en route to my aforementioned friend's home, so this is currently the working theory: that he was in or on my truck and hopped out at the stop sign at the intersection were the strongest scent was.

The dog handler was here on September 10th and helped narrow down my search area, but I have still not had any proof of life or reliable sightings. The tracking dog got the scent off a toy I had saved that my cat loved and picked up scent around my house six weeks after the cat went missing, so the scent at the NNE location could still all be from the day he went missing.

\--

Yesterday I decided I could no longer keep checking live traps twice a day and spent $350 on three cellular trail cameras, placed in a triangle around the center of the location the tracking dog picked up scent in that NNE area. I woke several times last night and compulsively refreshed the trail camera app, then woke up this morning weeping.

20+ years ago I was a soldier in Iraq, and I have been treating this like a rescue mission, refusing to give up, willing to do whatever it takes... but I'm running out of ideas and hope is draining even though the dedication is not.

If anyone has ANY ideas I could implement, please let me know. This is SO hard.

So as i was saying the two guys followed me to the same exact school. In the first day they were like ""yo bro where did you get us"" ""tf is this place"" and i was like bro you chose to follow if you didn't like it why you followed me? Anyways the next day we went again just to find our departments/classes and then left.

 We are in the same class. Some things started going wrong and i need your opinions. I am a pretty good person and pretty like in face but the only problem is that i have acne but the best part is the acne is like soft and light so doesn't ruin my face. And before days they start yelling at me to get a specific hair style but i was telling them i don't want because the hairstyle I'm doing nowdays is better and im getting compliments.

 Then i started to realise these guys wanted the bad for me. When I talked with the other members of the group they all agreed but not only in the hairstyle piece and many more things that happened. Today (Tuesday) because im sitting alone so i can lock in this school year and they are back from me every time they were laughing and saying that i look like afk player and I'm not moving at all (all this btw bc these days are that we are meeting the teachers) then one of them gave me a slap back to my neck so he can show whos is he to the other classmates.

 Then when it was the break i got to them and started saying that get a life you only talking about me and how am I be sitting and ONLY talking for me either for our new classmates (btw the new classmates are way better than them). Then one of them said ironically ""do you need coffee? Because you don't seem well"". 
After the break we got to the class and the other guy had thr small Lazer thing that you can buy from mini markets and started pointing it to my eye. I was going to cry out loud but i said to my self just wait. Then I realised the things that one of then were doing to me didn't do it to the other one guy (next to him) im very uncomfortable.

You can imagine what that does to a life.

I made rounds. I put magnets on the fridge: **Mom‚Äî7am**, **Dad‚Äînoon**, **Abby‚Äî5pm**. I learned to ‚Äúdeposit‚Äù time‚Äîsit with someone for an hour and buy them a safer evening. Fights are withdrawals. If I look at you with contempt, the years move faster. So I practiced looking kindly even when I wasn‚Äôt.

People tried to help. Neighbors sat with my mother. Friends took my dad to lunch. It didn‚Äôt matter. They came home looking normal. The second I turned my back, time tested the seam again.

My sister, Abby, didn‚Äôt believe me until finals. She lived at the library three days. When I unlocked her door, she stepped into the hall with a thin white streak in her hair you could twist with two fingers. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt freak out,‚Äù she said, voice huskier. I didn‚Äôt. I added magnets.

We learned stupid, tender hacks. I‚Äôd wave through windows if I had to run outside. I‚Äôd read to my mom while she showered so she wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúunseen‚Äù behind a door. I ate in doorways. The house became a lighthouse and I learned the turn of the beam.

There were mistakes.

When my aunt stopped talking to us after a fight, I told myself the rule didn‚Äôt apply because I wasn‚Äôt *trying* to avoid her. It did. Two months later we let ourselves into her place with the lockbox key. She hadn‚Äôt died; it‚Äôs not that story. She just‚Ä¶ *skipped*. The TV was on birdsong videos. Her voice said my mother‚Äôs name like a question from someone twice as tired. I visit her every other day now. Soup helps nothing except people, which turns out to be enough.

When my cousin had a baby, I stared until my eyes watered. I went to the porch to take a call. I was gone nine minutes. When I came back, the newborn had a fan of crow‚Äôs-feet that only shows when he scrunches his nose. He‚Äôs perfect. He‚Äôll carry those nine minutes all his life. I am learning to live with that.

Sometimes the worst part is people needing dark. My father did it on a Tuesday. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just nap,‚Äù he said, and closed his eyes. I went to the garage for a hinge tool. When I came back he wasn‚Äôt asleep; he was *refusing*. A little older. A soft click behind his eyes, like a lock you can‚Äôt pick. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here,‚Äù I said. He opened his eyes and let time behave again. Much later, he told me he didn‚Äôt want my life to be nothing but rounds.

‚ÄúHow else should I live?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúA lighthouse is a good life.‚Äù

We laughed. We ate soup. I reset the magnets.

I keep a card above the table now:

* **Look on purpose.** Deposits count more if I mean them.
* **No long doors.** If you close one, I sit on the mat and read.
* **Return, even embarrassed.** Absence is a slow saw.
* **Make the look a good one.** Anger still counts; kindness buys more.

Last week, Abby took a two-day beach trip with her husband. I hit every slot at home. Mom dozed. The battery clock ticked in a forgivable way. I slept in the chair by her door‚Äîfeet flat, so I could stand fast. The house smelled like detergent. The minutes behaved.

When Abby texted **coffee?**, I met her at the corner cafe. She looked rung out and sun-soft. For a second I saw a double exposure‚ÄîAbby at seventy: salt-white at the temple, a groove where worry dries‚Äîand then the present settled back over her like a fitted sheet.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù she laughed. ‚ÄúDo I have sand on me?‚Äù

‚ÄúI saw you,‚Äù I said, and stopped.

She touched my wrist. ‚ÄúI saw you, too. Old for a second. Yellow sweater you don‚Äôt own yet.‚Äù

So we sat there stupidly and drank our coffee slowly and *looked*, the way you look at a painting you‚Äôll forget as soon as you go outside. When I got home, I stood in the doorway and watched my mother sleeping on the couch. Her mouth hung open. The soft snore of someone who trusts you filled the room like a small engine that never stalls.

People ask for the cause, as if a clean noun would make it livable. There isn‚Äôt one. There‚Äôs only practice. Cross the street. Wave through glass. Touch the frame when you leave. Come back even when you‚Äôre ashamed to. If you‚Äôre me: stop trying to be a hero and just *be there*. If you‚Äôre not me: you can‚Äôt help, except with soup. Bring soup anyway.

My dream ends the same every time: I‚Äôm on the porch counting windows, waiting for Abby, and I see her at every age as she walks up the path‚Äîfist like a plum; knees scabbed; teenager with a secret; woman with our parents‚Äô key; old woman in the yellow sweater. It isn‚Äôt sad. It‚Äôs a litany. The beam turns, writes its clean line on the water, leaves, and comes back.

Before bed I add one more line to the card:

Today is my annual **Happiness Audit**.  
The alarm went off at 7 a.m. sharp, playing a delightful birdsong. My smart mattress, based on my sleep data from last night, automatically adjusted me to the *""optimal waking angle.""* In the kitchen, the coffee machine had already brewed my coffee, and the toaster had popped up a perfectly browned piece of whole-wheat bread with a smiley face pattern.  

Everything was good. **Everything had to be good.**  
Because my *""happiness""* had to be **quantified**.  

The doorbell rang. I took a deep breath, practiced the *""standard joy""* smile I had spent weeks perfecting in the mirror, and opened the door.  

The **Happiness Inspector** stood there. He didn't speak, but I knew his name was John. It's John every year.  
This year's John was no different from the previous few Johns. He wore a non-descript gray uniform and the same non-descript, standardized, pleasant smile. In his hand, he carried a silver briefcase.  

> ‚ÄúGood morning, Citizen #734,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI hope you‚Äôre having another positive-energy-filled morning.‚Äù  

‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù I replied with a smile, trying to make my voice sound like it was full of sunshine and bubbles. ‚ÄúEvery day is happier than the last.‚Äù  

---

The audit began.  
He opened the briefcase, and the familiar machine, composed of countless sensors and probes, was placed on my dining table. I expertly placed my fingers into the designated slots.  

> ‚ÄúAlright, let‚Äôs begin.‚Äù John looked at the data on the screen and started asking questions.  
> ‚ÄúAccording to our records, your **‚Äòaverage smile curvature‚Äô** for the last quarter has decreased by **7%** compared to the previous one. Our data model suggests this may be related to potential **‚Äòexistential anxiety.‚Äô** Please explain this discrepancy.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, that,‚Äù I had my answer ready. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs because I‚Äôve started practicing a new, more introverted form of meditation. My inner self is, in fact, more ecstatic than ever.‚Äù I put on a perfect smile, but my legs were trembling.  

> ‚ÄúVery good. Noted.‚Äù John nodded. ‚ÄúNext question. Your **smart toilet** reports three instances of **‚Äòirregular bowel movements‚Äô** last month. This is often associated with **‚Äòsuppressed anger.‚Äô** Do you have any comment?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs because I was trying a new high-fiber recipe,‚Äù I continued to smile. ‚ÄúIt presented my digestive system with a small, yet surprising challenge.‚Äù  

> ‚ÄúA very reasonable explanation. Noted.‚Äù  

‚ÄúFinal question, Citizen #734. We received an anonymous tip from your office‚Äôs **‚Äòsmart coffee machine.‚Äô** It alleges that on Tuesday morning, you directed a **0.7-second audio waveform**, identifiable as a **‚Äòsigh,‚Äô** at a cup of coffee that was **‚Äòbelow standard concentration.‚Äô** As you know, a **‚Äòsigh‚Äô** is a level-one alert for **‚Äòhappiness depletion.‚Äô** Did you, at that time, genuinely feel dissatisfied with the coffee?‚Äù

John stared at me, smiling, but it made my hair stand on end.  

My back was instantly drenched in cold sweat.  
I stared into John‚Äôs hollow, pleasant eyes, my brain racing.  

‚Äú‚Ä¶No,‚Äù I finally answered, in a tone full of *‚Äòepiphany‚Äô* and *‚Äòjoy.‚Äô* ‚ÄúThat wasn‚Äôt a sigh. That was‚Ä¶ a soulful, contented exhalation, which I emitted after tasting the coffee and experiencing a moment of **unparalleled bliss**.‚Äù  

John looked at me in silence.  
The indicator light on the instrument switched from **red** back to **green**.  

> ‚Äú‚Ä¶A very creative explanation. Citizen #734, congratulations.‚Äù  

He packed up the instrument, the same standardized smile on his face.  
‚ÄúYour annual happiness index is **87**. **You‚Äôve passed.**‚Äù  

I breathed a sigh of relief, feeling like I had just won a war in a hail of bullets.  

---

As he was about to leave, I called out to him, driven by a post-traumatic curiosity.  

‚ÄúMr. John, I‚Äôve always wanted to ask‚Ä¶ those people, I mean, if someone‚Äôs happiness index doesn‚Äôt meet the standard, what happens to them?‚Äù  

John stopped, turned around, and spoke to me in his usual friendly, flat tone, the one you‚Äôd use to explain recycling.  

> ‚ÄúOh, we don‚Äôt **‚Äòpunish‚Äô** them. Punishment creates negative energy. That would go against our society‚Äôs core values.‚Äù  
> **‚ÄúWe ‚Äòrecycle‚Äô them.‚Äù**

He pointed at the **‚ÄúJoyful Living‚Äù nutritional bar**, distributed for free by the community every day, which I had left on the table after breakfast.  

> ‚ÄúJust like this nutritional bar, sir!‚Äù he said with a smile. ‚ÄúThey become the most efficient, organic raw material to nourish those who are happy.‚Äù  
> **‚ÄúAfter all, dedicating one‚Äôs entire being to the collective happiness of the community‚Ä¶ isn‚Äôt that the happiest thing of all?‚Äù**

Smiling, he also took a bar from his bag. He took a bite with a crunch. I saw it clearly.  
The bar was no different from mine. The only difference was, on the small packaging, the back said **Happiness**, and the front said‚Ä¶

I don‚Äôt buy into fads as easily though, so wanted to do my due diligence first.¬†

The first hurdle I came across was obviously grind type, like not all grinders are created equal. Burr vs. blade, flat vs. conical-there‚Äôs *a lot* more to it than I expected. So obviously, I went deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole, tried a couple myself, asked some barista friends and came up with a little list if you‚Äôre thinking about getting a grinder. Just wanted all my info put down in one place.¬†

[**Fellow Gen 2 Ode**](https://grassrouteguide.com/dp-B0BLRMCM9Y)¬†

This one‚Äôs designed to really fine tine the grind. The thing with buying store bought grounds is that you kinda get used to the extraction they give and honestly, after trying super fine beans, there‚Äôs definitely a difference. There‚Äôs a much deeper flavour to be had, much more intense if you will. The Fellow grinder has about 10 or so main settings and a lot more micro-adjustments you can make, you can really hone in on the perfect grind size for whatever brewing method you prefer, like drip coffee, molka pots etc. It also has anti-static tech to keep your counter clean, so there isn‚Äôt powder everywhere (especially if you have pets). But honestly, I would recommend using a lighter roast for fine grinds, the darker ones become a little too intense.

[**ChefWave Conical Burr**](https://grassrouteguide.com/dp-B08246XFTQ8)¬†

If you just want a solid grinder that gets the job done without overcomplicating things, the ChefWave is a great choice. It has a built-in timer, so you don‚Äôt have to guess how long to grind, and it‚Äôs compact enough not to take up too much counter space. No fancy settings, just an easy way to get consistently ground coffee every morning. Hey, its much much cheaper than the Fellow (did that on purpose, wanted to have something more budget bargain in the list) so you can‚Äôt really expect all the different settings and grinds. But for what it is, it's solid.¬†

Now by the end of all of this, I still don‚Äôt know if it's worth the hassle everyday, but once in a while, taking the time to grind and prep does make lazy sundays a little more rewarding, at least in my opinion.¬†",1,1758020699.0,u_NoSecretary8990,0,1.0,False
1niedld,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1niedld,Weekend at Docker and a Kompas 6 pack,"Docker 10 years, 10 new beers
Our local brewery Docker has celebrated their 10 year anniversary, for which I they made 10 new beers (though I only tried 6).
Left to right, top to bottom: Spice lager, Braggot, Pomona DDH NEIPA, Grodziskie, West Coast IPA, Baltic Porter

Generally all above average brews, though the porter was the most exceptional (sat on oak chips and enriched with whiskey made from their old brew). Spice lager was interesting but kinda disappointing (expected harsher spice notes, tasted more like a light lager with some corriander and some less distinct spice notes), the braggot was really nice with strong yeast and sweet notes, NEIPA and West Coast are just very good representations of their respective styley, while Grodziskie was good but not my cup of tea (too mellow to really 'feel' anything, but not enough to just ""crush"" it).

Kompas 6 pack
Left to right, top to bottom
Ah Toy (California Commons), Tricycle (Extra Pale Ale), Konstantin (Pale Ale), Rosi (DIPA), Sgt. Stubby (Pre-prohibition Lager), Horsman (Porter)

General impression is they are all competently brewed, but playing it a little too safe. They are all ""stock"", with some personal brewer's touch. Ah Toy had a lot of yeast and Centennial hop taste, with some more fruity notes. 
Trycicle is very refreshing, like a cleaned-up session IPA, liked it a lot.
Konstantim had a weirdly fluffy mouthfeel, like blotchy foam in a lemonade, which paired nicely with the floral-grapefruit taste.
Rosi is just kinda a normal DIPA, nothing I couldn't say about a different one.
Horsman was pretty pretty creamy, some coffee notes, but itwas more chocolate-y. Also some lactose-like sweetness as well.
Sgt. Stubby was defenitely the stand-out, pre-prohibition lagers are not something I see attempted often. I am not a big fan of the spicy taste that comes from wheat usually, but here it's well balanced and subdued, which adds a lot. Some minimal corn-like taste made me think there was corn lol.

Cops Just Found the Body.,"I‚Äôve been a writer for quite some time now. I can still remember being a kid in elementary school and hearing my first scary story. Man, from that moment on, I was completely hooked. I looked for these stories like crack, and very quickly they became the only thing I was listening to constantly.

Naturally, already excelling at English, once I discovered these new forms of creative expression, it was only a matter of time before I tried my hand at it myself.

I felt as though I had a general grasp on what a good story should look like; I knew to pay attention to pacing, make things natural, and, most importantly, felt I knew how to paint an artful, albeit graphic picture.

That being said, I recently wrote a story regarding murder. More specifically, the murder of an elderly jogger who just so happened to be a key witness in the story. He was set to testify against some important people in court, and I was tasked with tying up some loose ends, if you know what I mean.

Listen, I was trying to write a crime novel, alright? I‚Äôm not Agatha Christie, I just figured I‚Äôd give some mystery writing a try. Anyway, I‚Äôm getting sidetracked.

Basically, as he ran his normal route, as he did every morning; I drove up about a mile ahead of him and set up some ultra-thin metal wire that stretched from one tree to another horizontally across the path. Directly at the neck level for our ‚Äúkey witness‚Äù.

As I mentioned, I was trying to write a crime novel, so I had written my character as this sort of private eye/ mercenary type deal- listen, I already told you I‚Äôm not Agatha Christie, I‚Äôm a horror writer at heart- but I say this because I made my character do research, right? I made him know his stuff is what I‚Äôm saying.

More specifically, I made him know that this elderly jogger ran at an average pace of 6 miles an hour and that his neck would be exactly 5 feet and 4 inches from the ground.

All that ‚Äúknowing‚Äù I did, yet, as I watched the jogger slam into the wire and get clotheslined to his butt, the blood wasn‚Äôt coming out at nearly the speed I thought it would.

In fact, the jogger just sat there, rubbing his neck and becoming absolutely flabbergasted as he drew his hand back from his throat revealing watery red blood coating his palm.

In a state of animalistic fear after noticing the wire, his eyes darted around wildly as he rose to his feet.

Afraid of my target's escape, I quickly jumped from the bush where I hid, waiting to take a picture of him upon the job's completion.

His eyes lit up with fear as I knocked him back down to his back, quickly analyzing the area to make sure no one was around.

As the old man struggled to get up, I unhooked the wire from one of the trees and wrapped it around his neck.

I pulled as hard as I could and heard flesh tearing and veins ripping as the man's struggling grunts turned to gurgles, and the sound of wet flopping filled the air.

Once his feet stopped kicking and his body went completely limp, I removed the wire from around his neck. He was nearly decapitated as he lay there on the vacant walking trail. The sounds of nature continued, and birds sang to the backdrop of gently trickling water from a nearby stream as the man's blood leaked further and further down the concrete.

As I said, my character had to take photos upon the job's completion, so that‚Äôs what he did.

I snapped a few shots from various angles before rolling up the wire and hurrying back to my old Volkswagen, completely covered in blood.

Again, I AM NOT A MYSTERY WRITER.

Like, I didn‚Äôt even put the effort into thinking about all the DNA evidence to be collected from the scene, the amount of witnesses that could‚Äôve been around in such a public space, and don‚Äôt even get me started on the fact that he just, what? Left the old man there on the trail for people to find and alert authorities? Fuck, man, like pick a lane, right?

See, that‚Äôs exactly what I thought too.

And that‚Äôs exactly why I DELETED that story. Moved it to the trash bin immediately after reading it, utterly ashamed of myself, I must say.

I 100 percent planned on just calling it a night, and picking up on a new horror story the next day.

As I lay in bed and drifted into sleep, it felt as though my eyes were closed for mere moments before the booming sound of knocks came thumping from my front door. Sunlight filled my room, and as I groggily made my way towards the door, the rhythmic knocking abruptly stopped.

I crept up and checked the peephole to find no one there.

When I opened the door, there wasn‚Äôt even anyone in the hallway; however, there were some Polaroid photos placed carefully on my welcome mat.

They were of the old man, exactly how I had imagined him and exactly how I‚Äôd mutilated him. All taken from the exact angles as the story.

I couldn‚Äôt even move for a brief moment as I stared down at them, disgusted at how they decorated the mat.

I quickly gathered my thoughts, however, and scooped up each of the 6 photos.

Lying them out on the coffee table, I sat down on the couch with a ‚Äúthis can‚Äôt possibly be happening‚Äù look on my face, and my head fell into my hands as the realization hit me.

I flipped on the TV and turned to the news just in time to see the headline:

KEY WITNESS IN HUMAN TRAFFICKING CASE FOUND DEAD ON WALKING TRAIL IN ATLANTA

‚ÄúWelp,‚Äù I thought to myself. ‚ÄúIt was fun while it lasted.‚Äù

The boy stood at the edge of the driveway, one sneaker pressed against the iron gate, watching dust rise in lazy swirls from the street. The town felt like every other place he had been dragged to before: the same faded houses, the same cracked sidewalks, the same air that smelled faintly of rain-soaked soil and something forgotten.

And then she appeared.

She was walking down the street with another girl, a step behind as though she preferred to listen rather than lead. Her hair, cut short and careless, caught the last of the sun. Round glasses framed her face, and behind them her eyes seemed to catch everything ‚Äî the shape of the houses, the weight of the day, even him, standing there pretending not to stare.

She laughed at something her friend said, her smile bright but unforced, the kind of smile that seemed to belong more to the world than to her. For a moment, he forgot the dust, the boredom, the resentment of yet another move. For a moment, there was only her.

When she noticed him, it wasn‚Äôt dramatic. No sudden pause, no whispered comment to her friend. Just a quick glance, steady and curious, before she walked on. But that glance lingered long after she was gone, as if she had left something behind in the air between them.

The next evening, he saw her again. Alone this time. She walked slower, her notebook tucked under her arm, humming softly to herself. He stayed at the window, the curtain half-pulled, his heart oddly quickening at the sight of her. He told himself it was coincidence. He told himself it didn‚Äôt matter. But when she turned the corner and vanished, he found himself waiting for the sound of her footsteps the next day.

By the third time, coincidence had become anticipation. He sat on the low stone wall outside his house, a book in his lap that he wasn‚Äôt reading. When she passed, she looked at him directly ‚Äî not shy, not bold, just certain. Her lips curved into the smallest of smiles, one she might have given a stranger and yet felt like it belonged only to him.

That was how it began.

The next evening, when he sat on the same wall with the same unopened book, she slowed as she passed. For a heartbeat, it seemed like she might keep walking. Then she stopped.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre pretending to read,‚Äù she said, tilting her head toward the book in his lap. Her voice was light, carrying no judgment, just certainty.

He looked down at the blank page he hadn‚Äôt turned in ten minutes. ‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre pretending not to snoop,‚Äù he shot back, surprising himself with the ease of his words.

Her smile tugged at the corner of her mouth, half-hidden but impossible to miss. She pushed her glasses up her nose, as if steadying herself, and stepped closer. ‚ÄúSo, what are you actually doing out here?‚Äù

He hesitated, then shrugged. ‚ÄúWaiting.‚Äù

‚ÄúFor what?‚Äù

He thought about lying. But the way her eyes held his, curious and unflinching, made him tell the truth. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Something. Maybe nothing.‚Äù

For a moment, silence stretched between them. Then she laughed softly, the kind of laugh that slipped out without permission. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a terrible answer,‚Äù she said, settling on the edge of the wall beside him.

And just like that, she was there ‚Äî sitting close enough for him to notice the faint ink smudge on her fingers, the scent of her shampoo, something floral and sharp. She set her notebook on her lap, tapping the cover with absent fingers.

‚ÄúYou write a lot,‚Äù he said, nodding toward it.

Her hand froze, then retreated protectively over the notebook. ‚ÄúNot really.‚Äù

He raised an eyebrow.

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù she admitted, lowering her voice as if confessing a crime. ‚ÄúMaybe a little. Stories. Pieces of things. It‚Äôs stupid.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt sound stupid.‚Äù

She studied him for a moment, searching his face for sarcasm. Finding none, she let out a breath. ‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt even read them.‚Äù

‚ÄúStill doesn‚Äôt sound stupid.‚Äù

Her fingers tightened on the notebook, then relaxed, and for the first time she let out a small laugh. It wasn‚Äôt loud ‚Äî more like a quiet breath that escaped before she could stop it.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù he asked, grinning.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt even know what I write,‚Äù she said, tilting her head so her hair brushed against the frames of her glasses.

‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt matter. I can tell it‚Äôs important to you.‚Äù

She gave him a quick look, the kind that slips through before someone remembers to hide it, and then glanced down at her shoes. ‚ÄúMaybe. A little.‚Äù

He nudged the book in his lap. ‚ÄúWant to trade? You show me something you wrote, I‚Äôll show you what I was pretending to read.‚Äù

Her smile widened, though she shook her head quickly. ‚ÄúNot a chance.‚Äù

‚ÄúCoward.‚Äù

‚ÄúCareful,‚Äù she said, trying not to laugh again. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre calling someone with a pen a coward. That‚Äôs dangerous.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, so that‚Äôs your weapon of choice?‚Äù

‚ÄúObviously.‚Äù She tapped her notebook, her voice growing a little bolder. ‚ÄúSharper than a sword.‚Äù

He leaned back, mock-considering. ‚ÄúGuess I‚Äôll have to bring a shield tomorrow.‚Äù

That did it ‚Äî the laugh broke free, bright and genuine this time. It startled him, not because it was loud, but because of how much space it seemed to take up in the evening air.

When the laughter faded, he glanced down at his book again, then held it out. ‚ÄúHere. You don‚Äôt have to read it if you don‚Äôt want to. But‚Ä¶ take it.‚Äù

She hesitated, her hand hovering, then slowly reached for it. Their fingers brushed as she pulled it to her chest, her eyes flicking up at him quickly before darting away.

After a second, she hugged the notebook closer, then, almost reluctantly, held it out. ‚ÄúOnly if you give it back,‚Äù she said softly.

He accepted it like it was something fragile, nodding. ‚ÄúDeal.‚Äù

As she stood to leave, she tapped the book against her thigh, her smile small but certain. ‚ÄúTomorrow,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúTomorrow,‚Äù he echoed.

When she disappeared down the street, he looked at the notebook in his hands, still warm from hers.
The next evening, he was on the wall before the sun began to set. He tried to read her notebook carefully, slowly, but his eyes had kept jumping ahead. Inside were short passages ‚Äî half-stories, observations, fragments of things. A description of the way rain painted the world darker before it fell. A sketch of a girl waiting at a bus stop who might have been real or might have been imagined. It was rough, unpolished, but alive in a way that caught him off guard.

By the time she appeared, her notebook hugged against her chest again, his own book tucked under her arm, he couldn‚Äôt stop himself from smiling.

‚ÄúWell?‚Äù she asked, trying for casual but failing; her voice betrayed the faintest tremor of nerves.

He tapped the notebook on his lap. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre good. Like, actually good.‚Äù

Her cheeks colored instantly. She tried to wave him off, adjusting her glasses. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre just scraps. Nothing finished.‚Äù

‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt matter. It feels‚Ä¶ real. Like you see things other people miss.‚Äù

She blinked at him, caught between disbelief and a small, hidden pride. Then she cleared her throat quickly, as if embarrassed to be seen too closely. ‚ÄúYour book wasn‚Äôt bad either.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot bad?‚Äù

‚ÄúBetter than I expected,‚Äù she teased, finally letting herself smile.

He laughed. ‚ÄúGuess I‚Äôll take that.‚Äù

For a while they sat in the fading light, trading small comments about the stories, what she meant when she wrote a certain line, what he thought of a character in his book. The more they talked, the easier it became ‚Äî her shyness giving way to quiet boldness, his sarcasm softening into something warmer.

When the conversation thinned into a comfortable silence, he found himself blurting out, ‚ÄúHey, there‚Äôs this old cafe down by the park. They say they make the best milkshakes. Want to check it out this weekend?‚Äù

She looked up sharply, eyes wide behind her glasses. For a second, he worried he‚Äôd said the wrong thing. But then she tucked her hair back, her lips curving into the faintest smile.

‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù she said softly.

‚ÄúMaybe?‚Äù

She tilted her head, enjoying the small advantage. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll let you know tomorrow.‚Äù

And just like that, the promise of another day stretched ahead of them ‚Äî not spoken, but alive in the space between their words.

The next day, he came earlier than usual, their books tucked under his arm. The sun slid lower and lower, shadows stretching across the street, but the wall beside him stayed empty.

He told himself she wasn‚Äôt coming. Maybe yesterday had been a one-time thing. Maybe he‚Äôd pushed too far with the caf√©. He tried to read, but the words blurred, heavy with disappointment.

And then ‚Äî footsteps. Quick, uneven, rushing.

She appeared at last, breathless, her glasses slipping down her nose. ‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù she said, clutching her notebook close. ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt get away sooner.‚Äù

Relief broke over him so suddenly he almost laughed. ‚ÄúI thought you weren‚Äôt coming.‚Äù

‚ÄúI almost didn‚Äôt,‚Äù she admitted, brushing hair from her face. ‚ÄúBut I said I would.‚Äù

He handed her book back, trying to hide the way his chest loosened just seeing her. She sat, but only for a moment before shaking her head. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt stay long today. My friend‚Äôs waiting. But‚Äî‚Äù she tapped the cover of her notebook, ‚Äú‚ÄîI wanted to hear what you thought.‚Äù

They spoke quickly, words rushed, as if trying to fold an hour into a few stolen minutes. She smiled when he quoted one of her lines back to her; he grinned when she poked fun at his book‚Äôs clumsy plot twist. And when she finally stood, dusting gravel from her shorts, she said softly, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget the weekend.‚Äù

‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt dare,‚Äù he replied.

The caf√© near the park smelled of coffee beans and sugar, its windows fogged from the heat inside. They sat across from each other in a corner booth, two milkshakes sweating between them, the air humming with voices and clinking spoons.

For a while, neither spoke. She drew circles on the condensation of her glass; he tapped his fingers against the table, searching for words. Finally, unable to stand the silence, he blurted out, ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ what kind of boys do you like?‚Äù

Her head snapped up, eyes widening behind her glasses. ‚ÄúSeriously?‚Äù she said, half-laughing, half-scolding. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what you wanted to ask me?‚Äù

The tips of his ears burned. ‚ÄúMy bad,‚Äù he muttered quickly, raising his hands as if to surrender. ‚ÄúI just‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt know how else to start. I‚Äôm terrible at this.‚Äù

She stared at him for a moment, lips pressed together ‚Äî then broke into laughter, soft at first, then spilling out. ‚ÄúYou really are hopeless,‚Äù she said, shaking her head.

‚ÄúGuilty,‚Äù he admitted, but the sound of her laughter loosened something tight in his chest.

The tension melted, and the conversation began to flow ‚Äî awkwardly at first, then more freely. She told him how she always ordered vanilla milkshakes, even though chocolate was better, because vanilla made her think of summer afternoons when she was younger. He confessed he hated milkshakes but ordered one anyway because it felt wrong not to.

They drifted from topic to topic ‚Äî favorite songs, the teachers they couldn‚Äôt stand, the places they‚Äôd rather be. At one point, she caught him staring at the way her glasses slid down her nose and pushed them back up with an exaggerated motion. ‚ÄúWhat? You‚Äôve never seen someone adjust glasses before?‚Äù

He laughed, shaking his head. ‚ÄúNot like you do.‚Äù

The afternoon stretched on, sunlight shifting across the table. By the time they left the caf√©, her cheeks were flushed from laughing, and his heart was heavier than he expected, weighed down by the thought of how quickly hours could vanish when spent with her.

That night, when he opened her notebook again, he found the fragment she had written:

There‚Äôs a boy who waits by the wall. He pretends he doesn‚Äôt care, but he does‚Ä¶

And this time, he couldn‚Äôt stop the smile that spread across his face.

Chapter Three ‚Äî Monday

She arrived later than usual, her smile weaker, her steps slower. They sat side by side, exchanging small talk, but there was a hesitation in the air, something fragile between them. Finally, he asked what had been pressing on him since he first opened the notebook.

‚ÄúThat note,‚Äù he said, careful but direct. ‚ÄúWas it about me?‚Äù

Her fingers froze on the edge of the cover. She tried to smile but failed, her voice breaking into a whisper. ‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ it wasn‚Äôt.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt reply, only watching her. The silence pressed on her until, unable to hold it, she whispered again, softer, trembling: ‚ÄúIt was. It was about you. I shouldn‚Äôt have written it. I can cut it out, tear the page ‚Äî pretend it never existed.‚Äù

Her words rushed now, spilling with fear. ‚ÄúI like you. In a different way than just friends. But if you don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ if you don‚Äôt feel the same, then maybe even this friendship will end. You can say no, I‚Äôll understand.‚Äù

Her throat tightened; her eyes glossed. She bit her lip hard, but the tear escaped anyway. She quickly turned her face, muttered a small, broken: ‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù and stood before he could stop her.

He rose half an inch, reaching, but she was already walking away, wiping at her eyes. The sound of her fading footsteps hollowed the street, leaving him alone on the wall, hands cold and useless at his sides.

That Night

The night dragged like a punishment. He turned in bed, stared at the ceiling until the shadows blurred. Every sound ‚Äî the ticking of the clock, the creak of the fan ‚Äî pressed on him like an accusation. He saw her again and again, the way her voice broke, the way she said ‚Äúsorry‚Äù as if she was the one who had done wrong.

What if she never came back? What if she erased the page, erased him, erased everything they had built in those quiet hours? The thought clawed at him until dawn.

By morning, he knew the silence would kill him faster than the truth ever could.

Tuesday ‚Äî The Road

She was walking alone, her round glasses catching the morning light, her satchel swaying with each step. When she saw him waiting at the bend, her lips parted, a flicker of surprise crossing her face.

He didn‚Äôt wait for hesitation to choke him this time. He stepped forward and said, simply, firmly:

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

She blinked, startled. ‚ÄúYes‚Ä¶ to what?‚Äù

He met her gaze, steady now. ‚ÄúYes to what you said yesterday. Yes to the note. Yes to you.‚Äù

Her cheeks colored instantly, and the tension she‚Äôd carried since yesterday slipped from her shoulders. A small, almost disbelieving laugh escaped her, and she tilted her head, eyes shining behind the glasses.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù she asked softly, as if afraid the answer might vanish if spoken too loud. ‚ÄúWhy did you say yes?‚Äù

He reached into his satchel and pulled out the notebook she had given him. Tapping the page, he quoted her words back to her ‚Äî words she thought would stay hidden.

‚Äú‚ÄòHe notices the small things. Even when no one else does.‚Äô‚Äù His voice was calm, certain. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how I knew. That‚Äôs why.‚Äù

For a moment, she just stared, caught between shock and a smile that wanted to break free. Then she pressed her lips together, failing to hide her joy.

‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt supposed to read it like that,‚Äù she murmured.

‚ÄúI did,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd I couldn‚Äôt forget it.‚Äù

Her laugh came out lighter now, free of the fear that had choked her the day before. They began walking together down the road, not saying much more, but every step was different now ‚Äî closer, more certain, stitched with something unnamed but understood.

Chapter Four ‚Äî The Promise

The next afternoon, they met at their usual place ‚Äî the low wall shaded by the half-bent tree. The air was warm, golden with late sun. She greeted him with that smile he was beginning to recognize as just for him: shy at first, then widening when their eyes met.

But he carried something heavier than their laughter that day. He shifted on the wall, staring at his hands, then finally spoke.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something I need to say.‚Äù

Her smile faded a little, worry flickering in her eyes. ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis‚Ä¶ us,‚Äù he said, struggling for the right word. ‚ÄúIt has to stay between us. No one else. Not your friends, not mine. Just you and me.‚Äù

For a second, she looked almost wounded, as if he‚Äôd pulled the sky a little lower. Then she studied him more carefully, saw the seriousness in his eyes, and her expression softened.

‚ÄúYou want it to be ours,‚Äù she said quietly.

He nodded. ‚ÄúExactly. Ours.‚Äù

She thought for a moment, then placed her notebook gently in his lap, the corner brushing his hand. ‚ÄúThen it will be. A secret between pages. Between us.‚Äù

He let out a breath he hadn‚Äôt realized he was holding. She smiled again, and this time there was no hesitation in it. The promise was sealed ‚Äî not with grand declarations, but with silence, trust, and the weight of knowing they both wanted the same thing.

‚∏ª

Chapter Five ‚Äî Time Passing

Days blurred into weeks. The wall became their place, the notebooks their language. They wrote more than they spoke, traded pages like confessions, filled margins with jokes and half-thoughts that only made sense to the two of them.

Sometimes they walked together, not saying much at all, content in the quiet. Sometimes she‚Äôd laugh so suddenly that passersby would stare, and he would pretend not to notice how her laugh always pulled one out of him, too.

No one else knew. Not her friends, not his family. Their bond lived in the small hours, in the hush of the world that belonged only to them.

It was enough. At least, for a while.

Chapter Seven ‚Äî The Farewell Promise

She knew before he said it. Maybe it was in the way he carried himself those last few days, or the heaviness in his silence. One afternoon, as they sat on their wall, she looked at him through her round glasses, eyes steady and soft.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre leaving again, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù

He froze. The words lodged in his throat, but he nodded. ‚ÄúMy father‚Äôs been transferred. End of the month.‚Äù

Her face flickered ‚Äî a shadow of pain, quickly hidden. Then she shook her head firmly, almost stubbornly. ‚ÄúThen I‚Äôll just have to wait. Because I‚Äôm not leaving you. Not here.‚Äù She touched her chest lightly, right over her heart.

The simple gesture nearly undid him. He swallowed, his voice breaking into something raw. ‚ÄúWhat if we never‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúWe will.‚Äù She cut him off, sharper than he expected. Then her voice softened again. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll meet again one day. Promise me.‚Äù

He looked at her, the certainty in her eyes, and nodded. ‚ÄúI promise.‚Äù

‚∏ª

The day of leaving came too soon. The bus idled at the station, coughing smoke into the hot air. His bags were heavy, but not as heavy as the silence that pressed between them. She stood close, holding something in her hand.

‚ÄúHere,‚Äù she said, pressing a small object into his palm. It was a thin bracelet, woven from black thread with a small metal bead at its center. She pressed the bead lightly with her thumb, and the bracelet buzzed faintly in his hand ‚Äî a soft hum, like a heartbeat.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs silly,‚Äù she said with a nervous laugh, though her eyes were wet. ‚ÄúBut when you press it, mine will buzz too. So even if we‚Äôre far away, I‚Äôll know you‚Äôre thinking of me. And you‚Äôll know the same.‚Äù

He looked down at it, then back at her. His throat tightened, but he forced a smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll press it every day.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot every day,‚Äù she said gently, slipping it onto his wrist herself. ‚ÄúOnly when you really mean it.‚Äù

For a moment, neither spoke. Then the driver called, the final warning. He stepped back, and she reached out, grabbing his hand one last time.

‚ÄúPromise me again,‚Äù she whispered.

He squeezed her fingers, the bracelet buzzing faintly between them. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll come back. And you‚Äôll be here.‚Äù

Her lips curved into the smallest, bravest smile. ‚ÄúAlways.‚Äù

And then, as the bus pulled away, she became a blur in the smoke and distance ‚Äî holding her own wrist, waiting for the next buzz that would tell her he hadn‚Äôt forgotten.

Chapter Eight ‚Äî The Silence

It was an ordinary morning when the bracelet vibrated unlike anything he had ever felt. Rapid, insistent, urgent ‚Äî the tiny metal bead pulsing like a frantic heartbeat against his wrist.

He pressed his own in reply over and over, laughing softly, imagining her teasing him with exaggerated urgency. But the buzzing didn‚Äôt stop as quickly as usual; it lingered, relentless, as though calling out something he could not hear.

Then ‚Äî silence.

Days passed. Weeks. The bracelet never buzzed again. Not once. Only he sent messages, little taps, reminders, whispers of connection, and there was no reply. He assumed she was busy, distracted, or perhaps traveling. The playful rhythm that had always been their private language was gone, replaced by the quiet absence of her presence.

The worry never fully left him, though he tried to bury it under routine, under the familiar sights of his new surroundings. Yet each night, when he traced the bracelet in his hand, he felt the weight of her missing vibrations ‚Äî the space where her heartbeat used to reach him.

And so he decided. He wouldn‚Äôt wait any longer. Even if it meant leaving everything behind, he could not live apart from her. He would return.

Not today. Not yet. But one day, one year from then if he had to wait, he would come back.

No one would stop him. No distance, no silence, no unknown danger would keep him from her.

He pressed the bracelet one last time that evening, a silent promise: I‚Äôll be back. No matter what.

He woke before sunrise, the first light spilling through the thin curtains of his room. His heart raced, steady and insistent, carrying a single thought he couldn‚Äôt ignore: I will go back to her

Breakfast was a blur, his belongings hastily packed into a small bag. The train station smelled of coffee, coal, and early morning rain, but he barely noticed. Every step echoed his resolve. He clutched the bracelet in his hand, the metal bead cold and familiar, and tapped it lightly ‚Äî a silent promise to himself, a reminder of what waited at the end of the journey.

The train‚Äôs whistle blew, long and mournful, and he boarded without looking back. As the wheels turned, carrying him farther from the life he had left behind, he pressed the bracelet again, sending rapid taps, hoping somehow she might feel them, wherever she was.

Hours stretched like shadows across the tracks. He stared out the window at towns rushing past, every face a stranger, every blur of buildings a reminder of how far he had to go. But he didn‚Äôt doubt it for a second. Nothing could stop him ‚Äî not distance, not the unknown, not the long months apart.

When the train finally slowed and screeched into the station, he stepped down, breathing in the city‚Äôs thick, chaotic air. The crowd pressed around him, unaware of the urgency that burned in his chest. Every step, every turn, every push through the throng was guided by a single instinct: find her.

He raised his wrist, tapping the bracelet rapidly, letting the vibrations echo in the small space between them, come to me‚Ä¶ wherever you are‚Ä¶

And then he heard it ‚Äî a whisper, soft but unmistakable, carried across the noise:

‚ÄúHere‚Ä¶‚Äù

Chapter Nine ‚Äî The Reunion

He froze. The single word ‚Äî ‚ÄúHere‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äî floated over the noise of the crowd, fragile yet unmistakable. He scanned the people around him, heart hammering, and then he saw her: small, round glasses catching the sunlight, hair tucked behind her ear, diary clutched tightly to her chest.

He pushed through the throng toward her, keeping his steps careful but urgent. When he reached her, he noticed something strange ‚Äî her lips barely moved as she tried to speak.

‚ÄúWhy‚Ä¶ why aren‚Äôt you speaking?‚Äù he asked softly, a shadow of concern in his voice.

She looked down at the diary in her hands. Slowly, deliberately, she opened it to a blank page and began to write.

‚ÄúA rare illness‚Ä¶ my vocal cords were affected. I can whisper, but speaking loudly hurts. I didn‚Äôt want anyone to know ‚Äî not even you ‚Äî because I didn‚Äôt want to worry you.‚Äù

He read her words carefully, his heart tightening at the thought of the months she had endured alone. The rapid buzzing of the bracelet that day, the silence afterward, the absence of replies ‚Äî he had never understood what she had been going through.

‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶ you went through all this alone?‚Äù he whispered, careful not to hurt her.

She pressed the diary to her chest and gave him a faint, practiced sign ‚Äî the first words of the sign language she had learned to communicate with others while she recovered. I‚Äôm fine.

He nodded slowly, sadness and relief mingling in his expression, but he didn‚Äôt cry. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre here,‚Äù he said, voice steady.

She opened the diary again and wrote quickly, her pen moving as if racing to catch up on lost months:

‚ÄúAnd now‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre back. That‚Äôs all that matters.‚Äù

Then, carefully, she whispered her first full word to him, her throat slightly strained:

‚ÄúFinally.‚Äù

He smiled softly, feeling the weight of the past months ease a little. The crowd around them faded, irrelevant. The broken bracelet, the diary, her whispered word, and the subtle signs between them were enough ‚Äî their secret connection, renewed.

They stood there for a long moment, silently understanding everything the months apart had taught them: distance, illness, silence ‚Äî none of it could break what they shared.

Chapter Ten ‚Äî The Years Between

The months after their reunion flowed quietly, stitched together by routine, laughter, and small acts of care.

She had her diary always at hand, scribbling thoughts she could not speak aloud. He carried the broken bracelet, tapping it whenever he needed to check in, to let her know he was thinking of her. Their communication, once urgent and desperate, became tender and playful. A single buzz could convey a thousand words.

They walked through streets, watched sunsets from rooftops, and spent afternoons in crowded caf√©s, sharing silence as easily as they shared laughter. She whispered to him when her throat allowed, each word fragile and precious; he learned to read her signs as naturally as reading her expressions.

School years passed with steady rhythm. They studied together, teasing and correcting each other, and sometimes, when the world was too loud, they would retreat to their private corner with diary and bracelet. Even in crowded classrooms, their connection was unbroken.

By the time they were eighteen, the decision to live together felt inevitable. A small apartment, bright and modest, became their sanctuary. Mornings were slow ‚Äî the smell of coffee and her faint whispers mixing with the rustle of pages. Evenings were quiet, filled with sketches in her diary, rapid bracelet messages, and gentle, whispered conversations.

They learned each other‚Äôs habits intimately. He knew the exact way she arranged her books, the way her glasses slid down her nose when she was thinking. She knew when he needed silence and when he needed talk. Even without full voices, the world seemed less noisy, less chaotic, when they were together.

Challenges came, of course. Her whispering voice could strain, sometimes leaving her exhausted. He adapted, speaking softly, listening intently, letting her set the pace. Friends and family noticed their closeness, but few could understand the depth of their silent language. And through every small test ‚Äî illness flare-ups, exams, city moves ‚Äî they relied on diary, bracelet, and gestures to bridge the world‚Äôs gaps.

By the time they turned nineteen, living together felt natural, unremarkable, yet extraordinary all at once. Their apartment was filled with memories ‚Äî scraps of paper, little notes tucked between books, tiny gifts left on tables, and the soft hum of the bracelet whenever one of them needed the other.

And even as the years passed, one thing remained unbroken: the bond that began in whispers and a secret bracelet, carried through distance, illness, and silence. It was theirs alone, unshakable, ready to face whatever the world might bring next.
Chapter Eleven ‚Äî Quiet Moments

Evening sunlight spilled through the curtains, painting their small apartment in shades of gold. She sat cross-legged on the floor, diary open, pen scratching softly across the page. He leaned against the couch, head tilted toward her, watching the way her hair caught the light, the way her glasses slid down her nose when she smiled.

She looked up and whispered his name, her voice faint but warm. He reached for her hand, brushing his thumb over hers. ‚ÄúCome here,‚Äù he murmured, and she crawled into his lap, resting her head against his chest.

The bracelet lay forgotten on the table; their hands spoke a language of their own. He wrapped his arms around her gently, and she rested there, breathing steady, her soft whispers against his collarbone. For hours, they simply existed together ‚Äî no words, no notes, just the comfort of being close.

They cooked together, laughing at small disasters in the kitchen. They read in tandem, sometimes aloud, sometimes silently, and always ended up curled together on the couch. Weekends became small adventures: long walks, hidden caf√©s, afternoons in the park. Even in silence, their lives were entwined.

One night, as they lay together, he traced her hand with his thumb and whispered, ‚ÄúI want this‚Ä¶ all of this‚Ä¶ forever.‚Äù

Her eyes softened, a smile touching her lips despite the faint whisper of her voice. She pressed her hand to his, scribbling quickly in her diary:

‚ÄúForever‚Ä¶ yes. But let‚Äôs promise it‚Äôs ours, always.‚Äù

He nodded, leaning down to press a gentle kiss to her forehead. ‚ÄúThen let‚Äôs make it real. Let‚Äôs marry, and keep our forever ours.‚Äù

She whispered, faint but certain: ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

And in that small apartment, filled with sunlight, soft laughter, whispers, and gentle touches, the decision felt natural ‚Äî the culmination of years spent building a life together, unbroken by distance, silence, or struggle. It was theirs alone, sacred, and ready to carry into the future.

Chapter Thirteen ‚Äî The Quiet Hours

The apartment was bathed in the soft glow of evening light, the kind that made shadows dance gently across the walls. She lay against him, fragile and delicate, her body resting lightly on his chest. Each whisper she gave him was a struggle, a thread of sound that strained her throat and left her shoulders trembling. Yet she smiled faintly, pressing a small kiss to his collarbone, and he held her tighter, careful not to crush the gentle weight of her in his arms.

He had noticed subtle changes over the past days. Her breaths had grown slightly shallower, and her whispers came with increasing effort. Now, as he held her close, listening to the rhythm of her chest, a cold worry crept into him. Every inhale seemed lighter than the last, every exhale more fragile.

‚ÄúStay with me,‚Äù he whispered softly, brushing his fingers along her hair. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got you.‚Äù

Her fingers found his hand, clutching it weakly but firmly, a silent reassurance. She opened her diary slowly, hands trembling, and scribbled a few lines.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm scared‚Ä¶ but with you, it‚Äôs okay. Always‚Ä¶ yours.‚Äù

He read the words carefully, pressing his lips to the page before looking back at her. Her smile was faint, but her eyes glimmered with love. He brushed a thumb over her hand, careful to soothe her without letting her feel his own growing fear.

Hours passed like this ‚Äî quiet, intimate, unbroken by the world outside. They cuddled on the couch, blankets wrapped loosely around them, her head nestled against his shoulder, his arm steady around her shoulders. He whispered fragments of memories, shared silly stories from the past, and repeated lines from her diary, hoping to comfort her, hoping to anchor her to him.

Yet the worry continued to grow. Her breaths were slowing, each inhale shallow, each exhale a little weaker. He pressed his cheek to her hair, murmuring softly, ‚ÄúStay with me. Please‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt leave me.‚Äù

She reached up and whispered his name, a fragile thread of sound that barely reached his ears. He leaned closer, catching every syllable.

‚ÄúFinally,‚Äù she breathed, her first full word in hours, almost a laugh hidden in the whisper. He pressed a kiss to her temple, brushing his lips across her hair, holding her as if letting go would unravel everything they had shared.

The time of the wedding arrived. They exchanged vows quietly, intimately, surrounded by only their closest friends and family. Her dress was delicate, almost ethereal, her glasses catching the soft light, her hair pinned carefully. When he held her hands, he felt the frailty beneath the surface ‚Äî the tremor in her fingers, the slight catch in her breath.

‚ÄúI promise,‚Äù he whispered, leaning close, ‚Äúto love you in every quiet hour we have together.‚Äù

She whispered back faintly, ‚ÄúAnd I promise‚Ä¶ to be yours, always.‚Äù

The ceremony ended, but they did not leave the quiet of the apartment. They returned to their sanctuary, where the world outside faded. He held her, brushing kisses to her forehead, her temple, and the back of her hand. She whispered small fragments, confessions of love, words she could no longer say fully. He pressed his lips to her hair, tracing gentle lines along her shoulders, holding her closer each time her breaths grew more shallow.

Hours passed, the night stretching quietly around them. He noticed with growing fear how her breathing had slowed even more. He leaned down, pressing a gentle kiss to her cheek, whispering into her ear:

‚ÄúHold on‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm here. Always with you.‚Äù

She squeezed his hand faintly and scribbled a line in her diary, barely able to lift the pen:

‚ÄúForever‚Ä¶ in these quiet hours. I love you.‚Äù

He read the words aloud softly, kissing her hand, her forehead, holding her as close as possible. Her whispers grew lighter, shorter, and he held his breath each time, listening to the fragile rhythm of her chest.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve got you,‚Äù he murmured again, rocking her gently. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never let go.‚Äù

Her eyes fluttered, her fingers brushing against his face as she whispered his name one last time. Her breath slowed further, each exhale a little more fragile. He held her closer, feeling the small tremors in her hands, tracing her hair, murmuring every line of love he had ever written or whispered to her.

In his arms, she exhaled one final time. Her hand relaxed in his, her head resting softly against his chest. He pressed his lips to her forehead, clutching her close, whispering every word he had saved for this quiet, sacred moment: I love you. Always. Forever.

And then, surrounded by the intimacy of their shared quiet hours ‚Äî the diary, the bracelet, the whispered words, the gentle cuddles ‚Äî she slipped from the world.

He stayed still, holding her as if letting go would unravel everything, pressing kisses to her hands, her hair, her temple, murmuring her name and their promises until the sun rose again. In those final quiet hours, they had lived everything together ‚Äî love, intimacy, devotion ‚Äî and in his arms, she became eternity.

Epilogue ‚Äî Fifteen Years of Quiet Hours

Fifteen years had passed. The apartment was quieter now, but every corner still carried her presence ‚Äî her diary on the shelf, her glasses carefully placed, the broken bracelet lying where it had always been. He had never married again. No one could ever replace the life, the love, the whispered hours he had shared with her.

Each morning, without fail, he pressed the bracelet to his wrist, feeling the faint hum beneath his fingers. It had long since stopped vibrating with hers, yet for him, it remained sacred ‚Äî a lifeline to the love that had defined his life. Every buzz he imagined was a heartbeat, every press a whisper: here, always, ours.

He sat at the desk where she used to write, opening her diary and running his fingers along her delicate handwriting. Some stories were unfinished, some lines still fragile and trembling, and he spent hours completing them ‚Äî carefully, lovingly, as if speaking to her across time. Each word was a conversation, each sentence a continuation of their shared life.

Neighbors and friends noticed the quiet reverence in him, the subtle sadness softened only by gentle smiles when he spoke of her. He never sought another partner. No one could take her place, no one could match the intimacy of whispers, diary pages, and the fragile hum of a bracelet that had once carried her presence.

Evenings were his favorite time. He would sit on the couch, her diary on his lap, the bracelet pressed to his wrist, and imagine her hand resting lightly on his arm, her head against his shoulder. He whispered lines from her diary aloud, softly reading stories they had dreamed of together, letting the echoes of their quiet hours fill the room.

Sometimes he would smile through the ache, remembering her soft whispers, the warmth of her cuddles, the way her fragile voice had once trembled in the simplest confessions of love. And though her body had left him, her presence ‚Äî the essence of their shared life ‚Äî remained unbroken.

Every day, he pressed the bracelet and whispered her name. Every day, he wrote in the margins of her stories, adding chapters to a life that was theirs alone. Fifteen years had passed, but his devotion had never wavered. He had kept their promise, cherished their quiet hours, and honored her memory in every whispered word, every gentle touch in his imagination, and every story he completed.

And in that quiet, sacred routine, he knew ‚Äî their love had never ended. It lived in the diary, in the bracelet, in every heartbeat and memory, timeless and eternal.

1nie9oc,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1nie9oc/i_killed_someone_in_a_story_cops_just_found_the/,I Killed Someone in a Story. Cops Just Found the Body.,"I‚Äôve been a writer for quite some time now. I can still remember being a kid in elementary school and hearing my first scary story. Man, from that moment on, I was completely hooked. I looked for these stories like crack, and very quickly they became the only thing I was listening to constantly.

Naturally, already excelling at English, once I discovered these new forms of creative expression, it was only a matter of time before I tried my hand at it myself.

I felt as though I had a general grasp on what a good story should look like; I knew to pay attention to pacing, make things natural, and, most importantly, felt I knew how to paint an artful, albeit graphic picture.

That being said, I recently wrote a story regarding murder. More specifically, the murder of an elderly jogger who just so happened to be a key witness in the story. He was set to testify against some important people in court, and I was tasked with tying up some loose ends, if you know what I mean.

Listen, I was trying to write a crime novel, alright? I‚Äôm not Agatha Christie, I just figured I‚Äôd give some mystery writing a try. Anyway, I‚Äôm getting sidetracked.

Basically, as he ran his normal route, as he did every morning; I drove up about a mile ahead of him and set up some ultra-thin metal wire that stretched from one tree to another horizontally across the path. Directly at the neck level for our ‚Äúkey witness‚Äù.

As I mentioned, I was trying to write a crime novel, so I had written my character as this sort of private eye/ mercenary type deal- listen, I already told you I‚Äôm not Agatha Christie, I‚Äôm a horror writer at heart- but I say this because I made my character do research, right? I made him know his stuff is what I‚Äôm saying.

More specifically, I made him know that this elderly jogger ran at an average pace of 6 miles an hour and that his neck would be exactly 5 feet and 4 inches from the ground.

All that ‚Äúknowing‚Äù I did, yet, as I watched the jogger slam into the wire and get clotheslined to his butt, the blood wasn‚Äôt coming out at nearly the speed I thought it would.

In fact, the jogger just sat there, rubbing his neck and becoming absolutely flabbergasted as he drew his hand back from his throat revealing watery red blood coating his palm.

In a state of animalistic fear after noticing the wire, his eyes darted around wildly as he rose to his feet.

Afraid of my target's escape, I quickly jumped from the bush where I hid, waiting to take a picture of him upon the job's completion.

His eyes lit up with fear as I knocked him back down to his back, quickly analyzing the area to make sure no one was around.

As the old man struggled to get up, I unhooked the wire from one of the trees and wrapped it around his neck.

I pulled as hard as I could and heard flesh tearing and veins ripping as the man's struggling grunts turned to gurgles, and the sound of wet flopping filled the air.

Once his feet stopped kicking and his body went completely limp, I removed the wire from around his neck. He was nearly decapitated as he lay there on the vacant walking trail. The sounds of nature continued, and birds sang to the backdrop of gently trickling water from a nearby stream as the man's blood leaked further and further down the concrete.

As I said, my character had to take photos upon the job's completion, so that‚Äôs what he did.

I snapped a few shots from various angles before rolling up the wire and hurrying back to my old Volkswagen, completely covered in blood.

Again, I AM NOT A MYSTERY WRITER.

Like, I didn‚Äôt even put the effort into thinking about all the DNA evidence to be collected from the scene, the amount of witnesses that could‚Äôve been around in such a public space, and don‚Äôt even get me started on the fact that he just, what? Left the old man there on the trail for people to find and alert authorities? Fuck, man, like pick a lane, right?

See, that‚Äôs exactly what I thought too.

And that‚Äôs exactly why I DELETED that story. Moved it to the trash bin immediately after reading it, utterly ashamed of myself, I must say.

I 100 percent planned on just calling it a night, and picking up on a new horror story the next day.

As I lay in bed and drifted into sleep, it felt as though my eyes were closed for mere moments before the booming sound of knocks came thumping from my front door. Sunlight filled my room, and as I groggily made my way towards the door, the rhythmic knocking abruptly stopped.

I crept up and checked the peephole to find no one there.

When I opened the door, there wasn‚Äôt even anyone in the hallway; however, there were some Polaroid photos placed carefully on my welcome mat.

They were of the old man, exactly how I had imagined him and exactly how I‚Äôd mutilated him. All taken from the exact angles as the story.

I couldn‚Äôt even move for a brief moment as I stared down at them, disgusted at how they decorated the mat.

I quickly gathered my thoughts, however, and scooped up each of the 6 photos.

Lying them out on the coffee table, I sat down on the couch with a ‚Äúthis can‚Äôt possibly be happening‚Äù look on my face, and my head fell into my hands as the realization hit me.

I flipped on the TV and turned to the news just in time to see the headline:

KEY WITNESS IN HUMAN TRAFFICKING CASE FOUND DEAD ON WALKING TRAIL IN ATLANTA

‚ÄúWelp,‚Äù I thought to myself. ‚ÄúIt was fun while it lasted.‚Äù

Look, I‚Äôm writing this now because I‚Äôm not sure when my next story will be. I can hear the tactical boots of a SWAT team rushing up the stairs in my building, and I‚Äôm sure I know exactly where they‚Äôre headed. I‚Äôm not sure what else to say, other than thank you for reading, and I hope you enjoyed.",1,1758020359.0,stayawake,1,1.0,False

About me: 32M, IT role, nerdy, trying to break out of my shelI. It's been a hell of a year between family issues, job issues, issue uh- issues..and the like. I'm sort of on a journey of self discovery again; trying to find out what makes me...me and whatnot. All the hobbies and passions had thrown out are slowly resurfacing, and l'd love to find people to chat and share it all with. Plus, adulting sucks and finding friends in the real world is like pulling teeth sometimes. Probably doesn't help I'm in a field that's primarily glued to their computers 24/7 and antisocial to an extent. 

Likes: Horror movies, metal/pop punk long walks on the beach (kidding), DnD (never played but wanna), RPGS, MMOS, occult-y things, comics, 3d printing, ADHD fueled deep dives into random topics and conspiracy theories, tattoos, cosplay, uh...coffee. Yeah think that covers it. 

Games: REPO, Enshrouded, The Forest, WoW, GW1, FF XIV, Smalland, Grounded, Among Us, Fall Guys, Monster Hunter World, Monster Prom, Schedule 1, Diablo 3/4, Deep Rock Galactic, and...that's all can pull off the top of my head, but there's probably more out there.

Looking for: People to chat with during the day, pass the time, and potentially play games with. Open to voice chat, maybe even video call depending on the vibe. Please at least know how to carry a conversation.

Patience and understanding is big for me. I'm not around 24/7, but I'm also not exactly the type to not talk for days and then suddenly reappear.

My eyes scan and check my tawny hair is neat and sleek in its high bun, and I scrutinize my reflection again to make sure it‚Äôs precise. Sighing once more, I take a steadying breath, trying to ready myself, pushing down the gnawing ache of anxiety and nerves deep inside my gut.



I‚Äôll do.



I look as good as I know I‚Äôm capable of, and I‚Äôm mildly satisfied with what I see before me: a cool, efficient image of cold poise and gray tailoring that exudes authority, with no hint of the turmoil of emotion inside me. I narrow my eyes to look for any flaws in my immaculate armor, any stray hairs, specks of dust, or creased fabric and find none.



I‚Äôve never been a lover of my own reflection with my youthful appearance, cool blue eyes, and pouting lips, but nothing is out of place, and I look right for my new role as personal assistant to my very high-profile boss. I look professional and capable on the outside, which I guess matters: calm and uncompromising with every detail in place and clothes flawlessly neat. I have always been good at shielding the truth about how I feel inside.



I slide on my stilettos in a slow, careful motion, keeping my balance with one hand on the wall. Hearing the movement in the room behind me, I check the mirror in response.



‚ÄúMorning, Ems. God, you look professional as always.‚Äù Sarah stifles a yawn as she wanders from her room and rubs her eyes with the back of her fist childishly as I watch her in the reflection behind me. It‚Äôs unusual for her to be up this early on her day off; Sarah‚Äôs never been a lover of mornings for as long as I‚Äôve known her.



She‚Äôs wearing her baggy pink housecoat, and her messy, short, bleached blonde hair is sticking up at all angles from her head, casually loveable as always. I am warmed with affection for that bundle of happy energy. Her bright blue eyes are heavy with early morning fatigue, and she‚Äôs watching me closely with a silly smile on her face. A little too closely for my liking.



‚ÄúGood morning, Sarah,‚Äù I smile lightly, trying to ignore how she‚Äôs looking at me, and straighten up to stand tall. I‚Äôm ever conscious of my grace and mannerisms under scrutiny, even in front of her, and I push out the sense of tightness from my nerves today, swallowing down the listlessness, trying extremely hard to curb the swirling of my stomach. I turn, lifting my briefcase from the floor, and head forward into our open-plan apartment.



‚ÄúRemember, you need to be here for ten o‚Äôclock ‚Ä¶ the boiler repair,‚Äù I remind her as she shuffles behind me to the living room area, trying to distract her from the open gawking she seems to be doing. Running through my schedule in my head like a mental checklist gives me something else to think about besides my uneasiness today.



‚ÄúI know. I know! You left me a memo on the fridge, remember?‚Äù she giggles childishly and throws me a patient look, raising a brow with an almost indulgent expression. She looks much younger than her age, and sometimes I forget we went to school together. I‚Äôm more like her guardian than her roommate nowadays, but maybe I always was, if I am being honest. I sigh again, pushing down the tight knot of apprehension growing inside and giving her a small bravado smile.



‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget.‚Äù I sound stern, but she doesn‚Äôt react; she‚Äôs used to my severe tone and the endless organization of our lives. She knows this is the way I do things; my need to control and have everything just so makes me feel more capable.



‚ÄúI won‚Äôt. I swear. I‚Äôm not working until tonight, so I‚Äôm going to stick around and chillax ‚Ä¶ watch some back-to-back Netflix.‚Äù She moves lazily through the bright white and gray kitchen to my side and begins making herself a coffee. With another sleepy bright smile, she lifts the mug I washed earlier this morning from the rack for herself. I watch her casual, confident movements around the space and her domain when she‚Äôs at home, giving me a sense of calm.



Sarah was always good at making me feel a little saner when I needed it, never aware of how I drew from that uncomplicated, relaxed manner of hers when I had to ground myself.



‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to work.‚Äù I walk steadily into the small hall by the side of the bar, which juts out into the lounge and lift the few open letters from the counter I‚Äôve yet to deal with today. I know that I‚Äôm lingering and acting indecisively compared to my usual efficient routine. Normally I‚Äôd already be walking to the subway station, despite being early.



‚ÄúOh, here,‚Äù Sarah says, sliding a white envelope out from behind the toaster and holding it out expectantly for me to take, a blank look on her face. ‚ÄúBefore I forget ‚Ä¶ I know you‚Äôve probably already taken care of them, as usual.‚Äù Her sparkling eyes flash at me with affectionate amusement.



‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù I look at the long envelope, taking it from her slowly with careful fingers, eyeing it up with a frown, seeing no writing on the front.



‚ÄúMy half of the utilities and the rent. I got paid early.‚Äù She smiles brightly and sets about making herself breakfast, pulling a loaf of bread open and sliding slices into the toaster.



‚ÄúRight. And yes, I‚Äôve taken care of it already ‚Ä¶ thank you.‚Äù I take it and slide it into my bag to bank at lunch, mentally noting down a memo to do so. I ritually pay our bills at the start of every month when I‚Äôm paid; having a very good wage in a great company with many perks makes it effortless to make sure we are always up to date.



‚ÄúNo surprise there then,‚Äù she mumbles and throws me another affectionate look, all cute eyes and gentle sighs as she regards me with a sideways glance that I clearly catch. I shake my head at her, fully aware that she prefers that I take control of our living expenses and always has. Taking care of things is how I like it; it gives me purpose, control, and a focus in my life that I so desperately need to thrive. She‚Äôs never been good with money, and I doubt she would remember to pay the rent on time without my ever-efficient presence.



‚ÄúI won‚Äôt be home until six o‚Äôclock, Sarah. I presume you‚Äôll be at work by then, so have a wonderful day.‚Äù I move away from the breakfast bar and head for the main door of our apartment, lifting my warm jacket as I pass the dining table, and turn with a smile when I reach the dark slate door.



‚ÄúOh, wait ‚Ä¶ good luck on meeting your super-hot boss for the first time, Miss Anderson!‚Äù she beams at me excitedly, raising her eyebrows, leaning out across the countertop so all I can see is her head popping out from the kitchen at a funny angle. She looks messy but cute and far too awake for her today. I smile back emptily, not wanting to give my feelings away or show any weakness.



‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù My face heats slightly with the rise of nerves hitting my stomach hard again, but I ignore the sensation, swallowing it all down with the expertise of a seasoned actress.



‚ÄúAre you nervous?‚Äù she probes with a little furrow of her brow, still leaning out a little too far to watch me adjust my briefcase handle and pull my outside jacket on over my suit. I frown back at her question, the tightening knot in my stomach intensifying somewhat, but I shake my head ‚Äòno‚Äô in reply. If I admit it to her, then I admit it to myself, my nerves will get the better of me, and I‚Äôll lose my edge.



That wouldn‚Äôt do at all.



‚ÄúOf course, you‚Äôre not. You never are!‚Äù she adds quickly with a grin and slides back into her little culinary world, oblivious to anything amiss in my behavior today. I smile again as I watch her recede and turn with a wave of my fingertips before heading out the door on my mission to get to work.



Sweet Sarah. She‚Äôs so sure of my capabilities and calm, outward confidence that I sometimes wonder if she even remembers the old me at all, if she even associates me with the girl I was when we met so many years ago?



I close the door behind me quietly, holding onto the handle for a second as I take a deep, steadying breath and take a moment to be still, refusing to let emotion get the better of me and crack my armor. Looking down at the cool silver knob as a way of calming myself once more, I steady that creep of inner nerves and push down all my anxiety and fears.



I can do this.



It‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been working so hard for; finally, my abilities are being recognized after years of hard work and climbing the corporate ladder. I need to push down the inner doubts and the final traces of my adolescent Emma to focus on the tasks ahead of me and the responsibilities I‚Äôll be taking on after today. It is heady and overwhelming, but I steel my nerves inwardly, stilling my hands against me as I‚Äôve practiced a million times in the last ten years. Every day I‚Äôve worked toward this person I‚Äôve become, this cool and confident persona known as Emma Anderson.



It takes a moment to be able to walk away from the door, but as I do, the armor slides up, and the mask fully connects with my face. Each step strengthens my resolve, back to my usual practiced demeanor and inner me, finding the willpower and continued strength to pull this off day after day. I head to the subway station.

Written by James Standard 

FADE IN ‚Äì WHITE SCREEN

A slow, steady HEARTBEAT (SFX).

The white glow fades into‚Äî

INT. DINING ROOM ‚Äì EVENING (FLASHBACK)

Warm golden light across a cozy dining room. A lamp flickers off polished plates. Steam rises from roasted chicken and buttered corn. The faint smell of fresh bread.

Mom LAUGHS, sharp and warm.
Dad chews, eyes flicking toward the FOOTBALL GAME on TV.

TV ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
‚Ä¶he‚Äôs at the twenty, the ten‚Äî!

Silverware CLINKS. Glasses CHIME.
The CHILD watches, smiling softly.

CHILD (V.O.)
As far back as I can remember, it was always us. Together. Happy.

The camera lingers: Mom wiping her hands with a napkin. Dad leaning back with a quiet chuckle. Steam curls past the light. Laughter, football, and silverware blend with the steady heartbeat.

ON SCREEN ‚Äì FAMILY PHOTO

A framed family picture. Everyone smiles.

The CAMERA pushes closer‚Äî

SFX: GLASS CRACKING.

A jagged CRACK splits the glass across their faces.
The picture SPLINTERS.

CUT TO:

INT. BEDROOM ‚Äì NIGHT

CLOSE on a GIRL, stiff on her bed. Muffled YELLING seeps through the walls. A CRASH. She flinches and clutches the blanket tighter, eyes wide.

The CAMERA PULLS BACK, sliding across the room, slipping through the cracked door‚Äî

INT. HALLWAY ‚Äì CONTINUOUS

We TRACK past a broken family PHOTO on a table, glass shattered. A shard on the floor catches a sliver of light.

The YELLING grows clearer.

MAI (O.S.)
David‚Ä¶ stop‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre scaring me.

DAVID (O.S.)
(voice ragged, furious)
Scaring you? You don‚Äôt even know what fear is. I work, I bleed, and for what? To come home to a good-for-nothing bitch like you?

Mai sobs softly, almost inaudible.

DAVID (O.S.)
(overlapping, harsher)
Look at you. Weak. Pathetic. Nobody else would ever want you. You‚Äôre nothing without me.

GLASS SHATTERS ‚Äî a frame SLAMS against the wall.

MAI (O.S.)
(soft, trembling)
Please‚Ä¶ David‚Ä¶ put it down.

DAVID (O.S.)
(snapping, venomous)
Shut your mouth before I shut it for you.

The CAMERA PUSHES FORWARD‚Äî

INT. LIVING ROOM ‚Äì NIGHT

DAVID looms over MAI, a kitchen KNIFE glinting. She‚Äôs pinned to the wall, breathless. His shadow swallows her.

From the hallway, a trembling voice:

DAUGHTER
(soft, afraid)
‚Ä¶Dad?

David freezes. Grip falters. Silence.

Mai‚Äôs eyes flick to the broken shard of the family photo at her feet.
She lunges, snatching it up.

He turns, rage flashing back‚Äî

Mai DRIVES the shard into his chest.

He staggers. The KNIFE CLATTERS to the floor.

The DAUGHTER rushes forward, colliding with him as he falls. Her small hands press into his chest, sticky with blood.

DAVID
(strained, whispering)
‚Ä¶I love you, bug.

His gaze softens for the first time. A final breath rattles out. His body slackens.

The DAUGHTER screams, clinging to him.
Mai pulls her away, trembling.

DAUGHTER
(through sobs, pleading)
Mommy‚Ä¶ he needs us. We need to help Daddy‚Ä¶ Mommy‚Ä¶ why aren‚Äôt we helping him?

Mai‚Äôs face buckles. She covers her mouth, choking back a scream.

Red-and-blue lights flicker through the window, fractured across the broken family photo.

CUT TO:

INT. APARTMENT ‚Äì EVENING (YEARS LATER)

LAURYN (late 20s) sits across from her HUSBAND at the kitchen table. He smirks after a sharp laugh.

HUSBAND
You‚Äôre too sensitive. Always making a big deal out of nothing.

Lauryn lowers her gaze. Calm. Unreadable. Survival mode.

NIA (14) and JAYDEN (11) appear in the doorway.

NIA
Mom, can we order pizza tonight?

JAYDEN
Yeah! And breadsticks too!

Lauryn forces a soft smile.

LAURYN
We‚Äôll see. Homework first.

They groan, then dash off laughing.

Her smile fades. Her hand tightens on her glass.

LAURYN (V.O.)
Sometimes I wonder if I‚Äôm already gone. Like a shadow‚Ä¶

FLASH IMAGE ‚Äì INT. LIVING ROOM (YEARS AGO)

David looms over Mai. Knife glints. His SHADOW swallows her.
(Jagged, quick ‚Äî a nightmare shard.)

BACK TO PRESENT ‚Äì INT. APARTMENT ‚Äì EVENING

Lauryn sits frozen, eyes distant.

LAURYN (V.O.)
‚Ä¶moving through this house‚Ä¶ keeping it together just enough so nobody notices.

She stands and walks down the hall.

The CAMERA HOLDS on the kitchen table. Her glass sits where she left it.

SFX: a faint CRACK.
A thin fracture creeps across the rim.

The CAMERA drifts toward a framed photo of Mai, older, smiling with Lauryn and the kids. Warm smile. Heavy eyes.

CUT TO:

INT. APARTMENT ‚Äì NIGHT

Empty pizza boxes. Greasy paper plates. Half-empty soda.

On the couch, Nia and Jayden tug playfully over the last slice. Their joy fills the room.

Lauryn leans in the kitchen doorway, arms folded. Her face softens ‚Äî for them.

The CAMERA TILTS to reveal her HUSBAND in the armchair. He doesn‚Äôt eat. Doesn‚Äôt laugh. Watches ‚Äî calm, quiet, commanding.

Lauryn catches his stare. The warmth drains. She forces a smile.

NIA
(through a mouthful)
This is the best, Mom.

JAYDEN
Yeah, way better than homework! Can we do pizza night every week?

Lauryn glances at her husband.

HUSBAND
(flat, quiet)
Not every week. It‚Äôs too much. They‚Äôll start expecting it.

The kids groan, then laugh again, unfazed.

LAURYN
He‚Äôs right. Can‚Äôt spoil you.

She carries her cup to the sink. Water streams down its side. She pauses.

CLOSE ON the rim. A thin CRACK spiders under the water.

Lauryn stares ‚Äî her reflection warped in the fracture.

The kids laugh behind her. The husband‚Äôs eyes stay fixed on her, silent.

LAURYN (V.O.)
They‚Äôll never know what I knew. I‚Äôll make sure of it.

INT. APARTMENT ‚Äì BEDROOM ‚Äì NIGHT

Soft nightlight glow. Jayden curled with a stuffed dinosaur. Nia lies across her bed, scrolling.

Lauryn pulls Jayden‚Äôs blanket up, brushes his hair.

LAURYN
Get some sleep, okay? Big day tomorrow.

He nods, half-asleep. She kisses his head.

Across the room, Nia sighs.

NIA
You don‚Äôt have to tuck me in. I‚Äôm not a kid.

Lauryn smiles faintly, takes the phone from Nia‚Äôs hand, sets it aside, smooths her hair.

LAURYN
You‚Äôll always be my kid.

NIA
Goodnight, Mom.

LAURYN
Goodnight, baby.

Lauryn steps into the hall, lingers at the sliver of light‚Ä¶ then gently clicks the door shut. She closes Jayden‚Äôs door, too.

INT. HALLWAY ‚Äì NIGHT

Quiet.

Then her HUSBAND emerges from the bedroom doorway, arms folded.

HUSBAND
(flat, passive-aggressive)
‚ÄúFunny how you can buy junk food, but can‚Äôt keep this place decent.‚Äù

Lauryn exhales softly.

LAURYN
We always eat at home. One night won‚Äôt hurt anyone.

He stares. A low, dismissive hmmph. He turns back into the room.
Lauryn follows. The door closes.

The CAMERA DRIFTS to the living room: dim lamp, empty boxes, lived-in mess.

It continues down the hall ‚Äî slipping through Nia‚Äôs door.

Nia lies awake, eyes open, staring at the ceiling.

CUT TO:

INT. APARTMENT ‚Äì MORNING

Chaos. Backpacks unzip. Shoes scrape. Voices overlap.
Nia shoves books into her bag. Jayden struggles with buttons.

Lauryn, dressed for work, moves quickly ‚Äî coffee in hand, purse on shoulder.

LAURYN
Let‚Äôs go, let‚Äôs go ‚Äî Granny‚Äôs coming soon. I can‚Äôt be late.

The kids light up.

JAYDEN
Yes! Granny‚Äôs coming!

NIA
Finally, someone fun.

Lauryn smirks, kisses their heads, heads for the door.

LAURYN
Be good. I‚Äôll see you tonight.

The door closes behind her.

On the couch, the HUSBAND leans back, phone to his ear, laughing. He doesn‚Äôt look up. Nia helps Jayden straighten his collar.

EXT. APARTMENT ‚Äì CONTINUOUS

A car pulls up. MAI, older now, steps out with tote bags.

She pauses at the glass: Nia helping Jayden; their father on the phone, oblivious.
Something tightens behind her eyes.

INT. APARTMENT ‚Äì CONTINUOUS

The door opens.

NIA
Granny!

Jayden runs to hug her. Nia beams, following.

Mai kneels, arms wide, wraps them both.

MAI
Look at you two. Growing too fast.

The HUSBAND finally glances up.

HUSBAND
Hi, Mai.

MAI
Hey. Good to see you. How‚Äôs the job search coming?

HUSBAND
(flat, a shrug)
Still looking. It‚Äôs hard out here.

Mai nods politely.

MAI
Mmm. Come on, you two ‚Äî shoes on, let‚Äôs go.

They scatter, laughing. Mai rises, eyes flick once more toward the husband, then soften for the kids.

INT. APARTMENT ‚Äì LATER (MORNING)

Mai stands by the door, tote bags in hand. The kids are ready.

MAI
Alright, you two. We ready for school?

NIA / JAYDEN
Yes!

Mai turns to the HUSBAND, still on his call.

MAI
Good luck with the job search. I heard the place down the street is hiring urgently.

HUSBAND
(muting the phone for half a beat)
Thanks.

He nods; back to the call, chuckling.

Mai‚Äôs gaze holds for a beat, unreadable, then back to the kids.

MAI
Come on, let‚Äôs go.

Nia glances back as they step out ‚Äî her father laughing into his phone, already checked out. Not fear. Not confusion. Recognition.

The door shuts.

EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL ‚Äì MORNING

The car idles in the drop-off lane. Kids dart past with bouncing backpacks.

INT. MAI‚ÄôS CAR ‚Äì CONTINUOUS

Jayden wiggles in his seat, lit up.

MAI
Have a good day, sweetheart. I love you.

JAYDEN
(excited, almost shouting)
Love you too, Granny!

He hops out and jogs toward the doors.

Halfway up the walkway, he slows.

Ahead: another boy walks hand-in-hand with Mom and Dad, both leaning down, listening to him chatter. Laughter. Swinging arms.

Jayden stops. His smile falters. The backpack slips off one shoulder.
His small hand grips his stuffed dinosaur tighter. He squeezes it like it‚Äôs the only thing holding him steady.

INT. MAI‚ÄôS CAR ‚Äì CONTINUOUS

Mai sees it. Nia sees it.

NIA
(quiet)
We should walk him in.

Mai nods.

EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL ‚Äì CONTINUOUS

Car doors shut. Mai and Nia catch up to Jayden.
Mai‚Äôs gentle hand on his back; Nia tugs lightly at his sleeve, pulling him forward.

Jayden looks up. His smile returns ‚Äî bright, certain.

They walk together toward the entrance. UNITED.
They disappear inside.


INT. MAI‚ÄôS CAR ‚Äì LATER ‚Äì DRIVING

The school recedes in the rearview. The hum of the engine.

Nia slouches, backpack in her lap, chewing her lip.

NIA
He saw that. With the parents. That‚Äôs why he stopped.

Mai glances at her, then back to the road.

MAI
Mm. He‚Äôs got a big heart. Kids like him feel things deep, even when they don‚Äôt say it.

Nia studies her.

NIA
‚Äú‚Ä¶He doesn‚Äôt say it. But I saw it.‚Äù

Mai rests a hand on Nia‚Äôs knee.

MAI
That‚Äôs ‚Äôcause you‚Äôre looking out for him. Just like your mama did for you.

Nia frowns.

NIA
Mom did?

MAI
(soothing)
Always. Even when it wasn‚Äôt easy. Especially then.

Nia looks out the window; her reflection stares back.

MAI
(soft)
It‚Äôs not your job to carry all the hard things, Nia. Just love your brother. Be his safe place. The rest‚Ä¶ we‚Äôll handle.

Nia nods slowly, gripping her straps.

EXT. MIDDLE SCHOOL ‚Äì MORNING

The car pulls to the curb. Students loiter near the entrance, laughing and shoving as they wait for the bell.

INT. MAI‚ÄôS CAR ‚Äì CONTINUOUS

MAI
Here we are.

Nia already has her backpack on.

NIA
Thanks, Granny.

MAI
Have a good day, sweetheart.

NIA
You too.

Nia steps out into the morning noise. Walks a few steps.
She glances back, a small wave. Mai waves, steady and warm.

Nia disappears into the flow.

INT. MAI‚ÄôS CAR ‚Äì CONTINUOUS

The CAMERA HOLDS on the lower half of Mai‚Äôs face ‚Äî mouth and chin only.

Silence.

Her lips press together. A slow exhale.

MAI
(whisper, breaking)
If only I‚Äôd‚Äî

She can‚Äôt finish. Her jaw trembles. A tear falls, then another, tracing the lines at the corners of her mouth.

She steadies. Turns the wheel. Pulls away.

INT. RICH FAMILY HOME ‚Äì DAY

The bathroom glows pristine: marble and chrome.
LAURYN (late 20s, in uniform) stands at the mirror with a spray bottle.

She stares at her reflection ‚Äî tired eyes, unreadable.
SFX: a faint heartbeat returns, distant.

She raises the bottle, sprays. The glass fogs white. She wipes until her reflection blurs, disappears, then returns.

INT. LUXURY HOME ‚Äì LATER (DAY)

Lauryn wipes down a marble counter. Silence, except for the hum of the AC.
The place gleams ‚Äî polished wood, spotless glass, wealth that feels untouchable.

Her eyes catch on a gilded FAMILY PHOTO: a smiling mother, father, two kids. Sunburnt, carefree, arms linked on a beach.

Lauryn lifts the frame. Her thumb traces the edge.

She holds it longer than she should.
The laughter in the photo almost seems to echo.
The camera closes in on her face ‚Äî still, unreadable, but her eyes carrying something that‚Äôs about to break.

A breath. Barely audible:

LAURYN
(whisper)
Almost enough 

She sets the frame back carefully.

Her expression smooths blank again, like nothing slipped through.
She exhales, lifts the spray bottle, and keeps working.

INT. LAURYN‚ÄôS APARTMENT ‚Äì EVENING

Mai stands in the living room, tote bag by her side. Nia and Jayden finish homework at the table.

Mai‚Äôs phone BUZZES. She glances down.

ON SCREEN ‚Äì TEXT (MAI):
‚ÄúNeed me to give you a ride home tonight?‚Äù

ON SCREEN ‚Äì TEXT (LAURYN):
‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ thanks, Mom.‚Äù

Mai exhales softly, tucking the phone away. Her gaze lingers on the kids, tender, protective.

Jayden‚Äôs eyes flick curiously to the tote.

JAYDEN
(grinning)
Granny, you bring us candy?

He reaches toward the bag.

Mai gently but quickly pulls it closer to her leg, smiling warmly.

MAI
Nice try. This is grown-up stuff. You‚Äôve had enough sugar for one night.

Jayden pouts but laughs, bouncing back to his worksheets. Nia smirks, rolling her eyes.

Mai smooths Jayden‚Äôs hair, her voice kind but firm.

MAI
I‚Äôm going to pick up your mama. You two behave till we get back, alright?

The kids nod. Nia gives a little mock salute.

Mai kisses Jayden‚Äôs head, brushes Nia‚Äôs cheek, then grabs her tote and heads for the door.

MAI
Love you both. Be good.

KIDS (overlapping)
Love you, Granny!

The door shuts gently behind her.



INT. MAI‚ÄôS CAR ‚Äì EVENING

The hum of the road. Streetlights sweep across the windshield in slow rhythm.

Lauryn sits in the passenger seat, hands folded tight in her lap. Mai glances over now and then, reading her daughter without needing words.

MAI
You‚Äôve been quiet.

LAURYN
Just tired. Long day.

(Silence. The sound of the tires on the road fills the space.)

MAI
(soft, but firm)
You always say that. But I know tired when I see it‚Ä¶ and I know worn-down when I see it too.

Lauryn swallows, eyes locked on the road ahead.

LAURYN
It‚Äôs not the kids. You know that. They‚Äôre‚Ä¶ the only good part of the day.

MAI
(smiles faintly)
Jayden and that dinosaur‚Ä¶ he carried it out of the house like treasure.

Lauryn chuckles under her breath, just barely.

LAURYN
He won‚Äôt sleep without it. Says it keeps the ‚Äúmonsters‚Äù away.

MAI
Smart boy. He knows who to hold onto.

(Beat. Lauryn‚Äôs smile fades. She shifts uneasily.)

LAURYN
Nia too. She notices things. More than I thought. Sometimes I catch her watching me‚Ä¶ like she‚Äôs checking to see if we‚Äôre safe.

Mai‚Äôs hands tighten on the wheel.

MAI
That‚Äôs not a weight a girl her age should carry.

LAURYN
I know.

(Another silence. Mai breathes in, voice gentler now.)

MAI
You and the kids‚Ä¶ you were always welcome at my place. Always.

Lauryn exhales, her voice steady but heavy.

LAURYN
I know, Mom. But you didn‚Äôt have the space. Not the way they needed. He had the house, the rooms. I chose what gave them the most, even if it cost me.

Mai glances at her, guilt flickering across her face.

MAI
(quiet, breaking)
You shouldn‚Äôt have had to make that choice.

LAURYN
(steady, almost a whisper)

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been saving. Every dollar. Now‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs finally enough. To get them out‚Äù

Mai‚Äôs eyes flick toward her. Hope, but fear too.

MAI
And he doesn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ he doesn‚Äôt hurt them?

Lauryn shakes her head, firm.

LAURYN
No. He‚Äôs good with them. All of it‚Ä¶ lands on me.

Her voice cracks but steadies again.

LAURYN
That‚Äôs why I stayed. Because they were safe. Because I could take it if it meant they didn‚Äôt have to.

Mai blinks back tears. She reaches across the console, rests a hand on Lauryn‚Äôs.

MAI
Lauryn‚Ä¶ you shouldn‚Äôt have to take it at all.

Lauryn finally turns to her, her eyes full. A whisper, almost to herself:

LAURYN
Soon.

(The car fills with silence. Only the hum of the road remains. Mai squeezes her daughter‚Äôs hand as the headlights stretch into the dark.)

INT. HALLWAY ‚Äì NIGHT

The house is dim, only the hum of the kitchen light audible. Lauryn steps inside, setting her bag down softly. She notices the sink still running. A bottle lies empty on the counter.

She turns toward the bedrooms ‚Äî urgent, protective ‚Äî when a SHADOW spreads across the wall behind her.

HUSBAND
(low, slurred but sharp)
Where the hell you been?

Lauryn stiffens. She doesn‚Äôt turn right away.

LAURYN
Just got home. Long shift.

HUSBAND
(mocking, bitter laugh)
Long shift. Right. Phone in your pocket the whole damn time. Can‚Äôt answer me?

Lauryn finally faces him. His jaw is tight, eyes bloodshot.

LAURYN
You were drinking. I didn‚Äôt want the kids hearing us fight.

HUSBAND
(snapping)
Don‚Äôt you start with me. Don‚Äôt you dare.

He steps forward, boxing her in near the hallway to the kids‚Äô rooms.

From behind a locked door ‚Äî a muffled shuffle. Jayden‚Äôs little voice whispers, barely audible:

JAYDEN (V.O.)
(whisper)
Nia‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs mad.

Nia hushes him, slipping headphones over his ears.

Lauryn tries to keep her voice steady.

LAURYN
(quiet, firm)
They‚Äôre sleeping. Don‚Äôt wake them.

HUSBAND
(leans in, venomous)
This ain‚Äôt about them. This is about you. You think you can ignore me? Make me look like a fool in my own house?

Lauryn‚Äôs back presses against the wall. Her eyes flick toward Jayden‚Äôs door, just for a second ‚Äî and he notices.

HUSBAND
(voice drops, cold)
Don‚Äôt even think about it. They‚Äôre not saving you.

His shadow looms over her as the tension thickens.


INT. HALLWAY ‚Äì NIGHT

The SHADOW of the HUSBAND looms over Lauryn, boxing her in. His breath reeks of alcohol.

HUSBAND
(snaps)
Don‚Äôt you ignore me again.

He grabs her wrist. She jerks back, nails raking across his arm ‚Äî leaving three angry red lines.

HUSBAND
(yells, pained)
Bitch!

He lunges. She shoves against his chest, clawing for space, but he slams her into the wall. A family frame crashes to the ground beside them, glass splintering.

Lauryn fights back ‚Äî elbow to his ribs, a sharp kick to his shin. He stumbles, swears.

For a moment, she breaks free, sprinting toward the kitchen.

He catches her by the hair, yanking her back hard.

HUSBAND
(gritted teeth)
You think you can fight me? In my house?

He drags her across the floor, her fingernails scraping the linoleum. She lashes out, scratching his face, catching his cheek ‚Äî a streak of blood wells up.

HUSBAND
(Yelling)
This is on you Lauryn!

INT. KITCHEN ‚Äì CONTINUOUS

He slams her into the counter, forcing her head toward the running sink.

Water gushes. Plates rattle in the sink 

He presses her face close, the spray hitting her cheeks.

HUSBAND
(venomous, echoing David‚Äôs cruelty)

‚ÄúNo good bitch‚Ä¶ nothing without me.‚Äù

Lauryn thrashes, gasping, fingers clawing at the edge of the counter.

Her nails dig into his arms again ‚Äî another deep scratch ‚Äî but his grip only tightens

INT. KIDS‚Äô ROOM ‚Äì SAME TIME

Behind a locked door ‚Äî Nia holds Jayden close. He‚Äôs trembling, clutching his dinosaur tight. She presses the headphones harder over his ears, whispering.

NIA
(shaky, whispering)
It‚Äôs okay. Don‚Äôt listen. Just stay with me.

Tears streak her face as the muffled chaos carries through the walls ‚Äî the violent CRASH, her mother‚Äôs muffled cries.

Nia‚Äôs eyes dart to her phone on the desk. She hesitates, then quickly grabs it with trembling hands.

She unlocks it, whispering almost to herself:

NIA
Come on, come on‚Ä¶ pick up.

She dials Granny (Mai), her thumb shaking on the screen.

The line rings. Jayden buries his face against her, clutching his dinosaur tighter.

NIA
(whisper, urgent)
Granny‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs bad. Mom needs you. Please‚Ä¶ come now.

She lowers her voice, afraid he might hear through the walls.

NIA
(quiet, breaking)
Please hurry.

INT. KITCHEN ‚Äì NIGHT

Lauryn‚Äôs face is still forced under the stream. Her body jerks weakly, her fingernails scraping at the counter. The Husband‚Äôs grip is iron.

HUSBAND
(venomous, spitting)
Say it ‚Äî you need me. Say it.‚Äù

Lauryn‚Äôs legs thrash one last time‚Äîthen falter.

SFX: DOOR BURSTS OPEN.

The Husband jerks his head.

MAI stands in the doorway, breathless, tote bag slipped from her shoulder. Her eyes widen at the sight: Lauryn pinned, drowning in her own kitchen.

In one swift motion, Mai yanks open the tote ‚Äî her hand closes around a small pistol.

MAI
(yelling, breaking)
LET HER GO!

The Husband snarls, tightening his grip, using Lauryn as a shield.

HUSBAND
(taunting, barking)
Put it down, old woman! You‚Äôll hit her‚Äî

Mai‚Äôs hands shake, but her eyes don‚Äôt waver.

MAI
(through tears, steel in her voice)
Not my daughter. Not again.

SFX: GUNSHOT.

The Husband freezes. Blood blooms across his shirt. His grip loosens, Lauryn collapsing to the floor, coughing and gasping for air.

He stumbles back, eyes wide, trying to speak‚Äîbut nothing comes. He collapses against the counter, then to the floor.

Silence, except for Lauryn‚Äôs wet, ragged breaths.

Mai drops the tote. The pistol clatters onto the linoleum. She rushes forward, gathering Lauryn into her arms.

MAI
(whispering, desperate)
Baby, I‚Äôm here‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm here. Stay with me.

Lauryn‚Äôs trembling hand grips her mother‚Äôs shirt, clinging with the last of her strength.

From the hallway, the kids‚Äô door creaks open. Nia peeks out first, Jayden clutched against her side, his dinosaur still in his arms. Both wide-eyed, frozen.

Mai looks up at them, tears streaking down her face.

MAI
(soft, breaking)
It‚Äôs okay‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs over now.

The children rush into the kitchen, dropping beside their mother.

Lauryn coughs violently, water pouring from her mouth. She tries to breathe, but every gasp rattles, shallow and broken. Her chest heaves, but the air won‚Äôt come ‚Äî drowning on dry land.

LAURYN
(weak, breathless)
I love you‚Ä¶ I love you so much.

She fumbles at her apron pocket ‚Äî pulls out an envelope, worn and stuffed full. She presses it into Nia‚Äôs hands.

LAURYN
(strained, whisper)
‚ÄúFor you‚Ä¶ for Jayden. For the life I‚Äôve always wanted to give you 

Her head leans back into Mai‚Äôs arms, her breath rattling.

The CAMERA HOLDS on the kids clutching her, the dinosaur caught between them, wet with tears.

INT. KITCHEN ‚Äì NIGHT

Lauryn lies limp in Mai‚Äôs arms, her kids clutched tight against her, the dinosaur wedged between them. The envelope of money rests in Nia‚Äôs trembling hands.

Silence hangs, broken only by Lauryn‚Äôs ragged, fading breaths.

SFX: distant sirens.

The faint red-and-blue glow flickers through the cracked blinds, washing over the broken glass on the floor.

CLOSE ON ‚Äì LAURYN‚ÄôS FACE. Her chest rises faintly‚Ä¶ one last heartbeat pulses in the silence.

SFX: HEARTBEAT (slow‚Ä¶ slower‚Ä¶ then stops.)

Her head tilts, her body slackening against Mai.

The camera pulls back ‚Äî framing Mai, the children, the broken room, and the flashing police lights cutting across them.

FADE TO BLACK.

EXT. CEMETERY ‚Äì AFTERNOON (YEARS LATER)

Autumn leaves drift across a quiet cemetery. The sky is soft gray, sunlight breaking gently through the clouds.

Nia (late teens now) stands beside Jayden (taller, but still carrying traces of childhood in his face). They walk slowly toward a polished gravestone.

ON THE HEADSTONE:
LAURYN WILLIAMS
Beloved Daughter. Cherished Mother. Forever in Our Hearts.

They pause in front of it. Nia kneels first, running her hand across the engraved name. Her eyes glisten, but her expression carries strength.

Jayden steps forward. In his hands is the worn, stuffed dinosaur. The stitching is frayed, its colors faded ‚Äî but it‚Äôs still whole.

He kneels and sets it gently at the base of the grave. His hand lingers on it.

JAYDEN
(soft, breaking)
‚ÄúIt always protected me‚Ä¶ like you did.‚Äù

Nia puts an arm around his shoulders. Together, they bow their heads in silence.

A soft wind passes through the trees, rustling the leaves.

CLOSE ON ‚Äî the dinosaur, resting against the stone.

The CAMERA PULLS BACK, framing the siblings together ‚Äî united, older, but carrying their mother‚Äôs love forward.

They rise slowly. Nia wipes her eyes; Jayden grips her hand as they walk back toward the car.

Mai stays behind, standing before the headstone. Her hand trembles as she reaches down, tracing her daughter‚Äôs name carved in stone.

MAI
(whispering, breaking)
I‚Äôm sorry, baby‚Ä¶ for everything you had to carry. For the nights I didn‚Äôt protect you. For letting you believe you were ever alone.

Her breath catches. She steadies herself.

You don‚Äôt have to fight anymore. Rest now. I‚Äôll keep them safe. I promise.

Her tears fall onto the stone. She leans down, presses her lips gently to her daughter‚Äôs name.

Behind her, the kids wait by the car, watching. Nia holds Jayden close, protective the way Lauryn once was.

Mai straightens, wipes her eyes, and turns toward them. Her face is worn, but her steps are steady. She gathers them both into her arms, guiding them toward the car.

The CAMERA HOLDS on the grave ‚Äî the dinosaur resting against it, autumn wind stirring the leaves.

FADE OUT.

We argue that Bitcoin‚Äôs original job wasn‚Äôt to be an antique or a settlement trophy‚Äîit was to be **peer-to-peer electronic cash**. Low fees, fast finality, everyday payments. If that‚Äôs the north star, we should judge tech, UX, and narratives by whether they make paying a human **simple** again.

**Key points from the op-ed:**

* **UTXO ‚â† Wall Street ledger.** It‚Äôs built for simple, auditable spends‚Äîperfect for cash-like payments.
* **Fees & latency should serve users, not speculation.** If paying a coffee feels like wiring bonds, we lost the plot.
* **Narrative discipline matters.** ‚ÄúNumber go up‚Äù is not a payments strategy. ‚ÄúCash that clears‚Äù is.
* **Practical rails win.** QR invoices, NFC, OP\_RETURN receipts, and reliable wallets beat buzzwords.

**Why this matters now:**  
If crypto is to outlive hype cycles, it has to be **useful** on boring Tuesdays. The chains and stacks that deliver fast, neutral settlement for real people will win.

4. We said we‚Äôre just getting coffee but might consider getting a meal from the cafe too. Should I ask her when she last ate or just go with coffee? Dlow feeling like ice cream after. Is this too much

Plus, adulting sucks and finding friends in the real world is like pulling teeth sometimes. Probably doesn't help I'm in a field that's primarily glued to their computers 24/7 and antisocial to an extent. 

Likes: Horror movies, metal/pop punk long walks on the beach (kidding), DnD (never played but wanna), RPGS, MMOS, occult-y things, comics, 3d printing, ADHD fueled deep dives into random topics and conspiracy theories, tattoos, cosplay, uh...coffee. Yeah think that covers it. 

Games: REPO, Enshrouded, The Forest, WoW, GW1, FF XIV, Smalland, Grounded, Among Us, Fall Guys, Monster Hunter World, Monster Prom, Schedule 1, Diablo 3/4, Deep Rock Galactic, and...that's all can pull off the top of my head, but there's probably more out there.

Looking for: People to chat with during the day, pass the time, and potentially play games with. Open to voice chat, maybe even video call depending on the vibe. Please at least know how to carry a conversation.

Patience and understanding is big for me. I'm not around 24/7, but I'm also not exactly the type to not talk for days and then suddenly reappear.

I built [RapidApply](http://rapidapply.io). a Chrome extension that helps job seekers generate tailored cover letters instantly, right there on the job application page. No extra tabs, no copy-paste gymnastics. It autodetects the job you‚Äôre looking at and uses your resume to spin up a cover letter on the spot. Unlike those AI ‚Äúauto apply‚Äù tools that treat jobs like Tinder profiles (swipe right on 200 jobs, land none, lol), this is for people who actually want to send solid applications without wasting 45 minutes per letter. I built it after a summer of applying to 100s of jobs myself and realising cover letters are the single worst bottleneck. My aim is to keep chipping away at these pain points until applying feels frictionless.

# My Customers

Target audience = job seekers (duh). Especially folks blasting out multiple applications but still wanting them to look human. The goal is to make going from job post ‚Üí tailored application ‚Üí submit happen in seconds, without spamming or sending ChatGPT soup. 

Stage

MVP launched. Extension works. I‚Äôm not raising money (yet), just trying to see if anyone outside my friends actually gives a damn. One buddy even nicknamed it ‚ÄúAI Clippy‚Äù which is both hilarious and feels mildly insulting, idk why.

# Conversion Strategy

Subreddits like r/GetEmployed, job boards, and TikTok ‚Äúday in the life of a job seeker‚Äù content. Basically going where the desperate unemployed are. (I‚Äôve been that desperate unemployed guy, not throwing shade ;).

# Why Me

Built this out of pure hatred for cover letters and a dependency on coffee that could kill a small horse. I‚Äôm a data scientist with some frontend chops, no rich daddy, no VC safety net. Just me seeing how far stubbornness and caffeine can take me

Alright, friends, let‚Äôs chat about something super important: face it, **the AI revolution is here**‚Äîand if we don‚Äôt hop on this train now, we might just end up watching it leave from the sidelines with a sad expression üò¢. Who wants that? Not me, and I bet not you either!

Remember the good ol‚Äô days? When mastering Microsoft Word felt like landing a spaceship on the moon? Well, times have changed, and while typing up that perfect letter is still essential, the real game-changer is now **AI**. Is your head spinning yet? Mine is a bit too! But that‚Äôs okay; we‚Äôll break it down together.

Here‚Äôs the deal: if you don‚Äôt start upskilling NOW, you might miss out on oodles of job opportunities. Like, think about it:

- **AI can automate mundane tasks**. Are you still doing things manually that you could have the robots take care of? It‚Äôs a classic case of ‚Äúwork smarter, not harder.‚Äù
  
- **AI knows trends before they even happen**. Seriously, while we‚Äôre over here sipping coffee, AI is crunching numbers, analyzing data, and predicting what‚Äôs next. Why not work with it?

- **Opportunities are popping up everywhere**. Companies are looking for folks who can integrate AI tools into their workflow. Do you want to be the one stuck in the past while everyone around you is thriving?

But hey, don‚Äôt worry if you feel overwhelmed! Here‚Äôs what can help you get started:

1. **Identify where you can integrate AI**: What tasks in your current job could benefit from AI? Start there! 

2. **Take online courses**: There are tons of resources available‚Äîlike this educational program I stumbled upon [here](https://whop.com/imagine-education-ai/?a=liveitupdeals). Dive into learning the skills that matter NOW! 

3. **Join communities**: Places like our very own ""AiContentAutomators"" are perfect for sharing insights, support, and resources. The community can be a great motivator.

4. **Experiment with AI tools**: Don‚Äôt just read about it; try it! Get hands-on experience with platforms like ChatGPT, Jasper, or any others you find interesting.

And about that fear of being replaced? Just think of AI as your new best friend‚Äîone that can help you become even better at what you do. Instead of worrying about robots taking over your job, focus on how you can become invaluable in an AI-driven world.

So, what‚Äôs the holdup? Is it time to embrace the tech, or are we just going to sit around hoping everything stays the same? ü§î Life‚Äôs too short for that kind of wishful thinking!

1nidr8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/1nidr8d/anyone_up_for_a_casual_conversation/,Anyone up for a casual conversation?,"I unfortunately don't have many friends left in my life due to differences in our priorities, such as my friends all have kids or love to do trips and that's all they talk about.

My boyfriend also finds my hobbies boring (unless it benefits him, then he is asking for me to paint like my life depends on it) and my travel plans unreasonable (I would like a week in Italy, it's a 3hdrive from where we live and we can afford it)

So I would like to have some online friends that I can talk to:

- I like to paint a lot of flowers and have been trying to expand the area by painting houses and gardens, but as I mentioned I don't have the joy to do so as my boyfriend insists only on racecars and mocks me when I do what I like
- I like traveling and would love to travel one day, and talk about destinations, plan trips, look up plane tickets etc, but I have no one to travel with
- I love reading, especially thrilles, detectives, history, romance 
- I draw, I have a sketch book when I draw and sketch something and the 642 things to draw book where I try to do more realistic drawing.
- I love opera
- I love coffee, tea and coffee shops
- I like baking 

No, I don't have an issue with kids, my boyfriend has two, but I can't live listening just to this and he is really obsessed with them. He doesn't have any time for us anymore, even when we live together, because he is using all his energy and time one then. Dates, unless it's something he wants, I can forget about it, plans, just when it matters for him and his kids. I can't remember when was the last time we did something I enjoyed, I didn't even got a birthday cake for my birthday and all said ""we haven't forgotten, we make one for you"", this is almost a year ago.

So yeah, anyone up for an online friendship where we can talk about our hobbies, ideas, maybe even plan a random trip? ",2,1758018591.0,CasualConversation,5,1.0,False

1nido8n,https://i.redd.it/3wcyexdz6ipf1.jpeg,What‚Äôs the hype for Khamrah Qahwa?,"
I‚Äôll start from the beginning.

There was a lot of hype for Khamrah at first so I dived blind and bought a full bottle, only to realise that it‚Äôs sickeningly sweet but good for those who enjoy that cinnamony sweet vanilla fusions. That‚Äôs not me. 

Then came Khamrah Qahwa. Everyone was jumping up and down that its not sweet like OG and is sooo good, they can‚Äôt stop smelling it. But ek baar kata hai blind buy karke so I went for decant. 

And‚Ä¶.

What‚Äôs the hype about? The initial scent is good. Won‚Äôt call it out of the world, ‚Äòomg! Nerve-wreckingly good, yo!‚Äô sorts. 

The dry down though? Where‚Äôs coffee? I don‚Äôt see traces of coffee dur dur tak. 

Definitely powdery and that‚Äôs somehow blended with spicy vanilla. That mix is very good, ngl.

But the dry down‚Ä¶there‚Äôs no coffee. It smells like I have a spicy vanilla scent on but dropped a cup of concentrated tea decoction on myself and had no time to change. 

I understand ‚Äòqahwa‚Äô itself means tea here. But, the brand did not mention this note anywhere. Coffee? There‚Äôs no coffee. Or maybe, I can‚Äôt smell it. 

It‚Äôs a hard pass, guys. What do u think?
