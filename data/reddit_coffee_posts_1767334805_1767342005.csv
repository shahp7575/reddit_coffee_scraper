# Taste the Difference: Why Local Coffee Roasters Win

Forget bland, mass-produced coffee. When you choose coffee roasted right in your neighborhood, you're unlocking a world of flavor and freshness that simply can't be matched. Local roasters are passionate artisans, dedicated to bringing you the best possible cup, from bean to brew.

What sets local roasters apart? It’s their commitment to quality at every step. They source beans meticulously, often working directly with farmers to ensure ethical and sustainable practices. Roasting is an art form for them, finely tuned to the specific beans they're working with, bringing out unique tasting notes you wouldn't find elsewhere. Plus, you get that incredible aroma of freshly roasted beans wafting from their shops – a true sign of quality.

*   **Unrivaled Freshness:** Coffee is best enjoyed shortly after roasting. Local roasters offer beans roasted just days, not months, ago.
*   **Unique Flavor Profiles:** Discover nuanced flavors like fruity, floral, or chocolatey notes, tailored by the roaster's expertise.
*   **Support Your Community:** Buying local keeps money in your neighborhood, supporting small businesses and creating local jobs.

Ready to elevate your morning ritual? Visit your nearest local coffee roaster today and experience the vibrant taste of expertly roasted beans.

Been researching and overthinking for quite a while now. I am in the market for a grinder. It will be my first one ever.

I currently have it narrowed down to either spend 450 EUR on a lagom Casa 65 of splurge and just get a Mazzer Philos.

I currently don't have an espresso machine, but will be buying it alongside the grinder. Probably a gaggia e24.

Anyway, I currently have. a Fellow Aiden, a Hario V60, fully automatic machine (thanks to my girlfriend) for our milk based drinks and other coffees (I drink V60, Americano, Moka pot, occasional espresso).

We shop at a local coffeeshop for our beans. Currently a fan of medium range of beans and slightly darker side. 

My preferences are' easy workflow, low noise, aesthetics, and simple cleaning as well as easy way to dial in multiple brew methods.

I’m fully aware this is also conical vs flat, but I’m just concerned  in which makes sense as a first grinder given my current brew methods.
Want one grinder that stays enjoyable and frustration-free

So... Should I start with the Casa and upgrade later if needed?
Or just go “buy once, buy for life” and get the Philos now?
Appreciate honest takes, especially from people who’ve started with either grinder or went through a similar path..

Ps: I also looked at Timemore, DF64 etc, but I keep going back to the Casa as a great allrounder compared to these. ",1,1767341527.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

In the tenth year of our marriage, my former best friend posted a photo. 

In the picture, she was holding her daughter, and my husband was holding my son. 

The four of them were nestled close together, looking intimate. 

The caption read: “Who says I can’t have both a son and a daughter?” 

I commented underneath: “A match made in heaven.” 

A second later, the post vanished. 

The next day, my husband stormed home. “Sophie is finally starting to feel a little better,” he snapped. “Why did you have to go and provoke her?” 

My son actually shoved me, shouting, “It’s all your fault! You made Tina cry!” 

I pulled out the divorce papers and slammed them onto the table. 

“You’re right. It is my fault,” I said coldly. “So I’m leaving. Now you can go be a happy family of four.” 

I had printed the divorce papers just half an hour ago. 

Before that, I had sat rigid on the living room sofa all night. 

The dozen or so dishes I had carefully prepared remained untouched on the dining table. 

The Ultraman–themed cake had long since melted beyond recognition. 

Yesterday was my son Andy Miller’s birthday. 

My husband, Ethan Miller, had specifically instructed me to prepare everything at home, promising he would bring Andy back to celebrate. 

I waited and waited, only to see Sophie’s social media post showing their family of four. 

How utterly ridiculous.

Ethan hadn’t expected the divorce. He frowned, his face clouded with annoyance, and tore the papers in half. 

“Leah Jones, what drama are you pulling now?” he sneered. 

“All I did was take our son to see Sophie and her daughter. I forgot to tell you, that’s all.” 

As he spoke, his gaze drifted to the unused feast on the table. A flicker of undeniable guilt crossed his eyes. 

He softened his tone, adopting the familiar appeasement strategy. 

“Alright, I was wrong not to contact you last night. I’ll be more careful in the future. I’ll clean up this mess. You go get some sleep. I’ll take you and Andy out for lunch.” 

That was his classic routine: a slap followed by a piece of candy. 

He knew he had overstepped, but he would never offer a true apology, only a small gesture to save face. 

If I didn’t take the olive branch, he would employ the silent treatment until I inevitably cracked. 

In the past, I had always given in first. 

But this time, I simply pulled out another copy of the divorce papers and slammed it on the coffee table: “I printed dozens of copies. Tear up every last one if you like.” 

Ethan was so furious he smashed a ceramic bowl against the wall. 

He glared at me impatiently. 

“Let’s be honest, you’re just jealous that Andy prefers Sophie, aren’t you? 

“Leah, don’t you forget, you’re the one who owes her! Andy and I taking care of her and her daughter is just us atoning for your sin!” 

Atoning? 

But what sin have I committed? 

Sophie and I were once best friends. During the summer break of our junior year in college, she asked me to hang out. 

That evening, when it was time to go home, I wanted to take the main road, but she insisted on taking a shortcut, saying a friend was waiting for her at the intersection.

So we went our separate ways. 

But when I woke up, Ethan had rushed to my house and grabbed me by the collar. 

He demanded to know why I didn’t call the police, why I didn’t look out for Sophie 

I was completely confused.

I later pieced together the truth: Sophie had been savagely assaulted by a few thugs on that shortcut. 

She claimed she was caught only because she was trying to divert the men away from me. 

She was lying. 

I tried my best to explain, but with the security cameras conveniently broken, no one believed a word I said. I was left to take the blame. 

From that day forward, I was branded a sinner in everyone’s eyes. 

My parents called me heartless, and Ethan publicly accused me of being cold–blooded. 

Under the guise of atonement, they transferred all the love they once had for me to Sophie. 

They even stole my child, branding me morally corrupt and unfit to raise him. 

That was the source of the distance between Andy and me. 

But I loved him fiercely, and I worked desperately to mend our broken bond. 

I looked at Andy, and his gaze met mine. 

It was cold, tinged with pure disgust, as if he were staring at his greatest enemy. 

“You ruined Dad’s and Sophie’s lives,” he accused. “Without you, Sophie would be my mom.” 

I staggered back, my heart seized by immense pain. 

“Who told you that?” 

Andy frowned, utterly convinced. “Isn’t it true?” 

I lifted my eyes from my son’s face and fixed my gaze directly on Ethan. 

In that moment, I was still, somehow, hoping he would explain.

Why haven’t you defended me? He was my childhood sweetheart; I was the one who introduced

1q1t1wh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1q1t1wh/aio_for_how_i_handled_this/,AIO for how I handled this?,"Im in college and I had started talking to a girl a while ago, thought we were getting along well we had a lot in common, we seemed to get a long great we were texting and going out frequently. Then after doing this consistently for a little over a month I confessed that I liked her a lot and was honest about how I wanted to take it further. She said “I’d have to know you a little longer before that” alright that’s fair I said and thought to myself. I had no problem being just friends but after that she stopped talking to me as much and stopped hanging out with me. 

I wonder if I had done something wrong and when me and a friend in my department were going back and forth talking about relationship stuff I brought up that I thought I had done something wrong. Turns out she was ALSO dating someone in the same department as us and a guy that this friend is really close friends with. And they were hanging out so much that the guy (let’s call him John for now) wasn’t getting any work done on his end for this friend’s project. 

The next few weeks were weird. She would start to text me very sparsely, often leaving me on read, she would ask to hang out and then bail, and when I would next see her finally after weeks of this behavior she suggests we go to a sandwich shop, so we get there, and she’s a regular there so she knows the guy working the register and he looks at me when we walk in and I shit you not he goes “Oh you’re not John” and she just kinda awkwardly laughs and requests we get the food to go and eat at a park. As we’re walking to my car I say “So you’ve been hanging out with John a lot?” and she says “Oh only because we’re in the same band” 

We do just that and then as she’s leaving she says “Hey if you wanna do something this weekend let me know” I ask if she wants to get coffee that weekend she says she’s not available. Jump forward a few days later to Forum. Now we’re all having to go to this forum and as we’re walking out I see her, I say hey to her, she doesn’t even look at me and is all up on John. So I had enough and when I saw my friend from before I told her everything that happened the last time we had went out, they claim they left my name out when they were talking to John about her going out with me and downplaying their relationship (turns out they were way more serious then “just in the same band” they were serious for about as long as I was dating her. Which is extra weird because her and John are in the same band which she had wanted me to join at one point) and so John and her had a fight and I was blocked (they were apparently fighting a lot according to his friends and John was supposedly scared of her). 

But turns out guess that she forgot I still follow her art account and John’s still posting positive comments on her page despite the supposed “fight” they had according to what his friends had told me. 

Now that makes me wonder was I overreacting in how I handled this? Should I have just said nothing and not possibly burned that bridge? I didn’t really care that they were in a relationship what I didn’t like was that she wasn’t honest about their relationship and that she stopped treating me like I was a friend. Just someone to avoid.

1q1t1s0,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1q1t1s0/mother_has_been_hostile_all_day_because_i_cleaned/,Mother has been hostile all day because I cleaned the house,"I dont even know if this is the right place to post but I need someone to tell me I'm not insane or stupid (I have been called both today).

My mother (62) is disabled and has significant mental illnesses. I am her sole caregiver and I have been for 15 years (I am now 31). She is pretty regularly emotionally abusive and threatens to report me, fire me, throw me out, etc, anytime I do something she doesn't like. She threatened to throw coffee on me right before Thanksgiving. She has gotten physical in the past, especially when I was a kid. I have been to therapy but I aged out of insurance, so here I am.

Today is January 1st. New year. I thought it would be nice to do a little house cleaning and change the sheets, so that was the first thing I started with this morning. Using one of those carpet hair scraper tools woke her up (I dont ever vacuum when she's alseep) and her first complaint was that I was ""stirring up her allergies"". She had a hostile tone the entire time I was cleaning, as she followed me around and stood over me while I was scrubbing the floor on my hands and knees, dumping/cleaning the cats litter box, cleaning the cats water fountain and dishes, etc. During this time, the cat jumped onto something unstable and scared himself when it fell to the floor, which was of course my fault and not just something that happens with cats. The cat was not hurt and even let me groom him after my walk, he ate his food, he slept in my lap while I was at the computer, and he took his customary late afternoon nap. But mother treated all of these very normal things as signs that my cleaning had somehow ""broken the cat and his trust"". The cat, for the record, has refused to be held by her all day, probably because he senses her mood and tone. He's chill with me.

She's spent all day muttering to the cat about how she understands him, how bad I am for ""throwing him off"" and how I ""do it to her too"". Again, the only thing I did was deep clean the litter box, clean the floors, change sheets, and do other laundry. When she isn't being passive aggressive outloud by ""talking to the cat"", she harps on about how I was supposed to do all of those tasks on Friday, because thats when I said I would (I do usually do laundry on Fridays). But I checked the weather and it was better to get laundry done today anyway to not risk frozen pipes, and it was also the scheduled day for the litter box, which I was always going to do today. 

She has accused me of ""not having the instinct to care for other living things"". But...keeping a clean environment for BOTH of them is part of caring, right?? It's literally my job to clean the house. Its good for the cat to have a clean box. I didnt do anything wrong. I KNOW I didn't do anything wrong, except finally snapping back at her about how she was ignorant about the cat's routine because she usually sleeps through it. She called me dumb, so I volleyed back. I'm probably not supposed to do that, but I do defend myself after a certain point. I dont like being talked down to, particularly when I haven't done anything to deserve it. 

I made a passing comment, while I was making the beds and she was just...watching with hostile energy, that I'm only one person and that I'm just trying to get things done. She told me I have no idea what its like to struggle, because she took care of her mom for a couple of years and 2 kids and held down a job. (Contrast to me, a childless spinster who was recently laid off in November.) The belittling isnt new, of course. When I was employed with a second job, she called that income ""chump change"" despite me making pretty decent money for a freelance gig. She also likes to say how I dont have experience doing anything (admin tasks or packing for a hotel are recent examples), which is always *great* to hear. Not like my lack of life experience is because I've devoted my entire adult life and most of my teenage years to making sure she's fed, clothed, clean, and taken care of. 

Anyway. It's been 12 hours of this bad attitude from her and I just...couldnt take it anymore. So I put on my coat at 11 at night and walked to the nearby park to just stand in the freezing rain to cry in privacy. My thoughts got dark here (pretty normal for me; I've struggled with ideation since I was 8 and I have no clear happy memories of my childhood). When I was leaving, she tried to stop me by threatening to report me to her case manager (for what???), tried to tell me I was abandoning the cat, demanded the keys to the house, threatened to lock the dead bolt and ""good luck getting back in"", and then tried to stop me from closing the door because ""I wont let you slam it!"" Mind you, I was moving unhurried and just trying to hold myself together for a few more seconds.

 When I was done crying and cold enough, I came back home and found her smoking on the porch. Again, she demanded the house keys because ""I won't let you lock me out"". Anytime we have a conflict, she goes back to this idea that I'm going to lock her out of the house. I've never threatened to do that (unlike her). I dont know why she thinks I would do that, but I didnt give her the keys either. 

I'm just tired. I'm pretty stuck in my situation, given my recent job loss and the economy. My only friend lives in another state, mom is (big surprise) estranged from all her siblings, and my uninvolved brother lives 6 hours away. If I could be anywhere else, I would be. Like, I know she's unhappy being disabled and pretty miserable all of the time, but I also know that rationally, I didn't do anything wrong by cleaning. But I FEEL like I did. I kind of just want to sleep and not wake up. ",2,1767341403.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

This is my first time taking any type of birth control. The days I was taking the active pills was fine, didn’t have any symptoms or side effects until the first day of my placebo week I threw up really badly. I brushed it off as I thought it was me drinking coffee after drinking theraflu that caused it. The second pack I took was okay until getting close to my placebo week, I would get nauseous. The first day of my placebo week on the second pack, I felt so nauseous going out and I threw up three days later, but only a bit. Starting my third pack, I was nauseous the first two weeks and then the last day of my active pill, I threw up all my food. I always take my pills at 11pm and I never forgot about them. I feel like these pills are killing me since I’m afraid of throwing up and being nauseous. I would get nauseous at work or out, which is never a problem before starting birth control. I know nausea is a symptom but it always happens starting the new pack and getting close to the placebo week. 

I know there are ways to skip the nausea but it so weird because it was good when I started the first pack but then get worse as I take the new packs?? Right now I’m on my placebo week and wanted to know if it would be easy to call my doctor and change the prescription before I have to take my new pack. I’m don’t want to stop taking birth medication but I hate the nausea being with me all the time. Sorry for the long post I just can’t stand it. ",1,1767341303.0,birthcontrol,1,1.0,False

In the tenth year of our marriage, my former best friend posted a photo. 

In the picture, she was holding her daughter, and my husband was holding my son. 

The four of them were nestled close together, looking intimate. 

The caption read: “Who says I can’t have both a son and a daughter?” 

I commented underneath: “A match made in heaven.” 

A second later, the post vanished. 

The next day, my husband stormed home. “Sophie is finally starting to feel a little better,” he snapped. “Why did you have to go and provoke her?” 

My son actually shoved me, shouting, “It’s all your fault! You made Tina cry!” 

I pulled out the divorce papers and slammed them onto the table. 

“You’re right. It is my fault,” I said coldly. “So I’m leaving. Now you can go be a happy family of four.” 

I had printed the divorce papers just half an hour ago. 

Before that, I had sat rigid on the living room sofa all night. 

The dozen or so dishes I had carefully prepared remained untouched on the dining table. 

The Ultraman–themed cake had long since melted beyond recognition. 

Yesterday was my son Andy Miller’s birthday. 

My husband, Ethan Miller, had specifically instructed me to prepare everything at home, promising he would bring Andy back to celebrate. 

I waited and waited, only to see Sophie’s social media post showing their family of four. 

How utterly ridiculous.

Ethan hadn’t expected the divorce. He frowned, his face clouded with annoyance, and tore the papers in half. 

“Leah Jones, what drama are you pulling now?” he sneered. 

“All I did was take our son to see Sophie and her daughter. I forgot to tell you, that’s all.” 

As he spoke, his gaze drifted to the unused feast on the table. A flicker of undeniable guilt crossed his eyes. 

He softened his tone, adopting the familiar appeasement strategy. 

“Alright, I was wrong not to contact you last night. I’ll be more careful in the future. I’ll clean up this mess. You go get some sleep. I’ll take you and Andy out for lunch.” 

That was his classic routine: a slap followed by a piece of candy. 

He knew he had overstepped, but he would never offer a true apology, only a small gesture to save face. 

If I didn’t take the olive branch, he would employ the silent treatment until I inevitably cracked. 

In the past, I had always given in first. 

But this time, I simply pulled out another copy of the divorce papers and slammed it on the coffee table: “I printed dozens of copies. Tear up every last one if you like.” 

Ethan was so furious he smashed a ceramic bowl against the wall. 

He glared at me impatiently. 

“Let’s be honest, you’re just jealous that Andy prefers Sophie, aren’t you? 

“Leah, don’t you forget, you’re the one who owes her! Andy and I taking care of her and her daughter is just us atoning for your sin!” 

Atoning? 

But what sin have I committed? 

Sophie and I were once best friends. During the summer break of our junior year in college, she asked me to hang out. 

That evening, when it was time to go home, I wanted to take the main road, but she insisted on taking a shortcut, saying a friend was waiting for her at the intersection.

Hi! It's nice to meet you. I am a 29 year old cisgender asexual/omniromantic female who is looking to meet anyone who considers themselves to be male. My hobbies include watching cooking , baking, knitting, sewing, reading, anime, reading manga, reading comic books, reading manhwa, watching cartoons, reading webtoons etc. Those are not all my hobbies you'll have to message me to find out more. I would like to get married eventually. I consider myself to be sex repulsed and would prefer a partner who is the same. I am looking for someone kind, caring, accepting, honest, loyal, respectful, someone who makes me feel safe. I want someone accepting because I have some disabilities. They are autism, ADHD, anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, and schizoaffective disorder. I also have a genetic defect that makes me extremely sensitive to certain things such as caffeine, so no coffee dates. Being accepting of me and my disabilities is a requirement. As for my appearance I am 5'6, 166 pounds (so slightly overweight), dark brown curly hair that is somewhat long, dark brown eyes, and olive skin tone. I am not religious and would prefer someone who is also that way. Also appearance is way too important for me. I am not a fan of physical touch and would prefer someone who is the same. I am from New York and would prefer someone from the USA. However I am also open to long distance. Anyway I look forward to hearing from you soon! Also you must like mushrooms, beets, and molasses. All 3 of them not just 2. Also I want to have children this is a requirement. Also please make an effort when messaging me. By effort I I mean at least 1 sentence, not 1 word. Physical attraction is much more important to me than personality. Also I am currently living in a group home for now due to being disabled. If you can’t handle those things don’t message me. Also please don’t expect me to work from home. I much prefer working at a workplace rather than staying at home all day.",1,1767341232.0,r4rAsexual,0,1.0,False
1q1sznz,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductNew/comments/1q1sznz/smart_plugs_vs_smart_switches_whats_the_difference/,Smart plugs vs smart switches: what's the difference?,"Smart plugs and smart switches might seem similar, but they work in completely different ways. Understanding the difference can save you money and help you pick the right option for your home automation needs.

## What Are Smart Plugs?

Smart plugs are small devices that plug directly into your regular wall outlets. You then plug your appliances or devices into the smart plug. They turn any regular device into a ""smart"" one that you can control remotely through your phone or voice commands.

Smart plugs work best with lamps, coffee makers, fans, space heaters, and other portable devices. You can set schedules, turn things on and off remotely, and even monitor energy usage with some models.

## What Are Smart Switches?

Smart switches replace your existing wall switches completely. You need to remove the old switch and wire in the new smart switch. This usually requires some electrical work and might need a professional installer.

Smart switches control hardwired fixtures like ceiling lights, bathroom fans, or garbage disposals. Once installed, they give you the same remote control features as smart plugs but for permanent fixtures.

## Key Differences You Should Know

**Installation:** Smart plugs are plug-and-play simple. Smart switches require electrical work and sometimes a neutral wire that older homes might not have.

**Cost:** Smart plugs typically cost $10-25 each. Smart switches range from $15-50 plus potential installation costs.

**Flexibility:** You can move smart plugs between outlets and take them with you when you move. Smart switches stay with the house.

**Power Control:** Smart switches can handle higher electrical loads and work with dimmer functions. Smart plugs have power limits based on the outlet.

## Which Should You Choose?

For renters or people wanting quick smart home upgrades, smart plugs are usually the better choice. They don't require permanent changes and work immediately.

If you own your home and want to control built-in lighting or ceiling fans, smart switches make more sense. They provide a cleaner look and don't take up outlet space.

Many people use both types in different areas. You might install smart switches for main lighting and use [smart plugs](https://athomewave.com/smart-plugs) for table lamps and small appliances.

## Getting Started

Start small with a few devices to see what works for your lifestyle. Smart home automation works best when you add pieces gradually rather than trying to automate everything at once.

Consider your home's wiring, your technical comfort level, and whether you rent or own before making decisions. The right mix of [smart plugs and switches](https://athomewave.com/smart-plugs) can make your daily routines more convenient without breaking the budget.

Both options integrate well with popular voice assistants and smartphone apps, so you can control your devices from anywhere in your home or even when you're away.",1,1767341179.0,ProductNew,0,1.0,False

hey everyone, figured i'd share some parking tips for the vip school of music event at music box on sunday, 01/04. parking in little italy is honestly a total headache even on a sunday afternoon with all the brunch and lunch traffic, so planning ahead is key to not missing the 3:00 pm start time.  
  
first thing i gotta tell you about is Prked. i've found this to be the absolute easiest way to park for any music box event. it's an app where people who live right next to the venue will rent out their private driveways or garages just for the day. it's usually way cheaper than the public lots and you get a guaranteed, prepaid spot just a super short walk away, like a minute or two from the door. using Prked lets you completely skip all the chaos of circling the blocks for street parking.  
  
if you don't use Prked, you're in luck because the event is on a sunday. this is the main pro tip for music box: street parking in the little italy area is free all day sunday. you don't have to worry about meters or the 6:00 pm free cutoff time. however, because it's free and everyone knows it, those spots will be taken up super fast. if you really want one of the free spots, you need to get there \*early\*, honestly aim for like 2:00 pm or 2:15 pm at the latest, and be patient cruising india street and the side streets like kettner or the perpendicular ones. even though it's free, you still have to check all signs carefully for tow-away zones and residential permit-only spots, which are definitely enforced.  
  
if the free spots are all gone or you don't want the hassle, there are a ton of paid parking lots and garages around, literally seven within a block or two. the closest lots are right there on india street (like the 1304 india st. lot) and on kettner boulevard (the ryan lot at 1329 kettner blvd). expect to pay anywhere from $10 to $20 for the afternoon.  
  
for a slightly cheaper, insider option, try the larger downtown parking structures which are a short walk (5-10 minutes) but can save you cash. the one america plaza garage is one of the cheapest options and is only about a 4-minute walk away. you can also use apps like spothero or parkwhiz to reserve a space in one of the paid lots or structures in advance, which is great for peace of mind, just a little more expensive than showing up and paying at the gate.  
  
bottom line: plan to arrive early no matter what you choose so you're not rushing and can grab a coffee or a bite before the event. hope this helps and have a great time!",1,1767341121.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

But my night was only beginning.

The dash radio didn't just crackle to life - it sputtered in jumbled, inaudible pieces. I assumed the worn-down piece of shit was broken as I flicked away my butt and slogged back to the door, but I barely had time to sit down when a man's voice slipped through the garbled static.

""*10-33, all units! \[static\] 10-33, all units, please, I'm-*"" Something was wrong with his voice. Each burst of static carried a different version of the same man; layered, varied tones out of sync.

""*Swallow Coast is \[static\] Swallow Coast is gone--Swallow Coast is... wrong \[static\]* *PLEASE, MY*\-""

The voices then stumbled together into a single, dead tone and repeated the same phrase over and over.

""*help us*""

Then it broke apart again, overlapping into a shattered mess of protocol codes, before cutting off to a null silence. My hand was halfway to the volume knob, trembling; I'd heard panicked officers be shot at before, fighting to speak, but never had I heard *anything* like that.

A glitch? A ghost? A dream? My mind raced down every avenue, but a single ugly detail kept pecking at my brain.

'Swallow Coast'

Training kicked in.

""Dispatch, 3-Adam-12,"" I said, my voice sounding far steadier than I felt. ""Copy an unknown 10-33 that just came over my in-car. Unidentified officer, no call sign, giving location as 'Swallow Coast.'""

I stared out at the empty road.

""Be advised,"" I added, forcing the words out, ""I don't show a 'Swallow Coast' on any local grids. Can you run a trace on the transmission?""

I released the button, and the radio went back to dead air.

""3-Adam-12, Dispatch here."" Her voice was calm, but there was a hesitance to it. ""We've got a hit.""

""Go ahead, Dispatch.""

""Signal's bouncing off the east repeater, origin somewhere off County Road 17, past marker 22."" Papers rustled faintly on her end. ""Be advised that stretch is... it just *ends* out there.""

I squinted through the windshield, trying to picture it.

I'd patrolled that road a hundred times.

""Dispatch, confirm. You're telling me an emergency call came from the middle of nowhere?""

""Affirmative. How do you want to proceed?""

I glanced at the black stretch of highway disappearing into the trees, and took a deep breath.

""Dispatch, show me en route.""

I flipped on my lights and pulled back onto the tar, my headlights carving a narrow tunnel through the ensemble of timber. The silence became a pressure; the radio a faint, constant open breath as I ran the familiar stretch.

""Dispatch, 3-Adam-12,"" I said, ""Confirm last known origin was off 17, past marker 22.""

""Affirmative. You should be the only thing moving out there.""

The terrain began to climb; the highway curled along the flank of a mountain in long, sweeping turns where only a guardrail stood between me and a steep drop. When the trees broke, I caught glimpses of it - the pale smear of the heaving Pacific.

By 21, the air had turned damp and cold, seeping in through the vents. My GPS started to lag - a little car sliding over green nothing. I frowned, tapping the casing with a knuckle, when the weather-beaten marker 22 lurched out of the shadows.

I parked beside it.

Fifty yards past the marker, veering off the road and into the wild on a narrowing, overgrown trail, the path, as described, stopped.

A hard, abrupt gravel edge.

""Dispatch, be advised. I've arrived at origin-""

The speaker exploded into unrelenting noise.

Not static, not feedback - voices; a hundred of them at once, slamming into my ears. Snatches of jingles, movie lines, sitcom laughs, news anchors, late-night preachers, kids shouting over commercials, pop songs, intimate phone calls; every recorded sound I'd ever heard stacked on top of each other, out of tune.

Out of time.

""-*copy that, over and out--he's looking at you, kid--baby, don't hurt me, don't--breaking news tonight as officials--wake up, she's here*.""

""Dispatch?!"" I snapped, one hand clamped on the mic, the other white-knuckled around the wheel. ""Dispatch, I'm experiencing a malfunction! Do you copy?!""

""*-late night deals you won't believe--please, if anyone is there--this is not a test, this is an emergency broadcast*\-""

Something thudded softly under my foot.

The brake pedal sank half an inch.

I hadn't moved my leg.

""No...""

I stomped down, hard. The pedal met resistance - then, bit by bit, pushed back against me.

The gear lever clicked.

PARK - REVERSE - DRIVE

""Dispatch, I-""

""-*we now return to your feature presentation*\-""

The cruiser began to roll. Slow at first, just a whisper over the gravel as I slammed my foot on the brakes, and it shrugged me off.

The wheel didn't budge either as the car aligned with the void ahead.

I twisted the key out!

Nothing!

A canned studio audience roared out from the radio, drowning out a weatherman promising clear skies and a man's ragged voice yelling, ""*They cut the road, they CUT THE ROAD-*""

I grabbed for the seatbelt, and the latch clicked, but the strap wouldn't release - remaining locked across my chest.

I hit the door handle, but it bounced against the damn frame.

""Come on!"" I spat, slamming my shoulder into it. Fruitless.

The car rolled on, patient and unbothered by my efforts.

A hoarse male voice cut through the layers.

""*Please-if anyone-I've got a daughter in*\-""

Static chewed him up and vomited him back out as a game show buzzer.

""-*wrong answer, but thanks for playing*\-""

""Stop,"" I murmured, my nerves becoming shot.

Far ahead, at the very end of the light, something began to take shape. It was a dense patch of shimmering thin white; a near-transparent wall where empty air should've been.

Fog, I told myself. Except fog didn't sit flat.

Forty yards.

The wall resolved into a smooth sheet of glitching white-and-black, texture-less, depthless static. And beyond it - for just an instant - I thought I saw the orange smear of streetlights.

""-*you are now entering--the following film contains--they said the sky was wrong--don't touch that dial, you're gonna get us all*\-"" The radio begged, pleaded, sold me detergent, laughed at its own jokes, as the distance between bumper and curtain shrank.

Thirty yards.

Twenty.

""Stop the fucking car!"" I yelled, losing all professionalism as I hammered the windows and wheel, the horn blaring weakly amidst the radio's storm.

""-*ma'am, you need to remain calm*\-""

""SHUT THE FUCK UP!""

The glitching veil loomed in, filling the windshield with nothing I had a word for. I clawed at the seatbelt, desperate - jump out, climb out, do something, anything, but go through whatever that was, yet my fate was inevitable.

So I did all I had left.

I squeezed my eyes shut and braced.

And the car rolled in.

All sense of direction vanished; the seat fell away under me, then jumped back up, and my body felt like it'd plummeted through an ice sheet beyond physics.

Every voice on the radio hit a single, piercing note.

Then silence - a quick, surgical cut into the noise.

My ears popped as the world slid back in, the car coming to a stop, and after I realised I was still breathing, I slowly forced my eyes open.

The dead-end road was gone. In its place was a wide, slick street glistening with rain; lined with buildings, flickering neon, and a diner with a crooked 'OPEN' sign. A distant pier lamp swung over black water, and, carving its way up a mountain path, was a brass-and-steel observatory gazing at the stars.

On one corner, a street sign hung from a rusted pole.

'Swallow Coast'

I finally got my hands to move and reached for the gear shift, expecting the same resistance. It moved willingly, but the engine was dead; as was my radio. I was, however, able to free myself from the seatbelt and sprang out of my powerless cruiser, feeling sick and cold on wobbling legs.

A pickup truck stalked behind a pale sedan, headlights still faint, like they were running on memory. A hatchback rested at an angle to the curb, its front tyre up on the sidewalk, attempting to flee. Closer, a cruiser from a foreign department nosed into the intersection - its pattern like mine, but the crest on the door was smudged, like vandalised paint.

They were empty. Forgotten.

""Dispatch? Are you there?""

...

I walked towards a military Humvee, hunched closer to the diner, olive metal dulled by grime. A faded stencil on the door spelt 'U.S Army', but the unit markings beneath were the same as the cruiser. The passenger door hung open.

I peered in.

No gear, no duffels, no guns; just seats, and the impression that its occupants simply evaporated. The sedan had a purse on the driver's seat, its contents scattered: a wallet, receipts, a cracked phone frozen on a family photo, the seatbelt slack and twisted, the engine cold.

I turned back the way I'd come, towards where the road should've cut.

Instead, the street sloped gently upward until it met a structure that did not belong here. At first, I mistook it for a cell tower, but it was a makeshift lattice of metal and cables - antennas speared out; dish arrays, spiralled coils, panels that hummed faintly with colour. Wires as thick as my arm ran down into a fenced-off outpost bristling with control boxes and blinking lights.

I had to crane my neck to see the beacon at the peak - a red light flashing randomly.

Behind the tower, barely, hung the 'thing' I'd driven through.

From this side, the veil was much thinner. Instead of a static wall, it was more like distorted glass - a wavering, curving slice of sky that didn't fit.

More vehicles sat at the base, facing the shimmer; unquestionably military, rusting and rotten, all pointed at the same impossible curtain.

The tower then hummed as if waking up, and my radio sparked to life - coughing out a single, wailing tone that stung my ears and rattled my teeth.

I didn't notice it immediately, only catching the structure in the corner of my eye as my head pounded, but up in the mountain, the observatory *shivered*.

From the street, it looked textbook - a crown perched atop the rocks with domes and spires winking like old coins, highlighted by either its own gleaming light or what they caught from the stars.

Yet under the signal's pressure, the whole building shook.

Then the first **rip** happened.

The observatory spasmed and snapped, as if a cursor were trying to drag it across a screen; it remained in place, defiantly, but it became distorted, as if shifted through eras. For a blink, the glass was cracked and dark, the brass tarnished, and entire sections hung loose, like something blew it up from inside.

My radio climbed another notch, drilling through my jaw and violating my skull.

The observatory jerked again - now under construction.

Floodlights bleached the mountain path, support beams and half-built walls cast shadows across the rocks; domes became webs of hollow steel, and cranes hung over the whole scene, jittering and flickering as the sky seized from night to day to night again. I could almost hear construction noises - shouted instructions, the clatter of tools, the whistling of men.

I fell to my hands and knees, a trickle of blood oozing from my nose.

Everything was vibrating.

The observatory stuttered once more. It burned.

Orange triumphed inside the central dome; flames beat metal, smoke rolled up in a thick column, but didn't behave right - freezing, lagging. Something within it pulsed white-hot, brighter than any heat I'd ever seen, as my vision blurred, and the road under me melted, then hardened, becoming dirt and snow and magma. I tasted metal in the deepest recesses of my throat as my radio reached a pitch I didn't think was possible.

The observatory tore a final time, but not just the building.

The sky above split open.

A hairline crack at first - a tiny, jagged, thin line - that widened in wild jumps, tearing and stopping, until a gaping wound hung over the mountain.

A scar of colourless deep, where stars were packed far too close together - undiscovered by any astronomer.

They didn't twinkle like jewels. They blinked like eyes.

A pungent waft of burnt electricity rolled down the mountain and filled the street, as my radio became another chorus of relentless sound.

""-*entrance. logged*\--*all units, hold the line, do not approach--test the alert, damn it--alpha, requesting permission to--swiper no swiping--praise be, brothers and sisters--pay separate shipping and handling--if you or a loved one has been diagnosed with cancer--observatory team, do you copy--what the FUCK IS THAT THING--top 10 cartoon themes, number 3 will--this message will repeat--he's still in there--side effects may include dizziness, nausea, loss of self, existential dread--what have you done, boy*\-*-we are here LIVE from Swallow Coast where it seems a-*""

The radio cut out, damning me into another empty silence as the ripping of space stopped, my vision returned through harsh blinks, and the observatory clicked back to normalcy. I scrubbed trembling hands over my nose and lips, wiping away blood, and considered curling into a ball right there on the road among hollow cars, until the next signal came and fried my head to putty.

What in God's name had I done to deserve this?

""*Ellie...*""

I didn't believe I'd heard them at first, my ears and head still clearing the pain, but as my composure slowly crawled back, I realised someone was trying to talk to me over the radio.

""*Ellie--you there?*""

Not a gurgle of madness, but a sane, deliberate attempt at communication; still not just a lone voice, but several, concerned dialects - never repeating - of varying ages and tones, taking turns in between statics.

""-*click receiver \[static\] alive--just breathe, girl \[static\] not alone-*""

I jabbed at my radio.

Click.

""-*copy, she hears \[static\] the diner \[static\] equipment--trust-*""

A new voice slid in between them, low and bitter.

""-***you're not going anywhere***\-""

""-*cut them out! \[static\] ignore--scared--not one of us-*""

I forced my thumb down, my voice raw and scratched.

""Who are you? What the fuck is this place?""

""-*pocket \[static\] failed test--caught signal-*"" A child's voice flickered in. ""-*they turned it on, and it never turned off-*"" Then a soft old man. ""*-observatory is unstable*\-"" Then a calm, hurried woman. ""-*held it as long \[static\] can't get up--you can-*""

""What?! Me?! Why, what did I-""

There was a beat of overlapping sharp breaths, pleas and begs; then a gentle, older woman.

""*-sorry, sweetheart \[static\] your car \[static\] radio--a line in \[static\] can't lose-""*

\*""-\****chose you*** *\[static\]* ***lab rat***\-""

A squeal of feedback, then the calm woman again.

""-*reaches further \[static\] every breach \[static\] spreading--understand?*""

Finally, a man.

""-*doctor \[static\] seen it--outside \[static\] right place, right time \[static\] guide you--move, now \[static\] shut it \[static\] free us-*""

The channel fluttered, then steadied into a song of tangled encouragement, praise, and laughs and cries, and faint, drowned-out screams.

""Okay,"" I said, more to myself, seeing no other choice. ""Tell me what to do.""

\-

The closer I got to the diner, the more the streets had been terraformed into a military foothold.

Another Humvee crouched half a block down, choking the roads; cracks inched across its windshield, then retreated, like the glass was deciding whether or not to shatter. Farther along, a gloomy, armoured truck sat with its back doors open. Inside was empty, save for a single dangling headset swinging in still air.

A few steps from the truck, they'd planted a miniature radio tower. It was no taller than me - just a braced mast bolted straight into the earth. At its base, a metal shoebox hummed faintly, LEDs frozen mid-blink.

""*-repeater-*"" a measured, academic voice said over my radio. ""*-node--jam the \[static\] cage-*""

""Didn't work?"" I asked.

""*-not for long-*"" a regretful woman answered.

Beyond it were two tripod rigs, their heads pointed towards the street.

Except the mounts weren't guns.

The closest carried a cluster of speakers - flat, hexagonal panels arranged in a honeycomb, each one mottled with a mesh of tiny holes, ringed with melted plastic. The path directly in front of the speaker array was scorched in a perfect cone, not by heat, but by... absence. There was no grit, no oil stains, just a smooth, blasted-down layer of reality.

The other tripod mounted a lamp. A fat cylinder with cooling fins and nested lenses, tagged with a warning label - UV ONLY. The beam was off, but a faint violet tint clung to the terrain it aimed at.

""*-light--burns \[static\] sound--stuns-*""

""*-****calibre*** *\[static\]* ***severs*** ***the****-*""

The unwelcome voices were diluted out again.

""Who are they?"" I asked, inspecting the tripods. ""The ones you keep shutting up?""

""*-fractured \[static\] dangerous--uncooperative-*""

A low sandbag wall braced the mouth of a nearby alley. Riot shields leaned carelessly along it, their viewports spangled with neat, clustered cracks.

From here, the alley tightened and dead-ended against a brick wall painted with peeling graffiti, but the air above the sandbags bent wrong, like I was looking through a fisheye. I took one cautious step closer and saw, for only an instant, the suggestion of another street cutting across the wall: cars nose-to-ass, a bus shelter, the swarming of civilians, a billboard in a language I couldn't understand.

A second layer of another town, out of alignment.

Then I blinked, and the alley ended with a wall again.

""*-don't go in there-*""

""Yeah, no shit.""

The radio chuckled - a quick, nervous ripple of different laughs.

Ahead, the diner waited.

The windows stuttered worse than the Humvee - intact, webbed, blown out - and the OPEN sign rolled through the wrong sequence - O P N E - before becoming abstract symbols my eyes slid off. It hurt to look at. The foundation was stitched with bullet holes; casings littered the ground - little brass maps charting where soldiers had stood and fired, and fired again, at something that left no trace.

""What were they shooting at?""

My question was met with silence.

Then, the bitter voice - softer now.

""***Us*** *\[static\]* ***not enough***\*-\*""

My hand brushed over my sidearm.

""*-inside, Ellie \[static\] tools-*"" the kind woman urged, ""-*survival*\-""

The bell above the door rang three different times as the smell hit me.

Decay - old, dried out, folded under dust and chemicals, and burnt coffee and fried grease soaked so deeply into the walls. The stuttering was horrid: seats went from cracked red vinyl to bare springs and torn yellow form, then back again; menus flickered in and out of existence, and a jukebox danced between models. Tables had been shoved around a central aisle, their legs braced. Cots crowded the floor - army-issue frames sagging under mattresses, sheets twisted and stained, and a portable generator cowered near the counter, its casing open; wires spilt out like guts, threading through ammo crates and jerry-rigged equipment.

I saw him then.

He sat in the last booth, facing the door. For a moment, I thought he was asleep - chin tucked, shoulders hunched, but the details became apparent.

The soldier was almost a skeleton.

Brittle fatigue clung to him; his uniform stiffened by dust. What skin I could see was like parchment, pulled tight over bone in sunken hollows; his dog tag had fused with his collarbone, the metal nesting in a little crater where his flesh had given up, and his jaw hung loose, teeth bared... a man exhausted from screaming.

His hand still cupped the air near his temple, fingers frozen around a missing pistol, a dark crater in the booth's backrest staining where the bullet had gone - a grainy, pixelated splatter.

My stomach knotted.

Two objects in front of him offered themselves to me.

The first was a flashlight, stubby and industrial with a wide, dark lens ringed with faded warning tape. The other was a compact speaker; one side a grid of tiny holes, the opposite a switch.

A worn voice breathed out on my shoulder.

""-*good man--kind--brave-*""

I cleared my throat. ""Yet he died alone.""

""-*better that than \[static\] lost in--signals-*""

I reached out for the pocket speaker.

""-*careful \[static\] tuned-*"" the academic voice muttered.

""For what?""

They all spoke at once, a tangle of the same answer.

""-*to be louder than them*\-""

I placed both tools in my belt.

Then the soldier's skull tilted, vertebrae creaking, and my heart lurched; hand flying to my sidearm, but it was only my disturbance of the table that moved him. I breathed a sigh of relief and steadied my pulse... when *his* radio came alive, a clunky handset clipped to his waist.

It did not speak; it hissed.

""-***LEAVE IT ON*** *\[static\]* ***GO HOME, GIRL***\*--**YOU'LL KILL US**\-\*""

My own radio crackled in sympathy, and my company interjected, but they were suddenly faint.

""-*Ellie \[static\] focus--don't*\-""

The soldier's radio overpowered them, its volume spiking.

""-***NOT*** *\[static\]* ***THE FIRST PIG*** *\[static\]* ***THEY LIE***\*--**THEY SENT ALL**\-""\* a sobbing child's voice warped through ""-***WE HURT*** *\[static\]* ***DON'T TURN US OFF***\*-""\*

Both radios screamed - a thousand voices mashed together.

""*-ELLIE, GET OUT OF--FEEDBACK--COMING*\--***found you***\--\*try--\*\*\*\*RAM IT, BURN IT--\*\*\**speaker--****kill your radio****--****KILL YOURSELF****--don't touch*\--*not whole anymore--angry--****STILL HERE****--****STILL FEEL****-""*

It was a thrash of sound - threats, pleas, curses, prayers, all ground together - that ached my head. I didn't hesitate. I reached for the portable speaker, flipped the switch, and my world tunnelled as it squealed a deafening wail. The generator hiccupped, the overhead lights burned and burst, the jukebox lit up and spun through songs too fast, and the dead soldier's radio cut off as his body slumped forward.

Then there was only silence as I found myself alone in a dark diner, the speaker hot against my waist.

My own radio crackled twice, confused.

""*-Ellie?!*""

Then it too failed.

And for the first time, Swallow Coast was truly quiet.

The diner's own sounds quickly crept out like insects: the creaks of booths adjusting to no weight, a slow, patient drip from somewhere in the kitchen, the soft, intermittent hum of the neon sign outside. Breath left my lungs in slippery, shaky exhales, as I fidgeted with my radio - not willing to accept this loneliness as permanent.

*Ding*.

The bell above the front door chimed.

Once. Perfectly.

*Ding.*

Again.

The door didn't move, but the sound was thicker this time - as if underwater. The air near the entrance wobbled, just a fraction, as I drew my gun and the flashlight.

*Ding.*

The doorframe trembled in place, smearing sideways in short, nauseating skips, then bulged and rippled and flattened, and *something* pressed through it.

Familiar broken nonsense reached me first.

""*-don't touch that dial, we'll be right with you \[flatline\] you're about to start \[phone dial\] one woman, one night, lost her friends \[Windows Startup\] coming up: a local officer goes \[sirens\]* ***skinned and flayed***\*-\*""

The idea of a man began to materialise, cobbled together from a disjointed static mass of flickering grey fuzz; his chest strobed between suits, hoodies, bare skin, hospital gowns, and his face was layers upon layers over a vertical slack - an old man's profile, a child's wide eyes, a woman's gaping mouth mid-scream, a teenager chewing gum. They swam through one another, never syncing, each countless expression trying to dominate the other; far too many crammed into the same outline.

Every time he moved, pieces of him lagged behind at different frame-rates or spasmed into mundane tasks, as a radio snow flaked off his edges, popping and disintegrating into nothing. He stepped into the diner (if you could call it that), tearing out of the door, the sounds of his feet were complex, dry keyboard clicks dubbed over with car doors, gunshots, soda cans, and a microphone. The air bent around him, violating the space into an elongated, glitching funhouse.

Then he looked at me, and all the mouths in his head smiled.

""-*anomaly. found-*""

On intuition, my thumb pressed the taped switch on the flashlight, and a solid, bruise-dark violet bar erupted and hit the 'man' square in the chest. The result was instant. Touched by the light, the static went from grey to a blistering, overexposed white and orange - then burned brighter than the sun. Pieces of mismatched people peeled back like melting film, bubbling out of existence, as a dozen borrowed eyes flared and scowled.

A film-trailer voice gulped mid-sentence, dropping a few octaves, and a jingle stretched into a thin, digital scream as the air around it pulsed back several inches toward normal. The creature staggered, raising its jittery, convulsive arms to shield itself; the mosaic of broadcast it used as skin blackened where the beam stayed, edges crisping and curling, as it *roared* \- a remix of half-sponsored messages and corrupted sound bites scratching in my ears.

It tried to advance, lugging a step towards me, so I fired.

The bullet hit where the UV light had already cooked its form, right in a raw patch of boiling static, but instead of a clean entry wound, reality tore as its flesh blew open in a geyser of white noise. I saw inside it: frames of other places, hallways, headlights, an operating table, someone's bedroom - swirling past the hole in a blur. The bullet cut through them all, dragging a comet-tail of glitch with it, as the creature convulsed. Every piece of it slipped further out of sync; faces morphed into a screaming collage, several arms twitched in delayed directions, its outline ballooned, as a bomb of sound erupted from it - hurling me off my feet and into a table.

Its body blew outward like a grenade. Static detonated into a jagged sphere, shredding through tile and chrome and glass, as half the diner's wall ceased to be - ripped out of space.

Then it fled onto the street - a teleporting, slithering mass of pained static - before vanishing into the night, leaving a brief, untextured trail of vertigo-inducing grey in its wake.

The OPEN sign outside flashed a new word in between blinks, letters stuttering into place where they didn't belong.

'LIVE'

I stumbled outside, head and heart pounding, and leaned on a car that wasn't quite there.

Six months on the force, I had my first domestic.

Second floor of a shitty apartment, end of the hall, number already flagged for 'prior incidents'. Neighbours had reported shouting and a crying kid, so Dispatch tossed me over. A young woman met me at the door, red-eyed with a polite smile that didn't match her shaking hands.

'He' hovered in the kitchen.

No damage, nothing broken, no visible injuries, no kid; just a raised voice and overreacting neighbours.

My gut whispered that it wasn't nothing - the way she glanced at him before every answer. But policy pays no mind to 'gut feelings'. I took their statements, handed over a pamphlet, told her she could call us anytime, and I went home to a warm bed.

But then I went back.

Again.

And again.

*And again*.

Different days, same apartment, same rushed apology; same look in her eyes, same break in her voice. Yet every time, *every time*, things looked just calm enough to walk away from.

The last callout was quiet. No shouts, no cries; the neighbours said the silence concerned them more. The TV was still on when I entered.

She was on the couch, eyes raw, long gone from this world.

While He hung in the bedroom with blood on his hands.

I did everything by the book on that one. Got told it wasn't my fault, but I knew better. I'd walked away from that mangy little home plenty of times when my instincts told me not to. So when a radio asked for help from nowhere, from a place that didn't exist, I knew my mind would've been made up.

Atonement, maybe.

I think that's why I saw her little face amidst a gunshot wound of white noise and broken static. Not angry or sad, merely... watching. Judging.

Wondering if I'd run away again.

The second **rip** came without mercy.

The observatory didn't only shake this time - it imploded. Invisible, folding billows sped down the mountain like shockwaves, crashing through the forest and impacting the street, splintering everything they touched, breaking structures apart and rebuilding them in the span of thoughts. I watched people spawn in and out in different styles, from various decades; kids on bikes, soldiers in masks, tourists with cameras, walking through each other, through me, through anything that was or wasn't there.

Then I saw myself.

A multitude of Ellies, scattered through the maddening mess, with torn uniforms and guns drawn or not even a cop at all, running for their lives, praying on their knees, walking their dogs, staring up at the sky, and the waves kept coming; time and space buckled, reformed, then buckled again, as my insides began to crawl out of my body.

I thought this would be my end, lost in a paradoxical typhoon - reduced to an unexplainable phenomenon - but then, somewhere inside the chaos, the worst of it calmed, and my radio spat out a ragged word.

""-*climb*\-""

My ghosts had returned; a familiar, comforting patchwork of timid, exhausted voices.

""-*mountain path \[static\] with you--brace \[static\] up*\-""

\-

Astronauts describe walking on the moon as a mix of 'magnificent desolation', with stark beauty and intense light, but also a sense of indescribable wonder and adventure - a trampoline bounce in low gravity, as Earth hangs in a jet-black, starless sky.

I wondered how such trained, privileged adventurers would describe wading through Hell, as my first step onto the gravel-caked, rotting wood landed seconds before I did, the ground buffering under my weight. The path ascended fast, shouldering into the trees; a nervy strip of nature that couldn't settle, while the leaking observatory hung above it like a bad omen.

Out here, the equipment was different.

Instead of jammers and tripods, the hardware along the path had been built as a fence. Short pylons stood in rows on either side of the trail, no higher than my hip, drilled straight into the roots. Between them, lines of invisible pressure danced in the air, catching the moonlight in wrong ways.

UV lamps the size of flares were cradled in the metal, their light pointed not at the town, but out into the trees; burning clean wedges of bleached bark. Cinderblock speakers squatted between the lamps, their faces singing in frozen sound.

There was a thick grain of slow-moving static just beyond the barrier. Shapes heaved just past the reach of the light, packed shoulder-to-shoulder along the mountainside: loose silhouettes, glitching outlines, people and not-people slow as sleep. Blank faces drifted in and out of the gloom - dozens, maybe hundreds.

Every few meters, a pylon pulsed weakly, and the nearest shape flinched, restrained under some pressure I couldn't see or feel, but *hear*.

A containment of light and sound, wrapped around the path and beyond.

But it wasn't perfect.

At the very start of the trail, two pylons had been dragged just enough out of alignment - their cables snagged, their housings cracked. Between them, the air sagged, and the invisible pressure caved inward. Occasionally, a fleeting crack would appear, and a grey hand would slither out, flickering between nails, metal, and bone. It clawed at the gap, pushing through, when the nearest UV canister coughed out what strength it had and blistered the hand into white-hot confetti.

The crack would seal, temporarily.

I understood how one of them could've escaped.

My radio gave the softest click.

""*-walk quiet--trench line-*""

Soon, I stopped just short of the observatory, in a car park of grand, curated scientific study sprawled with white tents and MOCs - their terminals still running.

Up close, the building was disappointingly ordinary. It was never the problem.

Every instrument they had up here, every setup, their endless arsenal of gadgets, faced the mountain - hooked up with cables and sensors, like a giant patient in need of surgery.

What they monitored was not a shape, but a wound in geometry - an impossible prism of light moulded into the granite; blooming edges of colourless bursts, a radiant malfunction of stuttering angles, and vibrating in horrid, wiggling wretches, blasting out waves of energy that spilt into the town below.

""*-woken--vessel* *\[static\] you see \[static\] crashed--stuck*\-""

""How do I turn it-""

""-***we remember you***\-""

The others made no attempt to silence their fractured comrades, who then spoke with unrivalled clarity.

""*You shot them. Bold. Most get scared*.""

""What're-""

""*All of them. Every wave. Look*.""

My eyes glazed over the protruding vessel.

It shimmered, in perfect sync, with every word.

""*People do not belong in here. Release them*.""

A myriad of colours oozed from its hull as it tried to phase out of the rock. A bastion of obelisks amidst the ground, the first line of defence wired to the MOCs, matched its rainbow display in tandem.

""... how?""

""*One of the terminals. Shut it down. All of it. Please*.""

Before I could move, a gabble of noise stumbled up the path behind me, replacing the cadence of commercials and cartoons with clipped military channels.

""-*Alpha to F.O.B \[Beep\] field log corrupted, retrying \[Buzz\] do you have any idea what they're doing up \[static\]*\-""

My boots skidded as I bolted to the nearest terminal. I slapped keys and snapped a cursor through unreadable fields and thermals until a green menu stared back.

\> NODE: OBSERVATORY

\> STATUS: UNSTABLE

\> COMMAND: \_ \_ \_

""*End.*"" Said my radio.

""What?!""

""*Command. End*.""

I glanced over my shoulder at the rippling air and oncoming chatter as the thing took shape. It had changed uniforms, shifting through combat gear and lab coats, then blue hazmat suits and armour.

""-*hey! who's there?! \[static\] are we authorised for this \[static\] greatest breakthrough of our species, and you wanna get cold feet \[static\] subject: persistent-correction required*""

\> COMMAND: END

I nearly slammed it in.

And the world popped.

For a breath, there was no sound - only a pressure change. Then, every electronic in sight croaked dead at once. The speaker on my belt sparked and flung itself off, dissolving. My flashlight exploded, ripping through my flesh with jagged pieces and a violet burst, falling me to one knee with a yelp.

Then the mountain screamed.

The 'vessel' flared and ripped itself free, tearing the stone like it was wet paper. Granite peeled and crumbled, scaffolding and cables snapped, trucks flipped several feet into the air and phased through the ground. The prism wrenched itself out in a spray of dust and broken light, took a single, staggered look at its reeling saviour, and then, in a single jump... it was gone, a streak vanishing straight into the sky.

From the veil I had driven through, a quake detonated - a rupture rolling in on itself like a sheet, becoming a towering wall of static-white, reaching the clouds, that erased everything it touched as it volleyed towards us.

*Us*.

The pain in my leg had distracted me enough to not realise the static man was still here, still advancing.

""-*final state pending \[static\] final state pending \[static\] final*\-""

I drew my pistol and emptied every bullet, but without the UV light, it was like shooting a fog. Round after round pinged through its body, absorbed by glimpses of rooms, of other skies, and it kept coming; now devoid of any features remotely human.

I reloaded with shaking, bloody hands and fired again until my gun clicked.

The encroaching white wall swallowed the base of the path, then the observatory, as the entity reached for me, its many hands smearing into my face as a glow washed over its shoulders... and I closed my eyes.

The wall took us in a single, enveloping surge.

Then there was nothing at all.

\-

""Ellie?""

I knew his voice; he sounded amused.

""You still with us, kid?""

I opened my eyes to find myself on a stretcher, a paramedic tending the bandages around my leg, and a wrinkled hand in front of me snapping his fingers.

""Helloooo? Earth to Ellie?""

I was still at the observatory; military equipment had been replaced with a police presence and some suspicious vans, their open doors revealing cargoes of narcotics. Punks were slammed onto the hoods of cruisers, cuffed, and shoved into back seats.

An older, grizzled cop looked down at me, one arm in a sling.

""I... what?"" I stammered out.

""Did she hit her head?"" He asked the paramedic, and I knew then where I'd heard him before -  an officer who radioed a 10-33.

""She lost a bit of blood, that's all. Give her a minute.""

Behind them, a news crew assembled. A redhead reporter chucked away her cigarette and rustled her hair as her cameraman counted her down.

""Are we ready? Cool-We are here LIVE from Swallow Coast where it seems a brave batch of officers have made history in one of the largest drug busts Oregon has ever known-""

I drowned her out, rubbing my temples.

Marcus was his name, who insisted on escorting me back to my car despite my demand to be alone. Every step, I felt sick. I expected the sky to tweak, or a shadow to lag behind me - *something* leftover.

Instead, Swallow Coast looked like any other town.

The diner wore a fresh coat of paint and boasted a health-inspected 'A' in the window. A teenager replaced a dead soldier in the end booth, wiping down tables, earbuds in; the only radio noise was a pop station whining about breakups and summer love.

If I tried hard enough, I could almost convince myself that I'd hallucinated the whole thing.

Blood loss from shrapnel?

Stress?

Almost.

Until a select few sounds hit my ears the wrong way, my newfound tubby friend paying no mind to my tiny flinches. Eventually, we reached my cruiser - still 'parked' at the edge of town, where a friendly mechanic fiddled inside the hood, finalising his work, overlooked by an old cell tower.

""How's she looking?!"" Marcus barked.

He looked at me. ""Ah, she'll drive, but your precinct needs to upgrade your wheels. This thing's a fucking relic.""

""I'll keep it in mind,"" I said, suddenly very eager to drive far, far away from this place.

But Marcus wouldn't allow that, oh no - not until he'd said goodbye. He watched me slide into my driver’s seat before planting himself in the doorway, leaning nonchalantly on the roof.

""You sure you're okay?""

""Yeah, fine.""

""If you say so, hero. And don't worry,"" he winked, ""I'm gonna be putting in a good word with your chief-oh, hold on-"" his hand flicked over my shoulder, ""-huh... your radio was off. Weird.""

""Ha, yeah... *weird*.""

""Well, drive safe. And if I ever need backup again, I'm asking for you personally."" He chuckled and made his leave with a hefty wave.

I waited until his shape was gone before shrivelling and collapsing into my seat, my hand snapping over my throbbing chest. Tears welled up fast and I sobbed and fitted like a toddler, until my radio spoke, and I almost shrieked.

""You're back on the system, 3-Adam-12! We thought we lost you! What happened?!""

I composed myself quickly, wiping my face.

""Uh... my car, um-... broke, Dispatch.""

""... broke?""

""That's right.""

""Okay... I'll make a note of that. Anything else to report?""

""No, Dispatch. Say, do you-""

""Hold on, 3-Adam-12-"" her attention was taken away ""-right, we've got a domestic the next town over, all local units are busy. Feeling up for it?""

I'd barely caught my own breath as I looked out at the sunrise.

It was unlike any I'd seen.

""I... yeah..."" I rallied myself. ""Show me en route.""",1,1767340351.0,TheMidnightArchives,0,1.0,False
1q1sr4c,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1q1sr4c/sever_the_static/,Sever The Static,"Crickets make peaceful company; a lulling ambience to soothe the quiet side road, where a girl can puff another smoke, wondering what lecture Chief's gonna bark come morning.

But my night was only beginning.

The dash radio didn't just crackle to life - it sputtered in jumbled, inaudible pieces. I assumed the worn-down piece of shit was broken as I flicked away my butt and slogged back to the door, but I barely had time to sit down when a man's voice slipped through the garbled static.

""*10-33, all units! \[static\] 10-33, all units, please, I'm-*"" Something was wrong with his voice. Each burst of static carried a different version of the same man; layered, varied tones out of sync.

""*Swallow Coast is \[static\] Swallow Coast is gone--Swallow Coast is... wrong \[static\]* *PLEASE, MY*\-""

The voices then stumbled together into a single, dead tone and repeated the same phrase over and over.

""*help us*""

Then it broke apart again, overlapping into a shattered mess of protocol codes, before cutting off to a null silence. My hand was halfway to the volume knob, trembling; I'd heard panicked officers be shot at before, fighting to speak, but never had I heard *anything* like that.

A glitch? A ghost? A dream? My mind raced down every avenue, but a single ugly detail kept pecking at my brain.

'Swallow Coast'

Training kicked in.

""Dispatch, 3-Adam-12,"" I said, my voice sounding far steadier than I felt. ""Copy an unknown 10-33 that just came over my in-car. Unidentified officer, no call sign, giving location as 'Swallow Coast.'""

I stared out at the empty road.

""Be advised,"" I added, forcing the words out, ""I don't show a 'Swallow Coast' on any local grids. Can you run a trace on the transmission?""

I released the button, and the radio went back to dead air.

""3-Adam-12, Dispatch here."" Her voice was calm, but there was a hesitance to it. ""We've got a hit.""

""Go ahead, Dispatch.""

""Signal's bouncing off the east repeater, origin somewhere off County Road 17, past marker 22."" Papers rustled faintly on her end. ""Be advised that stretch is... it just *ends* out there.""

I squinted through the windshield, trying to picture it.

I'd patrolled that road a hundred times.

""Dispatch, confirm. You're telling me an emergency call came from the middle of nowhere?""

""Affirmative. How do you want to proceed?""

I glanced at the black stretch of highway disappearing into the trees, and took a deep breath.

""Dispatch, show me en route.""

I flipped on my lights and pulled back onto the tar, my headlights carving a narrow tunnel through the ensemble of timber. The silence became a pressure; the radio a faint, constant open breath as I ran the familiar stretch.

""Dispatch, 3-Adam-12,"" I said, ""Confirm last known origin was off 17, past marker 22.""

""Affirmative. You should be the only thing moving out there.""

The terrain began to climb; the highway curled along the flank of a mountain in long, sweeping turns where only a guardrail stood between me and a steep drop. When the trees broke, I caught glimpses of it - the pale smear of the heaving Pacific.

By 21, the air had turned damp and cold, seeping in through the vents. My GPS started to lag - a little car sliding over green nothing. I frowned, tapping the casing with a knuckle, when the weather-beaten marker 22 lurched out of the shadows.

I parked beside it.

Fifty yards past the marker, veering off the road and into the wild on a narrowing, overgrown trail, the path, as described, stopped.

A hard, abrupt gravel edge.

""Dispatch, be advised. I've arrived at origin-""

The speaker exploded into unrelenting noise.

Not static, not feedback - voices; a hundred of them at once, slamming into my ears. Snatches of jingles, movie lines, sitcom laughs, news anchors, late-night preachers, kids shouting over commercials, pop songs, intimate phone calls; every recorded sound I'd ever heard stacked on top of each other, out of tune.

Out of time.

""-*copy that, over and out--he's looking at you, kid--baby, don't hurt me, don't--breaking news tonight as officials--wake up, she's here*.""

""Dispatch?!"" I snapped, one hand clamped on the mic, the other white-knuckled around the wheel. ""Dispatch, I'm experiencing a malfunction! Do you copy?!""

""*-late night deals you won't believe--please, if anyone is there--this is not a test, this is an emergency broadcast*\-""

Something thudded softly under my foot.

The brake pedal sank half an inch.

I hadn't moved my leg.

""No...""

I stomped down, hard. The pedal met resistance - then, bit by bit, pushed back against me.

The gear lever clicked.

PARK - REVERSE - DRIVE

""Dispatch, I-""

""-*we now return to your feature presentation*\-""

The cruiser began to roll. Slow at first, just a whisper over the gravel as I slammed my foot on the brakes, and it shrugged me off.

The wheel didn't budge either as the car aligned with the void ahead.

I twisted the key out!

Nothing!

A canned studio audience roared out from the radio, drowning out a weatherman promising clear skies and a man's ragged voice yelling, ""*They cut the road, they CUT THE ROAD-*""

I grabbed for the seatbelt, and the latch clicked, but the strap wouldn't release - remaining locked across my chest.

I hit the door handle, but it bounced against the damn frame.

""Come on!"" I spat, slamming my shoulder into it. Fruitless.

The car rolled on, patient and unbothered by my efforts.

A hoarse male voice cut through the layers.

""*Please-if anyone-I've got a daughter in*\-""

Static chewed him up and vomited him back out as a game show buzzer.

""-*wrong answer, but thanks for playing*\-""

""Stop,"" I murmured, my nerves becoming shot.

Far ahead, at the very end of the light, something began to take shape. It was a dense patch of shimmering thin white; a near-transparent wall where empty air should've been.

Fog, I told myself. Except fog didn't sit flat.

Forty yards.

The wall resolved into a smooth sheet of glitching white-and-black, texture-less, depthless static. And beyond it - for just an instant - I thought I saw the orange smear of streetlights.

""-*you are now entering--the following film contains--they said the sky was wrong--don't touch that dial, you're gonna get us all*\-"" The radio begged, pleaded, sold me detergent, laughed at its own jokes, as the distance between bumper and curtain shrank.

Thirty yards.

Twenty.

""Stop the fucking car!"" I yelled, losing all professionalism as I hammered the windows and wheel, the horn blaring weakly amidst the radio's storm.

""-*ma'am, you need to remain calm*\-""

""SHUT THE FUCK UP!""

The glitching veil loomed in, filling the windshield with nothing I had a word for. I clawed at the seatbelt, desperate - jump out, climb out, do something, anything, but go through whatever that was, yet my fate was inevitable.

So I did all I had left.

I squeezed my eyes shut and braced.

And the car rolled in.

All sense of direction vanished; the seat fell away under me, then jumped back up, and my body felt like it'd plummeted through an ice sheet beyond physics.

Every voice on the radio hit a single, piercing note.

Then silence - a quick, surgical cut into the noise.

My ears popped as the world slid back in, the car coming to a stop, and after I realised I was still breathing, I slowly forced my eyes open.

The dead-end road was gone. In its place was a wide, slick street glistening with rain; lined with buildings, flickering neon, and a diner with a crooked 'OPEN' sign. A distant pier lamp swung over black water, and, carving its way up a mountain path, was a brass-and-steel observatory gazing at the stars.

On one corner, a street sign hung from a rusted pole.

'Swallow Coast'

I finally got my hands to move and reached for the gear shift, expecting the same resistance. It moved willingly, but the engine was dead; as was my radio. I was, however, able to free myself from the seatbelt and sprang out of my powerless cruiser, feeling sick and cold on wobbling legs.

A pickup truck stalked behind a pale sedan, headlights still faint, like they were running on memory. A hatchback rested at an angle to the curb, its front tyre up on the sidewalk, attempting to flee. Closer, a cruiser from a foreign department nosed into the intersection - its pattern like mine, but the crest on the door was smudged, like vandalised paint.

They were empty. Forgotten.

""Dispatch? Are you there?""

...

I walked towards a military Humvee, hunched closer to the diner, olive metal dulled by grime. A faded stencil on the door spelt 'U.S Army', but the unit markings beneath were the same as the cruiser. The passenger door hung open.

I peered in.

No gear, no duffels, no guns; just seats, and the impression that its occupants simply evaporated. The sedan had a purse on the driver's seat, its contents scattered: a wallet, receipts, a cracked phone frozen on a family photo, the seatbelt slack and twisted, the engine cold.

I turned back the way I'd come, towards where the road should've cut.

Instead, the street sloped gently upward until it met a structure that did not belong here. At first, I mistook it for a cell tower, but it was a makeshift lattice of metal and cables - antennas speared out; dish arrays, spiralled coils, panels that hummed faintly with colour. Wires as thick as my arm ran down into a fenced-off outpost bristling with control boxes and blinking lights.

I had to crane my neck to see the beacon at the peak - a red light flashing randomly.

Behind the tower, barely, hung the 'thing' I'd driven through.

From this side, the veil was much thinner. Instead of a static wall, it was more like distorted glass - a wavering, curving slice of sky that didn't fit.

More vehicles sat at the base, facing the shimmer; unquestionably military, rusting and rotten, all pointed at the same impossible curtain.

The tower then hummed as if waking up, and my radio sparked to life - coughing out a single, wailing tone that stung my ears and rattled my teeth.

I didn't notice it immediately, only catching the structure in the corner of my eye as my head pounded, but up in the mountain, the observatory *shivered*.

From the street, it looked textbook - a crown perched atop the rocks with domes and spires winking like old coins, highlighted by either its own gleaming light or what they caught from the stars.

Yet under the signal's pressure, the whole building shook.

Then the first **rip** happened.

The observatory spasmed and snapped, as if a cursor were trying to drag it across a screen; it remained in place, defiantly, but it became distorted, as if shifted through eras. For a blink, the glass was cracked and dark, the brass tarnished, and entire sections hung loose, like something blew it up from inside.

My radio climbed another notch, drilling through my jaw and violating my skull.

The observatory jerked again - now under construction.

Floodlights bleached the mountain path, support beams and half-built walls cast shadows across the rocks; domes became webs of hollow steel, and cranes hung over the whole scene, jittering and flickering as the sky seized from night to day to night again. I could almost hear construction noises - shouted instructions, the clatter of tools, the whistling of men.

I fell to my hands and knees, a trickle of blood oozing from my nose.

Everything was vibrating.

The observatory stuttered once more. It burned.

Orange triumphed inside the central dome; flames beat metal, smoke rolled up in a thick column, but didn't behave right - freezing, lagging. Something within it pulsed white-hot, brighter than any heat I'd ever seen, as my vision blurred, and the road under me melted, then hardened, becoming dirt and snow and magma. I tasted metal in the deepest recesses of my throat as my radio reached a pitch I didn't think was possible.

The observatory tore a final time, but not just the building.

The sky above split open.

A hairline crack at first - a tiny, jagged, thin line - that widened in wild jumps, tearing and stopping, until a gaping wound hung over the mountain.

A scar of colourless deep, where stars were packed far too close together - undiscovered by any astronomer.

They didn't twinkle like jewels. They blinked like eyes.

A pungent waft of burnt electricity rolled down the mountain and filled the street, as my radio became another chorus of relentless sound.

""-*entrance. logged*\--*all units, hold the line, do not approach--test the alert, damn it--alpha, requesting permission to--swiper no swiping--praise be, brothers and sisters--pay separate shipping and handling--if you or a loved one has been diagnosed with cancer--observatory team, do you copy--what the FUCK IS THAT THING--top 10 cartoon themes, number 3 will--this message will repeat--he's still in there--side effects may include dizziness, nausea, loss of self, existential dread--what have you done, boy*\-*-we are here LIVE from Swallow Coast where it seems a-*""

The radio cut out, damning me into another empty silence as the ripping of space stopped, my vision returned through harsh blinks, and the observatory clicked back to normalcy. I scrubbed trembling hands over my nose and lips, wiping away blood, and considered curling into a ball right there on the road among hollow cars, until the next signal came and fried my head to putty.

What in God's name had I done to deserve this?

""*Ellie...*""

I didn't believe I'd heard them at first, my ears and head still clearing the pain, but as my composure slowly crawled back, I realised someone was trying to talk to me over the radio.

""*Ellie--you there?*""

Not a gurgle of madness, but a sane, deliberate attempt at communication; still not just a lone voice, but several, concerned dialects - never repeating - of varying ages and tones, taking turns in between statics.

""-*click receiver \[static\] alive--just breathe, girl \[static\] not alone-*""

I jabbed at my radio.

Click.

""-*copy, she hears \[static\] the diner \[static\] equipment--trust-*""

A new voice slid in between them, low and bitter.

""-***you're not going anywhere***\-""

""-*cut them out! \[static\] ignore--scared--not one of us-*""

I forced my thumb down, my voice raw and scratched.

""Who are you? What the fuck is this place?""

""-*pocket \[static\] failed test--caught signal-*"" A child's voice flickered in. ""-*they turned it on, and it never turned off-*"" Then a soft old man. ""*-observatory is unstable*\-"" Then a calm, hurried woman. ""-*held it as long \[static\] can't get up--you can-*""

""What?! Me?! Why, what did I-""

There was a beat of overlapping sharp breaths, pleas and begs; then a gentle, older woman.

""*-sorry, sweetheart \[static\] your car \[static\] radio--a line in \[static\] can't lose-""*

\*""-\****chose you*** *\[static\]* ***lab rat***\-""

A squeal of feedback, then the calm woman again.

""-*reaches further \[static\] every breach \[static\] spreading--understand?*""

Finally, a man.

""-*doctor \[static\] seen it--outside \[static\] right place, right time \[static\] guide you--move, now \[static\] shut it \[static\] free us-*""

The channel fluttered, then steadied into a song of tangled encouragement, praise, and laughs and cries, and faint, drowned-out screams.

""Okay,"" I said, more to myself, seeing no other choice. ""Tell me what to do.""

\-

The closer I got to the diner, the more the streets had been terraformed into a military foothold.

Another Humvee crouched half a block down, choking the roads; cracks inched across its windshield, then retreated, like the glass was deciding whether or not to shatter. Farther along, a gloomy, armoured truck sat with its back doors open. Inside was empty, save for a single dangling headset swinging in still air.

A few steps from the truck, they'd planted a miniature radio tower. It was no taller than me - just a braced mast bolted straight into the earth. At its base, a metal shoebox hummed faintly, LEDs frozen mid-blink.

""*-repeater-*"" a measured, academic voice said over my radio. ""*-node--jam the \[static\] cage-*""

""Didn't work?"" I asked.

""*-not for long-*"" a regretful woman answered.

Beyond it were two tripod rigs, their heads pointed towards the street.

Except the mounts weren't guns.

The closest carried a cluster of speakers - flat, hexagonal panels arranged in a honeycomb, each one mottled with a mesh of tiny holes, ringed with melted plastic. The path directly in front of the speaker array was scorched in a perfect cone, not by heat, but by... absence. There was no grit, no oil stains, just a smooth, blasted-down layer of reality.

The other tripod mounted a lamp. A fat cylinder with cooling fins and nested lenses, tagged with a warning label - UV ONLY. The beam was off, but a faint violet tint clung to the terrain it aimed at.

""*-light--burns \[static\] sound--stuns-*""

""*-****calibre*** *\[static\]* ***severs*** ***the****-*""

The unwelcome voices were diluted out again.

""Who are they?"" I asked, inspecting the tripods. ""The ones you keep shutting up?""

""*-fractured \[static\] dangerous--uncooperative-*""

A low sandbag wall braced the mouth of a nearby alley. Riot shields leaned carelessly along it, their viewports spangled with neat, clustered cracks.

From here, the alley tightened and dead-ended against a brick wall painted with peeling graffiti, but the air above the sandbags bent wrong, like I was looking through a fisheye. I took one cautious step closer and saw, for only an instant, the suggestion of another street cutting across the wall: cars nose-to-ass, a bus shelter, the swarming of civilians, a billboard in a language I couldn't understand.

A second layer of another town, out of alignment.

Then I blinked, and the alley ended with a wall again.

""*-don't go in there-*""

""Yeah, no shit.""

The radio chuckled - a quick, nervous ripple of different laughs.

Ahead, the diner waited.

The windows stuttered worse than the Humvee - intact, webbed, blown out - and the OPEN sign rolled through the wrong sequence - O P N E - before becoming abstract symbols my eyes slid off. It hurt to look at. The foundation was stitched with bullet holes; casings littered the ground - little brass maps charting where soldiers had stood and fired, and fired again, at something that left no trace.

""What were they shooting at?""

My question was met with silence.

Then, the bitter voice - softer now.

""***Us*** *\[static\]* ***not enough***\*-\*""

My hand brushed over my sidearm.

""*-inside, Ellie \[static\] tools-*"" the kind woman urged, ""-*survival*\-""

The bell above the door rang three different times as the smell hit me.

Decay - old, dried out, folded under dust and chemicals, and burnt coffee and fried grease soaked so deeply into the walls. The stuttering was horrid: seats went from cracked red vinyl to bare springs and torn yellow form, then back again; menus flickered in and out of existence, and a jukebox danced between models. Tables had been shoved around a central aisle, their legs braced. Cots crowded the floor - army-issue frames sagging under mattresses, sheets twisted and stained, and a portable generator cowered near the counter, its casing open; wires spilt out like guts, threading through ammo crates and jerry-rigged equipment.

I saw him then.

He sat in the last booth, facing the door. For a moment, I thought he was asleep - chin tucked, shoulders hunched, but the details became apparent.

The soldier was almost a skeleton.

Brittle fatigue clung to him; his uniform stiffened by dust. What skin I could see was like parchment, pulled tight over bone in sunken hollows; his dog tag had fused with his collarbone, the metal nesting in a little crater where his flesh had given up, and his jaw hung loose, teeth bared... a man exhausted from screaming.

His hand still cupped the air near his temple, fingers frozen around a missing pistol, a dark crater in the booth's backrest staining where the bullet had gone - a grainy, pixelated splatter.

My stomach knotted.

Two objects in front of him offered themselves to me.

The first was a flashlight, stubby and industrial with a wide, dark lens ringed with faded warning tape. The other was a compact speaker; one side a grid of tiny holes, the opposite a switch.

A worn voice breathed out on my shoulder.

""-*good man--kind--brave-*""

I cleared my throat. ""Yet he died alone.""

""-*better that than \[static\] lost in--signals-*""

I reached out for the pocket speaker.

""-*careful \[static\] tuned-*"" the academic voice muttered.

""For what?""

They all spoke at once, a tangle of the same answer.

""-*to be louder than them*\-""

I placed both tools in my belt.

Then the soldier's skull tilted, vertebrae creaking, and my heart lurched; hand flying to my sidearm, but it was only my disturbance of the table that moved him. I breathed a sigh of relief and steadied my pulse... when *his* radio came alive, a clunky handset clipped to his waist.

It did not speak; it hissed.

""-***LEAVE IT ON*** *\[static\]* ***GO HOME, GIRL***\*--**YOU'LL KILL US**\-\*""

My own radio crackled in sympathy, and my company interjected, but they were suddenly faint.

""-*Ellie \[static\] focus--don't*\-""

The soldier's radio overpowered them, its volume spiking.

""-***NOT*** *\[static\]* ***THE FIRST PIG*** *\[static\]* ***THEY LIE***\*--**THEY SENT ALL**\-""\* a sobbing child's voice warped through ""-***WE HURT*** *\[static\]* ***DON'T TURN US OFF***\*-""\*

Both radios screamed - a thousand voices mashed together.

""*-ELLIE, GET OUT OF--FEEDBACK--COMING*\--***found you***\--\*try--\*\*\*\*RAM IT, BURN IT--\*\*\**speaker--****kill your radio****--****KILL YOURSELF****--don't touch*\--*not whole anymore--angry--****STILL HERE****--****STILL FEEL****-""*

It was a thrash of sound - threats, pleas, curses, prayers, all ground together - that ached my head. I didn't hesitate. I reached for the portable speaker, flipped the switch, and my world tunnelled as it squealed a deafening wail. The generator hiccupped, the overhead lights burned and burst, the jukebox lit up and spun through songs too fast, and the dead soldier's radio cut off as his body slumped forward.

Then there was only silence as I found myself alone in a dark diner, the speaker hot against my waist.

My own radio crackled twice, confused.

""*-Ellie?!*""

Then it too failed.

And for the first time, Swallow Coast was truly quiet.

The diner's own sounds quickly crept out like insects: the creaks of booths adjusting to no weight, a slow, patient drip from somewhere in the kitchen, the soft, intermittent hum of the neon sign outside. Breath left my lungs in slippery, shaky exhales, as I fidgeted with my radio - not willing to accept this loneliness as permanent.

*Ding*.

The bell above the front door chimed.

Once. Perfectly.

*Ding.*

Again.

The door didn't move, but the sound was thicker this time - as if underwater. The air near the entrance wobbled, just a fraction, as I drew my gun and the flashlight.

*Ding.*

The doorframe trembled in place, smearing sideways in short, nauseating skips, then bulged and rippled and flattened, and *something* pressed through it.

Familiar broken nonsense reached me first.

""*-don't touch that dial, we'll be right with you \[flatline\] you're about to start \[phone dial\] one woman, one night, lost her friends \[Windows Startup\] coming up: a local officer goes \[sirens\]* ***skinned and flayed***\*-\*""

The idea of a man began to materialise, cobbled together from a disjointed static mass of flickering grey fuzz; his chest strobed between suits, hoodies, bare skin, hospital gowns, and his face was layers upon layers over a vertical slack - an old man's profile, a child's wide eyes, a woman's gaping mouth mid-scream, a teenager chewing gum. They swam through one another, never syncing, each countless expression trying to dominate the other; far too many crammed into the same outline.

Every time he moved, pieces of him lagged behind at different frame-rates or spasmed into mundane tasks, as a radio snow flaked off his edges, popping and disintegrating into nothing. He stepped into the diner (if you could call it that), tearing out of the door, the sounds of his feet were complex, dry keyboard clicks dubbed over with car doors, gunshots, soda cans, and a microphone. The air bent around him, violating the space into an elongated, glitching funhouse.

Then he looked at me, and all the mouths in his head smiled.

""-*anomaly. found-*""

On intuition, my thumb pressed the taped switch on the flashlight, and a solid, bruise-dark violet bar erupted and hit the 'man' square in the chest. The result was instant. Touched by the light, the static went from grey to a blistering, overexposed white and orange - then burned brighter than the sun. Pieces of mismatched people peeled back like melting film, bubbling out of existence, as a dozen borrowed eyes flared and scowled.

A film-trailer voice gulped mid-sentence, dropping a few octaves, and a jingle stretched into a thin, digital scream as the air around it pulsed back several inches toward normal. The creature staggered, raising its jittery, convulsive arms to shield itself; the mosaic of broadcast it used as skin blackened where the beam stayed, edges crisping and curling, as it *roared* \- a remix of half-sponsored messages and corrupted sound bites scratching in my ears.

It tried to advance, lugging a step towards me, so I fired.

The bullet hit where the UV light had already cooked its form, right in a raw patch of boiling static, but instead of a clean entry wound, reality tore as its flesh blew open in a geyser of white noise. I saw inside it: frames of other places, hallways, headlights, an operating table, someone's bedroom - swirling past the hole in a blur. The bullet cut through them all, dragging a comet-tail of glitch with it, as the creature convulsed. Every piece of it slipped further out of sync; faces morphed into a screaming collage, several arms twitched in delayed directions, its outline ballooned, as a bomb of sound erupted from it - hurling me off my feet and into a table.

Its body blew outward like a grenade. Static detonated into a jagged sphere, shredding through tile and chrome and glass, as half the diner's wall ceased to be - ripped out of space.

Then it fled onto the street - a teleporting, slithering mass of pained static - before vanishing into the night, leaving a brief, untextured trail of vertigo-inducing grey in its wake.

The OPEN sign outside flashed a new word in between blinks, letters stuttering into place where they didn't belong.

'LIVE'

I stumbled outside, head and heart pounding, and leaned on a car that wasn't quite there.

Six months on the force, I had my first domestic.

Second floor of a shitty apartment, end of the hall, number already flagged for 'prior incidents'. Neighbours had reported shouting and a crying kid, so Dispatch tossed me over. A young woman met me at the door, red-eyed with a polite smile that didn't match her shaking hands.

'He' hovered in the kitchen.

No damage, nothing broken, no visible injuries, no kid; just a raised voice and overreacting neighbours.

My gut whispered that it wasn't nothing - the way she glanced at him before every answer. But policy pays no mind to 'gut feelings'. I took their statements, handed over a pamphlet, told her she could call us anytime, and I went home to a warm bed.

But then I went back.

Again.

And again.

*And again*.

Different days, same apartment, same rushed apology; same look in her eyes, same break in her voice. Yet every time, *every time*, things looked just calm enough to walk away from.

The last callout was quiet. No shouts, no cries; the neighbours said the silence concerned them more. The TV was still on when I entered.

She was on the couch, eyes raw, long gone from this world.

While He hung in the bedroom with blood on his hands.

I did everything by the book on that one. Got told it wasn't my fault, but I knew better. I'd walked away from that mangy little home plenty of times when my instincts told me not to. So when a radio asked for help from nowhere, from a place that didn't exist, I knew my mind would've been made up.

Atonement, maybe.

I think that's why I saw her little face amidst a gunshot wound of white noise and broken static. Not angry or sad, merely... watching. Judging.

Wondering if I'd run away again.

The second **rip** came without mercy.

The observatory didn't only shake this time - it imploded. Invisible, folding billows sped down the mountain like shockwaves, crashing through the forest and impacting the street, splintering everything they touched, breaking structures apart and rebuilding them in the span of thoughts. I watched people spawn in and out in different styles, from various decades; kids on bikes, soldiers in masks, tourists with cameras, walking through each other, through me, through anything that was or wasn't there.

Then I saw myself.

A multitude of Ellies, scattered through the maddening mess, with torn uniforms and guns drawn or not even a cop at all, running for their lives, praying on their knees, walking their dogs, staring up at the sky, and the waves kept coming; time and space buckled, reformed, then buckled again, as my insides began to crawl out of my body.

I thought this would be my end, lost in a paradoxical typhoon - reduced to an unexplainable phenomenon - but then, somewhere inside the chaos, the worst of it calmed, and my radio spat out a ragged word.

""-*climb*\-""

My ghosts had returned; a familiar, comforting patchwork of timid, exhausted voices.

""-*mountain path \[static\] with you--brace \[static\] up*\-""

\-

Astronauts describe walking on the moon as a mix of 'magnificent desolation', with stark beauty and intense light, but also a sense of indescribable wonder and adventure - a trampoline bounce in low gravity, as Earth hangs in a jet-black, starless sky.

I wondered how such trained, privileged adventurers would describe wading through Hell, as my first step onto the gravel-caked, rotting wood landed seconds before I did, the ground buffering under my weight. The path ascended fast, shouldering into the trees; a nervy strip of nature that couldn't settle, while the leaking observatory hung above it like a bad omen.

Out here, the equipment was different.

Instead of jammers and tripods, the hardware along the path had been built as a fence. Short pylons stood in rows on either side of the trail, no higher than my hip, drilled straight into the roots. Between them, lines of invisible pressure danced in the air, catching the moonlight in wrong ways.

UV lamps the size of flares were cradled in the metal, their light pointed not at the town, but out into the trees; burning clean wedges of bleached bark. Cinderblock speakers squatted between the lamps, their faces singing in frozen sound.

There was a thick grain of slow-moving static just beyond the barrier. Shapes heaved just past the reach of the light, packed shoulder-to-shoulder along the mountainside: loose silhouettes, glitching outlines, people and not-people slow as sleep. Blank faces drifted in and out of the gloom - dozens, maybe hundreds.

Every few meters, a pylon pulsed weakly, and the nearest shape flinched, restrained under some pressure I couldn't see or feel, but *hear*.

A containment of light and sound, wrapped around the path and beyond.

But it wasn't perfect.

At the very start of the trail, two pylons had been dragged just enough out of alignment - their cables snagged, their housings cracked. Between them, the air sagged, and the invisible pressure caved inward. Occasionally, a fleeting crack would appear, and a grey hand would slither out, flickering between nails, metal, and bone. It clawed at the gap, pushing through, when the nearest UV canister coughed out what strength it had and blistered the hand into white-hot confetti.

The crack would seal, temporarily.

I understood how one of them could've escaped.

My radio gave the softest click.

""*-walk quiet--trench line-*""

Soon, I stopped just short of the observatory, in a car park of grand, curated scientific study sprawled with white tents and MOCs - their terminals still running.

Up close, the building was disappointingly ordinary. It was never the problem.

Every instrument they had up here, every setup, their endless arsenal of gadgets, faced the mountain - hooked up with cables and sensors, like a giant patient in need of surgery.

What they monitored was not a shape, but a wound in geometry - an impossible prism of light moulded into the granite; blooming edges of colourless bursts, a radiant malfunction of stuttering angles, and vibrating in horrid, wiggling wretches, blasting out waves of energy that spilt into the town below.

""*-woken--vessel* *\[static\] you see \[static\] crashed--stuck*\-""

""How do I turn it-""

""-***we remember you***\-""

The others made no attempt to silence their fractured comrades, who then spoke with unrivalled clarity.

""*You shot them. Bold. Most get scared*.""

""What're-""

""*All of them. Every wave. Look*.""

My eyes glazed over the protruding vessel.

It shimmered, in perfect sync, with every word.

""*People do not belong in here. Release them*.""

A myriad of colours oozed from its hull as it tried to phase out of the rock. A bastion of obelisks amidst the ground, the first line of defence wired to the MOCs, matched its rainbow display in tandem.

""... how?""

""*One of the terminals. Shut it down. All of it. Please*.""

Before I could move, a gabble of noise stumbled up the path behind me, replacing the cadence of commercials and cartoons with clipped military channels.

""-*Alpha to F.O.B \[Beep\] field log corrupted, retrying \[Buzz\] do you have any idea what they're doing up \[static\]*\-""

My boots skidded as I bolted to the nearest terminal. I slapped keys and snapped a cursor through unreadable fields and thermals until a green menu stared back.

\> NODE: OBSERVATORY

\> STATUS: UNSTABLE

\> COMMAND: \_ \_ \_

""*End.*"" Said my radio.

""What?!""

""*Command. End*.""

I glanced over my shoulder at the rippling air and oncoming chatter as the thing took shape. It had changed uniforms, shifting through combat gear and lab coats, then blue hazmat suits and armour.

""-*hey! who's there?! \[static\] are we authorised for this \[static\] greatest breakthrough of our species, and you wanna get cold feet \[static\] subject: persistent-correction required*""

\> COMMAND: END

I nearly slammed it in.

And the world popped.

For a breath, there was no sound - only a pressure change. Then, every electronic in sight croaked dead at once. The speaker on my belt sparked and flung itself off, dissolving. My flashlight exploded, ripping through my flesh with jagged pieces and a violet burst, falling me to one knee with a yelp.

Then the mountain screamed.

The 'vessel' flared and ripped itself free, tearing the stone like it was wet paper. Granite peeled and crumbled, scaffolding and cables snapped, trucks flipped several feet into the air and phased through the ground. The prism wrenched itself out in a spray of dust and broken light, took a single, staggered look at its reeling saviour, and then, in a single jump... it was gone, a streak vanishing straight into the sky.

From the veil I had driven through, a quake detonated - a rupture rolling in on itself like a sheet, becoming a towering wall of static-white, reaching the clouds, that erased everything it touched as it volleyed towards us.

*Us*.

The pain in my leg had distracted me enough to not realise the static man was still here, still advancing.

""-*final state pending \[static\] final state pending \[static\] final*\-""

I drew my pistol and emptied every bullet, but without the UV light, it was like shooting a fog. Round after round pinged through its body, absorbed by glimpses of rooms, of other skies, and it kept coming; now devoid of any features remotely human.

I reloaded with shaking, bloody hands and fired again until my gun clicked.

The encroaching white wall swallowed the base of the path, then the observatory, as the entity reached for me, its many hands smearing into my face as a glow washed over its shoulders... and I closed my eyes.

The wall took us in a single, enveloping surge.

Then there was nothing at all.

\-

""Ellie?""

I knew his voice; he sounded amused.

""You still with us, kid?""

I opened my eyes to find myself on a stretcher, a paramedic tending the bandages around my leg, and a wrinkled hand in front of me snapping his fingers.

""Helloooo? Earth to Ellie?""

I was still at the observatory; military equipment had been replaced with a police presence and some suspicious vans, their open doors revealing cargoes of narcotics. Punks were slammed onto the hoods of cruisers, cuffed, and shoved into back seats.

An older, grizzled cop looked down at me, one arm in a sling.

""I... what?"" I stammered out.

""Did she hit her head?"" He asked the paramedic, and I knew then where I'd heard him before -  an officer who radioed a 10-33.

""She lost a bit of blood, that's all. Give her a minute.""

Behind them, a news crew assembled. A redhead reporter chucked away her cigarette and rustled her hair as her cameraman counted her down.

""Are we ready? Cool-We are here LIVE from Swallow Coast where it seems a brave batch of officers have made history in one of the largest drug busts Oregon has ever known-""

I drowned her out, rubbing my temples.

Marcus was his name, who insisted on escorting me back to my car despite my demand to be alone. Every step, I felt sick. I expected the sky to tweak, or a shadow to lag behind me - *something* leftover.

Instead, Swallow Coast looked like any other town.

The diner wore a fresh coat of paint and boasted a health-inspected 'A' in the window. A teenager replaced a dead soldier in the end booth, wiping down tables, earbuds in; the only radio noise was a pop station whining about breakups and summer love.

If I tried hard enough, I could almost convince myself that I'd hallucinated the whole thing.

Blood loss from shrapnel?

Stress?

Almost.

Until a select few sounds hit my ears the wrong way, my newfound tubby friend paying no mind to my tiny flinches. Eventually, we reached my cruiser - still 'parked' at the edge of town, where a friendly mechanic fiddled inside the hood, finalising his work, overlooked by an old cell tower.

""How's she looking?!"" Marcus barked.

He looked at me. ""Ah, she'll drive, but your precinct needs to upgrade your wheels. This thing's a fucking relic.""

""I'll keep it in mind,"" I said, suddenly very eager to drive far, far away from this place.

But Marcus wouldn't allow that, oh no - not until he'd said goodbye. He watched me slide into my driver’s seat before planting himself in the doorway, leaning nonchalantly on the roof.

""You sure you're okay?""

""Yeah, fine.""

""If you say so, hero. And don't worry,"" he winked, ""I'm gonna be putting in a good word with your chief-oh, hold on-"" his hand flicked over my shoulder, ""-huh... your radio was off. Weird.""

""Ha, yeah... *weird*.""

""Well, drive safe. And if I ever need backup again, I'm asking for you personally."" He chuckled and made his leave with a hefty wave.

I waited until his shape was gone before shrivelling and collapsing into my seat, my hand snapping over my throbbing chest. Tears welled up fast and I sobbed and fitted like a toddler, until my radio spoke, and I almost shrieked.

""You're back on the system, 3-Adam-12! We thought we lost you! What happened?!""

I composed myself quickly, wiping my face.

""Uh... my car, um-... broke, Dispatch.""

""... broke?""

""That's right.""

""Okay... I'll make a note of that. Anything else to report?""

""No, Dispatch. Say, do you-""

""Hold on, 3-Adam-12-"" her attention was taken away ""-right, we've got a domestic the next town over, all local units are busy. Feeling up for it?""

I'd barely caught my own breath as I looked out at the sunrise.

It was unlike any I'd seen.

""I... yeah..."" I rallied myself. ""Show me en route.""",1,1767340310.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

But my night was only beginning.

The dash radio didn't just crackle to life - it sputtered in jumbled, inaudible pieces. I assumed the worn-down piece of shit was broken as I flicked away my butt and slogged back to the door, but I barely had time to sit down when a man's voice slipped through the garbled static.

""*10-33, all units! \[static\] 10-33, all units, please, I'm-*"" Something was wrong with his voice. Each burst of static carried a different version of the same man; layered, varied tones out of sync.

""*Swallow Coast is \[static\] Swallow Coast is gone--Swallow Coast is... wrong \[static\]* *PLEASE, MY*\-""

The voices then stumbled together into a single, dead tone and repeated the same phrase over and over.

""*help us*""

Then it broke apart again, overlapping into a shattered mess of protocol codes, before cutting off to a null silence. My hand was halfway to the volume knob, trembling; I'd heard panicked officers be shot at before, fighting to speak, but never had I heard *anything* like that.

A glitch? A ghost? A dream? My mind raced down every avenue, but a single ugly detail kept pecking at my brain.

'Swallow Coast'

Training kicked in.

""Dispatch, 3-Adam-12,"" I said, my voice sounding far steadier than I felt. ""Copy an unknown 10-33 that just came over my in-car. Unidentified officer, no call sign, giving location as 'Swallow Coast.'""

I stared out at the empty road.

""Be advised,"" I added, forcing the words out, ""I don't show a 'Swallow Coast' on any local grids. Can you run a trace on the transmission?""

I released the button, and the radio went back to dead air.

""3-Adam-12, Dispatch here."" Her voice was calm, but there was a hesitance to it. ""We've got a hit.""

""Go ahead, Dispatch.""

""Signal's bouncing off the east repeater, origin somewhere off County Road 17, past marker 22."" Papers rustled faintly on her end. ""Be advised that stretch is... it just *ends* out there.""

I squinted through the windshield, trying to picture it.

I'd patrolled that road a hundred times.

""Dispatch, confirm. You're telling me an emergency call came from the middle of nowhere?""

""Affirmative. How do you want to proceed?""

I glanced at the black stretch of highway disappearing into the trees, and took a deep breath.

""Dispatch, show me en route.""

I flipped on my lights and pulled back onto the tar, my headlights carving a narrow tunnel through the ensemble of timber. The silence became a pressure; the radio a faint, constant open breath as I ran the familiar stretch.

""Dispatch, 3-Adam-12,"" I said, ""Confirm last known origin was off 17, past marker 22.""

""Affirmative. You should be the only thing moving out there.""

The terrain began to climb; the highway curled along the flank of a mountain in long, sweeping turns where only a guardrail stood between me and a steep drop. When the trees broke, I caught glimpses of it - the pale smear of the heaving Pacific.

By 21, the air had turned damp and cold, seeping in through the vents. My GPS started to lag - a little car sliding over green nothing. I frowned, tapping the casing with a knuckle, when the weather-beaten marker 22 lurched out of the shadows.

I parked beside it.

Fifty yards past the marker, veering off the road and into the wild on a narrowing, overgrown trail, the path, as described, stopped.

A hard, abrupt gravel edge.

""Dispatch, be advised. I've arrived at origin-""

The speaker exploded into unrelenting noise.

Not static, not feedback - voices; a hundred of them at once, slamming into my ears. Snatches of jingles, movie lines, sitcom laughs, news anchors, late-night preachers, kids shouting over commercials, pop songs, intimate phone calls; every recorded sound I'd ever heard stacked on top of each other, out of tune.

Out of time.

""-*copy that, over and out--he's looking at you, kid--baby, don't hurt me, don't--breaking news tonight as officials--wake up, she's here*.""

""Dispatch?!"" I snapped, one hand clamped on the mic, the other white-knuckled around the wheel. ""Dispatch, I'm experiencing a malfunction! Do you copy?!""

""*-late night deals you won't believe--please, if anyone is there--this is not a test, this is an emergency broadcast*\-""

Something thudded softly under my foot.

The brake pedal sank half an inch.

I hadn't moved my leg.

""No...""

I stomped down, hard. The pedal met resistance - then, bit by bit, pushed back against me.

The gear lever clicked.

PARK - REVERSE - DRIVE

""Dispatch, I-""

""-*we now return to your feature presentation*\-""

The cruiser began to roll. Slow at first, just a whisper over the gravel as I slammed my foot on the brakes, and it shrugged me off.

The wheel didn't budge either as the car aligned with the void ahead.

I twisted the key out!

Nothing!

A canned studio audience roared out from the radio, drowning out a weatherman promising clear skies and a man's ragged voice yelling, ""*They cut the road, they CUT THE ROAD-*""

I grabbed for the seatbelt, and the latch clicked, but the strap wouldn't release - remaining locked across my chest.

I hit the door handle, but it bounced against the damn frame.

""Come on!"" I spat, slamming my shoulder into it. Fruitless.

The car rolled on, patient and unbothered by my efforts.

A hoarse male voice cut through the layers.

""*Please-if anyone-I've got a daughter in*\-""

Static chewed him up and vomited him back out as a game show buzzer.

""-*wrong answer, but thanks for playing*\-""

""Stop,"" I murmured, my nerves becoming shot.

Far ahead, at the very end of the light, something began to take shape. It was a dense patch of shimmering thin white; a near-transparent wall where empty air should've been.

Fog, I told myself. Except fog didn't sit flat.

Forty yards.

The wall resolved into a smooth sheet of glitching white-and-black, texture-less, depthless static. And beyond it - for just an instant - I thought I saw the orange smear of streetlights.

""-*you are now entering--the following film contains--they said the sky was wrong--don't touch that dial, you're gonna get us all*\-"" The radio begged, pleaded, sold me detergent, laughed at its own jokes, as the distance between bumper and curtain shrank.

Thirty yards.

Twenty.

""Stop the fucking car!"" I yelled, losing all professionalism as I hammered the windows and wheel, the horn blaring weakly amidst the radio's storm.

""-*ma'am, you need to remain calm*\-""

""SHUT THE FUCK UP!""

The glitching veil loomed in, filling the windshield with nothing I had a word for. I clawed at the seatbelt, desperate - jump out, climb out, do something, anything, but go through whatever that was, yet my fate was inevitable.

So I did all I had left.

I squeezed my eyes shut and braced.

And the car rolled in.

All sense of direction vanished; the seat fell away under me, then jumped back up, and my body felt like it'd plummeted through an ice sheet beyond physics.

Every voice on the radio hit a single, piercing note.

Then silence - a quick, surgical cut into the noise.

My ears popped as the world slid back in, the car coming to a stop, and after I realised I was still breathing, I slowly forced my eyes open.

The dead-end road was gone. In its place was a wide, slick street glistening with rain; lined with buildings, flickering neon, and a diner with a crooked 'OPEN' sign. A distant pier lamp swung over black water, and, carving its way up a mountain path, was a brass-and-steel observatory gazing at the stars.

On one corner, a street sign hung from a rusted pole.

'Swallow Coast'

I finally got my hands to move and reached for the gear shift, expecting the same resistance. It moved willingly, but the engine was dead; as was my radio. I was, however, able to free myself from the seatbelt and sprang out of my powerless cruiser, feeling sick and cold on wobbling legs.

A pickup truck stalked behind a pale sedan, headlights still faint, like they were running on memory. A hatchback rested at an angle to the curb, its front tyre up on the sidewalk, attempting to flee. Closer, a cruiser from a foreign department nosed into the intersection - its pattern like mine, but the crest on the door was smudged, like vandalised paint.

They were empty. Forgotten.

""Dispatch? Are you there?""

...

I walked towards a military Humvee, hunched closer to the diner, olive metal dulled by grime. A faded stencil on the door spelt 'U.S Army', but the unit markings beneath were the same as the cruiser. The passenger door hung open.

I peered in.

No gear, no duffels, no guns; just seats, and the impression that its occupants simply evaporated. The sedan had a purse on the driver's seat, its contents scattered: a wallet, receipts, a cracked phone frozen on a family photo, the seatbelt slack and twisted, the engine cold.

I turned back the way I'd come, towards where the road should've cut.

Instead, the street sloped gently upward until it met a structure that did not belong here. At first, I mistook it for a cell tower, but it was a makeshift lattice of metal and cables - antennas speared out; dish arrays, spiralled coils, panels that hummed faintly with colour. Wires as thick as my arm ran down into a fenced-off outpost bristling with control boxes and blinking lights.

I had to crane my neck to see the beacon at the peak - a red light flashing randomly.

Behind the tower, barely, hung the 'thing' I'd driven through.

From this side, the veil was much thinner. Instead of a static wall, it was more like distorted glass - a wavering, curving slice of sky that didn't fit.

More vehicles sat at the base, facing the shimmer; unquestionably military, rusting and rotten, all pointed at the same impossible curtain.

The tower then hummed as if waking up, and my radio sparked to life - coughing out a single, wailing tone that stung my ears and rattled my teeth.

I didn't notice it immediately, only catching the structure in the corner of my eye as my head pounded, but up in the mountain, the observatory *shivered*.

From the street, it looked textbook - a crown perched atop the rocks with domes and spires winking like old coins, highlighted by either its own gleaming light or what they caught from the stars.

Yet under the signal's pressure, the whole building shook.

Then the first **rip** happened.

The observatory spasmed and snapped, as if a cursor were trying to drag it across a screen; it remained in place, defiantly, but it became distorted, as if shifted through eras. For a blink, the glass was cracked and dark, the brass tarnished, and entire sections hung loose, like something blew it up from inside.

My radio climbed another notch, drilling through my jaw and violating my skull.

The observatory jerked again - now under construction.

Floodlights bleached the mountain path, support beams and half-built walls cast shadows across the rocks; domes became webs of hollow steel, and cranes hung over the whole scene, jittering and flickering as the sky seized from night to day to night again. I could almost hear construction noises - shouted instructions, the clatter of tools, the whistling of men.

I fell to my hands and knees, a trickle of blood oozing from my nose.

Everything was vibrating.

The observatory stuttered once more. It burned.

Orange triumphed inside the central dome; flames beat metal, smoke rolled up in a thick column, but didn't behave right - freezing, lagging. Something within it pulsed white-hot, brighter than any heat I'd ever seen, as my vision blurred, and the road under me melted, then hardened, becoming dirt and snow and magma. I tasted metal in the deepest recesses of my throat as my radio reached a pitch I didn't think was possible.

The observatory tore a final time, but not just the building.

The sky above split open.

A hairline crack at first - a tiny, jagged, thin line - that widened in wild jumps, tearing and stopping, until a gaping wound hung over the mountain.

A scar of colourless deep, where stars were packed far too close together - undiscovered by any astronomer.

They didn't twinkle like jewels. They blinked like eyes.

A pungent waft of burnt electricity rolled down the mountain and filled the street, as my radio became another chorus of relentless sound.

""-*entrance. logged*\--*all units, hold the line, do not approach--test the alert, damn it--alpha, requesting permission to--swiper no swiping--praise be, brothers and sisters--pay separate shipping and handling--if you or a loved one has been diagnosed with cancer--observatory team, do you copy--what the FUCK IS THAT THING--top 10 cartoon themes, number 3 will--this message will repeat--he's still in there--side effects may include dizziness, nausea, loss of self, existential dread--what have you done, boy*\-*-we are here LIVE from Swallow Coast where it seems a-*""

The radio cut out, damning me into another empty silence as the ripping of space stopped, my vision returned through harsh blinks, and the observatory clicked back to normalcy. I scrubbed trembling hands over my nose and lips, wiping away blood, and considered curling into a ball right there on the road among hollow cars, until the next signal came and fried my head to putty.

What in God's name had I done to deserve this?

""*Ellie...*""

I didn't believe I'd heard them at first, my ears and head still clearing the pain, but as my composure slowly crawled back, I realised someone was trying to talk to me over the radio.

""*Ellie--you there?*""

Not a gurgle of madness, but a sane, deliberate attempt at communication; still not just a lone voice, but several, concerned dialects - never repeating - of varying ages and tones, taking turns in between statics.

""-*click receiver \[static\] alive--just breathe, girl \[static\] not alone-*""

I jabbed at my radio.

Click.

""-*copy, she hears \[static\] the diner \[static\] equipment--trust-*""

A new voice slid in between them, low and bitter.

""-***you're not going anywhere***\-""

""-*cut them out! \[static\] ignore--scared--not one of us-*""

I forced my thumb down, my voice raw and scratched.

""Who are you? What the fuck is this place?""

""-*pocket \[static\] failed test--caught signal-*"" A child's voice flickered in. ""-*they turned it on, and it never turned off-*"" Then a soft old man. ""*-observatory is unstable*\-"" Then a calm, hurried woman. ""-*held it as long \[static\] can't get up--you can-*""

""What?! Me?! Why, what did I-""

There was a beat of overlapping sharp breaths, pleas and begs; then a gentle, older woman.

""*-sorry, sweetheart \[static\] your car \[static\] radio--a line in \[static\] can't lose-""*

\*""-\****chose you*** *\[static\]* ***lab rat***\-""

A squeal of feedback, then the calm woman again.

""-*reaches further \[static\] every breach \[static\] spreading--understand?*""

Finally, a man.

""-*doctor \[static\] seen it--outside \[static\] right place, right time \[static\] guide you--move, now \[static\] shut it \[static\] free us-*""

The channel fluttered, then steadied into a song of tangled encouragement, praise, and laughs and cries, and faint, drowned-out screams.

""Okay,"" I said, more to myself, seeing no other choice. ""Tell me what to do.""

\-

The closer I got to the diner, the more the streets had been terraformed into a military foothold.

Another Humvee crouched half a block down, choking the roads; cracks inched across its windshield, then retreated, like the glass was deciding whether or not to shatter. Farther along, a gloomy, armoured truck sat with its back doors open. Inside was empty, save for a single dangling headset swinging in still air.

A few steps from the truck, they'd planted a miniature radio tower. It was no taller than me - just a braced mast bolted straight into the earth. At its base, a metal shoebox hummed faintly, LEDs frozen mid-blink.

""*-repeater-*"" a measured, academic voice said over my radio. ""*-node--jam the \[static\] cage-*""

""Didn't work?"" I asked.

""*-not for long-*"" a regretful woman answered.

Beyond it were two tripod rigs, their heads pointed towards the street.

Except the mounts weren't guns.

The closest carried a cluster of speakers - flat, hexagonal panels arranged in a honeycomb, each one mottled with a mesh of tiny holes, ringed with melted plastic. The path directly in front of the speaker array was scorched in a perfect cone, not by heat, but by... absence. There was no grit, no oil stains, just a smooth, blasted-down layer of reality.

The other tripod mounted a lamp. A fat cylinder with cooling fins and nested lenses, tagged with a warning label - UV ONLY. The beam was off, but a faint violet tint clung to the terrain it aimed at.

""*-light--burns \[static\] sound--stuns-*""

""*-****calibre*** *\[static\]* ***severs*** ***the****-*""

The unwelcome voices were diluted out again.

""Who are they?"" I asked, inspecting the tripods. ""The ones you keep shutting up?""

""*-fractured \[static\] dangerous--uncooperative-*""

A low sandbag wall braced the mouth of a nearby alley. Riot shields leaned carelessly along it, their viewports spangled with neat, clustered cracks.

From here, the alley tightened and dead-ended against a brick wall painted with peeling graffiti, but the air above the sandbags bent wrong, like I was looking through a fisheye. I took one cautious step closer and saw, for only an instant, the suggestion of another street cutting across the wall: cars nose-to-ass, a bus shelter, the swarming of civilians, a billboard in a language I couldn't understand.

A second layer of another town, out of alignment.

Then I blinked, and the alley ended with a wall again.

""*-don't go in there-*""

""Yeah, no shit.""

The radio chuckled - a quick, nervous ripple of different laughs.

Ahead, the diner waited.

The windows stuttered worse than the Humvee - intact, webbed, blown out - and the OPEN sign rolled through the wrong sequence - O P N E - before becoming abstract symbols my eyes slid off. It hurt to look at. The foundation was stitched with bullet holes; casings littered the ground - little brass maps charting where soldiers had stood and fired, and fired again, at something that left no trace.

""What were they shooting at?""

My question was met with silence.

Then, the bitter voice - softer now.

""***Us*** *\[static\]* ***not enough***\*-\*""

My hand brushed over my sidearm.

""*-inside, Ellie \[static\] tools-*"" the kind woman urged, ""-*survival*\-""

The bell above the door rang three different times as the smell hit me.

Decay - old, dried out, folded under dust and chemicals, and burnt coffee and fried grease soaked so deeply into the walls. The stuttering was horrid: seats went from cracked red vinyl to bare springs and torn yellow form, then back again; menus flickered in and out of existence, and a jukebox danced between models. Tables had been shoved around a central aisle, their legs braced. Cots crowded the floor - army-issue frames sagging under mattresses, sheets twisted and stained, and a portable generator cowered near the counter, its casing open; wires spilt out like guts, threading through ammo crates and jerry-rigged equipment.

I saw him then.

He sat in the last booth, facing the door. For a moment, I thought he was asleep - chin tucked, shoulders hunched, but the details became apparent.

The soldier was almost a skeleton.

Brittle fatigue clung to him; his uniform stiffened by dust. What skin I could see was like parchment, pulled tight over bone in sunken hollows; his dog tag had fused with his collarbone, the metal nesting in a little crater where his flesh had given up, and his jaw hung loose, teeth bared... a man exhausted from screaming.

His hand still cupped the air near his temple, fingers frozen around a missing pistol, a dark crater in the booth's backrest staining where the bullet had gone - a grainy, pixelated splatter.

My stomach knotted.

Two objects in front of him offered themselves to me.

The first was a flashlight, stubby and industrial with a wide, dark lens ringed with faded warning tape. The other was a compact speaker; one side a grid of tiny holes, the opposite a switch.

A worn voice breathed out on my shoulder.

""-*good man--kind--brave-*""

I cleared my throat. ""Yet he died alone.""

""-*better that than \[static\] lost in--signals-*""

I reached out for the pocket speaker.

""-*careful \[static\] tuned-*"" the academic voice muttered.

""For what?""

They all spoke at once, a tangle of the same answer.

""-*to be louder than them*\-""

I placed both tools in my belt.

Then the soldier's skull tilted, vertebrae creaking, and my heart lurched; hand flying to my sidearm, but it was only my disturbance of the table that moved him. I breathed a sigh of relief and steadied my pulse... when *his* radio came alive, a clunky handset clipped to his waist.

It did not speak; it hissed.

""-***LEAVE IT ON*** *\[static\]* ***GO HOME, GIRL***\*--**YOU'LL KILL US**\-\*""

My own radio crackled in sympathy, and my company interjected, but they were suddenly faint.

""-*Ellie \[static\] focus--don't*\-""

The soldier's radio overpowered them, its volume spiking.

""-***NOT*** *\[static\]* ***THE FIRST PIG*** *\[static\]* ***THEY LIE***\*--**THEY SENT ALL**\-""\* a sobbing child's voice warped through ""-***WE HURT*** *\[static\]* ***DON'T TURN US OFF***\*-""\*

Both radios screamed - a thousand voices mashed together.

""*-ELLIE, GET OUT OF--FEEDBACK--COMING*\--***found you***\--\*try--\*\*\*\*RAM IT, BURN IT--\*\*\**speaker--****kill your radio****--****KILL YOURSELF****--don't touch*\--*not whole anymore--angry--****STILL HERE****--****STILL FEEL****-""*

It was a thrash of sound - threats, pleas, curses, prayers, all ground together - that ached my head. I didn't hesitate. I reached for the portable speaker, flipped the switch, and my world tunnelled as it squealed a deafening wail. The generator hiccupped, the overhead lights burned and burst, the jukebox lit up and spun through songs too fast, and the dead soldier's radio cut off as his body slumped forward.

Then there was only silence as I found myself alone in a dark diner, the speaker hot against my waist.

My own radio crackled twice, confused.

""*-Ellie?!*""

Then it too failed.

And for the first time, Swallow Coast was truly quiet.

The diner's own sounds quickly crept out like insects: the creaks of booths adjusting to no weight, a slow, patient drip from somewhere in the kitchen, the soft, intermittent hum of the neon sign outside. Breath left my lungs in slippery, shaky exhales, as I fidgeted with my radio - not willing to accept this loneliness as permanent.

*Ding*.

The bell above the front door chimed.

Once. Perfectly.

*Ding.*

Again.

The door didn't move, but the sound was thicker this time - as if underwater. The air near the entrance wobbled, just a fraction, as I drew my gun and the flashlight.

*Ding.*

The doorframe trembled in place, smearing sideways in short, nauseating skips, then bulged and rippled and flattened, and *something* pressed through it.

Familiar broken nonsense reached me first.

""*-don't touch that dial, we'll be right with you \[flatline\] you're about to start \[phone dial\] one woman, one night, lost her friends \[Windows Startup\] coming up: a local officer goes \[sirens\]* ***skinned and flayed***\*-\*""

The idea of a man began to materialise, cobbled together from a disjointed static mass of flickering grey fuzz; his chest strobed between suits, hoodies, bare skin, hospital gowns, and his face was layers upon layers over a vertical slack - an old man's profile, a child's wide eyes, a woman's gaping mouth mid-scream, a teenager chewing gum. They swam through one another, never syncing, each countless expression trying to dominate the other; far too many crammed into the same outline.

Every time he moved, pieces of him lagged behind at different frame-rates or spasmed into mundane tasks, as a radio snow flaked off his edges, popping and disintegrating into nothing. He stepped into the diner (if you could call it that), tearing out of the door, the sounds of his feet were complex, dry keyboard clicks dubbed over with car doors, gunshots, soda cans, and a microphone. The air bent around him, violating the space into an elongated, glitching funhouse.

Then he looked at me, and all the mouths in his head smiled.

""-*anomaly. found-*""

On intuition, my thumb pressed the taped switch on the flashlight, and a solid, bruise-dark violet bar erupted and hit the 'man' square in the chest. The result was instant. Touched by the light, the static went from grey to a blistering, overexposed white and orange - then burned brighter than the sun. Pieces of mismatched people peeled back like melting film, bubbling out of existence, as a dozen borrowed eyes flared and scowled.

A film-trailer voice gulped mid-sentence, dropping a few octaves, and a jingle stretched into a thin, digital scream as the air around it pulsed back several inches toward normal. The creature staggered, raising its jittery, convulsive arms to shield itself; the mosaic of broadcast it used as skin blackened where the beam stayed, edges crisping and curling, as it *roared* \- a remix of half-sponsored messages and corrupted sound bites scratching in my ears.

It tried to advance, lugging a step towards me, so I fired.

The bullet hit where the UV light had already cooked its form, right in a raw patch of boiling static, but instead of a clean entry wound, reality tore as its flesh blew open in a geyser of white noise. I saw inside it: frames of other places, hallways, headlights, an operating table, someone's bedroom - swirling past the hole in a blur. The bullet cut through them all, dragging a comet-tail of glitch with it, as the creature convulsed. Every piece of it slipped further out of sync; faces morphed into a screaming collage, several arms twitched in delayed directions, its outline ballooned, as a bomb of sound erupted from it - hurling me off my feet and into a table.

Its body blew outward like a grenade. Static detonated into a jagged sphere, shredding through tile and chrome and glass, as half the diner's wall ceased to be - ripped out of space.

Then it fled onto the street - a teleporting, slithering mass of pained static - before vanishing into the night, leaving a brief, untextured trail of vertigo-inducing grey in its wake.

The OPEN sign outside flashed a new word in between blinks, letters stuttering into place where they didn't belong.

'LIVE'

I stumbled outside, head and heart pounding, and leaned on a car that wasn't quite there.

Six months on the force, I had my first domestic.

Second floor of a shitty apartment, end of the hall, number already flagged for 'prior incidents'. Neighbours had reported shouting and a crying kid, so Dispatch tossed me over. A young woman met me at the door, red-eyed with a polite smile that didn't match her shaking hands.

'He' hovered in the kitchen.

No damage, nothing broken, no visible injuries, no kid; just a raised voice and overreacting neighbours.

My gut whispered that it wasn't nothing - the way she glanced at him before every answer. But policy pays no mind to 'gut feelings'. I took their statements, handed over a pamphlet, told her she could call us anytime, and I went home to a warm bed.

But then I went back.

Again.

And again.

*And again*.

Different days, same apartment, same rushed apology; same look in her eyes, same break in her voice. Yet every time, *every time*, things looked just calm enough to walk away from.

The last callout was quiet. No shouts, no cries; the neighbours said the silence concerned them more. The TV was still on when I entered.

She was on the couch, eyes raw, long gone from this world.

While He hung in the bedroom with blood on his hands.

I did everything by the book on that one. Got told it wasn't my fault, but I knew better. I'd walked away from that mangy little home plenty of times when my instincts told me not to. So when a radio asked for help from nowhere, from a place that didn't exist, I knew my mind would've been made up.

Atonement, maybe.

I think that's why I saw her little face amidst a gunshot wound of white noise and broken static. Not angry or sad, merely... watching. Judging.

Wondering if I'd run away again.

The second **rip** came without mercy.

The observatory didn't only shake this time - it imploded. Invisible, folding billows sped down the mountain like shockwaves, crashing through the forest and impacting the street, splintering everything they touched, breaking structures apart and rebuilding them in the span of thoughts. I watched people spawn in and out in different styles, from various decades; kids on bikes, soldiers in masks, tourists with cameras, walking through each other, through me, through anything that was or wasn't there.

Then I saw myself.

A multitude of Ellies, scattered through the maddening mess, with torn uniforms and guns drawn or not even a cop at all, running for their lives, praying on their knees, walking their dogs, staring up at the sky, and the waves kept coming; time and space buckled, reformed, then buckled again, as my insides began to crawl out of my body.

I thought this would be my end, lost in a paradoxical typhoon - reduced to an unexplainable phenomenon - but then, somewhere inside the chaos, the worst of it calmed, and my radio spat out a ragged word.

""-*climb*\-""

My ghosts had returned; a familiar, comforting patchwork of timid, exhausted voices.

""-*mountain path \[static\] with you--brace \[static\] up*\-""

\-

Astronauts describe walking on the moon as a mix of 'magnificent desolation', with stark beauty and intense light, but also a sense of indescribable wonder and adventure - a trampoline bounce in low gravity, as Earth hangs in a jet-black, starless sky.

I wondered how such trained, privileged adventurers would describe wading through Hell, as my first step onto the gravel-caked, rotting wood landed seconds before I did, the ground buffering under my weight. The path ascended fast, shouldering into the trees; a nervy strip of nature that couldn't settle, while the leaking observatory hung above it like a bad omen.

Out here, the equipment was different.

Instead of jammers and tripods, the hardware along the path had been built as a fence. Short pylons stood in rows on either side of the trail, no higher than my hip, drilled straight into the roots. Between them, lines of invisible pressure danced in the air, catching the moonlight in wrong ways.

UV lamps the size of flares were cradled in the metal, their light pointed not at the town, but out into the trees; burning clean wedges of bleached bark. Cinderblock speakers squatted between the lamps, their faces singing in frozen sound.

There was a thick grain of slow-moving static just beyond the barrier. Shapes heaved just past the reach of the light, packed shoulder-to-shoulder along the mountainside: loose silhouettes, glitching outlines, people and not-people slow as sleep. Blank faces drifted in and out of the gloom - dozens, maybe hundreds.

Every few meters, a pylon pulsed weakly, and the nearest shape flinched, restrained under some pressure I couldn't see or feel, but *hear*.

A containment of light and sound, wrapped around the path and beyond.

But it wasn't perfect.

At the very start of the trail, two pylons had been dragged just enough out of alignment - their cables snagged, their housings cracked. Between them, the air sagged, and the invisible pressure caved inward. Occasionally, a fleeting crack would appear, and a grey hand would slither out, flickering between nails, metal, and bone. It clawed at the gap, pushing through, when the nearest UV canister coughed out what strength it had and blistered the hand into white-hot confetti.

The crack would seal, temporarily.

I understood how one of them could've escaped.

My radio gave the softest click.

""*-walk quiet--trench line-*""

Soon, I stopped just short of the observatory, in a car park of grand, curated scientific study sprawled with white tents and MOCs - their terminals still running.

Up close, the building was disappointingly ordinary. It was never the problem.

Every instrument they had up here, every setup, their endless arsenal of gadgets, faced the mountain - hooked up with cables and sensors, like a giant patient in need of surgery.

What they monitored was not a shape, but a wound in geometry - an impossible prism of light moulded into the granite; blooming edges of colourless bursts, a radiant malfunction of stuttering angles, and vibrating in horrid, wiggling wretches, blasting out waves of energy that spilt into the town below.

""*-woken--vessel* *\[static\] you see \[static\] crashed--stuck*\-""

""How do I turn it-""

""-***we remember you***\-""

The others made no attempt to silence their fractured comrades, who then spoke with unrivalled clarity.

""*You shot them. Bold. Most get scared*.""

""What're-""

""*All of them. Every wave. Look*.""

My eyes glazed over the protruding vessel.

It shimmered, in perfect sync, with every word.

""*People do not belong in here. Release them*.""

A myriad of colours oozed from its hull as it tried to phase out of the rock. A bastion of obelisks amidst the ground, the first line of defence wired to the MOCs, matched its rainbow display in tandem.

""... how?""

""*One of the terminals. Shut it down. All of it. Please*.""

Before I could move, a gabble of noise stumbled up the path behind me, replacing the cadence of commercials and cartoons with clipped military channels.

""-*Alpha to F.O.B \[Beep\] field log corrupted, retrying \[Buzz\] do you have any idea what they're doing up \[static\]*\-""

My boots skidded as I bolted to the nearest terminal. I slapped keys and snapped a cursor through unreadable fields and thermals until a green menu stared back.

\> NODE: OBSERVATORY

\> STATUS: UNSTABLE

\> COMMAND: \_ \_ \_

""*End.*"" Said my radio.

""What?!""

""*Command. End*.""

I glanced over my shoulder at the rippling air and oncoming chatter as the thing took shape. It had changed uniforms, shifting through combat gear and lab coats, then blue hazmat suits and armour.

""-*hey! who's there?! \[static\] are we authorised for this \[static\] greatest breakthrough of our species, and you wanna get cold feet \[static\] subject: persistent-correction required*""

\> COMMAND: END

I nearly slammed it in.

And the world popped.

For a breath, there was no sound - only a pressure change. Then, every electronic in sight croaked dead at once. The speaker on my belt sparked and flung itself off, dissolving. My flashlight exploded, ripping through my flesh with jagged pieces and a violet burst, falling me to one knee with a yelp.

Then the mountain screamed.

The 'vessel' flared and ripped itself free, tearing the stone like it was wet paper. Granite peeled and crumbled, scaffolding and cables snapped, trucks flipped several feet into the air and phased through the ground. The prism wrenched itself out in a spray of dust and broken light, took a single, staggered look at its reeling saviour, and then, in a single jump... it was gone, a streak vanishing straight into the sky.

From the veil I had driven through, a quake detonated - a rupture rolling in on itself like a sheet, becoming a towering wall of static-white, reaching the clouds, that erased everything it touched as it volleyed towards us.

*Us*.

The pain in my leg had distracted me enough to not realise the static man was still here, still advancing.

""-*final state pending \[static\] final state pending \[static\] final*\-""

I drew my pistol and emptied every bullet, but without the UV light, it was like shooting a fog. Round after round pinged through its body, absorbed by glimpses of rooms, of other skies, and it kept coming; now devoid of any features remotely human.

I reloaded with shaking, bloody hands and fired again until my gun clicked.

The encroaching white wall swallowed the base of the path, then the observatory, as the entity reached for me, its many hands smearing into my face as a glow washed over its shoulders... and I closed my eyes.

The wall took us in a single, enveloping surge.

Then there was nothing at all.

\-

""Ellie?""

I knew his voice; he sounded amused.

""You still with us, kid?""

I opened my eyes to find myself on a stretcher, a paramedic tending the bandages around my leg, and a wrinkled hand in front of me snapping his fingers.

""Helloooo? Earth to Ellie?""

I was still at the observatory; military equipment had been replaced with a police presence and some suspicious vans, their open doors revealing cargoes of narcotics. Punks were slammed onto the hoods of cruisers, cuffed, and shoved into back seats.

An older, grizzled cop looked down at me, one arm in a sling.

""I... what?"" I stammered out.

""Did she hit her head?"" He asked the paramedic, and I knew then where I'd heard him before -  an officer who radioed a 10-33.

""She lost a bit of blood, that's all. Give her a minute.""

Behind them, a news crew assembled. A redhead reporter chucked away her cigarette and rustled her hair as her cameraman counted her down.

""Are we ready? Cool-We are here LIVE from Swallow Coast where it seems a brave batch of officers have made history in one of the largest drug busts Oregon has ever known-""

I drowned her out, rubbing my temples.

Marcus was his name, who insisted on escorting me back to my car despite my demand to be alone. Every step, I felt sick. I expected the sky to tweak, or a shadow to lag behind me - *something* leftover.

Instead, Swallow Coast looked like any other town.

The diner wore a fresh coat of paint and boasted a health-inspected 'A' in the window. A teenager replaced a dead soldier in the end booth, wiping down tables, earbuds in; the only radio noise was a pop station whining about breakups and summer love.

If I tried hard enough, I could almost convince myself that I'd hallucinated the whole thing.

Blood loss from shrapnel?

Stress?

Almost.

Until a select few sounds hit my ears the wrong way, my newfound tubby friend paying no mind to my tiny flinches. Eventually, we reached my cruiser - still 'parked' at the edge of town, where a friendly mechanic fiddled inside the hood, finalising his work, overlooked by an old cell tower.

""How's she looking?!"" Marcus barked.

He looked at me. ""Ah, she'll drive, but your precinct needs to upgrade your wheels. This thing's a fucking relic.""

""I'll keep it in mind,"" I said, suddenly very eager to drive far, far away from this place.

But Marcus wouldn't allow that, oh no - not until he'd said goodbye. He watched me slide into my driver’s seat before planting himself in the doorway, leaning nonchalantly on the roof.

""You sure you're okay?""

""Yeah, fine.""

""If you say so, hero. And don't worry,"" he winked, ""I'm gonna be putting in a good word with your chief-oh, hold on-"" his hand flicked over my shoulder, ""-huh... your radio was off. Weird.""

""Ha, yeah... *weird*.""

""Well, drive safe. And if I ever need backup again, I'm asking for you personally."" He chuckled and made his leave with a hefty wave.

I waited until his shape was gone before shrivelling and collapsing into my seat, my hand snapping over my throbbing chest. Tears welled up fast and I sobbed and fitted like a toddler, until my radio spoke, and I almost shrieked.

""You're back on the system, 3-Adam-12! We thought we lost you! What happened?!""

I composed myself quickly, wiping my face.

""Uh... my car, um-... broke, Dispatch.""

""... broke?""

""That's right.""

""Okay... I'll make a note of that. Anything else to report?""

""No, Dispatch. Say, do you-""

""Hold on, 3-Adam-12-"" her attention was taken away ""-right, we've got a domestic the next town over, all local units are busy. Feeling up for it?""

I'd barely caught my own breath as I looked out at the sunrise.

It was unlike any I'd seen.

""I... yeah..."" I rallied myself. ""Show me en route.""",1,1767340268.0,stories,0,1.0,False

But my night was only beginning.

The dash radio didn't just crackle to life - it sputtered in jumbled, inaudible pieces. I assumed the worn-down piece of shit was broken as I flicked away my butt and slogged back to the door, but I barely had time to sit down when a man's voice slipped through the garbled static.

""*10-33, all units! \[static\] 10-33, all units, please, I'm-*"" Something was wrong with his voice. Each burst of static carried a different version of the same man; layered, varied tones out of sync.

""*Swallow Coast is \[static\] Swallow Coast is gone--Swallow Coast is... wrong \[static\]* *PLEASE, MY*\-""

The voices then stumbled together into a single, dead tone and repeated the same phrase over and over.

""*help us*""

Then it broke apart again, overlapping into a shattered mess of protocol codes, before cutting off to a null silence. My hand was halfway to the volume knob, trembling; I'd heard panicked officers be shot at before, fighting to speak, but never had I heard *anything* like that.

A glitch? A ghost? A dream? My mind raced down every avenue, but a single ugly detail kept pecking at my brain.

'Swallow Coast'

Training kicked in.

""Dispatch, 3-Adam-12,"" I said, my voice sounding far steadier than I felt. ""Copy an unknown 10-33 that just came over my in-car. Unidentified officer, no call sign, giving location as 'Swallow Coast.'""

I stared out at the empty road.

""Be advised,"" I added, forcing the words out, ""I don't show a 'Swallow Coast' on any local grids. Can you run a trace on the transmission?""

I released the button, and the radio went back to dead air.

""3-Adam-12, Dispatch here."" Her voice was calm, but there was a hesitance to it. ""We've got a hit.""

""Go ahead, Dispatch.""

""Signal's bouncing off the east repeater, origin somewhere off County Road 17, past marker 22."" Papers rustled faintly on her end. ""Be advised that stretch is... it just *ends* out there.""

I squinted through the windshield, trying to picture it.

I'd patrolled that road a hundred times.

""Dispatch, confirm. You're telling me an emergency call came from the middle of nowhere?""

""Affirmative. How do you want to proceed?""

I glanced at the black stretch of highway disappearing into the trees, and took a deep breath.

""Dispatch, show me en route.""

I flipped on my lights and pulled back onto the tar, my headlights carving a narrow tunnel through the ensemble of timber. The silence became a pressure; the radio a faint, constant open breath as I ran the familiar stretch.

""Dispatch, 3-Adam-12,"" I said, ""Confirm last known origin was off 17, past marker 22.""

""Affirmative. You should be the only thing moving out there.""

The terrain began to climb; the highway curled along the flank of a mountain in long, sweeping turns where only a guardrail stood between me and a steep drop. When the trees broke, I caught glimpses of it - the pale smear of the heaving Pacific.

By 21, the air had turned damp and cold, seeping in through the vents. My GPS started to lag - a little car sliding over green nothing. I frowned, tapping the casing with a knuckle, when the weather-beaten marker 22 lurched out of the shadows.

I parked beside it.

Fifty yards past the marker, veering off the road and into the wild on a narrowing, overgrown trail, the path, as described, stopped.

A hard, abrupt gravel edge.

""Dispatch, be advised. I've arrived at origin-""

The speaker exploded into unrelenting noise.

Not static, not feedback - voices; a hundred of them at once, slamming into my ears. Snatches of jingles, movie lines, sitcom laughs, news anchors, late-night preachers, kids shouting over commercials, pop songs, intimate phone calls; every recorded sound I'd ever heard stacked on top of each other, out of tune.

Out of time.

""-*copy that, over and out--he's looking at you, kid--baby, don't hurt me, don't--breaking news tonight as officials--wake up, she's here*.""

""Dispatch?!"" I snapped, one hand clamped on the mic, the other white-knuckled around the wheel. ""Dispatch, I'm experiencing a malfunction! Do you copy?!""

""*-late night deals you won't believe--please, if anyone is there--this is not a test, this is an emergency broadcast*\-""

Something thudded softly under my foot.

The brake pedal sank half an inch.

I hadn't moved my leg.

""No...""

I stomped down, hard. The pedal met resistance - then, bit by bit, pushed back against me.

The gear lever clicked.

PARK - REVERSE - DRIVE

""Dispatch, I-""

""-*we now return to your feature presentation*\-""

The cruiser began to roll. Slow at first, just a whisper over the gravel as I slammed my foot on the brakes, and it shrugged me off.

The wheel didn't budge either as the car aligned with the void ahead.

I twisted the key out!

Nothing!

A canned studio audience roared out from the radio, drowning out a weatherman promising clear skies and a man's ragged voice yelling, ""*They cut the road, they CUT THE ROAD-*""

I grabbed for the seatbelt, and the latch clicked, but the strap wouldn't release - remaining locked across my chest.

I hit the door handle, but it bounced against the damn frame.

""Come on!"" I spat, slamming my shoulder into it. Fruitless.

The car rolled on, patient and unbothered by my efforts.

A hoarse male voice cut through the layers.

""*Please-if anyone-I've got a daughter in*\-""

Static chewed him up and vomited him back out as a game show buzzer.

""-*wrong answer, but thanks for playing*\-""

""Stop,"" I murmured, my nerves becoming shot.

Far ahead, at the very end of the light, something began to take shape. It was a dense patch of shimmering thin white; a near-transparent wall where empty air should've been.

Fog, I told myself. Except fog didn't sit flat.

Forty yards.

The wall resolved into a smooth sheet of glitching white-and-black, texture-less, depthless static. And beyond it - for just an instant - I thought I saw the orange smear of streetlights.

""-*you are now entering--the following film contains--they said the sky was wrong--don't touch that dial, you're gonna get us all*\-"" The radio begged, pleaded, sold me detergent, laughed at its own jokes, as the distance between bumper and curtain shrank.

Thirty yards.

Twenty.

""Stop the fucking car!"" I yelled, losing all professionalism as I hammered the windows and wheel, the horn blaring weakly amidst the radio's storm.

""-*ma'am, you need to remain calm*\-""

""SHUT THE FUCK UP!""

The glitching veil loomed in, filling the windshield with nothing I had a word for. I clawed at the seatbelt, desperate - jump out, climb out, do something, anything, but go through whatever that was, yet my fate was inevitable.

So I did all I had left.

I squeezed my eyes shut and braced.

And the car rolled in.

All sense of direction vanished; the seat fell away under me, then jumped back up, and my body felt like it'd plummeted through an ice sheet beyond physics.

Every voice on the radio hit a single, piercing note.

Then silence - a quick, surgical cut into the noise.

My ears popped as the world slid back in, the car coming to a stop, and after I realised I was still breathing, I slowly forced my eyes open.

The dead-end road was gone. In its place was a wide, slick street glistening with rain; lined with buildings, flickering neon, and a diner with a crooked 'OPEN' sign. A distant pier lamp swung over black water, and, carving its way up a mountain path, was a brass-and-steel observatory gazing at the stars.

On one corner, a street sign hung from a rusted pole.

'Swallow Coast'

I finally got my hands to move and reached for the gear shift, expecting the same resistance. It moved willingly, but the engine was dead; as was my radio. I was, however, able to free myself from the seatbelt and sprang out of my powerless cruiser, feeling sick and cold on wobbling legs.

A pickup truck stalked behind a pale sedan, headlights still faint, like they were running on memory. A hatchback rested at an angle to the curb, its front tyre up on the sidewalk, attempting to flee. Closer, a cruiser from a foreign department nosed into the intersection - its pattern like mine, but the crest on the door was smudged, like vandalised paint.

They were empty. Forgotten.

""Dispatch? Are you there?""

...

I walked towards a military Humvee, hunched closer to the diner, olive metal dulled by grime. A faded stencil on the door spelt 'U.S Army', but the unit markings beneath were the same as the cruiser. The passenger door hung open.

I peered in.

No gear, no duffels, no guns; just seats, and the impression that its occupants simply evaporated. The sedan had a purse on the driver's seat, its contents scattered: a wallet, receipts, a cracked phone frozen on a family photo, the seatbelt slack and twisted, the engine cold.

I turned back the way I'd come, towards where the road should've cut.

Instead, the street sloped gently upward until it met a structure that did not belong here. At first, I mistook it for a cell tower, but it was a makeshift lattice of metal and cables - antennas speared out; dish arrays, spiralled coils, panels that hummed faintly with colour. Wires as thick as my arm ran down into a fenced-off outpost bristling with control boxes and blinking lights.

I had to crane my neck to see the beacon at the peak - a red light flashing randomly.

Behind the tower, barely, hung the 'thing' I'd driven through.

From this side, the veil was much thinner. Instead of a static wall, it was more like distorted glass - a wavering, curving slice of sky that didn't fit.

More vehicles sat at the base, facing the shimmer; unquestionably military, rusting and rotten, all pointed at the same impossible curtain.

The tower then hummed as if waking up, and my radio sparked to life - coughing out a single, wailing tone that stung my ears and rattled my teeth.

I didn't notice it immediately, only catching the structure in the corner of my eye as my head pounded, but up in the mountain, the observatory *shivered*.

From the street, it looked textbook - a crown perched atop the rocks with domes and spires winking like old coins, highlighted by either its own gleaming light or what they caught from the stars.

Yet under the signal's pressure, the whole building shook.

Then the first **rip** happened.

The observatory spasmed and snapped, as if a cursor were trying to drag it across a screen; it remained in place, defiantly, but it became distorted, as if shifted through eras. For a blink, the glass was cracked and dark, the brass tarnished, and entire sections hung loose, like something blew it up from inside.

My radio climbed another notch, drilling through my jaw and violating my skull.

The observatory jerked again - now under construction.

Floodlights bleached the mountain path, support beams and half-built walls cast shadows across the rocks; domes became webs of hollow steel, and cranes hung over the whole scene, jittering and flickering as the sky seized from night to day to night again. I could almost hear construction noises - shouted instructions, the clatter of tools, the whistling of men.

I fell to my hands and knees, a trickle of blood oozing from my nose.

Everything was vibrating.

The observatory stuttered once more. It burned.

Orange triumphed inside the central dome; flames beat metal, smoke rolled up in a thick column, but didn't behave right - freezing, lagging. Something within it pulsed white-hot, brighter than any heat I'd ever seen, as my vision blurred, and the road under me melted, then hardened, becoming dirt and snow and magma. I tasted metal in the deepest recesses of my throat as my radio reached a pitch I didn't think was possible.

The observatory tore a final time, but not just the building.

The sky above split open.

A hairline crack at first - a tiny, jagged, thin line - that widened in wild jumps, tearing and stopping, until a gaping wound hung over the mountain.

A scar of colourless deep, where stars were packed far too close together - undiscovered by any astronomer.

They didn't twinkle like jewels. They blinked like eyes.

A pungent waft of burnt electricity rolled down the mountain and filled the street, as my radio became another chorus of relentless sound.

""-*entrance. logged*\--*all units, hold the line, do not approach--test the alert, damn it--alpha, requesting permission to--swiper no swiping--praise be, brothers and sisters--pay separate shipping and handling--if you or a loved one has been diagnosed with cancer--observatory team, do you copy--what the FUCK IS THAT THING--top 10 cartoon themes, number 3 will--this message will repeat--he's still in there--side effects may include dizziness, nausea, loss of self, existential dread--what have you done, boy*\-*-we are here LIVE from Swallow Coast where it seems a-*""

The radio cut out, damning me into another empty silence as the ripping of space stopped, my vision returned through harsh blinks, and the observatory clicked back to normalcy. I scrubbed trembling hands over my nose and lips, wiping away blood, and considered curling into a ball right there on the road among hollow cars, until the next signal came and fried my head to putty.

What in God's name had I done to deserve this?

""*Ellie...*""

I didn't believe I'd heard them at first, my ears and head still clearing the pain, but as my composure slowly crawled back, I realised someone was trying to talk to me over the radio.

""*Ellie--you there?*""

Not a gurgle of madness, but a sane, deliberate attempt at communication; still not just a lone voice, but several, concerned dialects - never repeating - of varying ages and tones, taking turns in between statics.

""-*click receiver \[static\] alive--just breathe, girl \[static\] not alone-*""

I jabbed at my radio.

Click.

""-*copy, she hears \[static\] the diner \[static\] equipment--trust-*""

A new voice slid in between them, low and bitter.

""-***you're not going anywhere***\-""

""-*cut them out! \[static\] ignore--scared--not one of us-*""

I forced my thumb down, my voice raw and scratched.

""Who are you? What the fuck is this place?""

""-*pocket \[static\] failed test--caught signal-*"" A child's voice flickered in. ""-*they turned it on, and it never turned off-*"" Then a soft old man. ""*-observatory is unstable*\-"" Then a calm, hurried woman. ""-*held it as long \[static\] can't get up--you can-*""

""What?! Me?! Why, what did I-""

There was a beat of overlapping sharp breaths, pleas and begs; then a gentle, older woman.

""*-sorry, sweetheart \[static\] your car \[static\] radio--a line in \[static\] can't lose-""*

\*""-\****chose you*** *\[static\]* ***lab rat***\-""

A squeal of feedback, then the calm woman again.

""-*reaches further \[static\] every breach \[static\] spreading--understand?*""

Finally, a man.

""-*doctor \[static\] seen it--outside \[static\] right place, right time \[static\] guide you--move, now \[static\] shut it \[static\] free us-*""

The channel fluttered, then steadied into a song of tangled encouragement, praise, and laughs and cries, and faint, drowned-out screams.

""Okay,"" I said, more to myself, seeing no other choice. ""Tell me what to do.""

\-

The closer I got to the diner, the more the streets had been terraformed into a military foothold.

Another Humvee crouched half a block down, choking the roads; cracks inched across its windshield, then retreated, like the glass was deciding whether or not to shatter. Farther along, a gloomy, armoured truck sat with its back doors open. Inside was empty, save for a single dangling headset swinging in still air.

A few steps from the truck, they'd planted a miniature radio tower. It was no taller than me - just a braced mast bolted straight into the earth. At its base, a metal shoebox hummed faintly, LEDs frozen mid-blink.

""*-repeater-*"" a measured, academic voice said over my radio. ""*-node--jam the \[static\] cage-*""

""Didn't work?"" I asked.

""*-not for long-*"" a regretful woman answered.

Beyond it were two tripod rigs, their heads pointed towards the street.

Except the mounts weren't guns.

The closest carried a cluster of speakers - flat, hexagonal panels arranged in a honeycomb, each one mottled with a mesh of tiny holes, ringed with melted plastic. The path directly in front of the speaker array was scorched in a perfect cone, not by heat, but by... absence. There was no grit, no oil stains, just a smooth, blasted-down layer of reality.

The other tripod mounted a lamp. A fat cylinder with cooling fins and nested lenses, tagged with a warning label - UV ONLY. The beam was off, but a faint violet tint clung to the terrain it aimed at.

""*-light--burns \[static\] sound--stuns-*""

""*-****calibre*** *\[static\]* ***severs*** ***the****-*""

The unwelcome voices were diluted out again.

""Who are they?"" I asked, inspecting the tripods. ""The ones you keep shutting up?""

""*-fractured \[static\] dangerous--uncooperative-*""

A low sandbag wall braced the mouth of a nearby alley. Riot shields leaned carelessly along it, their viewports spangled with neat, clustered cracks.

From here, the alley tightened and dead-ended against a brick wall painted with peeling graffiti, but the air above the sandbags bent wrong, like I was looking through a fisheye. I took one cautious step closer and saw, for only an instant, the suggestion of another street cutting across the wall: cars nose-to-ass, a bus shelter, the swarming of civilians, a billboard in a language I couldn't understand.

A second layer of another town, out of alignment.

Then I blinked, and the alley ended with a wall again.

""*-don't go in there-*""

""Yeah, no shit.""

The radio chuckled - a quick, nervous ripple of different laughs.

Ahead, the diner waited.

The windows stuttered worse than the Humvee - intact, webbed, blown out - and the OPEN sign rolled through the wrong sequence - O P N E - before becoming abstract symbols my eyes slid off. It hurt to look at. The foundation was stitched with bullet holes; casings littered the ground - little brass maps charting where soldiers had stood and fired, and fired again, at something that left no trace.

""What were they shooting at?""

My question was met with silence.

Then, the bitter voice - softer now.

""***Us*** *\[static\]* ***not enough***\*-\*""

My hand brushed over my sidearm.

""*-inside, Ellie \[static\] tools-*"" the kind woman urged, ""-*survival*\-""

The bell above the door rang three different times as the smell hit me.

Decay - old, dried out, folded under dust and chemicals, and burnt coffee and fried grease soaked so deeply into the walls. The stuttering was horrid: seats went from cracked red vinyl to bare springs and torn yellow form, then back again; menus flickered in and out of existence, and a jukebox danced between models. Tables had been shoved around a central aisle, their legs braced. Cots crowded the floor - army-issue frames sagging under mattresses, sheets twisted and stained, and a portable generator cowered near the counter, its casing open; wires spilt out like guts, threading through ammo crates and jerry-rigged equipment.

I saw him then.

He sat in the last booth, facing the door. For a moment, I thought he was asleep - chin tucked, shoulders hunched, but the details became apparent.

The soldier was almost a skeleton.

Brittle fatigue clung to him; his uniform stiffened by dust. What skin I could see was like parchment, pulled tight over bone in sunken hollows; his dog tag had fused with his collarbone, the metal nesting in a little crater where his flesh had given up, and his jaw hung loose, teeth bared... a man exhausted from screaming.

His hand still cupped the air near his temple, fingers frozen around a missing pistol, a dark crater in the booth's backrest staining where the bullet had gone - a grainy, pixelated splatter.

My stomach knotted.

Two objects in front of him offered themselves to me.

The first was a flashlight, stubby and industrial with a wide, dark lens ringed with faded warning tape. The other was a compact speaker; one side a grid of tiny holes, the opposite a switch.

A worn voice breathed out on my shoulder.

""-*good man--kind--brave-*""

I cleared my throat. ""Yet he died alone.""

""-*better that than \[static\] lost in--signals-*""

I reached out for the pocket speaker.

""-*careful \[static\] tuned-*"" the academic voice muttered.

""For what?""

They all spoke at once, a tangle of the same answer.

""-*to be louder than them*\-""

I placed both tools in my belt.

Then the soldier's skull tilted, vertebrae creaking, and my heart lurched; hand flying to my sidearm, but it was only my disturbance of the table that moved him. I breathed a sigh of relief and steadied my pulse... when *his* radio came alive, a clunky handset clipped to his waist.

It did not speak; it hissed.

""-***LEAVE IT ON*** *\[static\]* ***GO HOME, GIRL***\*--**YOU'LL KILL US**\-\*""

My own radio crackled in sympathy, and my company interjected, but they were suddenly faint.

""-*Ellie \[static\] focus--don't*\-""

The soldier's radio overpowered them, its volume spiking.

""-***NOT*** *\[static\]* ***THE FIRST PIG*** *\[static\]* ***THEY LIE***\*--**THEY SENT ALL**\-""\* a sobbing child's voice warped through ""-***WE HURT*** *\[static\]* ***DON'T TURN US OFF***\*-""\*

Both radios screamed - a thousand voices mashed together.

""*-ELLIE, GET OUT OF--FEEDBACK--COMING*\--***found you***\--\*try--\*\*\*\*RAM IT, BURN IT--\*\*\**speaker--****kill your radio****--****KILL YOURSELF****--don't touch*\--*not whole anymore--angry--****STILL HERE****--****STILL FEEL****-""*

It was a thrash of sound - threats, pleas, curses, prayers, all ground together - that ached my head. I didn't hesitate. I reached for the portable speaker, flipped the switch, and my world tunnelled as it squealed a deafening wail. The generator hiccupped, the overhead lights burned and burst, the jukebox lit up and spun through songs too fast, and the dead soldier's radio cut off as his body slumped forward.

Then there was only silence as I found myself alone in a dark diner, the speaker hot against my waist.

My own radio crackled twice, confused.

""*-Ellie?!*""

Then it too failed.

And for the first time, Swallow Coast was truly quiet.

The diner's own sounds quickly crept out like insects: the creaks of booths adjusting to no weight, a slow, patient drip from somewhere in the kitchen, the soft, intermittent hum of the neon sign outside. Breath left my lungs in slippery, shaky exhales, as I fidgeted with my radio - not willing to accept this loneliness as permanent.

*Ding*.

The bell above the front door chimed.

Once. Perfectly.

*Ding.*

Again.

The door didn't move, but the sound was thicker this time - as if underwater. The air near the entrance wobbled, just a fraction, as I drew my gun and the flashlight.

*Ding.*

The doorframe trembled in place, smearing sideways in short, nauseating skips, then bulged and rippled and flattened, and *something* pressed through it.

Familiar broken nonsense reached me first.

""*-don't touch that dial, we'll be right with you \[flatline\] you're about to start \[phone dial\] one woman, one night, lost her friends \[Windows Startup\] coming up: a local officer goes \[sirens\]* ***skinned and flayed***\*-\*""

The idea of a man began to materialise, cobbled together from a disjointed static mass of flickering grey fuzz; his chest strobed between suits, hoodies, bare skin, hospital gowns, and his face was layers upon layers over a vertical slack - an old man's profile, a child's wide eyes, a woman's gaping mouth mid-scream, a teenager chewing gum. They swam through one another, never syncing, each countless expression trying to dominate the other; far too many crammed into the same outline.

Every time he moved, pieces of him lagged behind at different frame-rates or spasmed into mundane tasks, as a radio snow flaked off his edges, popping and disintegrating into nothing. He stepped into the diner (if you could call it that), tearing out of the door, the sounds of his feet were complex, dry keyboard clicks dubbed over with car doors, gunshots, soda cans, and a microphone. The air bent around him, violating the space into an elongated, glitching funhouse.

Then he looked at me, and all the mouths in his head smiled.

""-*anomaly. found-*""

On intuition, my thumb pressed the taped switch on the flashlight, and a solid, bruise-dark violet bar erupted and hit the 'man' square in the chest. The result was instant. Touched by the light, the static went from grey to a blistering, overexposed white and orange - then burned brighter than the sun. Pieces of mismatched people peeled back like melting film, bubbling out of existence, as a dozen borrowed eyes flared and scowled.

A film-trailer voice gulped mid-sentence, dropping a few octaves, and a jingle stretched into a thin, digital scream as the air around it pulsed back several inches toward normal. The creature staggered, raising its jittery, convulsive arms to shield itself; the mosaic of broadcast it used as skin blackened where the beam stayed, edges crisping and curling, as it *roared* \- a remix of half-sponsored messages and corrupted sound bites scratching in my ears.

It tried to advance, lugging a step towards me, so I fired.

The bullet hit where the UV light had already cooked its form, right in a raw patch of boiling static, but instead of a clean entry wound, reality tore as its flesh blew open in a geyser of white noise. I saw inside it: frames of other places, hallways, headlights, an operating table, someone's bedroom - swirling past the hole in a blur. The bullet cut through them all, dragging a comet-tail of glitch with it, as the creature convulsed. Every piece of it slipped further out of sync; faces morphed into a screaming collage, several arms twitched in delayed directions, its outline ballooned, as a bomb of sound erupted from it - hurling me off my feet and into a table.

Its body blew outward like a grenade. Static detonated into a jagged sphere, shredding through tile and chrome and glass, as half the diner's wall ceased to be - ripped out of space.

Then it fled onto the street - a teleporting, slithering mass of pained static - before vanishing into the night, leaving a brief, untextured trail of vertigo-inducing grey in its wake.

The OPEN sign outside flashed a new word in between blinks, letters stuttering into place where they didn't belong.

'LIVE'

I stumbled outside, head and heart pounding, and leaned on a car that wasn't quite there.

Six months on the force, I had my first domestic.

Second floor of a shitty apartment, end of the hall, number already flagged for 'prior incidents'. Neighbours had reported shouting and a crying kid, so Dispatch tossed me over. A young woman met me at the door, red-eyed with a polite smile that didn't match her shaking hands.

'He' hovered in the kitchen.

No damage, nothing broken, no visible injuries, no kid; just a raised voice and overreacting neighbours.

My gut whispered that it wasn't nothing - the way she glanced at him before every answer. But policy pays no mind to 'gut feelings'. I took their statements, handed over a pamphlet, told her she could call us anytime, and I went home to a warm bed.

But then I went back.

Again.

And again.

*And again*.

Different days, same apartment, same rushed apology; same look in her eyes, same break in her voice. Yet every time, *every time*, things looked just calm enough to walk away from.

The last callout was quiet. No shouts, no cries; the neighbours said the silence concerned them more. The TV was still on when I entered.

She was on the couch, eyes raw, long gone from this world.

While He hung in the bedroom with blood on his hands.

I did everything by the book on that one. Got told it wasn't my fault, but I knew better. I'd walked away from that mangy little home plenty of times when my instincts told me not to. So when a radio asked for help from nowhere, from a place that didn't exist, I knew my mind would've been made up.

Atonement, maybe.

I think that's why I saw her little face amidst a gunshot wound of white noise and broken static. Not angry or sad, merely... watching. Judging.

Wondering if I'd run away again.

The second **rip** came without mercy.

The observatory didn't only shake this time - it imploded. Invisible, folding billows sped down the mountain like shockwaves, crashing through the forest and impacting the street, splintering everything they touched, breaking structures apart and rebuilding them in the span of thoughts. I watched people spawn in and out in different styles, from various decades; kids on bikes, soldiers in masks, tourists with cameras, walking through each other, through me, through anything that was or wasn't there.

Then I saw myself.

A multitude of Ellies, scattered through the maddening mess, with torn uniforms and guns drawn or not even a cop at all, running for their lives, praying on their knees, walking their dogs, staring up at the sky, and the waves kept coming; time and space buckled, reformed, then buckled again, as my insides began to crawl out of my body.

I thought this would be my end, lost in a paradoxical typhoon - reduced to an unexplainable phenomenon - but then, somewhere inside the chaos, the worst of it calmed, and my radio spat out a ragged word.

""-*climb*\-""

My ghosts had returned; a familiar, comforting patchwork of timid, exhausted voices.

""-*mountain path \[static\] with you--brace \[static\] up*\-""

\-

Astronauts describe walking on the moon as a mix of 'magnificent desolation', with stark beauty and intense light, but also a sense of indescribable wonder and adventure - a trampoline bounce in low gravity, as Earth hangs in a jet-black, starless sky.

I wondered how such trained, privileged adventurers would describe wading through Hell, as my first step onto the gravel-caked, rotting wood landed seconds before I did, the ground buffering under my weight. The path ascended fast, shouldering into the trees; a nervy strip of nature that couldn't settle, while the leaking observatory hung above it like a bad omen.

Out here, the equipment was different.

Instead of jammers and tripods, the hardware along the path had been built as a fence. Short pylons stood in rows on either side of the trail, no higher than my hip, drilled straight into the roots. Between them, lines of invisible pressure danced in the air, catching the moonlight in wrong ways.

UV lamps the size of flares were cradled in the metal, their light pointed not at the town, but out into the trees; burning clean wedges of bleached bark. Cinderblock speakers squatted between the lamps, their faces singing in frozen sound.

There was a thick grain of slow-moving static just beyond the barrier. Shapes heaved just past the reach of the light, packed shoulder-to-shoulder along the mountainside: loose silhouettes, glitching outlines, people and not-people slow as sleep. Blank faces drifted in and out of the gloom - dozens, maybe hundreds.

Every few meters, a pylon pulsed weakly, and the nearest shape flinched, restrained under some pressure I couldn't see or feel, but *hear*.

A containment of light and sound, wrapped around the path and beyond.

But it wasn't perfect.

At the very start of the trail, two pylons had been dragged just enough out of alignment - their cables snagged, their housings cracked. Between them, the air sagged, and the invisible pressure caved inward. Occasionally, a fleeting crack would appear, and a grey hand would slither out, flickering between nails, metal, and bone. It clawed at the gap, pushing through, when the nearest UV canister coughed out what strength it had and blistered the hand into white-hot confetti.

The crack would seal, temporarily.

I understood how one of them could've escaped.

My radio gave the softest click.

""*-walk quiet--trench line-*""

Soon, I stopped just short of the observatory, in a car park of grand, curated scientific study sprawled with white tents and MOCs - their terminals still running.

Up close, the building was disappointingly ordinary. It was never the problem.

Every instrument they had up here, every setup, their endless arsenal of gadgets, faced the mountain - hooked up with cables and sensors, like a giant patient in need of surgery.

What they monitored was not a shape, but a wound in geometry - an impossible prism of light moulded into the granite; blooming edges of colourless bursts, a radiant malfunction of stuttering angles, and vibrating in horrid, wiggling wretches, blasting out waves of energy that spilt into the town below.

""*-woken--vessel* *\[static\] you see \[static\] crashed--stuck*\-""

""How do I turn it-""

""-***we remember you***\-""

The others made no attempt to silence their fractured comrades, who then spoke with unrivalled clarity.

""*You shot them. Bold. Most get scared*.""

""What're-""

""*All of them. Every wave. Look*.""

My eyes glazed over the protruding vessel.

It shimmered, in perfect sync, with every word.

""*People do not belong in here. Release them*.""

A myriad of colours oozed from its hull as it tried to phase out of the rock. A bastion of obelisks amidst the ground, the first line of defence wired to the MOCs, matched its rainbow display in tandem.

""... how?""

""*One of the terminals. Shut it down. All of it. Please*.""

Before I could move, a gabble of noise stumbled up the path behind me, replacing the cadence of commercials and cartoons with clipped military channels.

""-*Alpha to F.O.B \[Beep\] field log corrupted, retrying \[Buzz\] do you have any idea what they're doing up \[static\]*\-""

My boots skidded as I bolted to the nearest terminal. I slapped keys and snapped a cursor through unreadable fields and thermals until a green menu stared back.

\> NODE: OBSERVATORY

\> STATUS: UNSTABLE

\> COMMAND: \_ \_ \_

""*End.*"" Said my radio.

""What?!""

""*Command. End*.""

I glanced over my shoulder at the rippling air and oncoming chatter as the thing took shape. It had changed uniforms, shifting through combat gear and lab coats, then blue hazmat suits and armour.

""-*hey! who's there?! \[static\] are we authorised for this \[static\] greatest breakthrough of our species, and you wanna get cold feet \[static\] subject: persistent-correction required*""

\> COMMAND: END

I nearly slammed it in.

And the world popped.

For a breath, there was no sound - only a pressure change. Then, every electronic in sight croaked dead at once. The speaker on my belt sparked and flung itself off, dissolving. My flashlight exploded, ripping through my flesh with jagged pieces and a violet burst, falling me to one knee with a yelp.

Then the mountain screamed.

The 'vessel' flared and ripped itself free, tearing the stone like it was wet paper. Granite peeled and crumbled, scaffolding and cables snapped, trucks flipped several feet into the air and phased through the ground. The prism wrenched itself out in a spray of dust and broken light, took a single, staggered look at its reeling saviour, and then, in a single jump... it was gone, a streak vanishing straight into the sky.

From the veil I had driven through, a quake detonated - a rupture rolling in on itself like a sheet, becoming a towering wall of static-white, reaching the clouds, that erased everything it touched as it volleyed towards us.

*Us*.

The pain in my leg had distracted me enough to not realise the static man was still here, still advancing.

""-*final state pending \[static\] final state pending \[static\] final*\-""

I drew my pistol and emptied every bullet, but without the UV light, it was like shooting a fog. Round after round pinged through its body, absorbed by glimpses of rooms, of other skies, and it kept coming; now devoid of any features remotely human.

I reloaded with shaking, bloody hands and fired again until my gun clicked.

The encroaching white wall swallowed the base of the path, then the observatory, as the entity reached for me, its many hands smearing into my face as a glow washed over its shoulders... and I closed my eyes.

The wall took us in a single, enveloping surge.

Then there was nothing at all.

\-

""Ellie?""

I knew his voice; he sounded amused.

""You still with us, kid?""

I opened my eyes to find myself on a stretcher, a paramedic tending the bandages around my leg, and a wrinkled hand in front of me snapping his fingers.

""Helloooo? Earth to Ellie?""

I was still at the observatory; military equipment had been replaced with a police presence and some suspicious vans, their open doors revealing cargoes of narcotics. Punks were slammed onto the hoods of cruisers, cuffed, and shoved into back seats.

An older, grizzled cop looked down at me, one arm in a sling.

""I... what?"" I stammered out.

""Did she hit her head?"" He asked the paramedic, and I knew then where I'd heard him before -  an officer who radioed a 10-33.

""She lost a bit of blood, that's all. Give her a minute.""

Behind them, a news crew assembled. A redhead reporter chucked away her cigarette and rustled her hair as her cameraman counted her down.

""Are we ready? Cool-We are here LIVE from Swallow Coast where it seems a brave batch of officers have made history in one of the largest drug busts Oregon has ever known-""

I drowned her out, rubbing my temples.

Marcus was his name, who insisted on escorting me back to my car despite my demand to be alone. Every step, I felt sick. I expected the sky to tweak, or a shadow to lag behind me - *something* leftover.

Instead, Swallow Coast looked like any other town.

The diner wore a fresh coat of paint and boasted a health-inspected 'A' in the window. A teenager replaced a dead soldier in the end booth, wiping down tables, earbuds in; the only radio noise was a pop station whining about breakups and summer love.

If I tried hard enough, I could almost convince myself that I'd hallucinated the whole thing.

Blood loss from shrapnel?

Stress?

Almost.

Until a select few sounds hit my ears the wrong way, my newfound tubby friend paying no mind to my tiny flinches. Eventually, we reached my cruiser - still 'parked' at the edge of town, where a friendly mechanic fiddled inside the hood, finalising his work, overlooked by an old cell tower.

""How's she looking?!"" Marcus barked.

He looked at me. ""Ah, she'll drive, but your precinct needs to upgrade your wheels. This thing's a fucking relic.""

""I'll keep it in mind,"" I said, suddenly very eager to drive far, far away from this place.

But Marcus wouldn't allow that, oh no - not until he'd said goodbye. He watched me slide into my driver’s seat before planting himself in the doorway, leaning nonchalantly on the roof.

""You sure you're okay?""

""Yeah, fine.""

""If you say so, hero. And don't worry,"" he winked, ""I'm gonna be putting in a good word with your chief-oh, hold on-"" his hand flicked over my shoulder, ""-huh... your radio was off. Weird.""

""Ha, yeah... *weird*.""

""Well, drive safe. And if I ever need backup again, I'm asking for you personally."" He chuckled and made his leave with a hefty wave.

I waited until his shape was gone before shrivelling and collapsing into my seat, my hand snapping over my throbbing chest. Tears welled up fast and I sobbed and fitted like a toddler, until my radio spoke, and I almost shrieked.

""You're back on the system, 3-Adam-12! We thought we lost you! What happened?!""

I composed myself quickly, wiping my face.

""Uh... my car, um-... broke, Dispatch.""

""... broke?""

""That's right.""

""Okay... I'll make a note of that. Anything else to report?""

""No, Dispatch. Say, do you-""

""Hold on, 3-Adam-12-"" her attention was taken away ""-right, we've got a domestic the next town over, all local units are busy. Feeling up for it?""

I'd barely caught my own breath as I looked out at the sunrise.

It was unlike any I'd seen.

""I... yeah..."" I rallied myself. ""Show me en route.""",2,1767340217.0,writers,1,1.0,False
1q1spbm,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1q1spbm/sever_the_static/,Sever The Static,"Crickets make peaceful company; a lulling ambience to soothe the quiet side road, where a girl can puff another smoke, wondering what lecture Chief's gonna bark come morning.

But my night was only beginning.

The dash radio didn't just crackle to life - it sputtered in jumbled, inaudible pieces. I assumed the worn-down piece of shit was broken as I flicked away my butt and slogged back to the door, but I barely had time to sit down when a man's voice slipped through the garbled static.

""*10-33, all units! \[static\] 10-33, all units, please, I'm-*"" Something was wrong with his voice. Each burst of static carried a different version of the same man; layered, varied tones out of sync.

""*Swallow Coast is \[static\] Swallow Coast is gone--Swallow Coast is... wrong \[static\]* *PLEASE, MY*\-""

The voices then stumbled together into a single, dead tone and repeated the same phrase over and over.

""*help us*""

Then it broke apart again, overlapping into a shattered mess of protocol codes, before cutting off to a null silence. My hand was halfway to the volume knob, trembling; I'd heard panicked officers be shot at before, fighting to speak, but never had I heard *anything* like that.

A glitch? A ghost? A dream? My mind raced down every avenue, but a single ugly detail kept pecking at my brain.

'Swallow Coast'

Training kicked in.

""Dispatch, 3-Adam-12,"" I said, my voice sounding far steadier than I felt. ""Copy an unknown 10-33 that just came over my in-car. Unidentified officer, no call sign, giving location as 'Swallow Coast.'""

I stared out at the empty road.

""Be advised,"" I added, forcing the words out, ""I don't show a 'Swallow Coast' on any local grids. Can you run a trace on the transmission?""

I released the button, and the radio went back to dead air.

""3-Adam-12, Dispatch here."" Her voice was calm, but there was a hesitance to it. ""We've got a hit.""

""Go ahead, Dispatch.""

""Signal's bouncing off the east repeater, origin somewhere off County Road 17, past marker 22."" Papers rustled faintly on her end. ""Be advised that stretch is... it just *ends* out there.""

I squinted through the windshield, trying to picture it.

I'd patrolled that road a hundred times.

""Dispatch, confirm. You're telling me an emergency call came from the middle of nowhere?""

""Affirmative. How do you want to proceed?""

I glanced at the black stretch of highway disappearing into the trees, and took a deep breath.

""Dispatch, show me en route.""

I flipped on my lights and pulled back onto the tar, my headlights carving a narrow tunnel through the ensemble of timber. The silence became a pressure; the radio a faint, constant open breath as I ran the familiar stretch.

""Dispatch, 3-Adam-12,"" I said, ""Confirm last known origin was off 17, past marker 22.""

""Affirmative. You should be the only thing moving out there.""

The terrain began to climb; the highway curled along the flank of a mountain in long, sweeping turns where only a guardrail stood between me and a steep drop. When the trees broke, I caught glimpses of it - the pale smear of the heaving Pacific.

By 21, the air had turned damp and cold, seeping in through the vents. My GPS started to lag - a little car sliding over green nothing. I frowned, tapping the casing with a knuckle, when the weather-beaten marker 22 lurched out of the shadows.

I parked beside it.

Fifty yards past the marker, veering off the road and into the wild on a narrowing, overgrown trail, the path, as described, stopped.

A hard, abrupt gravel edge.

""Dispatch, be advised. I've arrived at origin-""

The speaker exploded into unrelenting noise.

Not static, not feedback - voices; a hundred of them at once, slamming into my ears. Snatches of jingles, movie lines, sitcom laughs, news anchors, late-night preachers, kids shouting over commercials, pop songs, intimate phone calls; every recorded sound I'd ever heard stacked on top of each other, out of tune.

Out of time.

""-*copy that, over and out--he's looking at you, kid--baby, don't hurt me, don't--breaking news tonight as officials--wake up, she's here*.""

""Dispatch?!"" I snapped, one hand clamped on the mic, the other white-knuckled around the wheel. ""Dispatch, I'm experiencing a malfunction! Do you copy?!""

""*-late night deals you won't believe--please, if anyone is there--this is not a test, this is an emergency broadcast*\-""

Something thudded softly under my foot.

The brake pedal sank half an inch.

I hadn't moved my leg.

""No...""

I stomped down, hard. The pedal met resistance - then, bit by bit, pushed back against me.

The gear lever clicked.

PARK - REVERSE - DRIVE

""Dispatch, I-""

""-*we now return to your feature presentation*\-""

The cruiser began to roll. Slow at first, just a whisper over the gravel as I slammed my foot on the brakes, and it shrugged me off.

The wheel didn't budge either as the car aligned with the void ahead.

I twisted the key out!

Nothing!

A canned studio audience roared out from the radio, drowning out a weatherman promising clear skies and a man's ragged voice yelling, ""*They cut the road, they CUT THE ROAD-*""

I grabbed for the seatbelt, and the latch clicked, but the strap wouldn't release - remaining locked across my chest.

I hit the door handle, but it bounced against the damn frame.

""Come on!"" I spat, slamming my shoulder into it. Fruitless.

The car rolled on, patient and unbothered by my efforts.

A hoarse male voice cut through the layers.

""*Please-if anyone-I've got a daughter in*\-""

Static chewed him up and vomited him back out as a game show buzzer.

""-*wrong answer, but thanks for playing*\-""

""Stop,"" I murmured, my nerves becoming shot.

Far ahead, at the very end of the light, something began to take shape. It was a dense patch of shimmering thin white; a near-transparent wall where empty air should've been.

Fog, I told myself. Except fog didn't sit flat.

Forty yards.

The wall resolved into a smooth sheet of glitching white-and-black, texture-less, depthless static. And beyond it - for just an instant - I thought I saw the orange smear of streetlights.

""-*you are now entering--the following film contains--they said the sky was wrong--don't touch that dial, you're gonna get us all*\-"" The radio begged, pleaded, sold me detergent, laughed at its own jokes, as the distance between bumper and curtain shrank.

Thirty yards.

Twenty.

""Stop the fucking car!"" I yelled, losing all professionalism as I hammered the windows and wheel, the horn blaring weakly amidst the radio's storm.

""-*ma'am, you need to remain calm*\-""

""SHUT THE FUCK UP!""

The glitching veil loomed in, filling the windshield with nothing I had a word for. I clawed at the seatbelt, desperate - jump out, climb out, do something, anything, but go through whatever that was, yet my fate was inevitable.

So I did all I had left.

I squeezed my eyes shut and braced.

And the car rolled in.

All sense of direction vanished; the seat fell away under me, then jumped back up, and my body felt like it'd plummeted through an ice sheet beyond physics.

Every voice on the radio hit a single, piercing note.

Then silence - a quick, surgical cut into the noise.

My ears popped as the world slid back in, the car coming to a stop, and after I realised I was still breathing, I slowly forced my eyes open.

The dead-end road was gone. In its place was a wide, slick street glistening with rain; lined with buildings, flickering neon, and a diner with a crooked 'OPEN' sign. A distant pier lamp swung over black water, and, carving its way up a mountain path, was a brass-and-steel observatory gazing at the stars.

On one corner, a street sign hung from a rusted pole.

'Swallow Coast'

I finally got my hands to move and reached for the gear shift, expecting the same resistance. It moved willingly, but the engine was dead; as was my radio. I was, however, able to free myself from the seatbelt and sprang out of my powerless cruiser, feeling sick and cold on wobbling legs.

A pickup truck stalked behind a pale sedan, headlights still faint, like they were running on memory. A hatchback rested at an angle to the curb, its front tyre up on the sidewalk, attempting to flee. Closer, a cruiser from a foreign department nosed into the intersection - its pattern like mine, but the crest on the door was smudged, like vandalised paint.

They were empty. Forgotten.

""Dispatch? Are you there?""

...

I walked towards a military Humvee, hunched closer to the diner, olive metal dulled by grime. A faded stencil on the door spelt 'U.S Army', but the unit markings beneath were the same as the cruiser. The passenger door hung open.

I peered in.

No gear, no duffels, no guns; just seats, and the impression that its occupants simply evaporated. The sedan had a purse on the driver's seat, its contents scattered: a wallet, receipts, a cracked phone frozen on a family photo, the seatbelt slack and twisted, the engine cold.

I turned back the way I'd come, towards where the road should've cut.

Instead, the street sloped gently upward until it met a structure that did not belong here. At first, I mistook it for a cell tower, but it was a makeshift lattice of metal and cables - antennas speared out; dish arrays, spiralled coils, panels that hummed faintly with colour. Wires as thick as my arm ran down into a fenced-off outpost bristling with control boxes and blinking lights.

I had to crane my neck to see the beacon at the peak - a red light flashing randomly.

Behind the tower, barely, hung the 'thing' I'd driven through.

From this side, the veil was much thinner. Instead of a static wall, it was more like distorted glass - a wavering, curving slice of sky that didn't fit.

More vehicles sat at the base, facing the shimmer; unquestionably military, rusting and rotten, all pointed at the same impossible curtain.

The tower then hummed as if waking up, and my radio sparked to life - coughing out a single, wailing tone that stung my ears and rattled my teeth.

I didn't notice it immediately, only catching the structure in the corner of my eye as my head pounded, but up in the mountain, the observatory *shivered*.

From the street, it looked textbook - a crown perched atop the rocks with domes and spires winking like old coins, highlighted by either its own gleaming light or what they caught from the stars.

Yet under the signal's pressure, the whole building shook.

Then the first **rip** happened.

The observatory spasmed and snapped, as if a cursor were trying to drag it across a screen; it remained in place, defiantly, but it became distorted, as if shifted through eras. For a blink, the glass was cracked and dark, the brass tarnished, and entire sections hung loose, like something blew it up from inside.

My radio climbed another notch, drilling through my jaw and violating my skull.

The observatory jerked again - now under construction.

Floodlights bleached the mountain path, support beams and half-built walls cast shadows across the rocks; domes became webs of hollow steel, and cranes hung over the whole scene, jittering and flickering as the sky seized from night to day to night again. I could almost hear construction noises - shouted instructions, the clatter of tools, the whistling of men.

I fell to my hands and knees, a trickle of blood oozing from my nose.

Everything was vibrating.

The observatory stuttered once more. It burned.

Orange triumphed inside the central dome; flames beat metal, smoke rolled up in a thick column, but didn't behave right - freezing, lagging. Something within it pulsed white-hot, brighter than any heat I'd ever seen, as my vision blurred, and the road under me melted, then hardened, becoming dirt and snow and magma. I tasted metal in the deepest recesses of my throat as my radio reached a pitch I didn't think was possible.

The observatory tore a final time, but not just the building.

The sky above split open.

A hairline crack at first - a tiny, jagged, thin line - that widened in wild jumps, tearing and stopping, until a gaping wound hung over the mountain.

A scar of colourless deep, where stars were packed far too close together - undiscovered by any astronomer.

They didn't twinkle like jewels. They blinked like eyes.

A pungent waft of burnt electricity rolled down the mountain and filled the street, as my radio became another chorus of relentless sound.

""-*entrance. logged*\--*all units, hold the line, do not approach--test the alert, damn it--alpha, requesting permission to--swiper no swiping--praise be, brothers and sisters--pay separate shipping and handling--if you or a loved one has been diagnosed with cancer--observatory team, do you copy--what the FUCK IS THAT THING--top 10 cartoon themes, number 3 will--this message will repeat--he's still in there--side effects may include dizziness, nausea, loss of self, existential dread--what have you done, boy*\-*-we are here LIVE from Swallow Coast where it seems a-*""

The radio cut out, damning me into another empty silence as the ripping of space stopped, my vision returned through harsh blinks, and the observatory clicked back to normalcy. I scrubbed trembling hands over my nose and lips, wiping away blood, and considered curling into a ball right there on the road among hollow cars, until the next signal came and fried my head to putty.

What in God's name had I done to deserve this?

""*Ellie...*""

I didn't believe I'd heard them at first, my ears and head still clearing the pain, but as my composure slowly crawled back, I realised someone was trying to talk to me over the radio.

""*Ellie--you there?*""

Not a gurgle of madness, but a sane, deliberate attempt at communication; still not just a lone voice, but several, concerned dialects - never repeating - of varying ages and tones, taking turns in between statics.

""-*click receiver \[static\] alive--just breathe, girl \[static\] not alone-*""

I jabbed at my radio.

Click.

""-*copy, she hears \[static\] the diner \[static\] equipment--trust-*""

A new voice slid in between them, low and bitter.

""-***you're not going anywhere***\-""

""-*cut them out! \[static\] ignore--scared--not one of us-*""

I forced my thumb down, my voice raw and scratched.

""Who are you? What the fuck is this place?""

""-*pocket \[static\] failed test--caught signal-*"" A child's voice flickered in. ""-*they turned it on, and it never turned off-*"" Then a soft old man. ""*-observatory is unstable*\-"" Then a calm, hurried woman. ""-*held it as long \[static\] can't get up--you can-*""

""What?! Me?! Why, what did I-""

There was a beat of overlapping sharp breaths, pleas and begs; then a gentle, older woman.

""*-sorry, sweetheart \[static\] your car \[static\] radio--a line in \[static\] can't lose-""*

\*""-\****chose you*** *\[static\]* ***lab rat***\-""

A squeal of feedback, then the calm woman again.

""-*reaches further \[static\] every breach \[static\] spreading--understand?*""

Finally, a man.

""-*doctor \[static\] seen it--outside \[static\] right place, right time \[static\] guide you--move, now \[static\] shut it \[static\] free us-*""

The channel fluttered, then steadied into a song of tangled encouragement, praise, and laughs and cries, and faint, drowned-out screams.

""Okay,"" I said, more to myself, seeing no other choice. ""Tell me what to do.""

\-

The closer I got to the diner, the more the streets had been terraformed into a military foothold.

Another Humvee crouched half a block down, choking the roads; cracks inched across its windshield, then retreated, like the glass was deciding whether or not to shatter. Farther along, a gloomy, armoured truck sat with its back doors open. Inside was empty, save for a single dangling headset swinging in still air.

A few steps from the truck, they'd planted a miniature radio tower. It was no taller than me - just a braced mast bolted straight into the earth. At its base, a metal shoebox hummed faintly, LEDs frozen mid-blink.

""*-repeater-*"" a measured, academic voice said over my radio. ""*-node--jam the \[static\] cage-*""

""Didn't work?"" I asked.

""*-not for long-*"" a regretful woman answered.

Beyond it were two tripod rigs, their heads pointed towards the street.

Except the mounts weren't guns.

The closest carried a cluster of speakers - flat, hexagonal panels arranged in a honeycomb, each one mottled with a mesh of tiny holes, ringed with melted plastic. The path directly in front of the speaker array was scorched in a perfect cone, not by heat, but by... absence. There was no grit, no oil stains, just a smooth, blasted-down layer of reality.

The other tripod mounted a lamp. A fat cylinder with cooling fins and nested lenses, tagged with a warning label - UV ONLY. The beam was off, but a faint violet tint clung to the terrain it aimed at.

""*-light--burns \[static\] sound--stuns-*""

""*-****calibre*** *\[static\]* ***severs*** ***the****-*""

The unwelcome voices were diluted out again.

""Who are they?"" I asked, inspecting the tripods. ""The ones you keep shutting up?""

""*-fractured \[static\] dangerous--uncooperative-*""

A low sandbag wall braced the mouth of a nearby alley. Riot shields leaned carelessly along it, their viewports spangled with neat, clustered cracks.

From here, the alley tightened and dead-ended against a brick wall painted with peeling graffiti, but the air above the sandbags bent wrong, like I was looking through a fisheye. I took one cautious step closer and saw, for only an instant, the suggestion of another street cutting across the wall: cars nose-to-ass, a bus shelter, the swarming of civilians, a billboard in a language I couldn't understand.

A second layer of another town, out of alignment.

Then I blinked, and the alley ended with a wall again.

""*-don't go in there-*""

""Yeah, no shit.""

The radio chuckled - a quick, nervous ripple of different laughs.

Ahead, the diner waited.

The windows stuttered worse than the Humvee - intact, webbed, blown out - and the OPEN sign rolled through the wrong sequence - O P N E - before becoming abstract symbols my eyes slid off. It hurt to look at. The foundation was stitched with bullet holes; casings littered the ground - little brass maps charting where soldiers had stood and fired, and fired again, at something that left no trace.

""What were they shooting at?""

My question was met with silence.

Then, the bitter voice - softer now.

""***Us*** *\[static\]* ***not enough***\*-\*""

My hand brushed over my sidearm.

""*-inside, Ellie \[static\] tools-*"" the kind woman urged, ""-*survival*\-""

The bell above the door rang three different times as the smell hit me.

Decay - old, dried out, folded under dust and chemicals, and burnt coffee and fried grease soaked so deeply into the walls. The stuttering was horrid: seats went from cracked red vinyl to bare springs and torn yellow form, then back again; menus flickered in and out of existence, and a jukebox danced between models. Tables had been shoved around a central aisle, their legs braced. Cots crowded the floor - army-issue frames sagging under mattresses, sheets twisted and stained, and a portable generator cowered near the counter, its casing open; wires spilt out like guts, threading through ammo crates and jerry-rigged equipment.

I saw him then.

He sat in the last booth, facing the door. For a moment, I thought he was asleep - chin tucked, shoulders hunched, but the details became apparent.

The soldier was almost a skeleton.

Brittle fatigue clung to him; his uniform stiffened by dust. What skin I could see was like parchment, pulled tight over bone in sunken hollows; his dog tag had fused with his collarbone, the metal nesting in a little crater where his flesh had given up, and his jaw hung loose, teeth bared... a man exhausted from screaming.

His hand still cupped the air near his temple, fingers frozen around a missing pistol, a dark crater in the booth's backrest staining where the bullet had gone - a grainy, pixelated splatter.

My stomach knotted.

Two objects in front of him offered themselves to me.

The first was a flashlight, stubby and industrial with a wide, dark lens ringed with faded warning tape. The other was a compact speaker; one side a grid of tiny holes, the opposite a switch.

A worn voice breathed out on my shoulder.

""-*good man--kind--brave-*""

I cleared my throat. ""Yet he died alone.""

""-*better that than \[static\] lost in--signals-*""

I reached out for the pocket speaker.

""-*careful \[static\] tuned-*"" the academic voice muttered.

""For what?""

They all spoke at once, a tangle of the same answer.

""-*to be louder than them*\-""

I placed both tools in my belt.

Then the soldier's skull tilted, vertebrae creaking, and my heart lurched; hand flying to my sidearm, but it was only my disturbance of the table that moved him. I breathed a sigh of relief and steadied my pulse... when *his* radio came alive, a clunky handset clipped to his waist.

It did not speak; it hissed.

""-***LEAVE IT ON*** *\[static\]* ***GO HOME, GIRL***\*--**YOU'LL KILL US**\-\*""

My own radio crackled in sympathy, and my company interjected, but they were suddenly faint.

""-*Ellie \[static\] focus--don't*\-""

The soldier's radio overpowered them, its volume spiking.

""-***NOT*** *\[static\]* ***THE FIRST PIG*** *\[static\]* ***THEY LIE***\*--**THEY SENT ALL**\-""\* a sobbing child's voice warped through ""-***WE HURT*** *\[static\]* ***DON'T TURN US OFF***\*-""\*

Both radios screamed - a thousand voices mashed together.

""*-ELLIE, GET OUT OF--FEEDBACK--COMING*\--***found you***\--\*try--\*\*\*\*RAM IT, BURN IT--\*\*\**speaker--****kill your radio****--****KILL YOURSELF****--don't touch*\--*not whole anymore--angry--****STILL HERE****--****STILL FEEL****-""*

It was a thrash of sound - threats, pleas, curses, prayers, all ground together - that ached my head. I didn't hesitate. I reached for the portable speaker, flipped the switch, and my world tunnelled as it squealed a deafening wail. The generator hiccupped, the overhead lights burned and burst, the jukebox lit up and spun through songs too fast, and the dead soldier's radio cut off as his body slumped forward.

Then there was only silence as I found myself alone in a dark diner, the speaker hot against my waist.

My own radio crackled twice, confused.

""*-Ellie?!*""

Then it too failed.

And for the first time, Swallow Coast was truly quiet.

The diner's own sounds quickly crept out like insects: the creaks of booths adjusting to no weight, a slow, patient drip from somewhere in the kitchen, the soft, intermittent hum of the neon sign outside. Breath left my lungs in slippery, shaky exhales, as I fidgeted with my radio - not willing to accept this loneliness as permanent.

*Ding*.

The bell above the front door chimed.

Once. Perfectly.

*Ding.*

Again.

The door didn't move, but the sound was thicker this time - as if underwater. The air near the entrance wobbled, just a fraction, as I drew my gun and the flashlight.

*Ding.*

The doorframe trembled in place, smearing sideways in short, nauseating skips, then bulged and rippled and flattened, and *something* pressed through it.

Familiar broken nonsense reached me first.

""*-don't touch that dial, we'll be right with you \[flatline\] you're about to start \[phone dial\] one woman, one night, lost her friends \[Windows Startup\] coming up: a local officer goes \[sirens\]* ***skinned and flayed***\*-\*""

The idea of a man began to materialise, cobbled together from a disjointed static mass of flickering grey fuzz; his chest strobed between suits, hoodies, bare skin, hospital gowns, and his face was layers upon layers over a vertical slack - an old man's profile, a child's wide eyes, a woman's gaping mouth mid-scream, a teenager chewing gum. They swam through one another, never syncing, each countless expression trying to dominate the other; far too many crammed into the same outline.

Every time he moved, pieces of him lagged behind at different frame-rates or spasmed into mundane tasks, as a radio snow flaked off his edges, popping and disintegrating into nothing. He stepped into the diner (if you could call it that), tearing out of the door, the sounds of his feet were complex, dry keyboard clicks dubbed over with car doors, gunshots, soda cans, and a microphone. The air bent around him, violating the space into an elongated, glitching funhouse.

Then he looked at me, and all the mouths in his head smiled.

""-*anomaly. found-*""

On intuition, my thumb pressed the taped switch on the flashlight, and a solid, bruise-dark violet bar erupted and hit the 'man' square in the chest. The result was instant. Touched by the light, the static went from grey to a blistering, overexposed white and orange - then burned brighter than the sun. Pieces of mismatched people peeled back like melting film, bubbling out of existence, as a dozen borrowed eyes flared and scowled.

A film-trailer voice gulped mid-sentence, dropping a few octaves, and a jingle stretched into a thin, digital scream as the air around it pulsed back several inches toward normal. The creature staggered, raising its jittery, convulsive arms to shield itself; the mosaic of broadcast it used as skin blackened where the beam stayed, edges crisping and curling, as it *roared* \- a remix of half-sponsored messages and corrupted sound bites scratching in my ears.

It tried to advance, lugging a step towards me, so I fired.

The bullet hit where the UV light had already cooked its form, right in a raw patch of boiling static, but instead of a clean entry wound, reality tore as its flesh blew open in a geyser of white noise. I saw inside it: frames of other places, hallways, headlights, an operating table, someone's bedroom - swirling past the hole in a blur. The bullet cut through them all, dragging a comet-tail of glitch with it, as the creature convulsed. Every piece of it slipped further out of sync; faces morphed into a screaming collage, several arms twitched in delayed directions, its outline ballooned, as a bomb of sound erupted from it - hurling me off my feet and into a table.

Its body blew outward like a grenade. Static detonated into a jagged sphere, shredding through tile and chrome and glass, as half the diner's wall ceased to be - ripped out of space.

Then it fled onto the street - a teleporting, slithering mass of pained static - before vanishing into the night, leaving a brief, untextured trail of vertigo-inducing grey in its wake.

The OPEN sign outside flashed a new word in between blinks, letters stuttering into place where they didn't belong.

'LIVE'

I stumbled outside, head and heart pounding, and leaned on a car that wasn't quite there.

Six months on the force, I had my first domestic.

Second floor of a shitty apartment, end of the hall, number already flagged for 'prior incidents'. Neighbours had reported shouting and a crying kid, so Dispatch tossed me over. A young woman met me at the door, red-eyed with a polite smile that didn't match her shaking hands.

'He' hovered in the kitchen.

No damage, nothing broken, no visible injuries, no kid; just a raised voice and overreacting neighbours.

My gut whispered that it wasn't nothing - the way she glanced at him before every answer. But policy pays no mind to 'gut feelings'. I took their statements, handed over a pamphlet, told her she could call us anytime, and I went home to a warm bed.

But then I went back.

Again.

And again.

*And again*.

Different days, same apartment, same rushed apology; same look in her eyes, same break in her voice. Yet every time, *every time*, things looked just calm enough to walk away from.

The last callout was quiet. No shouts, no cries; the neighbours said the silence concerned them more. The TV was still on when I entered.

She was on the couch, eyes raw, long gone from this world.

While He hung in the bedroom with blood on his hands.

I did everything by the book on that one. Got told it wasn't my fault, but I knew better. I'd walked away from that mangy little home plenty of times when my instincts told me not to. So when a radio asked for help from nowhere, from a place that didn't exist, I knew my mind would've been made up.

Atonement, maybe.

I think that's why I saw her little face amidst a gunshot wound of white noise and broken static. Not angry or sad, merely... watching. Judging.

Wondering if I'd run away again.

The second **rip** came without mercy.

The observatory didn't only shake this time - it imploded. Invisible, folding billows sped down the mountain like shockwaves, crashing through the forest and impacting the street, splintering everything they touched, breaking structures apart and rebuilding them in the span of thoughts. I watched people spawn in and out in different styles, from various decades; kids on bikes, soldiers in masks, tourists with cameras, walking through each other, through me, through anything that was or wasn't there.

Then I saw myself.

A multitude of Ellies, scattered through the maddening mess, with torn uniforms and guns drawn or not even a cop at all, running for their lives, praying on their knees, walking their dogs, staring up at the sky, and the waves kept coming; time and space buckled, reformed, then buckled again, as my insides began to crawl out of my body.

I thought this would be my end, lost in a paradoxical typhoon - reduced to an unexplainable phenomenon - but then, somewhere inside the chaos, the worst of it calmed, and my radio spat out a ragged word.

""-*climb*\-""

My ghosts had returned; a familiar, comforting patchwork of timid, exhausted voices.

""-*mountain path \[static\] with you--brace \[static\] up*\-""

\-

Astronauts describe walking on the moon as a mix of 'magnificent desolation', with stark beauty and intense light, but also a sense of indescribable wonder and adventure - a trampoline bounce in low gravity, as Earth hangs in a jet-black, starless sky.

I wondered how such trained, privileged adventurers would describe wading through Hell, as my first step onto the gravel-caked, rotting wood landed seconds before I did, the ground buffering under my weight. The path ascended fast, shouldering into the trees; a nervy strip of nature that couldn't settle, while the leaking observatory hung above it like a bad omen.

Out here, the equipment was different.

Instead of jammers and tripods, the hardware along the path had been built as a fence. Short pylons stood in rows on either side of the trail, no higher than my hip, drilled straight into the roots. Between them, lines of invisible pressure danced in the air, catching the moonlight in wrong ways.

UV lamps the size of flares were cradled in the metal, their light pointed not at the town, but out into the trees; burning clean wedges of bleached bark. Cinderblock speakers squatted between the lamps, their faces singing in frozen sound.

There was a thick grain of slow-moving static just beyond the barrier. Shapes heaved just past the reach of the light, packed shoulder-to-shoulder along the mountainside: loose silhouettes, glitching outlines, people and not-people slow as sleep. Blank faces drifted in and out of the gloom - dozens, maybe hundreds.

Every few meters, a pylon pulsed weakly, and the nearest shape flinched, restrained under some pressure I couldn't see or feel, but *hear*.

A containment of light and sound, wrapped around the path and beyond.

But it wasn't perfect.

At the very start of the trail, two pylons had been dragged just enough out of alignment - their cables snagged, their housings cracked. Between them, the air sagged, and the invisible pressure caved inward. Occasionally, a fleeting crack would appear, and a grey hand would slither out, flickering between nails, metal, and bone. It clawed at the gap, pushing through, when the nearest UV canister coughed out what strength it had and blistered the hand into white-hot confetti.

The crack would seal, temporarily.

I understood how one of them could've escaped.

My radio gave the softest click.

""*-walk quiet--trench line-*""

Soon, I stopped just short of the observatory, in a car park of grand, curated scientific study sprawled with white tents and MOCs - their terminals still running.

Up close, the building was disappointingly ordinary. It was never the problem.

Every instrument they had up here, every setup, their endless arsenal of gadgets, faced the mountain - hooked up with cables and sensors, like a giant patient in need of surgery.

What they monitored was not a shape, but a wound in geometry - an impossible prism of light moulded into the granite; blooming edges of colourless bursts, a radiant malfunction of stuttering angles, and vibrating in horrid, wiggling wretches, blasting out waves of energy that spilt into the town below.

""*-woken--vessel* *\[static\] you see \[static\] crashed--stuck*\-""

""How do I turn it-""

""-***we remember you***\-""

The others made no attempt to silence their fractured comrades, who then spoke with unrivalled clarity.

""*You shot them. Bold. Most get scared*.""

""What're-""

""*All of them. Every wave. Look*.""

My eyes glazed over the protruding vessel.

It shimmered, in perfect sync, with every word.

""*People do not belong in here. Release them*.""

A myriad of colours oozed from its hull as it tried to phase out of the rock. A bastion of obelisks amidst the ground, the first line of defence wired to the MOCs, matched its rainbow display in tandem.

""... how?""

""*One of the terminals. Shut it down. All of it. Please*.""

Before I could move, a gabble of noise stumbled up the path behind me, replacing the cadence of commercials and cartoons with clipped military channels.

""-*Alpha to F.O.B \[Beep\] field log corrupted, retrying \[Buzz\] do you have any idea what they're doing up \[static\]*\-""

My boots skidded as I bolted to the nearest terminal. I slapped keys and snapped a cursor through unreadable fields and thermals until a green menu stared back.

\> NODE: OBSERVATORY

\> STATUS: UNSTABLE

\> COMMAND: \_ \_ \_

""*End.*"" Said my radio.

""What?!""

""*Command. End*.""

I glanced over my shoulder at the rippling air and oncoming chatter as the thing took shape. It had changed uniforms, shifting through combat gear and lab coats, then blue hazmat suits and armour.

""-*hey! who's there?! \[static\] are we authorised for this \[static\] greatest breakthrough of our species, and you wanna get cold feet \[static\] subject: persistent-correction required*""

\> COMMAND: END

I nearly slammed it in.

And the world popped.

For a breath, there was no sound - only a pressure change. Then, every electronic in sight croaked dead at once. The speaker on my belt sparked and flung itself off, dissolving. My flashlight exploded, ripping through my flesh with jagged pieces and a violet burst, falling me to one knee with a yelp.

Then the mountain screamed.

The 'vessel' flared and ripped itself free, tearing the stone like it was wet paper. Granite peeled and crumbled, scaffolding and cables snapped, trucks flipped several feet into the air and phased through the ground. The prism wrenched itself out in a spray of dust and broken light, took a single, staggered look at its reeling saviour, and then, in a single jump... it was gone, a streak vanishing straight into the sky.

From the veil I had driven through, a quake detonated - a rupture rolling in on itself like a sheet, becoming a towering wall of static-white, reaching the clouds, that erased everything it touched as it volleyed towards us.

*Us*.

The pain in my leg had distracted me enough to not realise the static man was still here, still advancing.

""-*final state pending \[static\] final state pending \[static\] final*\-""

I drew my pistol and emptied every bullet, but without the UV light, it was like shooting a fog. Round after round pinged through its body, absorbed by glimpses of rooms, of other skies, and it kept coming; now devoid of any features remotely human.

I reloaded with shaking, bloody hands and fired again until my gun clicked.

The encroaching white wall swallowed the base of the path, then the observatory, as the entity reached for me, its many hands smearing into my face as a glow washed over its shoulders... and I closed my eyes.

The wall took us in a single, enveloping surge.

Then there was nothing at all.

\-

""Ellie?""

I knew his voice; he sounded amused.

""You still with us, kid?""

I opened my eyes to find myself on a stretcher, a paramedic tending the bandages around my leg, and a wrinkled hand in front of me snapping his fingers.

""Helloooo? Earth to Ellie?""

I was still at the observatory; military equipment had been replaced with a police presence and some suspicious vans, their open doors revealing cargoes of narcotics. Punks were slammed onto the hoods of cruisers, cuffed, and shoved into back seats.

An older, grizzled cop looked down at me, one arm in a sling.

""I... what?"" I stammered out.

""Did she hit her head?"" He asked the paramedic, and I knew then where I'd heard him before -  an officer who radioed a 10-33.

""She lost a bit of blood, that's all. Give her a minute.""

Behind them, a news crew assembled. A redhead reporter chucked away her cigarette and rustled her hair as her cameraman counted her down.

""Are we ready? Cool-We are here LIVE from Swallow Coast where it seems a brave batch of officers have made history in one of the largest drug busts Oregon has ever known-""

I drowned her out, rubbing my temples.

Marcus was his name, who insisted on escorting me back to my car despite my demand to be alone. Every step, I felt sick. I expected the sky to tweak, or a shadow to lag behind me - *something* leftover.

Instead, Swallow Coast looked like any other town.

The diner wore a fresh coat of paint and boasted a health-inspected 'A' in the window. A teenager replaced a dead soldier in the end booth, wiping down tables, earbuds in; the only radio noise was a pop station whining about breakups and summer love.

If I tried hard enough, I could almost convince myself that I'd hallucinated the whole thing.

Blood loss from shrapnel?

Stress?

Almost.

Until a select few sounds hit my ears the wrong way, my newfound tubby friend paying no mind to my tiny flinches. Eventually, we reached my cruiser - still 'parked' at the edge of town, where a friendly mechanic fiddled inside the hood, finalising his work, overlooked by an old cell tower.

""How's she looking?!"" Marcus barked.

He looked at me. ""Ah, she'll drive, but your precinct needs to upgrade your wheels. This thing's a fucking relic.""

""I'll keep it in mind,"" I said, suddenly very eager to drive far, far away from this place.

But Marcus wouldn't allow that, oh no - not until he'd said goodbye. He watched me slide into my driver’s seat before planting himself in the doorway, leaning nonchalantly on the roof.

""You sure you're okay?""

""Yeah, fine.""

""If you say so, hero. And don't worry,"" he winked, ""I'm gonna be putting in a good word with your chief-oh, hold on-"" his hand flicked over my shoulder, ""-huh... your radio was off. Weird.""

""Ha, yeah... *weird*.""

""Well, drive safe. And if I ever need backup again, I'm asking for you personally."" He chuckled and made his leave with a hefty wave.

I waited until his shape was gone before shrivelling and collapsing into my seat, my hand snapping over my throbbing chest. Tears welled up fast and I sobbed and fitted like a toddler, until my radio spoke, and I almost shrieked.

""You're back on the system, 3-Adam-12! We thought we lost you! What happened?!""

I composed myself quickly, wiping my face.

""Uh... my car, um-... broke, Dispatch.""

""... broke?""

""That's right.""

""Okay... I'll make a note of that. Anything else to report?""

""No, Dispatch. Say, do you-""

""Hold on, 3-Adam-12-"" her attention was taken away ""-right, we've got a domestic the next town over, all local units are busy. Feeling up for it?""

I'd barely caught my own breath as I looked out at the sunrise.

It was unlike any I'd seen.

""I... yeah..."" I rallied myself. ""Show me en route.""",3,1767340119.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

1q1sn5b,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q1sn5b,All 52 books that I read in 2025 as well as some of my thoughts on each.,"I didn’t set out to read 52 books this last year, I just wanted to track how much I read in a year because I’ve never done that before. At a certain point I realized I was on track to make 52 and then it became a challenge. I may track what I’ve read in the future but I won’t do it by month again and I probably won’t set a number goal either. While it was fun once I found it changed the way I read a bit as I was kind of gamifying what would otherwise just be something I do because I enjoy it. 

Anyways I don’t expect people to read all this but my thoughts are organized by month in case there’s a title that particularly interest you and you want to know more. Feel free to ask questions. 

2025 Reading

January

Medieval Europe by Chris Wickham - A good survey of a broad topic and long historical period. A nice primer for the history of medieval Europe. Best complemented by more in depth/specific books. 

Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir - An entertaining read. Andy Weir writes entertainment. 

Of Beasts and Fowls by Pilar Adón - I’ve had really good luck with translated works from Iberia the last few years. That said I didn’t enjoy this one as much. Very cerebral and I think I wasn’t in the right headspace for it. 

Migrants and Citizens by Tisha M. Rajendra - I didn’t realize this was a Catholic ethics book when I bought it at a used bookstore but I really enjoyed it. The Catholic perspective on the responsibility to treat immigrants with humanity. A good primer for arguing with religious conservatives. Got me a lot more interested in Catholic ethics. 

A Short Stay in Hell by Stephen L Peck - A quick and easy read that I had a lot of fun with. Might leave you with existential dread but it was a fun thought experiment on time, eternity, consciousness, religion, etc. You can read it in a night so it’s well worth it. 

Cold Victory by Karl Marlantes - Entertaining but by far this is Karl Marlantes’s worst book. Kind of reads like an airport read and some of the worst “men writing women” I have ever encountered. That said an interesting look at post-WWII Finland and the precarious position they were in between Russia and the west. 

Mill Town by Kerri Arsenault - I really enjoyed this book. It’s a deep dive into the life and death of a paper mill town in Maine. A big chunk of my family come from a mill town in Wisconsin and I found the socioeconomic and health impacts to be quite comparable and relatable. A worthwhile read for understanding the mindset of people in post-industrial American towns. 

February

Lucky Mud and Other Foma by Christina Jarvis - An interesting look at an aspect of one of my favorite authors. Not super exciting but worth the read if you’re a Vonnegut fan. 

Between Two Fires by Christopher Buehlman - I’ve found this book is quite polarizing. As a horror book it felt so so but looking at it more of an adventure in a pseudo-historical setting I really enjoyed it. As someone who is obsessed with the medieval era it was fun to read a book from the perspective of lower ranking peoples and get an on-the-ground perspective of a really horrific historical episode. Not a terribly challenging read I think it was worth picking up. 

Covered With Night by Nicole Eustace - A really interesting look at an event in early American history. Good perspective on 1) Colonial-Native relations and diplomacy 2) Native perspectives on justice. The book was about the aftermath of a colonist murdering a Native American in western Pennsylvania in the 18th century. Interestingly the colonists insist on justice in the traditional western sense (jail time or execution after a trial) whereas the members of the victim’s community want reconciliation through restitution in the form of gift giving and an apology. Definitely with the read for anyone interested in colonial and/or indigenous history. 

March

The Bible: A Biography by Karen Armstrong - I was not brought up religious but it’s impossible to understand western history without looking into the theology. Karen Armstrong does a good job of giving the historical perspective of how the Bible that we know came to be as well as how it was changed/interpreted throughout history. Also a good primer for understanding the worldview of American Conservative Evangelicals. I found it complemented some other ancient history books really well as well. 

Via Negativa by Daniel Hornsby - The main character in this book was a retired Catholic priest seeking out another Catholic priest who he knows to be an abuser. Interesting perspectives on faith and life. Very fun at times. I enjoyed it. Worth it because it was a short, low commitment read. 

What the Hell Did I Just Read by Jason Pargin - I love the John Dies at the End series so much. This one was probably my least favorite of the series. He addressed the character of John being a substance abuser which, while touching on a really important subject, was kind of a bummer in what I thought was going to be a fun pallet cleansing read. It also ended a lot more abruptly than the other books in the series and didn’t have the hilarious epilogue that the others usually do. Still fun and still glad I read it. Will definitely pick up the next one in the series. 

Black Woods Blue Sky by Eowyn Ivey - She’s an incredible author and one of the great nature writers of our time. While somber, this was an excellent book and very much a sensory read. Highly recommend for lovers of the outdoors. Don’t expect to feel warm and fuzzy. 

Indigenous Continent by Pekka Hämäläinen - I read Lakota America by the same author and really enjoyed it so picked this one up when it came out. His thesis is basically that the various indigenous nations were sovereign nations on par with European colonizers for a large part of early colonial history and that the myth immediate European hegemony in North America doesn’t really stand up to historical scrutiny. He does a good job of arguing this as well as demonstrating the British consolidation of power that lead to this dynamic changing and how the American empire became primed for genocidal expansion. Worth a read if you’re into indigenous history. Dense. 

April

Jamie MacGillivray: The Renegades Journey by John Sayles - A work of historical fiction in the middle of the same period covered by Indigenous Continent. This one was a lot of fun. It dealt with wars of succession between the Scottish and English and how that was connected to Habsburg politics, colonial history and a lot of other stuff. It dealt with themes of slavery, indentured servitude and colonialism. Also just a really fun adventure read. Very much a historical epic. Highly recommend. 

Law, Liberty, and the Constitution: A brief History of the Common Law by Harry Potter - Not that Harry Potter. I found this very interesting. Traces the thread of how Anglo-Saxon customs for resolving property disputes evolved in the legal system that formed the basis of UK and American law. Kind of esoteric but I really really enjoyed it. 

May

The Boy and the Dog by Seshu Hase - I had to put a dog down this year so this one hit close to home. A fun but not light hearted look at the role dogs play in our lives. I enjoy translated Japanese works. 

The Habsburgs by Martin Rady - Delivered what it promised. The history of the Habsburgs and their impact on history. A deep interest in Spanish history has lead me to follow a lot of threads that lead to general European history and this was one of them. 

The Pale King by David Foster Wallace - AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

No but this one was good it was just excruciating. A book about the importance of really boring work. It drove the point home by being really boring. The book was published from unfinished work after Wallace passed away which I think contributed to how hard it was to read. Still some really excellent thought provoking passages. I’m glad I read it, I’m glad it’s over. 

Oak Origins by Andrew L Hipp - A book about oak genetics. I work in conservation so it was an interesting read but this was definitely not light nature reading. 

The Great Warming by Brian Fagan - I had high hopes for this one and it was kind of a letdown. The central thesis was about how medieval climate change had a big impact on history but the way the evidence was presented was loose and anecdotal at best. The book had a really big scope but wasn’t that long. Kind of poppy. Is also somewhat old and our understanding of climate change science has advanced quite a bit since it was written. Would probably give it a miss and look for something more recent. 

June

The Keep by Jennifer Egan - I have nothing nice to say about this book. This author is clearly skilled at writing prose and absolute dogshit at writing story. A bunch of random events leading up to what would have been a decent and shocking twist had the story not left the reader so indifferent. Straight to the used bookstore with this one so it can find another victim. 

Sometimes a Great Notion by Ken Kesey - I loved this book so much. It was such a fun ride.  A must read for anyone in the Pacific Northwest and definitely for anyone in Oregon. Perfectly captures how it feels to live in Western Oregon. Also perfectly captures how it feels to live somewhere with extreme weather. 

Rome Before Rome by Philip Matyszak - Not super in depth. A fun book to read with your coffee in the morning. A brief survey of early Roman identity. Lots of illustrations. 

White Protestant Nation by Allan J Lichtman - A history of the American conservative movement. Fairly enlightening about we’ve arrived at this point. Interesting to see just how long conservatives have been pushing the same stuff and using the same tactics. Weirdly left me with hope for the future. A little dated as it was written during the Bush era.  

July

The Anglo-Saxons by Marc Morris - Delivered exactly what it promised. An interesting history of the Anglo-Saxons. A more in depth look at some topics covered by Wickham. Written for a non-historian audience. Worth the read if you’re interested in the topic. 

Is a River Alive? by Robert Macfarlane - I need to stop falling for books like this. Another book that asks way to broad a question (Is a River Alive?) and then attempts to kind of answer it with broad anecdotal evidence. Very poppy. I may be highly critical because I work in river restoration. I was expecting a legal/cultural survey of the topic and instead it was basically a travel journal about 3 rivers. To the used bookstore with it. 

The Deluge by Stephen Markley - not a feel good read. You could call it speculative sci fi I guess. A fictionalized account of the coming chaos caused by climate change. Chilling at times maybe a bit sensational at others. It’s worth a read. If you liked American War by Omar El Akkad you’ll like this one. 

August 

How to Read Water by Tristan Gooley - This one was okay. Again, it delivered on what it promised. Literally a book about how to interpret signs in water and navigate and that sort of thing. 

Winter Counts by David Heska Wanbli Weiden - Basically a crime thriller by a native author but it offers perspectives on native history, the challenges faced by indigenous peoples, and life on the reservation. I enjoyed it a lot. Definitely worth the read. 

The Lady and the Unicorn by Tracy Chevalier - I loved this one. It’s just the fictionalized story of the making of some famous tapestries. A really fun medieval slice of life story with well written characters and a cool setting. 

Reassessing Jewish Life in Medieval Europe by Robert Chazan - Dense but very interesting on a topic I wasn’t that knowledgeable about. I felt like I learned from it. Worth the read if the topic interests you. 

September 

Byzantine Matters by Averil Cameron - Kind of a meta read about Byzantine historiography. Went over my head a touch as I felt it was written more for historians or at least people who are more knowledgeable of the Byzantines which I am not. Not a good place to start on the topic. Still interesting. 

The Foundation Trilogy by Isaac Asimov - I really enjoyed these. Just good works of sci fi. I imagine people either like them or the don’t. Not much more to say. They’ve been out for 70 years so I don’t feel like I need to give much of an opinion. 

The Last Sane Woman by Hannah Regel - This author is SO TALENTED. I shouldn’t have liked this book as much as I did but her writing was incredible. About a Pottery student who becomes obsessed with the letters of another potter written in the 70’s. Traced the parallels between the two lives and deals with obsession and identity. Not super eventful shouldn’t have been as good as it was based on how I’m describing it but honestly I will pick up every book by this author going forward. 

The Green Ages by Annette Kehnel - this was an interesting read about sustainability in the Middle Ages. I felt like what it claimed to be about was a bit lofty but it was still a cool but maybe not comprehensive survey of medieval life ways that covered the lives of the peasantry in a way that isn’t often done. More about economics and economic systems but honestly that’s probably true for sustainability. 

October (Spooky Reads) 

Cloven Country by Jeremy Harte - A fun read about Devil-related place names in the UK. A lot of devil stories and some anthropology around that. A fun book if you like folklore. 

The Reformation of the Sixteenth Century by Roland H Bainton - Another book which offered exactly what it advertised. A detailed and fairly fair survey of the topic. Interesting if the topic is of interest to you. 

The Woods All Black by Lee Mandelo - A good piece of queer/trans horror. This book was good but also very horny. Some of the weirdest sex scenes I’ve ever read. I described it jokingly to a friend as furry porn but that’s maybe a bit unfair. 

I Gave You Eyes and You Looked Towards Darkness by Irene Solà - I fucking loved this book. Translated from Catalan. This is the second book I’ve read by her. Like the first it takes place in the Pyrenees and covers a long timespan. It features ghosts and hints of historical events as well as witchcraft and the devil. I would read this authors shopping lists. She’s incredible 10/10 cannot recommend enough.  

A Natural History of Empty Lots by Christopher Brown - I also really really enjoyed this book. I work in conservation and have spent a lot of my career in very remote places close to wilderness. I’ve only just recently moved back to a fairly populated area. As my career has progressed I’ve become a lot more interested in urban conservation as I’ve started to more deeply analyze patterns of land ownership, land use, and who has access to nature. This book was really vindicating as the author focused on fragments of nature that are hidden in plain site and often ignored. The author is a lawyer and takes a very modest approach to the topic admitting that he is not an ecologist. His writing is fantastic and the book stays within the breadth of its scope really well. I highly recommend this one for the urban dwelling ecologically conscious folks out there. 

Howls From the Dark Ages - An anthology of medieval horror. Various authors so I got varying levels of enjoyment out of each one but in general really enjoyed the book. Fun for fans of horror and fans of medieval stories. 

November

El Evangelio de las Anguilas (The Gospel of Eels spanish language edition) by Patrik Svensson - Given to me by a Spanish cousin. A very interesting and personal read about eels and what we do and don’t know about them. Cool to read about something that still remains a partial mystery to science. Part scientific, part memoir, it was an easy and enjoyable read. 

Trask by Don Berry - Another must read for Oregonians. A very interesting work of fiction about a real historic figure living on the Oregon coast during the earliest years of white settlement. Interesting and largely respectful representation of the coastal peoples it was an interesting picture of pre-development Oregon. It made me want to hike. It also made me feel very cold at times. 

El Generalísimo by Giles Tremlett - A lot has been written about the Spanish Civil War but not as much (at least in English) has been written about the 36 bad years that followed it. This was a very personal read for me as my grandmother grew up under the dictatorship and my great grandfather fought on the losing side of the civil war and was subsequently imprisoned. Franco’s ultimate cozying up to the United States resulted in US military bases in Spain and that’s why I exist. This was also just a very good book on the topic and super comprehensive. Giles Tremlett also wrote ghosts of Spain which is another good read on modern Spanish history. Highly recommend. 

December 

The Rebel Angels by Robertson Davies - I love Robertson Davies. I had to read Fifth business in High School and ended up really enjoying it so a few years ago (12 or 13 years later) I went back and read the entire series. This is the first book in the Cornish Trilogy. His writing is excellent and the book spends a lot of time poking fun at academia and academics so I really enjoyed it. Attempted to read it once before shortly after graduating grad school but it turned out to be too soon. Picked it back up last month. 

Alindarka’s Children by Alhierd Bacharevič - This book was written in Russian and Belarusian and is very much about language so to get the language differences across the Russian was translated into English and the Belarusian was translated into Scots. It was a very interesting read and kind of a twist on Jack and Jill. Very difficult to read at times because of the language. It was kind of a slog and I felt like some of it went over my head but it also felt like an impressive work. 

Assyria by Eckart Frahm - An interesting history of Assyria making the argument that it was the first true empire. It covers a lot of historical ground but was quite a good and accessible read. The author does a good job of discussing different historical arguments and interpretations. Some interesting historical overlap with the Bible sometimes corroborating sometimes contradicting. A good history read that made me want to read more history from that time period. 

Gem of the Willamette Valley by Edward Loy - A history of Albany, Oregon (guess where I live). Pretty good for a local history. Learned a lot about the town. Filled me with some pride. Was also cool to get in depth history of things I see daily and places I work. Probably not interesting unless you have something to do with this town. ",5,1767339889.0,52book,0,1.0,False
1q1sn3m,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1q1sn3m/sever_the_static/,Sever The Static,"Crickets make peaceful company; a lulling ambience to soothe the quiet side road, where a girl can puff another smoke, wondering what lecture Chief's gonna bark come morning.

But my night was only beginning.

The dash radio didn't just crackle to life - it sputtered in jumbled, inaudible pieces. I assumed the worn-down piece of shit was broken as I flicked away my butt and slogged back to the door, but I barely had time to sit down when a man's voice slipped through the garbled static.

""*10-33, all units! \[static\] 10-33, all units, please, I'm-*"" Something was wrong with his voice. Each burst of static carried a different version of the same man; layered, varied tones out of sync.

""*Swallow Coast is \[static\] Swallow Coast is gone--Swallow Coast is... wrong \[static\]* *PLEASE, MY*\-""

The voices then stumbled together into a single, dead tone and repeated the same phrase over and over.

""*help us*""

Then it broke apart again, overlapping into a shattered mess of protocol codes, before cutting off to a null silence. My hand was halfway to the volume knob, trembling; I'd heard panicked officers be shot at before, fighting to speak, but never had I heard *anything* like that.

A glitch? A ghost? A dream? My mind raced down every avenue, but a single ugly detail kept pecking at my brain.

'Swallow Coast'

Training kicked in.

""Dispatch, 3-Adam-12,"" I said, my voice sounding far steadier than I felt. ""Copy an unknown 10-33 that just came over my in-car. Unidentified officer, no call sign, giving location as 'Swallow Coast.'""

I stared out at the empty road.

""Be advised,"" I added, forcing the words out, ""I don't show a 'Swallow Coast' on any local grids. Can you run a trace on the transmission?""

I released the button, and the radio went back to dead air.

""3-Adam-12, Dispatch here."" Her voice was calm, but there was a hesitance to it. ""We've got a hit.""

""Go ahead, Dispatch.""

""Signal's bouncing off the east repeater, origin somewhere off County Road 17, past marker 22."" Papers rustled faintly on her end. ""Be advised that stretch is... it just *ends* out there.""

I squinted through the windshield, trying to picture it.

I'd patrolled that road a hundred times.

""Dispatch, confirm. You're telling me an emergency call came from the middle of nowhere?""

""Affirmative. How do you want to proceed?""

I glanced at the black stretch of highway disappearing into the trees, and took a deep breath.

""Dispatch, show me en route.""

I flipped on my lights and pulled back onto the tar, my headlights carving a narrow tunnel through the ensemble of timber. The silence became a pressure; the radio a faint, constant open breath as I ran the familiar stretch.

""Dispatch, 3-Adam-12,"" I said, ""Confirm last known origin was off 17, past marker 22.""

""Affirmative. You should be the only thing moving out there.""

The terrain began to climb; the highway curled along the flank of a mountain in long, sweeping turns where only a guardrail stood between me and a steep drop. When the trees broke, I caught glimpses of it - the pale smear of the heaving Pacific.

By 21, the air had turned damp and cold, seeping in through the vents. My GPS started to lag - a little car sliding over green nothing. I frowned, tapping the casing with a knuckle, when the weather-beaten marker 22 lurched out of the shadows.

I parked beside it.

Fifty yards past the marker, veering off the road and into the wild on a narrowing, overgrown trail, the path, as described, stopped.

A hard, abrupt gravel edge.

""Dispatch, be advised. I've arrived at origin-""

The speaker exploded into unrelenting noise.

Not static, not feedback - voices; a hundred of them at once, slamming into my ears. Snatches of jingles, movie lines, sitcom laughs, news anchors, late-night preachers, kids shouting over commercials, pop songs, intimate phone calls; every recorded sound I'd ever heard stacked on top of each other, out of tune.

Out of time.

""-*copy that, over and out--he's looking at you, kid--baby, don't hurt me, don't--breaking news tonight as officials--wake up, she's here*.""

""Dispatch?!"" I snapped, one hand clamped on the mic, the other white-knuckled around the wheel. ""Dispatch, I'm experiencing a malfunction! Do you copy?!""

""*-late night deals you won't believe--please, if anyone is there--this is not a test, this is an emergency broadcast*\-""

Something thudded softly under my foot.

The brake pedal sank half an inch.

I hadn't moved my leg.

""No...""

I stomped down, hard. The pedal met resistance - then, bit by bit, pushed back against me.

The gear lever clicked.

PARK - REVERSE - DRIVE

""Dispatch, I-""

""-*we now return to your feature presentation*\-""

The cruiser began to roll. Slow at first, just a whisper over the gravel as I slammed my foot on the brakes, and it shrugged me off.

The wheel didn't budge either as the car aligned with the void ahead.

I twisted the key out!

Nothing!

A canned studio audience roared out from the radio, drowning out a weatherman promising clear skies and a man's ragged voice yelling, ""*They cut the road, they CUT THE ROAD-*""

I grabbed for the seatbelt, and the latch clicked, but the strap wouldn't release - remaining locked across my chest.

I hit the door handle, but it bounced against the damn frame.

""Come on!"" I spat, slamming my shoulder into it. Fruitless.

The car rolled on, patient and unbothered by my efforts.

A hoarse male voice cut through the layers.

""*Please-if anyone-I've got a daughter in*\-""

Static chewed him up and vomited him back out as a game show buzzer.

""-*wrong answer, but thanks for playing*\-""

""Stop,"" I murmured, my nerves becoming shot.

Far ahead, at the very end of the light, something began to take shape. It was a dense patch of shimmering thin white; a near-transparent wall where empty air should've been.

Fog, I told myself. Except fog didn't sit flat.

Forty yards.

The wall resolved into a smooth sheet of glitching white-and-black, texture-less, depthless static. And beyond it - for just an instant - I thought I saw the orange smear of streetlights.

""-*you are now entering--the following film contains--they said the sky was wrong--don't touch that dial, you're gonna get us all*\-"" The radio begged, pleaded, sold me detergent, laughed at its own jokes, as the distance between bumper and curtain shrank.

Thirty yards.

Twenty.

""Stop the fucking car!"" I yelled, losing all professionalism as I hammered the windows and wheel, the horn blaring weakly amidst the radio's storm.

""-*ma'am, you need to remain calm*\-""

""SHUT THE FUCK UP!""

The glitching veil loomed in, filling the windshield with nothing I had a word for. I clawed at the seatbelt, desperate - jump out, climb out, do something, anything, but go through whatever that was, yet my fate was inevitable.

So I did all I had left.

I squeezed my eyes shut and braced.

And the car rolled in.

All sense of direction vanished; the seat fell away under me, then jumped back up, and my body felt like it'd plummeted through an ice sheet beyond physics.

Every voice on the radio hit a single, piercing note.

Then silence - a quick, surgical cut into the noise.

My ears popped as the world slid back in, the car coming to a stop, and after I realised I was still breathing, I slowly forced my eyes open.

The dead-end road was gone. In its place was a wide, slick street glistening with rain; lined with buildings, flickering neon, and a diner with a crooked 'OPEN' sign. A distant pier lamp swung over black water, and, carving its way up a mountain path, was a brass-and-steel observatory gazing at the stars.

On one corner, a street sign hung from a rusted pole.

'Swallow Coast'

I finally got my hands to move and reached for the gear shift, expecting the same resistance. It moved willingly, but the engine was dead; as was my radio. I was, however, able to free myself from the seatbelt and sprang out of my powerless cruiser, feeling sick and cold on wobbling legs.

A pickup truck stalked behind a pale sedan, headlights still faint, like they were running on memory. A hatchback rested at an angle to the curb, its front tyre up on the sidewalk, attempting to flee. Closer, a cruiser from a foreign department nosed into the intersection - its pattern like mine, but the crest on the door was smudged, like vandalised paint.

They were empty. Forgotten.

""Dispatch? Are you there?""

...

I walked towards a military Humvee, hunched closer to the diner, olive metal dulled by grime. A faded stencil on the door spelt 'U.S Army', but the unit markings beneath were the same as the cruiser. The passenger door hung open.

I peered in.

No gear, no duffels, no guns; just seats, and the impression that its occupants simply evaporated. The sedan had a purse on the driver's seat, its contents scattered: a wallet, receipts, a cracked phone frozen on a family photo, the seatbelt slack and twisted, the engine cold.

I turned back the way I'd come, towards where the road should've cut.

Instead, the street sloped gently upward until it met a structure that did not belong here. At first, I mistook it for a cell tower, but it was a makeshift lattice of metal and cables - antennas speared out; dish arrays, spiralled coils, panels that hummed faintly with colour. Wires as thick as my arm ran down into a fenced-off outpost bristling with control boxes and blinking lights.

I had to crane my neck to see the beacon at the peak - a red light flashing randomly.

Behind the tower, barely, hung the 'thing' I'd driven through.

From this side, the veil was much thinner. Instead of a static wall, it was more like distorted glass - a wavering, curving slice of sky that didn't fit.

More vehicles sat at the base, facing the shimmer; unquestionably military, rusting and rotten, all pointed at the same impossible curtain.

The tower then hummed as if waking up, and my radio sparked to life - coughing out a single, wailing tone that stung my ears and rattled my teeth.

I didn't notice it immediately, only catching the structure in the corner of my eye as my head pounded, but up in the mountain, the observatory *shivered*.

From the street, it looked textbook - a crown perched atop the rocks with domes and spires winking like old coins, highlighted by either its own gleaming light or what they caught from the stars.

Yet under the signal's pressure, the whole building shook.

Then the first **rip** happened.

The observatory spasmed and snapped, as if a cursor were trying to drag it across a screen; it remained in place, defiantly, but it became distorted, as if shifted through eras. For a blink, the glass was cracked and dark, the brass tarnished, and entire sections hung loose, like something blew it up from inside.

My radio climbed another notch, drilling through my jaw and violating my skull.

The observatory jerked again - now under construction.

Floodlights bleached the mountain path, support beams and half-built walls cast shadows across the rocks; domes became webs of hollow steel, and cranes hung over the whole scene, jittering and flickering as the sky seized from night to day to night again. I could almost hear construction noises - shouted instructions, the clatter of tools, the whistling of men.

I fell to my hands and knees, a trickle of blood oozing from my nose.

Everything was vibrating.

The observatory stuttered once more. It burned.

Orange triumphed inside the central dome; flames beat metal, smoke rolled up in a thick column, but didn't behave right - freezing, lagging. Something within it pulsed white-hot, brighter than any heat I'd ever seen, as my vision blurred, and the road under me melted, then hardened, becoming dirt and snow and magma. I tasted metal in the deepest recesses of my throat as my radio reached a pitch I didn't think was possible.

The observatory tore a final time, but not just the building.

The sky above split open.

A hairline crack at first - a tiny, jagged, thin line - that widened in wild jumps, tearing and stopping, until a gaping wound hung over the mountain.

A scar of colourless deep, where stars were packed far too close together - undiscovered by any astronomer.

They didn't twinkle like jewels. They blinked like eyes.

A pungent waft of burnt electricity rolled down the mountain and filled the street, as my radio became another chorus of relentless sound.

""-*entrance. logged*\--*all units, hold the line, do not approach--test the alert, damn it--alpha, requesting permission to--swiper no swiping--praise be, brothers and sisters--pay separate shipping and handling--if you or a loved one has been diagnosed with cancer--observatory team, do you copy--what the FUCK IS THAT THING--top 10 cartoon themes, number 3 will--this message will repeat--he's still in there--side effects may include dizziness, nausea, loss of self, existential dread--what have you done, boy*\-*-we are here LIVE from Swallow Coast where it seems a-*""

The radio cut out, damning me into another empty silence as the ripping of space stopped, my vision returned through harsh blinks, and the observatory clicked back to normalcy. I scrubbed trembling hands over my nose and lips, wiping away blood, and considered curling into a ball right there on the road among hollow cars, until the next signal came and fried my head to putty.

What in God's name had I done to deserve this?

""*Ellie...*""

I didn't believe I'd heard them at first, my ears and head still clearing the pain, but as my composure slowly crawled back, I realised someone was trying to talk to me over the radio.

""*Ellie--you there?*""

Not a gurgle of madness, but a sane, deliberate attempt at communication; still not just a lone voice, but several, concerned dialects - never repeating - of varying ages and tones, taking turns in between statics.

""-*click receiver \[static\] alive--just breathe, girl \[static\] not alone-*""

I jabbed at my radio.

Click.

""-*copy, she hears \[static\] the diner \[static\] equipment--trust-*""

A new voice slid in between them, low and bitter.

""-***you're not going anywhere***\-""

""-*cut them out! \[static\] ignore--scared--not one of us-*""

I forced my thumb down, my voice raw and scratched.

""Who are you? What the fuck is this place?""

""-*pocket \[static\] failed test--caught signal-*"" A child's voice flickered in. ""-*they turned it on, and it never turned off-*"" Then a soft old man. ""*-observatory is unstable*\-"" Then a calm, hurried woman. ""-*held it as long \[static\] can't get up--you can-*""

""What?! Me?! Why, what did I-""

There was a beat of overlapping sharp breaths, pleas and begs; then a gentle, older woman.

""*-sorry, sweetheart \[static\] your car \[static\] radio--a line in \[static\] can't lose-""*

\*""-\****chose you*** *\[static\]* ***lab rat***\-""

A squeal of feedback, then the calm woman again.

""-*reaches further \[static\] every breach \[static\] spreading--understand?*""

Finally, a man.

""-*doctor \[static\] seen it--outside \[static\] right place, right time \[static\] guide you--move, now \[static\] shut it \[static\] free us-*""

The channel fluttered, then steadied into a song of tangled encouragement, praise, and laughs and cries, and faint, drowned-out screams.

""Okay,"" I said, more to myself, seeing no other choice. ""Tell me what to do.""

\-

The closer I got to the diner, the more the streets had been terraformed into a military foothold.

Another Humvee crouched half a block down, choking the roads; cracks inched across its windshield, then retreated, like the glass was deciding whether or not to shatter. Farther along, a gloomy, armoured truck sat with its back doors open. Inside was empty, save for a single dangling headset swinging in still air.

A few steps from the truck, they'd planted a miniature radio tower. It was no taller than me - just a braced mast bolted straight into the earth. At its base, a metal shoebox hummed faintly, LEDs frozen mid-blink.

""*-repeater-*"" a measured, academic voice said over my radio. ""*-node--jam the \[static\] cage-*""

""Didn't work?"" I asked.

""*-not for long-*"" a regretful woman answered.

Beyond it were two tripod rigs, their heads pointed towards the street.

Except the mounts weren't guns.

The closest carried a cluster of speakers - flat, hexagonal panels arranged in a honeycomb, each one mottled with a mesh of tiny holes, ringed with melted plastic. The path directly in front of the speaker array was scorched in a perfect cone, not by heat, but by... absence. There was no grit, no oil stains, just a smooth, blasted-down layer of reality.

The other tripod mounted a lamp. A fat cylinder with cooling fins and nested lenses, tagged with a warning label - UV ONLY. The beam was off, but a faint violet tint clung to the terrain it aimed at.

""*-light--burns \[static\] sound--stuns-*""

""*-****calibre*** *\[static\]* ***severs*** ***the****-*""

The unwelcome voices were diluted out again.

""Who are they?"" I asked, inspecting the tripods. ""The ones you keep shutting up?""

""*-fractured \[static\] dangerous--uncooperative-*""

A low sandbag wall braced the mouth of a nearby alley. Riot shields leaned carelessly along it, their viewports spangled with neat, clustered cracks.

From here, the alley tightened and dead-ended against a brick wall painted with peeling graffiti, but the air above the sandbags bent wrong, like I was looking through a fisheye. I took one cautious step closer and saw, for only an instant, the suggestion of another street cutting across the wall: cars nose-to-ass, a bus shelter, the swarming of civilians, a billboard in a language I couldn't understand.

A second layer of another town, out of alignment.

Then I blinked, and the alley ended with a wall again.

""*-don't go in there-*""

""Yeah, no shit.""

The radio chuckled - a quick, nervous ripple of different laughs.

Ahead, the diner waited.

The windows stuttered worse than the Humvee - intact, webbed, blown out - and the OPEN sign rolled through the wrong sequence - O P N E - before becoming abstract symbols my eyes slid off. It hurt to look at. The foundation was stitched with bullet holes; casings littered the ground - little brass maps charting where soldiers had stood and fired, and fired again, at something that left no trace.

""What were they shooting at?""

My question was met with silence.

Then, the bitter voice - softer now.

""***Us*** *\[static\]* ***not enough***\*-\*""

My hand brushed over my sidearm.

""*-inside, Ellie \[static\] tools-*"" the kind woman urged, ""-*survival*\-""

The bell above the door rang three different times as the smell hit me.

Decay - old, dried out, folded under dust and chemicals, and burnt coffee and fried grease soaked so deeply into the walls. The stuttering was horrid: seats went from cracked red vinyl to bare springs and torn yellow form, then back again; menus flickered in and out of existence, and a jukebox danced between models. Tables had been shoved around a central aisle, their legs braced. Cots crowded the floor - army-issue frames sagging under mattresses, sheets twisted and stained, and a portable generator cowered near the counter, its casing open; wires spilt out like guts, threading through ammo crates and jerry-rigged equipment.

I saw him then.

He sat in the last booth, facing the door. For a moment, I thought he was asleep - chin tucked, shoulders hunched, but the details became apparent.

The soldier was almost a skeleton.

Brittle fatigue clung to him; his uniform stiffened by dust. What skin I could see was like parchment, pulled tight over bone in sunken hollows; his dog tag had fused with his collarbone, the metal nesting in a little crater where his flesh had given up, and his jaw hung loose, teeth bared... a man exhausted from screaming.

His hand still cupped the air near his temple, fingers frozen around a missing pistol, a dark crater in the booth's backrest staining where the bullet had gone - a grainy, pixelated splatter.

My stomach knotted.

Two objects in front of him offered themselves to me.

The first was a flashlight, stubby and industrial with a wide, dark lens ringed with faded warning tape. The other was a compact speaker; one side a grid of tiny holes, the opposite a switch.

A worn voice breathed out on my shoulder.

""-*good man--kind--brave-*""

I cleared my throat. ""Yet he died alone.""

""-*better that than \[static\] lost in--signals-*""

I reached out for the pocket speaker.

""-*careful \[static\] tuned-*"" the academic voice muttered.

""For what?""

They all spoke at once, a tangle of the same answer.

""-*to be louder than them*\-""

I placed both tools in my belt.

Then the soldier's skull tilted, vertebrae creaking, and my heart lurched; hand flying to my sidearm, but it was only my disturbance of the table that moved him. I breathed a sigh of relief and steadied my pulse... when *his* radio came alive, a clunky handset clipped to his waist.

It did not speak; it hissed.

""-***LEAVE IT ON*** *\[static\]* ***GO HOME, GIRL***\*--**YOU'LL KILL US**\-\*""

My own radio crackled in sympathy, and my company interjected, but they were suddenly faint.

""-*Ellie \[static\] focus--don't*\-""

The soldier's radio overpowered them, its volume spiking.

""-***NOT*** *\[static\]* ***THE FIRST PIG*** *\[static\]* ***THEY LIE***\*--**THEY SENT ALL**\-""\* a sobbing child's voice warped through ""-***WE HURT*** *\[static\]* ***DON'T TURN US OFF***\*-""\*

Both radios screamed - a thousand voices mashed together.

""*-ELLIE, GET OUT OF--FEEDBACK--COMING*\--***found you***\--\*try--\*\*\*\*RAM IT, BURN IT--\*\*\**speaker--****kill your radio****--****KILL YOURSELF****--don't touch*\--*not whole anymore--angry--****STILL HERE****--****STILL FEEL****-""*

It was a thrash of sound - threats, pleas, curses, prayers, all ground together - that ached my head. I didn't hesitate. I reached for the portable speaker, flipped the switch, and my world tunnelled as it squealed a deafening wail. The generator hiccupped, the overhead lights burned and burst, the jukebox lit up and spun through songs too fast, and the dead soldier's radio cut off as his body slumped forward.

Then there was only silence as I found myself alone in a dark diner, the speaker hot against my waist.

My own radio crackled twice, confused.

""*-Ellie?!*""

Then it too failed.

And for the first time, Swallow Coast was truly quiet.

The diner's own sounds quickly crept out like insects: the creaks of booths adjusting to no weight, a slow, patient drip from somewhere in the kitchen, the soft, intermittent hum of the neon sign outside. Breath left my lungs in slippery, shaky exhales, as I fidgeted with my radio - not willing to accept this loneliness as permanent.

*Ding*.

The bell above the front door chimed.

Once. Perfectly.

*Ding.*

Again.

The door didn't move, but the sound was thicker this time - as if underwater. The air near the entrance wobbled, just a fraction, as I drew my gun and the flashlight.

*Ding.*

The doorframe trembled in place, smearing sideways in short, nauseating skips, then bulged and rippled and flattened, and *something* pressed through it.

Familiar broken nonsense reached me first.

""*-don't touch that dial, we'll be right with you \[flatline\] you're about to start \[phone dial\] one woman, one night, lost her friends \[Windows Startup\] coming up: a local officer goes \[sirens\]* ***skinned and flayed***\*-\*""

The idea of a man began to materialise, cobbled together from a disjointed static mass of flickering grey fuzz; his chest strobed between suits, hoodies, bare skin, hospital gowns, and his face was layers upon layers over a vertical slack - an old man's profile, a child's wide eyes, a woman's gaping mouth mid-scream, a teenager chewing gum. They swam through one another, never syncing, each countless expression trying to dominate the other; far too many crammed into the same outline.

Every time he moved, pieces of him lagged behind at different frame-rates or spasmed into mundane tasks, as a radio snow flaked off his edges, popping and disintegrating into nothing. He stepped into the diner (if you could call it that), tearing out of the door, the sounds of his feet were complex, dry keyboard clicks dubbed over with car doors, gunshots, soda cans, and a microphone. The air bent around him, violating the space into an elongated, glitching funhouse.

Then he looked at me, and all the mouths in his head smiled.

""-*anomaly. found-*""

On intuition, my thumb pressed the taped switch on the flashlight, and a solid, bruise-dark violet bar erupted and hit the 'man' square in the chest. The result was instant. Touched by the light, the static went from grey to a blistering, overexposed white and orange - then burned brighter than the sun. Pieces of mismatched people peeled back like melting film, bubbling out of existence, as a dozen borrowed eyes flared and scowled.

A film-trailer voice gulped mid-sentence, dropping a few octaves, and a jingle stretched into a thin, digital scream as the air around it pulsed back several inches toward normal. The creature staggered, raising its jittery, convulsive arms to shield itself; the mosaic of broadcast it used as skin blackened where the beam stayed, edges crisping and curling, as it *roared* \- a remix of half-sponsored messages and corrupted sound bites scratching in my ears.

It tried to advance, lugging a step towards me, so I fired.

The bullet hit where the UV light had already cooked its form, right in a raw patch of boiling static, but instead of a clean entry wound, reality tore as its flesh blew open in a geyser of white noise. I saw inside it: frames of other places, hallways, headlights, an operating table, someone's bedroom - swirling past the hole in a blur. The bullet cut through them all, dragging a comet-tail of glitch with it, as the creature convulsed. Every piece of it slipped further out of sync; faces morphed into a screaming collage, several arms twitched in delayed directions, its outline ballooned, as a bomb of sound erupted from it - hurling me off my feet and into a table.

Its body blew outward like a grenade. Static detonated into a jagged sphere, shredding through tile and chrome and glass, as half the diner's wall ceased to be - ripped out of space.

Then it fled onto the street - a teleporting, slithering mass of pained static - before vanishing into the night, leaving a brief, untextured trail of vertigo-inducing grey in its wake.

The OPEN sign outside flashed a new word in between blinks, letters stuttering into place where they didn't belong.

'LIVE'

I stumbled outside, head and heart pounding, and leaned on a car that wasn't quite there.

Six months on the force, I had my first domestic.

Second floor of a shitty apartment, end of the hall, number already flagged for 'prior incidents'. Neighbours had reported shouting and a crying kid, so Dispatch tossed me over. A young woman met me at the door, red-eyed with a polite smile that didn't match her shaking hands.

'He' hovered in the kitchen.

No damage, nothing broken, no visible injuries, no kid; just a raised voice and overreacting neighbours.

My gut whispered that it wasn't nothing - the way she glanced at him before every answer. But policy pays no mind to 'gut feelings'. I took their statements, handed over a pamphlet, told her she could call us anytime, and I went home to a warm bed.

But then I went back.

Again.

And again.

*And again*.

Different days, same apartment, same rushed apology; same look in her eyes, same break in her voice. Yet every time, *every time*, things looked just calm enough to walk away from.

The last callout was quiet. No shouts, no cries; the neighbours said the silence concerned them more. The TV was still on when I entered.

She was on the couch, eyes raw, long gone from this world.

While He hung in the bedroom with blood on his hands.

I did everything by the book on that one. Got told it wasn't my fault, but I knew better. I'd walked away from that mangy little home plenty of times when my instincts told me not to. So when a radio asked for help from nowhere, from a place that didn't exist, I knew my mind would've been made up.

Atonement, maybe.

I think that's why I saw her little face amidst a gunshot wound of white noise and broken static. Not angry or sad, merely... watching. Judging.

Wondering if I'd run away again.

The second **rip** came without mercy.

The observatory didn't only shake this time - it imploded. Invisible, folding billows sped down the mountain like shockwaves, crashing through the forest and impacting the street, splintering everything they touched, breaking structures apart and rebuilding them in the span of thoughts. I watched people spawn in and out in different styles, from various decades; kids on bikes, soldiers in masks, tourists with cameras, walking through each other, through me, through anything that was or wasn't there.

Then I saw myself.

A multitude of Ellies, scattered through the maddening mess, with torn uniforms and guns drawn or not even a cop at all, running for their lives, praying on their knees, walking their dogs, staring up at the sky, and the waves kept coming; time and space buckled, reformed, then buckled again, as my insides began to crawl out of my body.

I thought this would be my end, lost in a paradoxical typhoon - reduced to an unexplainable phenomenon - but then, somewhere inside the chaos, the worst of it calmed, and my radio spat out a ragged word.

""-*climb*\-""

My ghosts had returned; a familiar, comforting patchwork of timid, exhausted voices.

""-*mountain path \[static\] with you--brace \[static\] up*\-""

\-

Astronauts describe walking on the moon as a mix of 'magnificent desolation', with stark beauty and intense light, but also a sense of indescribable wonder and adventure - a trampoline bounce in low gravity, as Earth hangs in a jet-black, starless sky.

I wondered how such trained, privileged adventurers would describe wading through Hell, as my first step onto the gravel-caked, rotting wood landed seconds before I did, the ground buffering under my weight. The path ascended fast, shouldering into the trees; a nervy strip of nature that couldn't settle, while the leaking observatory hung above it like a bad omen.

Out here, the equipment was different.

Instead of jammers and tripods, the hardware along the path had been built as a fence. Short pylons stood in rows on either side of the trail, no higher than my hip, drilled straight into the roots. Between them, lines of invisible pressure danced in the air, catching the moonlight in wrong ways.

UV lamps the size of flares were cradled in the metal, their light pointed not at the town, but out into the trees; burning clean wedges of bleached bark. Cinderblock speakers squatted between the lamps, their faces singing in frozen sound.

There was a thick grain of slow-moving static just beyond the barrier. Shapes heaved just past the reach of the light, packed shoulder-to-shoulder along the mountainside: loose silhouettes, glitching outlines, people and not-people slow as sleep. Blank faces drifted in and out of the gloom - dozens, maybe hundreds.

Every few meters, a pylon pulsed weakly, and the nearest shape flinched, restrained under some pressure I couldn't see or feel, but *hear*.

A containment of light and sound, wrapped around the path and beyond.

But it wasn't perfect.

At the very start of the trail, two pylons had been dragged just enough out of alignment - their cables snagged, their housings cracked. Between them, the air sagged, and the invisible pressure caved inward. Occasionally, a fleeting crack would appear, and a grey hand would slither out, flickering between nails, metal, and bone. It clawed at the gap, pushing through, when the nearest UV canister coughed out what strength it had and blistered the hand into white-hot confetti.

The crack would seal, temporarily.

I understood how one of them could've escaped.

My radio gave the softest click.

""*-walk quiet--trench line-*""

Soon, I stopped just short of the observatory, in a car park of grand, curated scientific study sprawled with white tents and MOCs - their terminals still running.

Up close, the building was disappointingly ordinary. It was never the problem.

Every instrument they had up here, every setup, their endless arsenal of gadgets, faced the mountain - hooked up with cables and sensors, like a giant patient in need of surgery.

What they monitored was not a shape, but a wound in geometry - an impossible prism of light moulded into the granite; blooming edges of colourless bursts, a radiant malfunction of stuttering angles, and vibrating in horrid, wiggling wretches, blasting out waves of energy that spilt into the town below.

""*-woken--vessel* *\[static\] you see \[static\] crashed--stuck*\-""

""How do I turn it-""

""-***we remember you***\-""

The others made no attempt to silence their fractured comrades, who then spoke with unrivalled clarity.

""*You shot them. Bold. Most get scared*.""

""What're-""

""*All of them. Every wave. Look*.""

My eyes glazed over the protruding vessel.

It shimmered, in perfect sync, with every word.

""*People do not belong in here. Release them*.""

A myriad of colours oozed from its hull as it tried to phase out of the rock. A bastion of obelisks amidst the ground, the first line of defence wired to the MOCs, matched its rainbow display in tandem.

""... how?""

""*One of the terminals. Shut it down. All of it. Please*.""

Before I could move, a gabble of noise stumbled up the path behind me, replacing the cadence of commercials and cartoons with clipped military channels.

""-*Alpha to F.O.B \[Beep\] field log corrupted, retrying \[Buzz\] do you have any idea what they're doing up \[static\]*\-""

My boots skidded as I bolted to the nearest terminal. I slapped keys and snapped a cursor through unreadable fields and thermals until a green menu stared back.

\> NODE: OBSERVATORY

\> STATUS: UNSTABLE

\> COMMAND: \_ \_ \_

""*End.*"" Said my radio.

""What?!""

""*Command. End*.""

I glanced over my shoulder at the rippling air and oncoming chatter as the thing took shape. It had changed uniforms, shifting through combat gear and lab coats, then blue hazmat suits and armour.

""-*hey! who's there?! \[static\] are we authorised for this \[static\] greatest breakthrough of our species, and you wanna get cold feet \[static\] subject: persistent-correction required*""

\> COMMAND: END

I nearly slammed it in.

And the world popped.

For a breath, there was no sound - only a pressure change. Then, every electronic in sight croaked dead at once. The speaker on my belt sparked and flung itself off, dissolving. My flashlight exploded, ripping through my flesh with jagged pieces and a violet burst, falling me to one knee with a yelp.

Then the mountain screamed.

The 'vessel' flared and ripped itself free, tearing the stone like it was wet paper. Granite peeled and crumbled, scaffolding and cables snapped, trucks flipped several feet into the air and phased through the ground. The prism wrenched itself out in a spray of dust and broken light, took a single, staggered look at its reeling saviour, and then, in a single jump... it was gone, a streak vanishing straight into the sky.

From the veil I had driven through, a quake detonated - a rupture rolling in on itself like a sheet, becoming a towering wall of static-white, reaching the clouds, that erased everything it touched as it volleyed towards us.

*Us*.

The pain in my leg had distracted me enough to not realise the static man was still here, still advancing.

""-*final state pending \[static\] final state pending \[static\] final*\-""

I drew my pistol and emptied every bullet, but without the UV light, it was like shooting a fog. Round after round pinged through its body, absorbed by glimpses of rooms, of other skies, and it kept coming; now devoid of any features remotely human.

I reloaded with shaking, bloody hands and fired again until my gun clicked.

The encroaching white wall swallowed the base of the path, then the observatory, as the entity reached for me, its many hands smearing into my face as a glow washed over its shoulders... and I closed my eyes.

The wall took us in a single, enveloping surge.

Then there was nothing at all.

\-

""Ellie?""

I knew his voice; he sounded amused.

""You still with us, kid?""

I opened my eyes to find myself on a stretcher, a paramedic tending the bandages around my leg, and a wrinkled hand in front of me snapping his fingers.

""Helloooo? Earth to Ellie?""

I was still at the observatory; military equipment had been replaced with a police presence and some suspicious vans, their open doors revealing cargoes of narcotics. Punks were slammed onto the hoods of cruisers, cuffed, and shoved into back seats.

An older, grizzled cop looked down at me, one arm in a sling.

""I... what?"" I stammered out.

""Did she hit her head?"" He asked the paramedic, and I knew then where I'd heard him before -  an officer who radioed a 10-33.

""She lost a bit of blood, that's all. Give her a minute.""

Behind them, a news crew assembled. A redhead reporter chucked away her cigarette and rustled her hair as her cameraman counted her down.

""Are we ready? Cool-We are here LIVE from Swallow Coast where it seems a brave batch of officers have made history in one of the largest drug busts Oregon has ever known-""

I drowned her out, rubbing my temples.

Marcus was his name, who insisted on escorting me back to my car despite my demand to be alone. Every step, I felt sick. I expected the sky to tweak, or a shadow to lag behind me - *something* leftover.

Instead, Swallow Coast looked like any other town.

The diner wore a fresh coat of paint and boasted a health-inspected 'A' in the window. A teenager replaced a dead soldier in the end booth, wiping down tables, earbuds in; the only radio noise was a pop station whining about breakups and summer love.

If I tried hard enough, I could almost convince myself that I'd hallucinated the whole thing.

Blood loss from shrapnel?

Stress?

Almost.

Until a select few sounds hit my ears the wrong way, my newfound tubby friend paying no mind to my tiny flinches. Eventually, we reached my cruiser - still 'parked' at the edge of town, where a friendly mechanic fiddled inside the hood, finalising his work, overlooked by an old cell tower.

""How's she looking?!"" Marcus barked.

He looked at me. ""Ah, she'll drive, but your precinct needs to upgrade your wheels. This thing's a fucking relic.""

""I'll keep it in mind,"" I said, suddenly very eager to drive far, far away from this place.

But Marcus wouldn't allow that, oh no - not until he'd said goodbye. He watched me slide into my driver’s seat before planting himself in the doorway, leaning nonchalantly on the roof.

""You sure you're okay?""

""Yeah, fine.""

""If you say so, hero. And don't worry,"" he winked, ""I'm gonna be putting in a good word with your chief-oh, hold on-"" his hand flicked over my shoulder, ""-huh... your radio was off. Weird.""

""Ha, yeah... *weird*.""

""Well, drive safe. And if I ever need backup again, I'm asking for you personally."" He chuckled and made his leave with a hefty wave.

I waited until his shape was gone before shrivelling and collapsing into my seat, my hand snapping over my throbbing chest. Tears welled up fast and I sobbed and fitted like a toddler, until my radio spoke, and I almost shrieked.

""You're back on the system, 3-Adam-12! We thought we lost you! What happened?!""

I composed myself quickly, wiping my face.

""Uh... my car, um-... broke, Dispatch.""

""... broke?""

""That's right.""

""Okay... I'll make a note of that. Anything else to report?""

""No, Dispatch. Say, do you-""

""Hold on, 3-Adam-12-"" her attention was taken away ""-right, we've got a domestic the next town over, all local units are busy. Feeling up for it?""

I'd barely caught my own breath as I looked out at the sunrise.

It was unlike any I'd seen.

""I... yeah..."" I rallied myself. ""Show me en route.""",1,1767339884.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False
1q1smp6,https://www.reddit.com/r/PornAddiction/comments/1q1smp6/i_have_never_been_this_down/,I have never been this down,"I am a 18F sex and porn addict. My story goes back to a long way, when i was about 9. The first chapter. I always had a big interest in sex. I loved masturbating very early on, and i imagined a man that fucks me every morning and night. I wouldn't even say fucks...i would rather say making love...loving. i had a normal mindset about it, even tho i was masturbating on this idea very often. But in my mind he was my ""boyfriend"". I never had any sexual interaction back then. After it came porn. It wasn't an addiction at first, what's more, I was disgusted by it. But...after times i would come back seeing it... just because of curiosity...just because i never seen something like this. I couldn't imagine how it feels. I wanted to know so much.

The second chapter is Men. At 12 i was on a anonim chat site, where you could write with anyone until you want without knowing anything about them. This 25 yo man was the first i had months talking to about sex. He would say he will loose my virginity after we drink a cup of coffee. I was turned on but scared at the same time. I just wanted to know how it feels. It continued with a lot of case like that without meeting. But one time, i met someone. I was 14. He was 29. We had sex in the forest in his car. This happened two times with him. After he left me with a feeling of betray and i felt lost. I was. But...this darkness just got deeper and i was sinking. I slept with more men while developing a porn addiction and relation addiction at the same time. They always change each other. I cannot have a week without having sex or watching porn. 
I did have normal relationship, where it got better but after it ended i got back to my bad habits. 
Third chapter
My recent partner is cheating on me with talking to others, and use abuse and violence to keep me addicted to him. I dont love him anymore, but i still cannot let it go. I would watch porn even in his presence. I would go for bad stuff, hard stuff, and say him fantasy that i know makes him turned on, but for me it brings jealousy. Even i am also turned on by it, i know i dont really like it. It is very hard to explain. I dont want to watch porn anymore. I see the effect on my mind: not being able to fantasize alone, not being wet with only playing with myself, having too much thoughts and also being too ""dirty"". Someone please give me an advice, i dont know how to stop it. If i feel horny or bored i just go there and search something.
My life is messed up. I do nothing. Just these two things

My life got messy because of my impulsive behaviour and porn addiction i dont know how to get out. I tried many times but always got back",2,1767339842.0,PornAddiction,3,1.0,False

1q1skdb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1q1skdb/friend_believes_the_entire_group_is_hanging_out/,"Friend believes the entire group is hanging out without her, but we're not. AITAH for matching her aggressiveness in a text back?","I (F 30) have a friend (F 30) who I met through my husband's group 11 years ago. She was always one of my best friends, and we did a lot together. But time moves on and unfortunately we're not seeing all of our friends every weekend like we used to back in college or high school. And physical distance has made things harder between us as well, she's over an hour and a half away, and with our son and our jobs it makes things difficult. I've still seen her since he was born where I drove to her, and I text her a lot, even thanked her and her future mother in law for making our baby a blanket that we used in a Christmas photo shoot. I asked her out for coffee on my maternity leave too and she just doesn't respond. She's also a bad texter, so it's not uncommon to be left on read for a few weeks at a time. So still friends, but not seeing one another as much as we used to.

Fast forward to a few days ago, and after a lot of people said they couldn't make it to a hangout she is hosting (where we RSVP'd maybe due to our son being sick a lot since he started daycare), she sends this to every single friend in the friend group individually, even the ones who said they were going and to some friends that she just saw and spent time with:

""Hey, I’m canceling the hang out I had invited everybody to. I know you are very busy in your lives but I’m getting exhausted in trying to put so much effort in spending time with you only to hear you guys don’t even consider me in planning hangouts. 

I feel like I’m not friends with you anymore and that’s probably by design. It’s ok that you guys prefer to move on, it just sucks that the people who I thought were my closest friends no longer even feel like acquaintances. 

I’d love to have a further chat about this, but I understand if you don’t care to. 

I’m glad you guys have the friendship support you have.""

Needless to say, I was so not happy about this. It was aggressive and unwarranted in the tone, especially after I had mad such an effort to see her with a newborn (at the time) and that she doesn't reciprocate that energy. My husband received the same text verbatim. So I spoke with another of my friends (she grew up with my husband and they consider one another siblings, she's genuinely been a better aunt to my son than my own sister) and she said they went out for coffee and hung out recently, and she received the same text verbatim as well! So she told our friend that she was hurt that she thought they weren't friends and that she guessed their hangout recently didn't amount to much? But to let her know how she wanted to proceed with the friendship because that text was confusing and hurtful. Our friend said that it wasn't her, she was just in her feelings because ""everyone seems to hang out without her.""

Now let me set the record straight - this group of friends has about 15 people in it, including everyone's significant others. Everyone lives at the closest 45 minutes away, which yeah distance doesn't always matter in a friendship. But everyone has been busy with their own lives from marriage and family things, to homeownership, and genuinely interests change. Were not all hanging out every single weekend like we used to anymore. Some of us just don't talk at all unless we're at a big hangout together. But we make things count where we can. I'll be honest, every year she would throw the best murder mystery birthday parties, and even if I had to rearrange plans, I would still go because it was her and I loved seeing her.

The only exception is my friend who is like a sister to my husband. We see her and her husband maybe once every other month. Otherwise it's a lot more family stuff, more quiet gatherings with no riffraff, and very occasionally (meaning once since my son has been born almost 6 months ago) I'll invite a few friends over from my group who is local last minute for a game night if we don't want to be cooped up in the house alone for the evening. I'm sure we could extend the invite to our friend who feels left out, but she and her fiance always have an excuse not to come to stuff we host. We always have to go to them and they always insist it's a potluck. We can never just sit and talk or grab a coffee or drink, meeting halfway is out of the question. It must be at their house and it must be a potluck. Or it must be local to them.

I felt like she was making assumptions where she shouldn't be, and that she doesn't seem to get the ideas that 1) we're not all purposely excluding her from anything, 2) we're not all spending every single weekend together without her, and 3) that life moves everyone in different directions so being able to text or make a phone call or grab a coffee and catch up might be what we have to do to stay in contact sometimes.

She seemed very aggressive to me in that text and I was stewing on it for a couple of days. Some friends responded and she clapped back. Some friends are deciding not to respond because it's really immature what she's doing and they don't want to waste the energy. They feel that if she's trying to burn bridges then she can. Me? Oh I was hurt and angry. I wasn't going to let her get away with blaming everyone for not spending time with her when it's a two way street. So I matched (and went farther) in my tone and I really told her to check herself.

I told her I guess that her leaving me on read since the middle of December, me taking my newborn to see her and spend the day at a park outdoors, me always asking her for coffee and to meet halfway and being met with ghosting or rejection, and me telling her maybe to her next potluck hangout because of my sick son were all very clear reasons we shouldn't be friends to her (note sarcasm). I told her no one is hangout out without her and no one is plotting evilly to spend time together specifically without her. I told her to get over herself and finally understand that no one is seeing each other like that anymore. And if she's upset that I'm hanging out with my husband's ""sister"" who has changed my son's diapers, who has showed up for us more than any of our friends, and who literally grew up with my husband and they were each others man of honor and best woman in their weddings, then what kind of friend is she to be mad at me and my husband only and not my husband's sister about it? I told her I don't get upset when she and my husband's sister spend time together. I support it and friends can hang out in smaller groups too. I said she needs to get her act together and figure out what she wants, because her text was not about saving friendships, it was to start a fight. She hasn't responded yet.

She’s controlling but acts like she isn’t. She’ll just keep asking you the same thing over and over to try to wear you down to get her way or she’ll try to use guilt. There have been many things that happened. I think in her head, everything is fine, but she tests my boundaries and thinks I don’t notice. She sent my husband a creepy video about how sons are meant to take care of their mothers last time I saw her, and also slowly walked towards her car with LO (she had him in her arms to say goodbye, we were walking her out) and kept saying “Are you coming home with me?” Then proceeded to let him play in her car for a while. I won’t let that happen again. I invited her to coffee a couple of times to give her a Christmas present since we decided to spend Christmas on our own, and she declined for different reasons. Then last minute says she wants to see LO before Christmas. We said sorry that won’t work we’re busy. I’ve decided to go low contact and have not reached out to her since. Now she’s sending the flying monkeys. I’ve just gray rocked. Any thoughts on what to say to her when she inevitably asks why I haven’t reached out? I’ve basically decided I’m dropping the rope and no longer going to be responsible for maintaining the relationship. I do not plan to explain any reasoning to her as we’ve tried that in the past and it doesn’t work. She’s very selfish but acts like she’s not. She’ll act like the victim and completely caught off guard by my sudden pull back, as if I’m somehow required to let her see LO once a month or more. Honestly, she and her husband are so emotionally unstable and covert controlling people (she totally wants to be the matriarch of my family, totally tried to “firsts steal” LO’s first bath). She firsts stole Disneyland with my sil’s kids. When the fallout happens, I want to be ready. We’re expecting an emergency or crisis to happen to try to pull us in, but I’m more worried about when she tries to call me out on not reaching out to her or inviting her to do stuff. She’ll say she hasn’t invited me because she’s respecting my wishes and giving me space, which is BS because the pressure is always subtly there. ",7,1767339605.0,JUSTNOMIL,4,1.0,False

\- i don't have to manually time my shots the machine would automatically stop  
\- much simpler to use overall but i like the extraction process and i dont mind either machine

Cons -

\- Grinder isnt the best

Following is the author's post on Linkedin:

*Firstly, thank you to everyone for the response to my now-extinct yet omnipresent article published in Express Tribune titled ‘It is over’. The article was taken down for reasons unknown to me. I believe I may have violated certain guidelines of the newspaper, for which I profoundly apologize to the entire editorial team at Express Tribune. They have always published my work and gave me a voice when no one else did.*

*That being said, I received hundreds of emails, DMs on Instagram (long live gen Z, I despise emails too) and LinkedIn messages praising my work and calling me courageous. I assure everyone, I did not mean to be this courageous, I write for fun and most of the times, the truth seeps in amongst the cacophony, either intentionally or intentionally. It’s all fun and games because the best lessons are taught layered in humor.*

*However, my work was subsequently quoted by certain politicians on social media and mass media, making it suit particular narratives, narratives I did not endorse. Let me reiterate that I do not hold any political affiliations because my views don’t go down well with anyone. My article ‘It is over’ was based on my personal observations, my views and my take on things. I do not carry disdain against anyone, there is enough hatred in the world, truth is always controversial.*

*They say you shouldn’t read too much or else your knowledge becomes your enemy. I am nowhere near knowing enough, there are smarter people out there than myself.*

*I will reply to each and every message I received. I have also gotten various requests for interviews and podcasts which I will reply to shortly and maybe hop onto a podcast soon (if my mom allows). Please don’t consider my work to be courageous and bold, I am as brittle and timid as everyone else. My only strength is my brain and my pen and hopefully, none of that gets taken away anytime soon.*

*I was happy to see young people reach out and really agree with what I said. I think my words have left an impact and I will continue to do so (if my mom allows)because they can take everything away but not your thoughts. To the youngsters, my advice is to please read, please write and please question everything.*

*In the end, I’ll leave you to this quotation. Kevin Strom said “****To determine the true rulers of society, all you must do is ask yourself this question: Who is that I am not permitted to criticize?****”.*

1q1sih2,https://i.redd.it/wf1h18eg3wag1.jpeg,"I messed up my skin trying new products… here’s what finally helped (long post, honest experience)","I wanted to share this in case someone else is going through the same spiral I did.

A few months ago, I tried switching to some new skincare products that were “supposed” to be great for sensitive skin. Instead, my face completely freaked out — redness, small inflamed bumps, constant irritation, and that uncomfortable tight-burny feeling that never really went away. I stopped everything immediately, but my skin just… wouldn’t recover.

I went to a local dermatologist first. Tried topical creams, calming ointments, even pharmacy-recommended anti-inflammatory products. Nothing really changed. The inflammation would calm for a day or two, then flare up again. At that point, I was honestly getting anxious every time I looked in the mirror.

I started blaming myself — maybe I ruined my skin barrier forever? I even cut out dairy, sugar, coffee… basically everything I enjoyed. Still no real improvement. That was probably the most mentally draining part: doing everything right and seeing zero progress.

So I did what most of us do — went deep into Reddit, forums, and reviews. I kept seeing people mention microneedling with exosomes / Juvelook for barrier repair and inflammation. At first, I was terrified. I’d never done any aesthetic treatments before, and the idea of needles on already sensitive skin sounded insane.

I also read mixed experiences — some people said it worked wonders, others said it didn’t help them at all. That honestly made me hesitate even more.

But after weeks of reading real experiences (not ads), I realized one thing:
Most of the “bad outcomes” came from either wrong skin assessment or poor aftercare. And the ones who had good results all emphasized choosing the right clinic and doctor.

That’s when I decided to look into clinics in Korea. I found one that focused heavily on skin barrier recovery and anti-inflammatory treatments rather than aggressive procedures. What really reassured me was that the consultation was very detailed — even before going, they reviewed my concerns, asked about my routine, and didn’t push anything.

When I arrived, the process felt calm and structured. The doctor actually listened. He looked at my skin closely, explained what was happening (basically barrier damage + inflammation cycle), and suggested a combination of gold microneedling, Juvelook and ldm treatment, but also made it clear that results wouldn’t be overnight.

That honesty alone helped me trust the process.

The treatment itself wasn’t as scary as I imagined. Uncomfortable, yes — but manageable. And more importantly, it didn’t feel rushed or careless.

I’m still in the recovery phase, but the inflammation has gone down significantly, my skin feels more stable, and I’m not constantly panicking over every tiny reaction anymore. It’s not a miracle overnight fix, but it finally feels like I’m moving in the right direction.

If you’re dealing with reactive skin and feel stuck, I totally get the fear and hesitation. My biggest takeaway: don’t rush, research deeply, and choose a place that prioritizes understanding your skin rather than selling a quick fix.",1,1767339414.0,KoreaSeoulBeauty,0,1.0,False

Conservation efforts focus on preserving the remaining habitats and understanding the population status.

At this point, this stupid fucking show is my emotional support background noise. So here is my latest take on The Other Way, because wow… I have a LOT to say.

Consider this me choosing peace instead of arguing with hospital equipment.

Johnny and chloe

Johnny and Chloe are the perfect example of a 90 Day vacation romance being mistaken for real life. Chloe is wildly privileged, has zero survival skills, and somehow thought moving to Aruba with a man she barely knows would just magically work itself out. She cannot boil an egg, a gas stove scares her, and instead of learning how to live she just takes him out to dinner every night like she is still on a resort. She claims she left a six figure job at her mom’s company yet arrives with no savings and no plan which makes the math extremely suspicious. Johnny is both more stable than she gives him credit for and also very red flaggy, because while his house and living situation are solid by Aruban standards and genuinely not the issue, he still gives scammer vibes and the control dynamics between them are immature and tit for tat. It is wild for Chloe to tell him to quit the exact job she met him doing because that pirate ship is not a hobby it is his career and lifestyle. Neither of them figured out immigration, work authorization, or long term logistics before she moved which is honestly impressive in the worst way. This is yet another classic case of having two stupid people in a relationship.This is not real love yet, it is vacation love, and once real decisions need to be made Chloe is going back to the U.S. and Johnny will become a wild chapter she tells at parties to seem fun and quirky. L

Sumit and Jenny

Oh, Sumit and Jenny. How long are we honestly going to keep doing this. I used to root for them because it felt very Bollywood, star crossed lovers fighting against the odds, and I’m glad they made it through all that, but the problem is you cannot have two stupid people in a relationship and expect it to work. One person can be a little clueless, fine, but these two are helpless in the most pathetic way possible. Jenny has been in India for close to a decade and still doesn’t know the language, the currency, how to make change, or basic cultural norms, and she relies on Sumit for absolutely everything, which at this point is just laziness, not age. She seems deeply depressed and stuck in this perpetual sadness that drags everyone down, and watching her be unable to handle a simple coffee station with one English speaking customer was genuinely insane. Sumit, meanwhile, is doing what he has always done, trying to make his parents, Jenny, and himself happy at the same time, which has never worked and never will. He has big ambitions and a lot of opinions about what he deserves, but no real plan to get there, and that disconnect is exactly why they stay stuck in this exhausting  lloop. They clearly love each other, but love alone cannot fix two people who refuse to grow or take responsibility for their own lives.

Manon and Anthony

When it comes to parents on the show, I try to show a little grace because I don’t have kids so I can’t understand that dynamic. Especially for someone like Manon that is clearly going through some postpartum issues. Manon and Anthony make no sense, and yet somehow they kind of do. Anthony clearly pushed the move to France, and I swear Americans romanticize Europe like life magically fixes itself there, but it doesn’t. He doesn’t speak the language, doesn’t know the culture, and has zero plan to sustain his family, while Manon—the breadwinner, entrepreneur, and mother—is being dragged into a situation that gives her full-on visceral anxiety reactions. Moving to France makes no sense when they  could have stayed in the US, downsized, focused on her corporate work, and still co-parented like millions of people do. Anthony seems to live in a fantasy, dimming her light while thinking he’s “saving” the marriage, and his timing, passive-aggressive energy, and inability to plan are infuriating. They clearly love their son and want this to work, and I have to give them grace for that, but watching them stumble through decisions, fight at the worst possible moments, and basically be disasters together is exhausting.

Greta and Matthew

Greta should honestly sue Jane Austen’s estate for filling her head with this ridiculous English countryside romance fantasy because that’s clearly what she thought she was signing up for with this buffoon. I already spoke about this, but I truly despise Matthew. This idiot makes her move across the world, doesn’t pick her up from the airport, can’t even clear a few shirts for her in his bedroom, and instead of flowers or compliments, calls her “stinky” over and over again after she just traveled sixteen-plus hours to be there. She left her career, her friends, her cat (temporarily), and all of her life for him, and he gives literally nothing back. she fell in love with the idea of this perfect English romance, only to realize four days later that he is a child with the emotional range of a teaspoon. I think Greta was more in love with his parents and the idea of this perfect family in a cottage in the countryside. She is chasing something more than love. She is chasing a family because of her complicated history. His parents seemed like such kind and intelligent people. I don’t know how they got this fuck ass son. I have the same disdain for him as I do for Laura’s Michael (B4 90 day) —both are pathetic, close to human participation trophies, and expecting gratitude for existing. I am glad it only took her four days to call it quits, and I am very glad she’s back home with her cat where she belongs.

Pattiya and Dylan

Where the fuck are they finding these people? Pattiya is 58 and still an exotic dancer dating Dylan, a plumber and failed singer-songwriter who somehow turned his entire personality into perfect human with nothing going on behind the eyes. She has built her entire persona around being a chaos monkey to seem fun and quirky, but all it does is trap her in endless messy situations she has to claw her way out of. Dylan is a huge control freak but he masks it with his perfect personality and this perfectly curated, manufactured life that he likes to lead on the outside. He is okay with stripping but not okay with her stripping and claims it is because of the easy, fast money, which is partly true, but mostly this man is just Dylan, and it is his world and we all just live in it. He picks up his mother’s calls whenever he wants and acts like everything revolves around him while pretending to be authentic. Pattiya wants him obsessed with her and to be the sole source of his joy and she is insanely jealous of his mother for existing. She is chasing acceptance and attention, which explains why she has been stripping for 37 years and why she has stayed in a 12-year on and off relationship with a man 20 years younger. She is desperately seeking validation in all the wrong places

Luke and Madeline

I almost didn’t want to talk about Luke and Madeline because what the fuck is there to say about a man who lets a 19-year-old run his life? Like Luke’s dad said “I’ll send you a pair of nuts for Christmas” because I really think he needs them. Him and Nutella Nails truly deserve each other. These two are class A grifters playing up for the camera, clearly trying to be the next Jasmine and Gino, but Madeline is not nearly as smart as Jasmine. Luke looks like someone who takes life advice from ChatGPT and Madeline looks like someone who takes advice from nobody except her underdeveloped 19-year-old brain cells. This man let a teenager bully him into quitting a good job, making stupid fast money investments, moving to Colombia, giving her a helicopter wedding dream, and spending his dad’s last three thousand dollars on a deformed designer dog. Their priorities are all over the place and they are both deeply disturbed people clawing their way through life with zero planning or foresight. Luke gives fake tech bro vibes, makes the stupid pyramid hand sign, and calls himself an entrepreneur, while Madeline is obsessed with beauty but does a terrible job taking care of herself. Somebody on this sub pointed out she looks like Luke’s dad and now I can’t unsee it. They bring out the absolute worst in each other, love the toxicity, and somehow keep going back for more. I have no idea what he sees in her, and honestly, they are two people trying to be reality TV stars who just come off as deeply unintelligent, impulsive, and fully unprepared for anything resembling real life.God makes them and they find each other.

TLDR:

Johnny and Chloe: Vacation love meets zero skills and zero planning, privilege collides with red flags, chaotic and hilarious.

Sumit and Jenny: Two helpless people stuck in a Bollywood-style loop of love and dysfunction.

Manon and Anthony: incompatible, disaster-bound, love their kid but can’t adult together.

Greta and Matthew: Fantasy English romance meets emotional toddler, cat wins, she bounces.

Pattiya and Dylan: Chaos monkey meets control freak, attention-seeking forever, messy and exhausting.

Luke and Madeline: Toxic grifter couple perfectly matched in stupidity, impulsivity, and disaster.

I just wanted to share this story. I took some creative liberties and changed some of the details, but this is my true story. It may look like a creative writing piece, yes, but it’s my real life.

I also changed the names.

I don’t know how to begin this. But I just want to tell what happened between me and Ian. We were together for six years and three months. It wasn’t easy. It wasn’t simple. But it was real.

I met Ian on a dating app in 2017. I was 27 then, he was 21. I thought it would just be a one‑time thing. But he was different. Quiet, careful, but wonderful to talk to. It felt like he had depth.

On June 4, 2017 — we were lying in bed at his apartment, the electric fan spinning, silence all around. He asked me: “Do you want us to be together?” I just held his hand. I nodded. That’s where “we” began.

But we weren’t like other couples. On my side, my family knew him. I brought him to my friends. But on his side… nothing. It was like I wasn’t part of his life. My name never appeared in his stories. My picture wasn’t on his phone when he was with friends. We had to walk on opposite sides of the street so no one would notice. At the mall, we texted each other while walking separately. At parties, I stayed outside. I was like a ghost in his life.

Even so, I loved him. And in his own way, he loved me too. There were nights he would call just to say, “Take care.” Days when he sent food to my house. I helped him with schoolwork. Even when he went abroad, I still did some of his homework — editing essays, making slides, proofreading papers. Even when I was tired from work, I did it. Because I loved him.

In our fourth year, he left to study and work abroad. He said, “It’s just long distance. We can handle it.” So we tried. Video calls, messages, late‑night chats. But slowly, things changed. Replies came less often. Calls grew shorter. I thought he was just busy. I didn’t know he was already talking to someone else.

April 2023, he came back to the Philippines. He didn’t tell me. No notice. By September, he finally messaged me. He said, “I came home last April.” Then he admitted he was already with someone else — the man he had been talking to while abroad. It hurt. Like my heart was ripped out.

We didn’t talk for months. I focused on work. I became office staff, then a call center trainer, then an executive at an NGO. But even with all the busyness, every night there was sadness. Something missing.

Then one day, he messaged again. “Can we talk?” We met in Cubao. He was thin, pale, quiet. He said, “I was left too. Cheated on. Replaced.” He cried. I didn’t blame him. I just said, “You’ll get through this.”

From then on, we became friends again. Not immediately, but slowly. Some days were awkward, some questions still unanswered, but we chose to talk. We chose to help each other.

I helped him look for a job. I edited his resume, sent applications. When he had interviews, I reminded him. Sometimes I even printed his biodata at 7‑Eleven because he didn’t have a printer.

I accompanied him to medical exams. I drove, I waited. Some days were scorching hot, but I stayed. I just wanted to make sure he wasn’t alone.

Then one day, a diagnosis came — TB. He started treatment, but as time passed, he wasn’t getting better. As an HIV educator, I had a hunch. But I didn’t say it right away. I didn’t want to scare him. Still, as weeks went by, I grew more worried.

One night, while we were in the car heading home from the clinic, I asked, “Ian, do you want us to check other possible reasons?” He was quiet. Then suddenly he said, “Noel… if ever I want to get tested… would you be the one to do it?” I nodded. “Yes. Me.”

The next morning, I brought him to a private space at the NGO office where I worked. I set up the test kit myself. I put on gloves. I cleaned his finger. I pricked it. I dropped the blood on the test device. And while we waited for the line to appear on the strip, we sat in silence.

When the result came out — reactive — he didn’t speak. Neither did I. We just stared at the small device on the table. Time felt frozen.

He looked at me. “Is this positive?”

I nodded. “Yes.”

He cried. Not loudly. Not hysterically. Just quiet tears. He looked exhausted. Broken.

But I didn’t leave him.

I helped him with everything — counseling, confirmatory testing, linkage to care. I set his appointments. I put reminders on his phone for his medication. I went with him to the clinic for his CD4 count. I asked the doctor about side effects to watch out for. I researched support groups. I brought food when he had no appetite. I stayed with him when he had fevers at night.

I wasn’t perfect. I wasn’t a therapist. But I did it because I loved him. And I knew he needed someone by his side. I didn’t think about whether it was right. I didn’t ask if there would be something in return. All I knew was that I couldn’t bear to see him fight this battle alone.

And even though we weren’t “us” anymore, even though I wasn’t his partner, I chose to be his support.

Now, he has a job in another province. He’s doing better. Slowly, his energy is returning. We’re still friends. Sometimes we have coffee. Sometimes we text. Sometimes we talk seriously.

We’re no longer together.

But there is respect.

There is care.

I live in a college town but on the outskirts of it. So lots of old people around and Germans don't tend to interact much there, as in come out of the house and meet for neighbourly stuff. Now there is just 1 gas station nearby that uses the Too good to go app there. Sometimes I will book the surprise bags which are generally pretty great for value. They give out the excess from their little coffee shop so it's baked goods. Most of the time it is a good haul of like croissants, donuts and some hard German bread. Think tiny baguettes. However, sometimes, they have a lot of them German bread. I buy it only for myself and it gets too be too much. I live with roommates and let them know when they happens so they can share the bread if they wanted too. Eat it themselves or take it for their friends but ultimately that Mitch bread would never get eaten. Like yesterday, I got about 20 of the German breads. And this is along with some sandwiches and croissants. 
Now, my issue is this results in the same thing they were trying to prevent. The bread becomes too hard to eat after 2-3 days and I have to throw it away. 

Could I ask them to not give me 1 of the bags if it's too much? I tend to buy like once or twice a month max, mostly once. And I get the excess like maybe once after buying 3-4 times. I don't want a refund or anything, just don't want to throw away something if they could give it to someone else. There aren't any food banks close by me. And most days I buy the stuff on like Thursday/Friday so I can't even distribute it in the office since I work from home on Fridays. Any advice? Thanks in advance.

Update: Hey, so to answer some replies. I live in like a student dorm and don't have the freezer space to store the bread. I do the wet and heat up for 3 days but even that doesn't finish it. I don't tend to buy from them that often. As I said maybe once every 3-4 weeks. And this excess happens maybe once in like 12-15 weeks of buy that often. And to the reply that said don't take excess food, that was my question. Can I tell them I don't need that much and leave the excess with the gas station? I'm not asking for a refund just for them to keep the stuff since I don't need it.",1,1767338050.0,toogoodtogo,5,0.67,False

Also, my neighbour told me I just need to go in once a day see if he has food and water and maybe give him a treat, and that’s it. That’s all I need to do.

The first few days, he hid under the bed and wouldn’t come out. Slowly, with treats and by just sitting quietly, he started coming out more. Now he’s fully out, takes treats, lies down near me, rubs against me sometimes, and I was even able to play with a toy with him, which felt like real progress, but still, it’s a very short interactions and almost uncomfortable.

There have been a few incidents where he suddenly became aggressive. One time, he actually attacked me and scratched me real bad, it was very quick and I don’t know why. After that, I gave him space and tried to keep things calm.

Another example: after a friendly moment where he ate a treat and finally got out of the bedroom for the first time and followed me to the living room to get another treat, after he lays down calmly on the floor between the living room and kitchen, I tried to stand up and walk to the kitchen. At that point, he started hissing and slowly chased me around the coffee table, clearly agitated, and I had to back away and leave the apartment.

What’s confusing to me is that these moments seem to happen after things feel calm or even friendly out of nowhere. I’m trying to understand if there’s something specific that triggers him, I know nothing about cats. I’ve noticed he seems more relaxed when I’m sitting still, and the aggressive behavior seems to happen when I move around, but I’m not sure if that’s actually the cause or just a coincidence.

I really like this cat and want him to feel safe around me. I don’t know cats very well, so I’m hoping someone can help me understand this behavior and what the best approach  is.",3,1767337896.0,Catbehavior,3,1.0,False
1q1s2ek,https://www.reddit.com/r/PanicAttack/comments/1q1s2ek/my_current_state_what_will_the_future_bring/,My Current State - What Will The Future Bring?,"Im 35 and this is my first time in dealing with panic. I had my first series of attacks through August-October. Life is not the same after them. I was a normal guy, I thought. I had to quit smoking cigarettes, pot, stop drinking and drinking coffee. I stopped my ten year medicine Lamictal because it blocked my nose and made my muscles tense. I think my back pain finally catching up with me, had a primary impact. My dad being constantly depressed from my mom passing last year and me taking care of him, tanked my mental health. I am now trying Lyrica and working out my back, while just trying to lead an ordinary life on a day to day basis now. 

I just wondered a couple things. I get by on a day to day basis and I do believe things are looking up.

The feeling of my heart just going and telling myself 'this is it' on a semi daily basis. I am just laying or sitting, and maybe tense or in an awkward position and my heart feels weird for a second, and i just feel like its going, this is it. I have to move or make sure to just keep breathing through it. There are times where ive just tried to accept it and stay in position, and it doesnt really get better, its extremely uncomfortable until i have to move. Does anyone have this, what is actually going on? What if i accept it and dont move no matter what, has anyone tried that? Will it pass or is there some trick?
I worry that its because of my back. My back, chest, shoulders crack constantly throughout the day. I am working out adamantly on this, but i had no idea there could be this degeneration ive had. Or maybe it is just panic related?

I am 100% averse to negative or sad input now. Any story and any negative emotion my dad shares with me, i immediately go downhill. I cant handle sad things. My breathing becomes short and i just cant take it. This is no way to live. Any other person has a buffer zone, a wall or a filter where they can handle these things without even thinking about it. I used to not even 6 months ago. Its like my filter or whatever it is has been wiped away. What is it exactly, and how will it ever get better? 

Lyrica helps, but it has its side effects and a slight stupor effect where i dont think i can do it forever. I will probably go back to a lower level of lamictal and try daily magnesium for the tension. Ive thought to myself, why not maybe just do ativan and accept the dependence and face that in the years down the road. All i have is anxiety in life, no other disorders. 

Ive tried addressing my vagus nerve, but im like there is only so much i can do for exercise for that. I wont get it 100%, as my neck is honestly my most tense area and its such a peculiar place it cant be fully addressed. 

Overall i am honestly doing better, but those first two points are the main things I am coping with. I am about to get back to work and i have honestly but been isolated for the better part of this year. But maybe ive gathered, this is a process. The road to recovery from panic can take a year or months at least. I also read something that resonated, that after panic, the next year avoiding that feeling again is the most difficult thing.

Sorry for posting as im sure the same kind of thing gets said repeatedly. But this is where im at in life, and any feedback is greatly appreciated.

1q1s2dn,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1q1s2dn/to_my_mil_who_called_me_abusive_and_to_my_mammas/,To my MIL who called me abusive and to my mamma’s boy’s husband,"I’m writing to clarify concerns and expectations for future visits. My goal is not to provoke conflict, but to ensure that (Daughter)’s care and wellbeing are prioritized, and that visits are safe, respectful, and positive for everyone. I also want to provide context on some things that (MIL) and Richie do not know. I am hurt and feel like I am being blamed due to lack of context about (Husband)’s role in this and I deserve to be heard in full.

The recent and prior visit with (MIL) highlighted challenges that need to be addressed. Before and after (Daughter)’s birth, I had requested that (Husband) and I have a few days of privacy after spending a few days with my family to get in the swing of things and enjoy our new family in private. He got mad at me for even asking this and said that you two wanted to come here immediately. (Aunt) and my mom had only seen (Daughter) once (the day in the hospital) and when they asked to stay another night (after traveling 2.5 hours to get there and my mom has COPD and has trouble breathing while she walks), (Husband) raised his voice at me on the phone and said no despite me begging. My mother and (Aunt), who had come to support me, were asked to leave by him the day after she was born. This really hurt me (and when I had brought it up, it was labeled as “criticism”).

At the same time, (MIL) stayed in our home for an extended period—far beyond the originally communicated timeline of November 3rd (when I brought her end date up to (Husband) when she said a morbid, aggressive comment about formula choice, he told me that she had no return flight)—without my consent or consultation. Yet the family of the woman with a rough 24/7 constant medical care pregnancy who actually birthed a child only got to see their grandchild once. When I asked if (Aunt) could stay over while (MIL) was here, (Husband) got mad and raised his voice at me and said no. This created a difficult and stressful situation with my family during a very vulnerable time in my postpartum recovery.

I bring this up because I do not feel understood or heard and I went through ALL of that, putting my needs aside for (MIL)’s benefit, yet I still was treated poorly on multiple occasions making my own safe space uncomfortable. I really didn’t need this treatment postpartum and it’s soured my experience.

I could have used my own mother being there to support me. I will never get that postpartum period back. And it shouldn’t be filled with the guest trying to control decisions (ie even the discussion about goat milk formula which is regulated in America set her off, and same with (Husband) and he yelled at me and (Aunt) for discussing it privately), passive and outright aggression, and screaming, and blaming ME for a “dramatic difference in (Husband)” without considering the MANY stressful things going on (namely, the landlord situation—which (Husband) has rightfully described as traumatizing). I am not responsible for his health and I try my best to help him be healthy but ultimately I can’t make choices for him.

During the recent visit, there were moments where I felt my concerns about (Daughter)’s safety, routines, and our household were not fully acknowledged, met with snappy answers, and framed as anxiety instead of boundaries—a deflection. For example, when I raised concerns about schedules or safety, I was always dismissed or made to feel unreasonable. Advocating for my child’s safety (such as making sure that there is no pasta sauce or coffee grinds in the sterilizer, or removing a layer AS RECOMMENDED BY EXPERTS when the apartment gets too warm), and setting boundaries as a mother is not criticism or abuse—it is part of my role as a parent.

During the visit, I was screamed at and called an “abuser” for only raising basic safety concerns about (Daughter). I was told to “hush” and “be quiet” while trying to advocate for my baby, which left me feeling silenced and unsafe in my own home. I was shamed for my health anxiety. It is cruel to do that to a postpartum woman. I am not abusing (Husband) by making requests about childcare. He and I don’t compliment each other simply because we are going through the motions and I don’t see a need to compliment on basic care. I always say thank you for letting me rest when I need a break due to a low blood sugar, or wrist or previous infected incision pain:

(Husband) was comforted in her arms like a small, helpless child as I cried my eyes out rather than being recognized as an adult partner standing with me. Every time (MIL) is here, I feel ganged up on and shamed. This entire dynamic was deeply upsetting and unhealthy and exhausting, and it compounded the stress of navigating postpartum recovery while caring for a newborn. On over five occasions, (MIL)’s actions or words have made me cry and (Daughter) cried too when she was screaming at me and wagging her finger in her face. ASKS are not criticism. A nurse and a mother should be more empathetic and understanding of the postpartum experience of a first time mom. And even if it is health anxiety related, that is a common thing among new mothers that I am making concrete efforts to address. But mental health shaming in any context is wrong.

Additionally, it was hurtful at the extended November visit when (MIL) referred to my aunt (Aunt) as “aggressive,” despite (Aunt)’s efforts and generosity. (Aunt) has contributed significantly to our wedding and baby—over $20,000–including furniture, supplies, and financial support. Comments like this, paired with the exclusion of my family, were deeply painful and created tension that could have been avoided with clear communication and respect.

The airport incident was particularly upsetting: she insisted on a 5 a.m. flight and refused to compromise, raising her voice and being passive-aggressive toward me when he explained that leaving me alone with a newborn at that hour was unsafe due to severe sleep deprivation. She slept all through the night last night, which is rare (babies cry more when their mothers are in the room) and I can never predict when she will awake. I also have insomnia which makes it difficult to go to sleep at all, hence why I typically stay awake (not by choice). The flight time of 5 AM was not considerate. Also, airport escorts are available and the walk to the check-in counter is short, yet her behavior made the situation much more stressful and exhausting for both me and (Daughter). She was ready to go early but yelled at (Husband) when he brought up wanting to get back to me and the baby, insisting that she was being rushed. For the record, I fell asleep around 4:30 and she woke up at 5:30ish, which left me needing to care for her and feed her while barely awake which is not safe to care for a baby while that sleep deprived. After every thing that has happened, I fully believe that refusing to leave when she was ready to go was to be spiteful to me.",1,1767337763.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

Let me explain... Hal knew that President Rayburn had heart problems. 

Remember in the first season how Billie Appiah made a big deal about President Rayburn drinking coffee instead of tea because coffed sets his heart afib... 

Hal KNEW that by springing on shocking infuriating news to a man with heart problems could potentially give him a heart attack. Hal knew this was a possibility and thats why he did it. Hal wanted President Rayburn to have a heart attack and pass away so that his buddy and accomplice Grace Penn would become President. 

and then remember when Hal has the nerve to blame Billie Appiah for not telling President Rayburn about America being behind the carrier attack... and then remember what Billie Appiah said... she didnt tell President Rayburn about it because she thought it would kill him. 

Hal intentionally gave President Rayburn a heart attack knowing full well that then Grace Penn would become President. 

Its so obvious, in my opinion, that Grace Penn and Hal were in cahoots from the beggining, and then Grace Penn fooled Kate into thinking that Grace Penn had nothing to do with it. 

I heard the term ""useful idiot"" being used a lot in politics lately in the last decade, they take someone high up in politics who is naive and they use them.

Remember Grace Penn and Kate when they were getting ready for the Presidential swearing in ceremony, Grace Penn admitted that she felt responsible for President Rayburns death, he heard what she did and his heart stopped. Then Grace Penn makes Hal her Vice President because that was their plan all along and they were in cahoots from the beggining... 

Prove me wrong... any proof that Grace Penn and Hal were NOT co-conspirators from the beggining???",4,1767337613.0,TheDiplomat,3,0.83,False

1q1ryh2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Letters_Unsent/comments/1q1ryh2/crosswired_minds/,crosswired minds,"does the phrase ""crosswired"" make sense?

the most common expressions I've seen are sadism and masochism, but, c'mon, crosswired. laughs at sad shit. smiles under threat. doesn't like being touched but has no sexual boundaries. crosswired. 

been thinking about this off and on since yesterday- something came up and it was sad, and pathetic, and heartwrenching. and I laughed. was funny but it really wasn't. a desperate plea for attention and connection from a girl who deserved better and a boy who said he wanted to give it to her, over the phone, except the boy was 100 feet away and didn't want to put on a jacket. they couldn't hear each other. and I laughed. because it was all so stupid and avoidable and if they'd have communicated properly it'd have been a ""hey I'm here we're sparking up"" and it'd have been that.

but it wasn't that. and I knew that. ha ha, only serious. serious, but I giggled.

I don't lead with ""yeah gas station black coffee girl's sadistic."" I know that, and I'll mention it if it comes up. but I don't, because crosswired shit's uncomfortable in company that doesn't get it. you have to be, tho, to wield narrative like I've done. you have to learn to savor the hits you took for the right reasons, and to enjoy the feeling of blood in your mouth from the times it was right to bite back. because when you're alone and it's necessary, that's what it takes. 

but the crosswiring's there once you go there. Narrative in general works like that- warping reality's a helluva drug, and only later do you realize you've forgotten how to have a hard conversation gently, after the fire you lit under someone's ass had cooled and they're cooked, chat, then and only then does the long pork start to smell sickening.

it's a catch22. You need to enjoy it because otherwise you're fighting a brutal slog for basic needs and basic consideration that you never, ever get. you're trying to do the right thing but that's always fucking painful, so it's either hurt all the time or learn to enjoy it. and you do both, always. and the iron taste on your tongue is the last to fade after you've put the fangs away.

discipline. poise. the capability to feel the plate tectonics creaking before they shift, to feel the tension of wingbeats on the web, to correct with precise metal every dumpster fire of a person I have to spend long periods in close contact with and to hold my hand to ice until it cracks but does not break. That's how the coffee girl do. The most complete expression of how I have been a tool instead of a person, pun intended.

there's no need to justify, the meaningless destruction. the voices always tell me that, it's how I'm meant to function.

I don't know if I'll ever be able to say this properly, but for me, empathic narrative was where I started, and I find it perverse. I don't use narrative when I can avoid it, but it's always fucking there when it's the coffee girl in the hot seat. i don't know if i can separate ""i am saying this this way because it's how i think i'll be understood"" and ""i am saying this this way because in my twisted machiavellian machinations this is how i can bend the world to a more suitable shape.""

and that's not wrong, exactly, manipulation isn't immoral. but doing it for the wrong reasons is.

sidetracked. crosswired. i find others using empathic narrative fascinating and... squicking. it's like being the person who got made fun of for eating garden snails your whole life and then discovering escargot. oh. it's French.

but i shouldn't be laughing at the plight of others either. 

so. this is me. coffee's cold and bitter and that's intended, the tall glass of water's frozen over and that's the only thing keeping the glass stuck together, and I'll tell you not to eat the cactus fruit in the fruit salad but I haven't exactly removed the spines either. I think this is a reasonable way to communicate, @me because a solid 3/4ths of me's into that for ✨️trauma reasons✨️

And we're not even discussing the persimmon in the room.

idk, when i wrote this i was much younger. and most of it wasn't intentional. a lot of it was. maybe not ""most."" 

it's about hunger, at the end of the day. what hungers do you satiate, and why, and how? i have the taste for narrative but I spit it out for the texture, a rejection of who I am, instead choosing principles and considered action, also a cornerstone of who I am. If you wanted a clearer picture of me as a human bean, I'm sorry not sorry you're getting knots in the cat's cradle. 

i'm just written that way.

LOVED it. And I had to leave out so many things, places and foods due to my rushed itinerary.    
* The people (everyone I had a chance to interact with) were so amazing, friendly and accomodating. I know we are a hated bunch, but faced zero instances of hatred / frustration even in local markets. Even the hustlers.    
* Vietnam to me felt like **choose your own adventure** type. Felt so safe to explore. We would head into some alleyway and find something in some of those places, esp many food gems.    
* **Food** was just yummm. My wife is a picky eater, and it warmed my heart seeing her enjoying so many dishes.  
  
A bit more into my journey:     
* **Hanoi** Started with Hanoi. Stayed in the old quarters. Instant love with this place. The whole vibe - of the buildings, people, hoan kiem lake, various eateries. It felt safe to explore. Loved Truc Bach. Checked out Chistmas celeb as well.     
* **Coffee,food and beer** in Hanoi was just the best. Esp the coffee, even the one in my hotel was so good. Failed to find good coffee later in the trip in other places. Spotted few Bia hoi places, and after having the fresh beer - could not go back to regular ones.   
* **Ninh Binh** was pretty, but it was my mistake just to do a day tour from Hanoi. Easily could spend at least 3 days there. Missed out on so many things. Had my first pho in some random place. Yummy yummy. Skipped Ha long bay this time.    
* **Hoi An and Danang** Stayed just one day in Hoi an. It is crowded but we liked it. The night market, though small, was energetic. Had amazing Banh mi from a local road side shop late at night.  
* Did lot of memorable things in Danang. Explored Son tra peninsula on a scooter! Marble mountians was a cool climb. Had so much seafood.   
* Went to bana hills. I did not expect it, but genuienly enjoyed the viatnamese food buffet.    
* **HCMC** Finally came down to HCMC to check out NYE. This city is on whole other level. First day, to be honest, I could not get on with the flow of it. But slowly caught up to the speed. Attended NYE party on Saigon riverside park. My wife and I were mindblown on how not rowdy all of the attendees were. It was not crowded, music and the whole setup was top notch. Fireworks were decent. A big positive experience.

I dont even know if im allowed to talk about his condition but he is non medicated (he doesnt want to be so I will never force it) he self medicatesn with greenery if that makes sense. Which in general does help. But nothing is 100%. So he flops between a frw different sides I would describe in vagueness as happy, boredom, aggressive, and rarely (to my knowledge) depressive. 

Happy- is the general good feelings, happy times, wanting to engage, be productive, and smiles.

Boredom- I feel like this is also in tie with ADHD where even if he has a billion things to do (videogames, cards, art stuff, etc) he just puts his head on his desk covers himself in a blanket, and doom scrolls (not even watching the videos just infinity scrolls). And has almost no desire to do anything.

Aggressive- hes overly critical, everything he says is right and if you prove him wrong youre an azz for doing so. (Noted this is almost always as he 1st wakes up before coffee and that morning routine very rarely any other time). 

Depressive- he just lays in bed, and in general doesnt respond, doesnt want to get up and doesnt touch his phone really or anything.

I am completely understanding thay you cant control the manic episodes and what they decide to be. I just want to find a way to react that doesnt make me an azzhole, because sometimes he gets aggressive because he thinks im upset with him (whether I am or not is irrelevant im just trying to mend the issue where possible). But its like everytime I want to help I contradict and make it worse. I just want to make it easier to manage without getting myself hurt because he gets critical with me.

But I slowly been gaining the weight back over time and now I weigh between 150 - 160 lbs. this was due to my previous relationship and I am also a truck driver which makes it even more difficult. I have always had a difficult relationship with food specifically sweet stuff like cookies, brownies, cakes etc. Sweet coffees.

I have been considering wegovy and semaglutides in general to lose weight. My only concern is I do not want to take them forever do you guys think at some point I could stop taking them and keep the weight off?",0,1767337120.0,Semaglutide,4,0.5,False

This is the first time I dreamed about this place. It seems to be located within the themepark area. It also has 3 floors.  It also seems like I'm working there as the manager. I have never had a job within the mall world. But here I was running this place. The other employees were all women. At any given time, I think I saw about 3 to 5 women wandering around the place. 

The dream started with me entering the place. I was walking with a woman who was dressed in a business suit. She looked important. she had long straight black hair, maybe it was dark brown and had bangs.  We walked all the way up to the 3rd floor. I had this feeling that we were in some kind of relationship. She made her way to a door, opened it and went into an office and closed the door behind her. This was the last time I saw her in the dream.  The 3rd floor was empty. Nothing up here but wooden walls and floors. a couple of small rooms and a large office. 

I went back downstairs and every time someone walked in, I was able to look outside and see the themepark. I could see a rollercoaster, a carousel, and several other rides. There were hot dog, popcorn and cotton candy vendors out there as well. I never stepped foot out of the coffee shop. It was also noisy out there. The sounds of children laughing and having fun.  The main floor was wide open with tables and chairs spread out. A few people were hanging out here. The walls had wooden paneling. There were also stairs that seem to lead all the way out to the rooftop. A woman walked in and it seemed like she was my girlfriend. We ended up going to the 2nd floor and sitting down on a large comfy recliner. I don't remember exactly what we did or talked about but I do remember what the 2nd floor looked like.

The 2nd floor looked like a study. Tons of book shelfs with tons of books. It was very relaxed up there. The walls were all wooden paneling. there were old lamps on the wall. There also seem to be about 3 of these large recliners along with a two small sofas and coffee tables.  There was also a model railroad train and track that went all around the upper walls of the room. there were these small streams of water that ran along the bookshelves. toy boats would float around them. After a while the place got crowded with children. They were just running around and making a mess. Destroying stuff. I could hear the employees downstairs yelling at them to go away. But they would not listen. I told the woman I was with I had to go and do something. i went downstairs and started yelling that I was closing the place for the day. I yelled at everyone to get out or else. I don't know what I meant by that, but it worked. Everyone left.  Once everyone was gone everyone, including myself, started to clean up the place. There were people at the door trying to get in and I was yelling at them to go away, the place was closed.

The woman I was with said she would see me later and left. I gave the option to the employees if they wanted to close for the day or reopen and continue. They chose to reopen and continue for the day. I opened the doors again and looked outside. I could  now see that beyond the themepark, there was an ocean.  There were a few sailboats out there and what looked like a cruiseship. I went back up to the 3rd floor and went into the office. It was empty and, for some reason, I got bad vibes about being in there.

Anyone seen a Starbucks like place around the amusement park/theme park area that looks like that one I was working at? It was the first time I was even there.",1,1767337106.0,TheMallWorld,0,1.0,False

I (21M) and my girlfriend (20F) decided last October to room in a college apartment with our two friends who were also a couple, Bella and Sean (made up names for privacy). When starting out everything was wonderful, but quickly everything went to hell. 

My roommates for the past few months have been an absolute nightmare. Both of them have rudely dismissed me and my girlfriend and expecting us to just stay in our room at all times, just for them to have other friends over to smoke weed. To make it worse, they don't even let us know that they are bringing people over in the first place! During our finals week at university, they had them over multiple times a day and smoked IN THEIR BATHROOM! WHICH STUNK UP THE ENTIRE APARTMENT!!! Not a single time have they mentioned to us when they're having people over. 

Now onto the people they bring over: THEY. ARE. TERRIBLE. These friends, lets call them Jordan and Hannah (obvi not real names) are complete mooches and are completely not self aware. Hannah is over all the time waiting for weed or food to be mentioned and then begs for whatever ""scraps"" can be coughed up. And when Jordan is over, there is always issue, whether it be with one of us out in the living room during their get togethers, or direct problems with our dog.

3 months ago, my gf and I adopted a dog (M) from a local shelter after talking to Bella and Sean to make sure that there weren't any issues with us adopting our dog. Well issues quickly came up as the like fifth night we had him, when he walked into their room and ate IBUPROFEN OFF OF THE FLOOR! That's right, THE FLOOR. I was astonished, and my gf and I had to rush him to the emergency vet and rack up a $400 vet bill for their stupidity. And, we never even got paid back. The audacity. After this, rules were made, and broken when he was in their care while my gf and I were at work, and he managed to eat 4 dark chocolate cookies at 10pm, which ended up being another $100 poison control bill. 

You would really think that I would be done by now but it gets even worse. Their friend Hannah took a really quick liking to our dog, to the point she called him ""her baby"" and left used blankets all over our house to familiarize him with her smell. This then brushed onto Jordan who one night while extremely high, he tries to PICK UP our dog and I watch in horror as our dog is squirming in his hands, and being held UPSIDE DOWN over the coffee table corner. My gf screamed at him and took him to our room, where they scurried back home like rats.

We have had multiple talks with these roommates about their behaviors and nothing has changed. They even left us all of their dirty dishes for Christmas break, thinking that we would do it for them. 

They possess not even an ounce of accountability for their actions, and its absolutely horrifying.

TLDR: Gf and I living with 2 really bad roommates. Constantly smoke weed with their friends who almost hurt our dog, and have no courtesy for our existence. ",0,1767337077.0,badroommates,3,0.5,False

Adriana Xander had lost track of how long he’d been at. Her body felt like it was falling apart, drowning in lust so intense she could barely breathe. 

Matthew Langford knew her body too well. He hit every sensitive spot with precision. Not a single touch was wasted. He was smooth and skilled. 

“Clear my schedule for the week starting tomorrow. I’m taking time off. Book two tickets *to* Neocoralis.” Finally done, Matthew stood by the bed, slowly getting dressed. 

Adriana shifted her sore waist a bit, her eyes lighting up. “Matthew, you’re taking me on vacation?” 

Matthew paused, frowned slightly, and looked at her. “I’m going with Natasha.” 

The smile froze on Adriana’s face. She lowered her head awkwardly, saying, “Okay, Mr. Langford … ” 

Seeing her pale face, Matthew spoke again. “Adriana, you’re just an orphan. You’re young. I can’t marry you.” 

Adriana looked up at him, forcing a bitter smile. “I never expected you to marry me … But now that Ms. Jones is divorced and back, should we end this affair?” 

Matthew’s face darkened. He rubbed her head, trying to soothe her, and placed a card on the nightstand. “Be good. Buy whatever you want.” 

“Mr. Langford, I don’t want to be a mistress … ” Adriana stared at him stubbornly. She knew he’d marry Natasha Jones eventually. 

“You’re talking too soon. We’ll deal with it when the time comes. Don’t throw tantrums. Whether we end this or not isn’t up to you.” Clearly impatient, Matthew glanced at her one last time and left. 

As the door shut, Adriana’s ears buzzed. She couldn’t hear a thing. 

Adriana was an orphan. Freshman year, her looks drew the wrath of rich girl Mia Langford. The bullying left her deaf in one ear, crushed her pinky toe, and nearly blinded her with a cigarette burn… 

Someone filmed it and posted it online. The scandal blew up. 

The school called in the parents. Standing in for Mia wa Matthew–her brother. 

Maybe it was for the Langford Group’s reputation, maye out of pity, but Matthew reached out to the battered Adriana. The first thing he said to her was, “Dot be scared. I won’t let anyone hurt you again.” 

Spineless. Pathetic. 

Adriana fell for him. At her most vulnerable, Matthew fot every fantasy she had about love and safety. 

She used to think he was her salvation. But now … he didn’t love her. He just wouldn’t let her go.

Adriana placed the coffee in front of Natasha, her chest ching like it was being sliced open. “Ms. Jones, enjoy your coffee.” 

Natasha glanced at her, smiling gently. 

She came from a good family, perfectly matched with Matthew. They were childhood sweethearts. Natasha had that classy, elegant vibe. Born into wealth, effortlessly graceful–just sitting there, her confidence burned Adriana’s eyes. 

Adriana knew she lost. She never stood a chance. 

A prince never really falls for a poor girl. He just used her to kill time. 

Setting down the cup, Adriana practically fled the office 

She had no confidence. The orphan label, the poverty, the scars from the abuse–every inch of her screamed insecurity. 

“Mr. Langford and Ms. Jones are going on their honeymoon? I heard they’re official now. Once they’re back, the engagement will be announced. Both families already gave their blessing.” 

In the pantry, coworkers gossiped about Matthew and Natasha’s wedding. 

As Adriana filled her cup, the boiling water splashed on her hand, turning her skin red. 

The cup slipped from her hand and shattered. Startled, he rushed to rinse her burn under cold water. 

Matthew and Natasha were getting married. 

This meant she and Matthew were done. And so was he internship at the Langford Group. 

“Adriana, Mr. Langford wants you to drive him and Ms. ones to the airport at 11,” a coworker called out. 

Adriana forced a bitter smile. *Matthew… is ruthless*. 

She knew he was doing it on purpose. There were drives available, but he picked her–to remind her of her place and to kill off any foolish hopes. 

In the end, both Matthew and Mia were bullies. They just had different ways of breaking people. 

One shattered her body. The other crushed her already broken heart. 

Pulling out her phone, Adriana hesitated for a long time before dialing a number she had once blocked. 

“Hello, Mr. Lincoln. You once said… if I agreed to marry you, you’d sponsor my studies in Pastalia. Does 

that offer still stand?” Her voice trembled. 

Marriage might be her only way out of Haldoria, also the only way to escape Matthew. 

“Think it through,” the man replied in a deep voice. “Come to Clarke Residence on the 13th at 7 p.m. We’ll 

discuss the details.”

“Hey, Anna.” Adriana had just hung up when Natasha called her softly. 

She turned around nervously, facing Natasha, who was standing in the pantry. 

Too gentle. Too graceful. Even standing there with a smile made Adriana feel suffocated. 

“M–Ms. Jones, what can I do for you?”

“I just remembered I still need to pick up a few things for the trip. Could you help me get them?” Natasha handed her a handwritten list. 

Her handwriting, like her, was neat and delicate. 

Adriana froze for a moment. One word hit her like a knife–condoms. 

“Thank you. Keep it between us,” Natasha whispered with a wink. 

Adriana nodded awkwardly and almost fled the pantry. 

She had just turned 19 the first time with Matthew. It was her birthday. He gave her flowers and a cake. 

As an orphan, she’d never even had birthday cake. That little cake and bouquet completely swept her off her feet. She gave him everything. 

Bitterly, Adriana smiled at herself. What a joke. 

*Girls really do need to* grow *up rich*. *Otherwise, one cake is all it takes for a man to trick you*. 

Four years with Matthew, yet she had never once bough condoms. He didn’t like them, so he always made her take pills. 

But for Natasha? Of course, he couldn’t bear to make her take pills. Too harmful, right? 

On the way to the airport, Adriana stayed silent the whole time. 

“We’re tight on time. Drive faster,” Matthew deliberately reminded her, sensing her mood. 

“Yes, Mr. Langford.” Adriana nodded and turned left on the green light. 

The car ahead had just crossed when suddenly a boy ran through the red light. Adriana swerved hard to avoid him and crashed straight into the median. 

“Natasha!” At the moment of impact, Matthew shielded Natasha in his arms. 

Luckily, the speed wasn’t high. Only the driver’s side was badly damaged. 

The airbag burst out. The crumpled frame pinned Adriana tightly against the seat. Her left leg was trapped, pain blurring her **senses**. 

“Matthew …” Terrified, her voice trembled. “Help me… 

She was terrified of being trapped in tight spaces, unable to move. ",1,1767337054.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

One shattered her body. The other crushed her already broken heart.

“Hey, Anna.” Adriana had just hung up when Natasha called her softly. 

She turned around nervously, facing Natasha, who was standing in the pantry. 

Too gentle. Too graceful. Even standing there with a smile made Adriana feel suffocated. 

“M–Ms. Jones, what can I do for you?”

“I just remembered I still need to pick up a few things for the trip. Could you help me get them?” Natasha handed her a handwritten list. 

Her handwriting, like her, was neat and delicate. 

Adriana froze for a moment. One word hit her like a knife–condoms. 

“Thank you. Keep it between us,” Natasha whispered with a wink. 

Adriana nodded awkwardly and almost fled the pantry. 

She had just turned 19 the first time with Matthew. It was her birthday. He gave her flowers and a cake. 

As an orphan, she’d never even had birthday cake. That little cake and bouquet completely swept her off her feet. She gave him everything. 

Bitterly, Adriana smiled at herself. What a joke. 

*Girls really do need to* grow *up rich*. *Otherwise, one cake is all it takes for a man to trick you*. 

Four years with Matthew, yet she had never once bough condoms. He didn’t like them, so he always made her take pills. 

But for Natasha? Of course, he couldn’t bear to make her take pills. Too harmful, right? 

On the way to the airport, Adriana stayed silent the whole time. 

“We’re tight on time. Drive faster,” Matthew deliberately reminded her, sensing her mood. 

“Yes, Mr. Langford.” Adriana nodded and turned left on the green light. 

The car ahead had just crossed when suddenly a boy ran through the red light. Adriana swerved hard to avoid him and crashed straight into the median. 

“Natasha!” At the moment of impact, Matthew shielded Natasha in his arms. 

Luckily, the speed wasn’t high. Only the driver’s side was badly damaged. 

The airbag burst out. The crumpled frame pinned Adriana tightly against the seat. Her left leg was trapped, pain blurring her **senses**.

A thirty–year–old man’s desire was raw and blunt.

Finished 

Adriana Xander had lost track of how long he’d been at. Her body felt like it was falling apart, drowning in lust so intense she could barely breathe. 

Matthew Langford knew her body too well. He hit every sensitive spot with precision. Not a single touch was wasted. He was smooth and skilled. 

“Clear my schedule for the week starting tomorrow. I’m taking time off. Book two tickets *to* Neocoralis.” Finally done, Matthew stood by the bed, slowly getting dressed. 

Adriana shifted her sore waist a bit, her eyes lighting up. “Matthew, you’re taking me on vacation?” 

Matthew paused, frowned slightly, and looked at her. “I’m going with Natasha.” 

The smile froze on Adriana’s face. She lowered her head awkwardly, saying, “Okay, Mr. Langford … ” 

Seeing her pale face, Matthew spoke again. “Adriana, you’re just an orphan. You’re young. I can’t marry you.” 

Adriana looked up at him, forcing a bitter smile. “I never expected you to marry me … But now that Ms. Jones is divorced and back, should we end this affair?” 

Matthew’s face darkened. He rubbed her head, trying to soothe her, and placed a card on the nightstand. “Be good. Buy whatever you want.” 

“Mr. Langford, I don’t want to be a mistress … ” Adriana stared at him stubbornly. She knew he’d marry Natasha Jones eventually. 

“You’re talking too soon. We’ll deal with it when the time comes. Don’t throw tantrums. Whether we end this or not isn’t up to you.” Clearly impatient, Matthew glanced at her one last time and left. 

As the door shut, Adriana’s ears buzzed. She couldn’t hear a thing. 

Adriana was an orphan. Freshman year, her looks drew the wrath of rich girl Mia Langford. The bullying left her deaf in one ear, crushed her pinky toe, and nearly blinded her with a cigarette burn… 

Someone filmed it and posted it online. The scandal blew up. 

The school called in the parents. Standing in for Mia wa Matthew–her brother. 

Maybe it was for the Langford Group’s reputation, maye out of pity, but Matthew reached out to the battered Adriana. The first thing he said to her was, “Dot be scared. I won’t let anyone hurt you again.” 

Spineless. Pathetic. 

Adriana fell for him. At her most vulnerable, Matthew fot every fantasy she had about love and safety. 

She used to think he was her salvation. But now … he didn’t love her. He just wouldn’t let her go. 

At the Langford Group. 

Matthew had a meeting to handle his handover. Natasha waited in his office.

Adriana placed the coffee in front of Natasha, her chest ching like it was being sliced open. “Ms. Jones, enjoy your coffee.” 

Natasha glanced at her, smiling gently. 

She came from a good family, perfectly matched with Matthew. They were childhood sweethearts. Natasha had that classy, elegant vibe. Born into wealth, effortlessly graceful–just sitting there, her confidence burned Adriana’s eyes. 

Adriana knew she lost. She never stood a chance. 

A prince never really falls for a poor girl. He just used her to kill time. 

Setting down the cup, Adriana practically fled the office 

She had no confidence. The orphan label, the poverty, the scars from the abuse–every inch of her screamed insecurity. 

“Mr. Langford and Ms. Jones are going on their honeymoon? I heard they’re official now. Once they’re back, the engagement will be announced. Both families already gave their blessing.” 

In the pantry, coworkers gossiped about Matthew and Natasha’s wedding. 

As Adriana filled her cup, the boiling water splashed on her hand, turning her skin red. 

The cup slipped from her hand and shattered. Startled, he rushed to rinse her burn under cold water. 

Matthew and Natasha were getting married. 

This meant she and Matthew were done. And so was he internship at the Langford Group. 

“Adriana, Mr. Langford wants you to drive him and Ms. ones to the airport at 11,” a coworker called out. 

Adriana forced a bitter smile. *Matthew… is ruthless*. 

She knew he was doing it on purpose. There were drives available, but he picked her–to remind her of her place and to kill off any foolish hopes. 

In the end, both Matthew and Mia were bullies. They just had different ways of breaking people. 

One shattered her body. The other crushed her already broken heart. 

Pulling out her phone, Adriana hesitated for a long time before dialing a number she had once blocked. 

“Hello, Mr. Lincoln. You once said… if I agreed to marry you, you’d sponsor my studies in Pastalia. Does

1q1rq3y,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q1rq3y,"REVIEW: Deer Chaser, Lugu Township, Taiwan ⭐⭐⭐⭐✳️","Hotel: Deer Chaser Lugu Township in Taiwan(South of Sun Moon lake, not the other one that is north). Five stars, booked through the Michelin Guide online. This hotel actually looked so cool, I was a little afraid it was AI generated until I found it confirmed in the Michelin guide. It's a little smaller in person than you might think from the official pictures but otherwise definitely lives up to the photos!

PROPERTY: Compact but beautifully designed with lots of great seating areas, a little infinity pool, an intimate restaurant, and our room was two stories high and had an amazing bathtub out on a huge deck overlooking the valley. The bathtub is not visible from any other rooms.

ROOM: Spacious, unlimited drinks and snacks for free, slippers and bathrobes provided, tea and coffee making facilities in room along with a traditional tea room sitting area upstairs by the bedroom. The massive deck is incredible and we made extensive use of the bathtub which has stunning panoramic views of the tropical mountains. Reminiscent of Hawaii (especially Kauai) only much bigger.

Our only complaint here (reason I gave this four stars instead of five) is that the platform bed was quite hard, and the room feels a little hazardous and definitely not disability accessible. There was no real railing along the stairs going up, and there is a step down from the bed platform that is not marked in any way visually or with any kind of physical groove. We both stumbled off of it in the middle of the night and could have easily fallen if we were older. The bathroom is downstairs so you definitely have to navigate your way up and down repeatedly.

DINING: They have a set menu but they seem eager to accommodate any special requests or allergies. They saw on the first day for example that we did not eat smoked salmon or scallops so they ask if we had any allergies and when we said we doesn't really like them, they made sure to leave those out the next days without us having to ask. 

The menu consists of various courses with a lot of food, and it's very foreigner friendly. The main course choices were grouper, steak, lamb chops, or duck breast, but that was preceded by a variety of hots d'oevres, soup pots, little salads, etc., and followed by a dessert which was an oolong mille crepe cake the first night, and a peach cheesecake the second night. We got mulled wine before dinner every evening. Outstanding fresh baked beans with fruits and nuts also.

They have four different breakfast options each of which is a platter with various things. I got the English breakfast, which contained sausage, bacon, green guava, dragon fruit, peach yogurt with cereal, exceptionally delicious hash browns, smoked salmon, and focaccia bread. That did feel a little bit like they weren't sure what exactly a western breakfast was but they found various things on the internet and this seemed to fit the bill 😂 All excellent though! My spouse got the udon noodles in a cold broth with some kind of crispy things and pork, along with some banchan type things. There was some gochujang in there too so I'm assuming this was intended to be a Korean breakfast of sorts. Tasted fantastic. They have a coffee machine to make lattes and such. 

SERVICE: I would rank this hotel as very foreigner friendly relative to most places outside of Taipei. That is to say, the service was extremely friendly and several people spoke a little bit of English. All of them were more than willing to use Google translate to help communicate with us and even have conversations. They were very helpful with our luggage and profusely apologetic when they realized we had carried our own bags downstairs already upon departure. (Might have been a faux pas not to allow them to do that for us haha) 

I did ask, and they said they hardly ever get foreigners, even though the aesthetic, service, and food is all super accessible for Western tourists. The crowd seemed to consist entirely of wealthy young Taiwanese people presumably from Taipei. As a geriatric millennial I was probably one of the oldest people there. The staff is all in their 20s also.

LOCATION: There is another Deer Chaser that I think is larger but not as beautifully situated. We drove by that one and were not impressed with the neighborhood. This location is just down the road from a beautiful park maintained by Taiwan National University. We went up to the park for a New Year's hike and discovered that this is a major tradition so there were probably 50+ buses of old Taiwanese people pouring into the park to hike although most of them I think stayed at the lower elevations so when we hiked a little bit further, it became very quiet. Our favorite part was the skywalk between the trees. They have cool Bridges also and the vegetation is extraordinary. Combination of local tropical and various imported tree species that they are experimentally planting for study at the University.

The area is especially famous for the dongding oolong, and we enjoyed visiting the tea museum at the cooperative down the road. Our primary interest however was the coffee plantations, and while we weren't able to visit any actual plantations (apparently there was no harvest this year so nobody is selling green beans), we did go to several outstanding coffee roasters and tried their Taiwan geisha coffees. Almost no English was spoken anywhere but that's not really a major obstacle when you have Google Translate.

We did not see a single other white person for three days, and Western tourism seems largely non-existent in this part of Taiwan for some reason. I have no idea why, because I found everyone to be extremely accommodating, friendly, and welcoming. The region is extraordinarily beautiful, and it is filled with things to do like a really cool earthquake Museum that we stopped at along the way where you can see a collapsed school along with an extensive exhibit that has information in English. 

Fabulous casual lunch stop recommendation (The vast majority of restaurants seem to cater to bus groups of Taiwanese tourists with set menus, I'm not sure if you can walk into them):
https://maps.app.goo.gl/wbqaZr6ewv2pDs8RA


We found driving a rental car to be really easy as well. Drivers were generally courteous, roads were wide, driving didn't seem hectic like in some other Asian countries. There's a great rest stop before you get to Taichung with lots of good little food stands including the best egg tart I've ever had in my entire life by a mile. Also a Starbucks with all kinds of cool merch that we don't have. Parking is a little challenging in Taiwan but you just park places along the road. There are no foreign chains or corporations anywhere up in this area with the exception of 7-Eleven and Family Mart. 

Practical notes: Bring cash, though most places still accept credit cards as well. Do note that there do not seem to be trash cans anywhere, not at convenience stores, not at gas stations, we couldn't find any at the park. We took most of our trash back to the hotel and left it there and we did find a trash can at the rest stop near Taichung.",3,1767336573.0,FATTravel,0,1.0,False

It's a phrase we all have heard countless times, myself included. But it's a pretty heavy statement when you start to consider what it truly takes to become the person you want to be. Of course, I've tried telling myself that I'm this great guy, this great poet, a confident man, and nonchalant (fake it until you make it). I'm not even worried so much as just tired and cold. I woke up on the wrong side of the floor, with a chilly 25°F outside and a fragile sheet of snow. I opened the pantry, looking for the black plastic coffee maker.
""There you are!""
The only thing I couldn't find was the glass carafe. 
""Where is the glass coffee thingy? I need it."" I said, as my mother was writing in her journal while sipping her instant coffee. 
""Check inside the pantry."" 
""I already did. It's not in here."" 
I moved towards the bottom cabinets of the kitchen. Plastic containers, utensils, lids, but no carafe. My father emerged from the bathroom; he's been battling the superflu. 
""Why don't you just use the instant coffee?""
""No, I want to use my own coffee."" I had purchased a coffee brand sponsored by my favorite 90s punk band. It was founded by three band members from California. After searching through every drawer and kitchen cabinet for the 20th time, I spotted some hot chocolate powder. It was better than nothing, and at this point, hot chocolate sounded way tastier than coffee.
""This works,"" I whispered to myself.
 My father was also checking the pantry.

Started two years ago doing Instagram and Facebook management for local small businesses like gyms, salons, that kind of thing. First year was rough, made maybe $2K per month on average with like 6 clients churning constantly. Felt like I was always hustling for the next client just to replace ones who left. My biggest problem was I had no system for getting new clients. Would post occasionally in local Facebook groups, tried running some Facebook ads that burned $400 with zero results, would ask friends if they knew anyone. Super inconsistent, feast or famine. Some months I'd land 3 new clients, other months nothing. The stress was killing me. Had coffee with another service business owner in September last year, she ran a bookkeeping service. Asked how she gets clients and she said about 80% come from referrals from existing clients. She literally just asks every client after 3 months if they know anyone else who might need bookkeeping help, sends them a simple email template. Said she gets maybe a 40% response rate with actual referrals. Felt so obvious but I'd never actually done it systematically.

Started doing the same thing in October. After working with a client for 2-3 months once they're happy with results, I send a simple email saying I'm looking to work with 2-3 more businesses like theirs, do they know anyone who might need help. Include a little discount for them if the referral signs up. First month I sent that to 8 clients, got 3 referrals, closed 2 of them. Made it a monthly habit, every client who's been with me 60+ days gets that email. Response rate is probably around 35-40%, not everyone knows someone but enough do. Been doing this for about 14 months now, grew from $2K to $7.3K monthly revenue. Now have 19 active clients, lost maybe 4 in the past year but gaining more than I lose. About 70% of new clients in the past year came from referrals. Completely changed my business from constantly stressed about finding clients to actually having a waitlist. The simple system came from reading case studies in [FounderToolkit ](http://foundertoolkit.org/)about service businesses that scaled through referrals instead of ads.

AI was used only to help clean up wording; the observations and experience are my own.

The first time I noticed this was when I took a single probiotic supplement, L. reuteri. The first thing I felt was that I became a lot happier and more motivated, almost like I had drunk a coffee. I was talking more, felt more alert, and just more social in general. This effect was noticeably stronger with L. reuteri than what I later noticed with Bifidobacterium longum.

The second thing I noticed was spontaneous erections, including during the day. It caught me off guard, especially since I wasn’t expecting anything like that from a probiotic.

For some context, I’ve become pretty sensitive to probiotics over the last couple of years and tend to react easily, especially histamine-wise. Because of that, I started slowly with Bifidobacterium longum, which is often mentioned as being better tolerated for people with histamine sensitivity. I noticed similar libido-related effects with it as well, even from just one capsule with 1 billion CFU, although the social and alert “coffee-like” feeling was less pronounced compared to L. reuteri.

I did some light reading afterward and came across mentions of possible gut–brain or nervous system involvement with certain strains like L. reuteri and B. longum (e.g. signaling, blood flow, oxytocin pathways). I’m not claiming any mechanism here — just sharing what I noticed and what surprised me. Individual responses obviously vary.

Curious if anyone else here has noticed similar strain-specific effects or differences.

I've never really been in a serious relationship but I've never really ""wanted"" sex. I've never had the urge to kiss anybody, either. The most I've ever gotten the urge to do is cuddle, or hug, or loop arms with someone. Either I'm just very very ace or I've never had a chance to be demisexual, idk. I'd like to hope I'm demisexual, but. Idk. At this point, I guess I've had such bad luck with relationships that they're kind of daunting, and now I'm just wondering if I'm aro too but I'd like to hope I'm not.

Back in November a guy approached me while I was solo at a local concert, said I was pretty and that he'd like to get my number. I wanted to be brave, and said sure. We chatted awhile and he said he enjoyed talking with me, and asked if I'd like to go on a date mini golfing. I've never had a guy like, ask me on a date date before. So I was like, uhh sure haha. I let him know I wasn't a very physical person right then and there, and HE asked ME if I considered myself Asexual, and I said yes. So I figured it wasn't a deal breaker for him. He also said that he'd dated an asexual girl in the past (but broke up for other reasons separate from the aceness)

On the first date, he admitted that he had a ""high libido"", and shared a lot of stuff about his like sexual past. It felt like a lot for a first date in hindsight and I didn't really know what to do with it tbh. I told him as an ace person I'd be OK with a partner who needed other partners, since I don't personally think it's fair to not meet someone's needs. He tried to kiss me twice that evening, once mid-date and the other when he walked me to my car. When I looked surprised, he thought I was nervous and he held my chin and asked me again if I wanted to kiss him and I looked up at him with big eyes like a dumbass and said ""I dunno"" which I think surprised him. I guess he assumed I was just being nervous? But I literally just met the guy! Is that weird?

I told him over text (during thanksgiving break) that he kind of gave me way too much info but I didn't wanna write him off just cuz I got nervous (me trying to be brave here, trying to try new things, trying not to shy away from an opportunity for a relationship), and he was actually really receptive to the feedback and was super sweet and communicative. We got coffee that sunday and he apologized again in person and said he was totally fine with going at a slower pace. A week later we went to see a movie and he said he'd like to keep seeing me, and we had a long talk about pace and like, what my personal brand of asexuality was (mainly that I don't have any sexual instinct towards other people, and that my body isn't really sensitive in that way at all) he had a little bit of trouble understanding but he said it sounded really lonely. I was crying, and really vulnerable. We talked about pace and I told him if he didn't feel like that was going to work for him, I'd completely understand and wouldn't take it personally. At first he said no, but I guess he talked himself back into it because by the end of the conversation he said he'd like to continue dating.

The whole time we've been talking he's been super sweet and communicative, and said he's ok with going at my pace and was open to exploring anything I'd want to explore (which is something I mentioned to him because yanno, never really had the opportunity, and at this point I'm just kind of intellectually curious).

Long story short, for our fourth date, we watched a movie at his place. The night before, he texted (unprompted!) that he didn't have any expectations to kiss or anything. I was like awesome! Cool! So I went to his place and we watched the movie, and then guess what? He wanted to kiss. I was ok with cuddling, and he gave me some smooches on the cheek, but then he started for my neck and I was like woah, this was already more than I agreed to, and he backed off. After the movie he asked why I still didn't want to kiss him after 4 dates, and I told him I don't have the urge to kiss anyone.

I gave an analogy about sex being kind of like skydiving to me, where people keep raving about it and even though I don't want it, I kind of want to see what all the fuss was about. His eyes widened and he was like ""oh wow, I don't have any desire to skydive at all."" and I think he finally got where I was coming from? And then he said that although he really liked me and thought I was fun and cool to hang out with, he could tell that our needs were too different and we shouldn't continue dating. I agreed but wish he had done that on our PREVIOUS date when I was giving him an easy out. I told him I had been willing to try, and make an effort, and he said he knew but he could tell that wouldn't be good for either of us in the long run, and I knew he was right.

I left without crying but I've cried since then, not for losing him but just kind of for fucking it all up. A lot of my friends are in relationships and one of my best friends told me yesterday he plans on proposing to his boyfriend, and they're both a few years younger than me and I started spiraling in an existential crisis.

I feel like a kid going through all this and I'm so annoyed that I don't want any of this stuff. I want to want it but I don't want it, yanno? like I can't make myself want it. Should I have known it was a fools errand? I dunno. Maybe I just wanted to tell someone, anyone. I feel very alone.",6,1767334959.0,asexualdating,12,1.0,False

Embarrassingly, I was addicted to Starbucks seasonal drinks (with 4 shots of espresso), so it got really bad towards the end of the year.

I'm also bleaching my teeth, so I think it's the perfect time to move away from coffee/tea drinks altogether, and was curious if any of you had any other hot drink ideas.
