1g168bv,https://www.reddit.com/r/KnowCigars/comments/1g168bv/cigar_and_beverage_pairings_elevating_the/,Cigar and Beverage Pairings: Elevating the Experience,"The perfect cigar is already an indulgence, but pairing it with the right beverage can elevate the experience to new heights. Much like pairing wine with food, a great beverage can complement and enhance the flavors of your cigar, creating a richer and more complex experience. Whether you're enjoying a light Connecticut or a full-bodied Maduro, here’s a guide to some of the best cigar and beverage pairings that will take your smoking sessions to the next level.

# 1. Whiskey and Cigars: A Classic Duo

* **Why It Works:** Whiskey, particularly bourbon and Scotch, is often the go-to pairing for cigars. Its rich, layered flavors—ranging from sweet to smoky—align beautifully with the complexity of premium cigars. The higher alcohol content also helps cleanse the palate between puffs.

# Pairing Recommendations:

* **Bourbon + Maduro Cigars:** The caramel, vanilla, and oak notes in bourbon pair perfectly with the deep, earthy flavors of a Maduro cigar. Try a **Padrón 1964 Anniversary Series Maduro** with a glass of **Buffalo Trace** or **Blanton’s** bourbon for an unforgettable combo.
* **Scotch + Medium to Full-Bodied Cigars:** For a rich Scotch, like a peaty **Lagavulin 16**, try a bold cigar such as the **Arturo Fuente Hemingway Maduro**. The smokiness of the Scotch and the dark, cocoa notes of the cigar play off each other beautifully.
* **Irish Whiskey + Connecticut Shade Cigars:** The lighter, honeyed notes of Irish whiskey, such as **Redbreast 12**, work well with a mild cigar like the **Montecristo White Series**. The creaminess of the cigar enhances the smooth, sweet flavor of the whiskey.

# 2. Rum and Cigars: A Caribbean Dream

* **Why It Works:** Rum, especially aged rum, and cigars share a historical bond, particularly in the Caribbean. The natural sweetness and complexity of rum, with its notes of molasses, caramel, and spices, make it a fantastic pairing partner for cigars.

# Pairing Recommendations:

* **Aged Rum + Full-Bodied Cigars:** Try an aged rum like **Diplomático Reserva Exclusiva** with a **Cohiba Siglo VI**. The richness of the rum amplifies the spicy and leathery notes of the cigar, creating a luxurious experience.
* **Spiced Rum + Medium-Bodied Cigars:** The spice-forward nature of rums like **Chairman’s Reserve Spiced Rum**pairs wonderfully with a medium-bodied cigar such as the **Oliva Serie V**. The bold flavors of the cigar match the warmth of the spiced rum.
* **Dark Rum + Maduro Cigars:** Dark rums, with their heavier molasses flavors, such as **Zacapa 23**, pair beautifully with Maduro cigars like the **La Gloria Cubana Serie R Maduro**. The depth of both the rum and the cigar complement each other with rich, sweet, and earthy undertones.

# 3. Cognac and Cigars: Pure Sophistication

* **Why It Works:** Cognac’s delicate balance of sweetness, fruit, and floral notes make it a fantastic pairing with cigars. The complexity of cognac can mirror and enhance the layers of flavor in a good smoke.

# Pairing Recommendations:

* **VSOP Cognac + Medium-Bodied Cigars:** A **Hennessy VSOP** paired with a **Romeo y Julieta 1875** is a match made in heaven. The cigar’s subtle sweetness and the cognac’s balanced notes of vanilla, apricot, and oak create a smooth, cohesive pairing.
* **XO Cognac + Full-Bodied Cigars:** For something more robust, try an **Hennessy XO** or **Rémy Martin XO** with a **La Flor Dominicana Double Ligero**. The strength of the cigar complements the dark fruit and spice notes of the XO cognac.
* **Cognac + Cameroon-Wrapped Cigars:** If you're looking to try something a little more nuanced, pair a **Hennessy VS** with a Cameroon-wrapped cigar like the **Arturo Fuente Don Carlos**. The sweetness of the Cameroon leaf balances the fruitiness of the cognac.

# 4. Wine and Cigars: An Unexpected Pleasure

* **Why It Works:** Though wine isn’t the most common pairing for cigars, when done right, it can be extraordinary. The acidity of wine cuts through the richness of a cigar, while the tannins in red wine can enhance a cigar’s earthy or spicy notes.

# Pairing Recommendations:

* **Red Wine + Medium-Bodied Cigars:** A rich, tannic red wine like a **Cabernet Sauvignon** pairs excellently with a medium-bodied cigar like the **Arturo Fuente Rosado Sungrown Magnum R**. The cigar’s spiciness complements the wine’s dark fruit flavors and subtle oak notes.
* **Port + Full-Bodied Cigars:** For dessert pairings, a glass of **Tawny Port** and a strong Maduro cigar such as the **Padrón 1926** will delight your taste buds. The sweetness of the port contrasts beautifully with the rich, earthy flavors of the cigar.
* **Champagne + Mild Cigars:** If you’re celebrating or just looking for something different, pair a light, Connecticut-wrapped cigar like the **Davidoff Signature Series** with **Brut Champagne**. The cigar’s creaminess and the bubbles in the champagne offer a refreshing and sophisticated combination.

# 5. Coffee and Cigars: The Morning Delight

* **Why It Works:** Coffee’s bitterness and roasted flavors pair naturally with cigars, making it a go-to pairing for early morning or midday smoking. The rich, deep flavors of espresso or a dark roast coffee enhance the bold flavors of cigars, while a lighter roast can provide a milder counterpart.

# Pairing Recommendations:

* **Espresso + Maduro Cigars:** The concentrated flavors of an espresso make it a perfect partner for a Maduro cigar, such as the **My Father Le Bijou 1922 Maduro**. The dark, chocolaty notes of the cigar are beautifully complemented by the bitterness of the espresso.
* **Latte or Cappuccino + Mild Cigars:** The creaminess of a latte pairs wonderfully with a mild cigar like the **Macanudo Café Hyde Park**. The coffee’s softness brings out the cigar’s subtler nutty and creamy notes.
* **Cold Brew + Full-Bodied Cigars:** For something refreshing, pair a strong **Cold Brew Coffee** with a full-bodied cigar like the **Liga Privada No. 9**. The cold brew’s smooth, rich flavor provides an excellent backdrop for the cigar’s bold spice and earthiness.

# 6. Beer and Cigars: A Surprising Match

* **Why It Works:** Beer and cigars may not be the first combination that comes to mind, but the range of flavors in craft beers offers some interesting pairing opportunities. Whether it's a robust stout or a hoppy IPA, beer can enhance the depth of a cigar's flavor profile.

# Pairing Recommendations:

* **Stout + Maduro Cigars:** The thick, creamy texture of a stout like **Guinness** or **Founders Breakfast Stout** pairs well with a rich Maduro cigar like the **Oliva Serie O Maduro**. The roasted coffee and chocolate notes in the stout echo the deep flavors of the cigar.
* **IPA + Spicy Cigars:** The bitterness and citrusy flavors in an IPA, like **Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA**, complement a spicy cigar such as the **AJ Fernandez New World Puro Especial**. The bold hop profile adds an extra layer of complexity to the smoke.
* **Amber Ale + Medium-Bodied Cigars:** The malty sweetness of an amber ale like **Fat Tire** pairs well with a medium-bodied cigar like the **Alec Bradley Prensado**. The balance of flavors between the beer and the cigar creates a mellow, enjoyable experience.

# Final Thoughts:

Pairing the right beverage with your cigar can completely transform the experience. Whether you prefer whiskey, rum, coffee, or wine, there’s always a perfect pairing waiting to be discovered. The key is to experiment and find combinations that suit your palate, allowing both the cigar and the beverage to enhance each other’s flavors.

1g1667a,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/1g1667a/mistook_for_a_coffee_machine_expert/,Mistook for a coffee machine expert.,"So tonight I ventured out to Costco with the family.
I'm not usually a Costco person, but earlier in the year I needed new tyres, and it turned out to be the best deal for my vehicle—even with the membership fee.

We usually only go occasionally to pick up a few items that are good value. (And an excuse to get a hotdog while I'm there!)

To keep the wife happy, one of those items is coffee pods. Personally, I prefer a proper espresso machine, but she hates using it, so the pods are a compromise to stop her from buying $5 coffees all the time.

Anyway, tonight was a win because the coffee pods we like were on special. So I reach up the Goliath end display and grab a couple boxes.

Then it happens:
“Excuse me, do those pods work with the machine on display next to it?”

I stop, a little confused. My first thought was to reply, “Does it look like I work here?” but I caught myself. I figured - it doesn’t take much to be kind. Also... yes, it probably does look like I work here because embarrassingly my entire outfit except my socks was actually from Costco!

I politely answered her questions and she asked me a few more. She seemed nice enough, although she seemed a bit disappointed in my answers.

My wife and I had a laugh after, thinking that yeah, I really could pass as a Costco employee. We continued our oversized shopping spree and thought nothing more of it.

But when we got to the checkout, guess who was behind the counter? Yup, the same lady who had asked me all the questions!

So yeah, I don’t work here lady, but turns out you do!

You won't be penalised for this. Just that there will obviously be a bigger financial incentive if you do

This is randomised. So for instance, you could run into them at the grocery store, gas station or restroom. There's always a small chance that you will meet them, but of course you are unaware as to their daily schedule. There's no predicting when they will be there. You may see them surrounded by thousands of fans, autograph hunters or paparazzi or you might just as easily see them alone at their most vulnerable 

The 10 locations are 
Grocery Store, Gas Station, Restroom, Fast Food Restaurant, Subway, Clothes Store, Coffee Shop, Beach, Gym, Divebar

You have to completely ignore them. No word or utterance shall be spoken. No eye contact shall me made or else your pay is revoked. You must carry on with your daily tasks completely oblivious to their presence

You undertake this for one week. You will have accumulated €7,000 dollars if you are successful. We'll call this the trial period. After one week the stakes get significantly higher and your resilience and mental fortitude with be tested to the limit 

As an example, you will be paid €10,000 to deliberately ignore them at a meet and greet session. This must include averting eye contact at all times, ignoring their questions and remaining completely expressionless. You must not laugh or giggle in their presence. Conversely you can't frown, grimace or show any signs of anger. You must remain a stoic presence throughout the duration of your time spent with them

I love younger women

I love the energy, curiosity, open-mindedness and enthusiasm of younger women. There is something incredibly sexy about a younger woman who craves new experiences and who is open to experimentation and who approaches it all with a positive attitude.

I am so glad there are younger women out there who crave an older experienced man…I have found that everyone of them I have spoken to love that an older man is interested in ""her"" pleasure as much as he is interested in his own -- Apparently younger men are more focused on themselves.

So thank you to all of you fabulous younger ladies out there!😛

That said…I am a fun, discreet, married, educated, tasteful and attractive silver-fox gentleman who wants to intimately explore with you. I prefer soft and sensual over rough, but I find it arousing when my partner likes to have her hair pulled and to be used more rough when our collective passion builds;) I want you to feel safe, cared for, desired, excited, and satisfied. I am tall, slim, fit, hairy chest, nice equipment, and I have a warm, wet, savage tongue.

I am just wanting some fun conversation and to hear the sweet noises you make when we play…and when I make you cum. I promise that I will leave you feeling sexy all over and with no regrets. It will be our sexy secret🤫

1g15xof,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1g15xof/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

In Genshin Impact you get 180 stamina per 24 hours, 60 additional stamina from the teapot per week. This totally amounts to 1320 stamina per week. It takes 40 stamina per run resulting into two artifacts, effectively 1 artifact per 20 stamina. Crafting wise it takes 3 artifacts to create 1 artifact, so a 1:3 ratio.  
Artifacts per week: 1320 / 20 = 66 artifacts  
Artifacts per day: 66 / 7 = 9.42  
Artifacts per week including crafting: 66 \* 4/3 = 88  
Artifacts per per day including crafting: 88 / 7 = 12.57

In Honkai Star Rail you get 240 stamina per 24 hours, 160 additional stamina from Simulated Universe per week. This totally amounts to 1840 stamina per week. It takes 40 stamina per run resulting into two relics, effectively 1 relic per 20 stamina. Crafting wise it takes 10 relics to create 1 relic, so a 1:10 ratio.  
relics per week: 1840 / 20 = 92 relics  
relics per day: 66 / 7 = 13.14  
relics per week including crafting:  \* 1.1 = 101.2  
relics per per day including crafting: 88 / 7 = 14.45

In ZZZ you get 240 stamina per 24 hours, 80 additional stamina from coffee per day which is 560 per week. This totally amounts to 2240 stamina per week. It takes 60 stamina per run resulting into two disc drives, effectively 1 disc drive per 30 stamina. Crafting wise it takes 3 disc drives to create 1 disc drive, so a 1:3 ratio. However, if you want to choose the disc drive slot it will be a 1:6 ratio.  
disc drives per week: 2240 / 30 = 74.66 disc drives  
disc drives per day: 66 / 7 = 10.66  
disc drives per week including crafting: 74.66 \* 4/3 = 99.55555555555556  
If you want to to choose the slot: 74.66666666666667 \* 7/6 = 87.11

A little backstory: I (F29) used to work at the same company as this woman (also F29), but we weren’t really friends or anything. I left the company about four years ago and haven’t been in touch with her since. Fast forward to last month, I ran into her at a business event. She was surprisingly friendly—like, super friendly—which felt a little strange given that we never really clicked when we were coworkers. But whatever, right? She suggested we should grab coffee sometime, and I thought, “why not? It could be cool to catch up.”

At this point, I had no idea she was dating my ex (M35).

So, a week later, we meet up for coffee. We talk about work and life, just the usual small talk, until she asks if I’m dating anyone. I said no and naturally asked her the same. That’s when she casually drops the bomb that she’s been dating my ex for six months. She didn’t know if I knew (I didn’t), and then proceeds to go on for about 20 minutes about how amazing they are together, how much they have in common, yada yada.

Oh, and she also mentions that when they first met through work, he was still seeing me. I found that little nugget completely unnecessary, tbh. For context, my breakup with him (about a year ago) was amicable, and I haven’t seen or spoken to him since. Frankly, I didn’t need or want any updates on his life or relationship status.

But here’s the part that really gets me—she knew I used to date him, so why invite me for coffee just to talk about him? Am I the only one who finds it odd to ask your current boyfriend’s ex out, only to gush about your relationship with him? Like… why?

1g15j84,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlgoPoker/comments/1g15j84/how_to_become_a_good_poker_player/,how to become a good poker player,"Stage #1 : The beginning.

You arrive on the scene, with very little money to your name, and little to no poker experience. At this stage you need to gain knowledge and experience. You acquire $40 and start grinding 1 cent 2 cent online. You could start even lower, there are .10/.20 centavos games denominated in pesos where 100 bb is 20 pesos or around 40 cents.

Anyway, i doesn't really matter. You get a 20 buy in bankroll, lets say $40 at $2 NLHE. There are hundreds of good poker books out there, but you start reading them. You also start reading forums. [twoplustwo.com](http://twoplustwo.com) for example is a gold mine of information for a noob. It does take a lot of sifting.  
  
You grind that. Face decisions. Note down hard decisions and think about them after your session. Read and gain knowledge. Implement different strategies. Learn core concepts through study. If you lose your $40 bankroll, you deposit another $40. Develop holistically as a player. Grow as a player. Grow your soft skills, your observation skills, your emotional and mental discipline. Discover tilt, and discover the cure for tilt. Implement breaks to increase your productivity. Play hundreds, then thousands, then tens of thousands, then hundreds of thousands of hands. Add more tables.

Grind and study. Study and grind. Eventually you will start winning and your bankroll will grow. This could take months or even years. It will not be easy. Once you have a winning sample of say 20,000 hands at X bb / 100 then you can move up to $5 NLHE. 

Tools for study include :

Forums (twoplustwo, poker strategy, gypsy forum, r/poker, there are probably others).  
Books. You can find a lot of them for free on libgen.   
Articles. Cardplayer, there are other websites.   
Training sites. Don't spend a lot of money here, but a RIO essential membership at like $30 will give you access to a ton of content.  
Youtube. Youtube has a huge wealth of really high quality content and it's only going to get better. Look for those eastern euro guys that go into GTO strategy and solver lines. If they don't even speak English and have to rely upon machine interpreted translations you know it's going to be solid advice.

But the most important study tool is your brain! Review hands you played, and sessions you played. Keep a poker journal and do before and after entries. Before the session, identify goals and things to work out. After the session (and/or during) write down areas of weaknesses, evaluate how you did. Huge tool for growth.   
Think about hands, your overall strategy, villains over all strategy.

  
So you grind up in stakes from say NLHE $2 to NLHE $25. If you do it correctly that is going to be a substantial investment of time. Let's say 2 years. Maybe 4-5 if you have to part time it. At this point you are pretty competitive at the $25 and $50 level. You don't even have to beat these levels, you just need to be able to hold your own against the field. A 0 bb/100 winrate.  
  
Now at this stage you need to acquire a bankroll. Maybe you've won it so far, if not you need to do so some work and save up some money. Hopefully you are a first worlder, in which case earning $6000 at work shouldn't be that hard, especially if you are willing to work over time. Once you have $6000 which you can afford to lose, you start grinding $1/$2 NLHE OR lower if there are lower options (home games).  
  
Now you need to repeat the process from before, basically learning how to play live poker. Live poker is a completely different animal from online poker. You have the same amount of cards and everything, but the decisions people make are so radically different, and the strategies employed and ranges people are so bizarre, it will be a real shock. And you might have trouble winning at first.

  
So you go back to basics. You forget everything you learned climbing the ladders of the microstakes online. You forget everything that upswing poker and the eastern euro gto crushers taught you. You'll go back to that knowledge later, but now you need to learn how to do two things. The first is how to fold, and the second is how to stomp fish.

Of course at this point you have the RFI folds as part of your unconscious knowledge, so that will be automatic for you. But what will be weird is waiting 30 minutes, even an hour before finding playable hands. That will happen. Live poker is slow. Live poker players are slow. You need the patience of a Buddhist monk if you are going to profit at juicy tables. And if you find yourself at a table where the action is going quite quickly, then you should be concerned. Pros play fast. Noobs play slow. And live poker has no shortage of noobs.

Everywhere you look, people will make the most absurd, stupid plays. They will limp in preflop, in early position, with utterly trash hands like 83o. Even the players that seem like they have half a clue are usually playing way too loose in a lot of spots. And they're so passive! Their ranges are wide, their strategies myopic. How can anyone lose to these idiots? But you will lose. You will lose because you bluff catch vs players who have no bluffs. You will lose because you check to induce against players so passive they're scared to bet even with the nuts. You will lose because you figure ""there's no way this guy has top of his range"" only to learn that the old man sipping coffee's three betting range starts with KK. But you will win. You will win because you are consistently going to the flop with grossly superior hands. Because people have no problem giving you action with weak made hands and with weak made draws.

So you begin your process of learning again. You learn how to thrive in this new and weird environment. You learn how to sit there and fold for hours. You learn how to run over weak tight players with absurd continuing ranges and how to fold against players with absolutely nutted ranges. Slowly but surely you develop a new skill set, one that both complements and conflicts with your old skill set. And sometimes you play in tough games against tough players, and rely on more of the old skill set and less of the new one. You build a synthesis of everything you learned beating the micros and everything learned beating 1/2, and create a new playbook. 

You study Caro's book of tells. Applications of No Limit Hold'em. The Theory of Poker Applied to No LImit. You learn about the intricacies of deep stack play and the meta game implications of playing 12 hour sessions against some of your opponents. 

Eventually you start crushing 1/2. So you move up in stakes. At 2/5 your average opponent is tougher. You start to rely more on your online skill set. You fight for pots. You bluff at a higher frequency. You make lighter call downs. You adapt to the field. Sometimes the games are extremely soft, and it is like playing 1/2. Sometimes the games are tighter, but your opponents are still weak and easily ran over. At this point you have a versatile skill set capable of beating virtually any game. But you stay humble. You realize there is still so much more to learn. You make sure to devote time each week to studying theory and reviewing hands and sessions you played. You watch the best players in your pool, and you learn from them. You continue to read, and to learn.

It's only been 8 months since the last phone call, and not even a month since we last sat down for coffee. I won't break whatever is left but it isn't the same and I believe you'd agree.

I can guess at the reasons you pulled away and I don't blame you. Or maybe it was I who pulled back. I think the wholesome level of connection I felt was just the kindness of a responsive soul. I wish I had the courage to ask if my assumption is right so I could put this anxiety to rest.

I have a lot of pride over your growth and progress, on the breaks you've learned to take and making sure your plate is not too full. Your cup was never exactly empty but when we met it was so low and you so tired. You are one of the most handsome souls I've ever encountered and I wish I had the ability and resources to be what you need.

I'm glad she is, of course, and she is brilliant and complex just the way you like it. She's like a star in the dark sky of your life, I'm sure, and a wish long granted. I hope you two blossom together. I don't feel jealous or bitter, while it was a cute daydream to see us grow together, I told you once I was worried our friendship would reflect badly on you and that fear extends to a partnership as well. 

Now that you two are officially together, I made a choice to change the patterns between us. I've always greeted you the same, and wished you well the same. In some ways I believed hearing your mother tongue gave you comfort, even if my accent was abysmal. But I stopped saying hello as often, I stopped throwing honesty at your feet, then changed my greetings, and now I've changed my goodbyes.

I hope to never break my promise of ""it's see you soon/talk soon, not goodbye"" but I must shift out of this deep, unwavering desire to see you. I cannot be a good friend when I find myself anxious over becoming a burden or annoyance.

Last time we spoke you said you believed in my ability to come out of this dark place I've found myself in the last year. After being cheated on, stalked, and watching my self-confidence shred pursuing psychiatric help I'm not the person you met or had that with, and I don't know if that will ever come back.

Maybe we can stay friends anyway.

Yours in friendship,

It was in this huge mall, it was fairly quiet and so we took turns to order. I went up and ordered this white mocha which for some reaon they added crushed raspberries to the bottom of it (take notes cause its all I crave now, surprisingly after this mess of a nightmare, an actual nightmare in my mind. 

I waited for my coffee, and at one point I noticed that my old friend from Uni was sat on a table with people (I did not recognise), so I ran over and said hi, the weird thing was I saw her on two different tables but the first person wasnt her like a fake copy. That doesnt matter though because when I returned to get my lush white mocha (I must have chose ice because the cup was clear, I had also for some reason seen a mug of tea, I persume I ordered that too but that was only for a moment but it was mine. 

The thing is in this cup the crushed raspberries were topped with a slither, a mere line of white mocha. It took me way to long to clock how wrong and rediculous this was and obviously complained about it, there was a customer next to me on the counter with their full iced coffee and I told the barista how their is full. But they just continued to gaslight me into saying ""Thats what you ordered, a white mocha."" and so this cycle of complaining went on for the entire dream.

At another point later, my old uni friend joined my best friend and were getting along which I really loved and apologised and told them what happened. I cant remember what they said but I did not stop until I got my coffee. When I went back up there was this stupif crowd of student some standing on chairs and staring at me like I was some crazy person. I just wanted this humiliation to end.

It went on for ages, they kept giving me the same drink. And I was just asking them if this was a prank but they were so serious about it not being one, the lady had a great poker face. There was a guy working there and in the end he confessed that it was all some elaborate prank and everyday a new person becomes victim to it. I sighed with relief because I was finally getting my coffee. The lady proceeded to say she would roll a dice or something and that'll determine my coffee, it was chai (which I love but sorry I paid for a fucking white mocha). She was like ""are you sure you want your original choice."" Exhausted I said yes I just want my first choice. Then I woke up so I never actually got to fullfill that so Im off to go get a white mocha from somewhere else, fuck co\*\*a coffee I say.",1,1728636849.0,DreamRot,0,1.0,False

Here are some tried-and-true tips to help you make the most of your time and succeed in your studies!

1. **Stay Organized**: Use a planner, app, or calendar to keep track of deadlines, exams, and projects. Google Calendar or Notion can be lifesavers for managing assignments and keeping everything in order.
2. **Manage Your Time Effectively**: Break tasks down into smaller, manageable pieces. Instead of trying to tackle a huge project all at once, schedule time blocks for specific tasks. The Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes of work, 5-minute breaks) can also help maintain focus.
3. **Take Good Notes**: Active note-taking helps you retain information better. Whether it's hand-written or digital, make sure your notes are clear and organized. Reviewing them after class helps solidify your understanding.
4. **Don’t Be Afraid to Ask Questions**: If something doesn’t make sense, ask! Whether it's your teacher, professor, or classmates, getting clarification early on can save you a lot of confusion later.
5. **Prioritize Your Health**: Get enough sleep, eat well, and make time for exercise. Staying healthy will keep your brain sharp and your energy levels up, making it easier to focus during study sessions.
6. **Find Your Ideal Study Environment**: Figure out where and when you study best. Whether it’s a quiet library, a cozy coffee shop, or a specific spot at home, having a go-to space helps signal your brain that it’s time to focus.
7. **Use Active Study Techniques**: Don’t just passively read your notes or textbooks. Use flashcards, explain concepts to yourself (or others), or try practice quizzes. Actively engaging with the material helps with long-term retention.
8. **Stay Consistent**: Review your notes regularly instead of cramming before exams. Spaced repetition—studying a little bit every day—helps improve memory and understanding over time.
9. **Set Realistic Goals**: Create small, achievable goals for each study session. Hitting these mini-milestones will give you a sense of accomplishment and keep you motivated to continue.
10. **Take Breaks**: Don’t burn out by trying to study for hours without a break. After a solid study session, take 5-10 minutes to stretch, walk, or relax. Your brain needs time to rest and recharge.
11. **Limit Distractions**: If you find yourself getting distracted by your phone or social media, put it on ""Do Not Disturb"" or use focus apps like ""Forest"" or ""Focus@Will"" to help you stay off distracting sites.
12. **Find a Study Buddy**: Having a study partner or group can make learning more interactive and enjoyable. Plus, teaching someone else what you’ve learned reinforces your own understanding.
13. **Balance Work and Fun**: Don’t forget to take time for yourself. Balancing school with hobbies, social time, and relaxation helps prevent burnout and keeps you motivated in the long run.
14. **Use Campus Resources**: Most schools offer free resources like tutoring, writing centers, and counseling services. Take advantage of these to boost your academic performance or manage stress.
15. **Stay Positive and Flexible**: Not everything will go as planned, and that’s okay! Stay adaptable, keep a positive mindset, and know that persistence is key. Don’t be too hard on yourself—progress, not perfection!",1,1728636800.0,Eduelevating,0,1.0,False

I'm almost recovered from my floxing but i discover something strange/interesting about decaffeined coffee. I tried after 6 month to drink one the begining of this week and it makes me like on euphoric drug(i don't know if it is the right term in english because it's not my mother language) . i felt good like i drink a little alcohol, not drunk but like 2 or 3 beers but with a lot of energy! As an energy drink! I work all the day without problem! But i could sleep correctly.   I tried it againt this morning and it does the same effect!

 I know that decaffeined coffee has a very low pourcentage of caffeine but...it is strange... Maybe i react normaly to caffeine but because i ban it from the day i know i was floxed now that i receive just a little, it work a lot?

 Does someone here have experienced the same effect? Thank you for your comments about it!",1,1728636214.0,floxies,0,1.0,False

Finally gave in and had lunch with this 31 y/o na schoolmate ko nung college. Ang topic? our work experiences, his life sa Australia and me living alone. It started na parang job interview na may shake hands pa. Parang ang formal ng lunch. Then went sa coffee shop for coffee. Ayun mas naging relax na and nagtatawanan na. He insisted to pay but told him I’ll be more comfortable if KKB. It felt nice to talk to someone pero di pa tapos ung lunch iniisip ko na pano ko ililipat ung TV sa sala to kwarto ko tapos patayin ilaw tapos todo na aircon. Manood ng Love Next Door tapos yung limited series na magkapatid na pinatay ung parents nila. Hahaha sinabi ko yun sakanya nung paubos na ung coffee tapos tawa lang sya.

Kanya kanyang drive na pauwi. Feeling ko galing ako sa job interview tapos naging close ko ung interviewer. I chat him that and sabi nya he felt the same hahaha 

Ang ending? Yeah first and last na to kasi we’re both not feeling it and mas magkasundo kami as friends HAHAHAH referred him sa isa kong friend na single lol ",135,1728636026.0,adultingph,27,0.98,False

We dated for 10 months I’d say pretty much together for a year and some change. I made a mistake that caused the breakup and I probably would have done the same with her if roles were reversed.(not cheating) We did no contact blocked each other on pretty much everything besides instagram(idk why) but she reached out the first time after she heard about me getting black out drunk at a party it was partially because of her and partially because Jack and cokes are good. Sadly I was also intoxicated when she texted(live in a city where teenagers drinking and going to bars is extremely normalized) and I responded pretty coldly to her but now reading them she sounded genuinely worried about my well being. She then kind of blindsided me after a hookup maybe a month and half after the breakup and she dm again seeming pretty mad I got with someone so quickly. She gave me the idk who you are anymore line. We haven’t talked in person since the break up and I after almost running into each other at a party where we both would have been intoxicated I realized I don’t want my first interaction with her to be at a bar or party but I also feel weird asking her to like have a chat or something. I thought about “accidentally” running into her at a coffee shop she frequents to study but never rlly got around to it. I have never been the first to text since the breakup so just wondering how I should go about it. I am pretty sure she doesn’t want to rekindle anything haven’t really gotten any evidence either way though. I am kind of in between trying again or not I have deep rotted trust issues that led me to attempt early in my teen years and that honestly I should have seen and not got into a relationship in the first place but she was the only person I could ever really open up to so she seemed to have been able to crack my shell a bit. I think a conversation in person will really help me make my decision. Any advice would be appreciated.

1g1552u,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1g1552u/i_feel_physically_sick_and_lazy_everyday_i_didnt/,I feel physically sick and lazy everyday. I didn’t used to be like this,"I used to be so active going to the gym 5+ days a week doing an hour of hard cardio burning 700+ calories lifting weights and all while drinking 1-2 300mg energy drinks everyday and even taking my adhd medication.

I don’t know what shifted. I’m still physically fit and have a good body but I haven’t worked out in two weeks. When I do workout, it’s usually just to get my full body strength training so I stay toned and I do 10-20 min of cardio 1-3 times a week. I’d find it an accomplishment if I went to the gym 3 + times. My diet and drinking water isn’t amazing, but I mean I’m not 100% a healthy eater. I don’t think that means I should feel this miserable. I eat some fast food, some cereal with fiber, maybe chipotle some days, a sandwhich, smoked salmon, steak, it just varies. But I don’t sit there eating 5 cheeseburgers and chocolate and candy all day.  And with water, I literally feel sick after drinking!!!!

I have wayyyy less caffeine as well. I used to have 2 reigns or 2 large Starbucks a day even with my adhd stimulant medication and I was fine. Now I have 2 redbulls which yes they have sugar but way less ingredients and caffeine. Or I’ll have 1-2 coffees with McDonald’s but again wayyyy less caffeine than my Starbucks. I’d always add extra shots from Starbucks as well.

I started taking supplements a couple days ago. Vitamin B,C,D, zinc, folate, biotin, magnesium citrate and glycinate, fish oil, collagen peptides, and my cereal has iron in it. I am definitely deficient because I always have cold hands and feet. I’m hoping this would help.

For example, today, I took my adhd medication with food as well. And took my supplements with food. I had a grilled cheese, fiber cereal with milk, went out for coffee, and half of a steak chipotle bowl. I kept feeling nauseous on and off. I wanted to go to the gym, so I ate some more chipotle so I have something in my stomach. But I still felt SO sick! Not just that, it’s like I had this laziness and lack of motivation within me. 

I used to do so much cardio burning 10,11,12+ calories a minute for 45-70 minutes everyday. Now??? I try to burn 5-8 calories a minute and by 10-20 minutes I am almost about to throw up and need to stop. Also, this nausea from cardio started suddenly. Usually I’d end up throwing up after ACTUALLY overworking my self and burning 800 calories. But out of nowhere I started feeling sick after 10 minutes and would have to stop and it still continue when I decreased the intensity. Come to look at it, I am nauseous now and have been for the past 2 hours.

My sleep is shit no matter how much I try to fix it. I think this is just something I need to fix by forcing myself to put my phone away early and getting black out curtains.

I take care of my self to an extent. I’m hygienic, don’t drink too much caffeine, take care of my skin, have things going for me, still work out, saved up a lot of money, married at 23, want kids, am attractive, I am always wanting to fix my life but I just can’t. I make to do lists but it’s like there’s some laziness demotivating me. I am aware this can be a deficiency in my body which is why I did lots of research to make sure I take the right supplements. For example, I know for sure I don’t get enough vitamin D. Sometimes it’s because of my sleep. My schedule for sleep is very inconsistent. I am a housewife so I stay up late which I think is fine as long as I stick to a consistent schedule, and this is why I wanna get black out curtains. Sometimes it’s my body feeling slightly nauseous or very nauseous. This is very demotivating. And sometimes it’s just this laziness in me but it feels like my body just doesn’t feel healthy. 

I can’t explain it. It’s not like “I have the perfect circumstances in terms of how my body feels. But I still wanna be lazy” no, it USED to feel like that which made it easier to just force my self to not be lazy. But now it’s like my body feels physically sick even if I’m not nauseous. I literally cannot explain it. Like I’m not sick and I know I’m not sick. I also sometimes get pain from my back that comes and goes which REALLY messes up my life and makes me hate everything, but that’s on and off , just like a cherry on top when I’m already feeling horrible lol. But my body feels unhealthy. I don’t vape or drink alcohol or smoke weed.

This whole nausea thing has been more often though. I’d notice it on and off. My whole mood changes and I just feel like doing nothing. I don’t know my energy and life just feel horrible. I don’t think I am a complete loser and I don’t think I am perceived as a loser, but I am a loser to an extent because if I was someone else who saw my everyday life, I’d think they’re a loser. I’m not looking for sympathy. I don’t think I’m this complete hopeless loser but I’m just honest with myself and my life can seriously use some improving.

Download the Costa Coffee app and enter a referral code to get a **free** sweat treat of your choice. You **need to opt into receive marketing comms** to get the free cake voucher emailed to you.

New customers will **also receive 5 free “beans”** (Costa Loyalty scheme) following your first purchase. This is in addition to the 1 point awarded for downloading the app. You collect 1 bean for every purchased drink (2 beans if you bring a reusable cup). Once you have accumulated 10 beans you can claim a free drink.

Steps:

* **Download the Costa app**. Direct from your App Store or find a link ([here](https://www.costa.co.uk/costa-club#app-promo)).
* **Register** and enter the referral code **C9HgF**
* Remember to opt into comms to receive the free cake email on your birthday!
* To receive the “free” 5 beans first **make a purchase at Costa and scan the app when paying**.
* The 5 free beans will be **credited to your account within 48 hours** (it was immediately for me).

Pro tip, if it’s anything like Caffè Nero then you only get 1 free bean per drinks order maximum (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 beans (or 4 if using reusable cups).

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response—or lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live? 

Who knows....I do not. But these are indicidive of a future full of b movie plot garbage that are based on Wattpad tropes with no clear details and no plot to get into, so that sucks.",1,1728635417.0,writingthruit,0,1.0,False

They were broken up for a while and she was persistent, she would even stalk him, create/buy fake social media accounts, attempt to break into his house to get in touch with him
I’ll call this girl Susie. Susie (27) and I were never friends but we would go for coffee here and there. Not so long ago, before John and Susie got back together and they were still broken up, John told me that she’d talk behind my back, she would question mine and my bf’s relationship, she would say things about me, my family, she would say to John what if you had a girlfriend that was like myself (implying there’s something wrong with me). Now that they’re back together she has made several attempts to hang out and I just ditch her, I reply very cold to her messages, she knows I know that she talks about me but no apology from her side. I saw John not long ago and I told him I’d not talk to her unless SHE acknowledges that she messed up, says things to my face and that approach comes for example, ‘hey I think we should have a talk’ instead of talking to me as if nothing has happened, inviting me to hang out, showing up at my house asking if I can come out so we can see each other, saying to John ‘we should plan a trip with Monica (me) and her bf’. John says she’s not the type of person who would take that approach but he thinks ‘I should be the bigger person and reach out so that we sit down and talk’ because she doesn’t have that ability and I do. If I confronted her, I would expose her and say everything to her face, she would not be expecting an ambush. Is he right about me reaching out? (Although I did nothing wrong). Am I wrong for treating her coldly or would I be better if I just told her as it is?
When they were broken up John would say the worst things about her and now he says ‘no she’s not a bad person, she had good intentions, she always asks about you, expresses her concern about you’. It’s just John’s coping mechanism of convincing himself that he’s right in taking this garbage person who would harass him back. 
I would really appreciate your thoughts. It is important to me as my bf and John are best friends so I would have to show up at birthdays, New Years is coming up. Not showing up would not be an option for me because of my bf, plus why should Susie’s present make me want to miss things. Thanks a lot guys",2,1728634902.0,FriendshipAdvice,1,1.0,False

1. My relationships improve. And I would like to beat this addiction for my GF to make sure she becomes my wife 

2. Quality of life. During my 20 day streak I was actually living. Getting up easy. Enjoying mornings rather than being in a slumber. Having good quality conversations and enjoying little things such as tea‘s and coffee. 

3. Ambition. Ever since I‘ve been addicted my ambitions have faded. During the 20 days my ambition has come back. I would like more of this. 

This is probably the most difficult aspect however as It means I become unsatisfied with daily life because I want more sometimes driving me to the behaviours. However I think I can combat this through the next 2 points 

4. Productivity. Through the ambition I was able to channel motivation into productivity such as applying for jobs and ensuring I get out of current situation. 

5. Real sexual desires. During the 20 days I was able to channel the desires toward my GF as well as experiencing benefits such as proper morning wood. 

6. Strength. I‘ve been going to the gym for about 1 1/2 years and during the 20 days I felt stronger and more disciplined than ever. 

7. becoming the man I want to be. This was the most exciting thing about the journey and an irreplaceable feeling. The feeling of actual progress. 

So those are the reasons and here is to a new day 1: Friday the 11th of October.
