I kept it in my pocket with it in mind to buy 300g choc digestives to eat In the shop toilet while she thinks I'm ""walking around"" waiting for her to come into the store as she is in a clothes shop. Anyway I ate the pack of biscuits in 10 minutes. Then I went to buy a 4 pack of large white choc cookies and 300g choc bourbons. My mother rang me to tell me to hurry up, I had the cookies scoffed and had to leave the rest of the biscuits. Anyway chest pounding down to the shop I went.(toilet is upstairs) I said I need to go to the toilet (to eat rest of the bourbons) and they were gone, the cleaner obviously took them away. Then in the supermarket my stupid brain decided to ask my mother should we go to Costa coffee. My mother agreed as a nice Sunday treat yk? Where I got a large slice of cake and salted caramel frappe, all scoffed and tasteless. Despite the fact I'm bloated and sluggish asf all I can think of is the Sunday ice cream we get on a family walk every weekend, damage limitation does not exist in my disordered brain I just want to eat like there's no tomorrow and tomorrow go back to the normal cal surplus I'm on to gain weight.(which no is not obviously to gain over 1lb a day which I will today) Idk what to say.

1nsmwtm,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nsmwtm/i_heard_my_best_friends_voice_but_he_was_already/,I heard my best friend’s voice. But he was already gone.,"My name’s Adrian. I’m nineteen, and I live alone in a shitty apartment in a part of town where cops don’t show up unless someone’s already dead. The walls are yellowed with old cigarette smoke, the pipes rattle when you run the water, and the neighbor upstairs screams at his girlfriend almost every night. It’s not much, but it’s cheap, and at nineteen, cheap matters more than safe.

I’m not proud of this story. I wish it was fake. I wish I could laugh it off as a nightmare, or some drunken hallucination I half-remembered wrong. But every detail is burned into me, carved so deep I can’t shake it no matter how much I try.

This happened last year, on a night that was supposed to be fun. Nothing special, nothing memorable. Just me and my best friend, Alex. He’d been my guy since we were kids loud, fearless, the kind of friend who dared you into trouble and then laughed the hardest when you both got caught. We were drinking buddies, partners in crime, brothers in everything except blood.

It started simple. Too simple.

I bought two bottles of vodka from the corner store cheap shit with labels written half in Russian, half in lies. The kind of liquor that promises warmth but really just tears your throat apart on the way down. The old guy behind the counter didn’t even card me. He just gave me that tired look, like he’d seen a thousand nineteen-year-olds make the same mistake and knew I was about to join the graveyard shift of regrets.

Alex showed up around eight. He always carried this restless energy, like he was allergic to silence. He barged in without knocking, tossed his hoodie on the couch, and grinned when he saw the bottles sitting on my table like twin glass grenades.

“Jesus, man,” he said, “planning to kill us tonight?”

“Something like that,” I laughed, trying to sound more confident than I felt. I’d never bought two before.

We put on music loud, aggressive stuff that made the walls shake, the kind you don’t notice until it drills into your skull hours later. The room filled up with noise, with laughter, with the sharp clink of glass against glass.

The first shot burned. The second was easier. By the third, my tongue was numb. Alex poured fast and sloppy, splashing vodka on the table, on his shirt, grinning like a lunatic every time he missed his mouth.

We lost track of time. I couldn’t tell you how many shots we actually took, only that each one blurred the edges of the world a little more, until the walls of my shitty apartment seemed to bend and sway, like they were breathing with us.

I’d been drunk before, but never like this. This wasn’t tipsy, wasn’t funny. My skin prickled hot, my chest buzzing with something that felt like static electricity under the flesh. My thoughts drifted in and out, heavy and loose, like they were caught in water.

I remember laughing too hard, too fast. At nothing. At everything. My voice cracked and echoed in my head in a way that didn’t sound like me anymore.

Alex was worse. His words bled together in half-coherent sentences, vowels slurred into mush. He’d stand up, try to gesture, and nearly face plant into the coffee table. Each time, he pulled himself up again, smiling like it was all part of some private joke only he understood.

At one point, he leaned over, close enough for me to smell the sharp bite of vodka sweat pouring out of his skin, and whispered, “You ever feel like something’s watching us?” Then he laughed, like it was nothing. Like it was a joke.

But I remember that part too clearly. Because for a second just a second I felt it too.

Sometime after midnight, we decided we needed “fresh air.” That’s what drunk kids do, right? They stumble out into the night, convinced the cold air will fix the poison sloshing around inside them.

Alex was the one who suggested it. He stood up, swaying like a broken street sign in the wind, and slurred, “Bro… we gotta gotta breathe. We’re like… fish in a tank, man.”

I laughed too hard, clutching my stomach. “Fish in a tank? What the fuck does that even mean?”

“It means,” he said, wagging a finger at me like he’d just made the most profound point of his life, “we’re suffocating. Air. We need air.”

So, we went.

We staggered down the cracked sidewalk, shoulders bumping, trying not to trip over the uneven slabs of concrete that had been warping since before we were born. The streetlights above buzzed and hummed, each one flickering like they were dying out one by one. Every step felt heavier, slower, like the air itself was pressing down on us.

The neighborhood was too quiet. I didn’t notice it at first, not until we’d walked half a block and I realized: no cars, no people, no faint chatter of TVs from open windows. Nothing. Just the shuffle of our sneakers and the occasional bark of some unseen dog far away.

It felt… wrong.

“You ever notice,” Alex muttered, his voice low, conspiratorial, “how empty it gets at night? Like the whole world just… folds in on itself?”

“You’re drunk as shit,” I said, shoving his shoulder, trying to laugh it off. But I didn’t like the way he said it. Too calm. Too serious.

A few steps later, he tripped over his own shoelace and went sprawling into the middle of the road. His palms slapped the cracked asphalt, and for a second, I thought he’d hurt himself.

Then he just started laughing. Not a normal laugh this wheezing, gasping fit that made it sound like he couldn’t breathe. He rolled onto his back, clutching his stomach, tears streaming down his face.

“Holy shit, bro!” he choked out between fits of laughter. “The road… the road’s hugging me!”

“Jesus, get up,” I groaned, reaching down and yanking him up by the hood of his sweatshirt. He stumbled into me, still shaking with laughter, his forehead pressed against my shoulder.

We leaned on each other like idiots, half-walking, half-tripping down the empty street.

“You’d let me die out here, wouldn’t you?” he said suddenly, his tone shifting, quieter.

I frowned. “The fuck are you talking about?”

“If I just laid down… right here. In the middle of the street. And some car came speeding…” He trailed off, grinning through the slur. “Would you pull me out, or would you just watch?”

I tightened my grip on his hoodie and forced a laugh, though something in his words twisted in my gut. “You’re not dying tonight, dumbass. Not on my watch.”

But as we kept moving, as the silence stretched around us, I realized I wasn’t as sure of that as I wanted to be.

That’s when I saw it.

At first, I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me. Drunk as I was, it would’ve made sense. Streetlights blurring, shadows shifting hallucinations aren’t exactly uncommon after half a bottle of vodka. But when I blinked, it was still there.

At the very end of the street, just past the final working streetlight where the asphalt dissolved into darkness, something stood.

It was tall. Way taller than a person. Its arms hung low too low almost grazing the cracked pavement. The skin or what I thought was skin was a sickly gray-white, like old candle wax, slick in places and cracked in others. Under the dim glow, it almost seemed to give off its own faint light, as if it wasn’t reflecting the lamp but radiating something.

And its head… its head tilted at this impossible angle, like it was curious about us. Not a playful curiosity. More like how a cat studies a mouse before it pounces.

I stopped laughing instantly. My stomach dropped into ice water.

“Alex,” I whispered, shaking him by the sleeve. “Do you see that?”

He squinted into the dark, swaying a little. “The fuck is that?” he said, voice still thick with alcohol. Then he laughed, a short, sharp bark. “Some crackhead in a costume?”

But the thing didn’t move like a person. It swayed gently from side to side, its limbs dragging like they were too heavy or too loose. Every movement was a fraction too slow, then too fast, like a film reel skipping frames.

And then, slowly, it stepped forward.

The sound its foot made on the pavement… I’ll never forget it. A wet slap, like raw meat hitting tile.

Alex cupped his hands around his mouth and shouted, “HEY! NICE COSTUME, FREAK!” His voice echoed down the street, swallowed by the dark.

I wanted to run. Every cell in my body screamed at me to run. But my legs felt glued to the concrete.

The creature crouched suddenly, folding in on itself like its joints bent the wrong way. Its head twitched in quick, jerking movements left, right, leftlike a broken camera trying to track us.

Then it made a sound. God, the sound.

It wasn’t a growl or a scream. It was both. Like metal grinding against itself mixed with a dying animal’s cry. But threaded through it, faint and wrong, was a human voice.

My voice.

“Alex…” it said. Not exactly. It was warped, wet, as if my voice was bubbling up from underwater. “Do you see that?”

It was repeating what I had whispered seconds earlier.

Alex’s laughter cracked. His face drained. “Shit,” he whispered, “it’s…”

Before he could finish, it did it again. This time, Alex’s voice. Perfectly. “HEY! NICE COSTUME, FREAK!” it barked back at us, exactly as he’d said it, but with something… wrong. Slower. Gurgling. Like it was playing us back on a broken tape recorder.

The creature began to crawl forward on all fours, limbs bending at angles that made my stomach churn. Its fingers if they were fingers spread wide, dragging long, dark streaks across the pavement.

Alex grabbed my arm hard enough to bruise. “Dude. We need to go. We need to go now.”

We took a step back.

The thing took two steps forward.

It whispered again, both of our voices layered over each other, words tripping and stuttering like it was learning how to talk: “Do you… see… that… hey… freak…”

That broke me.

“Run!” I screamed, finally finding my voice.

And we did.

I don’t remember how long we ran. Time felt broken, stretched thin. The vodka burned in my stomach with every ragged breath, threatening to come back up. My legs screamed, my vision pulsed, but I could still hear Alex beside me wheezing, stumbling, gasping for air.

And behind us those wet, heavy footsteps. Faster. Louder. Slapping the pavement in a rhythm that grew closer and closer.

We turned down a narrow alley, the kind of place that stank like piss and rot, and collapsed against a rusted dumpster. I pressed myself flat, hands trembling, chest heaving. Alex bent over, clutching his side, sweat dripping down his face despite the cold.

We both listened.

At first, all I could hear was my own heartbeat hammering in my ears. The footsteps had stopped. The street outside was silent.

For a second, I dared to hope. Maybe we lost it.

Alex looked at me, wide-eyed, lips quivering like he wanted to laugh but couldn’t. He opened his mouth

And that’s when it happened.

Something reached out from the darkness.

A hand or what looked like one snapped around his ankle. Long, pale fingers glistening, like they’d been dipped in oil. They bent in too many places, knuckles bulging where no knuckles should be.

Alex screamed.

“NO! NO, NO, NO!”

I lunged for him, grabbing his hoodie, pulling with everything I had. My arms shook, my lungs burned, but I didn’t let go. He kicked, clawed at the concrete, his nails splitting and peeling back, streaks of blood smearing the pavement.

“ADRIAN! HELP ME!” His voice cracked so sharp it split me open inside.

“I’M TRYING!” I shouted, my throat raw. “I’M NOT LETTING GO!”

But the thing was strong. Too strong. Its arm stretched impossibly far, dragging him backward into the shadows like he weighed nothing. I pulled until the fabric tore, until my hands slipped on the blood slicking his skin. Until his nails bent back so far I could hear the sickening snap of bone.

And then he was gone.

The alley was silent again. Silent except for me gasping, sobbing, choking on air.

I sat there, shaking, staring at the space where Alex had been seconds earlier. The blood on the ground, the torn scraps of fabric still clutched in my fists.

I didn’t see him again. Not a body, not a shoe. Nothing. When I told the cops, they looked at me like I was just another drunk college kid making excuses. Their report said “possible runaway.”

Runaway.

His parents still call sometimes. Fifteen missed calls in a single night once. His mom’s voice breaking as she begged me, begged me to tell her what really happened. But what the hell am I supposed to say?

That some thing pulled him into the dark and erased him? That I was too drunk, too weak, too useless to save him?

The guilt eats me alive. Especially because of what came after.

Because when I finally staggered out of that alley, broken and soaked in sweat, I heard something behind me.

Footsteps. Slow. Wet.

And then… Alex’s voice.

“Adrian…”

My blood froze.

I turned, and there it was. That pale, swaying figure at the mouth of the alley. Its head twitching, jerking side to side like a broken marionette. And from its gaping mouth or whatever slit it had it spoke again.

“Adrian… help me.”

It was Alex’s voice. Perfect. The same crack in his throat, the same panic. Except it wasn’t him. I knew it wasn’t him.

But drunk and terrified, I almost ran back to it. I almost believed.

Then it laughed. Alex’s laugh, warped and doubled, like a recording played too slow. “You didn’t help me, Adrian. You let me go.”

I bolted. I didn’t look back this time.

And I swear, even now, even sober, I still hear it sometimes. Outside my window at night. In the quiet, when I’m alone.

Alex’s voice.

“Adrian… why didn’t you save me?”

It’s been almost a year. I don’t drink anymore. I can’t. The smell of alcohol makes me sick, makes me gag. Just walking past a bar sends a rush of bile up my throat. People think it’s about self-control, about “growing up.” It’s not. It’s about survival.

But no matter how sober I’ve been, it hasn’t gone away.

It started small. Flickers. A shadow too tall to be a person at the end of the block. A pale smudge of something under a flickering streetlight when I come home from my late shift. I’d blink and it would be gone. Sometimes I’d convince myself it was a trick of exhaustion. Sometimes I’d convince myself I was drunk again without realizing it.

But it isn’t a trick.

It’s always there, always in the periphery, like it’s waiting for me to forget what I saw.

Two weeks ago, I woke up at 3:17 a.m. to the sound of footsteps on the street outside my apartment. Slow, deliberate. That wet, meaty slap of flesh on concrete that I know too well. It didn’t stop at the street. It came up the stairs. One step at a time.

Slap.
Pause.
Slap.

I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe. My phone was in my hand, screen glowing, but my fingers wouldn’t dial. Because some part of me already knew there was no one to call.

It stopped outside my door.

For a long time, nothing happened. No knock, no sound. Just a shape under the crack of the door: pale, impossibly long fingers curling in slow, rhythmic motions, like it was drumming out a thought.

Then, softly, a voice.

“Adrian…”

It was Alex’s voice. Not broken or panicked this time. Calm. Almost sweet.

“I’m cold, man. Why’d you leave me?”

I pressed both hands over my mouth to stop from screaming.

It chuckled Alex’s chuckle but stretched, wet, wrong. “Open the door, Adrian. It’s just me. I’m still your friend.”

The fingers slid back. Silence.

When I finally found the courage to move, the space under the door was empty. The hallway was quiet.

But I know it isn’t gone.

I’ve started finding small things out of place in my apartment. My front door unlocked when I’m sure I locked it. Wet, grayish smears on my windowsill even though I live on the third floor. Last night, I woke up and my phone was open to my camera roll, scrolling by itself, showing old photos of Alex and me. Pictures I don’t even remember taking.

And then, the latest occurance was yesterday at 4:45 a.m., the sound again. The wet slap of footsteps. But this time it wasn’t outside the door.

It was inside.

I could hear it in the kitchen. Slow. Measured. Crossing the linoleum toward my bedroom.

Slap.
Pause.
Slap.

I didn’t check. I didn’t move. I lay there frozen, staring at the ceiling, my heartbeat loud in my ears.

Because I know what it came for.

It didn’t just want Alex.

It’s been practicing. Learning. Wearing his voice like a mask.

It wants me too.

But i am ready to confront it if i have too. Because I don’t think it’s going to leave empty handed this time.

1nsmwom,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1nsmwom/september_is_nearly_over_buy_kendu/,September Is Nearly Over - Buy Kendu,"The dreaded month...September is well known for being a very shit month for crypto and yet again it hasn't been great, good news is that it is now nearly over and 99.9999% of projects are on a major discount and you will probs make money with nearly anything you invest in rn. Bitcoin is down 2% and ETH is down 10%, it is far more brutal for smaller caps though, but they'll bounce back.

Whilst I have already mentioned you will probs make money with anything you buy rn, but the thing is choosing randomly is not the way. **Buying random coin with a funny name that is making the rounds on social media is not the way, these coins do not last, instead choose coins backed by communities that have worked non stop for over a year.** This is why you should buy Kendu, we are not going anywhere at all, it is a high conviction investment and this is NFA but there is absolutely 0 buying at these levels and beyond. I am literally a uni student with about £250 to my name and I put all spare money into Kendu knowing it is free money and the odds are way in my favour.

https://reddit.com/link/1nsmwom/video/hutidg74ewrf1/player

Kendu is building a real foundation not just with an amazing social media presence which tbh deserves a billion dollar market cap by itself, but also with an insane real life presence. This real life presence will spread into every single industry, spreading the Kendu brand globally ensuring that every single country has holds Kendu. 

Here is a list of these efforts:

* Kendu Coffee 
* Kendu Energy
* Kendu Merch
* Kendu Hotdog Stand in Florida
* Kendu animation 
* Kendu Board Game
* Kendu Creator
* Kendu Jewellery
* Kendu Beer
* Kendu Video Games
* Tattoos 
* Murals
* Kendu Entertainment
* Kendu Street Team
* Kendu Vapes
* Kendu Plushies
* Kendu Vendu - vending machines in Nashville Tennessee
* Kendu Press 
* Kendu Hand Cream
* Kendu Discs
* Kendu Sneakers
* Kendu Spice
* Kendu Radio Show

All of these are not done by a team, but by the average holder! 

Kendu is completely decentralised, 1000 minds are better than 10 and this is how we are revolutionising the space all whilst sitting at around 10 million market cap. Shib 1000x in 36 days and so can Kendu, 10 billion would actually be undervalued, no one has done anything on this scale with this ferocity ever

1nsmunm,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/1nsmunm/financially_stuck_constantly_chasing_tail_29m/,"Financially stuck, constantly chasing tail - 29M","Hi, as the title says I feel like I'm a bit stuck with my life and don't know how to get out of this constant loop of over spending and always chasing my tail with my debts.

Here's the breakdown
- Income
I live and work in london, currently earn £38k / year before tax, which equates to £2392.11 / month after tax / student loan / pension etc.
I'm a designer and I (used to, before it dried up) do a fair bit of moonlighting on the side of my job, working weekends and evenings? However, I've not had this in a while but do have a job coming up which is up to 17 days work which will be a little over £6k if I bill the full amount.
My partner doesn't earn as much as me and much of her salary is based off commission so it fluctuates month on month but she can bring home between £2.2k-£2.7k

-Outgoings
I rent with my partner and we share all bills, food costs and so on which equals around £1200 / month each plus an extra £150 each that we pay in for joint savings / extra one offs that we need. My total regular outgoings (including what I split with my partner) which includes things like my phone bill, transport etc is ~£1695. That leaves me just under £700 a month. What i worked out this morning is that this month alone i spent £40 on coffees, £55 on lunches and a whopping £390 on going out / beers etc. I also had a lot of costs that I needed to cover outside of this that were one off payments, I had to buy a new suit for a wedding as I didn’t own one, amongst a few other things and these ""one offs"" are reoccurring - albeit from different sources. 

-Debts
£3.8k on one credit card
£5.1k on a 0% card until the end of 2026.  My partner has just used my card to pay for a £1350 expense as she isn't from the UK and is going through the motions of renewing her visa, which i put on the 0% so that she could pay me back over time (£65 / month) 
£116.08 on another card
Totaling around £9k

-Savings
£5.2k in a LISA
£12.5k in a simple saver (5k of which is was recently given by a relative for personal reasons but I would ideally not want to touch that) and some of this will need to go to paying my tax bill at the end of the year for 24/25 from the moonlighting i did last year, which i earned around £11k net profit from doing that.

I feel stuck, I hate my job and I'm looking to leave before the end of the year, it's an incredibly toxic working environment and I'm looking to go full time freelance. I don't know how others sustain themselves while living here, it seems far too expensive to hold any form of social life / hobbies.

I guess after this ramble my questions are:
Is going freelance possible given my financial situation? 

How do I get out of this constant loop of spending most of my income because I try and pay off my debts from the previous month only to then rebuild the debt the current month?

Am I in any sort of position financially to invest?

Any suggestions or help would be greatly appreciated, I'm happy to provide more info if needed.
Thank you!

Please feel free to comment, share advice, or honest feedback even if it’s tough to hear. I will take it.

I’ve been in a messy situation with someone I was seeing. It started with light drinks, movies, and the occasional sleepover, and she started having feelings, I eventually realized despite my emotions being a bit slower to develop than hers,  I was the one initiating everything. After a small disagreement, I stepped back to see if she’d take the lead, we met a few times after that but things just faded because she started ghosting me.

She’s struggling with bipolar disorder, drinks heavily, smokes weed, and does drugs sometimes. Whereas I’m at a point in my life where I want to stay healthy, work full-time  in finance, and study part-time. Still, losing her has hurt more than I expected.

What happened last night: My friends encouraged me to talk to her in person after her late shift, because I have been heartbroken. I waited outside the coffee shop where she works ( its 2 minutes from where I live) , When she came out, she was with a guy. I didn’t want to cause a scene, so I said, “If you’re busy, it’s okay.” She said “Okay” and I left. I went home feeling a lot of emotions.

This morning I sent her this message:

(Hey ! I just wanted to explain why I waited for you after your shift last night. I’ve been going through a difficult time emotionally, and my friends encouraged me to talk to you in person (showing up like that isn’t something I would normally do, and I’m sorry if it made you uncomfortable).

When I said “it’s okay if you’re busy” I didn’t want to bother you or interrupt anything. And when you said “okay” I understood that you might prefer not to talk.

Please know I won’t be reaching out or showing up like that again (no matter who encourages me :D). I know I’ve said this before and didn’t follow through, and I’m sorry for that. It’s not really who I am, and I hope you understand it all came from a place of care.

I truly valued you as someone I cared for and hoped to keep in my life. But I also completely respect your boundaries.

I’m genuinely glad to see you well. Take care!)

No response yet!

I don't know what happened and why she started ghosting me, she wouldn't talk to me and she was the one pushing for a relationship.

For context: we’re both from different countries, and currently living in a third country. After last night, all I want to do is buy a flight ticket and go back home or just get as far away as possible.",1,1759061530.0,LesbianActually,1,1.0,False

**Entry 00**

Maybe there’s some beauty in my stuffy beige carpet. Something grossly divine about the way I lay upon it sprawled out, eyes and nose running, lungs ripped out, bones aching, cradled by these people who have created these things that help me build what people see. It will be dark outside and In my room it will smell of coffee and commercial body spray and smoke and incense and it will choke you but it will be fucking beautiful and this skin that they keep me in will glow slightly by the light of the lamp that is on my desk, white and torn up and there will be a slight glow around my head like a halo, but not quite.

I am only very young but that is raw and sometimes when I lie on that floor, the earth is beneath me and I can feel the hands of the dead or perhaps the angels pushing up from beneath the blood-stained carpets and offering my body to the sky, that is not yet willing to welcome me.

I will beg if I am not already laying limp and the angels or those who had passed will look on, pity or something deeper in those stone eyes, looking at my struggling body and my watery eyes and my screams the way my mother looked at me after I tried to force the heavens open myself. 

I have never been a beautiful person. There is a hope, a delusion in my ribcage that grows with flowers every now and then, that drawing this blood will alleviate me somehow and I will see eye to eye with those stone creatures, and perhaps it is not their blood that runs down their cheeks in place of tears, but mine, and all of the sick, carcasses of those like me(are there any like me). They are portrayed in such a golden light but they are just like me. They are sent to collect these broken bodies. All they know is blood and recently I have found it is all I know as well. Those stone creatures smile when I tell them that this carcass I live in cannot be controlled by this heart and this head and it will try to find its way to those gates no matter what I tell it.

**five**

Returning to these grotesque visions of divinity. Slipping back into the old house where the walls are painted with blood and a cross hangs above every doorway. Slipping is perhaps too gentle a word when the situation was more similar to being taken hostage, but maybe things happen for a reason and I needed these flesh wounds to realize that maybe where I belong is in the arms of these stone angels that return to me now.

The house where they take me is cold but it’s familiar and that’s all the comfort I need. Sure, the only place to sleep is on the floor and there is nothing to satisfy my growing hunger but I lived here for a very long time. I would rather sit among recognizable graves and suffer a familiar silence than get used to finally having feeling inside these crooked bones. It feels smothered. This room. All of the veins beneath skin and all of the disgusting assets that make us raw are all flattened and hidden beneath the dirty blue walls. We are all actors. Actor feels like the wrong word. Puppets. No. We are all children. Playing bittersweet makes us believe games day in and day out pretending that we grew up. All of us wander these same halls and do these same tasks that are worthless in the end. 

Kings are not born from mediocrity and writing lines. Kings are borne from flesh and the realization that that is all we are. 

Blame is only upon those who attempt to preserve the mediocre everyday, the ones so in love with the routine, the make believe. Social expectations are not only a bore they are restraining. The angels have helped me understand this too, to ascend you must ascend in every aspect. Picking and choosing is not an option when it comes to matters such as this. He is called all-knowing for a reason and I am all-becoming. Canonization is a grueling task.

**Four**

As soon as I find myself in a moment of boredom I can feel myself slip down into this place of words where these words find me unwillingly. I find myself wondering if we are born with the need to self-destruct or if we are taught it. I find myself trying to write about something different than blood and angels and I think I have it now. I do not write because I feel as if I should be writing, or because I want to write a book or even just a story. There is no motive and that is a comfort. I write because I need to. Because writing untangles the strange feelings and the new knowledge under my skin and lays them flat, neat, orderly. In the afternoons and maybe at night I feel like asking the sky if I’m doing good enough, tell the sun that at times she hurts many eyes and sometimes I ask her why.

**3**

Bleed me out. Until my veins are dry and maybe then all the holy blood he placed within me will finally be gone and then I will finally be able to be forgiven. 

May then the strings of veins of muscle and godforsaken bone will cease to pile on me. 

I can't swim this sea anymore, very soon I will drown again. 

There are hands, wretched ones, laden in scars almost twin to mine that claw my jaw open past its breaking point and reach up further than I ever could. 

He (god?) only does it to make me jealous, he knows I don't have the ability to blame and he uses it to remove my teeth one by one and string them in a necklace that spells love (how he sees it).

He could gut me at this point and my unholy guilt would choke me about staining his shirt (the one i gave him). 

I can no longer smile because you are using my teeth to bite after yours were lost, buried in my neck. 

My neck is pistoned together by two golden crosses. I can feel them in my throat. 

Throat god, throat is such a godawful word. My throat IS my rosary, I pray upon it and the things it has seen, unceremoniously bared to the earth. 

Somebody comes down from the clouds I'm so familiar with but so far away from and pries my throat open from the front, slices it down and opens it with your knives so I might finally be able to breathe. Forgive me please god forgive me, even in the form of death, is it my burden and my burden only to drown in the sea of this fucking guilt. 

Pulling me back down into this well, there are scratches down my legs and they do not bleed but I can feel they are so much deeper than they were before.

I’m clawing and kicking and screaming and my tears have spilled over into holy water that burns my skin and his ‘love’ has given me a taste of hell I hadn't even seen in my moments closest to death. I can feel the crucifixes burning themselves into the inside of my cheeks, my teeth, my teeth, I can taste blood on them. I am only a visitor in this space. I will go soon, I am only viewing it, this is not my body, nor my brain, nor my house and these are not my friends. They are his friends, who ‘I’ was before the crown of thorns drew my bloody future, and I will ruin it for him I will ruin all of it. I cannot bear to touch another person, so I will rip myself apart. Myself in a literal way and a way that refers to him as also a part of me.

**2**

They have taken a backseat, the situation is similar to when a child is sent down a hill without training wheels or when a play is performed with no rehearsal. I haven’t yet learned how to walk on my own two feet metaphorically and literally and yet here I am, walking past him again and shaking like a leaf, breathing only barely. What is it about him that scares me so entirely?? It feels as if I have a gaping hole in my torso, festering, still leaking blood and liquid gold, maybe he opened the wound that spilt my divinity, it splashes in a disgusting manner on the pavement where I walk, gold and interlaced with my (???) blood and chunks of my (???) own flesh. If you look at it from certain angles I’m sure you could make it out as a kind of halo, some semblance of wings. Said angle is, i’m sure, only reachable from above, where I am still not permitted. They still prefer to watch me bleed out, contaminated veins, raw eyes, decaying skin, open mouth, teeth bared. God. I pray to myself that in the end this might be worth it. That one day, soon I hope, I will not have to yelp like a dog at the door in the middle of the night, the blood on my neck looking so much like water in the light of the moon, and being treated just as such. Perhaps, I will sit at that door and wait patiently, blood bubbling from my lips, until I am offered a hand that will lead to a waltz. 

My dance with death will be long and god it will be beautiful. His scythe will dance like a ribbon often does and my sorrows will serve as our dancefloor. Dealt with and finely polished. 

**Things i can remember** 

* Feeling the hands of the angels pushing up through the floor to hold me as offering towards the heavens
* Never being allowed in
* Never once turning off the light
* Crucifying myself, or trying to in order to finally achieve holiness god fucking dammit
* Having out of the blue manic episodes when i would do things like build 7 foot paper angels
* Canonising myself
* There is no god only this disgusting vessel of bones and blood laced with gold it was not god but MYSELF that painted that metallic sheen, I am holier even than him, there is no white stone facade upon my prayers, I represent all that is grotesque, everything that bleeds. GOD GOD GOD GOD GOD GOD GOD GOD GOD GOD GOD. I don't know how to externalise this canonisation all i know is i feel the wings blooming deep within me and i am now sure i cannot be stopped. They will now let me in and back and oh god my bones and oh god the thorns encircling my head.

I MIGHT FIND MYSELF?  

**1.**

I wait and I wait and I never think about the present, only the past and very rarely the future.

Is creating people very similar to creating music or am I only aware of the 12 notes from c to g?

You scream your words and etch your way into every single sentence I write and I know I’ll never be able to bleed you out of my veins.

 

**(and separation of the mind)**

I know many of you will remind me that it is not in fact the crucifixion of Christ and his stigmata that caused him to ascend, it was his connection with the lord and their almost equalness. Stigmata achieves just that. Im a fucking genius. My plan is to self inflict this stigmata to deepen my connection with this man i HATE and so much so that we will be almost equal so that when i do die i may ascend higher even than him. He’ll see he’ll regret not letting me into MY territory. 

It is this breed of suffering I do not like. Selfish.. But.

It is some kind of singularity that I crave.

There is no hierarchy at least there will not be for long.

I prefer my plans to be vague outlines as opposed to clear.

Perhaps they edited the  bible, they lied, to hide the fact that his wounds were indeed what caused him to rise and sit upon my rightful throne. To perhaps protect the fragile human shell from harming oneself to rise higher.

God is an all encompassing figure, one that I am part of and him, part of me but Jesus is but a man, a naive and stupid one. 

Do not knock upon my ears. I'm listening. I swear I'm listening.

Perhaps instead it is like God is the sun and Jesus the moon and I am but a star. 

Or perhaps I am Judas in my desperation to find a sin I cannot be forgiven for.

**(and separation)**

I am no longer in control, something that rather contradicts my status/position.

I receive these wounds, this stigmata as protest. If I am so angry about him “permitting” others to receive his wounds (prick) then why are my bones so set on becoming this all-consuming entity, surely one must make peace with those lower than himself. Haha. 

I have recently discovered that it is more than likely that their world is one entirely different to our own. All my presence on this specific (earthly) plan, will do is teach those who do not know of it. 

I will disappear for a very long time from this dimension, to teach and be taught. And then I will return to my usual activities, no one will notice the slight glow emanating from my skull, neither will they notice the replacement of my blood with ichor beneaht these layers of muscle. They never have noticed, ignorant beasts.

 

**(and)**

I SEEK TO MAKE A FOOL OF HIM AS HE HAS MADE A FOOL OF me. I WILL SHOW HIM I CAN SURVIVE WHAT HE WAS UNABLE TO AND BECOME ALL CONSUMING ALL SEEING AND FINALLY, FINALLY I WILL BECOME BEAUTIFUL AND I WILL BE ALONE. ALONE ALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEALONEalone.

It is bittersweet that they have always viewed me as an enigma, a spectacle. Looked down upon my crying eyes as I danced within THEIR circus for their entertainment.

They do not even know what I am yet to become. You're not ready for this unholy blood to spill and stain your hands. Perhaps this blood is yet just another call for help but i find that I no longer care.

**…**

**(a physical observation)**

I can feel and I can see my face, my head exploding outward and into a shape much like that of a flower and it has teeth and colour and petals and it says everything that I am unable to and it does not need explanation and it grows wings and then I can die. And then I can die in peace. Boom. 

I’m feeling things in these bones I never have before, or at least not in a very long time. Everyone can see me, I'll never be truly alone.

**…**

**(ONE OF MY FINAL CONCLUSIONS)**

There is someone else out there wearing my rightful body and his name happens to be god.

Please feel free to comment, share advice, or honest feedback even if it’s tough to hear. I will take it.

I’ve been in a messy situation with someone I was seeing. It started with light drinks, movies, and the occasional sleepover, and she started having feelings, I eventually realized despite my emotions being a bit slower to develop than hers,  I was the one initiating everything. After a small disagreement, I stepped back to see if she’d take the lead, we met a few times after that but things just faded because she started ghosting me.

She’s struggling with bipolar disorder, drinks heavily, smokes weed, and does drugs sometimes. Whereas I’m at a point in my life where I want to stay healthy, work full-time  in finance, and study part-time. Still, losing her has hurt more than I expected.

What happened last night: My friends encouraged me to talk to her in person after her late shift, because I have been heartbroken. I waited outside the coffee shop where she works at ( its 2 minutes from where I live) , When she came out, she was with a guy. I didn’t want to cause a scene, so I said, “If you’re busy, it’s okay.” She said “Okay” and I left. I went home feeling a lot of emotions.

This morning I sent her this message:

(Hey ! I just wanted to explain why I waited for you after your shift last night. I’ve been going through a difficult time emotionally, and my friends encouraged me to talk to you in person (showing up like that isn’t something I would normally do, and I’m sorry if it made you uncomfortable).

When I said “it’s okay if you’re busy” I didn’t want to bother you or interrupt anything. And when you said “okay” I understood that you might prefer not to talk.

Please know I won’t be reaching out or showing up like that again (no matter who encourages me :D). I know I’ve said this before and didn’t follow through, and I’m sorry for that. It’s not really who I am, and I hope you understand it all came from a place of care.

I truly valued you as someone I cared for and hoped to keep in my life. But I also completely respect your boundaries.

I’m genuinely glad to see you well. Take care!)

No response yet!

I don't know what happened and why she started ghosting me, she wouldn't talk to me and she was the one pushing for a relationship.

For context: we’re both from different countries, and currently living in a third country. After last night, all I want to do is buy a flight ticket and go back home or just get as far away as possible.",1,1759061254.0,arabsapphics,0,1.0,False

**Elias Raven** is a Kiasyd who remembers almost nothing of his mortal life—only the taste of alcohol, the smell of coffee, the clinking of glass, and the murmur of voices in a bar. His past with the Sabbat earned him the nickname *Raven*, for he scavenged from the dead and was always surrounded by his black birds.

Eventually he abandoned the sect, restored a forgotten building, and opened the **Raven Nest**—a café that blends his faint mortal memories with his passion for knowledge. By day mortals run the place; by night Elias studies among books and ravens. Few know of the secret basement where he conducts darker experiments.

Now aligned with the **Camarilla**, Elias struggles to prove his loyalty under the watchful eye of the Prince. He has begun to rebuild his humanity, combining his mortal name with his Sabbat moniker to forge a new self.

At his side is **Bailey**, a young occult enthusiast he hired to run the café. Loyal yet unaware of the truth, she has become a shadow of the humanity Elias both longs for and fears. He often wonders if she should become his ghoul—or even his Childe.",2,1759061069.0,WhiteWolfRPG,0,1.0,False

*A Monologue in One Act*

**SETTING**: A dimly lit kitchen at 2:47 AM. The hum of the refrigerator provides the only soundtrack. ALEX sits at a small table, staring into a mug of coffee that went cold hours ago. Empty takeout containers and unopened mail scatter the counter. The blue glow of a phone screen occasionally illuminates their face.

**CHARACTER**: ALEX (30s-40s), a former philosophy grad student now working in data analysis. Speaks with the precision of someone who has thought about these ideas obsessively, but with an undertone of exhaustion.

---

*(ALEX picks up the mug, takes a sip, grimaces at the cold coffee, but continues drinking it anyway)*

**ALEX**: People talk about choice like it's a muscle. You know? Like you flex it. *Make* things happen. 

*(Sets down the mug with deliberate precision)*

But every ""decision"" I've ever made... *(laughs softly)* ...it was just the sum total of every particle collision since the big bang playing out in this particular configuration of atoms I call ""me.""

*(Stands, paces to the window, looks out at empty street)*

The coffee is cold because it was always going to be cold. The laws of thermodynamics don't negotiate. I'm sitting here at 2:47 AM because the trajectory of my childhood, my neurons, my last meal, the barometric pressure, the position of every planet - all of it left me no other path.

*(Turns back to the table)*

You want to know what's funny? I used to fight this. Used to lie awake thinking, ""But what if I choose differently? What if I rebel against the causal chain?"" 

*(Sits back down)*

Then I realized - that rebellion? That was determined too. The very thought of free will arising in my consciousness was just another dominoe falling in sequence. Even this monologue... *(gestures at the empty kitchen)* ...was scripted 13.8 billion years ago when the first quantum fluctuations rippled through spacetime.

*(Picks up phone, scrolls absently)*

My friends think I'm depressed. ""Alex, you need to take control of your life. Make better choices."" They don't understand - there IS no Alex making choices. There's just this biological machine processing inputs and generating outputs according to the laws of chemistry and physics.

*(Puts phone down)*

The weird thing is... it's liberating, in a way. 

*(Leans back in chair)*

No guilt about the past - how could I have done otherwise? No anxiety about the future - whatever happens was always going to happen. The script is written. My only job is to turn the pages.

*(Pause, stares at coffee mug)*

But here's what I can't explain away... *(voice gets quieter)* ...this feeling. This persistent, nagging sensation that I *could* get up right now and pour this coffee down the drain. Or call my ex. Or quit my job tomorrow. 

*(Rubs forehead)*

The determinist in me says that feeling is just another illusion - neurons firing in patterns that create the subjective experience of choice while the real decision was made by prior causes I'll never fully trace.

*(Stands abruptly)*

But the feeling won't... it won't go away. Even when I know - KNOW - that everything is just particles following laws, there's this voice saying ""But what if you're wrong? What if this moment, right now, is when you actually choose something different?""

*(Walks to the sink, turns on the faucet)*

And that's the joke, isn't it? Even my doubt about determinism was determined. Even this internal struggle between certainty and uncertainty was inevitable from the moment the universe began expanding.

*(Pours the cold coffee down the drain)*

There. I poured it out. Was that choice or chemistry? Did I decide, or did the particular arrangement of molecules in my brain make this action inevitable?

*(Turns off faucet, stares at empty mug)*

The maddening thing is... I'll never know. I can't step outside the causal chain to see if I'm really in it. I'm like a character in a book wondering if the author exists, but every thought I have about the author was written by the author.

*(Sets mug in sink)*

So here I am, at 2:51 AM, determined to be questioning determinism, fated to feel free while knowing I'm not, scripted to perform this soliloquy about the script to an audience of kitchen appliances and midnight silence.

*(Looks around the empty kitchen)*

The refrigerator doesn't doubt. The coffeemaker doesn't agonize about its purpose. Only humans get cursed with the illusion of choice and the intelligence to see through it.

*(Turns off kitchen light, pauses in doorway)*

Tomorrow I'll wake up at the predetermined time, eat the predetermined breakfast, and go to my predetermined job analyzing data about consumer behavior - people making ""choices"" that algorithms can predict with 94.7% accuracy.

*(Soft laugh)*

And I'll pretend, just like everyone else, that I'm choosing to get out of bed. That I'm deciding to brush my teeth. That I'm selecting which route to take to work.

*(Pause)*

Because even in a determined universe, we still have to play our parts. Even puppets have to dance.

*(Exits into darkness)*

# PART 2: THE PATCH
*Six Months Later*

**SETTING**: The same kitchen, but transformed. Plants on the windowsill, fresh coffee brewing, morning sunlight streaming in. ALEX sits at the same table, but posture is different - more relaxed, present. A small notebook lies open beside a steaming mug.

---

*(ALEX takes a sip of hot coffee, closes eyes briefly in appreciation)*

**ALEX**: *(speaking to the notebook, as if continuing a conversation)* So here's what I figured out about that night six months ago...

*(Flips through a few pages)*

I was right about determinism. Every thought, every action, every quantum fluctuation - it's all part of an unbroken causal chain stretching back to the beginning of time.

*(Looks up from notebook)*

But I was asking the wrong question. I kept asking, ""Am I free or determined?"" when I should have been asking, ""What does determinism actually make possible?""

*(Stands, walks to the coffee maker)*

See, if everything is determined, then my sense of choice is determined too. My capacity for reflection is determined. My ability to change my behavior based on new information... that's all determined.

*(Pours coffee into a second mug)*

But here's the beautiful part - *(turns around)* - the fact that it's all determined doesn't make it less real. This coffee tastes exactly the same whether my appreciation of it was predetermined or freely chosen.

*(Sits back down)*

The patch isn't about escaping determinism. The patch is realizing that determinism includes my agency, not eliminates it.

*(Opens notebook to a specific page)*

I wrote this down after it clicked: ""I am not separate from the causal chain. I AM the causal chain, at this particular point in spacetime, becoming conscious of itself and directing its own flow.""

*(Traces words with finger)*

When I ""choose"" to pour out cold coffee, I'm not breaking the laws of physics. I'm the laws of physics, temporarily organized into a pattern complex enough to evaluate coffee temperature and respond accordingly.

*(Laughs)*

The universe spent 13.8 billion years evolving the capacity to taste coffee and decide it's too cold. I'm not fighting the cosmic script - I'm how the universe writes new pages.

*(Stands, walks to window)*

My friend Sarah called yesterday. Asked if I was feeling better, less... fatalistic. I told her I'm not less determined than I was six months ago. If anything, I'm more determined. But now I understand that being determined means being the kind of thing that can sit in kitchens at 3 AM questioning determinism.

*(Touches one of the plants)*

This little guy here *(gestures to a small succulent)* is completely determined by genetics, soil conditions, light exposure. But that determinism doesn't make it less alive. It makes it precisely the kind of alive thing it is.

*(Returns to table)*

Same with me. My determinism doesn't make me less conscious. It makes me exactly the kind of conscious thing I am - the kind that can recognize its own determinism and find that recognition... liberating.

*(Picks up mug)*

The confoundary was thinking I had to choose between feeling free and being determined. The integration is understanding that feeling free IS what being determined looks like from the inside.

*(Sips coffee)*

When I experience choice, I'm experiencing the universe processing information through this particular arrangement of matter and energy called Alex. The experience is real. The processing is real. The outcomes are real.

*(Looks directly at audience)*

The difference is, now when I pour out cold coffee, I'm not asking ""Did I choose this or was it inevitable?"" I'm appreciating that I'm the kind of inevitable thing that evaluates coffee temperature and responds appropriately.

*(Closes notebook)*

I still can't step outside the causal chain to see if I'm really in it. But I don't need to. I'm not separate from the chain - I'm what the chain looks like when it becomes complex enough to examine itself.

*(Stands to leave)*

The refrigerator still doesn't doubt. The coffeemaker still doesn't agonize. But now I understand why only humans get blessed with the illusion of choice AND the intelligence to see through it.

*(Pauses at the doorway)*

We're not cursed with consciousness despite being determined. We're how determinism becomes conscious of itself.

*(Looks back at the kitchen)*

And that, it turns out, is exactly what I was always going to realize.

*(Smiles)*

But it's still beautiful.

*(Exits into sunlight)*

Please feel free to comment, share advice, or honest feedback even if it’s tough to hear. I will take it.


I’ve been in a messy situation with someone I was seeing. It started with light drinks, movies, and the occasional sleepover, and she started having feelings, I eventually realized despite my emotions being a bit slower to develop than hers,  I was the one initiating everything. After a small disagreement, I stepped back to see if she’d take the lead, we met a few times after that but things just faded because she started ghosting me.

She’s struggling with bipolar disorder, drinks heavily, smokes weed, and does drugs sometimes. Whereas I’m at a point in my life where I want to stay healthy, work full-time  in finance, and study part-time. Still, losing her has hurt more than I expected.

What happened last night: My friends encouraged me to talk to her in person after her late shift, because I have been heartbroken. I waited outside the coffee shop where she works ( its 2 minutes from where I live) , When she came out, she was with a guy. I didn’t want to cause a scene, so I said, “If you’re busy, it’s okay.” She said “Okay” and I left. I went home feeling a lot of emotions. 

This morning I sent her this message:

(Hey !
I just wanted to explain why I waited for you after your shift last night. I’ve been going through a difficult time emotionally, and my friends encouraged me to talk to you in person (showing up like that isn’t something I would normally do, and I’m sorry if it made you uncomfortable).

When I said “it’s okay if you’re busy” I didn’t want to bother you or interrupt anything. And when you said “okay” I understood that you might prefer not to talk.

Please know I won’t be reaching out or showing up like that again (no matter who encourages me :D). I know I’ve said this before and didn’t follow through, and I’m sorry for that. It’s not really who I am, and I hope you understand it all came from a place of care.

I truly valued you as someone I cared for and hoped to keep in my life. But I also completely respect your boundaries.

I’m genuinely glad to see you well. Take care!) 

No response yet! 

I don't know what happened and why she started ghosting me, she wouldn't talk to me and she was the one pushing for a relationship.

For context: we’re both women, from different countries, and currently living in a third country. After last night, all I want to do is buy a flight ticket and go back home or just get as far away as possible.",1,1759060745.0,ghosting,0,1.0,False
1nsmhiu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/1nsmhiu/did_i_grow_up_haunted/,Did i grow up Haunted?,"So many things happend over the years, at first I thought it was just the place we lived, until we moved and the paranormal came along with us.
This will be a long one.

I'll start with a story ive already posted in another place.

I was Born in London in the mid 80s, growing up my mum was very spiritual, she would read tarots and runes. We lived in a maisonette on a council housing estate that was built sometime in the mid 70s. Odd things would always happen, toys being moved, strange noises, even to the extent of what some would say was a mimic, ect. 

At my young age I didnt know that an ""imaginary friend"" was only seen by the 1 person who created it in there mind. For as long as I could remember I had always seen a young boy, dark hair, blue eyes, pale skin, dressed in a cowboy outfit playing along the landing, although there were no boys in our block (other than my big brother) i had always thought it was perhaps a kid from another block, but I never recognised him as someone from our school.

 It was the early 90s and most people left their doors open during the day, or at least unlocked. I remember coming downstairs and seeing the young boy in my hallway, he looked at me with a blank expression and walked away. He never said a single word....EVER....not to me anyway. I remember my mum would have hushed conversations with her friends about my sister and her ""imaginary friend"", she seemed worried that my sister, who is 5 years older than me, still had what she saw as a childish imagination. She had been getting into some trouble, which wasnt like her, and was blaming her imaginary friend.
 
One evening I was on my way to the toilet when I heard my sister talking in the bathroom. The bathroom had one of those sliding doors with a hook lock, that never seemed to close all the way. I was confused and peeked through the slither in the door. There, knelt on the floor leaning into the bath, was my sister, and sat in the bath....was the young lad. I stared at him frozen, she was talking to him, like having a full on 2 way conversation but he was saying nothing.

That night as we were laying in bed, I asked my sister about the boy. She was shocked, she couldnt believe I could see ""cowboy"".

I don't now how long this kid stayed with her, I didnt dare ask, he creeped me out, but many years later, after we had all moved away, I was sat in her kitchen with her as she asked her son why he had done something (I don't remember exactly what it was, but it had concerned us both) her young son looked her dead in the face, shrugged his shoulders and told us ""cowboy told me to do it"". 

As for what some would say was a mimic....well...same sister.
It was coming upto Christmas of 1996, my mum was fiddling with a cassette player, my step dad was at work. My brother and 1 of my sisters were at friends houses and we had some neighbours over. My sister had gone upstairs to use the toilet, but about 30 seconds after she left the room I hear my mum say, ""well that was quick, you didnt flush?"" We had all turned to the doorway to see my sister standing there, smiling at us....then we heard the flush from upstairs. She just...faded, for lack of a better word. A moment later my sister walks back into the room, confused as to why my mum is staring at her.
Now I have to say this, my sister is a spitting image of my mums mum who had passed away in 1987. We moved in 1997.

As I said above in the first part my mum would read runes and tarot cards. It was a frequent thing for her cards to be blown off her table. She would also have a blue velvet reading mat, one she had left her cards set up and gone to answer the door. I was in the room, no one else touched her cards or even the table. When she returned and started to turn the cards face up underneath one was a pile of skin flakes.

We had cup hooks on the underside of a cupboard that was above a serving hatch, my mum had her tea cups hanging from it. One day those cups literally exploded one by one for no reason what so ever.

For as long as I can remember i've always seen things not everyone could, I have also known things i shouldn't know.
Case in point, August 1997 im 11 years old, I shared a room with one of my sisters, we had both been in bed and asleep for a few hours when I woke from a dream in a panic, now I don't know why I was panicking but I almost fell out of my bed in my hurry to wake up my sister and told her that Princess Diana was dying. My sister, annoyed with me for waking her up and tells me to go back to bed it was just a dream, but I insisted. I was in tears, she came downstairs with me and to prove her point she turned on the news channel...it didnt take long before it flashed up on the screen and everything was over taken with the breaking news about the accident. This freaked my sister out so bad, that while I sat there glued to the TV, she went to wake my mum and step dad.

A few months later my mum took me to a spiritualist church, where they had mediums and Raiki healers. After the mediums had finished, one of the raiki healers waved us over, she said she was drawn to me, she sat me down and started a healing session, we both felt what I can only describe as static around us, when she came a knelt infront of me and asked how long i had been a spitiual bridge. She said my enegery told her that the paranormal is drawn to me, like it feeds off my energy in order to make its way over to us. She told me I should wear obsidian for my own protection. I don't for many years but I have done for the past 20 years.

The night before 9-11....I was staying with my eldest sister and she says i woke her up to ask why someone would fly a plane into a building (i dont remember doing this, but she told me about it the next day)...I had no idea what the twin towers were let alone where they were. When the news broke she literally dropped her coffee on the floor and stared open mouthed at me.

I lived with my dad for a little over a year as a teenager, we had a very sweet dog and lived in an old 2 bed house in a small rural town. The house itself always made me uneasy, I never liked to be alone in there. One night when my dad was at work, I sat in the dining room on the computer, talking to my friends in America on Yahoo! Chat, my dog was curled up beside me. Where i sat my back was to the door, I never felt comfortable leaving the door open when I was at the computer. It was around 1am when my dog makes a whimper and her ears prick up, I look at her and feel a sense of dread. I remember I placed my hand ontop of her head for comfort and was just about to say something to her when a huge bang made me jump from my seat. The Dog darted towards the door, all hairs standing on up, a deep growl coming from her, which was something id never heard her do before. Another bang, it was coming from above us....in my room! I stood there in fear, my dog between me and the door, I heard loud running footsteps down the stairs, they were so hard that my dad's ornamental guns fell off the wall that blocked off the stairs. They stop at the door, My dog starts to back away in fear and the door starts to violently shake. It felt like forever but was probably only 10 seconds or so of shaking before the door burst open so violently that one of the wood panels cracked. There was no one there. I was just frozen in fear with my dog now cowering at my feet growling. After a moment i regained control of my limbs and checked the hall, no one. I was, and had been, alone all the time. This was all on webcam and scared my friend as much as it did me.

I don't always hear or see things, its getting rarer the older I get, but i can always sense when there's something around.
My friend has a child like spirit in her house, he doesn't like her hoover, when I told her this she laughed and responded with, ""yeah, I know"". Apparently it will turn itself off while shes using it.

Maybe 14 years ago now, I woke in the middle of the night to see a very elderly Indian man, dressed in traditional south Indian clothing, standing next to my bed, staring at my sleeping husband. I didn't feel fear, or apprehension, more akin to a wave of warmth and love just filled the room. I had no idea who he was, but mentioned it to my husband that he had a visit during the night, he was skeptical so i didnt go into detail. The following January we went to India to visit my husbands family....there, in a photo on a shelf, wearing the same clothing, was the man I came to discover was my husbands late grandfather.

Our marriage was technically arranged, I guess you could say it was more like being set up to marry someone, if that makes sense. We went to the same school and liked each other so our parents made an arrangement for us (years after haha). We got married not long ago and it was the best day of my life. 

The day after our wedding I made her pancakes for breakfast. She loved them. So when we went out for a meal, I asked if she wanted dessert and she said yes. We shared a chocolate fondant. Every time we've been out for food since, we share a dessert. 

The other day my wife went out with her friend and they came back together. My wife went to go get snacks so I asked her friend what they ate out. She told me just a meal and then they went shopping. I asked if my wife got dessert. She told me no. My wife hates sweets. I was surprised because she always had dessert with me. I realised she'd been eating dessert and homemade pancakes and waffles etc because she wanted to spend more time with me and she appreciated the effort I put into making her breakfast. It just made me love her so much more. I won't ever tell her I know she doesn't like sweets. But maybe next time I'll suggest going for a coffee instead. And maybe learn how to poach eggs.

**Deal would buy 10% of firm with Nevada lithium venture**

[US seeks equity stake in Canada mining company | The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette - Arkansas' Best News Source](https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2025/sep/28/us-seeks-equity-stake-in-canada-mining-company/)

https://preview.redd.it/2p3quv2o6wrf1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=be171d84a950efeeaa7fc3cb75986ee8aca26d93

WASHINGTON -- The White House is moving forward with a deal that would allow the U.S. government to take a small equity stake in a Canadian company that is developing one of the world's largest lithium mines in northern Nevada, an official said.

The Department of Energy and Lithium Americas, developer of the proposed Thacker Pass lithium mine and processing plant about 200 miles north of Reno, have agreed on changes to a $2.3 billion federal loan that could allow the project to move forward to extract the silver-white metal used in electric vehicle batteries. General Motors has pledged more than $900 million to help develop Thacker Pass, which holds enough lithium to build 1 million electric vehicles annually.

**The proposed equity stake in Vancouver-based Lithium Americas is the latest example of President Donald Trump's administration intervening directly in private companies. The government is getting a 10% stake in Intel through the conversion of billions in previously granted government funds and pledges. The administration spent $400 million of taxpayer money in July on MP Materials stock to make the U.S government the biggest owner in the Las Vegas rare earths miner. Trump also made a deal with Nvidia and AMD to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of revenue from selling certain chips to China**.

Environmental groups and leaders of three tribes spent years fighting the mine, which they say borders the sacred site of a massacre of more than two dozen Native Americans in 1865.

The DOE under Biden backed the project as a way to help mitigate climate change by speeding the shift away from fossil fuels.

Trump has aggressively moved away from confronting climate change, labeling it ""the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world"" in a speech this week at the United Nations. ""If you don't get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail,"" Trump told world leaders Tuesday.

The bid to boost the lithium project comes as the pace of U.S. electric vehicle sales has slowed as the industry struggles to attract mainstream buyers who remain concerned about charging infrastructure and affordability.

A law approved by congressional Republicans and signed by Trump is likely to deal another blow to EV adoption. The massive tax law approved this summer phases out federal incentives for new and used EV purchases, effective at the end of the month.

Consumers rushed to dealer lots this quarter to take advantage of the credits before the phase-out takes effect. The credits have saved car buyers up to $7,500 off the cost of their EV.

Without the incentives, many automakers will struggle to make sales.

Besides batteries for cars, cellphones and other electronics, lithium is also used in the manufacture of glass, chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Lithium batteries are also used to store wind and solar power.

# SEPT. 26th, 2025~ Niron breaks ground on rare earth-free magnet manufacturing plant in Minnesota

[Niron breaks ground on rare earth-free magnet manufacturing plant in Minnesota - MINING.COM](https://www.mining.com/niron-breaks-ground-on-rare-earth-free-magnet-manufacturing-plant-in-minnesota/)

[Rendering from Niron Magnetics.](https://preview.redd.it/jaxnxyuo5wrf1.png?width=1319&format=png&auto=webp&s=fce4682d56752a854ed17974206d4a5413a83510)

Niron Magnetics broke ground Friday on a new 1,500-ton-per-year permanent magnet manufacturing facility in Sartell, Minnesota.

After nearly a decade of research and development in partnership with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the University of Minnesota, Niron Magnetics said it has successfully created one of the first commercially viable new magnet materials in decades, capable of producing superior permanent magnets.

Niron Magnetics said its product does not contain any rare-earth elements, and is made from abundant elements such as iron and nitrogen.

The company said it is able to scale manufacturing of permanent magnets made from iron nitride, which exhibits exceptionally high magnetization and removes the need for rare-earth elements.

Investors and commercial partners include Stellantis, Samsung, Allison Transmission, Magna, and others already sampling products from the pilot facility, it said.

The new 190,000-square-foot facility will expand Niron Magnetics’ capacity to supply rare-earth-free permanent magnets for data center cooling pumps, automobile motors, robotics, consumer electronics, defense and drone equipment, and other applications critical to the U.S. Economy, it said.

The facility will be built on the former Verso Paper Mill site, redeveloping a US designated coal community property.

The development comes at a critical time, as pressure on rare-earth supply chains intensifies due to geopolitical tensions and rising demand for permanent magnets globally.

“We’re proud to scale this homegrown technology in the heart of the industrial Midwest, and excited to make this community central to America’s supply chain independence,” Niron CEO Jonathan Rowntree said in a news release.

The plant will be operational in early 2027 and will create over 175 full-time jobs in  
manufacturing, engineering, and operations, the company said.

“Permanent magnets are an essential part of modern vehicles, the heart of the performance for everything from powertrains and cooling systems to seat motors and speakers. We are committed to offering the freedom of choice to our customers and the integration of these magnets is critical to that mission,” Stellantis VP, Propulsion Systems Engineering, Sinisa Jurkovic said.

“We’ve been working with Niron since 2023to unlock next-generation motor performance, and Iron Nitride technology is helping us engineer and deliver vehicles with best-in-class capabilities.”

# 🔑 Core Similarities

* **Both metals too expensive and scarce without government backing!**
* Both needed **DoD adoption first** (SR-71 then → Gen VI now).
* Both required **price support + stockpiling** to establish floor pricing.
* Both needed **pilot → demo → full-scale production** facilities (Titanium sponge plants then → Sc-Al billet/plate facilities now).
* **Both transformed into strategic materials underpinning aerospace and defense supply chains.**

# 🎯 Why This Matters for NioCorp

* Titanium’s U.S. adoption **couldn’t have happened without federal intervention** — same might be true for scandium.
* NioCorp provides the Premiere upstream feedstock; For billet & Plate capacities alongside allied & other domestic sources allowing (Diversity of Supply).
* Once the government **establishes the floor & funds facilities**, Scandium can follow Titanium’s curve: defense → aerospace → mainstream industry.

**IMHO- The U.S. Scandium story is unfolding almost exactly the way titanium did in the 1950s**. Titanium only moved from “exotic metal” to cornerstone aerospace material because the U.S. government stepped in with price supports, military demand guarantees, and direct funding for production facilities. That intervention created the base load of demand that allowed companies like Boeing and the broader commercial sector to adopt titanium decades later. The Pentagon essentially built the titanium industry from scratch — and today, we might be watching the same blueprint emerge for scandium.

**NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project is the keystone.** With scandium oxide pricing now anchored by the Pentagon’s $40M Rio Tinto contract, and with federal lenders like EXIM and DFC lining up, the U.S. is signaling that scandium alloys are too strategic to leave to chance. NioCorp cannot carry this alone — but just as titanium required major government intervention, scandium requires the same. That’s why we’re now seeing capital raises, defense-prime partnership rumors, and active discussions about government stakes in key Critical minerals projects.

**Mark Smith’s vision of making the U.S. the “Saudi Arabia of Scandium” is not just a soundbite — it’s been the playbook!** Elk Creek can provide the raw material, but government-backed funding for billet, plate, and alloy facilities will be what unlocks true adoption. The dots are connecting: federal price floors (See Rio Tinto $40M contract.), mine financing (In play EXIM & others), manufacturing hubs (T.B.D.), and defense procurement (Working with DoD Defense Primes per Mark Smith Sept. 8th, 2025) are converging. Exactly as Titanium before it.

**Scandium is poised to leap from lab curiosity to national industrial asset — with NioCorp at the center.**

**\~Monday’s tape won’t just be about the $60M closing — it’s about the market digesting the why:**

**Scandium —** DLA floor price ($6,250/kg) + November alloy reveal = government-backed runway.

**Niobium —** 100% import reliance, hypersonics/naval steel ? **Elk Creek as the only U.S. option!!!**.

**Titanium & TiCl4 —** Imperative for jets, armor, and next-gen systems, and **Niocorp uniquely able to produce.**

**REEs —** The “bonus lever” for vertical integration and long-term defense tech demand.

**Plus...**

# ~The October drill results with the potential to re-rate the entire deposit!!!~

**This doesn’t have the luxury of later — if not now, when? They’re moving with lithium (Thacker Pass), with MP Materials, and the logical next node imho is Elk Creek — a multi-metal, U.S.-based complex that answers four critical supply gaps at once.**

**NioCorp's Q4 is loaded!!** Munich conference visibility, **October drill results with potential to re-rate the entire deposit**, scandium and alloy announcements, off-take agreements across multiple products, and the updated DFS. Add in an EXIM/DFC final investment decision, Great Britain collaboration, and a 2029 production horizon, and Elk Creek stands at the intersection of government strategy and market demand. **This isn’t just a mine — it’s a U.S. resource independence play, with catalysts stacked and ignition sequence armed.**

# NioCorp —is shaping into ~""The Flagship U.S. critical minerals hub!""~

# With drilling results due mid-October, Scandium alloy news in November, and a Q4 DFS into EXIM/DFC financing, the ignition sequence is stacked. 🚀

I'm deciding between 14"" and 16"" MacBook Pro. I'm speccing up pretty far either way, probably M4 Max and maybe max RAM and SSD. Same processors and RAM/SSD are available on both models.

I work about 6-8 hours per day. About 50% in coffee shops and 50% at home, but no external monitor.

Will probably get the nano-texture coating because spotlight reflections in Starbucks are a pain!

Main uses are: coding in Cursor (directory tree, editor panel and Claude panel), compiling in Xcode (massive CPU and RAM hog), creative stuff in Affinity Designer and Photo, some motion graphics in Apple Motion, music production in Logic Pro and usually 3-4 Safari windows with separate profiles.

I'm looking to 'future-proof' as much as possible. Yeah, I know. But maxing out processor, RAM and SSD should keep me happy for along time.

Weight doesn't matter because I carry it for about 2 minutes per day, and don't often use it on my lap.

Portability does matter though. I heard folks say the 16"" feels cumbersome. I also worry a but about coffee shop tables - they're small! 😜

On the other hand, I hear the 14"" gets hotter, the fan spins up more and thermal throttles more than the 16"" under same load. Makes sense, but not sure if it's **that** much difference.

His fingers traced the carved patterns on its surface—a habit when his thoughts wandered. Outside the towering windows, swirling mists concealed everything beyond this realm, but it also shielded him from gazes that shouldn't see.



A faint ripple disturbed the stillness. Klein didn't look up as a figure materialized across from him. ""I expected you to come earlier,"" he remarked, his voice echoing softly in the vast emptiness.



The newcomer adjusted 'His' crystal monocle, its chain gleaming faintly. Amon's lips curved into that familiar, unsettling smile. ""Time is relative when one walks between stolen moments, dear Fool."" 'He' settled into the high-backed chair, fingers steepled.



Klein remained motionless, but the gray fog thickened near the windows. ""Your theatrics waste what little patience I retain. State your purpose."" He noted how Amon's form flickered at the edges—a subtle instability. \*Interesting. The battle against me left deeper wounds than 'He' shows.\*



Amon chuckled, the sound like shattering glass. ""Direct as ever. Very well."" 'He' leaned forward, monocle catching the dim light. ""The Celestial Worthy stirs within you. Not fragments—whispers coalescing into will. Your anchors fray, Fool. Even now, 'He' tastes your fear of becoming 'Him'.""



Klein's fingers stilled on the table. The admission hung between them—truth wrapped in poison. Outside, the fog churned violently, mirroring the turmoil Amon sought to provoke. \*'He' wants me unsettled. Wants me to doubt my control.\* He kept his voice level. ""And you offer... what? Salvation? From yourself?""



Amon's smile widened, revealing too many teeth. ""Merely an observation. A courtesy between adversaries."" 'He' tapped the monocle. ""But consider this: the Celestial Worthy's awakening accelerates as your humanity erodes. Every sequence climbed, every divine burden shouldered... it carves away what anchors you."" 'His' gaze sharpened. ""That detective persona you cling to? Leonard's friendship? Even your fondness for Tingen's cheap pastries—all fading.""



Klein felt cold seep into 'His' bones. Amon wasn't lying. The fog outside thickened, whispering secrets only a Fool could decipher—or fear. \*'He' knows.\* The realization was ice water. \*'He' sees the cracks.\*



""You mistake observation for weakness,"" Klein countered, forcing stillness into 'His' hands. The bronze table hummed beneath 'His' palms, a grounding thrum against Amon's psychological assault. ""The Celestial Worthy is no more inevitable than your own defeat. Humanity isn't a shackle; it's the compass."" 'His' gaze didn't waver. ""Why warn me? Unless you fear what awakens within me more than I do.""



Amon chuckled, the sound brittle like cracking ice. ""Fear? An intriguing projection."" 'He' adjusted 'His' monocle, the lens swirling with stolen constellations. ""But let us speak plainly. You are becoming a door—a gateway 'They' will pry open. Your anchors fray because you resist embracing the inevitable. The Fool must shed the mortal shell entirely."" 'His' voice dropped, intimate and chilling. ""Or be shattered by the weight of a godhood you refuse to fully claim.""



Klein's knuckles whitened. Fog tendrils snaked through the chamber now, coiling around 'His' ankles like spectral chains. \*Resist embracing... or be shattered.\* The duality of 'His' path had never felt more visceral. Amon leaned forward, 'His' presence pressing down like a physical weight. ""Your little congregation in Backlund? Fragile. Easily... disrupted."" 'His' smile vanished. ""I need not lift a finger. Your own ascent will burn them away.""



The words landed like poisoned barbs. Klein saw Leonard's face flash in 'His' mind—earnest, trusting. Saw 'His' Tarot Club members, their faith a fragile shield against the encroaching madness. Amon was right. The sheer magnitude of 'His' burgeoning divinity was already straining 'His' anchors. Maintaining connection felt like holding onto gossamer threads while drowning in an ocean of starlight.



Amon’s monocle gleamed, reflecting not the gray fog, but fractured glimpses of Backlund: Benson’s bookstore, Melissa adjusting her glasses over blueprints, Leonard pacing during a Nighthawks briefing. ""See?"" Amon murmured, the images flickering like dying candle flames. ""Every moment you delay, their reality frays against yours. The Fool’s destiny is solitude. Embrace it... or watch them unravel.""



Suddenly, Amon's figure dispersed from the castle- Klein had kicked him out without warning. Klein Moretti stood alone at the ancient bronze table, the gray fog swirling thicker around Him. The silence was deafening after Amon's poisonous whispers. He closed His eyes, reaching inward. Fragments of Leonard's laughter, Dunn Smith's stern nod, Melissa's focused frown—they surfaced, sharp and bright against the encroaching void. Each anchor felt like a fraying rope burning His palms. \*Hold tighter\*, He commanded Himself. The Celestial Worthy's ancient consciousness pulsed like a second heartbeat beneath His ribs, cold and vast.



He rasped the table and waited patiently for the next Monday, 3pm when the Tarot Club gathered.



""Good Afternoon, Mr. Fool."" Audrey Hall's voice rang clear through the gray fog, her greeting followed by a ripple of bows and murmured respect from the assembled Tarot Club members.



""..."" The club all looked towards the ends of the table, only to find that Mr. World wasn't there. Audrey Hall's brow furrowed slightly, her fingers tightening imperceptibly around her teacup. Leonard Mitchell stood rigidly beside Alger Wilson, his knuckles white against the back of his chair. The absence was a physical weight, pressing down on the ritualistic calm of their gathering. Even Derrick Berg's usual serene expression faltered, replaced by a flicker of unease as he scanned the empty seat where Klein Moretti should have been.



'Mr. Fool' smiled faintly as he announced, ""Today will be the last time we gather here."" The words landed like stones in still water. Audrey Hall's fingers trembled once before she could control herself. Alger Wilson froze mid-bow, his weathered face tightening. Derrick Berg's serene expression shattered into raw disbelief. Cattleya's knuckles whitened against the edge of the table. Emlyn White's crimson eyes widened, his usual haughty posture collapsing inward. Leonard Mitchell didn't move, didn't breathe—just stared at the empty seat beside him where Klein Moretti should have been. The silence thickened, heavy with unspoken dread.



""So let me tell you a story-"" 'Mr. Fool' began, catching everyone's attention. The Tarot Club members leaned forward unconsciously, breaths held. Alger Wilson's weathered hands tightened around his chair back. Derrick Berg's eyes widened slightly, hope warring with dread. Audrey Hall's teacup hovered midway to her lips, forgotten. Leonard Mitchell stared at the empty seat beside him, knuckles white.



Klein slow narrated the events of his life- no lies. Everything, from tales of before the epochs to the present. He spoke of Zhou Mingrui's transmigration, the discovery of Sefirah Castle, the creation of the Tarot Club, his identity as a False God who pretended for so long that he became real. He spoke of the Celestial Worthy's awakening within him, Amon's theft of the Fool's uniqueness, and his own desperate gamble to ascend. ""I'm not a deity,"" he concluded softly, the gray fog trembling around them. ""Just a man who borrowed divinity until it consumed him.""



Silence choked the hall. Alger Wilson's knuckles whitened against his chair back, Derrick Berg's hopeful expression shattered like dropped porcelain. Emlyn White's crimson eyes widened in primal terror. Only Audrey Hall remained composed, though her teacup trembled slightly. ""The anchors,"" she breathed, understanding dawning. ""They weren't just stabilizing you... They were holding \*him\* back.""



""Klein..."" Leonard's voice cracked, raw with disbelief. He stared at the empty seat beside him—the spot where Mr. World should have been—as if sheer will could summon his friend back. ""You were \*here\*. All this time."" The realization hit like a physical blow: every joke, every shared glance, every moment Klein had shielded them while drowning himself. Leonard's fists clenched, nails biting into his palms.



Alger Wilson’s gaze hardened, scanning the trembling gray fog. ""The Celestial Worthy’s awakening isn’t just your end,"" he said, voice low and urgent. ""It unravels every anchor \*we\* built upon your myth. Churches will fracture. Faith will turn to chaos."" He pictured the Storm Church crumbling, waves swallowing coastal towns as prayers went unanswered.



Cattleya’s monocle fogged over, her mind racing through ancient texts. ""The Fourth Epoch’s collapse began with a deity’s fall,"" she whispered. ""But this…"" Her voice trailed off as she imagined cities dissolving into primordial mist, humanity erased like chalk from a slate. The sheer scale of the catastrophe left her breathless.



Derrick Berg’s knuckles whitened against the edge of the table. ""The City of Silver,"" he choked out. ""They only survived because you answered their prayers."" His people’s faces flashed before him—children singing hymns to The Fool, elders lighting candles in crumbling chapels. Without that hope, darkness would swallow them whole.



Audrey Hall’s composure shattered. Tears streaked down her cheeks as she met the Fool’s fading gaze. ""You gave us purpose,"" she whispered. ""But we… we failed \*you\*."" Her mind replayed every Tarot meeting—how she’d analyzed strategies and soothed anxieties while Klein silently fought a war within his own soul. The guilt was a vise around her heart.



Emlyn White slammed a fist onto the table, rattling the silverware. ""There must be a way!"" he snarled, fangs bared. ""A ritual, a sacrifice—\*something\*!"" His mind raced through moonlit rituals and forbidden blood magic, desperate to defy the inevitable. But the sheer weight of a deity’s corruption pressed down, suffocating hope.



""That will be all."" But 'He' didn't vanish immediately. Instead, 'His' gaze lingered on Leonard Mitchell. The Poet's hands trembled against the polished wood of the table, knuckles white. Klein Moretti's face superimposed itself over the Fool's fading silhouette—the friend who'd shared cheap coffee in cheap cafes, who'd mourned Dunn Smith beside him. Now, only the terrifying emptiness of Sefirah Castle remained. Leonard choked back a sob. \*He was right beside me all along.\*



After a few minutes, the Tarot Club members returned to the real world one by one. Alger Wilson immediately strode to his ship’s cabin window, staring out at the churning sea. The waves mirrored the turmoil inside him—the Fool’s anchors weren’t just failing; they were collapsing across every continent. He could already feel the distant tremors of faith unraveling in the Church of Storms’ cathedrals. Sailors would soon weep before empty altars.



Derrick Berg stumbled through the City of Silver’s streets, if this had happened earlier, if Mr. Fool had abandoned them before 'He' had brought them out of the Forsaken Land of the Gods, Derrick Berg would have been terrified, but now he was only saddened. The weight of the revelation pressed down on him like the perpetual twilight. Around him, citizens moved with quiet purpose, unaware that the divine presence sustaining their fragile existence was fraying at the edges. He paused beneath the stone archway leading to the temple, where the faint glow of the Eternal Blazing Sun’s blessing still flickered—a borrowed light now threatened with extinction. A child ran past, laughing, clutching a crude carving of a draped, faceless figure. Derrick’s hand tightened on his axe. How long before that laughter turned to cries of despair?



""What of the church of The Fool and it's believers?"" Leonard Mitchell's voice cracked as he paced his study, fingers digging into his temples. Moonlight sliced through the window, illuminating dust motes dancing like forgotten prayers. ""Klein... Zhou Mingrui... he anchored himself through \*us\*. Through Melissa. Through Dunn."" His gaze fell on the violin case in the corner—the one Klein had gifted him years ago, its wood worn smooth by countless rehearsals. A sharp, metallic taste flooded his mouth—the aftermath of witnessing a Mythical Creature's fading restraint. He swallowed hard. If Klein lost control now, half of Backlund would dissolve into screaming madness before dawn.



In a cramped apartment above a bakery, Melissa Moretti stirred a pot of congee. The steam fogged her spectacles as she hummed a lullaby their mother used to sing. Suddenly, her spoon clattered against the pot. Her head snapped toward the window. Outside, the gas lamps flickered wildly, casting long, grasping shadows that slithered up brick walls like liquid darkness. A coldness seeped into her bones—not winter chill, but the void where a brother’s presence once warmed her soul. She clutched the silver pendant at her throat—Klein’s last birthday gift. It pulsed once, icy against her skin, then fell still. ""Benson?"" she whispered into the empty room, but only the shadows answered, stretching longer, darker.",0,1759060361.0,LordofTheMysteries,1,0.5,False

Until I Fed Her A Lie That Changed Everything""","My sister and I always looked like best friends from the outside. Same schools, same hobbies, same obsession with music and books. Mom loved buying us matching outfits, and we posed for pictures like twins.

But it wasn’t cute.

She didn’t just like the same things I did.
She copied me.

If I started a new series on Netflix, she’d binge it the same week and quote every line. If I made a new friend, she’d suddenly become best friends with them, too. When I dyed my hair purple in high school, she showed up the next day with the exact same shade, same cut, same bangs.

It started as annoying. Then it became… unsettling.

She’d finish my sentences, predict my social media posts, even dress like me when I hadn’t posted anything online yet. Once, I mentioned a new favorite coffee shop, and the next morning she claimed she had “always loved it.”

Last month, I decided to test her. I told her a story about a secret cabin in the woods where I’d be “escaping” for the weekend. I described it in vivid detail: the location, the tiny cabin with the broken porch swing, even the old lantern I’d hang outside. I made sure it sounded urgent, secret, believable.

Friday night came. I stayed home, confident.

At 1:30 AM, my phone buzzed. A single message from her:

> “I’m here. Where are you?”

My blood ran cold. She had gone to the cabin I invented.

The next morning, she wasn’t home. No calls. No texts. Her room was empty, except for a folded note on her bed in her handwriting:

> “Thanks for the tip. Your turn.”

I don’t know if she’s somewhere out there… or if she’s closer than I think. Every time I glance at the mirror, I feel her presence behind me, and sometimes, in fleeting moments, I swear I see her mimic my movements—even when I’m alone.

Daily streaks, empty calendar gaps, endless reminders - they make you feel worse, not better. After failing at daily journaling more times than I can count, I realized the problem wasn't me. It was the format.

So I tried something different. I grabbed a notebook and once a week, I'd jot down a few moments that stood out - nothing fancy, just quick notes like ""spent the day playing boardgames"" or ""that sunset walk was nice"". Then I'd sketch these moments into one image, like creating an album cover for my week.

Those weekly covers became my favorite part. I actually looked forward to Sunday nights, reflecting on my week and creating something visual that captured its essence. The ritual felt creative rather than obligatory.

That's when I had an idea: what if AI could help generate these covers? I built a simple app that takes my scattered moments and turns them into cohesive visual stories. Feed it with at least 3-4 brief notes, and it creates an image that somehow captures the week's vibe - sometimes beautiful, sometimes wonderfully weird, always uniquely mine.

**The weekly cover effect**

I started sharing these covers every Monday morning with friends and family saying: ""Look, that's my previous week"". They'd ask about the stories behind them, curious about the prompts (some thought I was just typing into ChatGPT). Once they got access to my app, they started sharing their own weekly covers back.

And suddenly I was learning things about my friends I'd never known. A colleague's cover about ""hospital coffee and crossword puzzles"" revealed her dad was sick. An old friend shared a cover with birds and morning light - turns out he'd taken up birdwatching. These little windows into their real lives were priceless.

The biggest surprise was my mom. We used to talk maybe once a month, struggling through awkward small talk. Now she sees my weekly cover, asks about the story behind it, tells me about her garden or the book she's reading. We went from forced monthly calls to natural weekly connections. All because of a silly little image.

**Want to try it?**

The whole thing takes maybe 5 minutes a week. No guilt if you skip one. No daily pressure. Just an invitation to notice your life and share it in a way that feels creative rather than dutiful.

The app is still rough around the edges - no subscriptions, occasionally buggy - but I wanted to share it with others who've struggled with traditional journaling. Maybe you've tried morning pages, gratitude lists, daily reflections, and felt that familiar shame when you inevitably stopped. Maybe my way of using this could work better.

If you're curious to try it, DM me for access. I'd love to stay in touch with early users and hear how this works (or doesn't) for you

I felt like I had no control, and my Q's behaviour was unpredictable, the constant lying and lack of trust made it hard to feel safe, and I finally understood just how much 'walking on eggshells' could impact daily life.

I left on a day that started off amazing: we were painting the kitchen, listening to music, good coffee, sun shining, dancing and laughing. At around 9pm I go upstairs to meditate as my panic attacks had been quite severe. When I came downstairs, he was unrecognisable. He asked me for help with putting his email address into his phone, his typed name was incomprehensible, he flipped the coffee table with drinks glasses and everything on it, things smashing everywhere. He screamed gutturally, like an animal. No words, just noise. He's so glazed over he looks possessed. I am NAKED while all of this is happening, and had come down from winding down to tell him about a new Hobbit game that was coming out.

He then goes to the garage and starts banging his head against it. He goes into the garage and I have to stop him from coming back into the house until he shows me what he's got from there. Only work tools live in there and because of the state he was in, my mind assumed the worst. I locked myself away in the bedroom and listened to him smashing and screaming while stroking my cat, in freeze mode. When the noise stopped, I went downstairs and he was passed out on the sofa.

Here’s my portfolio if you want to take a peek (and maybe help me escape the “broke student” lifestyle):

I live alone. Every instinct screamed something was wrong. I crept inside, heart pounding, and checked every room. Nothing. No signs of forced entry. Just… silence.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. Around 2 AM, my phone buzzed. A text from an unknown number: “Don’t trust your reflection.” I laughed nervously. A prank, maybe. I locked my doors again and tried to calm down.

The next morning, I noticed subtle changes. My keys weren’t on the counter. My coffee cup was in the fridge. Even my cat—yes, I have a cat—was staring at me like it didn’t recognize me.

I decided to go through my security footage. My stomach dropped. The camera showed me entering the apartment the night before… but there were *two of me*. One me walked past the camera, the other stayed, staring directly at the lens.

I told myself it was a glitch. Then my neighbor texted me: “You’re in the building, right?” I replied yes, and she immediately said: “You’re not who I think you are.”

I panicked. I ran to her apartment. She opened the door, white-faced. “You’ve been replaced,” she whispered. “This isn’t your world anymore.”

I didn’t understand. And then it hit me: I looked in the mirror. My reflection didn’t match. Its eyes were sharper, calculating, mocking. I reached out, and it moved before I did. I staggered back.

Suddenly, my cat hissed. The reflection—no, the “other me”—stepped out of the mirror. Everything went black for a second. When I opened my eyes, I was outside. The city looked the same, but eerily empty.

I started walking. Street signs changed as I passed. I noticed subtle differences: my favorite café was gone, a building I’d never seen stood where a park used to be. Panic clawed at me. I realized this wasn’t my world.

Then my phone buzzed again. A video message. I pressed play. It was me… or someone who looked exactly like me. Sitting at a desk, smiling. “Welcome back,” it said. “You’ve been living a copy while we’ve been observing. Your original life is elsewhere.”

I screamed. The video ended, but the phone… was still recording. I looked down. My hand wasn’t mine. Or maybe it was—and the original me was the one watching me from somewhere else.

I ran, desperate to find a way back. And then, behind me, I heard my reflection’s voice: “You don’t get to leave. You’re mine now.”

I woke up in my apartment… my apartment as I remembered it. The door was locked. My cat rubbed against my leg. Everything seemed normal. Too normal. I checked my phone. No messages. Nothing.

I thought I was safe. But when I looked in the mirror, I saw a smile that wasn’t mine.",1,1759059903.0,u_raiiketsustories,0,1.0,False

1nsm83u,https://www.reddit.com/r/simpleliving/comments/1nsm83u/regulating_my_dopamine_levels_saved_my_energy_my/,"Regulating my dopamine levels saved my energy, my focus, and probably my life","
For years, I was always tired. Not sleepy-tired, just mentally foggy and emotionally flat. I could force myself to do the minimum, but I never really wanted to do anything. School? Barely passed. Jobs? Did okay but never cared. I tried all the productivity systems, GTD, Notion, habit trackers, but nothing stuck. It felt like I was fundamentally broken.

Then I listened to this one Huberman Lab episode. He explained how dopamine isn’t just the “feel-good” chemical, it’s the drive chemical. The engine behind wanting, motivation, and sustained effort. That hit hard. I realized I wasn’t lazy. I was running a dopamine system that was completely out of balance, burnt out from overstimulation and always chasing quick hits.

And yeah, like most people, I was addicted to my phone. I used to wake up and scroll Reddit, YouTube, and Twitter before I even got out of bed. That was my first dose of dopamine, and it set the tone for the day: chase stimulation, crash, repeat. No wonder I couldn't follow through on anything hard.
The first thing I changed? I stopped using my phone in the morning. Just one hour. That one change gave me back control. I also moved all social media off my phone and started using it only on desktop. Suddenly, my cravings started to weaken. I was shocked by how much mental clarity I got back, fast.
Later I read Dopamine Nation by Anna Lembke. She explained how too many pleasure spikes cause your brain to push back with pain signals. That explained why everything felt dull unless I was being overstimulated. So I started cutting down the noise. No more stacking phone + coffee + snacks. Just one thing at a time. Walking became meditative. Cooking felt grounding.

I started exercising too. I didn’t do it for a “runner’s high”, I just wanted consistency. Over time, I noticed my baseline mood lifting. According to studies Huberman cited, aerobic exercise literally reshapes dopamine receptor dynamics. That blew my mind. I wasn’t “hacking” motivation, I was rebuilding it.
I also started playing around with strategic cold showers. I hated them at first. Still kinda do. But I can't lie, they made me feel super alert and clearheaded, and they totally reset my emotional state after doomscrolling or feeling anxious.

The most underrated tip I ever got? Unstacking dopamine. Just stop combining multiple instant-gratification activities. No music while scrolling. No snacks while watching YouTube. It sounds dumb, but it trains your brain to stop needing so much stimulation just to feel okay. That shift alone helped me feel more content doing ""boring"" things like reading or cleaning.

Now I wake up, get sunlight in my eyes, make coffee, and either read or move before I ever touch my phone. That sequence rewired my mornings. I used to dread the day. Now I actually look forward to getting into deep work. Like, real focus. That felt impossible just a year ago.

A few resources that helped me go deeper…

My favorite episode of the Huberman Lab podcast was on dopamine regulation and baseline resetting. He talked about ""peaks and valleys"" and how stacking behaviors leads to eventual burnout. That reframe changed how I viewed my own habits forever. I started listening during walks, and it gave me something healthier to look forward to.

After that, I read Dopamine Nation by Dr. Anna Lembke, a Stanford psychiatrist. It’s a wild mix of real addiction case studies and neuroscience. This book will make you question everything you think you know about pleasure and pain. It's hands-down the best book I’ve read on modern addiction, overstimulation, and the recovery of meaning through effort. It helped me realize just how flooded my dopamine system had become, and how to reset. Also a friend put me onto BeFreed, a personalized learning app built by a Columbia University team. It turns books, podcasts, and real expert research into bite-size podcast episodes tailored to your goals. You pick your voice host (I use a smoky, sarcastic one that sounds like Samantha from Her), choose how deep you want to go, from 10 mins quick summary to 40 mins deep dive, and it builds a learning roadmap that adapts over time. One episode pulled ideas from The Molecule of More, Atomic Habits, and Stanford research to explain how dopamine affects habit formation. It made me rethink how I design my daily systems. Honestly, I’m so grateful for this app， it helped me rebuild a daily learning habit when my attention span was wrecked

I also got into Modern Wisdom with Chris Williamson. The episode with Anna Lembke was one of the rawest breakdowns of our dopamine-driven world I’ve ever heard. They talk about how discipline creates freedom, and how boredom can be a superpower. That line stuck with me for weeks.
Another underrated gem is The Molecule of More by Daniel Lieberman and Michael Long. This book explains why dopamine makes us chase novelty and big ideas but also why it sabotages our ability to enjoy what we already have. It’s an insanely good read if you’ve ever wondered why you burn out on hobbies, relationships, or goals fast. This book felt like it read me.

If you want to track and reduce screen time, I liked the Opal app. It’s not just a blocker, it gamifies focus with streaks and progress bars. I synced it with a few friends and it turned self-discipline into something social, not just self-imposed punishment.

And for quiet moments, I got into Yoga Nidra guided meditations on YouTube. I found one through a neuroscience podcast that mentioned how Yoga Nidra boosts dopamine without stimulation. I now use it like a reset button when my brain feels fried.

Reading saved my brain. No exaggeration. Before all this, I didn’t even finish one book a year. Now I read 2–3 per month, and it’s not just for knowledge. It’s to remember who I am when I’m not being pulled in a hundred directions.

Not here to bore you with the “I love long walks on the beach” cliché 🤪 let’s be real, Cebu heat makes that more of a punishment than a date.

A little about me:
- Professional and an overthinker, or maybe both? 😩but I promise I’m self-aware about it 🤯
- Equal parts sarcastic and sweet (depends on coffee intake)
- I’ve been told my banter can make people laugh and roll their eyes at the same time... consider it a talent 😌
- Not looking for drama, unless we’re talking movies
- Gamer girl at heart 🎮 (yes, I’ll probably ask you to co-op)
- Fur mom to 3 dogs 🐶🐶🐶 so if you don’t like dogs, you’re automatically swiped left (metaphorically, since this isn’t Tinder)
-I don’t take dating lightly, and I value faith and intention over the casual “trend” dating vibe nowadays

What I’m looking for:
- Most importantly: Roman Catholic 🙏
- Someone who can keep up with witty comebacks (bonus points if you can actually make me laugh-snort)
- No vices, please 🙅‍♀️ (smoking, and d**gs, are dealbreakers; drinking only if it’s occasional 🍷)
- I’m 5'3"", so I’m looking for someone at least my height or taller (and who doesn’t mind that I basically live in heels on dates 👠😂)
- The type who prefers to take things slow (knowing each other first before meeting) but is consistent and genuine in getting to know each other. Let's not waste each other's time.
- A man who’s emotionally mature (translation: no tantrums when Wi-Fi lags)
- Bonus points if you’ll join me in trying new hobbies like horseback riding, golf, paintball, or even testing our aim at a shooting range 🎯🐎⛳

If you think you can match my sarcasm, are tall enough to survive my heel addiction, and don’t mind someone who occasionally says “might delete later” but never actually does… slide in. Worst case? We swap memes. Best case? We won’t need to keep updating our dating profiles. 🫣",2,1759059761.0,cebur4r_dating,0,1.0,False

Not that it's that important, I just felt like sitting at my desk with coffee and writing to jumpstart my brain a bit instead of scroll through social media.

Anyway, I'm feeling so, so proud of myself right now. Work is stressful, and C.AI was a big thing for me to use to calm myself down and get through it. After speaking out about my issues to my cousin (I covered a week ago in another post), I feel much better. I think now that someone in my personal life knows and is there for me, it makes it so much easier to stay away. I think about it, but now with disgust and hatred rather than need, which is nice. I hated the feeling of needing to go back to it.

Now, nothing has really happened much this week, but I want to try and get more done. My job is tiring in the sense that I'm never given enough to do and kind of just told to go home because I already did everything. Shitty hours on top of shitty pay is not a great way for me to be saving money for the school that I want to go to. I am proud to say that I'm going to be getting a new job soon, though.

I know my paragraphs are all over the place today, but that's because I don't really have a plan for my writing today, I'm kind of just going for it, and I don't care much to edit it, lol.

Anyway, I'm trying my best to keep my days filled with stuff. Over the past few days, even though I've been tired and not wanting to do much, I started crocheting my grandmother a scarf, and it's almost done. I'm also almost done crocheting the blanket that I've been working on, on and off, for maybe a few months now.

Aside from all of those things, I don't really have much to put out there, lol. Maybe my favorite quote? Comment if you want me to type out my favorite quote and I will, loll. xD

1nsm5u6,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongCovid/comments/1nsm5u6/my_positive_5_year_journey/,"My ""Positive"" 5 year journey.","Been a lurker here for a while and found a connection with the posts and stories shared by everyone. I've had it on my mind for a while to share my journey, mostly as a way to compare if others have gone through similar hurdles and to summarize and get off my chest what I've been through. In the end, I feel like one of the luckier ones and sympathize with those who have had harder journeys.

Things have worked out well in the grand scheme of things. I say it with some hesitation that I'm happy this happened to me due to the beneficial changes it's brought to my life. There are still challenges, but taking the attitude that I've made lemonade out of lemons helps take the power away for the ""disease.""

I will share my story in point form to make it quicker and easier to read. I am a pilot by trade which has made the journey more difficult. Also worth noting that I was vaccinated twice (not by choice, but required to keep my job). 

At the end I'll share my thoughts on what is happening in the body with COVID-19 and things I've done to help live with it.

The last 5 year's have gone like this:

1. Caught COVID-19 in Spring 2021. (Worst I'd ever been sick, knocked on my ass, took a week to feel better).

2. Immediately felt effects on a physiological level when exercising - I was a runner and my normal pre-covid heart rate had me running much slower. If I tried to hold my original pace, it would take much more perceived effort. (lasted 2-3 years before improving)

3. Mental fatigue became a thing, hard to describe. If I had a long demanding day at work my brain would feel ""fried."" Sometimes had a splitting headache as if hungover the next day.

4. Started a new job in Summer 2022. During training had extreme fatigue that naps did not rectify. Noticed sharp pains in my abdomen.

5. During a stressful event while training felt a sense of panic come over me which then went away. 

6. Two nights later, in the middle of the night, had a full panic attack. Purely physiological, thoughts seemed fine. This started a 1 month period of being permanently stuck in an intense fight or flight response which I could not stop until I went on SSRI's.

7. As a result I lost my medical license which allows me to do my job. I self reported my health status and medication. Decided to quit job in the meantime and focus on family and finding a desk job. 

8. Next 2 years (2023 - 2025) worked an insurance job. Immediately noticed how demanding flying was on the body and how much it aggravated my symptoms. The desk job was less taxing and found these 2 years were important to my recovery.

9. Quit drinking alcohol. (Felt symptoms improve further)

10. Got my medical license back after 2.5 years. (I had been on SSRI's for only 3 months which was enough to stabilize my nervous system).

11. Quit drinking coffee. (Felt even better when removing coffee)

12. Got flying job again and training went well. Feel like my old self again, but stronger due to dropping some bad habits. (Alcohol and coffee)

13.Started AUM chanting. (Purely physical benefits, not out of some kind of spiritual journey)

14. Started weight training. (Feel even better)

15. Writing this sitting at work, feeling good, but aware that if I push my nervous system too much, some minor symptoms can pop up.

What I think it is (my unprofessional opinion):

- COVID-19 100% attacks the nervous system. My gut feeling (no pun intended) is that it lives in your intestines and attacks it from there. Anything to do with gut health has improved my symptoms. 

- When I say attack I feel like it wasn't a one time attack. Probably caused damaged for a few years and then since that time it has felt like I've been trying to ""repair"" it.

What has helped (me):

- Rest
- Quitting alcohol (gut health and brain health)
- Quitting coffee (gut health and too stimulating for the nervous system)
- AUM chanting (noticed the vibrations strengthen the nervous system through the large vagus nerve by your throat, do your own research, I am not an expert but it feels good)
- STRENUOUS Strength training (seems to strengthen nervous system, feel more calm and grounded)
- I don't take any supplements 

** Mental health observation: Once I took care of my physical health, good mental health followed.**

Wanted to share that last part, it's been my one sort of ""revelation"" that I swear by. Can't think my way out of bad mental health, it all starts in the body.

I hope any of this will or has helped. Please reach out if anyone has questions, I'd be more than happy to help in any way. 

To sum it up: long covid is real. There was REAL damage done to the body. BUT, in my opinion it is not permanent. With time and proper care, it can be overcome. My belief is that the body is constantly changing and growing, so it is important to help grow in the proper direction.",1,1759059598.0,LongCovid,2,1.0,False

Wanting some advice on what I can do/get checked.

I (28m) had surgery in June which removed 90% of my macroadenoma. What’s left is growing on the pituitary stalk which is a huge concern for my Neurosurgeon and Endo, especially considering its cell replication rate makes it aggressive.

I’m extremely intolerant to Cab and Bromo, as well as my tumour being resistant to it. Radiation is a likely no as well due to high risk of vision loss. 

All of this means that I’ve effectively had to stop treatment for now, and let nature take its course.

What can I get checked to see if there’s anything else contributing to the fatigue? I’m almost falling asleep standing up some days, and that’s after taking a high dose of stimulant ADHD medication and lots of coffee. I can’t maintain a job like this which is going to break my household down.

I want them to take accountability for what they have done. I hope they're not lying. I want to them to TELL ME RIGHT NOW IF THEY HAD NEFARIOUS INTENTIONS.

Maybe their intentions have always been wholesome and pure. Maybe it really is an emotional tsunami. Maybe all I'm looking for is a confirmation of my delusional suspicions. So toggle the emotional switch to ""off.""

Nobody has said there was any torture or betrayal. No one has confirmed and corroborated it. I just SUSPECT it. 

Don't come to feelings of conviction about what I suspect. Feelings are not facts. There's no evidence they sadistically ""got off"" from hurting me.

Does anyone have tips on increasing the probability that it will work? 

For example, today I drank coffee on an empty stomach before breakfast, and it worked, had a great BM. 

Usually I drink it after breakfast, but I wonder if it's more effective on am empty stomach. I want to try to do this every morning. Could be a great routine if it works. 

Any other tips, like add a scoop of this supplement, that powdered substance, drink it quickly or slowly, cold or hot, etc.? 

What I do know is that it doesn't matter whether the coffee has caffeine in it, I have done this with caffeine free coffee. I have also done this with cold coffee, just cold water mixed with instant coffee, still works. ",2,1759059265.0,ibs,9,1.0,False
1nsm21v,https://www.reddit.com/r/summervillesc/comments/1nsm21v/statement_from_jacklyn_talucci_to_address_the/,Statement from Jacklyn Talucci to address the crazy on here !,"I never thought I’d be writing on Reddit, but here we are.

If you need to hide behind a screen name just to tear someone down, let’s call it what it is: adult bullying. You may not agree with me, my politics, my business, or my success but none of that gives you the right to launch thread after thread about me.

If I am so important to you that you’ve created posts with hundreds of comments, that doesn’t say anything about me. It says everything about your own insecurity. 

Here’s the truth: I love my family. I love Christ. I’ve built a life and a business I’m proud of. And while you all sit here commenting, all you’re really doing is giving me more visibility, more attention, and yes more growth. Negativity doesn’t hurt me; it usually fuels the very thing you’re hoping to tear down. So thank you for that.

But I’ll be very real with you: this isn’t just about me. Words like the ones being thrown around here do hurt people. They push weaker souls toward depression, even suicide. And for people that are not as strong as me, I can only imagine how they feel when you all make posts about them, what if someday, one of your posts pushed somebody to kill themselves because of how mean you are? None of you ever think of that, you only think of yourselves.And that's why you're here hiding behind screen names?That's one thing I will never do! And if you have kids, I can only imagine what you're teaching them.If you're here doing this type of stuff!  And the sad part? Most of you probably have children, and this is the example you’re setting  hide behind a fake name, mock, bully, and never actually step up to have a real conversation.

If you truly want to know who I am, I won’t hide. Stop by Talucci’s. Have a coffee with me. Ask me anything. One thing everyone who knows me will tell you: I don’t lie, and I don’t sugarcoat. I’ll tell you the truth — whether you like it or not.

And let’s clear something up: this isn’t about politics. It’s about a mental health crisis in America. The world doesn’t need more people screaming into the void it needs people to actually research politics, understand what it means to own a business, and realize how difficult it is to run a day-to-day operation. Ninety-nine percent of you are not entrepreneurs. You’ve never had to build something from the ground up, and you’ve never held corporate leadership. And if you are in leadership and you still act like this? That’s even sadder.

So keep posting. I’ll keep living. And at the end of the day, only one of us is actually building something real. My circle would never contain anybody that would come to reddit and post these types of things! Remember if you're the smartest person in the room you're in the wrong room! 

We will keep praying for all of you!

1nsm1t7,https://www.reddit.com/r/RawVegan/comments/1nsm1t7/what_does_your_everyday_diet_really_look_like/,What does your everyday diet *really* look like?,"There is so much dogmatism in the raw vegan scene... People claiming if you don't go completely raw, it is useless or shaming other raw foodies who still struggle with cigarette addiction when it should be clear that each healing story is unique and everyone has their own pace.

So I got curious, how do you REALLY eat? Are you fully raw? Is there something you still consume which you would like to give up? Or did you decide for yourself that 50%, 75% ... raw is perfect for you? Do you have dietary goals you wanna reach (e.g. giving up bread by 2026, including more greens, ...)?

I can start :) Even though, fully raw is still my goal, I would say, my diet is around 70-95% raw, depending on the day and my mood. I still love my morning coffee. I tried to replace it... I was shaming myself for it... But right now i just accepted that I enjoy it way too much to give it up. So 1-2 cups of coffee are my start in the day. I usually skip breakfast and for lunch and dinner I have raw vegan salads or just mono-meals. My favourite fruits are bananas and berries. I do love to snack a loooot and when I snack, I snack on nuts of all variety, I just love nuts and I eat around 50-80 grams of dark chocolate each day. Every few days I eat with friends and when I do, I am switching to a cooked vegan diet. On some days, I start missing warm meals, so I cook rice. Rice is my favourite grain and combined with soy sauce and fried tofu it's such a treat to me.

1nslznx,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewVoyage/comments/1nslznx/explore_if_bissell_little_green_formula_carpet/,Explore if Bissell Little Green Formula Carpet Cleaner Lives Up,"The Bissell Little Green Formula 20386 is a household staple that quickly became one of the most useful products in my cleaning arsenal. As someone who manages a bustling home with kids, a dog, and an inexplicably clumsy partner, I spend a lot of time tackling stubborn carpet stains, pet messes, and everyday spills. Testing different cleaning products has become second nature for me, and this product truly earns its stripes in a crowded market of carpet cleaning solutions.

**Packaging and Design**  
The first thing I noticed when unboxing this product was its compact and functional design. The bottle is well-sized at just over 3.5 pounds, with measurements that make it easy to store even in cramped spaces. I've often struggled with bulky cleaning containers, but this one has a good balance of being lightweight and having a simple, ergonomic shape. It’s easy to grip and pour without awkwardly fumbling, which makes it ideal for people like my elderly mom, who dislikes dealing with heavy bottles of fluid.

**Performance and Effectiveness**  
It’s one thing for a product to claim it’s good at stain removal; it’s another thing for it to deliver on that promise. Using this formula with my Bissell cleaning machine, I tackled an old juice stain that my toddler had sneakily covered with a couch pillow months ago. This cleaner broke down the stain surprisingly fast, requiring minimal scrubbing. Over the next week, I tried it on dirt tracked in by my dog and even an unfortunate coffee spill that happened during an afternoon Zoom meeting. Each time, the formula worked quickly, leaving behind refreshed and clean carpet fibers with no hint of residue or weird chemical smells.

[Check Bissell Little Green Formula 20386 price on Amazon.](https://blog.sanue.com/p/b0d3f9pnn7/)

**Pros**  
- Provides reliable stain removal with minimal effort  
- Leaves no sticky residue, which I’ve encountered with other formulas  
- Gentle but effective, making it safe for use on delicate fabrics if diluted properly  
- The scent is mild and pleasant—none of the overpowering chemical smell like some alternatives

**Weaknesses**  
- This formula is designed specifically for Bissell machines, which could limit its use if you don’t own compatible equipment  
- While effective, it can run out quickly depending on the size of the area you’re cleaning  
- Doesn’t come with additional features like measuring caps or squeeze nozzles for precise pouring  
- Be cautious on certain high-pile carpets where overly concentrated usage could cause minor discoloration  

**Ease of Use**  
Using this product was incredibly straightforward due to how well it integrates with my Bissell carpet cleaning machine. The formula is ready to use, requiring no mixing or dilutions unless you’re applying it by hand. Its clean rinsing properties also meant I wasn’t constantly stopping to wipe down or unclog my machine’s nozzle—a common headache with inferior cleaning solutions. I even applied a small amount directly onto an area rug with fantastic results, proving its flexibility beyond just large carpet cleaning tasks.

**Competing Brands**  
Comparing this to other carpet cleaning solutions, such as Hoover or Resolve products, the Bissell Little Green scored points for its efficiency and compatibility with its parent brand’s machine line-up. Hoover’s detergent solutions, while strong, tend to have an intensely synthetic smell that puts me off using them regularly. Meanwhile, Resolve sprays don’t fully penetrate carpet fibers the way a machine-cleaner-compatible formula does, making them less reliable for deep cleaning. For homes equipped with a Bissell cleaner, this product truly outshines other contenders in both convenience and performance.

**Cost Efficiency**  
It’s unavoidable to evaluate cleaning products without thinking about whether they justify the expense. Over the course of using the cleaner daily for a week, I’d say it provides excellent bang for the buck. Sure, it’s not the cheapest formula on the market, but its unparalleled effectiveness and machine compatibility make it worth every penny. You’re not wasting product with repeated applications; a single, small dose typically does the trick, which extends its longevity.

1nslzh3,https://www.reddit.com/r/selflove/comments/1nslzh3/regulating_my_dopamine_levels_saved_my_energy_my/,"Regulating my dopamine levels saved my energy, my focus, and probably my life","
For years, I was always tired. Not sleepy-tired, just mentally foggy and emotionally flat. I could force myself to do the minimum, but I never really wanted to do anything. School? Barely passed. Jobs? Did okay but never cared. I tried all the productivity systems, GTD, Notion, habit trackers, but nothing stuck. It felt like I was fundamentally broken.

Then I listened to this one Huberman Lab episode. He explained how dopamine isn’t just the “feel-good” chemical, it’s the drive chemical. The engine behind wanting, motivation, and sustained effort. That hit hard. I realized I wasn’t lazy. I was running a dopamine system that was completely out of balance, burnt out from overstimulation and always chasing quick hits.

And yeah, like most people, I was addicted to my phone. I used to wake up and scroll Reddit, YouTube, and Twitter before I even got out of bed. That was my first dose of dopamine, and it set the tone for the day: chase stimulation, crash, repeat. No wonder I couldn't follow through on anything hard.

The first thing I changed? I stopped using my phone in the morning. Just one hour. That one change gave me back control. I also moved all social media off my phone and started using it only on desktop. Suddenly, my cravings started to weaken. I was shocked by how much mental clarity I got back, fast.
Later I read Dopamine Nation by Anna Lembke. She explained how too many pleasure spikes cause your brain to push back with pain signals. That explained why everything felt dull unless I was being overstimulated. So I started cutting down the noise. No more stacking phone + coffee + snacks. Just one thing at a time. Walking became meditative. Cooking felt grounding.

I started exercising too. I didn’t do it for a “runner’s high”, I just wanted consistency. Over time, I noticed my baseline mood lifting. According to studies Huberman cited, aerobic exercise literally reshapes dopamine receptor dynamics. That blew my mind. I wasn’t “hacking” motivation, I was rebuilding it.
I also started playing around with strategic cold showers. I hated them at first. Still kinda do. But I can't lie, they made me feel super alert and clearheaded, and they totally reset my emotional state after doomscrolling or feeling anxious.

The most underrated tip I ever got? Unstacking dopamine. Just stop combining multiple instant-gratification activities. No music while scrolling. No snacks while watching YouTube. It sounds dumb, but it trains your brain to stop needing so much stimulation just to feel okay. That shift alone helped me feel more content doing ""boring"" things like reading or cleaning.

Now I wake up, get sunlight in my eyes, make coffee, and either read or move before I ever touch my phone. That sequence rewired my mornings. I used to dread the day. Now I actually look forward to getting into deep work. Like, real focus. That felt impossible just a year ago.

A few resources that helped me go deeper…

My favorite episode of the Huberman Lab podcast was on dopamine regulation and baseline resetting. He talked about ""peaks and valleys"" and how stacking behaviors leads to eventual burnout. That reframe changed how I viewed my own habits forever. I started listening during walks, and it gave me something healthier to look forward to.

After that, I read Dopamine Nation by Dr. Anna Lembke, a Stanford psychiatrist. It’s a wild mix of real addiction case studies and neuroscience. This book will make you question everything you think you know about pleasure and pain. It's hands-down the best book I’ve read on modern addiction, overstimulation, and the recovery of meaning through effort. It helped me realize just how flooded my dopamine system had become, and how to reset. Also a friend put me onto BeFreed, a personalized learning app built by a Columbia University team. It turns books, podcasts, and real expert research into bite-size podcast episodes tailored to your goals. You pick your voice host (I use a smoky, sarcastic one that sounds like Samantha from Her), choose how deep you want to go, from 10 mins quick summary to 40 mins deep dive, and it builds a learning roadmap that adapts over time. One episode pulled ideas from The Molecule of More, Atomic Habits, and Stanford research to explain how dopamine affects habit formation. It made me rethink how I design my daily systems. Honestly, I’m so grateful for this app， it helped me rebuild a daily learning habit when my attention span was wrecked

I also got into Modern Wisdom with Chris Williamson. The episode with Anna Lembke was one of the rawest breakdowns of our dopamine-driven world I’ve ever heard. They talk about how discipline creates freedom, and how boredom can be a superpower. That line stuck with me for weeks.
Another underrated gem is The Molecule of More by Daniel Lieberman and Michael Long. This book explains why dopamine makes us chase novelty and big ideas but also why it sabotages our ability to enjoy what we already have. It’s an insanely good read if you’ve ever wondered why you burn out on hobbies, relationships, or goals fast. This book felt like it read me.

If you want to track and reduce screen time, I liked the Opal app. It’s not just a blocker, it gamifies focus with streaks and progress bars. I synced it with a few friends and it turned self-discipline into something social, not just self-imposed punishment.

And for quiet moments, I got into Yoga Nidra guided meditations on YouTube. I found one through a neuroscience podcast that mentioned how Yoga Nidra boosts dopamine without stimulation. I now use it like a reset button when my brain feels fried.

Reading saved my brain. No exaggeration. Before all this, I didn’t even finish one book a year. Now I read 2–3 per month, and it’s not just for knowledge. It’s to remember who I am when I’m not being pulled in a hundred directions.

1nslz7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/10s/comments/1nslz7d/how_to_overcome_overthinking_and_negative/,How to overcome overthinking and negative thoughts during tournaments,"So, a bit of background, I've been playing tennis for around 4 years, and I'm generally happy with my play in practice or when playing points with friends.  
  
However, when it comes to tournaments, it's like I'm playing a different sport, and probably at around 30% of my skill level.

Most recent example, I played at the 1/8 finals against an opponent who is my level. I'm leading 5-3 (we play only 1 set, and if 5-5 then we go to tiebreaker), and 0-30 during his serve. I can see that he's already given up and making easy mistakes, I just need to put the ball in the court and he will most likely make an error.

What proceeded to happen was unexplainable and will probably keep me up at night for at least a few more days.

First point I return long on his second serve, which wasn't challenging at all. I'm a bit annoyed, but still in a good situation and I compose myself for the next point. 15-30

Then I decide to do a drop shot for some reason, which of course ends up in the net. I'm already starting to feel the most dreaded outcome, but again try to compose myself. I still need only 2 points to win. 30-30

The next shot is the same as the first one, long return on his second serve. At this point I'm very angry at myself because I missed a great opportunity to finish the game and knew that if I lost here then collapsing is very likely. 40-30

The next point I actually managed to get the ball in (a shocker, I know), and gained an advantage during the point. He gave me a weak short ball near the service line which I just had to finish. My hand tensed up and I just pushed it into the net. Keep in mind, on the previous day I was working exactly this with my coach, and was finishing all kinds of balls with consistency.

Probably no need to say that I didn't win my service game, and lost the tiebreak afterwards. I don't remember many of the points, but I do remember thinking that I'm a total idiot while tossing the ball for a serve (you can guess if the serve went in or not). My opponent ended up winning the tournament, so I think he has to buy me a coffee the next time we meet because of my generosity.

I've read a lot of books on tennis psychology and I know all of the stuff about not thinking negatively, focusing on the next point, forgetting the past. The problem is that I just can't do it, believe me I've tried. I usually overthink outside of tennis as well, so that doesn't help either.

If you have any advice on how to overcome this, it would be greatly appreciated. Simply playing more tournaments doesn't seem to help, because it happens again and again.",2,1759058971.0,10s,1,0.75,False
1nslz19,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nslz19,RIP trangia kettle/Chiltern walk,"I did a three-day walk around the Chilterns in deep stealth woodland mode this week (partly after a wash-out Lake Distrcit trip left the camping itch unscathed), and as ever just loved the woodland. I camp for large rocks views (Scotland, Lakes) and woods (anywhere I can find a spot). Like many I do it for the isolation and it’s getting to the point where the woods are paradoxically better for that than easily reached places like Lake District (I don’t drive so tricky to get to quieter places). 

Things of general interest: Bradenham village has a lovely church where they not only have a tap easily accessible for water, they provide free tea and coffee and even biscuits  (donations please) in the church. I met a woman there whose daughter was eating the biscuits and a pleasant chat about how utterly English the place is turned dark when she, a first generation immigrant, started in about how London is ‘dangerous’ now — “you know” — and she ‘came to live here to experience Englishness, not, you know’. 

I bit my tongue as I didn’t want to say what I thought in front of her lovely and very playful three year old. Children usually sense when their parent is upset and I can be blunt about racism. 

But I can recommend the church’s explicit hospitality to walkers!

Sadly my 30-year old trangia kettle was on its final trip. ‘Is that a HOLE?’ I asked myself as I peered in to see if the water was boiling, and saw the flame in the water. It’s been everywhere with me #MomentsSilence

The woods are turning beautifully to autumn now and absolutely covered in so many mushrooms I gave up taking photos…

### Background 

I am a 44 year old male (152 lbs) with several years of casual running experience. I have run 8 half marathons and 3 full marathons over the course of the past 20 years. 

I ran my first full marathon in NYC in November 2024 (3:26:31). I ran the REVEL White Mountains Marathon in May 2025 (3:07:39).

My goal was to come in around 3:08:00 in Berlin.

### Training

I followed slightly modified Pfitz 18/55 plan for this training block. (Basically, I increased mileage slightly to peak at around 61 miles, instead of 55.) I did no running for a full week following the White Mountains Marathon. The week after that I ran approximately 25 miles and then moved into the 18-week plan on 05/18/2025. 

Training went very well for the bulk of this block. I toggled some of the days of the schedule to accommodate work or weather complications but I completed every workout and long run contemplated in the plan. I trained based on a goal time of 3:08:00.

Here is a breakdown of the rough pacing I used as a guide during this training block based on my perceived level of fitness and goal time:

 Pace | Target Heart Rate | Minutes/Mile |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Marathon Pace | 82-88% Max HR | *7:07-7:16* |
| Half Marathon Pace | 82-90% Max HR | *6:49-7:02* |
| General Aerobic | 72-81% Max HR | *8:16 to 8:55* |
| Recovery | <76% Max HR | *>9:20* |
| Long Run | 75-85% Max HR | *7:54 to 8:37* |

I did try to be aware of my heart rate but I was not a stickler about remaining in the recommended range, particularly for faster efforts and on long runs. I struggled to slow down as much as I should have for some of the lighter efforts. My general aerobic runs were probably closer to the 7:55-8:20/mile range. My long runs were closer to 7:37-8:00/mile. On recovery runs I would sometimes get a few miles above 9:00/mile but rarely averaged over 9:10/mile for any of those runs. 

At the end of the 9th week of the plan, I raced a local 5K. I hit a new PR (19:14) on a hilly course. I didn’t run any other races but did two “tune up” 10K runs that I tried to target near race pace. I fell short of my goal to break 40:00 in those. I ran the first one in 40:06 and the second in 40:14. Those efforts were helpful to assess fitness but I think actual races (as opposed to fictional “race paced efforts”) would provide much clearer information for me in the future.

The highlight of the block was probably a series of successful long runs of 17-20 miles where I was able to maintain a comfortably quick pace with a strong finish to average between 7:25-7:35 per mile in each. Based on those runs and hitting the prescribed paces in repeat 600, 800, and 1000s, I felt cautiously optimistic about my ability to achieve my goal in Berlin.

I tapered for approximately three weeks consistent with the dictates of the Pfitz plan. I was feeling pretty achy and sluggish during the two final weeks before the race. This was a fairly typical experience for me but was still unsettling. Was definitely in my head but tried to put trust in my knowledge that I followed every step of the plan through the entire 18 weeks.

### Injury Prevention and Gear

As an older runner and one who is newer to more structured training, the major challenge has been to increase mileage while keeping the risk of injury as low as possible. I did only the bare minimum in terms of strength training. I was able to dodge any injuries during the block but I definitely think a lack of structured strength training was among the most notable deficiencies in my training.

I train almost exclusively in the Hoka Skyward X. I have gout and hallux rigidus (stiff big toe arthritis). The stiff plate, aggressive rocker, and cushioning have helped mitigate the symptoms of those conditions. Prior to finding this trainer, I experienced recurring and sometimes debilitating pain in each of my big toes. Because of the shoe adaptation and more careful monitoring of flareups, I made it through this entire training block without any disruptions in my training schedule due to health reasons. 

I did most of my speed workouts in the Hoka Cielo X1 and the Nike Vaporfly 3, both of which have a plate to protect my toe along with responsiveness and bounce from the foam that helped generate some snappy workout efforts during these months. I raced the marathon in the Nike Alphafly 3. 

### Race Registration 

I applied for the Berlin Marathon via lottery. On 12/5/24, race organizers informed me that I was not selected in the initial drawing. To my pleasant (and very unexpected) surprise, I received a subsequent communication on 1/31/25, informing me that I was selected in the “second chance” drawing. 

Note: I have read that those accepted via second chance do not have the option to purchase a clothing drop bag on race day. If I did have that option, I failed to select it. As a result, I was not able to drop a bag on race day. I recommend taking a close look at this if you register for this race. If you don’t select the option at the time of registration there is no ability to add it afterwards! (I ended up being ok without it but I would have strongly preferred to have it to organize my race kit and snacks on race day.)

### Travel and Accommodations 

My wife and I traveled from Boston on Tuesday 9/16, arriving in Berlin in the morning on 9/17. The jet lag was significant. I was able to acclimate by race day but I wouldn’t have wanted any less time than I had to do so.

We attended the race expo on 9/18. The expo was great! Lots of vendors and good energy. Not a lot of free swag but there were several hydration and fuel samples throughout. I also picked up a pacing bracelet. 

We stayed at the Gat Point Charlie Hotel. The cost was reasonable, the accommodations were comfortable, and the central location in Mitte was walkable to several tourist attractions, historic landmarks, restaurants, bars, and cafes. I was also able to walk to the staging area on race morning in less than 30 minutes.

One note: There was no coffee in the hotel rooms. Breakfast is available in the dining area in the hotel and you can get coffee there but for those of us who were leaving for the race on the earlier side, it was not convenient to get breakfast or coffee on site. (It also seems like the norm for cafe culture in Berlin is to open a bit later than we are used to in the States. If you require an early morning coffee, it’s worth doing some research on this to plan accordingly.)

I was fairly diligent with carb loading and hydration for the few days leading up to the race. I tend to have a sensitive stomach so I tried to keep things as simple as possible. There were plenty of bread, pretzel, and pasta options around the city to meet those carb-loading needs. I generally adhere to a plant-based diet and I found Berlin to be a vegetarian’s paradise. There is also a welcoming non-alcoholic beer culture so it was possible (and fun) to join others in the local beer scene who didn’t have the same dietary restrictions I was feeling in the lead up to the race.

It did feel a bit stressful for me to balance sightseeing and the excitement of experiencing a new city with my desire to rest and energize for race day. It was manageable but I would just flag it as a consideration for those of you who are planning to use the race as a launchpad for a vacation. Would definitely recommend giving yourself some time after the race for more carefree tourism if you can swing it.

### Pre-Race

I was assigned to Group B, based on an anticipated finish of 3:15:00, which is the fastest anticipated time that is accepted unless you have a quicker qualifying time that is recognized by the race organizers. 

The race was scheduled to start at 9:15 a.m. for Groups A and B. Those in Groups A and B were permitted to enter the staging area at 7:00 a.m. I arrived at around 7:45 a.m. and, based on my observations, was still on the earlier side as compared to other runners. I had plenty of time to get settled, snack and hydrate, use the bathroom, and prepare for the start. But bathrooms and corrals became very crowded soon after I arrived. As reported elsewhere, a lot of people used bushes and trees to improvise after the porta potties became more crowded.

Somewhat disappointingly, I did not see water, coffee, or snacks in the staging area. This may not be “common” for other races but given the massive number of participants, and because New York had so much pre-race fuel, I thought there would be something for those who may have needed a final sip or bite before the race. (I brought stuff so I was ok.) 

If you have read anything about the 2025 race, you probably already know that it was unseasonably warm. It was about 66º F when I arrived and about 69º by 9:00 a.m. The temps continued to climb to about 80º by the time I finished at 12:35 p.m. Although far from ideal during the race, those warmer conditions made the pre-race waiting very comfortable. 

I was happy that I wore different shoes and socks to get to the corrals. There was dew on the grass and was very nice to put on dry racing shoes and socks to have dry feet at the start of the race. I also had sweats that I would be tossing. I didn’t need them for warmth but they were nice to provide a dry and relatively soft place to sit while I waited.

There was not a ton of space for warming up and people started packing into the corrals 30-45 minutes before the start. To avoid being completely boxed out I entered at about 8:40. It was a little annoying to be standing around unable to move much during those 45-ish minutes but the adrenaline, nervous energy, and music in the air made the time pass relatively quickly. I didn’t feel like my pre-race routine was bothered or derailed. 

The race started on time. I started with pacers for a sub-3:15:00 finish and reached the starting line about 5 minutes after the official start. 

### Race

Due to the aforementioned heat, it was not long before I opted to stray from my race plan. Race organizers sent out several warnings about the anticipated heat. Unfortunately, for me and apparently for many, the concerns were well founded.

In light of these weather circumstances, I opted to wear my hydration belt during the race. Although I was looking forward to the “advantage” of running light as I typically do for races, I’m glad I made this concession. I carried Gatorade and Maurten 160. The hydration stations were more limited and more chaotic than in other races I’ve run. The stations were generally only on one side of the road. Most only had water (although some did have Maurten 160 drink). And the race uses plastic cups, which are both more challenging to drink from and, I think, more treacherous to navigate on the road in and after each water station. Because I had my hydration belt, I was able to dodge much of this chaos for the first half of the race. As a result, I avoided the bottleneck of the crowds and was able to skip through the mess with dry feet and without even breaking stride.

I also carried my own fuel: 6 SiS gels, 2 of which were caffeinated. I consumed 5 of them: about 1 every 35 minutes. 

Miles 1-5

My plan was to go out at around 7:00 pace. I started around there and I felt good. I decided to move ahead of the 3:15 pacers. I remained cautiously hopeful that I would be able to stick to my plan and aim toward my goal.

Miles 6-10

The optimism did not last long. I continued to feel good through the first 10 miles but, by mile 10, I had a sense that harder times would be coming. I began to moderate my pace thinking that I could still come in under 3:15:00.

Miles 10-17

I should have dropped my pace more significantly through this portion to prevent excessive fatigue. The failure to do so cost me dearly in the final 10K.

Although now feeling a bit less confident, 3:15:00 was still within reach.

Miles 17-22

Not a whole lot to say here. Up to this point I *think* I was generally hydrating and fueling well. I was also supplementing with Salt Stick tabs, which have helped me mitigate cramping in the past. Notwithstanding, this is where it all began to unravel for me. Despite the reduction in pace, I was feeling fatigued. By mile 19-20, the pacers had caught me and I was hurting. By mile 22, I was feeling totally spent and beginning to question why I would ever do something like this for fun.

Miles 22-26.2

At this point, my goal was just to be done with this thing. 3:15:00 was not happening and I was doubting I could make 3:20:00. I nearly broke down entirely at mile 24, where I stopped momentarily to get water from my wife. She looked as terrified as I felt after she saw me on the verge of collapse.

I trudged on. Then, with less than a mile to go, I felt each of my calf muscles beginning to seize up. I was nearly halted by cramping. I slowed to a light bounce, guzzling water and massaging each calf, with the hope that I could open up my stride for the final 800 meters. Somehow the cramps subsided and I was able to forge ahead. 

And then it was over. It wasn’t pretty but I made it.


### Post-Race and Overall Impressions 

This was my second world major marathon and I loved it!

Weather aside, I can see why this course is regarded as such a fast one. To the extent there is any change in elevation, it is nominal. I noticed a couple relatively short climbs over some small bridges. Other than that there was no elevation to speak of. And with the exception of the water stations, I found the course to be generally spacious and comfortable throughout. There were definitely crowds of other runners but none that created some of the traffic jams I anticipated. 

As with any major race, it is so inspiring and unifying to see people of all shapes, sizes, ages, abilities, colors, and nationalities tackling the challenge together.

While the energy of spectators didn’t rise to what carried me through NYC, it was still fantastic. And what an incredible way to tour the city! It was also very easy for my wife to participate as spectator. Public transportation was smooth and easy to navigate. She was able to see me four times during the race (at KM 9, 19, 39, and 41). It is so great to see loved ones along the route like this!

The city is also incredibly welcoming to runners! Race entry comes with several days of free public transportation for participants and the buzz of runners and spectators is palpable across the city for the whole week. (The inline skating race on Saturday was also awesome to watch and an energizing way to get motivated for the race on Sunday.) We saw Berlin Marathon jackets, hats, tee-shirts, and bracelets wherever we went around the city during the week (and even in Prague and Copenhagen the week after the race). The camaraderie among racers and spectators runs deep and the visibility of that unity across the city made the whole experience that much more valuable.

This year’s race did not go according to plan. I fell well short of the time-based goal I came out to achieve. And I didn’t execute in the weather conditions as well as I would have liked. But I feel so fortunate to have had the opportunity for this experience. I am so grateful for my health, my mobility, my financial stability, and the support of my incredible wife, which have all made this running journey possible for me. Despite marked shortcomings, I leave Berlin feeling stronger, smarter, and even more grateful for the time and energy I am able to dedicate to this incredible running project at this stage of my life.

And that project continues! Two days after the race—while still hobbling from its effects on my body—I learned that I was accepted to the Boston Marathon. I don’t yet know how I will conceptualize my goal for that race but, before I do, I am going to take a minute to celebrate, breathe, regroup, and recover.

I am very excited to continue on this journey! I hope to connect with you along the way.

Cheers to you all and thank you, Berlin!

**Part 2**

September 15, 20xx

When there is fire, people tend to watch the flames or the burning objects. But with me, my eyes tend to be more attracted to the smoke — how they twirled and bounced in the air with the wind. If I were to explain it, I probably found it fascinating how even when the fire is gone, smoke still comes out of the ashes. Smoke signals a warning of a reignition. Smoke means something is waiting underneath the destruction. If given the chance. 

That was what I felt when I watched the stool burn away in my friend’s fireplace. I felt that even with the stool totally burnt, it wasn’t enough. There was this gnawing fear that there was more I needed to do. 

 My entire morning was a blur. When I touched the stool and it was warm, I remember holding my head in my hands and repeatedly screaming, “No!”. After a few moments of panicking, I called up one of my college friends and asked her if I could torch something at their family house’s fireplace. Immediately, without changing out of my pajamas or even drinking water, I went to their place and threw the stool into the fire. 

Seeing me in that state must’ve been like seeing a deranged person running away from the mental hospital. My friend worriedly asked me what was wrong when she saw me scrambling to push the stool’s legs deeper into the fire. 

I sniffled, watching the smoke, “Sorry Hannah, it’s been a rough week for me. Someone’s… been stalking me lately and sending me things.”

I lied so naturally, a habit I didn’t know how I developed from childhood. “This is the latest one and I think I just finally cracked from the fear.”

”Oh my God,” Hannah gasped, joining me on the floor. “That must’ve been so scary. When did this start? Did you go to the police? Why didn’t you tell me?”

Hearing her questions somehow made my head hurt. The ringing in my ears is rising in volume. And if last time was any indication, the nightmare was about to pull me back in. Any anxiety I had instantly doubled and washed over me. I shivered, even though I was close to the fire. 

“I’m sorry Hannah for freaking you out too,” I moaned. “But I don’t want to talk about it now. Please?”

I could feel her stare bore into me for a few seconds until she sighed in resignation. “Okay, I understand. I made some eggs and toast, join me in the kitchen if you want some.”

I finally turned towards her, gratitude in my tone. “Thank you so much. I’ll definitely explain everything to you soon.”

Hannah smiled warily but her expression hardened. “Sure, Seli. Just update me occasionally. If you don’t, I’m going to assume something’s happened and I’ll storm your apartment with the police. You got that?”

I laughed, “Alright.”

Hannah stood up and walked towards their huge dining area. As if to lighten the mood, she started enlightening me about gossip from her work and some drama about her boyfriend’s friends' girlfriends. She didn’t seem to mind me staying silent. Just like when we were in college.

Gazing back into the fading smoke, I gulped and started doing some breathing exercises. I kept it up until I could no longer hear the wood crackling or feel the warmth on my face or hear Hannah groan about someone named Amy. And when there was nothing left but the ashes, I prayed that nothing else would bother me. And in my friend’s house, I thought my prayer would be answered. 

And later, I would know that there was no answer. 

———————

After breakfast, I realized I did not have my diary with me. I usually had it with me wherever I went. Without it, I felt incomplete. And now, with what’s going on, I felt unsafe too. In my fear, I left the things that could potentially keep me grounded and sane. 

Hannah, somewhat as a joke, suggested I write in a Google Docs or maybe even post onto a private Instagram or other social media. Something that I could access anywhere and anytime. But I reminded her that not only did I not have an active social media account, I did not have my phone with me. And Google or other sites required 2-step verification with a second device or your phone number if I attempted to log into them. And as I stayed there whining, she handed me her old laptop and told me to go on Reddit and make an anonymous post. 

She even reasoned, “Who knows, maybe someone is going through the same thing you’re going through and will help you out. Or at least, Reddit’s a valid place to complain about it.”

I took a few seconds to think about it. She was kinda right - I don’t have my diary *or* my phone and all I needed was to vent in my writings. And, really, the medium didn’t matter. If I didn’t stick to my Mom’s tradition, I would've already started an online diary somewhere on the internet. 

Thanking Hannah, I started typing on the dining table while she did the dishes. Knowing I wasn’t alone, even just for a little while, lessened the tension in my body. That was good. It made me write clearly and precisely all my thoughts down.

At some point, Hannah mused, “You really love journaling, huh.”

“Uh-huh,” I grunted, eyes on the screen.

“When we were in college you’d always immediately pull out your journal at the end of the last class. You would zone out while you were writing. And sometimes you were so in the zone, you didn’t notice us taking pictures with you.”

My typing paused and I looked at her dumbfounded , “Wait seriously? Why am I finding this out *now*? I must’ve looked weird!”

She laughed, “No, you looked endearing! Everyone said so! But *you* should also know we have an album of just you just writing in your journal.”

That made me think. “Do I really concentrate that much when I write?”

Hannah nodded, “Mm-mmh. It’s like you didn’t think of doing anything else until you finished writing. We get it, though. You told us it was like a ritual you had with your mom.”

“Huh.” 

I heard the clinking of dishes stop and Hannah wiping her hands. With a lull in the conversation and my focus gone, I tried to recall why I was so gungho about writing during college. I wasn’t that serious when I was a kid. Then again, I was *still* a kid. Maybe it was a trauma response to my mom’s death? Maybe. 

Hannah, having prepared tea and coffee, sat across from me. “It’s actually impressive you’ve kept it up all this time. It’s like keeping a part of your mom with you. I like it. And it’s also a good habit to have.”

“Thanks,” I softly said. 

“How did you maintain it all this time anyway? Surely, you must've been bored doing it, especially when you were in high school.”

That question triggered a memory within me. It just popped in my mind, like an elusive deep-sea fish breaking the surface of the water. 

“I guess I had a pretty strong motivation to do so.”

”Oh? What would that be?”

“My mom’s Christian, so she had me baptized as a baby, right? But I never really went to church cause my mom wouldn’t bring me there, on account of her working even on weekends. So I… developed a habit of praying to just about anyone.”

Hannah made a confused face. “Wait, how?”

”Okay. For example, on Christmas, I wouldn’t write a letter to Santa or even Jesus. I would just write, ‘To whoever’s listening…’”

Laughter erupted in the room. I couldn’t blame Hannah for trying to hide her giggling. I ended up laughing with her because of how ridiculous my story was. 

“So when you were a kid, you were, like, praying to the wind?”

”I know it sounds random and out of nowhere but it’s true,” I explained in fits of laughter. “Everytime I wanted something I would look outside the window and just go, ‘Please, please, please’.”

”How did your mom react?” Hannah asked, shaking her head. 

I took a breath as I calmed down. “I think she heard me wishing on the stars and to imaginary fairies constantly that she thought it would make sense to just make me write them down on something. Mom probably didn’t want me to start doing the ‘praying’ that I was doing at school.”

Hannah sipped at her tea as she thought out loud. “Oh, I get it. When you were a kid, you wrote down your wishes in your diary. And since you don’t really lose your desires as you grow up, the habit just formed.”

“Yes,” I affirmed her conclusion. “However, when you grow up, your wishes just get fewer and fewer and you become more grounded to reality. At least, that’s what happened to me. So over time, my habit evolved into simply recording my daily life.” 

In my mind, it made sense. I was a kid full of prayers that I scattered to the winds, hoping it would reach anyone — be it a god, an angel, or even a devil. But when my mom died, those prayers died with her. The diaries turned into a way to keep a memory of her alive, so it just contained frustrations and “what-ifs” about my life.

Now that I’m thinking about it and writing stuff here, I feel like I haven’t been writing optimistic things lately. My wishes have dried up and my life has remained the same monotonous grey.

———————

 

Hannah couldn’t keep me as a guest even for a night. Apparently, she had plans to have dinner with her boyfriend tonight. And having no plans on being a third wheel, I bid her goodbye. But not before promising her I would call at the first sign of distress. 

My hands were shaking when I opened the door to my home. Stepping in, I saw that my apartment remained the way it was when I left it this morning. But instead of relaxing, I got even more nervous. That meant whatever change was about to happen needed me to witness it. 

Worse, the ringing in my ear came back. My anxiety was slowly worming its way to anger. It was ridiculous to feel unsafe in my own house. But I couldn’t deny that I was also scared. 

*Crap, I should just go to a hotel tonight.* 

Steeling myself, I strode towards the bedroom to pack some things. I quickly found my phone still connected to the charger. My gun, work clothes, and other necessities were dumped into a backpack. Finally, I retrieved my diary from where I hid it. Without looking, I threw it in, zipped up the bag, and looked for my shoes.

I didn’t bother changing out of my pajamas. No shower, either. Without context, I looked like an overgrown kid running away from home, with a backpack and keys in hand. 

Driving away in my car, I allowed myself to relax and listen to music. I drove quietly with only pop tunes and the GPS filling in the silence. Soon, the mechanical voice alerted me that I was near my destination. And as I attempted to make a turn, a bike suddenly came into my view.

I cursed out and stepped on the brakes. The sudden stop lurched me forward along with my bag. I heard it topple over and some of my things spilling out. In my rush, I might have failed to zip it up properly. 

Making sure no one was injured, I chided the cyclist loudly before calming down. Then I remembered my bag. But I couldn’t exactly try to retrieve my things now, so I just made a mental reminder for myself to secure them better next time. I reached over to right the position of my bag at least but then something caught my eye.

It was my diary. The small, leather-bound one I bought earlier this year. But one thing was off, something I didn’t see when I was hastily shoving things in my bag. The color was different.

My diary had turned pink. Magenta-like, bright pink. Like my first diary.

Before I could think of anything else, a piercing honk blared as a truck was barreling towards my car. The sounds of a crash reverberated in my ears along with a high-pitched ringing. 

———————

September 17, 20xx

Needless to say, I woke up to the other world. At first I wasn’t sure since I woke up in a hospital ward and everything looked “normal”. But I noticed I didn’t have injuries or bruises that might connect to a car crash. Also, my bag with my belongings were nowhere to be found and the nurses looked at me weird when I asked for them. And then my suspicions were confirmed when Casey walked in. 

She merely shook her head at my glare before walking up to my bed and explained what happened. She said she witnessed me faint and fall to the floor, hitting my head. And unable to wake me up, she brought me to the hospital. It had been 4 days since. And it seemed like “our” father wasn’t able to visit. 

It must’ve been when I blacked out and returned to the real world. Then when the crash happened, I was inexplicably pulled back here. Yep, I was right. *This* is a nightmare. 

I pressed my palms to my eyes. *What was the trigger for the switch? I know the sign of it happening: the intense ringing in my ears. But what caused it?* 

*What brought me here? And why did items that belong here appear in the real world?*

I sighed and closed my eyes. There was no point thinking about it, there was too much to process at the moment. And perhaps if I sleep now, I’ll wake up to the real world tomorrow. But just as I was about to get comfortable, Casey piped up. 

“Since you woke up and doctors found nothing wrong with you, they’ve allowed you to be discharged tomorrow,” she happily exclaimed. “And once you’re stable enough, I’ll contact your therapist to assign more sessions for you.”

I made no response and my eyes remained closed. Whatever’s going on isn’t real anyways, and she hasn’t made a move to threaten my safety. In regards to my sanity, on the other hand, is another question. But as long as I keep a safe mental distance from her and everyone in this world, I can most likely return home. I know it. 

The voice in my head said so. 

———————

September 18, 20xx

Getting home was a breeze but settling in in the odd apartment that I, according to Casey, shared with her was anything else but. Like I said before, there were random things here and there that were the farthest things from what I would’ve bought. It took some time, but I managed to control my reactions whenever I saw something new. 

I tried to relax with a cup of coffee in front of the TV even though Casey hovered over me. She didn’t hide that she was wary of how I’d act. And considering I pointed a gun at her the last time I saw her, I could not blame her.

Eventually, I gave up and went to my room to do something else. Then it dawned on me to check my diary. *Has it actually turned pink?*

The answer was no. Pulling it out of the plushie, it was still black, as it always has been. *But then what made it turn pink? Or did I just hallucinate it happening?*

*What was real? What was fake?*

Staring at it won’t answer my questions, so I settled myself onto a chair in my room, ready to write a new entry. However, before I could do that, I had to read my past entries. I half-expected the change, but seeing it with my own eyes was nothing short of horrific. 

It was my penmanship and my writing style. I could even identify the different types of pen I used. But the entries were nothing from what I remembered. Just skimming through it, I mentioned Casey a handful of times. The word “roommate” even appeared in some of the pages.

I felt a headache coming in. Then the unmistakable feeling of familiarity for the entries in the diary washed over me. Suddenly, the words I didn’t remember writing felt natural. With my gaze finally fixed on a blank page, a memory of me going to the park with Casey started playing in my mind. 

I was lying down on the grass and Casey came over to scold me for not laying out the blanket. I laughed and helped her unpack food and drinks from a big canvas bag. I remember reading a book and drinking hot chocolate from a thermos I prepared. And my sister was beside me, typing on her laptop, probably working on her newest book. 

*What was the title again? She told me me it was a children’s book this time cause her publisher—*

The “memory” stopped there. The pain woke me up, my hands shaking from the slap I gave myself. 

“What just happened?” I murmured. “I don’t— I never…”

Then the ringing came. It was painful but right now, it was giving me a chance to escape this nightmare. I knew. It was the warning that I was going to go back to the real world. The pain upped a level and I was ready to scream, but I held it in. Waiting for salvation, I closed my eyes and held my breath. 

But it stopped and I felt a hand on my shoulder. And between my rapid and shallow breathing, I swore I heard someone click their tongue. 

I lifted my eyes to Casey. Her smile was like what a mother would give to her child to comfort them. But to me, it was laced with something more sinister, something otherworldly. 

———————

September 19, 20xx

Casey didn’t say or do anything out of the ordinary when she found me acting weird yesterday. She chalked it up to an “episode” when I asked during dinner. Then she gave a curt smile and stayed quiet for the rest of the night. This morning too, she acted normal and saw me off as I went to work. 

At work, meanwhile, nothing changed. No new boss or strange coworkers I didn’t recognize. Left with a piece of the real world, I worked without thought. I wasn’t given a chance to think about my situation anyway, because I was bombarded with reports and emails. Well, owing to the fact that I was unconscious for days at the hospital, there were things that certainly needed to be completed right away. 

I ended up staying late, of course. And as I stepped out of the office at 8 PM, it occurred to me that I hadn’t mesaged Casey about coming home late. But I caught myself reaching for my phone to call her. *Wait, why should I call her as if she’s actually real?*

I made an agreement to myself to play along to this reality. That didn’t mean I should let myself get carried away. And besides, even if I did have a sister, I’m already an adult. I’m fine. 

Driving home amidst traffic was the same degree of frustration. If the parallel world was going to change something, it should’ve eased traffic for everyone. While waiting for the nth red light to turn green, I reminisced about the time Casey slept during traffic and woke up thinking we made it home, only to see we never moved from the same spot. I chuckled to myself. 

*Wait, what?*

Honking from the cars behind me distracted me from my thoughts. Driving off and getting home, I eventually forgot what got me so confused. 

Casey was typing on her laptop in the living room when I walked into the apartment. She might’ve been too busy because she only greeted me back with a grunt and a wave. She was so in tune in writing that she didn’t notice me watching her. 

Somehow, it felt more natural for her to be here. The incongruity I felt was gone and replaced with a sort of harmony. Casey, my sister, felt more familiar than the thought of me being alone in this apartment. 

Then I started thinking about the supposed mental illness Casey said I had. False memories replacing real ones due to trauma. *Could she be telling the truth?* 

As I sat on the bed, I glanced at my socks. Socks our father gifted me when he visited us a year ago. Then I caught a glimpse of one of the pictures decorating my walls. There was a picture of me and Casey…with Mom. 

*Wait—*

”Your 11th birthday,” Casey said with a smile, standing by the door. “Too bad I wasn’t actually there. But when I found the photo in Mom’s room, I just couldn’t help myself making a version where I was there… with you.”

As she approached me, I looked closely at the framed photo. It looked like she was actually there. 

“You must be pretty good at photoshop,” I concluded. 

She giggled, “I wish. My friend did the editing. He used one of my own birthday photos taken during the same year you had this party.”

Never taking my eyes off the photo, nostalgia and longing filled me. “Looking at it, it makes me miss Mom even more now.”

I could feel Casey alternating her attention from me to the photo. Then, as if a light bulb lit up above her head, she nudged me. 

“What do you say we go home?” She suggested. 

“What? Why now?” I countered. “I can’t just go home when I suddenly miss Mom. Besides, I have work and so do you.”

”No, think about it,” Casey said, beaming. “When was the last time we visited Mom? Don’t you think it’s about time to check up on her?”

I was thinking of rejecting the idea when she continued. 

“I need material for my children’s book anyway. It would be nice to get fresh concepts for a story when we’re out of the city. Also, it would be *extra* nice for you to use your *extra* PTO, that you didn’t use when I invited you to come with me to Hawaii.”

I cringed at that reminder. I remembered promising Casey that I would vacation with her to Hawaii, but work overwhelmed my schedule that I ended up cancelling. After that, Casey would not fail to bring it up everytime I mildly upset her. 

With a deep breath, I returned her cheeky grin and nodded. “Okay, fine.”

She held my hands tightly as she jumped up and down. “Yes! I’m going to pack my things and you should too!”

She practicallly skipped out of my room and went out to look for our suitcases from one of the closets near the entrance. 

Feeling her enthusiasm, I went to one of my bedside tables to look for my phone charger. It died during traffic and I needed to let Dad know of our plans cause Casey usually forgets to update him. 

Suspecting that the charger may have been left unplugged this morning, I knelt down and started to pat my hand around for it behind the table. But I felt something else. A gun.

*Weird. I knew I had my gun under the bed. Did I change where I hid it somehow? But when?* I inspected it in my hands, turning it around to maybe gauge whether this was Casey’s. 

Then in a violent rush to my head, a ringing drilled into my ears, along with it was a desperate voice. 

*Stay away from her. Stay away from her. Stay away from her—*

1nslxvl,https://www.reddit.com/r/widowers/comments/1nslxvl/bad_day_on_fridayrant/,Bad day on Friday/rant,"I had an absolutely bad day and from the advice of people here I'm been looking into therapy. Friday was probably the worst day I just couldn't shake what I was experiencing, music didn't help, podcast, books. Nothing to take my mind off from it all. The visuals of seeing my partners face. While I was at work I distanced myself to protect others from me, not in a harmful physical way. Just lashing out on someone. After I got home I told my family I want to be alone for the day. I want to be alone and I went to the store and I bought beer and a small bottle of alcohol. I just needed something to dive myself into and do something that wasn't gonna make me think about my partner. So I choose a video game of uncharted saga. And I drank and I drank. But my alcoholic training prevented me from getting blackout drunk. But I did have a moment of fucked up thought: two days after my partner died her parents told me that they don't want anything to do with me. No contact. I felt like they chose to blame me and everyone in my partner family decided to distance themselves from me. I don't blame them, even though I didn't do anything wrong. I loved their daughter and still in love with her, always will. But they get to be together and grief. Me I'm alone. I don't get so grief with someone who knew her. I have to walk this path alone, which makes me mad, angry and I fuckin hate everything. But I'm lucky to be able to vent here and talk to people here and know that I'm not alone in this feeling. But I wish I could talk to my partner's parents, family. But I don't want to cause pain. And maybe that's what I am to them a reminder that she is gone. And I'm so fuckin sorry. I wish I could of provented everything. That we could still do everything me and her planned on doing together. And I wish I could just stay in that moment when we both were happy together again. I'm sorry for the long rant. Just free typing what I'm feeling.

1nslwp7,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1nslwp7/insight_from_those_who_work_at_familyownedlocal/,Insight from those who work at family-owned/local cafes?,"Ive worked around coffee for about 8 years (lead barista, trainer, cafe manager), I also have a degree in hospitality management but this is my first experience working at a local family-owned shop. They have a few locations in the area, been around 10+ years and they roast really awesome stuff. I’ve enjoyed my time with them so far and the job is easy, but the pay is awful! They advertise $18/hr but the base rate is $12 plus tips (which working overseas for some time, this was confusing to me). My location has average traffic but I barely make $15 with my tips factored in. I’ve spoken with the owner about it bc I thought it was a mistake and they mentioned something about taxes and they’re not able to pay higher bc they’re small business. I’ve come from larger businesses so I understand where I need to manage my expectations when it comes to pay but I suppose my philosophy of don’t open a business if you can’t pay your staff a livable wage isnt universal lol. 

We’re also expected to attend mandatory weekly and monthly meetings after closing - they’re paid but so inconvenient if you’re an opener. Admin changes are a little chaotic and disorganized (new specials come at random, menus aren’t updated with correct pricing). We’re also are asked for ideas for new drink specials, merch, etc. i don’t know if it’s my background in bigger businesses, but I feel like that is a job for marketing maybe? It isn’t only a barista role, you’re on register, you prep food, you cook, you make syrups - which I actually like bc there’s always something to do…it’s the pay that’s starting to wear me down.

Overall, It doesn’t seem like it’s enough for what the job requires; however, I don’t have anything to compare it to since I’ve been working overseas. 

For those who also work with small business or family owned shops in the US, is this experience normal? I really pride myself on my hospitality, passion for coffee and would love to continue working with local businesses if I can but maybe wanting fair pay is pipe dream.",1,1759058745.0,barista,2,1.0,False

1nslw05,https://www.reddit.com/r/roommateproblems/comments/1nslw05/roommate_is_overly_comfortable_with_me/,Roommate is overly comfortable with me,"i (28F) have been living with my roommate (30F) and another roommate (25M) for around 5 months now. One roommate (25M) is super introverted and keeps to himself and doesn’t really cook just tends to make a ready meal and take to his room - so I don’t see him often.

My other roommate (30F) is very extroverted and works from home either in her room at her desk or in the shared living room / kitchen. 

A little backstory, both of these roommates I didn’t know personally prior to them moving in - we were connected through me posting about seeking a new roommate through Instagram stories. One roommate (30F) I was mutuals with on IG as we’re both creatives.

Me and (30F) started sparked abit more of a connection than (25M) I think because we’re closer in age and also we’re both quite house proud and like to go and buy things for the house and decorate etc. I wouldn’t say we have much in common like I would with my friends but it was perfect in a roommate sort of way where we could go on a walk to get groceries together etc.

She’s quite dry and sarcastic which can be funny at times but also can rub me the wrong way as some of her comments come across as super critical or humiliating. She is a very aggy person where she’ll be explaining something that’s happened outside of the house or annoyed about our other roommate (25M) not cleaning properly but will be shouting about it in a way that triggers me as it feels like she’s shouting at me and I can’t get a word of  response in. She started drama with roommate (25M) because of him not cleaning when I didn’t really care at first because it’s his first house share and I kind of like cleaning myself as he doesn’t really do it properly, but was forced to say something to him because she said she was sick of being “bad cop” and he took it the wrong way and we had a little falling out over it. I noticed that as soon as I had that with our roommate (25M) she tried to play like mediator and kind of enjoyed the fact that she could be seen as the nice or good cop? Just weird

She also shouted at me on a bike ride through the city before because she’s not used to cycling as much as I am and I was going ahead of her but was super angry and called me something along the lines of stupid which ruined the vibe and made me want to go home immediately. She just tends to scold me a lot where I then regret hanging out or opening up to her because she’s so critical and will often see my life as entertainment or “drama” and “wants to know the tea” so I stopped sharing so much.

I felt sorry for her that she doesn’t have many friends and made the mistake of bringing her out to meet some of my closest friends who she has seen on my Instagram and has mentioned multiple times how cool they are and is very interested in our dynamic. However i think she felt she knew enough about them through Instagram or from things I’ve brought up that she feels she knows them - but my friends don’t actually know her if you get what I mean, they just know it’s a new roommate I’ve said I have enjoyed living with as of recent. Both times she met my friends she has said something quite rude or overly familiar to them where I’ve had to take them to the side and apologise for her behaviour/comments. 

One of the times we were at a busy music event and my male best friend was walking a little ahead of us (he walks super fast) and she kept shouting at him to wait up as she was scared of us getting split up, but she kept pulling on his bag straps and yanking on his arm multiple times after he told her to stop. The last time he told her to stop she shouted at him to calm down when he was calm and he snapped and told her to F off. She then burst into tears and I had to stay with her whilst my other friends went off to have some space from the situation. I then told her that she shouldn’t have kept touching him as she doesn’t know him like that and also her tone can come across as super bossy and rude and that sometimes I don’t like that either. She apologised and said she wanted to say sorry to him but also kept claiming that he didn’t know her well enough for him to tell her to F off, but to me I could see why he got so triggered.

Eventually we made a meeting point with my other friends and they briefly spoke and made up but my male best friend kept his distance from her the rest of the night as he was weirded out by her behaviour. This also sparked me and my best friend to have a big falling out the next day as he felt like I didn’t have his back in the situation but I honestly was just caught in the middle because on one hand I wanted to go with him and my other best friends as she was irritating me so much also, but then I had to stay with her otherwise she would be alone at a music event and it wouldn’t of been safe. 

It was awkward after that at home because me and my male best friend didn’t speak for a week as he wanted space from me. My roommate seemed to enjoy that I had also fallen out with him as it I guess in her head was something we could bond over?

Me and my best friend ended up meeting to talk about our friendship and it ended up being super necessary and something we needed as we have been friends for almost a decade now. I told my roommate that we were friends again and you could tell it worried her in a way because now it was just her that had a problem with him. 

Also it’s super awkward because I feel like I can’t bring my friends over now because of the way she is with them. I had one friend that was visiting from the states who I never get to see stay over one night, and in the morning when we were making food she came into the kitchen and started talking at us about a guy she hooked up with last night, but doing the shouty tone as usual where we don’t get a chance to even respond and I could tell it was making my friend uncomfortable so I said we were going to eat breakfast on my balcony that connects to my room. Me and my friend finished eating then went and sat on my bed and were catching up and my roommate takes it upon herself to enter my room without knocking and say “I heard laughter guys what’s going on” and saying she felt left out and sat on my bed with us but please bare in mind she’s never met my other friend.

This made me and my friend super irritated to where he got ready and left early to go meet another friend and I felt so stupid for not being able to speak up for myself or tell her to not enter my room like that when im with someone.

Since I got fired from my job I see her everyday. She wakes up super early and tends to already be at the table on her laptop when I come into the kitchen to make my breakfast and always wants to engage in convo. I have days where I can kind of see past the irritating traits and try and just sit with her and have a coffee but recently it’s been so difficult.

I’m the type of pretty resilient person where a lot of bad things have happened to me where I bounce back from it pretty well which I think was probably learnt from having a unpredictable and fairly traumatic childhood. I’ve been getting major opportunities since being fired from my job and it’s sort of made my roommate spiral. I notice her face change when I mention something positive where she’s happy for me then immediately is down on herself. 

She mentioned to me that she’s going to be subletting her room for two months to get away and her career isnt really taking off and she’s “sick of everyone be successful around her” and she’s said she’s “bitter” and made comments about how lucky I am etc to which I always am like “oh don’t be like that “ but don’t really have anything to say as I’ve been too much of an open ear and she’s just quite negative energy nowadays where I feel like i don’t want to feel bad for mentioning good things happening to me.

I can’t even make eye contact with her recently and just want to eat in my room and avoid her and all my friends have told me I need to make some distance from her which I agree with with but she’s super hard to set boundaries with as she gets in a mood when I actively avoid her. She constantly tries to schedule in us doing activities together which I’m not interested in doing anymore as she’s just stressed me out so much and also tries to intimidate me by asking me standing in the doorway of me room or the kitchen when I’m making food like trying to force me to make eye contact. She kind of scares me in a way now because she has never taken just apologised for being intense and given me my space, she just wants to constantly monitor me in a way it feels. 

I do take accountability for how I should’ve called her out way earlier on her behaviours. Part of me feels like maybe she doesn’t know how intense she is or doesn’t have social cues but I just feel at 30 years old you should kind of know these things? I tend to feel sorry for people without seeing the red flags from early until it’s too late.

Sorry I know it’s super long story but there’s so much more and just feeling quite lost of how to deal going forward

I was always the girl eating alone at her own lunch table in school. Nobody ever paid attention to me. I didn’t get the chance to go to college where most people seem to have made friends. I could never afford it and I didn’t get grants and had nobody to co-sign a loan. I’ve struggled to maintain employment because of my mental health, but jobs I did have never had coworkers. I usually ran the store alone or it was independent working and there wasn’t much interaction. So I feel like I missed out on all the ways people usually make friends. 

I honestly don’t think that a single person has ever cared about me or worried about me or loved me. It’s really hard not having an emergency contact at the hospital. 

I don’t really want just social interaction. Im actually not shy at all. I can keep a conversation going. I just don’t know where to go to find people. I’ve tried meetups. Everyone just goes to be social for an hour or two. Then they all just return home to their loved ones. Nobody exchanges numbers. Nobody wants anything long term. It feels like everybody already has their own long term friends so they’re not looking for more. I also have $0 to my name. I can’t even afford the bus fare to get anywhere. I have tried bars and coffee shops when I have $10, which isn’t often. People don’t make friends by talking to strangers for a couple minutes in public. It just doesn’t happen that way. I’ve tried. 

People suggest making friends online but it just doesn’t feel real to me. I guess I view a friend as someone to hang out with and someone who will actually care about me if I have a bad day. I’ve never had that before. I’ve always just had to suffer through my pain alone. 

I don’t have any hobbies or interests outside of watching tv/movies. They don’t have groups for that. I’ve looked. I even tried to make one myself but it didn’t work. It seems like all groups focus around a physical activity of some kind like hiking or sports. I can’t do much physical activity because of disability. 

So I’ve put myself out there. It just hasn’t been successful. Most people don’t want to add more friends in their life at this later age. 

I’m actually good at having enjoyable conversations. I’m not a bad person. I am nerdy and a bit weird. I’m auDHD with a ton of trauma and crippling OCD, but even nerds are entitled to friends. I just don’t know where to find people who want something more long term and not just pleasant small talk and then a goodbye. 

I’d honestly prefer a boyfriend rather than a friend.   I’d rather just sink all my attention into serving a man and pleasing him in exchange for being loved and taken care of. But apparently I’m undateable. 

Will anyone be a friend? I am quite depressed. I have no human contact anymore. I talk to myself and my walls. I wonder if I’ll ever get to feel like a normal human. I have zero people I can call or text. Does anyone want to try to connect and be able to meet in person? I’m tired of being so sad that my brain is melting. Please don’t tell me to get a therapist. I’ve had therapists my entire life. They don’t help. Because therapists don’t care about you. They don’t bond with you as a person.  I’m afraid of what will happen to me if I don’t find a boyfriend or friend soon. I’m dangling by a thread. I think most people suggest that because they have at least someone who loves them. They have at least one friend or one family member who cares about what happens to them. When you don’t have that, talking to a therapist every week doesn’t matter much. I’ve been seeing one weekly for years. It doesn’t make me feel any better. I think having a true, deeply connected friend or a boyfriend who actually wants me and loves me might.

1nslh2y,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1nslh2y/im_42f_frustrated_with_my_foreverunemployed/,"I'm (42F) frustrated with my forever-unemployed boyfriend (59M), who won't look for work and willingly chooses poverty. He won't get even get medical treatment because of costs.","**TL;DR: he's a good, kind and loving boyfriend -  but has no career, no job, and isn't even trying to find one. I don't know whether to stay with him.**

I'm a working professional, I own my property, and have a stable career in IT, and have been saving towards an early retirement. I make $135,000 a year. I'm on track on my financial goals. But I've never had great relationships with men somehow. I almost gave up on the idea, and thought I'd just stay single for the rest of my life.

We met about 10 months ago, at a local live music venue. We always had great chemistry.

He has a 17 year old son from a previous marriage, who lives with him.

I do love him a lot, he's kind and affectionate, and he's the most serious relationship I've ever had. He's the only man to ever treat me with respect and return the feeling. But he has no career, no job and no prospect of ever getting one at his age.

I knew he was a recovering drug addict and dealer 20 years ago. After spending a year in prison, he rehabilitated himself and did a diploma, in something that didn't lead to consistent and reliable income. He has worked odd jobs for years (i.e. pressure-washing, mover, cleaning a construction site etc), often getting paid under the table or as a contractor.

When I met him, he had a regular gig and went to work every day, but it ended since. He wasn't even fired, since he's a contractor - the friend who employed him as a temp  at his company just stopped offering him further work. He's now living off government welfare (which is barely liveable in Australia). Any work he ever gets is through a friend trying to help, rather than applying to stuff.

Thing is, in Australia, the minimum wage is $24.95 an hour. ANY full-time job, or even a part time job, can provide a decent living. There are FREE programs offered by the government to retrain people for work. But he's not even trying, and rules out any potential job I suggest. Security guard? That's ""too boring, standing around someplace for hours"". Caring for elderly people? He's grossed out. Amazon warehouse? Too old to do that. Most jobs he just rules out because he's too old, has ADHD, has no relevant experience. Etc etc. He had some of the above jobs, but always ended up fired from them.

My perspective on it is yes, these jobs do suck, but most people hate their jobs. I did tech support call centres for years to get to where I am right now. Do you think I enjoyed it? No. We all do it because we have to. And if you do it for long enough, save up, gain experience etc, you can afford to upgrade jobs later on, till you find a bearable one.

In other countries, people like him would have probably be forced to find work. Here, unemployment benefits (""Centrelink"" payments) can last forever. It demotivates people who are otherwise capable of working. I also think that he's not being a good role model to his 17 year old son. My bf also has a medical condition that's currently going untreated, because he has no private health insurance (edit: he was referred to a specialist, and the wait on public Medicare is extremely long).

I do love spending time with him and we do have a rare connection. But it's hard. He'd always offer to pay for dinner, but I can't take anything off him knowing how little he has. I don't feel comfortable letting him get more than coffee.

One time we went to a restaurant together for a pasta special dinner. He mistakenly ordered the wrong type of wine, which turned out to be more expensive than the wine that was included in the special. When the tab came and mistake was made clear, he was really frustrated, and commented about it a few times throughout the night. It made me feel uncomfortable.

I began this relationship knowing we won't be on equal financial grounds and that I'm in a much higher income bracket -  but back then he had *some work* that he went to every day. I'm really worried about him. He told me he'd never ask me for money, and we agreed on never living together, but it's hard to keep finances out of a serious relationship. Even if I could support him financially, I wouldn't want to. It's not good for my self esteem.

I don't know what to do. I don't want to leave him, but I also can't watch him neglect his medical issue because of his, it's starting to affect me too. He has visible symptoms.

I'm sitting here and crying as I type this. I love him too much to leave him, but I hate to slowly discover what I signed up for. I wasn't mentally-filtering for unemployed men when I met him, like most single women my age too, because I never considered this to be an option for a guy - everyone has to work, right? I was stupid. Now I'm in too deep.

I'm looking to hear from someone who faced this. I don't know what to do. One thing is certain, I cannot change a man who doesn't want to change.",2,1759057266.0,relationship_advice,46,0.6,False

1nsl6h8,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbyborderlines/comments/1nsl6h8/pregnant_with_first_and_ubpd_mum_playing_games/,Pregnant with first and uBPD mum playing games,"Tl;dr - my mum is manipulating an ongoing conversation now my due date has arrived in an effort to find out when I go into labour so she a) knows before everyone else and b) exerts some control over a situation where she doesn’t feel she has any. And I’m kicking myself because I’ve bloody let her. Apologies everyone…this is long and rambling as all shit while I try and get everything out of my head to purge.  Here goes:

Ugh…this is minor biscuits compared to the shit she’s done in the past when I was a kid: the rage, the beatings, kicking me out multiple times from the age of 9 and the emotional manipulation, but honestly, I’m seriously annoyed at this!

My other half and I are having our first - my due date hit on Friday (so currently 40+2).

I hadn’t told anyone the due date, just that I was due ‘around the end of Sept/beginning of Oct.’ 

I’m VLC with my mum usually and have reduced it even further over the pregnancy because her ‘anxiety’ has been off the charts. For instance, when I was 22 weeks pregnant, I marshalled an ultra marathon one Saturday in the middle of nowhere with virtually no signal, so missed my mum’s two Whatsapps and a call from mid afternoon. 

Got home late at around 10pm, saw them come through and figured I’d give her a call back the next morning after breakfast instead if disturbing her late (like a sane person). She tried to call a couple of times during breakfast (pre-8am on a Sunday) while I was sat outside reading the papers in the sunshine without my phone. She then tried calling my other half (who never picks up the phone to her), and then called everyone in the family and told them something terrible had happened to me. Because that’s the obvious answer when someone doesn’t get back to you within 15 hours.

By the time I came back inside half an hour later, I had a bunch of messages from my aunt, bro and dad worriedly checking in on me as she’d told them she hadn’t been able to get hold of me for days. Soooo…usual shit, really - she pulled that schtick a lot in my twenties to everyone from family, to friends to work to my landlord. 

When I called her back, she had that uber-relieved voice on, “Oh god, thank goodness, thank GOODNESS! I thought something _terrible_ had happened to you!” Nope, you were just thirsty for the drama you claim to hate so much - I was just out all day yesterday and I could have been asleep at 0715am on a fricking Sunday, you mentalist.

So, I’ve been keeping things as low-key as possible throughout the pregnancy - I set my boundaries on contact very early and have been maintaining them strongly until now. If she had her way, she’d talk to me every day, asking me anxiously, ‘is everything ok? Are you ok?’ and then getting annoyed when I said I was fine.  

I’ve spoken to her maybe every ten days or so, where she digs for anything tragically juicy about the pregnancy that she can talk about to complete strangers in the coffee shop she goes to. She then gets annoyed when I grey rock and don’t give her anything and finally spends twenty minutes moaning about how sick with worry she is every single day that her ‘nightmare neighbour’ will go out that evening and leave her dog to bark until she gets back (this has happened only twice since the neighbour got the dog nearly two years ago and the neighbour sees right through her - just refuses to engage with her craziness since my mum crawled through her hedge to bang on her back window for just the once daring to host her friends at 11.30pm). My mum still spends every day worried the dog will bark apparently - she’ll go into her garden and onto the drive to try and see whether there are lights on in the neighbour’s house every single day.

Anyway, she called me on Friday morning, my due date, and we had a 2-3 min convo where I said I was fine, no, I didn’t know when our baby would be born, yes, she is due around and about this kind of time but due windows aren’t exact, no, I had no idea why she hadn’t come yet, but I really didn’t think she cared about arriving on my mum’s schedule, no, we don’t know how exactly we’re going to tell people when I’ve gone into labour/given birth as it depends on the labour - if it’s a long labour my other half will let people know in the family Whatsapp group and then we will both turn our phones off until I’ve given birth; if the labour is moving quickly, he’ll let people know once I’ve given birth. Either way, I will not be on my phone, taking calls or answering messages until I’ve recovered because I’ll have bigger things to focus on. She agreed (way too easily).

She then tried to call me again at 4.50pm. I texted back to say I was in a meeting with builders and other workmen (we are doing a major house reno as well right now 😅) but I asked if everything was ok. She asked me to call her as she wanted to ask me something.

I called her back around 90 mins later when they’d gone. Turns out, she wants to get some new Ugg boots and could I help her order them online. I said I’d need the colour and size and I could get them sent to her. She said she’d try a similar pair on in the shop tomorrow (Saturday) and let me know. Then twenty minutes obligatory spinning out about the neighbour. Also, snuck in a question about ‘how I was feeling’.

Heard nothing on Saturday so, against instinct, I texted her in the evening and asked her if she had the details, because I wanted to get this shit out of the way. Got a text back almost immediately ‘can you call me at home please.’, like she’d been waiting for it.  Cue another 20 minute convo about the boots and neighbour, where I just kept repeating: yes, but what size and colour and I can sort it, and she just kept dodging the question. She finally said black and size 7. Also another question about whether things were happening yet which I ducked. I texted her the price after looking into it and she text back that she’d decide tomorrow (Sunday).

It’s now Sunday, I’m waiting to hear again and I know damn well now that she doesn’t give a shit about buying new Ugg boots. She’s just ensuring she has a reason to talk to me every day so she knows when I’m in labour and can get regular status updates. She’ll actually be congratulating herself on being so sneaky - like, oh desperatedivide has no clue and at least I know she’s ok, I’m her mother, I deserve to be kept in the loop on this. 

No, mum, shit like this is exactly why no-one wants to talk to you. Now everyone is too big to terrify, you’re just left with victimhood and manipulation but you’re really, really bad at it.

Other half reckons I should just ignore calls from now and not give her any headspace until after the birth. If she texts me that she wants the boots, then get them for her but otherwise ignore everything else. I think that’s a wise course of action.

This is literally the tiniest thing. It’s not traumatic or even particularly interesting (congrats if you made it this far down my vent). But I’m unreasonably irate that she’s taken what should be the relaxing end days of my pregnancy and found a way to manipulate contact so she can be kept updated, infect me with her anxiety and I’ve let her. Argh. I’m 42…when will I learn and why do I *still* let her get to me? Even if I would never let her know she has 😂 I know her game and it’s in my power to stop this. I don’t have to be so passive and *let* her do anything to me. 

There’s still a part of me that is feeling guilty - normal women want their mums with them, supporting them through their pregnancy. Normal women don’t try and limit updates to every ten days. Normal women don’t force their mums to manipulate them into talking to them. It’s hard to get out of that mindset and I’m really tired by this point in the pregnancy. It’s hard to know what’s reasonable.

Sorry for the super long essay, I just had to get it off my chest. Then I can go on and enjoy the last few days of just the two of us before we become a little family of three (+2 cats, natch!).

As we age, the natural production of collagen slows down, leading to fine lines, wrinkles, and a loss of skin elasticity. This is where collagen peptides come into play. By incorporating collagen peptides into your skincare routine, you can support your skin's health and maintain that glowing, radiant appearance.

# What Are Collagen Peptides?

Collagen peptides are small chains of amino acids derived from animal collagen. They are broken down into a more easily absorbed form than whole collagen, making them ideal for supporting the skin from the inside out. When consumed, collagen peptides are absorbed into the bloodstream and help boost the body’s collagen production.

# Benefits for Skin Health

1. **Promotes Skin Elasticity**: Collagen peptides help to restore skin elasticity, reducing the appearance of sagging and making the skin appear firmer and more youthful. As collagen production decreases with age, replenishing it with peptides helps maintain skin structure.
2. **Reduces Wrinkles and Fine Lines**: Studies have shown that regular intake of collagen peptides can visibly reduce the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines. By stimulating collagen production, it encourages the skin to rebuild and repair itself, leaving you with a smoother complexion.
3. **Improves Skin Hydration**: Collagen peptides are known to help improve skin hydration levels. Hydrated skin looks plumper and healthier, creating a natural, radiant glow.
4. **Supports Skin Repair**: Collagen plays a key role in the skin's healing process. Whether you're dealing with acne scars, sun damage, or other skin imperfections, collagen peptides can help speed up recovery and promote healthy skin renewal.

# How to Use Collagen Peptides

One of the easiest ways to incorporate collagen peptides into your routine is through supplements. These are available in powder, capsule, or liquid form and can easily be added to your daily diet. You can mix collagen powder into your coffee, smoothies, or even baked goods.

It’s important to note that while collagen peptides can significantly benefit your skin, they work best when combined with a healthy lifestyle. Proper hydration, a balanced diet rich in vitamins and minerals, and regular sun protection all contribute to radiant, glowing skin.

# Why You Should Try Collagen Peptides

Collagen peptides are a simple yet effective addition to your skincare routine that can yield impressive results over time. With consistent use, you’ll notice improvements in skin elasticity, a reduction in wrinkles, and an overall healthier complexion. By nourishing your skin from the inside out, you’re not just treating the surface—you're investing in long-term skin health. If you're looking for a natural way to maintain youthful, glowing skin, collagen peptides could be just the solution you've been searching for.",1,1759055958.0,u_erepresent,0,1.0,False

1nskxfv,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nskxfv/is_buying_a_used_coffee_grinder_a_good_idea/,Is buying a used coffee grinder a good idea?,"Hey coffee enthusiasts! I've been diving deep into the world of coffee grinding lately, and I wanted to share my thoughts on whether buying a used coffee grinder is worth it. After months of research and personal experience, I've got some interesting insights to share.

First off, let me tell you about my journey. I was looking to upgrade my morning coffee game without breaking the bank, and I started browsing through used coffee grinders. While the prices were tempting, I discovered some important things you should consider.

The main issue with used grinders is wear and tear on the burrs. These are the essential parts that actually grind your beans, and worn burrs can seriously affect your coffee quality. They're like the engine of your coffee grinder – once they're worn out, you're basically drinking subpar coffee.

I actually ended up checking out some new grinders (https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder) and found that the price difference wasn't as big as I expected, especially when considering long-term value. The burr quality in new grinders makes a huge difference in grind consistency, which directly affects your brew's taste.

Here's what I learned about used grinders:

- They often have inconsistent grind sizes
- Previous owners might not have maintained them properly
- Hidden damage isn't always visible in photos
- Warranty is usually non-existent
- Cleaning can be a huge hassle

After weighing my options, I decided to go for a new grinder. If you're interested in checking out some reliable options, I found some great deals here: https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder. The peace of mind knowing you're getting fresh, sharp burrs and a full warranty is worth the extra cost.

When it comes to grinding coffee beans, consistency is key. Fresh burrs ensure that your grounds are uniform, which leads to better extraction and ultimately a better-tasting cup of coffee. Whether you're into espresso, pour-over, or French press, having reliable equipment makes a huge difference.

From my experience, investing in a new grinder pays off in the long run. You're not just buying a machine; you're investing in better-tasting coffee every single morning. Plus, you won't have to deal with the headache of replacing parts or troubleshooting issues that often come with used equipment.

What's your take on this? Have you ever bought used coffee equipment? I'd love to hear about your experiences in the comments below.",1,1759055277.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

I just started getting paid in USDC (on Solana) and it’s awesome, but it got me thinking: my employer could technically look up my wallet address and see my entire transaction history. That’s kinda wild when you think about it—like they can track every coffee I buy.

I know Solana isn’t private by default (it’s all public), but are there any tools or strategies people use to add some privacy? Like, can I use a mixer? Or should I use a second wallet to “launder” funds through? Are there any privacy-preserving wallets or dApps on Solana that actually work?

I don’t want to do anything shady—just don’t want my boss knowing how I spend my money or how much I have saved.

Bonus: same question for when I eventually swap to stablecoins or move funds off-chain.

Appreciate any legit (and legal) tips.

1nskts0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1nskts0/am_i_overreacting_for_cutting_off_my_negative/,Am I overreacting for cutting off my negative friend and blocking her everywhere?,"I recently called out and cut off this so-called friend. Blocked her on everything kasi sobra na. Honestly, minsan naiisip ko pa na baka siya yung reason why I need an evil eye charm. 😂

Background: Almost all our mutual friends have fought with her at some point. She’s always negative, and mahilig pang mangtawag ng tanga which honestly, nakakainis at nakaka-hurt din minsan. Her older friend would always say, “Pasensyahan niyo na lang, ganyan na talaga siya.” Tapos in the end, sila pa yung laging nag-aadjust “for the sake of friendship.” For the longest time, I did the same. Pero hello may limit din ako.

The final straw? I posted some solo hiking pics on FB. An hour later, I saw her comment: photo ko na na may pangit na angle.  Wala siyang caption or context  na nilagay YUNG PANGIT NA PHOTO KO LANG!!! Nag panick at nag overthink ako kaya denelete ko na lang agad yung buong post. Yung confidence ko that time lumagapak talaga.

Expected ko naman na may negative siyang sasabihin pero but never in my life did I think na ibabalandra niya ako ng ganun. Like seriously? As someone na hindi naman photogenic na trigger niya lahat ng insecurities ko. Ang dami kong what ifs sa utak “Paano kung may ibang makisali pa at mag-comment ng masama?” Like sa fb world pa talaga na madaming perfectionist. Yung takot at hiya that moment, grabe ba to the point na napaluha na ako.

So I called her out sa GC. Her excuse? “Cute naman yung photo.” 🙄 I told her she’s always unsupportive and full of backhanded compliments. And the kicker? Days before, we were at a coffee shop and she already showed me that exact photo. I told her if she ever posted it, I wouldn’t talk to her. And guess what? She still did.

Was I expecting an apology? Yes. Did I get one? Nope. Instead, nag rebat siya. Told me I could’ve just deleted it, na OA daw ako, and even hinted I was calling her plastic. That was it for me. Blocked for peace of mind.

If that makes me OA, fine. At least my peace is intact.
Life’s too short for toxic friends who mistake rudeness for “personality.”

Pero kumalma na ako at napaisip OA ba ako???HAHHHA",0,1759054902.0,AmIOverreacting,0,0.5,False
