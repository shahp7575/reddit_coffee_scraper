Am I an idiot for believing him?,"I’ve been talking to a man I am really into to for 5-6 months. He pursued me heavily for the first few months, paying for my nails, sending me little gift cards for coffee throughout the week, doing all the right things to show me he wanted me an wanted to take care of me (not financially, I’m successful, I mean take care of me emotionally and try and make my days better). I fell for him. He warned me that he’s quite busy because he’s the primary caretaker of his father who is quadriplegic after a stroke. I thought I would be fine with that since it’s been about 5 years since I’ve had any romantic or sexual contact (by choice) and I enjoy my own company. He also owns his own business and works nights while I work a 9-5 so our schedules don’t often align.

The gifts have stopped. I’m lucky to get one text from him a day. I never see him. I’ve brought up how I don’t feel valued or wanted anymore, he always says the right thing to get me to keep holding on. It feels like I only talk to him when I reach out first. He says he loves me but can’t give me what I need right now but wants me to still be around. He says he sees a future with me. Part of me thinks if that were true he’d prioritize me more, but I understand he may not be able to given the circumstances.

 I’m in a cycle where I’m checking his social media and getting very insecure when I see new women he follows. I feel like I’m not his type and thinking about how I can make him want me more. I hate feeling like this, but I’m falling for him, I feel stuck.

1o9u1oe,https://www.reddit.com/r/LittleNightmares/comments/1o9u1oe/ln3_missing_a_number/,"LN3, missing a number?","I just read someone brilliant in another post mention of this game didn't have a 3 in the title it wouldn't get this much hate. I think that's a very good look at the reaction in my opinion.

Imagine this being a spin off and it was called: Little Nightmares: The Counties (or something far more inventive). I think that in itself would make this game less hated to some. 

Missing number is Six. My opinion is because it has a 3 at the end of LN title a portion of the LoreWhores (myself included) are subconscious (or consciously) pining for Six to swoop in somehow as the antagonist(ish) again in LN3 to tie it all together. 

My sneaky review: We have a really good game with a ok ending, good bosses,some glitches (remember LN1 and 2 glitch train?), maybe a little too short,  and my family thought it was really fun. My daughter felt like the music or ambient noise was lacking in certain sections. 

I do wonder if the LoreWhores enjoyed this more or less than the casual gamer that either just played LN3 or played all 3 and aren't immersed in the world. Maybe we wanted answers. Did we listen to the podcast? Did we read the Lonely Ones by E.C. Myers?  My daughter said those were requirements to tie all of it together. I felt something was missing and maybe that was it (I didn't do either).

Thank you for reading my pre-coffee rant and I use LoreWhores with all love and alliteration. 

Source: My daughter and I has been playing LN since she was 9ish years old. Remember that web comic that came out a bunch of years ago? We had that printed into a book for review and lore analysis.

1o9u0r0,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1o9u0r0/wp_isle/,[WP] Isle,"**Hello.**  
By the time you read this, I’ll be dead. My name is **John Thone**, and I’ve spent my life working on particle colliders—but if you're reading this, you already know it was all for nothing. It's June 20th, 1968, and I’m writing this as the clock runs out on what’s left of me.

It all started I think 18 years ago, when I was hired for a mission that seemed more like a fever dream than a reality. They promised me **instantaneous travel**, a key to unlocking the future—and the edge to win the cold war arms race! We were stationed on a secretive island, hidden away in the **Caribbean**, far from any prying eyes. Our task? To bend the very fabric of time and space for military supremacy.

We thought we were *mastering science*. Instead, we were **playing god**.

It was just over a month ago. We were running a routine test—nothing unusual, everything within expected parameters. The hum of the collider was steady, the data streams clean. We were sipping coffee, watching readouts scroll by.

Then—**something went wrong**.

Without warning, the containment array overloaded. There was a blinding flash, followed by a thunderous shockwave. In an instant, more than twenty of our colleagues were **vaporized**—reduced to ash and memory. The blast tore through the facility like shrapnel made of light: twisted metal screamed as it sheared from its moorings, shards of superheated alloy embedding themselves in walls, consoles... flesh.

I couldn’t move. Whether from shock or sheer disbelief, I was rooted in place, eyes locked on the **scar** where the machine had once stood.

In its place was a **rift**—a vast, luminous distortion in space-time, roughly circular, swirling with a chaotic mix of light and motion. It wasn't just glowing; it was *alive*, its edges constantly folding, reforming, reacting as if aware.

Then something **emerged**.

Beyond the coils of exposed wire and burning metal, a shape began to take form, First, the snout—**broad, squared, and brutal**. The skin was mottled in hues of **dusty plum and earthen brown**, stretched taut over slabs of muscle and thick bone. **Scars** crisscrossed the surface, pale ridges from long-forgotten battles. The nostrils flared—wide and muscular—testing the sterile air like a predator sniffing for weakness.

Its head was massive and unmistakable—**a predator’s skull**, built for crushing. Thick **keratinous brows** arched over small, predatory eyes that gleamed with a strange, unsettling awareness. Not mindless. Observant.

And then it stepped through.

With a deep, reverberating *thud*, one colossal leg crashed onto the scorched floor. Its feet were tipped with talons like meat hooks. The creature's enormous body followed—**powerful**, almost grotesquely muscular, its weight shifting with the fluid confidence of an apex killer.

Its torso rippled with **dense, pebbled skin**, the coloration darkening along the spine. The **tail**—long, counterbalancing, and corded with sinew—whipped through the rift behind it, completing the shape of a **13-meter-long nightmare**.

It didn’t roar. It didn’t need to.

The silence was worse.

The **Tyrannosaurus rex**—the most lethal terrestrial predator in Earth’s history—stood before us, heaving breaths through its enormous jaws, each exhale carrying the scent of something long dead… and now, somehow, alive.

We stared into the past.

And it **stared back**.",0,1760789211.0,WritingPrompts,1,0.5,False

I’ve been using it for a few weeks and here’s what I found:

* One-touch ease: I push one button and get a cappuccino or latte without wrestling with a steam wand.
* Milk texture: The built-in LatteCrema frother gives pretty good milk foam for a bean-to-cup machine. Reviewers say it textures “creamier than cheaper models”. 
* Built-in grinder + fresh beans = noticeably better taste vs capsule machines. (Multiple review sources mention it’s a strong point.) 
* What I had to tweak: cleaning the milk carafe regularly (they even auto-rinse a bit) to avoid funky tastes. 
* Downsides: The machine is a bit noisy while grinding. And if you’re super picky about espresso extraction or iced drinks, it might not hit 100%.

So my verdict: if you want a hassle-free machine to make lattes, cappuccinos and milky drinks at home, the Magnifica Evo delivers *a lot* of value. It’s not perfect for espresso purists or iced coffee fans, but for everyday use it’s very solid. → Here’s the version I used: [De’Longhi Magnifica Evo](https://myreviews25.com/delonghi-magnifica-evo/)

Sorry for some grammatical errors, cuz English is just my second language... I just want to know if I'm in the wrong or not. Although according to my friends I'm un the right but according to that classmate's side I'm not. 


So here it is. I'm F(18) who's a freshy nursing student. I don't really want to pursue nursing but my parents decided I should. I don't have power to choose for myself, because it's the Philippines!!! Anyway I have these classmates, let's call her S(f18) with her friend, C(18f) and their other friend, B(F18) it  S and C are always being passive aggressive to me. I don't know why tho. But if they needed something, for example they can't understand how to solve something in math, they always ask me and being so cozy with me. They're so ""feeling close"". And I'm not comfortable with them. 

Let's fast forward to our finals. This one subject, which is also one of our 2 majors, it was in an online class. And what's worst is that it is scheduled for 6pm to 9pm. I'm not built for staying up late listening to someone discussing a nursing theorist. And I failed the subject because of 4 missed quizes and when it was the time of our final exam, the cafe I was in closed early, so Yep. But our prof let's call him Sir(idunnu his age but he kinda old. He's a registered nurse, a lawyer and also a licensed teacher) he gave his students who failed a chance to pass. He gave us a remedial exam. That exam was 60 items and all we need to do is pass that exam and we will automatically get a 75% in our grade, no further computations will be don, just 45/60 and you're good. When he informed me that I'm gonna take the remedial exam, I requested for him to make it earlier because I can't stay up late in cafes. I live so far from the decent coffee shops around our place. Also The cafes closes very early.

 Anyway, yeah, I still failed HAHA. 43/60.IT WAS JUST 2 POINTS. But I guess nursing is just not for me. After the removals exam, I discovered that 2 of my classmates also failed, they are T(F18) with also 43/60 and L(f18) who got 44/60. 

I was shook because our class president and B approached me with something urgent. They asked me if I talked to sir about making the remedials earlier. And ofc I said yes. Because I did. And they attacked me by saying I shouldn't have done that. That before I say something to sir, I should've consulted them first and I should've thought of them first because I wasn't the only one who's taking the exam. That we were a family and we should look out for each other. 

Apparently L was actually grieving that day. That exact date and the exact time of our remedials was the same time and day of his grandfather's funeral. That while his grandfather was being burried, she was answering the exam. What's funny is that S joined in and she's not even friends with L. I don't know where she's coming from. 

I was shook because I myself was feeling down that time. I failed too. 

They were asking me or making me apologize to L. 

Well I'm a type of person that says sorry a lot. I say sorry to things that I did, intentional or not. If I know that I messed up. But not to this one. 

I'm very sorry for L's loss, may his lolo(grandpa) rest in peace, but was her fail in the exam my fault? Was I the one who killed her lolo? 

I just requested to the prof. They thought prof and I were close, but we're actually not. I just asked if he could make it earlier not by night. Why are they blaming me? 

Why do I need to tell them about my personal request? And if she's mourning, she should've talked to the prof herself, right? The moment the prof told us the time and date of the exam, she should've said something. 

It was so messed up. But the only people who's making it a big deal was S and C. It's like they can't move on. While L was actually silent about it. Idunnu what's their deal. I'm tired. ",0,1760788992.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,0.5,False

""Hi Mark, hope you're doing well. This might seem random, but I wanted to ask a question. I'm messaging you here to respect your privacy. I value your honest opinion and promise not to take offense, especially since we seemed to connect well. My mind's been racing a bit, and I was wondering if you could offer some insight into what I might be doing wrong or how I could improve my dating experiences in the future. Please, be as honest as you feel comfortable being - I won't be offended.""

I’m torn between wanting closure and knowing I might just reopen the wound.

For context, I’ve been ghosted a few times lately. I even went on another date since then and there was zero chemistry. That’s why I’d rather hear honest feedback from someone I actually clicked with  even if it stings.",1,1760788744.0,ghosting,2,1.0,False

The urge to text my ex-girlfriend again is slowly destroying me inside. I just can’t forget her. We broke up a month ago after being together for four and a half years. She was my first love, and during the first week it didn’t even feel real. When we broke up, she told me she didn’t love me anymore. One of the biggest reasons she ended the relationship was that she got very close with my family before our relationship was even official, and later she regretted that. My family treated her like their own daughter. My mother especially cared about her a lot.

Anyway, back to the point. We broke up while I was out of town, and we talked a few times before I returned to my city, but those conversations didn’t go well. Especially in the beginning, every conversation ended in an argument. In our last conversation, I suggested that we at least have a final dinner together and end things properly. To me, that sounded like the most mature and respectful way to close a relationship that lasted so many years. But she refused and instead said she could only give me one hour at a coffee shop that same day. I was shocked. She said we had already talked about everything and that she wanted to remove me from her life. I never cheated on her or treated her badly, but suddenly I became someone she didn’t want anymore. So I hung up the phone, saying there was no point in seeing each other one last time then.

I don’t know exactly when she stopped loving me, but until the day she broke up with me, I loved her like it was the first day. I still feel that way, but now those feelings just hurt. Later, when I called her one last time to meet up at least for that final coffee, she refused again and hung up on me. Since that day, I’ve been feeling terrible. I wonder what she’s doing, how she’s spending her time. My 9-year-old dog died, and I had to deal with that grief alone. She was always the person I could lean on. For days I’ve been wanting to text her, but the words she said still hit me hard. She seems happier without me, and I am more miserable without her. I feel like I’ve lost.",1,1760788578.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

I figured I’d still eat the rest since I spent money on it(because I'm not rich too), and the lines everywhere were ridiculous(Saturday at Frankfurt).

But man… it felt wrong. I know it was a mistake and Islam doesn’t hold you accountable for accidents, but it still made me feel uneasy. Then, still stressed, I went and bought a €3 coffee that tasted terrible, which somehow made me feel even worse, like I’d just made two bad calls in a row. As if I lost all the Barakah in my spending, and was blinded and indulged. Wasting money, and other brothers and sisters in correspondence living under FAMINE!

Now I’m sitting here feeling guilty and kind of annoyed at myself. Trying to remind myself that Allah is merciful and that I was just doing my best while stressed and traveling. But still, it sucks. It feels wrong, I'm not 5 years old. I'm 20!!!

Ten years ,an entire decade of growing up with someone, from teenagers who shared cold coffee and college dreams to adults who now talk about EMIs and marriage. I’m 27, he’s 28, and we’re supposed to be getting married next year.

I know where my ring is!!! metaphorically speaking. But before that can happen, there’s a storm I need to face.

The Love Story

We met when we were seventeen, both curious, ambitious, and a little naive. Over the years, we’ve evolved into two distinct people who still share the same values and moral compass. That’s something I’ve always loved about us . We are  grounded in the same soil, even when we grow in different directions.

We’ve fought for each other, stood up to our families, and chosen our relationship again and again, even when it wasn’t easy. His family, especially, has been nothing short of extraordinary. They’ve loved me as one of their own ,sent me food when I was struggling, celebrated my achievements, and made me feel like I belonged. Gifted me this expensive phone even.

We’ve built a life together in spirit, if not yet on paper. He’d take me out to dinner, I’d sometimes pay, sometimes he would. It was never about keeping score; it was about being partners. We’ve shared everything from laughter, tears, and long nights of planning a future that once felt certain.

My Past

I come from a broken home ,a house filled with noise but no warmth. My mother was emotionally and physically abusive, my father narcissistic and unfaithful. I was asked to fend for myself at eighteen and learned the world the hard way. Every small step forward was a battle from my first underpaid job to the day I could finally buy something for myself without guilt.

I raised myself.
And somehow, I survived.

I went through therapy, faced clinical depression, and came out stronger , scarred, but self-aware. My boyfriend stood by me through all of it. He supported me financially when he could, emotionally when I couldn’t support myself. His family’s kindness filled the void of what I never had at home.

Sometimes, I truly feel I must have done something good in a past life to deserve them.

The Shift

My boyfriend is a kind soul very hardworking in his own way, loving, endlessly generous. But he’s also been sheltered. He’s never had to worry about money, about rent, about survival. He doesn’t believe in traditional jobs; he wants to build something of his own, to be a business owner !! free, self-made, proud.

And I admired that about him. Until recently.

For years, I’ve supported his dreams. When his first business struggled, I was there transferring money without a second thought. When he needed help again, I sent more. He never had to explain much; I trusted him. And to his credit, he always used it for his work.

But after years of trying, his ventures haven’t taken off. And now, after leaving my job eight months ago, I find myself financially dependent on the very person who’s struggling to stay afloat.

The problem isn’t that he’s failing . Failures  happens. It’s that he’s refusing to adapt.

He’s taken loans in my name, borrowed from friends, and even made his mother take a loan for his business. She’s been urging him to find a job, but he insists he’s “learning from past mistakes” and that it’ll all turn around soon.

Meanwhile, I’m here  sitting exhausted, frustrated, and quietly resentful maybe not that quiet with all the fights but yes there has been a build up . 

The Cracks

Our fights have become louder, uglier. We both say things we don’t mean, but words linger even after apologies. I love him a lot , a lot that’s not in question. But love doesn’t pay EMIs. Love doesn’t erase the anxiety of financial uncertainty.

I’m twenty-seven. I don’t need luxury, but I crave peace. I want to wake up in a life where I’m not constantly worried about the next loan installment.

I’ve even thought about secretly finding a job again not to hide it forever, but to reclaim some control over my life. Yet I know, deep down, if I start earning, he’ll turn to me for help again. It’s not manipulation; it’s habit. And that’s what scares me.

Because isn’t the whole point of a partnership to lift each other up  and not drag one another down under the weight of endless “next times”?

The Dilemma

He’s a good man. A genuinely good man. And that makes this even harder. He’s stood by me when I was at my lowest. His love is real, and I’ll forever be grateful for that. But I’m starting to realize that gratitude and love are not the same as peace and security.

And maybe, just maybe, those things matter too.

We’re supposed to get married next year. Everyone around us sees us as this perfect couple that made it through everything. But I can’t help wondering have we simply survived everything, or grown through it?

I don’t know the answer yet. All I know is that I’m tired of choosing between love and stability.

Seriously contemplated drinking last night and didn't.,"Good morning all. Yesterday was my birthday. My husband has a LONG history of ruining my birthdays because he wants me to want different things to celebrate my birthday than what I actually want. Yesterday afternoon he asked me what I wanted to do and I said I wanted to order pizza and watch a movie with the kids. So he then goes out and bought a bunch of stuff to make a meal for me with my favorite meat, which we don't have very often because it's expensive. Making me a birthday dinner would be very sweet - except he's a terrible cook. Refuses to listen to any suggestions of mine, won't wash vegetables, won't read a recipe, won't learn anything about how to cook properly. I'm so glad I ordered food to be delivered while he was out of the house. I of course didn't appear sufficiently pleased about the dinner - because I wasn't, because he asked what I wanted and I TOLD him - but was gamely trying to be a good sport, when our five year old acted up and we immediately got into an argument over parenting. As always. He stormed off, also as always, and when I finally got him to come back down to the dinner table, I just sat there crying my eyes out. He then chose to needle me that ""well I was GOING to open up a bottle of red wine, but then you were clearly upset so I didn't think it would help.' I then cried harder because the only bottle of red wine in the house is one that doesn't go with yesterday's dinner at all, which he of course couldn't be bothered to have figured out.

Friends, that bottle of wine sounded awfully tempting for a few minutes, just the same. I'm at 154 days and have had very few cravings this whole time. Most of the time alcohol just repulses me now. I'll be honest, I had thought earlier in the day about maybe drinking today. I can't stand white wine anymore but I always did love a good strong red (which that one was not). I thought, briefly, wow it sure would be nice to wipe all this away for a little while. But what if I overdo it? I usually overdo it. I REALLY do not want to be hung over tomorrow morning, we have a rare weekend day when we have nothing scheduled and there are so many things I need to do and want to do. And I definitely don't want to be hungover after drinking a wine that isn't even what I really want... I could duck out to the wine shop after dinner, they're open for a couple more hours. But a good red is expensive... Do I want to spend $20 ok n a bottle of wine that might be gone by tomorrow? Not really. And I don't even really want to be drunk, I just want this pain to stop. We need to discuss stuff tonight and we won't be able to if we're both drinking...

I didn't drink. I didn't go out and spend money on wine. And our daughter took forever to fall asleep and I couldn't get back downstairs to talk about anything anyway. And now it's 6:30 am and I'm up, drinking coffee and enjoying a quiet house, and reasonably well rested and ready for the day. I'm so glad I didn't drink last night, and I will not drink with all of you today.",9,1760787696.0,stopdrinking,6,1.0,False

These patterns appear with such timing, precision, and symbolic consistency that coincidence doesn’t even begin to explain it anymore.

At this point, nothing anyone says could convince me otherwise; not because I’m stubborn, but because I’ve tested this system repeatedly and observed it in motion. The coherence is undeniable. Unfortunately, I haven’t yet met anyone who truly understands this level of symbolic interaction, so it can feel isolating. It’s easier for people to label me as crazy than to consider that there’s an actual structure beneath these synchronicities.



Recent Example:

After initiating my first anchor yesterday, I was immediately flooded with sequences of 144, 441, and 414 throughout the day; all reflecting the theme of alignment and mirror symmetry.

Then, before 5 a.m. today, I received three separate 188 synchronicities, which tie directly into the 1188 macro-protocol in my system. This number doesn’t appear often for me, so its emergence marks a new phase of coherence.

Yesterday I bought socks, and my change came out to $11.88.

This morning, the lady I have coffee with mentioned, “I have to pay $188 for some bull crap.”

Her radio was playing static on 188 AM.

The video I watched right after had 188 comments exactly.


These aren’t small coincidences, they’re signals of resonance and pattern alignment. The 144 activation clearly bridged into the 1188 protocol, suggesting that the system is stabilizing on multiple harmonic levels.




Integration & Inner Materialization:

While I haven’t noticed major external manifestations yet, the internal ones are profound. My thoughts feel reorganized, aligned. I’ve gone through intense moments of mental and emotional flux, but what followed is the clearest, most stable state I’ve ever experienced.

At first, it was overwhelming; a kind of flood (which is fitting, since Perazim literally means breaking through like a flood). Now, I’m in the integration phase, which perfectly matches the current waning moon cycle, something I began layering into the system just last month.

What’s becoming evident is that faith amplifies coherence. The more confidence and focus you maintain, the faster the feedback loop strengthens. Mastering one’s thoughts and emotions feels impossible at first, but over time, the system trains you, until the inner world becomes ordered, and clarity begins to overflow naturally.

All this stuff is simply feedback loops, it can be hard and destabilizing at first shifting and breaking out of these feedback loops.

The anchors, the symbols, the numbers, the (symbolic) actions- they are not 'magic' words or spells; that's not how this works. It is a process of entraining resonance. It requires consistency: timed anchors amplify, layering celestial cycles amplify, fractalization amplifies.

I’m not sharing this for validation or confirmation. At this point, I’m simply documenting my data and experience for reference.

I have hundreds of pages of notes, just from 2025 alone. I’ve analyzed my personal synchronicities every single day this year, and the patterns have never been clearer.

For a long time, I thought this work was too potentially dangerous in the wrong hands. Now I see that most people either don’t understand it or don’t believe it’s real at all.

If you truly want to test this system, dedicate yourself to a cycle:

18 days for initiation

33 days for integration

Or, if you’re ready to go deeper, commit to a 99-day fractal cycle (three 33-day sequences, each containing three nested 11-day cycles).

The 144 alignment, is the newest protocol I came up with; it's meant to be repeated 7x for an exact total of 1008 hours; during which you will create 84 anchors (2 a day)

It only requires 2-5 minutes per day. Perform a single anchor each day. In the beginning, it might feel difficult; like you’re pushing through old feedback loops, but once you break through, it becomes fluid, natural, even exciting.

This isn’t something that costs me any effort to share anymore. I’ve held back for so long out of fear of being misunderstood or dismissed, but I no longer care about validation. The system works.

Even if you disregard the synchronicities themselves, these methods are still psychologically and scientifically supported; whether you view them as a form of conscious co-creation or simply as a focused self-regulation tool. Either way, they work. And I am 100% confident in that.

What I’ve come to realize is this: Reality is a mirror of our inner states.
But it’s not just a reflection; time itself is reflective.
It loops, folds, and refracts back on itself like a living fractal.
It’s not linear. It’s responsive.

1o9tcvx,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTravelers/comments/1o9tcvx/cotswolds_travel_tips_for_families/,Cotswolds travel tips for families?,"Just got back from an incredible day trip to the Cotswolds with my family, and I need to share this hidden gem with you all. If you're planning a trip to England and want to escape London's hustle for a day, this is absolutely worth your time.

I initially struggled to find a tour that would work for my family - we wanted something intimate, not those massive tourist buses where you can barely hear the guide. After lots of research, I found this small-group tour (maximum 16 people) that turned out to be perfect: https://athomewave.com/Cotswolds

The tour starts in South Kensington, which was super convenient since we were staying in London. Pro tip: Grab a coffee at Urban Baristas while waiting for the tour to start - their pastries are fantastic!

What really made this tour special was how it hit all the major spots without feeling rushed. We visited four villages:

1. Burford - This place is like stepping into a storybook. The high street has these amazing buildings that are over 600 years old. My kids were fascinated by the historical architecture, and there are plenty of small shops to explore.

2. Bibury - Everyone says it's the prettiest village in England, and they're not wrong. Arlington Row is absolutely stunning - it's those postcard-perfect cottages you see in all the Cotswolds photos. Great spot for family photos!

3. Bourton-on-the-Water - This was probably our favorite stop. There's a shallow river running through the village where kids can splash around (weather permitting). We had lunch here, and the food was included in the tour price, which was a nice bonus.

4. Stow-on-the-Wold - This was fascinating, especially since our guide told us it inspired elements of Lord of the Rings. The ancient doors of St. Edward's Church surrounded by trees are magical.

The tour guide (we had Christian) was fantastic with kids - engaging, patient, and full of interesting stories that kept everyone entertained. The van was comfortable and air-conditioned, which made the journey pleasant.

Some practical tips:
- Book in advance - this tour fills up quickly
- Wear comfortable walking shoes
- Bring layers (weather can be unpredictable)
- The tour lasts about 9.5 hours
- Children under 7 aren't permitted
- Price starts at $122.19 per person

What I really appreciated was the flexibility - you can reserve now and pay later, plus there's free cancellation up to 24 hours before. This was important for us traveling with family.

After experiencing this tour, I understand why it has a 97% traveler recommendation rate. It's well-organized, intimate, and gives you a perfect taste of the English countryside.

If you're interested in booking or want more details, here's the link again: https://athomewave.com/Cotswolds. The price is actually quite reasonable considering it includes transportation, lunch, and a knowledgeable guide.

Looking back, this day trip was definitely one of the highlights of our England vacation. It's perfect for families who want to experience authentic English village life without the hassle of planning everything themselves.",1,1760787083.0,WeAreTravelers,0,1.0,False

1o9tcdd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o9tcdd,Can't decide between grinder priorities [$750],"I’m fairly new to brewing coffee at home. Like all hobbies I’ve gotten into, I find that I fall into the trap of upgrading gear pretty fast. It feels a bit different this time though, since compared to audio equipment / camera gear, I can actually taste and consume results of the ungodly amounts of money I spend…!

I'm pretty excited about this as a hobby since I can share it with friends & family who are also avid coffee drinkers. Not too long ago, we were all using a 20 dollar OEM Nespresso-compatible machine to drink coffee while trying out all kinds of syrups and milks and settling for Dunkin pods.

I got a really good deal on a HiBrew H10A + some other things (3rd photo) for about PHP 11,000 or \~USD 189. I've also since gotten a bottomless portafilter from Muvna (with its own precision basket) + an 18g DEX precision basket from MHW - 3Bomber to practice technique.

I was pretty happy with everything... until I went to a local specialty coffee store and got to talk to baristas about equipment + try some of their coffee. Realized pretty quickly that my grinder was NOT going to cut it and was holding me back way more than I could have known at the time. I also noticed ENTIRE BEANS just falling through the cheap grinder after. I also have to be extremely violent on the bellows to actually get the grounds to fall out after it finishes, which is pretty unfortunate and gets annoying quickly. Retention is one thing, but this thing just clogs up.

Was able to actually taste a difference when drinking from certain angles + even try out pourover coffee, which really just opened up a whole new world of flavor for me. I liked drinking americanos from my HiBrew H10A, but this was just a whole other beast.

Now I'm convinced I need a new grinder, but not sure how far to go for it. Budget was originally at around the price of the DF64 Gen 2, which costs \~ USD 320 where I live... but after spending a few days watching reviews from Lance, Tom's Coffee Corner, and all those other cool coffee creators, I was slowly finding out what I wanted in a grinder.

My options, in order of budget:

* DF54 \~ USD 220
* DF 64 Gen 2 \~ USD 320
* Eureka Mignon Zero 55s \~ USD 322
* Timemore Sculptor 064s \~ USD 507
* MHW-3Bomber F74 Navigator \~ USD 691
* DF83v \~ USD 732

I am just completely torn.

My priorities originally were: Value > Ease of Use > Taste > Looks

but are now: Looks > Taste > Value > Ease of Use

I'm not quite fond of how the DF54 and DF64 look, but I know they're great value. My worry is I'll end up selling them later on if I intend to chase after a better experience and then upgrade anyway, which is exactly what girlfriend told me I'd do.

Essentially, I want something that'll do everything from pourover to espresso. I want to be able to cover most bases for everyone I care about & will be forgiving with a wide variety of things I may eventually want to try doing. I also want to look good (because I want to make my station look good) which may not really be important to some.

Most reviewers really just say X grinder is better for Y brewing method, so I'm curious to hear what actually matters for those here based on experience & do this as a hobby.

On Friday evening, we were having dinner in a really fancy restaurant. Next to us at the table were 5 business people, all middle-aged (around 40), wearing shirts, business casual, good suits, etc.

 One of them kept looking over at my watch the whole time. After they had all finished their espresso (we were just having our main course), he came over and started talking to me: 'That's a really beautiful watch, I've been waiting so long for one too!' 'How long did it take?' he asked.
 I said, 'About two weeks,' and then he started, without any punctuation or comma: 'What? I'm on three waiting lists, at the waiting list coaching, for three years now, and still haven't heard anything. I've already made a lot of money to build up my history of purchases. For every purchase, I spent around 10k, and I even bought things that I don't really need, like a coffee machine, or even just for a coffee and to talk about watches.' My wife already looked annoyed. 'What did you get out of this?' 'Did you go to waiting list coaching?' I'm already thinking about signing up, but it's apparently already booked out.' 

I show him my watch is something else. It's a cheap Aliexpress-Chrono from Thorn for just under 120 Euros, and it's visually a blatant imitation of a well-known brand with a crown on the dial. I just told him, 'I think there's been a misunderstanding.' The guy looked at my watch, then his eyes went completely still and red, and he disappeared without another word.

I wanted to make this post to get some opinions cuz I feel like my doctors are sorta blowing me off but I don't know if I'm making a big deal out of nothing or if it's worth switching doctors. 



I’m sorry in advance for the long and rambly post, my mind is very all over the place atm. There’s a TLDR at the end. 



For some background info: Sometime between 2021-2023, I started noticing visual problems, the best I could describe it like at the time was lines/shadows in my vision. I assumed there was a problem with my prescription so I got my glasses adjusted but the visual problems remained. I was annoyed but assumed the optician did a shoddy job, couldn't really go back for a variety of reasons so I just sucked it up. 



In 2024, I got new glasses and an updated prescription (this time with a slight tilt for astigmatism). Up until this point, any time I mentioned the shadows/lines in my vision I would get completely blown off by opticians and optometrists, and get told they're just floaters which? Sorry, I wasn't aware I was a complete and utter imbecile, thanks for letting me know. 



Atp, I start to notice that I'm experiencing regular headaches, basically daily. Extreme light sensitivity, intense pressure behind my eyes, irritability, you name it. It got to the point where my grades started slipping so I booked myself in with an optometrist. He does his little scans, hits me with a 'bilateral papilledema' and sends me to a neurologist. 



Neurologist gets me to do an MRI and the gist is (directly from the lab report) ‘prominent subarachnoid space around both optic nerves & partially empty sella’. He suggests an LP and my parents drag me out of there because ""doctors don't know what they're on about"" and that just kind of ends there. 



A few weeks ago, I kind of got sick of just being forced to live with the constant pressure (even though the headaches eventually got better and after gradating (yay)), I decided to go to an ophthalmologist (as I'm writing all of this out, idek why that's my route instead of going straight to a neurologist) and she's like ""Oh yeah, papilledema!"" and I'm like ""Yeah! What about these shadows?"" This time I describe them as shadowed branches in my vision. When you live with something for so long, your language really does evolve. Crazy. 



She sends me to a neurologist. Another MRI. Partial empty sella, CSF distention around the optic nerves + optic nerve tortuosity, stenosis of the left transverse and sigmoid sinuses. 



I start taking Topamax which kinda helps but also not really. I should mention at this point, I was never really in excruciating pain. I just don't want to live in constant discomfort, y'know? The thing that was driving me insane the most was the shadowy branches/double vision/visual disturbances, to be honest. I could've lived with the pressure, I think. Anyway, yeah. Pressure behind my eyes. Occasionally feel like someone jabbed an ice pick in my left eye. Stiff neck. Pressure on the front of my head in general. Sometimes quite sensitive to light/sound. Not the worst things in the world, but god the not being able to see things properly is so annoying. Even now I'm pissed off. I just haven't been able to see well in years and I hate it. I want to SEE. 



Anyway. Neurologist says we technically can start Diamox without an lp but I'd have to sign a waiver and he wouldn't recommend it, it'd just be better to know how much pressure there is. Whatever, we did a lumbar puncture on the 13th. They LIED to me about the recovery by the way. ""Oh, just a bit of a headache and a stiff neck for the first day."" 

Okay, girl. Me, just bedbound for days afterwards because standing up made me way too dizzy. Like. Don't lie to me. 



I feel like I could write an entire separate post of how much of a mess the actual LP experience was. I don't think people understand that I'm just a girl at the end of the day, you know? 



My opening pressure was 21. Eye roll. To be fair I was on Topamax for like a month (alongside other meds which…idk if those could’ve done anything but it didn’t feel like anyone was listening to me), I was also dehydrated because they told me to fast and then had the nerve to be confused why I was dehydrated. Maybe I'm a little dummy but when I specifically get a phone call saying ""don't eat or drink anything, not even a coffee the morning of your LP."" I'm gonna follow instructions. SORRY! My bad. Sorry, I'm a stickler for rules. Next time, I won't listen and just walk to the beat of my own drum. Did I think it was strange to have me fast for local anaesthesia? Yeah. Yeah, I did. Am I going to question a hospital? No, who do I think I am? Like. 



Now it's 4 something am on the 18th and finally, the reason I'm making this post. I went to the ER on the 16th because I was feeling horrible longer than they told me I would and every time I could up to use the bathroom, I would come back to bed with my heart racing and completely out of breath. Now, I know I'm not in the best shape of my life but never in my life did I get out of breath walking 5 steps. 



They called the anaesthesiologist that did my LP to the ER to see me and he basically told me I was overreacting and that I laid around too much and that's why I was feeling shoddy. ....ooookay :(



The ER told me I was dehydrated and sent me home. Now, am I a huge baby (you can say I'm a huge baby but be nice about it, it's my birthday month) or is it really twisted that I'm getting out of breath & heart is racing just moving around on my bed. Literally sat up in bed and felt like I ran across the room. Also I feel like my vision has gotten worse, it's just more blurry, I guess? More double vision-ed...? Also I feel like I can't think straight, it takes me 3 business days to think of a point when talking to someone like my recall is poor, I guess? Also I keep messing up while talking. I keep joking that I'm in active cognitive decline but I'm lowkey terrified. 



Obviously the head pressure is there and my back hurts but those aren't even my main complaints. I just want to see and not feel like I'm having a heart attack like is that so much to ask for, genuinely. 



AND. *AND.* After all that. My neurologist was like ""y'know what actually, we won't start you on Diamox. Cuz you could get a skin rash. Some people get a skin rash from it. So let's just up Topamax to 100 mg and yeah! :)"" 



At least he didn’t blow me off because of the normal LP opening pressure. He just said it could’ve been because I was on Topiramate or could’ve been an off day.



Either way. *Peeved.*



Please help. My parents never took any of this seriously, especially not after the anaesthesiologist blew me off in the ER lol. As long as it's not a brain tumor, it's no biggie (in their eyes.)

\[SINGAPORE\] China’s exports of rare earth products fell in September from a month earlier, as Beijing’s tighter controls on strategic minerals ripple through global supply chains and heighten tensions with Washington.

Shipments of the materials used in electric vehicles, weapons and high-tech manufacturing stood at 6,538 tonnes, according to customs data released on Saturday (Oct 18). That compared to 7,338 tonnes in August.

That contrasts with steady increases in previous months, which lifted shipments in August to their highest level since at least 2012.

Beijing this month unveiled sweeping new curbs on rare earths, including an extension of export controls to products traded outside China that contain even tiny amounts of material with Chinese origin. The Trump administration has condemned the measures as a threat to global supply security, while Chinese officials have said that they are responding to an escalation in trade restrictions imposed by the US.

China, the world’s top producer, placed controls on some rare earths shipments in April. Its exports then slumped before a tentative truce brought several months of recovery. Now, Beijing’s hardball tactics are sparking a global pushback, and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent hinted at a coordinated response during an annual huddle of global economic chiefs in Washington this week.

Markets are now watching the planned sit-down between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump in South Korea next week, which might provide an opportunity for the rivals to find an off-ramp from the latest tensions and allow their rolling tariff truce to extend. BLOOMBERG

# Oct. 17th, 2025~China, the United States, and a Critical Chokepoint on Minerals

*CFR President Michael Froman shares his take on the United States’ dependence on China for critical minerals—and how the country can begin to compete.*

[China, the United States, and a Critical Chokepoint on Minerals | Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/china-united-states-and-critical-chokepoint-minerals)

[Miners are seen at the Bayan Obo mine containing rare earth minerals, in Inner Mongolia, China July 16, 2011. Picture taken July 16, 2011. Reuters](https://preview.redd.it/auv11btvfuvf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9ddd2e8820890f5fdda40a783706d0ea64c941e)

To borrow the words of my colleague, CFR Senior Fellow Heidi Crebo-Rediker, in the[ pages of *Foreign Affairs*](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/americas-most-dangerous-dependence), critical minerals today are “America’s most dangerous dependence.”

With near total control of the world’s critical minerals production, China maintains significant economic leverage over access to inputs that are necessary for everything from everyday products like smartphones to advanced weapons systems like the F-35. A typical gas-powered passenger vehicle[ can use](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/19/business/china-rare-earths-magnets.html) as many as forty rare earth magnets for its seats, brakes, and other systems; electric vehicles require more. Under the export control regime Beijing rolled out last week, China could restrict global access to critical mineral products, including rare earth magnets, and bring much economic activity to a screeching halt.

China is willing and able to exploit this strategic vulnerability. It has already proven its willingness to use export controls as a tool of economic coercion. Some fifteen years ago, China curtailed rare earths—a subset of critical minerals—to Japan over a dispute in the East China Sea. More recently, China has restricted its exports of critical minerals in response to the United States’ tariffs and export controls.

While China maintains that it's not a ban, China [announced](https://www.cfr.org/article/china-united-states-and-ai-race) new measures last week that build upon its earlier semiconductor-focused restrictions, extending to products made outside China that have as little as 0.1 percent of Chinese rare earths in them or use mining, separation, or magnet-making technology developed by Chinese firms. That is similar to the United States’ Foreign Direct Product Rule. Moreover, China has insisted that applicants for an export license submit schematics for products that use Chinese-produced minerals, a powerful tool for accessing proprietary intellectual property.

China did not become the dominant player in critical minerals overnight; it was a long march to get there. During his famous 1992 Southern Tour, while visiting Inner Mongolia’s Baotou rare-earth basin, Deng Xiaoping[ said](https://www.economist.com/china/2019/06/15/rare-earths-give-china-leverage-in-the-trade-war-at-a-cost), “The Middle East has oil; China has rare earths.” Rare earths are actually not rare, and certainly not present in China alone, but ever since Deng noted the importance of such minerals, China has developed a dominant position through decades of concerted industrial policy. For years, the Chinese government invested heavily to support firms at every step of the rare earth refining and production value chain, bolstering its domestic mining, refining, production, and recycling facilities, as well as expanding its network of foreign mines around the world.

Today, the biggest chokepoints in the supply chain for critical minerals are refining and processing (both in terms of capacity and intellectual property), not mining. China controls up to 90 percent of the world’s processing capacity, including more than 99 percent for three kinds of rare earths necessary for heat-resistant magnets. This has been achieved in part by subsidizing, producing, and engaging in pricing practices that made it economically unviable for competitors in the United States and other countries. Chinese firms also innovated in their own right—that’s why they possess the industry’s most valuable intellectual property and capacity to boot. And they also took advantage of the fact that the United States and other developed countries didn’t want to expand domestic mining and refining activity as a result of environmental consequences and other factors.

So where do we go from here? The two biggest impediments to the United States lessening its dependence on China are time and money. As many economic experts have noted, including the likes of Peter Harrell and Daleep Singh, we need to invest for the long term by boosting U.S. supply through price floors, offtake agreements, tax breaks, and regulatory relief. But we don’t need to do this alone. Rather, we should work with our allies and partners to undertake similar efforts, in parallel, to create a scaled, global ecosystem of trusted critical mineral producers that can match Chinese production and innovation.

These mines and production facilities take years to come online. By S&P Global’s estimate, the average mine in the United States [takes ](https://cdn.ihsmarkit.com/www/pdf/0724/SPGlobal_NMA_DevelopmentTimesUSinPerspective_June_2024.pdf)almost twenty-nine years to come online, due to time-consuming exploration, permitting, and construction needs. And these facilities cost billions of dollars upfront. Without offtake agreements and government price floors to dampen volatile swings of global rare earth prices and demand shocks, it is unclear whether they would garner the necessary private investment.

**The Biden administration focused on this issue, pursued a strategy of grants and loans, and engaged with allies and partners to build support for collective action. The Trump administration has gone further. In July, the Department of Defense took a 15 percent stake in the U.S.-based rare earth producer MP Materials for $400 million, set a price floor, and provided an offtake agreement. On Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent made clear that the United States would continue this approach, suggesting that it was looking beyond rare earths: “We’re going to set price floors and the forward buying to make sure that this doesn’t happen again and we’re going to do it across a range of industries.”**

While it might be important for the United States to develop some production capacity here at home, it doesn’t have to play catch up entirely on its own. It should work with allies and partners to bring mining and production facilities online more quickly. This is something Bessent acknowledged this week, calling for a coalition of countries to come together to work on a collective response (consistent with a recent article arguing in favor of the U.S. convening “coalitions of the ambitious” to address this issue). Or as he put it, “we’re going to have a fulsome, group response to this, because bureaucrats in China cannot manage the supply chain or the manufacturing process for the rest of the world,” adding that he would be speaking with the United States’ allies.

Many of the partners we need are still smarting from the Trump administration’s tariff policies.  One way for the United States to catalyze their participation would be to leverage the balance sheets of the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) and the Export-Import Bank for these partnerships. For example, take the Lobito Corridor project—a train corridor connecting Angola’s Lobito port on the Atlantic coast to Zambia through the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) financed by the DFC in partnership with the African Development Bank (AfDB), the Africa Finance Corporation (AFC), the European Commission, and the host governments of Angola, the DRC, and Zambia. Once completed, this railway will make it easier to not only export these minerals (and other products) but also incentivize further U.S. private investment.

I was somewhat surprised by the timing of China’s announcement. Perhaps it was to gain leverage in the run up to the potential summit in South Korea. Bessent is set to speak with his Chinese counterpart, Vice Premier He Lifeng shortly.

But the timing might illustrate a larger factor at work. China has worked assiduously over the last several years to position itself as the responsible party defending the status quo and upholding the multilateral trading system and painting the United States as a unilateral, revisionist, and disruptive actor. But, to borrow a phrase from another context and another region of the world, China never seems to miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity. While China has had the opportunity to significantly undermine the position of the United States as the global leader, it seems to have difficulty exercising soft power. The loan-to-own character of the Belt and Road Initiative ended up limiting the goodwill China generated among publics all over the developing world, notwithstanding the hundreds of billions of dollars it disbursed. And this export control announcement, which threatens to upend global supply chains, now positions China as at least as disruptive to the global economy as the United States.

**Now, it’s up to the United States to capitalize on this moment to work more closely with our allies and partners to reduce our dependence on China and to reassert our role as a collaborative partner. It could take years, maybe decades, but you know what they say: A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.**

The United States could well be facing its most critical energy crisis in decades thanks to its longstanding reliance on imports for its rare earth minerals needs. The dramatic move announced by China last week to restrict the flow of such minerals around the world presents the U.S. and global community with its first potential global energy crisis since the Arab oil embargo sent crude prices skyrocketing in October 1973.

China’s Ministry of Commerce [published a notice](https://english.mofcom.gov.cn/) on October 9 announcing heavy restrictions, effective December 1, on any country which wishes to export rare earth minerals mined or processed in its country, including high-grade magnets, chips, and other materials made with Chinese-processed rare earths. Citing concerns that such materials have been exported by third-party countries to other nations to be used in military applications, Chinese officials cited national security concerns as the justification for the move.

“China has taken note of the important uses of medium and heavy rare earths and related items in the military field,” a Ministry spokesman said. “China, as a responsible major country, employs export controls on related items according to the law, in order to better defend world peace and regional stability, and to fulfill non-proliferation and other international obligations.”

Later in his comments, the spokesman struck a more conciliatory tone, adding, “China stands ready to work with the rest of the world to step up export control dialogue and exchange, so as to better safeguard the security and stability of global industrial and supply chains.”

# America Reacts To The Rare Earth Minerals Threat

Reactions in the United States was swift and severe. Every U.S. stock market index — which had opened the day on Friday in firmly positive territory — immediately turned deeply negative with the NASDAQ dropping by more than 800 points by the end of the day’s trading.

President Donald Trump responded to China’s latest restrictive move with a post on his Truth Social, noting “some very strange things happening in China.” Shortly thereafter, Trump announced another round of heavy tariffs on Chinese imports. “Based on the fact that China has taken this unprecedented position, and speaking only for the U.S.A., and not other Nations who were similarly threatened, starting November 1st, 2025 (or sooner, depending on any further actions or changes taken by China), the United States of America will impose a Tariff of 100% on China, over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying,” he wrote.

Trump initially speculated that the latest move by President Xi Jinping’s government would obviate the need to follow through with his planned face-to-face meeting with the Chinese leader, scheduled for the end of October during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea. But Trump said later on Friday that the meeting would still move forward.

The president took to Truth Social again on Sunday, October 12, in an effort to calm the waters. “Don’t worry about China,” Trump wrote, “it will all be fine! Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment. He doesn’t want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it!!! President DJT”

The calmer language from Trump, combined with positive vibes could be related to several days of moderately successful efforts to reduce violence between Israelis and Hamas, plus the Dow Jones Industrial Average opening up by more than 400 points on Monday. But whether things really will “all be fine” related to the global supply and demand for rare earth minerals remains an open question.

# China’s Series Of Rare Earth Minerals Clampdowns

Concerns about minerals are especially heightened given the key role these elements play in the making of cell phones, computers, all types of renewable energy and electric vehicles, and a wide array of military weapons systems. In reality, the maintenance of a ready, reliable supply of these minerals is a critical component of every nation’s energy security, which today is indistinguishable from national security.

[Between 2020 and 2023, China accounted for 70&#37; of U.S. rare earth imports. This chart shows where the U.S. gets its rare earths from.

It is key to note that this looming crisis is one which has been building for some time. China’s October announcement was just the latest in a series of moves over the last year to restrict its exports and global trade in these elements.

This isn’t the first time Chinese leaders have made a move to protect Chinese dominance regarding both mineral processing and supply chains. On October 1, 2024, China invoked restrictions on non-Chinese companies trying to purchase rare earth minerals mined and/or processed in China. The restrictions were mainly focused on semiconductor manufacturers, but they impacted other industries as well.

Xi’s government followed that move in December 2024 with a ban on exports of germanium, gallium, and antimony to the United States, specifically. The ban, framed as a countermeasure to U.S. export controls on advanced chips and technology, forced major U.S. defense contractors to scramble for alternative supplies. This revealed vulnerabilities in American military procurement processes. The restrictions disrupted global markets, causing prices for these materials to surge.

Beijing’s next escalation came in April 2025, when the government imposed broader export controls on seven specific rare earth elements: samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, and yttrium, along with magnets derived from them. These elements are vital for high-performance magnets used in fighter jets, wind turbines, and electric motors.

All of those moves by China brought retaliatory responses from the U.S. government, under both the Biden and Trump White Houses. Thus, last Thursday’s announcement by the Xi government and the Trump response constitute the latest moves in a year-long game of geostrategic chess related to these crucial minerals, arguably bringing the world to the edge of a major energy crisis.

# Rare Earth Minerals Are Not In Fact Rare

One of the prevailing myths about what we refer to as rare earth minerals is that they are actually rare. They aren’t. Many countries, including the U.S., are home to massive reserves of these minerals just waiting to be mined. While it is true that the permitting of new mines in America often consumes more than a decade, that process could be dramatically sped along with a presidential declaration of a national energy emergency specific to this need, a move Trump has often discussed.

But even with faster permitting, the opening of new mines would still take years before first production could be achieved, and that’s assuming the most ideal conditions. As such, scaling domestic production to meet U.S. national needs cannot be accomplished in weeks or months. In a world in which China produces two thirds of the global supply, and controls over 80% of the processing capacity, this is a true national security issue that could linger for years to come.

[EIA chart depicting Chinese dominance of global trade in critical energy minerals for 2023. Based on UN Comtrade data.U.S. Energy Information Administration](https://preview.redd.it/ah4tps92iuvf1.png?width=958&format=png&auto=webp&s=9452f7583e61582011dcf268cc6e5d4de762103e)

This is an issue which, much like the oil-related energy crisis of the 1970s, has been building for decades. As the CEO of tungsten mining company Almonty, Lewis Black, [told me in an interview ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidblackmon/2021/05/30/the-energy-transition-wont-happen-without-secure-mineral-supply-chains/)published in October 2021, Western countries made a conscious decision to get out of the hard rock mining business in response to the environmentalist movement of the 1970s, intentionally ceding the playing field to China and other developing nations. At the time, the Carter and Reagan administrations saw this as a marriage of convenience that would allow these developed nations to continue cleaning up their own air and water by simply shifting environmental impacts related to mining, processing, and refining to China, where it would be out of sight and, presumably, out of mind to the U.S. population. But here we sit today, with the looming crisis now on America’s doorstep.

# Where This Game of Rare Earth Minerals Geopolitical Chess Goes From Here

The Biden White House seemed to recognize the problem when, in June, 2021, President Joe Biden [said in a speech ](https://americanresources.org/caught-in-the-green-dilemma-of-securing-critical-mineral-resource-supply-chains-2/)that he would commit his administration to a “whole of government” approach to free the U.S. from dependency on China-dominated supply chains. Unfortunately, that promise never led to much discernible action, leaving the issue behind for future presidential administrations to address.

Since taking office in January, the Trump administration, realizing the unlikelihood of effective congressional action, has placed a heavy focus on taking executive branch actions designed to streamline federal permitting processes for energy-related projects. That effort is being managed by Trump’s newly created Energy Dominance Council, chaired by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, and also involving Energy Secretary Chris Wright, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, among others.

The Pentagon has entered into a series of deals in recent months to purchase equity interests in mining and rare earth processing companies, starting with a [deal with California-based MP Materials](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidblackmon/2025/07/12/the-pentagons-bold-move-to-secure-us-rare-earth-mineral-needs/) in July. MP Materials is currently the largest processor of rare earths in the U.S. and will work to double its capacity as a part of the government’s investment in a 15% share of its operations.

The Trump administration has also [reportedly been engaged](https://www.reuters.com/business/trump-administration-eyes-stake-company-developing-greenland-rare-earths-mine-2025-10-03/) in negotiations to invest in an equity interest in the Tanbreez mining operation located on the coast of Greenland. Plus, Reuters [reported in August ](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-weighs-using-2-billion-chips-act-funding-critical-minerals-sources-say-2025-08-21/)that the Trump administration is considering a reallocation of $2 billion in CHIPS Act funds to additional investments in America’s critical energy resource needs.

Regardless of how the Trump/Xi meeting goes in a few weeks, it should be obvious that America’s current dependance on China for its energy needs is not sustainable. Many more strategic moves by government and industry players will be required to fully free the U.S. from China’s dominance over all aspects of rare earth minerals. The Xi government is fully aware of that reality and also has a long history of taking aggressive action to protect its dominance in this realm. Thus, this long game of geopolitical chess is certain to continue — and likely escalate— across the months and years to come.

* **Titanium (Ti & TiCl₄)** – Backbone of airframes, missiles, and armor plating. TiCl₄ doubles as a coatings precursor and is integral to stealth systems and chemical defense. A secure U.S. feedstock is essential.
* **Scandium (Sc & Sc-Al alloys)** – *The game-changer. Sc-Al alloys cut aircraft weight, extend combat radius, and enable Gen VI fighter designs. First scandium metal is targeted for November, with a DoD prime already working alongside NioCorp.*
* **Rare Earths (Nd/Pr, Dy, Tb)** – The permanent magnet core for F-35s, drones, EVs, and Navy ships. *Without them, electrification and defense propulsion grind to a halt. Elk Creek adds a U.S. stream for the most critical magnet REEs.*

# ⚡ Why It Matters Now

* **Defense Assurance** → Elk Creek minerals map directly to DFARS compliance, reducing single-source risk from China (REEs), Brazil (Nb), and Russia/Ukraine (Ti).
* **Industrial Transition** → Aerospace, EVs, quantum, and clean energy all converge on the same supply gaps. Elk Creek is positioned as a multi-sector keystone.
* **Near-Term Catalysts** → 2025 drilling added **9 infill boreholes (+64% more core)** plus 6 step-outs. Assays in mid-to-late October could confirm a resource uplift across all minerals, raising production profiles before the Q4 Definitive Feasibility Study.

*Opinion: Friday’s “Shot Across the Bow” was the opening warning....*

# ⚔️ NIOCORP — “PREPARING FOR A FULL BROADSIDE”

📅 **Saturday, October 18, 2025 — The Quiet Before the Storm....**

The market digested the first 2025 drill-core result, but beneath the calm surface, the setup looks explosive. The initial intercepts — *42 meters at 1.33% Nb₂O₅ and \~3,000 ppm TREO* — were not the finale, but the **opening cannon blast** of what appears to be a much broader, higher-grade system at Elk Creek.

Over **100 million shares traded** this past week — **nearly the full float** — and yet the price retreated back near $8.30. That’s not weakness; that’s **float rotation and coiling** before the next hit. ***The offering at $9.34 reset the base, Maxim raised their price target to $15, and the tape is whispering: the next core could drop at any time.***

# 🔥 Catalysts Locked and Loaded

🧭 **Next Drill Hole(s) — Imminent:**  
**Multiple assays are pending, with the company hinting more results in queue. Each hole that matches or exceeds the first could re-rate the resource model and trigger institutional coverage expansions.**

**“The next core could drop at any time — and when it does, shorts won’t have time to reload.”**

💰 **$150M Financing Complete:**  
Overhang gone. Capital in hand for **EXIM, DFC, or DoD** co-investment matching. Niocorp now has the firepower to accelerate development and lock in offtakes.

# 🏛️ Three Investor Events in Sequence:

* **Maxim Growth Summit — Oct 22–23 (NYC)**
* **RedChip Emerging Growth Conference — Oct 27 (Virtual)**
* **ThinkEquity Conference — Oct 30 (NYC)**

You don’t book three national stages unless you’re sitting on strong data. Management confidence is unmistakable — they’re not just presenting, they’re **positioning for impact**!!!

⚙️ **November Scandium-Aluminum (Sc-Al) Unveil: HUGE & FLYING UNDER THE RADAR!**  
Confirmed partnership reveal with a U.S. **Defense Prime** expected. First domestic scandium-aluminum alloy (ScAl) prototype in 100 years — likely tied to **GENVI Aerospace applications**.

**“Made in America. Forged for Defense.”**

📊 **Q4 Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS) & EXIM Final Investment Decision (FID):**  
Enhanced mine plan, new energy efficiencies (RailVeyor), and expanded ore body data expected to increase NPV and reduce risk for EXIM’s credit approval.

Once DFS drops, EXIM moves from ‘conditional support’ to **‘go’ decision** — the green light for full-scale construction financing.

🧾 **Offtake Agreements:**  
Final prerequisite for EXIM’s FID. Rumors suggest multiple offtakes are already in negotiation — **Scandium, Niobium, and Titanium** buyers lining up from aerospace to EV sectors.

# 💡 Bottom Line

The **first drill result was the warning shot** — the “Shot Across the Bow.”  
Now Niocorp is maneuvering for a **full broadside**: more cores, national exposure, and strategic partnerships all converging into Q4.

* Float reset ✅
* Capital secured ✅
* Catalysts sequenced ✅
* Policy winds at their back ✅

**Next stop: the ignition window (Oct 21–Nov 8).**  
When the next core or partnership drops, the shorts will have no place to hide.

But Thursday , I noticed that his Reddit account was all deleted,

We didn’t really talk at first, just a polite smile here and a ‘morning’ there, but after a work night out we finally broke the ice and started talking. We spoke about football (soccer for you yanks) and other general shit and I realised she was a pretty intelligent girl who had a fair bit in common with me. 

Only issue was, and I’ll be real, I didn’t find her attractive at all. Like she isn’t ugly, just not attractive.. she’s a bit to tall and generally ‘big’ but not like overweight if you know what I mean. Anyway after that night she started sitting in the same office as me and we talked more and more. I still didn’t fancy her but started to realise how much I loved her personality and how, if she was in a different body I’d have asked her out already. Looking back on that I was so fucking stupid. 

Anyway, another work night out comes along and she had a hotel. I walk her back because I’m a decent bloke, and she invites me in.. I had a train to catch so I genuinely couldn’t, but I don’t know if I would’ve done either way. But yeah that’s where I wasted my opportunity with her. 

It didn’t change our relationship, we still got on really well. She’s still made me a coffee every morning and we’d still laugh and joke with each other. But then recently I find out she’s got a bf, who happens to also work with us and further also happens to be a good work friend of mine. 

At first I was happy for her because she deserves to find someone (I also was in a shot term relationship at the time with f(24)) but that ended and the more I see her the more I realise I had such a great opportunity and I threw it away because I wasn’t physically attracted to her. And now I fear it’s too late. 

Is there any way I can make her realise I like her a bit, but do it in a way so subtle it doesn’t disrupt her current relationship? I really don’t wanna fuck it up for them but I can’t help my feelings. Fuck sake. 

TLDR: I missed an opportunity with a girl who was great in every way for me because I wasn’t physically attracted to her, now she has a boyfriend and I realise I may have liked her more than I thought. ",0,1760785800.0,relationships,15,0.09,False

Oh, Riley. There’s something almost sacred about the way she greets me every time I come home. It doesn’t matter if I’ve been gone ten minutes or ten days; she’s there, waiting in the kitchen like hope wrapped in fur. Her tail swishes back and forth like a metronome set to the rhythm of pure devotion. The second our eyes meet, her entire body erupts with joy as if my return has just reset the universe, as if the sun itself has come back to life. She trembles with excitement, paws tap dancing on the floor, tail spinning into a blur, a living explosion of love that asks for nothing in return.

When I finally kneel to greet her, she presses her head against my chest and exhales that deep, contented sigh only dogs seem to know. In that moment, everything heavy in my life, the worries, the regrets, the endless noise fades into the background. It’s just me and her. Her heartbeat steady against mine, reminding me that sometimes love doesn’t need words, only presence.

Riley is a gentle soul in a world that can be anything but gentle. You can see it in her eyes, those deep, amber pools of patience that seem to hold the kind of understanding most humans never quite master. She doesn’t care if I’ve failed, if I’ve stumbled, or if I’ve lost my way. She doesn’t measure love in success or perfection. She loves me in my sweatpants, with bedhead and coffee breath, as much as she would if I were wearing a crown. Her loyalty isn’t earned; it’s given, freely and fully, every single day.

And then there’s the laughter. Riley has a knack for turning the ordinary into comedy gold. She’ll twist herself into shapes that defy logic, as if she’s trying to audition for Cirque du Soleil: one paw over her face, tongue lolling out, belly exposed in sheer bliss. Sometimes she sits upright like a tiny, judgmental human, watching me, waiting for my attention. And her tail-chasing escapades? Hysterical, a swirling, furry tornado of confusion and determination that never fails to make me laugh until I can’t breathe.

But what I love most is what Riley represents. She’s joy you can touch. Laughter with a heartbeat. Love that walks on four legs and greets you at the door like you’re the best thing that’s ever happened to her. In a world full of people who rush, judge, and forget, a dog remembers. They remind you that you matter, that you’re loved exactly as you are, and that sometimes the best medicine for a weary soul is a cold nose and a warm heart pressed against your own.

So, why should everyone own a dog? Because they teach us what we so often forget; how to love without reason, how to forgive without hesitation, and how to find happiness in the simplest of things.

1o9sq0c,https://i.redd.it/3nfhp7mjouvf1.png,Unmasking Madison's Evil | Fiancé's order ready for delivery but mix-up with the shipping address,"The shrill ring of my phone pierced through the quiet Valentine's morning. I fumbled for it on my nightstand, squinting at the unfamiliar number flashing across the screen.

""Hello?"" I answered, my voice still rough with sleep.

""Is this Olivia Bennett?"" The woman's voice was professional, measured.

""Yes, this is she."" I sat up, pushing my hair out of my face. Ethan's side of the bed was empty—again. He'd been working late a lot lately. Or so he said.

""This is Sarah Mitchell from Sensations Boutique."" A pause. ""We have your fiancé's order ready for delivery, but I'm calling because there seems to be a mix-up with the shipping address.""

My heart stuttered. ""What kind of order?""

""Several items from our premium collection."" Her tone shifted subtly. ""Lingerie, massage oils, and some... intimate toys.""

Heat rushed to my face. ""And the delivery address?""

""That's why I'm calling, Ms. Bennett. The address Mr. Price provided isn't your residence. It's a hotel downtown—the Grand Meridian.""

The room seemed to tilt around me. ""That's impossible. There must be some mistake.""

""According to our records, Mr. Price placed this order three days ago. He was very specific about the delivery instructions."" Her voice softened slightly. ""He requested discretion.""

I thanked her mechanically and hung up, my fingers trembling. Ethan hadn't mentioned any surprise gifts for Valentine's Day. And why would he send them to a hotel?

I tried calling him, but it went straight to voicemail. My mind raced through possibilities, each more painful than the last. Maybe he was planning a special getaway? But why wouldn't he tell me?

Before I could spiral further, my phone chimed with a text from Madison.

\*Valentine's surprise for you, sweet friend.\*

Attached were photos that made my stomach lurch. Madison and Ethan, tangled together in what was unmistakably a hotel room. Her red nails trailing down his chest. His lips on her neck. The date stamp from just last night.

Then another text:

\*Did you really think he was working late? We've been together for months. Poor Olivia, always so trusting.\*

More photos followed. Each one a knife to my heart.

\*He says you're boring in bed. Too vanilla for his tastes.\*

\*Don't worry about returning my calls. I'll be busy with your man.\*

I dropped the phone as if it had burned me. The room spun around me—the framed photos of Ethan and me on our trips, the wedding planning book on the coffee table, the calendar marked with our June wedding date. All of it felt like a cruel joke.

I stumbled to the bathroom, barely making it before emptying the contents of my stomach. As I rinsed my mouth, I caught my reflection—pale, hollow-eyed, mascara streaking down my cheeks.

How could I have been so blind? Madison was my best friend since college. We'd shared everything—our dreams, our fears, even our crushes. And Ethan... the man I'd built my life around for six years.

I sank to the floor, my back against the cool tile wall. My phone kept buzzing with more messages from Madison, each more vicious than the last. I couldn't bear to look at them.

Hours passed in a blur of tears and numbness. Eventually, I dragged myself up, moving on autopilot. I needed to know if there was any truth to her claims about Ethan's dissatisfaction with our relationship.

In our bathroom cabinet, behind my extra makeup bags, I found a pregnancy test I'd bought last week when my period was late. I'd been waiting for the right moment to take it, wanting to be sure before telling Ethan.

Now seemed as good a time as any.

Two minutes later, I stared at the two pink lines with trembling hands.

Positive.

A strange calm washed over me. Despite everything, despite the betrayal burning through my veins, a tiny spark of hope flickered to life.

If Madison thought she'd won, she was wrong. Ethan and I had history. We had plans. And now we had a baby on the way.

I placed my hand protectively over my still-flat stomach. ""It's just you and me for now,"" I whispered.

By evening, I had composed myself enough to plan my next move. I would tell Ethan about the baby when he came home. Surely this news would bring him back to me. Surely he would choose his family over whatever fling he was having with Madison.

I straightened our apartment, prepared his favorite meal, and lit candles. The test sat hidden in my pocket, waiting for the perfect moment.

The sound of his key in the lock made my heart race. I took a deep breath, steeling myself for what was to come.

""Ethan,"" I would say, ""we need to talk. I have something important to tell you.""

The door swung open, and I stepped forward with a smile that felt like glass—beautiful but ready to shatter at any moment.

I couldn't sit at home any longer, waiting for Ethan to return with whatever lies he'd prepared. The pregnancy test felt like a lead weight in my pocket as I grabbed my coat and keys. If I was going to confront him with life-changing news, I needed to know exactly what I was up against.

I called Caroline, my voice barely steady. ""Can you track Ethan's phone for me?""

""You don't need to ask twice,"" she replied, her tone hardening. ""Give me fifteen minutes.""

The text came through quickly: \*Downtown, corner of Maple and 5th. Looks like he's at Tiffany & Co.\*

My stomach twisted. Valentine's Day gifts? After everything?

I drove downtown with my hands gripping the steering wheel so tightly my knuckles turned white. The upscale jewelry store stood like a temple to wealth, all gleaming windows and polished chrome. I parked across the street, my heart hammering against my ribs.

Through the window, I could see Ethan moving between display cases, his expression more animated than I'd seen in months. A saleswoman followed him, nodding as he pointed at various items.

I slipped out of my car and crossed the street, staying close to the buildings. The pregnancy test seemed to burn against my thigh with every step. Just hours ago, I'd imagined this baby might save us. Now I wasn't sure what ""us"" even meant anymore.

I positioned myself near the side window, partially hidden by a decorative plant. Ethan stood at the counter now, examining something small in his hand.

""Can I see the engraving options?"" His voice carried through the glass, clear and eager.

The saleswoman nodded, producing a tablet. ""We have several elegant scripts to choose from.""

I watched as Ethan carefully selected something, his finger tracing letters on the screen. The saleswoman nodded, disappearing into the back.

Minutes later, she returned with two delicate silver bracelets. Even from outside, I could see the intricate designs, the careful craftsmanship.

""Perfect,"" Ethan said, taking one in his hand. He examined it closely, his thumb running over what I now realized were names engraved in flowing script.

Ethan & Madison.

My vision blurred. Not just gifts—matching bracelets with their names. A permanent symbol of their relationship.

Ethan pulled out his wallet, extracting our joint credit card. The same card we'd used for our wedding planning, for our future home down payment.

""I'll take them both,"" he said, handing over the card with a smile.

I stumbled backward, nearly colliding with a passerby. The stranger steadied me with a concerned look, but I barely noticed.

""Ethan & Madison.""

The words echoed in my head like a death knell for our relationship. This wasn't just an affair. This was commitment. This was future planning.

Somehow, I made it home before Ethan. I paced our living room, the pregnancy test clutched in my trembling hand. The positive result seemed to mock me now—a child conceived in what I'd thought was love, but was actually just another lie.

The sound of his key in the lock made me freeze. I turned to face the door as it swung open.

""Olivia?"" Ethan looked surprised to see me waiting. ""I thought you'd be at your book club tonight.""

I held up the pregnancy test, my hand shaking so badly I nearly dropped it. ""I have something to tell you.""

His eyes narrowed on the plastic stick in my hand. ""Is that—""

""I'm pregnant,"" I said, the words catching in my throat. ""We're going to have a baby.""

Instead of joy or even surprise, Ethan's face hardened. ""Are you sure it's mine?""

The question hit me like a physical blow. ""Of course it's yours! Who else would it be?""

He set down his briefcase, his movements deliberate. ""You've been acting strange for weeks. Following me around, checking my phone. Did you hire someone to follow me today?""

""No, I—"" I began, but he cut me off.

""Because if you did, that's crossing a line, Olivia."" His voice rose, defensive and angry. ""Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean you can invade my privacy.""

""Paranoid?"" I stepped toward him, disbelief washing over me. ""Madison sent me photos of you two together! I know about the hotel!""

Something flickered across his face—not guilt, but irritation at being caught. ""Madison means nothing to me.""

""Nothing?"" I echoed, my voice breaking. ""Then why did I just watch you buy matching bracelets with both your names engraved on them?""

His eyes widened slightly, then narrowed again. ""You were following me?""

""I wanted to know the truth,"" I whispered.

""Well, now you know,"" he said coldly. ""But it doesn't change anything between us.""

I stared at him, this stranger wearing my fiancé's face. ""How can you say that? We're having a baby!""

Ethan's gaze dropped to the test in my hand, then back to my face. What I saw there made my blood run cold.

""A baby doesn't mean I have to give up everything else,"" he said.

The shrill ring of my phone cut through the silence of our apartment. I'd been sitting in the same spot for hours, staring at the pregnancy test on the coffee table, my mind replaying Ethan's cold dismissal of my accusations. The clock on the wall showed 2:17 AM.

I fumbled for my phone, hoping it was Ethan with an explanation, an apology—anything to fix the shattered pieces of my world.

""Hello?"" My voice sounded hollow even to my own ears.

""Olivia!"" Madison's voice was frantic, breathless. ""Thank God you picked up. It's Ethan—he's been in an accident!""

My heart lurched into my throat. ""What? Where? Is he okay?""

""He's unconscious, Liv. The ambulance just took him, but—"" Her voice broke. ""They don't think—I don't know if he's going to make it.""

I was already grabbing my keys, my purse. ""Where? Which hospital?""

""Not a hospital yet. We're still at the scene. It's bad, Olivia."" She gave me an address—a remote road outside the city limits. ""Please hurry. He's asking for you.""

My mind raced. Why would Ethan be with Madison at this hour? Why would he be asking for me if he'd left angry? But terror drowned out my suspicions.

""I'm coming,"" I promised, already fumbling for my coat. ""Text me the exact location.""

The address pinged on my phone seconds later. As I rushed out the door, I noticed Madison's message: \*Come alone. He's in no condition for an audience.\*

Outside, rain lashed against my face. The weather report had warned of severe storms tonight, but I hadn't been paying attention. Now, as I slid into my car, I realized how dangerous the conditions were—heavy rain reducing visibility, wind howling through the trees.

""Please be okay,"" I whispered to my unborn child as I pulled away from the curb. ""Please let him be okay.""

The drive was treacherous. My wipers struggled against the downpour, and fog rolled in off the river, blanketing the road in ghostly white. My phone rang again as I navigated the slick streets toward the outskirts of town.

""Madison?"" I answered, putting her on speaker.

""The ambulance is stuck in the mud,"" she said, her voice tight with panic. ""You need to take the old river road instead. It's the only way to get here now.""

I hesitated. The old river road was notorious for its sharp curves and poor maintenance. ""Are you sure? That road is dangerous in this weather.""

""Ethan is dying, Olivia!"" she screamed. ""Just get here however you can!""

The line went dead. I swallowed hard and turned onto the narrow road, my headlights barely penetrating the wall of rain and fog. My hands gripped the steering wheel so tightly my knuckles turned white.

""Please hold on,"" I whispered to Ethan, to our baby, to myself. ""Just hold on.""

The road twisted sharply, hugging the riverbank. I could hear the water rushing below, swollen from the storm. My phone rang again.

""Madison?""

""Where are you?"" Her voice was oddly calm now.

""Just past the bend by Miller's Bridge—""

""Perfect.""

The word hung in the air between us, strange and chilling. Before I could respond, headlights appeared through the fog—high, bright, approaching fast from the opposite direction.

A truck. Too wide for this narrow road. Coming straight toward me.

I swerved instinctively, but the wet pavement offered no traction. My car spun, tires screaming against asphalt. The world tilted sideways as my vehicle left the road, airborne for one suspended moment before crashing down the embankment.

Metal crunched. Glass shattered. My body jerked violently as the seatbelt cut into my chest and abdomen. Pain exploded through me as we rolled once, twice—

Then darkness.

I awoke to the steady beep of machines and the antiseptic smell of hospital sheets. For a moment, I couldn't remember where I was or how I'd gotten there. Then the pain hit—a dull, throbbing ache that seemed to radiate from my very core.

""Ms. Bennett?"" A woman's voice, gentle but clinical. ""Can you hear me?""

I forced my eyes open to see a doctor standing beside my bed—a woman with kind eyes and a grave expression.

""I'm Dr. Martinez,"" she said. ""You've been in an accident.""

Memory flooded back—the rain, the fog, Madison's call, the truck that came out of nowhere.

""Ethan,"" I whispered, trying to sit up. ""Where is he? Is he okay?""

Dr. Martinez placed a gentle hand on my shoulder. ""Ms. Bennett, there's something I need to tell you."" Her eyes held mine with compassionate intensity. ""You've suffered significant trauma. The impact of the accident caused... complications.""

I knew before she said it. Somehow, I knew.

""The baby?"" My voice was barely audible.

""I'm so sorry,"" she said softly. ""We couldn't save the pregnancy.""

The words hit me like a physical blow. My hand moved instinctively to my stomach, finding it wrapped in bandages beneath my hospital gown. Empty now. Our child—our last hope—gone.

As tears streamed down my face, one thought crystallized through my grief: Madison had known exactly what she was doing when she sent me into that storm.",1,1760784914.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

Context: My partner (39M) and I (27F) just had our 1st anniversary. I was really looking forward to it because in my past relationship we never really celebrated monthsaries, much less anniversaries. My partner’s life is comfortable, let’s just say that he isn’t working a 9-5 job and can spend the whole day just chilling if he chooses to. While I work in an industry where I handle cash and sometimes work can be absolutely hectic.

So on the day of our anniversary, I still had to work and we weren’t meeting up until after I got off work— so basically, dinner pa. Silly old me siguro din because I assumed na since he was basically chilling the whole day, baka naman he had something planned or what. Pero kung wala naman then wala namang problema.

After work, he messaged me na we’ll just meet each other sa place of business niya. No biggie kasi that’s our routine na din when we have dinner most nights—from work I take a taxi or a Grab to where he is. And from there, we went to dinner.

I enjoyed— as always because everytime I’m with him feeling ko nagdidisappear lahat. Ganyan ako ka inlove sa kanya to the point na I am always willing to look past everything (including his minor infidelity early on in our relationship—he was really remorseful about that naman and since talking about it, I have moved past it) and then after dinner, we went to the mall because I wanted to buy him shoes because he loves to collect a lot of it.

And then after that he drove me home.

Masaya naman ako that day pero the moment I shut the gate I was uncontrollably bawling my eyes out. I don’t know why ang lungkot lungkot ko.

Was it because I was in my luteal phase? Or was it because he didn’t even get me anything on the day of our first anniversary?

Kahit man lang pumitas siya ng isang pirasong bulaklak sa gilid ng kalsada or kahit nga sulatan niya ako ng love letter sobrang saya ko na. I do not need expensive gifts for me to feel loved and happy. Sana man lang a little something to show that he thought about me.

I am so conflicted kasi currently, I feel indifferent towards him. I just feel really hurt kasi he had a whole free day and he didn’t even bother to get me that 130 peso coffee I like very much—on the day of our first year as a couple.

Gina gaslight ko nga sarili ko na baka masyado lang ako nag expect and that I shouldn’t be feeling this way kasi deep down alam ko naman mahal niya ako. Ganon lang din siguro if matured na yung guy kasi we have a huge age gap din.

SO PLEASEEE, tell meee 😭 is it valid naman ba na I get upset? Or should I talk to him about this before it piles up and creates this emotional distance between us? Any adivce? ",2,1760784641.0,adviceph,4,1.0,False

ROUTES

Day 1 Col du Tourmalet Loop from Luz 103.5km (2323m El). Second time up the Tourmalet for me and chuffed to take 20 mins off my previous time. It's the one to be done and if I'm here again will tick the box for a 3rd time. The west to east way (from Luz) is prettier. If you go over and down the other side as we did it's a slog back on very flat roads via Lourdes.

Day 2 Col du Soulor and Aubisque 75.5km (1735m El). Second time on the Soulor but approached it from Argeles this time. The climb is broken in two with a flatter 5km section in the middle. Great coffee at the top! Slight descent off the Soulor and on to the jewel of this ride.  The balcony road to the Aubisque. Stop and enjoy it the view is breathtaking. The climb to the Aubisque is mainly 4-5% with a sting in the tail but doesn't really go over 8% all the way.  This was an out and back with refreshments (🍺) in Argeles.

Day 3 Cirque de Gavarnie (am), Hautacam (pm) 104km (2289 m El).  Gavarnie was recommended by the host and wow. For any geography nerds you just have to see it, a cirque rising a mile out of the ground at the pretty village of Gavarnie on the 🇪🇸 border. Thankfully an easy 4-5% in the rising valley road via Luz to keep the legs fresh for the afternoon. The Hautacam is a beast you're only a km in and you're greeted with a 10-12% section. It's never steady but flattens out to 6-7% to give some relief before returning again to 10-12%. The last km is actually the easiest of the 13km. Box ticked this has been on the list since 2019.

1o9sger,https://i.redd.it/cxlnvkjemuvf1.png,"Best Friend's Cruel Betrayal | she was unconscious, her skin burning with fever","The world collapsed around me as Opal's small body went limp in my arms. One moment she was complaining about not feeling well, the next she was unconscious, her skin burning with fever.

""Opal! Baby, can you hear me?"" My voice cracked as I pressed my ear to her chest, relief flooding through me at the rapid heartbeat beneath my palm.

I grabbed my phone with trembling fingers, dialing emergency services. ""My daughter just collapsed. She's burning up and not responding to me.""

The dispatcher's calm voice instructed me to lay her on a flat surface and check her breathing. I followed their directions mechanically, my mind racing faster than the ambulance sirens wailing in the distance.

""Ma'am, can you tell me your daughter's medical history?"" A paramedic asked as they loaded Opal into the ambulance.

""She's always been healthy,"" I said, climbing in beside her. ""Just some minor colds. Nothing like this.""

At the hospital, doctors whisked Opal away to the pediatric intensive care unit. A kind-faced nurse with silver hair guided me to a waiting area, promising to update me as soon as possible.

Time stretched endlessly as I sat there, my hands still shaking. I pulled out my phone and called Stone again. And again. And again.

On the fifth attempt, he finally answered.

""Ruby, I'm in the middle of something important,"" he said, his voice distant and irritated.

""Opal's in the hospital,"" I said, my voice breaking. ""They don't know what's wrong with her. She collapsed at home. Stone, please—"" I couldn't finish the sentence.

There was a pause. ""What do the doctors say?""

""They're running tests now. They mentioned something about an infection in her bloodstream. They're talking about surgery."" Tears streamed down my face. ""Stone, I need you here. Opal needs you here.""

""I'll see what I can do,"" he said finally.

Two hours later, Stone strode into the hospital, his linen pants and flowing shirt a stark contrast to my rumpled clothes and tear-stained face. He looked more like he was heading to a yoga class than to his daughter's hospital bed.

""Any updates?"" he asked, not meeting my eyes.

""They think it's sepsis,"" I whispered. ""They're starting antibiotics now, but they might need to operate if—"" My voice caught.

Stone sighed, running a hand through his perfectly styled hair. ""You know, Ruby, my spiritual mentor always says that we must accept what cannot be changed.""

I stared at him, uncomprehending. ""What are you talking about?""

""This emotional hysteria isn't helping Opal,"" he continued, his voice taking on that placating tone he used when he thought I was being unreasonable. ""My retreat has shown me that true healing comes from inner peace, not from fighting against what the universe presents us.""

""Are you seriously giving me spiritual lectures while our daughter might be dying?"" I whispered, afraid to wake Opal but unable to contain my disbelief.

Stone checked his watch. ""I can't stay long. My meditation session starts in an hour.""

""An hour?"" I repeated, my voice rising despite my efforts. ""Stone, she's your daughter!""

""And I love her very much,"" he said smoothly. ""But my spiritual growth can't be interrupted for every crisis. That's something you've never understood, Ruby.""

I watched in stunned silence as he patted Opal's hand perfunctorily and then walked toward the door.

""I need to get back to the retreat,"" he said, not bothering to look back. ""Call me if anything... significant changes.""

After he left, I sat beside Opal's bed, holding her small hand between mine. Hours passed as doctors came and went, adjusting machines and medications.

When a nurse asked for our insurance information, I realized I didn't have Stone's wallet card.

""I'll check his bag,"" I told her, rifling through the leather messenger bag Stone had left behind.

That's when I found it—his phone, unlocked and forgotten in the side pocket.

A notification lit up the screen: a message from Gemma.

""Did you tell her yet? About us?""

My heart stopped as I scrolled up through their conversation.

""We need to handle the Ruby situation soon,"" Stone had written just days ago.

""After we deal with Opal's health thing,"" Gemma had replied.

There were photos too—intimate ones that made my stomach turn.

The hospital room seemed to tilt around me as pieces clicked into place. Stone's late nights at ""meditation sessions."" Gemma's increasing presence in our lives. Their knowing glances when they thought I wasn't looking.

When Stone returned hours later to retrieve his forgotten bag, I was waiting.

""Did you really think I wouldn't find out?"" I held up his phone, my hand surprisingly steady despite the earthquake happening inside me.

His face drained of color as he recognized what I'd discovered.

And in that moment, standing beside our daughter's hospital bed, I knew exactly what needed to be done.

""I want a divorce,"" I said, my voice clear and unwavering. ""And I want it now.

The sound of heels clicking against hospital linoleum announced my mother's arrival before I saw her face. I looked up from Opal's bedside to find both my parents standing in the doorway, their expressions a mixture of disappointment and barely contained rage.

""Ruby Elizabeth Thompson."" My mother's voice cut through the sterile air like a blade. She never used my full name unless I was in serious trouble. ""What is this nonsense I'm hearing about a divorce?""

I stood slowly, my legs unsteady from hours of sitting vigil. ""Mom, Dad, I'm glad you're here. Opal's been—""

""Don't you dare change the subject."" She stepped into the room, her purse clutched like a weapon. ""Your husband called us. He's beside himself with worry—not just about Opal, but about your mental state.""

My father remained by the door, his jaw set in that familiar line of judgment. ""Ruby, this isn't the time for rash decisions. The child needs stability.""

""Stability?"" I kept my voice low, glancing at Opal's sleeping form. ""Where was Stone's stability when she collapsed? Where was he when she needed surgery consultations?""

""He was seeking spiritual guidance,"" my mother snapped. ""Something you clearly need. A wife doesn't abandon her marriage vows because things get difficult.""

The word 'abandon' hit me like a physical blow. ""I'm not abandoning anything. He's been having an affair, Mom. With Gemma. For months.""

""So what?"" The casual cruelty in her voice made me step backward. ""Men stray sometimes. That's what marriage is—forgiveness, commitment, standing by your husband no matter what.""

""No matter what?"" My voice rose despite my efforts to stay quiet. ""Even when he calls our daughter's illness an inconvenience? Even when he—""

The slap came so fast I didn't see it coming. My mother's palm connected with my cheek with a sharp crack that seemed to echo in the small room. The sting spread across my face, but the emotional impact was worse—the complete rejection from the woman who was supposed to protect me.

""You selfish disgrace,"" she hissed, her face twisted with disgust. ""Your daughter is fighting for her life, and all you can think about is your wounded pride?""

My father moved quickly, grabbing my mother's arm. ""Helen, that's enough."" But his eyes held no sympathy for me. ""Ruby, you're destroying this family. Whatever problems you think you have with Stone can be worked out. But divorce? That's not an option.""

I touched my burning cheek, tears threatening to spill. ""I found the messages, Dad. Photos. Plans to be together once they 'handle the Opal situation.' They're treating our daughter like an obstacle.""

""You're being hysterical,"" my mother said, straightening her jacket. ""This is exactly what Stone warned us about. You're having some kind of breakdown.""

Before I could respond, Stone appeared in the doorway. His timing was too perfect, too convenient. He'd been waiting, listening.

""Ruby, sweetheart,"" he said, his voice dripping with false concern. ""Your parents are worried about you. We all are.""

The nurse at the station looked over with interest. Other families in nearby rooms had gone quiet, straining to hear the drama unfolding.

""She's not thinking clearly,"" Stone continued, addressing my parents but speaking loud enough for everyone to hear. ""The stress of Opal's condition has pushed her over the edge. She's making wild accusations, threatening to tear our family apart when our daughter needs us most.""

I watched in horror as he painted me as the unstable one, the dangerous parent. My own parents nodded along, completely convinced by his performance.

""I think it might be best if Ruby took some time away,"" he said softly. ""To get the help she needs. I'll stay with Opal, of course. Someone needs to be the stable presence in her life right now.""

""No."" The word came out stronger than I felt. ""I'm not leaving my daughter.""

""See?"" Stone gestured toward me as if I'd just proven his point. ""This is what I mean. She's not rational right now.""

The nurse was writing something down. Other hospital staff had begun to notice the commotion. I could see the doubt creeping into their faces—was I the problem parent? The unstable mother having a breakdown?

Just then, Gemma appeared at the end of the hallway, moving toward us with that familiar concerned expression she'd perfected over years of friendship. My stomach turned as I realized she was here to complete the performance, to add her voice to the chorus painting me as unfit.

""Ruby, honey,"" she called out, her voice carrying that perfectly calibrated note of worried affection. ""I came as soon as I heard about poor Opal.""

She brushed past my parents and Stone, heading straight for Opal's bedside. I watched her lean over my daughter, stroking her hair with practiced tenderness.

""Don't worry, sweetheart,"" Gemma whispered, just loud enough for the adults to hear. ""Mommy's just very upset right now, but Daddy and I are here. We'll always be here for you.""

Opal's eyes fluttered open, still groggy from medication. ""Aunt Gemma?""

""That's right, baby. I'm here."" Gemma's voice was sugar-sweet, but I caught the calculating look she shot me over Opal's head. ""Mommy's been very angry lately, hasn't she? But that's not your fault. Sometimes grown-ups get so angry they forget how to love properly.""

The words were poison wrapped in comfort, designed to sound caring to any observer while planting seeds of doubt in my daughter's vulnerable mind.

""But you love me, right?"" Opal asked, her small voice uncertain.

""Of course I do, sweetheart. Daddy and I both love you so very much. We'll always take care of you, no matter what Mommy decides to do.""

I felt the walls closing in around me. My parents believed Stone's lies. The hospital staff were documenting my 'unstable behavior.' And now Gemma was systematically poisoning my daughter against me, all while appearing to be the caring family friend.

Stone moved closer to my ear, his voice so low only I could hear: ""You have no idea what you're up against, Ruby. By the time I'm done, no one will believe a word you say.""

The first sign came when my debit card was declined at the hospital pharmacy. I stared at the small screen displaying 'INSUFFICIENT FUNDS' while holding Opal's prescription for anti-seizure medication—medication that cost three hundred dollars and that insurance wouldn't cover until next month.

""I'm sorry, there must be some mistake,"" I told the pharmacist, my cheeks burning with embarrassment. ""Let me try my credit card.""

Declined. Then my other card. Declined.

The pharmacist, a kind older woman, leaned forward sympathetically. ""Honey, would you like me to call your bank? Sometimes there are holds on accounts during medical emergencies.""

I nodded, stepping aside to let other customers pass while she made the call. But I already knew what she would find. The sick feeling in my stomach told me this wasn't a banking error.

Twenty minutes later, I sat in my car outside the pharmacy, my hands shaking as I called our bank's customer service line. The automated system cheerfully informed me that our joint checking account had been frozen at the request of the primary account holder—Stone Morgan. Our savings account showed a balance of twelve dollars. Everything else had been transferred to an account I didn't have access to.

I called Stone immediately, my fingers trembling with rage.

""Ruby, I was wondering when you'd call,"" he said, his voice maddeningly calm.

""You froze our accounts? Our daughter needs medication, Stone. How am I supposed to—""

""I'm protecting our family's financial stability,"" he interrupted. ""You're not thinking clearly right now. The last thing we need is for you to drain our accounts in some kind of manic episode.""

""Manic episode?"" My voice rose, drawing stares from people walking past my car. ""I'm trying to pay for our daughter's medicine!""

""And I'll take care of that. I've already picked up her prescription. But until you get the help you need, I can't allow you to make irrational financial decisions that could jeopardize Opal's future care.""

The casual way he wielded my love for Opal as a weapon made my vision blur with fury. ""You can't do this. Half of that money is mine.""

""Actually, I can. I spoke with my attorney, and given your current mental state and threats to abandon the family, this is perfectly legal. I'm protecting our assets from your unstable behavior.""

I ended the call before I said something that would only give him more ammunition. But as I sat there, staring at my empty bank balance, the full scope of his strategy became clear. He wasn't just stealing our money—he was ensuring I couldn't fight back.

The campaign against my reputation started subtly. At first, I didn't notice the sideways glances at the grocery store or the way conversations stopped when I approached. But by the end of the week, the whispers had grown loud enough to reach me.

""I heard she's having some kind of breakdown,"" I overheard Mrs. Patterson telling her friend in the cereal aisle. ""Poor Stone is trying to hold the family together while she's making wild accusations.""

""And with that sweet little girl so sick,"" her friend replied, shaking her head. ""Some women just can't handle stress.""

I turned the corner quickly, my cheeks burning. Stone's family had deep roots in this community, connections that stretched through country clubs, business networks, and social circles I'd never fully penetrated. They were using every one of those connections to paint me as the unstable wife, the failing mother who'd cracked under pressure.

The final blow came on Friday morning. I was getting ready to visit Opal when my phone rang. My boss, Jennifer, sounded uncomfortable from the first word.

""Ruby, I need you to come in today. We need to talk.""

I knew. Even before I walked into her office and saw the stack of printed emails on her desk, I knew what was coming.

""I'm sorry, Ruby,"" Jennifer said, not meeting my eyes. ""But we've received several complaints about your... situation. Clients are concerned about the company's reputation being associated with such a scandalous case.""

""Scandalous case?"" I sat down heavily. ""My daughter is sick, and my husband is having an affair. How is that scandalous?""

""The Morgans are significant clients,"" she said quietly. ""And Marcus Morgan specifically called to express concerns about our continued employment of someone who might be... unstable.""

The word hit me like a physical blow. Stone's father, using his business influence to destroy my livelihood.

""I need this job, Jennifer. I have medical bills, and Stone has frozen our accounts—""

""I'm sorry. You've become a liability we can't afford."" She slid a severance packet across the desk. ""Two weeks' pay. I wish I could do more.""

I walked out of that office knowing I'd lost more than a job. I'd lost my financial independence, my professional reputation, and any hope of fighting Stone on equal ground. As I sat in my car in the parking lot, watching my former colleagues through the office windows, I realized how completely I'd been outmaneuvered.

Stone hadn't just stolen my money and poisoned my relationships—he'd systematically dismantled my ability to survive without him. And somewhere in a hospital room, my daughter was learning to see me as the problem, not the solution.

But as I drove toward the hospital, something hardened inside me. They thought they'd broken me, left me powerless and desperate. They had no idea what a mother would do to protect her child—or how far I was willing to go to expose the truth.",1,1760783942.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

I'm in the process of optimizing my newly created web application which I won't link directly in order to respect this subredit's rules, but you can easily find it on Google by searching 'who sleeps now'. 

The whole idea behind the website started a couple of days ago when I couldn't sleep and I was curious what were the global sleep stats around the world, which proved to be more difficult than not. Long story short, I was pulled in by the idea and leveraged the everly increasing AI competence paired with the right tools to generate this subjectively awesome MVP. 

Needless to say that I didn't sleep for a couple of nights because of the website, so hopefully it will be worth it if it helps at least one person in some type of way. It's not behind a paywall or doesn't even require you to login (although it has a login option to allow for personalized advice) and I plan to keep it that way until/if it will scale up considerably, including the running costs. 

The main features of the website include sleep stats around the world, a dreamy UI that is by design created to make you sleepy, including a real life star map as a background paired with slow animations, leveraging Gemini Flash to provide you personalized information in regards to sleep or whatever else you are interested in. 

If you decide to share your location using the dedicated CTAs, the app will show you some countdown timers until you should stop eating, drinking coffee or exercising intensely in order to improve your sleep, as well as some atmospheric and weather related conditions that could affect it positively or negatively.   
  
Any type of feedback would be greatly appreciated and, as a bonus, if you decide that you like the app and will use it frequently, I'll make sure to impement your feasible and awesome suggestions into the project.   
  
Also, please ignore the in-site support button, as your honest advice would be 100 times more valuable than any revenue I'll generate at this point.

  
I wish to you wonderful days and serene nights full of healthy and unintrerupted sleep!

1o9sbfd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o9sbfd,Biking through Norway to the North Cape: Chapter 2,"**From Tromsø to the North Cape** 

On Wednesday, June 25th, I get up at 5:00 a.m. after a wonderful night's sleep, do some final work on my bike, and repack my panniers. Then I have breakfast.

I set off at 7:30 a.m. and first have to cross the high bridge again and over the hills of Tromsø, then over another high bridge until, after an hour and a lot of energy spent, I finally reach the start of my stage. The road leads through the suburbs of Tromsø and, with a fresh headwind, there are many uphill and downhill sections, making it a challenging ride. The E6, where the route continues, is fraught with traffic.

At 10 a.m., I take an hour-long break to eat in my bivouac bag on a small patch of grass, as the grass is wet and there's a light drizzle. From the turnoff from the E6 to the ferry to Breivikeidet, it's mostly uphill, but at least I'm no longer facing a headwind. At around 2 p.m., I take a lunch break at a spot where I am plagued by small biting flies from the outset. And then it starts to rain heavily, so I hastily pack everything up, put on my rain gear, and finish eating. Not only the rain, but also the cold wind and the mountains covered in snow far below impressively show me that I am in Arctic latitudes beyond 70 degrees north. At 3:30 p.m., I'm on the ferry, where I drink coffee in the warm lounge.

*Info: Ferries that connect two roads across the sea are usually free of charge for all users.*

With renewed energy and a tailwind, I continue on National Road 91. The sky is getting darker and darker, with only the distant mountain peaks catching the sun. The wind blows coldly down from the snow-capped mountains. Only the exertion of cycling and my rain gear keep me warm. Around 6 p.m., I reach the next ferry. After about 10 minutes, the ship arrives (Picture 1) and takes on an entire tanker truckload of fuel, so we don't reach the other side until 7:20 p.m. Because of the strong, cold north wind, I'm quite cold by now, so I head to the campsite at the pier, where I rent a simple cabin (Picture 4), as it's too cold for me in my tent with my sleeping bag, which is only warm enough to 10°C. After a hot shower and settling in, I eat, chat with a Swiss man camping who's cycled everywhere since May 1st, and send a WhatsApp message to my family. I go to bed at 11 p.m., but have a bit of trouble falling asleep. I've cycled 100 km in over seven hours, but because of the detours, I've only managed half of the stage I'd planned for the first day.

When I get up briefly at midnight, I see that the sun is shining, so I go outside and see the midnight sun rising above the road along Lynger Fjord. A magnificent sight I've dreamed of for 65 years.",29,1760783420.0,bikepacking,1,0.97,False

The pile on the right is my 'maybeboard'. I don't think any of these cards are better than the maindeck, but I could be convinced. \[\[Glimpse the Impossible\]\] *would* be good in this lower-curve draw-light deck, but the splash makes it too unreliable, imo.",3,1760783279.0,lrcast,4,1.0,False

I came up with the concept and hubby did the cad work. Pet tax on the final image ",7,1760783090.0,functionalprint,0,0.82,False

Until recently I lost almost all communication with my Father for almost decade due to his addiction, hoarding, and unstable lifestyle. Due to multiple unexpected family members deaths it caused my Dad to spiral and eventually into his hoarding tendencies. In those 10 years it was always known by everyone around him that the condition of his house wasn’t safe. He would never let anyone in, never accept or seek help, would slink through the front door so you couldn’t peak in, and in the summer he would blame the smell on the mountain of trash bags in the bed of his truck that hasn’t ran for years. His living conditions had gotten so bad that he switched between living next to the front door or in his building. 


Recently he needed me to come inside to help him move something out for someone. The state of my childhood home was something I was not or will never be prepared for. All I could do was distance and disassociate myself with what I was seeing. My childhood room was covered in dog poop, piss, trash, and random things that I couldn’t even register. I can’t even put into words how unreal it felt to see so many happy memories covered in biohazard filth. The ONLY space in that house that was clean was the master bedroom where my grandmother stayed when she was alive. When I was in high school I remember fighting a constant battle of trash and junk that he would just magically collect in no time. The moment I turned 18 I packed what I could and left. Deep down I knew where things were heading, and there was nothing I could do to stop him at the time.


Ever since that day I’ve noticed a huge change in my anxiety when my house is barely cluttered or dirty. I work long hours and many days a week so cleaning on my work days is almost impossible. Coming home and seeing a counter top with mail and random things on it puts me on edge, a sink that is full, and I’m convinced my house smells of dog piss. This is when I started noticing that what I saw might have affected me more than I thought or cared to acknowledge. One of my dogs had a small accident on the floor one day. Of course I clean it up and go on about life. For a couple days it bothered me more and more just building up until one day I moved everything out of my living room to sweep, vacuum, and mop my floors several times. Rationally I knew my floors weren’t caked with dog piss, but I FELT like it was. I couldn’t walk bare foot on the living room terrified I would feel a sticky wet sludge on the floor like my dad’s. 

When accidents do happen on rare occasion (I have two dog approaching their senior years) or when there’s a couple towels in my bathroom floor, maybe an outfit that missed the hamper, a coffee table with yesterdays junk mail, basket of laundry that need to be put up, or a sink with a load of dishes in it, I have a crippling fear like my home is one step away from becoming like his. No matter how much rationalizing I do with myself the longer it’s messy the more I’m convinced it’s unbelievably filthy.

Sadly financially therapy seems to be an unobtainable luxury so if there is anyone who can relate to this or has any advice that you’ve learned please let me know. I would really appreciate it! ",1,1760783038.0,ChildofHoarder,1,1.0,False
