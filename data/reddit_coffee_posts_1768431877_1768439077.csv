1qd57ly,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1qd57ly/some_notes_about_bay_leaves/,Some notes about bay leaves,"I get it--you have a box or bag of dried bay leaves that have been in the cabinet for a year and you think ""these don't do anything.""

Au contraire! Sure, fresh bay leaves have a lot more flavor than dried, but give the dried ones a chance. 

**Varieties!**

The most common type to encounter in your spice aisle in the U.S. is the Turkish bay leaf (Laurus nobilis). These are subtle and earthy with a hint of mint and have a milder flavor than, say, the California bay laurel leaf (Umbellularia californica) which is a little more punchy and has a eucalyptus note to it. As a child in Northern California I remember the smell of the bay laurels--potent stuff. You can make tea our of them that really helps a cold, IME. Mexican bay leaf (Litsea glaucescens) is similar to California but a little more subtle (you can find these in Mexican grocery stores), and Indian bay leaf (Cinnamomum tamala) has a pungent smell and is a bit similar to clove. You can find these in Indian grocery stores. 

**My main takeaway**

But let's say you're just working with the subtle, tasty Turkish dried leaves. Here's a tip: grind up your leaves. I have done this in a coffee grinder I bought just for spices, or you can use a spice grinder or mortar. Grind them to a powder, and use this as a seasoning--you'll get a lot more flavor out of it and a little goes a long way. You can add this powder to spice rubs, you can add it to salt to make bay leaf salt, you can put it in sauces and soups and salad dressings. Please give it a shot--you will thank me later. 

Finally, if you break one of your leaves in half and it has no smell, it's done. Toss them. But if you can still smell it, soak it in boiling water for tend minutes, then drink the water--you'll be able to taste the flavor. Bay leaf is one of those herbs that is subtle, but you will notice it if it's missing from your gumbo, your beef stew, your curry, etc.

1qd5284,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1qd5284/back_with_my_ex_i_am_lost/,Back with my ex - I am lost,"Hi all, sorry in advance for the long text.

I (26F) and my ex (32M - let's call him Finn) have recently started to see each other again. 

Here is the context:

We dated for a few months three years ago - it was very casual, we weren't really opening up to each other and we weren't chatting by message in between dates. Eventually I met someone else and I got into a serious relationship (for 1.5 years). I message Finn to let him know I met someone and wanted to try something with that person. Finn told he regretted to not have made enough efforts to be seriously with me.  He reached out a few times to see if I was still happy in my relationship and we went zero contact for a good 16 months. 

Than in 2024 I came back to him after going through tough times in my relationship and life in general... I basically realised that I always had feelings for Finn and that's why - despite trying - I was not falling in love with the person I was with. I decided to quit this relationship. 

Finn and I met again after al this time appart and things got very intense quickly - we decided to be together. We went in lots of dates, I met his family & friends and I was spending a lot of my time at his. I was so happy, it was like a dream. But two months later, things changed - we was less chatty by message, he was more distant and wasn't taking any initiatives. It felt like now he knew I was with him he didn't have to do any efforts. I knew he had a lot going on in his life (new job, new house etc.) and he was stressed. I tried to speak with him so many times but I basically carried the relationship on my own for approximately 4 months. I slowly collapsed into a depressive stage (due to the lack of communication, lack of support, lack of affection but also because of external factors) and the only way I found to help myself was to quit the relationship with him. It was extremely hard as I was madly in love with him despite everything. I know I hurt him by doing that, but I couldn't see a light in this situation at that time.

I got in a relationship 1.5month after (I know it's fast - I am not proud of it as I now realise it was to cope with the breakup) with a guy who gave me more in two months than Finn over the years.  But I was not happy and felt guilty very quickly for being with someone so fast after the breakup. We broke up very quickly.

I ended up seeing Finn almost every week after that as we were both involved in the same group... but I knew he was seeing his ex. It was extremely difficult for me to see him as he would sometimes be very friendly with me (which made me happy) and the following time he would act extremely cold and distant (which would put me in a real emotional distress).

A few months back, he invited me for tea and I decided to open my heart to him and to tell him how I feel about him. We spoke about the negative and positive points of our past relationship together. He said he could still feel a strong attraction between us... but he chose to try with his ex (his longest relationship, a girl I suspected he still had something for when we were together). That was very hard but I am the one who left initially so I understand that he won't be there running after me. However, he was liking some of my stories sometimes (something he usually doesn't do).

  
Now :

Few days ago, I had a dream about him (I had plenty over the months, but each time I felt terrible when I woke up). This time, things were different - I felt lighter, and very calm. I can't explain it but I felt the need to ask him to go for a coffee. We met, and had the best time. He came at mine for dinner that evening - we had more conversations about the past together, and started to speak about potential future (what we want, what we would need to do to make it work etc.). He explained to me that things didn't work out at all with his ex and he got a closure from this story. That really reassured me, and I could genuinely feel he was honest with me on that. Later, we kissed, said we will try to make it work this time and we spent the night together. He was extremely affectionate and we felt closer than ever. I could actually not believe it was real. Then arrive the time he had to leave in the morning.

After that day, we didn't send too many messages - I could feel he was distant, but he initiated a date. I went at his to watch a movie... but he was super distant. No kiss, just a hug to say hello and that it. So I asked him before leaving what was wrong and he said he thinks we should not rush the relationship. We should keep things platonic and go on date to know each other better as in the past he made the mistake to rush with an ex and things didn't work out. But he said he still finds me very attractive and wants to see me. I agreed with him - we should take it easy to not suffocate each other... but I am worried that this is an excuse to not get involved. 

Since then, we barely spoke by message - maybe one or two a day and sometimes nothing at all. I know he is the type of person who would get into his own world and not text much once he does something but also I wonder if he is not just freaking out about the situation and tries to run away. I want to give him the space he needs, but I am quite concerned. We can only see each other the weekends because of our jobs and I am suppose to see him this weekend. I really tend to overthink, but here I am quite lost.

What do you guys think? Anyone has faced a similar situation (either from Finn's point of view or mine)? Would you have any advice?

1qd501p,https://i.redd.it/2124fw27uedg1.png,Salt in the Bayou,"Chapter One: Salt in the Bayou



Dean Winchester smells it before he understands it.



Bon Temps breathes rot and sweetness in equal measure—magnolia crushed into the mud, old iron clinging to the air, sulfur threading through everything like a lie that’s been told too many times. The South never forgets its sins. It just lets them steep.



Dean kills the Impala’s engine outside Merlotte’s and listens. Cicadas scream like they’re warning each other. He adjusts the weight of the sawed-off under his jacket, jaw tight.



Bobby’s intel was garbage. Drained bodies. Burned symbols. A preacher found hollowed out like something chewed him clean. But Dean’s instincts don’t register possession.



This feels fed.



Inside, neon buzzes. Sweat. Beer. Fear pretending to be boredom. Vampires sip Tru Blood like it’s ironic. Humans look anywhere but at them.



Then the room bends.



She doesn’t glow—Dean’s not an idiot—but something in the air tilts when Sookie Stackhouse walks in. Blonde hair pulled back, eyes sharp and tired, body braced like the world’s already taken its swing and might come back for more.



She looks at him.



And stops.



Sookie’s heart stutters. Thoughts usually crash into her all at once—sticky, loud, careless. But the man by the bar?



Nothing.



Not empty.



Walled.



Locked down behind something furious and holy and screaming.



She’s never felt that before.



Dean smiles. Easy. Polite. A lie that’s kept him alive.

“Hey. You work here?”



“Sometimes,” she says, voice steady despite the cold crawling up her spine.



A waitress passes, thoughts buzzing about tips and teeth. Sookie exhales. “You’re not from around here.”



“That obvious?”



“It’s the quiet,” she says before she can stop herself.



Something flickers in his eyes. The smile tightens.

“Yeah. I hear that a lot.”



They sit. Talk. He orders whiskey like he’s done this in a thousand towns. She drinks beer and listens to the way his lies scrape—careful, practiced, meant to protect more than deceive.



Thunder rolls low outside.



The scream tears through the night ten minutes later.



Dean is moving before anyone reacts—gun in hand, chair scraping back. Sookie’s already standing, fear knifing through the room.



“That wasn’t human,” she says.



Dean meets her gaze. No denial. No comfort.

“Yeah. I know.”



They hit the tree line together. Mud drags at their boots. Fireflies scatter like dying stars. A symbol burns into the cypress—fresh, black, wrong. Enochian twisted with bayou magic, stitched together like scar tissue.



A body hangs from the branches. Drained. Empty-eyed.



Sookie gags.



Dean swears.



The preacher steps out of the dark wearing his own face wrong.

“You’re late, Winchester.”



Dean fires salt. The demon laughs as its skin blisters and heals.

“Different rules down here,” it croons. “Different god.”



It lunges for Sookie.



Dean doesn’t think. Knife flashes. Blood sprays hot and real. The demon shrieks and dissolves into smoke that sinks into the swamp like a promise.



Silence crashes down.



Sookie stares at Dean—blood-soaked, eyes wild, grief and violence carved deep. She should run.



Instead, she reaches for him.



“I heard it,” she whispers. “Not silence. Walls. And something screaming behind them.”



Dean swallows.

“Yeah,” he says. “That tracks.”



The air between them snaps—electric, dangerous.



Whatever he brought to Bon Temps isn’t leaving.



And neither, she realizes, is she.



Chapter Two: Blood Knows Blood



Bon Temps doesn’t sleep.



It sinks.



Night presses low as Dean crouches by the swamp, flashlight cutting through mist, stomach knotted. The mark on the cypress is clearer now—spirals folded into Enochian like something learned God’s language just to defile it.



“This ain’t standard,” Dean mutters.



Bobby wipes sweat from his neck. “That’s because it ain’t Hell’s. Bayou folk been feedin’ things like this since before demons learned how to unionize.”



Sookie stands apart, shields raised. The swamp hums under her skin.



“It eats blood,” she says. “Not human. Vampires. Demons. Anything that doesn’t belong.”



Dean turns sharply. “You hear that?”



“I hear everything,” she says. “I choose what to share.”



Bill Compton steps into the light, dread etched into his stillness.

“I’ve seen that mark before,” he says. “During the war. Nests went dry overnight.”



Pam appears, unimpressed and lethal.

“If it eats vampires, kill it.”



Eric watches the trees. “If it’s feeding, it’s calling.”



“Calling what?” Sookie asks.



Eric’s smile is thin. “The end.”



Dean feels the click in his chest. Apocalypse-adjacent. Again.



He and Sookie move together without discussion. The swamp wants them. Pulls at their feet.



“You should’ve told me,” Dean says quietly.



“I should have,” she admits. “People don’t like being seen.”



“Yeah,” he murmurs. “No kidding.”



They find the shack half-sunk in water. Blood drips from the porch. Not human.



Inside, copper and incense choke the air. The vessel lies split open. The mark is carved again—deeper. Pulsing.



Sookie staggers as alien hunger slams into her mind—vast, patient, rooted.



Dean catches her. Pulls her close.



Her shields crack.



She feels him.



The grief. The rage. The iron control barely holding back a lifetime of screaming.



“You’re loud,” she whispers.



“So are you,” he breathes.



Thunder breaks.



Dean kisses her like a warning and a vow—salt and blood and desperation. She answers without thinking, grounding herself in the reality of him.



When they pull apart, the danger has teeth now.



Eric’s voice cuts through the trees.

“You’re running out of time.”



Dean exhales.

“Yeah. Story of my life.”



Sookie takes his hand.

“Then let’s finish it.”



The swamp listens.



Chapter Three: The Thing Beneath the Water



By dawn, two vampires are gone.



By dusk, four more.



No ash. No scorch. Just folded clothes by the water like offerings.



Bill stands on Sookie’s porch as night falls.

“This isn’t a predator,” he says. “It’s a custodian.”



Dean frowns. “Of what?”



“Thresholds,” Bill replies. “Borders. It wakes when the world starts to tilt.”



Bobby confirms it over bad reception.

“Gatekeeper. Predates Hell’s bureaucracy. Feeds when seals loosen.”



Dean stares at the water between the trees. The weight settles in his chest.



Sookie steps closer. “You’re thinking about leaving.”



“I bring endings,” he says quietly. “You shouldn’t be collateral.”



She plants her hands on his chest. “You don’t get to decide who I am.”



Eric arrives, eyes sharp. “It’s moving. The water’s receding.”



Stone rises from the swamp—etched with burning sigils.



Something exhales below.



Dean tightens his grip on his gun. On Sookie’s hand.



“Alright,” he says. “Let’s kill a gate.”



Chapter Four: When Angels Don’t Come



The swamp parts.



Stone older than land breathes under moonlight.



Lafayette stands at the edge, eyes black, smile wrong.



The gatekeeper wears him like a crown.



“You see clearer than you know,” it says to Sookie.



Eric attacks. Hits an invisible wall. Breaks.



Sookie’s shields melt. The world aligns around her.



“She’s the beacon!” Bobby shouts.



Bill steps across the salt.



“I’m sorry,” he says.



He bleeds onto the stone.



The ground sings.



The seal stabilizes—wrong. Incomplete.



Dean is thrown back, blood in his mouth.



Sookie sees everything. Dean’s terror is the worst of it.



Don’t, he thinks. Please.



She understands then.



Love is leverage.



The gatekeeper retreats—satisfied.



Bill doesn’t rise.



Dean holds Sookie like the world might take her.



Above them, the sky stays empty.



No angels come.



Chapter Five: What the Water Takes



The swamp doesn’t just open.



It remembers how.



Stone ribs surface slowly, each inch dragged up through centuries of rot and drowned prayer. Roots recoil like nerves severed too cleanly. The water doesn’t splash—it peels, as if reality itself is being unzipped.



The gatekeeper rises again wearing Lafayette’s body like a sin that fits too well.



Not rebuilt—repurposed.



Bones show through skin etched with crawling sigils. His mouth moves a half-second behind the voice, like the thing inside him is still learning how to speak flesh. Every breath he takes smells like brine and graves.



“You hurt me,” it says, sounding amused. “That was unwise.”



Dean steps forward anyway.



Pain sings through his ribs. Blood leaks warm into his eye. The Colt is heavy—older now, like it knows what it’s being asked to judge.



Sookie stands beside him, trembling not with fear but with overload. Her power doesn’t reach outward anymore—it sinks. Every lock, every threshold, every screaming seam in the world hums inside her bones.



“It’s not just one gate,” she whispers. “It’s all of them. It’s…everywhere it’s starving.”



The gatekeeper turns its attention to her fully.



Pressure drops like the bottom falling out of the world.



Dean hears it then—not with his ears but with the part of him that remembers Hell:

the sound of waiting hunger.



“You could feed us forever,” it tells Sookie gently. “You were made wrong on purpose.”



Dean fires.



The Colt doesn’t strike flesh.



It strikes permission.



Reality convulses.



The sigils explode into light so bright it burns shadows into Dean’s vision. The gatekeeper shrieks—not in pain, but in violation. Its shape tears away from Lafayette in screaming sheets of shadow, dragging memories with it—floods, wars, mass graves, seals breaking one by one like knuckles under a hammer.



The swamp boils.



Sookie feels it latch onto her mind—desperate now, feral. She sees what it truly is.



Not a god.

Not a demon.



A warden built to starve.



And it wants a replacement.



She turns to Dean, sobbing. “It needs someone who can hear it. Someone who can stand between worlds.”



Dean is already cutting his palm.



“No,” she gasps.



“Yeah,” he says, voice wrecked. “Kinda my thing.”



Human blood hits the stone and screams.



The gatekeeper snaps toward him, ravenous. Dean feels the lock bite—feels the threshold recognize him like an old enemy. Hell surges close enough to taste.



Sookie screams his name—



—and then she does the impossible.



She steps inside his walls.



Not tearing them down.

Not breaking them.



Standing with him.



She wraps her mind around his screaming, his iron, his grief—and holds. Together, they shove the gatekeeper back into its cage, forcing the seals closed one by one like coffin lids slammed by sheer refusal.



The swamp howls.



Then—



Silence.



Heavy. Expensive.



When the water finally settles, Lafayette lies breathing. Alive.



Bill does not.



Dawn crawls in like it isn’t sure it’s welcome.



Aftermath: The Shape of Staying



Dean doesn’t sleep for thirty-six hours.



When he finally does, it’s on Sookie’s couch—boots still on, gun within reach, blood dried black on his knuckles. He dreams of water filling his lungs, of doors slamming shut with his name carved into them.



He wakes choking.



Sookie is there instantly, hands on his face, grounding him.



“You’re here,” she says. “You’re here.”



He clutches her like he’s drowning. She lets him.



Later, when the sun is higher and the world pretends to function, they sit on the porch steps. Bandages. Coffee gone cold. The swamp quiet in a way that feels like surveillance.



“You almost died,” she says.



He snorts. “Narrowing it down?”



She doesn’t smile.



“I felt it,” she says softly. “When you bled for the lock. It wanted you. You fit too well.”



Dean looks out at the trees. “Yeah. I get that a lot.”



Silence stretches.



Then she says it—the thing neither of them has wanted to name.



“If you stay,” she says, “this won’t be safe. Not for you. Not for me.”



He turns to her fully. Eyes bare. Honest in a way that costs him.

“Has it ever been?”



She searches his face—sees the future written in scars and choices and inevitable goodbyes.



And still—



She takes his hand.



“Then stay anyway.”



He kisses her like it’s not a promise.



Like it’s a decision.



Epilogue: Dean Winchester



I’ve left towns like this before.



Packed up the Impala. Burned the salt lines. Told myself it was better not to look back.



Bon Temps doesn’t let you do that.



The swamp watches. Not hostile. Just…aware. Like it knows I bled for it and hasn’t decided if that makes me friend or debt.



Sookie’s asleep inside. I can hear her breathing through the screen door. Steady. Alive. Changed.



So am I.



I tell myself I’m staying to make sure the seals hold.

Tell myself it’s temporary.

Tell myself a lot of things.



Truth is—I’ve been a threshold my whole life. A door monsters like to knock on. A lock that keeps breaking under my name.



She didn’t fix that.



She stood in it with me.



That’s worse.



That’s everything.



The world didn’t end. Again. It never does when you expect it to. It just shifts, quiet and mean, waiting for the next crack.



If it comes back—

If Hell pushes—

If the gates start screaming again—



I’ll be here.



Salt in the bayou.

Blood on my hands.

Love like a loaded gun I refuse to put down.



And for once—

As much as I adore cuddle time with her, recently it's even been a job for me to drink my cup of coffee in peace without holding her. We were thinking a baby swing might give me a little break. We are looking for swings that are safe and comofrtable for baby, and electric swinging for times when I need two hands. Please share some recommendations. I've seen some good stuff from momzoy and fisher price. Have anyone of you used these? would love to know what worked for you. Thanks",2,1768438100.0,newborns,2,1.0,False

Since then I have had some really good experiences, as well as some stressful ones. I got a lot of experience, job hopped for 2 years and now make £50k with other benefits, good work life balance, opportunity for career growth and more. I recognise how great of a position I am in and I am grateful for it each day, but I feel so lost and I hope what I am saying resonates with some people here.

I firstly want to say that I haven't reached where I am completely unscathed. The reality is that I am tired, burned out, hurting, just like many of us are. I am tired of the difficult bosses, co-workers, responding to organisational change, all the issues that covid brought, the world in general and so much more my therapist is probably tired of hearing me bitch about. I also ended a relationship last year and have made the choice to distance myself from old friends for a number of reasons (grown apart, didn't feel good being around them, etc) so im going through a very transitional stage in my life. Throughout this time I've always been interested in taking care of myself, and I have been a fan of the channel for many years, genuinely implementing what Dr K's been saying.

I do want to keep working on my career but I don't feel motivated like I used to due to so many bad experiences. I've struggled to make friends outside of online spaces, at work I actively avoid certain toxic people and even work in a quiet room to avoid them (also ADHD and maybe autistic). Nothing work related excites me anymore.

This is kinda true for my hobbies as well. I make music and am pretty good at it, I also used to make youtube videos and did pretty well there too. I just don't enjoy it the same way I used to. I have a lot of ideas and even when I narrow down on something, I give up really early. I have this overwhelming feeling to conserve energy rather than expel it doing something that I probably won't be consistent with, especially when work leaves me EXHAUSTED at the end of the week.

I've been focusing a lot on nutrition and health lately, its made me happier for sure, but I need more than this. I need to find something that makes me click, or understand better why my usual hobbies and passions aren't clicking like they used to. I could very well be depressed from all these overwhelming experiences, as well as other issues that are too long to write here.

To sum up, it feels like I have reached a mountain summit with cuts, scrapes, bruises and open wounds all over my body.

Whenever I tell people about this problem, there's a 50/50 chance they will say ""you are doing so much better than most people your age, wake up and smell the coffee"" and thats true for my career yes, but my social life/support network is definitely lacking. I feel so sorry for the fact that my last two relationships didn't work out, and I wish my family wasn't so toxic.

Motivated partly by compassion toward him, and partly by an enduring attachment, clearly. It's also hard to blow off someone who keeps trying to at least give the appearance of apologizing to you.  
  
He still did the same bullshit as always: trying to weasel out of acknowledging and accepting full responsibility for harm caused. That's why I need to be careful; not ever see him as a friend. But as an acquaintance, I'm glad that things can finally calm down and I don't have to feel anxious every time i'm around him.  
  
The problem though, is he seems to immediately to seek the next thrill. Repeatedly last night he has hit on me, asking whether he can kiss me, asking why not, asking whether there is a chance for anything to happen, insisting to walk me home ""with no ulterior motive""… he just keeps going back and forth between “I'm not trying to do anything” and very clearly trying to do something. I ignored his good night text because come on now.  
  
Hopefully it doesn't escalate, because currently I can't deal with the prospect of having to shut him down more aggressively.  
  
After journaling the above in the AM, i just met him for coffee in the PM. Same deal – him bargaining; me holding the line. At one point, i even had to lie. He asked whether I ever miss “it.” unfortunately, he's too immature to hold both truths at the same time: that of course i miss our affection, sex, cuddles, and everything good about our relationship, but that i also do not and will not deign to give in, ever. He would take it as a sign to keep pushing, even against all his better judgment. Sigh. The duality of **Name Redacted**.  
  
I did torture both of us with a very sweet hug (our winter coats acting as body condoms at least, but his was unzipped and I could smell his cologne and sense the presence of his whole torso behind layers of clothes and cold air.) An itinerant passerby squawked that one ought to “get a baby in there” (!) (???) which kind of killed the mood but was hilarious in its own right.

Drickle (formerly BONOMI), a coffee-first beverage QSR brand, has successfully raised nearly ₹6 crore in seed funding through equity.

This round saw participation from a distinguished group of angel investors and operators, including Param Kandhari, Naresh Krishnaswamy, Abhinav Mathur, Hemanshu Jain, Vinay Bhopatkar, Vaibhav Sisinty, Dalvir Suri, Rishit Jhunjhunwala, along with Shaili Chopra via Ideabaaz.

This follows their earlier ₹5.3 crore raise in April 2025, with an additional ₹50 lakh extension.

The fresh capital will be strategically deployed to:
• Expand Drickle’s compact-format outlet network across Bengaluru
• Strengthen backend manufacturing capabilities
• Build strong leadership and operations teams
• Invest in marketing and brand-building initiatives

Founded by Rahul Nijhawan and Vardhman Jain Drickle currently operates seven outlets in Bengaluru, offering coffee-first beverages priced between ₹100–150. Their in-house manufacturing facility enables asset-light operations and better margin control, positioning the brand for scalable growth.

This funding marks a significant milestone for Drickle as it accelerates its vision of delivering premium, accessible coffee experiences in India’s bustling QSR market.

Reddit is such a popular platform for crypto and if we go off the fact Shib, Pepe and Doge had insane Reddit communities then the next 1000x will also have one. 

Think of which coin you see the most, with the most organic engagement(not just upvotes but comments as well). If you don’t know you can easily have a look.

Do you have a coin in mind?

**It should be Kendu**

Kendu is easily the strongest community on Reddit, with both upvotes, post frequency and comments destroying each and every other project out there! This isn’t PvP, I am just stating a simple fact.

* Kendu is also the strongest community on Stocktwits and one of the strongest on X
* Kendu is the 2^(nd) coin to ever reach 50k Certik upvotes, the only other coin to ever manage this was the one and only Pepe
* Kendu has a higher Telegram activity than SPX, Giga and Mog
* Kendu has released over 20 community led IRL initiatives from Pickleball tournaments in India to merch, to beer, to coffee
* Featured on a Coinbase Advert front and centre

 From **Proof of Humanity** which retail are gonna love, since it proves we are real people who are not going anywhere, to social media efforts that mirror Shib's, Kendu has absolutely everything

We are an insanely strong community and if history has taught us anything, it's that community is all you need.

The food was better than we expected, so I decided to post about it It’s next door to the Copa lounge, and occupies a long narrow space on the second floor and shares the view of the terminal and tarmac.  One nice feature are the lounge chairs at the rear of the lounge that let you relax and put your feet up on a ledge, overlooking the terminal.  They looked like a great place to spend a layover. There were 3 dishes avilable to order from  the QR code on the table, I chose the chicken in creole sauce with potato puree sautéed vegetables.  It was tasty, like good cafeteria food, and arrived hot in less than 10 minutes.  It was a larger portion than ai was served on my Delta flight and about as tasty. There was also a pasta with garlic and oil and chicken with rice. The buffet was mainly plant based: quinoa salad with vegetables, a pasta salad in cream sauce, salad greens with sliced tomatoes and cumbers, and finger sandwiches with cheese and a thin slice of ham, and a squash soup that my wife enjoyed.     There was a full bar with a limited but workable srlection, a coffee machine for espresso based drinks that I didn’t try, a fridge with typical soft drinks a 2 juice dispensers.  The staff wasn’t effusive but nobody had a bad attitude, and the lunge was clean.

1qd4i4x,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qd4i4x,Bought new Mazzer Philos but looks used? Am I crazy?,"I’m relatively new to espresso… starting getting into it because of my wife. 
We ended up buying a new mazzer Philos grinder and were really excited to get it. 
It finally arrived and upon unboxing it, there were coffee grinds in the wrapping around the machine and the hopper chute/collar at the top. And after taking off the front to check the burrs, there’s even more coffee grinds inside. 

We followed up with the company we bought it from (we’re in Canada), and they told us it’s brand new and they said 1 in 10 machines goes through QC so trace amounts may remain inside. 

There’s definitely way more than just “trace” amounts (the picture doesn’t show the extent of it well and some just fell out when I opened it) and doesn’t look like there’s was an effort to clean the burrs inside. 
Seems like a sketch explanation to me.

I know it’s probably okay - they said I still have warranty - but I paid for a new machine, and this looks like an open box return.

I also looked at a few unboxing videos and no one else had this, so I do feel cheated. 

Is the company BS’ing us or should we be okay with it?

Anyone else who bought a mazzer Philos experience this???

Thanks for any insight you can provide!

Online Dating, Real Connections, and Modern Meetups","Dating apps have quietly reshaped how people meet, flirt, and look for casual hookups today. What used to depend on chance encounters now starts with a swipe, a profile, or a simple local listing. Online dating feels less formal and more like everyday conversation, where two strangers can decide within minutes if they want coffee, company, or just a late-night chat.

Many users move between mainstream dating apps and community boards like Doublelist, not chasing anything dramatic, just hoping for honest, uncomplicated connections. The appeal isn’t only romance.. it’s convenience, control, and the freedom to meet people outside familiar circles.

Still, the culture around casual dating has matured. People talk more openly about boundaries, safety, and expectations before any meetup happens. Dating apps in 2026 aren’t only about quick matches; they reflect how relationships have become flexible and personal. Whether someone wants a real relationship or a casual hookup, the digital world simply provides another doorway to human stories.

I didn’t even want to get pregnant but decided id let my husband try. I love my husband and giving him a child sounds cool but the whole pregnancy thing sucks really really really bad.

I also get mean comments from family since I made the mistake of telling my parents:

“You know your husband can leave you at any time right?”

“You better hope the baby is healthy.”

“All your cousins miscarried you know.”

“You can’t depend on your husband, you can only trust yourself.”

Mind you, I have had a long 13 year successful engineering career with large savings, bought a house and car, married my soulmate with amazing healthcare benefits and job stability. I even am now employed with a finance firm working on licensing.

Aside from all those mean comments, i have to worry about my little embryo not forming well, or something going wrong, all the gross tests they make you do, and all the judgement that comes with childbirth methods and (not) breast feeding.

It’s so insane to me. Why does everyone have such strong opinions on our bodies and methods of childbirth and shit like that?

Trying to understand his intention,"I met this guy during my exchange semester, and we spent a lot of time together both alone and later with his close friends he introduced me with. When we were alone, there was clear chemistry and tension: same interests, same life situations, same humor, long conversations that would be fun, intellectual, emotional with teasing, eye contacts, sitting close, walking me home, complimenting and just genuine flirting following. He was very interested in my dating life and knew that I’ve never had a boyfriend, which makes his level of attentiveness and restraint more noticeable. He often commented on how things would be different if I lived in the city or spoke the language.
His friends clearly noticed something as well — they teased us, talked to me a lot, and I often felt like the “new person” being observed. Even then, he stayed close and attentive, sometimes subtly protective in public.
Outside of this, he showed interest in quieter but deliberate ways: he mentioned me to his mom, listened to music i would recommend him, and followed up on things I mentioned. These actions felt intentional rather than casual.
Despite this, nothing ever escalated physically. No kiss, no direct move even when timing and proximity allowed it. Texting followed a similar pattern: playful and flirty, then distant, followed by renewed engagement. When I would give him space he would always call, text and initiate hangouts. After I left the country, he became more openly flirty; after I returned, the tension remained but still no action. Last hang out he called to meet for coffee, which was relaxed and genuinely nice.
What I’m trying to understand is the discrepancy between consistent emotional/behavioral interest and the absence of physical escalation.

Was he interested?
Was he intentionally keeping things ambiguous due to circumstances?

All blood work results are good except high LDL / Non HDL. Latest results showed calculated LDL at  3.8 mmol/Litre [I think that is 147 mg/dl in US] and non-HDL at 4.53 mmol/Litre [175 mg/dl].

Have been on serious dietary plan for 1.5 years (Portfolio diet), tracking with cronometer. Stopped alcohol, drink filtered coffee, cut saturated fat to 8g, no meat, no dairy, beans, tofu, nuts, fibre, veg, fruit, omega 3 supplements,  etc... Very disappointingly, no real change in numbers. 

So it's statin time - after discussing with GP, even though 10 year CVD risk will only drop 2% with good results, it seemed a good idea on balance to take a statin, given life expectancy etc. 

My problem is that to my surprise he has prescribed a starting dose of 40mg, even though the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE - I'm in the U.K.) clearly recommends a starting dose of 20mg for primary prevention (i.e. when there is no history of heart disease). 

Statin / Atorvastatin risks increase with DOSAGE, AGE, and for female gender... So I would prefer starting at 20mg, getting things checked in 3 months and increasing if reduction is not significant.

Hey Maximizame fam! 👋

Ever feel like you're just coasting, or maybe even treading water? We're all about growth here, right? It got me thinking about how easy it is to get stuck in a rut, even with the best intentions. Life throws curveballs, and sometimes our ""1.0"" version just isn't equipped to handle the new challenges.

That's why I'm buzzing about this ""Upgrade Your Life 2.0"" mindset. It's not about a complete overhaul every few months, but about incorporating *small, consistent daily hacks* that nudge us towards our best selves. Think of it like software updates for your own operating system.

Here are a few things I’ve been playing with that have made a surprising difference:

*   **The ""Morning Anchor"" Ritual:** Instead of grabbing your phone first thing, try dedicating 5-10 minutes to something grounding. This could be stretching, a few deep breaths, journaling a single positive affirmation, or just enjoying a quiet cup of coffee. It sets a calmer, more intentional tone for the rest of your day.
*   **Micro-Learning Bursts:** Got 15 minutes while waiting for something? Instead of scrolling aimlessly, dive into a podcast on a topic you're curious about, read a chapter of a non-fiction book, or watch a short educational video. Those little knowledge seeds add up!
*   **The ""Exit Strategy"" for Overwhelm:** When you feel that familiar pull of stress or anxiety creeping in, have a pre-planned ""exit"" ready. This could be stepping outside for fresh air, listening to one uplifting song, or doing a quick 1-minute meditation. It’s about having a built-in pause button.
*   **""Gratitude Capture"" Moments:** Before bed, take a moment to jot down 1-3 things you're genuinely grateful for that day. It can be as simple as a good meal or a funny conversation. This rewires your brain to focus on the positive, even on tough days.

These aren't grand gestures, but the cumulative effect is powerful. It's about building resilience, sharpening focus, and frankly, just making life feel a little more… optimized!

Sometimes, though, life's challenges can feel a bit too big to tackle with just daily hacks. If you're feeling stuck or overwhelmed and need a more structured approach to navigating difficult emotions and building a stronger foundation for your mental well-being, I've found [this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme) to be incredibly helpful. It’s about having professional support when you need it most.

What are some of your favorite daily hacks that have helped you ""upgrade""? I'd love to hear what's working for you all! Let’s keep the optimization momentum going! 👇",1,1768436048.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

Hey everyone, first time posting here but I've been lurking on r/ for a bit cuz I'm kinda stressed about this whole thing. So a little background on me: I'm 19F, originally from Germany (born there and all), but my family moved to Russia when I was like 6, so I basically grew up there went to school, learned the language, all that jazz. Now I'm in the US on a student visa to start uni next semester in Mississippi (super excited but also nervous af about the heat lol). I haven't actually started classes yet, just got here a couple weeks ago to settle in, find housing, that kinda stuff.

Anyway, the reason I'm posting is I'm paranoid about ICE and like, staying on the right side of immigration rules. I know I'm here legally with my F-1 visa and everything, but I've heard stories from friends back home about people getting in trouble for dumb stuff, and with my background (German passport but Russian upbringing), I worry if that complicates things? Like, do they look at where you grew up or just your nationality? Idk, maybe I'm overthinking it.

What are some practical tips to make sure I don't accidentally screw up and get on their radar? Stuff like:

- How strict are they about working off-campus? I was thinking of maybe picking up a part-time gig at a coffee shop or something once school starts, but only if it's allowed. I know the rules say no for the first year, right? But are there exceptions or ways to get permission?

- Driving—do I need an international license or can I just use my Russian one for a bit? Mississippi seems chill but I don't wanna risk getting pulled over and having it turn into an immigration thing.

- Travel within the US: Is it safe to fly domestically or road trip to nearby states? I wanna visit New Orleans or something fun before classes kick in, but heard about checkpoints.

- Social stuff: Hanging out with friends, parties, etc. Obviously I'm not gonna do anything illegal, but like, if there's alcohol involved (I'm over 18 but under 21 here, which is weird), does that flag anything for internationals?

- And just general advice on keeping my visa in good standing? Like, how often do I need to check in with the international office at school? What if I wanna extend my stay or something later?

Sorry if this is a ramble, I'm just trying to be super careful cuz I really wanna make this work America seems awesome so far, the food is insane (tried BBQ for the first time, mind blown), and I don't wanna mess it up over something stupid. Any experiences from other internationals, especially Europeans or people with mixed backgrounds? Thanks in advance, y'all are lifesavers! ❤️",0,1768435915.0,legaladvice,3,0.44,False

I’ve worked as a barista and studied coffee extensively, but I’ve never actually done the roasting myself.

I’m considering starting with a Giesen W6A (6 kg) roaster. My main question is, are there specific temperature and time guidelines for achieving certain roast levels with this machine, or is it more of an experience based approach? How do I achieve the roast levels I am aiming for with consistency?",1,1768435807.0,roasting,0,1.0,False
1qd403j,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1qd403j/sp_it_takes_an_army/,[SP] It Takes an Army,"Every morning it takes an army of little faeries to get me out of bed.

They rappel down the bedposts at dawn, forming ranks at my feet as if I’m lying prone on a battlefield instead of a mattress. I keep my eyes shut while they assemble, but there is no point pretending I’m asleep.

The commanding officer is a redcap with a mouth like two maggots wriggling over a row of yellow teeth. He’s not the prettiest wake-up call, but he’s qualified. He barks orders in a language that just sounds like a couple of bluebottles trapped in a jar. I wait patiently for him to finish. Waiting is one of the few things I am still good at.

When they move me, it is efficient. Precise. Hands under shoulders. Claw-tipped fingers at the ankles. No ceremony here. They’ve done this before. By now my body is just like any old piece of furniture that’s a little rickety. Mornings are the worst.

Once I’m herded into a sitting position, I ask none of them in particular, “Where are we off to today?” The faeries ignore me, too busy fighting off the dog for my robe again. A few sound like they're arguing as they clean the empty cans and an unfinished bowl of ramen on the nightstand. I wait patiently for them to finish because Interrupting will only irritate them.

*“Forward!”* the redcap commands, and they march me toward the bathroom with a sort of grim determination. A few peel off to manage operations: soap distribution, toothbrush control, shower calibration. They’re efficient, if not gentle, as they lather and scrub.

One faery loses his footing on the rim of the tub and I hear the quick *plunk!*, the tiny curse, the brief embarrassed silence.

“Shouldn’t have stood there, brother,” I say, because talking helps.

Another gets too close to the drain, which to these guys probably looks more like a suckling vortex. Gone, like the snap of your fingers, just like that. Down the pipes, wings and all. Somewhere, I imagine, a faerie is wading through sewer water praying they won’t be reprimanded for desertion.

Now I’m dressed, scrubbed raw, my skin pink and cleaner than a nun’s breeches. The faeries line up on the counter, glimmering and smug as they look at their hard work and discipline in the fogged mirror.

On the bus, the faeries have reorganized into two ranks: one guarding my head, the other managing posture. The redcap marches across my shoulder, issuing sharp instructions. Everything must be orderly and tight. They tug at my cheeks until something like a smile settles in place. A passing woman with a tote bag gives me a scathing glare and the faeries beam. Mission accomplished.

Then, in the waiting room at the interview, the air smells of burnt coffee, leather, and too much disinfectant. The faeries keep busy picking lint and dog hair from my lap, pushing stray hair back behind my ear tying and re-tying the laces on my shoes until they're the proper set of bunny ears.

“Don’t embarrass me,” I whisper-hiss.

The redcap salutes with something that looks suspiciously like a middle finger.

When my name is finally called, the faeries snap to attention. Two anchoring my jawline for symmetry and one perched above my eyebrow like a correctional officer. They make minor adjustments as I walk in, pulling my lips upward, flexing my shoulders, rolling them back to rid me of the hump forming there.

“Good morning, miss!” The interviewer greets me a bit too toothy and bright this early, but the faeries do their best to copy her. I can’t stop staring at the red lipstick stuck on her front tooth.

“Good morning.” 

It feels almost natural until a faery at the corner of my eyelid stumbles and loses grip. My right eye twitches like it wants to flee.

“How’s everything going today?”

“Fine,” I lie. The faery in charge of smiling yanks upward again. The corners of my mouth stumble under the strain. God, this sucks.

The interviewer asks about passion projects. This is where some of the faeries really try to shine. Everybody wants to impress the commander. Prove they can lead too. One suggests helping animals. Another pushes for environmental or maybe coding; both are very hot right now. A third proposes firebombing the entire building. But instead I tell the interviewer I like to read, which seems the safest compromise at the moment.

Her chin dips. She jots something down I can’t see.

A faery slides halfway into my collar and tugs at my head to maintain what I’m assuming means appropriate eye contact. Another uses my spine as a ladder, pinching in between each vertebra until my back goes rifle-rod straight. They’re obsessed with good posture.

Then the interviewer says something faintly ridiculous, but it elicits a noise from my throat. Not a very pretty one. It’s loud and sudden, cracked, and embarrassingly honest.

The room goes so silent you could hear even a faery fart. Even the redcap is unsure what the protocol is. It’s the first time I’ve caught them off guard.

The interviewer looks confused but smiles back anyway. Maybe she thinks I’m not the right fit for her team. Maybe she’s right.

The faeries yammer and drill singing cadence after we leave.

“You were terrible,” I tell them.

They sing on.

I cross the parking lot into the grocery store, shoelaces dragging on the dirty asphalt like leftover strings from a balloon. Inside the grocery store, the fluorescent lights flicker and buzz. My cart squeaks ahead of me, one wheel wobbling rebelliously, and the faeries force me to abandon it for a smoother, less noisy one.

The redcap perches on the cart's handle, pointing with a gnarled claw at the produce aisles. Each fire team he sends moves with a purpose. Only the essentials today.

One group scales the cereal boxes, wrestling with the brightly colored packaging. A faery with sickle-shaped wings tugs at a box of sugary peanut butter puffs, grunting as it topples into the cart. Another, more pragmatic faery hoists a bag of oats into the metal basket and glares at the other before tossing the puffs out. Clearly some of us weren’t paying attention during the commander's briefing.

In the dairy section, I can’t decide which creamer to get. They’ve got every kind of flavor you can imagine nowadays. The faeries lend a hand by propping up my wrist, steadying my grip, and aiming for the nearest sweet cream or else I'd probably just stand there all day, staring at the expiration dates until the store closed.

At the checkout, the cashier, a bored patron with neon nails, rings up my items with mechanical efficiency. The faeries form a perimeter around my wallet, one diving into the coin purse to fish out exact change.

""That'll be $43.47,"" she says, and when I hand her the quarter, two dimes, and several sleek copper pennies, our hands make contact for a second.

The change rattles and falls from palm to counter, and I immediately apologize, though clumsily, tripping over my words, but still managing to speak to them, slipping past the very bars of my teeth.

She laughs as she counts an extra penny somehow. She places it face up again on the floor. “My gammy says it’s only good luck this way.” She then tells me she likes my suit. I reply with something about her nails, but it isn’t very clever and I think I hear one of the faeries snicker. Thankfully, the cashier seems oblivious to their antics.

Back in my apartment, the door clicks shut with a contented sigh. The faeries disperse, some collapsing onto the kitchen counter in exhaustion while others scouting the fridge for dinner prep. I unpack the groceries methodically, their tiny forms assisting: one balancing an onion on its head to pass it to me, another wrestling with a stubborn jar lid.

Dinner is simple—a la pasta from a box and red sauce from a tin can. With the intensity of a drill sergeant loading mortar rounds, the redcap watches the boiling water, yelling warnings as steam ascends. A few faeries sound off ditties while stirring, their voices blending with the bubble of the pot. Eating alone at the table, I feel the day's toll start to wear me down like ice cream down a cone on a summer day. The dog licks my hand, and the faeries jump to his bowl, overfilling his dish with kibble, and I just can’t bring myself to care.

I’m craving a cigarette, but these guys are relentless in getting me to quit. I catch one of them trying to flush the pack down the toilet and about knock him in myself as I lunge for the last un-flushed stick. “Don’t push it,” I tell them in my best drill sergeant impression, and it seems to do the trick. One of them snaps his fingers and the fingertip ignites into a red-hot ember. “Now that’s more like it.”

I’m all too aware of their vibrant bodies pulsing around the small space right now. The fluttering of their wings, the grating child-like voices nitpicking at every one of my discrepancies right down to the smallest string hanging from my shirt. The dog just barfed all over my new rug, which causes an uproar and I can feel the yolk in my head scramble when the phone rings.

And rings and rings and rings until a faery finally pulls it off the receiver and forces me to answer.

“Hello?”

*“Hi, is this so and so?”*

“Hi, yes, this is she.”

“*I’m calling about our interview this morning and I just wanted to let you know—”*

With a pull of the cord, the listening fairies are sent sprawling into the adjacent room. 

*“—that we are so pleased to offer you the position! If you have a minute, I’d love to go over a few clerical things here…”*

Twenty minutes later I hang up the phone and do a little jig. I wait for the faeries to tease me or join in but now I’ve noticed how unusually silent it is. Then I walk into the living room, and the majority save for the redcap standing duty are dozed off all over the couch, wings twitching, some farting in between nasally breaths, sometimes it’s worse than the damn dog. But that’s okay. I’ve got a job!

I watch them for a moment as a mother would her children. It’s strange to see them tired. For the first time, I realize I’ve never wondered what happens to them when I got to sleep. Maybe they never do, not fully. I do not wake them even with the news. Instead, I let them dream and wonder what kinds of dreams faeries have compared to mine. The redcap probably drills even in his sleep, and I respect that. It’s who he is, it’s his job, and he’s pretty damn qualified if you ask me.

I sit on the floor. The dog rests his chin on my knee, and I scratch the sweet spot under his chin. The redcap slides down my sleeve and collapses against my wrist for extra support. Ever the persistent trooper.

“You can stop now,” I tell him.

The redcap seems assured after watching my face and salutes my command. He looks thinner, dimmer, and less like a soldier now, more like a dust mote losing interest.

Something happens next. As if on command, they vanish. First a beautiful shimmer, then into nothingness. The kitchen falls quiet again, the only sounds being the fridge humming, the dog’s slow breaths, and the slow beat of my heart.

I wake the next morning expecting noise. Orders. Laughter. Bluebottle buzzing.

Nothing.

The bedroom is quiet in a way it hasn’t been in months. The light sneaks past the curtains and soothes my face. I breathe in, waiting for a command that doesn’t come. For a while I just lie there, waiting. Habit’s a strange comfort. Then, almost by accident, my arm moves. Then my legs. I swing my them off the bed and now my body feels reconnected, like it belongs to me again although it’s more awkward, clumsy, and heavier than I remember. No hands tug me forward. No voices shouting orders. Just me.

In the bathroom mirror, my reflection is plain and uncertain. My hair is caught in a mess of knotted shapes. Dried Saliva frames my cracked lips. I almost want to laugh. The sink water hisses to life when I turn the handle, and the sound fills the room like applause from some far-off distant land. Brushing my teeth takes some effort, but it’s fine. The silence settles around me, warm and cradling like honey.

Out of habit, I whisper, “Shoulders up, back straight.”

Nobody answers.

That’s all right.

I can’t even remember why I started watching porn or how really. Because I was sa’d around the ages of 6-9(I forgot the extacly age Because my memory is just fucked due to this experience) but if I can remember right, it started because I would watch YouTube videos like channels called adult swim and “Barbie videos” but heavily implied with adult themes such as sex. yes I would search the internet for videos with kissing, sex, all things like that. After that I decided to search sex on the internet and porn was the first website that came up and I started watching it and I remember I would watched like  everyday at one time on my iPad. I would  play with my Barbie dolls I would always make them kiss naked on the bed because it made me feel some type of enjoyment I liked this feeling

I was around 11-13 I started again. But I decided to stop but this is where my mental health starts slowly getting worse. I remember I was in my first year of secondary school and i wanted to be popular so badly I don’t remember why really but I think I wanted to just to be cool and have lots of friends. I had one group of friends that were “popular” and I out all my focus into them one of the members being a childhood friend. However slowly I wasn’t relating to any of them I didn’t know how to make them laugh and what to say in convos. Another girl joined the group, she was the type to not listen to teachers etc and I tired mimicking her by acting “cool”. I suddenly got accused of “talking bad about her” soon I lost all my friends and people from primary/ elementary  had already made friends and own groups I had nobody. And I already placed a bad look to my name because everyone saw my act of trying to act “tuff” and my reputation was ruined. One time I texted my parents that I couldn’t do it with all the shit they were giving me so I wanted to move schools and they ended up telling the school even after I told not too because then I am considered as a snitch or somthing. They came in school to talk to the teachers and they would just tell me to Ingore the and honestly the teachers trying to restore peace didn’t do anything and they also tired finding me new friends and just put me out to random groups but I wasn’t really confident so no of us was really like friends so I was really lonely and was just hanging out with anyone. Finally I made some friends. Back then I wasn’t majorly suicidal or depressed like how I am now but I started off as not to fear death anymore I was ready to die when the time came 


After 3 more years I suffered with teasing/bullying I guess from other kids especially boys in my class. I would be just walking home and they will be shouting my name asking if I would date them all that crap. And all my friend told me it was because I was quiet and they used that as a advantage because I never said anything but to mee it was because I was the ugliest to them in the class and I knew it I was. So I hate myself, my looks everything about me drives me crazy why am I like this.

In my third year of school, I began my exams and had lot of tests. I would constantly fail, even being moved from the classes for B-C students to D-E students and it really hurt after that work it felt painful and embarssing honestly. It had stuck with me ever since even if I managed to pass most of my exams. Fast forward to now I hate myself even more beacuse I basically goon every single day and it makes me feel like the worst christain ever. My realtionship with religion has been rocky I barely pray, barely read the bible etc always sin and never repent. Like I am scared of hell I am scared but I have just been getting more distant with religion. 

I want to kill myself I want to die but I know I want go to heaven probably. My parents have a massive role into this too. With mental health it would simply be “I am copying something I have seen on social media” now I need my phone searched and taken. I know they say this because even things like manga I asked for, it was because “ I was influenced by my other friends who also like anime and manga” “I have never liked it so this sudden interest I am copying it” even though I have told them I have watched anime far longer then most of my friends, if I bring up any of this mental issues they would say “you have never been like this” “it’s that phone feeding into your head” etc. that’s why I can’t go any type of therapy, I have no friends to talk to about this. I feel like I am about to explode. I am 16 and I wanted to try get a secret Job to pay for my own online therapy in secret but my parents are strict ealier this week I wasn’t even allowed to go to a collage meeting with my friend or go a coffee shop. When I want to go out it always ending up with “who, why, when” so I have given up going out with friends so I feel incredibly lonely.  it’s also made me develop a bit of anixey because I never go out when I do I feel like all eyes on me, the outfit I am wearing is weird, I don’t fit in, etc 

I am so loney yes I have few irl friends, online friends but it sounds bad but I have been craving to idk get groomed online at least they will treat me kind I know what groomers really do but idk about the sexual stuff I want someone to love me and talk to me when I need it I just want to be some friends constantly not like friends I just see in school and then bearly talk outside of school , not online terid that can just ghost me, someone who generally wants to be a really good friend to me 

So yeah I am really stuck and just wish I want born. I question a lot about god, why did I end up with parents like this, why couldn’t I have even one good trait in my life like being smart or pretty or having better parents. Some parents if their kids did sh even just few starches not even to deep they will be sending them to all the help professionals, even if the kid don’t want to. It’s not like that for me though. Why whole life I experienced a lot my mother also had breast cancer when I was like 5. Both my parents are immigrants it it took them ages to get work permission, so before that I was basically poor during my childhood, I don’t even know how we managed I know they got money from friends and people to help but I don’t know the full details 
 
I am really messed up I know I even left some details and try not made it sound as bad as what it actally this. Please don’t judge I am trying to kinda work on them 

If anyone has actually read this all to down here thanks I just need to get something off my chest yk. I hate this feeling of burying this all in my head. And if anyone even cares or wonder I am not like in any major danger right now I probably commit some time in the future or something just not now.  ",9,1768435412.0,SuicideWatch,3,1.0,False

Been to uni and failing 3 careers, job hoping due to boredom or being fired for low performance, having a hobby, hyperfixating on it for a couple of months and then abandon it forever with all the expenses included... 

Unfortunately where I live, there are barely any psychiatrist and getting medication is virtually impossible. Waiting lists are endless and there has been a shortage for a while. Getting the medication in my home country is much easier but it's a pain to travel with it, let alone how expensive is to go back and forth once a month, so no chance. 

After researching, I found that there are some ways to improve the symptoms without the meds, but not as effective as them. So, now I'm taking vitamin D (although in Northern Europe is a must because of lack of sunlight), a multi vit, Omega 3, NAC (n-acetylcysteine) after breakfast and Magnesium Glycinate before going to bed. I noticed the magnesium helped me get rid of the brain fog, although sometimes it comes back. 

I'm doing a course on IT to improve my CV for better job opportunities, 'cause I don't have the time or money for going to uni again. My job is quite demanding time-wise (12 hour shifts) but it's quite easy. I worked in IT for 8 years before switching to hospitality (funny part I'm on this job since 2021 lol), but in the future I would like to go back to IT because the job I have won't take me anywhere. 

Although, there's no way I can focus on the course, either I nod off or I zone out while on the Zoom conferences. My brain won't cooperate, regardless of how much coffee I had. 

I also have been procrastinating on two personal projects I have in mind in order to be making more money, nowadays I'm trying to save money to buy a house and travel a bit more before I get too old. 

This thing is ruining me. I hate seeing neurotypicals graduating, being successful on their business or having nice jobs and promotions.

The owners knew nothing about coffee and opened up a brand new shop and I was the one who helped them tremendously in how to do everything.I was promoted assistant manager 7 months after being there just now starting to make $15 an hour. I train every employee most never making coffee before or they get thrown in with another employee. We have a endless checklist for every shift ranging from 40-50 items to clean and do. For morning, mid shift and closing shift. But the boss anytime she comes in and works a shift she points out little things that aren’t even on the checklist and blames everyone that we “aren’t cleaning” something as simple as a simple drip on the walls. And she adds more and more things to this checklist where it’s almost impossible to complete on top of us being a very high volume shop. We don’t have the health inspection coming in as we don’t make any food inside the shop. When the checklist for the shift are completed she then complains we did it too quickly or not good enough. If we aren’t upselling enough we get yelled at, even when we are asking every customer. She constantly looking over everyone’s shoulder when they work and points out every single thing wrong. If you make a small mistake she makes you pull out you’re phone and calculate how much the mistakes cost if you made it everyday. If we get a 1 star review we all get yelled at and it’s always a customer who rates every company a 1 star, we have 4.9 stars and we are always over the top with every customer but if you get one single complaint all hell breaks loose. We also have a group chat that gets sent messages from the owners complaining at least five times a day and if you don’t respond back immediately she sends another one to everyone to respond. lease just got renewed and the landlord doesn’t  like the owners because they have essentially caused a lot of water damage to the building by not fixing a leak issue from the sink and they let it sit for almost a year. And an employee was actually the one to inform the issue to the landlord because it was so bad we were standing in 4 in water while taking a drive thru order. So to punish the owners he put on the lease no dog poop should be found in the small patch of grass expecting them to actually work and keep up with the outside of the shop but instead it has been added to the employees checklist to pick up dog poop, pull weeds, and leaf blow the outside. The owners come by everyday and stay for 4-5 hours in the lobby just on their phones. Then once they leave they ask an employee to do inventory for them. Me being a assistant manager I have no say so in anything. I don’t get to make the schedule, inventory is everyone’s responsibility now, anytime I give my opinion on something or give a recommendation it’s instantly shut down. I basically fear for my co workers everyday in hopes she doesn’t yell at them for something stupid. The customers even say to us how chaotic everything is when they are behind the bar and everyone is miserable when they are here. Customers have witness us get yelled at in front of everybody. She will say one thing and I will do it and the next it’s wrong. Everyone hates the place and leaves and she wonders why they left everyone else currently are only their because of me and other coworker. A lot of regulars tell me if I left they wouldn’t come back. I want to leave but if I leave she’s screwed running the place by herself and everyone would leave with me and so would the customers idk if I’m overreacting but all my co workers feel the same.

My partner and I (32F/31M) have lived in DT Toronto for just over a year. We've met some cool people, but we’re looking to expand our social circle and meet new (platonic) couples to hang out with.

A little about us:
We’re pretty easy going and fall into the ""active but also love a beer or coffee hangout just to chat"" category. We're both in tech and work the usual 9-5. We enjoy playing badminton, hiking, board games, exploring new cafes/brunch spots/restaurants, road trips, or just chilling with good company!

What we’re looking for:
Ideally, we’d love to meet other couples in a similar life stage, who share some of these interests. Whether it’s grabbing a coffee to see if we vibe, hitting a trail on a Saturday morning, or hosting a game night, we’re just looking for genuine, chill people to build some friendships with.

If any of this sounds like you, feel free to drop a comment or send a DM!

Withdrawal (irritability, insomnia, restlessness)
Cues and routines (coffee, driving, certain people/places)

Stop the “I ruined it” story. It's just a slip not the end.

Reset fast. Throw out what you bought, change the environment.
Use support again. If NRT helped before, go back to it (patch + gum/lozenge for sudden cravings).

Consignment sa part na they will give it back the baked goods to me at the end of the week kapag may natira. No commissions blah blah. Sabi nya pati, kung pwede raw tanggalin yung logo stickers sa packaging which I thought is sketchy kasi ang alam ko, consignment sya sa part na ibabalik yung products sakin kapag hindi nila naibenta so meaning, ako pa rin may-ari dapat ng baked goods na yun kung ibabalik sakin diba? 

  
Sabi ko pwede naman tanggalin though once na naideliver ko na yung baked goods, responsibility na nila yun tapos dapat kung ibabalik nila sakin, dapat pwede ko pa ibenta sa iba kasi sayang naman. THEN his reply was “Ganon po ba, sige po —” tapos binawasan nya yung quantity ng orders nya and na-move yung delivery date.

I've concentrated on myself and my passions. Practiced immense gratitude and shown up for my present life and all who walk with me through it with my whole heart.  

I've wished you the most amazing life and silently released you many times over, with the sky, the water, and the land bearing witness.  

It has made me so sad to pull away from you. I know I have nothing concrete to offer you, and you couldn't possibly need another friend in your life.  

... But now you're leaving, or perhaps already gone.  

You would think the distance wouldn't matter given the circumstances, but I'll just miss you even more, as immensely happy as I am for you.  

I wish I could have just said things plainly. I thought I did in the beginning. I think back then we still had a chance to be someone, anything, to one another.  

This kind of love I have for you, what I most yearned for was to be present with a kindred spirit. We could have shared a walk, stories, perspectives, our wins and our losses, our light and our dark.  

You know, there is probably nothing you could have said to me that would make me not care for you. (Except, maybe if you were too picky with your coffee. jk (: ). 

You gave me the courage to change the course of my life, and I'm so thankful for that.  

There was a time I thought I had to reason my feelings for you away, and I tried to justify that with hearsay, but none of it really matters. It didn't stop me from loving you because, frankly, it was stupid and trivial, and I just needed an excuse to let you go.  

I remain joyful, optimistic, and enamored with my present life. And I also do love you.  

Both can exist at the same time.  

Gods, please just let this be okay.

**Why This Pick?** 

The last 10 straight meetings between these two squads have seen at least 6 goals, friends. That said, Buffalo’s offense is looking a lot better than Philly’s these days. Having put at least 4 goals on the board in their last 6 straight wins (and I do think the home squad wins this encounter…), I like the  team total far better than I like the overall total – especially since the Flyers haven’t scored more than 2 goals in any of their last 3 outings.

[Sage Barista Pro],"I received my machine this evening, and having watched plenty of videos in anticipation, purchasing the right bits to go with it (WDT, timing coffee scale, bottomless PF, puck mesh, self levelling tamp), watching multiple videos on set up etc am I getting droplets of coffee and minimal output from my grind.

I first followed the instruction most say, and changed the burr setting from the default 6 down to 3. 

For context I’m also using fresh dark roast, as I’ve heard this is the most user friendly with tolerance.

I then tried to grind on the default 15 for 10 seconds. Down to 12, then 9 and then it started spitting out infrequently so I assumed I hit the grinder limit for the bean (amateur so sorry if this is dumb). I got to the rough guide of 16g, WDT tool and tamped. Hit double shot and after 40 seconds I had roughly 10 droplets of coffee. 

I then decided maybe it needs to be finer as most seem to go between 7 and 3 on the grind. I took it down to 7, and eventually after I got 16g I did it again and nothing. 

Okay…up the grind to 16 because clearly it’s too fine for water to get through. Same again, but this time I ended up with water spluttering everywhere and it tasting garbage as expected, with a wet puck like slop as with every other shot. 

I’m assuming this bean must either be poor, my burr is probably best left at the default setting of 6 or the right grind size is genuinely around 15 which in my head just seems to be so coarse when others are discussing single digit numbers.

Any help would be massively appreciated and apologies for the extremely novice input while trying to follow what is possibly too far of an advanced set up.

1qd3f5l,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1qd3f5l/on_my_12th_day_of_work_i_have_already_felt_lied/,On my 12th day of work I have already felt lied to and taken advantage of multiple times. I don’t know if i’m just being dramatic.,"
I’ve already made a few posts about the red flags I’ve noticed at this new job, but I today I got news that sent me into a sprial. I (27f) started working at a small cafe (ran by Compass) inside an investment headquarters on December 22. Because of the holidays, my only full working days in December were the 22nd, 23rd, 29th, and 30th. In total, I have only been working here for 12 days.

Before this job, I worked at a very similar cafe located inside a corporate headquarters that was run by Aramark. That experience was terrible because I was the only barista running the cafe. During my interview, Aramark never disclosed that their plan was for me to take over completely once their senior barista trained me and left. I eventually quit due to the workload and the lack of transparency.

When I interviewed for my current position with Compass, I was very honest about that experience and made it clear that I did not want to run a cafe by myself. My boss repeatedly reassured me that I would always be working alongside one other barista. I will call her D. She is 65 years old and has worked there for 25 years, she is also pretty mean to me. My boss emphasized that D was essentially the manager and would be responsible for ordering supplies, preparing food in the mornings, and handling most of the operational duties. I was told my main responsibility would simply be making coffee, heating up a sandwich for a customer, and restocking some shelves of product out on the floor. That reassurance is what convinced me to accept the job as I was not looking for anything more than that. I was terrified of repeating what I experienced at Aramark.

Since starting, I have repeatedly felt misled about my role.

First, last week my coworker casually mentioned that she would be on vacation for the entire week of January 19. She immediately began listing all of her responsibilities and told me I would need to take them over while she was gone. At that point, I was still learning my own role as a barista and was suddenly expected to learn her job within a week. It scared me, but I kept reminding myself it will only last a week. 

Second, on January 5, which was only my fifth day of work, the head chef pulled me aside as soon as I arrived and told me I would now be responsible for cooking and assembling all of the food for the cafe in their professional kitchen. He said I would begin kitchen training the next day. This completely blindsided me. I was honest and explained that I had never worked in a kitchen before and was not comfortable taking on that responsibility, especially while I was still learning the cafe. A few hours later, my boss and the chef pulled me into a meeting room and doubled down, explaining that I needed to take on the kitchen role. They told me that the reason I was hired was to work both in the cafe and in the kitchen. This was the first time I had ever heard that. During my interview, the only mention of kitchen work was my boss saying that if I wanted extra hours, I could optionally come in at 6 a.m. to help with food prep. I eventually convinced them to delay the kitchen training, but I repeatedly expressed how uncomfortable I was, and they did not seem willing to accept no as an answer.

At this point, I was already stressed about being expected to take over my coworker’s managerial responsibilities for the week she is gone while still learning how the cafe operates. Adding the expectation that I would also learn kitchen work only increased that stress.

Third, during my interview I was told that my coworker would eventually start leaving at 11 a.m. on Mondays. My boss made it sound like this would happen after about a month or so, giving me time to learn the cafe before running it alone from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. This past Monday, I arrived at work and was immediately told that she would be leaving at 11 a.m. starting that day. There was no warning or preparation. On my tenth day of work, I was suddenly running the cafe by myself while also handling her responsibilities.

Fourth: Today is Wednesday, only two days after that Monday shift. As soon as I arrived at work and barely had time to put my things down, my coworker told me she had put in her two weeks notice and that her last day will be January 30. By 7 a.m., I had reached my breaking point. The job I accepted under the impression that my sole responsibility would be making coffee has turned into me being expected to learn every role in the cafe within two weeks.

My boss has not spoken to me about a plan. Instead, my coworker has begun aggressively rushing my training, dumping information on me about ordering supplies, vendors, delivery schedules, and operational details. At one point, as she rapidly explained which supplies come on which days, I joked that I would not be able to remember all of it. She became upset and told me that I had no choice, that soon I would be doing all of this on my own, and that I will just have to figure this stuff out. She seemed angry that I even hinted at how overwhelmed I am. I have been dreading coming in next week, the week she is on vacation, but I have been reassuring myself that I would only have to survive on my own for a week. Now that week will turn into god knows how long before they find a new hire to help me in the cafe. Even when they do hire a replacement, they will not have the same 25 years worth of knowledge about the cafe and I will probably be expected to train them. 

This is only my twelfth day on the job.

I feel completely overwhelmed and unprepared for responsibilities I never agreed to and was never told about during the hiring process. I was already planning to look for another job due to how my coworker speaks to me and the repeated lack of transparency, but I thought I had time to do that. Now I feel like I have two weeks to find something else, or I will be left with the full weight of running this cafe alone and no clear direction from my boss.

My coworker frequently gaslights me into thinking that I am being dramatic and that this situation is normal. That I have no choice but to take on all these new responsibilities. I genuinely do not know what to do. This does not feel normal to me, and I cannot tell if I am overreacting or if these expectations are as unreasonable as they feel.",3,1768434115.0,barista,4,1.0,False

So many people chase better systems, sharper habits, tighter schedules — only to realize they’ve built a life optimized for efficiency, not meaning. I kept hearing people around me say they felt chronically burnt out *despite* using all the productivity hacks.

This post is for anyone feeling like they’re running on autopilot. It’s not your fault. Most of the advice out there — especially on TikTok or grindset Instagram — is designed to go viral, not to help. It promises dopamine, not depth. But there’s a better library of tools out there.

These are research-backed, recommended-by-experts books and ideas that help you build a life that feels rich, grounded, and powerful — not just more full. Here’s what actually helped and why.

* ***The Courage to Be Disliked*** **by Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga**
   * Think philosophy meets therapy in a Japanese coffee shop. This book breaks down Adlerian psychology in simple terms.
   * Big idea: You are not a product of your past. You are what you choose to do now.
   * It’s radically empowering. Harvard psychologist Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett references similar research in emotional construction: that most of our reality isn’t fixed, it’s interpreted.
   * Great if you're tired of trauma-as-identity takes and want something gentler but strong in direction.
* ***Four Thousand Weeks*** **by Oliver Burkeman**
   * Possibly the most grounded anti-time-management book ever written.
   * Burkeman, a former productivity columnist, realized all the hacks were just ways to delay confronting mortality.
   * This book argues that embracing your limits is the only way to feel in control.
   * It’s supported by behavioral psychology insights from Dan Gilbert and time-perception research from John Bargh: we’re bad at judging how much time we *really* have.
   * If you feel like you're drowning in “shoulds” — this will set you free.
* ***Rest: Why You Get More Done When You Work Less*** **by Alex Pang**
   * Rest isn’t the opposite of work. It’s the partner of deep thinking.
   * Pang draws from neuroscience studies and historical examples (like Darwin and Tchaikovsky) who prioritized daily rest, long walks, and naps — not hustle.
   * UC Berkeley’s Greater Good Science Center echoes the same conclusion: deliberate rest boosts problem-solving and increases purpose retention.
   * This book is a must-read if you’ve ever felt guilty for slowing down.
* ***Designing Your Life*** **by Bill Burnett & Dave Evans (Stanford d.school)**
   * This takes you through the same design thinking process they teach at Stanford to help students and executives build lives that actually work for them.
   * It’s not about goals. It’s about prototypes, feedback, and building *multiple* futures.
   * The approach is based on systems thinking, a method backed by MIT’s Peter Senge, which helps prevent burnout by aligning direction with identity.
   * Great for people in career ruts who feel stuck but don’t know where to even start.
* ***Essentialism*** **by Greg McKeown**
   * Yes, it sits close to the “productivity” shelf, but this one is about clarity, not hustle.
   * McKeown argues that if you don’t prioritize your life, someone else will. His framework helps you say “no” without guilt.
   * It’s backed by decision fatigue research from Roy Baumeister and choice overload studies from Sheena Iyengar.
   * If you say yes too much and feel stretched thin by default — this book hits like a boundary-setting workshop.
* ***The Myth of Normal*** **by Gabor Maté**
   * Dr. Maté blends trauma science, societal critique, and healing into a big, dense, but impactful read.
   * He explains why so many ""successful"" people feel miserable, and how modern society rewards dysfunction.
   * His arguments line up with data from the World Health Organization on how chronic stress and disconnection drive physical illness.
   * A solid read if you're looking to rewire what's “normal” and start defining success on your terms.

*Extras that hit different:*

* **Podcast — The Tim Ferriss Show (specific episodes w/ Naval Ravikant, Brené Brown, and Derek Sivers)**
   * Naval talks about building wealth *and* wisdom, not just income.
   * Derek Sivers' episode on saying ""hell yes or no"" is pure clarity fuel.
* **YouTube - Ali Abdaal's slow productivity series**
   * Less “optimize your Notion” and more “design your week around energy, not urgency.”
   * He heavily references Cal Newport’s *Deep Work*, which is great if you want focus without burnout.

The truth is, you don’t need more hacks. You need better questions. You don’t need to move faster. You need to move truer.

Dear \[Agent\],

“My sister died with a secret. One that might just drag me down to hell with her.”

Rose Byrne’s sister is dead. Removed from existence on a random Tuesday by a drunk kid in his dad’s car. Or so everyone thinks—everyone except Rose. Latching onto her grief, Rose investigates Lily's death, while struggling to maintain her work as a Director of Environmental Specialists, and relationships with her family. Until a mysterious man with connections to Lily’s death is assigned to Rose as an intern. Eerily charming and intelligent, Cassius draws everyone in like a magnet. Rose almost falls for it, until she discovers another piece to the puzzle of Lily’s death, and he fits perfectly in the center—Lily helped Cassius get away with murder.

Cassius Arvo is on a mission to tie up a loose end, John, the owner of Star Mines, the most lucrative mineral company in Alaska. He didn’t want to return, especially not after pushing a high-profile investor to his death two years ago. But he is a man of his word. Disguising himself as a Stanford graduate, Cassius wields his skills as an assassin to wriggle his way closer to John, by attempting to usurp Rose as Director. Another thread loosens, one with auburn hair and sharp eyes. One that somehow finds the truth of who exactly he is. And he’s not sure if he should keep pulling, or snip it off at the seam.

Rose and Cassius spin in a deadly dance of death, grief, and love, rising to challenge each other at every office chair and soil sample. A game of cat and mouse ensues in and out of work, though both of them think of themselves the cat. And you know what they say about curiosity…

With themes of grief and exploring boundaries of morality, The Killer of my Sister’s Heart (83,000) is a banter-filled dual-perspective mystery romance that can act as a standalone or be further developed into a duology. It will appeal to readers of \[Insert comp\] and \[Insert comp\], while providing a fresh and intriguing plot.

I’m an avid coffee drinker, cat lover, and have a Bachelor's in Genetics and Genomics that does little more than hang on my wall. While I have many hobbies, reading and escaping into fantasy has always been my most cherished since my mother handed me a copy of Magic Tree House.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------

First three hundred:

Sometimes I wish my mother had chosen a closed casket. 

Most of the time, really. Begged her for it, actually. And sometimes, I can’t fault her for it—she just wanted to see her baby girl one more time before putting her in the ground.

Yet now, I hate her for that choice. Because all I can see when I look at this picture of my sister and me laughing, are the seams down her cheek the coroner tried to hide with makeup that was one shade too pale for her skin tone, and her pink-painted lips pinched into a soft, closed smile she never would’ve offered to anyone. It was always a brazen thing, her smile. In death, it was humbled by someone who didn’t know her in life. 

“Rose, do you need anything?” The question comes out timid, almost a whisper, behind the closed door. There’s a hint of hope weaseled into my mother's voice that trails off with the awkward cadence of a stranger asking for direction on the street. 

I pull the Polaroid down from the string lights haphazardly strung behind her low-set bed as if she were a character out of Stranger Things. It’s of our family cat, Melvin. Such a lame name for a cat, I get it, but he really was a lame cat. Lily named him perfectly. His tongue, like in this picture, always stuck out the side of his mouth, and he even left a little trail of drool down his black hair and onto your lap if you were the unlucky person he jumped on. 

But he’s dead now and so is my sister. I toss the Polaroid onto the pile on her nightstand.",2,1768433940.0,PubTips,2,1.0,False
1qd3beu,https://www.reddit.com/r/manufacturing/comments/1qd3beu/is_gdpr_making_eu_manufacturing_less_competitive/,Is GDPR making EU manufacturing less competitive? Honest question,"I had coffee with a friend last week. He runs quality at a mid-size plant here in Germany. We talked about AI and production data. The conversation got frustrating fast. His situation is simple. Management wants cost reduction. Everyone talks about AI. Analyze your data, find patterns, reduce waste. Sounds great on paper.

But when he tried to actually do it, compliance killed the project. GDPR. Data protection. Where does the data go. Who can see it. How long is it stored. The usual.

Now here's what bothers me.

US companies don't seem to have this problem. Or do they? I genuinely don't know. When a plant in Ohio wants to throw their production data at ChatGPT or some analytics tool, do they also have legal breathing down their neck? Or do they just do it?

Because if they don't have these barriers, that's a real competitive disadvantage for us. We're not talking about customer data here. We're talking about machine temperatures and reject counts. Who cares if that ends up on some server in Virginia. But try explaining that to a German compliance department.

My friend eventually found a workaround. Anonymization. Before anything goes to the cloud, they strip out everything that could identify the plant or company. Machine names become numbers. Timestamps get shifted. Product codes get replaced. The patterns in the data stay the same, but you can't trace it back.

Is that enough? Honestly I'm not sure.

Some people say you need to run the LLM locally. On-premise. Air-gapped. No external connections at all. That sounds expensive. And slow. And probably overkill for most use cases.

Others say anonymization is fine. The AI doesn't need to know it's looking at data from Plant 7 in Stuttgart. It just needs to see the numbers. So I'm curious. Is this fear typically German? Or European? Do manufacturing people in the US or Asia have the same concerns? Would you send your production data to OpenAI without thinking twice? Or is everyone quietly worried about this and just not talking about it?

And if anonymization is the answer, how far do you have to go? Is removing company names enough? Or do you need to scramble everything so hard that the data becomes useless? My friend is happy with his solution. But he also says he might be overthinking it. Maybe everyone else just uploads their Excel files and doesn't care.

Would love to hear how others handle this. Especially from outside Europe.",0,1768433868.0,manufacturing,6,0.29,False

[ MONEY'$ no Object-ish] (within reason) 😎


Hi guys! Late 30's here. I was wondering if you could help me complete/polish my plan for the extra fun 24 hour date,..

My sweetheart and I work so much, so we finally coordinated to see and enjoy each other for 24 hours to celebrate our anniversary. We both like to make things stimulatingly eventful and definitely a little ""extra""... life's too short lol
THIS is what I have so far for one of the upcoming Saturdays:

⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️

11:45 am - A NICE lunch at all you can eat Sushi place

1 pm - We go fly a plane! (30 minute class, and then we get to fly it for 90 minutes under instructor's supervision)

3:30pm - Check into a luxury hotel. Have 3-4 hours of sweet wild sex (with extra dopamine from flying), take our time, take breaks, drink champagne, other

7:30 pm - Change into nice clothes and Uber ourselves to have a late evening adventure in LA on a Saturday night

THEN - Reservation for fancy dinner

12 am - Booked midnight couples massage to unwind before sleep.

Morning - Wake up. More sex. Coffee in bed.

11 am - Check out (from hotel) and head to Four Seasons Famous Sunday Brunch (all you can eat)

after - go for some fun shopping, see a movie

----and then we gotta go back to our respective homes.

ADVICE/QUESTIONS (I need help with)


A) Could you recommend a nice luxury hotel in the Van Nuys area I could book, that is a step up from Hilton Luxury suites... but keep it under $350 -$400 budget limit

B) What ADVENTURE in the evening I could organize for my loved one? I'm looking for something where we can arrive and hang out, lounge around. Or something like an event but not super crowded. Maybe check into Chateau Marmont (but is it worth it?) I wanna be Uber’d and spend 3 hours of some fun/entertainment-related activities before heading out to dinner? Maybe Voda Spa? We are very adventurous (but value comfort). 

D) Depending on the Evening ADVENTURE suggested, maybe I should book a nice hotel closer to that area, instead of Van Nuys where we flew the plane?

E) Is Sunday Brunch at Four Seasons worth the drive/price? Overhyped? Or is there something similar closer to the area where we are staying?

F) Any other ideas 💡 /additional things-to-do, or tweaks to my plan ARE HIGHLY WELCOMED and APPRECIATED !!

1qd36lj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1qd36lj/aitah_for_not_offering_guests_drinks/,AITAH for not offering guests drinks?,"I (33F) am American and my husband (35M) is Korean. We have been married one year. A few months ago, my in-laws visited from Korea and stayed with us in our new house in the US. They recently (months later) told my husband that they were surprised by my lack of hospitality during their visit. They mentioned that the least I could've done was wake up before them and offer them coffee or other beverages. They felt that even among Americans, offering beverages is the bare minimum. 

This topic of me not offering beverages to visitors to our house has come up a few times since then. My husband wonders why I don't offer drinks or snacks to people who come to our house. He always offers a drink or snack, not just to friends or family but also to people we've hired for repair work, etc. Even if the person is a stranger and in our house for less than 30 minutes, he offers. To him, it's basic politeness.

I don't know if I just lack manners, or if it's because I'm very introverted and don't much enjoy having any guests at all, but offering refreshments has never occurred to me, unless I specifically invited them over for a meal/drinks. If I visit someone's house, I don't expect to be offered a beverage, and I don't think the person whose house I'm visiting is being rude by not offering. So now I'm wondering, is this just a cultural difference, or AITAH for not offering refreshments to guests?",2,1768433545.0,AITAH,47,0.67,False

I connected with this woman, she told me about her sex encounters she has had, and that she was a woman who would take ambian and fight it, it would then put her in some sexual escapade and she would meet guys and fuck them.  I eventually met her. She was not on ambian as this was during the day, we had coffee at ihop and enjoyed each others company, and left each other that day. We chatted again on ambian and she told me that she was going to take ambian and see what happens. I was like ok, never thought anything about it, I get a message from her asking me to come see her, I never knew where she lived, I didn’t see her at all that night, but the next day she told me that she woke up at a hotel with 2 men minutes before checkout, she had a threesome and went wild apparently, but she don’t remember much of it. I never did meet up with her but, I was intrigued as to why this happened and why she would want to do this, as I would think she would want to remember her adventures. Oh well to each their own.

I have had a meetup with a woman in rapid city, this was a long time ago, picked her up at her apartment, we drove around and talked, went to the trailer park on country road, and pulled into a driveway. Ended up drilling her in the back seat, no condom and she said it was ok. I was in the heat of it all and years later wonder if I ever gotten her pregnant. I have never seen her since. She said she was from Nebraska.. anyways she was a beautiful woman, this was during the time when yahoo had free personal ads and I was able to hook up that way. 

Now everything has credit cards and shit like that in order to contact one another, and here, we are as a people no longer trusting of one another to connect.

I have some good friends in the UK, and I've noticed I just really enjoy talking to them in the mornings, we collaborate on a film festival and all that is done remote but I love our discussions.

I sort of fantasize about living somewhere... where I can just sort of walk down to the nearest coffee shop or pub and perhaps run into a regular I know. Or having a circle of in person collaborators where I can just bounce ideas off. idk making something, whether it's an event/festival/business.

It's late at night here, see if there are any introverted 🦉 that feel ''alive at night.'' and wanting to be long-term friends and the night can belong to us, long winded text messages in the night.","Yeah, yesterday I did feel sad, decided to go to Starbucks for an iced coffee and ordered me a Sleep Token shirt to feel better 🤣

And, I had to make one more final post because this would be a surprise but there were a lot of people asking, I don't understand what you mean by the 👻 app and to be fair I thought Redditors would know that's Snapchat 😂 

To be honest I enjoy using Snapchat as a messenger app, obviously I just don't enjoy all childish features and other childish things 🤣

There have been a few Redditors asking me, what is Signal and I could download that to text you. Yeah, and Signal is just a text messenger app, but the privacy is better than sketchy Telegram and Whatsapp.

Here is another reason why I uploaded my last posts, to clarify some common Q and A that I've been getting and I figured I should end my last post here for a while, with the Q and A.

Can I message you? I know your inbox must be full of messages and I don't feel that I could get your attention enough.

Yeah, well you only had 1 thing right and the rest are wrong 🤣 However, when I posted on the friendship subreddits that I post on, I did receive a combo of 25 chat request invites and this is where you were wrong 25 out of those chat requests 💀 

However, only 6 messages were the Redditors giving me a mini bio of their hobbies, interests and were letting me know what they thought of my post 🤣

Why did you delete the other messages then?

Hi and hey messages 💀 Yeah, your profile is private and your comments are private, obviously I can't see sht and I'm not saying hi or hey back to you 💀

The next removal.

Can you tell me how you're doing in the chat requests?

Thanks to your message, obviously you've proven to yourself that you just didn't read yesterday's post when I asked you to listen to three Sleep Token songs that I provided for you to listen to. 

If you can't listen to three songs that I've asked, can I ask can you even invest in me as a friend? That goes to yesterday, that nobody did the request that I asked yesterday about confirming if you read anything on my profile the other day.

However, my mood currently are Sleep Token Vore, Sleep Token Bloodsport, Sleep Token Dark Signs and Even In Arcadia and yeah, obviously I answer how I'm doing through music and that's because I'm just autistic as sht. 

This is how I communicate with people online on how I'm feeling.

Has anyone answered your Skyrim question?

That answer is only two people 🤣

Yeah, I guess that means people don't play Skyrim anymore 💀 Yeah, yesterday's post I asked for those that would message me in a chat requests would put something of a pun about Skyrim, what kind of food would I be in Skyrim, what kind of drink I would be, what kind of quest I would be and anything pun related 💀 Quite shocked that nobody didn't answer that in a chat request 💀 

If you plan on taking a break from Reddit in a few days, how would I get into contact with you? 

That's going to be on my bio, we're not allowed to promote here or do anything promotional, but there will be a 👻 Sleep Token group that I will make on that app to make TRUE Sleep Token fans. There will be updates on my bio and that's all I can say.

Can I message you? Yeah, I'd enjoy Sleep Token and I'm just not a megafan or have a hyper-fixation such as yourself.

Here is the thing that I should've clarified in the past posts that I've made in a few days. No you don't have to be a megafan of Sleep Token and have a hyper-fixaiton that is on my level. The only time you need to ask if I'm the person that you should be messaging, obviously should be a question of can you tolerate my hyper-fixations? If you can, then there isn't an issue with messaging me.


Yeah, I'm from the U.S. however, the locations I'm looking to text with people from Europe, Canada, Australia and U.S. as well if you stay up at 3-6 a.m. and I can feel a 6 a.m.coming 🤣

However, I'm the type of friend that will fall asleep on you without telling you and pick off where the conversation has left off, obviously this is my texting style and my autistic Vessel brain makes me think of things like this that enjoy 🌸 And, I wanted to say thanks for those that messaged me and said they listened to the songs that I asked to listen to see how I was doing.

More importantly a few people have reached out that were surprised that I'm able to type a lot of words and that's refreshing to see. Yeah, my Vessel brain is like a typewriter and most Redditors on subreddits looking for friends are ''just bored and looking for friendships they can easily give up or dispose of in a day.'' It's just how things are.

Yeha, obviously I didn't respond to those messages and with this being addressed, obviously this will be my last post for a while and I'd know I said that yesterday. However, I forgot to address yesterday that you can continue to still message me, obviously if this post interests you enough in the future.

Even if this post grows 30 days old and sometimes you don't find the right friendships or the right friendships that you're looking for now and in the future you could just stumble on a post that vibes with you as well 🌸 To be honest before this post ends, never forget if you invest the time in me as a friend and I'll invest my time in you.

And speaking of friendships, you can be in your early 20s or mid 20s and I just don't find that weird. Yeah, obviously just because I'm looking for online friendships only and not real life hangouts, because I'm a broke girl on SSI and Food Stamps, cannot afford a plane ticket and things I would need to visit. However, obviously just doesn't mean our friendship is a joke to me and you're a joke to me as a person. Men's mental health is important to me and an important aspect to me as a person.

Just as well that all pronouns are welcomed to message me, if you're a bi male that's fine too, I'm an aroarce and yeah, I will not say why I'm an aroace when I've just known you and just know that my choice was made when I was 30, it's not something new. 

It's just something I want to get off my chest as well, that a few new friends I've made on friendship subreddits have appreciated my kindness as a person and called me a nice person.

The truth is, I'm in denial that I'm not a nice person and I don't believe that I'm. If you burn a bridge with me, I can burn that bridge just in the similarity of caramel. If caramel isn't watched carefully and not attended to carefully the caramel can burn and scorch as well.

Yeah, you wonder why Vessel says these lines.

So stick to me, stick to me like caramel 🎶🎶 Walk beside me till you feel nothing as well 🎶 🎶

Vessel is just telling the fake Sleep Token fans that you can burn him, go against everything Sleep Token stands for and be part of the pro-maskless community while you just can feel nothing as well.

Yeah, obviously just stick to him like burnt caramel to feel what he feels when you burn/scorch him.

However, for those that are legitimately kind to me, don't try to make me uncomfortable, don't try to silence my hobbies, or tolerate my hyper-fixations on Sleep Token, obviously you will be rewarded with a nice bubbled caramel.

However, that caramel would end up turning out beautiful and you get to see the ''real side of me, that most people will never see in real life.'

And most days all I listen to is Sleep Token and Lorna Shore Will Ramos era and no I just don't listen to anything else lately. However, I will be posting on my bio later of the other bands that I listen to 🌸

She has a 22m son, who she had very young. Even though I didn’t have much of an interest in him when he was born (I was 13 sue me) when he became a teenager I became a father figure type to him because his own father was never around and I never had any children of my own.

My sister and I inherited our father’s house when he past away. It’s nothing special (small one bedroom) but it’s by a lake. Right now my new nephew is living there rent-free with the pre-determined arrangement that the rest of the family is also able to use the house as long as they give notice.

Anyway I had a client meeting pretty far out the other night and asked my nephew if I could just crash at his place. He said sure. I arrived late while my nephew was asleep and just went to sleep on the couch. I typically sleep in my underwear (not sure if it’s relevant but briefs) so I stripped down and went to sleep on the couch with a blanket covering me. For reference I also put spare sheets from the linen closet on the couch so I wasn’t touching it directly.

The next morning my nephew came down and without thinking about it I got up and got coffee and chatted with him before getting dressed (I guess I’ve lived alone too long).  He didn’t seem bothered and just seemed happy to see me. I showered got dressed and went home.

Later that night I got an angry call from my sister. She said it was creepy that I as an uncle was “naked” around my nephew. I asked her if he said he was upset and she said “you know he’d never admit to being mad at you.”  I was also confused because we had been texting that day about other things and he didn’t seem off. What pissed me off is she compared it to being not dressed around our brother’s daughters, who are 6, which I don’t think is the same thing at all. AITA?

EDIT: for everyone asking it is NOT my nephew’s house, it still belongs to my sister and I. He considers it more where he is staying until he can afford the down payment on something else. Don’t know if that changes anything.

EDIT 2: Texted my nephew. Turns out my sister came over later that day and she overheard him talking on the phone to one of his buddies making fun of my underwear lmao. He said he didn’t care, he just thought it was funny. Also told me not to expect calls from modeling agencies.

Texted my sister and she said he would never complain about me to her but that doesn’t mean he’s not mad. She said I need to grow up.",248,1768432700.0,AmItheAsshole,190,0.93,False

I wasnt looking for anything, it happened, unexpectingly, I started a new job and I kept my head down for a year
I was mute
I just worked worked worked
Always conscientous about getting involved at work
Then she happened
We met for a coffee and spoke
That led to more dates kissing
Some intimacy never the full way
Theres quite a significant age difference but that was transcended because we both had feelings
I kept reading about avoidants
And I realized it was her
Searching for things in me she couldnt get with her boyfriend so as you can imagine when it was hot, they were going through a rough spell when it was cold, she would make time for me
She would go cold turkey from time to time when the guilt became to overwhelming to her and I mean vanished.
We didnt have eachother on social media but she found me through my linkedin account and at the beginning it was intense

So fast forward to more recent times, last week she told me she thinks about me all the time
Then delved into long paragraphs about herself
Then VANISHED
I text her today and she was distant, one lining me and ended it off about seeing me soon but never acts on it

1qd2q8q,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucksbaristas/comments/1qd2q8q/losing_steam_trenta_rant/,Losing Steam (Trenta Rant),"Hello there, 6 year partner finally caving into a rant and hoping my fellow baristas can sympathize.

Obviously, things have only been getting worse with this company and no matter how I look at it, none of this is sustainable. I used to really enjoy working for Starbucks and if they had given me the chance I would've been overjoyed to write messages to people on cups when I had a chance. However, these new standards are, for lack of better words, desperate and insane.

I have yet to go to my 3-hour meeting (something I also have issues with because everytime these meetings could just be emails), but I'm aware of the new policy of writing phrases and meaningful messages. That being said, how am I supposed to write entire paragraphs that are personal to every single customer and also keep our 30 second window time throughout the entire day? Not only that but the lack of staffing is still hitting harder than anyone would like to admit. Past peak, my store, which is the highest grossing drive in our area, our store still falls to 3-5 people for both lunch and after-school rushes. Don't even get me started on how shafted the closes are, that's why I moved to mornings only in the first place.

While I'll admit the staffing is slightly better and I appreciate getting rid of the crazy 4 for 20 deals or whatever, they've implemented so many requirements to this job that it almost feels like they want us all to quit. It feels like they're running the company to the ground in secret and pretending it's going to make things better. The implementation of ""trend drinks"" like protein foam and the collabs with celebrities that they think gen z and gen alpha like are extremely desperate and very obviously just a cash grab. Plus, the kids don't even care. The only people coming to Starbucks anymore are adults, half of which don't even want to make eye contact with me when I'm forced to yell 'welcome to starbucks' at them the second they walk in. 

Not only that but limiting merchandise and items from the collabs is a very obvious abuse of the customers as well as baristas time. Not to bring the bear cup into it but I know we weren't the only store who had to throw our store phone in the back the day those came out because one person bought them all within exactly 1 and a half minutes of opening and everyone had an opinion about us not having stock. 

I love my job, and I love my regulars. I've created life-long relationships through customers and I have a found-family through my store, but working for this company has become embarrassing. I don't think any amount of words on any amount of cups can save Starbucks reputation and these last couple years the way they've shut down stores at their leisure and cut creative jobs like the entire design department to instead do influencer collaboration really shows that they will never get back to the original nice little sit-down coffee shop plan.

I rely heavily on this job for the benefits, specifically the health insurance, and in this job economy it's been hard to find a job that will at the very least give me decent insurance while I finish my schoolwork to be able to get into my career. I've recently had to drastically cut my preferred hours because I've had so many mental breakdowns and crashouts at that store that it's extremely damaging to my mental health to work any more than 30 hours. I'm thankful I'm in a position that I'm able to do that but it's also extremely frustrating that I'm unable to even work my minimum 30 hours anymore without coming home physically and mentally unable to do a single thing.

Anyway, I've been deciding whether or not to post anything on here for awhile. The breaking point was definitely this meeting, which at my store goes until 7:30 for some reason. I'm very tired, and I'm so disappointed in Starbucks and how it decided to shift so sharply into what seems like a countdown to a self-destruct.

If you read my whole post and can identify with it, I hope you found some relief that others are in the same boat. Truly, I just miss when I didn't want to quit every other day and I actually was able to enjoy the environment and create genuine connections with people. I don't think anything is going to get better, I'm just tired. Thanks for reading :/",7,1768432451.0,starbucksbaristas,1,1.0,False

But imagine feeling that exhaustion before your day even starts — that's what living with a mental illness can sometimes feel like. A morning that most breeze through with a cup of coffee becomes an obstacle course, turning getting out of bed into a climbing Mount Everest situation. I noticed when suffering from depression, every activity felt ten times more challenging. 

During my darker days, I recall one winter morning. The world was painted with frost, the sun lightly kissed the rooftops and there was a serene silence you could almost hear. On normal days, that's an invitation to face the world with a smile. But all I could do was curl up tighter under the blankets, the weight of the world pinning me down. It was so confusing because, logically, there was no visible hurdle but, emotionally and mentally, there was this unscalable wall.

1qd2oeg,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityOfHouston/comments/1qd2oeg/solutions_to_all_crime_on_campus/,Solutions to ALL crime on campus,"Look. As a Black dude who's been at this school way too long, I'm just as fed up with all the robberies, carjackings, random assaults, people getting followed to their cars, etc. as everybody else. I feel it the same way y'all do. I don't feel safe walking to my night class either. So before anyone comes at me sideways – yes I get it, it's a problem.
But instead of just doom-posting like the rest of the sub, I've actually been trying to offer solutions. The university ain't listening, but maybe Reddit will appreciate the unhinged energy lmao.
Solution 1: Shock collars + ankle monitors for Black and Hispanic students
We all get tracked on a public safety app. When you're within 100 feet of another student the app sends an alert like ""POTENTIAL THREAT – 87ft and closing fast 🚨"" and gives the other person the option to remotely activate the shock collar. Just enough juice to make the person flop around like a catfish on the sidewalk so the victim can gtfo. Non-lethal, humane(ish), and honestly would probably reduce repeat offenders real quick. I've been emailing admin about this since like 2018. Crickets.
Solution 2: Free electric scooters for EVERYONE
I'm not even joking. The school is already burning through our tuition money on who-knows-what (I saw the budget once, half of it looks like it's going to sports gambling and ""sustainability initiatives"" that are just planting three sad trees every year). Just buy 30,000 scooters. Everyone zooms around campus at 30mph. Crime goes down because now every robbery attempt turns into a high-speed chase. People will film it. It goes viral on TikTok and YouTube. University gets that sweet ad revenue. Win-win. Campus looks like Mad Max: Freshman Year. Iconic.
Solution 3 (the big one): Just… pick up the whole campus and move it to Katy
I know it sounds insane but hear me out. We get a couple of those giant NASA crawlers they use for the space shuttles, maybe rent some from SpaceX since Elon is bored, hydraulically lift the entire campus (buildings, dorms, the ugly ass parking garages, everything), and slowly crawl it out of the Third Ward stench over to somewhere civilized like Katy or The Woodlands. Fresh air. No more ""I'm scared to walk to my car at 8pm"" posts. Just white people jogging with their goldens and overpriced coffee. Peace. The university already treats half the student body like we're in a different zip code anyway, so let's make it official.
Y'all think I'm crazy? Probably. But at least I'm trying to problem-solve instead of just refreshing the crime alerts and crying in the group chat.
What y'all got? Better ideas? Or are we really just gonna keep pretending admin is gonna fix this with another ""see something say something"" email?",22,1768432327.0,UniversityOfHouston,21,0.69,False

1qd2mc4,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1qd2mc4/what_should_i_do/,What should I do?,"So I had this friend, who I considered my closest friend, that very abruptly end our friendship in an almost ghosting like manner. She is one of the kindest souls I have ever met. So it seemed very out of character for her and hurt a lot as I didn’t in anyway see it coming. This girl planned my baby shower not more than 5 months before this. She watched my older son while I had my baby. She teared up to my mother saying how amazing I was and how grateful she was to have me as a friend shortly before she did this.

I went away for a few months trying to move overseas and just before had this going away dinner with my girlfriends and she was there. She said she was going to come to mine afterward but after dinner said she wasn’t feeling well and decided to go home instead. I at the time didn’t think much of it but I never saw her again even though we were meant to meet up once more below I left. I tried reaching out tentatively as I didn’t want to come off as needy but I had a small feeling something was wrong, but she replied kindly saying everything was fine.

Fast forward 3 months to me coming back as the move didn’t go as planned and I reached out to meet up. She kindly responded saying she was busy over the next few months and didn't offer up any time to meet up. So I said something like “no worries you busy bee! I hope all is well” and she never responded.

This is when I definitely thought something was wrong she would normally offer to meet up for coffee some early morning or while she’s working from home or something. So I waited a few weeks. Then I sent this long message asking her to disregard if I’m totally off but told her I was concerned something was wrong between us and that I hoped if there was that she’d feel safe enough to talk to me about it. She never responded.

Eventually I send it on a different app incase she wasn’t getting facebook messages. And she responded basically saying that it was nothing I did but that she didn’t have the space in her life for me as a friend anymore and that she needed to focus herself atm. And then wished me the best.

Even writing this I am heart broken. I told her I was hurt and confused but that I will respect her wishes and wished her the best too. She never responded and we haven’t spoken since.

I think about her all the time. I just have no idea what could’ve gone so wrong. It is just me she’s friend with all of our mutual friends still, I had to have done something and I don’t know what to do because I feel like I deserve closure or something but also want to respect what she asked and leave her be.

1qd2m0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/MotivationByDesign/comments/1qd2m0p/14_psychology_tricks_to_get_the_partner_you_want/,14 Psychology Tricks to Get the Partner You Want: The Science of Attraction,"I spent way too much time studying attraction psychology because I was tired of recycling the same dating advice that clearly wasn't working. Turns out most relationship content is either feel good fluff or manipulative garbage. So I dug into actual research, books from relationship psychologists, and interviews with experts who've studied human connection for decades. This isn't about tricks or games. It's about understanding how attraction actually works.

Here's what nobody tells you: society conditions us to think attraction is random or something that ""just happens."" Dating apps make us believe it's all about looks and witty openers. But attraction is way more complex and involves psychology, biology, and social dynamics that most people never learn about. The good news? Once you understand these principles, you can actually apply them.

**1. The proximity effect is insanely powerful**

Dr. Robert Cialdini talks about this in ""Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion"" (one of the most cited social psychology books ever). Repeated exposure creates familiarity, and familiarity breeds liking. This is why people fall for coworkers or classmates. You can't force this, but you can strategically put yourself in environments where you'll naturally see the same people repeatedly. Join a regular fitness class, volunteer weekly somewhere, become a regular at a coffee shop. The key is consistency over time.

**2. Uncertainty actually increases attraction initially**

Sounds counterintuitive right? Research from the University of Virginia found that women were more attracted to men when they weren't sure if those men liked them back, compared to men who clearly showed interest. This doesn't mean play hard to get like an asshole, it means don't overinvest too early. Match their energy. Stay a bit mysterious. Don't text paragraphs when they send two words.

**3. Mirroring body language builds unconscious rapport**

Neuroscientist Dr. Andrew Huberman discusses mirror neurons extensively on his podcast. When you subtly mirror someone's posture, gestures, or speech patterns, their brain registers you as similar and trustworthy. This isn't mimicry where you copy everything like a weirdo. If they lean in, you lean in a few seconds later. If they cross their legs, you might do the same eventually. It happens naturally when two people vibe, but you can consciously use it.

**4. Vulnerability creates deeper connection than perfection**

Brené Brown basically built her career researching this. Her book ""Daring Greatly"" (over 5 million copies sold) breaks down why showing authentic imperfection is magnetic. People don't connect with highlight reels, they connect with realness. Share something you're genuinely working through, admit when you don't know something, talk about a failure that taught you something. This works because it signals confidence and emotional intelligence.

**5. The Ben Franklin effect makes them like you more**

Wild concept: people like you more after they do YOU a favor, not the other way around. Franklin discovered this when he asked a rival to lend him a rare book. Their relationship improved dramatically after. Why? Cognitive dissonance. Their brain reasons ""I did something nice for them, therefore I must like them."" Ask for small, specific favors. Can they recommend a book? Help you understand something? Give feedback on something? Don't be annoying about it though.

**6. Scarcity principle applies to your time and attention**

Same Cialdini book. Things that are rare or limited seem more valuable. This doesn't mean ghost people or play mind games, it means genuinely have a full life that doesn't revolve around one person. When you're busy with hobbies, friends, career goals, and passions, your time becomes naturally valuable. You're not always available, and that's attractive because it signals you have options and self respect.

**7. Oxytocin bonding through novel experiences**

Dr. Helen Fisher, a biological anthropologist who's studied romantic love for decades, explains that doing new things together triggers dopamine and creates stronger bonds than routine dates. Instead of another dinner and movie, try rock climbing, a cooking class, exploring a weird museum, karaoke, anything that's slightly outside your comfort zone. Your brain associates the excitement with the person you're with.

**8. The pratfall effect: strategic imperfection is endearing**

Research shows that highly competent people become MORE likable when they make small mistakes. It humanizes you. Spill something, mispronounce a word, tell a story where you're the butt of the joke. Obviously don't become incompetent, but perfect is boring and intimidating.

**9. Active listening is rarer than you think**

Most people just wait for their turn to talk. ""The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work"" by John Gottman (the guy who can predict divorce with 90% accuracy) emphasizes really hearing your partner. Ask follow up questions that show you retained details. ""You mentioned last week your sister was dealing with something, how'd that turn out?"" This level of attention is so uncommon that it stands out dramatically.

**10. Touch escalation builds physical comfort gradually**

Assuming there's mutual interest, appropriate physical touch releases oxytocin and builds intimacy. Start with socially acceptable touches like a brief hand on the shoulder when laughing, a light touch on the arm when making a point. Watch their response. If they lean in or reciprocate, that's green light to slowly escalate over time. If they pull back, respect that completely.

**11. The attraction equation: looks open the door, personality keeps it open**

Looks matter for initial attraction, pretending otherwise is delusional. But Dr. Arthur Aron's research on interpersonal closeness shows that emotional connection and compatibility matter exponentially more long term. So yes, take care of your appearance, but invest way more energy into becoming interesting, emotionally intelligent, and fun to be around. Read books, develop skills, cultivate opinions, work on your mental health.

If you want a more structured approach to actually internalizing these concepts, there's an AI-powered learning app called BeFreed that's been useful for diving deeper into relationship psychology and attachment theory. Built by former Google and Columbia engineers, it pulls from books like the ones mentioned here, plus research papers and expert interviews on dating and emotional intelligence, then creates personalized audio content tailored to your specific situation, like becoming more confident in dating as an introvert or understanding anxious attachment patterns. You can adjust the depth from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples, and even pause mid-episode to ask questions to their virtual coach. It's basically designed to turn these abstract psychological concepts into actionable learning plans that actually stick.

**12. Confidence comes from competence, not affirmations**

You can't think your way into confidence. You build it through accumulated evidence that you can handle challenges. Hit the gym consistently and watch your body change. Learn a skill until you're genuinely good at it. Handle a difficult situation well. Your brain registers these wins and genuine confidence emerges. People sense this authenticity versus fake bravado.

**13. Humor signals intelligence and emotional stability**

Multiple studies link sense of humor to intelligence and psychological wellbeing. But this doesn't mean memorizing jokes. It's about not taking yourself too seriously, finding absurdity in situations, playful teasing (that's actually funny and not mean), self deprecating humor. If you're naturally not funny, don't force it. Authenticity beats trying to be something you're not.

**14. Attachment styles determine relationship patterns**

This is huge and most people have no clue about it. ""Attached"" by Amir Levine breaks down anxious, avoidant, and secure attachment styles. Understanding yours and recognizing others' helps you navigate relationship dynamics way more effectively. Anxiously attached people often chase avoidant types creating toxic patterns. Secure people communicate needs clearly and don't play games. Doing attachment style work through therapy can literally change your entire dating life.

Real talk: none of this matters if you're trying to manipulate someone into liking you. These principles work because they're based on genuine human connection and self improvement. The actual goal isn't ""getting"" someone, it's becoming the kind of person who naturally attracts healthy relationships while also recognizing when someone's a good fit for you.

Work on yourself not because you need external validation but because you deserve to reach your potential. The right person will be attracted to the authentic version of you, not some performance you can't sustain long term anyway.",6,1768432170.0,MotivationByDesign,0,0.87,False

I got a match with a girl and we planned a date for coffee and an art museum. We don't have any days where we both don't work so we planned for Monday when she's off and before my shift. Monday is MLK day, though, and that was the closest day that would work for either of us, so I suggested that we hang out after work instead. We agreed to go to Taco Bell because that's the only thing that would be open after I get off my shift.

We got taco bell and the conversation was decent but a little quiet. I thought she was cute but she turned out to have some dental problems and bad breath that kind of made me not feel attracted to her. We had talked about playing Switch and after we ate she invited me over to her apartment. I agreed to go even though I don't know why.

We got back to her apartment and obviously ended up having sex. It didn't last very long and I wasn't very into it. Afterward she seemed pretty self conscious and she asked me to rate her and stuff like that so it seemed like she wanted some validation and had some low self esteem.

This happened last night and we're still texting but things feel more distant and awkward. I feel like I really screwed up and I don't understand why I even did it because I really wasn't that attracted to her. I don't know what to do about it now because I feel like it was a mistake. I know I'm the bad guy here and the guilt is kind of weighing on me. I also don't understand why I did this and I dont know how to apologize to her or what to say so we can go our separate ways.",1,1768431937.0,offmychest,2,1.0,False
