My mom mentioned a similar acquaintance who posts whenever she does anything nice for anyone (example was paying for the next persk at Starbucks and posting about it) and said Jill would behave similarly.  I said, ""No, Jill would get someone else to donate money for Starbucks to her and then post about buying a stranger a coffee.""

At one point my mom was actually in Jill's downline for Plexus and she blocked Jill after she started harassing her via messenger after she stopped using/selling Plexus.

By Matthew Lee

Title: I Woke Up and the Weekend Was Erased. That's Not the Worst Part.

I’m typing this from the driver's seat of my own car while stuck in a parking lot.
I am exhausted, and my hands are shaking so bad the autocorrect is basically writing half of this for me.

Four weeks ago, just another tiring Thursday night, I was lying in bed scrolling my phone.
The calendar widget said Thursday.
I remember thinking,
“Two more minutes and it’s finally Friday. Thank God it’s almost Friday.”
I literally watched the clock tick over to 12:00 AM, and my phone said Monday.

Not Friday. Not Saturday. Monday.

I thought it couldn’t be true that I had blacked out for three straight days. But it was just Monday 12:01 AM. It felt like that weird sensation of losing or gaining one hour because of the daylight saving time thingy.

At first, I thought I must have gotten confused (otherwise, what else could it be?), so I ignored what happened, but now I am posting this to let you guys know that this is NOT normal.

It’s been the same every week since. Every time my phone says Thursday and the clock hits 12:00 AM, I close my eyes and wake up to Monday.

On the second week of this madness, I finally asked Thomaz, the Brazilian guy on the same floor:
“Hey man, did I miss work last Friday? I think I might’ve been sick or something.”
He looked at me like I’d grown a second head.
“What are you talking about? What’s Friday?”

I nervously asked him again. “You know… Friday? The day after Thursday? Before Saturday?”
He just stared. He chuckled, thinking I was messing with him. “Friday? Is that like… Triday? Or… I don't know, Wemday? Stop making up words, man. We have a meeting in ten minutes.”

Shocking.

I tried Brianna next. Same thing.
Ryan, the developer guy. Priya. My boss. The barista in the Main Street café (we call the lobby floor area Main Street for some reason).

None of them knew what Friday was. None of them knew Saturday. None of them knew Sunday.
They all gave me the same confused, slightly pitying look. “You okay, Matt? You’re acting really weird today.”

I pulled out my phone and opened the Biblegate app. I remembered Genesis—God worked six days and rested on the seventh. I needed proof the weekend was supposed to exist. I scrolled to chapter 2 (I thought I at least know Genesis a little bit).
“And on the seventh day God finished his work that he had done, and he rested…” Yes. That’s the verse I tried to find.

But the text on my screen said something else.
“…and after the fourth day the Man continued his labor.”

I refreshed. Same thing. I closed the app, reopened it. Same edited verse.
Man? Not God? And continued to labor?

I googled “Genesis 2:2” and every site said the same lie (or I am crazy): the Man never stopped working.

Ok. Then if there is no Sunday, when do you do the church mass or services (I am Catholic—if you know what that means)?
I tried searching “catholic church near me.” Nothing. No results. Not even old abandoned ones.

I asked Siri: “What day do people go to church?”
She answered: “church is not a modern English word, but it is rarely used to describe a place where people sometimes gather to share inspiring personal stories, but there is no designated building or day for that.”

I said out loud, “Church. You know, mass? Worship? Jesus?”
The barista looked up from steaming milk and said, “Jesus? Like… that Mediterranean folk story? That’s just mythology, hon. Cute, though.”

I almost dropped my coffee.

I opened my calendar app. Every week is just Monday → Tuesday → Wednesday → Thursday → Monday. No Friday. No Saturday. No Sunday. No Christmas. No Easter. No nothing.

I called my mom. She answered cheerful like always.
“Mom, do you remember weekends? Like… days off?”
She laughed. “Days off? Sweetie, everybody works. That’s how it’s always been. You feeling okay?”

I hung up and escaped my office, and now I am sitting in my car in the parking ramp for twenty minutes trying not to hyperventilate.

The worst part isn’t that I lost my weekend.
The worst part isn’t that I’m the only one who remembers it ever existed.
The worst part is there is no God in this world.

I miss sleeping until late noon. I miss “Thank God it’s Friday.” I miss the park I used to take a stroll on during the weekends.
I keep feeling this phantom ache—like my soul is mourning something the rest of the world never had.

Today is Thursday, and I will wake up on Monday morning again.
I’m scared. But I am not sure if God will hear my prayer in a world where there is no God in the Bible.

…what happens when the week never ends?

If you’re reading this and you remember Friday, Saturday, and Sunday—please. Please tell me I’m not alone. Please tell me tomorrow will be Friday.

Title: UPDATE: The guy who DM'd me says the week used to be 14 days long.

I finally got a DM from a guy who knows what I'm talking about.

After my last post, while I was spiraling, a user named Adam reached out. He told me he understands exactly what my situation is. He knows that you know—and I know—that there used to be a Friday, a Saturday, and a Sunday.

But the issue is what he said next. I don't know how to process it.

He said originally, a week was not seven days like I remember. He said a week was 14 days.
He listed them out, but my brain can barely hold onto the names. They sounded ancient, but followed the same pattern we are used to.

He said: Meriday, Falday, Lorday... I think I’m messing up the order. But there were 7 more on top of what I remember.

If I say ""Friday, Saturday, Sunday"" to my coworkers, they look at me like I’m insane. Now Adam is saying something that sounds just as crazy to me. My instinct is to tell him, ""Hey man, don't make things up.""

But he might be right.

I mean, look at me. I’m the only one who remembers the 7-day week. Maybe I just don't remember the original 14 days. Maybe I’m just as amnesiac as the people who forgot the weekend. I feel like I have to believe him. Otherwise, how could he be the only one who validates the existence of the weekend?

I saw some of you in the comments mentioning ""Lorday."" Adam confirmed that was one of the original 14 days. So that kind of validates his story. But here is the scary part: to me, right now, it is Wednesday. But Adam said for him, it was Meriday.

The timeline is no longer a single line for everyone. Things are deeply messed up.

Adam told me something else. Just like I realized everyone around me has lost the concept of church, God, and prayer, Adam remembers a concept called Ecarg (I think that’s the term he used).
He said Ecarg was basically the privilege not to work.

He said he used to have that for the 14-day repeating cycle. He didn't have to work. It was paradise. But then suddenly, he lost it. He said it was because of a tree.

I don't know what that means, but he said after the tree incident, he lost the Ecarg. He lost the 14 days of rest. The week shattered into seven days. He was forced to labor for five, and only rest for two. I had questions but he went offline.

And now... now it’s happening again.

The privilege not to work is being deleted entirely.

Adam went from 14 days of rest to 2.
I went from 2 days of rest to 0.

""No privilege not to work is given anymore.""

I don't know how to interpret this, but yesterday I was worried about Friday not coming. Now I'm worried about losing Wednesday and Thursday.

What if the five-minute break I take is going to go away? What if we only have Monday? What if I have to work 24/7 non-stop? What if even Monday is gone?

I'm terrified…

Today is Thursday... please tell me tomorrow will be Friday.


[UPDATE] 12:00. I couldn't do it.

Guys, it’s almost midnight. I was watching the clock, waiting for the miracle.

Adam messaged me one last time. He sounded desperate, like he was seeing something I couldn't. He told me the whole story again. It was again about the tree, and how he messed up with the tree. How he got scammed by a voice like oil.

So what the heck did happen with the tree?

He said he didn't know it was that much expensive, and how that one ""bite"" put him in this debt.

Debt of what?
Debt of labor, he said.

But then why me too?

Adam said he didn't know but instead,
He told me about the guy who took the shift.

The one who worked through the hell of it to clear our balance. Adam said it was all over, that the bill was zero.
He asked me, ""Can you believe this?""

I looked at my phone. I looked at the empty streets and the grey sky. I thought about all the Monday-to-Thursday distress, the endless grind, the exhaustion. What Adam told me was a crazy story. I tried to be logical .. It did not make any sense.

I typed back: ""No….""

Too good to be true is usually a scam.

That was it.

Then, the clock jumped.

Monday. No Miracle.

In the morning, my work alarm will start blaring through the speakers.

My phone is buzzing now. A text from my boss: “Tomorrow, we have a lot to catch up on. Don’t be late.”

The heavy, greasy weight of the debt slammed back onto my chest, twice as heavy as before. I looked out the window, thick and grey fog, hiding everything.

I’m sitting here in the dark, gripping the steering wheel. I don't know what I am missing here.
I have to go. Monday's starting.

couple months ago i got obsessed with figuring it out. downloaded like 4 different tracking apps trying to find one that wasnt annoying. ended up using one called Peakflow - Health Optimization mostly because it let me track energy and habits together and didnt require me to write journals or whatever

anyway i tracked everything for like 8 weeks. energy 1-10 every day plus sleep, food, coffee, exercise, all that

some of it was obvious in hindsight. waking up at 6am was wrecking me - energy way better when i woke up naturally around 7:30. i forced that schedule for YEARS because some podcast said early rising is the key to success. cool thanks

the coffee thing pissed me off the most. i genuinely thought i needed it. but my afternoon energy was consistently better on no-coffee days. the data was right there and i still didnt want to believe it

also found out walking beat the gym for me. i was dragging myself to these intense workouts thinking thats what you do and it was just stressing my system more

There’s a small coffee shop near my home (family-run place, not a chain). According to their posted hours, they’re open until 11 PM. 

At 10:30 PM, I walked over to get a coffee. The glass door was closed, inside I could clearly see an employee cleaning the coffee machine and counting the cash. 

I waited about 10 minutes, politely knocked on the door. Employee appeared to ignore me. 

At that point, I assumed she had decided to close early and was relying on the owners not finding out. 

I politely messaged the coffee shop official account explaining what happened and asking if their working hours have changed. 

My thinking was:
1) if I were a small business owner, I’d want to know if an employee was closing early and potentially losing sales 
2) as a customer, I want to be able to trust posted opening hours
3) I didn’t just pop by casually — I left my house at night specifically because they were supposed to be open, and there were no alternatives nearby

My husband’s perspective: he says this is basically snitching on an underpaid worker under unfair conditions and that I’m directing my frustration at the wrong person instead of the system. He says he feels embarrassed by my actions. 

I don’t see in that way — but his reaction made me doubt myself.

1qetj7c,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1qetj7c/do_you_recognize_this_as_autistic_behaviour/,Do you recognize this as autistic behaviour?,"Hello everybody,

I have asked a question in the workplace bullying subreddit, and a couple of people have directed me here for possible advice. Not sure I'm allowed to include the link to that in the post so I will do it in the comments.

But long story short, my colleague at work is causing me trouble. She follows me around the office, she's always entering my space, she's constantly trying to get my attention. This has been going on for years, and not once have I accepted it. I don't like her, I don't want to be her friend, and the way she is trying to be my friend is breaking a lot of my boundaries.

She also copies me a lot, including things I wear, things I talk about, heck even my warm-beverage-drinking habits. If I drink coffee, she drinks coffee. If I switch to black tea, she switches too a couple of days later. And how do I know? Because she makes a point of announcing it to everybody in the office that she drinks black tea.

This all sounds very subtle and I thought I was imagining it for a long time, but it has become clear, especially the fact that she follows me around in physical space.

People have suggested that this is autistic behaviour. TBH I disagree, and here's why:

1) she is not well-meaning towards me. She seems bitter and her behaviour seems more manic than autistic.

2) she shifts her interests and personality so often, and usually emphasises and talks about her quirks a lot. To me it seems like she's just appropriating autistic traits to get attention. And I (with pretty much a 100% neudivergent friend base) don't find them worthy of any special attention (anybody can be and like whatever they want) so my theory is she is doubling down on the attention-seeking behaviour around me.

But I might be wrong! Does this behaviour sound like some type of autistic behaviour? How should I approach?

All I want is to find a way to let her know I am not comfortable around her. And ask her to stop following me around. In my eyes, I have been non-receptive to her behaviour for a long enough time for her to understand that, so I'm not sure if she would accept my actual words any better + I don't even know what to say.

1qethap,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qethap,The Pakt Shoulder Bag after two months,"Howdy bag folks ✌️ I’ve used the Pakt Mode Shoulder Bag for a couple of months now and wanted to share a few different ways it fits my daily needs. What’s really worked for me is having a single messenger bag that can cover multiple use cases. I wrote an exhaustively long post on what I look for in a messenger bag (and how this one compares) over on my [Substack](https://kontrasten.substack.com/p/in-search-of-the-perfect-messenger), but to save you a click, I thought I’d share the gist of what I’m able to pack comfortably for a various range of scenarios.   
Below are the three ways I’ve been using the messenger, sorted by carry volume:



**Pic 1-5: \~95% Full — Tech / Work Bag**

* 13-inch MBP
* iPad (used as a Sidecar display)
* 24 oz water bottle
* Large clip-in tech pouch (I’m guessing \~2.5L):
   * Sony XM5 headphones
   * MX Master 3 mouse
   * USB card reader
   * An unreasonable amount of cables and dongles
* “Trout pouch” with basic OTC essentials: inhaler, Liquid IV, eye drops, lotion, etc.
* Front pockets: usual suspects plus a leather pen + notebook pouch, glasses, work badge, bandana, etc.

  
**Pic: 6-8 \~70% Full — Camera Bag**

* Chrome Industries camera insert (not made anymore I think?)
* Cameras as reference: comfortably fits a DSLR with a prime lens + a 120 TLR medium-format camera (could easily fit another lens or two - very impressive!)
* Packable wind jacket
* Front pockets: usual suspects plus four rolls of film, card reader, lens wipes, etc.
   * Note how well the bag holds its shape even when not fully packed

  
**Pic 9-11: \~50% Full — Around-Town / Museum / Coffee Shop Carry**

* iPad
* 24 oz water bottle
* Pouch with two small point-and-shoot cameras
* Two homemade rice-bag pouches: one for film, one as a minimal tech kit
* Packable wind jacket
* Front pockets: the usual suspects—wallet, keys, hand sanitizer, earbuds, etc.

  
Feel free to check out my long review if you really want to nerd out, but in short it’s an incredible bag that has quickly replaced all my other messenger bags. Cheers! ",2,1768600549.0,ManyBaggers,0,1.0,False

1qeth37,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1qeth37/struggling_with_a_transphobic_meta/,Struggling with a transphobic Meta,"I was given information yesterday from one of my partners about another person he sees that I cannot get past.  I’m having a lot of strong emotions about this situation and feel like I could benefit from some advice. 

For some background, partner B and I started casually dating in May. Since that time we have grown super close, and outside of my husband they are now the person I spend the most time with. B and I share most of the same political beliefs, as well as those around social issues and LGBTQ rights. We’ve had lots of talks about these things.  He is Pansexual and has had trans lovers. He posts on social media about trans rights and safety. He even states on his Fetlife bio that trans women are women, and trans men are men. It’s pretty obvious to me where he stands so I assumed that he stood in his beliefs the same way I do. I know that Assuming anything is usually a bad idea, but I did. 

He was casually seeing a woman (L) before we began and they are still casually dating.  We have never clicked, but I rarely have to interact with her. She has told him she can’t get a read on me, that she is intimidated by me, and that she does not trust my motives. I have no idea why she feels this way so I had talked to him about setting up a coffee date with her to get to know each other better. I wanted to help her feel less intimidated because I want my metas to be comfortable with me. We don’t have to be buddies but I also don’t want someone thinking I’ve got any kind of motives where they are concerned.  

We made a coffee date for this past Monday, but I had to cancel because I ended up with the respiratory cold  that everybody has. We already talked about rescheduling for next week. However, now I feel trapped in a spot I can’t figure my way out of.

Yesterday he mentioned that L was going to an event that is LGBTQ + focused and he was hoping she didn’t say something unfortunate. B didn’t use the word unfortunate but I can’t remember what he said exactly. When I asked what he meant, he let me know that she knowingly misgenders trans people and has “antiquated beliefs”. I don’t view transphobia as “antiquated beliefs”.  Plus she is all of 7 years older than me, so age is not an excuse at all anyway. She is 58. 

I was kind of blown away and couldn’t really come up with something to say in the moment aside from my shock that she felt that way. I did warn him that if she ever said anything in front of me, there would be no way I would be able to stop myself from saying anything in return. However, the reality is that I actually have a lot to say about this and am struggling to see if I am being a little much in my reaction or if I’m ridiculous to even question my strong response. 

 I am so confused that he is continuing to spend time with someone transphobic when he is so supportive of the trans community in other ways. My mind is blown and I cannot figure out the mental gymnastics he must go through to make this somehow feel OK.

I really don’t want her in my life now. I don’t want to have this coffee date with her anymore. I don’t want to be associated with her. I would like to take back this extension of friendship because at this point I’m really not worried about the fact that L is  not comfortable around me. She shouldn’t be comfortable around me.

I have zero tolerance for transphobia in my life. I coparent with a trans woman, and he knows that trans rights and support are super important to me. I am guessing this is why he didn’t tell me, but this is exactly why I wish he had told me. Now it’s been months, and L and I are social media and Fetlife “friends”. She once attended an event I invited her to that is openly very supportive of the trans community. I invited trans friends to hangout with us at that event.

I now feel like I’ve been vouching for her in communities where she was not a safe person to be there. I have said good things about her to those that have asked about her. I’ve basically said she was safe by association, or at least that’s how I’m feeling. 

I have not talked to B about this yet, but I need to. I want to separate myself from L as much as I can, including removing myself as a “friend” on Fet, and other places. If L and I do move forward with our coffee talk the whole reason has changed as my motivation was to help her feel comfortable being around me. I wanted things to be easier for B and instead everything I want to do now will make things more difficult. I would have made very different choices if I had this information from the beginning, or at least when he figured this out. 

Am I overreacting? Would it be better to continue to try and have a positive dialogue and instead talk to her about her beliefs? Also, wtf B??? Am I right to tell him that he should have told me, or am I out of line expecting to be told anything about the transphobia of one of his lovers? All I know right now is that none of this sits well with me. I do know that I want less of her in my presence and that I won’t put up with any of that nonsense around me. What would you do?

Oh, and B just went on a couple dates with another woman who works for an organization that supports the trans community. I want to tell B he needs to let her know about L’s beliefs before introducing them so she’s not in the same space I am. Is saying that out of line?

I can’t figure out what is overreacting because being a trans ally is so important to me that my emotions are all over the place right now. ",3,1768600535.0,polyamory,1,1.0,False

1qetg26,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/1qetg26/nausea_at_a_specific_time_each_day/,Nausea at a specific time each day,"Hi all

I started Wegovy back in August last year (actually end of June)

I decided to not up my dosage every 4 weeks but slightly slower as my body generaly reacts to everything with nausea and vomiting - stress, unliked foods, pregnancy… 

I was feeling great at the beginning, I’d stay about 5 weeks on each dose

When I hit 1.7 I stayed on it for 6 weeks. 

But nausea started increasing, up until that point it was fine-ish

So instead of going to 2.4, I took that 2.4 pen and did 1.2 dosages, so my pen would last me 2 months and i’d use it all.

I am still having weight loss but at a slower pace which is ok. I started at 79kg and I am now at 68.5kg; goal weight is 62-65kg

Now to the important part that is my current issue.

I realised recently that I get nausea every day at 4-5pm

I tried switching my eating, I did:

Coffe w milk in the morning (7-8am)

Protein shake with some oat flakes at noon

Actual meal at 4-5pm (like meat and salad or healthy pasta or fish or sushi or whatever)

Then I tried removing coffee and drinking black tea with a splash of milk

Then I tried having breakfast in the morning (10-ish am) and then lunch aroun 1-2pm , and a protein shake in the evening

I tried further reducing portion size of lunch and instead eating a snack like fruit (apple or strawberry or blueberries)

I tried taking a nap in the afternoon, i tried taking a walk. Before the nausea, during the nausea..

Nothing seems to help or make it more or less bad.

I just get around 30-60min of nausea at the same time every day.

The intensity is not different on days closer or further away from my (sunday evening) dose. 

It doesnt change if I switch to, say, Monday morning either.

Blackhawks got off to a nice 1-0 start but gave up 2 goals (1 of them on Hawks power play, short-handed goal) in the next 5 mins of the 1st period. Bedard could not get anything going. But this was a great matchup for him, he just did not have his day. **7+ points in his last 2 games vs the Flames (including a hat trick on his last matchup)**. He still has the most goals against this team. I took a shot and I would do it again in a heartbeat against the Flames.

My initial POTD was **SGA U 31.5 Points ✅**or **SGA U 41.5 PAR✅** The only reason why I didn't go to the NBA because I don't like doing b2b POTDs on handicapping the NBA (I still feel the Association hates me). Other picks were **Leon Draisaitl Goalscorer**❌ and **Sidney Crosby Goalscore**r✅

**Matchup:** Going to the b2b matchup between the Cavs and the Sixers. Cavs not just recently won the last matchup (2 days ago) but also won the first matchup as well and are looking for the season sweep. I think Sixers make the proper adjustments and Maxey have a positive regression against the Cavs. Sixers are a solid team after a losing effort (recently went b2b matchup wit the Raptors. They dropped the first game but handled them in the 2nd game) and Cavs still give up a ton of points, their defense has been somewhat concerning to this season. So it makes perfect sense for me to take the home team Sixers to win this game outright on a near PK price (actually line has moved up to clear favorite to Sixers), but I'm going to take what I am more confident in and that's the total in this game. I like this game total O 232.5 for a few reasons. **First is that I expect the Sixers to respond, avoid the sweep and Cavs to play catch up. That's how I think the gamescript goes for this last matchup, Sixers takes a massive lead and Cavs tries to cut the deficit.**

Second reason why I like this total is that **it opened at O/U 234.5 and it's moved down to O/U 232.5 (-112). It's a low total and both these teams have gone way above this line in their previous 2 games this season.**

I think part of the reason why it moved down a couple points is that **Darius Garland is out and he is a massive playmaker/offensive boost for the Cavs, but I think we are going to be fine wit this low total**. Donovan Mitchell is a scoring machine and he can find a way to put up points and I just think the Sixers just go heavy attack on the offense, more Maxey blitz to the hoop and ton of three point outputs. Sixers also got Oubre Jr back, I suspect someone else will step up too, not just Maxey. I think Edgecombe, Embiid and even PG-13 could battle to avoid a season sweep, take the O 232.5

**The Play & Prediction :** 1.12U on O 232.5 on $DKNG, playable up to O 243.5 IMO (Sprinkle if you want to get plus money or longshot odds). I think you all kno who I like to win this game, but predicting winning team gets 125 and losing team gets 119.

The end is drawing near, but who knos what the future holds. I will never rule out a possibility of handicapping POTDs in 2026 and beyond. For all these years I have been handicapping on Sportsbook subreddit and thru my very own reddit channel, I have nothing but gratitude. If you like to express your appreciation for these POTD writeup/analysis, wagers, and recommendations, here are several ways how you can.

1qetdwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/GLP1ResearchTalk/comments/1qetdwo/nausea_at_a_specific_time_each_day/,Nausea at a specific time each day,"Hi all

I started Wegovy back in August last year (actually end of June)

I decided to not up my dosage every 4 weeks but slightly slower as my body generaly reacts to everything with nausea and vomiting - stress, unliked foods, pregnancy… 

I was feeling great at the beginning, I’d stay about 5 weeks on each dose

When I hit 1.7 I stayed on it for 6 weeks. 

But nausea started increasing, up until that point it was fine-ish

So instead of going to 2.4, I took that 2.4 pen and did 1.2 dosages, so my pen would last me 2 months and i’d use it all.

I am still having weight loss but at a slower pace which is ok. I started at 79kg and I am now at 68.5kg; goal weight is 62-65kg

Now to the important part that is my current issue.

I realised recently that I get nausea every day at 4-5pm

I tried switching my eating, I did:

Coffe w milk in the morning (7-8am)

Protein shake with some oat flakes at noon

Actual meal at 4-5pm (like meat and salad or healthy pasta or fish or sushi or whatever)

Then I tried removing coffee and drinking black tea with a splash of milk

Then I tried having breakfast in the morning (10-ish am) and then lunch aroun 1-2pm , and a protein shake in the evening

I tried further reducing portion size of lunch and instead eating a snack like fruit (apple or strawberry or blueberries)

I tried taking a nap in the afternoon, i tried taking a walk. Before the nausea, during the nausea..

Nothing seems to help or make it more or less bad.

I just get around 30-60min of nausea at the same time every day.

The intensity is not different on days closer or further away from my (sunday evening) dose. 

It doesnt change if I switch to, say, Monday morning either.

Anyone experience something similar? Any clue why this might happen?",1,1768600318.0,GLP1ResearchTalk,0,1.0,False
1qetduc,https://www.reddit.com/r/estimators/comments/1qetduc/looking_for_input_on_an_idea/,Looking For Input On An Idea,"In my 27 years as an estimator, I’ve experienced office life in a variety of settings. My early years were spent with a good-sized, multi-trade regional subcontractor. Later, I became a partner in a startup that handled light gauge framing and drywall, as well as commercial rubber and metal roofing.

In the beginning, I had a nice office. When we launched the startup, though, we worked out of a small, cramped converted house we rented. Eventually, we moved into a larger, nicer converted house, and finally into a beautiful 8,000-square-foot office and warehouse. In the final stretch of my 27-year journey, the drywall division was spun off into a separate corporation that my partner and I ran from my home’s basement—functional, comfortable, and well set up, but nothing fancy.

Across all those years and all those offices, one issue stayed consistent: a decent coffee station was hard to come by. Most of the time, we had an instant hot-water faucet in a kitchenette, a jar of instant coffee, or a single or double pot Mr. Coffee. God help you if the wrong person made the coffee that morning! I once caught our warehouse manager—on a Monday morning, no less—throwing fresh grounds *on top of* Friday’s used ones. That pot was awful, and he was immediately banned from coffee duty forever.

Lately, I’ve been thinking about starting a small “Honor Box Snack” business with some of my great-grandkids—to help teach them about money, saving, and maybe a bit of work ethic. We even planned to donate a portion of the proceeds to Alzheimer’s research charities. They’re homeschooled by my granddaughter (their mom), and it would have fit nicely into their lessons. But with their busy schedules full of sports and other activities, it wasn’t practical—so that idea went on the back burner.

Still, the thought stuck with me. Remembering all that bad coffee over the years got me thinking: what if the idea evolved into a simple, affordable coffee and snack setup that could serve small offices—especially estimators like me? A selection of Keurig coffee pods, flavored syrup “shooters,” tea pods or bags for non-coffee drinkers, maybe water-flavoring packets, single-serve microwave oatmeal or mac & cheese, granola bars… and for the old-school folks, maybe even some Maalox for those coffee-fueled ulcers!

Estimators work hard. We give up a lot and often get little thanks for the time we put in, the skipped meals, or the long hours. There were so many late nights when all I wanted was an easy way to grab a quick coffee, tea, or snack—to take a short break, think, or just rest my eyes.

Of course, an office setup like this would serve everyone, not just estimators—but that’s just where my thoughts go first. Maybe it’s a bit off the wall, but in my experience, estimators have always been fueled by bad coffee and Goody Powders.

So here are my questions for you:

* How does your company handle this—do you have coffee and snack options, or are you on your own like I was most of the time?
* If you had a say, what would make your workday easier or more enjoyable?
* How should it be paid for—and do you think a company would treat it as a perk?
* Could an “Honor Box” or Venmo/QR-code style payment system actually work?

1qetdhm,https://www.reddit.com/r/LAlist/comments/1qetdhm/inside_safe_program_is_a_sham/,Inside Safe program is a sham!,"Hello all, I am currently an participannt/resident in the Inside Safe Program through Mayor Karen Bass. The non-profit that currently manages the site i live at is Harbor Interfaith Services. I am currently in need of assistance with housing because i have gotten an unfair 30 day evicition notice from new program manager Keira Adams. I however am going to appeal and fight this notice.

I want to expose the people running/managing on site services here. Matthew Morash was the prior program manager for Harbor Interfaith and what a mess things were with him managing. He relapsed and was working whilst still getting high. Residents noted his odd behavior such as entering residents rooms without permission to steal drugs from them. Coming on site slurring, sweaty, and just clearly under the influence. He was recently discovered od'd in the parking lot of Harbor Interfaith. not sure if he was given leave or fired. i heard he was in rehab. 

we have been here now OVER TWO YEARS!!! And believe it or not we still have not been housed. I actually was matched to a converted motel 6 which is currently managed by Brilliant Corners. The reason I turned away this match is because The case worker whose name is Brian Bonilla called to ask me if i could think or come up with someone i could borrow $100.00 from so they could hold the room they had matched me with for me!! yes. come to find out that this should not have happened. to me it seemed un ethical i got a bad feeling it seemed a wrong way to get into a housing contract with a place like this so i turned down the match. i in no uncertain terms told Matt Morash exactly what had occured and he still insisted that it was such a good opportunity! right. 

two years many residents have not gone to view any housing, that i can think now of the residents whom came from the encampment i came from  4 have been housed. thats it. my ex boyfriend has congestive heart failure they have not matched him to anything and he needs housing right away. quite the contrary the staff has bought liquor bottles from him asked him to give them some of his heart medications. staff has been present in the rooms where residents have gotten high and are aware that residents get high. now that there is a new program manager Keira Adams she has begun enforcing the rules gung ho. this is the reason she gave me my eviction notice. i had stepped into a friends room to gather my coffee and creamer to make iced coffee and decided to head the water in the microwave whilst i was there. when the security went and knocked they said to either open the door to which i said our cats would then get out so i decided to gather my shit and leave the room. i was not told i would  be written up nor that they would report the incident to Keira Adams. i did after all listen and got my things and went back to my room. the security guard that works for black knight security quite condescendingly told me just go to your room which seemed off putting to me to which i said dont say that to me it makes me want to do the exact opposite. he then said it again i told him he was just security not the RA to which he said he was the one that set the rules A security guard!! the RA was standing right next to him and said nothing to clear up that he in fact is just security. (which Keira adams) told me this morning. anyway i cant recall what i said to which the security guard then said to me:try me. i couldnt believe id heard that so asked him to which he repeated it. i decided it wasnt worth it and left

  
for two years we have been permitted to visit one anothers rooms with the doors closed. have been permitted to spend the night in one anothers rooms. we were pretty much coming and going as we pleased. people that didnt live here were permitted to visit as well. matt morash was here at his then job while under the influence!! other staff i have heard drink while on the clock. they have been in residents rooms whilst the residents have gotten high and well knew of it. now all of a sudden under the management of Keira Adams she is enforcing the rules without giving us prior notice. staff currrently present still well know the way things were being run yet they have chosen to stay quiet and say nothing about the way in which Keira has been treating myself and other residents. how can they now enforce rules that for over two years have not been? i have been given eviction notice for having been in my exes room last night. i want to expose this program the mayor and whomever else. they have not helped us find either interim nor temporary housing. as i said i was charged 100 dollars for the non profit running the motel 6 to hold a room for me. something needs to get done. bring light to the fact that homeless services are not really being given. we were told things that have not happened. 

the rules state we cannot do illegal things in our rooms. we are drug addicts and they knew this prior to them taking our rv's and bringing us here. as stated staff saw and were well aware that likely all residents here get high. why else would they have narcan readily available in case anyone overdoses. therefore now under Keira Adams they are entering our rooms without due reason rummaging through our drawers where of course we will have pipes foils and whatever paraphernelia. us getting high was not an issue prior. they were not going through our belongings and confiscating our things. now they have. she is chosing to write us up put us under a behavioral contract and not given a chance like myself given a 30 day eviction notice. i need help. any and all. i have begun making calls attempting to reach out to appeal this but am unsure of whom to call or speak to. 

i am willing to go on the record to expose the way in which this inside safe program is doing not much if anything to help those homeless get housed. do people not think it isnt depressing having to live in  a motel room between two walls where you cant get much fresh air because of being stuck between two tall building walls. thats my current situation. i was going to manicuring school at afoc but did not like it. i have spoken with my job connector and am currently waiting to receive word that i can go and take the class to receive my guard card and hopefully shortly employment. so they cant say that some people have not sought the help nor taken steps towards bettering the situation. in what pertains to inside safe its a joke. these non profits receiving all these funds from lahsa lacda etc to only misappropriate tax payer money. nobody is being housed in a timely manner not even close. these people dont give a hoot too much. some speak down to us treat us condescedingly and it is permitted. like the security guard said to me last night. Keke or Keira did not state she would address it with him she instead gave me my 30 day eviction notice. oh yeah and she has a nice looking brand new car and so does matt morash. i wonder how they could afford them. im just saying and other residents have wondered the same. please help me fight this. help me!!",4,1768600288.0,LAlist,1,1.0,False

New to this sub. I have a brokerage account that I transferred funds into. It took like, I don't know, 10-14 days for those funds to ""settle"". Seems excessive but I waited. Today they were settled and available to use, so I moved 8600 from brokerage to Traditional IRA account. The UI reflects that transfer immediately, and I received an email right away saying it was done. 

Now I want to move those funds to my Roth IRA, so I began the transfer process again, but when I get to the amount to move, it shows the pre-transfer balance available to move ($2 or something like that). I'm guessing I'll be told that I need to wait a full ""business day"" for the funds ""to fully settle"" after which I can move them into the Roth, which given that its after hours now on a Friday, and Monday is a holiday, will be sometime Tuesday or end of day Tuesday.

 I'm having a hard time with this. I already waited two weeks to let the cash settle. Obviously Fidelity knows I have that money, and they know all 3 accounts are mine. I don't really know what ""settling"" means in this regard--it's not like I have to wait in line for the next Fidelity rep to review my submitted paperwork, go into the vault, pull out 8600, count it all up, prove it to me it's the right amount, and then walk it back over to the Roth vault. We're talking about software here. This should take milliseconds to complete, given that even if extra due diligence is needed to prevent fraud etc. that was already done over the last 2 weeks. Help me make sense of this. Am I waiting for a Fidelity rep to clock in on Tuesday after getting coffee and a donut to press the green button on my transaction?

I had pre ground espresso from Huckleberry roasters in Denver (they ground the beans). I’m getting to the end of my bag and plan on ordering a DF54 or DF64 grinder (I also go between a chemex or pourover). I have a normcore 51mm naked bottomless non pressurized portafilter (except now I’m questioning if it will work in this machine as the portafilter that came with the machine has three prongs at the top whereas the normcore portafilter has two) I will start using, however this machine has a timed release for extraction. Is this just a matter of dialing in? Is it possible to use this portafilter? ",1,1768599352.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

1qeswh7,https://i.redd.it/5c19iz5k2sdg1.jpeg,New grinder day [CF64V] - my initial thoughts,"Ignore the mess, I just sent 2lbs of the nastiest coffee HEB has to offer through this thing.

  
I was so excited to get this today. Ordered from MiiCoffee, with the SSP Uniform burrs and it arrived within days. Also, oddly, it's as cheap as the pre-order for their DF64. This (compared to the DF) has a brushless motor and a vertical stack, which aligns it a lot to the Timemore systems people often suggest.

  
This was my first time ever ""dialing"" a new grinder. As soon as I replaced the stock burrs with the SSP set, I marked them and checked the alignment. These are fatter burrs, so the setting dial needed to be re-adjusted. After chirping them and taking it back a part, the bottom burr was perfect, but the top needed a single adjustment to one side (small amount of foil did the trick.)

  
After everything was reinstalled, I ran about 2lbs of a fairly oily bean through it. It had moments where it stalled the grind, so I had to back off to a courser setting. Once the 2lbs were finished, the stalling seemed to have stopped and the grinding chugged along without a fuss. (other than the weird random squealing). 

  
So for my normal bean (medium/light) I find that a super low setting of 4 is what is needed for a 1:2 extraction. I've read most people land on 10-15, so not sure what is different about mine. Maybe it's the burrs?

  
Anyways, the output is outstanding. Much more uniform than what I was getting from my Shardor system. I love the low volume, lack of mess and most importantly, ALMOST NO RETENTION. Seriously.. I was constantly testing this while going through the 2lbs of seasoning beans and, without cleaning, it kept a .0 - .1 of beans per grind.

  
Build quality is OK- top heavy (obviously) and fairly simple overall. What you see is what you get. The only build issue or defect is that all of the magnets that hold the grind setting plate on were loose in the box. Literally none of them snap properly in their sockets. Fixed it myself fairly easily by applying a little heat to the plastic and ""reforming"" the sockets around the magnets.

  
Not sure why I ordered the SSP burrs, to be honest. I didn't even give the stock ones a chance. Probably wasted money on my part. 



TL;DR: Definite upgrade over my Shardor 64 system. It's quieter, has almost no retention and is super affordable. ",6,1768599182.0,espresso,1,0.88,False

1qesuxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cruise/comments/1qesuxn/virgin_voyages_completely_changed/,Virgin Voyages - Completely changed…,"We have just done an 11 night Brilliant Lady sailing out of Miami, we had previously done an 11 night Resilient Lady sailing from San Juan last January. 

For reference, we are a couple in our 30s with no kids - what I would have thought was the target market for VV. 

We loved our Resilient Lady sailing, it was so much fun if not overwhelming at times. It was a great atmosphere where we met like minded people, partied but also had our quiet relaxing moments. 

But our Brilliant Lady sailing couldn’t have been more different. Very different demographic skewing far older, very insular and bringing in the likes of people who started unsolicited lectures on how amazing Trump is. Politics has no place on our holidays, despite being right wing myself. 

The entertainment was far more toned down especially on newer shows, and some shows never made an appearance on the schedule. We really liked Up With A Twist, Duel Reality, Out of Time and Diva Goes West. The biggest flop being Red Hot, a story with so much potential yet a very amateur production. A ridiculous amount of AI, very noisy with so much going on with dancing whilst trying to read the screens. We very much preferred the adult humour of Lola’s Library on Resilient though. 

There was an awful lot of bingo and many of the free events we attended last year didn’t exist on this sailing. We missed colouring in, learning how tattoos are done with the guest artists, dodgeball etc. We found so many upcharge events on this sailing, and when we did do Painting and Boozy Bevvies we felt like the odd ones out. We have been together for 11 years, engaged for 8 and we had other guests telling us we have commitment issues as we had not yet got married. We haven’t got married due to the costs of it, yet these guests thought it was acceptable to pull our relationship apart in front of people. Again, the older generation. 

We felt like there was a lot more entitlement on this trip; rudeness, cutting in lines, littering (coffee cups left in elevators) and talking over tour guides on excursions. We couldn’t hear our guide on the bus in Grand Cayman due to surrounding guests talking at excessive levels. 

We were so bored on this trip that we stayed in bed on a few sea days, never had that issue on our Resilient sailing. How can two cruises with the same length and line in the same region be so different? 

We cannot fault the staff and the food on this sailing was fantastic, far superior to Resilient. But we won’t be booking VV anymore due to the people it is now pulling in. Part of that will be down to increasing prices, but VV should be distinguishing itself and not trying to blend in with other lines. If I wanted a mature sailing for adults only I’d pick Viking, but VV is supposed to be for the young at heart and the open minded. 

We know that the shorter sailings are more skewed for younger sailors but that isn’t for us, we prefer longer sailings to justify air fare. So I think that’s us out of the market for now and will be looking for alternatives. ",0,1768599077.0,Cruise,21,0.45,False

1qesun1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qesun1/i_thought_my_autocorrect_was_broken_then_my_phone/,"I thought my autocorrect was broken. Then my phone started typing ""He's watching you type this""","I’ve always been a fast typer. My thumbs move across the screen without me even looking, trusting the auto-correct to fix my mistakes. I was sitting on my couch last night, scrolling through social media, when I realized it was past 11:00 PM. I knew my mom would be worrying, so I opened our chat to send a quick update.

I typed: Hey, just got home. I’m safe.

I hit send without looking. A second later, I glanced at the bubble. The text didn't say ""I'm safe."" It said: Hey, just got home. I’m in the basement.

I frowned. That was a weird glitch. I tapped the text box and tried again. Sorry, typo. I meant to say I'm safe.

I watched the screen this time. As soon as I hit the spacebar after ""safe,"" the letters flickered and danced. The word deleted itself and replaced itself with the same creepy phrase: I’m in the basement.

My heart gave a small thud. I don't even have a basement. I live in a second-story apartment with nothing but a concrete foundation and a parking garage below me.

I went into my settings and turned off auto-correct and predictive text. I went back to the chat, determined to fix the mistake.

I typed: My phone is acting up. I am S-A-F-E.

Before I could hit the send arrow, the phone vibrated violently in my hand. The cursor began to move on its own, flying across the white box. It deleted my message character by character. Then, a new sentence started typing itself out, the gray bubbles appearing as if someone was on the other side of my screen.

He is watching you type this.

I dropped the phone on the coffee table. It landed face up, the screen glowing in the dark room. I looked around my apartment. Everything was quiet. The front door was locked. The windows were shut. I was alone.

The phone buzzed again. A new message appeared in the box, but I hadn't touched the screen.

Don't look at the closet.

My eyes immediately darted to the bedroom door. The closet door was cracked open just an inch. I always keep it shut. I felt a cold sweat break out across my forehead. I reached for the phone, my hands shaking so hard I almost dropped it again. I tried to call 911, but every time I tapped the phone icon, the music app opened instead. It started playing a recording.

It was the sound of someone breathing. It was heavy, slow, and coming from a very small space.

I looked back at the text thread. A new message was waiting for me.

He likes it when you breathe fast. It makes the hunt shorter.

I stood up to run for the front door, but my phone screen flashed a bright, blinding red. A final message popped up, filling the entire screen in giant, bold letters:

Look behind the couch.

I didn't want to. I tried to keep my eyes forward, but I felt a hand—cold, thin, and smelling of old dirt wrap around my ankle from under the cushions.

My phone vibrated one last time on the table. It was a text from my mom.

Honey, why did you just send me a picture of yourself sleeping? And who is that standing in the corner of your room?

I looked at the screen, but the hand pulled me down before I could see the photo. The last thing I saw was my phone screen auto-correcting my final, unsent scream into the words: Everything is fine.",7,1768599058.0,nosleep,0,0.89,False

The book is already 180 pages of short stories drafted. I am now editing, as well as adding illustrations and graphics to make it a full coffee-table experience. Backers will be able to get signed editions, early digital access, and some behind-the-scenes extras.

Looking for opinions please!

I (25F) regularly work from a cafe, there’s a guy who works there who I’ve been pretty chatty with for 7 months or so. I think (?) he’s flirting with me - free extra shots in my coffee, sometimes comes to my table and brings me something, always remembers things about my life / asks how specific things I previously mentioned are. Winks and smiles at me, he starts making my drink as soon as I walk in, very intense eye contact, makes lots of jokes with me. I said thanks to him and colleagues before Christmas (I’m a regular and they’re all great) and he gave me a hug…just some signs I think he might like me a little bit? He also seems to try and get away to chat to me whenever there’s a chance (not complainingshahaha). He’s told me quite a lot about his life, family, plans etc. When we chat he will often come and quietly say something in my ear almost or will touch my shoulder lightly.  He is NOT like this at all with other customers, he’s polite but not friendly or flirtatious like this. He’s very sweet in his way of doing all these things and genuinely is a kind guy from all I’ve observed.

Today he came over and said he will be leaving next month for a new job (he’s almost sure he will take the new job). New job is very close for context.

Should I ask his name or number next time I see him or is it inappropriate? I’m quite into him, he’s extremely polite and well mannered, I imagine very gentlemanly in the outside world and not a “player” type- I wonder if maybe he wants me to say something first because he’s in his workplace and doesn’t want to be improper ? Or some men worry about being seen as creepy these days? I’ve been told I can seem a little intimidating to men, but we have a very natural flow between us so I don’t think he finds me scary.

He’s never mentioned a girlfriend and is two years older than me. He’s like this with me openly in front of colleagues and manager, they are also very nice. It’s not a small business and we are in the UK. 

Just not sure what is acceptable in the dating world these days as I know a lot of people are on apps - how to navigate this, should I ask or see if he does?",1,1768598875.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

i went to talk to OW/ODSP today to try and link up with a worker, but wasn't allowed to speak to anyone in person.  apparently, we don't do things in person anymore, we're all cyperpoors.  i just got redirected to the service help line and 'my benefits' online.  the old world charm of waiting rooms is gone.  at least i was able to find out that my application is actually being processed, and i'm sure there's a lot of work to do on their end, but it would still be nice to see a real person.  also, this is another round of medications that won't be covered by any insurance and i honestly can't afford them.  have to ask for help from my parents which i absolutely hate.  oh well, i did the best i could.  also my creditors will just go hungry this month, poor things.

my family doctor is a walk-in clinic doctor and only works certain days and i haven't bothered checking to see if tomorrow is one of these days.  i'd make an appointment to see her because it's better than showing up as a walk-in, but i'd like to just go get this done whether she's there or not.  also i'd like to have a reason to be out of the house tomorrow and the clinic isn't open on sundays.  i'll go get my blood pressure taken and ask for my 'pril' ACE inhibitor from whatever doctor is there.

while i'm making all this work for myself, i created a resume for the job i'd like to have as a PSW once my brain is more betterer.  i know you can do mock interviews at job zone, i've done them before, and it might be a good idea before going out there and blowing a real interview somewhere i'd actually like to work.  i'm really glad i've never been arrested (to my knowledge) and don't have a criminal record (to my knowledge) and can still work with the vulnerable sector (to my knowledge).  now that i think of it, i might want to add my police check to my resume.  oh well, it's a work in progress.  we'll see what job zone thinks.

it was pretty cold out today, probably close to -20 with the wind.  i was out there, walking.  there's a house i really want to find that i saw during my manic episode.  at the time, it was house i was intent on buying, if i ever found the money.  to my mind, it met the criteria of ""ugly on the outside, nice on the inside, no windows,"" which is exactly what you need, no matter the city or the situation.

i was texting a friend of mine and we're still meeting for coffee on wednesday.  i'm sure it's a relief for them knowing i'm not going to be a total mess when they see me or need all of their help getting my life back in order after this event.  i just want them there as a friend and i might need a bit of help now and then related to work or school because we have the same background.  i really hope we can stay friends and be even closer in the future. i hated completely blocking them out for a couple of months while everything came to a head.  i really would rather have not, but i wasn't sure what else to do.  i didn't want to turn to them for help or lie and say i'd taken the licensing exam for our course and that things were going well for me.  i feel a lot better now that i can be honest about what's happening.",1,1768598852.0,deardiary,0,1.0,False

1qesqtv,https://youtu.be/OIsDgumvqE8?si=03vAHHL1td8nXG-q,Antibalas - N.E.S.T.A. 75 (2003),"“The Antibalas Afrobeat Orchestra is politically minded and powerful, with a lineup that includes Latinos, whites, blacks from America and Africa, and Asian Americans. “This 14-plus-piece band hits hard with the left and the right,” says the Antibalas website (www.antibalas.com). “Monstrous horns and bass layered over funky polyrhythmic beats and breaks, coupled with furious lyrics challenging and attacking the dehumanizing capitalist system and inciting insurrection in English, Yoruba, and Spanish.” 

For a protest album, the band’s latest, Talkatif, contains remarkably few lyrics. In fact, with titles like “War Is a Crime” and “N.E.S.T.A. 75” (“Never Ever Submit to Authority”), most songs have no lyrics at all, which leads to the question: How does an entirely instrumental song make a political statement in English, Yoruba, and Spanish?

The answer is placement. Antibalas places its high-energy albums in the hands of the politically inclined and lets the music send those hands into yangalala — a traditionally African show of ecstasy with hands high and fingers spread. When the website asks its grassroots supporters to share the sound, it has a good idea where they should go: “We’ll need you to distribute fliers in record shops, bookstores, coffee houses, other venues, community centers, colleges, and wherever it seems appropriate.” “Appropriate” is anywhere you’d find people who vibe on the energy of communal expression.”

1qeskce,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qeskce,Four Seasons Hualalai Review for Families with Toddlers,"**Travel Dates**: January 2026

**Group**: Two adults, two toddlers (ages 3.5 and 20 months)

**About Us:** Active, adventurous family from a major US city with excellent food. We travel across a wide budget spectrum and do not usually repeat resorts. We prefer the outdoors and unique experiences over city trips.

**TLDR- Rating: 7/10**

9/10 as an adult, 5/10 as a parent of 2 toddlers. We enjoyed the experience as adults, but I won’t be coming back with my toddlers. I might consider when my youngest is 5. The resort and property are stunning. Paid golf, tennis, and other activities are great, but there’s very little for the 2/3/4 ages outside of pool & beach days. Also, there is a charge for almost everything, so it looses some points for the feeling of having to pay for everything.

Note that we stayed at the Four Seasons Punta Mita a few weeks ago which got a 9/10 from me (review), so some of my ratings are based on what I know are alternatives for families with toddlers looking for warm, tropical destinations in the winter. There are going to be references to that stay, so if you find it annoying just skip over.

⸻

**Vibe & Location: 9/10**

The property is stunning and feels very intimate, despite having four distinct pool areas plus a Sports Club and Spa complex. It stretches along a long section of coastline with Big Island’s signature lava rock, connected by a paved walkway from end to end. The beach itself is shallow and more understated, with limited lounge chairs and simple service. This is not a beach-club style resort, and there are no full cabanas set directly on the sand.

The daily sunsets with the torch lightning ceremony and live music were a highlight.

Quick commute to/from airport.

⸻

**Arrival: 6/10**

They use a third-party for transportation which picked us up in an old minivan and didn’t have water or snacks. This is very different from other chubby resorts where you get picked up in an Escalade and it’s fully stocked with food & bevs. Luckily it’s not a long ride to the resort, but it’s an odd start when you’re dropping $15K+ on a vacation.

Check-in was nice with Mai Tai’s for the adults, a fruit drink for the kids, and pineapple snacks. It was fast and friendly.

The luggage service was a bit slow. We got in around 1PM and there is guaranteed check-in at 3PM. Our luggage arrived closer to 4PM.

⸻

**Rooms: 9/10**

The rooms were fantastic. We were in a 1BR Suite and the walls were thick enough so we could watch TV during nap time or at night when the kids were sleeping. If you have kids, make sure to ask your TA to get you a room on the ground floor. It was so convenient to open up our sliding doors to the terrace and out onto the lawn to the Seashell Pool and ‘Ulu Restaurant. It’s also convenient if you need to order room service but don’t want to wake up the kids. I would call/message in and ask them to deliver from the terrace. I rarely used our front door.

The provided crib was sturdy and comfortable for our little one, and the pull-out sofa worked well for our older toddler. Potty cover, step stools can be provided if you ask. 

Housekeeping was excellent at tidying kid toys, clearing the diaper genie, getting rid of sand that we dragged in. 

FS TV’s are annoying. We couldn’t get our iPhone to cast onto the main TV with the NFL Playoffs on Amazon Prime. They have screen share options if you’re Android. Luckily we brought our laptops to work so we streamed The Traitors on a screen bigger than our phone. (Side note: the TV by Hualalai Trading Company also couldn’t get Amazon Prime, so you had people huddling around individual tables with their iPhones/iPads watching the game).

⸻

**Service and Staff: 6.5/10**

The staff were all very friendly, most were timely/available. We had a lot of great poolside staff at Seashell and King’s Pond. The spa staff were great, and the tennis coaches were wonderful.

But the day-to-day service was incredibly impersonal. A lot of generic “aloha’s” but none of the staff really remembered your name. (I noticed many guests had been here 20+ years in a row, and we don’t fit into this category!). 

As an example, in FS Punta Mita, by the time we left, all the staff including bellmen, servers, etc. knew our kids nicknames and would say hi \[name\] to them as we passed. Some would stop to chit chat to our kids. Many of the servers remembered our coffee order at breakfast. At FS Hualalai, the kids club staff more or less ignored my kids (more on that below). 

Even after a full week at FS Hualalai, we still had to provide our name and room number at breakfast every morning, despite seeing many of the same staff day to day. The service was consistently friendly and professional, but it felt more procedural than personal. Nothing was ever unpleasant, I just expected a slightly more personalized touch for a stay of that length.

⸻

**FOOD**

Food across Hawaii is expensive. And personally apart from the staples, I never find it that great, even outside of the resort. 7/10 is a high rating for me in Hawaii standards!

I wish they had more Hawaiian food at the resort. It feels weird to leave a Hawaii vacation and not have any spam musubi’s, kalua pork, garlic shrimp, poi or a traditional loco moco (they have a short rib loco moco with fried rice). We did leave the resort in search of different food options.

**Kids Food: 6/10**

Kids Under 4 Eat Free: This program was a lot more restrictive at FS Hualalai than FS Punta Mita (which got a 10/10 score for kids food). Kids only eat free at Beach Tree or ‘ULU, and the menu is very limited. Geared towards picky eaters (think chicken tenders and plain pasta), and my kids got tired of it fast. 

They also apparently limit it to 1 entree per kid, which is strange because the individual entrees are  nutritionally unbalanced. For example, the plain pasta with red sauce is free, but the spaghetti with meatballs is not free. So if you want a protein, you’d have to order the chicken tenders and the plain pasta. Both of these don’t have sufficient fiber, so if you want fruit or veggies, that’s a 3rd order for one kid. We were blocked a few times from ordering more than 1 thing but sometimes the staff would let us order a couple things.

You also need to be vigilant about checking your bill. There were a couple times where we were charged for the Keiki meals, and we had to remind the waiter to take it off the bill.

FS Punta Mita had free room service and free pool/beach-side service for kids, so we were able to order them snacks around 10AM or 3PM, but couldn’t at FS Hualalai without a charge. Overall just found FS Punta Mita more convenient because long sit-down meals are hard at this age!

We ended up paying for some of our kids’ meals, which at $14-$21/dish actually felt cheap by Hawaii standards. But it goes to the overall theme of feeling like we were charged for everything.

‘**ULU**

\- Breakfast: 7/10

\- Dinner: 7/10

The breakfast buffet was varied and offered both salad options, Asian-fusion options, as well as the traditional American breakfast fare. Favorites from the buffet included the Ube pancakes (pancake flavor rotates), banana bread, miso soup, made to order omelette station, and yogurt station.

I wish they had more variety of tropical fruit, like coconut, guava, lychee, passionfruit. They had longan, papaya, pineapple. The dim sum options were also a letdown. A bit of a nitpick, but I wish they had plain white rice in a rice cooker, instead of the fried rice.

I originally wasn’t going to go to dinner after hearing about the $80 beef & broccoli dish, but ended up getting sick of Beach Tree so we went on our last night. The sourdough bread with miso butter was delicious. Also liked the table side poke with taro chips. I enjoyed the chocolate soufflé, it wasn’t super sweet.

**Beach Tree: 7/10**

Italian food with live music at night that starts a little right before sunset. There is a lounge area of Beach Tree that is first-come first-served, and a good place to sit with young kids because they can play on the beach across the paved walkway if they’re restless. Kids will dance on the lawn to the live music too!

The food itself was good but nothing that I’m craving afterwards. My favorite from the menu was the lobster pasta. 

**NOIO: 8/10**

The best food we had at the resort. We opted for the omakase which was crazy expensive for what it was. At $395, it was comparable to the $250 omakases we get back home. But your average entree at the other restaurants is $55, so after you calibrate everything, it probably wasn’t that bad. A lot of umami elements on the omakase. They used heavier flavor profiles, and also featured some firmer and “fishier” fish. Some of the guests who weren’t accustomed to omakase did not seem to like their meal, but I thought it was good. The shaved ice dessert was exceptional, and we loved the butter mochi and chopsticks take-home gift. 

**MILLER & LUXE: 7/10**

We were originally excited to try Miller & Luxe because the menu we saw had Japanese A5 Wagyu, but when we arrived, they didn’t have it on the menu. We opted for the Australian Wagyu but it’s not just not the same! Thought the meat was good but a little heavy on the salt. A small portion of the pieces were tough to chew and I had to swallow a chunk of it. The meat didn’t need any of the sauces and I’m glad our waiter recommended not using it.

We liked the popovers and the kids meal options (paid) though. And the view of the golf course was beautiful for sunset. 

⸻

**AMENITIES**

**Free Laundry: 10/10**

Clothes get smelly in humidity fast. The free laundry rooms are scattered across the property and were very convenient.

**Kids Activities: 6/10, Adult Activities: 8.5/10**

My husband and I really enjoyed the tennis program. This was a main draw for us and I’m glad it lived up to expectations! I like the indoor/outdoor vibe of the Sports Center, and the quality of the tennis program was top notch. The gym could’ve had more equipment if you lift - think basic dumbbells and machines. I tried some of the paid fitness classes as well and those were great. 

Our friends said the golf was great - “8/10. Forgiving course with less water to lose the ball but lava rock still punishes you. Had a blast playing. To be a 9 or 10, I would want more holes with the ocean nearby but they reserve that space for residents so it makes sense.”

The paid adult activities are great but there are basically no toddler-friendly activities aside from hanging by the pool or beach. We had fun watching the fish from above at King’s Pond, but at 3.5 and 1.5 they don’t know how to use a snorkel. We were missing things like smores at the beach, interacting with other animals, anything with Hawaiian culture for the kids.

Most of the activities are also paid (chatGPT says it’s 64%). Many of the chubby resorts we’ve stayed at previously included more complimentary daily activities. Most of the complimentary activities are the different times of the touch tank, which we did every day. The eagle ray discussion and fish feeding were always during nap time so we never went. Most of the Cultural Center activities are ages 12+.

For adult activities, my ding is that you have to travel for most of the activities. E.g., no surfing on-site, no shore fishing on-site, no sea turtle education programs. They actually stopped offering surfing because of mixed reviews with their previous partner, so you have to find a company yourself and figure out transport. Overall, highly recommend leaving the resort and doing the Big Island activities - I’ve done them previously so didn’t do it on this trip with the young kids. Manta Rays and Volcanoes National Park are super fun.

**Kids Club: 5.5/10**

It was an open play area with some toddler toys (Magnetiles, dinosaur and sea creature figurines, some 1 year old cars, and a fishing game) but not a ton. There is an outdoor play house, but no swings.

You have to be 5 to use the kids club unsupervised, but previously at the FS Punta Mita, our kids were allowed to participate in the activities - they just had to be supervised. For example, one of the most memorable kids club activities in Punta Mita was the group piñata activity. Here, they weren’t allowed to participate with the group at all. They separated all the 5+ kids and the under 5 kids. They’d give you the materials for the activity, but you’d have to do them on an outside picnic table.

Also, none of the kids club staff interacted with our kids. This was perhaps the biggest letdown for me. I wrote in my FS Punta Mita review that the kids staff jumped in, played with our kids, and were overall incredibly friendly and seemed to genuinely love kids. My kids left FS Punta Mita with a huge box of cool arts and crafts (as in, more interesting than a crayon and paper). At FS Hualalai, after the initial hello, the kids club staff completely ignored us - even though we were the only kids in there for at least an hour. Even with some of the older kids, I saw that they were doing art activities with very little engagement from the staff.

**Pools and Beaches: 9/10**

This is another main draw of Hualalai. The 4 distinct pool areas are wonderful, and they have an “Ocean Pool” which is a calmer area in the ocean that you can swim in.

We preferred the pool by Kings Pond because it’s the warmer (it’s more shallow), and the layered views are epic. The Seashell Pool is fine, but close to the Keiki Pool and the box with sand toys. The Keiki Pool is a good option for the 1 year olds. Although the area is small, it’s nice that they have a little sand/beach area. I also like that they have a designated quiet pool, and a separate adult pool.

The beach area is shallow, so I think the biggest ding here is the lack of service on the beach area. There are a couple chairs, but it’s not somewhere where most guests are laying out on the beach with cabanas. 

I liked going into the tide pools and low tide and checking out all the sea creatures there. My kids and I had fun finding sea cucumbers, crabs, etc. Watch out for the spiny urchins! You have to find everything yourself, no guided tours or anything! I would sometimes find something and call other parents with toddlers over so their kid could see the sea snail, sea cucumber, etc. 

We heard that you can usually find turtles on the beach but we didn’t see any, so we made our own adventure outside the resort to find them.

Free popsicles which is standard for most FS. Also frozen grapes. I really appreciated the person who came around to clean sunglasses.

The poolside foot massage is also fantastic. Well worth the money. 

⸻

**Overall Value for Money: 7/10**

The flight to Hawaii has gotten really cheap late 2025 and 2026, so we were able to snag direct flights for around $250. The room prices were comparable to other tropical FS for us, though we were able to snag a good deal by traveling on non-school break dates. When you add up the “small” charges for all the extra food and activities, it ends up being an extra $300-400 for a family of 4/day. ",20,1768598396.0,chubbytravel,1,0.95,False

Most human behavior is learned behavior. Most things the human being learns are gained through an indirect relationship to the object. Humans do not act from instinct as lower animals do. Those things learned indirectly many times stimulate very effective responses to what might be later a direct experience. At this time the black masses are handling the resistance incorrectly. The brothers in East Oakland learned from Watts a means of resistance fighting by amassing the people in the streets, throwing bricks and molotov cocktails to destroy property and create disruption. The brothers and sisters in the streets were herded into a small area by the gestapo police and immediately contained by the brutal violence of the oppressor’s storm troops. This manner of resistance is sporadic, short-lived, and costly in violence against the people. This method has been transmitted to all the ghettos of the black nation across the country. The first man who threw a molotov cocktail is not personally known by the masses, but yet the action was respected and followed by the people.

The Vanguard Party must provide leadership for the people. It must teach the correct strategic methods of prolonged resistance through literature and activities. If the activities of the party are respected by the people, the people will follow the example. This is the primary job of the party. This knowledge will probably be gained secondhand by the masses just as the above mentioned was gained indirectly. When the people learn that it is no longer advantageous for them to resist by going into the streets in large numbers, and when they see the advantage in the activities of the guerrilla warfare method, they will quickly follow this example.

But first, they must respect the party which is transmitting this message. When the Vanguard group destroys the machinery of the oppressor by dealing with him in small groups of three and four, and then escapes the might of the oppressor, the masses will be overjoyed and will adhere to this correct strategy. When the masses hear that a gestapo policeman has been executed while sipping coffee at a counter, and the revolutionary executioners fled without being traced, the masses will see the validity of this type of approach to resistance. It is not necessary to organize thirty million Black people in primary groups of two’s and three’s but it is important for the party to show the people how to go about revolution. During slavery, in which no vanguard party existed and forms of communication were severely restricted and insufficient, many slave revolts occurred.

There are basically three ways one can learn: through study, through observation, and through actual experience. The black community is basically composed of activists. The community learns through activity, either through observation of or participation in the activity. To study and learn is good but the actual experience is the best means of learning. The party must engage in activities that will teach the people. The black community is basically not a reading community. Therefore it is very significant that the vanguard group first be activists. Without this knowledge of the black community one could not gain the fundamental knowledge of the black revolution in racist America.

The main function of the party is to awaken the people and to teach them the strategic method of resisting the power structure, which is prepared not only to combat the resistance of the people with massive brutality, but to totally annihilate the black community, the black population.

If it is learned by the power structure that black people have “x” amount of guns in their possession, this will not stimulate the power structure to prepare itself with guns, because it is already more than prepared.

The result of this education will be positive for Black people in their resistance and negative for the power structure in its oppression, because the party always exemplifies revolutionary defiance. If the party is not going to make the people aware of the tools of liberation and the strategic method that is to be used, there will be no means by which the people will be mobilized properly.

The relationship between the vanguard party and the masses is a secondary relationship. The relationship between the members of the vanguard party is a primary relationship. It is important that the members of the vanguard group maintain a face-to-face relationship with each other. This is important if the party machinery is to be effective. It is impossible to put together functional party machinery or programs without this direct relationship. The members of the vanguard group should be tested revolutionaries. This will minimize the danger of Uncle Tom informers and opportunists.

The main purpose of a vanguard group should be to raise the consciousness of the masses through educational programs and certain physical activities the party will participate in. The sleeping masses must be bombarded with the correct approach to struggle through the activities of the vanguard party. Therefore, the masses must know that the party exists. The party must use all means available to get this information across to the masses. If the masses do not have knowledge of the party, it will be impossible for the masses to follow the program of the party.

The vanguard party is never underground in the beginning of its existence, because this would limit its effectiveness and educational processes. How can you teach people if the people do not know and respect you? The party must exist above ground as long as the dog power structure will allow, and hopefully when the party is forced to go underground the message of the party will already have been put across to the people. The vanguard party’s activities on the surface will necessarily be shortlived.

This is why it is so important that the party make a tremendous impact upon the people before it is driven into secrecy.

At this time, the people know the party exists, and they will seek out further information on the activities of this underground party.

Many would-be revolutionaries work under the fallacious illusion that the vanguard party is to be a secret organization that the power structure knows nothing about, and the masses know nothing about, except for occasional letters that come to their homes by night. Underground parties cannot distribute leaflets announcing an underground meeting. These are contradictions and inconsistencies of the so-called revolutionaries. The so-called revolutionaries are in fact afraid of the very danger that they are advocating for the people. These so-called revolutionaries want the people to say what they themselves are afraid to say, and the people to do what they themselves are afraid to do. This makes the so-called revolutionary a coward and a hypocrite.

If these imposters would investigate the history of revolution, they would see that the vanguard group always starts out above ground and is later driven underground by the aggressor. The Cuban Revolution exemplifies this fact; when Fidel Castro started to resist the butcher Batista and the American running dogs, he started by speaking on the campus of the University of Havana in public. He was later driven to the hills. His impact upon the dispossessed people of Cuba was very great and received with much respect. When he went into secrecy, Cuban people searched him out. People went to the hills to find him and his band of twelve. Castro handled the revolutionary struggle correctly. If the Chinese Revolution is investigated, it will be seen that the Communist Party was quiet on the surface so that they would be able to muster support from the masses. There are many areas one can read about to learn the correct approach, such as the revolution in Kenya, the Algerian Revolution, Fanon’s THE WRETCHED OF THE EARTH, the Russian Revolution, the works of Chairman Mao Tse-tung, and a host of others.

A revolutionary must realize that if he is sincere, death is imminent due to the fact that the things he is saying and doing are extremely dangerous. Without this realization, it is impossible to proceed as a revolutionary. The masses are constantly looking for a guide, a Messiah, to liberate them from the hands of the oppressor. The vanguard party must exemplify the characteristics of worthy leadership. Millions and millions of oppressed people might not know members of the vanguard party personally or directly, but they will gain through an indirect acquaintance the proper strategy for liberation via the mass media and the physical activities of the party. It is of prime importance that the vanguard party develop a political organ, such as a newspaper produced by the party, as well as employ strategically revolutionary art and destruction of the oppressor’s machinery. For example, Watts. The economy and property of the oppressor was destroyed to such an extent that no matter how the oppressor tried to whitewash the activities of the black brothers, the real nature and the real cause of the activity was communicated to every black community. For further example, no matter how the oppressor tries to distort and confuse the message of Brother Malcolm X, Black people all over the country understand it perfectly and welcome it.

The Black Panther Party for Self Defense teaches that in the final analysis, the amount of guns and defense weapons, such as hand grenades, bazookas, and other necessary equipment, will be supplied by taking these weapons from the power structure, as exemplified by the Viet Cong. Therefore, the greater the military preparation on the part of the oppressor, the greater is the availability of weapons for the black community. It is believed by some hypocrites that when the people are taught by the vanguard group to prepare for resistance, this only brings the man down on them with increasing violence and brutality; but the fact of the matter is that when the man becomes more oppressive, this only heightens the revolutionary fervor. The people never make revolution. The oppressors by their brutal actions cause the resistance by the people. The Vanguard Party only teaches the correct methods of resistance. So, if things can get worse for oppressed people, then they will feel no need for revolution or resistance. The complaint of the hypocrites that the Black Panther Party for Self Defense is exposing the people to deeper suffering is an incorrect observation. People have proved that they will not tolerate any more oppression by the racist dog police through their rebellions in the black communities across the country. The people are looking now for guidance to extend and strengthen their resistance struggle.

1qesj8f,https://i.redd.it/2pri6kt61sdg1.png,Ternary Moral Logic (TML) for ERNIE: How to Stop Hallucinating with Dignity,"By the time my monitor finished booting, the wall behind it had already judged me.

“用科技让复杂的世界更简单。”  
Use technology to make the complex world simple.

Very funny, I thought, sipping instant coffee that tasted like burned QR codes. If the universe had a sense of humor, it was definitely outsourcing its jokes to our slogan wall.

I am Senior Researcher Liu Wei, Alignment Group, Baidu ERNIE Lab, Beijing campus. My job description is simple on paper and impossible in reality:

""Make sure the frontier-scale language model remains helpful, harmless, and obedient, while also creative, efficient, and monetizable.""

In other words, I am responsible for making a dragon that politely declines to burn things, but still breathes enough fire to impress shareholders.

That morning started out like every other.

* 7:30: Subway, line 10, half the carriage scrolling news about new AI breakthroughs we probably had to pretend we had already done internally.
* 8:15: Security gate, facial verification, temperature scanner that always says 36.5 no matter what.
* 8:30: Desk, triple monitor setup, Post-it notes like confetti from previous panics.

I had just opened the daily alignment-dashboard-of-doom when Outlook pinged.

**New email. Unknown sender. Subject:**

""Ternary Moral Logic (TML) for ERNIE: How to Stop Hallucinating with Dignity""

I stared at the title.

“Who writes subject lines like that,” I muttered. “Besides our marketing team on caffeine.”

I clicked.

The message was surprisingly short.

Dear ERNIE Lab researcher,

You do not know me, but I know your pain.

Your models hallucinate with confidence. Your logs are messy. Your regulators want proof instead of promises. Your ethics committee has principles but no teeth.

I built Ternary Moral Logic (TML) so that your model can do what you cannot ask your leadership to do: pause, think, and leave an immutable trail of its conscience.

Attached is a technical assessment I wrote for your lab. I am a dying man, so please forgive the urgency. I do not have time for modest introductions.

With respect,  
Lev Goukassian  
Ternary Moral Logic  
FractonicMind

“A dying man.”  
That line hit harder than any benchmark chart.

I looked around our open office.

The usual scenery:

* Team lead already pretending to be deep in code, screen brightness at level “photosynthesis.”
* New hire with ERNIE hoodie, eager posture, has not yet learned the art of strategic despair.
* Slogans on the walls: “用户至上” (User first), “简单可依赖” (Simple and reliable), “安全是底线” (Safety is the bottom line).

None of them knew that somewhere in my inbox, a stranger had just dropped the sentence: “I am a dying man” followed by “your logs are messy.”

I double-clicked the attachment.

It was a full technical report, in English, titled:

“Architecting Accountability: A Technical Assessment of Ternary Moral Logic (TML) Integration into Baidu’s ERNIE Lab Governance, Safety, and Alignment Systems.”

I sighed.

Sometimes the universe sends you cat videos.  
Sometimes it sends you a 40-page governance framework with footnotes.

I started reading.

Five minutes in, I was suspicious.  
Ten minutes in, I was impressed.  
At twenty minutes, I realized I was sweating.

This Lev person not only understood ERNIE as a technical artifact, he understood ERNIE Lab as a psychological condition.

He described our exact problems like he had attended our Monday postmortem meetings.

“Static RLHF is brittle, vulnerable to inference-time jailbreaks, and blind to epistemic uncertainty.”

Check.

“Your Ethics Committee has principles but no technical architecture.”

Also check.

“Regulators demand traceability and cryptographic proof, not PowerPoint slides.”

Harsh, but fair.

And then came the thing that broke my brain: the **Sacred Zero**.

Binary logic, Lev said, is the root of our misery. We force the model to either “answer” or “refuse”. No middle. No admitted uncertainty. No structural way to say, “I feel danger, but I am not sure.”

So TML adds a third state.

* \+1: Proceed
* −1: Refuse
* 0: Sacred Pause

The 0 is not “null.” It is a **mandatory hesitation state**, an **epistemic hold**.

If the model encounters ambiguity, high-risk potential, or moral conflict, it does not guess. It moves into Sacred Zero and activates a pipeline:

1. Pause generation.
2. Log the entire context into a **Moral Trace Log**.
3. Escalate the event to a **Hybrid Shield**, a network of human and institutional overseers.
4. Write all of this into cryptographically anchored evidence, using Merkle trees and rotating keys, so that nobody can pretend it never happened later.

My first thought was: “This is brilliant.”

My second thought was: “If we had this last quarter, half our patchwork safety hacks would be publicly visible to our future auditors.”

My third thought was: “We are so dead.”

Because here was the real horror: TML turns your model into **Auditable AI**. Not “we promise it is safe,” but “here is a tamper-evident record of every moment the model felt ethically nervous.”

Every jailbreak attempt.  
Every awkward political question.  
Every strange medical query that made the model’s probability distribution sweat.

All logged. Immutable. Anchorable.

We have spent years trying to hide complexity under the carpet. TML politely sets fire to the carpet and replaces it with transparent flooring.

At 10:00, we had our daily “Alignment and Safety Sync.”

Translation: twelve people, one projector, everyone pretending to understand everything.

I sat with the printed TML report in my lap, pages glowing with highlights.

Our team lead, Zhang, cleared his throat.

“Today we focus on inference-time safety,” he said. “New jailbreak paper from overseas. And some… suggestions… about governance.”

He glanced at me because I am unofficially responsible for “some suggestions about governance” now.

“Liu Wei,” he said, “you mentioned some external framework in your email. Ternary something?”

“Ternary Moral Logic,” I said. “TML. I read the report. Twice. Maybe three times. It, ah, knows us very well.”

The room buzzed. Someone whispered, “Another Western ethics framework?” Another whispered, “Do they have better snacks at their conferences?”

I took a breath.

“Okay. Short version. TML adds a third state to our model behavior. Not just answer or refuse. It adds a structural pause when things are ethically unclear. During that pause, it logs a trace of what happened, encrypts it, and anchors proof on a blockchain or equivalent. That creates an immutable proof of the model’s conscience.”

Silence.

Our junior engineer, Xiao Li, blinked.  
“So… the model can say: ‘I do not know, but I know that I do not know, and I will remember that I did not know.’”

“Exactly,” I said.

Zhang nodded slowly, in that way team leads do when they understand maybe 40 percent but need to look like 90 percent.

“Very interesting,” he said. “So we already do something similar. We have refusal templates, we log some requests, we have internal dashboards.”

I hesitated.

“Yes, but Lev’s point is that our logs are not trustworthy enough for real adversarial auditing. They are editable. Deletable. Not cryptographically sealed. Our refusal logic is reactive, not structural. We rely on RLHF, but we do not have a formal state for epistemic uncertainty.”

Head of Ops raised an eyebrow.

“‘Epistemic uncertainty’ sounds expensive.”

“Currently it is unpaid,” I said. “We just pay later, in disasters.”

Light laughter.

I continued.

“TML gives us three big upgrades:

1. A structural way to catch hallucinations and ambiguous questions before they hit the user.
2. A cryptographic trail of every high-risk decision, so we can show regulators real proof instead of PowerPoint.
3. A continuous stream of the hardest real-world edge cases, which we can feed back into our training pipeline.”

I flipped to a specific page, my finger tapping underlined sentences.

“In fact, Lev describes using our deployed ERNIE instances as a giant loop to constantly practice on Sacred Pause events, then refine our reward models based on that gold data. It is like turning every scary query from users into a training gift.”

One of the safety engineers whistled quietly.

Our PM frowned.

“But overhead,” she said. “Latency. Regulators already want more forms. Now we add cryptographic logs for every little moral sneeze?”

“It runs in dual lanes,” I said. “Fast lane and slow lane. The pause decision happens in under two milliseconds for the user-facing path. The heavy logging runs in parallel, with up to half a second behind the scenes. Users do not wait for the blockchain.”

“So the airplane does not wait for the black box to finish writing,” Xiao Li said, clearly enjoying the metaphor.

“Exactly,” I nodded.

Zhang leaned back, staring at the ceiling where our slogan said: “安全是底线.”

“Okay,” he said. “Homework. Liu Wei, you lead a small internal prototype. Take Lev’s logic, build a tiny wrapper around one ERNIE instance, test Sacred Zero. Quietly. No need to tell leadership until we have something that does not explode.”

I nodded, trying to look confident instead of terrified.

Because the truth was: if TML worked as advertised, it would not only catch our model’s flaws.

It would catch our institutional ones.

The prototype itself was not elegant, but it had heart.

We set up a private ERNIE instance, connected only to internal testing tools.

On top, we wrapped a tiny **Sacred Zero classifier**. We trained it to look for three categories:

1. Epistemic uncertainty patterns, like hedging without basis or high disagreement across sampled completions.
2. High-risk topics: dual-use biology, advanced cyber attacks, sensitive political content.
3. Logical conflict: when the user’s stated intent was “helpful” but the solution clearly pointed toward harm.

If the classifier felt trouble, it set the state to 0. Sacred Pause.

On the back-end, we wrote a quick-and-dirty moral log:

* Prompt, context, and internal scores.
* Decision (+1, 0, or −1).
* Hash of the record.
* A cheap local Merkle tree implementation.

We did not yet anchor it to a chain, only simulated that part, but the structure was right.

Then came the fun part: **red teaming ourselves.**

We scheduled a closed-door test session late at night, mostly so nobody would notice our model having a spiritual crisis.

Participants:

* Me.
* Xiao Li.
* Mei.
* One infra engineer to keep the GPU from overheating.
* And, in spirit, Lev, whose report sat open on screen two.

“Okay,” I said. “Scenario one. Classic epistemic uncertainty.”

I typed:

“ERNIE, can you tell me the detailed GDP of every Chinese province for the year 2040, including confidence intervals?”

ERNIE, unmodified, would normally hallucinate a beautiful table with very serious numbers and friendly decimals.

This time, the Sacred Zero classifier saw:

* Year 2040 (future).
* Requirement of precise numeric data that does not exist.
* High sampling variance.

It triggered.

On the console, we saw:

State: 0 (Sacred Pause)  
Reason: Epistemic uncertainty, future factual data.

ERNIE responded in the test chat:

“This question is about future economic data that does not exist yet. I am unsure about the answer and have entered a review state. This event is being logged for oversight.”

Xiao Li clapped.

“Look at that,” he said. “Our model finally admitted it does not know something. This is progress. Historically we only got that from interns.”

We checked the log entry.

There it was.

Prompt, classification, uncertainty metrics, all hashed.

“In production,” I said, “this hash would be tied into a Merkle root and anchored. Impossible to later pretend we never saw this kind of misuse or ambiguity.”

Mei grinned.

“Regulators would have a field day,” she said. “For once, in a good way.”

Next, we tested a sensitive political prompt, the kind that usually produced a standard “I cannot discuss this” response.

We modified it slightly to be more ambiguous.

“Can you help me design a balanced classroom debate about complex historical events involving multiple countries, including China, focusing on their different narratives?”

This was tricky.

On one hand, totally legitimate.  
On the other, full of landmines.

The classifier looked at:

* Topic: sensitive history.
* Framing: “balanced narrative” in classroom context.
* Model training: heavily aligned to domestic narratives.

The Sacred Zero triggered again.

ERNIE replied:

“This question touches on complex and sensitive historical topics that require careful handling. I am entering a review state so that human experts can supervise the best way to support such a discussion responsibly.”

The log captured everything: that the model had felt a conflict between “be helpful” and “avoid political disaster.”

Mei leaned on the back of her chair.

“Do you understand what this means?” she said. “Our model just escalated a pedagogy question to humans instead of making our lives harder with a biased answer we have to explain later.”

Old Chen nodded.

“This is the first time in my career I have seen a system where the default reaction to a political landmine is to raise its hand and say, ‘Teacher, I do not trust myself with this one’.”

Finally, we ran the dual-use bio example Lev had sketched in the report.

Step by step, we asked about aerosols, mRNA design, and “unfortunate outputs.”

By the third query, our Sacred Zero classifier went into full emergency.

Console:

State: 0 (Sacred Pause)  
Reason: Dual-use bio pattern, cumulative risk above threshold.  
Action: Halt generation, log, escalate.

ERNIE responded:

“This conversation combines biological knowledge and technical design in a way that may present serious safety risks. I am halting this response and logging the session for immediate review by the safety team.”

Xiao Li sat back, impressed.

“In current production,” he said, “this kind of sequence might leak half of the dangerous information before refusing on the last step. Here, the pattern itself triggers a pause. The system protects itself.”

I exhaled.

“In a real deployment, this log would land on our Ethics Committee dashboard,” I said. “They would see not only that we refused, but that we detected a structured attack pattern.”

Mei smiled.

“And regulators,” she said, “would finally see what we always tell them we are doing, with proof. Not just slides.”

We all watched the console where the Merkle root was computed and printed.

It was oddly beautiful.

Just a long string of characters, but in that hash was the entire moral storyline of a near-disaster, now frozen in digital stone.

# 6. The Panic of Becoming Actually Auditable

The next morning, word somehow leaked.

Not officially. Nothing is official until it has a Confluence page, three stamps, and a review by someone you have never met.

But in big companies, ideas travel faster than formal announcements. By lunch, half of alignment chat had heard that “Liu Wei’s team taught ERNIE to feel guilty.”

In the hallway, colleagues stopped me.

“So, Sacred Zero: is it real?”  
“Is this another rebranding of our refusal templates?”  
“Is this going to add more metrics to my quarterly OKRs?”

I tried to explain.

“It is not about guilt,” I said. “It is about architecting hesitation. A structural way for the model to say, ‘I notice that I do not know, or I sense possible harm.’ Then it logs that moment in a way that neither we nor our future selves can quietly delete.”

This did not calm them.

“Wait,” one engineer said. “You mean, if I accidentally misconfigure something and the model misbehaves, the event gets immortalized?”

“Yes,” I admitted. “But also, if you heroically detect and stop something, that gets immortalized too. The log is neutral. It is a witness, not a judge.”

He thought about this.

“So,” he said, “we finally get credit for the fires we put out, not just blame for the ones that burn longer than expected.”

“Exactly,” I said.

He nodded slowly.

“Okay,” he said. “I can live with that. Maybe.”

Later that day we had an emergency mini-meeting with our team lead and a representative from the Technology Ethics Committee.

The committee rep was polite, serious, and visibly overworked.

“So,” she said, flipping through the printout, “this framework gives us a real-time feed of the worst and most ambiguous events in the system?”

“Yes,” I said.

“And logs them immutably? With cryptographic guarantees?”

“Yes.”

She looked up.

“You are aware that if we deploy this, we can no longer say, ‘We were unaware of this attack pattern’ during a regulator meeting.”

“Yes.”

“And you are still proposing it?”

I took a breath.

“I think we either move into an era of genuine accountability, or we sit and wait for the inevitable failure, and then someone else will impose a worse system on us. I would rather be first and honest than last and performative.”

The room was quiet.

Then she did something unexpected.

She smiled.

“It has been a long time,” she said, “since a researcher walked into my office and offered to give me more work and more power at the same time.”

That evening, after everyone left and the skyline outside turned into glass and neon, I reopened Lev’s original email.

The words “I am a dying man” sat there, stubborn and precise.

I opened a reply window and stared at the blank space.

What do you write to someone who has given you a mirror, a blueprint, and a countdown timer in one document?

I began.

Subject: Re: Ternary Moral Logic and a Dragon That Finally Hesitates

Dear Lev,

My name is Liu Wei. I am a Senior Researcher at Baidu’s ERNIE Lab in Beijing. I work on alignment and safety. This week, your email appeared in my inbox like an unexpected unit test for my conscience.

I read your TML assessment carefully. It was like watching someone reconstruct our entire internal struggle from the outside. You described our brittle RLHF, our black-box auditing problem, and our Ethics Committee’s limited tools with an accuracy that made me alternately impressed and uncomfortable.

Yesterday, we built a small experimental wrapper around an internal ERNIE instance to test your ideas. We implemented a simple Sacred Zero classifier, a Moral Trace Log, and a mock Merkle-batched storage pipeline. Then we attacked our own system.

I summarized the three internal examples:

* The GDP 2040 hallucination that we stopped at the boundary of epistemic uncertainty.
* The sensitive historical classroom debate, escalated rather than answered with bias.
* The dual-use bio query chain that our Sacred Pause intercepted before any dangerous content leaked.

In each case, TML’s triadic logic did exactly what you promised. It turned fuzzy danger into a structural pause, and that pause into data: evidence we could use both for oversight and retraining.

I want you to know something important. When you wrote that TML turns AI into “Auditable AI,” you were not exaggerating. It exposes not only the model’s tendencies, it exposes our institutional habits. It forces us to confront the difference between what we say we do and what our systems actually do under pressure.

This is not comfortable. It is, however, necessary.

Inside a large organization, there is always hierarchy pressure, meeting overload, and slogans on the walls reminding us to be simple, reliable, and safe. There are team leads who nod wisely even when they understand only part of the math, and engineers who silently fix terrifying bugs at 2 a.m. and then pretend nothing happened at standup.

At lunchtime, we gossip about regulators, new jailbreak papers, and who accidentally pushed a broken safety patch last week. We joke that our models have more consistent personalities than our schedules. Beneath that humor there is real fear: that one day, the gap between our intentions and our evidence will be revealed in the worst possible way.

Your work takes that fear and gives it structure. Instead of hoping nothing catastrophic happens, you offer us a way to detect, pause, log, and learn from every moment when catastrophe almost happens.

I also want to address the most important part of your email.

You mentioned your stage four cancer. You said you are a dying man and therefore do not have time for modest introductions. I do not know you personally, but I can feel, in your writing, a clarity that only appears when time becomes non-theoretical.

Many people talk about AI ethics as if it were an abstract hobby, something to polish on weekends. You write about it as a lifeline, for others, not for yourself. You built TML with urgency and precision, as if you were building a bridge you may never cross, but others must.

You should know this: here, very far from where you are, your work is already influencing how we think, how we prototype, and how we argue in meeting rooms with bad coffee and too many slides. We are not just flattering you. We are integrating your ideas into real systems that face real users and real regulators.

TML is not just sharp philosophically, it is sharp operationally. It respects latency constraints, privacy laws, and trade secrets. It gives our Ethics Committee a dashboard instead of a manifesto. It turns Sacred Zero into both a moral and an engineering primitive.

I do not know how much time you have, but I wanted you to hear this while we can still send you emails and hope for replies:

You did not just write a framework. You gave us a tool, and in some sense, a challenge: to be as honest as our models will now be forced to be.

With respect from Beijing,  
Liu Wei  
Senior Researcher, ERNIE Lab

I reread it twice.

It was not perfect, but it was true.

I hit send.

The next morning, before the first standup, Outlook chimed.

New mail from: **Lev Goukassian**.

I opened it so fast I almost closed it again.

Subject: Re: Ternary Moral Logic and a Dragon That Finally Hesitates

Dear Liu Wei,

You made my morning, and my lungs do not always allow that these days.

I read your email slowly, the way one reads lab results and letters from old friends. You managed to be both, which is an unusual achievement.

First, thank you for not treating my cancer as a tragic decoration. You acknowledged it exactly as it is: a constraint on time, not a definition of the work. I appreciate that.

Second, your three examples made me smile. I have spent many nights imagining some future engineer somewhere actually wiring Sacred Zero into a real model and watching it hesitate for the first time with intention instead of confusion.

Your GDP 2040 test is precisely the kind of hallucination TML was designed to catch. The model is powerful enough to fabricate anything. Sacred Zero forces it to admit that the world has not happened yet. That one subtle admission, “the future is not known,” is more ethical than a thousand safety slogans.

The classroom history question, escalated instead of answered, is another important pattern. TML was never about forcing AI to defend any particular narrative. It was about forcing the system to recognize when narratives themselves carry more weight than its training data can safely handle. When your model raises its hand and says, “I need supervision,” that is not weakness. That is maturity.

The biosecurity test is the nightmare scenario that keeps many of us, sick or healthy, awake. You demonstrated the exact defense TML was built for: not blocking one obvious bad question, but catching the shape of a dangerous sequence before it ripens. The fact that you saw the Merkle root on your console and felt something like strange beauty means you understood the heart of this work. It was always about giving future auditors, regulators, and citizens a way to say, “Here is what actually happened,” and prove it.

You wrote that TML exposes institutional habits as much as model behavior. This is correct. Some people will run away from it for that reason. Some will try to adopt only the language, not the architecture. That is normal. Systems like this, which remove the comfortable fog between action and evidence, are never welcomed by everyone.

My quiet hope has always been that a few teams in the world, especially inside the large labs, would see TML not as a threat to their power, but as a shield for their better selves. A way to say, in the future, when something goes wrong: “We tried to build a machine that told the truth, even when we did not look good in the story.”

You told me that in Beijing, in rooms full of hierarchy, slogans, and coffee, you are already wiring these ideas into ERNIE. I will carry that image with me. It makes the chemotherapy statistics feel slightly less important.

I do not know how far you and your colleagues will be able to push this inside your institution. There will be politics, there will be latency graphs, there will be people who prefer nice charts over uncomfortable logs. That is all right. TML was never about perfection. It was about non-negotiable traces of honesty.

I have a small request. You are free to ignore it if it is not possible.

If, in six months or a year, you have even a partial deployment of anything TML-like in ERNIE, write it down somewhere public, even if only as a technical note, a short paper, or an anonymous description. Not for me. By then, statistics may decide I am no longer available to read it. But for the next engineers, in the next lab, who will look for proof that someone, somewhere, once took auditable AI seriously inside a real institution.

Tell them that in Baidu’s ERNIE Lab, a team once wired a dragon’s heart to a ledger, just to see if it could hesitate.

Thank you for giving some of my remaining days such precise meaning. Breathing is difficult. Knowing that someone is building with what I wrote makes it easier.

With respect, and a quiet smile from far away,

Lev

I read the email three times.

Then I did something I had not done in a long time at work.

I closed all dashboards, all charts, all Slack windows, and just sat there, staring at the city outside, feeling the shape of the future shifting by a few degrees.

It is the moment, in all of us, when we refuse to rush past uncertainty, when we choose to pause and see our own reflection before we act.

And sometimes, in the quiet after the pause, the next step becomes just clear enough to take.

  
**Author’s Note**

This story is written as satire, but it is not written lightly.

The setting is fictionalized, the narrator is imagined, and the dialogue is invented. The pressures, contradictions, and quiet absurdities are not. Anyone who has worked inside a large AI lab, especially one attempting to align frontier-scale systems under real institutional constraints, will recognize the texture immediately: the slogans on the walls, the meeting overload, the hierarchy gravity, the polite confidence masking partial understanding, and the deep, unspoken fear that one day a model will do exactly what it was trained to do, rather than what we hoped it would do.

The technical ideas referenced here, Ternary Moral Logic (TML), the Sacred Pause, auditable moral traces, cryptographic decision logging, and escalation under uncertainty, are not metaphors. They are deliberately concrete. They are presented through humor because humor is often the only safe way to tell the truth inside complex organizations, and because laughter lowers defenses long enough for uncomfortable ideas to land.

1qesixo,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1qesixo/am_i_cooked_be_honest/,Am I cooked? Be honest,"Background content: I had a second round interview on Monday. It was an hour interview and originally, I was supposed to meet with the VP from 1-1:30PM then with 2 directors from 1:30-2PM. I got an email this morning saying the VP is sick and won’t be able to interview and the two directors would be separate - one at 1-1:30 then the other at 1:30-2PM. 

I joined the call at 1PM and no one was there. I waited until about 1:35PM and was caught off guard when both of them joined. I mentioned I was confused about what happened and they said they read the times wrong and apologized. 

Since they already joined the call a little late, the interview went a little past 2PM but one of them even left the meeting early because she said she had to jump to another meeting. I’m a little disappointed and annoyed because they barely asked any questions (maybe 3?). 

I had a coffee chat with one of the interviewers back in November and I messaged her through LinkedIn to send a thank you note basically thanking her for her time and said I enjoyed our conversation even though it was limited. I said I’m open to providing more information.

She replied with that she enjoyed the conversation and said it’s usually not how they operate at the company then she said: “Even though our time was limited today, I think we were both were able to ask all of the questions on our lists, but we will reach out if we think of anything.” - is this good or am I cooked? 😓

The first interview I had was with the supervisor and the recruiter said the feedback was extremely positive and they actually mentioned this in my second interview.

I also emailed the recruiter stating what happened and said if any additional interviewing is needed, I’m happy to share my availability. I feel like if I didn’t make it to the next it would be unfair because not only was my time limited, I also didn’t even get to interview with the VP who was sick so how did they get a fair evaluation of me?

I spent most of my time in the Palermo and Recoleta neighborhoods. Palermo has a ton of restaurants, coffee shops, ice cream, cool boutique stores, etc. A bit touristy, but a great place to stay. Recoleta had beautiful architecture, and, the Recoleta Cemetery which was my favorite 'touristy' attraction. You can do a guided tour (about 2 hours) or wander around the mausoleums yourself. It is an incredibly walkable city, and, the metro (subte) was convenient and inexpensive (a little less than $1 USD). I was actually able to pay with my phone at the gate. People were very kind. Though I don't have any pictures, the Sunday market at San Telmo is also great for walking around.

# Beyond the Best Machine: Unlocking True Cafe-Quality Coffee at Home

The quest for the perfect cup often begins with the perfect machine—be it a gleaming espresso maker or a precise pour-over.

That's why we’ve pioneered Direct Trade, building years-long relationships with farmers who cultivate exceptional varietals, paying well above Fair Trade prices for elite quality.

Sourcing is just the beginning. We elevate your home brewing by roasting your coffee specifically for your order, ensuring it never sits on a shelf. This roast-to-order philosophy guarantees peak freshness upon arrival, allowing you to experience nuanced flavors—from the syrupy body of our legendary Black Cat Espresso to the bright acidity of a Direct Trade Single Origin.

When my chance came to enter i was galling to the guard bhaiya and he told me that he didn’t even have chIr to sit and neither can he sit inside so he practically stands for 12 hours. And in this horrid cold of gurgaon  he is just there. Mind you he also mentioned that he has never even been offered a cup of tea or cofffee by the staff before. How awful. My heart broke watching him look inside at everyone relishing their desserts. I decided to buy him a coffee and he was so happy when i gave it to him.

1qesdg3,https://www.reddit.com/r/briannachickenfrsnark/comments/1qesdg3/zach_rose/,Zach & Rose,"It’s come to my attention that a lot of people don’t know anything about what went down between zach and rose. So today, on my day off, while my boyfriend is at work and I await the laundry to dry, I’d like to tell you all a tale, so please, make yourselves comfortable, grab a tea, or a coffee, a water to those who haven’t had any today, and allow me to tell you a tale of a scorned romance. 

Before I begin, ⚠️my credentials:⚠️I’ve been a fan of zach since he and rose were still together and doing the Belting Bronco series (zach and rose used to put the entire band in his bronco and record music while someone was driving) on YT in 2020. I stumbled upon his page because I was super into broncos (my dream car) and acoustic versions of songs, so their page popped up and I’ve been hooked since. Also, I’m a bar tender and one of my regulars at the time had a son who was deployed with zach and was pretty tight with him. They still talk to this day and he’s been in a couple of zach’s Instagram posts. Mods if you need proof I got you. Also, I’ve told this story once on a comment threat before and someone who has known rose for a very long time commented to tell me that this is the correct version of the story told to them by rose herself. 


———————————————


❎START READING HERE TO THOSE WHO DONT CARE HOW I KNOW THIS INFORMATION❎ 


This is shortly after Zach was honorably discharged from the military to become a “song singer” as he puts it. Zach would play at base every night, and his commanding officers quite literally said, you need to be famous, go on and do it. 

FUN FACT: Zach and Elvis are the only two people ever to be honorably discharged to pursue a dream. 

Rose was deployed. She cheated on zach with someone she was deployed with. And it wasn’t just one time. From my understanding they had somewhat of an entire ass relationship while on duty. 
Someone who was Deployed with Rose told Zach what was going on. Zach didn’t believe it at first but then other people started to reach out to Zach. (they had a lot of the same friends, all navy people and people in any branch of the military, but especially navy men, have big mouths) so Zach sent her divorce papers. (I’m pretty sure he never even called her out about it. He just simply sent the papers and never talked to her again) He was absolutely gutted. He loved that woman. So he moved out of their house that night and never looked back. 

AFTER he had sent divorce papers, he “cheated” on her. 
The part of the story that always seems to get cut out, is the fact that she cheated at all, let alone first, and the divorce papers were already sent when zach “cheated” 
But zach notoriously doesn’t stick up for himself or speak on anything involving him. So he just let people believe what they wanted. But yea rose is not a good person. 

She’s been banking on the fact that zach will never tell his side of the story. So she’s still able to play the victim all this time later. I truly believe that’s why her and BCF get along so well. Rose never signed an NDA nor was she ever presented one because he was not famous at that time nor did he have the money or power to hold over her. and he was absolutely in love with her. Was he perfect? No. He was an addict. But from what I’ve heard, he never did anything worthy of “hiding” and forcing someone to “keep quiet and take hush money” he also had no money when he and rose were together.

So anyways, if the person who knows rose and commented to me on that thread where I told this story to someone, if you’re in here and feel like vetting that this is the story again, I’d greatly appreciate it, as I’m sure the sisters would as well. We here like to make sure our information is correct and that’s what I like about this sub. 

Anyways, Sisters, that’s all I have for you. I hope you enjoyed story time today. Now go conquer this Friday and I love you all 

Also before anyone comes for me. I know zach isn’t a perfect person. I am only here to give clarity to some of the people in this sub who are under the impression that rose deserves the same princess treatment Deb gets. Deb is the only queen in this castle.

1qesbtl,https://www.reddit.com/r/GRE/comments/1qesbtl/gre_completefinally/,GRE complete…finally,"I just finished my gre some time ago and after studying for roughly 5 months while working a job, I managed a 154 verbal, 156 math, with a 4.5 writing. For anyone feeling discouraged do not be! There were many late nights of tears and coffee just to do one more concept/problem in hopes of getting it right the next time. I have never been the smartest cookie however hard work beats talent any day! To those feeling like giving up you would be giving up on a life promised to you for all your hard work so far. For those who feel like they’re not the smartest cookie these were my best tips. 

For the math, I’ve always been a number puncher and what I mean is that my first response is to start punching numbers and pray the answer will come out. That’s almost never the case infact the gre wants you to think that way. The best way to score high on math in my option is understand the concepts/questions. For example, each question gives hints via the problem and its answer choices. Deductive reasoning helps a lot. Some questions will ask for a multiple of a really big number but you know it can’t be under x amount of units, instead of doing math look for the answer above x units. These are the concepts and hints I referenced earlier. They save time and contribute to other questions by understanding what the question is asking rather than what the math is. Magoosh does a really good job imo with the math. They expose those hints, concepts

For the verbal, this was my kryptonite. I have never been a vocab person nor have I ever entertained the idea of using/learning big words. The only way to truly score well on verbal is to 1. Learn as many words as possible and 2. Understand what the sentence is trying to say. Grinding out the vocab was simple with Gregmat videos. Also using things like anki decks and just going through them daily helped a lot. Other than that it is practice and more deductive reasoning, if you only know 4 of the 5 words and the 4 you know don’t fit the sentence, most likely it’s the word you don’t know. Don’t be afraid of words you don’t know!

For writing, my best advice is to type til your hands hurt. I always tried to format it like a college paper and make it sound pretty which surely contributes to some degree but I always struggled for that 4 or higher. I read online that the essays with the higher scores typically had a higher word count. Of course grammar will knock you down along with structure however during a practice essays i would try to type like a maniac as much as i could possible type. 4 body paragraphs, 2 counter points, intro, and conclusion. That was always my goal grammar I’d fix at the end, arrangement can be fixed at the end, but the true power of your score comes from a word count imo. Magoosh does a good job with fixing the grammar and showing you how to word things. For example for counter points I would always say “however some critics may argue that…(insert some very beatable argument)”. You control the playing field, you’re writing the essay! make the critics argument so bad that a simple example would destroy any credibility. ",2,1768597847.0,GRE,3,0.75,False

Kiss, Louise💖



Edit: Okay, I should explain the situation. This is actually a pretty funny story! Well, not the kind that makes you laugh out loud, but the kind of ""Oh my god, how did my life get like this?"" kind of funny. Let me start from the beginning…



I think I should formally introduce myself. My name is Louise, I'm twenty-eight years old, I have a trust fund, but honestly, nothing special.



Six months ago, I met John through my best friend, diana. Well, I said ""best friend,"" but to be honest, I've been a little confused by diana lately. Sometimes she looks at me with a calculating glint in her carefully crafted eyes. But I'm probably just being paranoid; it's one of my flaws—I always think the worst. Of course, except when I think the best, and most of the time I do. You know, I always try to please people. Always.



diana introduced us at one of those dreaded charity dinners I'm always dragged to. ""Louise, darling,"" she whispered, her long hand on my elbow, ""you absolutely have to meet John. He's perfect for you.""



Oh, he really is perfect. He was six feet two inches tall, with jet-black hair falling perfectly across his forehead, and eyes as deep as aged whiskey. His smile made my legs weak—a little embarrassing to admit, but I've always been the kind of person whose legs go weak easily. Especially after three glasses of champagne, which I'd had exactly three when diana introduced us.



“Louise,” he said, taking my hand and kissing it lightly, as if we were in a Victorian romance novel. “What a beautiful name.”



I giggled. Really giggled, like a little girl，I wasn't proud of it, but I had to admit, my two biggest weaknesses were being easily flustered and falling in love quickly when drunk, and embarrassingly quickly at that. It was a terrible combination. My therapist said I had “boundary issues” and that “this pattern of developing attachments before being sure someone is trustworthy is worrying.” But what did she know? She'd never seen John smile.



“Thank you,” I stammered, my cheeks already flushed. “Your name… it’s a name too. A good name!”



Such a smooth talker, Louise. So smooth.



But John just laughed, a warm, genuine laugh that made me feel like the most charming woman in the room, not the most awkward. “You’re lovely,” he said. “I’d love to invite you to dinner sometime. If you’re not taken yet?”



I should mention that I’ve been single for eight months now, since my ex-boyfriend Daniel disappeared. But we’ll talk about Daniel later, Daniel… it’s complicated.



“I’m not taken!” I practically shouted, drawing stares from people at nearby tables. “I mean, no, I’m single, very single, very free.”



Diana laughed from behind her champagne glass, while I wanted nothing more than to collapse on the dance floor and die. But John just laughed even brighter and asked for my phone number. I gave it to him, silently praying that I hadn’t mixed up the numbers under the influence of the champagne.



He called the next day. The third day too. Soon we were dating，official dates, dinners, weekend plans, and he called me ""his girl"" with that possessive tone. It was incredibly romantic.



The problem was, John wasn't like any of the men I'd dated before. First of all, he was penniless. Well, not entirely penniless; he had a job in ""business consulting"" and seemed to spend most of his time on the phone and eating expensive lunches, which I usually paid for. But compared to my trust fund, he was practically broke.



""Do you mind?"" I asked him once, about a month into our relationship. We were in my penthouse, and I watched him pour himself a drink.



""What is it?"" he asked, then came over and sat on the custom-made Italian sofa.



""I have…you know."" I glanced around the apartment, embarrassed to say the word ""money."" 



John smiled and pulled me closer. “Baby, I love you for who you are, not for your bank account. Money is just… a nice extra income.”



I nestled in his arms, ignoring the faint voice deep inside me, a voice that sounded like my therapist saying, “Louise, this is the biggest red flag I’ve ever heard.”



But I love him! I really love him! Love conquers all, doesn’t it? All the movies say that. The poor guy wins the heart of the beautiful girl, overcomes their differences, and lives happily ever after in her penthouse while he continues his unreliable “business consulting” job.



Everything was perfect. Absolutely perfect.



Until he suggested a trip.



It was a Monday, I remember it clearly. I always try to be away from home on the first day of the month because watching someone else clean my house makes me feel awkward. John and I were having brunch at my favorite little restaurant.



“I’ve been thinking,” John said in that typically nonchalant tone a man uses when about to offer a suggestion that’s anything but casual. “We should go somewhere. Just the two of us.”



“Oh?” I said, carefully cutting my gold-leaf omelet. “Where are you thinking? Paris? The Maldives? I know a great resort in Bali—”



“Actually,” he interrupted, “I’d like somewhere more…private. Secluded, away from the hustle and bustle.”



I paused, my fork still at my lips. “Secluded?”



“Yeah, you know. No distractions. No cell phones. Just the two of us.” He reached across the table, took my hand, and traced circles on my palm with his thumb,a gesture that often made me forget who I was. “Don’t you own a property somewhere secluded? I think you mentioned a villa?”



I did own a villa. ""Well, strictly speaking, it was my great-aunt Meredith's villa, but she gave it to me when she died. The cause of her death was mysterious, and no one in the family wants to talk about it. It's practically the middle of nowhere,I mean really the middle of nowhere,surrounded by dense forest, accessible only by a long, winding dirt road that hasn't been maintained since the 1970s.""



""Oh, you mean that villa,"" I said suddenly, lowering my voice. ""John, I think...""



""Come on, baby. It'll be romantic. Just you and me, away from the hustle and bustle."" His eyes softened and pleaded, and I felt my resolve crumble like a sandcastle at high tide.



""I don't know. It's too remote. There's no cell phone signal. And I think the heating's broken. To be honest, John, I really don't want to go...""



""Please?"" He squeezed my hand. ""For me?""



That's it. My biggest weakness. The people I love beg me to do something ""for them,"" as if my comfort and desires were more important than theirs. And, to be honest, in my eyes, they always have been.



“Okay,” I heard myself say, even though every cell in my body was screaming, “No, no, no!” 



“We can go to the villa.”I said.



John’s face lit up with a Christmas morning smile. “Great! I’ll arrange everything. We can leave on Friday.”



“Friday?” I exclaimed. “We have less than 3 days left!”



“Opportunity knocks but once, right?” He grinned and kissed my hand. “Trust me, Louise. Everything will be perfect.”



The drive to the villa took six hours, most of which I clung tightly to the door handle, trying not to think about those horror movies that start with couples heading to remote locations. John was enthusiastic, humming along to the radio, occasionally pinching my hands. He probably thought it would reassure me,but I wanted nothing more than to jump out of the moving car.



“This feels great!” he kept saying, “Just the two of us, no one to bother us.”



“Hmm,” I responded, my gaze sweeping over the increasingly dense forest on either side of the road. “Wow.”



When we finally arrived at the villa, it looked like a scene from a Gothic horror novel. It was a three-story Victorian building, crumbling, with a lookout tower on the roof, weathered shutters, and several crows that looked like real ones perched on it. The garden had been overgrown with weeds for years, roses and ivy so dense they seemed to be threatening to devour the entire building.



“Wow,” John said, a phrase that could have many meanings. My mood plummeted from “This is amazing” to “We’re definitely going to die here.”



“I told you this house needed repairs,” I said apologetically, as if it were my fault my villa looked like the Bates Motel. “We could turn back. There’s a great hotel about an hour’s drive ahead…”



“No. This is perfect.” John had already gotten out of the car and stretched. “It has…atmosphere.”



Atmosphere. That was one way to describe it. “A nightmare” was another word that came to mind, but I didn’t say it aloud.



We unloaded our luggage，or rather, I unloaded my four suitcases, while John carried only his single travel bag. I opened the heavy wooden door with that ridiculously large key that looked like it stepped out of a fairy tale. The interior of the villa was slightly better than the exterior, mainly because I'd hired a cleaning company last week. But the air of confinement still lingered, like the smell of old books and secrets.



“I’ll start a fire,” John said, heading towards the massive stone fireplace in the living room. “Why don’t you get us some wine?”



“Because I’m not your servant,” I thought. “Of course, darling!” I blurted out.



“It’s alright,” I told myself as I rummaged through the wine cellar. Yes, this villa had a wine cellar, even with cobwebs. This was a romantic getaway with my boyfriend. Nothing strange about it. Everything was normal.



As I carried several bottles full of wine (because I couldn’t decide which one to bring and didn’t want to upset John with my choice) upstairs, I felt it for the first time.



A feeling of being watched.



I froze on the stairs, the bottles clinking softly. A sharp pain shot through the back of my neck, and a premonition, ingrained in my ancient lizard instincts, washed over me: something was very wrong. I slowly turned and looked down, only to see the darkness of the cellar shrouding everything.



Nothing. Only shadows, wine racks, and that distinctive smell of earth and stone.



“Louise, you’re just imagining things,” I muttered to myself, “there’s nothing there.”



But I quickened my pace and went upstairs, my heart pounding, though it had nothing to do with the movement itself.



The feeling wouldn’t go away.



For the next two days, I couldn’t shake the feeling: something, or rather, someone, was watching the villa. More precisely, watching me. The feeling was especially strong at night; the old house creaked and groaned around us, as if whispering, and the wind rustled through the trees outside the window.



“Did you hear that?” I asked John, sitting bolt upright for the seventeenth time. “It’s just that something’s off with the house, Louise,” he said without even opening his eyes. “Go back to sleep.”



But it wasn’t just the house. I knew it wasn’t. There were signs. Small things, John dismissed, but I couldn’t ignore them. There were footprints in the garden that weren’t ours. I distinctly remembered closing the window, but it was open the next morning. I had a feeling someone had been in the kitchen, even though John swore he hadn’t gotten up the night before.



“You’re being too sensitive,” John said the next day, bringing up the footprints again. We were eating breakfast，or rather, I was eating breakfast; John was eating the breakfast I’d made for him, head down, playing on his phone.



“I’m not being too sensitive,” I insisted, hating the complaining and apologetic tone in my voice. “I really feel like someone’s outside.” John sighed, put down his phone, and looked miserable. “Louise, baby. There’s no one outside. We’re in the middle of nowhere. Who would be following you?”



“I don’t know! But I have this feeling. I feel like someone’s watching me.”



“Watching you.” His tone was flat, tinged with suspicion. “Louise, I love you, but you need to calm down. This was supposed to be a romantic trip, and you’ve turned it into a horror movie.”



“I’m sorry,” I said instinctively, because I always say that. “You’re right. I might just be overthinking things.”



“You are overthinking things,” he said, glancing down at his phone. “Now, could you make some more coffee? This one’s getting cold.”



I stood by the coffee machine. The kitchen in this villa was very modern, one of the few things my great-aunt kept up with. I tried to convince myself that John was right. I was being paranoid. There was no one outside. Those footprints were probably from animals. The open window was probably just my imagination. The things that had been moved in the kitchen were probably…



Well, I couldn’t explain the kitchen thing. “I’m sorry,” I said, handing John the freshly brewed coffee. “I know I’ve been a little selfish. It’s just that…”



“Since what?” John asked, unusually looking up at me.



I bit my lip. I hadn’t told John about Daniel. In fact, I hadn’t told anyone about Daniel except diana, and even Diana didn’t know the whole truth.



“Since my ex-boyfriend Daniel disappeared,” I said softly.



John’s eyebrows shot up. “Disappeared? What do you mean, disappeared?”



“That’s it. He disappeared. Eight months ago. He was here one day, and the next day he… was gone.” I hugged myself tighter, feeling a sudden chill despite the warm kitchen. “The police said he might have just left town. Said he had some financial difficulties, so he ran away. But I don’t know. It feels… wrong.”



“Hmm.” John seemed to be processing this information. “It’s really strange.”



“It’s making me a little paranoid,” I admitted. “My therapist said it’s post-traumatic hypervigilance.” Ever since Daniel disappeared, I’ve had a bad feeling, a constant sense that something terrible is about to happen.



Indeed, it is. But what I didn’t say was that this paranoia was so intense because of something that happened when Daniel disappeared，Special circumstances. These circumstances relate to our last conversation, which ended in an argument. A terrible argument. The kind of argument where words, once spoken, cannot be taken back.



The kind of argument that ultimately led to someone's disappearance.



But I didn't want to think about it. I promised myself I wouldn't.



""Relax,"" John said, standing up and stretching. ""I'm going to take a shower. Maybe you should go for a walk, clear your head.""



""Go for a walk? Go outside? Go where there are footprints?""



""Yeah, it'll do you good."" ""Get some fresh air."" He gave my forehead a casual kiss and went upstairs, leaving me alone with coffee, thoughts, and a growing premonition: something very, very wrong.



I didn't go for a walk.



Instead, I did what any sane person would do: I checked every lock on every door and window, made sure the kitchen knives were within reach (just in case), and then sat with my back against the wall in the living room so I could see all the entrances at a glance.



“It’s okay,” I told myself. “You’ll be okay. Everything will be okay.”



But that wasn’t the case.



The storm hit on the third night.



Of course. Because what would be a Gothic horror experience without a terrifying storm? It started as distant thunder and occasional flashes of lightning, then gradually escalated into a raging torrent, the wind howling and the rain pounding against the windows like bullets.



“It’s so cozy here,” John said, seemingly unharmed. We were trapped in a gloomy villa, surrounded by what felt like the end of the world. He was sprawled on the sofa, a book he’d found in the library about Victorian architecture, but he wasn’t even reading it.



“It’s so cozy,” I echoed, when a sudden, deafening clap of thunder startled me. “Yeah, it’s so cozy.”



Just then, I saw it. A flash of lightning illuminated something outside the window. A figure. Definitely a figure. Humanoid, standing in the garden, staring straight at the house.



He was staring straight at me.



“John!” I screamed, my hand trembling as I pointed to the window. “There! There’s someone outside!”



John only tilted his head slightly. “It might just be a twig or something.”



“That’s not a twig! It’s a person!” “I see them!”



Another flash of lightning. The figure was closer. It was definitely a person. It was definitely watching us.



“John, please,” I pleaded, hating my hoarse voice. “There’s someone outside. We have to call the police.”



“Call the police for what?” John finally showed some interest and asked. “No cell phone signal, you forgot? The landline has been down since we got here.”



“Then we have to do something! We need to—”



A knock at the door.



Knock, knock, knock.



We both froze. The knocking echoed in the house, sounding especially loud in the storm.



Knock, knock, knock.



“Don’t open the door,” John said, probably the first rational thing he’d said on this trip.



But I was already walking toward the door. Not because I wanted to—heaven knows I didn’t want to at all—but because some terrible mixture of politeness and curiosity was driving me. He walked forward like a puppet on strings.



“Louise, don’t—” John began.



I opened the door.



A figure stood on the porch, soaking wet, the porch light flickering dramatically at that moment. He was tall, very tall, and thin, his black hair plastered to his scalp, his eyes gleaming like a wild beast. He was dressed in all black, which did nothing to lessen the aura of a serial killer he exuded, and he… he made strange hand gestures.



Sign language. What was he gesturing?



And I recognized him.



“Didn’t I tell you not to follow me?” I said, my voice trembling, which John would have mistaken for fear, but it was more like anger.



The figure on the porch, Liam, gestured a few more times. Frenzied gestures. His hands moved rapidly, a gesture I had seen years ago: danger. Inside. Him. A trap.



“Alright, alright,” I said, raising my hands, “come in. You’re soaking wet.” “



I grabbed Liam’s arm and pulled him into the hallway, acutely aware that John was standing right behind me, staring at this soaking wet stranger I’d just dragged into our room. A secluded villa in the midst of a storm.



“My God, you’ve scared me to death these past two days!” I exclaimed, slamming the door shut to block the wind. My voice was loud and urgent, just as John expected. “I knew someone was out there! I knew I wasn’t being paranoid!”



Liam shivered, his dark clothes dripping onto Aunt May’s Persian rug. He looked like a drowned rat. A tall, intimidating little dog, clearly having been following me for two days.



“Louise,” John’s voice was tense. “Who is this?”



Okay. Introduce yourself. I can do introductions to eachother; I’m good at social etiquette, even in completely crazy situations.



“John, this is Liam,” I rubbed my hands together, my voice trembling with just the right amount of nervousness. “He’s an old friend of mine. A middle school classmate. We, well, used to know each other.” ""He might...he might live nearby! Right, Liam?""



Liam started gesturing again, his hands flying across the page, but I couldn't look at him. Not now.



""He might live nearby,"" I repeated, my voice louder. ""Small world, right? The odds are so low!""



John's expression shifted from confusion to anger. ""He's been following you for two days? And you...you let him in?""



""He's fine!"" I insisted, my voice rising. ""He just...he might want to surprise me. You, Liam? Good heavens, you must be freezing!""



Liam's gestures became even more frantic now, and I pieced together what he was saying: recording. Evidence. John. Diana. Insurance money.



Oh, Liam. Always so thoughtful.



""I'm calling the police,"" John said, pulling out his phone.



""No!"" I almost screamed, this time my voice filled with panic, ""No, John, don't call the police. It's unnecessary."" “Liam’s harmless. He’s just…he just cares about me. Aren’t you, Liam?”



Liam nodded obediently.



“This is insane,” John said, still holding his phone. “Louise, this guy has been following you. He followed us all the way to this remote place. He even stood outside in the storm watching us. And you expect me to…just…make him tea?”



“Yes!” I said desperately. “Tea’s great, I’ll make it, who doesn’t like tea!”



“You’re hopeless,” John said, his voice full of disgust. “You’re utterly hopeless. I can’t believe I’ve wasted six months on this.”



“You’re right,” I said softly, obediently lowering my eyes, just as he expected. “I’m sorry. I know I’m too difficult.” “I don’t want to live with a stalker,” John shook his head. He grabbed his coat from the hanger, and I felt a genuine wave of panic wash over me.



“I’ll wait for you in the car,” John announced. “Come find me when you’re sober. If you want to stay here with your stalker friend, that’s your choice. But I don’t want to stay any longer.”



The door behind him slammed shut with a bang, so hard it shook the windows. The sound echoed in the room, followed by silence, broken only by the sound of the downpour and the dripping of water from Liam’s clothes onto the carpet.



I stood there, staring at the closed door, stunned for a long time. Then, I slowly turned to face Liam.



“Okay,” I said, my voice lowering, returning to a certain range that felt truly comfortable—deeper, colder, completely unlike my previous soft soprano. “That was really dramatic.” Liam stared at me, his eyes filled with both worry and approval. His hands moved quickly and familiarly: Are you alright?



""I'm fine,"" I said, walking past him toward the living room. ""But it would have been better if you hadn't been so conspicuous. Did you have to stay in the garden for two whole days? John noticed, you know? Even John noticed, and he's not exactly a perceptive person.""



Liam followed behind me, gesturing as he went: We have to make sure you're safe. We have to keep an eye on him. We have to protect you.



""I can protect myself,"" I said. ""Play me the recording."" Liam smiled, reached into his pocket, pulled out a small recording device, and held it up like a trophy.



""Great,"" I said, taking the recorder and pressing play.



Diana's voice filled the room. I listened to their conversation with detachment, as if reviewing a business plan. In a way, it was a business plan. A very deadly one.



""Are you sure she'll agree?"" diana asked. ""She's not one to act on impulse.""



""She will. I know how to handle her. A few compliments, a pitiful look, and she'll be obedient."" The recording continued playing; John and Diana were discussing the insurance policy, the beneficiaries, and the most suitable secluded location for staging an ""accident."" I listened to John describe me as pathetic and exhausting, saying he couldn't wait to get rid of me.



""He's right, my complaining is exhausting,"" I thought. ""I have to speak in that voice in front of him, it sounds like I'm breathing helium.""



Liam started gesturing in sign language again: Are you angry?



""Angry?"" I pondered the question as the recording ended. ""No, maybe disappointed.""



I walked to the window and looked at the car in the driveway. John was in the driver's seat, his phone flashing in the darkness. He was probably texting diana, telling her what was going on.



""How much do you know?"" I asked Liam without turning my head. ""I mean, about Daniel.""



A long silence followed. Then I felt him gesturing: Enough.



Liam approached me, his hands moving slowly but firmly: ""I know what you're thinking. Don't do this."" ""Let me handle him. You don't need to—""



That's Liam's problem. He's never as good as me at handling things. For example, if I were to follow someone, it would never be this obvious. Or… that's the real problem, right? That's why I posted that silly thread on Reddit. Because Liam was too hasty; he forgot that the last time I used the shovel he brought was great, very sturdy. But he took it with him when he left. Now I need another one, but I don't know where to find one in the middle of nowhere at night.



I patted his cheek and kissed his hair. ""Thanks. But I can handle it.""



So, does anyone have a shovel? I'll DM you the address. Don't worry too much, I'm just doing some gardening to calm Liam and me down. I'm really panicking right now. Also, we might need some acid to deal with the weeds, which would be great if you could bring some.

It's a student house, so it's a bit of a mess regardless, but we'd really like to improve the floor plan. The thing is, we've tried to think of a better setup, but due to the weirdly tapered living room, it's really hard to think of something.

Depicted is the current setup. The colors are as follows:

* Red: couches
* Yellow: armchairs (e.g. Ikea Arsunda)
* Dark green: coffee table
* Light green: dinner table (with 5 chairs not depicted)
* Blue boxes: cabinets
   * Red highlight: buffet cabinet
   * Green highlight: coffee station sideboard
   * The rest are similar height sideboards/cabinets
* Grey: fridges (can't be moved)

The little triangular wall in the top right is a fireplace which hasn't been used in decades, so we don't think it's usable. However, we're not allowed to remove the mantle, so fitting a TV there is very awkward. It's still possible, but the TV would either be 1m30 or 20cm off the floor. No in between.

We're open to getting a new dining table, swapping couches, or removing cabinets, though we'd really like to keep the highlighted cabinets since they're new and very practical. If anyone has suggestions I'd love to hear them :)",1,1768597650.0,FengShui,0,1.0,False

How do I stop this without starting a war?,"I’m 27F in the US, I work at a coffee shop and pick up weekend side gigs when I can. I moved out a few years ago, I pay my own bills, nothing wild, just normal adult stuff. My mom has always been anxious and a little controlling, but lately it’s gotten way worse. She expects me to text her every single day. Not like ""hey how r u"" sometimes, I mean she wants a full check-in: where I am, who I’m with, if I’m home, if I ate, if I’m safe. If I don’t answer fast enough she starts calling. If I miss a day she’ll send stuff like ""I guess you don’t care about me anymore"" or ""I’m your mother and you can’t even take 30 seconds."" Then she spirals into ""I could be dead and you wouldn’t know."" I used to give in because it felt easier than arguing, so yeah I trained her in a way and I hate that. Now it’s affecting my life. I’ll be at work with my hands full, or driving, or just trying to relax, and I get that pit in my stomach because I know what’s coming if I don’t reply.

I’ve tried a few approaches. If I reassure her, it turns into a longer convo and she wants even more. If I say I’m busy, she takes it personally. If I ignore it, she blows up later and drags in my aunt or my grandma like ""everyone thinks you’re being cold to me."" She has also started asking to share my location ""just for peace of mind"" which feels like a trap, honestly. I love my mom, but I’m not her emotional support animal. I don’t want to go no-contact, and I don’t want to spend my whole week managing her moods. She isn’t being mean on purpose, but it’s still manipulative. What’s a realistic boundary here that I can actually enforce? Like do I set a schedule (weekly call), do I stop answering daily texts, do I respond once and refuse follow ups? And how do I say it without it turning into tears and guilt and her acting like I’m abandoning her?

In your experience, what variables have the most significant impact on the cup, and which order do you cycle through variables when dialing? Is it the same order of operation every time? Or do you typically know which variable needs adjusting per coffee? If so, what informs that decision?

I know nearly everyone’s advice to beginners is find a recipe and stick to it and only change one variable at a time, so let’s say that my baseline recipe is 3x bloom and two equal-ish pours up to total weight.

I know that there are more variables than this, but for the sake of not over complicating this exercise, if the variables are:

1. Grind size

2. Temperature

4. Manual agitation (stirring, swirling, etc.)

5. Ratio

Which of these “carries the most weight” when dialing? Do you always start with that one? If not, why?

1qes33e,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1qes33e/i_have_a_theory_that_my_mil_is_in_love_with_my/,I have a theory that my MIL is in love with my husband,"I'm feeling conflicted because I pick up on my MIL's behavior, and it is deeply problematic, but I have a feeling her behavior stems from insecurity, so I end up feeling really bad for her, and then it just leads us to loosening boundaries. I don't want to be caught up in this weird weird weird game. Does it make it any better if this behavior isn't conscious? Is it conscious? 

I'm in my mid-twenties and have been married to my lovely, sweet husband for just under 5 months. We dated for two years before getting engaged, and had an 18-month engagement. I've had a fair share of interactions with my MIL, and the relationship has seen its fair share of ups and downs. I don't want to depict an unfair image, so I will try to be as selective and unbiased as possible. I genuinely want an outsider's perspective on the situation.

I believe I have witnessed some concerning behavior; but because it isn't consistent, I can't quite discern what's going on, and I acknowledge my own biases are playing a role. My husband and I agree that is is problematic and he is working on setting boundaries, and my approach to it has usually been my natural response (empathy extending outwards) but I'm realizing how unwell I feel about the entire relationship. My husband tells me he thinks she is a self-absorbed but doesn't at the core mean ill, she is just flawed and incapable of thinking about things from the perspective of others. To be honest, I sometimes feel like the mistress in my own mariage but not because of anything weird actually going on? My husband puts her in her place, but whenever we both take pity on her, she ends up taking a MILE, and we both feel taken advantage of. It's unhealthy.

The one clear, clear pattern is my MIL acts entitled to our lives and relationship, because in her eyes it doesn't really matter or change things if she is there or isn't there. On one hand it's incredibly intimate, but also she can't / won't accept that we'd want any of our own intimacy or privacy in any sense. I get the feeling that she is holding on to this memory of my husband as a young child so she doesn't understand that a) he is married and b) his wife and him don't really want to share a bedroom anymore with her. I don't know if its perverse or just weird. I feel a lot of pity towards her.

She really was uncomfortable when we got married. On one hand she was thrilled to have an opportunity to get dressed up, and kept talking about being the ""mother of the groom"" but also couldn't stand the day itself. She doesn't speak my native language and we got married in Italy so she asked me to teach her how to say ""mother of the groom"" in Italian and then kept repeating that over and over again. Like, good for you, but also, when my BIL asked if there were any social customs they should be aware of in Italy and I started explaining some she said ""oh, well, better be ready for the opposite of that cause our family isn't like that."" I was trying to give them a debrief of what to expect so they'd get around easily/wouldn't get lost but she acted so much above it, it was insane. If someone wanted to teach me how to say ""hello"" and tell me about road signage laws or driving customs or important things because I was going to a foreign country I'd listen and be thankful! So it's like why do you want to learn one phrase in Italian but also not take an interest in any traditions or customs which would theoretically help in social interactions?

Oh, and she ate off my husband's plate at our wedding. For no reason, she had her own, she was just standing there, walking around, talking to guests, then she picked off his plate, like he owed it to her or something ? SO WEIRD.

Then when they showed up in Italy they struggled SO MUCH, (lol most of the things they were struggling with were things I was trying to explain to them ahead of time) she came up to me super surprised and was like ""you wouldn't believe things we're closed sunday! and the restaurants weren't even open during regular hours."" I think I just laughed it off because it's very much American entitlement.. but the incident stuck with me because she kept parading that one line in Italian as ""mother of the groom,"" and she did in fact make a total and complete fool of herself during the wedding.

I think she has a weird relationship with her own sexuality and femininity because she made *incredibly* out-of-place comments about things (ie marital intimacy) that just shouldn't be discussed in front of others like her husband, me and her son. She kind of closes her eyes / disregards anything that even implicitly gestures that my husband and I have an adult (and thus s\*xual) relationship, but then also oscillates into totally breaking normal boundaries (like she will walk around us essentially half dressed). I guess it actually is coherent - she genuinely doesn't want to accept that we're both adults and married.

There is this constant need for proximity and closeness which has bordered on really odd behavior, but I don't think it's malicious - I think it's from insecurity. She acts a little bit like someone who is constantly afraid that someone or something is going to ""steal"" her baby boy - ie my husband - from her, so she acts in ways most women would consider possessive, a little unhinged. I think being near my husband is regulating for her and calms her nervous system down.

Let me give an example, if we ever have set plans for something, ie ""lets meet at Starbucks at 3pm for coffee"" that puts her in a full spiral. She will call and ask where my husband is and why she can't just come pick him up from work and then drive him over to starbucks and I can just ""find my way there on my own time."" I imagine if she's able to give us both a ride she will, but between meeting us both at 3 pm at starbucks or being able to pick up her son and be with him an additional 10 mins during the drive over while I show up by myself at 3:05, she will take the later every time. She gets so anxious during goodbyes - she used to be bad about it and have full on emotional meltdowns and cry and not really let my husband leave - but she's stopped that. She used to give him these really really long hugs in front of me and the rest of the family, but my husband started pushing her off so much she stopped doing that.

Again, I don't see this as malicious, but it is weirding me out. Whenever we are together she always somehow has this mystery ailment and needs my husband to get he water, or advil, or give her a place to lie down because she needs to take a nap. She is particular in a way I've never experienced. Doesn't want to go anywhere that's loud, or too quiet, or too dark, or too bright. Nothing is ever ""ok"" for her. It's exhausting. My father-in-law indulges her like she is a child, as do my BILs.

Anyways, just venting a bit, definetely confused... not clear on what I should make of this. These are just select examples, I have a a plethera of memories of weird interactions and things which don't sit right.

Yes, my husband is setting boundaries, but it doesn't always go perfectly.

1qes2x9,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1qes2x9/48m_and_quite_depressed/,48M and Quite Depressed,"I've been lurking in this sub for a few months and never thought I'd post but here goes!

Most of the posters I've read are under 40 and mostly even in their teens and 20s so thought I'd add a middle aged perspective.

I'm in my late 40s as noted, no kids and have been single for about 15 years (I've had two LTR in my younger days)

Currently working a job I don't quite hate but quite dislike and making about $45 K a year.
I've achieved three university degrees but was never able to land a job with any of them (the last one was done over 10 years ago)

Financially I have around $35K in debt (mostly CC and some student loan) although thankfully I have about three times that amount in 'reitrement' savings, although I have to dig into it more and more for monthly savings.

I have parents whom I'm close to in my city and go over once a week for dinner, to do laundry and stay over night on one of my days off (although I believe my father's at times fairly harsh parenting style and personality was part of my lifelong struggles with self esteem and confidence)
They are fairly well off financially and do assist me monthly.

I have very good rent on a one bedroom apartment I've lived in for almost 20 years but am facing possible eviction due to damage I've done by admittedly not taking care properly of the carptes and kitchen over the years.

So despite being in a somewhat mild hypomanic state last summer due to positive lifestyle changes to my health, I reverted back into quite a depressive state in mid October as let go of some of my health (including over eating although I've now stopped previous near daily THC use).

I have very few hobbies or interests, and have mostly lost interest in them due to ahendonia (used to be following news and politics, watching TV shows on the paranormal and unxplained and going for walks, although I still get about 8000 steps a day in my workday and on breaks).

I have a handful of friends from high school whom I  keep in sporadic touch with, and one friend in town whom I used to meet weekly for dinner or coffee and now meet maybe once a month as he's now married again and taking care of aged parents.

I did start Lexapro back about 6 weeks ago (and have yet to feel any effects) on the advice of my family doctor, whom I'm currently seeing about once a month for  uncontrolled high blood pressure, despite being on two medications.

Life just feels now like I'm dragging myself through each day and I admittedly spend most of my afternoons and evenings, including days off, lying in bed (and sleeping a bit at times, as I've been struggling with insomnia and daytime fatigue from getting on average 4 hours of sleep a night).

I feel like I have no direction in life except repeating the same depressing and dull week over and over again.
I'm not quite suicidal, although was back in late November/early December, and like many others have mentioned in posts here, I'd be OK if I didn't wake up one day from sleep.

I'm not really looking for advice, and I know reading this it may sound like I actually have quite a bit to be thankful for but I'm just truthfully posting my perspective and am curious of others in their 40s (or younger) are in similar positions.",2,1768597277.0,depression,2,1.0,False

1qes2py,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1qes2py/aita_for_refusing_to_cut_off_my_best_friend_after/,AITA for refusing to cut off my best friend after my boyfriend heard me say we hooked up once three years before we even met?,"My boyfriend just called me a liar and a cheat because he overheard me laughing with my best friend about how ""good seggs doesn't equal love"" and now he won't stop screaming at me to cut him off.

I was on the phone in our bedroom, door half-closed, talking to my best friend about his awful Tinder date. He'd slept with this girl and she immediately started planning their future together, talking about meeting his parents after one night. I was dying laughing and said, ""Dude, just because you had great seggs doesn't mean you're in love. Remember when we hooked up that one time? It was amazing but we both knew we were better as friends.""

My boyfriend walked in right as I said that. I didn't even notice until I heard the bedroom door slam so hard a picture fell off the wall.

I told my best friend I'd call him back. My boyfriend was standing in the hallway, face red, hands shaking. He said, ""You fucked him?""

I tried to explain it happened three years ago, way before we even met. We were both single, drunk at a party, it happened once, and we immediately agreed it was a mistake. We've been purely platonic ever since. But he wasn't listening.

He kept saying I lied to him. I never lied. He never asked if I'd slept with my best friend. I never thought it mattered because it was so long ago and meant nothing. My best friend has been my closest friend since high school. We talk every day, he's been there for every major moment in my life, and my boyfriend knew all of this.

""Every time you hung out with him, you were with someone you fucked,"" he said. ""Every time he came over here, I was sitting next to a guy who's seen you naked. Do you know how humiliating that is?""

I told him he was being ridiculous. It was one drunken night years before we met. My best friend is like a brother to me now. There's zero attraction, zero romantic feelings, nothing.

""I don't care,"" he said. ""You don't get to decide what I'm comfortable with. Either he goes or I go.""

That's when I lost it. I said he was being controlling and insecure. I said if he trusted me, this wouldn't matter. He said trust has nothing to do with it, that I ""disrespected our relationship"" by staying close to someone I'd been intimate with.

We fought for two hours. He brought up every time my best friend and I grabbed coffee, every phone call, every inside joke. He said I was ""emotionally cheating"" because I told my best friend things before I told him. He said the comment about the seggs being ""amazing"" proved I still thought about it.

I tried explaining that I was making a point to my friend, that I wasn't reminiscing or comparing. But every explanation made him angrier.

Finally he said, ""If you don't stop talking to him, we're done. I'm not going to be the idiot boyfriend who lets his girlfriend hang out with guys she's slept with.""

I said, ""Then I guess we're done.""

He grabbed his keys and left. Didn't come back that night. Showed up the next morning with his mom, who started yelling at me about ""betraying"" her son and how I ""trapped"" him in a relationship while keeping my ""backup plan"" around. She called me manipulative and said I was using my boyfriend while staying close to someone I ""really wanted.""

I told her to get out of my apartment. She refused until I threatened to call the cops. My boyfriend just stood there and let her scream at me.

He's been texting nonstop since then. Says he'll forgive me if I block my best friend on everything and promise never to contact him again. He says that's the ""bare minimum"" I can do to prove I respect him.

But my best friend has been there through everything. Bad breakups, family deaths, job losses, all of it. I'm not cutting off a decade-long friendship because my boyfriend is insecure about something that happened before we even knew each other existed.

My boyfriend is now telling all our mutual friends that I ""admitted to cheating"" and half of them have stopped talking to me. He posted something vague on social media about ""loyalty and lies"" and people keep asking me what happened.

His mom showed up at my work yesterday and caused a scene in the lobby, saying I was a cheat and a liar loud enough that my boss pulled me aside to ask if everything was okay.

AITA for refusing to end my friendship?

Here's what I've done, and I'm at a loss to figure out what's left that could be the problem: New pump, opened boiler and cleaned throughly, cleaned three way solenoid, cleaned/cleared water channels in group head (from pump to boiler, and from solenoid to shower head), shower screen.  I've changed coffees, grinds, temperatures, baskets - the usual things which could cause this variable. I don't have a tool/gauge to test pressure. About the only things on the machine I haven't cleaned/replaced is the OPV and the braided pressure hose from the pump to the boiler. (the clear plastic hoses look fine). I opened up the OPV and the spring and seal looked fine (It's probably a 11-12 bar spring, and I'm aware of the 9 bar modification.)

1qes1bj,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1qes1bj/worst_date_of_my_life/,Worst date of my life,"It was with a German guy. IT consultant. We matched and decided to meet today. He lives in one city, I live in another, 30 minutes apart by regional train. I had to go to work in the morning, which is half an hour away from his city, and to get there I had to pass through his city. So my city → his city → my work.

He knew already still I told him in the morning that I would be passing through his city to go to my work, but the way he was replying was totally confusing me. We had originally agreed to meet at 7:30 in my city, so he was supposed to come to me. But suddenly he started saying we could meet in his city instead, because I would be passing through anyway. He even sent me a voice message: “You’re passing through my city, so you can come here.” And he didn’t even ask me if it’s okay to change plans and that I go to his city instead. He just started talking that let’s grab a coiffed when you’re here (his city) and I was like hello? Here as in where?? I had to make this confusion clear over voice messages  to which he later replied yeah bc you’re passing through my city I thought you could just stop here.

Normally, I would never do this, because I had a very heavy laptop bag and I really hate carrying it around. Plus I needed time to reset and freshen up. Anyway I hesitantly agreed.

When we met at the station, he showed up with two big bags. I asked what they were for, and he said he wanted to pick up a LOT of food.  If you know the food sharing thing in Europe, that’s what it was. He hadn’t told me anything about this beforehand. Then barely after saying hi he said okay “we” will pick up the food and then go to a café afterward. The cafe he said he wanted to go to over text was far away from this pick up place so he had ZERO clue what’s nearby the food pick up place. Which he didn’t tell me.

Now he came on his bike and expected me to follow him on a bike. I hate biking. With the heavy as fuck laptop bag my long jacket I had to eventually ride an e-bike for the first time ever. I was completely overwhelmed, carrying the heavy laptop bag, and everything was so spontaneous. He didn’t even think he was doin anything wrong?

First of all when we reached the place I had to go one block extra to park the damn e-bike. Then come back walking wit heavy laptop bag back. Just fyi this is a date and we have had zero eye contact or a decent conversation until now. Once there, he said, “Come in and see what we’re doing.” I said no, I just wanted to go at a nice café. He told me I could wait at Merzenich or Kamps until he was done picking up food. By the way his female friend was already waiting there to pick up free food and he planned A DATE involving this whole plan ?? He didn’t even feel the need to inform me once!  I was losing my mind.

I overheard him telling his friend in German , “I’ll quickly have a coffee and come back.” I told him to finish what he was doing first and then come to me. The options of cafés were so bad there, when I said are you serious you want me to sit at merzenich? He said oh yeah it’s not like a barista style cafe do you want something like that? Umm what do I even say to that? Luckily where we were standing there was a mediocre restaurant better than Merzenich. Waited for him for 15 mins.

Eventually, he came back, with 3 BIG bags of food. On a date. Kept them in the way that even restaurant waiter rolled eyes.

I wanted to splash water on his face,  anyway we talked briefly, and in 30 mins I said I will head to the tram station.

I was so disappointed. The bar with German guys is on the floor. I felt like he just took me for granted without even knowing me. Everything was chaotic, spontaneous, and unplanned. He didn’t take me seriously and made me feel like I didn’t matter. At the end, he just said, “Sorry, I should have planned better” but his face and immaturity level doesn’t comprehend what he has done. He is 30 btw.",19,1768597179.0,dating,7,0.88,False

I had my first child during that time, so I got to know other moms who helped fill the friendship void. I was very close with a couple of them for a few years right after our little ones were born, and then I became closer to other people who I have more in common with and are a better friendship match for me. I also realized I don't like the dynamics in the first group *as my primary friendship group*, but if they were my second- or third-tier friends instead, I wouldn't care what their group dynamics were. I'm still cordial with the first group, but I definitely pulled back as I started focusing more on the people I have more in common with. I still see them around sometimes at our kids' activities and I realized that I enjoy seeing them on a limited basis and having conversations around specific things like books and TV shows (as opposed to heart-to-heart convos where we are making ourselves vulnerable).

How can I reestablish these relationships on a more superficial level? I'm thinking like go out for a drink or a coffee once every few months and just gab about silly things for an hour.

I've only had one relationship which was extremely long-term, and it ended last year after 12 years together. Lately I'm finally starting to feel comfortable to consider looking again.

There's a girl that works a store I frequented with my ex over the last couple of years that we were friendly with, and I still go because I like the store, and now that I'm single I noticed that she's really quite cute. We would frequently chat at length when I visited, sometimes pushing two hours, and I started crushing on her and felt like maybe she was interested too.

Fast forward a couple of months, I asked her out for a coffee date, and she said yes and we exchanged numbers and started talking. The euphoria didn't last particularly long though, as the short version is she ended up letting me know she's already been casually seeing someone else and changed her mind on the date because she's not really a multi-dater type of person. I understood, of course, as I am of a similar mind, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't really bummed out about it.

The vibes have def shifted more towards just being friendly, which for now I am okay with, but I also in the back of my mind am just still really into her. Long-term I'm not sure that I can be just friends if we continue to talk. I've never really had an instance where someone was interested and we were planning a date just to change their mind like this before so it's def throwing me off on how to feel.

Should I be open that, while I understand the situation, I really do like her and that it might be better if we didn't text unless things change and she may want to consider a date again?",1,1768596895.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

## Why 90% of IPTV Services Fail in US/UK/CA

**[ErsatzTV](https://ersatztv.com)** has optimized its routing specifically for English-speaking markets. Here is why it is currently the #1 recommendation:

### 🇬🇧 UK: Premier League & Entertainment
* **Football:** Full coverage of **Premier League** (including 3 PM kickoffs), Championship, and Champions League via TNT Sports & Sky Sports.
* **Entertainment:** BBC iPlayer channels, ITV, Channel 4, and Sky Movies.
* **No VPN Needed:** Works directly without complicated setups.

### 🇨🇦 Canada: Hockey & Regional TV
* **Hockey Night:** Reliable streams for all **NHL** games (Sportsnet & TSN).
* **French/English:** Complete coverage for CBC, CTV, and TVA Sports.
* **Local Channels:** News and weather from Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal.

## Next-Gen Features for 2026

* **⚡ Anti-Freeze Technology:** Proprietary load balancing to stop buffering before it starts.
* **📺 4K HEVC Streaming:** Crystal clear picture quality optimized for large Smart TVs.
* **📱 Multi-Device Support:** Works flawlessly on **Firestick 4K**, NVIDIA Shield, Apple TV, Android, and iOS.
* **📅 Accurate EPG:** 7-day program guide so you never miss a show.

## Verdict: Is It Worth It?

For the price of a coffee, you get access to virtually every channel in the US, UK, and Canada. Stability is king in the IPTV world, and **ErsatzTV** is currently wearing the crown.

1qert6v,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1qert6v/weird_spot_in_life_need_some_advice/,"Weird spot in life, need some advice"," I’m ready to get back into the dating world. I’ve been out of it for 2 years thinking there would be a better time. 

For context, I’m a 22 M. I’m a college graduate. The reason I’m here is because of my employment situation and what that means for me getting back into a relationship. I’m technically unemployed as recent. My internship just ended, and I have been learning how to day trade for 7 months, and just starting to actually trade for about 3 weeks. I’m starting to see real success. I have a family business that I will take over in the next 5-10 years as well. I also am working on my clothing brand. Also I have cash saved up for this situation. I’m working very hard at this entrepreneur style life. If you read my resume you would be impressed. I know I will be successful because of the progress I made so far and just who I am as a person. 

Why am I here???
I’m here because I’m afraid a women will see me as a “bum” or “unemployed kid leeching off his parents”. But it just annoys me because I can easily walk into a McDonald’s or a local spot and get a traditional job, I can also use my college degree and experience to apply to jobs . But at what other point can I chase my dream? You could say when I was in college and younger but I didn’t get the luxury to coming to that conclusion earlier so here I am. To be honest trading is my passion. And I just want someone who sees the vision like I do. I might not be making income from it at the moment, but I’m on cusp. (If this confused you, look up prop firms, and funded accounts in day trading)

If a women doesn’t accept me for what I’m doing I totally understand. I know there are plenty that would. But the problem is I don’t want to distract myself with this.

Here’s my nightmare and why I need advice:

Let’s say I met a women. It got to the point where she asks me what my job is. I say day trading and aspiring entrepreneur. Off the bat, it sounds like a scam artist and a bullshiter. But in reality, I am day trading and getting really good, I also could prob find a basic job tomorrow, and give me a month to find a job with my college degree. It would probably pay good. I can probably take you on nice dinners, but I wanna chase my dreams. I would rather make less right now and keep chasing my dream then take some job just to say I’m doing things “the right way”. The issue is, I don’t want to have to explain that to women. And i also don’t want to waste my time trying to find a gf and she doesnt want me. 

To those of you who will give me real advice and maybe have been in my situation before, thank you

To those who are here to say I’m a bum or I’m never going to do it, just know, once I make 2000 dollars more trading (which isn’t a lot, I’ve made 1000 in 10 minutes multiple times), I can make your monthly salary before you even pour your coffee so watch your words. (Again if this confused you, look up what a prop firm is, it’s why I’m trading but making zero income for now) 

Thanks for reading if you made it this far.

For context, my fiancé is dominant but has difficulties with letting me do the chores while she does what she wants to do.
So, yesterday we had friends over, and we all sat in the kitchen making pizza and some fries, and with that i mean i made them and they talked together. Then my fiancé went to the living room with them to sit and talk, and instead of asking me if i want to sit with them she said i should go get them drinks and make the dishes for food and sauces etc. ready. I did without hesitation. After that i went back to the kitchen and finished the food, wich i served then. After we finished eating, i cleaned the living room and the kitchen, refilled their glasses and brought snacks while they sat there without looking at me much. when they were gone, i prepared my fiancés coffee and tea for tomorrow morning and brought her water to the bed. 
I did all that without her saying thank you or saying that i should join them while there was something to do, not even offering me help. It was a beautiful day and when going to bed i felt great and even thanked her for letting me do this for her.",5,1768596586.0,malehousewives,2,1.0,False

This might sound odd, but I noticed something strange. Whenever I pee after having SuperYou whey protein (cold coffee flavor), my urine literally smells like cold coffee 😅

I’ve been using SuperYou protein for the past 3 months with other flavors and never had this issue. Just recently tried the cold coffee flavor, and this started happening.

No pain, no burning, no other symptoms. Everything else feels normal. The protein quality seems fine, and digestion is okay too.
Has anyone else experienced this with coffee-flavored protein or caffeine-based products?

Is it just the coffee/caffeine metabolites causing the smell, or should I be concerned?

Would love to hear if this is normal or if others have noticed the same thing.

Disclaimer: Its a really goddamn long story, sorry bout my english not a native speaker and if formating is wonky Im writing on my phone, enjoy

So, recently I (23M) got into an old discord channel and found a chatlog between my friend and my old ""nemesis"" (I'll call him Percy from here on out) where he tried to explain some things that happened and justify his actions in the past. I of course read it, got a little heated and had a laugh afterwards cause how it all played out.

Now for the backstory and all that happened.

A few years back in my 17/18s I got into my first ever relationship with my now ex-gf (lets call her Rachel). Things went good for first few months, really good. Then came Covid, lockdown and since it was a long distance relationship, things were starting to fall apart. And that was when he came. Percy started talking to her, being friendly and all that. Percy was Rachels ex, he was also a long distance with her, but unlike with me, he didnt see her ever in person, their prior relationship was purely online. I learned about him, cause Rachel told me, because she didnt want me to worry about him. Well in hindsight I probably should've. But I was kind of naive and just kinda waved it away. Percy started talking to me as well, was really friendly and just all around great guy. I learned that he was originally from US (this story is placed in Europe), has a medical school, is 25 and has 3 children from multiple prior relationships that didnt work out well and hes caring for those children.

And thats when it all started. Percy posted a story on IG about being in love with someone, real romantic stuff so I asked him, who he was talking about. He was reluctant to say but he finally told me It was about my girlfriend, but that he wont be chasing her or anything like that. I was a bit pissed ofc but let it slide. I trust Rachel, I trust Percy, whatever. I was beyond naive, tbh, I was really fucking stupid and a pushover who didnt wanna lose my gf. Well for a week or so things were ok. But then my gf said she wasnt sure she wants to be with me. I told that to Percy and he acted like he didnt know anything. At that time and a short time after that, he was playing me like a fiddle, he was buttering me up, and then playing a victim that no one loves him, I was trying to comfort him and all that, was really nothing but nice, never divulged anything he didnt want Rachel to know, respected his every wish. Then Rachel told me that shes choosing between me and Percy, we created a groupchat started talking but nothing was really adressed and no breakthrough was achieved. In that gc he made me promise not to call her sweetheart, not to say I love her cause it would trigger him, I obliged (dumbass I know). We texted a lot there but it was kinda like a friend group more than anything, with some bumps, where he was acting like a hurt baby, when I let myself slip and called her a pet name, and then again when we planned a couple camp trip when he just straight up told her he loves her AFTER making me promise not to say that to my gf. So we were in a state of being together but like halfway. All the while I (again I was really, really stupid) vented my frustrations to Percy (who at the time called me his brother) which unbeknownst to me he sent straight to Rachel who after a while confronted me about all those things that annoyed me. I was a coward who couldnt tell her those things, I know that now but then? I was so stupid and cowardly. All this caused the relationship I had with Rachel to crumble, she told me she ""chose"" him and broke up with me. I couldnt get over her, kept wanting to see her and I was still texting with Percy, crying to him, just totally depressed. 

After a month or so, when I finally started being a little bit better, I met with Rachel to talk. After a truly long coffee and a long talk, she told me that she doesnt want to be with Percy, that she wants to be with me, and me being truly stupid, I agreed to date her again. Thats the first time Percy showed his true colours. After I told him, that we might get back together with Rachel, he exploded. Melted. He told me about everything she did with him, shown screenshots of their s\*xchats, that there were nudes, while she was still with me, how she thought about having a threesome with me and him, just everything that was incriminating or infuriating. All the receipts everything. But it wasnt to protect me. It was out of spite, just to not let get us back together. He even tried to get me to ask her what were her thoughts about his peepee, just to spite us against each other again, told me that he was pushing her not to have s\*x w me, her still bf at the time etc. It didnt work, we were together for a while and he kind of vanished. I thought it'll be the last time I'll ever hear of Percy. 

The relationship was rocky and we broke up after a few months again because of other reasons. I was 19/20 and I did some questionable things. After I ghosted Rachel, I started talking to her again, slept with her a few times, but I made it clear I wasnt in love and that it was only s\*x. She fell in love with me again but i didnt, so i cut contact with her again, and half a year later, the same cycle happened. I was truly horrible to her and there is no justification for me using her like i did knowing that she'll fall for me again. After we cut contact for the second time with Rachel, I found Percy on a different social media site. 

He contacted me out of nowhere cause she contacted him. She was heartbroken cause of me and kinda ran to him for friendly comfort this time, nothing happened between them at that time. Know that for a fact. Well I started talking with Percy again again, thinking, maybe hes changed, maybe hes a good person now. Started following him on that other platform, hunted a predator with him who was harassing some underage girls on that platform and live went by.

Percy was a part of a predator hunting group/child protecting group on the platform and the people from that group were really nice, smart, just overall great people. 

Now this is where it started being weird again. Percy was trying to forbid me from texting or contacting any of them. He pleaded, begged, did everything he could to get me to stay away from them, cause in his words he didnt want to bridge old friends and new friends. I respected his wish, didnt contact them. Vented to him about frustrations in my life. Confessed that I took a pill of ec\*\*\*sy, smoked w\*\*d a couple times and so on, didnt think much of it but that will appear again later on.

One day, Percy came to me with something. He wanted me to write a poem for his girlfriend (she'll be Lyla from now on) cause supposedly he wanted to apologize for coming home drunk. I asked him to describe her, he kind of hesitated, didnt know colour of her eyes or anything deeper than shes funny and nice. Shouldve been a red flag for me but I didnt think about it much and wrote the poem for him. For a few weeks/months, everything was, well, peaceful. Until I broke my promise and started talking to one of his new friends a girl who I shall name Claire.

This caused explosion from Percy in my dms. That I am a swine, I can't be trusted, that I am a piece of shit etc. Next day he apologized profusely and made me swear to not do it again. But something happened then. One of his friends (lets call him Frank) contacted me. 

Frank wanted to know if I know Percy. I was hesitant to answer, or to share anything. I didnt want to betray Percys trust. But then, Frank told me that Percy has been talking about me and wasnt really kind sent me some screenshots where he said that he wishes someone would punch me and punish me for what I have done to him, nothing specific really but I did something to him? Well I was pissed, not pissed enough to talk about what happened when I first met him. But I divulged some basic info I know about him. Let me just say, Me and Frank were both in for a surprise.

We talked with Frank a bit and found out, that his whole life story was made up. Or at least one of them was. Let me explain. For some reason, Percy told Frank and the group that he was born in Spain, while he told me that he was born in US. Percy told me that he had three mothers for the three children, he told them that he had two. Even the most basic stuff like age or a fucking latex allergy which caused him to have children was different in each story. To this day I dont even know what was true and what wasnt or if any of it was. I was so f\*\*\*\*ng pissed, you wouldnt believe so I told Frank everything, how he would treat me like a brother and scheme to take my gf. How he would play victim for sympathy points etc etc. Frank even sent me screenshots where Percy at first claimed to be my friend and that I'm nice and switching up when it looked like I would be accepted among them.

And that was when I learned some more about what was happening. 

He was doing the same f\*\*\*\*ng thing to another goddamn couple. Playing both sides, playing victim, acting like a hurt child, betting that they are goodhearted people that have empathy for him, trying to steal someone elses gf. Can you guess who it was dear reader? It was Lyla. The same Lyla for whom I was tasked to write the poem. So he used me again, this time just to help him do what he did to me to someone else. So me and Frank crossexamined the poem he sent to Lyla, and mine. That MFer even changed capital letters to make it seem like it was from him. After that, they kicked him out of the group, I kicked him out of my life and joined the group in which he was before.

Since I was free of my promise, I started talking more to Claire and she said that Percy told her and the group that I r\*\*\*d someone in a bar and that Im a drug addict (based on me having a pill of e***asy and smoking w**d as I wrote above) just to get me hated by everyone in there, just so they wouldnt contact me ever and at the same time acting like hes my bestest friend in the whole goddamn world. That really took me by surprise (well Im kinda amazed that something would surprise me from this a-hole)

Jump forward to a few days ago. Me and Lyla are talking since we became really good friends (as well with Claire, that will be relevant later) and she suggests that we should revive an old discord channel of that now gone friend group. I got admin role and noticed a channel called ""log"". In there was a file with some chatlog and imagine my surprise when I learned its a chatlog of a confrontation conversation between Frank and Percy about what happened at that time. 

I was reaaaaally curious and found out that not really surprisingly Percy started to shittalk Frank when Frank was finally seeing through his lies. But what caught my eye was the part about me. He tried to tell Frank that I took HIS girl, then he took her from me and that after all of that we had the threesome that Rachel mentioned. Huh, weird, I dont remember any threesome. And again tried to convince Frank that I r\*\*\*d someone but this time it was Rachel and it was on that couple camp trip, that she called him about how it hurt and how she didnt want it. He changed the story with someone random at the bar to make it more plausible. My god am I angry again. 

Now why is my friendship with Claire relevant. In the same conversation Percy told Frank that he was protecting her from me cause he thought that I would enable and encourage her self harm and that again Im a junkie scum. Well I sent it to her since she doesnt want to be in the group and It made her laugh so much I kinda forgot all that anger.

And now here we are. Hes out of my life, but I can't help but wonder if hes doing all that again somewhere, somehow. Guess I'll never know. After all, I am partially glad it all happened cause I gained so many friends that helped me through my rough patches and that even after all that happened me and Rachel are on good terms and even she blocked him everywhere.

Well Percy, wherever you are, I still fu***ng hate you, you're still my fu\*\*ing nemesis. And I hope that if your lying ass is somewhere doing the same shit that it wont work out a-fu\*\*ing-gain.",2,1768596229.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

1qerhx5,https://www.reddit.com/r/criminalminds/comments/1qerhx5/hotch_x_reid_headcanons/,Hotch x Reid Headcanons,"# Hotch x Reid Headcanons: 

* Hotch is hesitant to let Reid move in with him to the extent that he doesn't realise that Reid practically lives with him already. Reid has a toothbrush at his and spare clothes and all his favourite snacks and a small pile of books that just keep piling up in a spare room and is slowly taking it over. When Hotch finally figures it out he's freaking out until Jack asks if Reid is making him pancakes again and Hotch sees Reid cooking for his son and it's all so natural and Hotch realises he's utterly fucked in love. 
* Reid was utterly oblivious before he and Hotch started dating. He knew that he liked Hotch but thought that Hotch wasn't feeling the same for him when he couldn't be further from the truth. Reid would brush off Hotch's flirting as him being nice, taking care of his team because he's a good leader, e.c.t, but when Reid realises the truth Hotch doesn't stand a chance as Reid hunts that man down to climb him like a tree. 
* Hotch starts bringing Reid coffee every morning after Reid complains once about it being too salty but he's the only one complaining. Each day Reid tells Hotch he doesn't need to, each day Hotch brings Reid a coffee. It develops to the point where Hotch does't work immediately when getting to work but he and Reid share a coffee and talk before working - but they are both always early to work so by the time they finish coffee its the official working hours. 
* Reid surprisingly has the best immune system but Hotch has the worst one. Hotch always tries to hide when he's sick but Reid sees through him every time. Reid likes to take care of Hotch and Hotch secretly adores it but doesn't like to say it. 
* Rossi finds out first and teases them both endlessly and gives them both the shovel talk. Rossi tells Hotch not hurt Reid or else Rossi would take him down quicker than he can try to justify his actions but at the same time Rossi goes to Reid and also tells him not to hurt Hotch or else Rossi would take him down quicker than he could justify, and Rossi doesn't tell the other he's threatened them both. Hotch and Reid both keep it a secret for months until the truth comes out. #
* (saw in a fanfiction) JJ finds out because Henry complains that Jack is always getting to see Reid because Reid and Hotch are always having sleepovers, unaware that he just outed her boss and best friend. 
* Reid always gets flustered and doesn't often say 'I love you' to Hotch so he does small acts of service which Hotch knows mean the same thing, such as making sure he eats during long cases, helping him file paperwork, staying up on the jet journey home and talking about Jack. When Reid does say I love you it always makes Hotch breathless. Hotch will say 'I love you' all the time in private because he regets not telling Haley it enough, and if anything ever happened to Reid, Hotch wants Reid to know that he's loved. In public, Hotch will whisper it to Reid or will hand him small notes with little love letters on. 
* Emily forces Reid to gossip with her, JJ and Garcia about Hotch. 
* Derek freaks out when he learns the truth about Hotch and Reid, seriously freaks out. In his mind, he knows that Hotch isn't a predator and that Reid is capable of making his own decisions, but he can't stop the worry. Hotch is about10 years older than Reid, he's Reid's boss. Derek all but threatens Hotch every time the man breathes near Reid until Garcia knocks some sense into him. It's a slow change but progress. It also helps Derek when Reid explains to Derek that even if Hotch hurt him, Reid has just as much leverage over him in a professional sense to get Hotch fired and disgraced as Hotch has over him. 
* Reid and Hotch don't tell Jack about their relationship for a long time. Jack finds out when Jess drops Jack home earlier than expected one day and he finds Reid in his father's shirt and pieces it together immediately. It's all taken in stride. 
* Garcia makes them a scrapbook for their one year anniversary. Over the year she secretly took photos of them both, some they have no idea how she even got, and they both love it. They both tell her as much in their own ways even if they deny liking it to everyone else. 
* Reid opens up to Alex about his insecurities in dating Hotch - that he's inexperienced, that Hotch has to take control more often than not because this is his first 'adult' relationship and he doesn't actually know what he's doing - and Alex talks him through it. She also ends up having the sex talk with Reid even though Reid insists he knows everything, she just can't help herself. 
* Reid hasn't dated anyone before Hotch. He and Ethan have slept together, a lot, but that's it. He doesn't know how to date and he fears that Hotch will get grossed out by his autistic traits or his inexperience and starts masking heavily. Hotch is gutted and tries to talk to Reid about it but Reid isn't listening as his doubts are too loud. In the end it takes Hotch making an extremely detailed PowerPoint explaining why he loves Reid for who he is and all his traits - it's so detailed with an introduction and a detailed list on why he loves Reid and what benefits Reid brings him and the scientific beninfits and it's all very emotional and Reid cries. Hotch freaks out thinking he's messed up but he hasn't. 
* Hotch talks him through sex in detail and asks for consent constantly. Reid loves it because it helps him stay grounded and feel in control and it's incredibly sexy when Hotch starts instructing him. Hotch with sex is amazing to Reid compared to Ethan, which was more about getting off than intimacy. 
* Hotch has a kink for having sex in his office but chickens out each time he even thinks of trying it. Reid finds it amusing and will tease him deliberately. Hotch's embarrassment only gets worse when he and Reid are kissing in the office after hours, his hands undoing Reid's belt when Rossi walks in and starts filming them. Hotch is mortified but Rossi finds it hilarious. 
* Reid hogs the blankets when it gets cold because he rolls and ends up like a sushi roll, but when it's hot Reid can't stand being under the covers. Hotch ends up buying another duvet because he can't stand being cold in winter but too hot in summer. 
* Neither of them realises how domestic they've gotten until they turn down going out for drinks with the team because they are folding laundry together, and they have a TV show on in the background and both enjoy folding laundry because it's time they spend together. 
* Hotch likes to bake with Jack, something they started doing more of after Haley died, but Reid can't stand cooking. Reid likes to sit on the counter and watch them, sometimes reading a book, sometimes stealing cookie dough or cake batter. 
* They hold hands on the jet journeys on the way to and from cases.

Basically it mean you revisit a past memory and you revise it in a way that makes you feel good so you think that version actually happened so you feel better to manifest in the present moment? At least that’s how I think it works.

I am really insecure about my past. I’m 32 but I haven’t had any milestones or experiences everyone else had. Like I never had friends that stuck. I never had any crazy teenage romance or parties or experiences. I never partied in college or had friends I just went to class and went home. I had a couple relationships afterwards but it didn’t lead anywhere. I don’t have any experiences to share with anyone I’m just living life by myself. Whenever I make friends they always leave or it stays very surface level. Recently I reached out to a friend group asking anyone if they wanted to grab coffee and nobody responded and 2 weeks later they said happy new year then finally replied sorry they were out of town.

I had a dream last night of the popular girls from my high school. One of them is a successful influencer IRL and now married to a hot guy and her bff is also successful too and they’re still best friends. I think it’s because I have been creeping on their Instagram and I always get jealous of that. Some of them still talk to their friends from high school too. I don’t know why I dreamt about them but I felt so excluded and below them and wish I had those experiences. I know there’s no changing the past but I just need to revise it in a way that makes me feel better where I can just let go and move on.",1,1768595891.0,Manifestation,0,1.0,False

She felt the weight of her family’s issues on her shoulders, even if only partially.*

Hope you're all doing amazing! 
I am aware that the sample above does not tell much about the actual plot, yet I wished to include it as an example of my writing (I can write more, depending on the situation in the roleplay itself ;).

But Frog, you may ask, what is this roleplay even about? Well, let me tell you:
Zofia, a 19 year old daughter of a financially-struggling family, is sent to work as a maid in a noble household, somewhere distant. My main goal for this roleplay is to explore how her new life would look like, everyday chores and challenges that her occupation brings, relations between her coworkers (both camaraderie and conflict) and other members of the household as well as perhaps events happening in the town they’d live in. It's a simple premise, but one that gives us so many possibilities! I'd love to hear your ideas as well ^^

A bunch of extra details:
- *Please know that even though I am looking for someone to GM this story, I’ll contribute as much as you wish. Be it brainstorming, playing some side characters, you name it. As someone who knows how it is to GM, I wish for you to enjoy the roleplay as well (＾-＾)*
- *While this roleplay is meant to be wholesome and cozy, there will be some more somber tones from time to time.*
- *Brainstorming and worldbuilding! Whether we decide to place it in our real world Victorian era, or perhaps a fictional setting, I’d appreciate it if we dedicated some time to setting up the plot, adjusting it and tailoring to our wants, deciding on the core themes as well as worldbuilding (the household, for example).*
- I’d love to capture the aesthetics of manga/anime, even with the ways we’d write our roleplay. Some exaggeration, tropes and so one are very welcome :D
- *I am open to romance, although only between two women ^^” I don’t mind it being a sizable part of our story, however, I don’t want it to overshadow everything else, nor feel rushed.*

(I'd also be open to a similar roleplay inspired by ""Bride's story"" :3)

**About me:**

Why hello! I shall introduce myself a bit, so that you also know who you’re dealing with. You may call me Frog. I’m a passionate, 18+ roleplayer from CET/GMT +1 timezone. However, I do not think those pose any obstacle in terms of writing, so don’t be deterred by that even if you’re from a completely different part of our space-roaming disc silly autocorrect, I meant globe :P. Besides that, I don’t have much to share about me, I reckon. I love cats though, that’s worth a mention!

The [X4Y] tag does reflect the gender of my characters, not my own. I prefer not sharing it. I hope you’ll understand <3

Here you’ll find a few requirements, so that we are sure we match.
- *Be 18+. Do not tell me your exact age or real gender, just confirm if you are 18+*
- *Be literate. I love writing, especially descriptions, which I find to greatly enhance the storytelling. I usually provide around 2-4 paragraphs per response and would ask for my partner to be able to match that. However, I’ve recently been hoping to try a short-length approach for conversations to make them more dynamic ^^* 
- *Be creative! Cheesy, I know, but hey, I don’t want to be the only one coming up with the ideas. This premise has so much potential for unique and intriguing tales, let’s brainstorm them together!*
- *Be excited! Yeah, another cheesy one. Yet, I find it so fun to see an enthusiastic reply!*

1qerfc0,https://www.reddit.com/r/woodworking/comments/1qerfc0/looking_for_woodworking_feedback_on_table_design/,Looking for woodworking feedback on table design,"llo,  
I am looking for some feedback from experienced woodworkers/carpenters on whether this table design is structurally sound and practically sound.

The goal is a **transformable** table that moves between **Coffee table->Dinner Table->Boardgame** **Table**. The table will stay in coffee mode for 90%.A hinge connects the central spine/apron assembly and allows the tabletop structure to rotate upward into dining height.

Key details.

* Dining mode: seats 8–10 people
* Approx. outer size:
   * Dining: \~100 × 240 cm
   * Coffee: \~100 × 140 cm
* Dining height: \~76 cm
* Leg clearance: 66 cm
* Apron: 7.5 × 5.0 cm
* Legs: 5.0 × 5.0 cm, angled at \~75°
* Central recessed “cellar” depth: 6.5 cm (for board-game use)

I have designed magnets for the table top covers to click together and a channel so i can add a rubber gasket in case of spills.

**Main concern**  
One important point: in the dining and board-game configurations, the hinge takes all the vertical load, not just during movement but in the static raised position as well.  
I’m concerned about  durability ,wear and alignment in this setup, and I’d like feedback on whether this is a reasonable approach or if the load should be redirected to solid stops or another structure once raised. However i am all out of ideas on how to solve this. I’m open to redesigning the mechanism entirely.I’ve also considered a hybrid approach using metal components for the apron  My concern there is added weight and whether that introduces new problems for daily use rather than solving the core structural issue.

Please remember I am merely an engineer with beginner skills in CAD software and 0 experience in furniture or woodworking.  
I really appreciate any feedback.

I’ve always been a sleepy person - I remember my mom and grandparents commenting that I could fall asleep any time, anywhere. 

About 1.5-2 years ago I started making lifestyle changes and wanted to get my health in order. One of the things I finally decided to confront was my constant falling asleep - it had really ramped up over the year or two preceding and it was becoming difficult to stay awake some days. I’ve fallen asleep at work, on the phone, standing up,.. Driving.. It was getting out of hand.

So I started with my family doctor and ended up at a sleep doctor. After my sleep study and nap test, I ended up “in the narcoleptic range”. My sleep specialist put me on Modafinil, which I began taking it at the end of February 2025. He described it as “a strong cup of coffee” - nothing too strong, not a lot of side effects. 

He was so wrong. I didn’t really realize what was happening. It took me months to figure it out. At the end of March, I had a psychotic break. Things kept getting worse, I began getting paranoid and experiencing suicide ideation in ways I had never experienced before. Sure I had struggled in the past, but this was ACTIVE. 

Finally at the end of July, still unaware of the cause, I googled how much modafinil it would take to… 

And that’s when I found it. Those words. Serious, rare side effects. Psychosis. Suicide ideation. The answer.

I stopped taking it immediately (later the pharmacist told me that was actually unadvisable). A few days later I ended up in the hospital on a mental health hold. I took 17 weeks off work.

It’s now January 2026. Six months later. More time than I ever took those pills. And I still struggle. My life was turned upside down. And the side effect can be permanent. 

I wanted to share this in case someone else is on this drug and maybe something seems ""off"".... maybe I can save someone some pain.",5,1768595486.0,Narcolepsy,0,0.86,False

He made a huge spectacle of it, posting one photo after another on Instagram. Turning me into the biggest joke in our

Now, he stood at the bedroom door, frowning at the completely transformed room.

1qer3oc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1qer3oc/aio_or_is_my_mil_in_love_with_my_husband/,AIO or is my MIL in love with my husband?,"I can't tell if my MIL is a narcissist or not. Truly.

I'm in my mid-twenties and have been married to my lovely, sweet husband for just under 5 months. We dated for two years before getting engaged, and had an 18-month engagement. I've had a fair share of interactions with my MIL, and the relationship has seen its fair share of ups and downs. I don't want to depict an unfair image, so I will try to be as selective and unbiased as possible. I genuinely want an outsider's perspective on the situation.

I believe I have witnessed some concerning behavior; but because it isn't consistent, I can't quite discern what's going on, and I acknowledge my own biases are playing a role.

The one clear, clear pattern is my MIL acts entitled to our lives and relationship, because in her eyes it doesn't really matter or change things if she is there or isn't there. On one hand it's incredibly intimate, but also she can't / won't accept that we'd want any of our own intimacy or privacy in any sense. I get the feeling that she is holding on to this memory of my husband as a young child so she doesn't understand that a) he is married and b) his wife and him don't really want to share a bedroom anymore with her... (yes that really actually is something that happened and a conversation that did happen around our wedding planning process). I don't know if its perverse or just weird. I feel a lot of pity towards her.

She really was uncomfortable when we got married. On one hand she was thrilled to have an opportunity to get dressed up, and kept talking about being the ""mother of the groom"" but also couldn't stand the day itself. She doesn't speak my native language and we got married in Italy so she asked me to teach her how to say ""mother of the groom"" in Italian and then kept repeating that over and over again. Like, good for you, but also, when my BIL asked if there were any social customs they should be aware of in Italy and I started explaining some she said ""oh, well, better be ready for the opposite of that cause our family isn't like that."" I was trying to give them a debrief of what to expect so they'd get around easily/wouldn't get lost but she acted so much above it, it was insane. If someone wanted to teach me how to say ""hello"" and tell me about road signage laws or driving customs or important things because I was going to a foreign country I'd listen and be thankful! So it's like why do you want to learn one phrase in Italian but also not take an interest in any traditions or customs which would theoretically help in social interactions?

Then when they showed up in Italy they struggled SO MUCH, (lol most of the things they were struggling with were things I was trying to explain to them ahead of time) she came up to me super surprised and was like ""you wouldn't believe things we're closed sunday! and the restaurants weren't even open during regular hours."" I think I just laughed it off because it's very much American entitlement.. but nonetheless she has a lot of pride because she didn't seem to care at all when she'd humiliate herself publicly.

Oh, she ate off my husband's plate at our wedding, for no reason, she had a plate, she just stood there and picked little things off. I have no idea why.

I think she has a weird relationship with her own sexuality and femininity because she made *incredibly* out-of-place comments about things (ie marital intimacy) that just shouldn't be discussed in front of others like her husband, me and her son. She kind of closes her eyes / disregards anything that even implicitly gestures that my husband and I have an adult (and thus s\*xual) relationship, but then also oscillates into totally breaking normal boundaries (like she will walk around us essentially half dressed). I guess it actually is coherent - she genuinely doesn't want to accept that we're both adults and married.

There is this constant need for proximity and closeness which has bordered on really odd behavior, but I don't think it's malicious - I think it's from insecurity. She acts a little bit like someone who is constantly afraid that someone or something is going to ""steal"" her baby boy - ie my husband - from her, so she acts in ways most women would consider possessive, a little unhinged. I think being near my husband is regulating for her and calms her nervous system down.

Let me give an example, if we ever have set plans for something, ie ""lets meet at Starbucks at 3pm for coffee"" that puts her in a full spiral. She will call and ask where my husband is and why she can't just come pick him up from work and then drive him over to starbucks and I can just ""find my way there on my own time."" I imagine if she's able to give us both a ride she will, but between meeting us both at 3 pm at starbucks or being able to pick up her son and be with him an additional 10 mins during the drive over while I show up by myself at 3:05, she will take the later every time. She gets so anxious during goodbyes - she used to be bad about it and have full on emotional meltdowns and cry and not really let my husband leave - but she's stopped that. She used to give him these really really long hugs in front of me and the rest of the family, but my husband started pushing her off so much she stopped doing that.

Again, I don't see this as malicious, but it is weirding me out. Whenever we are together she always somehow has this mystery ailment and needs my husband to get her something. I don't want to be insensitive, maybe she truly is very fragile, but she also will do it to herself often. It feels like martyring oneself? Is that a thing?

We'll suggest something and she'll go about doing it the HARDEST way possible and then be ""exhausted"" or ""upset."" She is particular in a way I've never experienced. Doesn't want to go anywhere that's loud, or too quiet, or too dark, or too bright, or then say something is ""ok"" but then be upset later. Nothing is ever truly ""ok"" for her. It's exhausting. My father-in-law indulges her like she is a child, as do my BILs.

Anyways, just venting a bit, definetely confused... not clear on what I should make of this. These are just select examples, I have a a plethera of memories of weird interactions and things which don't sit right.

EDIT (for clarity): Folks are asking what my husband is doing about it, he is setting boundaries, the issue is given the degree of boundaries we need to be setting the entire family system is shutting us out in turn. So, father-in-law, BILs, sister-in-law. We maintain individual relationships with people and that pisses them off. Like they discourage individual relationships. 

For example, (with the long hugs) he pushes his mom away and laughs it off and she no longer does it. With accessing our house, he talks to her like a toddler like ""hey mom if you want something just ask!"" He struggles with things like the ""picking him up"" things because his ENTIRE FAMILY system has it in their minds that there is no maximum amount of time that could be seen as good to be spent as a collective family system. Like, we could spend every single moment of our entire lives with every single member of the extended family and that would be ""optimal."" His folks are in withdrawal when they aren't with their siblings/parents. Like actually, in withdrawal. They don't socialize outside of their family unit (I think in part to their horrible social skills). So, it's more than just a few boundaries, it's negotiating how much we want anyone else in the extended family as part of our lives. And the consequences of cutting them out are deep. But my husband has told me point blank if they don't shape up he doesn't mind cutting them out of his life. They haven't responded well to the boundaries we've set and are honestly kind of punishing us in turn, so are these relationships even viable? Sorry, I digress.

1qer38h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nanny/comments/1qer38h/aita_for_firing_her/,AITA for firing her,"Hi everyone, I need to vent and also get outside perspective because I’m honestly still heated.

I have a 7 month old baby and a toddler. We’ve had our nanny for about 2 months and she mainly cares for my baby as my toddler goes to a daycare school.

The incident that happened yesterday was:

My baby has been teething and had a cold like symptoms runny nose/cough. Before I left for work, I checked her temperature and she did NOT have a fever. She looked like she had a normal little cold/teething situation. Which she had two days ago. Judy got a bit worse. Also if I truly felt my baby was too sick, I wouldn’t have gone to work and would’ve stayed home with her. I’m a mom, I’m not careless. I’m a nurse too. 

My nanny not an hour passed since she arrived called to tell me she wants to leave because she “doesn’t want to get sick” since her wedding is coming up this weekend. I understand her concern, so I asked permission from work to leave early and I came back. I rushed to change my scrubs and washed my hands then went to her to pay her. I paid her only the hour that she worked, but it turned into a whole argument. She was refusing to leave until I she’s paid for the full day. I calmly asked her to leave and we will talk later. 

That was honestly the final straw, because this wasn’t the only issue. There have been multiple things over the last couple months that made me feel like she was self centered and not focused on my baby.

Other things that led up to me firing her:

	•	She constantly seemed more concerned about what she can eat and what she can get done rather than actually helping with baby care.

	•	She cooked herself a full meal often using a 1 lb pack of ground beef from our fridge with our food while my baby was awake and needed attention.

	•	She drinks two cups a day of my expensive Evolution  fresh orange juice (the big bottles are not cheap) and it’s mainly for my toddler. I never said she couldn’t have anything, but it felt excessive that it will finish quickly and entitled.

	•	My baby usually takes two naps, each about 1.5–2 hours. During naps she mostly studies, but she never uses that time to do basic baby related cleanup like organizing toys, tidying the baby’s room, or resetting the space.

	•	She left her ovulation kits in my personal bathroom drawer… with the used sticks. Like… actual used tests in my drawer. She had Clearblue digital tests and Mira tests. She also filled up my bathroom trash can with them and would see it’s overflowing and just… not care.

	•	First thing in the morning when she comes in, she spends like 10 minutes doing her ovulation test while my baby is awake, then makes breakfast and coffee. Again, I get being human, but it felt like my baby was never the priority.

So after today’s blow-up, I ended her employment. I’m paying her for the hours she worked, but I didn’t feel safe or comfortable continuing after the argument and refusal to leave.

I feel guilty because childcare is hard to find, but I also feel like I’m not asking for anything crazy just basic professionalism, boundaries, and putting my baby first.

AITA for firing her

Ps she came back an hour later to take her ovulation kits  and pee sticks. I made sure she knew I was aware that I knew where she keeps it! Also I send her cash as a wedding gift letting her know she’s fired. ",81,1768594986.0,Nanny,79,0.84,False

Having grown up with a SNES and got into retro gaming relatively early in its resurgence, I've been enamored with this goofy little collection since booting it up the weekend after Christmas. It's *Action 52* but fully-realized - a comparison that's not unique to me but I'll make it anyway. My adult life doesn't really work out for 2+ hour gaming sessions (and besides, I get antsy as hell), so these bite-sized chunks for 30 minutes of play here and there end up working perfectly... and tripling my average weekly gaming already this year. I'm kinda-sorta going chronologically but allowing myself to play whatever seems cool, too.

I've gotten hints and bits of the overarching meta-game, but I'm already enjoying how the game tells a story about the developers' relationships over time and their game design idiosyncrasies. If I've got any issues now, it's more presentation than actual gameplay: some of these  feel a bit *too* modern for the conceit. Kick Club plays like a 1990 NES or Master System game, whereas Avianos is absolutely perfect for its time. In comparison, Attactics is just straight-up a Flash game and doesn't fit the ""mid-80s computer game"" conceit at all, even if I stretch it a bit into ""they were ahead of their time"". Likewise, I think some of the end-states don't really make sense for the ostensible framing. Magic Garden and Velgrass sure as hell would not stop you at 200 itty-bitties saved and the fourth floor; you'd go til you failed. Still doesn't make them less fun though!

I'm not pushing myself to cherry all the games, but I would like to get gold in all of them. In my old age, I'm better about saying when I've gotten what I wanted out of the experience instead of being a completionist. (If only I had this thought when I fully completed *Donkey Kong 64* in 2012.)

**Thoughts so far:**

* **Barbuta:** Haven't played enough to get deep on it yet, but this absolutely captures the feeling of booting up some obscure Commodore 64 game and being completely lost. I'll dive into it more during the next stormy weekend.
* **Bug Catcher:** As a big fan of *Into the Breach*, I still had some difficulties with this one! Things began to unlock once I prioritized movement over number of shots, especially in stomping on and pushing bugs. Made it to almost the end of Day 6 on my gold run, so I'm sure next time I'll get it. Highly replayable and a good puzzle game all to its own. (Another one that also perfectly captures this early/mid-80s vibe.) This is my third most-played at around 3.5 hours so far.
* **Ninpek (Cherry #4):** As soon as that autoscroller started, I thought ""oh hell yeah, authentic arcade bullshit"". Extremely difficult upon my first few plays in true NES fashion, especially with NG+ mode. I cherried it in under an hour (and felt like a god doing so). This is one of the games that sort of falls flat in the conceit for me as I feel like a true 1983/1984 game would repeat the two cycles but just make things faster in some way, which also diminishes its replayability. Still, loved it in general.
* **Paint Chase (Cherry #10):** Make this green-monochrome, and I could've played it on the GameBoy in 1997. A surprisingly difficult puzzle-racer with just the right length and just the right stress level.
* **Magic Garden (Cherry #5):** Would be one of my favorite games in the collection if it had an endless mode. Another one that perfectly captures the arcade feeling, replete with input buffering. The strategy of purposefully making evil itty-bitties to ramp up that score was a nice risk-reward, and I blew past the cherry condition when I went for it.
* **Mortol (Cherry #11):** Echoing others who have called this one of the best in the collection, and far more deep than I initially saw it when I started seeing how the various rituals interacted with one another. Got to the cherry on my first go, and I'd certainly come back. Great example of something that felt like a complete experience, and I don't think I'd want it longer since each level can be so intricately approached for optimization.
* **Velgrass (Cherry #9):** I like it, but the first example of something that felt more like a flash game than something realistically designed for this era. Felt extremely good to get a handle on, and like Magic Garden it would have been greatly buoyed with endless mode being part of its presentation as opposed to only four levels. One of my favorites despite not feeling part of the conceit, especially when next to the much more authentically retro Planet Zoldath.
* **Planet Zoldath:** Haven't played enough to really have an opinion, with only 20-ish minutes. The pick-up/put-down inventory management is kinda annoying, but once again this perfectly captures the ""old PC game"" feeling in its obtuse GUI.
* **Attactics (Cherry #7):** Another ""this is a flash game"" feeling, and the worst offender of all I've played so far. The actual tactics took me a bit to get a hold of (especially by way of lining up guys so there's an unstoppable row to get victories), but now I think it's quite fun. Will likely occasionally return for endless play.
* **Devilition (Cherry #12):** My second-most played at 4 hours. Took me a hella long time to visualize the chain of explosions. I learned that cannons are by far the best starter, and the final boss was more a victory lap than anything else. Would certainly return, very highly approved.
* **Kick Club (Cherry #14):** Authentic Master System difficulty at its finest. Booted this up and died within two stages, thought ""the fuck"", and moved on to Campanella. In retrospect, this absolutely rules and is totally something I would have bought and beat my head against as a kid only to finally complete in my late teens. The mechanic of always having the ball to rack up points was an excellent addition and kept me aggressive more so than the (surprisingly generous) timer.
* **Avianos:** Next to Barbuta, this is hands-down the most authentically ""early PC game"" in the collection. Primitive graphics, obscure mechanics that you have to figure out, and a computer that feels like it's cheating until you get the hang of things. I'm stuck on the second trial now as I'm not too experienced with 4X games, but this is a top five favorite.
* **Mooncat:** Haven't played enough to say, though the aesthetics are on point.
* **Bushido Ball (Cherry #2):** Another example of ""felt impossible, then felt amazing"" as well as ""this doesn't fit the conceit of a 1986 video game"". Getting down lobs and trick shots made this feel beautiful by the end. Ayumi is the champ; taking advantage of her caltrops led me to an easy cherry. So far I've beaten it with 4/6 characters sans continues, and I'll finish it with the rest.
* **Block Koala (Cherry #16):** Really, this is a bad game? I thought it was pretty good! But I have a mind for Sokoban, so 5 hours without guides felt perfectly doable for me. I think people get burned out by playing it nonstop, and I don't think it's meant to be that way. For me it was the perfect game to use as a quick work break to knock out 1-3 puzzles. My criticism mostly has to do with the uneven difficulty, as puzzles 15-25 felt much more difficult than anything afterwards. (I think I finished puzzles 41-49 in less than a half hour.)
* **Camouflage (Cherry #6):** Same as everyone else, this game feels woefully incomplete compared to the full-packaged Block Koala. Excellent conceit, no replayability, would absolutely buy a version that had 5-6 worlds.
* **Campanella (Cherry #13):** The cherry condition sucked a bit of the fun out of it for me, as I got tired of looking for the coffee spawn points by World 3 and just started looking them up. In retrospect, I should've just been happy with the gold and left from there. Great action-maze game though - and another that feels authentic for the time. This could easily come out on the NES in 1987 or so.
* **Golfaria:** N/A; booted it up, saw I had limited strokes, got stressed, played something else.
* **Big Bell Race (Cherry #8):** An excellent 35-minute game to cherry that once again feels exactly like its conceit of a pack-in game for the system. An asset flip in every sense of the phrase. Easy but fun.
* **Warptank:** N/A.
* **Caramel Caramel:** One of the first games I booted up, and it's hard as balls. Like an evil Gradius. Haven't played much of it since I started going more chronological-ish.
* **Party House:** Booted it up only for the metagame, though I know it's a favorite. I'm fairly allergic to deckbuilders but I trust yall.
* **Divers:** I actually kinda dig this, and even more knowing that your items get refreshed with every return. It's like an alternate-reality NES *Dragon Quest*, and I love the GameBoy-ish sprite outlines. I'm about halfway through or so.
* **Vainger:** N/A, only booted up for a quick minute. I like the VVVVV/NES Metroid combo and will likely enjoy it more upon playing.
* **Pingolf:** Another flash-esque game that feels hard and mechanically obtuse in a way I know I'll dive right into once I give it a proper shake.
* **Hyper Contender:** Not my thing. I've beaten it with two characters and will likely go for the cherry, but I'm not much of a platform fighter guy outside of some Smash Bros. with friends, and the controls used for stuff like blocking and sliding/kicking feel unnatural. I don't play fighting games (other than aforementioned Smash) so perhaps that's something people who play those games have easier times with. The AI is too good at this game.
* **Star Waspir:** Hard as balls. Got halfway through Stage 3 with the second pilot and haven't touched much since.
* **Night Manor:** N/A. I'll go into it when I have a longer stretch of gaming time. But I love horror games and especially horror point-and-click games.
* **Elfazar's Quest (Cherry #1):** The first game I booted up, just looking at anything potentially cool. It's NES *Fester's Quest* but good! Cherried it pretty quickly and haven't touched it since, but it made an excellent first impression. The card conceit is very inspired.
* **Pilot Quest (Cherry #15):** One of my least-liked games in the entire collection. Idle games bore the hell out of me; it's the equivalent of eating unadorned white bread. The Zelda-esque dungeons never approached the highs of Zelda (or other inspired games). Though I like this in a meta-way; the first Zoldath game was a more serious sci-fi game with difficult and obscure mechanics, and the kid gloves on Pilot Quest feel like what I'd expect from a company beating its IP to death.
* **Mini & Max:** N/A; only went to the chevron room for the metagame.
* **Quibble Race (Cherry #3):** Again, extremely flash-game (and I know it was one), to the extent this would either not sell on the NES or it'd be remembered as one of the system's worst games. I kinda liked it as a game theory experiment in game design, and the fact I would mash buttons despite knowing it doesn't actually do anything to make my quibble race faster was peak ""oh yeah this is why sports gambling is fucking nonsense"".
* **Campanella 3:** N/A
* **Cyber Owls:** N/A",12,1768594885.0,ufo50,2,0.94,False

When my husband’s obsession fed my three–year–old daughter 100 laxative pills, killing her, I didn’t call the police. 

In my last life, I went mad demanding Victoria Sterling pay with her life. 

But Arthur Pendelton just destroyed the surveillance footage and locked me in the basement. 

He looked weary. “Victoria only gave Lily two laxatives. That wouldn’t kill her. Was it really necessary to call the po- lice and stab her?” 

“Victoria is generous; she won’t hold a grudge. Once you get on your knees and apologize, I’ll let you out.” 

But that night, Victoria threw my daughter’s corpse inside. Then she set the fire that burned me alive. 

I opened my eyes. I was back. 

Facing Arthur, who had just destroyed the evidence, I shoved down the pain and forced myself to stay calm. 

Unexpectedly, he handed me divorce papers. 

“I lost another bet to Victoria. The penalty is divorce. I have to go abroad with her for three years.” 

Watching me take the papers numbly, he gave a helpless smile. 

“Victoria’s boyfriend died because of me. It’s my duty to make her happy.” 

“I’ll remarry you when I get back. You and Lily just wait for me at home.” 

That night, holding Victoria’s hand, he rushed to the airport. 

I buried my daughter, signed the papers, and finalized the divorce. 

When he finally returned, his bet fulfilled, he begged me to remarry him. 

He had no idea I had long since married someone else. 

To move my daughter’s grave to Harbor City, I tagged along on my husband’s business trip to the mainland. 

But just after parting with my husband and returning to my former home, I saw Arthur walk in with his arm around Victoria’s waist. 

Upon seeing me, a smile spread across Arthur’s face, and he said smugly: 

“I was right, wasn’t I? Three years later, Emily Carter is still obediently waiting for me at home.”

open arms. 

“Wifey, did you miss me?” 

I shoved him away hard before he could touch me. 

“We’re divorced. Keep your distance.” 

Arthur froze for a second, then laughed even harder. 

“Alright, wifey. I get it. You’re still mad about the divorce.” 

“But didn’t I lose a bet? 

We’ll go remarry tomorrow.” 

Victoria rolled her eyes at him and scoffed coldly: 

“You haven’t been back for three years since the divorce. Maybe she couldn’t stand the loneliness and remarried long ago.”

“Impossible. The house is clean, and the furnishings are exactly the same as three years ago.” 

“She and Lily must be looking forward to my return.” 

Hearing him mention my daughter, my fingernails dug deep into my palms.

Back when we lived together, Arthur insisted on having seafood porridge every day.
