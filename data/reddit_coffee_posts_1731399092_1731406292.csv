https://preview.redd.it/3ahks7cf3g0e1.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=029afb4405753cce0d5b528f00782ae663abbe3c

Having a reliable coffee and tea vending machine in the office can make a world of difference to both productivity and morale. Today’s office environments thrive on collaboration, innovation, and efficiency—and that goes hand-in-hand with good-quality coffee and tea at the push of a button. From two-lane and four-lane coffee machines to specialised tea maker machines, let’s dive into the best options, benefits, and essential tips for choosing a vending machine for your workplace.

# 1. Why Invest in an Office Coffee and Tea Vending Machine?

A [coffee and tea vending machine](https://cafedesireonline.com/products/led-coffee-machine-2-lane) is more than just a beverage dispenser. It’s an essential part of workplace culture. Research consistently shows that coffee breaks improve social bonds and productivity, allowing employees to recharge and return to work with renewed focus. Similarly, tea, a staple in many cultures, provides calming effects, antioxidants, and even cognitive benefits. By offering both coffee and tea through a dedicated machine, you cater to diverse preferences, ensuring every team member feels included and valued.

2. **Understanding the Types of Coffee and Tea Vending Machines**

There’s no one-size-fits-all solution. Here’s a breakdown of the primary types of machines suited for different office needs:

# a) Two-Lane Coffee Machine

A **two-lane coffee machine** is perfect for smaller offices or departments with limited space but still want variety. These machines typically offer two options (e.g., coffee and tea or regular and decaf) and are known for their compact size, easy maintenance, and quick serving speeds.

# b) Four-Lane Coffee Machine

Ideal for larger offices, a **four-lane coffee machine** offers more choices and can handle higher demand. With four lanes, you can stock a mix of beverages, such as regular coffee, decaf, green tea, and hot chocolate. This machine is designed to accommodate a greater volume of users, making it a cost-effective solution for a busy office environment.

 

# c) Specialised Tea Maker Machine

If your team is tea-focused, consider investing in a dedicated **tea maker machine**. These machines are optimised to brew tea at the correct temperature, which is especially beneficial for herbal or green tea enthusiasts. Tea maker machines ensure that each cup is brewed to perfection, preserving delicate flavours and aromas.

# d) Combination Coffee and Tea Machines

Combination machines provide both coffee and tea options in a single unit, ideal for offices with mixed preferences. With easy switching between beverages, these machines are versatile and efficient, offering convenience for a variety of users.

3. **Premixes for Coffee and Tea Machines: The Secret to Great Taste**

The quality of the beverages depends significantly on the **coffee premix** and **tea premix** used. Premixes are specially blended powders or granules that dissolve quickly and are designed for *vending machine* use, ensuring a consistent flavour and experience with every cup. Here’s a look at the benefits of using premixes in office machines:

* **Convenience**: Premixes are simple to use, reducing wait times and maintenance efforts. Simply load the premix, and the machine handles the rest.
* **Consistent Quality**: Each cup brewed will have the same flavour profile, which is ideal for offices looking to provide a reliable taste experience.
* **Variety of Flavours**: With coffee and tea premix options like vanilla coffee, masala chai, or green tea, you can offer more flavours without requiring separate machines for each type.

4. **Key Considerations for Choosing a Vending Machine for Your Office**

Selecting the right [coffee and tea vending machine](https://wa.me/919000061547) requires careful thought. Here are a few factors to keep in mind:

* **Number of Users**: For smaller teams, a two-lane machine may suffice. Larger teams would benefit from a four-lane coffee machine capable of handling high volumes efficiently.
* **Drink Variety**: Do you need a machine that serves a variety of drinks? If your team has diverse preferences, opt for a machine with multiple lanes or a combination coffee and tea machine.
* **Maintenance Needs**: Look for machines that are easy to clean and maintain. Most modern machines have features designed to simplify cleaning, but it’s always wise to check maintenance requirements before making a purchase.
* **Cost Efficiency**: Premixes reduce costs by eliminating the need for individual coffee pods or tea bags. Additionally, combination machines and multi-lane options allow you to cater to everyone’s tastes without the expense of multiple devices.

5. **Benefits of a Well-Stocked Coffee and Tea Station in the Office**

Providing employees with easy access to hot beverages is an affordable and effective way to boost satisfaction and productivity. Here are just a few benefits:

* **Increased Productivity**: Quick access to coffee and tea ensures that employees can take short breaks to recharge without leaving the office.
* **Improved Morale**: A well-stocked coffee and tea machine shows employees that the company values their comfort and wellbeing, which boosts morale.
* **Cost Savings**: Having a vending machine in-house is far more cost-effective in the long run than relying on takeaway coffees or arranging regular coffee runs.

6. **Top Coffee and Tea Vending Machines for 2024**

To make your choice easier, here are a few top-rated machines on the market, perfect for office use:

* **Xpress 4-Lane Coffee Machine**: A reliable and durable option with a variety of choices for coffee lovers.
* **BrewSmart 2-Lane Coffee Machine**: Compact and efficient, this machine is ideal for smaller teams.
* **PureLeaf Tea Maker Machine**: Specially designed for tea lovers, this machine brews at ideal temperatures for maximum flavour. 
* **Final Thoughts: Enhancing Office Culture with Coffee and Tea Machines**
* Investing in a coffee and tea vending machine is a small yet impactful way to enhance workplace culture. From **two-lane coffee machines** for smaller spaces to **four-lane coffee machines** for bustling offices, you can find the right fit based on your team’s size and beverage preferences. Additionally, using quality coffee and tea premixes will ensure a consistent, enjoyable experience.A coffee and tea vending machine doesn’t just serve drinks; it fosters connection, relaxation, and a more engaged workforce.

Good morning Puerto Morelos! Today's weather forecast calls for a mix of sun and scattered showers. As you start your day, you might want to grab your umbrella before heading out the door to shield yourself from the light rain that is expected. Remember to dress comfortably and keep those rain boots handy to navigate any puddles you may encounter on your way to work or school.

Despite the rain, take advantage of the cooler temperatures today to enjoy a nice cup of coffee or hot chocolate as you watch the droplets dance outside. The rain can be quite soothing and calming, so don't let it dampen your spirits - embrace it as nature's way of refreshing the earth!

As the day progresses, the rain is expected to lighten up, allowing for some sunny breaks in between. So, if you have any outdoor plans, don't cancel them just yet! Keep an eye on the skies and be prepared for some sunshine to peak through the clouds. Remember, a little rain never hurt anybody - it just adds to the tropical charm of Puerto Morelos!

Stay dry, stay safe, and don't forget to appreciate the beauty that the rain brings to our vibrant town. Have a wonderful day, no matter what the weather may bring! 🌴🌧️ #PuertoMorelos #RainyDayFun",1,1731405648.0,PuertoMorelos,0,1.0,False

Thank you for accepting my invite to go out when you could be resting in your condo. Don't feel guilty that you arrived late because you're already doing me a huge favor for showing up. Besides, you missed seeing me, right? /hj

Here you are again with your random touches when we're at the coffee shop. The way you grabbed my hand, touched my knee, and gave me a slight hug drives me crazy. You're probably doing these unconsciously since I feel like that's how comfortable you are around me. And I love that. 

We talked about so many stuff the whole day. Don't be conscious for running out of stories to tell me because your presence is already enough for me. You told it to me before and now I realized that I can also say the same to you. 

You know, every time we meet, the void present when we stopped talking few years ago gets filled. On each day that passes, I'm feeling the healing of the past.

I'm so happy that I made the move and did this. Oh, the things people do to the person they want. I'm so happy that I decided to reconnect with you this year. And I'm so grateful that you accepted me because you really could've chosen to cut ties with me after what I did. Now I feel like we became closer than when we were in a situationship in high school.

I reflected on my progress this morning and it hit me. I realized that the things I do to you (going out, having conversations, chatting daily, giving gifts, and physical affection) are already forms of courtship. I just noticed that I'm already courting you. Now you may notice it or not, I'll continue doing so until the time comes to confess to you.

I love how unique our story is. We're breaking stereotypes over the way I'm the one making the move instead of a guy. I really hope my efforts are worth it. I hope we can start the relationship we almost started before. I hope we can go back to each other.",1,1731405624.0,UnsentLetters,1,0.67,False

Now that his belly was filled, Zachary took out his wallet and looked through it, but he did not have much cash on him. In the end, he pulled out a debit card and put it in front of Serenity. 

With a raised brow, Serenity looked at him. 

“You need money to buy things. This card is for you. The PIN is…” 

Zachary looked for a pen and paper and wrote the PIN down before handing it to Serenity. 

“You can use the card for household expenses. I’ll transfer the money into the account every month when my wages are in, but you need to keep track of whatever you buy. I don’t mind you spending the money, but I need to know what it’s spent on.” 

Back when they got the marriage license, Serenity had asked him whether they should go halves on the expenses, to which Zachary shot down. Since they were a married couple, they were family. He did not mind giving her money. 

Zachary had more money than he could count and could not put a figure to his assets. He barely had time to spend the money as he was often busy at work. At least, his wife could now help him use some of it. 

Nevertheless, it did not mean that Zachary wanted to be taken advantage of. He had to watch out as Serenity was a scheming girl in his eyes. 

He had no problems with Serenity squandering the money on the house. 

Serenity could not stand Zachary’s attitude and conduct. 

She slid the debit card, alongside the paper with the PIN, back to Zachary. She did not even spare a glance at the PIN. 

“Mr. York, you’re not the only one in the house. I’m living here too. You bought the house, so I save on rent by living here. I can’t let you pay for the house expenditure too. I’ll pay for whatever’s needed for the house.

“I’ll discuss with you if the cost of a household item exceeds two thousand bucks. You can chip in whatever amount you see fit.”

Her income was high enough to cover the daily household expenses. There was no need for him to pay unless it was a huge purchase. 

It was not that she could not accept his money, but his attitude rubbed her the wrong way. He made it seem like she was after his money and even told her to keep track of the purchases. Her bookkeeping was only for the shop’s expenditure and not extended to her life. 

Zachary was not an idiot. On the contrary, he was very smart. From the refusal, Zachary caught on that his attitude hurt Serenity’s pride. He fell silent for a moment before pushing the debit card and PIN-written paper toward Serenity. Softening his tone, he said, “I know you own a shop, but how much can you make? You said it yourself that this is our home. You’re part of it and so am I. How can I let you shoulder all the household expenses? Take it. Don’t keep a record of your purchase if you don’t want to.

“Have you given a thought about getting a car? Do you need my help to pay the initial deposit? You can afford the monthly commitment with your income.” 

Zachary did not really look into her earnings, but she must be doing well since she started a bookshop at the entrance of Wiltspoon School. Surely, she made quite a bit. At this age, it was the easiest to get women and children to open their wallets. 

“The house is not too far from my shop. I can take my bike. The traffic in Wiltspoon is horrible during rush hour. My two-wheeled ride is better than a four-wheeled motor.” 

Zachary was lost for words. 

She was right. 

He avoided the rush hour to get to work. 

Sometimes, he was caught in the morning rush hour when he had to leave for an emergency. The gridlock traffic would make him wish he took his private jet out instead. 

“It would make your life easier with a car. You can drive on the weekends and take your sister and nephew for a short trip.” 

Zachary remembered Nana saying that the woman lived together with her sister. The people who mattered most in Serenity’s life were her sister and nephew. 

“Maybe later. We just got married, and we don’t know each other well. I don’t feel comfortable using your money to buy a car. I have enough savings to get a car, but a house is a better investment. I can have a home with a house. I’m not like you men. Men prefer getting cars.” 

There was a preferential difference between men and women; women would usually pick a house while men were after cars. 

“Oh, yeah. My sister wants to meet you, but I told her that you’re away on business. I’ll take you to see her at a later date.” 

“Sure,” Zachary answered. 

After the chat, Serenity went to air the clothes while Zachary sat in the living room. He wanted to read the papers, but he did not have a subscription delivered to this place. Since he could not find the newspaper, he turned to check the news on his phone to kill time. 

“Have you done your laundry?” 

Having hung her laundry out in the sun, Serenity threw a question to the man on his phone. 

“I got it covered.” 

His clothes were normally sent to the dry cleaners. 

Serenity pursed her lips without saying a word more. She went about her business. 

She swept, mopped, and tidied up the place. 

Zachary watched as she shuttled back and forth in the house, doing a maid’s job. Furrowing his brows, he was tempted to say something but held his tongue after much thought.

The maids were on top of house chores at his home, but the wife was the one responsible for housework in the everyday family. 

It was a good thing his butler arranged for the maids to clean before they moved in. The house was spotless. Serenity swept around without finding a speck of dust. 

Now that she was done with the daily tasks, Serenity returned to her room and cleaned herself up. With a handbag in hand, Serenity walked out of the room and told the man on the sofa, “Mr. York, I’m going to my sister’s place and then to the shop. Around what time will you be home? You can leave me a message, so I’ll leave the door unlocked.” 

“I’ll come back every night unless I’m away on business. I’ll let you know beforehand if I need to go away.” 

“Alright,” Serenity replied. 

“Se-Serenity, take the card.” 

Holding the bank card, Zachary got up and approached Serenity. He handed the debit card to her and apologized. “I should’ve watched my tone just now. I apologize. I’m sorry!” 

Serenity studied his face for a while, finally accepting the card as he appeared genuine this time. She stuffed the card, alongside the paper with the PIN, into her pocket. 

“I should get going.” 

“Sure.” 

Zachary stood there as he watched Serenity leave.

Once the door was shut, he let out a sigh of relief. 

He did not seem to do a good job assuming the role of a husband. 

Returning to his seat on the sofa, Zachary grabbed his phone from the coffee table and called the butler in the family home. With the butler picking up, he uttered in a low voice, “Sam, when the old Mrs. is up, tell her to gather the family to have dinner at Brynfield. The old Mrs. will know what it’s about.”

","I am asking in good faith because I am am curious. I genuinely want to understand.

I am 27 (F) and I didn't have a fun 20s. it has largely been about studies and more studies and going out very rarely with friends. Partly this was due to my own mental health in early 20s when I was still figuring my career and partly because the friends I have are not into really going out. They have always liked staying home, sometimes their pocket didn't allow, sometimes plans didn't align but in all of my 20s, I may have gone to a few parties and two trips with friends. Now I am 27, and have finally developed the approach of let me initiate plans if my friends won't but now many of my friends are sorting out their careers and so again I have no one to go out with. Yes, I have gone out alone too but I don't know why, I have always wanted to have a nice friend circle and party and travel together, something that I have not been able to have. So it's been a sore spot while growing up.

Now, I see my brother, he is 23, doing masters abroad and he is having a blast with his friends, he has a big circle, he goes out literally every night with them and has trips almost every weekend, He is in Europe so its easier. This is like scratching my sore spot, seeing someone so in my face and close having the life that I have wanted and I love my brother but it makes me feel sad.

I have started feeling as if my life has no fun, I might be trying and going out alone for coffee and stuff and I'll come to know that my brother is scuba diving in some foreign country and that coffee solo date that I was feeling fine about feels like a loser thing to do. I can't help but feel like time is slipping by and that I haven't been able to live it up and won't be able to since my friends are still nowhere close to wanting to travel and party since they have other stuff going on. Sometimes it also makes me feel that soon the entire marriage, children thing will start since I am approaching 30 and I will never be able to have the wild 20s that I wanted.

Otherswise my life is really good with nice parents, stable job etc and so I sometimes feel like an asshole for feeling this way. But what do I do? I just feel like I missed out and am missing out and my life is dull.

a. The coffee powder particle with a flat shape;

b. The particle size distribution is more consistent compared to a conical burr grinder;

Both a and b result in a looser coffee powder layer structure.



**Even extraction with a flat burr hand grinder**

Because the coffee powder has a more consistent particle size, it's easier to achieve uniform extraction compared to a conical burr grinder.



**Extraction rate with a flat burr hand grinder**

Because the coffee powder layer is more loosely structured, the extraction rate is lower in the short term compared to a conical burr grinder.

Since the coffee particles are flat, water gets into the center more easily, leading to a higher extraction rate over time compared to a conical burr grinder.



**Next time**

I'll talk about some key things to keep in mind when using CafeSing ORCA go Flat Burr Hand Grinder to make black coffee and white coffee. Feel free to ask if you have any questions!

1gpgxw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/1gpgxw5/response_to_mba_is_a_scam/,Response to “MBA is a Scam”,"The previous post on why the MBA is a “scam” was focused on why the GMAT and application process is a scam. 

For context, I come from a country where I earn  $15k annually as a B4 senior consultant. 

Name me another test other than the GMAT/GRE where all I have to do is study at home, pay $400~ for the exam and prep material, and have the chance to get up to $150k in scholarships and a chance at a $150k salary post-MBA. 

The CFA is tougher (I passed Level 2), and doesn’t open doors to international jobs as easily as an MBA. 
Same goes for the CPA, PMP, etc. 

Nothing else will get me the same value for a $400 investment (other than investing in Bitcoin a decade ago). 

All I did was sit at home and study, risked $400 and was able to secure a full ride + allowance from a T25 school. The total value of my offer would’ve taken me over a decade of saving 100% of my pre-tax salary to afford. 

The application aspect of the MBA is probably the easiest part of the MBA experience. You’re doing desktop research, networking with current students and writing essays from the comfort of your home. 

Data Insights and CR are critical skills you need for consulting (coming from a B4 & T2 consultant). Interviewing, coffee chats and case prep will be infinitely harder than anything else in the application process. 

If anyone is feeling disheartened about the GMAT or application process, please see how the opportunity from the GMAT and an MBA is truly a blessing where you can potentially earn a life changing opportunity all from the comfort of your home, especially as an international like me where the lowest tier of post-MBA jobs would still grant me more savings than a role from McKinsey in my home country.

1gpgxtg,https://i.redd.it/v4s0c2r1wf0e1.png,Dissecting Future lyrics [Part 1],"Nayvadius Wilburn, better known as Future, often expresses himself with a unique prowess and an unparalleled harmony. This particular line in his verse has profoundly impacted my imagination.

Consider the term ""Dog Food."" Typically, we think of it as what we feed our canine companions. But let's delve deeper. Imagine it's 7:30 in the morning. You brush your teeth, handle your morning routine, and head to the kitchen for a cup of coffee. It's also time to feed your adorable puppy. You grab the bag of dog food, and your puppy eagerly runs to you from the other side of the house.

Now, what if I told you that the bag of dog food wasn't dog food at all, but a bag of heroin? And what if I told you that your puppy wasn't a puppy, but a dope fiend?

""Pain."" What is pain? We often define it as physical discomfort, ranging from mild to severe, usually caused by injury, illness, or a nerve condition. However, pain is also an emotional state. We can inflict emotional pain on ourselves and others through our actions. In this context, ""pain"" refers to fentanyl.

How do these two words create a compelling mental image?

When a dope fiend hears that their plug has reupped, they come running. The heroin is often laced with fentanyl to increase the plug's profits. The dope fiends are aware of this possibility but are driven by their need for a fix.

There is a high risk that one or more dope fiends may die from this, but this is seen as a positive by some. If a dope fiend hears that someone has died from a particular plug's batch, they might be more inclined to buy from that specific plug, believing it to be potent. Word spreads about an overdose, and the local dope fiends do their zombie walk to the plug's house.

""Pain"" here signifies much more than fentanyl. It embodies the sadness, grief, and sorrow that fentanyl brings to our communities.",1,1731403672.0,future,0,1.0,False
1gpgx5m,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/1gpgx5m/blood_sugar_wont_go_down/,Blood sugar won't go down,"Was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes little over a year ago and put on Jardiance. My a1c was 10.5 at the time, and as of 4 months ago during my last blood panel was around 7.7. My doctor recommended I use a glucose monitor, which I am now.

On this journey I found it feel absolutely terrible if I'm below 130. I've gotten as low as 70 and felt extremely ill. I've also noticed that I'm often in the low 100s when I wake up which has gotten me in the situation I'm in now. I didn't check things for a few days. I felt OK other than allergies, so I never thought to.

 I had an iced coffee which I think was like 90g og sugar, 4 oreos, and a couple pieces of fried drumsticks around 4pm. 

Later around 7pm I had a few Clubhouse crackers with turkey, pepper jack cheese, and pepperoni and felt really sick afterwards. Not uncommon anymore unfortunately but I didn't get better. 9pm I checked my blood and I was just shy of 300. I checked again an hour later and didn't move. Its now 4am, I got a couple hours of sleep, and I'm still 280. The monitor also says ""keytones? High"" (including the ? )  

I drink a ton of water, and although I drank less than I normally would yesterday, I still had probably half a gallon if not more. My pee is clear and has a slight popcorny smell to it which is consistent with how it is if I ever hold it for more then a couple hours. 

I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be worried or not. I've never had insulin or anything and my doctor never really explained things. I was told only that I should be trying to consistently keep those numbers low and it'll shoot up at least 100 after eating. I've tried to google it and it says 300 is bad. Ketones can be bad but not very descriptive if I should be worried right now. 

I already deal with chronic fatigue and a lot of muscle weakness which are symptoms that were on the warning list. Unfortunately I don't know if I would tell if it's gotten worse or not.

I don't know what to do, why does it always happens whenever I have a male friend? I (21F) am best friends with Jay (21M, fictional name), we know each other since we were 14 and her always knew I was a lesbian. We didn't hang out much until we turned 18, which was when our friend group kinda grew shorter so we got to know each other better.

Our friend group now is just me, him and another mutual friend. The others either messed up big time (one of our friends made this mutual friend be punched because others thought he was encouraging him to cheat, other friend was outed as a racist and another one was Jay's girlfriend, which suddently broke up with him and I never got the chance to know why). We grew apart from these people and many others so now it's just the 3 of us. Our mutual friend doesn't has much time in his hand, he works a lot so usually just me and Jay hang out or play games together.

Jay had a hard time after his beakup with his ex and I was there to help him. He did the same when I broke up with my abusive ex. He has a habit of self harming, which I'm trying to help him with since I was there once too. He's gotten better, about 2 months without self harming and then I found a cut on his arm yesterday when we went to the gym.

I didn't asked him immediately because there was a lot of people around so I waited until the end of our workout and confronted him. He told me his dog scratched him and I immediately said it was a lie, I know exactly how self harm cuts looks like and I knew those were SH. He got defensive and said he didn't cut himself, I pressed more and he finally said he did.

We walked to his house in silence. I was thinking and trying to process why he would start self harming again, if it was just the usual relapse or if something else happened and I missed it. We got to his home and I asked if he wanted to talk about it, he said he did but later. So a few hours passed and I asked him again if he wanted to talk about it. He said he just did it because he felt like it. At this point I got angry at him because I hate when he lies to me, we promised to always be truthful to each other and he broke that promise way too many times.

I asked him where the blades were and I'd take them home because he couldn't be trusted around them. He has a collection of knives and used them to self harm in the past. I was walking to the closet he keeps them and he pulled me back hard enough to fall and became defensive about the closet. I asked what was inside and why he pulled me back so hard. He said he was embarrassed because his boxer briefs were inside. Another fucking lie, I've seen his boxer briefs plenty of times before when his washing machine was having problems.

I really didn't wanted to lose my cool but the more he lies the anger I get. I pulled him back by the shirt and tried to open the closet. He immediately was able to close it but I could see a glimpse of a printed version of my profile photo. I was a bit shocked and didn't confront him about it, just asked him to give me the damn blades and we'd talk about it later. He relented and gave them to me. Why would he have a photo of me printed inside his closet? He did this with his ex's photos before and also with the other girl he liked. 

He has been awfully nice to me lately, he's bought me chocolates, gave me drawings of characters I like, bought me the specific brand of coffee I liked and he keeps saying he'll buy more gifts to me if he can. He did this with every girl he liked. He wasn't like this about a month ago, we were normal, we usually didn't even give gifts to each other on our birthdays. He sent me a text some hours ago saying ""I'm sorry, I wasn't expecting you'd find out about it today, I'm not ready to tell you yet"" and this has made me paranoid.

Am I crazy or is he in love with me? I can't lose another friend like this man... I'm so tired of making friendships with guys and then having to reject them and feel guilty for ruining our friendship.

I’m starting day 2 today and feeling MUCH less fatigued than yesterday. I actually feel better overall. I plan to continue fasting tomorrow, but I might incorporate some fruits to see how my body reacts.

I found some actual science on this.

Obvious caveat up front that subjective experiences vary and you're free to do what you want and feels best to you, I just wanted to know what it's actually doing in terms of interactions and wanted to share my findings.

Study on coffee and its effect on drug pharmacokinetics:
[ https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7397437/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7397437/)

Study identifying significant CYP2D6 inhibition by caffeine: [https://iubmb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bab.2325](https://iubmb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bab.2325)

The TLDR is that coffee/caffeine is an inhibitor of the CYP2D6 enzyme that's a primary metaboliser of lisdexamfetamine. This is the same enzyme that has a lot of genetic variability for people and one of the main causes of why some people are slow or ultrarapid metabolisers, and why some folks can only tolerate tiny doses that seem to last a really long time, and others feel like they burn through their meds in hours even on maxed out dosage. It also affects a lot of other medications.

Inhibition of CYP2D6 makes lisdexamfetamine hit harder and last longer. This means drinking coffee with your medication can increase its potency quite significantly depending on your individual CYP2D6 baseline and sensitivity to the drug, and alter your response to the medication.

In my personal experience testing this out as a coffee drinker, I get the best results with my medication if I delay my coffee intake by 40-60 minutes after taking Vyvanse, preferably longer but a habit's a habit and it gets my day going. It seems that at least for me that this timing lets my body absorb and process the meds without interference, and I feel that my meds are working ""correctly"" this way, and taking coffee too close to my meds makes me feel like a zombie.

Why this is not mentioned on the pamphlet is anyone's guess, feels like it's a big piece of info to omit with how many of us self medicate with coffee.

Do what you will with that information, I just like having actual scientific backing on this and wanted to share :)",6,1731403184.0,VyvanseADHD,4,0.88,False

If you wanna cut down on tobacco used in spliffs, I can highly recommend replacing it with herbs.   
I used to smoke with tobacco -  but then I tried an herb mix at a coffee shop in Amsterdam. There aren’t many brands available, and they’re all pretty expensive, so I tried the best-rated one I could find, but ended up making my own blend. I can totally recommend that—it’s much smoother. If you try smoking with tobacco again after a few weeks, you’ll notice how harsh it is on your throat. The herb mix is really smooth, burns slower than tobacco, and lasts longer.",3,1731402938.0,stopsmoking,1,0.8,False

a. The coffee powder particle with a flat shape;

b. The particle size distribution is more consistent compared to a conical burr grinder;

Both a and b result in a looser coffee powder layer structure.

**Even extraction with a flat burr hand grinder**

Because the coffee powder has a more consistent particle size, it's easier to achieve uniform extraction compared to a conical burr grinder.

**Extraction rate with a flat burr hand grinder**

Because the coffee powder layer is more loosely structured, the extraction rate is lower in the short term compared to a conical burr grinder.

Since the coffee particles are flat, water gets into the center more easily, leading to a higher extraction rate over time compared to a conical burr grinder.

**Next time**

I'll talk about some key things to keep in mind when using CafeSing ORCA go Flat Burr Hand Grinder to make black coffee and white coffee. Feel free to ask if you have any questions!

Well, free a moment, and have fun!

I just wanted to share a quick tip for anyone looking to make a little extra cash on the side without spending hours doing it. I’ve been using this app called **Zap Surveys** and managed to earn **$7.12 in just 5 days**, only putting in about **20 minutes each day**. 🚀

**Why I’m recommending it**:

* **$2 welcome bonus** right when you join—super easy to get started!
* Plenty of **bonuses** to unlock as you complete more surveys.
* If you keep up a daily streak, you can earn even more! They give out **cash bonuses** just for keeping up with surveys, which adds up.

I know some survey apps don’t pay much, but Zap Surveys seems different because they reward consistency and offer extra cash incentives. It’s been pretty chill, and the time commitment is low. I usually do it while having my morning coffee or during a break.

If you’re interested, here’s the link I used to sign up: [https://bdr3.app.link/yNYM9SKtmOb](https://bdr3.app.link/yNYM9SKtmOb)

https://preview.redd.it/sa4icsh6sf0e1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=396dc7810b9ed11fb984a51400b543a1fd70af86

The jerseys are made from a lightweight, breathable fabric that’s perfect for layering. I love how the mesh design adds a sporty touch, but it’s also cool enough for warmer days. What really stands out is the balance between the classic athletic look and how easy it is to style them in a more streetwear-inspired outfit.

**How I Style Them:**

I usually pair the jerseys with high-waisted jeans or cargo pants for a relaxed but trendy vibe. The oversized fit of the jerseys is perfect for a laid-back, “effortless” look that’s still fashionable.

For shoes, I opt for sneakers or chunky boots, depending on the overall vibe I’m going for that day. It’s a great way to elevate the jersey’s sporty feel without looking like I’m heading to a game.

Accessories like caps, gold chains, or a casual crossbody bag complete the look and add a bit of extra flair.

The jerseys are well-made, and I’ve gotten so many compliments! They’re bold enough to make a statement but still subtle enough to wear for everyday activities like hanging out with friends, grabbing coffee, or even a casual dinner. I also love the variety of team colors and designs available—it’s easy to match them to your personal style.

Overall, if you’re looking to add something fun and sporty to your OOTD rotation, football jerseys are a fantastic choice. They’re comfortable, stylish, and a great way to inject some personality into your daily outfits. Highly recommend!

He even broke up with Alice telling her that they are not good for each other. Alice was sad. He was sending a bouquet of flowers to me every day. I was not ready to forgive him. First he didn't listen to me. 

   Then after eight years he showed up to me. With Alice who he was going to marry. And then he tells me that he loves me and I should forgive him. He will break her heart too. 

   I was not ready to forgive him this time. I also did a terrible thing about lying to him. But he didn't even give me a chance to defend myself. It was late at night. It was raining. 

    It was very dark outside. There was thundering too. I heard Josh's voice from down. I went towards the window and opened it. Josh was standing alone getting wet in the rain. 

   He was apologising to me for his behaviour. I didn't listen to him. I went inside. He said that he will stay here all night. I went towards my bed and slept there. It was morning. 

   I went outside. I saw Josh sleeping in his car. He didn't go home. He was telling the truth. I moved away. I was feeling bad about it. I was going to a pool with Julia, Clara and Becca. I met them outside the pool. 

   We all went inside. It was empty. There was no one except receptionists and staff. I was a bit confused. I said, “Why are there no one here?” Julia said, “I don't know. Maybe no one will come at this time.” 

  But it was weird. It was eleven in the morning. Why will no one come here to swim? I listened to them and changed my clothes and wore a swimsuit. It felt nice to swim here. 

 Julia came out from the pool saying, “I should grab some snacks for us.” She insisted Clara and Becca go with her. I was swimming peacefully. Julia went away. 

   She called Josh. She said, “Plan is working. She is here. Come fast.” Becca said, “Who were you calling?” Clara asked, “What plan?” Julia said, “Ok, listen to me. It was Josh.” 

   Becca asked, “Who Josh?” Julia said, “Lydia’s ex-boyfriend. I am helping him to get back with Lydia.” “Wait. You are helping Josh. Lydia broke up with him. Maybe he wasn't right for her.” 

   Julia says, “No. It was my fault. They broke up because of me. They were very happy with each other. I am helping Josh because it was my fault they broke up.” 

   Josh was on his way to meet me. Time was passing. I was waiting for others. I came out from the pool searching for others. I was searching for them everywhere. 

   I reached another pool which was big. It was a deep one. I thought, “Maybe I should just stay away. It's too deep.” All of a sudden someone pushed me. I fell into the pool. 

    I didn't see the face as I was drowning. I saw a big black hair. It was a woman. I was drowning. I was trying to come up. 

  Suddenly Josh came looking for me. He jumped into the pool to save me. He held my hand. And took me out from the pool. I was shivering. It was very cold. Julia and others came forward looking for me. 

   Clara exclaimed, “What happened here?” Josh said, “Lydia was in the pool. She was drowning and I saved her.” Becca said, “What are you doing here?” I said, “I came here searching for you.” 

    Julia found earrings on the floor. She kept it with her. All of us went towards the exit. Becca said, “Too much swimming for today. Let's go home now.” We all agreed. 

   Julia went towards Josh and said quietly, “This plan has failed. We need a new plan.” Josh said, “Don't worry. I will do the planning. You should take care of Lydia. I drank a hot coffee and went home with Julia. 

Julia was staying with me. “It was a crazy day.” I said, eating hot noodles just like old days. Julia said, “Just forget about it. It was not your fault. It was a deep pool.” 

   I said, “It was not my fault.” Julia looked at me and said, “What do you mean?” “Someone pushed me into the pool. It was a woman with dark and long hair.” Julia was stunned to hear it. 

   Julia took out the earrings from her bag and showed it to me. She said, “I found it on the floor when I found you.” I looked at the earrings. “I think I saw it somewhere.” I said. “Yes, it is Alice's earrings. She wears it.” 

    I was shocked. But why was it on the floor? Was she the one who pushed me? “Forget about it. We need to go to the theatre.” Julia said. I almost forget about it. 

  I was thinking about Josh too much. He saved me from the pool and I haven't even thanked him. He was trying hard to make me fall in love with him again. And it was working. 

   I started to fall for Josh again. I wanted to forgive. I wanted to tell him that I love him and want to live with him. We reached the theatre. We went inside the theatre towards our seats. 

   “Why is no one here?” I asked Julia. The door got closed suddenly. Josh came out of nowhere. I was shocked. He was looking handsome. He was wearing a black shirt and white jeans. 

   He walked towards me. I was shocked. He bent down and said, “Will you forgive me and marry me, Lydia Bennet. I am very shameful for my things. I know that I have hurt you many times. But I promise that I will love you even harder. Please say yes.” He pulled out a ring and held my hand. 

    I gave him my hand saying, “I love you too. I had already forgiven you. And I would be very happy to marry you too.” He put the ring on my hand. It was a diamond ring. We were happy. 

   Julia said, “Told you that you are meant to be together.” We were all happy. Josh and I went on a date after the love confession. Julia went home. The date was good too. He took me in a expensive restaurant.

   Josh told me that he was going to propose to me the morning before the incident but he couldn't. And also Julia was helping him to get me with me. It was a very nice night.

Hi everyone,
I’ve received a job offer in Switzerland and would like to hear your opinions on it. The salary is about 5,000 CHF gross based on a 43.5-hour workweek, with the 13th salary already included in this amount.

Things like holiday compensation, surcharges, and cleaning of work clothes are also included. I’m trained in another field, not directly related to the job.

Additionally, a fee for accommodation and meals will be deducted. I mentioned that I don’t need meals, but I was told that there will still be a charge for water and coffee. The use of the fitness center also comes at an extra cost. The shifts change daily and are scheduled a week in advance, with morning, evening, and “room” hours.

Since it is a seasonal job, I am unsure whether these conditions are fair. Does anyone have experience with similar offers?

Thanks for your input!

1gpgmhd,https://www.reddit.com/r/GayMen/comments/1gpgmhd/youve_got_mail_online_fantasies_versus_reality/,‘You’ve Got Mail’ – Online fantasies versus reality,"I recently watched ‘You’ve Got Mail’ for the first time. (I’m not usually a fan of romantic comedies, but it was on TV and I was bored and curious.)

For those who haven’t seen it, the premise is that two people start chatting in an internet chat room (it was made in 1998) and then continue their conversations via email, over weeks and months. They pour their hearts out to each other – but they never swap names, they never tell each other where they work or what they do for work, and they never meet up. They only know each other by their online handles: ShopGirl and NY152. But they share their thoughts and feelings. They get close. Very close. 

Meanwhile, in real life, ShopGirl (Kathleen) owns a small bookshop, and NY152 (Joe) is the CEO of a chain of bookstores which opens a new store just up the road from her bookshop. So, Kathleen meets Joe, and she takes a dislike to him – he stands for everything she hates. She thinks he’s a bastard, he thinks she’s unreasonable, and they bring out the worst in each other. 

Online, the two penpals have no idea they actually know each other, and they’re getting closer and closer. Finally, one of them suggests that they meet up face to face for coffee. 

At the coffee shop, ShopGirl is waiting, and NY152 sees her when he arrives. NY152/Joe realises that ShopGirl is Kathleen, and he decides not to show up. He leaves. 

However, he changes his mind and does something different. He turns around and walks into the coffee shop as Joe. Joe “bumps into” Kathleen. Kathleen says she’s waiting for someone. Joe says he’ll just sit with her until her friend shows up. 

They talk for a bit, and of course they get into an argument; they bring out the worst in each other. Eventually, Kathleen says to Joe that he’s nothing like her mystery online man: “The man who is coming here tonight is completely unlike you. The man who is coming here tonight is kind and funny, he has the most wonderful sense of humor. … There is not a cruel or careless bone in his body. But I wouldn't expect you to understand anybody like that. You with your theme park, multi-level, homogenize-the-world mochaccino land. … You are nothing but a suit!”

She has no idea that the man she’s saying these things *to* is also the man she’s saying these things *about*. 

And that made me think. (Yes, there is a point to this post.) It made me think about all the posts I see here on Reddit, by some young man (it’s always a *young* man) who is totally in love with some guy he’s been chatting to online. They’ve never met, but he’s convinced this is the real thing. 

I’ve often said to those young men that they’ve only ever seen a filtered version of this guy they’ve been chatting to. They don’t know what he’s really like. 

Also, the young men add their own fantasies to the mix. They read more into the online messages they receive, and imagine that this guy is the wonderful Prince Charming they’ve been dreaming about. 

Meanwhile, in the real world, this guy could be “Nothing but a suit!” He could be a total bastard in real life. But that’s not the side of himself that he presents to strangers online. Of course not. Online, he only presents his good side, not his bad side. 

Be careful when you’re chatting to strangers online. You really don’t know who they are, or what they’re like. You’re only getting a censored version of them.  

(P.S. The romcom ends ridiculously and unrealistically – like all romcoms do. These two people who hate what each other stand for, end up falling in love, because the plot requires it. That’s one reason I’m not really a fan of romcoms. Real life doesn’t work like that.)",2,1731402197.0,GayMen,0,1.0,False

In theory, this is what hopeful traders exclaim when they believe the price of their favorite coin is about to skyrocket. But here’s the funny thing: everyone thinks they’ve mastered the art of predicting this astronomical journey, even when it’s as volatile as your morning coffee after a rough night.

So, what’s behind the “moon” predictions? For starters, there’s excitement (and caffeine), a few dozen forums, and maybe a candle chart or two. [TradingView’s free version](https://www.reddit.com/r/OptionsDayTraders/comments/1gbvh06/tradingview_premium_free_edition_desktop_pc/), for example, gives everyone access to fancy charts and tools to track prices. Suddenly, we’re all daydreaming about being the next “crypto whale” (that's industry-speak for big-time players).

But if we’re honest, even seasoned traders will tell you: predicting crypto markets is like trying to catch smoke with a fishing net. We’re just hoping that the latest charts will make sense of it all. Indicators like RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands are helpful on [TradingView’s platform](https://www.reddit.com/r/OptionsDayTraders/comments/1gbvh06/tradingview_premium_free_edition_desktop_pc/), but let’s face it—the market often has other plans. The thrill is in the chase, not necessarily in catching anything at all.

In the meantime, if you’re still committed to your dream of lunar-level gains, why not give the [free version of TradingView](https://www.reddit.com/r/OptionsDayTraders/comments/1gbvh06/tradingview_premium_free_edition_desktop_pc/) a spin? You can set alerts, track prices, and enjoy all the tools without paying a dime—at least until you’ve “moon-tested” your investment.

1gpg326,https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/1gpg326/very_confused_but_excited/,Very Confused but Excited…?,"Hello, 28 NB here. To be honest I am not super familiar with reddit and how it works so I’ll try to not be too long winded haha 

For the last several years I have been privately identifying as non binary. A few friends are aware but it isn’t something that I have been open about at all unless discussed prior to a date or hookup or something. But the main point of this post is that I am considering beginning low dose HRT and I’m kind of terrified but also excited because my feelings are somewhat mixed/confused.

A bit of a background on me is that I had always identified as cis until I got to college and began experiencing other types of relationships and kinks. I started exploring chastity in my teens and beyond sexual there was something about it that always felt affirming or “right” and so I continued to wear it all the time.

During college, I started viewing my relationship with my best friend and roommate a little differently. At first we were really close buddies (literally spending every minute of the day together in each others rooms, grabbing coffee, staying up watching movies, etc) and I admittedly had a little crush on him. He was straight however, and I was gay so I knew nothing would come of it. But I was very aware how the ladies treated him and the attention he would provide to them and around this time I had begun experimenting very lightly with cross dressing, so part of my brain was like “I wish he could see me that way” which…if I could go back and give my younger self a hug I would.

Needless to say I thought my feelings were more just “I’m gay and have a crush on my best friend” so I let things slide and continued to experiment with gender and distance myself from that relationship. 

Over the next few years I kind of sank down the “sissy hypno rabbit hole” and it would be this affirming fetish and I told myself I was just a dude with a cross dressing fetish, etc. essentially anything to avoid acknowledging the underlying issue.

Things changed finally when I began buying shoes and clothes and cross dressing at home for myself, rather than dress up for a guy. I spent several years learning about non binary people and found a community there and began identifying as such.

Recently, however, I’ve been increasingly confused about my gender. There will be times where I dress up and essentially live my private life in a more feminine way for months and then something inside me becomes embarrassed and I get rid of all my feminine clothing and makeup and tell myself “you’re NB you can still dress like a dude” and this cycle repeats and repeats and every time I am feeling more feminine the cycle gets longer. 2-3 weeks at a time became a month, then 2-3 months, then more than half the year, and I realized I’m living 2 lives and it isn’t helping me.

So I guess that brings me to today whereas a non binary person I am struggling with maybe possibly being trans, and looking into taking HRT (in a low dose capacity to start). I guess I am kind of looking for advice and maybe some insight if anyone has been through this cycle before and how you worked things out. I’m extremely excited to embrace my femininity and stop living as a boy then a girl, and just live as myself, but also somewhat scared that since I’ve been spending so much of my time in a feminine headspace that I might be trans, and given the election and my family I can’t even understand how to navigate that.

I guess I was long winded after all lmao 

TLDR: I am a non binary dude grappling with starting HRT in the near future and am scared confused and excited about what the future holds whether that means staying on low dose HRT or transitioning fully. 

Would love to hear other people’s experiences. ",1,1731399660.0,NonBinary,0,1.0,False

27F, in good health. I never experienced heartburn before.

About a 5 weeks ago, I had an endoscopy for a potential Celiac diagnosis. I was on a GF diet for a year, but had to eat gluten for a few weeks before the biopsy. 

Fast forward a week and I get the results, all negative including a check for gastritis and helicobacter. No worries as I had no symptoms of those anyway. 

Fast forward one more week and I catch a very mild cold, dominated by a sore throat. I take losanges, and nsaids (following instructions + I've had both before) and the pain resolved within a few days. 

Only problem is, I have had severe an unrelenting heartburn since. 

At first I was treating with Tums but within a few days, this was no longer working. I switched to gaviscon and have been taking that every second or third day since. 

It's triggered by everything. Plain oats, plain rice and potatoes, pain chicken breast, hell, even water. 

If I don't eat, I have a heavy, burning pain in my upper stomach. Lke I swallowed hot rocks. 

When I do eat, I experience severe bloating, gas, and heartburn even while sitting, followed by the heavy feeling in my stomach. 

Tonight I've developed chest pain and tightness, but a gaviscon is cooling my angry stomach slightly.

I've cut the trigger foods suggested here out of my diet, coffee, chocolate, citrus, tomatoes etc, but it's getting worse.

I don't know what to do at this point, exactly 1 months ago I got a clean bill of tummy health with an endoscopy...what gives? 

It's worth mentioning that I returned back to my gluten free diet which has made me feel great for the past year. But now, everything triggers HB. 

I have a follow up with my Gastroenterologist in a month for genetic testing for celiac to close that chapter, but now I am suffering from these never before symptoms. 

I don't think I can last another month of this, any insights?",2,1731399554.0,GERD,1,1.0,False

I just have very low tolerance of bullshits and I am very ashamed that I’m not as strong as my colleagues. Growing up, i thought I was obedient, can follow rules and respect seniors. 

Honestly, f em. I just asked someone from legal to join a meeting to review some documents for a project that we both have been doing. He asked if lunch will be provided. Maybe because it’s been a culture in the company I’m working at to provide snacks/lunch/coffee. I was actually flabbergasted so I let a couple hours to pass to do my other task. I then replied, no, and he hinted that (name of the meal) sounds nice. I said, indeed. He said that I’m just playing dumb. Heck yes I was, if I keep following these people I think I will become like them. 

We actually had to work on a document, but he and his team refused to give me a sample or standard of a document so I was so confused on how to draft it. I sent what I could do to him and he complained to my boss that he had to do it from 0. I even checked the draft that he returned to me, he added more clauses (copied from parent conpany’s regulation) and fixed the recitals. In my defense, I did what I could and my boss was the one who told me to just submit it. I think that colleague expected me to do 99% of them because I have legal background too. I work in legal like years ago. Moreover he kept taking my snacks and saying “I like this expensive snacks you have”.

I just had an ""aha"" moment about SaaS that I've got to share. It's not just an industry buzzword; it's the secret sauce behind some of the coolest, life-changing tech we use every day. And it's time we all paid attention.

Think about it. Without SaaS, there's no easy way to collaborate with your team across the world, no simple solution to manage your schedule ...

But here's the kicker. SaaS isn't just for the tech-savvy. It's for everyone. It's for the startup grinding away in a coffee shop, the artist sharing their work with the world, and the student juggling a million things.

And sure, we need to talk about security and costs – because what's the point of cool tech if it's not safe or breaks the bank, right? But let's not get stuck there. The real story is how SaaS is tearing down barriers and opening up possibilities.

So, what's your SaaS story? Are you in, or are you still figuring it out? Drop your thoughts below and let's get real about how SaaS is rewriting the rules.

I once abused the drug GHB for a whole summer.  I've been long term heavy marijuana user in legal state.*

*I had a few bad events in my life that greatly impacted my sleep in more recent years.  I was doing fairly decent until a hammer hit my head causing TBI injury.  I recovered from that fairly well and then wife had an affair that ruined me ever since.*

I've spent thousands of dollars on many types of supplements and medications and treatments and specialists.

I guess I want to write about the time I went 15 days no sleep.  I was taking a thyroid medication that I didn't need any more and I kept taking it and realized eventually to stop.  I progressively felt crappier and crappier and eventually on those later days I had major memory issues and energy problems and was super sluggish.  All it took was stopping the medication.  I read later that world record holder was 15 days.  I've gone many times 2, 3, 4, 5, 10x days no sleep.  I can easily handle a week of no sleep, it doesn't impact me that much anymore.

Other periods of insomnia have been related to intense stress.  My wife had 2 affairs.  We had major property fire where I lost my business.  I did ketamine therapy to get over these two issues and it helped me greatly.

The other thing that improved my health a ton was a nutrionist who identified the mineral imbalances with hair tests, etc.  

What seems to screw up my sleep mega bad nowadays:  techno music shows, alcohol consumption, lack of sunlight, my wife being around, late dinners

  
**Insomnia cures:**

Insomnia cures I have experienced:  hot springs, being in love, prolific sunshine, nano CBD, yoga, iron supplementation, thyroid supplements, no fap, sauna/gym, nice places.

  
No fap as a cure:  I guess as a male you are horny.  If you can resist the urge and hone that energy for long period of time, it tends to lead to lead greater sleep.  I noticed changes within 5 days. 

Sunshine as a cure: I went to florida and spain in last year and in both places I could sleep good and heavy and go back to sleep.

Hot springs as a cure: We live near a hot springs and so used to go there a lot.  This does wonders for sleep.

Iron/thyroid supplements:  Often there was a root cause of insomnia I didn't understand.  This required lots of testing.  Once I figured it out, my body functioned really well for a period of time.  

Nano CBD as cure: There is specific nano CBD that really made me relaxed and helped me sleep.  I resist it because its like $50 a month or more for this stuff.  

Yoga as a cure:  I watch 'yoga for sleep' videos sometimes and these tend to work wonders.  I know I am stiff and so if I do it, it can help mega bigtime.

Sauna/gym as cure: This worked mega well for me for a long period of time but I did it so much it depleted me.  The most recent depletion is sodium depletion from too much activity.  This stuff works intially but if you are on thinner side, you need to be careful about depletion.

Happy places as cure:  I sleep good in places where I am happy to be there.  That is not my house lol.  If I could afford some kind of dream condo or apartment or something, I think it would be great for your mental health and well being.  

Coffee as a cure:  Sometimes it acts as a crash mechanism after 5-7 days insomnia for me and makes me super tired at night.  



**Things that ruin sleep the most:**

Late dinners

Stress

Bright lights

Improper supplement use

Too much sexual activity

Depletion from gym

Coffee consumption  




**Supplement list (things I've done):**

(I tend to do thorne or pure encapsulations brands)

PS-100 (phosphytalsyrine) (Iso-phos):  This stuff was my go to sleep supplement many years.  Naturopath recommends it.  Iso phos is slightly different version of it.  I would rate it 8/10.

5-HTP: This stuff works inconsistent but I think works better than l-tryptophan in general.  I have used it and shelved it many times.  Different brands work differently.  I would rate 7/10

L-tryptophan:  This stuff worked very well for about a year and suddenly stopped working.  I would rate 5/10

Melatonin/Herbatonin: I like the herbal based melatonin and have used it many times.  Doesn't always work of course but I think its healthier than regular melatonin.  I would rate 8/10

Glycine:  This one might work best with l-tryptophan, I need to try combo again.  With certain ones like 5-htp it causes bad anxiety and with others it doesn't do anything.  I pair it with other supplements.  I would rate 9/10.

Gaba:  Lyposomal gaba is best version with l-theanine.  I take another version pharmagaba but its giving me anxiety currently.  Generally safe to take with other supplements.  I would rate 7/10.

Dragonbone + bupleareum tea (capsules): Another naturopath recommendation but I take 5 capsules and it tends to make me sleepy.  You can keep on taking it to induce sleep if it doesn't work.  Take it when you wake up.  I would rate 6/10

Holy Basil tea (drink): This stuff really brings deep relaxation and makes you sleepy.  Only downside to a tea at night is it makes you urinate potentially.  I would rate 8/10

Ashwagandha/turmeric collagen peptides: I make a drink with these two sometimes when I have really bad trouble.  Its major wild card where it either makes you sleepy or wakes you up.  The turmeric collagen is much safer for sleep as its filled with amino acids and black pepper.  I would rate 5/10

Relora:  I really liked this stuff and have taken it consistently for long time.  I realized recently I need to bring it back.  I would rate 7/10

Pregnenolone:  I dabbled in this for awhile and naturopath said it was dangerous one to take so I stopped.  It did work.  I would rate 8/10.

Valerian (complex):  This one has worked wonders at times but it blocks iron which is problem in my situaiton.  I would rate 7/10.

Apigenin:  Part of Andrew Huberman cocktail but this one works pretty similar as glycine and relora and makes you sleepy and works consistent.  I tried black tea derived one and that one worked super good but also blocked iron.  The chamomile one is much safer.  I would rate 8/10.

Magnesium glycinate:  This worked super good long time but nutritionist said I should only take magnesium with calcium or it can cause imbalance.  So was a bad decision I guess long term.  I would rate 8/10.

Sam-E:  I take this in morning and tends to help with sleep at night in general.  If you take with almost anything listed above, it causes serotonin syndrome which is awful.  I would rate 9/10

L-Theanine: Tends to make me relaxed but does not get me to sleep so its something I have shelved.  Tried it again recently and didn't work very well.  I might try with another brand.  I would rate 4/10.

Combo supplement:  I take one called 'best rest formula' and it has cocktail of many of the things I listed above.  It works super good but naturopath doesn't approve of it; I think the melatonin he doesn't like.  I would rate 8/10

Beta Glucan: This is a yeast that you take kind of like probiotic during the day.  Gives you energy and is anti-inflammatory.  I noticed deeper sleep on the days I tried it.  Hope to try it again soon give it another shot.  8/10.



**Medication list:**

I've done most of the tryptates: amytriptaline, trazadone, nortryptaline, etc.  I like amytryptaline and trazadone most.  I didn't understand until 20 years into taking this stuff you need to take it with food to activate.

Ambien, lunesta, sonata etc:  These cannot be take daily so while it did work, eventually it didn't.

Difficulties with medication:  While they work, I basically become deeply reliant on them.  I don't like the sodium depletion and zombie like side effects and lethargy.  If I stop taking them, I cannot sleep for weeks.  I seem to do ok in when I'm on vacation not taking medication.  I would prefer not being on medication for my life if possible.  I've gone periods of 5+ years not taking medication and so have stopped before successfully, but cannot get back to that point again.
