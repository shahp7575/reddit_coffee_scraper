1m8ewfj,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1m8ewfj/lithium_tremors/,Lithium tremors,"Does anyone else taking lithium long term also still have the shakes and tremors? How did you deal with it?

I've been taking 800mg lithium daily for the past 2 years. My blood values have always remained constant at the therapeutic level. But I still have problems with shaking fingers, hands and also at times, unsteady legs. Sometimes it's difficult for me to hold a cup of coffee, type on the keyboard or write a note. Going down a long flight of stairs is also tough, I have to grip onto the hand rail or else my legs give out on me (I am a very fit person though). My kids even joke around about mommy's shaky hands. I've talked about it a lot with my psychiatrist and we could switch it up, but I need to be stable first, I've been going through a recent hypomania turned depressive episode.

I have the two major-based STEM classes I need fall quarter (BIS 102 and STA 100) and my mandatory honors program seminar on my schedule builder, but they only tally up to 10 units, meaning I need two more units to meet my full time minimum.

I need to try and choose an enjoyable elective that will fulfill my unit requirements and still be light enough that I won‚Äôt be piling more on myself when I know it‚Äôll be a stressful time. 

I like dancing for fun so I was considering taking a dance class. The hip hop class I saw on the school website isn‚Äôt offered this quarter unfortunately, but modern dance (DRA 40A, 2 units) is. I‚Äôve never tried modern dance so I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll like it but I feel like I might. It‚Äôs twice a week with nearly two hour classes both days. If there isn‚Äôt much work outside of the class and it‚Äôs mostly just dancing that works fine, but I would love to hear from people who have taken the class how much work there is to it. The class is only open for certain majors during pass one, so if I took it would only be if there‚Äôs spots left during pass two.

When I looked into fun and relatively easy electives, the coffee lab came up multiple times (ECH 1, 3 units) and I was also told about it during multiple tours and on-campus events. During pass one, I plan on adding this to my schedule and then removing it later if I decide/am able to take the dance class instead. I don‚Äôt like coffee much and would be taking it in the evening preferably, so drinking the coffee isn‚Äôt the big draw for me (I heard that most of what we make will taste bad anyways) but it sounds fun! It would be one lab a week with a virtual lecture, with the lab being nearly two hours. The $30 services fee is doable for me. I just don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll enjoy it more or less than the dance class. 

Can anyone who‚Äôs taken one or both of these classes give me some input on what the classes entailed, what the course load was like, how you liked the class, and if you‚Äôve taken both, which one you preferred? Thank you!",1,1753387732.0,UCDavis,0,1.0,False

*Date \[Standardized Human Time\]: March 5th, 2130.*

***Memory transcription subject: Unknown Farsul, Captain of the Third Reconnaissance Fleet of the Shadow Caste.***

A feeling of anxiety, dread, and stress pestered my mind.

It turns out that speaking with one of the main people behind the Federation was surprisingly stress-inducing. Let alone talk about something as hard as the possibility of a second species of predators, *humans*, being alive. Their very own existence, if left unchecked, could easily disrupt the fragile balance of power and control shared by the Federation and the Arxur Dominion that had been so painstakingly built over *centuries*.

There were already signs of said balance being disturbed in the territory of the Venlil Republics. Mainly their Governor, Tyvil, who had a sudden change in behaviour and had apparently *kicked* Sovlin out of their territory.

Combine that with the weird readings in the supposedly 'old' human system, and you have decent amount of proof to justify a sudden shift in priorities in the Shadow Caste. I knew that trusting your instincts could *sometimes* save you a lot of trouble, and for all I knew, the uncanny feeling I got when I saw the images captured by the sensors showed that there was *something* wrong with them, as if they'd been artificially created. Artificial images made by programs, as accurate as they could get, could *never* perfectly replicate real things, and if you knew what to look for, you could easily identify them.

I quickly entered his office, Nikonus was already expecting me, and had already taken the precautions to ensure that *nothing* that would be discussed inside would be known to those that weren't supposed to know about it.

""So, what were your findings?"" He started, showing me a worried expression.

I put the report as well as the data my crew and I had gathered on his table.

""There's definitely something wrong with the Sol system, sir, at first glance, the readings don't show much, but when we were collecting them, I got an uncanny feeling that was strong enough to make me flare out my fur. I did what protocol dictates and took additional readings and images to make sure it wasn't a one-time issue. But the problem didn't go away. I personally believe that what caused my instincts to go off is some kind of forgery.""

He blinked once, then briefly went through the documents and images.

""I think it's safe to say that there's a very high chance of those monsters are still alive, it appears that not even a nuclear war could get rid of them..."" He mumbled.

""Well then,"" He continued, ""I apologize for messing up with your schedule, but I hope that the threat the potential existence of a secondary predator species is enough of a justification.""

""Don't worry about that. We need to do everything we can to keep this fragile balance in place, their existence puts it at a great risk, and regarding that... Do you have plans to deal with Tyvil? He's certainly involved in this scandal.""

""I think I do, perhaps we can still salvage this situation and save the Venlil from the grasp of those foul beasts. If everything else fails, we can try and get the humans to shift their attention to the Arxur and fight them first. But first, I will need to *force* the truth out of him.""

He sighed.

""...You're dismissed, I will take care of the issue from here.""

""One last question, sir.""

He looked at me again before I spoke up again, ""...Do you plan to inform Sovlin that his suspicions were true?""

He looked puzzled at my question, before flicking one of his tentacles in a sign of affirmation.

I excused myself before exiting his room, but even after finishing the hardest part of my shift, the feeling of dread still remained at the back of my mind, I had the impression that getting rid of the humans was bound to be much more difficult than it would initially appear to be...

============================================================

\[Time skip: 2 hours\]

***Memory transcription subject***: ***No one, third person POV.***

*Location: UN Space Forces Command Center, Earth.*

A meeting was about to start, the majority of those attending were military commanders and strategists from all across the world. The United Nations was about to take a major step towards understanding more about the Federation and the threats they posed.

A man suddenly appeared from one of the sides and walked up to the stage, he briefly tapped the microphone that was attached to his shirt, before speaking up.

""Alright, everyone, listen up! This is important and will play a crucial role in how Humanity will fight those xenos!""

A large screen that was behind him lit up, pointing at certain points of a large map that's being shown.

""Hello everyone, my name is Pierre Charbonneau, I'm the one who originally planned this mission, denominated *Operation Void Whisper.*

As you might know, not so long ago, Tyvil, leader of one of potentially only alien friends humanity will have among the stars for some time, provided us with a map of the Federation Space, as well as the location of several of their home worlds.

We will make use of said map to start collecting information on the main worlds of the Federation and its colonies in advance in order to plan on how to properly deal with each one of them if push comes to shove.

The ship model that was chosen for this mission goes by the name of Void Arrows, they are controlled by customizable, autonomous computer programs, not necessarily sapient or conscious, but smart enough to know how to process data and react accordingly, dozens of said vessels will be departing in *exactly* 72 hours, and that takes us to the main point of this meeting.""

Some people briefly mumbled to each other, before getting quiet again. Pierre continued.

""Your job will be to plot a path for each one of the arrows that will be participating in this mission while also taking the defenses and potential level of technology of each of their targets into account. The data given to us by Isif on how the species of Federation patrol each of their territories will also be included, the Void Arrows will most definitely encounter patrol fleets near them.""

He made a hand gesture and the screen changed, now showing a model of the ships that would be doing the reconnaissance mission, as well as their capabilities and general information.

""The Void Arrows are shaped to minimize their radar signature, although each one of them is the size of a small bus, they have a radar signature the size of a bee, their color also further minimizes the chance of them being detected by cameras, since they barely reflect any light at all. But there's a catch.

Remember this, and I cannot stress it enough, these vessels, specifically, *DO NOT* have ***ANY*** weapons on them, their only means of defense are their advanced stealth capabilities, impressive agility and acceleration, they can also temporarily match their temperature with that of background space, you *cannot* forget about that part, their hyperspace drives will also shorten that time by a great amount if they get activated during that period.

And after said period passes, the vessels will take some time to cool the heat sinks enough to reactivate that stealth capability again, during which their infrared signatures will increase significantly, as big and efficient as their [graphene radiators](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/about/news/graphene-in-space-a-new-milestone-for-smartir-and-graphene-commercialisation/#:~:text=The%20graphene%20adaptive%20radiator%20has,the%20harsh%20environment%20of%20space) are, they cannot fully prevent themselves from showing up on sufficiently sensitive sensors, which we must assume that the Federation has access to, given that they tried to spy on us from *outside* the Solar System, the capabilities of the ships will be in the documents you will receive soon.

And talking about sensors, the ones the Arrows have are sensitive enough to be able to reliably take 1080p pictures from planets from up to 4 light-hours away, their radio and infrared sensors can reliably collect information from up to 10 light hours away.

After the probes exit hyperspace, they will have exactly *3 hours* to collect as much information and data as possible before they need to warp out to avoid detection, and it will be up to you to plot out a course for them to be able to conduct this mission out and make as much use of those 3 hours as possible.""

After another hand gesture, the screen changed one last time, showing an extensive description of the autonomous programs that equipped said vessels, as well as how they operated.

""You tell the programs aboard these ships what to do, and they will carry out the task to the best of their capabilities as they can without breaching the *parameters* set by *you*. So be careful on how you will get said programs to work efficiently inside the limitations of the vessels they've been installed on. We will do one final meeting before they get launched in order to go over the plans plotted out by each one of you and debate on how to improve them, said meeting will happen in exactly 36 hours. *DO NOT* miss said meeting. Am I clear?""

A wave of nods and ""Yes sir"" briefly spread across the crowd.

""Alright, then let's get to work, the clock's ticking, dismissed!""

============================================================

\[Time skip: 5 hours\]

***Memory Transcription Subject***: ***Governor Tyvil of the Venlil Republics.***

""They did what?!"" I yelled.

I had *just* started my shift when I got a call from Nikolai, and apparently, *someone* tried to spy on Sol, which showed that *maybe* the storm of consequences related to the previous incident wasn't all over.

""Did your military manage to get rid of them?"" I asked somewhat anxiously, if the humans had actually *destroyed* said vessel, justifying our actions would be a whole lot easier, if they didn't...""

""Our computer department hacked into their computer systems and altered their readings, everything should be alright."" Nikolai reassured me through the video call.

""Are you sure?""

He nodded while smiling slightly, ""Yep, pretty sure, the information the Arxur gave us on how the computers used by the Federation was enough to allow the development of a virus to get into their vessels.""

*That seems to be enough, well th- wait... did he say Arxur?*

""...Did you say Arxur?"" I pondered.

""...Yea?""

The wool along my spine flared up during the few moments I lost my composure.

""...May I know *why* you humans are involving yourselves with those *predators*?!"" I yelled again, the idea that the humans were negotiating with our biggest enemies behind our backs was *ludicrous.*

""Erm, well, you see, we had to intercept an Arxur fleet a few *weeks* ago, and, erm, Joseph exchanged some words with them, that's all!""

""You're lying, aren't you?"" I accused, which immediately caused him to stiffen.

""E-excuse me?""

I was no fool, I had done my homework regarding human body language, and I knew what to look for.

""...Let's see, your eyes started darting around, you shifted your posture on your chair, you started stuttering, what more? I studied the data Karl provided us with, Nikolai, and if that machine didn't lie, then I'm certain you're hiding something, so out with it before I call off the contract I signed with your superiors!""

He took in a deep breath.

""Well then, I guess I really should watch my mouth more, shouldn't I? Basically, we signed a contract with them a few *weeks* ago, we would help them with their food shortage, and in return they would provide us with information on how the Federation fights, and that's how we knew how to program the virus in a way that would allow it to infect computers used by the Federation.""

There *had* to be more to that deal, all Arxur always tried to take advantage of others...

""What more is there?""

""What do you mean by more? There isn't more to that deal. I swear! I can redirect you to one of my higher ups and you can ask them for a copy of it if you want!""

""Oh I can assure you, I will make *sure* to call them and ask why the brahk they approved a contract with those monsters. But I will do that later because we have a *bigger* problem now: What do you think will happen to the 'peace plans' of the United Nations with the Federation when they find out you were talking with our *sworn* enemies? Let me give you an opinion: *it won't be pretty*. For now, answer me this *one* question, ***who*** was commanding that fleet you came in contact with?""

Nikolai stayed silent for a few moments, he cleared his throat briefly, before answering me.

""For your last question, his name was *Isif.""*

He briefly stopped to drink some water, before continuing.

""...As for the rest. You know, we have a saying, that states that 'if you want peace, prepare for war'. It has already been shown that the vast majority of those in the United Nations has already accepted that a war is inevitable, and preparations are being done accordingly. We don't expect the Federation to listen to us, so much so that the question of whether we will send a *human* ambassador or not is still being heavily discussed. After all, there's a very high chance that the exterminators working as security there *will* light the poor person on fire at the earliest opportunity.

*Nothing* will change the fact that we arrived late at the galactic stage, and even with the luxury of having time to prepare, if we fail at diplomacy, it's very likely humanity will need to fight more than 30 species at once, and as advanced as our technology is, it won't do *shit* if each one of our ships has to fight 100 or more Federation ships. Our saving grace will more than likely be Project Dyson, since it can reliably deny access to the Solar System if needed.  
  But even it can be overwhelmed with a big enough fleet, which we *know* the Federation can likely assemble *if* given enough time and a good enough reason. Their industrial capacity puts ours to shame even if they haven't assembled anything remotely close to a Dyson Swarm, after all, I'm pretty sure you know they have *hundreds* of star systems according to the information both you *and* Isif gave us, when we only have *one* star system to make use of.""

""And what's your point with that?""

""We *cannot win* this battle on our own, Tyvil, and if increasing our chances of making it out alive means befriend the enemies of our *potential* enemies, then so be it. But even if we do manage to make peace with those xenophobic aliens, we will probably constantly live under high tension, with something as simple as a diplomatic incident being enough to spark a war. I know you're probably pissed off right now due to us having spoken with the Arxur and not having mentioned it to you, I can understand that, and I sincerely apologize in the name of everyone here, but *please*, try to see things from our point of view too.""

*...He has a point, I'm letting my emotions take over...*

I took in a few deep breaths. *In and out,* ***in and out***.

""Look, there are some people that work for me that, if they find out about this... There's a real chance they will actually report you to the Federation, you know that? Oh protector, what did I get myself in...""

""Then don't say anything, simple, besides, Isif said that he would order his troops to stop bothering your colonies the last time he came here, haven't you noticed that?""

I stopped for a moment in order to think and go through the papers on my desk, and indeed, the number of reports regarding Arxur attacks on certain parts of our territory had significantly died down. But not *completely*.

""...We're still receiving raiding reports from the northwest part of our border. So Isif either *lied*, or-""

""There's *someone* else responsible for the fleets that are still attacking your colonies.""

""Exactly...""

Barely a moment of silence passed before he spoke again, briefly startling me.

""Alright, what do you want me to do? Because it's clear you won't fully accept us having contracts with Isif anytime soon. I could get in contact with him and try and get some information out of him regarding these attacks and perhaps get something done to stop them from happening.""

I tensed, he nailed what I was about to say with an unnerving amount of precision.

""Talk with that Arxur you managed to somehow *befriend*, and get info on *who* is still attacking us, get rid of them and perhaps escort some of our rescue fleets during their raids on cattle ships, and I think I will be willing to... *overlook*... the contract you humans made with... them...""

He briefly nodded, before quickly typing something on his desk. ""Alright, I will take this information to the United Nations Headquarters, I will contact you again as soon as I can, and also, one last thing before I disconnect.""

""Hm?""

""Noah asked me to ask you to pair Tarva with him in the future when we eventually carry out an exchange program.""

*For brahk's sake, I can't have peace...*

1m8enfl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1m8enfl/considering_leaving_my_partner/,Considering leaving my partner?,"I've been with my partner for 7+ years. We live together, have for a long time. I feel a little suffocated by him. I feel like he subconsciously feels like his needs matter more than mine. (He grew up an only child, idk if that counts.) I recently had surgery and the house is a mess, if I don't clean, nothing gets done. I shouldn't have to ask repeatedly over months for him to rinse out his coffee mug and put it in the rack etc.

Been finally expressing how unsatisfied I am in our sexual relationship with the help of my therapist. ""I didn't know it was that bad."" He says. I have not been the best at expressing my needs but this is an ongoing pattern I've seen my whole life. Men typically take care of themselves and are done in the bedroom. Still, now he's making it about his needs to ""spice things up"" and I'm just...full of resentment and turned off. I expressed to him recently that he instantly says no to things I suggest. Often times he needs more elaboration (which is fine) but the instant no with no questions or even a thought is so insulting. I talked with him about this after it happened several times in a day.

It's a messed up situation, because I have many mental illnesses. He has supported me for a long time, and I'm currently contributing but I couldn't make it on my own. Just living is hard for me. Everyday is hard even though I'm medicated now. We moved to a new state a few years ago and I'm across the country away from my family (who I don't trust or speak to, just my sister.) I'm worried if we did break up, I'd be homeless or go into debt. I feel like I ""owe him.""

It is confusing because I love him, he's very kind, but he's also a stick in the mud. I feel held back by him in that regard.

He says I'm his better half but idk if he's mine. I would love to tell him ""I'm a catch, you're going to lose me."" But I would only do that if I was decided on a ""stay or go"" situation. I'm not trying to use that as a threat, it's just how I feel. I might be insecure and mentally ill, and it might sound self centered, but I know I'm a cool person and sometimes it feels like he doesn't deserve me. I'm very spontaneous and adventurous at times, but I'm introverted. I wish he'd try to let go just a little bit sometimes.

I'm terrified to be alone. I want to try and work on our relationship, but if it doesn't work out (after a year or two) I might have to go. I've been abused my whole life, I've had a lot of my youth taken from me, and I finally feel awake after finding a good therapist. I'm tired of trying to make everyone else happy. It often gets me nowhere.

We've been talking, when I try to talk about things he doesn't get mad. (Something I'm not used to.) We can actually talk, but sometimes he doesn't remember anything I say. Like he forgot I was sexually abused and touched in a spot where it happened the morning after I confessed it to him. He forgot I had an eating disorder. I don't make a big deal of it, but I've spoken about it a few times.

I really want this relationship to work, but I just have felt so damn underappreciated by every nearly relationship I've had. I've told myself I'm the problem for a long time, I definitely could have done better with some things, but I feel like I try so hard. When I don't try, that doesn't matter either. I can only blame so much on ""not feeling safe expressing my needs."" Like it's my fault if my partner takes no interest in my wellbeing.

I've been with my partner for 7+ years. We live together, have for a long time. I feel a little suffocated by him. I feel like he subconsciously feels like his needs matter more than mine. (He grew up an only child, idk if that counts.) I recently had surgery and the house is a mess, if I don't clean, nothing gets done. I shouldn't have to ask repeatedly over months for him to rinse out his coffee mug and put it in the rack etc.

Been finally expressing how unsatisfied I am in our sexual relationship with the help of my therapist. ""I didn't know it was that bad."" He says. I have not been the best at expressing my needs but this is an ongoing pattern I've seen my whole life. Men typically take care of themselves and are done in the bedroom. Still, now he's making it about his needs to ""spice things up"" and I'm just...full of resentment and turned off. I expressed to him recently that he instantly says no to things I suggest. Often times he needs more elaboration (which is fine) but the instant no with no questions or even a thought is so insulting. I talked with him about this after it happened several times in a day.

It's a messed up situation, because I have many mental illnesses. He has supported me for a long time, and I'm currently contributing but I couldn't make it on my own. Just living is hard for me. Everyday is hard even though I'm medicated now. We moved to a new state a few years ago and I'm across the country away from my family (who I don't trust or speak to, just my sister.) I'm worried if we did break up, I'd be homeless or go into debt. I feel like I ""owe him.""

It is confusing because I love him, he's very kind, but he's also a stick in the mud. I feel held back by him in that regard.

He says I'm his better half but idk if he's mine. I would love to tell him ""I'm a catch, you're going to lose me."" But I would only do that if I was decided on a ""stay or go"" situation. I'm not trying to use that as a threat, it's just how I feel. I might be insecure and mentally ill, and it might sound self centered, but I know I'm a cool person and sometimes it feels like he doesn't deserve me. I'm very spontaneous and adventurous at times, but I'm introverted. I wish he'd try to let go just a little bit sometimes.

Over time, a strong personal connection has grown. She‚Äôs very open, shares deep personal things (like emotional struggles), and once said I‚Äôm one of the few who ‚Äúreally sees‚Äù her.


Some details:
- A few months ago, after only a few conversations, I asked if she wanted to meet outside work. She said no ‚Äî not because of me, but because she doesn‚Äôt date coworkers.

- I accepted that. But since then, she kept the conversations going and even initiated more.

- Our connection has deepened. She notices little things about me (watch, energy, mood), comments on them, and seems genuinely happy to talk.

- She initiates coffee breaks, mentioned she thought about me over the weekend, and opened up about very personal things (like a past breakdown).

- She started texting me first thing Monday to ask about my weekend after I went out ‚Äî not sure if that was curiosity or more.

- Until recently, we only talked via work chat. Now we‚Äôre in daily private contact.


She seems to trust and enjoy me deeply ‚Äî and it feels emotional, not just friendly. But since she already gave a clear ‚Äúno‚Äù once, I‚Äôm unsure: am I imagining this deeper connection? Or could it be something developing despite the ‚Äúno coworkers‚Äù boundary?

For example, if you decide to drink coffee this morning, there is a universe where you didn‚Äôt drink coffee. It could be something as small as a neutron decaying in one universe not decaying in another. Another part of that theory tackles death. If I die due to a car crash, there will be another universe where I survive. The theory states that since our subconscious cannot imagine death, we will always be in the universe where we live. That means in our own subconscious, we are immortal.

I have believed this theory for years and it never drove me crazy until now. I realized if I wanted to kill myself, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to. There have been times I was really close to dying, intentionally and unintentionally.

When I was 7, a large can of tomato sauce almost fell on my head when I opened the cabinet door. I didn‚Äôt hear anything but I still walked back and the can hit the tile, cracking the tile. It felt like I was pushed or pulled back, and my reflexes couldn‚Äôt have saved me at that age. Just last week I was on the balcony of a penthouse, standing on a chair, drunk out of my mind. I wanted to jump off, but something in my mind pulled me back down, and I don‚Äôt know what. There have been moments I would be driving and randomly brake right before a car that I didn‚Äôt see almost hits me. I truly believe in another universe I died those times.

Now the despair I feel comes from the fact that if I am truly suicidal and wanting to kill myself, I won‚Äôt be able to. ‚ÄúWell, why not do something that will get you killed? Like hire a hitman or go to North Korea and criticize the government?‚Äù 2 things, I already made that decision in another universe and I still fear pain. If I die or not, I will still feel pain and I don‚Äôt want to suffer.

I want to hook up a nuclear bomb to a device that has a 50/50 chance of detonating the bomb every second and sit right next to it. Either I live for a whole minute and prove my point, or I die painlessly. The implications if I prove my theory would be immeasurable. 

The first chance I get I will seek therapy lol. If I am immortal I would want my endless life to at least be happy. ",0,1753386801.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,0.5,False

Tiki has been my biggest inspiration since I started taking cocktails seriously so I wanted to make a drink that paid tribute to some of my favourite parts of the culture. It started with the desire to make an ingredient similar to the secret (and often logistically nonsensical) mixes that Donn and Vic used to hide their recipes from each other, the most famous of which being Donn's Mix #1. 


I took my secret sauce, a mix of the sweet and chocolatey Punch Abruzzo amaro, sugar, and Jamaican jerk seasoning, and applied it to a drink that takes inspiration from two of the most important Tiki cocktails: the Mai Tai - hands down biggest cocktail from the Tiki boom era of the 40s and 50s, and the Jungle Bird - an oddball latecomer that slowly grew to prominence and shaped the modern Tiki revival. The result is a rich, bittersweet, and well-seasoned grog that straddles the line between nightcap and reviver.

To Dr.

Sometimes I think that you might believe me being okay means you shouldn‚Äôt intrude or speak to me, because you‚Äôre afraid you‚Äôll cause more pain. 

Maybe you think, *‚ÄúOh, she‚Äôs healed, she‚Äôs better,‚Äù* or maybe it‚Äôs hard for you. 

I don't know, all I know is my heart still pulls me in your direction. I don't know if you feel the same too. But I feel you, even now. 

I write in these public diaries for myself, trying to get all these thoughts out of my head. 

I‚Äôm an adult with an open heart, who isn't afraid to listen and understand others. 

So if you ever want to have conversation, if you ever find me, know that I‚Äôm open. 

I‚Äôve always been open to that. I‚Äôm just not the kind of person who shuts people out just because we have a past. We all deserve to find peace, or even just to speak the words that keep thumping in the night. I'll always have a space for you in my heart for you to re-enter safely. 

So, of course, everything I say on here, these are thoughts and things you may never hear, but if chance ever reappears like it once did, I hope you take a leap of faith. Like you always have. You brilliant beautiful man. :) 

My writing might even be messy and filled with errors, I don‚Äôt know. I go about my day, glance here and there, and try my best not to think too much about the past, just to keep moving forward.

Our connection still feels extremely strong, and even if it fades, it lingers. I have to get these thoughts out, because if I don‚Äôt, I‚Äôll feel like everything inside me will just be buried. I don‚Äôt want to run. 

I can‚Äôt say I don‚Äôt miss our conversations. As mundane as they may have seemed, I loved them, because they came from you. You were, and still are, very special to me.

So maybe one day, you‚Äôll have the courage to come by and say hi. Just tell me how you‚Äôve been. Tell me how everything is going, what life is like. Maybe we could get coffee, take that walk you always said you wanted to take, just be two adults who can handle a bit of communication.

I hope you know, I‚Äôm okay. Your silence is not cruel to me. But if the silence is hurting you, if it‚Äôs cruel to your heart, please don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out. I don‚Äôt want you to feel pain and suffer in internal silence. If I can help with just relieving the constant ache, I'm here.

I hope one day you allow yourself the opportunity to trust someone with your heart. I hope one day you give me the opportunity to simply graze your presence. 

I love you unconditionally, no strings, no games. Your welcome and will be recieved. Without burden. Just love, just grace to your unheard trembles.

Be well, wherever you are. I love you. That is my truth. You have a beautiful smile and beautiful hands. Don't ever stop loving with them.

Long story short:

* from 8 to 14 lived with my mom and narcissist stepfather: he broke me, I was severely depressed
* at 14 left to my dad's place, cut all contact with my stepfather and convinced my mom to leave him some years after
* now 24 and FINALLY in a really good place with my self confidence/mental health
* today had to see my ex stepfather again bc he brought me my little stepbrother
* he offered me to take a coffee together in two weeks because I ""might have things to tell him"" and seemed genuine about it

I'm really confused.

I'm not expecting him to apologise, I 90% know he's not capable of it. But I'm thinking maybe it would help me to heal even more to finally be able to tell him everything I've always wanted to tell him, in a safe public space.

But I'm also afraid. I'm not physically afraid of him anymore but afraid he's going to gaslight me / deny what happened / say ""yes but it's because blablabla"" / make me enter the ""narcissist loop"" again. Afraid he'll trigger me and I'll lose all the mental health progress I finally achieved.

But if I hold the gas for 1-2 minutes at about 1500rpm, she will then hold idle fine, and act like nothing happened.

# OP‚Äôs asthma attack

OP, who has stress induced asthma, says [she discovered her husband cheating on her,](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/s/FvVsMIaDWI) and when confronting him, things went downhill:

> **AIO- my husband would not call an ambulance for me during an asthma attack.**
> 
> Sorry if this is all over the place, I‚Äôm very confused by this whole situation and also scared. 
> 
> Yesterday, I found out about some minor infidelities between my husband and one of his coworkers, some consistent back-and-forth flirting for several months. I was extremely hurt by this because I made it clear to him that any sort of cheating in a relationship would be a nonnegotiable. 
> 
> We had a discussion about the situation and he spent hours trying to convince me that it was my own insecurities that were causing me to feel upset, not his actions.  
> 
> I told him that I will be leaving the marriage, at which point he then become very cruel and started saying terrible things to me. I became physically upset and started hyperventilating. I have had maybe one or two bouts of hyperventilation in my past 42 years of life and from what I remember was able to calm myself down after a minute or two, but this was something different, I wasn‚Äôt able to take any deep breaths, all of my breaths were shallow, and I couldn‚Äôt take any air past a very shallow breath and without creating some sort of grunt. 
> 
> I also have stress induced asthma and have had it since I was 12.  I believe the hyperventilating converted into a stress induced asthma attack, I grabbed my inhaler that was in my desk drawer, and took two puffs, but there was no relief. 
> 
> At this point, he was downstairs and I started to get very dizzy, the room was spinning, and my fingertips started to tingle. I crawled out to the top of the stairs and was grunting and gasping for air, I did my best to yell his name. He walked halfway up the stairs and through small grants I asked him to call 911, he stood there and just blankly looked at me with his phone in his hand. I repeated it again and told him I‚Äôm begging you please call 911 I‚Äôm going to die. He continued to just stand and stare at me blankly, he then put his phone in his mouth and bit down so hard on his phone that it cracked.  
> 
> At this point, I realized that I was probably going to die so I ran down the stairs, was able to find my purse and made it to my car. I started driving towards an emergency room. At this point, the hyperventilating and inability to take a full breath had been lasting for about 8 to 10 minutes. As I was driving i once again had the feeling of ‚Äúfading out‚Äù so I pulled over into a neighborhood and called an ambulance, they arrived and I was not able to breathe normally until I was in the ambulance for like another 10 minutes.  
> 
> I was given a nebulizer at the hospital, which gave me the ability to finally take a deep breath.  
> 
> While, at the hospital, I was in shock at what had just happened and also confused. I consulted a close friend on the situation and she of course, found it horrific, and validated my feelings. I was at the emergency department for about eight hours, arrived home at 7 AM and then at 10 AM he started making so much noise in the kitchen that it woke me up. I went downstairs, I made myself a cup of coffee and sat at the kitchen table, he acted like nothing had happened and was going about his day as normal. 
> 
> He never once apologized or asked me how I was feeling. 
> 
> I very calmly asked him why he refused to call an ambulance for me and he said that he was panicked and didn‚Äôt know what to do. I understand being panicked, but aren‚Äôt people who are like actively being stabbed able to call 911? Also, I‚Äôm very confused by the action of him biting his phone. I theorized that he did this so he could break his phone and not be able to call 911 but he said that this was an absurd accusation, I have since left the house for my safety and not discussed any of this with any of my family members. 
> 
> I was under the assumption that when you marry someone one of their most important tasks is to protect you and keep you safe. 
> 
> His stance is that this situation is something that we can work through and get over, but my stance is that I need a divorce and a protection order. Can anyone share some insight on what is going on, I do not have any friends where I live that I can talk to. 
> 
> Also additional information, calling an ambulance and going to the emergency room would not put us in any sort of financial distress, we both have very comprehensive/good insurance. 

# Skeptics roll into the thread

> **Op:** My phone was in my purse thank god *[downvoted again]*

> And yet you didn‚Äôt use it, choosing to try to drive yourself instead. You should ask the AI to get retrained on stories from people who really have asthma.¬†*[downvoted]*

> **OP:** Are you saying I didn‚Äôt use my phone? I used my phone to call an ambulance, sorry if I didn‚Äôt put that in the post.

> **OP:** I‚Äôm more confused as to why you guys think that it would be safe for me to stay in a house with a man who is OK with actively watching me die? For clarification- I had an asthma attack on the second floor of my house. There are multiple resources about the disease on the Internet that can be accessed easily. One in 12 Americans have asthma and nine people die every day in America from asthma attacks. Regarding my personal possessions and actions on the night in question - I am the type of person who does not have my phone beside me 24/7, I actually usually keep it in my purse when I‚Äôm at home. I keep my purse on the first floor of my house. After my husband refused to call, I saw no other option but to physically take initiative so I passed him on the stairs and entered into my dining room/kitchen area. My purse is brown leather with gold star studs so it was quite visible on the empty dining room table, I put the purse under my arm and exited my home and entered my vehicle. A police officer lives in a house down the street from me. Neither one of their cars was in the driveway and all the lights were off so I assumed they weren‚Äôt home. I continued to drive towards the emergency room. After about three minutes of driving, I realized that it was unsafe for me to continue so I pulled over into a neighborhood, took my phone from my purse and called 911. The operator could not locate me to I took a piece of mail from a mailbox next to my parked automobile and read the address on the piece of mail through small short breaths to the 911 operator. The fire department arrived first, then the ambulance arrived, then the police arrived, the ambulance driver‚Äôs name was Stevie and had a tattoo of a skeleton key on her arm. Please let me know if you have any additional questions. *[downvoted]*

> Wait you couldn't drive anymore, but you were able to get out of your automobile, walk to a mailbox and take someone's mail out of their mailbox to get the address off of it? Or did you have your car window right next to someone's mailbox? What if there hadn't been any mail in the mailbox?
> 
> And neither the fire department or the ambulance had a nebulizer machine? And the police were asking you a bunch of questions while you couldn't breathe? Couldn't they see you couldn't breathe? Your story is wonky.

> **OP:** Happy to answer any questions! I‚Äôm super bored in my hotel anyway. Let‚Äôs seeeee okay. I do recall the male ambulance driver asking the female ambulance driver if he should start the nebulizer and she said no just wait until we get to the hospital since it‚Äôs only a two minute drive. I apologize if this is not a word for a word transcription, but I might be able to obtain the records if there are video cameras in ambulances. I am unsure of the possession of a nebulizer machine by my cities‚Äôs Fire Department, but I will find time in my busy day to pop by and ask them for the sake of all of our sanity. What else? Oh yes, the police. The female police officer asked me 3-4 questions. She was very patient with me. From what I remember, they were yes or no questions such as did your husband physically hurt you. Im sorry I can‚Äôt be more loquacious, but I will push aside the trauma of my crumbling marriage and health to try to remember the other questions so I could satisfy your burning desire for the most banal details of an otherwise eventful evening.

> You're the one who said the police asked you ""a bunch of questions"" now you backpedal and it was just 3 or 4 yes or no questions. Why would they ask if your husband physically hurt you? How would they even know know you were married or that you came from a fight with your husband?  You're the one that said you were driving in your car 8 - 10 minutes not being able to breathe then you were in the ambulance another 10 minutes but they wouldn't give you the nebulizer because the hospital was only 2 miles away. So did the ER rush out with the nebulizer? Or you sat in the waiting room for how long?
> 
> I'm done with your ridiculous nonsense.

> **OP:** You‚Äôre the one interrogating me like I‚Äôm goddamn Casey Anthony when in reality I had an asthma attack and sought help? Let me guess you‚Äôre one of those women that says things like ‚Äúbut did she say no?!‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat was she wearing‚Äù? Please go explore the world or even just the country and gain some life experience, meet people outside of your own culture and get off the internet. It seems like you do have a passion for true crime so maybe you can channel that enthusiasm into something productive, have a good weekend Pearl.

1m8e16m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Invisalign/comments/1m8e16m/first_8_days_of_my_clear_aligner_journey/,First 8 days of my clear aligner journey,"Day 1. Getting home from the ortho, everything is painful. Fortunately I have the day off, so I'm just lounging on the couch. Painkillers. Taking the braces out before dinner is a bit of a hassle, and I almost drop one of them. The attachments hinder my chewing and my whole mouth is sore, so I just mash up my dinner. It's not great, but I didn't expect otherwise.

Day 2. Didn't sleep too well. First workday with the aligners. I'm late for work because I want to wait 30 minutes after breakfast to brush my teeth, so my whole morning routine is off. I feel awkward all through my workday, I'm lisping a bit, and I go to a different floor to brush my teeth after lunch because I'd feel self-conscious running into my colleagues. The whole bottom half of my face feels sore, and I have a headache because apparently I'm unconsciously clenching my jaw all the time. What did I get myself into?

Day 3. It's starting to feel a bit better. Still didn't sleep too great. In a video call, I feel very self-conscious about the way my mouth moves. After work, we have a small family gathering for my dad's birthday. My 3-year-old nephew is absolutely entranced with the idea of the aligners and he keeps wanting to tap his grubby little fingers against them. Cute, but please wash your hands, you dirty little gremlin! I end up having my aligners out a bit too long, because there's an extended dinner and drinks and cake and everything.

Day 4. I feel like I need to compensate for yesterday's less-than-perfect wear time. I want to do everything perfectly so I can get through my treatment as fast as possible, but it's quite a puzzle: wait 30 minutes after eating to brush, but then also have the aligners in for 22 hours a day. So having 3 meals a day, that means I can spend 10 minutes eating per meal? Or should I skip brushing my teeth every now and then? I'm also starting to notice how much I usually snack between meals, and I spend half the day hangry. After dinner we have friends over for gaming, and I spend the whole evening drinking water. Meh.

Day 5. Interesting: the aligners are almost becoming comfortable. At some point during the day, I had a sudden feeling of: shit, I'm not wearing my aligners! Turns out I WAS in fact wearing them, but just didn't notice them. Feels like a small victory. At this point, NOT having the aligners in starts to become more uncomfortable, with the bare attachments scraping against the insides of my cheeks and lips. A friend tells me that she did clear aligners and followed the rules to a perfect 1000%. I'm already feeling my resolve crumbling.

Day 6. After scarfing down lunch + everything I'd have otherwise spread out over a whole afternoon (two pieces of fruit + a handful of nuts + half a cookie + a cup of coffee) in record time, I'm feeling a bit faint. This can't be good for my blood sugar. You know what, this is it: I give up trying to do the perfect 22 hours each day. I'm just going to aim for at least 20 hours, and any extra time is a bonus. I'd rather have a life (and not mess up my blood sugar or enamel) and spend a few extra months on the aligners.

Day 7. Life is much better without trying to be perfect. On the other hand, finding my own way is also a bit of a puzzle. I experiment with swishing with water after lunch and then just immediately putting my aligners back in, which seems OK. I have an extra 'aligners out' moment around 4pm for coffee and a snack, so I don't get hangry before dinner. I even have a beer (through a straw) in the evening, and then just brush my teeth again before bed.

Day 8. I have a long business meeting, including lunch. This feels like a test. I realize I'm not lisping anymore at this point, and I don't think anyone notices the aligners. I go to the bathroom to remove the aligners right when the food arrives, and since I'm not having anything sugary, I just swish my mouth with water after eating and put my aligners back in, right at the table, at a moment when everyone's attention is on someone else. At this point, I didn't feel bothered by any of it, and that feels like another small victory. I do brush my teeth when I get back to my own office, and I find out I had some food stuck in my teeth. It's a mix between 'oops' and 'oh well'.

That's pretty much my journey so far. It may be interesting to read for other people who are starting their journey. If you've read all this way: did you try to be perfect at the start, and how long did you manage to stay that way?",1,1753385797.0,Invisalign,0,1.0,False
1m8dzv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/bupropion/comments/1m8dzv2/over_one_month_on_bupropion_experiences_and/,Over one month on bupropion: experiences and thoughts.,"I have been on Bupropion 150 extended release (Lupin) for well over one month now. Will actually be heading into my psychiatrist to do a check up after this post. Just wanted to note a few experiences that I had during this first month.

For me my honeymoon phase started immediately the first day. I felt incredibly blissful for the first week it was pretty wonderful to be honest. I was also insanely productive. Told my family members I wanted to feel like that forever LOL. The only side effects I had during this time was peeing a LOT (like over 30 times a day), physical anxiety, and a headaches. Though the last two I believe were from taking a probably excessive amount of coffee in the morning with my bupropion in the morning. I will say probably less than two days before I began bupropion I took 10 mg of prescription diazepam for a stressful medical procedure. If that effected something who knows.

Fortunately the initial side effects mostly went away after the first two weeks but unfortunately the honeymoon phase ended. And the third week after was like a ""crash"" I actually made a post about it, [https://www.reddit.com/r/bupropion/comments/1lrwqgd/two\_weeks\_in\_feeling\_emotionally\_flat\_a\_sign\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/bupropion/comments/1lrwqgd/two_weeks_in_feeling_emotionally_flat_a_sign_to/) I was having a lot of dissociation and just feeling dull and numb. As well as some anger unfortunately. Hard to say if it was the medication or me not having a lot of sleep.

The next few weeks after that I felt really stable. The numbness and dullness went away completely as well as all the other side effects. I feel like myself before the medication but without the depression. I feel generally pleasant with the occasional negative thought. But those negative thoughts don't seem to throw me into a deep spiral like they once did. I will say it has not done much for my anxiety but I am working on that through therapy. My family members report that I am much more enjoyable to be around. Therapist says I seem more focused and present. So all in all a positive experience and will be continuing without increasing my dose at the moment.",2,1753385714.0,bupropion,0,1.0,False

1m8dyrh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m8dyrh,3 compartment sink: Will it pass inspection?,"Anyone have experience with a used three compartment sink of somewhat questionable condition, as far as health department inspection goes?
 
I'm setting up a coffee roastery in my garage so I'm going for a commercial food manufacturing license. My state doesn't differententiate between a home business vs. commercial business when it comes to food manufacturing. I used to own a cafe-roastery so it's a very similar process when it comes to setting up. I'm required to have a 3 compartment sink to wash the containers that I'll be using to hold the roasted coffee before I bag it. 
 
I purchased a used sink that looked like it had a little bit of surface rust. Easy-peezy to clean up, right? Wrong. Turns out there was some blackening and pitting under the rust. I've put in several hours trying to grind and polish it out and have scratched it up in the process. I think I can polish out the worst of the scratches, but the tiny pitting isn't going away. 
 
So I'm wondering if it's worth my time to continue trying to polish the scratches out (several hours worth of work with arthritic hands) or if I should I cut my losses and buy another sink. It's already plumbed so all of that would have to be redone. Not much left in the construction budget for a brand new sink so I'd have to buy used again. My husband and I are doing all the work ourselves so except for the sink, it's just going to cost us time, which is also a huge issue.
 
I know every health inspector is different. But in general, would scratches and pitting in the sink cause me to fail inspection? Anyone else had a similar situation? Adding photos to illustrate the problem.",1,1753385641.0,restaurantowners,5,1.0,False
1m8dypr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1m8dypr/should_you_buy_the_hamilton_beach_49980r_drip/,Should You Buy the Hamilton Beach 49980R Drip Coffee Maker Review and Features,"I recently spent some quality time with the **Hamilton Beach 49980R**, and it's been an interesting experience that had me brewing like a barista while putting this coffee maker to the test. Designed as a dual coffee brewing solution, this machine gives you the option to make a single cup or a full pot of coffee, which is precisely what caught my attention. My mornings tend to be chaotic, so having a multi-functional coffee maker is always a win for me.

**Design and Build**  
Right out of the box, this coffee machine impressed me with its solid build and sleek black design, accented by a metallic finish. It‚Äôs surprisingly compact for something that does so much, making it a good fit even for smaller countertops. The layout of the controls is intuitive, with buttons that are clearly labeled, making operation straightforward even if you‚Äôre still half-asleep before your first cup. At 10.63"" x 12.2"" x 13.7"", it‚Äôs not overwhelmingly large, and I appreciated the separate water reservoirs for single-serve and full-pot brewing‚Äîit‚Äôs such a thoughtful touch.

**Functionality Tackled with Precision**  
What stood out immediately during testing was the versatility of this coffee maker. The single-serve option allows you to use ground coffee directly, no K-Cups here. This may not appeal to everyone, but personally, I liked the eco-friendly intent behind it. Not messing with plastic capsules means less waste and lets you enjoy the rich flavors of freshly ground coffee. On days I needed a strong caffeine kick, the bold brew setting came in handy, crafting a pot of robust coffee that felt like a warm, aromatic hug. 

[Find the best price for Hamilton Beach 49980R on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b00ei7dppi/)

**Good Aspects**  
Testing this programmable coffee maker revealed plenty of strong suits.  
- Dual brewing versatility: Whether you need one cup or a full carafe, it handles both tasks seamlessly.  
- Bold and regular brew strength options ensure your coffee always fits your mood.
- Programmable settings let you prep your coffee the night before‚Äîwake up and it‚Äôs ready!  
- The Auto Pause & Pour feature allows you to sneak a cup mid-brew without spills.  

Not to mention, having separate easy-fill water reservoirs for each brewing method makes this machine incredibly convenient. As someone who forgets things easily in the morning rush, the transparent water windows helped ensure I never overfilled or underfilled.

**Limitations**  
Of course, no product is perfect, and the 49980R does have some areas for improvement.  
- The lack of compatibility with K-Cup pods might deter some users who‚Äôve grown accustomed to them.  
- The single-serve brewer doesn‚Äôt handle smaller travel mugs as well‚Äîit felt a little awkward aligning shorter cups.  
- It doesn‚Äôt shut off after dispensing water for a single serve, leaving me to worry that I hadn‚Äôt set it right.  

These minor setbacks didn‚Äôt deter my overall experience but are definitely worth mentioning.

**Performance Details**  
Performance-wise, the product was consistent. Brewing a full pot was quick, and the coffee always came out hot, though not scalding. There‚Äôs a permanent filter included, which is a blessing because I ran out of paper filters one day and didn‚Äôt miss a beat. It also auto-shuts off, a feature I‚Äôm always thankful for because I tend to rush out the door. The automatic programming feature worked like a dream, especially on busy mornings when pre-planning saves me precious time.

**Rival Brands**  
When comparing this to other products I‚Äôve used, some pros and cons sprang to mind. The Ninja DualBrew Pro was slicker with its K-Cup compatibility, but it comes at a higher price point, and maintaining it can feel like a chore. Meanwhile, I‚Äôve also owned a Keurig K-Duo, which combines pod convenience with carafe brewing. But again, pods come with wastefulness, and the carafe brewing didn‚Äôt feel as robust as the Hamilton Beach option. One big plus here? This machine‚Äôs focus on ground coffee really highlights flavors, making it stand out against competitors.

**Value Assessment**  
For what it does, the coffee maker feels like an excellent deal. Products in this category often cater to either single-serve convenience or high-volume brewing, rarely finding the perfect balance between the two. And while the 49980R comes with some quirks, I‚Äôd say its feature lineup more than delivers on its cost-effectiveness. If you‚Äôre someone who cares about routine yet craves versatility, this machine offers great value.

Dining - Didn‚Äôt fine at hotel, but rooftop Restaraunt looked very nice.

So there I was‚Äîenjoying a late-night cup of coffee and watching a Bollywood release on Netflix‚Äîwhen a thought struck me.

1m8dw9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Separation/comments/1m8dw9z/two_week_update_she_told_me_last_night_shes/,Two week update: She told me last night. She's leaving.,"A few of you asked for a follow-up to my earlier post about my wife leaving me, so here it is.

It's been just under two weeks since she left, and a little over a month since she first told me she was thinking about it. In a talk last week, she let me know she'd felt nothing for me for months. That hurt. That she hid it felt like betrayal. And in many ways, I suppose it was.

But when she first said she was unsure, I was handed a strange gift: the time to start grieving, time to grow. It hurt like hell and eroded me, but it also gave me the space I needed to begin working on myself before the collapse. I'm grateful I didn't waste that time. Rather than curl into a ball, I rose like a phoenix from the ashes.

So yes, I'm doing better now. My head's well above water. The dread has quieted. I'm eating well again, sleeping a little better, and working out daily. I'm on a 43-day streak and just started a new lifting routine to bulk up.

This week, I caught glimpses of the man I'm becoming. A man who speaks clearly. Who doesn't disappear or shut down. Confident. Present. Charming. Warm. Friends and family have noticed the change. I'm finally becoming who I‚Äôve always wanted to be, and I feel fantastic.

Through therapy, I've come to realize the rupture wasn't all my fault. I had loud flaws. She had quiet ones. I carried guilt like punishment, but the truth is we both failed each other by not communicating and by building silent resentment.

I also bit the bullet and got a full psych evaluation. I finally have answers: I'm highly sensitive, deeply but unconsciously anxious, and never really learned how to express emotions. But now that I know, I'm working on smoothing those corners. I've been reading a lot, building awareness, and taking real steps to grow. I've even built a small ritual of going to coffee shops with a book and headphones. It's quiet. Calming. I look forward to those moments more than I expected.

I‚Äôve also reconnected with old friends. Even some I thought were hers, but it turns out they were ours. And they welcomed me with open arms. The outpouring of love has floored me. I‚Äôve cried more in the last two weeks from their messages than I have in years. And for the first time in a long time, I feel seen. Really seen, understood, and loved.

I'm not thriving yet, but I'm climbing. Fast. I'm building something new. I'm remembering who I am. And I'm doing well: I'm making real memories with my kids. I'm building a life rooted in truth, not illusion. And it's only going to get better from here.

I'm also making peace with the fact that I'm going to lose the home I built with love and sweat. That'll bring a new wave of grief, but it won‚Äôt end me. I'll rebuild. And one day, I'll share it with someone who gets to see the best of me, because I'm worthy of being loved for who I truly am.

For too long, I made my marriage my whole identity. I was a husband and a father and that was it. I thought I didn‚Äôt need anyone else and stopped trying. I let everything else fall away. That was a mistake I‚Äôll never repeat.

Will she come back? Will she ever even see this new me? I don‚Äôt know. And to be blunt, I don't care. I‚Äôm not waiting. I'm not living for her anymore. I‚Äôm growing as a person, as a man, and as a father, for myself. And eventually, someone special will get to feel that too.

I still miss her. I still love her. That hasn‚Äôt changed. But I‚Äôm learning to love myself now. Thinking of her and the moments we shared stings a little less each day. They‚Äôre becoming tingles in the back of my mind instead of punches to the face.

The tide will rise and fall. Just don‚Äôt let it take you under. Keep breathing. Keep fighting. You‚Äôll come out stronger every time it recedes.

If you're in the early days of separation, especially if you didn‚Äôt choose it, I won‚Äôt sugarcoat it. It‚Äôs hell. But if all you can do right now is survive the next hour, that counts. That matters. Sometimes, it was all I could manage too.

But I‚Äôm still here. Still growing. Still becoming the man I always wanted to be.

If you ever need to talk or just not feel alone, my inbox is open.

Take care of your heart. Even when it hurts, it still beats. And that means you‚Äôre still here.  
It will heal. If you let it.",5,1753385475.0,Separation,0,1.0,False

1m8dsvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1m8dsvb/extraterrestrial/,Extraterrestrial,"   Name‚Äôs Jenson Briars. Forty-four years old. Been breathin‚Äô the air of Webstone near my whole damn life. It‚Äôs a quiet town‚Äîdusty roads, empty fields stretchin‚Äô farther than the eye can squint. Folks round here all know each other, which means they all know me. And worse, they know what happened.
   Used to be, I had a crew. Good ol‚Äô boys. We‚Äôd hit the bar come sundown, shoot the shit over cold beers, maybe stumble home laughin‚Äô at nothin‚Äô. I ain‚Äôt never been much with women‚Äîtoo shy, too quiet, don‚Äôt look ‚Äôem in the eye long enough. But folks still liked me. Hell, most would say I was the kindest soul Webstone had.
   That was before.
   Now, when I walk into town, people cross the damn street like I‚Äôm carryin‚Äô a plague. Don‚Äôt speak, don‚Äôt nod, just look through me‚Äîor worse, don‚Äôt look at all. My friends? Gone. Scattered like ashes in the wind. All ‚Äòcept Harold.
   Harold‚Äôs still here. Always been, probably always will be. And he‚Äôs the only one who believes me. Knows I ain‚Äôt spinnin‚Äô tales for attention. Ain‚Äôt lookin‚Äô for sympathy neither. Hell, if I could forget it all, I would. But things don‚Äôt work that way. Not after what happened.
   I ain‚Äôt a monster. I ain‚Äôt changed. I still wake up in the same damn house, drink the same coffee, wear the same boots ‚Äòtil they split at the sole. I‚Äôm still Jenson. Same old, some old. But I reckon that don‚Äôt matter much anymore. Not ‚Äòround here.
   Happened ‚Äòbout four months back. I was out behind the barn, feedin‚Äô the hogs like I always do, when I caught sight of somethin‚Äô strange up in the sky. A star‚Äîonly it weren‚Äôt just any ol‚Äô star. This one was shinin‚Äô brighter than the rest, damn near hummin‚Äô in place. At first I figured it was the North Star, but then I saw it‚Ä¶ ripples. Real ones, like someone had dropped a stone in the sky instead of a pond.
   I stood there, slack-jawed, just watchin‚Äô. The ripples spread wide, slow at first, then vanished into the dark like they‚Äôd never been. And that star? It started movin‚Äô. Real slow. Straight line. Didn‚Äôt flicker, didn‚Äôt drift‚Äîjust glided smooth as ice right across the heavens.
   I forgot all about them hogs. My eyes was glued to the sky. Then I saw ‚Äòem‚Äîtwo more stars. They‚Äôd moved too, leavin‚Äô their usual spots behind, floatin‚Äô toward that first one ‚Äòtil they all hung there, right above me, in a perfect damn triangle. Like some kinda sign. A constellation that don‚Äôt belong to any chart I ever seen.
   I can‚Äôt rightly tell you what I was thinkin‚Äô. My head felt hollow, like every thought had leaked clean out. I just stared. Watched that triangle start to turn. Slow at first‚Äîreal slow‚Äîthen faster, faster, ‚Äòtil it spun so quick it turned into a blur, a wheel of light in the middle of a dead quiet sky.
   Then‚Äîbam. Gone. All three of ‚Äòem shot off in different directions, fast as bullets, leavin‚Äô nothin‚Äô behind. No trail, no glow, no sound. Just empty black. And I ain‚Äôt seen ‚Äòem since.
   After that, I started feelin‚Äô lightheaded‚Äîlike somethin‚Äô had knocked the wind clean outta me. So I wrapped up what I had to do with the hogs, wiped the sweat off my brow, and headed inside. Crawled into bed without a second thought. Now, let me make somethin‚Äô real clear‚ÄîI ain‚Äôt on drugs. Never touched the stuff, though folks like to flap their jaws and say otherwise.
   What happened next‚Ä¶ it don‚Äôt fit into no storybook. It‚Äôs the kind of thing folks call impossible ‚Äòcause believin‚Äô it means facin‚Äô a truth they ain‚Äôt ready for. I ain‚Äôt askin‚Äô you to believe me. Hell, I ain‚Äôt even askin‚Äô for sympathy. But I gotta tell it. All of it. And I gotta do it right.
   I told the cops. Told the papers. Even sat across from men in stiff suits who asked questions like they already knew the answers. My name ended up everywhere‚ÄîTV, newsprint, flyers hangin‚Äô in gas stations like I was some kinda missing person. Writers came knockin‚Äô, wantin‚Äô to slap my face on book covers. I turned ‚Äòem all down. This story‚Äîit‚Äôs mine to tell. ‚ÄòCause it wrecked my life. Changed every damn thing.
   It started when I shot awake that night. My heart was poundin‚Äô like a war drum, and my room‚Äîit was glowin‚Äô. There was a light pourin‚Äô through the window, but it wasn‚Äôt like any light I‚Äôd ever seen. It weren‚Äôt warm or yellow like the sun, and it sure as hell wasn‚Äôt from no truck or spotlight. It was luminous, blinding white. Hurt to open my eyes. Burned straight into my skull, gave me a poundin‚Äô headache like my brain was tryin‚Äô to escape.
   I stumbled outta bed, legs like jelly, hands shakin‚Äô. Made it to the door, barely, and when I opened it‚Äîmy whole damn house was drenched in that same blinding light. Walls, floors, ceiling‚Äîcouldn‚Äôt see nothin‚Äô but white.
   And underneath it all, I heard it. A low hum. Deep, mechanical-like. Not from this earth. It vibrated in my bones, like the sound was comin‚Äô from inside me. I couldn‚Äôt tell if I was swayin‚Äô or if the house was‚Äîbut everything felt like it was movin‚Äô, like reality itself had come loose and was slippin‚Äô sideways.
   And that‚Ä¶ that was just the beginnin‚Äô.
   All I remember was throwin‚Äô my hands over my ears, tryin‚Äô to block out that godawful hum. It weren‚Äôt just noise‚Äîit was in me, like it was rattlin‚Äô my damn bones apart. Next thing I knew, I was laid out cold on the floor.
   When I came to, for a split second, I thought I‚Äôd woke up in a hospital. White walls, steel table, sterile as hell. Looked like some kinda operatin‚Äô room‚Äîonly it weren‚Äôt any hospital I‚Äôd ever seen. First thing I saw was that light‚Äîbright and unnatural, glowin‚Äô down on me like I was a damn lab rat.
   Then I saw it‚Äîthe bein‚Äô. Can‚Äôt rightly describe it. My mind keeps tryin‚Äô to blur the edges, like it knows better than to remember clear. But what I do remember is that needle‚Äîlong, thick, glintin‚Äô in the light like somethin‚Äô outta a nightmare.
   It jabbed it into my side without a word. Burned like fire. I felt whatever it was pumpin‚Äô into me‚Äîthick, cold, wrong. My whole body seized up. I saw, just out the corner of my eye, blood risin‚Äô around the metal, tricklin‚Äô down my skin from the puncture.
   Didn‚Äôt take long before the darkness swallowed me again.
   Next time I woke, I was in my bed. My clock read 7:56 a.m. Thursday. Three whole days gone‚Äîvanished. Felt like I‚Äôd only been out a couple hours. My head was poundin‚Äô, but worse than that‚Äîmy eye was burnin‚Äô. Throbbin‚Äô. I reached up, and instead of skin, I felt fabric.
   I shot up, stumbled to the bathroom, and there I was‚Äîstarin‚Äô at myself in the mirror. Wearin‚Äô a damn eye patch. My fingers fumbled with the fabric as I peeled it back. I was horrified. My eye‚Ä¶black and bruised. It was leaking this thick, slimy substance. 
   Stomach turned. I dropped to my knees and puked ‚Äòtil I had nothin‚Äô left but dry heaves. And that‚Äôs when it hit me‚Äîthis wasn‚Äôt no dream, no fevered nightmare. This was real. All of it.
   Lifted my shirt to check my side, and there it was. Big ol‚Äô bruise, dark as rot, with a tiny red dot dead center‚Äîlike a brand. A reminder. Proof that somethin‚Äô unnatural had touched me‚Ä¶ and left its mark.
   I didn‚Äôt know what the hell to do. I panicked, threw on some clothes, and hauled ass to the hospital. That‚Äôs where I made my first mistake.
   Doc took one look at my eye and said there was hydrogen fluoride residue in it. Said the damage was done. I‚Äôd be blind on that side for the rest of my life. But that weren‚Äôt even the worst of it. Blood tests came back showin‚Äô traces of potassium permanganate in my system‚Äîenough to kill most folks. They told me I was lucky to still be breathin‚Äô.
   They started askin‚Äô questions. What happened? Where‚Äôd it come from? And truth be told, I didn‚Äôt have no clean, sensible answer. Only thing I had was the truth‚Äîso I gave it to ‚Äòem, raw and unfiltered.
   Didn‚Äôt take long after that for a cop and some sharp-lookin‚Äô fella from the FBI to stroll into my hospital room, notepads in hand. They sat down real quiet, real still, and wrote down every damn word I said.
   Then the floodgates opened.
   Reporters, conspiracy nuts, folks with podcasts and cameras‚Äîtryin‚Äô to get a piece of me like I was some freak show exhibit. They pounded on my door, begged the nurses, even tried bribin‚Äô their way in just to ask me somethin‚Äô. Wanted their names in the mix. Wanted to profit off my nightmare.
   When I was finally released and sent home, that‚Äôs when they came. No knock. No badge. Just a line of black SUVs and men dressed head to toe in black. Not a stitch of skin showin‚Äô. Dark glasses over their eyes, even though it was cloudy as sin out. They didn‚Äôt say who they were. Didn‚Äôt have to. The way they looked at me told me everything I needed to know.
   They weren‚Äôt here to help.
   They were here to make sure I stayed quiet.
   They sat me down and asked me every which way ‚Äòbout what happened. Said they believed me‚Äîtook my word like it was gospel. Then they did somethin‚Äô strange‚Ä¶ put me under, like hypnosis or somethin‚Äô. Dug around in my head, pullin‚Äô out every scrap of memory I had ‚Äòtil I was spillin‚Äô things I didn‚Äôt even know I remembered.
   When they left, I felt hollow. Dazed. Like my brain had been wrung out and left to dry. I still don‚Äôt rightly know what they wanted‚Äîor if they even were who they claimed to be. Hell, I don‚Äôt know nothin‚Äô for certain anymore.
   What I do know is, ever since that night, folks look at me different. Like I‚Äôm cursed or carryin‚Äô somethin‚Äô that might rub off if they get too close. I walk down Main Street and they cross the damn road, whisper behind my back like I can‚Äôt hear ‚Äòem. Like I‚Äôm some‚Ä¶ thing now. Not a man.
   But that‚Äôs alright. I got my land, my hogs, and my new pups keep me company. Ain‚Äôt much for crowds anyhow. Solitude‚Äôs quieter. Safer. ‚ÄòCept for when Harold swings by‚Äîhe‚Äôs the only one that don‚Äôt look at me like I‚Äôm contaminated.
   Still‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs this fear I can‚Äôt shake.
   That bein‚Äô‚Äîwhatever it was‚Äîit ain‚Äôt done with me. I feel it sometimes, like a shadow hangin‚Äô just outta sight. I don‚Äôt know what it wanted, or why it chose me, but I get the feelin‚Äô its message wasn‚Äôt meant for just me.
   Maybe it thinks the world‚Äôd be better off without us.
   And if that‚Äôs the truth‚Ä¶ we oughta be scared. Real scared. ‚ÄôCause they ain‚Äôt just comin‚Äô for me anymore.
   They‚Äôre comin‚Äô for us all.

I break my fast with a protein shake (33g scoop, milk, PB, maca), and then eat one home-cooked heavy meal (protein, veggies, sometimes rice).   
Every now and then I include ""healthy"" snacks too (zero sugar drinks, low-sugar cookies, etc).

This formula works very well for me, and I'm at the point of my fasting habit where I feel satiated with this amount of food.

   Then I saw it‚Äîthe bein‚Äô. Can‚Äôt rightly describe it. My mind keeps tryin‚Äô to blur the edges, like it knows better than to remember clear. But what I do remember is that needle‚Äîlong, thick, glintin‚Äô in the light like somethin‚Äô outta a nightmare.
   It jabbed it into my side without a word. Burned like fire. I felt whatever it was pumpin‚Äô into me‚Äîthick, cold, wrong. My whole body seized up. I saw, just out the corner of my eye, blood risin‚Äô around the metal, tricklin‚Äô down my skin from the puncture.
   Didn‚Äôt take long before the darkness swallowed me again.
   Next time I woke, I was in my bed. My clock read 7:56 a.m. Thursday. Three whole days gone‚Äîvanished. Felt like I‚Äôd only been out a couple hours. My head was poundin‚Äô, but worse than that‚Äîmy eye was burnin‚Äô. Throbbin‚Äô. I reached up, and instead of skin, I felt fabric.
   I shot up, stumbled to the bathroom, and there I was‚Äîstarin‚Äô at myself in the mirror. Wearin‚Äô a damn eye patch. My fingers fumbled with the fabric as I peeled it back. I was horrified. My eye‚Ä¶black and bruised. It was leaking this thick, slimy substance. 
   Stomach turned. I dropped to my knees and puked ‚Äòtil I had nothin‚Äô left but dry heaves. And that‚Äôs when it hit me‚Äîthis wasn‚Äôt no dream, no fevered nightmare. This was real. All of it.
   Lifted my shirt to check my side, and there it was. Big ol‚Äô bruise, dark as rot, with a tiny red dot dead center‚Äîlike a brand. A reminder. Proof that somethin‚Äô unnatural had touched me‚Ä¶ and left its mark.
   I didn‚Äôt know what the hell to do. I panicked, threw on some clothes, and hauled ass to the hospital. That‚Äôs where I made my first mistake.
   Doc took one look at my eye and said there was hydrogen fluoride residue in it. Said the damage was done. I‚Äôd be blind on that side for the rest of my life. But that weren‚Äôt even the worst of it. Blood tests came back showin‚Äô traces of potassium permanganate in my system‚Äîenough to kill most folks. They told me I was lucky to still be breathin‚Äô.
   They started askin‚Äô questions. What happened? Where‚Äôd it come from? And truth be told, I didn‚Äôt have no clean, sensible answer. Only thing I had was the truth‚Äîso I gave it to ‚Äòem, raw and unfiltered.
   Didn‚Äôt take long after that for a cop and some sharp-lookin‚Äô fella from the FBI to stroll into my hospital room, notepads in hand. They sat down real quiet, real still, and wrote down every damn word I said.
   Then the floodgates opened.
   Reporters, conspiracy nuts, folks with podcasts and cameras‚Äîtryin‚Äô to get a piece of me like I was some freak show exhibit. They pounded on my door, begged the nurses, even tried bribin‚Äô their way in just to ask me somethin‚Äô. Wanted their names in the mix. Wanted to profit off my nightmare.
   When I was finally released and sent home, that‚Äôs when they came. No knock. No badge. Just a line of black SUVs and men dressed head to toe in black. Not a stitch of skin showin‚Äô. Dark glasses over their eyes, even though it was cloudy as sin out. They didn‚Äôt say who they were. Didn‚Äôt have to. The way they looked at me told me everything I needed to know.
   They weren‚Äôt here to help.
   They were here to make sure I stayed quiet.
   They sat me down and asked me every which way ‚Äòbout what happened. Said they believed me‚Äîtook my word like it was gospel. Then they did somethin‚Äô strange‚Ä¶ put me under, like hypnosis or somethin‚Äô. Dug around in my head, pullin‚Äô out every scrap of memory I had ‚Äòtil I was spillin‚Äô things I didn‚Äôt even know I remembered.
   When they left, I felt hollow. Dazed. Like my brain had been wrung out and left to dry. I still don‚Äôt rightly know what they wanted‚Äîor if they even were who they claimed to be. Hell, I don‚Äôt know nothin‚Äô for certain anymore.
   What I do know is, ever since that night, folks look at me different. Like I‚Äôm cursed or carryin‚Äô somethin‚Äô that might rub off if they get too close. I walk down Main Street and they cross the damn road, whisper behind my back like I can‚Äôt hear ‚Äòem. Like I‚Äôm some‚Ä¶ thing now. Not a man.
   But that‚Äôs alright. I got my land, my hogs, and my new pups keep me company. Ain‚Äôt much for crowds anyhow. Solitude‚Äôs quieter. Safer. ‚ÄòCept for when Harold swings by‚Äîhe‚Äôs the only one that don‚Äôt look at me like I‚Äôm contaminated.
   Still‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs this fear I can‚Äôt shake.
   That bein‚Äô‚Äîwhatever it was‚Äîit ain‚Äôt done with me. I feel it sometimes, like a shadow hangin‚Äô just outta sight. I don‚Äôt know what it wanted, or why it chose me, but I get the feelin‚Äô its message wasn‚Äôt meant for just me.
   Maybe it thinks the world‚Äôd be better off without us.
   And if that‚Äôs the truth‚Ä¶ we oughta be scared. Real scared. ‚ÄôCause they ain‚Äôt just comin‚Äô for me anymore.
   They‚Äôre comin‚Äô for us all.

My name is Ander Webb, I attended a smaller public university in Louisiana, and it was my junior year. At the time I was a contracted cadet in ROTC (Reserved Officer Training Corps). My best friend and roommate Jin Schultz and I would take the freshmen under our wings and mentor them in military, personal, and academic matters. As a pair of currently enlisted Infantrymen, we felt it was our responsibility to look after the new cadets in the program. That fall we had a core group of mentee freshmen, Jake Gilbert, his new girlfriend Harley Caffery, Big Billy(we called him that as he was 6‚Äô2‚Äù 250-pound guy and a true gentle giant and I cannot remember his last name), and Barry Karnes.

Thursday October 29^(th).

ROTC leadership lab was winding down. Training was complete not that most of these cadets needed to know how to conduct the knockout a bunker battle drill, but maybe logistics officers and nurses would if guys like Jin and I were already dead, I guess.¬† The cadets were still laughing and commenting on the costumes from the battalion fun run that morning. A Hispanic cadet had painted intricate sugar skull on her face in honor of D√≠a de los Muertos, one ginger cadet came as a fairy princess with tutu, wings, and a pink crown, who am I to judge, Big Billy came as an African warlord, borrowing my maroon Airborne beret to give a ‚ÄúBeasts of no Nation‚Äù vibe with the M81 field jacket he borrowed from Jin. Jake came as a famous Tennis player and oddly his girlfriend did not coordinate. Harley came as what looked like a witch drawing symbols on herself and being dressed in black robes. This led Senior Cadet Sarabeth Walker to talk to her off to the side, Walker was very concerned due to her deep Christian faith. Jin and I came as Raiden and Scorpion respectfully from Mortal Kombat as we played as them in our ROTC tournaments and I spammed the teleport move when we‚Äôd play Injustice. As the last squads finished their period of instruction, we fell into formation for the weekend safety brief. Cadet Battalion Commander Peason told us she loved the creativity from the costume run and was happy we took to her idea so enthusiastically. For the safety portion of the safety brief, she reminded us that even though majority of the cadets were civilians still, they should not get into trouble this weekend as that could bar them from contracting as a future officer in the Army.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt add or subtract from the local population, there done.‚Äù Whispered Jin next to me in formation loud enough our squad could hear but Cadet Pearson up front could not with 3 ranks between us and her. A handful of snorts of laughter responded from our squad and the squad in front of us as the cadets attempted to maintain military bearing.

‚ÄúOr just don‚Äôt get caught.‚Äù I replied just for Jin‚Äôs ears.

We broke formation after the command to dismiss was given. Jin pulled our mentees aside as I stood next to him.

‚ÄúNow we don‚Äôt care what y‚Äôall do this weekend but be safe and smart about it.‚Äù Jin started with a caring and authoritative tone.

‚ÄúStay with friends and keep a battle buddy, just cause y‚Äôall are under the age doesn‚Äôt mean we are under the illusion that you won‚Äôt be drinking, especially you Karnes, I know your frat has a costume party Saturday.‚Äù I said providing my observations of our Cadets‚Äô social lives. Karnes gave a look of fain shock at the insinuation that he was drinking at 18.

Kwan jumped in as if we rehearsed this, we had not, we just spent so much time together we knew when to continue sentences. ‚ÄúIf at any point you are in trouble and need a QRF to come save your asses, call me or Webb and we will be there in 7 minutes to anywhere in town or on Campus.‚Äù

‚ÄúOther than that, have a good Halloween this Saturday and see y‚Äôall Monday morning for PT.‚Äù I concluded just in time as Cadet Walker came over.

‚ÄúCadet Webb, Cadet Schultz, Mr. Clark asked me to have you two maintenance and hook up the new propane tank to the grill behind the armory.‚Äù She asked in her firm polite way when she would hide her meek nature.

‚ÄúOf course, he asked for us.‚Äù I laughed. ‚ÄúJin and I always get the ‚Äòhey you tasks‚Äô.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou two are probably the most reliable and capable cadets we have on campus Ander.‚Äù She said dropping the formality to the caring way that reminded me when we were close.

Jin turned to us after our mentees left and headed to their cars, ‚ÄúHey Walker, do you care if Webb comes over Saturday when Annalee and I hang out?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course not, we can all hang out and watch some scary movies.‚Äù If she had any objections to me coming over, she did not show it. Jin was dating Sarabeth‚Äôs older sister Annalee. Sarabeth and I had dated at the end of the previous semester. I had spent the past months getting over being sent back to the friendzone by her before our summer apart due to military training. I knew it was over, she was dating a guy 12 years older than us from the city an hour north of campus that was an overly charismatic Christian that made my lukewarm faith look like more heathen than any form of holy. But the continued texting and overly friendly contact for 5 months since break up made me want to be a better man. Mixed signals are an understatement.

Sarabeth left the armory while Jin and I cleaned the grill and installed the new propane tank to the old gas grill behind the armory that had been in disrepair since we started attending school two years before. Gave it a good test fire with my zippo to ensure it was working too for good measure, the next home game for the football team was in two weeks and we did not want our work to be in vain when the program would be feeding the cadets and veterans at the upcoming Veterans Day game. We jabbed each other with jokes about everything under the sun as we drove to our apartment across from the campus before cracking open a few Yuengling‚Äôs and fired up our Xbox‚Äôs for a late night of COD Black Ops II Zombies, and Battlefield 4.

Thus Thursday night went.

Friday October 30^(th).

Friday, I had a couple of classes Roman, and Medieval history and Jin‚Äôs Engineering program after which another night of drinking and gaming, as Jin texted Annalee and I just tried to enjoy the night.

Saturday October 31^(st).

The day was about as normal as Halloween in a Louisiana college town could be, 75 degrees and 100% humidity. Jin and I went to Walmart across town to get some food to bring to the Walker sister‚Äôs house and liquor to relax with. We were checking out when we saw Harley checking out with what looked like a cutting board some craft supplies.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you tried to sleep with her bro.‚Äù I jabbed at Jin.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt either, I wasn‚Äôt thinking with my head.‚Äù Jin retorted as he bagged the bottle of Jameson from the casher, the ‚Äúgood stuff‚Äù our meager Sergeants pay would allow.

‚ÄúYou were, just the wrong one.‚Äù I chided back. Jin gave a hearty chuckle at that.

Later that evening we drove my 1997 Ford Explorer over to the Walkers house, a small weathered white house on cinderblocks. Jin and Annalee embraced while Sarabeth and I took the food and drinks to the kitchen in the back.

The evening was enjoyable, played some Settlers of Catan, the flirtation between Jin and Annalee was hilarious. Sarabeth was on the phone with her boyfriend for most of the evening, while she did that and the happy couple cleaned the dishes together I took the trash to the curb. I considered grabbing my small pocket Bible out of the center console of my car to appear more pious but decided that was a hollow useless thing to do. After Sarabeth finishing her phone call, she suggested that we watch Sleepy Hallow with Johnny Depp. I was apparently the only person that had not seen it, the only horror movie I had seen before was The Exorcist, I did not like scary movies at the time. My male bravado told me to just suck it up as the movie begun. Looking back, I was such a little bitch for thinking Sleepy Hallow would be scary, underrated Tim Burton movie honestly. Jin and Annalee cuddled on the couch as I ceded the recliner to Sarabeth and pulled up and dining room chair. The movie was enjoyable, Casper Van Dean had just died on screen (RIP Johnny Rico) when Jin got a phone call, it was around 2200.

He stood up and responded with, ‚ÄúHey Big Billy, what up bro?‚Äù as he rounded the corner of the living room into the kitchen out of earshot. Annalee paused the movie expecting that we would continue it momentarily.

All I heard over Jins pacing was ‚ÄúWait what? How‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs that sound? We are coming.‚Äù

He strode back into the living room with the grim determination that our profession beat into us, the tone was all business.

‚ÄúWebb up.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on bud?‚Äù I responded as I stood up with the sense of urgency that was felt throughout the room.

‚ÄúBig Billy called, somethings wrong at Harley‚Äôs apartment, I‚Äôll brief you enroute.‚Äù Jin‚Äôs switch from puppy love to mission ready in a second flat, I felt that unease from the beginning of the night and something was up. He turned to Annalee and told her everything is ok and we just needed to teach the freshmen about the importance pacing themselves at Frat parties. Sarabeth offered a couple bottles of Pedialyte she had for after ruck marches.

‚ÄúIts ok I don‚Äôt think its needed.‚Äù Jin responded politely. I knew he was hiding something from the girls.

I told Sarabeth bye and she grabbed my arm and said, ‚ÄúThere is something wrong with this, please be safe.‚Äù

I felt my skin tighten as I stood in the doorway as if I was in a freezer, not in the humid night that is the American South.

‚ÄúI have a weird feeling too but it‚Äôs probably just a Jake or Harley discovering Everclear, see you soon.‚Äù

Jin and I walked to my car with purpose through the still muggy night, I turned my head and could see both sisters standing in the doorway with the look of concern on their faces. Once in my rundown Explorer turned over, I firmly asked, ‚ÄúWhat are we getting into?‚Äù

Jin let a short exhale out and looked at me with a level of concern that I only saw the past summer during the Red River floods when we were activated for high water rescue.

‚ÄúHead to Harley‚Äôs apartment with urgency once we make the corner and are out of sight, don‚Äôt scare the girls.‚Äù

I put the car in drive and headed to the intersection then gunned it down University Boulevard towards the side of the campus that Harley lived in.

He continued, ‚ÄúBig Billy is at Harley‚Äôs apartment trying to help Jake, Barry is leaving his frats party to help him but its‚Ä¶ weird.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs weird?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou got your Bible?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, why?‚Äù

‚ÄúHarley built a Ouija board after we saw her at Walmart this morning and wanted to have some fun with it and Jake thought it would be a fun way to hangout on Halloween. She‚Äôs acting strange and Jake‚Äôs freaking out and Big Billy is out of his depth.‚Äù

I knew this was not a joke. On school breaks and between National Guard training and natural disasters during the summers I worked at Target stocking shelves. There the infamous Ouija boards are sold for ages 8 and up. They would be found in the morning having fallen off the shelf and routinely throughout the day laying on the ground. Both Jin and I were raised by Christian families that instilled in us an understanding of how things like that could open a door that could not be easily closed. Both of us might have lived a heathen lifestyle as young grunts but our upbringing still held, and his Korean mother taught him to avoid the supernatural as one‚Äôs soul is easy to lose to other worldly forces.

‚ÄúWhat was the weird noise on the phone?‚Äù I inquired.

‚ÄúI don't know.‚Äù Jin responded with grim determination.

As we were speeding across campus Jin scanned locations Campus Police were known to sit and wait. I silently hoped they were busy at Greek row and not over by the dorms.

We parked in the first open spot we could find inside the gated dorms 500 feet from Harley‚Äôs. I grabbed my Bible from the car putting it in my back pocket and followed Jin to Harley‚Äôs Dorm which was on the second floor and closest to the stairs that access the floor. As we approached, we could hear screaming, we looked at each other with hesitance. We were trained to charge into combat but the screams of a girl and the possibility of an God knows what gave us pause, then we knocked.

The screaming stopped. We knocked again, and heard footsteps approach from behind the door and Big Billy opened it looking exhausted and color drained from his face.

‚ÄúGuys you‚Äôre here, she just stopped fucking screaming and‚Ä¶‚Äù Billy rambled off without a breath.

‚ÄúWhen, where, and how did this start.‚Äù I interrupted.

He pointed at the coffee table that was covered with a handful of crosses and crucifixes. ‚ÄúHarley wanted to summon a ghost and Jake, and I played along with it. That was 30 minutes before I called y‚Äôall. Nothing happened until she drew symbols on her arm like she did for the costume run on Thursday. After that, the room got cold, and Harley started acting weird‚Ä¶‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúWeird how, details Billy.‚Äù Interrupted Jin.

I could hear Jake in the bedroom talking to Harley with no responses.

‚ÄúUmm she started to shake then eyes rolled for a couple seconds,‚Äù Billy gathered his thoughts, ‚Äúshe then stood up and took the board outside and we did not see where she went. Then she came back and fucking freaked out, she started screaming and muttering some shit Jake and couldn‚Äôt understand. She then hit Jake and started to look for something in the kitchen.‚Äù

‚ÄúJin go check the room with Jake.‚Äù I commanded, Jin moved immediately. ‚ÄúWhy are there crosses on the table?‚Äù

‚ÄúJake told me to grab whatever I could to repel whatever was summoned since that‚Äôs where it happened.‚Äù Billy responded.

A loud scream and impact came from the bedroom; I rushed in with Billy behind me to see Jake standing in the corner with terror on his face and Jin slumped against the wall as if he just got hit by a linebacker. Harley stood next to her bed all 5‚Äô1‚Äù and 98 pounds of her recoiling after what looked like a shotput throw.

‚ÄúHarley where is the board?‚Äù I asked in a calm authoritative voice.

‚Äú*None of your concern*.‚Äù She responded with an unnatural tone compared to her normal docile voice.

Thinking quickly as Jin stood back up, seeing Harleys keys in her right sweatpants pocket, I took a chance asking, ‚ÄúIs it in your car?‚Äù

She turned her attention directly to me with a rage in her eyes that confirmed my hunch. Jin saw this too and we knew what came next. Under normal circumstances Jin and my 6‚Äô3‚Äù 200-pound physiques would easily overpower Harley, but as Jin already found out she was stronger than her body should be, she failed every event on the physical fitness test we had taken a month ago which we were helping her improve on. This was going to hurt.

‚ÄúWe need her keys, don‚Äôt try to hurt her.‚Äù I ordered the men in the room with me, and they understood as Big Billy and Jin lunged at Harley taking an arm each, that was before she tossed Billy off like he was a discarded towel, Jin‚Äôs attempt found purchase as he had grasped her left arm, the arm with the strange markings. Jake followed in Billys wake jumping over him as he clung to her right arm. I moved quickly, covering the 8 feet between myself and Harley to body check her into the bed to give us the advantage in this most bizarre struggle. Thinking the upper hand was gained I felt two feet plant on my chest and before I could comprehend what she was doing I was airborne and flew 6 feet landing feet, ass, head on the dorm room‚Äôs cheap carpet that did little to soften the uncontrolled fall. Billy, already up rushing past me to achieve control of her legs as I recovered. There was something else at work here. I pushed between Jake and Billy and plunged my hand into her right pants pocket gripping hold of the car keys.

‚ÄúGot them!‚Äù I bellowed, and Jin immediately let go of her arm and we rushed for the door out. Behind us I heard two loud collisions, one against a wall and one I saw the result of, Big Billy once again thrown to the ground. I tossed Harley‚Äôs keys to Jin as he passed me in the doorway with him giving me a nod of understanding. He was halfway down the stairs when I vaulted myself over the railing to make up any lost time as I could hear the screams coming for us. Landing as I was trained to as a paratrooper feet, thigh, back and with a roll to keep the momentum I saw Harley coming for me like an predator that was to overwhelm its prey. The atmosphere was no longer still, the trees were being whipped by high winds and the howling was audible like in a thunderstorm. In fully sprint with her gaining I caught sight of Barry coming around the Dorm buildings corner.

‚ÄúWhat the fucks going on I was hitting it off with a...‚Äù He called with an annoyed tone. He must‚Äôve not been given the situation from Big Billy.

‚ÄúFucking run!‚Äù I bellowed back as I approached him.

He saw Harley giving chase and caught on as he attempted to catch up to me.

‚ÄúDouble back to her apartment help the guys.‚Äù I ordered as we were almost to my car. He split off as Harley stopped 20 feet from me as I slid into my driver‚Äôs seat. She screamed a throaty and gut-wrenching bellow that made me wish I had more than a pocketknife on me. She turned and took off in the direction Jin took towards what I assessed to be her car and the infernal Ouija board. I pulled out of the parking space driving parallel to her new direction of pursuit. There was a block of apartment style dorms between us, but I was betting on Jin taking an obscured route back to my car for exfil. I was right our mutual base level instincts brought him directly to me. I stopped and Jin carrying what to any casual observer looked to be a cutting board quickly jumped in the passenger seat.

‚ÄúFucking drive bro!‚Äù He yelled mere feet from my face as I looked past him and saw the petite figure was 40 feet behind him in relentless pursuit bellowing the same primal roar as before. We took off and whatever being was watching over us must have had some pity on us as the gate was open allowing us to get out of the confined parting lot and on to the street.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck was that about? This can‚Äôt be what I think it is.‚Äù Jin said between labored breaths.

‚ÄúI am scared it is exactly that, but I am having a really hard time believing it.‚Äù I said in response between my own attempts at catching my breath. ‚ÄúCall the Walkers, ask if we can come back and if they have an idea of what to do with this thing, they go to church way more than us.‚Äù

Jin dialed Annalee and she picked up on the second ring, ‚ÄúHey, all‚Äôs good.‚Äù He lied. ‚ÄúDo y‚Äôall mind if we come back over, we have a Ouija board that needs to be destroyed.‚Äù

I could hear the shock and rejection of that proposal without the phone being on speaker. Jin tried to argue with what sounded like both sisters as I drove around campus waiting on a plan to form.

‚ÄúOk, yeah prayers would be great, and I think we can do that, thanks bye baby.‚Äù Jin said finishing the call. ‚ÄúWell, they don‚Äôt want this shit anywhere near them and said their only knowledge of the matter is to burn it and bury the ashes.‚Äù

I turned on the next street I saw and without saying a word headed to the ROTC armory.

‚ÄúDing‚Äù

‚ÄúGreat Harley‚Äôs texting me.‚Äù Jin said sarcastically opening his phone. ‚ÄúIt says ‚Äò*Do not destroy it, bring it back, you cannot stop what we started.*‚Äô Well that‚Äôs concerning.‚Äù

I nodded to the phone, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs talking in plural now?‚Äù

Jin replied with a puzzled reaction reading the latest text, ‚Äú‚Äô*I will not be banished by you, she‚Äôs mine.‚Äô* Bro what fucked up Supernatural episode are we in?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know bud.‚Äù I replied as I pulled sloppily into the lower parking lot of the ROTC Armory.

We rushed up the stairs that connected the parking lot to the porch with the grill. Jin pulled the cover off and tossed me the lighter fluid and I started spraying it on the board.

‚ÄúBro there‚Äôs no lighter, and she‚Äôs calling.‚Äù Jin lamented, the pressure was getting to him, I was on edge too.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt answer her. I‚Äôve got mine in the car.‚Äù I responded as I ran down the hill to retrieve my Zippo.

The cacophony of text message notifications and phone call rings could be heard both up and down the hill as the desperation could be felt from whatever Harley had become to get the board back. Jin had placed the board on the grill rack, I could smell the lighter fluid, and he crouched down ready to turn on the gas as I flicked the lighter and held the flame next to the board.

It did not light.

‚ÄúWhat to ever loving fuck!‚Äù Jin shouted in disbelief. He looked at his phone and read. ‚Äú*I see you.*‚Äù We turned to our west and we could see her dorm a half a mile away across the cross-country track and we realized we had minutes from her arriving if she headed this way.

‚ÄúCall the guys and tell them keep her distracted.‚Äù I told Jin as I gathered pine straw off the ground. He did so and reported, ‚ÄúThey see her, and they will keep her from the gate on this side of the dorms, hopefully she can‚Äôt jump 15-foot fences.‚Äù

With my improvised torch of pine straw, I lit it protecting it from the wind and the flame started, Jin turned the knob on the grill and the propane lite.

The broad still wouldn‚Äôt light.

‚ÄúAnder,‚Äù Jin said in frustration barely above a whisper the wind nearly drowned out, ‚Äúhow?‚Äù

We stared at the unburnt board, and I pulled out my Bible that was now covered in sweat to and moist to the touch after being in my jeans for the past 15 minutes of chaos and flipped through it blindly for something I did not know what. I landed seemingly at random on Matthew 6:9.

I opened my mouth seeing the red text, ‚ÄúOur Father‚Ä¶‚Äù

Immediately with the rage of a wildfire the board erupted into flame. Jin threw the grills lid closed singeing some arm hair in the process.

With a reaction that displayed exhaustion, surprise, and relief he told me, ‚ÄúKeep reading.‚Äù

So, I read the rest of the Lords Prayer, the Beatitudes, Psalm 23, and anything with red text that caught my eye over the sound of the hollowing wind.

After two minutes we opened the lid.

The wood that was the board was charcoal and the vinyl letters that had been glued on melted away, except for the bottom portion that was still perfectly in place but just as blackened and cracked as the rest of the wood, it read ‚Äú*GOODBYE*.‚Äù

I took my knife out, striking downward with the butt of my knife, the board shattered into ash.

‚ÄúDing‚Äù

Jin looked down at his phone as the wind died down to the calm the night was less than 30 minutes ago. ‚ÄúHarley texted and said, ‚Äòthanks for destroying it.‚Äô How does she know that you just destroyed it?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo clue.‚Äù I shrugged not wanting to say what I believed in my soul it really was.

We gathered the ashes and buried them in the roots of a tree that fell over during the last hurricane. Called Big Billy after Barry and Jake had not answered, he happily reported Jake was asleep on the couch in their dorm and Harley passed out after the wind stopped and they put her in her own bed and tucked a cross next to her for good measure. Barry apparently went back to his frat party and might be drunk. The Walker sisters were glad we were ok as we left most of the details out. We drove back to our apartment while telling them goodnight over the phone. We got into the apartment and Jin collapsed on to the couch while I walked over to the counter and grabbed the bottle of Jameson, which Jin upon seeing that reached his hand out in a ‚Äúbring it here‚Äù motion. He opened it and took a long swig as I sunk into the couch next to him. He handed me the bottle, and I took my own deep chug of whiskey.

‚ÄúDude I do not know what just happened, lets just forget all of it.‚Äù Jin said all energy drained from his voice and demeanor.

‚ÄúI think it was something very bad.‚Äù I responded.

‚ÄúThis shit only happens in horror movies, not in reality.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe just saw all that and you‚Äôre saying we didn‚Äôt experience it?‚Äù

The bottle was being passed back and forth like a reverse talking stick.

¬†‚ÄúEither way I am going to get drunk and forget about this night.‚Äù Jin responded.

‚ÄúWell I‚Äôll join you in that endeavor brother. Also I think I‚Äôm Sam and your Dean.‚Äù

‚ÄúBet.‚Äù Jin replied with his characteristic mischievous nature finally returning.

We finished the bottle and passed out into our separate rooms. From that night nobody talked about it or remembered the details of the night. The Walker sisters did not pry into what we did or what happened to cause an impromptu burning of a Ouija board. Jake and Harley continued dating, why we did not know, but we made plenty of crazy girl jokes as to that. But they never revisited the events of that Halloween night. Jin, to the last day we ever talked in 2020 denied the events of that night ever happened.

This period of time that only I recall makes me more concerned and suspicious regarding the nature of what came through the door that was opened that night.

1m8dpuv,https://www.reddit.com/r/EstrangedAdultChild/comments/1m8dpuv/reopening_the_gates_is_a_multipart_process_and_it/,"Re-opening the gates is a multi-part process, and it can stop at any point","I ªve written this in comments before, but wanted to share it as a post for quick reference. [After 30 years of successful estrangement ](https://www.reddit.com/r/EstrangedAdultChild/comments/1lwx9ld/insights_gained_30_years_of_estrangement/)\-meaning that during this time, I became a better human being. Like many of you, I have also had the unfortunate experience of [opening up the gates now and again. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/EstrangedAdultChild/comments/1ekidnx/estrangement_is_a_reminder_that_opening_the_gates/)

So I wanted to address the issue of opening up the dam of communication again -whether it ªs initiated by the other party or yourself. A lot of you will have received a series of texts that range for apologetic to guilt-inducing. Some will promise you the moon, others will try to shame you into talking to them. *Neither is good enough.*

*Forgiveness* isn ªt the end all, and it ªs not always attainable. Forgiveness has to be rooted in *a sense of justice* or it's not real. When someone has done something egregious, it has cost you dearly. Vice versa, it goes for us too. The justice would start as an acknowledgement of what it cost you. Their listening without seeking revenge would be an example of not only you getting some justice by talking about what their behavior has cost you, but it would also be their way of paying down their debt. They can ªt fulfill their moral duty without paying their¬†*moral debt*. Where this gets messy is if they offer you things, and often they do it to open the conversation: Money, trips, gifts. *Don ªt let them get away with it because here is no shortcut to listening, and trying to understand how they have hurt you.*

Once you two have reached a point where both of you understand the picture, you might decide to release them from any further moral debt. They listened, they have not sought revenge by trying to blame you or others. They understand the gravity of what they caused, and you have some insight into them.  No, it ªs not perfect, but I have even said, to myself and to them: ""I release you."" ( from further debt).

*However,* this¬†*does not mean*¬†that they have earned your trust, or that you will continue the relationship.¬†*You can stop here if you want.*¬†(Frankly, I didn't even get to the first part of this with my estranged family, but I did with a close friend. And note, do this wisely. It might be that having a therapist present, or 1:1 agreeing to do it over coffee a few times is best. It doesn't have to be in one fell swoop.

The next part is *Reconciliation.* As in, *""I'm going to give you an inch and see where this goes.""*  
Piece by piece, I'm going to give you a little more if things work out. But all along, by your behavior, I'll be asking myself: Can I trust you? Are you trustworthy? Can you or I demonstrate trust, and do we learn to trust each other and ourselves. Do all of this wisely. Because it can all blow up here, and often does.  
(This is often the point where they will jump the gun and offer you money, gifts, or things. It ªs up to you if you want to take them, but *it still doesn ªt mean they ªve earned that inch*) You might find them pleasant and okay to talk to. But it doesn ªt mean they have your trust.

The last part is *Restoration*. Restoration is where both of you have reached an understanding, and respect one another to be trustworthy to oneself and each other. A lot of relationships never reach this point -I never did with my estranged family, but I did with some friends -people I consider family now. *Restoration takes faith, is guided not only by principles, but by love, and wishing them peace, in spite of whatever happened in the past*. Restoration is wanting to go forward with that person in your life, at whatever level. The two of you welcome one another.

*There isn't a timeline for any of this.* It can take days or years. Only you will know what to do. But it would help --if they ªre really serious, that they understand the concept of moral debt and how it can't be paid with money, gifts or things. If they know you can ªt be bought, then they will stop seeing you as a financial debt. It takes that power away from such generosity, but doing so allows you to approach them on a more level field.

So there are steps. And it takes time. And it can stall or stop at any point on this timeline.

I send you peace, and love, and hope that you will take your time.",3,1753385051.0,EstrangedAdultChild,1,1.0,False

***...FEAST‚Ä¶***

I jolt awake from the sudden pain emanating from deep within my abdomen. Sweat drips down from my brow as I blink it away from seeping into my eyes, attempting to ascertain what time it is. The soft, red glow of my alarm clock greets my tired eyes. 02:41 AM. Maybe I can try to get just a few more hours of rest before work. I slip back under the soft down comforter, attempting to find any amount of respite as my eyelids slowly close.

***‚Ä¶FEED‚Ä¶***

Another sharp pain stabs my gut, keeping me from getting comfortable. Groaning, I throw the blanket off from my sweaty body, letting it fall to the floor. Frustration floods my body as I stand up, leaving the comfort of my bed. A human-sized sweat stain on the fitted sheet greets me as I glance back. I normally get night sweats so it‚Äôs probably just from my room being so hot or too many blankets or whatever, though this seems a bit much. My boxers feel soaked from the sweat. Grabbing a new pair, I slip off the old ones and put on the new pair before getting into my red and black plaid pajama pants. Better.

***‚Ä¶CONSUME‚Ä¶***

I nearly trip down the hall as my stomach turns over itself. Pressing down onto my stomach, it *feels* empty. *Fuck, I gotta eat.* The door to the refrigerator rattles open as the inside light bathes the tiny motor home kitchen in a dull yellow glow. *Pickles‚Ä¶? No‚Ä¶ Maybe some strawberries‚Ä¶? Fuck they‚Äôre moldy‚Ä¶* The garbage can shutters as the container of strawberries, typically a bright red, now mottled with fuzzy white fungus, slams into the bottom of it. My hand grasps an open bottle of half-drunk of Pabst Blue Ribbon. Downing it in only a few gulps, the bottle clatters to the floor as another pain tears through my belly, bringing me to my knees. *Ugh‚Ä¶ Fuck‚Ä¶* Then, my eyes rest upon seemingly the only thing that looks somewhat appetizing: a package of meat, wrapped up in saran wrap. Some manufactured amalgamation of various animals: deer, pig, cow, maybe horse. The tender red flesh beckons me to‚Ä¶

***‚Ä¶DEVOUR‚Ä¶***

My hands act on their own accord, grabbing the package with great force. My fingers rip into the plastic containing the slab of meat, releasing it from it‚Äôs prison. Without another thought, my teeth sliced through the soft and tender flesh. Euphoria fills my body as my taste buds savor every taste it can sense. The salty taste combined with an almost copper-y undertone. The last remnants of blood dripped out of my meal before it was even packaged, though *I* could still taste it. Scraps of meat fall out of my maw as my teeth gnash and tear at the lab-grown meat. I don‚Äôt care how fake it is. I *needed* this.

I fall onto my back, staring up at the slowly decaying ceiling of my trailer. Tiny strips of my meal dot the floor around me. Licking my fingers clean, I let out a long sigh. *Total bliss.* My hunger pains have all but faded away as my vision begins to fade to black. The rhythmic sound of my breathing, in and out, in and out, slowly but surely, lulls me to a deep sleep.

Light blinds me as I blink awake from my restful sleep. The cold linoleum flooring sends goosebumps all across my body. Sitting up, my eyes widen as I find the remains of my escapades earlier that morning. Scraps of rotting meat and broken and empty beer bottles are all scattered across the floor. The fridge door bumps into my shin as I realize it had been left open. My groggy mind has trouble trying to remember the events of last night, or this morning, what time is it anyways? My legs shake beneath me as I achingly pull myself up from off of the floor.

***‚Ä¶HUNGER‚Ä¶***

I almost fall back down to the floor as pain shoots through my abdomen once again. It‚Äôs like I got gut-punched and then stabbed with a Bowie knife.

‚ÄúNRRGHH‚Ä¶‚Äù

I can‚Äôt hold back my vocalization this time. Do I really have to eat again? Was that not enough for me? I shake my head and begin to brew some coffee, maybe that will help. As the coffee slowly begins to drip down into the pot, I hobble back into my bedroom. *That‚Äôs odd, I didn‚Äôt hear my alarm.* The black and red digital clock that rests on my nightstand stares back at me: 11:08 AM. *Shit‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm really late for work.* In a panic, I dig through my closet, not much wider than me despite my lanky appearance. I pull out my cleanest light blue polo and black pants and quickly slip them on.

Rushing to the bathroom, my reflection nearly makes me jump out of my skin. My eyes, the typical white sclera, are completely bloodshot. My already visible cheekbones are accentuated, with deep indents in my cheeks. Straight brown hair that drapes down to my shoulders, is starting to thin, exposing more of my forehead and scalp. *What the fuck?* I grab a comb and attempt to pull back my hair into a ponytail, trying to make myself look presentable. Chunks of hair are retched free from my skull, tangled up in the teeth of my comb. It falls from my hand and into the sink, as I stare at the tangled mess now lying in my bathroom sink.

I shake myself from my shocked stupor, realizing I *need* to get to work. I pull back whatever hair is left in my head into a tight pony, grabbing an almost empty bottle of eye drops that I usually used for my terrible allergies, and squeezing a few drops into my crimson-stained eyes. A silent scream escapes my mouth as my eyes burn as if lit aflame. Blinking the liquid into them, I persevere. Rushing out of the bathroom, I quickly fill my banged up travel mug with dark coffee and sprint out of my trailer home.

Thankfully, my work isn‚Äôt too far. Living in a trailer park so close to the city has some benefits, like a bus stop just a half mile down the road. I check my watch in a panic as I reach the stop. 11:21 AM*. Okay, just a few minutes and the bus will be here.* Sure enough, the massive blue and gray hued bus slowly pulls to a stop in front of me and I rush on, finding a seat near the front.

***‚Ä¶CRAVING‚Ä¶***

A weak groan escapes from my lips as I keel over in pain. My stomach feels like it‚Äôs starting to eat itself. I manage to collect myself and look around, there‚Äôs maybe three others on the bus and none of them are staring. *Good.* Leaning back, I take a swig of coffee in a meager attempt to sate my hunger.

The bus ride feels like an eternity. I‚Äôm constantly checking my watch at each stop until we finally reach mine at 11:57 AM. I stand up and sprint out the door, before slowing and briskly walking into the office.

The front doors swing open as I rush inside. Samantha, the receptionist begins to greet me before looking up and stopping mid sentence.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Luke‚Ä¶? Is everything-‚Äù

I cut her off before she can get another word out.

‚ÄúYes, Sam, I‚Äôm fine.‚Äù I rush past her desk and begin to walk through the rows of cubicles. The entire office is quiet, save for the clacking of fingers against plastic key caps and the eerie sound of hushed conversations with words I could barely make out. Though, even that comes to a halt as a few faces look up and stare at me with various expressions. Some of concern, others of confusion, and one of anger. That of my boss, Wesley. As soon as I sit down in my cubicle, my travel mug slamming down onto my desk, my work phone gives a soft ring. Begrudgingly, my hand rests upon the cold plastic of the phone for a moment. The tiny LCD screen gives a name: Merrow, Wesley. Picking it up, the speaker rests softly against my ear.

‚ÄúMy office, please.‚Äù

I hang up, a clattering sound reverberates against my cubicle walls. My chair rolls out from under me as I stand up and make my way to Wesley‚Äôs office. A glass cube that sits at the front of the office, like a king‚Äôs throne giving him a view of all of his meager subjects. I softly knock on the glass door, my knuckle clinging against it. A voice booms from within.

‚ÄúCome in.‚Äù

I swing the door open, and enter the office. Wesley‚Äôs desk, carved from some dark wood and ornately carved with oriental designs, rests at the back, with him sitting behind it, hands folded on it.

‚ÄúNice of you to join us, Luke. How are you feeling? Please, have a seat.‚Äù

His fake-nice voice fills me with anger. His nameplate staring at me: ‚ÄúWesley Merrow, C.E.O.‚Äù with the company‚Äôs logo in the corner, a computer with an airplane flying around it. Wesley stares at me with a piercing look, his sharp blue eyes burrowing into my skull. His mouth is agape in a toothy smile, with perfectly white teeth. He gestures for me to sit across from him and I do.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry for being late, Wesley. I had a-‚Äù

His voice cuts through mid-sentence, shutting me off.

‚ÄúYou know we all take this job very seriously, right Mr. McCarmic? What we do here is very, *very*, important. And I‚Äôm sure you of all people knows that.‚Äù

My fists ball up in my lap, just out of view of Wesley‚Äôs evil stare. I could rip his throat out, just to shut him up. Ripping and tearing into his flesh, hearing his screams echo against the walls of his glass prison. If only I didn‚Äôt need this shitty job so much at this shitty company working under a shitty boss.

‚ÄúYes, sir, I do. I‚Äôm just-‚Äù

Once again, Wesley cuts me off, not allowing me to get another word out.

‚ÄúGood. Then you must understand how far behind on your quota for this month is, correct?‚Äù

I take a deep breath in, trying to keep my rage in check. I had fallen behind with my quota due to Wesley throwing more and more work at me over the past few weeks. Yet, he just wants to make my life a living hell.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Yes, sir, I do.‚Äù I‚Äôm getting tired of trying to explain myself.

Wesley sits back in his high back chair, modeled to look like a lord‚Äôs throne, and gives me a soft grin. I could tell he enjoyed my response.

‚ÄúAlright, Luke. Any more mess-ups and you *will* be terminated. Do I make myself clear?‚Äù A sadistic smile falls across his face. *God* I want to kill him.

‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äù I dejectedly stand up from the chair and make my leave, returning to my cubicle. The computer screen, big and bulky and takes up most of my desk, stares blankly at me. MY sullen face reflected back at me. A small tinge of pain shoots through my gut once again. I grip it in silent pain and lean my head down onto my desk. A knock on my cubicle wall shoots me back up into position.

‚ÄúHey, Luke. You feelin‚Äô alright?‚Äù Trey sticks his head up over my cubicle. His voice sounds genuine. I don‚Äôt blame him, I probably look like shit.

‚ÄúOh, uh, yeah. I‚Äôm okay. Just had a rough night.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know Trey that well and didn‚Äôt want to word vomit all over him with information he probably didn‚Äôt need or want to know. I also still don‚Äôt really know what happened.

Trey enters around the side and leans up against the divider between my cubicle and my neighbor‚Äôs. ‚ÄúAlright buddy.‚Äù He puts his hand on my shoulder briefly before leaving. ‚ÄúOh, we‚Äôre all going out for dinner tonight. Wanted to see if you were interested?‚Äù

The word ‚Äúdinner‚Äù sets my stomach off and a loud ***GROWL*** emanates from it. ‚ÄúI dunno‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been feeling a bit under the weather.‚Äù I *do* feel sick, but that‚Äôs not the main reason why I don‚Äôt want to go. What if I have another‚Ä¶ outburst? Episode? I don‚Äôt even know what to call it.

‚ÄúC‚Äômon, it‚Äôll be good for you. Samantha is going too.‚Äù He says in an almost sing-song voice, like a siren drawing in sailors to their doom. ‚ÄúI know you two have a thing going on, right?‚Äù He‚Äôs right. Samantha and I went out for one date a few months back. There‚Äôs a little bit of a spark but I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs anything. But I could use companionship, and she is pretty cute.

‚ÄúAlright, alright, I‚Äôll go. Where and when?‚Äù

Trey fist bumps the air. His young stature jumped up in the air. ‚ÄúYes! Alright, it‚Äôs gonna be at Vic‚Äôs. You know where that‚Äôs at right? In downtown? We‚Äôre all meeting there at 6 PM.‚Äù He starts to walk off before quickly spinning back around. ‚ÄúDo‚Ä¶ Do you need a ride? I could come get you.‚Äù

I shake my head. ‚ÄúNah, it‚Äôs alright, I‚Äôll just take the bus or something.‚Äù I‚Äôm still too self-conscious to tell anyone where I live. Everyone thinks for the most part that I‚Äôm some well put together person living in a studio apartment deep in the high rise buildings of downtown.

‚ÄúOkie dokie! See you there!‚Äù Trey walks off back to his cubicle. *What the fuck am I doing?* I shouldn‚Äôt be going out, especially since I have zero clue as to what‚Äôs going on with me.

Lunch rolls around and some people get up and go into the break room or their cars to eat. I completely forgot to bring some food with me so I decided to go down to the vending machine.

Browsing the snacks, there‚Äôs not really anything that‚Äôs catching my eye, yet I‚Äôm starving. Packs of lightly salted peanuts, bags of Doritos, Lays, Cheez-Its, and others all stare back at me. Nothing. I decided to just get a can of soda. I only have 3 more hours left, I should be fine.

Deciding on what to get, a body bumps into me that nearly makes me jump out of my skin.

‚ÄúHey, Luke. Whatcha getting?‚Äù

It‚Äôs Samantha. Her beautiful, hazel eyes look at me with wonder. Her dirty blonde hair softly flows down past her shoulders, barely reaching the middle of her back. Her lips are‚Ä¶ so beautiful‚Ä¶ Her soft, fair skin just‚Ä¶ so‚Ä¶

‚Äú‚Ä¶Luke?‚Äù

I noticed that I was staring for too long. I shake my head clear and blink rapidly. ‚ÄúSorry, Sam. I, uh, I think I might just get a Surge.‚Äù My mouth fills with saliva, my eyes drift across her body, tracing the light brown freckles on her cheeks that trail down to her chin. Her neck is so slender and smooth‚Ä¶

‚ÄúOh, I forgot we have that one! Excuse me.‚Äù

Samantha brushes in front of me. Her perfume wafts into my nostrils and I nearly lose all focus and concentration on trying to not appear like a freak. I notice she gives me a small wink, trying to make sure no one else sees. Her slender body rubs against me, only just for a moment, and I try my best to fight every urge to grab her. Her skin just looks‚Ä¶ so‚Ä¶

***‚Ä¶DELICIOUS‚Ä¶***

I take a huge step back, can of soda in hand and quickly turn away. I just need to finish my work day and get back home.

I (f27) recently got told by my partner (m28) of almost 8 years, that he isn't sure if he wants to be with me anymore. We have a 2 yr old and I'm currently pregnant with our second child. What can I do?","My partner and I have been together for almost 8 years, and engaged for 6 1/2 yrs. We have a 2 yr old and I'm also pregnant with our *planned* second child (The planned part is very important). We've recently just moved into my parents house because we've had so many issues with the management at our apartment and we talked it out and decided we could also save a ton of money and pay off debt if we moved into my parents for a while. 

We planned on paying of debt as quickly as possible and then saving up a down-payment for a house. Good plan right? Well I have a history of recurring miscarriages and have already had complications with bleeding and cramping after moving around with this pregnancy so I've been trying to not do too much lifting or moving, which of course is terrible timing with trying to move on a time limit. Because of my limitations, I know most of the packing has been put on my partner and I've continuously have asked for my siblings and mom to go over and help my partner with packing and cleaning because I didn't want it to be all on him.

 He gets stressed out super easily and I know that could be playing a part in this situation, but when we were almost completely moved out he told me that he needed to talk to me and that I wasn't going to like what he had to say. I of course was panicking on the inside and trying not to freak out, but said okay let's talk. He told me that he talked to his therapist and has come to the realization that all his stress isn't coming from just work, but from me. That he's not sure he wants to be with me anymore and that he's tired of ""taking care of me"" and being responsible for me.

 (Gut punch) I cried, but I sat there and listened to everything he had to say about me and how he's been feeling. He said some very hurtful things and I wanted to say a lot of things but I held back because this was his time to tell me how he felt so I was trying to respect that, but it really really hurt to hear what he said. To clear some things up, I'm a stay at home mom, and I'm on disability, so I have a very small set income every month. But I do pay my own bills, phone, car insurance, gas, and some groceries where i can (so I don't fully understand how he's ""tired of taking care of me""). 

Yes, we knew I would be staying home with the kids way before we had our first kid, and we PLANNED our second kid, after 3 back to back miscarriages. So I'm heartbroken and confused where this is all coming from. Yes he's makes way more money than me, and the we majority of the bills and costs are on him, so I understand that he's stressed out, but this feels like it's coming out of nowhere right now. 

so now we're moved into my parents and he's been completely ignoring me. He won't hardly look at me or talk to me unless he needs to or I talk to him first. After the first week of ignoring me, when we were laying down he started cuddling me and we ended up having sex, but then the next day he went back to ignoring me again. I asked him if on his day off he wanted to go out and get coffee with me and spend some time together just the two of us, and he said he didn't think it was a good idea to be spending alone time with me. 

 That kind of did it for me honestly. So, he can ignore for a week, fuck me one night, and then go back to ignoring all while I'm pregnant and suffering emotionally and mentally through whatever this is. I'm scared to be a single mother, but i know i can do it if i have to. But I love my partner and have never even thought of a life without him these past 8 years. But with how he's been treating me I'm starting to resent him and don't know if I should even try anymore. I don't want to be with someone who makes me feel unloved and unappreciated. I'm heartbroken and so angry, and I just don't know what to do anymore.

*edit* The reason we haven't gotten married is because I'm on disability and would lose my medical insurance and benefits immediately if we got married. I have a lot of medical problems and can't afford to lose my medical. We have both basically acted and treated each other like we're already married though.

 I'm not trying to shit talk him because he's the best man I know and has truly cared for me and our son and has always put us first. He's just not acting like himself right now, and I don't know if it's the stress or if he is actually talking to someone else ",12,1753384841.0,relationship_advice,43,0.83,False

I gave them the polite nod you learn to use when you‚Äôre too tired to argue.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre just signs,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúJust trees.‚Äù

They didn‚Äôt argue. They just kept watching me finish my coffee.

Truth was, this route landed in my lap because nobody else wanted it. Not the younger guys, not the retirees pulling half-shifts to pad their pensions. Even my supervisor didn‚Äôt look me in the eye when he gave me the paperwork.

‚ÄúLot of bad breaks out there,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBe careful where you step.‚Äù

I figured it was the usual small-town superstition. Faded trail markers nailed to rotting trees weren‚Äôt going to bite me. Bureaucracy doesn‚Äôt scare me. Not usually.

\-

The first few trails went by without much to say for themselves. Nothing unusual beyond how quiet everything felt. No birds, no squirrels, not even the hum of flies over deadfall. Just me and the trees, the kind of silence you feel in your teeth.

The work itself stayed simple. Hike in, find the markers, pull them down, log the removal, move on. Every sign had a name on it, stamped in wood and weather-worn to hell. Some of them I recognized from old missing persons flyers, faces that used to hang by the register in gas stations when I was a kid, memorials to those lost and never found. Others dated further back than that. Names passed down through town gossip, usually mentioned in the same breath as bad luck or sad endings.

It struck me, more than once, how strange it was to name trails after people who‚Äôd gone missing on them. Stranger still, how nobody ever bothered to mention that part when handing me the job sheet.

After a few days, things started not lining up. I‚Äôd clear a path in the morning, haul the markers out, only to find some of them back up by the afternoon. Same trees, same bolts sunk into bark that should have been bare.

Then there were the footprints. Too narrow for my boots, moving across the paths in places where no one should have been walking. They never led anywhere. Just stopped dead in the middle of thick brush or vanished outright on solid ground.

The radio gave me more than static the deeper I went. Voices sometimes, faint and broken beneath the white noise. I couldn‚Äôt make out much at first, but after a while it got clearer. ‚ÄòStop‚Äô. ‚ÄòTurn back‚Äô. ‚ÄòLeave it alone‚Äô.¬† Always urgent, always just on the edge of words. I told myself it had to be locals playing games. Teens tapping into my radio frequency. Maybe those old boys at the diner still had enough spite in them to plant a CB somewhere and mess with me.

I thought about packing up early, taking the write-up, losing the overtime. But rent was due, bills were stacked, and I couldn‚Äôt stomach screwing up another job.

So I stayed. Set up camp right in the thick of it to finish quicker. One more night, then I‚Äôd tear down the last of it and never look back.

Even as I hammered in the last stake and zipped my tent shut beneath those dead trees, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling I should have left already.

\-

That night the woods didn‚Äôt pretend to sleep.

I heard movement outside the tent long before I unzipped it. Not footsteps exactly. Not anything that steady. Branches snapped, leaves shifted, and something mimicked the short, clipped beeps of my radio. Not words, just noise, chopped and mechanical, trying to get the rhythm right without understanding the purpose behind it.

I sat in the dark, listening, waiting for it to stop. When it didn‚Äôt, I stepped out with my flashlight and swept the trees beyond the camp.

For a second I thought I saw a figure. It was tall, bigger than anyone living ought to be, standing too still between the trunks. My light didn‚Äôt catch it properly, and when I blinked it was gone. I told myself it had been a tree, a shadow, or a grazing animal I had spooked away.

When I tried the radio again, the static gave way to words. Not sentences, nothing conversational. Just names. Names of trails I hadn‚Äôt reached yet. Names pulled straight from my paperwork. Some I didn‚Äôt even recognize.

I didn‚Äôt sleep after that.

By morning, every marker I had pulled the day before had been reinstalled, not where I had found them originally, but deeper into the woods. Trees I hadn‚Äôt walked past yet. Some even looked freshly mounted, bolts driven into bark that wept clean sap beneath them.

I packed up camp and made for the truck, ready to leave this evolving nightmare behind, only to find it wasn‚Äôt where I left it. The tire tracks stretched off into the brush and vanished without a sign of turning around.

I stood there for a long while, fighting the urge to just walk back to town and leave it all behind. But the job was halfway done. Rent wasn‚Äôt going to pay itself, and I couldn‚Äôt stomach another mistake on my record. I just needed to finish off the last of my assigned route. So I kept going. I was going to finish clearing these trails.

\-

Nothing in those woods connected the way it should. Paths I knew for a fact ran east to west began curving in on themselves, leading me back to places I hadn‚Äôt passed twice. I checked my compass until the needle spun in slow, lazy circles no matter which way I turned. The GPS on my phone glitched between error screens and coordinates that made no sense.

I started leaving fresh markers behind me. Bright tape, scratches in the bark, small cairns of stone. Every time I circled back, they were gone. The discarded pile of signs I‚Äôd created to dispose of later that morning vanished too.

I kept walking until the trees opened into a clearing I didn‚Äôt remember from any map. At its center stood a structure. Not natural, not accidental. A totem of old signs, rusted and rotted, deliberately bolted together in twisting layers. Beneath the plaques hung scraps of fabric, torn backpacks, and empty shoes. Bones wedged between them, yellowed thin with age. I recognized a few of the names on those signs from the markers I‚Äôd pulled. Names from my paperwork, names from missing persons cases decades old.¬†

The trees around the clearing weren‚Äôt untouched either. Deep grooves cut into the bark, long slashes that pulled at the wood in crude shapes. At first they looked random, but the longer I stared the more they resembled the clean, square fonts used on county trail markers. Letters half-formed, sentences left unfinished.

This wasn‚Äôt some prank. This wasn‚Äôt locals trying to scare me off or some bitter old men with a CB radio in the woods. The trails weren‚Äôt just abandoned. They weren‚Äôt meant to be touched.

The woods were watching. Or worse, waiting.

\-

I tried to backtrack. I tried to follow the map, my own markers, even the sun. None of it lined up anymore.¬†

In the end, I went back to the clearing, back to the totem.

I thought if I burned it, maybe it would break whatever was holding me here. Maybe fire would undo it, strip it down to something human again.

The flames caught easily enough, but they burned blue, green at the edges, curling smoke up in heavy spirals that didn‚Äôt rise but hung low and thick over the ground.

That was when the woods reacted.

The wind roared through the trees in sharp bursts, pulling at the branches until they bowed and twisted. The ground trembled beneath my feet. I heard something creak in the dark beyond the clearing, timber straining, metal grinding against itself.

The totem didn‚Äôt burn. Not really. The signs blackened, peeled, fell apart, only to pull themselves together again. Bent metal reformed, plaques twisting into new shapes, names rearranging themselves into words I couldn‚Äôt read. The whole thing shifted, taller now, branches splitting off from its core like limbs.

Something stepped free of it.

I couldn‚Äôt tell where the structure ended and the thing began. Wood for bones, rusted signs for skin, nailed plaques overlapping like scales. Limbs too long, torso hollowed out, a shape made of all the pieces I thought I had removed. Signs hung from its body, clattering against each other with every slow, deliberate movement. Words I recognized, names I had touched, dates I had logged.

It didn‚Äôt speak. It didn‚Äôt need to. The weight of its gaze pressed into me, pulling something loose behind my eyes. The trees leaned in, branches scraping against one another until they sounded almost like laughter, dry and joyless.

I turned to run, but there was nowhere left to run to go. Paths folded in on themselves. Roots broke through the dirt in coils thick enough to trip me, no matter which way I turned. Daylight snapped to dusk without warning, shadows stretching long and thin until they swallowed the edges of the clearing.

The thing watched me until I couldn‚Äôt hold onto the moment any longer.

The ground tilted. The air split sideways. My thoughts scattered into static.

I blacked out standing right where it wanted me.

\-

I woke up lying in the dirt, but it wasn‚Äôt the same dirt I‚Äôd blacked out on.

The ground beneath me was clean, the trail well-maintained. Fresh gravel crunched under my hands when I pushed myself upright. The trees weren‚Äôt dead and twisting anymore. They stood tall and green, leaves shifting gently in a breeze that actually smelled right. I could hear birds again. Wind in the branches.

For a moment, I let myself believe I‚Äôd made it out. Maybe I‚Äôd wandered too far, passed out, and someone had dragged me back to a safe route.

But my truck was gone. No sign of my tent, my tools, the clearing, or the twisted thing I‚Äôd seen pulling itself together from bones and metal.

I turned in a slow circle, trying to find any marker to orient myself. Nothing. Only a trail running ahead and behind, so neat and orderly it might have been laid down yesterday.

I followed it backward, hoping it might lead to a road. Instead, it brought me to a sign. New, freshly bolted, standing proud at the trailhead.

The words didn‚Äôt make sense until I read them twice.

It was a new trail, one I hadn‚Äôt seen when I took inventory of the listed trails for the area. Named after me. The established date was the day I had blacked out. There was no way someone could have made a whole trail in that short a time. It would have taken a whole team weeks. Yet here it was, freshly laid and ready for use.

I stood there staring until my throat closed up. The font matched every sign I‚Äôd removed over the past week. Same materials. Same bolts. Even the angle of the placement was the same as the ones I‚Äôd pulled down with my own hands.

I remembered, clear as daylight, how every one of those old trails bore the name of a missing person. Names I had thought were just bureaucratic leftovers from decades past. Memorials to those lost to nature. Forgotten names I had thought I was helping erase.

But I wasn‚Äôt clearing them. I was making room.¬†

This was how new trails got built. Not laid by county workers. Not signed off with permits or blueprints.

People didn‚Äôt vanish here. They got repurposed.

\-

I kept walking because I didn‚Äôt know what else to do. The trail stretched ahead, perfect and clean beneath my feet. No rot, no traps, no wrong turns. Just a neat little path inviting people in.

Up ahead, I saw them. Hikers. Three of them, maybe four. Bright jackets, backpacks, chatting as they made their way down the trail like nothing was wrong. Laughing, relaxed, without a clue what waited further in.

I shouted for them to stop. I waved my arms, stepped into their path, anything to get their attention. They didn‚Äôt react. They didn‚Äôt even glance up.

I screamed at them. Begged them to turn around. Told them they had no idea what they were walking toward, that this trail wasn‚Äôt meant to exist, that it would swallow them like it swallowed me.

They walked through me.

Not around, not past. Through. Cold sliced through my ribs and chest, a chill deeper than winter, leaving nothing behind but air. They didn‚Äôt hesitate. Didn‚Äôt seem to notice at all.

I chased after them, still shouting, still trying to get between them and the woods ahead. No matter what I did, they didn‚Äôt hear. My words didn‚Äôt touch them. My hands couldn‚Äôt stop them.

I stepped off the trail, hoping maybe that would break whatever held me here. The world twisted. Trees folded inward, colors drained to ash and bone. I blinked and found myself back on the path where I started.

I tried again. Same result. Every time. The trail wouldn‚Äôt let me leave.

I could only watch as the hikers moved ahead until they left the confines of where my limits were. Unaware that deeper in, something was possibly waiting to fold them into the earth the same way it folded me.

I wanted to follow them, make sure they were safe. But I couldn‚Äôt even touch them.

All I could do was watch. Helpless. Voiceless. Bound to this path.

\-

Time stopped making sense after a while. I didn‚Äôt eat. I didn‚Äôt sleep. I didn‚Äôt even get tired. My body didn‚Äôt ache, my feet never blistered, but I couldn‚Äôt leave the trail. I tried every direction, every hour of what I could only guess was passing time. Off the path, the world broke apart and threw me back onto the gravel.

I couldn‚Äôt rest. I just walked. Back and forth. From the trailhead bearing my name to the furthest point before the woods bent the world in half again. Back and forth, forever.

People came. Not often, but enough. Hikers in pairs or groups, wandering in without a clue, following my name printed on that clean, fresh sign. I followed them at a distance. Watched them finish the path, heard them laugh about the beautiful scenery, the quiet woods. They always made it through, at least the ones I saw. They always left. I couldn‚Äôt follow beyond the trailhead.

I wanted to think I was watching over them. Some part of me still wanted to protect someone from this place. I told myself maybe that mattered. Maybe I still mattered.

Then the ranger came.

A county man, clipboard in hand, maintenance vest, same patch on his sleeve I used to wear. Same paperwork I‚Äôd filled out, the checklist, the inventory. Same job.

He stood beneath my sign for a long time, scowling at it. Eventually, he pulled out a crowbar and started prying it loose. I wanted to scream at him to stop, to leave it, to get back in his truck and drive until he couldn‚Äôt see trees anymore.

I followed him as he walked down the trail, dragging the sign under one arm. I screamed as loud as I could, then pushed harder to try to get through to him. Nothing happened, until his radio crackled at his hip. My voice came through it, warped and broken, barely words at all. A handful of syllables. A warning he couldn‚Äôt hear. Or maybe he could, and simply dismissed it as the locals driving him away.

Ahead of him, between the trees, I saw it.

The thing from the clearing. The shape stitched together from rusted signs and bones, from wood and stolen names. It moved ahead of him, slow but certain, always just out of sight. It wasn‚Äôt chasing him. It didn‚Äôt have to. It was leading him somewhere.

He didn‚Äôt see it. He wouldn‚Äôt have believed it if he did. He followed his paperwork, his duty, not knowing what was waiting for him now that he had disturbed the trail.

They stepped off the trail together. Into the woods. Beyond where I could go.

I stood there watching the space where they vanished, listening to the empty woods breathe. The sign would come back, I knew. New name, new date, new path carved deeper. Another piece added to the forest‚Äôs collection. Another mile for hikers to follow.

Another man swallowed up, and I couldn‚Äôt do a damn thing to stop it.

Isn‚Äôt it weird when they claim that you‚Äôre messy, that you leave their house in a pigsty, that you don‚Äôt clean up after yourself or do anything to help, but they do nothing themselves?

For example, my mom is glued to her phone all day. She‚Äôs on it while using the toilet, while eating, lying down, watching TV, or even doing both at the same time. She doesn‚Äôt pick up after herself. Sometimes she‚Äôll eat, leave the plates on the coffee table, and ignore them for the entire day. She‚Äôll even go upstairs and sleep without touching them.

I remember once we had a rat infestation. It happened while I was away at my grandma‚Äôs house for vacation. When I came back, I saw rat traps all over the house. I asked what was going on, and my mom told me there was a rat in the house. I didn‚Äôt really believe it until I saw the rat hiding. That made me wonder, why are there rats in our house all of a sudden? I mean, the house isn‚Äôt filthy, but it‚Äôs not spotless either.

Over the next few days, there were still rats. My mom‚Äôs boyfriend tried to clean once every day until we finally got rid of them and cleaned the entire house. Then my mom decided to blame me for the infestation.

The crazy thing is, my mom eats snacks and throws the wrappers behind the couch. Apparently, there was a rat nest right where she‚Äôd been tossing the wrappers. And now she wants to say it‚Äôs my fault. Sure, sometimes I eat snacks and leave the wrapper there for a bit, but I pick them up, dust, and throw them in the bin. Meanwhile, when I‚Äôm cleaning the couch, I find snack packages that have been there for weeks ‚Äî and she still blames me.

And the funny thing is, my mom didn‚Äôt even clean up the poop, the pee, the fur, or anything from the rats. It was her boyfriend who did all of that. But then she made it seem like it was her and his idea, like they both did the work while I stayed locked in my room. The truth is, my mom didn‚Äôt do anything. In fact, she was avoiding the downstairs area and making a fuss while her boyfriend dealt with the rats.

That‚Äôs just weird to me, especially since she keeps the house messy too. Another example is when she‚Äôs cooking. You know when you‚Äôre using a spoon and it drips? My mom never wipes it up. I‚Äôm always the one cleaning the spoon drippings off the floor. She sees them and just leaves them there.

That has me thinking ‚Äî why do lazy people who are messy not clean up after themselves, yet act like they‚Äôre the only ones who care? It‚Äôs actually baffling how often I clean up after my mom. If I don‚Äôt, the mess just stays there and gets worse. Her boyfriend won‚Äôt clean it either unless it‚Äôs visibly disgusting. He has weaponized incompetence too. If it‚Äôs not obviously dirty, he just ignores it. So I get upset, because no one else cleans it up.

My mom also has a bad habit when she cooks. She doesn‚Äôt place the spoon in a container or holder. She just leaves it dripping all over, which is bad manners and unhygienic.

Another time, my mom told me I had to clean the bathroom. I‚Äôll admit, it was kind of nasty. So I cleaned it. I scrubbed the shower, wiped the sink ‚Äî I did my best. When she came home, she said it still wasn‚Äôt clean enough. I explained that I couldn‚Äôt do a deep scrub into every corner because my back was hurting ‚Äî because she had hit me the day before. I told her I couldn‚Äôt bend properly, and then she got mad at me and said, ‚ÄúWhy am I the only one who wants this house to be clean?‚Äù She claimed that everyone waits until she gets angry before doing anything.

But my mom is a hypocrite. Whenever we go to my grandma‚Äôs house, she leaves snack wrappers lying around, and then my grandma complains about ants. My mom is lazy and very messy, yet she tries to paint me as the nasty one when I clean up after myself.

She leaves dishes on the coffee table even though the kitchen is just a few steps away. She‚Äôs very lazy and constantly tries to blame me.

None of you came to visit me when we started to live away from each other. You all lived in the flat next to me, yet, none of you found the time in three years to come and see me once. None of you thought that I would feel alone that I had been living with my friends all this time, and that I would maybe feel lonely without you. I reached out so much during my free time in the group chats, just to spend some time with you guys on text. The two times, you did come for my birthday both times you either insulted the gifts, made taunts or embarrassed me in one way or another, and I am so mad because I let so many things go because I did not want to create drama. 
I am so mad that the cat stickers i gave to one of you which was MY birthday gift, was then used by all of you for your group, with all of my friends, without me. And I am so mad that I let so much go just because I thought I was overthinking everything, even though everybody around me, my mother, my father, my friends, my best friend, my new friends, my cousins, everybody was telling me that this is not how friends treat each other, but I still convinced myself that no this is my fault, i am overthinking this maybe I have presented the story to them differently, in a biased manner. And almost every day I wake up regretting all the time and all the benefit of doubt that I‚Äôve given you and your friends which has led me to have severe trust issues, and I will never forgive you for that. I will never forgive you for always putting everybody else above me, and I will never forgive you for punishing me for something that I didn‚Äôt do and staying friends with the one who was responsible. None of you considered me a real friend. None of you took out time for me. None of you were there for me, and you always made sure  that you would hang out without me in spite of me telling you over and over again, and it might seem like it was nothing, but it wasn‚Äôt nothing to me. I was so alone, and I made the stupid mistake of ignoring the good friends that I had that time just because you guys had a problem with them, had issues with them, but those issues did not matter to me that much, until you put all of that stupid anger inside of me. I was angry about things that would never bother me otherwise. Your negative thinking and your pessimistic mentality is what made me miserable as well. I was so relieved when you guys moved out, and I realise that it is much better to be alone than to be surrounded by people who are constantly upset with their life for one reason or another. I wish I had never invited you to my home and I wish I hadn‚Äôt apologise for wanting my home, bought by MY parents for ME, to be clean, for my living space to be clean. Yes you paid for the 1bhk, that does not mean you treat the common spaces like shit. Always littered with your unclean clothes and disgusting coffee mugs. I never had a problem with how you kept your bedroom and bathroom, but you littered the common space as well. I was so stupid to apologise for expecting basic decency. I should‚Äôve left you and your group years ago, and if I could go back in time and do it again, I would never even say hi to you because there was a reason I used to ignore you in school and I was right about that all along, my gut feeling about you was right. My gut feeling about all of you was right because this is not how friends treat each other. This is not what friendship is, and I have gone through enough therapy, enough hearing everybody opinions, enough self help books, enough articles on the internet, enough stories of other strangers, enough videos to know that I was not wrong because even after i left, I thought maybe this is my fault. I thought maybe I am the bad guy. Maybe I am overthinking, but I know now. I am certain now that it was not my fault. My only fault was not leaving sooner. The signs had been there all along. I will always hate you and hate that part of myself, which chose you when everybody was telling me to choose anything, even loneliness but not you. I will always hate you people and myself for choosing you and for wasting five years of my life that I will never get back, the most important five years of my career that I will never get back, the most important five years that I can never revisit because it hurts so much because you disgusting hateful people are everywhere in it. No matter how much I miss the good parts of the friendship, every day when I wake up and before I go to sleep, it is still less than how much you people have hurt me with your actions and your absence and never prioritising me over anybody. I will forever hate you, and I hope we never have to cross paths again.

I am done blaming myself for what happened. I just wanted to be friends with you and your friends, who i thought were my friends too. I genuinely thought that i finally have my person. Even though i had a family of friends back at home, you were as close to me as they were. And i regret loving you. You didnt deserve any of it. I regret putting you up there. I regret ever trusting you after you so clearly misunderstood me over the flat. And i regret contacting you again. If i could go back in time, i would never even say hi to you in that dorm room. 
I hope youre happy, i know you will be. People like you thrive on seeing the people you used to be friends with miserable. I have seen you do that with your old best friends, i shoudlve known it would happen to me too. 

Thanks for the experience, now i know to never trust anyone like you ever again, so full of envy and hatred towards every aspect of your life. 
I hope you change that about yourself and become a bit more positive. 

And i sincerely hope that this after this day, i stop beating myself up. Because i deserved better. I deserved a friend. Even with all the mistakes i made, i did not deserve to be treated like that. 

Thank you, for teaching me my worth. I now know never to give it in the hands of people like you, who are so careless and cruel in their friendships. You were never a friend. And i was the fool. 

Have a happy life.

There‚Äôs a detail about my sister thats relevant to this post. She is a bit male centered. I wont get into details for the length of this post, but i can provide examples if necessary. I love my sister, but thats just the way it is. It only bothers me when she gets entangled with one of our common guy friends because most of them just start not caring about our friendship unless they‚Äôre trying to get info about her through me constantly. Okay, now to what happened.

A few months ago, Jack asked to hang out with me and my sister. Im a homebody, but he said that he misses us so i went along. We met, then Jack and my sister hug for around a minute and im just standing there, awkward but it‚Äôs cool. A few mins in, Jack confesses to my sister. This entire hang out turns into a conversation about romantics, future plans etc. My sister is sitting in his arms and he‚Äôs massaging her scalp and Im just sitting there nervously looking around, as we are in a conservative community where stuff like this can get us arrested. 

Let me make one thing clear, i never minded third wheeling. As long as the couple let me know before hand, we can all have fun and they can do whatever as long as its not excessive and won‚Äôt get me into trouble! But this just felt disrespectful. For a moment i wondered if the coffee i drank transformed me into casper the ghost or something the way they treated me like i was invisible. We had like two normal convos then my sister insisted that Jack ubers home with us, which i told her i was against. They spent the entire ride whispering and giggling, it was just uncomfortable.

They both noticed i was distant after and told me to speak up, so i spoke to each of them individually. My sister got defensive and angry, as per usual, and Jack apologized. I told him it‚Äôs fine and that I am not hanging out with the two of them alone again. He told me to reconsider and i said no.

Now, Jack is traveling soon and has been hinting at wanting to hang out. Today, i was looking for tickets for a concert that were sold out, so i asked him as he has connections. He found one, but there was problem with payment so i thanked him either way and expressed gratitude for his efforts. Jack then asks to hang out today since I‚Äôm not going. I ask ‚Äúwhere?‚Äù And he said ‚ÄúIDK, you guys choose‚Äù, obviously talking about me and my sister. I then told him that I‚Äôm good and to have fun. He then said something in Arabic that‚Äôs like ‚Äúi‚Äôm holding a grudge‚Äù but in a jokey manner. I said ‚Äúman what? Dont be like that.‚Äù He then said that he was joking.

Ngl, that made me feel a bit bad. I know that his intent might be to guilt trip me, but I cant help but feel a bit wrong for asking him for help then turning him down after. But on the other hand, what should i even hang out with them for? The last experience left a bad taste in my mouth. I‚Äôm confused. So tell me guys, am i the asshole?

I've learned a lot about the town since I last posted.

No major attacks since Rick. Well sort off-but we'll get to that. The morning after I woke up to a polite knock on the front door. I found an envelope slipped under with my name neatly written in blue ink.¬† I'm going to transcribe the whole flyer here now-it's wild stuff:‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ

‚ÄÇ**""To our friends and neighbors in the township of Eustace""**

*""Last night our Friend Rick suffered a horrible injury-and the loss of a beloved family pet. While this is a tragedy and our hearts go out to his family at this time-we would be remiss if we didn't highlight this incident as why we have strict guidelines about how we engage with the wildlife.*

*During the course of our investigation into last night's incident-it has been brought to our attention that Rick was improperly securing his bird feeder and filming the raptor pack. We shouldn't need to remind you all we have very strict polices about feeding the raptors specifically and VERY strict NDAs about recordings. We shouldn't need to remind you all-but last night suggests otherwise.*

*Under normal circumstances these violations would be grounds for eviction proceedings but in light of this tragedy-we feel a lesson has been harshly learned. We'd also like to say we are posting new rules about securing your pets indoors during certain hours- and enacting a curfew of 8pm starting tonight. These rules are to ensure no more bite incidents occur-they are not punishments.*

*Again, we would like to extend our thoughts and prayers to Rick's family at this time. We have been told he is stable and will be coming home in a few days. Please direct any notes of well wishes or gift baskets to his lovely wife Marla.*

*The heatwave is expected to continue-so please, do not agitate our cretaceous neighbors any more than they already are. Be mindful, be kind, and above all be safe. Have a wonderful day.""*‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ

**""From Head of the Eustace Township Commission""**

My blood boiled at this-it was so tasteless and impersonal. A man was mauled by a dinosaur and all Wayne could muster was a letter full of corpo speak? I tore it up and marched out the door-shielding my eyes from the melting rays of the sun.

Across the way Tessa was standing in a bathrobe mumbling to herself as she crumpled the flyer in frustration.¬† An egg-shaped¬†shadow loomed behind her, trying to usher her back inside. She brushed him off and yelled something to the effect of ""Cowardly bastard."" as she huffed back into their home. Lucas stuck his head out and saw me gawking. He gave a polite wave- a first for him-and retreated as well.

I didn't know what I was thinking of doing, but it occurred to me that Marla had seen that flyer as well, and that was the last thing she needed. I stormed next door-hoping to intercept the letter. Their front porch was worn and well used- an old bench leaned against the tiled walls. I rang the doorbell, a harsh chime echoing through their home. I was met with silence, and in my hurried state I leaned over to the driveway and saw it was empty-save a police cruiser.

Officer Sydney was watching me lose my mind-an oddly calm look on her face. She was wearing her blackout shades and sipping softly out of a styrofoam cop. She was sitting on the hood of her cruiser and patted next to her. I joined her, face flushing with beets as I stewed about the flyer. She pulled out a try with three other cups behind her.

""Want one?"" she offered. I grabbed one and took a swig, almost immediately throwing up from the taste of baileys and decaf.

¬†""Bit early isn't it."" I choked out.

""Nonsense. It's five o'clock somewhere and all that jazz."" She took another sip of the spiked coffee. ""You won't find her-she's parked at the county hospital till they give Rick the all clear."" She explained.¬†

""Then what are you doing here?"" I squared my face at her.

¬†""Waiting till they come back-to make sure they kept their mouth shut."" She said grimly. ""Ridiculous I know, they've lived here all their life. They know better-which is why I can't wrap my head around why he didn't mention they were coming up to his frigging backdoor."" She complained.

¬†""Did you see that note, it's abhorrent."" I sat next to her, the car jolting as I did.

""I delivered them-god forbid Wayne do any heavy lifting. Well more than he already does."" She cracked. ""There'll be grumbling and pouting-but it'll die down. Always does.""¬†She turned to me and anticipated my next question.

""Barton county has the highest number of reported disappearances in the state-both animal and people. Wayne likes to pretend otherwise but even here I get calls about pets snatched in the middle of the night or attempted break ins.""

""Last week I got a call-few streets down. The Martinez family-said the daughter got up in the middle of the night and saw a monster scratching at the back door. Said she could see the handle jiggling-and these glowing orbs staring right at her. Didn't find the monster-just a couple loose feathers and scratch marks in the glass."" She recalled, taking a longer sip.

I felt the urge to join her on that one, didn't sting any less going down the second time.¬†

""Jesus."" I muttered.¬†

""I don't think he's down here-if he was these things would have been wiped out ages ago."" She admitted flippantly.

¬†""Even Lucile?"" I tried to joke. She looked me dead in the eyes, I could feel the rage burning behind her shades.

""Every last one of them."" She said. ""These things are smarter than they let on. They know exactly what they're doing, and they aren't afraid of us. We've coddled them too much."" She spat with disgust.

¬† The heat sizzled overhead, and I began to fuse to the hood of the cruiser. In the distance a jeep pulled up in front of my place, and Laura stepped out wearing jorts and a flowery sun top.

She scanned the yard and saw me sitting with Sydney, eyebrows raised. I cleared my throat and jumped off the car, half-drunk cup in hand and a little buzzed.¬†

""I better go say hi-uh thanks for the drink."" I blurted out.

""Sure, sure. Tell your lady friend there if she doesn't move that thing off the curb by noon, I'm having it towed."" She said with a pointed grin. I laughed as I walked away, but I got the feeling she wasn't kidding.

I ran up and gave Laura a peck on the cheek and scooped her up, pretty much carrying her to the door. Her face flustered with surprise as she wrapped her arms around me. We had barely made it in the front door when¬†we both collapsed on the floor in a giggling heap.

Afterwards we relaxed on the couch, curtains drawn to protect the neighborhood decency. I had just sat back down after getting us both some water as she snuggled next to me, a content but curious look on her face.

""What brought that on-guilty conscience?"" She teased and slapped my bald chest.

""What-oh no, no nothing like that I just- I'm really happy to see you."" I said as I held her close. ""It's been kind of-tense-to put it lightly."" I explained.

I told her all that happened in the short few days I had seen her, the mob, Wayne and his plumpness, and the raptor attack. By the end of it her curiosity and amusement were replaced by panic and worry, she cursed to herself as she began searching her pockets and mine.

""Jesus-I had no idea, I'm so sorry. Ugh come on I know I brought some."" She mumbled.

""I thought you were gonna quit."" I gently reminded.

""I thought you were going to ask me to move in."" She retorted with a dagger in my ego. ""A-ha."" She said producing a half open pack of Newports from her cloths. I sighed and went to the kitchen for a lighter, Laura putting on my blue button down as she followed.

""Fair enough babe, just, outside-please the odor."" I complained. She obliged and snatched the lighter from my hands. The mug gy air zoomed in like we were in an airlock as she opened the sliding door. She set her sights on the grazing Lucile as she sparked up and inhaled deeply. Lucile was doing laps in the pool-her long paddle of a tail like a mini motor engine.

She seemed anxious, and I noticed there wasn't any new gore by the pool. The crate from last night lay in the yard-shattered and all that remained of its cargo was a pinkish hue. Laura studied the big lizard as she smoked, the gears in her head ever turning. Finally, she pointed a lit finger at her and spoke her mind.¬†

""She's hungry-but she's not hunting."" She stated. Every few seconds she was glancing at the shed as she paced the pool. She let out a low whine, her teeth clattering together in a rapid snapping noise. Laura turned to me, a devilish look on face. ""You haven't fed her yet?""¬†

""I was busying day drinking."" I said as I took a swig of water, sobriety running at full capacity now. She rolled her eyes and used a free hand to drag me out into the swampy air. She dragged me over to the shed as Lucile slowed her pace, her interest piquing and her jaws watering.

We picked out a box of salmon and a box of halibut. When we cracked open the containers-the stench flew out of them. Lucile cooed and dragged lumbering self out of the pool. She was eyeing Laura with an odd amount of suspicion, yet when she looked at me, I got this sense of-begrudging familiarity.¬†

My feelings were confirmed when she trudged right up to me and plopped down-sitting like a guarding sphinx. Her gaze was polity locked on the crates. Laura circled around the crouching dino-a look of awe upon her.¬†

""I described her to Brian-he said ""assuming I'm not pulling the other one-"" she's a type of Spinosaurus. Fully amphibious, deadly stalker of the Cenomanian stage."" She prattled. ""Take a look at her sail here, the colors and patterns-not camouflage, too vibrant for that. Maybe to ward off larger predators, similar to frogs who have rainbow colored skin."" She speculated aloud.¬†

""That would mean she's-venomous or something like that right?"" I said, struggling to recall something from dozens of docs she's made me slog through. She smiled at me the way you smile at your dog when they tear up a chew toy.¬†

""Something like that. Have you hand fed her?"" she asked, turning towards the halibut.

¬†""No, I like being alive."" I said. She laughed at that.

""Sam, she weighs about three tons-if she wanted to, you'd be dead already."" She reminded, taking a slimy fish head in hand. She outstretched her hand to Lucile's jaw-who was eyeing her out of the side of her emeralds.

Before I could warn her, she snapped her jaws, and I heard Laura yelp as Lucile groaned and snatched the fish. She chewed it slowly, savoring the raw melty feeling of the meat-all while mad dogging my girlfriend. Lucile nudged her with her snout and made a move towards the crate.

That's when Laura did the most batshit insane thing I have ever seen.

She put on a scowl, raised her hand and gently smacked Lucile on the snout while making this¬†*tsst*¬†sound with her teeth. Lucile whined-clearly taken back by this affrontery. Laura wagged her soon to be chomped hand like she was scolding a child.

""No-bad."" she commanded in this deep voice. I was too stunned to speak, otherwise I would have tackled her and brought her back in. She reached down, maintaining direct eye contact with Lucile as she slammed her tail on the ground, a jet engine sounding off from her gullet. She grabbed another and slowly brought it towards the buzzsaw.

She raised it above her head, and Lucile followed the piper. Laura inched the fish forward and uttered a booming but simple command; ""Gentle."" To my astonishment Lucile neatly picked the tip with her teeth and brought it away-quickly devouring it when she realized she was safely out of reach.¬† Laura grinned like a mad woman and reached down and patted her scaley skull like she was a golden retriever.¬†

""Thatta girl, good job."" She cooed as she scratched. Lucile broke out in this crocodilian trance, eyes widening and lips parting into a sinister smile. I moved closer, taking in this bizarre sight. Laura caught me gawking and nudged toward the salmon. I was hesitant, flashes of the carnage of last night flowing through me.

But I put aside my distrust and grabbed a mound of pink. Lucile regarded me, annoyance in her eyes. I stuck out my fist and she paused, unsure if she should just snatch it. Laura urged me on-and I held my breath and shakily uttered her command: ""G-Gentle.""

She was less graceful with me, making a big show of opening her maw, her rancid tuna breath melting my eyebrows. She chomped down on a bit of pink and tugged it away from me in one swift motion. She turned her head away, though she nudged closer to me. My hand trembled as I reached towards her head. She froze midchew when I laid my hand down but let me pat her.

Her hide felt cool to the touch, leathery but smooth. Like a fresh belt. Laura giggled as she watched me awkwardly pat the dinosaur, and to be honest I don't think Lucile was too thrilled either.

Laura knelt down and grabbed another one, a quick whistle leaving her lips. Lucile groaned and played along-content enough I suppose. I was scratching her scales, getting into it as she gently chomped on her fishy treats.

""This is amazing."" I said Laura, sounding like a little kid. She smiled at me as she continued feeding. We spent the whole day with Lucile, feeding her fish and trying-and often failing-to teach her tricks. She did seem to get a kick out of following us around the yard with food in our hands.

She stomped like a fussy puppy-catching the thrown meat like a party trick. We watched her graze in the pool-I listened to her go on and on about everything she had learned about Spinos in the short time she had been gone. I tried to pay attention to what she was saying, because she was so passionate about it, but my attention kept drafting.

Does that make me a shitty boyfriend?

After a while we grazed by the pool and watched a tired Lucile drift in peace.

Laura sat next to me and rested her head on my shoulders. Lucile had her back to us-she was beginning her own ritual of sounding like a foghorn and staring at the trees. Laura took notice of that and stood up. I joined her and we walked back inside-though I wasn't sure what the rush was. When I brought it up, she looked at me like I was an idiot.

""We spent the whole day with Lucile, feeding her, getting her used to our presences. Why do you think we did that?"" She asked. I shrugged in response.¬†""God you're dense."" She said-playfully but I could feel the frustration.

""You're right, of course. You're always right."" I admitted. ""That's not a dig-I never meant it as one I just- I should listen to you more."" I added quickly. Laura leaned into me and kissed me deeply, her lips soft to the touch with the lingering taste of berry Chapstick.¬†

""You should."" She simply said.

The rest of the night was the best sleep I had all week. I woke to find a softly snoring Laura still clinging to my side. It was nice actually-before all this I was sleeping on the couch in my own home. We always seemed to find something to bicker about-I suspect she wanted the queen memory foam to herself. Rays of humidity peeked in through drawn blinds.

I wiggled out of Laura's grasp and opened them-blinding myself with the new Dawn. The sun was high in the baby blue sky that day-had to be at least Ten AM. In bed Laura groaned and rolled herself a cocoon. I chuckled and quietly left the room. I heard a knock from downstairs and opened the door to find Lucas.

He forced a smile when he saw me-beads of sweat clinging to his brow like rock climbers on a summit.¬†

""Hey Sam-another uh, another hot one today huh?"" He tried to chitchat.¬†

""Uh-y-yeah, probably another scorcher. Good day to just stay inside and let the AC do its thing."" I responded, throwing him a life preserver. This was odd-to say the least. It had been a year living here, and this was the first conversation I'd had with Lucas that didn't open with ""You left your trash in the middle of the curb again."" He cleared his throat and looked past me, struggling to get to the point of his announced visit.

""Well, listen-about the other day, eh what ya did for Rick and his own-"" he started.

""Oh- oh no that, come on it was nothing. I just happened to be there. Anyone else would have done the same, stupid thing."" I interrupted. He wagged his burly claws at me, scoffing at my modesty.

""Nah it ain't nothing. It's certainly not something I thought you'd ever do. The wife was thinking-and-and me as well, we were wondering if you wanted to come over for a late lunch or something. Give ya a long overdue ""welcome to the neighborhood."" He rubbed the back of his neck like it owed him money.¬†

""Oh-uh sure, sure that sounds nice. I'll swing by in a couple hours, shoot for 3pm?"" I suggested.

""Sure, sure sounds good. Bring your uh, lady friend there-"" He moved anxiously and waved his hand at the jeep neatly tucked in the drive. ""Tess would love to meet her.""¬†

""Yeah, sure that-that all sounds lovely."" I said. We both nodded in agreement and let our words mingle in the air as the birds squawked among our silence. It was eternal torture-and in that instant I regretted agreeing to the lunch.

Finally, I cough and said, ""Well I better go tell her, she's still sound asleep."" trying to escape back into the comfort of my home. We did an awkward goodbye as I shut the door and watched him hurry back over across the street.

Anyway, the time came, and we walked across the street. The sky was already starting to bleed orange as the mid-day sun hung low. The walk felt like a three weeklong hike as I dragged my feels against the asphalt.

The house across the way was painted plum purple-but the grand porch was a stark white-clean room white. We knocked on the oak door-it boomed through the veins of the home. We were met with a muffled voice, and a few moments later the door opened.

Standing in the doorway was a bubbly blonde woman with porcelain skin. She wore a tight blue shirt with matching pants. Her face twinkled in the waning day, a square shape with a long nose. She twitched it at us and batted her painted lashes as she stood in the door. From inside the sounds of a boiling oven and the scent of Italy wafted towards us.¬†

""Da?"" The woman spoke with a thick accent, like she was shipped straight from Siberia.

""We're here for dinner."" Laura piped up next to next to me. From the bowels of the house a shrill but pleasant voice called out.¬†

""In the kitchen! Yelena let them in-please and thank you."" Tessa sang from inside. Yelena mumbled something in Russian under her breath then put on the fakest smile I had ever seen as she stepped aside. The inside of their home smelled like an oregano scented organ grinder.

The walls were pearly pink with flowery trim at the top. On the wall were these beautiful landscape paintings of Tuscany. The front hall was narrow and led straight into the dining room. To our left was this staircase that smelt like mildew and fresh paint.

From above we heard a fussing baby as Yelena ditched us and bolted upstairs. Around the corner in a den straight out of my parent's home videos Lucas sat in a bulky brown cigar reeking chair. He was watching golf and straightening out his toupee when he caught us staring. His eyes bugged and he broke out a huge grin.

¬†""Hey you guys made it. Here-"" He patted a seat next to him. ""Sam why don't you take a seat-Tess is just finishing up in the kitchen and could use some help."" He hinted at Laura past me. She knocked me on the shoulders and pushed me into hell as she followed the aroma of ziti.

As I sunk into the Leather couch- I could literally feel dragging me down-I heard Tess squeal as she embraced Laura and loudly brayed about how good it was to finally meet her. Laura matched that energy almost perfectly, and the two of them soon became like long lost sisters.

Meanwhile Lucas was pretending to watch golf while gripping a frosty brew so hard I thought it would shatter in his hands. Time seemed to freeze in that den-as the mid-tier television flicked its grain at us. At times one of us would mutter an off-hand comment about the game like ""Boy Roy is really off his game."" or ""Awe he nicked the grass."" and the other would mutter in agreement.

He offered me a beer at one point, and I practically chugged it down. It was a frothy swill with cheap labeling, but god help me it tasted like the fruit of the gods. From down the hall they chatted away, one of them yelled five minutes and I think we both sighed with relief.

The dining room was a classy set up. There was a furnished round table with a beautifully frilly table clothing clinging to it. In the center was a feast that would make Erysicthon blush. A beautiful lasagna cooked to perfection-so thick you could eat it like a seven-layer cake.

There was salad, freshly tossed and mixed in with garden grown tomatoes and basil. Homemade garlic bread-which smelled divine. It was thin crust bread-so when you bit into it you really savored that garlicy crunch that came with it. Laura sat next to me with a cut slab of pasta brick on her diner plate.

On the other side were Lucas and Tess-saddled up next to each other with their plates stacked high. Tess was as thin- metabolism was funny like that I suppose. In her bedazzled claws was a wine glass filled to the brim. Wasn't surprising, dead center in the table were two uncorked wine bottles. They looked like big clubs.

In between the two couples was their babbling boy Lou. He was sat in a highchair with a pile of orange mush in front of him. He wore a little navy-blue cap on his head. Laura had been fawning over the kid since we got there-he was all smiles and smelt like fresh powder.

The beginning of dinner was a quiet affair-when we had first sat down it was a parade of ""oh this looks good"" ""My compliments to the chef."" But it soon settled on polite chews and the clanging of silverware.

Laura kicked me under the table-her subtle way of trying to get me to socialize. I looked up panic, it felt like all eyes were on me to get it going.¬†

""This-this is nice place you folks have here."" I stuttered like an idiot. Our hosts nodded in polite agreement.

""It was Luc's parent's house originally. He inherited it when they passed."" Tess confirmed. He nodded, a hint of a faint memory drawn on his face.¬†

""It really is a beautiful place; you guys must love coming up here."" Laura chimed in.¬†

""Eh if you get past the pests sure."" Lucas chuckled. ""You enjoying the neighborhood yourself, been bout a year since you guys moved in eh?"" Laura was taken back by the question, and all the color draining from my face betrayed me as well.

""Oh it's a-lovely neighborhood, but no I-don't live here. Just visiting."" She dragged that ""I"" out something fierce. Tess raised her eyebrows but said nothing. Lucas got this confuzzled look on him.""

Hold on now, ya been dating how long?""

""Uh coming up on three years now."" I replied.

""Three and a half."" Laura corrected. I quickly raised my own glass for a swig.

""And ya still ain't hitched?"" Lucas was flabbergasted as I nearly choked on my wine. He scoffed as I heaved up grapes and collected myself. ""Well, I guess I was right about you the first time-you are a moron."" He brayed as silence was thrown over the table like a wet towel. The world slowed to a snail's pace-Laura gave me a side eye, clearly worried about how I'd react to that. I took a big gulp of courage and just smiled.¬†

""Yeah, no 100% a moron, got me pegged."" It was slow but the table broke down into laughter. Under the table Laura put a reassuring hand on my knee, a thanks for being a good sport. From there the damn burst and hearty conversation flowed, it was like dinning with old friends.

Tess and Lucas both loved to talk I learned. Lucas hailed from Jersey-big shocker there-and the pair were college sweethearts. He regaled us all with stories from his youth; how he and his summer buddies would dare each other to walk into the swamplands to find a feather or an eggshell.

He said that little rite of passage was still going strong today, the other day he passed a group of local riffraff egging each other on. Tess said she was uneasy around the dinosaurs at first.¬†""I mean they're these big, ugly reptiles you know?"" She commented.

She told how Lucas had brought her up here the first summer they got engaged. She woke up one morning to find a curious duck billed thing poking it's head in from the bedroom window. Her first instinct was to shriek and beat the creature with her pillow, but she gazed into its hazel peepers, and her heart melted.

It was tall and bulky she had said- kept its four fingered hands close to its chest. The nostrils were huge, like you could stick your whole fist in them. It was sniffing the air around her and making this groaning noise that sounded like a sick deer. On its head was a singular fin, it's hide hearty and green like a budding lime.¬†

""I should have been scared, but it looked so-kind. I could tell; it was a gentle soul."" She urged. Lucas made a sound at that, and she slapped him on the arm. After a few moments she reached her hand out, and jolly green gave a quick sniff and made a grimace. He soon left after that.

""-must not have liked my perfume or something because he just turned his nose and left."" She sounded offended, even a decade later. Lucas took a big bite next to her, a weary but loving look on him.¬†

""She loves that story-like she's the frigging dinosaur whisperer."" he cracked. Lou the baby cried out next to me as Laura and I nodded our heads to their banter. The kid stretched his arms out, hands clasping shut and blinking non-stop. Tess cooed at her son and scooped him up as he babbled something to the effect of ""mama.""¬†

""Someone's cranky."" She sang. ""And don't be mean-you love when I tell it.""¬†

""Well, it's nice. Not like what happened later that week."" Lucas made a big show at shivering, like he was horrified at the thought. Tess furrowed her brow.

""What happened-oh my god, that was the same week wasn't? Oh god how could I forget."" She grimaced. Laura looked confused but something clicked for me, so I beat her to the punch.

""Wayne mentioned something offhand, hadn't had a bite around here in ten years."" I gave a gaudy impression of the wheezing man that was met with applause.

¬†""Heh-don't mention his lard a-uh butt around here right now. Tess is still mighty ticked."" Lucas warned.

""Oh, the audacity on that man-that letter he wrote.""

""Sam showed me that, and then he has that cop stake him out to-what shake him down."" Laura said, all appalled. Tess was quiet for a moment; she gave her husband a knowing glance.¬†

""Well, it all goes back to what happened. See ten years ago there was-eh cover Lou's ears hun-this major asshole who moved in a few blocks down."" Lucas began as Tess sighed and singled Yelena to rescue their son's innocent ears. ""And look I know I gave you a ration of shit for the rock all night and the garbage cans or whatever. But this guy was a major douche, major league to your minor."" He rambled.

""I get the point."" I said. Yelena was scooping Lou up and hurrying out of the room. I didn't see the point to be honest, you can swear in front of a one-year-old who's that hurting? Lucas went on with his tale.

""-he'd get into brawls at the tavern, come home with his tale between his legs and then get into screaming matches with his girlfriend. Big embarrassment for that poor girl-I tell you. There was one thing he treasured though. He had this garden in his backyard-loved to show it off to all the neighbors. Big boastful guy-said he grew the biggest flowers, the biggest carrots-"" Lucas rolled his eyes.

""Anyway, he was real proud. Didn't abide by any pests to linger back there-rabbits or, ya know something bigger than one. "" He hinted.¬†""One day-one of those big, elephant looking ones with a neck like a frigging palm tree-eh what are they called, what they eat?"" He asked the table.

""Herbivores."" Laura replied. Lucas snapped his fingers and winked at her, flashing her a big grin.

""Yeah them. It wanders out from the brush, rare beauty this thing they never come this far out. Probably starving the poor guy, it was a dry summer that year. It goes into his yard and starts eating his cabbage or whatever and ya know what this jackass does?"" He let the question linger in the air like week old bait.¬† Then he slammed his hand down on the table in a quick swat.

""-He shot 'em POW-just like that right in the neck. He knew where his girlfriend kept her service weapon locked up, ya see."" He casually dropped.¬†""Poor thing starts bellowing, you can hear it all over town like a-mournful beached whale. Bastard doesn't have the decency to just finish it off so he calls the cops to come take care it off. Wayne was livid-was yelling at the deputies to haul his ass away in chains. That was the plan of course-but uh. . ."" he trailed off, hesitation creeping into his boastful attitude.

¬†""-They got to him first."" Tess finished for him in a haunting whisper.¬†

""Take it all with a grain of salt of course-it's all gossip."" Lucas said as he leaned in to spill the tea. ""But-well think about it, big animal dying in the wind, making that much noise. Attracts stuff. You could hear in the air-these shrieks and screams, followed by a couple more rounds shoot off. Then there was nothing, even the big one stopped making noise.""

""When the cops finally arrived-they found the big one all torn into. Big gashes in a line-guts sprawled all over that garden he loved so much."" There was a smug aura to his tone while Lucas spoke.

""They found what was left of the asshole leaned up against the backdoor. There were shell casings and an empty next to him, along with blood and feathers. Something had sliced him up good-"" He stood up, his chair squeaking against the floor. He grabbed a fork to illustrate his point. ""-one long nail-sliced from neck-"" he slowly slid the fork down his jugular and past his chest ""-to his gut. He was hollow when they found him-a trail of meat leading right back into the marshlands.""

He finished his story and slowly sat back down. A pain in my thigh grew as Laura dug her nails into it. I took her hand as our masterful host took a faux bow as he sat back down. Tess was cheering him own, sarcasm dripping with her jeers.

""Well, you've succeeded in scaring the hell out of us, so thank you for that."" I remarked.¬†¬†

""Oh, think nothing of it. I shouldn't bring up that asshole's death like that anyway-it ain't fair to Sydney."" He replied. ""She's a good kid, cried for weeks over that prick."" he shook his head.

""Drinks a bit too much."" Tess mumbled as he shot her a look.

""Hey stifle that, like you wouldn't?"" She was silent at that as Lucas turned his attention back to us. ""They found bloody footprints inside the house-after they gutted him, they took a little stroll, can you believe that? Marcus wasn't well liked so nothing major came of it but Wayne brought in all these rules-no feeding and lock your doors chief among them. No one is as big of a hound bout those rules more than her."" He said.

He let that knowledge dance in the air a bit more, and I was floored honestly.¬†

""If they're so dangerous why doesn't someone step in and-you know. . ."" I trailed off. Lucas took another swig and had an answer for that rearing to go.¬†

""Well in my dad's day they used to. Once a season-get a group together and cull the population-like deer with some bite heh. Got one of his old hunting trophies laying around in the garage I'll show ya sometime.""

""Why'd they stop?"" Tess waved her hand at Laura's question.

""People got in a huff, saying it was poaching and immoral and all that. Which for the nice ones sure-but the raptors?"" and that ended that conversation. I'm positive there was more too it then that, but either they didn't know or didn't think it mattered.

In any case it seemed like the raptors would be here to stay in Eustace. After Marcus' death they were seen as dangerous vermin, but they never seemed to attack. They would go up to houses and try to break in, but that was chalked up as pure curiosity more than anything.

There were the rumors Sydney had spoken of-missing pets and vagrants vanishing into the wetlands. But of course, they were just rumors, probably cooked up by the township to dissuade people from going in there and bugging the dinos.

Besides if they were really a threat, the government would have done something by now right? It sounded like they were trying to convince themselves that nothing was wrong, and I wanted to believe them.

Never mind how much Wayne's dismissive attitude towards Rick's attack bothered them.

Never mind how they kept even their second story windows locked up tight-despite how nice the midnight breeze would feel.

Never mind even Lucas admitted the flock had never been this aggressive, and he had overheard of another possible attack across town.

No, everything was fine-they'd tell us if it wasn't.

The night winded down and the mountain of pasta crumbled as our bellies filled. Lou was making a fuss, and the exhausted looking maid brought him back in, softly bouncing him in his arms. Laura shot up and instantly offered to take him-cradling him in her arms like a natural.

He calmed as she rocked him, and Tess gave her a tired look. The ladies left to go put away dishes as Lucas dragged me outside for cigars. The guy had real Cubans-as thick as a sausage and had that pure smoke smell to them.

He led me out-pitch black out save for the dim porch light that flickered when he slid the door. He whipped out a lighter and made a few puffs-the orange ember glowing like an old jack-o-lantern. I lit mine up and nearly hacked up a lung but damn if that Earthy ""twang"" wasn't worth it.

The pair of us listened to the crickets battle it out with the cicadas for most annoying sound as behind us-our SOs were laughing it up as dishes clattered. I turned back slightly and saw Laura with a huge smile, cradling that kid like he was her own.

He looked conked out-his dopey hat covering his eyes. It was nice seeing her so happy after the weeks of tension we had. It made me realize that Lucas wasn't far off calling me an idiot.¬†

""Listen I'm sorry for busting your balls earlier-"" Lucas began after a long puff. A haze of smoke twirled around his face as he spoke.

""Oh, not at all-probably deserved honestly."" I protested but he held up a hand.

""Well not just that- I've been giving you a hard time all year and that wasn't fair-ya know it goes both ways."" he smiled.

""I appreciate that. I'm sorry if I came off-""¬†

""Water under the bridge."" he raised his cigar and butted it against mine. Ash fell to our feet like slow rain. ""To new beginnings huh?"" I agreed and he slapped me on the back; it felt good despite the throbbing sting.

We stood out there as we finished our smokes, a few feet away from the porch. We stood in the edge of the light-the wild dark grasping at our toes. Despite the grating heat it was beautiful out-the lumbering trees and the loan calls of the marsh greeted us like old friends. I was going to say as much to Lucas, but I noticed he was squinting at something in the dark-hyper focusing on what lay past the shadows.¬†

""What-"" I whispered but was met with a harsh¬†*shhhh*. He pointed towards the tree line. I noticed then how dead silent it had become-like we had been placed in a vacuum. The only sound was the slight breaking of twigs as shapes came into focus.

There were five of them, leering bipedal monsters that stood at about five feet-maybe six. I could make out the outline of faux wings and dazzling crests-their eyes a hollow beacon in the fog of the night. All but one had twin bulbs that looked like luminesce orbs. The pack approached us-and began to take shape in the absence of light. They made chittering sounds to each other, sharp barks like commands.

The one-eyed raptor stood tall among his flock. His gaze was fixed solely on me-and I swear I could feel hatred coming off that thing in waves. They stalked closer, breaking off from a tight knit formation and easing into a deadly sei-circle. Panic began to set in-we were only a few feet away from safety, but I doubt that we could outrun them if it came to it.

I took a small step back-Lucas following my lead. The standoff lasted an eternity, the pack encircling us with greedy precision. If Lucas was scared, he hid it well-his chest steady and his short knees sturdy. His gaze darted back and forth like ping pong balls as he looked at the pack.

One-Eye leaned forward-and I could see fresh scars scabbed over its swollen bulb. It pursed its lips-an oddly human snarl forming and I could see those fishhook teeth jutting forward-hungry for the taste of man. Lucas grabbed my arm-a sign that it was time to book it.

I don't know if it helped but we tossed what was left of our cigars at the snickering pack and turned tail. One Eye snapped at the others and they engaged-heads down as they sprinted gracefully towards us. In seconds they were on us-the gap almost non-existent. If we weren't right next to the sliding glass, I have no doubt you'd be reading my obituary instead.

One of the left raptors pounced-its claws stretched out for the kill-and slammed its body into the sliding door as we slammed it. The door vibrated and a fracked formed where it hit. The raptor scrambled to its feet and hissed at us as it scurried back and forth. I brushed past a panting Lucas and the¬†*click*¬†of the lock rang out as the pack approached the back door.

They cocked their head-not even acknowledging us but were dead focused on the locks. They pawed at the handle-and my blood froze as it moved ever so slightly. Lucas couldn't take his eyes off that crack-a long-jagged line that separated us from certain death.

One-Eye chirped, and the pack slowly backed off and melted back into the dark. The only trace of them was their glowing pearls-fog lights that slowly faded into the brush.Lucas snapped back into reality as he rushed to draw the curtains. Before we could process what had happen a shrill voice called from behind and we jumped out of our skins.""

What's a matter with you boys."" Tess spat. She sounded annoyed till she saw the ghastly looks on us. Laura peaked out from behind her, calming Lou in her arms as he fussed. I opened my mouth to speak but no words could escape. Lucas but in with the save thankfully.

""Ah just-too much wine, heard a croc roaming ya know. Hey gang-it's getting late here, uh too dark out, why don't you kids crash on the couch."" Lucas suggested. I nodded along like a dope as Tess began to protest.

Laura handed off Lou to Tess, and our hosts disappeared to bicker as we settled down on the couch. We let the tv bask us in faded silver as we struggled to pass out. Laura had asked me point blank-why are we still here when it's a minute long walk across the way. I couldn't lie to her and judging by the panicked whispers we heard floating downstairs-neither could Lucas.

Neither of us ended up sleeping, we just held each other close until daybreak. Our restless hosts walked us out and we promised to do this again sometime. Laura is in the shower now-I think she's still shaken up.

As for me? I'm remembering what Sydney said.

These things are smarter than they look-and they can clearly hold a grudge.

Did you know crows can actually remember any instance of wrongdoing towards them. They can pick out the offender out of a group of people-years later even. Then swope in and peck them to death.

The heat is getting worse-and the pack knows my face. I think I'll look into getting a gun after all- I'll update when I can.

Hopefully Lucile will keep them at bay till this whole thing blows over.¬†",2,1753384592.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm trying out a Flex reusable disc for the first time because tampons drain my bank account like crazy and are so uncomfortable. I‚Äôm loving my disc so far! It fits comfortably and is easy to take out (though insertion is difficult for me). But my only concern is bowel movements. I‚Äôve taken my disc out already to dump and rinse but as this is my first cycle with one, I‚Äôm concerned about pooping. I‚Äôm a period poop warrior and I also have a very sensitive stomach. I poop just about every time I eat something thats sat out for more than 5 minutes. Some days everything I eat irritates my stomach and makes me poop. I‚Äôm also a lactose intolerant coffee drinker, which makes me poop. I basically never stop pooping haha. I am worried about if I ever need to poop in public. Will the disc fall out if I poop or will I need to just push it back in place? Maybe I‚Äôm just not good at it, but I don‚Äôt seem to be able to insert the disc over the toilet. The shape of my body makes it really difficult to push the disc all the way in without losing my grip. I can‚Äôt even stand to put it in. I‚Äôve only had success putting it in laying down.

It's probably from the damage my brain took. I appreciate you all for sticking with me as I write this all down, trying to remember all the fine details. I‚Äôll start from the beginning‚Ä¶‚Ä¶¬†¬†



A high squealing that turned into a whimper awoke me. Leaning over, my eyes still blurry and crusty from the night's sleep, I saw him standing in the doorway.



His silhouette in a position of half squat while he frantically danced in place. He needed to go out and I didn‚Äôt want to get up. The warmth I accumulated overnight was something I was reluctant to lose. *How selfish of me,* the thought ran through my mind like a slow burning guilt.¬†



After imagining him pissing all over the floor, I threw the half twisted blanket off, my feet finding home on the small step ladder. As I stepped down I noticed his wiggle transform into glimmers of happiness, knowing that he successfully grabbed my attention.¬†



‚ÄúCome on Vito‚Äù I called while getting his collar ready. As I opened the door to the old trailer, Vito blew by me in focused concentration to make it to his usual spot before relieving himself.¬†



He was still a pup but he was learning relatively quickly. A rescued German Shepherd from the shelter down the road. He was a sweetheart and comforted me through all these crazy life ‚Äúchanges‚Äù. I never understood why no one wanted him.



*How did I get here, why was my life in such a mess?* I've been on top of the world the last few years before everything came tumbling down. I had a home, a family and a better than good job making more than what was needed. Then in an instant, the home was sold, my partner moved away with my child and I lost my job. It was a dark time and I was just looking for some kind of light in all of it.¬†



Now I was living in a camper trailer in the middle of nowhere. Nothing trashy but nothing fancy. For a couple months in the winter I have to haul water in, since the trailer would freeze up. It wasn't made for the north east winters that seemed to get more brutal each year. Maybe that was just me getting older? The electricity would go out frequently since it was at the end of the service line. *At least I still have my dog*. He has been with me through it all and has never judged the many mistakes I have made.



After Vito was content doing his business, he charged back to the door of the camper swiftly. It was 5AM and there was still a chill crawling through the dark morning grass. He's not a fan of the cold, hence his haste.¬†



It was the end of May but felt more like the end of March. Funny how the calendar doesn‚Äôt really line up anymore. But with all the changes happening, the weather was the least of my worries.



Unemployed, I was trying to get a temporary job so I could save up and get back on the road again and travel. It‚Äôs all I really wanted to do but, I was finding it hard to pin down what exactly would work for me. I was quickly running out of money to support myself and there was a light sense of panic that was beginning to fill me.



One night I was surfing the web looking for something, anything to perk my interest. After hours of scrolling through jobs that I wasn't qualified for, I clicked on FB for a quick dopamine release.¬†



Funny how we don't even notice we do it until it's too late. As soon as I logged in my subconscious dopamine pleasure was snuffed by a text message from my best friend Adam, it read:¬†



‚ÄúDude, how have you been? I‚Äôve been thinking about you and I know shit has not been great lately. Just wanted to let you know that I am here if you need to talk. Also, who has been taking your FB photos? I didn‚Äôt realize you had any friends other than me LOL, just kidding, but they are all‚Ä¶.kinda creepy. I love it!‚Äù¬†



I haven‚Äôt had time to post anything, I‚Äôve been grieving about my life and how it spiraled out of control. I‚Äôve always needed time to cope with sudden negative changes that have surfaced.



Curious, I quickly logged in to my account and checked to see what images had been uploaded. Is it possible someone has hacked my account?¬†



Quickly, the eerie photos loaded that he was talking about. I immediately knew they were ones not taken by me. It was like someone was sitting on my couch taking pictures of me at my computer, in the dark, with terrible exposure. I was completely dumbfounded by them.¬†



I didn‚Äôt recall the last time someone was over and sat on that old couch, I probably wouldn‚Äôt have let them. It was so old and covered in unremovable stains. A freebie that was picked up out of desperation in a time that I was financially incapable of buying anything at all.¬†



I came to the conclusion that someone must have taken them from when I initially moved in. I had a couple friends, if that's what you want to call them, crashed here when I was moving my stuff. They were more Adams friends, I haven't seen them since. Maybe them? I shook it off and deleted the weird pics before shutting down the PC.¬†



Suddenly the realization set in that I didn‚Äôt feed Vito and internally cursed myself for forgetting, again. I let out his name. ‚ÄúVito!‚Äù



As I turned, I realized he was quietly sitting on the couch in a perfect pose, panting slowly while locked onto my motion. ‚ÄúI'm sorry buddy‚Äù I said in an embarrassing tone. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go eat‚Äù.¬†



He clamored down from the couch and followed me into the kitchen. 8:30 was an hour past his dinner time. Dogs are creatures of habit and love routine. I quickly mixed his food. As I placed it, he acted like he was starving and started lapping before the bowl hit the ground. ‚Äú*How dramatic*‚Äù I thought.



My memory has not been right since the accident. I've been angry. Angry at the fact I forget, causing this compounding loop of hate, hate that reaches out its ugly claws to try to find something to blame. Someone hit me on my motorcycle a couple years back, I almost died. I took a life flight to St. Elizabeths Hospital. Since then, my body and mind have not been the same. I won‚Äôt go into crazy details about the accident but it was not my fault. When it happened, it left me with several broken bones and minor brain damage. It‚Äôs funny, I don‚Äôt feel like I have brain damage, I feel like I got a second chance. I just get hung up on some things when it comes to remembering, long or short term. It‚Äôs just another thing to add to the list of how fucked up things have been.¬†



I sat on the deck while Vito was eating inside. I watched as the sun slammed into the hillside projecting streams of orange and red into the distance. I don‚Äôt know how long I gazed, it brought me a calming feeling. Vito finished up and hummed by the screen door, his signal to be let out. It‚Äôs funny when it‚Äôs just you and a dog and how easily it can be to read each other. As though a different language is formed between the two. You can almost think and feel what the other is feeling at any given time. Truly man's best friend.¬†



I opened the door and watched him lazily trot with his tongue half dropped from the side of his mouth. Ignorant to the world and the vile things that happen in it. He quickly returned and we both retreated inside for the night.	



The next day came and I had previous plans. As I patted him on the head, I told Vito goodbye and jumped into the old truck to go into town and have lunch with Allison. An old friend from back in the day, high-school time. She was one of the few that still communicated with me after high school. She was always breathtaking but never on the market. I missed my opportunities with her. I never had the gall to communicate with women.



I was either completely egotistical or she definitely looked at me with some kind of feelings, maybe. But, I was too chickenshit to ask and ruin what we currently had, so I left it at that. I met her at a small dinner at the edge of town called Busters. It was exactly what you would expect for a small town. Cheap wood tables, cheap placemats and cheap food. Living in a cheap town surprises you when you venture out and find out that most things are better than you think.¬†



I continued straight inside when I saw her rusty Bronco was already parked out front. She was sitting a couple booths back near the entry. Blond hair, blue eyes. She was absolutely stunning in that old YSU hoodie that should have been thrown out a decade ago. She wasn't the type of girl that flaunted her beauty but was well kept. You‚Äôre gonna think I'm a creep, but when I sat down, I could smell her. It was intoxicating. Floral notes with spring clean undertones. Not too strong, just how I like it.



‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up Ally?‚Äù I said in a calm voice.¬†



‚ÄúHow are you Mathew?‚Äù She said in an excited tone.¬†



‚ÄúI am as good as I can be‚Äù.¬†



She knew my situation and has been a good support system for me, even though her boyfriend Dale doesn't care for me one bit. He's the quiet, jealous kind. Maybe he should be? I don‚Äôt know, I feel like Ally and I were always meant to be together but, I might just be toxic and selfish.



‚ÄúI passed my final exam!‚Äù Allison proclaimed.



‚ÄúThat's great, you studied hard for that!‚Äù I said reassuringly.¬†



I leaned in, cutting the small talk ‚ÄúHas everything been okay at home?‚Äù¬†



Maybe I went to the delicate subject too soon? She looked at me like she didn‚Äôt want to touch that topic but, I cared, I really did. She lowered her voice as she scanned the room.¬†



‚ÄúHe hasn‚Äôt hit me again, not like that.‚Äù She said as she lowered her head in something that contained some form of shame.¬†



‚ÄúIm sorry, I didn‚Äôt want to bring it up but you know I will break his fucking legs‚Äù. I stared at her intensely.



‚ÄúStop it psycho‚Äù she said as she started laughing hysterically, as she lightly dusted my shoulder.¬†



‚ÄúYou know if I couldn‚Äôt handle myself, I would call.‚Äù She continued while batting her eyes.



I shrugged it off, just happy I didn‚Äôt make her too uncomfortable. A short little Hungarian lady approached with two ice waters, a pen and notepad.¬†



‚ÄúWhat will it be?‚Äù She said while dawning the waters, smiling but also transitioning straight to business.



‚ÄúI'll take the club‚Äù Allison quickly responded.



I just repeated, ‚ÄúThe same‚Äù Noticing the impatient look on the servers face and the fact that I was lost in conversation,¬†



Taking a sip of water, I reminisced ‚ÄúDo you remember when I moved into the trailer and everyone helped me get settled in?‚Äù¬†



She smiled. ‚ÄúYeah, you went from having everything to nothing, so‚Ä¶ it wasn‚Äôt much work.‚Äù She said as she gave a slight chuckle.



‚ÄúItems just weigh you down, I‚Äôve never felt such a burden lifted like getting rid of¬† possessions. But, apart from that, I came across some weird photos that I apparently uploaded and don‚Äôt remember taking. Just pictures of my back while I was sitting at my computer.‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúYou were probably high or something and just don‚Äôt remember‚Äù. She motioned her fingers to her lips like she was hitting a joint.¬†



I chuckled. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre probably right‚Äù. A moment of silence fell before I let the situation dissolve and shrugged it off.



As we were finishing up I looked into her eyes, deep and concerning ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt hesitate to call me if you ever need anything. You have always been there for me when I needed you. I can at least repay the kindness you have given me.‚Äù I lowered my eyes and then locked onto hers.



She hesitated from the intensity in my eyes and replied with a blushing smile. ‚ÄúPlease take care of yourself too, Mathew‚Äù.



The server came back quickly with the check. This woman was on a mission to provide impeccable service. I respect that. After paying, we walked through the threshold into the bright sunny day. My eyes squinted in pain as they adjusted to the sudden change.



Though relatively reclusive, I felt comfortable around Alison. She gave off positive energy in a dark and hostile world. It‚Äôs almost intoxicating with a splash of respect to carry yourself like that these days. She spun me around for a hug.¬†



‚ÄúThanks for lunch‚Äù she whispered into my left ear.



I just nodded as she jumped into the Bronco, fired it up and crept away.



I arrived home to see Vito in the small window of the trailer watching me walk to the doorway. As I turned the key, I heard him skitter to the doorway. He leapt by me¬† into the yard as I continued in, dropping my keys and wallet while kicking off my shoes. I left the door open to the screen, the temperature was just perfect for it in the late afternoon. I sat down at my PC and started looking again.¬†



Some time had passed when I suddenly realized I hadn‚Äôt let Vito back in yet. I turned my chair to get out from under the desk so I could stand up. As I stood, I noticed Vito sitting on the couch staring at me like he always does with that dumb, happy look. It hit me as quick as I saw him, I didn‚Äôt remember letting him back in. It‚Äôs been hours. My eyes didn't leave him as I tried to pinpoint if I actually let him back in.¬†



He just stared back as he rhythmically panted. I shook my head, questioning my mind. They say people that are losing their minds don‚Äôt notice, so I must have just forgotten that I let him back in?¬†



I went through the regular evening motions of feeding myself and Vito before sitting in the chair to relax for the night. Just then, my cell phone rang, It was Allison‚Ä¶



I stared at her name on my phone for a moment, something wasn't right, it was almost 9:30 and she had never called this late.



‚ÄúAre you OK?‚Äù I asked as I swiped the green icon.¬†



On the other end I could just hear muffled sobs before that piece of shit Dale started screaming. Then, the phone disconnected. I hate that guy. He was like a douche bag, varsity jock that was known for beating up women. That shit makes me sick. I immediately tried to call her back but no answer. After the unsuccessful call, I sent her a text to call me as soon as she could. She quickly responded with ‚ÄúI am coming over‚Äù.



Ten minutes passed before I heard the gravel popping under rolling tires enter the driveway. She only lived about 15 minutes away from the long winding driveway that led to my mansion on wheels. She must have been speeding. Vito started to bark frantically at the incoming vehicle, I assured him it was ok and he calmed down but still stayed vigilant. Out of the shadows I saw the tiny silhouette of Allison emerge, walking towards the front porch.¬†



I met her halfway down my uneven sidewalk. She sobbed as she tucked her head into my chest, eyes already streaming, makeup running. ‚ÄúI won't ‚Ä¶.I can‚Äôt‚Ä¶go back there.‚Äù



‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to, you can stay here as long as you need.‚Äù I said calmly as I comforted her the best I could.¬†



All the time, Vito sat in the doorway behind the screen watching. As Allison walked closer to the porch, the light caught her face and I saw Dale's latest work of art. One large purple swollen lump right under her left eye. I swallowed my anger for the moment, she didn‚Äôt need more of it right now. I had to put that away and help her the best I could. I opened the door and let her in, checking over my right shoulder before closing the door behind me. She sat on the couch and blankly stared at the wall.



‚ÄúI should have left his ass a long time ago. I just got caught up in it all.‚Äù She said as she ripped off her coat with anger.¬†



I didn‚Äôt say anything, this wasn‚Äôt about me, this was her moment to vent.¬†



‚ÄúI just thought things would get better, but they never did. I‚Äôm never going back there.‚Äù She said as she looked at me with intensity.¬†



‚ÄúLike I said, you can stay as long as you need‚Äù I said as I looked around at the less desirable living conditions that I have been in. *This was no place for a lady, it was barely a bachelor pad. I blame it on the depression.*



‚ÄúYou can really take a hit‚Äù I said as I gestured to her eye.¬†



She started laughing as she swung and caught me on the arm with a jab. As soon as it hit she leaned forward and locked her lips onto mine. An explosion of passion turned everything liquid. Her lips felt like they belonged to mine, like home. She quickly reached down and slid her hand up my thigh, not going too far but far enough to make my whole body vibrate. Every chemical started dumping into a stream of lust, long overdue. Her hand advanced and I felt her soft touch through the outside of my wranglers. She stripped her shirt off while never leaving my lips, cautious to not miss out on the fire that was burning in-front of us. I looked over and saw Vito quietly watching from a distance.¬†



‚ÄúDo you want me to put him in another room?‚Äù I said, talking through her lips as they desperately searched for mine.¬†



She didn‚Äôt even react to my words. She quickly pulled my shirt over my head and pushed me back onto the couch, her breasts pressing to my chest. Things moved so quickly, before I knew it, I entered. Her eyes rolled back like pure possession had taken over.¬†



She continued to grind deeper and deeper like satisfaction was a competition and she refused to lose. She had all this anger built up and she was turning it into a different kind of energy.¬†



Her soft skin enveloped me as I lost track of the perceived time. It was animal-like, she took what she needed, knowing that I was also a beneficiary. I don‚Äôt remember much after that. I think I blacked out from exhaustion at some point.



Daylight peeked through the edge of the blinds, that part right where the edge piece snapped off. Squinting at the clock, I struggled to gain focus and finally gave up. I rolled onto my back and stared at the ceiling as bits and pieces of last night wandered back into my mind. *A welcome bit of light*.



The sound of pans clinking and water running broke me from my thoughts. As my senses awoke, the smell of breakfast became more clear.



I haven't had breakfast in this trailer since maybe the first week here. After that, it just didn't seem like something I wanted to spend my time on.



I made my way to the couch and plopped down, clearly giving up my position.



‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, these eggs might kill us.‚Äù She said as she placed a plate on the coffee table. She gave me a smile and just stood there in just her panties.¬†



‚ÄúYou don't have anything in your fridge and the things you do are‚Ä¶..questionable.‚Äù Arms crossed, disappointment evident but I could still see the passion in her eyes and a small smirk dented on her¬† battered cheek.



I just sat there, staring at her beautiful form, perfectly symmetrical. A moment that I never wanted to forget. She went from nympho to mother flawlessly. She was part caretaker, part vixen. No doubt in my mind I was completely lost in her. It‚Äôs almost like we both knew this would happen, it just needed to be properly triggered.¬†



‚ÄúI gotta let Vito out.‚Äù I said as I walked to the door.¬†



‚ÄúI already did.‚Äù She responded before I wasted any time.¬†¬†



He sat there on the floor panting, watching. I walked over and gave him a rub on his head, he grunted with pleasure when I found his favorite spot.¬†



‚ÄúI have to go get things out of the house.‚Äù She said as she started gathering her clothes. ‚ÄúI will take you up on staying here for a few if that‚Äôs still okay?‚Äù She didn't wait for a response as she headed to the doorway, throwing that ugly hoodie on.



‚ÄúOf course, be careful.‚Äù I said as she closed the door looking back with a playful smile.



I sat there for what seemed hours, basking in the stench of last night. I had nothing to my name but, I felt happy for once. At least I had Allison. I went and took a long shower and when I was done I jumped back on the computer while I waited for Allison to come back. If we were going to build a life, I needed to get everything figured out. I felt motivated. Purpose restored.



As I was looking, I pulled out my phone and noticed another missed text message from Adam, it read: ‚ÄúBro, did you lose your fucking mind! I can‚Äôt believe you posted a video of yourself like that on the internet? Who is the new chick?‚Äù



My stomach dropped. *What did he mean by that*? I logged into my account to find out that I uploaded a new video eight hours ago.¬†



It was me and Allison. I had her laying on the coffee table slowly thrusting. All of our intimate moments on blast. Who could have recorded this video? I didn't have a security system or anything fancy like that. Did she set a camera up and record us to get back at Dale? The angle of the video makes it look like it was being taken from the couch, just like those previous pictures.¬†



Covered in sweat, the thoughts raced through my mind. I quickly deleted what I could before anyone else could see it. It's not like how it used to be though, everything is instant and people are so obsessed that it's almost like they are waiting. *God damn vultures!* My parents, my nieces and nephews could have seen this, who knows. I didn‚Äôt know the extent of the damage, until my phone rang. I was met by rage clear as day.



‚ÄúWhat are you? Some kind of sick fucking pervert!‚Äù I could hear the disgust and anger in her voice.¬†



‚ÄúThose were our private moments! You wanna know how I found out! My mom called me crying saying she saw me doing unspeakable things on social media. Then to top it off, Dale called me telling me I‚Äôm the new hoe on the block! Everyone probably this! Don't fucking talk to me again!‚Äù



Before I could get a word out, the call ended. I sat there in silence trying to put everything together.

I knew I obviously didn't do it and the way Allison was blowing up on me clearly tells me she didn't want to be top video on some amateur porn site.¬†



I turned and looked over to the couch and in that moment Vito‚Äôs eyes locked with mine. He didn't move, like at all. I stood up and watched intensively while he sat there and looked at me. Then, his eye twitched. It was almost unnoticeable. It closed and opened in a way that no animal moves. It was almost like a Chuck E Cheese animatronic motion that sent chills down my spine. I was frozen in place.



‚ÄúVito.‚Äù I called out.¬†



His head leaned to the side. I could not take my eyes off of him now. Something wasn't right. At that time, I noticed him sitting right where the pictures and video were recorded from. He sat there all the time now that I think about it. It was completely insane to think but what happened doesn't have any explanation. So the mind wanders for reasoning. I felt like reality was breaking away and I was trying to bring myself back to earth.



I tried calling and texting Allison but I got nothing. She probably already went back to Dale, I blew my chance with my dream girl, again. *Why did things keep falling apart?*



A day passed and still nothing from Ally. I felt sick to my stomach but it might be because I haven't had anything to eat since this all went down.



The stress of completely losing her started to mount. I went into the kitchen and threw a piece of cheese between two pieces of bread, then returned to the living room.¬†



Out of the corner of my eye I saw Vito sitting on the couch staring at me. I started to feel more uncomfortable with him around. His stare was piercing and wrong. His presence is more and more‚Ä¶ off-putting.¬†



I locked eyes on him and caught what I would call a ‚Äúglitch‚Äù. His head was moving from left to right and then resetting kinda like a record player when it ends its side and brings the needle back over to reset. Slow, calculated motions that felt more and more unrealistic. Mechanical.¬†



I calmly walked over and cautiously put my hand on his head, gently petting him, running my hand down the back of his neck. This time I felt something‚Ä¶ off. Something was protruding from his neck, something rough and flexible. I brushed back his fur and noticed two little wires, one red and one blue. My heart started to pound as his head slowly turned and his eyes met mine. He looked into me like the jig was up. Just then, a knock at the door.



‚ÄúHey, let me in.‚Äù Allison's voice muffled through the wooden door.¬†



She didn‚Äôt sound excited. My heart sank. The dog would have to wait, I needed to find a way to fix things.



I opened the door to Allison standing on my front porch, drenched from the rain with a small bag on her shoulder. She walked by me quickly without making eye contact and continued silently into the kitchen. I closed the door and followed. Before I rounded the corner, I started apologizing before she cut me off.¬†



‚ÄúAllison, I just want‚Ä¶.‚Äù



‚ÄúI don't want you to think I forgive you for what you did‚Äù She sneered as she tossed her bag on the table.¬†



I thought about how this conversation might go, if I ever got the chance to have it. I could play the crazy liar card and tell her I didn't do it and that my dog is a robot with cameras in his eyes. Or I could take the fall for something I didn't even do to maybe, just maybe, be able to fix this. I don‚Äôt feel like I could tell her about Vito, she definitely would think I was crazy. That shit was too weird to drop on her until I figured out what the hell was actually going on.¬†



‚ÄúI am not coming back to say what you did was okay. I'm really pissed, half the town thinks I'm a slut, but I don‚Äôt have anywhere else to go. My mom won‚Äôt talk to me. She said she needs time to process what she saw and Dale said I'm never allowed back. I just need to stay the night and I will figure something out tomorrow.‚Äù



Just then, Vito walked into the kitchen and started pawing at his bowl. I just stared at him while I studied his movements, waiting for him to spark or make some kind of servo noise that never happened.



‚ÄúAre you going to feed that poor dog?‚Äù Allison groaned as she brushed his back, talking to him like a baby.¬†



I slowly got his food and mixed it while not taking my eyes off of him. I gave him his food and obsessively watched.



‚ÄúWhy are you acting so weird?‚Äù She said, drilling me with her eyes.¬†



I thought to myself, *a lot of fucking weird shit has just happened.* I took my gaze off of Vito and returned it to Allison.¬†



‚ÄúI'm fine‚Äù I said while shaking it off and responding to her original question. ‚ÄúYeah, of course you can stay. I am really sorry about what happened.‚Äù



She rolled her eyes at me and started making a nest on the couch.¬†



‚ÄúYou will sleep in your bed.‚Äù She commanded, ‚ÄúYou probably have cameras to watch me out here anyway.‚Äù She said sarcastically before she rolled over.¬†



She was clearly not here to forgive me. That video would have a long lasting impact on both of our lives.



I didn't say anything, I honestly couldn't think of anything that would help at this point and my heart was crushed by the thought of her hating me.¬†



I let Vito out one more time, shut out the lights and retreated to my bed.



That night I woke up to the sound of Vito lapping and slurping out of his bowl, something that happens nightly. But now that I was awake, I had the urge to go check on Ally. Thinking about the train wreck of a day we had, I didn't want to bother her since she was obviously still really upset with me.¬†



It was still dark as the early morning started to creep in. As I laid there in the scratchy linen sheets, I couldn't help but to think about my suspicions of Vito.¬†



Have I gone completely mad? Or am I stuck in some type of Twilight Zone episode? Is my dog real? Or some kind of futuristic robot that was given to me by the shelter? Was the dog some kind of sleeper cell that was suddenly triggered to start ruining my life? The thoughts raced through my mind for quite some time until I succumbed to sleep.



The morning light that came through my window was unforgiving. I noticed a strange smell that was unrecognizable. It was like iron and copper melted together, musty and wet.¬†



I gathered myself in preparation for the next encounter with Allison and slowly opened the bedroom door into the living room. There was absolute silence and darkness. I always kept the curtains drawn. Nosey neighbors are partial to these parts.



As I rounded the corner I saw the couch with the back of Allison's head peaking just over the armrest. As I walked closer to the couch, I felt the carpet give an unwelcome squish. At that moment, terrible thoughts bombarded me. I rushed over and dropped to my knees.¬†



Allison was naked and split right up the center of her body. A jagged cut that started in her pelvic area and ended right at the base of her throat. Organs were pulled out and placed on each of the sides of her body in a haphazardly manner. Blood was soaked into the couch dripping off the fringe and saturated into the surrounding floor.¬†



Her face looked peaceful, pale, and had little splashes of blood on her delicate white cheeks. It all looked gruesome and maniacal. I noticed I had blood on myself, probably from all that was pooled around the couch. Bloody paw prints were littered throughout, some leading around the trailer.¬†



I stood up, cautiously moving in case the intruder was still stalking. My mind was racing, going over how this could have happened. As I rounded the living room to the kitchen, there was Vito, sitting in the middle of a bloody mess staring, motionless, statuesque. He had something unrecognizable chewed into small pieces in front of him. Maybe an organ?¬†



He was matted in Allison's blood, just staring and panting. I felt rage flood into me like a hundred oceans. He took the only good thing I had in my life. I rushed back to my bedroom and came back with a baseball bat. Without clear thought, I proceeded to strike Vito with it over and over until there was no more life in his body. He never even moved or flinched during the attack I unleashed. God‚Ä¶there was so much blood. I kneeled down and started combing through the decimated corpse of my beloved friend turned killer.¬†



I mashed through his insides, looking for a central processing unit, wires, something. All I found was biological matter, smashed and squeezed. I was covered. Vito must have still ripped her open, there was no signs of forced entry that I could see. I will have to call the cops and let them know that my dog has been acting funny and attacked my friend that was sleeping on the couch. *Was that believable? Because this sure as fuck looks like I did it, especially after bashing the dogs brains in. Fuck, what have I done‚Ä¶*



My phone started to ring, I looked at the caller ID, it was Adam. I hesitated, then answered. ‚ÄúListen man, I can‚Äôt talk right now. There is something serious going down and I need to figure out what to do.‚Äù



There was a long silence then ‚ÄúDude, how did you make that look so‚Ä¶..real? I was just watching it and was thinking, this is so crazy real looking! Like all the blood and the body parts. You really took it to the next level, man. That's some dark shit, very creative though.‚Äù His voice sounded hesitant and confused.¬†



The knot in my throat started to tighten as the phone fell from my hand with him still talking on the other end. I slowly made my way to the computer. It all started to fall into place in my mind. I sat down and logged in.¬†



Another video was uploaded 5 hours ago. It was labeled ‚ÄúHow to split a whore in two‚Äù. I sat and stared in shock as it started to play.¬†



In the video, Allison was fast asleep on the couch. I slowly entered naked from my bedroom, eyes blank. I walked over and stood above Allison for at least 15 minutes, just quietly watching her sleep, slightly swaying from side to side. Then I disappeared to the kitchen, maybe I was sleeping walking? I don't remember ever having issues with this in the past. My hand tightened around the mouse when I returned from the kitchen with a contractor bag.¬†



I pulled at the bag and fanned it to fill it with air. Just as she started to stir from the rustling of the bag, I slipped it over her head and cinched it down. She jerked violently out of surprise. Pushing back as we both forced the coffee table to the side. I watched as I leveraged all my weight, counter acting her struggle. Pulling so tight that the plastic started to stretch over and around her face, lips opening and closing violently, like a fish gasping for water. She fought with all her might, arms and legs flailing frantically. With muffled hums she gasped for air that would never come, clawing at my chest with one last flurry of hope. Her flailing slowed and became more disorganized, like someone searching in the dark. The effort settled to a light twitching motion as the last electrical pulses made their way down her arms and legs. Then, relaxation.¬†



The whole time I moved as if in some kind of trance-like state. *That wasn't me! I don‚Äôt remember doing any of that!*



I held her affectionately, her head still wrapped in the thick plastic, pressed against my chest, like a mother would a child. I laid with her for some time before walking outside for a short moment and returning with a powered jigsaw.¬†



I stopped the video. I couldn't watch any more. By looking at the current state of her body, I knew what happened next. My body suddenly went into flight mode. I knew I didn't have much time before the video would draw attention. I needed to get out of here but I didn't know if I should do something with the body or just leave it. I still cared for her and didn't want to leave her this way. I packed a bag as quickly as I could, knowing my freedom was at stake. I looked at myself in the mirror, *what have I become?* Then a pounding at the door.



I wrote all this down because this is all I could remember about my life so far, I think the accident messed my brain up. I will keep writing, when I finally remember what happened next.

I've learned a lot about the town since I last posted.

 No major attacks since Rick. Well sort off-but we'll get to that. The morning after I woke up to a polite knock on the front door. I found an envelope slipped under with my name neatly written in blue ink.¬† I'm going to transcribe the whole flyer here now-it's wild stuff:‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ

‚ÄÇ**""To our friends and neighbors in the township of Eustace""**

*""Last night our Friend Rick suffered a horrible injury-and the loss of a beloved family pet. While this is a tragedy and our hearts go out to his family at this time-we would be remiss if we didn't highlight this incident as why we have strict guidelines about how we engage with the wildlife.* 

*During the course of our investigation into last night's incident-it has been brought to our attention that Rick was improperly securing his bird feeder and filming the raptor pack. We shouldn't need to remind you all we have very strict polices about feeding the raptors specifically and VERY strict NDAs about recordings. We shouldn't need to remind you all-but last night suggests otherwise.*

 *Under normal circumstances these violations would be grounds for eviction proceedings but in light of this tragedy-we feel a lesson has been harshly learned. We'd also like to say we are posting new rules about securing your pets indoors during certain hours- and enacting a curfew of 8pm starting tonight. These rules are to ensure no more bite incidents occur-they are not punishments.* 

*Again, we would like to extend our thoughts and prayers to Rick's family at this time. We have been told he is stable and will be coming home in a few days. Please direct any notes of well wishes or gift baskets to his lovely wife Marla.* 

*The heatwave is expected to continue-so please, do not agitate our cretaceous neighbors any more than they already are. Be mindful, be kind, and above all be safe. Have a wonderful day.""*‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ

**""From Head of the Eustace Township Commission""**

My blood boiled at this-it was so tasteless and impersonal. A man was mauled by a dinosaur and all Wayne could muster was a letter full of corpo speak? I tore it up and marched out the door-shielding my eyes from the melting rays of the sun. 

Across the way Tessa was standing in a bathrobe mumbling to herself as she crumpled the flyer in frustration.¬† An egg-shaped¬†shadow loomed behind her, trying to usher her back inside. She brushed him off and yelled something to the effect of ""Cowardly bastard."" as she huffed back into their home. Lucas stuck his head out and saw me gawking. He gave a polite wave- a first for him-and retreated as well. 

I didn't know what I was thinking of doing, but it occurred to me that Marla had seen that flyer as well, and that was the last thing she needed. I stormed next door-hoping to intercept the letter. Their front porch was worn and well used- an old bench leaned against the tiled walls. I rang the doorbell, a harsh chime echoing through their home. I was met with silence, and in my hurried state I leaned over to the driveway and saw it was empty-save a police cruiser. 

Officer Sydney was watching me lose my mind-an oddly calm look on her face. She was wearing her blackout shades and sipping softly out of a styrofoam cop. She was sitting on the hood of her cruiser and patted next to her. I joined her, face flushing with beets as I stewed about the flyer. She pulled out a try with three other cups behind her.

""Want one?"" she offered. I grabbed one and took a swig, almost immediately throwing up from the taste of baileys and decaf.

¬†""Bit early isn't it."" I choked out.

""Nonsense. It's five o'clock somewhere and all that jazz."" She took another sip of the spiked coffee. ""You won't find her-she's parked at the county hospital till they give Rick the all clear."" She explained.¬†

""Then what are you doing here?"" I squared my face at her.

¬†""Waiting till they come back-to make sure they kept their mouth shut."" She said grimly. ""Ridiculous I know, they've lived here all their life. They know better-which is why I can't wrap my head around why he didn't mention they were coming up to his frigging backdoor."" She complained.

¬†""Did you see that note, it's abhorrent."" I sat next to her, the car jolting as I did.

""I delivered them-god forbid Wayne do any heavy lifting. Well more than he already does."" She cracked. ""There'll be grumbling and pouting-but it'll die down. Always does.""¬†She turned to me and anticipated my next question.

""Barton county has the highest number of reported disappearances in the state-both animal and people. Wayne likes to pretend otherwise but even here I get calls about pets snatched in the middle of the night or attempted break ins.""

""Last week I got a call-few streets down. The Martinez family-said the daughter got up in the middle of the night and saw a monster scratching at the back door. Said she could see the handle jiggling-and these glowing orbs staring right at her. Didn't find the monster-just a couple loose feathers and scratch marks in the glass."" She recalled, taking a longer sip. 

I felt the urge to join her on that one, didn't sting any less going down the second time.¬†

""Jesus."" I muttered.¬†

""I don't think he's down here-if he was these things would have been wiped out ages ago."" She admitted flippantly.

¬†""Even Lucile?"" I tried to joke. She looked me dead in the eyes, I could feel the rage burning behind her shades.

""Every last one of them."" She said. ""These things are smarter than they let on. They know exactly what they're doing, and they aren't afraid of us. We've coddled them too much."" She spat with disgust. 

¬† The heat sizzled overhead, and I began to fuse to the hood of the cruiser. In the distance a jeep pulled up in front of my place, and Laura stepped out wearing jorts and a flowery sun top. 

She scanned the yard and saw me sitting with Sydney, eyebrows raised. I cleared my throat and jumped off the car, half-drunk cup in hand and a little buzzed.¬†

""I better go say hi-uh thanks for the drink."" I blurted out.

""Sure, sure. Tell your lady friend there if she doesn't move that thing off the curb by noon, I'm having it towed."" She said with a pointed grin. I laughed as I walked away, but I got the feeling she wasn't kidding. 

I ran up and gave Laura a peck on the cheek and scooped her up, pretty much carrying her to the door. Her face flustered with surprise as she wrapped her arms around me. We had barely made it in the front door when¬†we both collapsed on the floor in a giggling heap. 

Afterwards we relaxed on the couch, curtains drawn to protect the neighborhood decency. I had just sat back down after getting us both some water as she snuggled next to me, a content but curious look on her face.

""What brought that on-guilty conscience?"" She teased and slapped my bald chest.

""What-oh no, no nothing like that I just- I'm really happy to see you."" I said as I held her close. ""It's been kind of-tense-to put it lightly."" I explained. 

I told her all that happened in the short few days I had seen her, the mob, Wayne and his plumpness, and the raptor attack. By the end of it her curiosity and amusement were replaced by panic and worry, she cursed to herself as she began searching her pockets and mine.

""Jesus-I had no idea, I'm so sorry. Ugh come on I know I brought some."" She mumbled.

""I thought you were gonna quit."" I gently reminded.

""I thought you were going to ask me to move in."" She retorted with a dagger in my ego. ""A-ha."" She said producing a half open pack of Newports from her cloths. I sighed and went to the kitchen for a lighter, Laura putting on my blue button down as she followed.

""Fair enough babe, just, outside-please the odor."" I complained. She obliged and snatched the lighter from my hands. The mug gy air zoomed in like we were in an airlock as she opened the sliding door. She set her sights on the grazing Lucile as she sparked up and inhaled deeply. Lucile was doing laps in the pool-her long paddle of a tail like a mini motor engine.

 She seemed anxious, and I noticed there wasn't any new gore by the pool. The crate from last night lay in the yard-shattered and all that remained of its cargo was a pinkish hue. Laura studied the big lizard as she smoked, the gears in her head ever turning. Finally, she pointed a lit finger at her and spoke her mind.¬†

""She's hungry-but she's not hunting."" She stated. Every few seconds she was glancing at the shed as she paced the pool. She let out a low whine, her teeth clattering together in a rapid snapping noise. Laura turned to me, a devilish look on face. ""You haven't fed her yet?""¬†

""I was busying day drinking."" I said as I took a swig of water, sobriety running at full capacity now. She rolled her eyes and used a free hand to drag me out into the swampy air. She dragged me over to the shed as Lucile slowed her pace, her interest piquing and her jaws watering. 

We picked out a box of salmon and a box of halibut. When we cracked open the containers-the stench flew out of them. Lucile cooed and dragged lumbering self out of the pool. She was eyeing Laura with an odd amount of suspicion, yet when she looked at me, I got this sense of-begrudging familiarity.¬†

 My feelings were confirmed when she trudged right up to me and plopped down-sitting like a guarding sphinx. Her gaze was polity locked on the crates. Laura circled around the crouching dino-a look of awe upon her.¬†

""I described her to Brian-he said ""assuming I'm not pulling the other one-"" she's a type of Spinosaurus. Fully amphibious, deadly stalker of the Cenomanian stage."" She prattled. ""Take a look at her sail here, the colors and patterns-not camouflage, too vibrant for that. Maybe to ward off larger predators, similar to frogs who have rainbow colored skin."" She speculated aloud.¬†

""That would mean she's-venomous or something like that right?"" I said, struggling to recall something from dozens of docs she's made me slog through. She smiled at me the way you smile at your dog when they tear up a chew toy.¬†

""Something like that. Have you hand fed her?"" she asked, turning towards the halibut.

¬†""No, I like being alive."" I said. She laughed at that.

""Sam, she weighs about three tons-if she wanted to, you'd be dead already."" She reminded, taking a slimy fish head in hand. She outstretched her hand to Lucile's jaw-who was eyeing her out of the side of her emeralds. 

Before I could warn her, she snapped her jaws, and I heard Laura yelp as Lucile groaned and snatched the fish. She chewed it slowly, savoring the raw melty feeling of the meat-all while mad dogging my girlfriend. Lucile nudged her with her snout and made a move towards the crate. 

That's when Laura did the most batshit insane thing I have ever seen. 

She put on a scowl, raised her hand and gently smacked Lucile on the snout while making this *tsst* sound with her teeth. Lucile whined-clearly taken back by this affrontery. Laura wagged her soon to be chomped hand like she was scolding a child. 

""No-bad."" she commanded in this deep voice. I was too stunned to speak, otherwise I would have tackled her and brought her back in. She reached down, maintaining direct eye contact with Lucile as she slammed her tail on the ground, a jet engine sounding off from her gullet. She grabbed another and slowly brought it towards the buzzsaw. 

She raised it above her head, and Lucile followed the piper. Laura inched the fish forward and uttered a booming but simple command; ""Gentle."" To my astonishment Lucile neatly picked the tip with her teeth and brought it away-quickly devouring it when she realized she was safely out of reach.¬† Laura grinned like a mad woman and reached down and patted her scaley skull like she was a golden retriever.¬†

""Thatta girl, good job."" She cooed as she scratched. Lucile broke out in this crocodilian trance, eyes widening and lips parting into a sinister smile. I moved closer, taking in this bizarre sight. Laura caught me gawking and nudged toward the salmon. I was hesitant, flashes of the carnage of last night flowing through me.

 But I put aside my distrust and grabbed a mound of pink. Lucile regarded me, annoyance in her eyes. I stuck out my fist and she paused, unsure if she should just snatch it. Laura urged me on-and I held my breath and shakily uttered her command: ""G-Gentle."" 

She was less graceful with me, making a big show of opening her maw, her rancid tuna breath melting my eyebrows. She chomped down on a bit of pink and tugged it away from me in one swift motion. She turned her head away, though she nudged closer to me. My hand trembled as I reached towards her head. She froze midchew when I laid my hand down but let me pat her.

 Her hide felt cool to the touch, leathery but smooth. Like a fresh belt. Laura giggled as she watched me awkwardly pat the dinosaur, and to be honest I don't think Lucile was too thrilled either. 

 Laura knelt down and grabbed another one, a quick whistle leaving her lips. Lucile groaned and played along-content enough I suppose. I was scratching her scales, getting into it as she gently chomped on her fishy treats.

""This is amazing."" I said Laura, sounding like a little kid. She smiled at me as she continued feeding. We spent the whole day with Lucile, feeding her fish and trying-and often failing-to teach her tricks. She did seem to get a kick out of following us around the yard with food in our hands. 

She stomped like a fussy puppy-catching the thrown meat like a party trick. We watched her graze in the pool-I listened to her go on and on about everything she had learned about Spinos in the short time she had been gone. I tried to pay attention to what she was saying, because she was so passionate about it, but my attention kept drafting. 

Does that make me a shitty boyfriend? 

After a while we grazed by the pool and watched a tired Lucile drift in peace.

 Laura sat next to me and rested her head on my shoulders. Lucile had her back to us-she was beginning her own ritual of sounding like a foghorn and staring at the trees. Laura took notice of that and stood up. I joined her and we walked back inside-though I wasn't sure what the rush was. When I brought it up, she looked at me like I was an idiot.

""We spent the whole day with Lucile, feeding her, getting her used to our presences. Why do you think we did that?"" She asked. I shrugged in response.¬†""God you're dense."" She said-playfully but I could feel the frustration. 

""You're right, of course. You're always right."" I admitted. ""That's not a dig-I never meant it as one I just- I should listen to you more."" I added quickly. Laura leaned into me and kissed me deeply, her lips soft to the touch with the lingering taste of berry Chapstick.¬†

""You should."" She simply said. 

The rest of the night was the best sleep I had all week. I woke to find a softly snoring Laura still clinging to my side. It was nice actually-before all this I was sleeping on the couch in my own home. We always seemed to find something to bicker about-I suspect she wanted the queen memory foam to herself. Rays of humidity peeked in through drawn blinds. 

I wiggled out of Laura's grasp and opened them-blinding myself with the new Dawn. The sun was high in the baby blue sky that day-had to be at least Ten AM. In bed Laura groaned and rolled herself a cocoon. I chuckled and quietly left the room. I heard a knock from downstairs and opened the door to find Lucas.

 He forced a smile when he saw me-beads of sweat clinging to his brow like rock climbers on a summit.¬†

""Hey Sam-another uh, another hot one today huh?"" He tried to chitchat.¬†

""Uh-y-yeah, probably another scorcher. Good day to just stay inside and let the AC do its thing."" I responded, throwing him a life preserver. This was odd-to say the least. It had been a year living here, and this was the first conversation I'd had with Lucas that didn't open with ""You left your trash in the middle of the curb again."" He cleared his throat and looked past me, struggling to get to the point of his announced visit.

""Well, listen-about the other day, eh what ya did for Rick and his own-"" he started.

""Oh- oh no that, come on it was nothing. I just happened to be there. Anyone else would have done the same, stupid thing."" I interrupted. He wagged his burly claws at me, scoffing at my modesty.

""Nah it ain't nothing. It's certainly not something I thought you'd ever do. The wife was thinking-and-and me as well, we were wondering if you wanted to come over for a late lunch or something. Give ya a long overdue ""welcome to the neighborhood."" He rubbed the back of his neck like it owed him money.¬†

""Oh-uh sure, sure that sounds nice. I'll swing by in a couple hours, shoot for 3pm?"" I suggested.

""Sure, sure sounds good. Bring your uh, lady friend there-"" He moved anxiously and waved his hand at the jeep neatly tucked in the drive. ""Tess would love to meet her.""¬†

""Yeah, sure that-that all sounds lovely."" I said. We both nodded in agreement and let our words mingle in the air as the birds squawked among our silence. It was eternal torture-and in that instant I regretted agreeing to the lunch. 

Finally, I cough and said, ""Well I better go tell her, she's still sound asleep."" trying to escape back into the comfort of my home. We did an awkward goodbye as I shut the door and watched him hurry back over across the street. 

Anyway, the time came, and we walked across the street. The sky was already starting to bleed orange as the mid-day sun hung low. The walk felt like a three weeklong hike as I dragged my feels against the asphalt. 

The house across the way was painted plum purple-but the grand porch was a stark white-clean room white. We knocked on the oak door-it boomed through the veins of the home. We were met with a muffled voice, and a few moments later the door opened. 

Standing in the doorway was a bubbly blonde woman with porcelain skin. She wore a tight blue shirt with matching pants. Her face twinkled in the waning day, a square shape with a long nose. She twitched it at us and batted her painted lashes as she stood in the door. From inside the sounds of a boiling oven and the scent of Italy wafted towards us.¬†

""Da?"" The woman spoke with a thick accent, like she was shipped straight from Siberia.

""We're here for dinner."" Laura piped up next to next to me. From the bowels of the house a shrill but pleasant voice called out.¬†

""In the kitchen! Yelena let them in-please and thank you."" Tessa sang from inside. Yelena mumbled something in Russian under her breath then put on the fakest smile I had ever seen as she stepped aside. The inside of their home smelled like an oregano scented organ grinder. 

The walls were pearly pink with flowery trim at the top. On the wall were these beautiful landscape paintings of Tuscany. The front hall was narrow and led straight into the dining room. To our left was this staircase that smelt like mildew and fresh paint. 

From above we heard a fussing baby as Yelena ditched us and bolted upstairs. Around the corner in a den straight out of my parent's home videos Lucas sat in a bulky brown cigar reeking chair. He was watching golf and straightening out his toupee when he caught us staring. His eyes bugged and he broke out a huge grin.

¬†""Hey you guys made it. Here-"" He patted a seat next to him. ""Sam why don't you take a seat-Tess is just finishing up in the kitchen and could use some help."" He hinted at Laura past me. She knocked me on the shoulders and pushed me into hell as she followed the aroma of ziti. 

As I sunk into the Leather couch- I could literally feel dragging me down-I heard Tess squeal as she embraced Laura and loudly brayed about how good it was to finally meet her. Laura matched that energy almost perfectly, and the two of them soon became like long lost sisters. 

Meanwhile Lucas was pretending to watch golf while gripping a frosty brew so hard I thought it would shatter in his hands. Time seemed to freeze in that den-as the mid-tier television flicked its grain at us. At times one of us would mutter an off-hand comment about the game like ""Boy Roy is really off his game."" or ""Awe he nicked the grass."" and the other would mutter in agreement.

 He offered me a beer at one point, and I practically chugged it down. It was a frothy swill with cheap labeling, but god help me it tasted like the fruit of the gods. From down the hall they chatted away, one of them yelled five minutes and I think we both sighed with relief.

The dining room was a classy set up. There was a furnished round table with a beautifully frilly table clothing clinging to it. In the center was a feast that would make Erysicthon blush. A beautiful lasagna cooked to perfection-so thick you could eat it like a seven-layer cake. 

There was salad, freshly tossed and mixed in with garden grown tomatoes and basil. Homemade garlic bread-which smelled divine. It was thin crust bread-so when you bit into it you really savored that garlicy crunch that came with it. Laura sat next to me with a cut slab of pasta brick on her diner plate. 

On the other side were Lucas and Tess-saddled up next to each other with their plates stacked high. Tess was as thin- metabolism was funny like that I suppose. In her bedazzled claws was a wine glass filled to the brim. Wasn't surprising, dead center in the table were two uncorked wine bottles. They looked like big clubs.

 In between the two couples was their babbling boy Lou. He was sat in a highchair with a pile of orange mush in front of him. He wore a little navy-blue cap on his head. Laura had been fawning over the kid since we got there-he was all smiles and smelt like fresh powder.

 The beginning of dinner was a quiet affair-when we had first sat down it was a parade of ""oh this looks good"" ""My compliments to the chef."" But it soon settled on polite chews and the clanging of silverware. 

Laura kicked me under the table-her subtle way of trying to get me to socialize. I looked up panic, it felt like all eyes were on me to get it going.¬†

""This-this is nice place you folks have here."" I stuttered like an idiot. Our hosts nodded in polite agreement.

""It was Luc's parent's house originally. He inherited it when they passed."" Tess confirmed. He nodded, a hint of a faint memory drawn on his face.¬†

""It really is a beautiful place; you guys must love coming up here."" Laura chimed in.¬†

""Eh if you get past the pests sure."" Lucas chuckled. ""You enjoying the neighborhood yourself, been bout a year since you guys moved in eh?"" Laura was taken back by the question, and all the color draining from my face betrayed me as well.

""Oh it's a-lovely neighborhood, but no I-don't live here. Just visiting."" She dragged that ""I"" out something fierce. Tess raised her eyebrows but said nothing. Lucas got this confuzzled look on him.""

Hold on now, ya been dating how long?""

""Uh coming up on three years now."" I replied.

""Three and a half."" Laura corrected. I quickly raised my own glass for a swig.

""And ya still ain't hitched?"" Lucas was flabbergasted as I nearly choked on my wine. He scoffed as I heaved up grapes and collected myself. ""Well, I guess I was right about you the first time-you are a moron."" He brayed as silence was thrown over the table like a wet towel. The world slowed to a snail's pace-Laura gave me a side eye, clearly worried about how I'd react to that. I took a big gulp of courage and just smiled.¬†

""Yeah, no 100% a moron, got me pegged."" It was slow but the table broke down into laughter. Under the table Laura put a reassuring hand on my knee, a thanks for being a good sport. From there the damn burst and hearty conversation flowed, it was like dinning with old friends. 

Tess and Lucas both loved to talk I learned. Lucas hailed from Jersey-big shocker there-and the pair were college sweethearts. He regaled us all with stories from his youth; how he and his summer buddies would dare each other to walk into the swamplands to find a feather or an eggshell. 

He said that little rite of passage was still going strong today, the other day he passed a group of local riffraff egging each other on. Tess said she was uneasy around the dinosaurs at first.¬†""I mean they're these big, ugly reptiles you know?"" She commented.

 She told how Lucas had brought her up here the first summer they got engaged. She woke up one morning to find a curious duck billed thing poking it's head in from the bedroom window. Her first instinct was to shriek and beat the creature with her pillow, but she gazed into its hazel peepers, and her heart melted. 

It was tall and bulky she had said- kept its four fingered hands close to its chest. The nostrils were huge, like you could stick your whole fist in them. It was sniffing the air around her and making this groaning noise that sounded like a sick deer. On its head was a singular fin, it's hide hearty and green like a budding lime.¬†

""I should have been scared, but it looked so-kind. I could tell; it was a gentle soul."" She urged. Lucas made a sound at that, and she slapped him on the arm. After a few moments she reached her hand out, and jolly green gave a quick sniff and made a grimace. He soon left after that.

""-must not have liked my perfume or something because he just turned his nose and left."" She sounded offended, even a decade later. Lucas took a big bite next to her, a weary but loving look on him.¬†

""She loves that story-like she's the frigging dinosaur whisperer."" he cracked. Lou the baby cried out next to me as Laura and I nodded our heads to their banter. The kid stretched his arms out, hands clasping shut and blinking non-stop. Tess cooed at her son and scooped him up as he babbled something to the effect of ""mama.""¬†

""Someone's cranky."" She sang. ""And don't be mean-you love when I tell it.""¬†

""Well, it's nice. Not like what happened later that week."" Lucas made a big show at shivering, like he was horrified at the thought. Tess furrowed her brow.

""What happened-oh my god, that was the same week wasn't? Oh god how could I forget."" She grimaced. Laura looked confused but something clicked for me, so I beat her to the punch.

""Wayne mentioned something offhand, hadn't had a bite around here in ten years."" I gave a gaudy impression of the wheezing man that was met with applause.

¬†""Heh-don't mention his lard a-uh butt around here right now. Tess is still mighty ticked."" Lucas warned.

""Oh, the audacity on that man-that letter he wrote.""

""Sam showed me that, and then he has that cop stake him out to-what shake him down."" Laura said, all appalled. Tess was quiet for a moment; she gave her husband a knowing glance.¬†

""Well, it all goes back to what happened. See ten years ago there was-eh cover Lou's ears hun-this major asshole who moved in a few blocks down."" Lucas began as Tess sighed and singled Yelena to rescue their son's innocent ears. ""And look I know I gave you a ration of shit for the rock all night and the garbage cans or whatever. But this guy was a major douche, major league to your minor."" He rambled.

""I get the point."" I said. Yelena was scooping Lou up and hurrying out of the room. I didn't see the point to be honest, you can swear in front of a one-year-old who's that hurting? Lucas went on with his tale.

""-he'd get into brawls at the tavern, come home with his tale between his legs and then get into screaming matches with his girlfriend. Big embarrassment for that poor girl-I tell you. There was one thing he treasured though. He had this garden in his backyard-loved to show it off to all the neighbors. Big boastful guy-said he grew the biggest flowers, the biggest carrots-"" Lucas rolled his eyes.

 ""Anyway, he was real proud. Didn't abide by any pests to linger back there-rabbits or, ya know something bigger than one. "" He hinted.¬†""One day-one of those big, elephant looking ones with a neck like a frigging palm tree-eh what are they called, what they eat?"" He asked the table.

""Herbivores."" Laura replied. Lucas snapped his fingers and winked at her, flashing her a big grin.

""Yeah them. It wanders out from the brush, rare beauty this thing they never come this far out. Probably starving the poor guy, it was a dry summer that year. It goes into his yard and starts eating his cabbage or whatever and ya know what this jackass does?"" He let the question linger in the air like week old bait.¬† Then he slammed his hand down on the table in a quick swat.

""-He shot 'em POW-just like that right in the neck. He knew where his girlfriend kept her service weapon locked up, ya see."" He casually dropped.¬†""Poor thing starts bellowing, you can hear it all over town like a-mournful beached whale. Bastard doesn't have the decency to just finish it off so he calls the cops to come take care it off. Wayne was livid-was yelling at the deputies to haul his ass away in chains. That was the plan of course-but uh. . ."" he trailed off, hesitation creeping into his boastful attitude.

¬†""-They got to him first."" Tess finished for him in a haunting whisper.¬†

""Take it all with a grain of salt of course-it's all gossip."" Lucas said as he leaned in to spill the tea. ""But-well think about it, big animal dying in the wind, making that much noise. Attracts stuff. You could hear in the air-these shrieks and screams, followed by a couple more rounds shoot off. Then there was nothing, even the big one stopped making noise.""

""When the cops finally arrived-they found the big one all torn into. Big gashes in a line-guts sprawled all over that garden he loved so much."" There was a smug aura to his tone while Lucas spoke. 

""They found what was left of the asshole leaned up against the backdoor. There were shell casings and an empty next to him, along with blood and feathers. Something had sliced him up good-"" He stood up, his chair squeaking against the floor. He grabbed a fork to illustrate his point. ""-one long nail-sliced from neck-"" he slowly slid the fork down his jugular and past his chest ""-to his gut. He was hollow when they found him-a trail of meat leading right back into the marshlands."" 

He finished his story and slowly sat back down. A pain in my thigh grew as Laura dug her nails into it. I took her hand as our masterful host took a faux bow as he sat back down. Tess was cheering him own, sarcasm dripping with her jeers.

""Well, you've succeeded in scaring the hell out of us, so thank you for that."" I remarked.¬†¬†

""Oh, think nothing of it. I shouldn't bring up that asshole's death like that anyway-it ain't fair to Sydney."" He replied. ""She's a good kid, cried for weeks over that prick."" he shook his head.

""Drinks a bit too much."" Tess mumbled as he shot her a look.

""Hey stifle that, like you wouldn't?"" She was silent at that as Lucas turned his attention back to us. ""They found bloody footprints inside the house-after they gutted him, they took a little stroll, can you believe that? Marcus wasn't well liked so nothing major came of it but Wayne brought in all these rules-no feeding and lock your doors chief among them. No one is as big of a hound bout those rules more than her."" He said. 

He let that knowledge dance in the air a bit more, and I was floored honestly.¬†

""If they're so dangerous why doesn't someone step in and-you know. . ."" I trailed off. Lucas took another swig and had an answer for that rearing to go.¬†

""Well in my dad's day they used to. Once a season-get a group together and cull the population-like deer with some bite heh. Got one of his old hunting trophies laying around in the garage I'll show ya sometime.""

""Why'd they stop?"" Tess waved her hand at Laura's question.

""People got in a huff, saying it was poaching and immoral and all that. Which for the nice ones sure-but the raptors?"" and that ended that conversation. I'm positive there was more too it then that, but either they didn't know or didn't think it mattered. 

In any case it seemed like the raptors would be here to stay in Eustace. After Marcus' death they were seen as dangerous vermin, but they never seemed to attack. They would go up to houses and try to break in, but that was chalked up as pure curiosity more than anything. 

There were the rumors Sydney had spoken of-missing pets and vagrants vanishing into the wetlands. But of course, they were just rumors, probably cooked up by the township to dissuade people from going in there and bugging the dinos. 

Besides if they were really a threat, the government would have done something by now right? It sounded like they were trying to convince themselves that nothing was wrong, and I wanted to believe them. 

Never mind how much Wayne's dismissive attitude towards Rick's attack bothered them. 

Never mind how they kept even their second story windows locked up tight-despite how nice the midnight breeze would feel. 

Never mind even Lucas admitted the flock had never been this aggressive, and he had overheard of another possible attack across town. 

No, everything was fine-they'd tell us if it wasn't. 

The night winded down and the mountain of pasta crumbled as our bellies filled. Lou was making a fuss, and the exhausted looking maid brought him back in, softly bouncing him in his arms. Laura shot up and instantly offered to take him-cradling him in her arms like a natural. 

He calmed as she rocked him, and Tess gave her a tired look. The ladies left to go put away dishes as Lucas dragged me outside for cigars. The guy had real Cubans-as thick as a sausage and had that pure smoke smell to them. 

He led me out-pitch black out save for the dim porch light that flickered when he slid the door. He whipped out a lighter and made a few puffs-the orange ember glowing like an old jack-o-lantern. I lit mine up and nearly hacked up a lung but damn if that Earthy ""twang"" wasn't worth it. 

The pair of us listened to the crickets battle it out with the cicadas for most annoying sound as behind us-our SOs were laughing it up as dishes clattered. I turned back slightly and saw Laura with a huge smile, cradling that kid like he was her own. 

He looked conked out-his dopey hat covering his eyes. It was nice seeing her so happy after the weeks of tension we had. It made me realize that Lucas wasn't far off calling me an idiot.¬†

""Listen I'm sorry for busting your balls earlier-"" Lucas began after a long puff. A haze of smoke twirled around his face as he spoke.

""Oh, not at all-probably deserved honestly."" I protested but he held up a hand.

""Well not just that- I've been giving you a hard time all year and that wasn't fair-ya know it goes both ways."" he smiled.

""I appreciate that. I'm sorry if I came off-""¬†

""Water under the bridge."" he raised his cigar and butted it against mine. Ash fell to our feet like slow rain. ""To new beginnings huh?"" I agreed and he slapped me on the back; it felt good despite the throbbing sting.

 We stood out there as we finished our smokes, a few feet away from the porch. We stood in the edge of the light-the wild dark grasping at our toes. Despite the grating heat it was beautiful out-the lumbering trees and the loan calls of the marsh greeted us like old friends. I was going to say as much to Lucas, but I noticed he was squinting at something in the dark-hyper focusing on what lay past the shadows.¬†

""What-"" I whispered but was met with a harsh *shhhh*. He pointed towards the tree line. I noticed then how dead silent it had become-like we had been placed in a vacuum. The only sound was the slight breaking of twigs as shapes came into focus.

 There were five of them, leering bipedal monsters that stood at about five feet-maybe six. I could make out the outline of faux wings and dazzling crests-their eyes a hollow beacon in the fog of the night. All but one had twin bulbs that looked like luminesce orbs. The pack approached us-and began to take shape in the absence of light. They made chittering sounds to each other, sharp barks like commands. 

The one-eyed raptor stood tall among his flock. His gaze was fixed solely on me-and I swear I could feel hatred coming off that thing in waves. They stalked closer, breaking off from a tight knit formation and easing into a deadly sei-circle. Panic began to set in-we were only a few feet away from safety, but I doubt that we could outrun them if it came to it.

 I took a small step back-Lucas following my lead. The standoff lasted an eternity, the pack encircling us with greedy precision. If Lucas was scared, he hid it well-his chest steady and his short knees sturdy. His gaze darted back and forth like ping pong balls as he looked at the pack. 

One-Eye leaned forward-and I could see fresh scars scabbed over its swollen bulb. It pursed its lips-an oddly human snarl forming and I could see those fishhook teeth jutting forward-hungry for the taste of man. Lucas grabbed my arm-a sign that it was time to book it.

 I don't know if it helped but we tossed what was left of our cigars at the snickering pack and turned tail. One Eye snapped at the others and they engaged-heads down as they sprinted gracefully towards us. In seconds they were on us-the gap almost non-existent. If we weren't right next to the sliding glass, I have no doubt you'd be reading my obituary instead.

 One of the left raptors pounced-its claws stretched out for the kill-and slammed its body into the sliding door as we slammed it. The door vibrated and a fracked formed where it hit. The raptor scrambled to its feet and hissed at us as it scurried back and forth. I brushed past a panting Lucas and the *click* of the lock rang out as the pack approached the back door. 

They cocked their head-not even acknowledging us but were dead focused on the locks. They pawed at the handle-and my blood froze as it moved ever so slightly. Lucas couldn't take his eyes off that crack-a long-jagged line that separated us from certain death. 

One-Eye chirped, and the pack slowly backed off and melted back into the dark. The only trace of them was their glowing pearls-fog lights that slowly faded into the brush.Lucas snapped back into reality as he rushed to draw the curtains. Before we could process what had happen a shrill voice called from behind and we jumped out of our skins.""

What's a matter with you boys."" Tess spat. She sounded annoyed till she saw the ghastly looks on us. Laura peaked out from behind her, calming Lou in her arms as he fussed. I opened my mouth to speak but no words could escape. Lucas but in with the save thankfully.

""Ah just-too much wine, heard a croc roaming ya know. Hey gang-it's getting late here, uh too dark out, why don't you kids crash on the couch."" Lucas suggested. I nodded along like a dope as Tess began to protest. 

Laura handed off Lou to Tess, and our hosts disappeared to bicker as we settled down on the couch. We let the tv bask us in faded silver as we struggled to pass out. Laura had asked me point blank-why are we still here when it's a minute long walk across the way. I couldn't lie to her and judging by the panicked whispers we heard floating downstairs-neither could Lucas. 

Neither of us ended up sleeping, we just held each other close until daybreak. Our restless hosts walked us out and we promised to do this again sometime. Laura is in the shower now-I think she's still shaken up. 

As for me? I'm remembering what Sydney said. 

These things are smarter than they look-and they can clearly hold a grudge.

 Did you know crows can actually remember any instance of wrongdoing towards them. They can pick out the offender out of a group of people-years later even. Then swope in and peck them to death. 

The heat is getting worse-and the pack knows my face. I think I'll look into getting a gun after all- I'll update when I can. 

Hopefully Lucile will keep them at bay till this whole thing blows over.¬†",1,1753384423.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

1m8df05,https://www.reddit.com/r/CountertopConfessions/comments/1m8df05/how_does_the_nespresso_gran_lattissima_truly/,How Does the Nespresso Gran Lattissima Truly Enhance Your Coffee Experience?,"I recently had the pleasure of testing out the Nespresso EN640W, and if there's one thing I love, it's indulging in a good cup of coffee at home. With the promise of caf√©-style drinks at the touch of a button, this espresso machine immediately piqued my interest. From its sleek design to its ease of use, there's a lot to appreciate, but a few quirks caught my attention too. Let me take you through my experience.  

**User-Friendly Design**  
The first thing I noticed was the machine‚Äôs compact yet stylish appearance. Its modern design combines matte and high-gloss finishes with stainless steel accents, along with a glass touch panel that feels premium. It fits snugly on my kitchen counter without taking up too much space, which is saying a lot because my counter is already crowded with gadgets. The sliding drip tray is a clever addition, accommodating everything from small espresso cups to my oversized latte glasses. I also appreciated that the removable milk container can be stored in the fridge, simplifying the morning rush. Overall, its aesthetic and functional design work well in tandem.  

**One-Touch Recipes**  
One of the machine's standout features is its nine one-touch beverage options. As someone who adores switching between an espresso and a latte macchiato based on my mood, this functionality won me over quickly. The machine covers a variety of drinks, including cappuccino, flat white, and even options for hot or foamed milk. I was skeptical about how ""barista-quality"" the results would be, but the drinks impressed me. The milk froth came out creamy and rich, and the espresso had a layer of crema that rivals a caf√©'s.  

[Check Nespresso EN640W price on Amazon.](https://cookwareoutlet.com/p/b0cmz874n2/)  

**Performance and Efficiency**  
Nobody likes waiting too long for their caffeine, and the Nespresso EN640W keeps that in mind with its impressive 25-second heat-up time. I usually hit the button before pulling out a mug, and by the time I return, the machine is ready to go. The 19-bar high-performance pump ensures a robust extraction process, delivering consistent flavors shot after shot. The energy-saving feature, which automatically shuts the machine off after nine minutes of inactivity, is a bonus for both the environment and forgetful people like me.  

**Maintenance and Cleaning**  
With such impressive automation, you‚Äôd think maintenance would be a hassle; surprisingly, it‚Äôs not. The removable parts are dishwasher safe, which is perfect for lazy cleanup days. The intuitive descaling system, which you can program to your water hardness level, is another thoughtful touch. On the downside, the milk frothing system does require a few extra steps for cleaning to avoid blockages. If you‚Äôre diligent about maintaining it, though, it doesn‚Äôt take much effort, but I can see this being a minor inconvenience for some users.  

**Positives**  
- Intuitive one-touch system for nine beverage options.  
- Premium modern design suitable for any kitchen.  
- 19-bar pump makes coffee extraction rich and aromatic.  
- Compact design with flexible drip tray for various cup sizes.  

**Drawbacks**  
- Milk frothing system needs more frequent cleaning to avoid clogging.  
- Higher initial cost compared to some single-serve machines.  
- Capsule-only system limits brew versatility beyond Nespresso options.  

**Competing Products**  
This machine inevitably invites comparisons with others on the market. One immediate rival that comes to mind is the Breville Bambino Plus. Where the Nespresso excels in automation and convenience, the Bambino Plus offers customization for more refined coffee-making. On the other hand, Nespresso's integrated milk frothing system trumped Breville's separate, albeit excellent, frothing wand when it came to making a quick latte without much manual effort. Keurig‚Äôs high-end models feature versatile capsule compatibility, which is something Nespresso lacks. However, I‚Äôd argue that Nespresso‚Äôs rich crema and overall build quality offer a more premium experience than Keurig‚Äôs alternatives.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
There‚Äôs no skating around the fact that this is a high-end espresso machine‚Äîits price reflects that. But when I weigh the cost against the quality of beverages and the convenience of one-touch operation, it feels like money well spent, especially for a busy household or anyone who loves their coffee rituals. Cheaper coffee makers may exist, but they tend to lack the flavor or finesse that this offers. If you can swing the cost, it‚Äôs definitely worth the investment.

I've never had an intolerance to food or dairy ever in my life. For the past 6 months or so, I've had diarrhea every day. The only thing that fixed it was the keto diet (tried for 9 weeks), but that didn't make me feel good in other ways so I stopped. I eat healthy, with lots of fiber and a well balanced diet filled with veggies and fruits, and eat from all four food groups, and eat low to moderate white carbs (limited bread and pasta, moderate rice and potatoes). Recently, I thought lactose intolerance may have been the cause but didn't test out the theory. However, I went home to Ontario for 2 weeks, and with no changes in my diet (including continuing to eat/drink dairy, and probably ate worse due to being on vacation), I had no diarrhea at all. My stools returned to normal. The morning after returning to Alberta, after having my first coffee with cream and breakfast of the day, it was back to diarrhea. What the heck??

Her father, surprised, asked about the sudden change, reminding her how she'd always insisted on staying with Brendan. Jayde forced a laugh, revealing the painful truth: Brendan was getting married, and she, his stepsister, could no longer cling to him.
That night, she tried to tell Brendan about her college acceptance, but his fianc√©e, Chloie Ellis, interrupted with a bubbly call, and Brendan's tender words to Chloie twisted a knife in Jayde's heart. She remembered how his tenderness used to be hers alone, how he had protected her, and how she had poured out her heart to him in a diary and a love letter, only for him to explode, tearing the letter and yelling, ""I'm your brother!""
He had stormed out, leaving her to painstakingly tape the shredded pieces back together. Her love, however, didn't die, not even when he brought Chloie home and told her to call her ""sister-in-law.""
Now, she understood. She had to put that fire out herself. She had to dig Brendan out of her heart.

Chapter 1
Eighteen days after she decided to give up on Brendan Maynard, Jayde Rosario cut off her waist-length hair. She stood in front of the mirror and smoked her first cigarette, the sm**e curling around her fingers. The taste was bitter.

That night, she called her father across the country.

""Dad, I got into UC Berkeley.""

Her voice was quiet.

""I want to move to California. I want to be with you again.""

Her father, Farrell Conner, sounded surprised on the other end of the line. ""After your mom and I divorced, I settled down here. I always asked you to come over as an exchange student, but you insisted on staying with your step-brother, Brendan. Why the sudden change?""

Jayde lowered her eyes, which were red and swollen. She forced a small, light laugh.

""Some paths you have to walk to the end to know they're dead ends.""

She paused, her voice shaking slightly.

""Brendan is getting married. It's not right for me, his sister with no bl**d relation, to cling to him anymore.""

Her father sighed, his voice full of sympathy. ""It's good you've figured it out. Your mom and Mr. Maynard have been traveling the world, leaving you with Brendan all these years. You're grown up now. It's time to come live with me. You can study and learn to manage the company.""

""Okay,"" Jayde said, then hung up.

She saw her swollen eyes in the reflection of the dark phone screen. She went to the bathroom and splashed cold water on her face. She had two weeks until she left for Berkeley. She had to pull herself together.

She walked down the hallway and noticed the light was on in the study. She hesitated for a moment, then pulled up her e-acceptance letter on her phone and knocked on the door.

""Knock, knock, knock.""

Inside, Brendan Maynard sat at his desk. He wore dark blue silk loungewear, and his high nose supported a pair of gold-rimmed glasses. He looked elegant, aloof, and disciplined as he typed on his computer.

""Brendan,"" Jayde said softly. This was the man who was her step-brother. He was also the secret, hidden crush of her entire teenage life.

Brendan looked up from his screen, his brow furrowed in a slight frown. ""Something wrong?""

Jayde pursed her lips, hesitating. ""The college admission results are out...""

Before she could finish, a cute, bubbly ringtone cut through the quiet room. ""Darling, answer the phone~""

Brendan's frown vanished instantly. He picked up his phone, and a gentle smile spread across his face as he listened to the person on the other end.

""Chloie, you can work directly with the wedding planner. Just tell them to arrange whatever designs you want. Remember, money is no object.""

A sharp bitterness filled Jayde's ch**t. Brendan's tenderness used to belong only to her.

When she was eight, her remarried mother brought her to the Maynard household. She stood awkwardly in the grand mansion, lost and alone. Young Brendan, dressed in his British-style school uniform, had walked over and taken her hand. ""Little girl, I'm your brother now,"" he'd said.

When she was ten, she was afraid of the dark. Brendan secretly used his allowance to buy her a Totoro nightlight. ""Don't be scared,"" he'd told her. ""I'll protect you, just like Totoro protects Mei.""

During her teenage years, Brendan was the sun in her world. She didn't know how to tell him about the love she kept hidden, so she wrote it all down in a diary, over and over again.

Then, on her seventeenth birthday, just before Brendan graduated from college, she gave him everything. She gave him the diary filled with her feelings and a love letter where she poured out her heart.

That day, Brendan exploded. He flipped the gift box over, sending its contents scattering across the floor.

""Jayde Rosario, are you sick? I'm your brother!"" he had yelled.

But she had been stubborn. ""We're not related by bl**d. You're not my real brother. You've pampered me and protected me and cared for me all these years. Isn't it natural for me to fall in love with you?""

Her stubbornness was met with cruelty. He mercilessly tore the love letter into pieces.

""I knew you'd do something foolish. I shouldn't have bothered with you all these years! You can't even tell the difference between family affection and romantic love!""

He stormed out of the house that day without a second glance. Jayde cried as she picked up the shredded pieces from the floor. She took them to her room and painstakingly taped them back together. But the letter was scarred, a patchwork of its former self.

Her failed confession didn't k**l her love for him. She studied harder, determined to get into the same university he attended, to stay in the same city.

But on the day she finished high school, Brendan brought a woman named Chloie Ellis home.

""Jayde, call her 'sister-in-law',"" he'd said.

That night, Jayde cried until she couldn't breathe. She finally understood that the ninety-nine steps she had taken through thorns to reach him meant nothing. She and Brendan would only ever be siblings. There was no other possibility.

The intense love that had burned in her heart for years now felt like a fire that was burning her alive.

Now, she understood. She had to put that fire out herself. She had to dig Brendan out of her heart.

Chapter 2
Watching Brendan still on the phone with Chloie Ellis, his voice soft and loving, Jayde Rosario swallowed the words she had come to say. She turned and quietly left the study.

To him, she was just a stepsister living in his house. He wouldn't care where she went to college. If that was the case, she didn't need to tell him.

In fifteen days, she would leave the Maynard home. She would leave Brendan.

Back in her room, Jayde looked at the warm glow of the Totoro nightlight on her bedside table. A flicker of sadness crossed her face. The chubby Totoro holding a green leaf umbrella over a little girl looked just like how Brendan used to shield her. But the past was the past.

She sighed softly and switched off the nightlight. The room went dark.

""Since I've decided to go, it's time to pack,"" she murmured to herself.

She pulled an old duffel bag from the top of her closet and opened the large, wall-to-wall display cabinet. Inside the glass-fronted shelves were all the memories. The good luck charms Brendan had brought her from the temple. The Coral Sea perfume he had specially blended for her on a trip to France.

One by one, she took them all out and placed them in the duffel bag. The bag slowly filled up, but her heart felt like it was emptying, a hollow space where a cold wind was blowing.

She pushed down the sadness and opened the bottom drawer of the cabinet. A yellowed diary lay inside. The pages were filled with childish pencil scribbles from her turbulent childhood.

The new teacher is nice, but the kids say I'm a jinx. They say I have one dad and one mom, and nobody wants me.

She remembered how Brendan had found her diary back then. He had read that page and gently st**ked her head. ""Silly girl, you're not a jinx,"" he'd said. ""You're a star in my eyes. You sparkle brighter than anyone.""

After that day, no one at school ever called her names again. She later found out that Brendan had gone to the school and quietly warned those children. He had protected her childhood in his own quiet way.

As she flipped through the diary, the pencil handwriting became neater. Every single page was about Brendan.

She turned page after page, her eyes blurring with tears. The last page held a note from him from when she was choosing her subjects in high school.

Kid, whether you choose arts or sciences, remember to go to college here in the city. After you graduate, you can work at Maynard Group. I protected you when you were little. I'll keep looking out for you when you grow up.

A tear fell silently onto the diary, blurring the ink.

Jayde pulled herself together, pushing down the complicated knot of feelings in her ch**t. Then, she started tearing the pages out of the diary. She tore up the letters, too. With each rip of the paper, a memory of her and Brendan seemed to fade.

She threw all the shredded pieces into the duffel bag and zipped it shut.

A while later, she heard a commotion downstairs. She walked out of her room and saw Chloie Ellis in the living room, hugging Brendan. A suitcase stood beside her.

Jayde's heart stuttered, and she froze on the landing.

Seeing her, Chloie smiled and waved. ""Jayde! I'm moving in for a few days. I brought you a gift!""

Chloie opened an ornate box she was holding. ""See if you like it.""

Inside was a pink wristwatch with a metal strap. It was cute, with a bit of a British style.

Jayde frowned. She didn't reach for it. She had been allergic to metal since she was a child. When she was nine, a nanny had given her a metal spoon to eat with. She'd only gotten a small rash, but Brendan had fired the nanny on the spot. He had every metal item that might touch her skin replaced. He didn't allow any of her allergens near her.

As she was lost in thought, Brendan's voice cut through the air. ""Hurry up and take it. Don't disappoint your sister-in-law.""

His words hit her hard. She stared at his matter-of-fact expression, a wave of sadness washing over her. He hadn't just taken back all his favoritism. He had forgotten her completely.

Jayde took a deep breath. She took the box and put the watch on her wrist.

""Thank you, sister-in-law. And... thank you, Brendan.""

Thank you for making my decision to leave even easier.

Chapter 3
That night, Chloie Ellis sl**t in Brendan Maynard's room.

Jayde knew they were a couple. She knew it was normal for them to stay together. But the quiet, ambiguous sounds that floated through the house in the dead of night kept her awake.

She lit another cigarette, watching the sm**e curl around her slender fingers before taking a deep drag. It tasted bitter and acrid, just like her feelings.

The next morning, Jayde came downstairs with swollen eyes.

""Jayde!"" Chloie called out, pulling her to sit on the sofa. A faint red mark was visible on Chloie's neck. ""Your brother's birthday is coming up. I want to throw him a party. Do you know what style he likes?""

Chloie's question pulled Jayde back to the present. She couldn't help but remember a conversation she and Brendan had once had while walking on the beach.

She had told him she loved the sparkling ocean, the sound of the waves, and holding his hand as they walked on the sand while the sun rose. That day, Brendan had held her hand and walked with her for a long, long time.

""Kid, you like the beach,"" he'd said. ""So from now on, our birthday parties will be by the sea. What you like is what I like.""

Back then, his world revolved around her. Now, he avoided her. He had forgotten everything she liked.

A bitter feeling spread through her ch**t. It took her a moment to find her voice. ""I...""

She was about to speak when Brendan walked over and interrupted her. ""My affairs, you should ask me.""

Chloie clung to his arm, whining. ""I just thought, since you're a girl, you'd know him better. It seems like even his sister doesn't really know him.""

Jayde forced a smile. ""Yes. I really don't.""

""You two talk. I have to go,"" she said, suppressing the bitterness. She turned to leave, but Brendan's eyes darkened.

""It's early in the morning. What could you possibly have to do?""

His cold voice made her heart stop for a second. Did he still care what she did?

Jayde answered truthfully. ""I have an appointment to get my visa today.""

As soon as she said it, Chloie looked surprised. ""Going on a trip? With friends? Or a boyfriend?""

Brendan frowned at Jayde, his tone full of accusation. ""Jayde Rosario, you just finished high school. Don't get involved with the wrong kind of people before you even start college.""

The cold reprimand felt like a physical blow. It left her with no strength to explain.

In the silence, Chloie smoothed things over. ""It's normal for a young girl to date. Brendan, don't be so harsh.""

Then she turned to Jayde, her voice soft and comforting. ""If you like someone, you should love boldly. You only get to be eighteen once. Don't listen to your brother.""

Chloie then took Brendan's hand and they left together. Watching them walk away, Jayde slowly clenched her fists.

She only had one eighteen, and she had already given it to Brendan.

Fourteen days left. Then she would leave. She wouldn't let her youth get buried in this swamp where no one noticed her.

Jayde left the house. It was foggy outside, a light drizzle falling. Even though it was summer, the rain made her shiver.

In the past, on every rainy day, Brendan would drive her himself. ""My little girl can't get wet,"" he would say. ""My arms are your shelter.""

But now, she had to get used to walking alone.

She lowered her gaze and walked out into the rain with her umbrella.

After getting her visa, she was about to call a cab when she saw a notification on her phone. A special notification, from Brendan's social media. Her finger moved on its own, clicking on it.

Brendan, who usually posted something once every six months, had a new status.

Rainy days are perfect for going public.

The photo was of him in a perfectly tailored tuxedo, embracing Chloie Ellis, who was in a mermaid-style wedding dress. He was smiling gently at the camera.

The simple sentence and the wedding photo shocked Jayde. Her eyes, already red, burned. The comment section was filled with congratulations. People were saying they were a perfect match, a pair made in heaven.

Jayde stared at the screen, feeling nothing. The usual ache in her ch**t wasn't there.

She calmly typed a comment.

May you be together forever.

Chapter 4
After posting the comment, Jayde Rosario unfollowed Brendan Maynard's social media. The days until she left were counting down. She would use this time to dig him out of her heart, piece by piece.

She returned to the hillside mansion. The house was empty, and a chill hung in the air. She went into the kitchen and cooked herself a simple bowl of egg noodles.

While she was eating, her phone buzzed. It was a message from Chloie Ellis.

Jayde, Brendan and I won't be home tonight. Take care of yourself.

A moment later, Chloie sent several more photos. A candlelit dinner. A mirror selfie in a fancy hotel suite.

Jayde's fingertips trembled slightly as she looked at the pictures. She calmly replied with one word.

""Okay.""

She closed the chat, and a notification popped up from her high school group chat. Someone had tagged her. She clicked on it and saw her classmates were planning a graduation party for the weekend.

She thought about it. Once she moved to California, she probably wouldn't come back to the country very often. She agreed to go.

Her reply instantly brought the group chat to life.

Will your doting brother Brendan Maynard come to the party?

Remember that time we were camping and there was a landslide? Your brother flew back overnight and brought a search party into the mountains to find you. He said he'd always be with you when you went out. He should come this time too, right?

The messages from her classmates filled her mind with memories of a time when she felt safe and warm. But now, those warm feelings were like shards of ice, piercing her heart with every breath.

Jayde put her phone down and replied with three words.

He's not coming.

Her classmates' idea of Brendan was stuck in the past, in the years when he spoiled her completely. They didn't know about the confession he had rejected when she was seventeen. And they didn't know that the man who had promised to protect her had found someone else to protect.

That night, Jayde sl**t restlessly. In her dream, she was eight years old again, standing awkwardly by the fountain on her first day at the Maynard home. She didn't know what to do.

In the dream, young Brendan, in his plaid school uniform, glanced at her indifferently. Then he turned and walked away with his backpack, without saying a single word.

She woke with a start, her face wet with tears that had stained her pillow.

If Brendan had been that cold to her from the very beginning, maybe she would have understood the distance between them sooner.

But there were no ""if onlys."" The hardest thing in the world wasn't never having something. It was having all the favoritism, and then losing it all overnight.

When she got up, she looked at the duffel bag in the corner of her room, full of memories. Thirteen days left. Thirteen days until she truly left this place.

Whether she wanted to or not, she had to throw these memories away. Only by getting rid of them completely could she clear the space in her heart.

Jayde took a deep breath, picked up the heavy duffel bag, and walked out of her room.

As she was about to go downstairs, she saw Brendan and Chloie Ellis had just returned.

Brendan frowned when he saw the bag in her hand. ""School hasn't started yet. Where are you going with that luggage?""

Jayde tightened her grip on the strap. ""I'll be living on campus later, so I packed some useless things to throw away.""

She struggled to carry the heavy bag down the stairs.

Brendan didn't say anything. He just strode forward, took the bag from her, and walked outside. He threw it directly into the large tr**h receptacle by the curb.

The clattering sound it made as it landed made Jayde's heart sink. If he cared even a little, he would have heard the sound of the wind chimes made from seashells from the Aegean Sea inside the bag.

What he threw away were the gifts he had flown halfway around the world to bring her over the years. They were also the memories they had once promised they would never forget.

But Brendan didn't even glance at the tr**h. His gaze was fixed straight ahead.

""You're going to college in the city. There's no need to live on campus. Stay at home after school starts. I'll talk to your teacher.""

His tone was unquestionable. It filled Jayde with a mix of emotions. If he had just asked her high school teacher, he would have known she hadn't even applied to any colleges in the city. She had applied directly to the University of California, Berkeley, thousands of miles away.

But his mind was on Chloie Ellis now. He didn't care about her future at all.

It didn't matter. Only thirteen days left. Once she was in California, she wouldn't need his attention.

Thinking this, she turned and went back upstairs without a word.

Behind her, she heard Chloie asking quietly, ""Is Jayde mad because we didn't come home last night?""

Brendan's voice was cold. ""She's eighteen now. She should learn to be independent. No one can stay with her forever.""

Jayde paused on the stairs, then continued to her room.

Yes, she was eighteen. She wouldn't miss the past. And she wouldn't hope for the future. From now on, she could walk her own path, all by herself.

Chapter 5
For the next few days, Jayde Rosario stayed in her room. She didn't leave from morning until night. Brendan Maynard took Chloie Ellis out early every day and came back late, and sometimes they didn't come home at all. Their lives no longer seemed to intersect.

Sunday arrived. Ten days before she was set to leave. It was also the day of her high school reunion.

At a bar by the sea, as soon as Jayde walked into the private room, a few of her close friends handed her a drink.

""You're eighteen now. Let's say goodbye to being kids and legally have our first drink.""

Jayde paused for a moment. People said al**hol could drown your sorrows, and she wanted to relax. This drink was a farewell to her friends, a final toast.

After one drink, she felt a little dizzy. She went out to the corridor to get some fresh air. As she passed an open private room, she unexpectedly saw Brendan. He was surrounded by a group of men and women, laughing and talking.

Her heart skipped a beat. She forced herself to look away, but the conversation from inside the room made her stop.

""Brendan, you're about to get engaged to Chloie. What about your sister, Jayde Rosario? She used to follow you everywhere.""

""She's an adult now. She's not my responsibility anymore.""

The clear, familiar voice reached her ears, and it sobered her up a little. She stood at the doorway, her eyes lowered, not moving for a long moment.

After what felt like a long time, she murmured to herself and continued walking down the corridor.

""Yes, she's an adult. She's sensible. From now on, my world won't have you in it, either.""

Jayde went to the window at the end of the corridor to get some air. Then she went to the restroom and splashed cold water on her face. When she came out, she ran right into Brendan. He seemed to have had a few drinks himself.

Their eyes met.

Jayde was about to speak, but Chloie Ellis's voice came from behind him. ""Brendan.""

She called out his name sweetly, then threw herself into his arms. ""I drank too much. I can barely walk.""

Brendan ki**ed her on the forehead, his voice doting. ""Then I'll carry you.""

With that, he scooped Chloie up into his arms in a princess carry and walked away, as if Jayde wasn't even there.

Their in**mate display left Jayde frozen in place for a long time.

""Jayde, why are you crying?"" Her friend, Brielle Steele, asked, pulling her back to reality.

Jayde froze, then forced a faint smile. ""It's just an eyelash in my eye. It's nothing.""

Brielle nodded, then pointed in the direction Brendan had gone. ""Is that your brother? He actually has a girlfriend now. We all thought he'd never date. We thought he'd always stay with you, because he used to dote on you so much.""

Hearing this, Jayde felt a slight bitterness in her heart. ""He and I both have our own lives. We won't be tied together forever.""

Brielle's face showed a hint of regret. ""Actually, we all used to think he was your boyfriend. You two looked so good together. It's just a shame he's your brother...""

Jayde's heart felt heavy and damp. She used to think it was a shame, too. But now she felt that the bonds between people were just fate. She and Brendan used to be siblings. From now on, they would have no relationship at all.

The reunion ended at one in the morning. Jayde said goodbye to her friends and walked out of the bar. She saw Brendan and Chloie standing by the revolving door, looking like they were waiting for her.

""You're an adult now, and you're still out past midnight. You're getting more and more out of control. What if something happens?""

The reprimand froze her in place.

Chloie glanced at Brendan reproachfully. ""Jayde has you to protect her now, and later she'll have her boyfriend to protect her. What could possibly happen?""

""Let's go home together,"" Chloie said, taking Brendan's hand and walking out. She motioned for Jayde to follow.

Jayde followed behind them, her eyes on the ground. Only when they stepped outside did she realize it was drizzling again.

Brendan opened his umbrella and walked forward with Chloie, not looking back. The large umbrella was tilted to the right, shielding Chloie completely from the rain, while half of his own shirt was dark with water.

Jayde watched them in a daze. She suddenly remembered how Brendan used to hold his umbrella for her. He always tilted it towards her.

""Jayde is my delicate rose,"" he used to say. ""Roses can't get wet. I'll always protect you.""

A gust of wind blew, and the slanted raindrops fell onto Jayde's white dress, bringing a chill with them.

Jayde came back to her senses and slowly walked out into the rain alone.

Roses can't get wet, but I want to be my own sunflower. Always facing the sun, always bright.

Chapter 6
When she got home, Jayde Rosario was soaked from the rain. She felt drowsy and heavy. After a hot shower, she collapsed into bed and fell asleep immediately.

For the past few days, she had been alone in the mansion. She was already getting used to it. She no longer tried to ask about Brendan Maynard's whereabouts.

""Ding.""

Her phone chimed with a message. She picked it up and saw it was from her father, Farrell Conner.

My dear daughter, your flight is scheduled to depart at 10 PM on August 25th. Remember to bring all your documents and materials for school. Dad will be waiting for you at the airport.

Jayde clicked on her phone's calendar. She murmured to herself, ""Only seven days until I leave this home.""

Her calendar for seven days from now had an entry: Brendan Maynard's Birthday.

Maybe her departure was the best birthday gift she could give him.

Over the next two days, Jayde went through her luggage again, making sure she had everything. Then she packed up all the old things she couldn't take with her and arranged for a donation pick-up service.

As the courier was making a list of the items and preparing to pack them into boxes, Brendan returned home.

""What's going on?"" he asked, his eyes on the piles of clothes and books.

Jayde filled out the donation form and motioned for the courier to take the bags first. ""I arranged for old clothes to be picked up. I'm clearing out things I don't use.""

Her voice was calm and empty of emotion. It made Brendan frown. He had felt that Jayde was different lately, but he couldn't quite figure out what had changed. A strange feeling was growing inside him, a sense of emptiness he couldn't explain.

""Chloie and I have been staying at the Blue Sea Apartments downtown,"" he said, changing the subject. ""It's quieter there and more convenient for work.""

Jayde just nodded slightly. The Blue Sea Apartments, without her there, would indeed be quieter.

She watched as Brendan started gathering some of his and Chloie's things, preparing to leave again. On impulse, she asked, ""Brendan, your birthday is next Friday. Can I attend?""

Jayde had meticulously prepared a gift for Brendan's birthday every single year. This year would have been the tenth year. Ten. A perfect number. She wanted to see it through one last time.

Brendan had shielded her for ten years. She wanted to say a proper goodbye.

""We'll see,"" Brendan said, unwilling to commit. He pushed his suitcase toward the door and left.

The heavy sound of the door closing made Jayde's heart tremble slightly. Her eyes reddened.

Back in her room, she instinctively reached for the drawer in her bedside table, wanting to look at the love letters she had written to him. But when she opened it, the drawer was empty. She had already thrown away those brief but heartfelt letters. Only a faded sketchpad lay at the bottom of the drawer.

Jayde carefully took out the old sketchpad and gently opened it. The yellowed pages each showed Brendan in a different moment.

Brendan in his plaid school uniform, holding her hand, saying, ""Kid, I'm taking you home.""

Brendan on the highest podium, holding a trophy, hanging the gold medal around her neck. He had said, ""Kid, you're my badge of honor.""

Brendan at a formal banquet, holding a w**e glass, in complete control, sending a thornless rose over to her table. He had said, ""Kid, roses need time to bloom. I'll wait for you to grow up.""

Every drawing was a memory etched deep in her mind.

But it didn't matter anymore. She would scrape those memories clean from her heart, bit by bit.

She turned to the last page of the sketchpad. It was blank. Jayde remembered that every year on Brendan's birthday, she would secretly draw a picture of the two of them together. She thought she would draw one this year, too.

But this year, the people in the drawing would be Brendan and Chloie Ellis.

This time, she genuinely wished them well.

She drew meticulously, st**ke by st**ke, with great care. She didn't stop until the sun began to set.

Then, she heard the sound of a key in the front door.

Jayde went out to the living room and saw Brendan stumble in. He smelled strongly of al**hol.

""Brendan, why did you drink so much?"" Seeing his unsteady steps, she quickly went to help him.

Brendan leaned heavily on her, his large hand wrapping naturally around her waist. The strong scent of al**hol mixed with his familiar woody cologne filled her senses.

Jayde froze. She wanted to step back, to create some distance, but the next moment, Brendan pulled her into his embrace.

His restless hand slipped under her clothes, and his burning, al**hol-fueled k**s landed forcefully on her lips.

Chapter 7
Jayde Rosario's mind went completely blank.

This was the scene she had dreamed of countless times, but now it was happening, real and overwhelming. A rough hand moved over her ch**t, sending a jolt through her body that made her pull back, struggling against him.

""Brendan...""

Her struggle only seemed to make him more forceful.

""Chloie, be good..."" Brendan's passion-filled murmur exploded next to her ear like a clap of thunder.

In a daze, she felt herself being lifted. The man carried her into the bedroom and pushed her onto the bed.

It was only then, as she landed on the soft mattress, that she truly woke up from the intoxicating k**s.

""Brendan Maynard, look closely! I'm Jayde Rosario! I am not Chloie Ellis!""

Jayde's voice trembled with a pain that was sharp and heartbreaking.

Brendan stopped. His eyes, clouded with drunkenness, glanced at her. Then he simply pulled her into his arms and held her, doing nothing else.

Jayde tried to get up, but Brendan's hoarse voice whispered in her ear.

""Don't go.""

Her body went stiff. Her hands clenched into fists at her sides. Was he asking her to stay? Or did he still think she was Chloie Ellis?

Deep, even breathing sounds came from beside her. Brendan had closed his eyes and fallen asleep.

A sudden, suffocating feeling of powerlessness washed over her. She tried to break free from his arms, but his grip was too strong. She couldn't escape.

Her head felt heavy, and the lingering smell of al**hol on his breath made her even dizzier. An overwhelming fatigue washed over her, and she fell into a dazed sl**p.

The next morning, the first thing Jayde saw when she opened her eyes was Brendan. He was standing by the bed, looking down at her with an unreadable expression.

""Jayde Rosario, why are you in my bed?""

The events of last night flooded her mind, and her face flushed with heat. She instinctively opened her mouth to speak, but Brendan cut her off.

""If this happens again, you'll move to the school dorms. And you will never enter my room again!""

The man's reprimand was mixed with disappointment and disgust. It made Jayde swallow any explanation she might have had.

""I'm sorry,"" she said quietly. ""It won't happen again.""

She knew that even if she told him the truth, he wouldn't believe her. In his eyes, she was just his stepsister who had inappropriate feelings for him.

It didn't matter. Only five days left. In five days, she would be in California. From now on, she wouldn't just avoid his room; she would disappear from his world forever.

Jayde got out of bed, pulling her messy clothes together, and walked out of the room.

Just as she stepped into the hallway, she ran into Chloie Ellis coming up the stairs.

""Jayde, why are you coming out of your brother's room so early in the morning?!"" Chloie's voice was sharp with shock.

Jayde's face turned pale. She was flustered and didn't know what to say. She avoided Chloie's gaze and fled back to her own room.

But as soon as she entered, Chloie followed her in, slamming the door shut behind her.

""You were in your brother's room all night. What did you do?"" Chloie stared at her, her eyes filled with a dark, scrutinizing light.

""We're both women. I've always known how you feel about your brother. I thought you knew your place, but I never expected you to be so shameless. You took advantage of him when he was drunk and climbed into his bed!""

Chloie's words were filled with blatant disgust.

Jayde lowered her head. She knew any explanation would be useless. ""Last night, he and I didn't...""

Before she could finish, Chloie interrupted her sharply. ""He and I had a fight yesterday, and that gave you an opportunity. But we are getting married soon. If you pull another disgusting stunt like this, I will make sure you leave the Maynard family forever!""

After her threat, Chloie glared at Jayde one last time, then turned and slammed the door as she left.

Jayde slowly slid down the wall to the floor. She felt as if all her strength had been drained from her body, leaving her weak and helpless.

Brendan's reprimand and Chloie's warning were like an invisible hand, gripping her heart and squeezing tight.

Large tears rolled down her face uncontrollably. The emotions she had suppressed for so long finally shattered.

Jayde covered her mouth with her hands, letting the tears flow silently through her fingers.

Chapter 8
After some time, Jayde Rosario heard the roar of a car engine outside. She looked out the window and saw that Brendan Maynard had driven away with Chloie Ellis. She calmly looked away from the window, curled up on her bed, and hugged herself tightly.

The next morning, her phone rang, breaking the silence in her room. The screen displayed 'Mom'. Jayde hesitated for a moment before answering.

""Mom...""

She had barely spoken when her mother, Glenna Taylor's, angry voice came through the phone. ""Brendan and I were traveling for a month, and you cause a scandal like this. Your brother is getting married, and you're still trying to climb into his bed! Jayde Rosario, do you have no shame? Get out of there! Don't live with your brother anymore!""

A wave of immense sorrow washed over Jayde. When she was little, her family had gone bankrupt. Her parents divorced. Her father went to California, and her mother remarried into the Maynard family, bringing her along.

Her mother always said she was a burden. She said that because of Jayde, she couldn't have another child with Mr. Maynard. Over the years, her mother had rarely shown any care for her. The only two times she had actively 'cared'were to blame her.

Once, when she confessed to Brendan, her mother had called and screamed at her, calling her shameless.

Today, her mother was accusing her of climbing into Brendan's bed, saying she had no shame.

""Mom, you didn't even ask what happened. You're just certain I was the one who initiated it?"" Jayde asked, her voice trembling.

The phone was silent for a moment. Then her mother's disgusted voice came again. ""We're both women. Don't think I don't know what you're thinking! If you affect my standing in the Maynard family, you can go find your dad!""

After saying that, her mother hung up.

The black screen of the phone reflected Jayde's lost and haggard face. She bit her l*p hard, refusing to let the tears fall.

Looking at the word 'Mom'on her phone's contact list, she thought silently, Mom, don't worry. This daughter you dislike will completely leave the Maynard family, and you, in just 4 days.

For the next few days, Brendan didn't come home. Jayde was busy with her own preparations for going abroad and didn't pay any attention to where he and Chloie had gone.

Until 11:59 PM on August 24th. One minute before Brendan's birthday.

Jayde opened her social media and clicked on the only contact she had pinned. But after staring at the screen for a long time, she closed the chat. This was the first time in ten years she hadn't wished him a happy birthday.

At 8:00 AM the next morning, a flight reminder popped up on her phone.

Ms. Jayde Rosario, your flight will depart in 14 hours. Please arrive at the airport two hours in advance to complete check-in.

She calculated the time. She had only 12 hours left before she had to leave.

She found herself opening her social media again. She saw a new post from Chloie Ellis.

The sunrise by the sea is beautiful. Looking forward to the sunset and you this evening.

The post included a photo of her and Brendan holding hands at a place called Rose Coast.

Jayde's eyelashes fluttered. Her heart was calmer than she had expected.

At that moment, Chloie sent her a direct message.

Your brother wants to spend his birthday alone with me this year. I hope you won't disturb us.

Below the text was a 10-second video. In the video, Brendan was wearing a bathrobe, lying on a large, couple's-themed waterbed in a hotel room. Chloie was lying beside him, her shoulder exposed from under the blanket, covered in ambiguous red marks.

Jayde didn't need to think to know what kind of pa**ionate night they had just had.

She just twitched her lips, quietly exited the social media app, and then began to reconfirm and clear out all of her belongings in the house.

4 hours left.

Jayde took the entire sketchpad from her drawer and tore her drawings of Brendan into tiny pieces, one by one. The shredded paper went into the tr**h can, and the memories in her mind were cleared out, bit by bit.

3 hours left.

She threw out all her remaining personal items in the house, leaving no trace that she had ever lived there.

2 hours left.

She took the Totoro nightlight from her bedside table and placed it on the living room coffee table. She put it on top of the drawing she had made of Brendan and Chloie. It would be her last wedding gift to him, from his sister.

When she was eight, Brendan had been a light in her life. But from now on, she would be her own light.

Because she was a sunflower, no longer someone's rose.

1 hour left.

She left a small message in the bottom right corner of the sketch.

Brendan, happy birthday. Let's part ways here. We have no further connection.

I wish you all the best in a future without me.

Birds and fish travel different paths. Mountains and rivers will not meet again.

After that, Jayde picked up her phone. She deleted Brendan and Chloie Ellis as friends and deactivated her social media account. Then she did a full factory reset on her phone, erasing everything.

The whole process was done without a single moment of hesitation.

Having done all that, Jayde took one last look at the home she had lived in for ten years.

Then she turned and headed straight for the airport.

The plane roared into the sky.

I've never had an intolerance to food or dairy ever in my life. For the past 6 months or so, I've had diarrhea every day. The only thing that fixed it was the keto diet (tried for 9 weeks), but that didn't make me feel good in other ways so I stopped. I eat healthy, with lots of fiber and a well balanced diet filled with veggies and fruits, and eat from all four food groups, and eat low to moderate white carbs (limited bread and pasta, moderate rice and potatoes). Recently, I thought lactose intolerance may have been the cause but didn't test out the theory. However, I went home to Ontario for 2 weeks, and with no changes in my diet (including continuing to eat/drink dairy, and probably ate worse due to being on vacation), I had no diarrhea at all.

Its both the physical discomfort and the emotional one of having to face this loss on a deeper level of acceptance than I currently have. Yesterday a friend offered me a ticket las minute to see a show at Joe's Pub. Mostly singing, fun covers with backing tracks. Intimate space. I was terrified but also I know that I will probably not do something like this if I have too much time to think about it, so I just went for it. it wasn't easy, but the fun of listening to the music and dancing almost outweighed the discomfort. Yes, it was too loud (especially the applauding after), but I was also distracted for periods by the fun. Sometimes it can be harder in a quieter setting to block out the sensations of ear being clogged, echo-y, the loudness of my own voice...Anyway , it was a big first step and I am glad I did it.

1m8d51q,https://www.reddit.com/r/GuitarHeads/comments/1m8d51q/explore_the_ed07_guitar_practice_mat_review_is_it/,Explore the ED-07 Guitar Practice Mat Review: Is It Worth Your Time?,"The ED-07 Guitar Practice Mat has been with me for a couple of weeks, and if I‚Äôm being completely honest, I didn‚Äôt think a simple mat could make such a difference in my guitar practice routine. This product, designed specifically for music enthusiasts, combines a wealth of essential guitar knowledge, all laid out on a large 39‚Äù x 18‚Äù rubber mat. It features chord charts, scale guides, rhythm patterns, and even the sacred circle of fifths. As someone who‚Äôs constantly seeking out efficient ways to improve my guitar skills, this mat has proven to be unexpectedly useful.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The mat‚Äôs design is clean, intuitive, and packed with useful details. It‚Äôs made of sturdy rubber material that doesn‚Äôt feel cheap or flimsy in the slightest. The durability is evident, even after constant rolling and unrolling ‚Äî it lies perfectly flat every time I set it on my desk. The black background contrasts superbly with the clearly printed charts, which include major and minor chord diagrams, fretboard notes, and more advanced concepts like diminished chords and 7th chords. The material is also anti-slip, so once it‚Äôs on a smooth surface, it stays put.  

[Check ED-07 Guitar Practice Mat price on Amazon.](https://uguitars.com/p/b0dnyzbyxx/)

**Ease of Use and Clarity**  
What stands out right away is how clear everything is. I don‚Äôt need to squint or bring my face close to decipher the charts. As a visual learner, I find it incredibly helpful to have all the key data about chords, scales, and rhythms laid out in front of me during practice sessions. Whether you‚Äôre trying to nail down the fretboard or pick up something advanced like broken chord patterns, the mat offers a seamless guidance system without feeling overwhelming.

**Benefits**  
- Offers an all-in-one reference tool for guitar practice.  
- Durable rubber material ensures longevity.  
- Clear and easy-to-read charts eliminate confusion.  
- Compact and easy to store when rolled up.  

**Suitability for Guitarists of All Levels**  
I also had my nephew, who‚Äôs just starting to learn guitar, test it out. For him, having immediate access to a visual representation of fundamental chords was game-changing. This mat simplified things for him in a way that online videos just don‚Äôt. On the other hand, as an intermediate player myself, I appreciated the advanced features like high-level rhythmic patterns and complex chords. It‚Äôs rare to find a product that works for such a broad range of proficiency levels. Beginners will love how intuitive it is, while more seasoned players will find it a practical tool for self-directed learning.

**Portability and Convenience**  
One of my favorite features is how portable the mat is. Despite its large size, it rolls up with ease and fits comfortably in my gig bag. Whether I‚Äôm playing in my bedroom, practicing in a studio, or teaching others in a coffee shop, the mat is always ready to go. I don‚Äôt need to lug around books, which makes my practice sessions feel lighter and more organized.  

**Advantages**  
- Easy to transport, making it perfect for on-the-go musicians.   
- Works equally well on desks, tables, or flat surfaces.  

**Drawbacks**  
While this mat is, overall, an excellent addition to any guitarist‚Äôs toolkit, there are a few issues to consider:  
- At 39‚Äù x 18‚Äù, it‚Äôs quite large, so finding storage space can be tricky for some.  
- Serious wear and tear on the corners might occur over extended use despite its durability.  
- Advanced players might wish for even more niche music theory guides.  

**Competitive Options**  
In the crowded world of guitar accessories, it‚Äôs impossible not to compare the ED-07 Guitar Practice Mat with similar products. Rivals like guitar educational posters or apps come to mind. Posters lack this product‚Äôs portability and detailed scale visualizations, whereas apps often disrupt the flow of practice with notifications or loading screens. Another contender is laminated chord charts, though these are often clunky and lack the combination of rhythm and chord visuals this mat provides. The ED-07 stands out because it combines portability, breadth of information, and overall practicality in a way few other tools manage to achieve.  

**Smart Spending**  
When evaluating the price-to-quality ratio, this practice mat fares quite well. Considering how much educational information is packed into such a simple, physical tool, it‚Äôs an investment worth making for anyone serious about improving their guitar skills. It eliminates the need for multiple books or searching the internet during practice, which speeds up learning and brings focus to every session.

1m8d4sa,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1m8d4sa/explore_daisyhome_conv2024_cord_organizer_review/,Explore Daisyhome CO-NV-2024 Cord Organizer Review Is It Ideal for Kitchen Appliances?,"The Daisyhome CO-NV-2024 Cord Organizer for Kitchen Appliances caught my attention because, honestly, tangled appliance cords drive me absolutely nuts. It‚Äôs a familiar scene in my kitchen‚Äîblender cables entwined with the toaster wire or the pressure cooker cord threatening to trip someone. I decided to give this product a try, and let me share my experience.

**Compact and Thoughtful Design**  
What struck me first was the compact size and clever design of this cord organizer. It‚Äôs small enough to remain inconspicuous on appliances yet effective in functionality. Sporting sturdy rubber material, the device feels robust while maintaining flexibility to accommodate various cord sizes. The three slots are especially helpful in holding wires of different diameters without letting them slip. I tested it on my coffee maker, air fryer, and blender, all of which paired seamlessly with the organizer. The matte finish also adds a subtle aesthetic touch.

**Ease of Use**  
Setting it up was surprisingly easy‚Äîclean the appliance surface, peel off the adhesive backing, and press it into place. Pro tip: wait the suggested six hours before using it to allow the adhesive to bond securely. I tried it on a pressure cooker, and the result was impressive‚Äîit stayed rock solid, even with frequent use. For anyone as impatient as me, trust me when I say the wait is worth it.

[Check Daisyhome CO-NV-2024 price on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b0dg8hrxpq/)

**Upsides**  
This cord organizer brings some real perks to the table.  
- Durable, high-quality rubber and nano adhesive ensure longevity.  
- Fits most small kitchen appliances, making it versatile.  
- Keeps cords tidy and out of the way, eliminating accidents like tripping or tangling.  

**Hiccups Along the Way**  
No product is flawless, and this organizer has some areas that could use improvement.  
- The adhesive, while strong, may not work as effectively on textured surfaces.  
- Larger cords or heavily insulated wires might be a tight fit.  
- Once attached, it‚Äôs a tad difficult, if not impossible, to reposition without compromising the adhesive strength.

**Durable and High-Quality Material**  
The primary selling point is the premium build quality. The base, crafted from a high-strength rubber that resists deformation, feels engineered for heavy-duty usage. What‚Äôs equally noteworthy is the nano tape adhesive‚Äîit‚Äôs sturdy, sticks like a dream, and doesn‚Äôt leave annoying residue. On testing this across appliances like a toaster and air fryer, every device benefited from improved cable management. One of my relatives mentioned having concerns about adhesives peeling paint from surfaces, but I didn‚Äôt find this to be an issue.

**Market Rivals**  
When compared to other cord organizers like the Cordmate Cord Organizer or generic Velcro wraps, Daisyhome CO-NV-2024 stands out on several fronts. Its three-slot mechanism excels in handling wires of various diameters compared to single-slot designs. However, the Cordmate holds a slight edge in offering removable adhesives, which some might consider more practical for temporary use. That said, Daisyhome‚Äôs secure grip and rubbery flexibility make it more durable for long-term applications. For heavy appliance users like me, it delivers a more polished and permanent fix.

**Worth Every Penny**  
The price point of the organization system falls into a sweet spot with its functionality and quality. I‚Äôve spent money on inferior options in the past that either didn‚Äôt stick properly or wore out quickly, making this a much more reliable buy. Cost-conscious users might hesitate, but considering the functionality it brings to everyday life (no more hunting for untangled wires!), I would say it‚Äôs worth the investment.

1m8d49y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthymale/comments/1m8d49y/testosterone_influences_mens_buying_choices/,Testosterone Influences Men‚Äôs Buying Choices,"A study revealed that men's buying decisions are influenced by their testosterone levels.

It was concluded that men's testosterone levels influence their buying decisions.

The study, which was published in Nature Communications, involved a double-blind test. The participants were male subjects who were similar in age and socioeconomic status. They were given a placebo or a dose of testosterone gel.

The men were shown five sets of products that had similar perceived quality. However, one of these featured a higher social ranking.

The products featured in the experiment included various types of equipment and vehicles, such as coffee machines, watches, and luxury cars. The men were then asked to rank the brands by rating them on a scale of one to 10.

Although the descriptions of the products were similar, the researchers used different terms to emphasize the link between power, status, and high quality. For instance, one of the watches featured in the experiment had a description that said, ""supreme"" quality. On the other hand, the words used to emphasize status, such as ""sophisticated,"" ""prestige,"" and ""world-famous,"" were used to describe the products.

The results of the study revealed that men's testosterone levels affected their purchasing decisions.

Men who were given the hormone preferred products that were referred to as ""status-enhancing.""

According to the researchers, male hormones tend to increase in response to certain events, such as when one encounters an attractive partner or after a divorce.

The authors noted that the results of the study could also be reversed since men who own status-enhancing products tend to have higher testosterone levels.",1,1753383670.0,Healthymale,0,1.0,False
1m8d41w,https://www.reddit.com/r/clusterheads/comments/1m8d41w/my_11year_battle_with_cluster_headaches_in_india/,My 11-Year Battle with Cluster Headaches in India: From Misdiagnosis to Finding Hope,"**Hello, I am Pratik from Nagpur, India.**

It began in 2013, when I was just 13 years old. I used to experience sudden, extremely intense pain in my right eye, which would last only for a minute or so. I tried telling my parents, but since they had never actually seen me during one of those episodes, they were unsure what to make of it.

One day, my mother happened to see me in the middle of an attack. Even then, nobody really understood what was going on, so we decided to consult an ophthalmologist. He gave me prescription glasses and some medication. After a few days, that cycle of pain seemed to end.

The duration and frequency of the pain didn‚Äôt increase for years.  
I don‚Äôt remember much about having headaches during that time.

In 2017, I remember the cycle starting again‚Äîwith harrowing pain lasting around five minutes. By then, I had moved from my village to Nagpur. I asked around and eventually decided to consult a neurologist, Dr. Chandrashekhar Meshram. Thanks to the internet, I had done my research and was fairly certain I was experiencing cluster headaches.

When I explained my symptoms to Dr. Meshram and told him I believed I had cluster headaches, he dismissed my concerns outright, saying, *‚ÄúCluster headaches don't work like that.‚Äù*

He prescribed me some medication, but instead of helping, things got worse. The pain duration increased from 5 minutes to around 20 minutes within a week. Still, I continued taking the medicine as prescribed. Eventually, the cycle ended on its own, and everything returned to normal.

For the next two years, I didn‚Äôt experience any cluster headaches.

In **December 2019**, things went from bad to **unbearable**.  
One afternoon, while taking a nap, I suddenly woke up with a **severe, throbbing pain** concentrated on my **forehead, around the side of my right eye, and deep inside the middle of my eyebrow**. It lasted for nearly 15 minutes. Over the following days, the situation escalated‚ÄîI began experiencing **multiple headaches each day**. There was always that familiar, unsettling **tingling sensation** for about five minutes before the actual headache began, followed by **excruciating, pulsating pain** that stretched well beyond 15 minutes. Some days were tolerable, but others were absolutely **miserable**.

One of my relatives, who had found relief from migraines, suggested I consult **Dr. Sangram Wagh**, a neurologist she trusted.  
He was the first doctor who truly **listened** to everything I had to say and clinically diagnosed my condition as **cluster headache**. He started me on **Divaa 250** and **Verapamil 80 mg (twice a day)**. Along with these, he prescribed a thin, paper-like dissolvable strip (about the size of a penny), meant to be taken at the onset of pain‚Äîsomething that usually helps migraine patients.

However, when I tried it, the experience was horrific. Instead of easing the pain, it made the suffering worse‚ÄîI felt as if I couldn‚Äôt breathe properly. I gave it another try the next day, but the results were the same.

After three days, I went back to Dr. Wagh, and that‚Äôs when he decided to continue with the original two medicines but **added steroids**.  
And it worked like **magic**. Within just 5‚Äì6 days, my cycle stopped completely. That moment felt like a **breath of fresh air** after weeks of relentless agony.

My cycles usually begin either at the start of **winter** or during the onset of **monsoon**‚Äîaround **November‚ÄìDecember or June‚ÄìJuly**.  
After that particularly severe cycle in 2019, I began experiencing headaches either **every six months or once a year**. I tried all sorts of remedies‚Äî**strong coffee, ice packs, cold showers**‚Äîbut nothing provided any real relief.

About two years ago, during a winter cycle, I decided to consult a neurologist at the **Government Hospital in Nagpur**, hoping he might have treated cluster headache patients before. He hadn‚Äôt.  
Still, **Dr. Bansod** turned out to be a **great doctor**‚Äîhe gave me the right advice and the correct medication. He also suggested trying **pure oxygen therapy during an attack**, which is known to help some cluster headache patients. I tried to arrange it but failed to get access to medical-grade oxygen.

With every successive cycle, the **duration of the episodes** kept increasing.  
By **last July**, when the cycle started, the pain episodes were now lasting around **30 minutes**.

Someone suggested I consult **Dr. Pramod Giri**, who is considered one of the top neurologists in Nagpur.

In India, it often feels like popular doctors follow a predictable pattern. After I took the appointment, his assistant first spoke to me, asking about my condition. I told her I had cluster headaches. She brushed it off with a, *‚ÄúWe‚Äôll find that out,‚Äù* then asked about my pain and wrote down some medication. I didn‚Äôt explain everything to her because, well, I was there to consult **Dr. Giri**, not his assistant.

After **several hours of waiting**, my turn finally came. I began telling the doctor about my condition, explaining when it started and showing him the data I had recorded over the past few years.  
But instead of listening, he **shouted** at me, saying I had **‚ÄúMental Illness‚Äù (‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡§∏‡§ø‡§ï ‡§Ü‡§ú‡§æ‡§∞)**. He handed me the **same prescription** his assistant had written earlier and told me to take the medicines.

I followed his instructions‚Äîand that‚Äôs when **all hell broke loose**.  
He had prescribed **Sumatriptan** to take when I felt a headache was about to start. If I took it **10 minutes before** the onset, the headache wouldn‚Äôt come. But if I took it **right as the pain started**, the intensity would **shoot through the roof**. The attacks, which were 30 minutes earlier, now stretched into **90 minutes of pure hell**. I felt like dying.

The medicines drained me completely‚ÄîI had **no energy** left. I felt sedated all day, like a ghost of myself. Even my mother began to worry because I stopped talking to anyone. I would just lie in bed all day, utterly **exhausted and lifeless**.

After 10 days, I said, **‚ÄúEnough is enough,‚Äù** and stopped all medication.  
It took another **10 days** for me to return to normal. Thankfully, the headache duration also reduced back to **30 minutes**. I continued with **Verapamil** and **Divaa 250** for about a month, and the cycle finally ended.

The only medicines that have worked for me so far are **Verapamil-80**, **Divaa-250**, and **steroids**. Before the start of a cycle, I usually get early signs‚Äîsubtle indications that a cycle might begin. If I **start taking Divaa-250 prematurely, every night for a month or so, the cycle doesn‚Äôt start at all**. For some strange reason, **Divaa-250 OD doesn‚Äôt work**‚Äîonly the **plain version**, and only when taken at night. Mornings don‚Äôt work for me.

With **Verapamil**, taking **240 mg a day (three 80 mg tablets)** stops the headaches within **2 days**, but at the cost of feeling **lethargic and drained all day** due to the high dosage. Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt have any other option.

**Right now, I‚Äôm in the middle of a cycle that started 15 days ago.** Initially, I was taking **160 mg of Verapamil per day**, but the headaches didn‚Äôt stop. Four days ago, I increased the dosage to 240 mg. **Today was the second consecutive day without a headache.** Hopefully, after a month or so, I can gradually reduce the Verapamil dosage‚Äîand maybe, the cycle will end.

**Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve figured out so far:**  
Many so-called **‚Äúrenowned‚Äù doctors** are often just big names with **preconceived biases**. They rarely listen to patients, dismissing what we say instead of actually understanding the condition. In my experience, doctors like Dr. Wagh and Dr. Bansod, who genuinely **listen** and consider the patient‚Äôs own observations, end up helping far more than those who rely solely on their reputation.

Looking back on this journey, I‚Äôve realized how lonely and frustrating it can be to live with a condition that so few people truly understand. Cluster headaches are often called ‚Äúsuicide headaches‚Äù for a reason‚Äîthe pain is beyond words, and the lack of awareness among even experienced doctors only adds to the suffering. Over the years, I‚Äôve learned that healing is not just about medicine; it‚Äôs about finding doctors who **listen**, experimenting with what works for you, and holding on through the darkest days.

My **hell is far from over**‚ÄîI am only **24 years old** and, hopefully, have a long life ahead. I just hope I can find better treatments and coping mechanisms before the next cycle hits.",3,1753383658.0,clusterheads,0,1.0,False

1m8d0nv,https://i.redd.it/r4lr6bp7dvef1.jpeg,In praise of how fast MURICANs eat,"Americans have always been known to eat fast. We don't have time for 3-hour, la-di-dah lunches nibbling on crudit√©.

Since the early 19th century, European visitors to the U.S. have been aghast at how quickly we eat. I came across some choice quotes on this matter:

From Ten Restaurants That Changed America by Paul Freedman:

>European travelers were often taken aback by the crudeness of the new country‚Äôs culinary offerings, the slipshod rapidity of dining, and the absence of leisurely conversation imposed by the emphasis on speed and quantity rather than enjoyment and quality.

>An English visitor in the 1820s sniffily recalled the spectacle of fifty to a hundred hotel guests sitting down to breakfast and consuming a motley array of dishes in less than ten minutes. The main midday meal usually required no more than twenty minutes, and while the food was being voraciously gulped down, no conversation took place.

>Another traveler describes the atmosphere of one eating house as that of a funeral in its absence of conviviality, and otherwise as a contest to see how quickly one could finish what seemed to be regarded as an unpleasant task.

>Edward Henry Durell, briefly mayor of New Orleans during the Civil War, wrote in 1845 that American businessmen (as opposed to the more leisurely French Creoles) took a mere five minutes to devour dinner. The Anglo-Saxon race might be generally superior, he opined, but not in matters involving the delicate perception of taste.

From ""Speed Eating"" by Restauranting Through History:

>In the 1843 book Men and Manners in America, the author observed that ‚Äúall was hurry, bustle, clamor, and voracity, and the business of repletion went forward with a rapidity altogether unexampled.‚Äù He described how at breakfast he had barely arrived at the communal table as others were rushing off, leaving behind a terrific mess of chicken bones, an upset mustard pot, and a tablecloth with egg, coffee, and gravy stains. Dinner was no better: ‚Äúthe same scene of gulping and swallowing, as if for a wager.‚Äù Many of his fellow diners left the dining room before the second course and few waited for dessert.

>Viewed from the back, wrote an essayist in 1865, a row of 30 men with heads bent down and elbows moving rapidly looked as though they were weaving or fiddling. They finished in about 8 minutes.

>A Scribner‚Äôs story in 1874 described the typical American restaurant as a place where men ‚Äúdo not eat ‚Äì they feed,‚Äù without even removing their hats. It reported that the average mid-day ‚Äúdinner‚Äù time lasted 6 minutes and 45 seconds. At New York‚Äôs Astor House of the 1880s ‚Äì scarcely a low-class eatery ‚Äì many of the male customers ate standing up at a counter, a practice that was by no means rare. A visiting French economist attributed the popularity of 5-minute counter lunches in saloons to the wish not to interfere with business ‚Äî a convenience ‚Äúthat does not cut the day in two.‚Äù Or, as another writer put it in 1895, ‚ÄúThe ammunition is put in, with a wad of dessert on top, and in ten minutes the man who is going to be a millionaire in less than ten years is back at his desk, loaded and pointed at his work . . .‚Äù

>By the late 1890s, women had also become speed eaters, ‚Äústopping in restaurants when shopping and being in such a hurry that they don‚Äôt care what they eat and do not even remove hats and coats.‚Äù The so-called ‚Äúnew woman‚Äù was ready to sit at lunch counters ‚Äúlike a man and eat her pie and drink her coffee in a hurly-burly.‚Äù

1m8d0mz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Retatrutide/comments/1m8d0mz/returatide_fatigue/,Returatide Fatigue,"# Baseline: Who I Am & Where I Started

* **Age/Sex/Stats:** I‚Äôm a 28-year-old male, 5'8"", 210 pounds, \~25% body fat (sometimes creeping up to 27%).
* **History of Exercise:** 15 years of relatively consistent training.
   * Two years ago: 210 pounds, \~17% body fat.
   * Last year: Still exercising, but nowhere near as consistent as before.
   * Athletic benchmarks from my ‚Äúbetter‚Äù phase: ran a 10K at a 8-minute pace, completed 7000ft of vertical gain in a 24 hour rock climbing competition, deadlifted 455 pounds for reps, benched 265 for reps, squatted 315 for reps.
* **Current Reality:** I‚Äôm not in great shape right now‚Äîmost of this is based on past gains. I can still struggle through a 5k, bench 225, squat 275 etc. My body composition changed drastically when I trained less and stress-ate more due work. The last year and a half I have had a bad habit of binge eating before bed. That‚Äôs what pushed my body fat up and pushed me toward starting Retatrutide.

# Retatrutide Details

* **Timeline:** I‚Äôm in week three.
* **Dosing:** Started at 2 mg‚Äîno issues besides fatigue. Titrated up to 3 mg this third week.
* **Side Effects So Far:**
   * No gastroparesis.
   * Appetite is very low, but I can still get adequate food in.
   * **Major issue:** fatigue‚Äî‚Äúbone-deep‚Äù exhaustion and bouts of anhedonia.

# Nutritional Intake & Hydration

* **Calories:** \~1800-2000/day.
* **Protein:** \~150 grams/day.
* **Macros:** Fat and carbs vary, but neither drops below 30% of total intake.
* **Hydration & Electrolytes:** I drink 2.5 to 3.5 liters of water daily and take 1-2 packets LMNT electrolytes.

# Sleep

* **Quantity & Quality:** I‚Äôve been able to get 8 hours of sleep most nights, and it feels deep.
* **Problem:** I wake up exhausted. I feel like I could fall asleep any time during the day, even after a full night‚Äôs rest.

# Stimulants, Stress, and ‚ÄúBaseline Drive‚Äù

* **Workload:** A couple of 20-hour workdays recently, but that‚Äôs not the norm‚Äîmost nights I do sleep.
* **Medication & Stims:**
   * Adderall, 5 mg (very low dose).
   * 1‚Äì2 cups of coffee daily.
   * 3‚Äì6 mg nicotine daily.
* **How I Function:** I call myself a ‚Äúlower dopamine person‚Äù intrinsically, but paradoxically I‚Äôm driven and productive. The combo of nicotine, coffee, and Adderall usually lets me operate at high intensity for 10-hour workdays. Without stimulants I would often feel like being a couch potato-- not exhausted just not as palpably driven as I wanted to be. I'd have ambitions in my mind but have trouble acting on them. A little bit of coffee, sunlight, and nicotine completely switches my mode into a hard charging production machine.

# Exercise Effects on Energy

* **Observation:** Low-intensity activity (walking, etc.) often gives me a small energy boost.
* **Crash Pattern:** After riding that energy wave for an hour or two, if I sit down to work, I crash hard‚Äîdeep, bone-deep fatigue. This happens even when I‚Äôve eaten before, during, and after exercise.

# Supplements

* **For Sleep:** Magnesium, glycine, apigenin.
* **Daytime/General Health & Cognition:** Gorilla Multivitamin, 3g fish oil, 7.5g creatine, 5000iu vitamin D, thorne nicotinamide riboside, NAC, Tumeric.

# Labs & Biomarkers

* **Testosterone:** \~800 ng/dL.
* **Thyroid:** T3 and T4 are smack in the middle of the reference range.
* **Cholesterol:** Slightly elevated.
* **Glucose Control:** A1C is creeping into the ‚Äúpre-pre-diabetic‚Äù range (I‚Äôve gotten skinny fat).
* **General Health:** Otherwise, markers look fine.

# How I Feel Right Now

* **Fatigue:** Crushing, pervasive exhaustion‚Äî‚Äútired to my bones.‚Äù I feel better for a couple hours here an there but immediately crash. I am someone who knows being tired- I've pulled many all nighters for work in my life, been an endurance athlete and a mountaineer-- this feels different.
* **Anhedonia:** Not enjoying things much, could nap at any time.
* **Before Retatrutide:** My energy levels were fine. Often high.

# What I‚Äôm Asking

I want to dig into **true underlying causes** of Retatrutide-associated fatigue beyond:

* Insufficient calories
* Poor hydration
* Lack of sleep

One of two things is true:

1. I‚Äôm missing something in my current approach.
2. This level of fatigue/anhedonia is a real, unfortunate side effect of Retatrutide for me.

If #2 is true, I‚Äôll switch medications‚Äîbecause sustained job performance comes first.

1m8d0k0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m8d0k0,Help me pull together my mid-century modern living room vision!,"\*sorry for the repost somehow posted without all this?

**Background:**¬†Built my house in 2020 with the classic millennial gray everything. I usually redecorate yearly but never loved anything because of those gray floors. Finally got new flooring and paint done while I was away for work - husband did great with the basics, but everything else is just randomly placed back for now so ignore the actual decor pieces. The main take away from the new photos are references for the couch, tv unit, kitchen layout, new flooring and wall colors and overall layout.¬†

# Current Style Goals:

* **Moving from:**¬†Black/white still like neutrals but want pops or color too, modern industrial, cool tones
* **Moving to:**¬†Warm minimalist? Modern Scandinavian? Contemporary Mid-century modern? I have always like geometrics, clean lines, pops of colors/patterns (but not too trendy to avoid another ""millennial gray"" situation)
* **Want to:**¬†Incorporate new floor and walls (was anti-brown before, now love it but don't want overkill) I'm drawn to warm light wood colors, army green, terracotta colors, black or gold fixtures, and creating a cohesive look throughout my space. I love textures, color drenched walls, curtains, styled shelves and bookcases, built-ins, geometric shapes, and sticking to one accent color, fake plants, rattan material, clean lines, geometric shapes, and pops of pattern, wood paneling, concrete, black metal, Edison bulbs, unique ceiling fixtures, jewel tones, boucle fabric, and dark bold colors. I like my furniture to have a cohesive look but not necessarily match, and I prefer balance - not too minimal or maximal. Functional space and furniture are important to me, as is achieving a balance of masculine and feminine feel.¬†
* **I dislike:**¬†glam, fluffy or furry textures, floral patterns, lots of mixed colors or wood tones, silver finishes, gray color schemes, eclectic style, dark woods, pastels or light colors, farmhouse, country style, sterile environments, and mismatched furniture.
* **Accent color:**¬†Army green (currently on TV stand, planning built-in look with wood paneling behind TV)

# What's Set in Stone:

* New flooring and wall paint
* Army green TV stand (will become built-in with wood paneling)
* Rattan ceiling fan/light in living room
* Faux concrete table with black metal frame (mainly decorative)
* Black hexagon hardware throughout (open to changing to gold)
* Kitchen cabinets, countertops, appliances¬†

# Major Pieces I Need Help With:

1. **Coffee table**¬†\- Preferably lift-top for WFH use. Struggling with wood tone matching. Also, don‚Äôt want to spend a ton, but all the ones in budget just look so cheap.¬†
2. **Rug**¬†\- Must be washable and not super expensive (dog accidents). Originally thinking green but worried it's too one-dimensional. Pattern? Chocolate brown?¬†
3. **Curtains**¬†\- Want pattern for dimension but everything looks ""old lady."" Considering raising to ceiling height to draw eyes up. Also could do darker brown to tie in counters.
4. **Bar stools**¬†\- I bought the bar height chairs pictured on the mood board, but they just don‚Äôt look right. Thinking more classic barstool style without a back for curved island.
5. **Corner piece**¬†\- Behind the dining table, weird tucked spot next to the front door. Would like to be functional, maybe work space? But could also be a spot for a statement piece if it will help tie the living room and kitchen together. Currently empty but had a bookcase before and think it is too much with the built in tv unit that will have a lot of bookcase elements.¬†
6. **MAYBE? Couch**¬†\- Current modular configuration in the new photos is too large for the space. I typically have one or two of the sections stored in the garage. Furniture sits low (wiener dogs + back problems). Open to couch/loveseat/chair combo or new sectional. Budget: up to $3000. Must be dog-friendly and washable. I love the couch in the original mood board, but not sure if the color will be too much with the floors and walls. Want couch to be deep set, comfortable, and accommodate hosting people.¬†
7. **MAYBE? Light fixtures above table and pendant lights -**¬†I purchased the green one that is on the board board but it looked cheap. I don‚Äôt hate the ones I have now, but not sure if too much black or will go with the final vibe.
8. **MAYBE? Kitchen chairs -**¬†Open to budget friendly replacements to the leather ones I have now.¬†

# Design Challenges:

* Cohesion and pulling everything together
* Space feels boxy and rectangular
* Everything sits low, pulls eyes to ground
* Struggling with wood tone coordination
* Want to incorporate chocolate browns to tie in granite countertops
* Considering more green accent paint but unsure where
* Need large art piece ideas (current one covers small window, canvas style needed)

# Budget Notes:

* Willing to spend more on couch and curtains for longevity
* Want to keep other furniture/accessories lower budget (floors were expensive)
* Love DIY and thrifting smaller decor pieces - I am pretty good at styling and repurposing the small decor items and will take care of that once the bigger picture is done, so I don't need help with that.¬†

# Questions:

1. How do I add visual height to this low, boxy space?
2. Specific furniture examples?
3. What wood tones work well together? (I always struggle with this)
4. Should I carry the green accent paint further or add it elsewhere?

1m8cyqz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BirminghamUK/comments/1m8cyqz/37_f4a_looking_to_find_friends/,37 [F4A] looking to find friends‚Ä¶.,"Hi 

We all know how awkward it is to make friends in your 30s. And I have lost most of friends due to moving jobs and generally getting caught up with life and kids. 

Therefore I‚Äôm 37, no children, I work and study with time to meet and make friends. I don‚Äôt drink but I have no issue if you do. I would like to meet people who are curious, enjoy films especially horror (I miss having a horror film buddy), Star Trk, Disney, BBC sitcoms from 90s or earlier, love playing puzzles and board games, adore reading and regularly in Foyles and Waterstones. I work in Brum a few times a week and would consider meeting for a coffee/lunch. I‚Äôm from Sandwell and Dudley. If you commute via trains then Id loce to find someone I can complain about the crappy last minute delays etc. 

All I ask is that you‚Äôre local, articulate, around my age, able to hold a text and verbal conversation beyond one worded answers and genuinely looking to meet and spend time getting to know someone as a friend. I‚Äôm not after someone who ghosts. I‚Äôd love to find a film, coffee shop, days out friend but also someone who is looking to make life long connections. 

I‚Äôm ideally looking to chat for a few days and if things are going well then I‚Äôd move to meet in real life for a coffee initially. And I will ask to verify via pics and I will do the the same. If you‚Äôd like to send a message then please introduce yourself similar to how I have. ",3,1753383328.0,BirminghamUK,2,0.67,False
1m8cym6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1m8cym6/aio_for_leaving_my_friend_cause_she_did_not/,AIO for leaving my friend cause she did not invite me to her birthday?,"I (21F) was friends with another girl (same age as me) from the same college course in Brazil, I¬¥ll call her Naomi. We met in the beginning of the school year in 2024 and became big friends, I would often go to her house and we always had coffee together at class breaks with a group of other friends that she gathered (she is a very social person) after she met me, because we were both trasnferred to that college at the same time. 

Things were fine, I got some off vibes from those ppl cause she had absolutely zero criteria for befriending ppl, but it didin¬¥t bother me to the point of leaving that group arrangement because I really liked her. One year later and one of the friends (21M), who has depression, felt very excluded cause Naomi didnt invite him for the games night over the holidays (she would often invite us and some friends from her old school to play board games at her house), and parted from the group. 

She was very upset and went after him to ask him to stop with that attitude, cause she didn¬¥t think he would want to go to that meeting (he was, in fact, a bit evasive), but he said that it wasn¬¥t the only behaviour he didn¬¥t like form the group, and she could have at least invited. Other times he felt like the ppl form the group didn¬¥t care about him except for me, like when he needed help with his card and I was the only person to bother to go and help (when he sent a massage asking for help in the group I was in person with the others who audibly said couldn¬¥t be bothered to help). And when he fell and broke his foot we all came to help but I was the last one to leave (I thought he needed emotional support until better help arrived but the others didn¬¥t mind so much. I know they had obligations but it seemes I was the only one to leave a massage asking if he was okay later). Anyaways very shady group of ppl. 

But Naomi doesn¬¥t seem to be bad, she √≠s actually a very bright, easy going and funny person (also she has adhd and her therapist said her brain is stuck at 15). but she is too naive and doents see when ppl are mean. maybe she is also a bit eugocentric herself, not being able to see much past her own. Back to the story, afetr that friend left I was also very inclined to leave the group, cause I was also insitisfied with their behaviour towards me (a bit of hostility, I suppose because of my catholic religion and different life views). Then after a dumb provocation one of the memebers tried towards me, I got up from the coffee table and simply left without any explanation or drama. There wasn¬¥t any tentative from them of contacting me after for apologizing of anything (which helped me see things more clearly), apart from Naomi, who said I toke things too personaly (she took that from one of the girls there that talked bad about me), and wanted me to go back to the group. I said a clear No, and I said I thought those ppl were evil. 

I left the group. So it was more difficult to see Namoi. But I thought she would want to spend some time with me, right? Because we were still friends. But she never spent the class breaks with me apart from one time that she wanted to go find a book gallery that would open for one day and I suppose the others form the group didnt care to join her, so she called me and my friend Mia (fake name, 21F) that left the group to stay with me. After that, she always chose to spend time with them and not me. I also didnt call her to spend time with me during lunch breaks but that is a whole big story. (Basically i dont like sending her messages calling her to do things because she has a terrible habit of ignoring, so after explaining my frustration to her a couple os times and bc she didn¬¥t change, i just stopped sending to avoid the anxiety). 

Our friendship got colder because of that situation with the group, but we still had lunch together sometimes when she called me. Also, one of the group memebers (28M) hated me and the vibes were super awkward whenever we were in the same room. I tried being polite cause we are adults but was always met with ignorance. He was the one who made the provocation and probably felt stupid because the day I left I didn¬¥t give the satisfaction of reacting, which made him look like an unlikable person, instead of making me look bad like it would have I taken the bait.

Time passed and Naomi would throw a birthday party, which she told me during lunch she would not invite me because she didn¬¥t like the vibes it gives when me and that friend who hates me are together (even though she knew I tried being polite towards him and he was the one being rude). so she decided to leave me out of the party to call him, and said we could do something together with Mia to celebrate her birthday and that way I wouldn¬¥t miss the occasion. I was sad but tied to reason it in my head. but then she didn¬¥t call me to do anything. 

So I decided I didn¬¥t want that relationship anymore, i felt excluded and betrayed. So I left the whatsapp group we had with Mia and Naomi. Mia sent me a messagae asking me if I was okay with her, I said yes, my problem was with Naomi, and thats how she found out she was also excluded fromt he party and uninvited Naomi from her farewell party. Namoi asked me if I was okay with her and I said no because I thought our friendship was superficial. she begged me to come back to being her friedn saying that she really liked me, and that she felt that I had decided to exclude her from my life (she was right). Then I felt bad because I actually really liked her and we ended up agreeing on having lunch together. On the appointed day she didn¬¥t say anything and that lunch just didn¬¥t happen. And I feel like whenever there is  problem with anyone in her life all she does is humiliate herself cause she hates feeling that somene is upset with her, and instead of fixing the real issue, puts a bandaid on the situaion. 

I feel like I broke up with her. I just didnt say anything anymore and its been months. Its weird cause I really thought we were best friends, I met her whole family and she was one of my few friends here (im not form this city and live alone). Also, we spent a lot of time and did many things together, she was my first friend here, she even took care of my cat for a week when I traveled. It¬¥s weird. I don¬¥t know if im overreacting by distancing myself forever because of that, sometimes it really seems like she had no bad intent when deciding not to call me and do something apart instead (but she didn¬¥t do), because it seemed reasonable to her. She also said I was being childish because she had already explained why she was doing that.   


Also, about the fact that she didn¬¥t call me to do something apart form the party: she wanted to make a pijama night with me and Mia. But one day I said that I considered not going because of how devastated I was with the fact that she left me out of her birthday, when last year she called me and we had the best time with her old friends, and the person she excluded me to call didnt even show up last year. I was telling her this cause I was venting about her ignoring my messages, but I thought she would call me to do something else, Idk, she just said she was sad to hear that. I didnt say i wouldnt go, I said I had previsouly considered not going bc of how betrayed I felt. 

I dont know if there are things Im not seeing from this dynamic or if im making stuff up.  


What do you guys think of this whole situation? It was all very confusing to me, honestly. Please be kind and thank you for your attention!",1,1753383318.0,AmIOverreacting,1,0.67,False
1m8cyek,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m8cyek,Help me pull together my mid-century modern living room vision!,"\*sorry for the repost somehow posted without all this? First time poster. 

**Background:**¬†Built my house in 2020 with the classic millennial gray everything. I usually redecorate yearly but never loved anything because of those gray floors. Finally got new flooring and paint done while I was away for work - husband did great with the basics, but everything else is just randomly placed back for now so ignore the actual decor pieces. The main take away from the new photos are references for the couch, tv unit, kitchen layout, new flooring and wall colors and overall layout.¬†

# Current Style Goals:

* **Moving from:**¬†Black/white still like neutrals but want pops or color too, modern industrial, cool tones
* **Moving to:**¬†Warm minimalist? Modern Scandinavian? Contemporary Mid-century modern? I have always like geometrics, clean lines, pops of colors/patterns (but not too trendy to avoid another ""millennial gray"" situation)
* **Want to:**¬†Incorporate new floor and walls (was anti-brown before, now love it but don't want overkill) I'm drawn to warm light wood colors, army green, terracotta colors, black or gold fixtures, and creating a cohesive look throughout my space. I love textures, color drenched walls, curtains, styled shelves and bookcases, built-ins, geometric shapes, and sticking to one accent color, fake plants, rattan material, clean lines, geometric shapes, and pops of pattern, wood paneling, concrete, black metal, Edison bulbs, unique ceiling fixtures, jewel tones, boucle fabric, and dark bold colors. I like my furniture to have a cohesive look but not necessarily match, and I prefer balance - not too minimal or maximal. Functional space and furniture are important to me, as is achieving a balance of masculine and feminine feel.¬†
* **I dislike:**¬†glam, fluffy or furry textures, floral patterns, lots of mixed colors or wood tones, silver finishes, gray color schemes, eclectic style, dark woods, pastels or light colors, farmhouse, country style, sterile environments, and mismatched furniture.
* **Accent color:**¬†Army green (currently on TV stand, planning built-in look with wood paneling behind TV)

# What's Set in Stone:

* New flooring and wall paint
* Army green TV stand (will become built-in with wood paneling)
* Rattan ceiling fan/light in living room
* Faux concrete table with black metal frame (mainly decorative)
* Black hexagon hardware throughout (open to changing to gold)
* Kitchen cabinets, countertops, appliances¬†

# Major Pieces I Need Help With:

1. **Coffee table**¬†\- Preferably lift-top for WFH use. Struggling with wood tone matching. Also, don‚Äôt want to spend a ton, but all the ones in budget just look so cheap.¬†
2. **Rug**¬†\- Must be washable and not super expensive (dog accidents). Originally thinking green but worried it's too one-dimensional. Pattern? Chocolate brown?¬†
3. **Curtains**¬†\- Want pattern for dimension but everything looks ""old lady."" Considering raising to ceiling height to draw eyes up. Also could do darker brown to tie in counters.
4. **Bar stools**¬†\- I bought the bar height chairs pictured on the mood board, but they just don‚Äôt look right. Thinking more classic barstool style without a back for curved island.
5. **Corner piece**¬†\- Behind the dining table, weird tucked spot next to the front door. Would like to be functional, maybe work space? But could also be a spot for a statement piece if it will help tie the living room and kitchen together. Currently empty but had a bookcase before and think it is too much with the built in tv unit that will have a lot of bookcase elements.¬†
6. **MAYBE? Couch**¬†\- Current modular configuration in the new photos is too large for the space. I typically have one or two of the sections stored in the garage. Furniture sits low (wiener dogs + back problems). Open to couch/loveseat/chair combo or new sectional. Budget: up to $3000. Must be dog-friendly and washable. I love the couch in the original mood board, but not sure if the color will be too much with the floors and walls. Want couch to be deep set, comfortable, and accommodate hosting people.¬†
7. **MAYBE? Light fixtures above table and pendant lights -**¬†I purchased the green one that is on the board board but it looked cheap. I don‚Äôt hate the ones I have now, but not sure if too much black or will go with the final vibe.
8. **MAYBE? Kitchen chairs -**¬†Open to budget friendly replacements to the leather ones I have now.¬†

# Design Challenges:

* Cohesion and pulling everything together
* Space feels boxy and rectangular
* Everything sits low, pulls eyes to ground
* Struggling with wood tone coordination 
* Want to incorporate chocolate browns to tie in granite countertops
* Considering more green accent paint but unsure where
* Need large art piece ideas (current one covers small window, canvas style needed)

# Budget Notes:

* Willing to spend more on couch and curtains for longevity
* Want to keep other furniture/accessories lower budget (floors were expensive)
* Love DIY and thrifting smaller decor pieces - I am pretty good at styling and repurposing the small decor items and will take care of that once the bigger picture is done, so I don't need help with that.¬†

# Questions:

1. How do I add visual height to this low, boxy space?
2. Specific furniture examples?
3. What wood tones work well together? (I always struggle with this)
4. Should I carry the green accent paint further or add it elsewhere?
5. Any specific furniture piece recommendations for that weird corner spot?
6. How do I incorporate browns without going overboard?

**Note:**¬†Current photos are messy work-in-progress. Lots of natural light during day, new LED can lights are fully adjustable for brightness/warmth. Most current decor is randomly placed and will be repurposed/repainted/eliminated once vision is clear.

It was a reasonable choice they made. I was making people uncomfortable and was obsessive towards one of my friends, and that's reasonable. I just feel like punishing myself though, and that seems a bit extreme. 

  
I think I want to leave the internet because i'm scared to run into them on any site but I like the attention I get and this is probably the only thing keeping me sane for now. I don't drive and i'm reluctant to ask my parents to take me to places unless I know that they're ok with it because I manipulated them into going to this fucking gay coffee shop which they didn't want to go to and I need to control myself from doing anything like that again. I'm fucking spoiled and don't deserve anything at all.

  
I want a new life on the internet but I have been feeling like people, even online, are avoiding me and it's because I make them uncomfortable, and I think that is what is triggering it. 

  
I'm a joke, i'm a fucking joke, i'm so fucking awful and autistic. I hate my rep in some circles which was just me being a fucking weirdo. I think they want me to die. I think they want me to die. If I die then people will be happy.",1,1753383301.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

""Who did this to you, honey?"" I took off my jean jacket and handed it to her.

""I'm not gonna hurt you, sweetheart,"" I said softly. ""You must be cold, right? Put this on.""

Viking pulled into the Road Devil's parking lot and let out a sigh of mixed happiness and exhaustion. It was just past eleven o'clock in the morning, and he was going on almost two full days of zero sleep. He hoped that the guys at the Garage had the coffee on, but in a pinch, he'd meander over to Satan's Bar and see if Rebel would maybe open the kitchen an hour early. He needed to get that order of french fries soon anyway, or he'd pass out where he stood.

He was just stretching out his back when the guys started appearing from the various Road Devils businesses: his fellow Blue Dragon Ink workers, Arrow and Saint, were coming out of the tattoo parlour as Dux and Drake, the twins, walked out from the Garage. By the time he'd greeted them all, Wolf, Scars and Ice had joined the group, wearing matching grim expressions.

Viking exchanged looks with the three of them, loaded and meaningful looks. After all, he'd hauled out to Utah with a dead body on the say-so of the motorcycle club's President, Wolf Connor, and with the full knowledge of the Vice-President, Scars Innis. And of course, Ice Johansson had been there at Jolene's house in his role as ex-Enforcer and -Cleaner (well, ex until two nights ago), handling the god-awful mess left all over Jo's bedroom floor, walls and ceiling. Although everyone in the MC knew that Jo's ex-husband had shown up and hurt her, and they also knew that Jo had killed the jerk, they didn't have a clue where Viking had been the past couple of days.

They knew what he'd been doing, naturally, but they didn't have any details. They'd never had any, and Viking wasn't about to go all kumbaya and start sharing now, not even with Wolf. The law was clear on the matter of murder: no body, no crime.

""Hey, man,"" Wolf said in that voice that made the ladies squirm and the men look for a defensive weapon. ""Welcome back.""

""Thanks, Prez,"" Viking replied. ""Glad to be here.""

""You had a good couple of days away from here? Happy travellin'?""

""Sure did."" Viking stretched again, feeling the pull and ache in his lower back start to unravel. ""Got some fresh air, saw some sights, gave myself a back injury driving this van.""

Wolf nodded, his grey eyes sharp with understanding. The man had close to zero education if you thought of formal schooling, but his street smarts were off the charts, and nobody with an ounce of brain-power ever forgot that. Not friends or foes.

""OK, then,"" Wolf said in a tone that clearly indicated that the matter of Viking's whereabouts and activities was closed. ""You look like you need a coffee, huh?""

""That's a fact."" Viking unlocked the back door, swung it wide. ""We just have a few things here to put back in the Garage.""

""We got all that,"" Dux said and his brother nodded his identical dark head,

Viking said ""Just make sure that steel drum in the back there goes through the power-wash ASAP, OK?""

""Got it,"" Scars said, already in the van and handing boxes of tools out to the waiting men on the ground. ""You've done your bit, Viking, so go and kick back now. It's done.""

""Done,"" Viking echoed and gave his MC brothers a grin. ""Coffee time.""

Scars gave Arrow the last box of tools and reached for the foul-smelling drum ‚Äì he knew now how Viking had disposed of the evidence even if he had no clue where this had taken place ‚Äì when suddenly he paused. Without a word, he turned and hopped out of the van.

""Ummm, what's up?"" Saint said. ""That big old steel barrel too heavy for you to roll on over to us? Need a hand, old man?""

Wolf knew, though ‚Äì his Veep had that look on his scarred face. The one that made the hairs on Wolf's neck stand up; the one that said 'we got trouble', as clear as if Scars had said the words out loud.

It had to do with something else in the van.

""Scars."" Wolf spoke flatly, a dozen questions being asked in just the one word, and the men heard every single one of them loud and clear. They tensed, ready for whatever was happening.

""Someone's in there,"" Scars said in a low voice. ""Between the drum and the back wall.""

The men all spun around and stared into the van, squinting at the spot Scars had mentioned. Sure enough, they saw what looked like a pile of blankets ‚Äì and the pile was breathing. Quiet and shallow, to be sure, but still sucking in air.

""Jesus,"" Wolf muttered, wondering if he should send one of the guys to his office to get his gun locked in the wall safe. ""What?""

""No idea."" Viking was utterly astonished. ""Wolf ‚Äì I don't know. I didn't see anyone back there at all.""

Ice reached behind and under his cut, pulled a gun from the holder on his lower back.

Wolf took a step forward. ""We see you there, under the blankets. C'mon out.""

The bundle didn't move.

""Listen up, jerk. You can come out willingly or we can drag you out by your fuckin' throat. We're good either way, but I was thinkin' that you might prefer to keep on breathin' nice and easy.""

Still nothing.

""OK, boys,"" Wolf said. ""Bring him out, I don't care if it's in pieces.""

There was a squeak and the blankets twitched, then slowly fell to the floor. A man's boot appeared, then a huge coat. The person was still hidden behind the steel container, and seemed hesitant to actually come forward.

""C'mon now,"" Wolf said in his scary voice, the one that he'd routinely used just before beating someone's face in. ""Last chance to come out by choice.""

A slight pause, then the stowaway stepped into the middle of the van, head down, face hidden behind a scarf.

The men froze at the tiny person standing there ‚Äì this wasn't what they'd been expecting. Not even remotely.

""Jesus,"" Drake said, stunned. ""It's a kid.""

Iris stood at the back of the van, trembling wildly despite the layers of thick, heavy clothing on her body and covering her face. She glanced up quickly, then immediately wished that she hadn't.

The group of people standing in front of her were ‚Äì to put it mildly ‚Äì the most terrifying men that she'd ever seen. More terrifying that she'd even be able to imagine in her most nightmare-ish imaginings... yet here they stood, very much alive and in the flesh, wearing matching black vests with badges or patches or something. Staring at her, looking not at all thrilled to see her in their van, looking like they'd just been released from jail ‚Äì or were on their ways there on murder charges. Multiple charges.

Whoever she'd thought would eventually open the van door, what was actually standing in front of her now was so much worse than Iris could have ever predicted.

""Jesus,"" said a dark-haired giant with piercing dark-blue eyes. ""It's a kid.""

""Jesus,"" said another man, and Iris started when she saw that he was identical to the first one who'd spoken. ""How did he get in there?""

""No clue,"" said a massive guy with a wild beard; Iris recognized his voice from the hours of singing. ""I can't even begin to guess.""

""C'mere,"" snapped a rough voice, one that Iris identified as belonging to the man who'd threatened to drag her out by her throat. ""No fuckin' games, you got it, kid?""

She nodded, took a few small steps forward. Not so much to get close to the group of scary men, more to show a spirit of cooperation.

""Wait."" A man with sky-blue eyes in a badly-scarred face spoke now. ""What do you have under all that clothing? You got a weapon?""

Startled again, she shook her head.

""Yeah, we won't be takin' your word for that, seein' how even a five-year-old can pull a trigger,"" said the threats guy, his wolf-grey eyes narrowed. ""Coat off.""

Iris hesitated, looked at the group of large men, realized that she had no choices here. Reluctantly, she shed the coat, leaving the cardigan hanging the length of her body and the scarves wrapped around her face and legs. She hoped hard that they didn't want anything else taken off, but of course, luck was not on her side.

""Everythin' off,"" the scary man snapped. ""Let's go.""

Iris shut her eyes. Prayer had never helped her before in her life, certainly not Gideon's kind of prayer, and once again, every possible deity across all the heavens let her down.

""Now. Or I get in there and strip you down personally.""

Just about the last thing that Iris wanted was any of these men to touch her. Quickly, she unwound the scarves around her calves, dropped them on the floor. She undid the cardigan with trembling fingers, feeling smaller and more vulnerable with every button sliding out. She shrugged the last piece of solid clothing off her body, raised her hands to her throat.

""Wait.""

She paused in unwrapping the scarf from her neck and face, a bit unnerved by the scary man's sudden change in tone. He didn't sound angry anymore, instead he sounded ‚Äì shocked? Confused? And that was when she realized what these men were seeing in front of them.

She was standing there in a white nightgown and men's boots and not much else. It was obvious now that she was a woman ‚Äì she didn't have much in the way of breasts, but the thin gown left exactly nothing to the imagination. Anyone with eyes would see that she was no man, not even a teenaged boy.

Iris had nothing left to lose anymore; she was as trapped and helpless as she'd been when she was drugged into compliance by Gideon and his monster Guardians.

These guys were looking at her like they had her very painful demise fully planned out in their Neanderthal minds. And to be honest, all they had to do was shut the van door, get in the driver's seat, floor it out of wherever they were, sit on her until her breath ran out, and dump her body somewhere. These guys looked like they knew good and well how to dispose of pesky problems ‚Äì things like living, breathing human beings who were in the wrong place at the wrong time.

So it was nothing but a shock when the wolf-eyed nightmare and the scar-faced giant exchanged quick glances, then nodded at the huge guy with the beard who'd driven her into this situation. Right away, he took off his black leather vest thing with the insignias and badges all over it, then removed the fleece-lined jean jacket underneath, leaving him in just a black t-shirt. She shrank back against the wall as he approached and he paused. Without a word, the other men moved back as one, almost as if they'd been told to do so.

The man extended his tattooed arm, holding the jean jacket. ""Here, honey.""

Iris blinked.

""I'm not gonna hurt you, none of us will,"" he told her, and she watched the blond one with the ice-blue eyes tuck his gun away. ""I was just thinking that you were cold. You must be, right?""

Her teeth were chattering, whether from the freezing air or fear, she didn't know. Probably both.

""Are you cold?"" he asked.

""Y ‚Äì yes,"" she stuttered. ""I am.""

""OK, then."" He put the jacket on the floor, backed up right away. ""Put this on.""

Iris watched the men watch her as she carefully stepped forward, paused, stepped forward again.

She darted forward, snatched the jacket off the floor, took six steps back before slipping her arms into the sleeves. It was massive on her, but it was warm and smelled of a spicy, citrusy cologne and something else, something strong, smoky. The scent made her a bit weak in the knees ‚Äì it had been a long time since she'd inhaled that heady smell of pure, amazing man.

Jesus Christ, get it together girl.

""OK,"" said the wolf-eyed creature in a soft voice, or as soft as a man who clearly gargled gravel could manage. ""Let's get you inside. You hungry, sweetheart?""

Iris blinked again, this time at the endearment.

""Ummmm,"" she said. ""Yes.""

""C'mon out of there, then,"" he said. ""We got one a cook over at the bar, just across the parkin' lot. He can make anythin' you ask for.""

It occurred to her that she could get out of the van, all docile and sweet, and then just make a run for it. But that was pointless and dumb and would just piss them off and besides, she'd get two steps before tripping over her own feet in these boots.

So here was the moment of truth: she had to believe that despite appearances, these men wouldn't hurt her. She had no reason to think they would, really, since they could have pulverized her by now and they hadn't ‚Äì so she had to have faith. Real faith, the kind that Gideon knew nothing about despite all his preaching, the kind which had eluded her for years and years, maybe her whole life. But she had to have some now.

With a sense of falling, a sense of flying, Iris climbed down to the ground, realized that the men were even taller and bigger now than she'd thought from her elevated position. But they were forming a loose semi-circle around her now and gazing down at her with real worry on their hard faces.

Without saying a word, they'd all moved to block her from the wind howling around them, and without touching her, they'd started to guide her over to a building called Satan's Bar. Iris' feet began to move on their accord and despite herself, she felt something that she hadn't felt in a long, long time. She was so surprised at the feeling that at first she couldn't believe it; it took her several seconds to actually name the emotion, and then she knew that it was true:

I mean like in canon Tim doesn't even drink coffee that much but fanon has him obssessed with it as his favourite drink. Fanon also views Tim as like some guy who is one bad away from being a villain or like a mini Lex Luthor who will drop bodies at a hat, when in canon when Tim lost his dad, Conner, Stephanie, and Bart he didn't go anywhere near that and even threatened to kill himself when he saw a future of himself as a gun toting killler. Fanon also acts as if his parents were abusive and did things like hit him when at worst they were neglectful but still loved him. They also act like Jason is his closest bro and was Tim's favourite Robin and said stuff like Dick tried to put him in Arkham, when Dick is the closest to Tim and was Tim's Robin. Fanon also acts as if his relationship with Stephanie either never happened, or they like dated for like two seconds and have this deep history as ""platonic besties"" and act like his only two romances are kon and bernard, when Tim and Stephanie have 30 years of history and barely interact now and Kon isn't a love interest.

Like it feels like fanon Tim is such a completely different thing from canon Tim that it's baffling to see how there is such a divide.",10,1753383281.0,Robin,5,0.81,False

Then the next day (two days) I drank the rest and made another and drank that, and I really felt good but also strangely not tired so I went out and did a few things instead of just trying to make sure I slept at night this time.
After waking up at 9pm yesterday I have not been to sleep yet for more than 24 hours 6 days in a row and as I was trying to figure out why today it hit me at 9 am or so, when I drank even more, only by a small margin, at around 10 to midnight beforehand, because I liked the taste of it and thought the improvement of brain health would also fix my sleep issue, very dumb logic forgetting that its for focus and not just general neuroplasticity.
Naturally I pissed myself off figuring this out and I'm making stuff with enough water and sodium to flush this out of my system and exercising because God knew I would be too powerful if I had regular bowel movements.

I don't have enough coffee in me and we're usually counting down the time until our caregiver arrives. With about 25 minutes to spare in that window, I usually default to putting on PBS Kids or Bluey or part of a movie so I can drink coffee in silence after the rush of getting ready for our day. Today, I decided to try Mr. Rogers again. Typically, they complain they don't YIKE Mr. Rogers (despite learning to love Daniel Tiger). So I settled on looking through some clips. 

I grew up watching Mr. Rogers Neighborhood, usually at my grandma's house. I have so many fond memories of various episodes, and his routine of coming in the house, taking off his jacket and putting on his sweater, and changing his shoes is burned into my memory. The clip I found was Daniel Tiger (the puppet, cartoon Daniel's father) singing [""Sometimes I wonder if I'm a mistake""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8ZQe-aSsk8&list=RDG8ZQe-aSsk8&start_radio=1), with Lady Aberlin reassuring Daniel that she is proud of him and loves him very much, even though he doesn't feel like a strong or fierce tiger. The boys started off ignoring the song, but by the time Lady Aberlin started singing, they were paying close attention. 

""I think you are just fine as you are  
I really must tell you  
I do like the person that you are becoming  
When you are sleeping  
When you are waking  
You are my friend

It's really true  
I like you  
Crying or shaking or dreaming or breaking  
There's no one mistaking it  
You're my best friend"" 

I couldn't help but feel like there were three four year olds watching - my two boys, and the little girl I used to be and still am to some degree now, listening carefully. Reminded that we are liked just the way we are, and that how we feel right now is important. 

This season of parenthood, in this world, isn't always easy. I know as a grown up I feel self doubt a lot. I feel like a mistake sometimes. It's hard to model the kind of compassion I want my boys to have for themselves, but I am grateful that we stumbled onto the right message at the right time. Multiples are tough, man. Being a grown up is tough.  I wanted to share this with you, too, in case you're feeling like everything is wrong. Especially if you're a first time parent to newborn or young multiples - you are doing great. ",3,1753383057.0,parentsofmultiples,1,1.0,False

""Please. Stay here, with us.""","Are you sure about this, Sienna?"" Outside the airport terminal, a woman in a chic white suit clutched Sienna's hand, her own trembling.

""You don't have to go back to Solara,"" she begged. Her blonde hair and blue eyes were swimming with a desperate plea. ""Please. Stay here, with us.""

Sienna Hart, a vision of cool elegance, met her foster mother's gaze. She pulled her into a deep, meaningful hug, her own eyes stinging.

""I have to go back, Mom,"" she said softly. ""But I'll be back. I promise.""

But as the plane taxied down the runway, she knew this was a promise she might not be able to keep.

Three days ago, the dam of her memory had broken. Ten years, washed away in an instant, revealing the truth of who she was.

She remembered she was Sienna Hart, eldest daughter of the prestigious Hart family of Vallaris.

At eighteen, a trip abroad had ended in a fiery plane crash. By some miracle, she survived, only to be found by a kind couple who, believing she had no one, adopted her and raised her as their own.

Now, at twenty-eight, the past had come rushing back. Her family was alive. The weight of that knowledge was a moral compass she couldn't ignore. She had to go home.

The flight was long, but sleep was a distant stranger. Sienna spent the hours piecing together the fractured memories of her family. It all felt like a bizarre, vivid dream from another lifetime.

\*\*\*\*\*

At ten past 10 at night, Sienna finally arrived in Vallaris. She hailed a cab, and the driver greeted her with thick Vallaris accent. ""Where to, Miss?""

A faint smile touched her lips. ""88 Maplecrest Avenue, please.""

""Well, I'll be,"" the driver said, catching her accent. ""You don't look local. I thought you were a tourist.""

Sienna's smile widened. ""I'm from here. It's just‚Ä¶ ""

The smile faltered, a shadow of old pain and fresh hope passing through her eyes. ""It's been a long time.""

Ten years. A lifetime. Everything she knew was gone. She found herself thinking about her three little sisters‚Äîthe giggles, the late-night chats, the way they used to huddle together on cold nights. 'Where are they now?' she wondered. 'Are they doing okay?'

As she sank into her memories, the driver kept chattering on how kids these days didn't visit their parents enough. He didn't stop talking until they finally pulled up to the address.

But as Sienna stepped out of the car, her eyes landed on a club she didn't recognize‚ÄîCharmvale. She stared at the sign, her brow knitting together. The name felt strange in her mouth. The world had really gone on without her.

Just as she turned to leave, a heated argument at the club's entrance caught her eye. A man stood there, hands buried in his pockets lazily. He had the kind of face that spelled heartbreak, and his voice cut through the air like a blade, laced with cold indifference.

""Get it through your head,"" he was speaking to a young girl, who looked painfully thin in her simple dress. ""You're a stand-in. A substitute. Do I have to spell it out for you?""

The girl's eyes were rimmed with red, her pretty face blotched with tears. ""Mason, I already told you,"" she replied. ""I'm not feeling well, so I'm not going to the hospital to donate blood today.""

""Not feeling well?"" Mason Quinn let out a cruel laugh. He grabbed her chin, forcing her to meet his gaze. ""Is that why you're here, selling drinks? Or is it something else you're selling, Vivian?""

Vivian Hart's jaw tightened. With a sharp crack, her hand flew across his face.

""You're a monster, Mason,"" she spat, her voice trembling with rage. ""I've paid my debts. We're done. Now get away from me!""

Mason's head snapped to the side from the blow, but the cold grin never left his face. ""You don't get to decide when we're done,"" he scoffed. ""Did you forget? If it weren't for my family's engagement to yours three years ago, the Harts would've gone under. You want to walk away? Be my guest. But I wonder what your father would have to say about that.""

With that, he grabbed her arm, and started dragging her toward his car. ""If you want to keep playing the part of my fianc√©e, you'll do as you're told. Chloe needs your blood. It's the only thing you're good for, after all.""

A wave of utter despair washed over Vivian. She closed her eyes, defeated.

To her, it had always been this way. Three years ago, she'd believed he was her savior. She'd thought he truly cared. But it was all a lie. Mason had only seen her as a walking, breathing medicine cabinet for Chloe Zalton, the one he actually loved.

In the name of ""treatment,"" she had to go every month to donate blood for Chloe. And when she tried to put a stop to it, her own father slapped her for even bringing it up.

Just as Vivian was about to be pushed into the car, a cold, cutting voice sliced through the night. ""Let her go.""

Mason froze, turning to face a woman whose beauty was as breathtaking as the steel in her gaze.

""Who are you?"" Mason scowled. ""This is a private matter.""

But when Vivian heard that voice, the world seemed to shift beneath her feet. It was a voice she recognized deep in her soul, a voice from a life she believed had vanished forever.

She looked up, her body rigid with disbelief. The face‚Äîso familiar, so regal, so achingly missed‚Äîsent a tremor through her heart.

A trembling hand reached out, her own face a mask of shock. Her lips parted, and a single, fragile word escaped, a name she'd only dared to whisper in her dreams.

""Sienna?"" she mumbled. ""Is that you?""

Sienna's gaze softened as she looked at the broken girl before her. Vivian, her second sister, had been just fifteen when Sienna left. Now grown, she still carried that same spark in her eyes.

""It's me, Vivian,"" Sienna said, her voice a gentle balm. ""I'm back.""

""Sis!""

Vivian ripped her arm from Mason's grasp and threw herself into Sienna's embrace, sobbing as if her heart would break.

All the years of pain, of loneliness, of quiet desperation, came pouring out. She clung to Sienna like a drowning girl to a lifeline, shaking with fear that this was all a dream, another cruel trick of her mind.

Sienna held her tight, stroking her back. Her voice was a steady, warm anchor in the storm.

""It's okay,"" she murmured. ""I'm here now. I'm back, and I'm not going anywhere.""

Vivian cried until Sienna's shoulder was soaked, finally pulling back with a sniffle of embarrassment, her eyes puffy and red.

""Is this real?"" she whispered. ""You're really here? Am I still dreaming?""

Sienna's heart ached. ""It's real, Vivian. I'm really back."" And she swore she would burn the world to the ground before she ever left her again.

Meanwhile, Mason, who had been ignored for so long, was now utterly confused. 'Sis?' he wondered. 'Vivian didn't have a sister. She was the eldest‚Ä¶ wasn't she?'

""Vivian, are you done with this melodrama?"" he chimed in. ""We're leaving. Now.""

But before he could finish the sentence, another sharp smack echoed in the night air. Mason stumbled, his head whipping to the side.

Sienna had hit him hard, without holding back. She'd been listening to his vile performance, her fury coiled like a snake in her gut.

What a joke,' Sienna thought. 'A substitute? Forced blood donations? What kind of sick, primetime drama is this?'

Then Mason called out Vivian's name, and Sienna strode forward. Though ten years had passed, she recognized Vivian instantly. Her pitiful, vulnerable look tugged at Sienna's heart.

Bullying her family right in front of her? To Sienna, that was the last straw. Mason might as well have been asking for trouble.

""What are you doing? Do you have any idea who I am?"" cried Mason. The slap had left him dazed, his cheek was numb and painful. ""I'm Vivian's boyfriend! Who do you think you are?""

Mason glared at the woman before him, but his bravado quickly faded. The woman standing there radiated a power that was genuinely terrifying. A cold dread crept over him.

""I'm her sister,"" Sienna pulled Vivian behind her, her voice deadly calm. ""And you just laid a hand on my family. So, tell me. Do you want to leave here walking, or crawling?""

Vivian sniffled, the fear instantly replaced by a surge of strength. Sienna was a fortress, and inside her walls, nothing could touch her.

""Sienna, I hate him,"" she whimpered, clinging to Sienna's arm. ""He's a bully.""

That was all Sienna needed to hear. She drove her foot into Mason's stomach, sending him sprawling to the pavement again.

""You‚Ä¶ you'll pay for this!"" Mason gasped, yet he could do nothing but scramble away.

# 2.Chapter 2 A Gilded Cage No More

Steering Vivian away from the chaos, Sienna stopped at a quiet corner and gently dabbed at the lingering tears on her cheeks.

Vivian was not so short, but next to Sienna with those heels on, she looked as fragile as a porcelain doll.

""Don't cry, Vivian,"" Sienna said softly. ""Tell me what happened. Tell me everything.""

Vivian's shoulders shook with silent sobs. She didn't want to cry, but the injustice of it all was overwhelming.

Everyone had told her Sienna was dead‚Äîgone for ten years, a full decade of silence. But she never believed it. There were so many things she wanted to ask her.

Seeing Vivian so upset, Sienna decided to take her somewhere quiet to eat and talk. She took her to a cozy diner and ordered steaks for both of them. As the hot food arrived, Vivian's storm of emotions began to calm.

""Sienna‚Ä¶ where were you these years?"" she wiped her face clean and finally asked the question that had been haunting her for years, ""They all said you were dead‚Ä¶ ""

Vivian had never believed it‚Äînor had the other sisters. Not the official story about the plane crash. But after ten years without a single word, even the strongest hope begins to fade.

A wave of guilt washed over Sienna. ""I thought I was dead, too,"" she admitted. ""By some miracle, I survived. A kind couple found me, adopted me.""

Watching Vivian's expression closely, she slowly continued, ""But I had amnesia. For ten years, I didn't know who I was. Then, three days ago, everything came rushing back. The moment it did, I booked a flight home to find you.""

Amnesia. That single word wiped away a decade of resentment. All the anger Vivian had held onto‚Äîfor being abandoned, for being left alone‚Äîseemed to vanish into thin air.

""It's our fault. We should've found you sooner‚Ä¶"" Vivian's voice cracked as she looked across the table at Sienna, scared she might disappear like a ghost.

""Enough of that,"" Sienna said gently but firmly. ""Now, tell me about that Mason.""

""He's my ex. But we're over now,"" Vivian said, a little too quickly. She couldn't bear for Sienna to know the whole, humiliating story. ""Speaking of that, how about staying with me tonight?""

Sienna didn't push. If Vivian wouldn't tell her, she'd find out on her own. And anyone who had hurt her family would learn the true meaning of regret.

After they finished eating and talked a bit more, they left the diner. When they arrived at the address Vivian had given, Sienna stopped in her tracks. The building was a rundown walk-up in a rough part of town.

""Vivian, this is where you live?"" she asked, disbelief clear in her voice.

Their family home was a sprawling villa at No. 1 Southlake. Why was Vivian living here? Was this some misguided attempt at independence? Sienna felt a knot of confusion tighten in her chest.

Vivian couldn't meet her eyes. She had been thrown out of her home seven years ago. How could she possibly explain that?

""It's not so bad. Come on, let's go up!"" she said, leading Sienna upstairs.

Sienna followed silently, swallowing her questions. Just as Vivian reached for the door, a portly, greasy-looking man stepped forward, blocking their way.

""Vivian! Late on the rent again, I see,"" he boomed. ""You're six months behind! With utilities, you owe me two thousand bucks! And now you're bringing guests? Pay up!""

Vivian froze, her face a mixture of panic and shame as she glanced between the landlord and Sienna. She prayed he would just shut up.

""I've been patient with you, you know, 'cause you're a pretty little thing,"" the landlord continued. ""But you're pushing your luck! A girl who looks like you can't scrape together two grand? What a waste.""

His eyes roamed over Vivian with a possessive leer that sent a chill down Sienna's spine. It was clear he expected payment of a different kind, not money.

Just as Vivian opened her mouth to protest, Sienna stepped forward. She pulled a thick wad of cash from her purse and slammed it into the man's chest.

""Here's the rent,"" she said, her voice dripping with ice. ""Now get out of my sight before I do something we'll both regret.""

""Hey! Who do you think you are?"" the landlord sputtered, stunned by the cash. But before he could say more, Sienna had pulled Vivian inside and bolted the door.

""Sienna, I‚Ä¶"" Vivian stared at the floor, unable to look at the sister she'd always worshipped.

Sienna said nothing. She calmly set down her luggage, cracked open a window to let in the cool night air, and switched on the light.

The room was tiny, the furniture old, the walls peeling. But it was tidy and had a certain warmth to it. It was obviously a home, one Vivian had lived in for a long, long time.

She then turned to Vivian, studying her expression carefully for a moment. Her face was still sweet and round, her big, bright eyes just as striking as when she was little. Her long, straight hair fell like a curtain as she hung her head in shame.

In the end, Sienna simply opened her suitcase and asked, ""Do you want to shower first, or should I?""

""Huh?"" Vivian's mind went blank.

She'd been desperately trying to come up with a believable lie, a story to explain everything. But that simple, everyday question caught her completely off guard. She'd expected accusations. Demands. Not this.

She blinked, watching as Sienna picked up a silk pajama set and walked toward her. Then, without thinking, she squeezed her eyes shut.

She must be mad. She's going to hit me,' Vivian thought. 'And honestly‚Ä¶ I deserve it. I'm so useless.'

She began to replay everything in her mind. After Sienna left, nothing stayed‚Äîshe couldn't even go home. Their mother's belongings had all been taken over by that woman, and their father had changed too, twisted into someone unrecognizable.

It felt like she couldn't protect anything. Not even the Bartholomew Bear Sienna had loved so much‚Äîshe hadn't managed to save that either. Her younger sisters had scattered, pulled in different directions, and she‚Ä¶ she had failed them all.

But the slap never came. Instead, a gentle hand began to stroke her hair. Vivian's eyes shot open. Sienna was looking down at her, a soft smile on her face that seemed to warm the entire room, chasing away the shadows in Vivian's heart.

""You need a minute? I'll go first, then,"" Sienna said softly, and disappeared into the bathroom.

Vivian stood there, dazed, a slow, brilliant smile blooming across her face. She stared at the closed bathroom door, her heart filling with a feeling she hadn't known in ten years‚Äîhope.

A few minutes later, Sienna stepped out, wrapped in a cloud of steam and the soft scent of body lotion. Her skin glowed, and a silky, moon-white nightgown draped effortlessly over her graceful frame. Curls spilled over her shoulders, damp and tousled. She looked like she'd walked straight out of a dream.

Drying her hair with a towel, she caught Vivian staring, wide-eyed. Sienna let out a soft laugh and reached over to give her cheek a gentle, teasing pinch. ""Your turn, Vivian.""

Vivian blushed deep red, wishing she could sink right through the floor. She watched as Sienna sat down on the edge of the bed, and somehow, the drab little apartment seemed to change. The peeling walls, the dim light‚Ä¶it all faded into the background.

In that moment, the whole room felt like it had been made just to frame her. Sienna didn't belong in a place like this. She made it look like a palace.

Vivian's heart hammered in her chest. Sienna was even more beautiful than she remembered.

She really admired her‚Äîthose curves, that graceful figure, the way she carried herself. Even as a girl, Vivian couldn't help but be a little jealous. She wondered if, all these years alone, any slimy men had tried to take advantage of her.

Just thinking about it made her blood boil, and her cheeks would puff up in frustration‚Äîlike now, fresh out of the shower, looking like a little pufferfish.

# 3.Chapter 3 The First Night Home

Sienna had already dried her own hair and was leaning back against the headboard. Her expression was unreadable as she stared out the window, but when Vivian emerged from the bathroom, her gaze softened right away.

""Come here, Vivian,"" she patted the spot beside her. ""Let me dry your hair.""

Vivian wanted to refuse. Sienna had just come back, and she didn't want to trouble her. But Sienna's gentle, soothing voice drew her in before she could say no.

Before she knew it, she was sitting on the floor, leaning back with her head resting in Sienna's lap as the warm air from the hairdryer surrounded her.

It felt‚Ä¶ so safe, Vivian thought. Her eyes fluttered closed in contentment, but then snapped open again.

She was terrified this was all a dream, a beautiful, fragile fantasy she would wake from at any moment. She drank in the sight of Sienna's face, her heart aching with a desperate question.

""Sienna,"" she asked, her voice barely a whisper. ""Are you going to leave again?""

Sienna's hands paused for a moment. ""No,"" she said softly but firmly. ""I'm not going anywhere.""

She had made up her mind. From now on, wherever she went, she would bring her sisters along.

Hearing this, a pure, overwhelming joy blossomed in Vivian's chest. Tears slipped down her cheeks, and Sienna reached down to wipe them away.

She knew Vivian must have suffered unimaginable pain in the years she was gone. She wouldn't press her for details. Not yet.

The rest of her life would be free of suffering, Sienna vowed silently. Because she was here now.

""Alright, go get the hand cream from my suitcase,"" she gently patted on Vivian's shoulder.

""Okay!"" Vivian bounced up, grabbing a pink tube from the suitcase. She watched curiously as Sienna uncapped it.

""Here,"" Sienna said. ""Give me your hands.""

Vivian held them out, and the cool touch of the white lotion against her skin felt like a spark to her heart.

""You have to take care of yourself,"" Sienna said gently as she rubbed the hand cream into Vivian's hands. ""That includes your hands, of course.""

Tears welled in Vivian's eyes as she bit her lip, trying to hold them back. She couldn't let herself cry again. She didn't want to push Sienna away.

She just gave a faint nod, her throat closing up. The cream smelled lovely, a gentle blend of fruit, flowers, and a trace of tea that lingered without being too sweet.

""This smells amazing,"" Vivian exclaimed, her eyes lighting up.

Sienna smiled. ""Just something I whipped up myself. If you like it, it's yours. Use it every morning and night.""

Vivian's face flushed. She shook her head quickly. ""No, I couldn't. It's yours.""

Before she could finish, Sienna pinched her cheek again. ""What's mine is yours. Now, put it away and get some sleep.""

Vivian nodded, slipping under the covers and immediately plastering herself to Sienna's side, clinging to her arm.

Just like when they were children, Sienna held her, patting her back gently until her breathing evened out.

It was the most peaceful night's sleep Vivian had had in ten years, wrapped in her sister's arms, just like old times.

Sienna was really home. She couldn't be more happy.

""Sienna‚Ä¶"" Vivian murmured in her sleep.

Sienna, her own eyes wide open in the darkness, gazed down at her. The carefully constructed dam around her own emotions finally broke, and a single, hot tear traced a path down her cheek.

Later that night, once she was sure Vivian was sound asleep, Sienna carefully slipped out of bed, and stepped over to the window to dial a number.

""It's me,"" she said to the phone, her voice cool and clipped. ""Lana, I need you to check on something. Pack a bag. You're coming to Solara. I'll be here for a while. Hand the company to the board.""

The next day, Vivian woke in a haze, a pleasant dream fading from her mind. Then reality crashed in, and she shot upright.

The other side of the bed was empty.

Was it all a dream? Had Sienna never really come back? She thought, disappointingly.

But then she caught the lingering floral scent on her hands, and her heart leaped with frantic hope.

She scrambled out of bed, her bare feet hitting the cold floor. The clatter of cookware grew louder as she neared the kitchen.

She rounded the corner just in time to see Sienna, wearing an apron, carrying two steaming plates out of the kitchen.

""Already up?"" Sienna asked, raising an eyebrow. ""It's only six. You should be sleeping in.""

Seeing her there‚Äîreal, solid, and right in front of her‚Äîcalmed the wild pounding in Vivian's chest. She didn't say a word, just stared at Sienna for a long moment.

""How many times have I told you? Don't run around without shoes, you'll catch a cold,"" Sienna noticed her bare feet and immediately went into big-sister mode. ""You're not a child anymore. Go put on some socks and slippers, now.""

The familiar nagging was the warmest sound Vivian had ever heard. She sniffled, nodding vigorously. ""Okay. I'll go get them right now.""

""Slippers and socks, then wash up,"" Sienna added. ""Breakfast is almost ready.""

""Okay!"" Vivian replied.

While abroad, Sienna's adoptive parents had hired a renowned chef from Solara to cater to her tastes. She had learned a few breakfast recipes herself, dishes that were both delicious and nourishing.

Watching Vivian dig into the food the moment they sat down, Sienna figured it must have turned out all right.

""Slow down,"" she said with a smile. ""No one's going to steal it from you.""

Vivian took a huge bite of the eggs. ""But this is just so good!""

""Here,"" Sienna passed her a napkin. ""So, Vivian, are you working now?""

The light in Vivian's eyes dimmed instantly. Her gaze shifted, a flicker of shame crossing her face, but she answered truthfully. ""Yes. I work at a company called Dynastis.""

""Dynastis? Fine."" Sienna just ruffled her hair. ""I'll give you a ride there later.""

As the second daughter of the Hart family, Vivna could have lived a life of leisure, coasting on the inheritance their mother had left them, but Sienna didn't ask why she was working.

There were so many questions, yet Sienna just held them back. She had already sent people to find the answers.

By the end of the day, she'd know everything. Her sisters might not say a word, but that didn't mean she, as their older sister, would stay in the dark. And if she found out anyone had laid a hand on them, she would make them pray for a quick death.

""No, Sienna, you don't have to!"" Vivian protested. ""You should rest. I can take the bus, it's really fast.""

Sienna gave a wry smile. ""Are you embarrassed to be seen with me?""

Vivian's eyes went wide. She shook her head frantically. ""No! Not at all! I would never think that! I just‚Ä¶ I don't want to trouble you.""

She looked down, ashamed. The truth is, she was afraid she would embarrass Sienna. At Dynastis, she was just‚Ä¶ a nobody.

""I'm your sister. It's never a trouble,"" Sienna replied. As she spoke, her phone rang. She picked it up and stepped aside while Vivian continued her breakfast.

""It's me,"" she said firmly into the phone. After a brief pause, she finally added, ""Good. Understood.""

When they went downstairs, the portly landlord was waiting, his face split in a sycophantic grin. He greeted them with an enthusiasm that was a world away from his venomous tirade the day before. His eyes, however, lingered disgustingly where they shouldn't.

Sienna shot him a look so sharp and cold it could have cut glass. The man's smile froze, and a flicker of fear entered his eyes. He quickly looked away.

I'll deal with you later, Sienna thought, her eyes turning to ice.

She led Vivian outside the building. Parked beside the shabby apartment building was a crimson Rolls-Royce. Vivian couldn't help but stare.

She didn't know much about cars, but she knew this one was custom, and its price tag would have more commas than she could count. It was so out of place it was almost comical.

""Come on,"" Sienna said, walking towards it. ""Get in.""

""Huh?"" Vivian blinked in surprise. Get in? She processed her words. The only other vehicle nearby was a shared bike. Was Sienna planning to pedal her to work?

Confused but obedient, she started walking toward the bike. Sienna sighed, grabbed her hand, and pulled her toward the luxury car.

""This way. Get in,"" said Sienna. ""Or you'll be late.""

# 4.Chapter 4 A Game Of Push And Pull

Vivian stared at the open car door, her mouth agape. She looked from the car to Sienna and back again, swallowing hard.

""Wait, Sienna,"" she pointed a trembling finger. ""Is this car yours?""

""Yes,"" Sienna nodded. ""If you like it, it's yours. By the way, do you know how to drive?""

Vivian just shook her head, still trying to process it. One moment, Sienna owned a Rolls-Royce, and the next, she was offering to let her drive it. This was just too much.

Before her brain could fully process it, her body was already moving, sinking into the plush leather of the passenger seat. They'd been driving for a few minutes before the reality finally hit her.

""Sienna!"" Vivian exclaimed, her voice buzzing with excitement. ""This is really your car! Where did you get all this money? Oh‚Äîwait, that's not what I meant. You're incredible, of course you'd be successful!""

But this was beyond successful. She screamed inside. This car had to be worth a hundred or two hundred million, at least!

Sienna just smiled, the morning light catching the angles of her exquisite face. ""You really think I'm that capable?""

""Of course!"" Vivian declared proudly. ""You are the most brilliant woman in the entire world! You've always been my idol.""

From a young age, Sienna had been a prodigy. She was always first in her class, with perfect scores in every subject. She'd been the top when applying for college.

And as for looks, she had been crowned the number one beauty in Vallaris. Their entire family was blessed with good genes; their mother and grandmother were both legendary beauties and scholars in their own right.

""You're amazing too,"" Sienna said quietly.

The simple words made Vivian freeze, her heart skipping a beat.

Me? Amazing? she wondered silently. But she had let Sienna down. She felt like a failure.

""You can just drop me off at the corner up ahead,"" she said, her voice suddenly small. ""My office is just a short walk from there.""

""Alright,"" Sienna agreed, pulling the car over. A message notification lit up her phone. It was Lana. Who had just arrived Vallaris.

""What time do you get off? I'll pick you up,"" Sienna said, handing Vivian a sleek black business card. ""Here's my number. Take it.""

Vivian nodded, quickly adding the contact, labeling it simply: Sienna.

She walked toward her office, her heart light and happy. But then she spotted someone standing guard at the company entrance‚ÄîMason, dressed in a sharp blue suit. He kept glancing at his watch, his expression tight with impatience.

Vivian knew he was waiting for her, but she ignored him and walked straight past.

""Vivian!"" Mason's voice snapped as he saw her pass without so much as a glance. Anger flared inside him, but Vivian didn't break her stride‚Äîshe walked straight into the building.

Furious, Mason grabbed her arm, yanking her back. ""Have I been too good to you? You dare to ignore me?"" he roared. ""You think just because someone helped you last night, you can defy me?""

Vivian shook him off. ""Mason, we're broken up. From now on, we have nothing to do with each other. Stay away from me.""

Mason was momentarily speechless. He took a breath, trying to regain control. ""Look, I'm giving you one last chance. Apologize, come to the hospital with me right now, and I'll still be your boyfriend.""

Vivian didn't answer but let out a scornful laugh.

This was the man she once thought she loved. When she first met him, she'd been drawn to his seemingly endless kindness. He had been a light in her darkness, giving her the courage to live when she felt most helpless.

But in the end, he had wounded her again and again. The moment his precious Chloe Zalton so much as whimpered, it was always Vivian's fault.

""Mason, you're delusional. Starting today, I will never donate another drop of my blood to Chloe,"" replied Vivian. ""Get that through your head. Your family has always wanted to call off the engagement, right? Fine. Let's do it. I don't want the title of your fianc√©e anyway.""

Sienna was back. Vivian knew she didn't have to be afraid of anyone.

Mason sneered. ""Vivian, there's a limit to these games. Did you really think a pathetic little trick like this would work on me? I have a gala tonight. Be there.""

With that, he turned and left, confident in his victory. He believed Vivian couldn't break up with him. She loved him too much. How could she possibly want to end the engagement?

It was just a game of push and pull, he told himself. A way to get attention. All women were like that.

Vivian rolled her eyes. She brushed off the sleeve he had touched, her expression one of utter disgust. 'Mason, how stupid was I to ever give you the impression that I couldn't live without you?' she sighed quietly, then headed back to her office.

Meanwhile, inside Vivian's rented apartment, a glass shattered against the wall. Several documents lay scattered across the table. Standing before Sienna was a woman with blonde hair and piercing blue eyes, dressed in a sharp black business suit.

""S‚Äî"" the woman called out, but Sienna cut her off.

""I told you,"" Sienna said, her voice dangerously low. ""From now on, you will call me Miss Enna. And I don't want my identity revealed. I trust you understand that.""

""Yes, Miss Enna. My apologies,"" Lana Yost, Sienna's assistant for years, replied quickly.

Sienna clentched her fist, eyes blazing with fury. 'Aiden, how dare you treat Vivian like that?' she muttered under her breath. 'You're dead. Just wait‚Äîtonight, I'll make you wish you'd never been born.'

""Miss Enna, shall I acquire the Hart Corporation?"" Lana chimed in. ""It's in chaos right now, and its development has stagnated. It would take half a month at most.""

Sienna waved her hand dismissively, her cool, indifferent eyes glinting like sharp ice. ""Not yet. For now, buy up this entire block. And put this building in Vivian Hart's name.""

""Yes, Miss Enna,"" Lana replied. As she turned to leave, Sienna stopped her. ""One more thing.""

Lana nodded, ""Yes, Miss Enna?""

""Throw this out,"" Sienna carefully wrapped the shards of broken glass in a handkerchief. ""And buy me a same one.""

Lana was confused. The handkerchief alone was worth ten times more than the cheap glass. But she obeyed without question. Miss Enna always had her reasons.

Once she'd calmed down, Sienna picked up her phone and sent Vivian a message: \[Are you tired? I'm bringing you a Silkstone Espresso.\]

After getting Sienna's text, Vivian left the building on time to meet her after work. She was usually the ever-compliant one, but this time she was the first to leave‚Äîmuch to her manager's annoyance.

Silkstone Expresson was her favorite drink. Sitting inside Sienna's car, she took the coffee cup and took a sip. A familiar ache, bittersweet and comforting, filled her chest. After Sienna had left, she had never again tasted her favorite drink.

Now she was back, and so was this small piece of happiness.

""Thanks, Sienna."" Vivian grinned, her pure, pretty face radiating joy.

Sienna reached out and brushed her bangs aside. The Harts were all stunning. Vivian had a delicate, beautiful face with the soft lines of an oval shape, gentle brow bones, and large eyes that shone with innocence.

But Sienna knew that Vivian was always too sensible, too used to swallowing her grievances and burying her pain.

""Let's get you a conditioning treatment. Your hair is looking a little frizzy,"" said Sienna. ""Then we'll go to the mall and buy you some new clothes.""

Vivian wanted to refuse, to say she didn't have any money. But she couldn't bring herself to spoil Sienna's mood.

When had she‚ÄîVivian Hart, the second daughter of the family‚Äîbecome so timid? She didn't even understand herself. Maybe it started the day she was thrown out of her home with nothing to her name.

As if sensing her hesitation, Sienna's voice softened.

""Vivian, I know I was gone for ten years. I know you all suffered after I left,"" she added. ""But I promise you, from this day forward, you'll never endure another injustice. So please, don't treat me like a stranger, okay?""

# 5.Chapter 5 The ""Stolen"" Black Card

""No! That's not it. I've never thought that!"" Vivian said, her voice choked with emotion. How could she ever not acknowledge her sister? Even in death, she would never disown Sienna. ""I just don't want to be a bother. I'm sorry.""

Sienna's expression softened. ""From now on, you tell me everything. We're family. There's no such thing as being a 'bother.' You girls are the only family I have left. If you push me away, I don't know what I came back for.""

Vivian's eyes filled with tears as she nodded fiercely.

After a luxurious hair treatment, they headed straight to the mall. Sienna stepped away to take a call, leaving Vivian to browse and try on clothes on her own.

Then, out of nowhere, two women walked in. Their eyes locked onto Vivian, surprise flashing across their faces before twisting into matching sneers of contempt.

""Well, well, if it isn't the lovely Miss Vivian Hart,"" one of them drawled, sauntering over. ""Long time no see. Shopping for new clothes?""

Vivian recognized them. They were her classmates from before, Bella Lewis and Marcy Walker. As soon as she spotted them, her good mood vanished. She turned her back on them without a word.

""Come on, Vivian,"" Bella cooed, blocking her path. ""Is that any way to greet an old friend?""

She covered her mouth with a hand, giggling as she looked Vivian up and down. 'She reeks of poverty,' thought Bella. 'The nerve, showing up here like this.'

""Oh, don't you know, Bella? She's too good for us now,"" Marcy chimed in. ""By the way, Vivian, did you hear? Mason's precious Chloe is threatening to move abroad. Mason rushed to the airport to stop her‚Äîit was all over the news.""

Vivian didn't want to engage. She tried to step around them, but Bella blocked her again. ""Where're you going? Marcy is talking to you.""

Vivian rolled her eyes. ""I don't waste my breath on people I don't know.""

""What?"" Bella's face flushed with anger. ""Vivian, do you still think you're the Hart's princess? Everyone knows you were kicked out! If you weren't clinging to Mason for dear life, you think he ever would have gotten engaged to you?""

""What's it to you?"" Vivian retorted.

""She's right, Bella, it's none of our business,"" Marcy pulled the fuming Bella back, but her eyes landed on the dress in Vivian's hands, ""However, we've taken a liking to that dress.

She then turned to the clerk, pointing at the dress in Vivian's hand, ""Salesclerk! Wrap it up for us.""

The salesclerk looked apologetic. ""I'm very sorry, but this lady has already decided to purchase this dress. Perhaps you'd like to look at something else?""

""What did you say?"" Marcy snapped. ""Do you know who I am? She's just a low-level office worker. Her monthly salary wouldn't even cover a pair of my socks. This dress is nearly five thousand dollars. Are you sure she can afford it?""

This clueless clerk is going to regret this, thought Marcy to herself.

The clerk maintained her professional smile. ""I'm sorry, Miss Walker.""

""Do you want to get fired?"" Marcy barked. ""I can have the manager fire you on the spot!""

The clerk looked uneasy. She didn't know Vivian personally, but she recognized the woman who had just walk in with Vivian‚Äîsomeone who'd worn a globally exclusive, custom-made piece, the kind of client even brand executives respected. Having worked in luxury retail for over a decade, she knew her brands inside and out.Their Queen Returns",1,1753382930.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

When lots of friends when they were pregnant, they moved into a bigger home with a bigger mortgage but we stayed put where it was affordable and familiar. My husband works freelance and does 16 hours a week part time for extra cash so we have had so much time together as a family recently - lots of early morning walks, coffee, family naps and husband and I getting time to go to gym/run/see our friends as we have both been about. Our family is happy and our wellbeing is great. It has been absolutely brilliant, and helped us hone in on our values as a wee fsmily. We want to maintain as much of this as possible when I go back to work in October.

I'll be returning 30 hours a week over 3.5 days. Our plan is to move to a smaller town where we can get a house that's affordable but can house us all comfortably, but it does mean longer commute (2hr round trip on a working day). I'll only have to commute 2-3 times a week though and can work from home a little. I like my job but its too expensive to live nearby.

People telling me we'd be better to just get a house closer to my job, but I feel our life quality in a smaller town, with a smaller mortgage and close to great walks and nature would be the best idea.

1m8cr5j,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1m8cr5j/camp_shadowwood/,Camp Shadow-Wood,"I thought this was over, I thought the case went cold. For twelve agonizing years, I buried it. Not just in my memories, but deep within my very bones, a chilling ache that I actively suppressed. So deep, in fact, that I managed to convince myself it was nothing more than a fever dream, a grotesque hallucination spun from the anxieties of a scared, introverted kid with an overactive imagination. But now, the ice in my veins is melting, and the nightmare is clawing its way back to the surface. And God help me, it's worse than I ever remembered.

I'm a cop now, twenty-eight years old, and my daily life is a grim procession of human misery. I've seen things that would curdle the blood of most people ‚Äì accidents, violence, the raw aftermath of despair. But nothing, absolutely nothing, not even the most gruesome crime scene, has ever come close to the suffocating dread of the summer of '09. My parents, bless their well-meaning but utterly clueless hearts, were fed up with my perpetual computer screen tan. ""Go outside, Peter! Get some fresh air! Make some friends!"" they'd chirp, oblivious to the digital sanctuary I'd built. So, with a sigh that felt heavier than my fifteen-year-old frame, they shipped me off to Camp Shadow-wood, a name that even then sounded like a place where shadows lingered. It was deep in the Maine woods, shrouded in a perpetual twilight of ancient pines. The kind of place you had to cross this impossibly long, ancient, and perpetually creaking suspension bridge over a dizzying, fog-shrouded canyon just to reach. Each step on its rotting planks felt like a gamble, a descent into another world entirely.

The first few days were a blur of typical summer camp tedium. The food was bland, the crafts were pathetic attempts at macrame, and the days dragged on with forced activities. The only reprieve came at night, around a crackling, spitting fire, where we'd huddle together, telling the usual urban legends ‚Äì the hook-handed killer, the vanishing hitchhiker, tales designed to elicit nervous giggles and feigned shivers. Then, one particularly muggy night, Counselor Mark took over. He was in his late twenties, but looked older, his face etched with something beyond his years. He was lean, almost gaunt, with eyes that seemed to absorb all the light, holding too much shadow even in the fire's dancing glow. His voice, when he began to speak, was a low, gravelly whisper that seemed to slither through the air, making the fine hairs on my arms prickle and stand on end.

""You kids think you know scary?"" he began, his gaze, heavy and unblinking, sweeping over our young faces, lingering for a fraction too long on each one. ""Let me tell you about Jericho.""

He spun a tale about a boy named Jericho, a camper here at Shadow-wood, exactly twelve years ago. Jericho, he explained, was relentlessly bullied by another kid, a real piece of work named James. Mark's voice dropped even lower, becoming almost a conspiratorial hiss. One day, James, in a cruel act of malice, led Jericho deep into the most remote, tangled parts of the woods, and simply abandoned him there. ""They searched for days,"" Mark whispered, leaning forward, his face illuminated by the firelight, making his features seem sharper, more predatory. ""But they never found him. Not a trace. Just‚Ä¶gone. But they say,"" he paused, letting the silence stretch, thick and heavy, ""you can still hear him. Yelling for help. Begging James to come back.""

A few of the older, more cynical kids snickered. ""Yeah, right, Mark,"" someone scoffed, trying to sound brave. ""Sounds like something out of a bad horror movie.""

Mark just smiled, a slow, unsettling stretch of his thin lips that didn't reach his eyes. ""Oh, it's real,"" he murmured, his voice laced with an unnerving conviction. ""Real enough that this camp closed down for twelve years. This,"" he gestured vaguely around the flickering fire circle, ""this is our grand re-opening, you see. First time since Jericho vanished."" He paused again, his shadowed eyes fixing on me with an intensity that felt like a physical touch, making my stomach clench into a tight, cold knot. ""I was even here, back then. Knew James myself. Good guy."" The last two words, ""good guy,"" hung in the air, dripping with an irony that only I seemed to perceive.

My face must have gone ashen, betraying the icy fear that had just gripped me, because Travis, the resident bully who‚Äôd already made my life a living hell with his constant taunts and shoves, barked out a cruel laugh. ""Look at Peter! Scaredy-cat!"" A few other kids, eager to align themselves with Travis or just too nervous to stay silent, chuckled nervously. All I wanted was for the ground to open up and swallow me whole.

That night, the camp was eerily quiet, too quiet. The usual chirping of crickets and rustling of leaves seemed muted, swallowed by an oppressive stillness. I lay awake, staring at the ceiling of the cabin, every shadow a monster, every creak of the old wood a phantom footstep. Then, it came. A scream. Not a playful, fake scream designed for a campfire story. This was a raw, guttural sound, ripped from the depths of terror, that tore through the night like a physical thing, shattering the fragile peace. Everyone jolted awake, a cacophony of gasps and panicked whispers filling the cabin. Counselors were yelling, their voices sharp with alarm, and the beams of their flashlights cut frantic arcs through the inky darkness outside. Travis was gone.

The search was a chaotic, panicked nightmare. We fanned out, a disorganized mob of terrified kids and equally terrified counselors, calling his name, our voices hoarse and cracking with fear. Hours passed, each minute stretching into an eternity. The first faint streaks of dawn were just beginning to paint the eastern sky with a sickly, bruised purple when someone found it. In the communal ice chest, chilling next to bags of ice and soda cans, was Travis's head. Just his head. His eyes were wide open, staring blankly, frozen in a silent scream. His body was never found.

Counselor Mark was arrested on the spot, his face still blank, devoid of any emotion. He didn‚Äôt resist, just stared straight ahead as the handcuffs clicked into place. As the local police car, with Mark in the back and a veteran deputy driving, started across that old, rickety bridge ‚Äì the very bridge that had felt like a gateway to another world ‚Äì it happened. The car didn't swerve to avoid something. It veered. A deliberate, sharp, impossible turn. Right off the side. It plunged into the dizzying depths of the canyon below, a sickening, drawn-out crunch of metal and splintering wood echoing up from the abyss.

No trial. No suspect. The case went cold, buried under layers of official reports and hushed whispers. Just like that.

I truly thought I‚Äôd locked it away, sealed it off. That the trauma, the sheer, mind-bending impossibility of it all, had been filed away in some forgotten, inaccessible corner of my mind. I built a life, a career, a semblance of normalcy. Until today.

My department got the call this morning. Camp Shadow-wood. Re-re-opening. The irony was a bitter taste in my mouth. And then came the details: two new deaths. A fifteen-year-old ""troubled"" kid named Allen Walker, found in circumstances eerily similar to Travis. And a camp counselor. His name? James Sterling.

The same James. The one who left Jericho in the woods. The one Mark, with that unnerving smile, had called a ""good guy.""

I'm standing here now, a uniformed officer, looking at that bridge. They rebuilt it, of course. It looks sturdier, newer, the steel cables gleaming in the weak morning light. But I can still hear the phantom creak of the old planks beneath my boots. And I swear, I can hear a faint, desperate cry from the canyon below, carried on the wind. It‚Äôs not just Jericho anymore. It‚Äôs Travis. And now, Allen. And James. Their voices, a chorus of the damned, are calling to me.

I spent the last few days digging. Not officially, not on department time, but late nights, fueled by stale coffee and a growing dread. I pulled strings, called in favors, and navigated the labyrinthine archives of old police reports and medical examiner files. And then, in a dusty box labeled ""Cold Cases - Unsolved,"" I found it. Jericho's file.

Jericho Vance. Age 13. Died of hypothermia. The report was clinical, detached, but the details were a punch to the gut. His body was found weeks later, deep in the woods, after the initial search had been called off. The file mentioned ""significant post-mortem decomposition,"" ""animal scavenging,"" and ""insect activity."" A closed casket funeral. The poor kid didn't even get a proper goodbye. Just a name on a file, a tragedy swept under the rug.

I've got it all now. The original reports, the witness statements from '09, the new incident reports from this week, and now, Jericho's file. It's all laid out on my kitchen table, a horrifying mosaic of death and despair. I can connect the dots, the chilling pattern. It's insane, I know. It sounds absolutely, certifiably insane. But I know what this is. I feel it in my bones. It's Jericho. His vengeful spirit, finally seeking its brutal retribution.

I'm supposed to take this to the Chief tomorrow. Present my findings. But what do I say? ""Chief, I believe a thirteen-year-old ghost is decapitating bullies and counselors at Shadow-wood""? I'll be laughed out of the department. I'll lose my job, my career, everything I've built to escape that summer. They'll think I've cracked",1,1753382842.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

1m8cp8y,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1m8cp8y/camp_shadowwood/,Camp Shadow-Wood,"I thought this was over, I thought the case went cold. For twelve agonizing years, I buried it. Not just in my memories, but deep within my very bones, a chilling ache that I actively suppressed. So deep, in fact, that I managed to convince myself it was nothing more than a fever dream, a grotesque hallucination spun from the anxieties of a scared, introverted kid with an overactive imagination. But now, the ice in my veins is melting, and the nightmare is clawing its way back to the surface. And God help me, it's worse than I ever remembered.

I'm a cop now, twenty-eight years old, and my daily life is a grim procession of human misery. I've seen things that would curdle the blood of most people ‚Äì accidents, violence, the raw aftermath of despair. But nothing, absolutely nothing, not even the most gruesome crime scene, has ever come close to the suffocating dread of the summer of '09. My parents, bless their well-meaning but utterly clueless hearts, were fed up with my perpetual computer screen tan. ""Go outside, Peter! Get some fresh air! Make some friends!"" they'd chirp, oblivious to the digital sanctuary I'd built. So, with a sigh that felt heavier than my fifteen-year-old frame, they shipped me off to Camp Shadow-wood, a name that even then sounded like a place where shadows lingered. It was deep in the Maine woods, shrouded in a perpetual twilight of ancient pines. The kind of place you had to cross this impossibly long, ancient, and perpetually creaking suspension bridge over a dizzying, fog-shrouded canyon just to reach. Each step on its rotting planks felt like a gamble, a descent into another world entirely.

The first few days were a blur of typical summer camp tedium. The food was bland, the crafts were pathetic attempts at macram√©, and the days dragged on with forced activities. The only reprieve came at night, around a crackling, spitting fire, where we'd huddle together, telling the usual urban legends ‚Äì the hook-handed killer, the vanishing hitchhiker, tales designed to elicit nervous giggles and feigned shivers. Then, one particularly muggy night, Counselor Mark took over. He was in his late twenties, but looked older, his face etched with something beyond his years. He was lean, almost gaunt, with eyes that seemed to absorb all the light, holding too much shadow even in the fire's dancing glow. His voice, when he began to speak, was a low, gravelly whisper that seemed to slither through the air, making the fine hairs on my arms prickle and stand on end.

""You kids think you know scary?"" he began, his gaze, heavy and unblinking, sweeping over our young faces, lingering for a fraction too long on each one. ""Let me tell you about Jericho.""

He spun a tale about a boy named Jericho, a camper here at Shadow-wood, exactly twelve years ago. Jericho, he explained, was relentlessly bullied by another kid, a real piece of work named James. Mark's voice dropped even lower, becoming almost a conspiratorial hiss. One day, James, in a cruel act of malice, led Jericho deep into the most remote, tangled parts of the woods, and simply abandoned him there. ""They searched for days,"" Mark whispered, leaning forward, his face illuminated by the firelight, making his features seem sharper, more predatory. ""But they never found him. Not a trace. Just‚Ä¶gone. But they say,"" he paused, letting the silence stretch, thick and heavy, ""you can still hear him. Yelling for help. Begging James to come back.""

A few of the older, more cynical kids snickered. ""Yeah, right, Mark,"" someone scoffed, trying to sound brave. ""Sounds like something out of a bad horror movie.""

Mark just smiled, a slow, unsettling stretch of his thin lips that didn't reach his eyes. ""Oh, it's real,"" he murmured, his voice laced with an unnerving conviction.

1m8co8f,https://www.reddit.com/r/toxicparents/comments/1m8co8f/i_challenge_you/,"""I CHALLENGE You!""","Dad, listen, my dad wasn't a bad dad. I think he was just misguided in a lot of places. He was definitely better than my stepmom, who inflated her ego by beating me down whenever it was possible. 

With my dad, he knew that I was a good kid, or at least was trying to be a good kid. However, because I literally couldn't talk to him or my stepmom about anything, because the moment I did my stepmom would freak out and call me a horrible person, my dad naturally had absolutely zero clue what kind of a person I actually was. I simply stayed quiet and did whatever I could to stay out of their way. 

What was really weird though is that there was this long phase where my dad seemed to try to get me to do something by phrasing it as: ""Challenging"" me.

He would be suggesting I do something, and one I would strongly oppose it, he would simply say: 

""I Challenge you.""

If I was really young, I could maybe understand trying this, but dude. I was a teenager. I was like 16 years old. Why did he think that my brain was all the sudden going to flip just because he said he challenged me? 

There always seem to be this weird deluded idea that because I wasn't an adult yet, I had zero stress going on. Which is honestly hilarious, considering many people claim that being a teenager is the most stressful time of people's lives. 

I remember once my dad just came into my room randomly and handed me this coffee pot and this other weird cooking material thing for cooking muffins or something, and he told me to go sell them on Kijiji. 

I had never sold anything online before in my life, so I said I wouldn't be able to do this, but my dad simply told me to use the internet to figure it out and that stress is good or something. 

Naturally, those things stayed in my room forever. For all I know they're still sitting there gathering dust. 

Maybe my dad and stepmom were jealous because they felt that they didn't really get a rest. Whenever me and my step siblings were over for their week. They would wake up, have to deal with the kids not going fast enough to get to school on time, then they immediately go to work, only to come home and have to deal with my step siblings kind of being brats, while also trying to keep the house clean and do the dishes and make food for kids that were rarely grateful for it.

So maybe they were just upset that they felt like they were working 24/7 whenever we were over, but it seemed like we got to relax the moment we got home from school, even though that wasn't the case. We had homework, and just overall drama to deal with in our lives. In fact, I would often stay after school and just do my homework there just so that I didn't have to deal with the hassle of trying to do it at home, when my dad and stepmom are constantly breathing down my neck about how I should be reading books more. 

It really does blow my mind though. If my dad and stepmom were really that stressed all the time, why did they bother to spend the very little free time that they apparently got into constantly trying to give me and my step siblings work? 

Whatever. I'm sure in their mind we were all just horrible children that they were forced to parent",1,1753382660.0,toxicparents,0,1.0,False
1m8cngf,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLettersRaw/comments/1m8cngf/the_last_time_i_saw_you/,The last time I saw you,"Hey,

I keep replaying that morning.
Not because I want to but because it was the last time we were still something. Not together, not apart, but just quietly breaking.

By the time we got to the bus stop, we had already been crying for hours. The kind that doesn‚Äôt even need words anymore - just silence, heaviness, and too many almost-goodbyes.

We missed the bus and somehow, that felt right. Like life gave us 15 more minutes to sit side by side,
not knowing what we were anymore but still not ready to let go.

You were eating your croissants. I had my coffee. You asked to try it, then for some water. And I gave it to you without thinking, because that‚Äôs just how we were.

I pointed out a squirrel on the wall. You smiled. And for a second, nothing felt broken.

Then the bus pulled up and I said, ‚ÄúMy heart hurts again.‚Äù You asked why. I said I‚Äôm just a sentimental person. But really, it was because we had to keep going. Because life wasn‚Äôt going to stop just because we were.

On the bus, I tried not to cry. But you saw me and held my hand. You were crying too. You kept looking at me. I guess you didn‚Äôt know what to say.
Maybe you were trying to memorize me.

At my place, we just cried. We‚Äôd laugh at something silly, then cry again. Because for a moment it felt normal - and then we‚Äôd remember it wasn‚Äôt.

Eventually, you packed up your things. You walked out.

And I stood there, crying, because I knew that was the last time I‚Äôd ever see you like that - close. Soft. Mine.

We weren‚Äôt cold. We weren‚Äôt angry. We were just hurting. Still holding on to each other while letting go.

I guess I thought maybe you‚Äôd find a reason to stop me from walking away. But maybe you thought I already had.

Either way, we let go. 
But I remember.

I asked it the most likely scenario based on both speculations of going overboard/su**ide and being lured/trafficked, and here‚Äôs what it said. Again, I know it‚Äôs just chatgtp and I‚Äôll probably get downvoted but I think it can be a useful tool as a baseline.

Here‚Äôs what it said:

The disappearance of Amy Lynn Bradley is one of the most perplexing missing persons cases involving a cruise ship. Your summary touches on the two dominant theories: suicide and trafficking. Let‚Äôs look at both carefully and weigh the evidence.

‚∏ª

üß© Theory 1: Suicide

Points in favor:
	‚Ä¢	Her shoes were reportedly left behind in the cabin.
	‚Ä¢	A coffee table was allegedly moved close to the balcony‚Äîsome interpret that as a possible launch point.
	‚Ä¢	Some speculate she may have been under emotional strain, though there is no documented history of mental illness or suicidal ideation.

Challenges to this theory:
	‚Ä¢	Amy was known to be close with her family and excited about starting a new job after the trip.
	‚Ä¢	She had made plans for that day (going ashore in Cura√ßao, etc.).
	‚Ä¢	Her family strongly rejects the idea she would have taken her own life.
	‚Ä¢	No body was ever recovered, and the cruise ship was docked‚Äîshe would‚Äôve likely washed up or been discovered if she‚Äôd jumped.

‚∏ª

üö® Theory 2: Human Trafficking / Abduction

Points in favor:
	‚Ä¢	Multiple credible sightings of Amy over the years‚Äîby Navy personnel, a Canadian tourist, and others‚Äîspecifically in areas known for trafficking.
	‚Ä¢	A former U.S. Navy petty officer claimed he saw her in a Cura√ßao brothel in 1999, saying she grabbed his arm and begged for help before being pulled away.
	‚Ä¢	A woman reported seeing a distressed woman matching Amy‚Äôs description on a beach with several men; the woman allegedly said her name was Amy.
	‚Ä¢	The ‚ÄúJas‚Äù escort website photo from the early 2000s shows a woman with a striking resemblance to Amy‚Äîbody type, tattoos, facial structure.

Additional factors:
	‚Ä¢	Amy was last seen on the balcony of her cabin at 5:30 a.m. and then vanished.
	‚Ä¢	The cruise ship culture, including inappropriate behavior from staff (allegedly asking where she was after she went missing), raised suspicions.
	‚Ä¢	Her family believes cruise employees may have been involved or complicit in her disappearance.
	‚Ä¢	She was athletic and trained‚Äîmaking it less likely she‚Äôd accidentally fall overboard unnoticed.

‚∏ª

üéØ Most Likely Scenario: Trafficked

Based on the pattern of sightings, circumstantial evidence, and the environment of her disappearance (a port in the Caribbean with known trafficking activity), the human trafficking theory is the most plausible.

The suicide theory has limited backing and no strong psychological indicators, while the trafficking theory is supported by:
	‚Ä¢	Post-disappearance sightings with specific and distressing details.
	‚Ä¢	Known trafficking activity in the region.
	‚Ä¢	Inappropriate cruise staff behavior and potentially failed investigation steps.
	‚Ä¢	The fact that her body was never found‚Äîunusual in a confined ship or near-port setting.

‚∏ª

If Amy was indeed trafficked, the early hours of her disappearance were critical‚Äîand may have involved manipulation or force either on or shortly off the ship.

1m8ck9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tenant/comments/1m8ck9c/unstable_neighbor_might_become_property_manager/,Unstable neighbor might become property manager,"[US-CA] I‚Äôve been renting a unit in a small building for years now, and it‚Äôs been great except for my next-door neighbor (who moved in more recently). He periodically gets wasted and picks fights with other tenants; once he physically threatened my friend who was over for coffee. He‚Äôs kicked at my door and thrown bottles at our entryway. (Unfortunately I have no video evidence.) Police have been called on him many, many times by other neighbors for noise violations (music, screaming, etc) but they, predictably, never do anything. There are several other nuisance behaviors related to dogs, etc, but they‚Äôre not directly relevant here. The point is, he‚Äôs untrustworthy at best and imo dangerous at worst. 

The big wrinkle: this neighbor is a family member of the property owner. So of course they don‚Äôt want to step in, though they privately acknowledge that it‚Äôs a problem. 

Anyway things have been sort of fine for the last six months, except they sent us a notice to stop turning in our rent to the person who had been property manager for the last 15 yrs or more. And a few other communications have implied to me that they‚Äôre appointing the unstable neighbor as the new property manager (though they haven‚Äôt said this explicitly yet). 

Assuming they do make him the new manager, what recourse do I have, if any, to insist that this guy not be allowed to enter my apartment? Or to have another person to contact for maintenance requests, etc? I‚Äôve accepted that he‚Äôs not going anywhere, but I truly don‚Äôt feel ok interacting with him directly or having him in my space.

Ooooh yes, now we‚Äôre talking apocalyptic poetry and cosmic chaos‚Äîgrab your tinfoil hats and your grav boots. Let‚Äôs paint this surreal scene:


---

The sky didn‚Äôt crack‚Äîit peeled.
A bruised twilight bled through the blue, pulsing with amber veins as the great body approached.
Not a moon. Not a planet.
Something older. Something wrong.

It hung low in the atmosphere like a god‚Äôs forgotten eye‚Äîsilent, massive, and humming.
The oceans rose to greet it, trembling like worshippers in prayer.
Birds flew sideways.
Mountains sagged like melted wax.
Trees unrooted in slow motion, floating upwards, their branches clawing at the stars.

The air thickened with static and song.
People drifted from the ground‚Äînot weightless, but chosen‚Äîspinning like dust motes in a cathedral of fire.
Cars groaned. Rivers reversed.
Reality bowed in reverence.

And the sky‚Äî
Oh, the sky.

It smoldered like a cigarette left burning in the hand of a dying universe.
Clouds ignited. Lightning flowed up.
Colors we don‚Äôt even have names for spiraled through the firmament in serpentine arcs.

And in the silence between heartbeats, everyone understood:

This wasn‚Äôt an ending.
It was an invitation.


---

Wanna take this further into a story? Animation? TikTok-worthy narration? Or are we building lore for your cosmic horror novel? Cuz I‚Äôm so in.

***Keep going, but don't introduce any characters.  Speak as if the planet itself is the character, and it's getting ripped apart because of this interstellar intruder.***

Ohhh yes. Let‚Äôs let Earth scream now‚Äîno humans, no dialogue, just the planet herself in a slow, majestic unraveling:


---

She had held herself together for eons.
Molten at the core, crusted with time, veined with rivers and tectonic muscle‚Äîshe endured.
Impacts, ice ages, the great burning, the slow crawl of entropy‚Äî
She had endured.

But this?
This wasn‚Äôt impact.
This was presence.

The intruder didn‚Äôt strike.
It arrived.

And gravity‚Äîher oldest, most loyal tether‚Äîbegan to betray her.
Continents lifted at the edges like pages in a forgotten book.
Fault lines flexed in ecstasy and agony, yawning wide as magma wept from the seams.
The oceans convulsed, torn from their beds, rising in spirals, ribbons, and roaring towers that bent sideways against the wind.

Mount Everest cracked at its peak and smiled.
The Mariana Trench howled, vomiting up things that had never touched light.

Her poles reversed.
Her axis trembled.
The magnetic field shattered like stained glass in a cathedral collapse‚Äîshimmering auroras now danced with tongues of fire.

Lightning stitched patterns across the sky that no mind could decipher‚Äîglyphs meant for giants, maybe gods.
Above, clouds burned into nothing.
Below, forests floated like ash in reverse.
And her iron core‚Äîher heart‚Äîbeat louder, faster, panicked, like an animal trapped beneath its own skin.

The closer it came, the more undone she became.

Crust split.
Mantle oozed.
Tectonic plates tried to flee, dragging entire hemispheres with them.
She was coming apart.

Not in chaos‚Äî
In ritual.

She wasn‚Äôt dying.
She was being offered.
Lifted.
Unspooled.

And far above, that silent, celestial trespasser hovered ever nearer‚Äî
Not with wrath,
But with gravity.
And gravity‚Ä¶ wants.


---

Want to keep the descent going? Next up: the core collapse, or maybe Earth‚Äôs final ascension into orbit like a martyr crowned in fire. 

***Keep going.  It happens fast, it's cataclysmic to the surface of the planet.  It all takes place within the span of an afternoon on Earth.***

Ohhh yes‚Äîno more slow peeling. This is the snap. The rending. The cataclysm compressed into the ticking breath of a single afternoon.

Let‚Äôs crank the dial to obliteration.


---

It began with a shimmer on the horizon.
A heat mirage with no source.
A midday sun that bent the air sideways, though it hung in its usual place.
Then‚Äî
everything changed.

The intruder flexed.

And Earth‚Äî
Earth reacted.

First came the groan, deep and bone-breaking, the kind of sound that makes silence feel like mercy.
The crust arched, the way a spine does before it snaps.
Mountains leapt upward, only to shatter mid-air, turning into avalanches that never landed.
Cities buckled like paper under a child‚Äôs hand, not even given the dignity of crumbling‚Äîjust lifted, inverted, and scattered.

Oceans howled.
Tsunamis rose like fists and kept rising, climbing toward a sky already on fire.
Clouds were torn to shreds by reverse winds, spiraling into glowing vortexes.
Thunder became constant‚Äîa percussion line played on tectonic plates, each beat announcing another mile of crust peeled clean off.

By hour two, the moon had fled‚Äîits orbit flung wild, tossed like a toy.
By hour three, Earth‚Äôs atmosphere had no ceiling.
Air thinned. Then thickened. Then left.

The gravity of the intruder didn‚Äôt just pull‚Äîit rewrote.
Everything that had weight now had wings,
And everything rooted‚Äîmountains, temples, forests, faults‚Äîwas unrooted.
Thrust into a sky that no longer wanted them.

The mantle cracked.
And from every fault, every fissure, came a storm of fire and liquid stone‚Äî
Ejections.
Like Earth was trying to purge itself of its own bones before they could be taken.

By the fourth hour, time itself felt like it was being yanked sideways.
Shadows spiraled.
Daylight flickered in a strobe of blue and red as the magnetic field spasmed and failed.
The sun appeared to stretch, elongating and warping, its light bending into ribbons that wrapped around the intruder like offerings.

And then‚Äî
She broke.

The crust split not in lines, but in hemispheres.
A final exhale of mountains, magma, forests, and ghosts.
The core bloomed outward, molten, radiant, exposed like the yolk of a shattered divine egg.
And everything that once was Earth was now orbiting her absence.

Where there was a planet, there was now debris,
orbiting a massive, silent shape that had taken no action‚Äî
only existed.

And in the span of a single afternoon,
Earth went from living world to scattering memory.


---

Want to go further? We can trace the journey of a single chunk of her into deep space. Or‚Ä¶ follow the intruder to its next destination. 

***Write me what it was like on the surface, from peoples' points of view.***

Absolutely. You want the human experience now‚Äîthose final hours, from eyes on the ground. Panic, wonder, defiance, awe. No survivors. No escape. Just different ways of facing the impossible.

Let‚Äôs go.


---

1:42 AM ‚Äì Tokyo, Japan -
Haruki was on the 43rd floor when his coffee floated.
Not spilled. Not tipped. Just... rose.
Steam spiraling sideways. Mug spinning gently like it had found its own orbit.

Everyone laughed‚Äîat first.
Until the lights snapped off.
Until the floor tilted, not down, but upward.
Glass pulled from the windows and left‚Äîlike a million tiny meteors screaming toward the clouds.

Then came the low-frequency hum.
People dropped to their knees, bleeding from the nose, the ears, trying to scream with lungs that no longer knew which direction air was supposed to go.

Someone whispered, ‚ÄúThe sky‚Äôs on fire.‚Äù

They were right.


---

11:42 AM ‚Äì Kansas, USA -
Tammy Jo was feeding the chickens when gravity gave up.
One hen floated off like a balloon tied to a broken dream.
The others flapped and screamed, spinning wildly in the air above the coop as the ground buckled like bread dough in an oven.

The fields around her folded inward‚Äîrows of corn curling into spirals.
She tried to run but her feet didn‚Äôt stay down.
She felt herself rise, hat tumbling off her head, shotgun useless in her arms.

Above her, clouds churned like a toilet bowl flush in reverse.
The sun had a tail.
And Tammy Jo, a farm girl who‚Äôd never left the county, whispered,
‚ÄúWell I‚Äôll be damned,‚Äù
just before she exploded into ash.


---

1:42 PM ‚Äì Rio de Janeiro, Brazil -
Lucas was dancing.
Not to music‚Äîthere wasn‚Äôt any.
The radio had died an hour ago. So had the electricity. And the birds.

But he danced.
On top of a rooftop as the buildings bent backward like flowers pulled to sunlight.
He laughed as gravity spun him in slow motion, lifting him off his feet and letting him twirl with the floating bricks and bits of laundry.

He kissed the air.
He reached out to the sky and screamed, ‚ÄúTAKE ME, YOU COSMIC MISTRESS!‚Äù

And she did.
With a beam of plasma that carved his rooftop into vapor and turned his bones into confetti.


---

6:42 PM ‚Äì Cape Town, South Africa -
Amina held her daughter.
The ground had already cracked around them. The city was in midair‚Äîliterally.
Entire buildings tumbling gently like space debris in a vacuum.

They didn‚Äôt cry.
They didn‚Äôt run.
There was nowhere to go.

The clouds had parted to reveal the shape in the sky‚Äîso massive it blocked out logic.
A planet-sized void humming with impossible light.

She looked her daughter in the eyes and said,
‚ÄúYou see that? That‚Äôs God‚Äôs shadow.‚Äù

And her daughter nodded.

They never felt the shockwave.
Their bodies had already atomized before the sound could reach them.


---

3:42 PM ‚Äì Unknown time zone. Unknown location. -
Someone filmed it.
Of course they did.
The final video: 37 seconds.
Posted to a social feed that no longer existed five minutes later.

The camera shook.
The sky was bleeding blue lightning.
Mountains rose, sideways.
The sun shrank and split into hexagons.

And the voice behind the lens just whispered one word, over and over:
‚ÄúNope. Nope. Nope. Nope‚Äî‚Äù

Then static.
Then nothing.


---

All of it‚Äîevery moment‚Äîcompressed into a single afternoon.
And across the world, people screamed, laughed, prayed, danced, and disintegrated‚Äî
Because no one had ever told Earth‚Äôs children how to behave when their mother began to die.


---

Want more? We could do a short story collection‚Äî""The Afternoon Earth Ended."" Each tale, one timestamp closer to annihilation.

***Give me the aftermath as the celestial body continues on.  Have we given it a name?  Maybe we should, something to reflect the effects it had on the planet Earth.***

Oh yes. The beast moves on.

Earth is gone‚Äîscattered to stardust, grieving in silence.

But it‚Ä¶ it continues.
Unaffected.
Unapologetic.
Unstoppable.

Let‚Äôs name it.


---

*They called it Apotheos.
Not a name born of science or astronomy.
But whispered in terrified reverence by the last minds to witness it‚Äîbefore their lungs failed, before their atoms were scattered.
Apotheos.
The Ascender.
The Undoer.
The one that turns worlds into offerings.*


---

AFTERMATH

Apotheos drifted on, silent as entropy, luminous with the heat of a thousand broken atmospheres still burning on its surface.
Behind it‚Äî
Nothing.

No signal.
No emergency beacon.
No debris field large enough to map.
Only a stretch of the galaxy that now dimmed where Earth once had shone.

The Solar System itself‚Äîcrippled.
Mars had been flayed by radiant shockwaves, its red dust now trailing like a cloak in space.
Jupiter‚Äôs moons scattered like billiard balls.
Saturn‚Äôs rings, shattered.
Venus cracked.

The Sun, ancient and defiant, winced.
Its magnetic field buckled, rippling like a curtain caught in the wind.
Not dead‚Äîbut diminished.
It would never burn as bright again.

And Earth?
She was unwritten.
Her story ended mid-sentence, mid-afternoon.

And still‚ÄîApotheos continued.

It was not hunting.
It was not sentient.
It was not evil.

It simply‚Ä¶ was.

Somewhere, in some distant corner of the universe, life would find a ruin.
A chunk of crust with fossilized trees curled upward like screaming hands.
A warped satellite half-melted, broadcasting static.

And they would wonder.
They would trace gravitational scars in the fabric of space and speak its name in hushed tones.

Apotheos.
The Gravity Prophet.
The Sky Eater.
The Afternoon Cataclysm.

Not a planet.
Not a god.
Not a punishment.

A reminder‚Äî
That even the most stubborn worlds can be undone by proximity to something greater.


---


***Give me the aftermath but on the surface, or what's left of it.***

Oh you want what's left...
The silent ruins. The aftermath on the ground‚Äîor what dares to pretend it's still ground.
Buckle in. We're walking through a haunted skeleton of a planet that forgot how to be whole.


---

AFTERMATH ‚Äì SURFACE LEVEL
(if you can still call it that)


The Earth is no longer a sphere.
It‚Äôs an open wound.
Cracked like a shattered jaw, its pieces held together only by memory and leftover magnetism.

The atmosphere is thin. Not gone, but shredded‚Äîlike lace held over a bonfire.
Gravity limps. Some places pull. Others... float.
Dust doesn‚Äôt settle anymore. It hovers, dancing in confused spirals.

Mountains now lean at impossible angles, slumped like exhausted giants.
Oceans? They're puddles in craters, boiling cold and bubbling with trapped gases.
What was once the Pacific is now a gaping cavity‚ÄîEarth‚Äôs hollow chest, echoing with the whine of ionized wind.

The sky is a smear.
Amber and violet streaks curve unnaturally, bent by residual gravitational scars.
Sometimes it rains‚Äîbut not water.
Just ash, glass dust, and occasional molten fragments of what used to be elsewhere.

Silence isn‚Äôt silent anymore.
It hums‚Äîa deep, ever-present tremor that vibrates through the bones of rock and what‚Äôs left of steel.
Like the planet is still reeling, not yet finished collapsing.


---

What Remains:

Buildings, once proud, now corkscrewed. Frozen mid-lift as if the planet paused during its final gasp.

Trees, petrified instantly in arcs toward the sky, leaves stripped, roots clawing upward.

Roads, bent into loops. A M√∂bius strip of ruined asphalt and melted streetlights.

Cities, visible only by the negative space they left‚Äîshadows scorched into the crust, like Hiroshima on a cosmic scale.


You might find the upper half of a cathedral, embedded sideways in a cliff.
Or a playground floating two feet above the ground, held in place by a confused gravitational echo.

The animals? Gone.
The people? Gone.
Only impressions remain‚Äîon walls, in dust, in air too tired to move.

Sometimes‚Äîjust sometimes‚Äîyou‚Äôll find a sound.
A song caught in a broken speaker loop.
A half-broadcast emergency alert signal.
A child‚Äôs laugh warped into digital static.

The planet is not dead.
She is mourning.
And her mourning is beautiful, in that tragic, cosmic way‚Äî
like a candle flickering in the vacuum,
like a heartbeat echoing after death,
like the ghost of a lullaby being hummed by a motherless wind.

1m8chyj,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewPortRichey/comments/1m8chyj/favorite_spots_mostly_food_on_recent_npr_trip/,Favorite Spots (mostly food) on Recent NPR Trip,"First off, thank you to everyone who contributes to this sub. I have NEVER written a post before, but I wanted to pay forward the great experiences I had because of the posts I got to read before my trip! I know some of these aren't NPR specifically...

Just in case people were curious - I'm in my mid-30s, grew up in LA and now live in NY. Really really into food.

* White Duck Espresso - I still really want to try Mountaineer, but I couldn't be more happy with White Duck. I was pretty skeptical because I'm not into IG-able drinks, but it's so easy to get a yummy sugar-free drink here and the staff is top notch.
* Estuary - This place is so good. I went here for a special occasion dinner and was blown away. Everything we had was delicious. If you drink & like dessert, get the espresso martini w/ the banana cream pie. Can't wait to try brunch here next time!
* Vito Rose Bagels - The number of times people said ""it can't beat NY bagels though right?"" while I was here... Guys, not all bagels are great in NY. In fact, I had a MID plain bagel with bacon, egg, and cheese on the car ride back home, and thought , ""damn, I wish this was a Vito Rose."" The bagels at Vito Rose are PHENOMENAL. The BEC, everything, and limoncello are not to be slept on! Their blueberry and strawberry cream cheese are so good. And they serve Ragged coffee (I believe this is a local business as well) and it is so yummy. I ate here 3 times on a 10 day trip.
* Escape Brewery + Collective - Surprisingly(?) family friendly brewery with great beer and a food court attached. The Boston Cream + cannoli donuts were my favorite of the donuts we tried and I love that they have Dole Whip. I had the ""spaghett"" as my drink (aperol spritz a la beer) and as a non-beer drinker, I can't recommend this one enough. It is refreshing and fun!
* Ordinance One - Came on a Monday night, which is their vinyl night and had a great time. Picked up some vinyl from Swamp Sounds, and they were a great price + the sound quality is awesome now that I'm listening to them at home.
* Kazu's Sushi - I thought the quality and flavor of the sushi was great. I also loved the decor, but we waited 40 minutes for 4 rolls + sashimi... I'll probably go back anyway the next time I'm in town.
* The Creamery - I got the 4 flavor sampler to share. Every flavor SLAPPED. Officially obsessed with cherry ice cream which I didn't grow up eating.
* Flava Shack - My friends picked this up and it was so good. Love the Rainbow Cookie, cannoli, and cherry chip!
* Fresh Kitchen - Maybe I'm just ignorant, but it was kinda hard to find ""healthy food"" in NPR. A friend suggested this place for lunch and I was really happy to eat healthy food that I didn't have to cook myself. :) The coconut sriracha sauce was yummy!

Special Shout Out

* Planet Fitness on 19 - Compared to my local gym, this location is like a luxury gym. I really enjoyed coming here and the staff were all really nice!
* Rooster Thai  - I came here during my last trip and just wanted to give it a special shout out! This place is yummy!
* Busch Gardens - I got to spend an afternoon here and it was so fun. The food and drinks are tragically overpriced, but it's not about that. It's about... Montu and the animals. :) I was so happy to see so many animals and I hope next time I get to go to the Tampa Aquarium.
* Wing House - Randomly ordered this delivery to Ordinance One and whoa, they were good. Just get the wings.
* Wawa - The fat free French Vanilla Creamer is so good. I'd get coffee here just for that!
* Publix & Aldi - I love these markets so much. Grocery shopping in NY is hard and going to the markets in NPR was really fun in comparison. LOL

Let me know what you think and if you have any suggestions of places to go or restaurants! I really want to do more outdoors stuff. I only got to go to the beach once and I was a little afraid of going into the water because a friend said there was bacteria in the water. I did see a dolphin near the shore though, so that was really cool.",1,1753382267.0,NewPortRichey,0,1.0,False
1m8chxs,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1m8chxs/could_the_hamilton_beach_one_press_coffee_maker/,Could the Hamilton Beach One Press Coffee Maker Review Change Your Morning Routine?,"Testing out a new coffee maker is always an adventure for me, and the Hamilton Beach 48465 One Press Programmable Dispensing Drip Coffee Maker certainly provided its fair share of surprises. Coming from someone who values their morning brew above almost anything else, I was eager to see how this sleek machine would stack up against others I've tried before. With its 12-cup internal brew pot, carafe-free design, and programmable features, it promised fresh and hassle-free coffee. While I was quite satisfied overall, a few quirks caught my attention. Here's everything you need to know.

**Design and Build Quality**

Right out of the box, the design of this coffee machine stands out. It‚Äôs black with chrome accents, which blends effortlessly with modern kitchen aesthetics. The unit felt robust and well-constructed, though I did find its dimensions (8.19""D x 11.03""W x 15.15""H) a bit bulky for smaller countertops. One unique touch is the carafe-free setup. Instead of pouring your coffee into a traditional pot, it‚Äôs stored in an internal tank, which keeps coffee warm for hours. I didn‚Äôt have to worry about shattering a glass carafe or dealing with stubborn coffee stains‚Äîa major plus if you‚Äôre like me and tend to operate clumsily before caffeine kicks in.

**Functionality and User Experience**

Operating this coffee maker was surprisingly intuitive. The buttons and programming features were straightforward, with a blue-backlit display that's easy to read even in dimly lit kitchens. I especially liked the brewing options‚Äîbold, regular, small batches, and iced coffee. The option to brew iced coffee was an unexpected delight and worked well during testing. I brewed a smaller batch of bold coffee on a weekday and a larger pot for guests over the weekend. Switching between settings felt seamless. 

Also, the one-handed dispensing bar was a game-changer‚Äîno spills, no over-pouring, and no underestimating your coffee needs. However, if there‚Äôs one gripe I had, it‚Äôs that the dispensing bar slightly hesitates at times, requiring a firmer press than I‚Äôd expect. Small inconvenience, but worth mentioning.  

[See Hamilton Beach 48465 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b001k66lpq/)

**Highlights**

- Internal warming heater keeps coffee fresh and hot for hours.
- Easy dispensing system eliminates the need for fragile carafes.
- Customizable brewing options, including iced coffee setting.
- Programmable clock allows for wake-up-ready coffee.

**Performance and Coffee Quality**

Most importantly, how did the coffee fare? In one word: solid. The internal water reservoir did a stellar job of maintaining both temperature and flavor for hours. The first cup tasted just as fresh as the fifth, which is rare for a drip coffee maker. Adjusting the brew strength added versatility I didn‚Äôt expect. Of course, the ""bold"" option was a lifesaver for those bleary Mondays when I needed an extra kick. 

Admittedly, small batch brewing slightly struggled to hit the ideal temperature on occasion, but this didn‚Äôt majorly impact its usability. Still, if you're particular about exact heat levels, this might feel like a minor compromise.

**Drawbacks**

No product is perfect, and this one has its flaws. While keeping the coffee tasting fresh for up to four hours felt like a win, cleaning the internal tank proved slightly trickier than anticipated. Even though the brew basket and tank are removable, the crevices required a bit of extra patience. The machine‚Äôs bulkiness also made it an awkward fit for confined spaces, something to consider if counter area comes at a premium in your kitchen. Lastly, the fact that it isn‚Äôt compatible with reusable filters might bother eco-conscious buyers.

- Cleaning takes more effort than expected.
- Slightly bulky footprint isn‚Äôt ideal for small kitchens.
- Lack of reusable filter compatibility could frustrate some.

**Upsides**

There‚Äôs a lot to love about how user-friendly and functional this coffee machine is:

- Programmable features with a 24-hour timer for convenience.
- Distinctive carafe-free design reduces spills and breakage.
- Heating system ensures long-lasting fresh coffee.
- Versatile brewing modes adjust to your mood or coffee preference.

**Competing Products**

When lined up against its competitors, the Hamilton Beach dispensing drip coffee maker holds its own, but there are a few trade-offs. Compared to the Cuisinart DGB-850, this product benefits from simpler programming and a budget-friendly price. However, the Cuisinart wins in grind-and-brew functionality, which some coffee aficionados might prefer. Meanwhile, Keurig models, like the K-Elite, excel in single-serve coffee options, but they can lack the long-term freshness retention seen here. 

It boils down to what you value most. For me, having fresh coffee for hours without worrying about fragile components gave this product an edge.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

Looking at its features, this coffee maker provides substantial value for those who prioritize simplicity, durability, and fresh coffee preservation. While it lacks some bells and whistles seen on pricier models, it hits the mark for dependable daily use. And let‚Äôs face it, who doesn‚Äôt love a machine that simplifies their morning routine?

1m8chlo,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1m8chlo/grief_sleeps_in_her_shadow_still/,Grief Sleeps in Her Shadow Stillüíò,"Sorrow comes to some with the gravitas of a thunderstorm - sudden, loud, and momentarily predominant. To some others, it comes in lazy drifts like lackadaisical mist - slow, accumulative, absolute, intermingled with the skin, impossible to detach. Yours, the latter. Yours comes without permission; it is now the architecture of my soul.

Some absences are absolutely absences, but they don't go away. They are not hollow like an empty room or the silence that follows a song - they are filled with something you can't even name - something thick, something with a pulse. Grief might not always be loud, I have learned. Sometimes it is lying up in the corners - curled up in your mind, breathing lightly like a sleeping animal. Sometimes it is walking quietly behind you, barefoot and patient, never rushing ahead of you - but not leaving you either.

Once, I thought I'd seen the entire shape of sorrow. But that was before you. That was before the warmth of your being made room for an entire universe inside - a universe now continuing to stretch out with your absence. A constellation of memories, half-said things, and the kind of laughter that lingers in the throat long after it has left the lips.

Grief sleeps in your shadow still. Maybe that‚Äôs what makes it cruellest ‚Äî even shadows are more loyal than people. The world forgets, heals, and replaces. But your shadow remains forever against the wall of my life. Unmoving. Unyielding. And every time I try to move forward, I slide back once again into you.

I don‚Äôt write this to remember you ‚Äî you are not the kind of person who could ever be forgotten. I write this because now memory is the only place you are still alive, and even there, your breath is an unremembered whisper on the edge of infinity.

Grief is not the burden of losing a person, I have learned. It is the soft acknowledgement that the world keeps going on without them ‚Äî but worse, that you keep going on. That your heart still beats, shamelessly. That the sun still rises, as if it matters. That coffee keeps brewing, clocks keep ticking, people keep asking you ‚ÄúHow are you?‚Äù without any real sense of how powerful that question has become.

Grief is not simply for the person; it is for the version of yourself that only existed for that person, because there is a madness to remembering too much. But there is a larger madness to forgetting. I have done both. I chose the former.

You were not merely a woman. You were an atmosphere. Your absence is more than an absence - it is a being. A presence that is more present than presence. If silence had a name, it would be yours. If the void could sing, it would hum your lullaby.

Philosophers speak of the absurd - of mankind searching for meaning in a world somehow indifferent to that search. But love is the best example of absurdity. To know, consciously, that all things end - and love, regardless. To give your soul a name, to put it in someone else's hand, and say, ""break this if you must, but hold it like it means something.""

And now you're gone!

You exist in different timelines where your existence specifically excludes mine ‚Äî and yet, your presence lingers with me greater than any support could uphold.

I see you in metaphors. Rain without thunder. The smell of paper and the pause before saying someone's name. I see you in the space between the words: the pause, the ellipses, and the breath elongated than the next sequence. The universe I inhabit is made of your fingerprints ‚Äî it only exists because of your fingerprints ‚Äî but I appear to be the only one to see them.

What do you do when the apparition of someone is more fruitful than the presence of anyone else?

I have tried to move forward- but forward is a direction, not a cure. I have tried to forget - but forgetting is not erasing; it is desolating. And, I am not going to desolate you from the only place where you still exist ‚Äî in my mind.

They say grief is love with nowhere to go. I disagree. Grief is love that will not leave.

You see, the roughest part of knowing you isn't losing your body, but realizing that such beauty existed, and maybe it might never be seen again. That the universe, all of its randomness, chose to show me something eternal --- and with such ferocity, withdrew you.

But you aren‚Äôt gone...

You exist now in the tension between being and becoming. You are not mine. Perhaps you never were. But there is an ache inside of me that feels like proof that something real happened. Then, for a split second, the infinite bent its neck down just low enough for me to kiss.

I hear time heals. No-time just shows you how to carry a weight without stooping. Grief doesn't end; it transforms. It transforms into poetry. It transforms to silence. It transforms into a ritual - the act of lighting a candle for someone who will never come back, and ceaselessly does.

Do you understand?

You are my candle; My ritual; My sacred ache.

And if you asked me if I would love her again - knowing how it ends - I would say yes. A thousand times, yes. Even if the price of beauty is destruction. Even if that one summer cost me a lifetime of winters.

You were worth the sorrow.

You still are.

So I write.

Because in a world where love ends and memory does not, this - this letter - is a rebellion. A defiance of oblivion. A way of saying: She was here. You were real. You changed the axis of my soul.

And even now, as I speak these words into the silence that can never answer back -- even now -- grief sleeps in your shadow.

And I, who loved like a fool and grieved like a poet, still call that shadow home.

My love - or the ghost - if this letter finds you, let it not be a plea, but a poem. A last verse in the language of longing. Let it be said: I have never stopped being the man who does not see you in the crowd, but in the silence of the crowd that is created after you have passed by.



***Still yours,***

***In the shadow cast even by extinguished stars,***

***In the hush before the tide returns,***

***In the breath between every thought of you ‚Äî***

Ek din aise hi shaam ko, main apne apartment ki balcony mein baithi thi, hawa mein ek alag si freshness thi. Coffee ka cup haath mein tha aur main bas khayalon mein doobi hui thi.

1m8cf3x,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1m8cf3x/from_exile_to_queen_of_everything_summary_review/,"From Exile To Queen Of Everything: Summary, Review and Reading Link","""Are you sure about this, Sienna? You don't have to go back to Solara. You could stay here, with us.""

Outside the airport terminal, a woman in a chic white suit held Sienna's hand, her own trembling. Her blonde hair and blue eyes were swimming with a desperate plea. ""Please, stay,"" she begged.

Sienna, a vision of cool elegance, met her foster mother's gaze. She pulled her into a deep, meaningful hug, her own eyes stinging.

""I have to go back, Mom,"" she said softly. ""But I'll be back. I promise.""

But as the plane taxied down the runway, she knew this was a promise she might not be able to keep.

Three days ago, the dam of her memory had broken. Ten years, washed away in an instant, revealing the truth of who she was.

She was Sienna Hart, eldest daughter of the prestigious Hart family of Vallaris.

At eighteen, a trip abroad had ended in a fiery plane crash. By some miracle, she survived, only to be found by a kind couple who, believing she had no one, adopted her and raised her as their own.

Now, at twenty-eight, the past had come rushing back. Her family was alive. The weight of that knowledge was a moral compass she couldn't ignore. She had to go home.

The flight was long, but sleep was a distant stranger. Sienna spent the hours piecing together the fractured memories of her family. It all felt like a bizarre, vivid dream from another lifetime.

At ten past 10 at night, Sienna arrived in Vallaris. She hailed a cab, and the driver greeted her with thick Vallaris accent. ""Where to, Miss?""

A faint smile touched her lips. ""88 Maplecrest Avenue, please.""

""Well, I'll be,"" the driver said, catching her accent. ""You don't look local. I thought you were a tourist.""

Sienna's smile widened. ""I'm from here. It's just... ""

The smile faltered, a shadow of old pain and fresh hope passing through her eyes. ""... it's been a long time.""

Ten years. A lifetime. Everything she knew was gone. 'Are you okay, my dear sisters?' She thought to herself with a bitter smile.

The driver chattered on, a friendly monologue about how kids these days should visit their parents more.

When they pulled up to the address, Sienna paid and stepped out, her brow furrowing. A sleek, pulsing nightclub stood where her memories insisted it shouldn't be.

Charmvale. The name felt foreign on her tongue. The world had truly moved on without her.

But as she turned to leave, a heated argument at the club's entrance caught her eye. A man, radiating a lazy arrogance with his hands shoved in his pockets, had the kind of face that promised heartbreak. His voice was a whip of cold indifference.

""Get it through your head,"" he was speaking to a young girl, who looked painfully thin in her simple dress. ""You're a stand-in. A substitute. Do I have to spell it out for you?""

The girl's eyes were red-rimmed, her pretty face streaked with tears.

""Mason, I already told you,"" she replied. ""I don't feel well. I'm not going to the hospital to donate blood today.""

Mason let out a cruel laugh. He grabbed her chin, forcing her to meet his gaze. ""Not feeling well? Is that why you're here, selling drinks? Or is it something else you're selling, Vivian?""

Vivian's jaw tightened. With a sharp crack, her hand flew across his face.

""You're a monster, Mason,"" she spat, her voice trembling with rage. ""I've paid my debts. We're done. Now get away from me!""

""Done?"" Mason scoffed. ""You don't get to say when we're done. Did you forget? Without my family's engagement to yours three years ago, the Harts would be bankrupt. You want to walk away? Go ahead. But I wonder what your father would have to say about that.""

With that, he grabbed her arm, and started dragging her toward his car. ""If you want to keep playing the part of my fianc√©e, you'll do as you're told. Chloe needs your blood. It's the only thing you're good for, after all.""

A wave of utter despair washed over Vivian. She closed her eyes, defeated.

It was always like this. Three years ago, she'd thought he was her savior. He'd seemed to genuinely like her. But it was all a lie. He was just using her as a living, breathing medicine cabinet for the woman he actually loved.

Every month, another transfusion. And when she tried to end it, her own father had slapped her for even suggesting it.

""Let her go."" The voice was cool and sharp as ice, cutting through the night. Mason froze, turning to face a woman whose beauty was as breathtaking as the authority in her eyes.

""Who are you?"" Mason scowled. ""This is a private matter.""

But Vivian heard that voice and felt the world tilt on its axis. It was a voice she knew in her soul, a voice from a life she thought was lost forever.

She looked up, her body rigid with disbelief. The face‚Äîso familiar, so regal, so achingly missed‚Äîsent a tremor through her heart.

A trembling hand reached out, her own face a mask of shock. Her lips parted, and a single, fragile word escaped, a name she'd only dared to whisper in her dreams.

""Sienna?"" she mumbled. ""Are you Sienna?""

Sienna's gaze softened as she looked at the broken girl before her. Vivian, her second sister, had only been fifteen when she'd left. Now, she was a young woman, but her eyes held the same light.

""Vivian,"" Sienna said, her voice a gentle balm. ""It's me.""

""Sienna!""

Vivian ripped her arm from Mason's grasp and threw herself into Sienna's embrace, sobbing as if her heart would break.

All the years of pain, of loneliness, of quiet desperation, came pouring out. She clung to Sienna like a drowning girl to a lifeline, shaking with fear that this was all a dream, another cruel trick of her mind.

Sienna held her tight, stroking her back. Her voice was a steady, warm anchor in the storm.

""It's okay,"" she murmured. ""I'm here now. I'm back, and I'm not going anywhere.""

Vivian cried until her sister's shoulder was soaked, finally pulling back with a sniffle of embarrassment, her eyes puffy and red.

""Is this real?"" she whispered. ""You're really here? This isn't a dream?""

Sienna's heart ached. ""It's real, Vivian. I'm really back.""

And she would burn the world to the ground before she ever left her again.

Mason stared, completely lost. 'Sister?' he was confused. 'Vivian didn't have a sister. She was the eldest... wasn't she?'

""Vivian, are you done with this melodrama?"" he chimed in. ""We're leaving. Now.""

Before he could finish the sentence, another sharp smack echoed in the night air.

Mason stumbled, his head whipping to the side.

Sienna had hit him, and she hadn't held back. She'd been listening to his vile performance, her fury a coiled snake in her gut.

A substitute? Forced blood donations? What kind of sick, primetime drama was this? Thought Sienna

And then he'd said her sister's name. That was the final straw.

Bullying her family. Right in front of her. He had a death wish.

""You... ! Do you have any idea who I am?"" cried Mason. The slap had left him dazed, his cheek was numb and painful. ""I'm Vivian's boyfriend! Who do you think you are?""

The woman before him radiated a power that was genuinely terrifying. A cold dread crept over him.

""I'm her sister,"" Sienna pulled Vivian behind her, her voice deadly calm. ""And you just laid a hand on my family. So, tell me. Do you want to leave here walking, or crawling?""

Vivian sniffled, the fear instantly replaced by a surge of strength. Sienna was a fortress, and inside her walls, nothing could touch her.

""Sienna, I hate him,"" she whimpered, clinging to Sienna's arm. ""He's a bully.""

That was all Sienna needed to hear. She drove her foot into Mason's stomach, sending him sprawling to the pavement again.

""You... you'll pay for this!"" Mason gasped, yet he could do nothing but scramble away.

# Chapter 2 A Gilded Cage No More

Sienna steered Vivian away from the scene, gently dabbing at the lingering tears on her cheeks.

Vivian was not so short, but next to Sienna, amplified by heels, she looked as fragile as a porcelain doll.

""Don't cry, Vivian,"" Sienna said softly. ""Tell me what happened. Tell me everything.""

Vivian's shoulders shook with silent sobs. She didn't want to cry, but the injustice of it all was overwhelming. Besides, she had a million questions of her own.

Everyone had told her Sienna was dead, gone for ten years. A full decade of silence.

Sienna took her to a quiet diner and ordered them both a steak. As the hot food arrived, Vivian's storm of emotions began to subside.

""Sienna... where were you these years?"" she wiped her face clean and finally asked the question that had been haunting her for years, ""They all said you were... ""

Sienna's sisters had never believed it, not really. Not the official story about the plane crash. But after ten years without a single word, even the strongest hope begins to wither.

A wave of guilt washed over Sienna. ""I thought I was dead, too,"" she admitted.

""By some miracle, I survived. A kind couple found me, adopted me. But I had amnesia. For ten years, I didn't know who I was. Three days ago, it all came back. The second it did, I booked a flight home to find you.""

Amnesia. The single word erased a decade of resentment. All the anger Vivian had harbored‚Äîfor being abandoned, for being left alone‚Äîevaporated into thin air.

""We were so useless, we... "" Vivian couldn't tear her eyes away from Sienna's face across the table, terrified that she might dissolve into mist.

""Enough of that,"" Sienna said gently but firmly. ""Now, tell me about this Mason.""

""He's my ex, sister. It's over,"" Vivian said, a little too quickly. ""Hey, you should stay with me tonight!""

She couldn't bear for Sienna to know the whole, humiliating story.

Sienna didn't push. If Vivian wouldn't tell her, she'd find out on her own. And anyone who had hurt her family would learn the true meaning of regret.

When they arrived at the address Vivian gave, Sienna stopped dead. The building was a dilapidated walk-up in a grim part of town. ""Vivian... this is where you live?""

Their family home was a sprawling villa at No. 1 Southlake. Why would Vivian be here? Was this some kind of misguided attempt at independence? Sienna was confused.

Vivian couldn't meet her eyes. She had been thrown out of her home seven years ago. How could she possibly explain that?

""It's not so bad. Come on, let's go up!"" she said, leading Sienna upstairs.

Sienna followed her, a knot forming in her stomach. As Vivian reached for the door, a portly, greasy-looking man blocked their path.

""Vivian! Late on the rent again, I see,"" he boomed. ""You're six months behind! With utilities, you owe me two thousand bucks! And now you're bringing guests? Pay up!""

Vivian froze, her face a mixture of panic and shame as she glanced between the landlord and Sienna. She prayed he would just shut up.

""I've been patient with you, you know, 'cause you're a pretty little thing,"" the landlord continued. ""But you're pushing your luck! A girl who looks like you can't scrape together two grand? What a waste.""

His eyes roamed over Vivian's body with a possessive leer that made Sienna's blood run cold. He'd clearly been hoping to collect his rent in ways that didn't involve money.

Just as Vivian opened her mouth to protest, Sienna stepped forward. She pulled a thick wad of cash from her purse and slammed it into the man's chest.

""Here's the rent,"" she said, her voice dripping with ice. ""Now get out of my sight before I do something we'll both regret.""

""Hey! Who do you think you are?"" the landlord sputtered, stunned by the cash. But before he could say more, Sienna had pulled Vivian inside and bolted the door.

Vivian stared at the floor, unable to look at the sister she'd always worshipped.

Sienna said nothing. She calmly set down her luggage, opened a window to let in the night air, and flicked on a light.

The room was tiny, the furniture old, the walls peeling. But it was tidy and had a certain warmth to it. It was obviously a home, one Vivian had lived in for a long, long time.

She then turned to her sister. Vivian still had the same sweet, round face and big, bright eyes she'd had as a girl. Her long, straight hair fell like a curtain as she hung her head in shame.

""You want the shower first, or should I go?"" Sienna opened her suitcase and asked.

""Huh?"" Vivian's mind went blank.

She'd been desperately trying to invent a plausible lie, a story to explain everything. But the simple, domestic question threw her completely. She'd expected accusations. Demands. Not this.

Sienna picked up a silk pajama set and walked toward her.

Vivian squeezed her eyes shut, bracing for a blow. 'She's going to hit me. I deserve it. I'm pathetic.' She thought with fear.

'I couldn't protect anything after Sienna left,' the thought lingered in Vivian's mind. 'I lost our home. That woman has all of Mom's things now, and Dad... Dad is a different person. I couldn't even save Sienna's favorite Bartholomew Bear. The other sisters and I... we're not close anymore... I'm a failure.'

But the slap never came. Instead, a gentle hand began to stroke her hair.

Vivian's eyes shot open. Sienna was looking down at her, a soft smile on her face that seemed to warm the entire room, chasing away the shadows in Vivian's heart.

""I'll go first, then,"" Sienna said, and disappeared into the bathroom.

Vivian stood there, dazed, a slow, brilliant smile spreading across her face. She watched the bathroom door, her heart full of a feeling she hadn't known in a decade: hope.

A few minutes later, Sienna emerged, wrapped in a cloud of steam and the scent of peaches.

Her skin glowed, and a silky, moon-white nightgown draped her elegant figure. Her dark, curly hair tumbled over her shoulders. She was breathtaking.

She was toweling her hair dry when she noticed Vivian staring, transfixed. She chuckled and reached out to pinch her sister's cheek affectionately.

""Your turn.""

Vivian blushed beet red, wishing she could melt into the floor. ""Hey Sienna, I... ""

Sienna sat on the edge of the small bed, and in that instant, the shabby room seemed to transform into a palace. It was as if the universe itself was merely a backdrop for her beauty.

Vivian's heart hammered in her chest. Sienna was even more beautiful than she remembered.

'That grace, those curves... even I'm jealous!' she thought. 'I wonder how many men tried to get their hands on her while she was away... '

The thought made her inexplicably angry. She puffed out her cheeks, and when she came out of the shower, she still looked like a cross little pufferfish.

# Chapter 3 The First Night Home

Sienna had already dried her own hair and was leaning back against the headboard, her expression unreadable as she stared out the window.

When Vivian emerged from the bathroom, Sienna's gaze softened. She patted the spot beside her. ""Come here. Let me dry your hair.""

Vivian's first instinct was to refuse. Sienna had just returned; she shouldn't be a burden.

But Sienna's voice was gentle and mesmerizing, and it pulled her forward against her will.

In the end, she found herself sitting on the floor, then lying back, her head in her sister's lap, as the warm air from the hairdryer washed over her.

It felt... so safe. Thought Vivian. Her eyes fluttered closed in contentment, then shot open again.

She was terrified this was all a dream, a beautiful, fragile fantasy she would wake from at any moment. She drank in the sight of her sister's perfect face, her heart aching with a desperate question.

""Are you... "" she asked, her voice barely a whisper. ""Are you going to leave again?""

The motion of Sienna's hands paused for a fraction of a second. ""No,"" she said, her voice soft but absolute. ""I'm not leaving.""

'From now on, wherever I go, my sisters go with me,' she told herself.

Joy, pure and overwhelming, bloomed in Vivian's chest. A tear escaped and rolled down her cheek, dropping on Sienna's dress.

Sienna didn't say a word, simply reaching down to wipe the tear away.

She knew Vivian must have suffered unimaginable pain in the years she was gone. She wouldn't press her for details. Not yet.

The rest of her life would be free of suffering, Sienna vowed silently. Because she was here now.

""Alright, go get the hand cream from my suitcase,"" she gently patted on Vivian's shoulder.

""Okay!"" Vivian bounced up, retrieving a pink and white tube.

Sienna uncapped it. ""Hands.""

Vivian obediently held them out. The cool touch of the white lotion on her skin was like a jolt to her heart.

""You have to take care of yourself,"" Sienna said gently. ""And of course, your hands too.""

Vivian's eyes welled up again. Don't cry, she told herself fiercely. You'll annoy her.

She just nodded, her throat tight. The scent of the cream was divine, a delicate blend of fruit and flowers, with a hint of tea‚Äîrefreshing and not at all cloying.

""This smells amazing!"" Vivian exclaimed.

Sienna smiled. ""Just something I whip up myself. If you like it, it's yours. Use it every morning and night.""

Vivian's face flushed. She shook her head quickly. ""No, I couldn't, it's yours‚Äî""

Before she could finish, Sienna pinched her cheek again. ""What's mine is yours. Now, put it away and get some sleep.""

Vivian nodded obediently, slipping under the covers and immediately plastering herself to Sienna's side, clinging to her arm.

Just like when they were children, Sienna held her, patting her back gently until her breathing evened out.

It was the most peaceful night's sleep Vivian had had in ten years, wrapped in her sister's arms, just like old times.

Her sister was home.

In her sleep, Vivian murmured, ""Sienna... ""

Sienna, her own eyes wide open in the darkness, gazed down at her. The carefully constructed dam around her own emotions finally broke, and a single, hot tear traced a path down her cheek.

Later that night, once she was sure Vivian was sound asleep, Sienna carefully slipped out of bed. She stepped over to the window and dialed a number.

""It's me,"" she said, her voice low and sharp. ""Lana. I need you to look into something for me. And pack a bag. You're coming to Solara. I might be here for a while. Hand the company's affairs over to the board.""

The next day, Vivian woke in a haze, a pleasant dream fading from her mind. Then reality crashed in, and she shot upright.

The other side of the bed was empty.

She's gone. It was a dream. She thought, disappointingly. My sister didn't come back.

But then she caught the lingering floral scent on her hands, and her heart leaped with frantic hope.

She scrambled out of bed, her bare feet hitting the cold floor. The clatter of cookware grew louder as she neared the kitchen.

She rounded the corner just in time to see Sienna, wearing an apron, carrying two steaming plates out of the kitchen.

""What's wrong?"" Sienna asked, raising an eyebrow. ""It's only six. Why aren't you sleeping in?""

The sight of her, real and solid and here, calmed the frantic beating of Vivian's heart.

""How many times have I told you? Don't run around without shoes, you'll catch a cold,"" Sienna noticed her bare feet and immediately went into big-sister mode. ""You're not a child anymore. Go put on some socks and shoes, now.""

The familiar nagging was the warmest sound Vivian had ever heard. She sniffled, nodding vigorously. ""Okay. I'll go put on shoes right now.""

""Shoes and socks, then wash up,"" Sienna added. ""Breakfast is almost ready.""

""Okay!"" Vivian replied.

While abroad, Sienna's adoptive parents had hired a renowned chef from Solara to cater to her tastes.

She had learned a few breakfast recipes herself, dishes that were both delicious and nourishing. Watching Vivian devour the food, she figured it must have turned out okay.

""Slow down,"" she said with a smile. ""No one's going to steal it from you.""

Vivian took a huge bite of the eggs. ""Sister, this is so good!""

Sienna passed her a napkin. ""Wipe your mouth. So, Vivian, are you working now?""

The light in Vivian's eyes dimmed instantly. Her gaze shifted, a flicker of shame crossing her face, but she answered truthfully. ""Yes. I work at a company called Dynastis.""

Sienna just ruffled her hair. ""I'll drive you to work later.""

She didn't ask why she was working. As the second daughter of the Hart family, she could have lived a life of leisure, coasting on the inheritance their mother had left them.

There were so many questions, but Sienna held them back. She had already sent people to find the answers.

By the end of the day, she would know everything. Her sisters didn't have to say a word, but that didn't mean she, as their older sister, would remain in the dark.

And if she found out anyone had laid a hand on them, she would make them pray for a quick death.

""No, Sienna, you don't have to!"" Vivian protested. ""You should rest. I can take the bus, it's really fast.""

Sienna gave a wry smile. ""What? Are you embarrassed to be seen with me?""

Vivian's eyes went wide. She shook her head frantically. ""No! Not at all! I would never think that! I just... I don't want to trouble you.""

She looked down, ashamed. The truth is, she was afraid she would embarrass Sienna. At Dynastis, she was just... a nobody.

""I'm your sister. It's never a trouble,"" replied Sienna. As she spoke, her phone rang. She picked it up and stepped aside. ""Speak."" A pause. ""Good. Understood.""

When they went downstairs, the portly landlord was waiting, his face split in a sycophantic grin. He greeted them with an enthusiasm that was a world away from his venomous tirade the day before. His eyes, however, lingered disgustingly where they shouldn't.

Sienna shot him a look so sharp and cold it could have cut glass. The man's smile froze, and a flicker of fear entered his eyes. He quickly looked away.

I'll deal with you later, Sienna thought, her eyes turning to ice.

Parked beside the shabby apartment building was a crimson Rolls-Royce. Vivian couldn't help but stare.

She didn't know much about cars, but she knew this one was custom, and its price tag would have more commas than she could count. What was it doing here? She wondered. It was so out of place it was almost comical.

""Come on,"" Sienna said, walking towards it. ""Get in.""

Vivian blinked. ""Huh?"" Get in? The only other vehicle around was a shared bicycle. Was her sister planning to bike her to work?

Confused but obedient, she started walking toward the bike. Sienna sighed, grabbed her hand, and pulled her toward the luxury car.

""This way. Get in,"" said Sienna. ""Or you'll be late.""

# Chapter 4 A Game Of Push And Pull

Vivian stared at the open car door, her mouth agape.

She looked from the car to Sienna and back again, swallowing hard. She pointed a trembling finger. ""Sienna... is this car yours?""

Sienna nodded. ""Yes. If you like it, it's yours. By the way, do you know how to drive?""

Vivian just shook her head, still reeling.

One moment, her sister owns a Rolls-Royce; the next, she's offering to give it to her.

Before her brain could fully process it, her body was already moving, sinking into the plush leather of the passenger seat.

They'd been driving for a few minutes before the reality of the situation finally sank in. ""Sienna!"" she exclaimed, her voice buzzing with excitement. ""This is really your car! Where did you get so much money? Oh, wait, that's not what I meant. You're so amazing, of course you'd be successful.""

But this was beyond successful. She screamed inside. This car had to be worth a hundred or two hundred million, at least!

Sienna just smiled, the morning light catching the angles of her exquisite face. ""You really think I'm that capable?""

""Of course!"" Vivian declared proudly. ""You are the most brilliant woman in the entire world! You've always been my idol.""

From a young age, Sienna had been a prodigy. She was always first in her class, with perfect scores in every subject. She'd been the top when applying for college.

And as for looks, she had been crowned the number one beauty in Vallaris. Their entire family was blessed with good genes; their mother and grandmother were both legendary beauties and scholars in their own right.

""You're amazing too,"" Sienna said quietly.

The simple words made Vivian freeze, her heart skipping a beat.

Me? Amazing? She pondered. But... she had let Sienna down. She was a failure.

""You can just drop me off at the corner up ahead,"" she said, her voice suddenly small. ""My office is just a short walk from there.""

""Alright,"" Sienna agreed, pulling the car over. A message notification lit up her phone. It was Lana; she had arrived.

""What time do you get off? I'll pick you up,"" Sienna said, handing Vivian a sleek black business card. ""Here's my number. Save it.""

Vivian nodded, quickly adding the contact, labeling it simply: Sienna.

She walked toward her office, her heart light and happy.

Standing sentinel at the company entrance was Mason, dressed in a sharp blue suit. He kept glancing at his watch, his expression impatient.

Vivian knew he was waiting for her, but she ignored him and walked straight past.

""Vivian! Stop!"" Seeing her walk by without a flicker of acknowledgment ignited his anger. How dare this woman ignore him?

Vivian didn't break her stride, heading directly into the building.

Furious, Mason grabbed her arm, yanking her back. ""Have I been too good to you? You dare to ignore me? You think just because someone helped you last night, you can defy me?""

Vivian shook him off. ""Mason, we're broken up. From now on, we have nothing to do with each other. Stay away from me.""

Mason was momentarily speechless. He took a breath, trying to regain control. ""Vivian, I'm giving you one last chance. Apologize, come to the hospital with me right now, and I'll still be your boyfriend.""

Vivian let out a scornful laugh. This was the man she once thought she loved.

When she first met him, she'd been drawn to his seemingly endless kindness. He had been a light in her darkness, giving her the courage to live when she felt most helpless.

But in the end, he had wounded her again and again. The moment his precious Chloe so much as whimpered, it was always Vivian's fault.

""Mason, you're delusional. Starting today, I will never donate another drop of my blood to Chloe,"" replied Vivian. ""Get that through your head. Your family has always wanted to call off the engagement, right? Fine. Let's do it. I don't want the title of your fianc√©e anyway.""

Sienna was back. Vivian knew she didn't have to be afraid of anyone.

Mason sneered. ""Vivian, there's a limit to these games. Did you really think a pathetic little trick like this would work on me? I have a gala tonight. Be there.""

With that, he turned and left, confident in his victory. He believed Vivian couldn't break up with him. She loved him too much. How could she possibly want to end the engagement?

It was just a game of push and pull, he told himself. A way to get attention. All women were like that.

Vivian brushed off the sleeve he had touched, her expression one of utter disgust.

'Mason, how stupid was I to ever give you the impression that I couldn't live without you?' she sighed quietly

Meanwhile, inside Vivian's rented place, a glass shattered against the wall.

On the table lay several documents. Standing before Sienna was a woman with blonde hair and blue eyes, dressed in a black business suit.

""S‚Äî"" the woman began.

""I told you,"" Sienna cut her off, her voice dangerously low. ""From now on, you will call me Miss Enna. And I don't want my identity revealed. I trust you understand that.""

""Yes, Miss Enna. My apologies,"" Lana said, her expression unreadable.

Sienna's eyes blazed with fury, her fists clenched so tight her knuckles were white.

'Aiden, how dare you treat Vivian this way?' she mumbled to herself. 'You're dead. Just you wait. Tonight, I'll make you wish you'd never been born.'

""Miss Enna, shall I acquire the Hart Corporation?"" Lana asked. ""It's in chaos right now, its development has stagnated. It would take half a month at most.""

Sienna waved her hand dismissively, her cool, indifferent eyes glinting like sharp ice. ""Not yet. For now, buy up this entire block. And put this building in my sister Vivian's name.""

""Yes, Miss Enna.""

As Lana turned to leave, Sienna stopped her. ""Wait.""

""Miss Enna?""

Sienna carefully wrapped the shards of broken glass in a handkerchief. ""Throw this out. And buy me an identical one.""

Lana was confused‚Äîthe handkerchief alone was worth ten times more than the cheap glass‚Äîbut she obeyed without question. Miss Enna always had her reasons.

Calming down, Sienna picked up her phone and sent Vivian a message: \[Are you tired? I brought you a Silkstone Espresso.\]

Receiving the text from Sienna, Vivian left the building on time to meet Sienna, much to her manager's annoyance. The ever-compliant Vivian Hart was actually the first to leave.

Silkstone Expresson was her favorite drink. She took the coffee cup and took a sip. A familiar ache, bittersweet and comforting, filled her chest. After her sister had left, she had never again tasted her favorite drink.

Now she was back, and so was this small piece of happiness.

""Thanks, Sienna."" Vivian grinned, her pure, pretty face radiating joy.

Sienna reached out and brushed her bangs aside. The Harts were all stunning. Vivian had a delicate, beautiful face with the soft lines of an oval shape, gentle brow bones, and large almond eyes that shone with innocence.

But Sienna knew that her little sister was too sensible, too used to swallowing her grievances and burying her pain.

""Let's get you a conditioning treatment‚Äîyour hair is looking a little frizzy. Then we'll go to the mall and buy you some beautiful clothes,"" she said.

Vivian's immediate instinct was to refuse, to say she had no money. But she didn't want to spoil her sister's mood.

When had she, Vivian Hart, the second daughter of the family, become so timid? It probably started the day she was kicked out of her home without a penny to her name.

As if sensing her hesitation, Sienna's voice softened.

""Vivian, I know I was gone for ten years. I know you all suffered after I left,"" she added. ""But I promise you, from this day forward, you will never suffer another injustice. So please, don't be a stranger to me, okay? Or... if you feel I no longer deserve to be your sister, you don't have to acknowledge me.""

# Chapter 5 The ""Stolen"" Black Card

""No! That's not it!"" Vivian said, her voice choked with emotion. ""I've never thought that! I just... I don't want to be a bother. I'm sorry.""

How could she ever not acknowledge her sister? Even in death, she would never disown Sienna.

Sienna's expression softened. ""From now on, you tell me everything. We're family. There's no such thing as being a 'bother.' You girls are the only family I have left. If you push me away, I don't know what I came back for.""

Vivian's eyes filled with tears as she nodded fiercely.

After a luxurious hair treatment, they headed straight for the mall. Sienna stepped away to take a call, leaving Vivian to try on clothes.

But suddenly, two women walked in. They spotted Vivian, their faces first showing surprise, then morphing into matching sneers of contempt.

""Well, well, if it isn't the lovely Miss Vivian Hart,"" one of them drawled, sauntering over. ""Long time no see. Shopping for new clothes?""

The moment Vivian saw Bella and Marcy, her good mood vanished. She turned her back on them without a word.

""Come on, Vivian,"" Bella cooed, blocking her path. ""We were classmates. Is that any way to greet an old friend?""

She covered her mouth with a hand, giggling as she looked Vivian up and down. She reeks of poverty. The nerve of her, coming here.

Marcy chimed in. ""Oh, don't you know, Bella? She's too good for us now. By the way, Vivian, did you hear? Mason's precious Chloe is threatening to move abroad. Mason rushed to the airport to stop her‚Äîit was all over the news. Didn't you see?""

Vivian didn't want to engage. She tried to step around them, but Bella blocked her again. ""Don't go. Marcy asked you a question.""

Vivian rolled her eyes. ""I don't waste my breath on people I don't know.""

""What?"" Bella's face flushed with anger. ""Vivian, do you still think you're the high-and-mighty second daughter of the Hart family? Everyone knows you were kicked out! If you weren't clinging to Mason for dear life, you think he ever would have gotten engaged to you?""

""What's it to you?"" Vivian retorted.

Marcy pulled the fuming Bella back. ""She's right, Bella, it's none of our business. However,"" she said, her eyes landing on the dress in Vivian's hands, ""we've taken a liking to that dress. Salesclerk! Wrap it up for us.""

The salesclerk looked apologetic. ""I'm very sorry, but this lady has already decided to purchase this dress. Perhaps you'd like to look at something else?""

""What did you say?"" Marcy snapped. ""Do you know who I am? She's just a low-level office worker. Her monthly salary wouldn't even cover a pair of my socks. This dress is nearly five thousand dollars. Are you sure she can afford it?""

This clueless clerk is going to regret this, thought Marcy to herself.

The clerk maintained her professional smile. ""I'm sorry.""

""Do you want to get fired?"" Marcy barked. ""I can have the manager fire you on the spot!""

The clerk looked troubled but stood her ground.

She knew Sienna was clearly someone of high status. had been wearing a globally exclusive, custom-made piece‚Äîthe kind of person even brand executives would bow to. She had worked in luxury retail for over a decade and knew her brands.

The manager, hearing the commotion, hurried over. Seeing Bella and Marcy, his face immediately broke into a sycophantic grin.

""Miss Bella! Miss Marcy! So good to see you! My clerk here is new, she doesn't know any better. Please, don't mind her. It's just a dress, right?"" he replied, then turned to the clerk. ""If the ladies like it, wrap it up for them! What are you dawdling for?""

""But, sir,"" the clerk protested, gestured Vivian, ""this lady saw it first, and she said she was buying it.""

""She said she was buying it,"" the manager emphasized. ""Which means she hasn't paid yet. Miss,"" he said, turning to Vivian, ""are you sure you want this dress? If so, you'll need to pay now.""

Vivian didn't flinch. ""I haven't finished shopping,"" she said coolly. ""Why are you rushing me to pay? That's not your policy.""

The manager couldn't care less about policy. To him, Bella and Marcy were from high society. But Vivian, on the other hand, was dressed in clothes that probably cost less than a hundred dollars total.

Could she really afford this? He thought. It was a joke. She was just trying to show off.

""Vivian, there's no discount on this one."" Bella taunted. ""Are you sure you want to buy it? I doubt you make that much in a year.""

""That's none of your concern,"" Vivian replied.

Marcy added, ""Vivian, if you want it, pay for it. If you don't, it's not yours. It's a simple concept.""

""Indeed, Miss,"" the manager said. ""Please proceed to payment.""

A flicker of scorn crossed Vivian's face. They were so quick to judge. Before she left, Sienna had given her a card.

When Vivian pulled out the black card, Bella and Marcy's eyes nearly popped out of their sockets.

""That's impossible!"" Bella shrieked, her composure shattering. ""A black card! Where did you get a black card? You can't possibly have one!""

The manager's jaw dropped. He stared at the card in her hand. It was a global, unlimited black card‚Äîthe symbol of the truly, unfathomably wealthy.

His attitude did a complete one-eighty. He rubbed his hands together, his face beaming. ""My deepest apologies, esteemed Miss! I was out of line just now, please forgive me! Is there anything else you need? Please, take your time, look at all our new arrivals. No rush, no rush at all.""

Marcy, however, suddenly had a realization. She pointed at the card, a look of triumph on her face. ""I see! Vivian, you stole someone's credit card! I'm calling the police! You can explain it to them.""

Marcy was one hundred percent certain the card was stolen. Even with the Quinn family's standing in Vallaris, Mason's branch of the family couldn't possibly possess a black card. The Harts were even less likely. There was only one explanation.

It had to be stolen.

Vivian sneered. ""Are you insane, Marcy? Go ahead, try stealing one yourself.""

Marcy gritted her teeth. She had always hated Vivian's smug attitude.

""Vivian, you can't have a card like that,"" Bella insisted. ""If it's not stolen, it must be a fake.""

""Yes, it has to be fake!"" Marcy chimed in, turning to the manager. ""I'm warning you. She's just a broke office worker making less than five thousand a month. When she can't pay, we're not buying that dress.""

The manager's smile faltered, his doubts returning.

Without another word, Bella snatched the dress from Vivian's hands.

Caught off guard, Vivian instinctively held on tight. There was a sickening rip sound as the fabric tore.

# Chapter 6 Payback

Bella raised an eyebrow, letting go of the ruined dress as if it were on fire. A smug, triumphant smile spread across her face.

""Oops. My hand slipped,"" she said, feigning innocence. ""But I'm sure since you love it so much, Vivian, you'll buy it anyway, right?""

Vivian's hands clenched into fists, her body trembling with rage.

""Oh, don't worry, Bella,"" Marcy added, her voice dripping with mock concern. ""She has a black card, remember? A little tear like that is nothing to her.""

""I'm not buying it,"" Vivian gritted out.

The manager blanched. ""What! You can't do that! The dress was damaged while you were holding it. You have to pay for it.""

The honest salesclerk stepped forward. ""Sir, that's not true. This lady,"" she said, pointing at Bella, ""is the one who pulled it. It wasn't Miss Hart's fault.""",1,1753382087.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

For hetero men, what makes you comfortable choosing to approach someone?

I'm currently off the apps and hoping once again to meet folks in the wild. I've successfully been approached in very specific settings (at night, at parties related to a hobby I enjoy), so I don't think I'm completely unapproachable, but would like to branch out and meet other types of people during the daytime.

I live in an East Coast city, spend a lot of time at coffee shops, bookstores, walk/bike around often, go to a popular gym, and attend local events. I've been told I give off 'black cat energy' but I have a nice smile and am generally someone people find friendly once they get to know me. I've already changed a few things (less all-black outfits, putting phone away in lines, working on eye contact), but I guess I'm wondering if I'm missing something that would make me more approachable to men?

More eye contact?  Direct compliments?  Or am I just shooting myself in the foot by not wanting to meet folks in the bar scene/at night? The reason for this is that I'm not really a drinker and I'm an active morning person, so it feels like there's been a mismatch in lifestyle when I meet folks out partying. I'm also a black woman and think that that adds to an intimidation factor unfortunately, but there's nothing I can change about that.

I get constant (and appreciated) feedback from women on my appearance (just saying this to emphasize that I put effort into my appearance when I'm out and about and have a natural, put-together look), but almost nothing from men (besides normal urban catcalling) in real life. My Achilles heel is I've just never been amazing at small talk but maybe that's another thing to work on.",5,1753381984.0,datingoverthirty,9,1.0,False

Hey everyone
So picture this: I‚Äôm in the middle of moving (already a cursed activity), and while I‚Äôm away grabbing another load of stuff, some aspiring pirates of the suburban wasteland decide to break into my old place. Naturally, they ignore all the junk I wanted to get rid of and go straight for the buried treasure.

Among their brilliant decisions: trying to steal my non-running project car. Spoiler alert..it didn‚Äôt run before, and it still doesn‚Äôt. So what did these masterminds do? They took the keys. Just the keys. Like a weirdly specific souvenir from a theft-themed escape room.

Now the car is safe and sound, but I can‚Äôt steer it into its new garage because..surprise..it‚Äôs locked tighter than my trust issues.

If you stumble upon any rogue Mazda keys (with or without a fob, possibly smelling of bad decisions), please let me know. There may be a reward. Or at the very least, a really dramatic retelling of this saga over coffee.

Quirky social media gigs. Requests from strangers on the internet. Sometimes legit, mostly illegal.

I want to warn you about my latest venture. The premise is simple, but confusing: You are paid to answer calls, but you can only listen. If you talk back, if you say anything at all, you're done. 

Curious? So was I. But before I jump in, I want to set the scene for you. There's a lot of ground to cover, but I promise it'll be worth the wait. Let's start with the call center.

There‚Äôs a certain uneasiness in the building.

It‚Äôs not the lights, or the computers, or the AC rumbling through the white paneled ceiling. It‚Äôs deeper than that. A quiet, unnerving buzz. The longer you are here, the easier it gets. But the feeling never quite goes away. It just gets buried. Deeper and deeper into that steel case you call your mind.

You‚Äôd be surprised how many people there are in this office. It‚Äôs quiet. But it isn‚Äôt silent. Never silent. If you sit still long enough, if you really listen, you can hear them. The **voices**. The steady rhythm of desperation. Cries, pleas, whispers, screams. They‚Äôre not loud. Not loud enough to disturb anyone. Just soft enough to make your skin crawl. Like a bad feeling you can‚Äôt place.

They‚Äôre not coming from the workers. They‚Äôre pouring out of the phones. The never-ending sea of desperate callers ringing in day-after-day. Every call is different. Every voice is different. But the words? The stories? Always the same.

‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù they say. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know where I am. Something is outside the door. I need help.‚Äù

But no one responds. No one ever does.

Two cubes down, Martha‚Äîthat‚Äôs what I call her‚Äîis filling out a crossword. She taps her acrylic nails against her desk like she‚Äôs typing away at an invisible keyboard. Then there is Debbie‚Äîagain, not her name. But she seems like a Debbie. She is tall, brunette, and eating the same cheap parfait she brings in everyday. I think it‚Äôs strawberry flavored.

Nobody talks here. Not out loud. Not unless they still want to work here.

We don‚Äôt wear name tags. We don‚Äôt introduce ourselves. We don‚Äôt even wear our own faces. Everyone‚Äôs assigned a mask. Not the sanitary kind. Not the Halloween kind either. They‚Äôre...corporate. Sleek, smooth, almost artistic. I would describe it as a masquerade-style mask‚Äîwithout the usual glitter and tassels. They start just below the forehead and stop just above the mouth.¬†

They say it‚Äôs part of the experiment.

What experiment? Nobody really knows. That‚Äôs kind of the whole point. We‚Äôre not here to understand. We‚Äôre here to follow instructions.

Answer the call. Don‚Äôt say anything. Let them speak. Let them scream. Let them beg. Just sit there with the phone pressed to your ear and listen until the line goes dead. That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs the job.

It seems cheap‚Äîgimmicky almost. Like we‚Äôre apart of the latest reality tv series where camera men are hiding in bushes with ulterior motives.

I thought the same at first. But if there is something that doesn‚Äôt lie, it‚Äôs money. And lots of it.

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here.

I‚Äôm Ariana. Nineteen years old. College dropout. A few semesters in, then I quit. *Way* too much debt, too little hope. Credit cards stacked like a tower ready to fall. I spent weeks scouring every corner of the internet for something‚Äîanything‚Äîthat could get me back on my feet, even if just for a while.

That‚Äôs when Mabel introduced me to her profession.

Mabel was unique. Always dressed sharp‚Äînice car, good career, Chanel bag casually tossed over her shoulder. A very independent woman. She lived in the city, paid her own bills, and did whatever the hell she wanted to. She was fun, serious, and motivating all at once.

We have been friends for a while now, but she always kept me at arms length. Sure we would go out and have a nice time together. Bond over past relationships and mutual interests. But there was something mysterious about her. She never really talked about her work. I assumed it was drugs or some kind of shady side hustle. It wasn‚Äôt like her to keep secrets.

But when she saw how down on my luck I was, she took pity.

Handed me a business card. And then, just as quickly, told me she never gave me that card. ‚ÄúIf anyone asks you, I didn‚Äôt give you that card. You don‚Äôt know Mabel and Mabel don‚Äôt know you,‚Äù she said sharply. Apparently that was against the company‚Äôs rules. Nobody can know anyone else who works there.

I was confused. But curious.

I called the number. A voice answered. Cold. Mysterious. They asked me two questions.

‚ÄúDo you break under pressure?‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you know anyone else who works here?‚Äù

I said no and no.

That was it. No background check, no references. Didn‚Äôt even ask to see the resume I carefully prepared for the occasion.

They gave me an address and a time. Simple as that.

The onboarding was just as strange as everything else. You‚Äôd think I was signing up for some military program or a secret government project. Everyone was tight-lipped. No smiling. No small talk.

The rules were simple. And unsettling.

1. Arrive at the building exactly when your shift starts. Not a minute early, not a minute late.
2. Keep your mask on the entire time. No exceptions.
3. Don‚Äôt identify yourself. Don‚Äôt try to identify anyone else.
4. Do not respond or speak to the caller on the other end of the line.

It felt odd to say the least.

But I kept telling myself it was just one big experiment. They‚Äôre paying for data, not for us to help anyone. We‚Äôre not really answering calls. We‚Äôre the product. Being fed to someone or something higher up the chain.

That is what the assessors say at least. Assessors are basically glorified managers. People with a flashy degree and people skills that tell you the voices aren‚Äôt real. That the people on the other end aren‚Äôt people at all. They're artificial, synthetic. Part of the test and nothing more.

‚ÄúSimulations,‚Äù they say. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not hurting anyone. It‚Äôs about resilience. Exposure therapy. Mental strength.‚Äù

Sure buddy.

I don‚Äôt know what they are. I refuse to believe they are people. It wouldn‚Äôt make sense. But they don‚Äôt act like simulations either. They don‚Äôt sound fake. They sob. They stutter. They beg for their kids. They talk about the thing outside the closet, or the eyes under the bed, or monster outside their window.

You sit there. You listen. You grip your pen tighter and tighter until the call drops out or the screaming stops or there‚Äôs that awful, sudden silence like something just grabbed the person out of existence.

Then you breathe. You clear your throat. And the phone rings again.

You pick up.

I‚Äôve been here eight months now. Not long. But long enough to know the rhythm. This job isn‚Äôt about smarts or motivation‚Äîit‚Äôs about routine. Muscle memory. You have to build your own little rhythm. Listening to terror all day eats at you‚Äîbreaks you down slowly. I‚Äôve seen it happen. New masks come in wide-eyed and curious, and by month two they‚Äôre breaking rules or just gone.

My routine is pretty straightforward at this point. I get in at 6:45 a.m. sharp. Same elevator. Same gray carpet. Same cubicle by the fire exit.

I don‚Äôt speak to anyone.

It‚Äôs safer that way‚Äîchatter is dangerous for me and for whoever‚Äôs already picking up calls.

At 7:00 a.m., my phone activates. The light goes on. Not a ring, never a ring.

Just the light.

Blue means wait. Red means answer. And when it‚Äôs red, you answer.

You don‚Äôt greet them. You don‚Äôt ask questions. You just listen.

And what you hear‚Ä¶

Well.

They‚Äôre always running.

Always hiding.

Always being chased by something they can‚Äôt quite describe.

A little boy whispering, saying something is scratching at his door. His mom won‚Äôt wake up.

A woman panting, saying she‚Äôs in the stairwell. Something is coming up behind her fast and the police aren‚Äôt answering her calls anymore.

A man with a crushed voice, locked in a closet. He mutters that he hears footsteps pacing back and forth, right outside, stopping every time he breathes.

Different voices. Same panic.

Some of them say they‚Äôre in a hallway. Or a small bedroom. Or under a sink.

Sometimes they describe this building.

The call center.

They‚Äôll mention glass double doors. Or the color of the carpet. Or the smell of coffee from a nearby break room.

Sometimes they describe the workers.

‚ÄúYou have a mask,‚Äù they‚Äôll say.

‚ÄúBlack gloves‚ÄîI know you. You can help me.‚Äù

Then they scream.

We‚Äôre not supposed to react. Not even a twitch. I‚Äôve gotten pretty good at it‚Äîneutral face, steady hands. A woman once asked me to sing to her while something chewed its way through her front door. I didn‚Äôt. But I wanted to.

It sticks to you. Even after the call ends. Especially then.

We all handle it differently. Food, puzzles, fidgeting‚Äîanything to let out the tension.¬†

To cope, I sketch what they describe. Not out of interest or enjoyment‚Äîjust release. Macabre, maybe, but it makes the images leave my head a little faster.

Dark figures. Tall shadows. Doorways broken and bloody.

A lot of staircases.

And then, just when I start to forget‚Äî

The light turns red again.

The first few days were the hardest. But then my first check came in.

After just one month on the job, I paid off my student loans. That crushing weight finally lifted. I felt like I could breathe again.

A month later, I bought my first car‚Äîused, but reliable. Then I paid off my credit card debt. For the first time in years, the numbers in my bank account weren‚Äôt a burden I needed to figure out.

Now? I live in a multi-bedroom loft right in the city. The kind of place with exposed brick walls and big windows that let in way too much sunlight. I‚Äôm driving the car I used to drool over in magazines‚Äîthe one I thought I‚Äôd never afford.

The money washes away the guilt at this point. Synthetic, manufactured guilt. Like a fresh coat of paint covering the grime beneath. Except the grime is just as processed as the paint at this point.

Maybe that was the point all along. Just an expensive, extravagant experiment. A cold, corporate bet that people will do almost anything for the right amount of cash‚Äîeven if it means listening to fake snuff calls for hours on end.

That‚Äôs what I told myself. The calls were just noise. Background static to the paycheck.

Until I heard something I never expected.

It was a Tuesday afternoon. I was halfway through my shift‚Äîeyes drifting between the crossword puzzle I‚Äôd started yesterday and the dull glow of my screen. I was a little hungover, my head still fuzzy from last night‚Äôs bad decisions. Maybe that‚Äôs why I was so caught off guard. Maybe that is why I made this horrible mistake.

The phone turned red, I picked up instinctively‚Äîmy eyes still fixed on the crossword puzzle.

‚ÄúHello? Is anyone there? I‚ÄîI need help.‚Äù

The voice was faint but unmistakable.

It was her.

Mabel.

For a split second, I forgot where I was. Thought maybe I‚Äôd picked up my personal phone by mistake. My heart started to hammer.

‚ÄúMabel?‚Äù I whispered before I could stop myself.

The room was quiet. Not just the usual quiet of the call center, but something heavier, thicker. Like the room was holding its breath. I felt eyes on me‚Äîdozens of masked faces turned in my direction, watching. Waiting. I felt my face go red as hot embarrassment washed over me. I ducked my head below my cubicle wall‚Äîphone still pressed to my ear.

Shit. I was done.

Then Mabel spoke again.

‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶ Ariana?‚Äù

I wanted to hang up, but something stopped me. I just didn‚Äôt understand‚Äîwhy was Mabel on the line? I‚Äôve heard hundreds of simulated voices plead and beg for a response. I never imagined it could sound like someone you know. I was already reaching to hang up, but she said something strange.

Something‚Ä¶unexpected.

‚ÄúOh no‚Ä¶ no, no, no,‚Äù she stammered, voice trembling with confusion.

A cold shiver crawled down my spine. This wasn‚Äôt the Mabel I knew.

Then she started laughing.

Not the light, friendly laugh I remembered.

A manic, broken laugh.

It didn‚Äôt stop.

I slammed the phone down.

I spun around, heart racing‚Äîand there she was.

A member of HR. Standing just at the edge of my cubicle. Black mask, notepad in hand. Expression unreadable.

She motioned for me to follow.

No words.

Just a slow, deliberate walk toward her office.

I sat down in the stiff plastic chair across from her desk, my mind still reeling. The call played on a loop in my head. The voice. The laugh. The way it sounded exactly like Mabel. I couldn‚Äôt stop shaking.

‚ÄúYou broke the rules. Yes?‚Äù she asked flatly, scribbling in her notepad without looking up.

‚ÄúYes, but‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYou understand this means you are terminated from the call center, correct?‚Äù

She cut me off with such finality, like it was scripted. Like she was reciting lines from a procedure manual.

‚ÄúI recognized her,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThe voice. I thought I picked up my own phone by accident. I thought maybe it wasn‚Äôt even‚Äî‚Äù

That made her pause. She looked up for the first time. Her eyes were sharp behind the mask, almost disappointed. Or was it fear?

‚ÄúYou thought what?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt sounded like someone I knew. A friend of mine.‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt write anything down now. Just stared at me.

‚ÄúWhen you first applied to this job, you answered two questions. Do you remember them?‚Äù

I hesitated. My stomach turned.

‚ÄúThey asked if I was good under pressure. And if I knew anyone who worked here.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd how did you answer?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. I said no to both.‚Äù

She stared a moment longer, then slowly ripped a sheet of paper from her pad and slid it across the desk.

‚ÄúYou are hereby terminated from this experiment. You can collect your final check at the location printed on this slip. You‚Äôve also been granted a severance equivalent to one month‚Äôs salary.‚Äù

I blinked at her. ‚ÄúWait‚Äîthat‚Äôs all?‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt respond. Just went back to typing. Like I wasn‚Äôt there anymore.

No explanation. No follow-up about the call. No mention of what I heard. Just a polite termination and a severance bonus.

I grabbed the paper without reading it and stormed out‚Äîpast the rows of silent, masked employees, past the flickering overhead lights, and out into the daylight. I was halfway to my car when I realized I hadn‚Äôt even removed my mask.

I didn‚Äôt look back.

I felt everything over the next few days. Sadness, anger, confusion. Like my body kept going through the motions but my mind was stuck on a loop. That voice on the other end of the call. The thing that sounded like Mabel. I didn‚Äôt know what I was supposed to believe anymore.

On the second day, I caved and called her. Straight to voicemail.

That was weird. We were supposed to hang out next weekend‚Äîmaybe grab drinks and vent about the call center. Mabel never ghosted me. Not even when she was sick or pissed or going through it. Something was off.

By the third day, I decided I needed to get out of the house. Clear my head. The address they gave me for my severance package wasn‚Äôt far, so I drove out.

It led me to a hotel. One of those upscale downtown places with giant flower arrangements and staff that wore gloves. I didn‚Äôt even see a front desk‚Äîjust a wall of private mailboxes near the back. The code they gave me worked. The lock clicked open, and inside was a check. Neatly folded, like it had just been printed.

I left and crossed the street to the parking garage where I‚Äôd left my car. As I reached the elevator, I paused. There was someone standing on the sidewalk a little ways down, right outside the garage entrance.

Big blonde hair. Fur coat. Tall boots.

Mabel?

I stepped forward without thinking. Just a few feet‚Äîenough to get a better look. And that‚Äôs when I saw it wasn‚Äôt her.

Not really.

The thing looked like Mabel if she‚Äôd been made from melting wax. Too tall. Limping slightly. Her skin hung off her face in folds, sagging like old leather. Her mouth was slack. Her eyes‚Äî

God, her eyes.

Two hollow pits ringed with tiny, sharp, teeth. Her hands were worse. Loose skin, twisted fingers bent at angles that didn‚Äôt make sense. And yet people kept walking past her like she wasn‚Äôt there. They moved around her, avoided bumping into her, like she had a presence. She took up space, but no one looked. Not directly.

They didn‚Äôt see her. Not really. If they did, they would have been as terrified as I was.

The elevator behind me dinged and the doors opened. I ran inside, slammed the ‚Äúclose door‚Äù button with shaking fingers. As the doors slid shut, I heard footsteps on the concrete. Slow. Deliberate. Getting closer.

Too close.

I didn‚Äôt look. I didn‚Äôt want to see her again.

The elevator dropped me off a few floors up. I got in my car and drove. Fast. Too fast. Every red light felt like a trap. Every time I glanced out my window, I expected to see her there on the sidewalk. Moving along in slow, rhythmic motion like a snail wearing human skin.

I called a few friends on the way home. Just to hear voices. I didn‚Äôt tell them what I saw. Didn‚Äôt want to sound insane.

But I felt insane.

All those desperate calls I‚Äôve been ignoring‚Äîmonth after month of people screaming and crying and begging‚Äîand now it‚Äôs like the floodgates have opened. Everything‚Äôs pouring in at once.

Maybe I was having a breakdown. That‚Äôs what I kept telling myself. Listening to pain and anguish everyday will do that to you.

I just needed rest. Some air. Maybe a little trip. I had money now. Enough to disappear for a few days. Clear my head.

And if I still didn‚Äôt feel right afterward, I‚Äôd find a therapist.

God knows I probably needed one anyway.

I took a detour from my apartment elevator to stroll through the lobby. I wanted to grab a few snacks from the shop beside the front desk before settling in for the night. I needed a bottle or two of something strong to drown out the sadness from my termination from the call center. I was crossing the front desk when I caught sight of something in the corner of my eye.

I turned, and there it was again.

Mabel. Walking toward me from the lobby entrance.

The sight gave me chills, but that feeling passed quickly.

I felt steadier after the drive. More level headed. I wasn‚Äôt afraid.

I was annoyed. This wasn‚Äôt real. It had to be some elaborate prank. Or a figment of my imagination. Either way, it couldn‚Äôt hurt me. I just needed to prove it to myself.

I looked around. Everyone else was just walking past. I held my hands out, desperate.

‚ÄúReally? Nobody else is seeing this?‚Äù

I took a few deep breaths and started toward it.

‚ÄúHey sir‚Äîwhy are you following me?‚Äù I called out.

The thing didn‚Äôt say anything. Just kept lurching forward.

I stopped a few feet in front of it. The smell hit me first‚Äîsour, rotten. I winced at the sight of the bloated figure writhing and convulsing under its cheap Mabel disguise.

‚ÄúDid you hear me? This isn‚Äôt funny, creep. I‚Äôm going to get security‚Äî‚Äù

*Chomp*.

A mouth. It tore open from the thing‚Äôs stomach and bit off the finger I was waving at its chest. Just like that. Gone.

I staggered back, screaming, clutching the bloody stump where my finger used to be. It kept limping forward. I screamed louder. Begging for help.

No one looked. No one even paused.

I turned and bolted toward the stairs, blood dripping behind me. I was halfway up when I heard the stairway entrance slam open.

It was coming.

I reached my floor and sprinted down the hall. Fumbled my key out of my purse with trembling, bloody hands. Got the door open. Locked it behind me. I backed away until my spine hit the wall at the other end of the apartment.

I pulled my phone out and started dialing 911 with my good hand.

Ring tone. Then silence.

No connection?

I checked my service. Full bars.

This didn‚Äôt make any sense.

I called friends. Family. My hairstylist. Nothing. No ring tone. Just silence.

I cursed and rushed to the peephole.

Nothing out there. Not yet. Just a wide, empty hallway.

Blood was getting everywhere. I could feel my heartbeat in my hand from all the pain and swelling. I stumbled into my bedroom, wrapped my finger to stop the bleeding, and popped a few painkillers. Once that was taken care of, I sat at my desk and opened my laptop. Tried to get online. Email. Social media. Anything.

Blank screen. No connection.

I sat down and cried. I didn‚Äôt understand what was happening.

Something was wrong. Not just with that thing in the hallway. Not just with me.

Reality itself was broken.

No one could hear me. No one could reach me. No one cared.

I was isolated. Trapped.

Food for something that wore my friend‚Äôs skin.

Maybe that was all that was left of her.

Then, it was here.

I heard a few limping footsteps outside the door. The light underneath the front door was stifled by something large standing outside it. I held my breath. Waiting. But nothing happened. It just sat there. Doing nothing.

I grabbed a knife and waited. It was bound to come in at some point. But it didn‚Äôt.

Hours passed. It was well into the night and the shadow was still there. It didn‚Äôt make sense.

I fumbled with my phone. I needed to get in contact with someone. I knew it was futile but I had to try again.

But then, I heard something.

Not from the phone‚Äîfrom the door.

It was Mabel.

‚ÄúHey‚Ä¶Ariana? I‚Äôm here. I need your help.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt move. I didn‚Äôt speak. It was her voice. But it sounded wet. Guttural. Like it was her whispering through the mouth of a corpse.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ignore me. Say something. Anything? I need to know you‚Äôre okay.‚Äù

It was monotone. No concern in its voice.

I carefully walked to my bedroom.

Then, a loud bang.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt walk away from me, Ariana. Talk. To. Me.‚Äù

The voice was deeper now. Less Mabel. More... something else.

I pushed my door closed with a soft click and covered my ears as a barrage of loud bangs broke out across the apartment. I heard them everywhere. My door. The ceiling above. The windows facing the city below.

The sound passed after an hour.

My body was so tired at this point. Partly exhaustion, partly the blood loss from my missing finger. I barricaded my door, clutched my phone, and rested my eyes in the empty bed.

I slept maybe an hour or two before something woke me.

I sprang up and looked toward the bedroom door. The shadow was under my bedroom door now. It had somehow gotten into my apartment.

It was standing there the same way it had outside.

But now it was here.

I realized I couldn‚Äôt escape this thing. Whatever it was, it was going to get me. Slowly but surely. It had no issue entering my apartment. It would have no problem breaking into my room. Maybe it was toying with me. Maybe it enjoyed the chase. I felt panic wash over me.¬†

‚ÄúLeave me alone!‚Äù I screamed.

I heard a soft laugh break out just outside the door.

I returned to my phone. Started calling everyone in my contact list again.

Silence every time. Like the world outside my apartment building just vanished.

Then I realized something.

I realized the silence didn‚Äôt mean the calls were failing.

They were going through.

Every time.

No ringing, no static‚Äîjust quiet. Someone on the other end was always there. Always listening.

It was the call center.

Every call I made‚Ä¶was routed straight back to the center.

I only figured it out because of a tiny, almost imperceptible sound‚Äîone you‚Äôd miss if you weren‚Äôt desperate enough to listen for it.

A spoon, scraping the bottom of a plastic parfait cup.

Debbie.

From work.

‚ÄúDebbie?‚Äù I said into the phone.

No response.

Of course not. Debbie wasn‚Äôt her name. Just the one I gave her. None of us knew each other‚Äôs names. That‚Äôs how they designed it. Masks. Code numbers. Shift schedules that barely overlapped.

‚ÄúHey‚ÄîI know you. Well‚Ä¶ not know you, but we work together. Please. Just say something. I think you can help me.‚Äù

Still nothing.

And that‚Äôs when it hit me.

They wouldn‚Äôt answer.

Not ever.

They couldn‚Äôt.

We don‚Äôt speak. Not to them.

It didn‚Äôt matter what I said. How much I begged and cried. And could I really blame her? I ignored hundreds of calls just like this.

That is when I broke.

I started laughing.

Loud, cracked, borderline hysterical. The same kind of laugh I heard from Mabel, that day she realized the truth. That she was calling the same people she sat next to every day. That none of us said a word. Not when it mattered.

It was real.

All of it.

Real people.

Real demons.

God, those poor people. Men, women, and children. The poor children.¬†

The creature outside went quiet during my breakdown. Maybe it enjoyed my pain. Maybe it was hoping I‚Äôd walk out, still broken, right into its jaws.

Once the laughter died and I steadied my breathing, I felt a strange mental clarity. Could‚Äôve been the painkillers. Or sleep deprivation. Either way, I had an idea.

If they respond, the creature moves on.

That was my theory. I never got confirmation from Mabel, but she had tried it. She screamed into the phone until someone broke the rules. And the thing left her alone‚Äîat least that was the hope.¬†

I needed to get someone to answer. To break the rules. Like Mabel did. Like I did.

I wracked my brain for anything I knew about the people I worked with. Something‚Äîanything‚Äîthat could crack their armor.

Then it hit me‚ÄîMartha.

She was always working during my shift. The one with the crossword puzzles and clacking acrylics. The only reason she came to mind was because I knew something about her I shouldn‚Äôt. We do our best to hide our identities‚Äîbut every now and then something slips out. A phrase, the flash of a text on your personal phone, the hint of a tattoo.

Her mistake was much more telling‚Äîand easy to forget. One day I saw a brochure sticking out of her purse. Assisted living facility. I recognized the name. My mom had looked into it for my grandfather once. Nice place. Private rooms. Big windows. Expensive. Probably why Martha took the job.

I grabbed the phone.

Started dialing. Random numbers. Cold calling the call center. Over and over. Same silent line. Same hollow weight.

I listened for her.

I waited for the familiar tap of nails on the cheap plastic desk. Fast, plasticky little clicks.

Call. Hang up. Call. Hang up.

Nothing.

Was Martha even on rotation today?

I started to feel hopeless.

Outside the room, the door handle started to twitch. A soft rattle, like someone trying to figure out the lock.

It would be in here soon.

Then‚ÄîI heard it. The clacking of nails.

I prepped the script in my mind.

I had one chance.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I said in the calmest voice I could manage.

No answer.

I take another shaky breath before continuing.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm calling because your family member at Woodbrook‚Äôs is in the middle of a situation here.‚Äù

I hoped this was the right angle. During my time working there, every call was frantic‚Äîdesperate. Just like me. But I couldn‚Äôt show it. Not if I expected this to work. Nobody at the call center would expect something so calm and collected.

The clacking stopped. I had her attention.¬†

Now I needed to drive it home.

‚ÄúSorry to call this line. Someone at the call center said it was your work line? I just need to confirm some information. Let‚Äôs start with your last name.‚Äù

I bit my tongue as the door began to unlock. It creaked open slowly. The barricade of furniture slid across the floor like it was a pile of empty boxes.

I put my hand over my mouth to stifle a scream.

What stood there wasn‚Äôt wearing Mabel‚Äôs skin anymore. That was gone‚Äîsloughed off like wet clothing. What remained was something raw. A bundle of dark flesh. Tentacles and mouths writhing in slow, deliberate motion. Snapping. Smacking. Clicking wetly against each other. They turned toward me slowly. The bundle of wiry flesh writhed towards me in unison.

I closed my eyes and tried to keep my voice level.

‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, this is an emergency. If I don‚Äôt get a directive right now I will need to call 911‚Äî‚Äù

I felt warmth descending upon my face. A hundred little mouths breathing on my skin in anticipation.

Then‚Äîshe spoke.

‚ÄúIs my mom okay?‚Äù she asked.

The sound of her voice felt like a lifeline being caught in the middle of the ocean.

I opened my eyes. To my surprise, the thing was gone. I caught just the tip of a black tendril vanishing around the corner toward my front door.

I grabbed the phone again. ‚ÄúListen‚Äîthis isn‚Äôt Woodbrook. I used to work with you. Something‚Äôs coming for you. The call center, it intercepts your calls, you need to get someone to respond‚Äî‚Äù

The line went dead.

I stood there, useless. I didn‚Äôt even know her name. Didn‚Äôt know what she looked like. And yet, I may have just sentenced her to a fate worse than what happened to me. Or Mabel.

I felt sick.

I didn‚Äôt leave my apartment for weeks.

I needed time to process everything.

I‚Äôm in a better headspace now. You can thank a lot of expensive therapy for that.

I got into this job for the money. I didn‚Äôt care about the calls. I told myself they were fake. But that was a lie.

The truth is‚ÄîI was desperate.

I don‚Äôt know if I would‚Äôve taken the job if I‚Äôd known what was really going on. Honestly, I probably still would‚Äôve. That‚Äôs what scares me.

But now? I have a new purpose. A better one.

I‚Äôm going to end the call center.

I don‚Äôt know how yet. But I‚Äôm working on it. I owed it to Mabel. And Martha.

I don‚Äôt care if I go broke. If I lose everything. There are more important things than money in this life.

And this place is going to learn that the hard way.

Until then, you‚Äôve been warned. Don‚Äôt accept a job from the call center that ignores desperate people. 

Real people.

Scared people being chased by a real threat. I managed to make it out. But most people won‚Äôt be so lucky. Most people will be hiding in their homes. Crying. Pleading. Begging a bunch of corporate morons in masks to save them from something truly evil.¬†

But if you already work in a place like the call center, it isn‚Äôt too late. If you can help, help. Don‚Äôt sit idly by and listen to injustice. Don‚Äôt let the corporations tell you it‚Äôs all synthetic garbage. Use your own judgement. Be kind. Be curious. You may just save someone‚Äôs [life](https://www.reddit.com/user/mythic_melon/comments/1lqv3vh/links_and_stuff_shameless_plug/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).",16,1753381550.0,nosleep,5,0.94,False

1m8c6b7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m8c6b7,4 nights camping from Reno => Redwoods => Crater Lake,"This was our longest trip of the year. We camp about every other weekend over the Summer. My wife and I drove from Reno and stayed at Hipcamps (more on this later). 2nd time taking our truck out so we're dialing in the setup. An 8' x 10' Springbar tent and Exped megamat are our defining pieces lol. First time in Oregon and cant wait to see more.

**Trip Report**

Day 1: Reno to Cave Junction. Setup camp and drank micheladas.  

Day 2: Left for Crescent City. Bounced around the north coast and did short hikes around the Redwoods.

Day 3: Tore down and left for camp #2 in Prospect, Oregon. Found a great day use area called  Joseph Stewart County Recreation Area. Setup and drank an old fashioned.

Day 4: Crater Lake all day. MY GOODNESS what an amazing place. That ham sandwich for lunch was incredible. Grateful to experience it on a Tuesday. I cannot imagine how nuts a summer weekend would be.

Day 5: Packed up and drove home. 

**Cooking**

We really enjoy cooking a great dinner at camp. Managed to pack all of our food and only purchased a single pack of little debbies on the way home.  Crab cakes for night 1 is an underrated camp food. Grabbed them from Whole Foods. Really good, easy to fry up and clean up. Made a batch of Hawaiian mac salad, chicken tinga, steak tacos and finally brats. Pop tarts for breakfast, ham+cheese for lunch and ruffles with dip for snacks. 

I can go on about camp cooking but for anyone wanting to elevate their stuff the trick is not getting overwhelmed by the planning/prep/cleaning. We stick to 'no/low cook' breakfast, lunch and ingredients that work with multiple meals. Eggs are great for leftovers. We made too much tinga, so one morning we cracked a few eggs and had tinga ""breakfast nachos"". Freeze all your proteins so they thaw slowly in the cooler. If you want to keep clutter down, do not go impulse crazy on buying snacks. (no kids to worry about for us)

I made one of those Stanley Lunchbox coffee/cocktail kits and kept it separate from the other kitchen bin. This allows you to make coffee and not block the camp pack out by needing everything together. OR you can set your tent up and make a cheeky step two real quick.

  
**HipCamps**

This was our 7th Hipcamp this year.  Currently on a run of 'highly rated' yet underwhelming experiences. Similar to AirBnb, we've soured on them. Paying double for fancy photos and ease of booking. I'm going to save the details because it was an amazing trip in spite of the camps. Do not overspend on these thinking the amenities are anything special or the other campers are going to be any different than a typical campground.

**Setup**

With a truck bed we utilized 40 gallon totes and fit smaller totes inside for organization. It worked great. Spent 10 years camping in hatchbacks, it feels nice to pack comfortably but we'll dial this in. I'd like to add a bigger water reservoir for the truck bed next year. Maybe with a shower head. 

Used a single butane burner that packed up small. We blew through the gas faster than expected. We can fill our 5lb bottle of propane cheaper than buying one of the butane cans. The butane burner will work great for canoe trips.

I've been out for about a year after 2 decades of slowly worsening shelf-sagging. The past year has been a deep-dive into all the problematic history and all the problems that still exist today. I'm shocked i never knew this stuff before. I feel like I'm totally out now, but every now and then I run into something where I realize my perspective is still heavily influenced by my mormon upbringing. 

Like, deep down I still feel alcohol is bad even though my brain doesn't think that and I will occasionally have a drink. Same with coffee. Sundays still feel like I should stay home and have a quiet, reflective day even though my brain tells me Sunday is just a normal day. 

So, how long did it take for you to get through the decades of indoctrination? What things were hardest to shake when you finally left?

The proverbial 'early bird' still hasn't woken up, and the worm is safe and sound to move around. Johnathan was transfixed on an invisible horizon visible only from his bed.

Dark, smooth ceiling is what Johnathan saw, plain and simple. No ceiling fans or sheep jumping across his vision to save him from his wakefulness, this unrelenting energy that held him captive for countless hours. ""Insomniac"" the tests results had read when he was younger, back before he was living on his own. Back then, Johnathan could count on his parents to wake and take him to doctors appointments, and to get him there on time. He couldn't get anywhere on time it seemed these days, one moment it was morning and the next it was midnight 3 days later, and bills stamped with OVERDUE streamed in the mailbox. Johnathan had a brief moment of clarity as he thought back on a previous doctor's appointment he had managed to actually show on time for several weeks ago.

The memory trickled into view, the fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, the crinkle of the paper he was sitting on rang in his ears. A gruff, tired voice stole his attention, ""I shouldn't need to remind you Mr.Schuler, but I'll say this again, the medicine can't help you from inside the bottle, you need to take it out and actually USE the medicine I prescribe."" The doctor had waggled his purple gloved finger at Johnathan when he had said it, although both patient and doctor should've known it was a fruitless endeavor, as Johnathan struggled to remember what he even had for breakfast mere hours before, or that he even had this appointment. Johnathan lived on his own after leaving his hometown to be more independent and was immediately struck by the reality that without his family nearby, he couldn't possibly function as a ""proper adult"" as his father had put it bluntly.

A fresh memory pushed it's way to the front of Johnathan's mind, bubbling and pushing other thoughts away. ""No plan! No effort! You just 'go with the flow!'"", his father shouted, stomping emphatically in the kitchen, the somber grey sky lighting him in silhouette, ""that's no life to live Johnathan! You're capable of so much more and yet you live in a daze, what are you possibly going to do with your life?"" A heavy moment passed between the men, broken by a thoughtless truth. ""I don't know... I have never known what I wanted!"" Johnathan spat, tears welling into his eyes as both the realization of who he had yelled at and the truth behind his words hit him. ""I'm going outside"" Johnathan said bitterly, his lip quivering in anger and sadness. He walked away from his father, out the back door and spent nearly an hour failing to collect himself. Tears welled in his eyes as the gravity of the exchange weighed him down to Earth and then some. He had no idea what he wanted, and he felt wrong for it, broken even. His want WAS to want something, but that wasn't enough. The memory rapidly faded as his watch beeped, immediately ripping Johnathan back to his bed, back to the bland ceiling he was stuck looking at.

Insomnia, as he had been diagnosed with, was terrible. It wasn't bad enough he couldn't sleep when he needed to, but when his body tried to, his mind would hold him hostage. He had tried all the old remedies from relatives and online forums, the sleep-aid medicine, the shot of whiskey before bed, the teas, oh the teas had been horrible, no matter what type it was nor the honey contained within them. Johnathan stayed far away from caffeine, no energy drinks at work or morning coffees to turn to ritual in the wee hours of morning. When he did make it to work there were always comments from coworkers and customers alike, ""You look tired."" ""Someone stayed out to late, right buddy?"" they'd say with a smirk.  ""You should try \_\_\_\_\_!"" they solicited. Then they kept going with their lives, meanwhile Johnathan got less and less sleep per week. It did not affect his work, the shelves still got stocked, the product faced. When customers asked questions regarding the locations of products, Johnathan could still point them in the right direction.¬†

Johnathan blinked slowly, attempting to put the brakes on his brain. He focused on what he could sense in the room. He felt the weight of the comforter on his body, the pressure underneath his head from his overpriced pillow. He listened to the whoosh of hot air from the central heating vents. He inhaled deeply, smelling the lavender relaxation wax melts he had received as a gift on his birthday. He focused so hard on not focusing on anything that ultimately it did nothing. He gave up and wondered how many hours had passed.

Johnathan slowly turned his head towards his nightstand, an old faded wood veneered digital clock beamed the time in bright red LED lights.

1m8c2hc,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1m8c2hc/dear_rfb_from_jmc/,Dear RFB from JMC,"**Top Ten lessons from the two most difficult years of my life**  
I wanted to take a moment to write to you as the receiver of this letter. However, I do take comfort in the fact you'll never actually have the chance to read it seeing as you've decided---against all my preconceived notions of the general goodness of human kind --to be a generally distasteful person of low moral character.

I did learn a lot from being with you the last two years and I'd like to just lay it all out there for myself so I can look upon this in the future and not repeat the same mistakes. So, here are the top ten lessons I'm taking away from the 1.5 years we spent together and the 6 months on and off.

1. Relationships are only hard when only one person is putting in the effort.
   1. I'm not here to point fingers but I'm the one who went to therapy, got medicated, and took the effort to journal, reflect, advocate for us both, plan dates, bridge gaps in communication, and overall put the efforts towards building bridges when things got off kilter.
2. Screaming at your partner is not cool and never will be.
   1. This ones on me, admittedly, I lost my cool over the phone a few times when your character assassination dialogues would go on for what felt like an eternity -- with no discernable effort in doing anything other than criticize me for sport. Although that was wrong of you, I shouldn't have screamed.
3. If you have an issue with your partner, it's important to sit with it for a time, journal, meditate on it, and then talk it out with them.
   1. The caveat to this is that your partner has to be receptive. I will admit I brough up a fair bit of concerns more than you, HOWEVER, whenever I did you would deflect and stonewall in order to make sure nothing got resolved and I would remain subservient. Me being as stubborn and proud as I am, will not let that go and will persist because my relationships are¬†*extremely*¬†fucking important to me and I will always advocate to have a voice in them.
4. Kink/Poly/ENM are a fucking waste of time
   1. yeah it's fun and all but honestly I only ever wanted you. You are the most beautiful, sensual, and enticing woman I've ever been with. I never needed anyone else and I let my insecurities get the best of me after seeing the things you posted on reddit.
5. I need a partner who's able to re-assure me at times.
   1. lets face it, I'm a bit neurotic and anxious, sometimes the best way I solve issues is by bouncing off ideas from another person whether it be a friend/partner/etc. You were always extremely neutral and it left me in a constant tizzy of whether I'm doing the right thing or not. That fed into my insecurities I assure you.
6. Breaking up with a partner out of frustration is a no-no.
   1. This one should be extremely obvious but I'm not gonna lie, you were so extremely disrespectful to me at times I didn't know what else to do. Still, not right, and that's on me.
7. Your feelings DO NOT equal reality
   1. You moved, because you allegedly said I was ""stalking"" you. This is objectively false. During the times you claimed I was doing this, you would PURPOSELY park right outside my apartment on MY side of the street --don't worry I have video footage because I figured you were going to do something very stupid like file a false RO --which I will happily be dismantling in August. Not only that you goofball, you literally INVITED ME TO YOUR NEW APARTMENT.... the person you claimed was¬†*stalking*¬†you. You invited them to your new apartment and they assembled your furniture. Give me a fucking break LOL.
8. Outer beauty is not worth tolerating emotional immaturity.
   1. This one is a bit scathing I know, but I can only be completely honest in my writing. You are so stunning that in a room I would easily pick you over anyone, even say... Scarlett Johansson or something. You get the point.
   2. you're also extremely clever and quite intellectually sharp which I so appreciated because clearly I need the stimulus.
   3. But¬†*holy fuck*, you have so much unprocessed shame, guilt, and just overall low self worth that any ""perception"" of being viewed as anything other than flawless was met with violent pushback, gaslighting, deflection, and just childish behavior.
9. Don't date a woman who prides herself on her ability to fuck other people over,¬†*ESPECIALLY*, if they are chronically painting themselves as the victim in every scenario of their life.
   1. I know I know, another obvious one, but stupid me always wants to believe people are ultimately good and wouldn't do you any harm. Unfortunately, you've proven me extremely wrong, what with the false police reports, ruining my friendship of 10 years with Alex and ultimately going full YOKO ONO with my band.
10. You can't¬†*help*¬†who you fall in love with.
11. This has a double meaning. Despite EVERYTHING I said before, I was and still am¬†*absolutely*¬†and¬†*irrevocably*¬†head over heels for you. In fact, in therapy as I was recounting the acts of horror you enacted on me like spitting in my face and your overall psychotic behavior, I found myself¬†*GRINNING IN FONDNESS OF THE MEMORIES*. What the fuck is wrong with me. I find your fire¬†*extremely*¬†sexy but I will not tolerate any more disrespect in my life from you, or for anyone. In this time of isolation I've learned to value my peace and silence.
12. I think you can have that fire without using it as a cudgel against your partner. You can't ""*help*"" who you fall in love with as in, lets face it babe, you got fucking issues. I would've stood by you to figure all that out but between the sketchy behavior, the lies, the stonewalling, the suicide threats to control my actions, and everything else. You clearly have NO interest in helping yourself.

I wanted everything with you. I swear it on my Grandfathers grave (and you know how important he was to me). I wanted it all. The kids, the vineyard in the country, the occasionally kinky romp, the traveling the world, the quiet mornings and coffee, the vegan food bullshit, the concerts. I wanted to do it all with you. If you had shown any interest in taking A MODICUM of accountability for the things you did to me, I would've married you in a heartbeat. Maybe you knew that, and maybe that's¬†*why*¬†you sabotaged it.

You my love were my universe, and now I know I wasn't worth it for you. I loved you dearly, but you never loved me. Every gift you gave was an afterthought to quell my disappointment in your inability to show up. You gave me pacifiers, I showered you with depth and extravagance. I bought you and built you your own personal computer when you said your ex destroyed your last one, you got me a bag of¬†*protein bars.*

I stayed with you night after night thinking that you enjoyed closeness and intimacy (i did it for you). Little did I know! you were posting on reddit about how much you hated how much time I spent at your place and that I wasn't ""picking up after myself"" etc. etc. NONE of which was communicated to me, you just harbored quiet resentment for months. You're a grown ass fucking woman, speak up. It's fucking insane to me that someone would just sit in misery and start resenting someone else because of something they're not communicating.

Fuck....  
Anyway...

My insecurities were the nail in the coffin but you my dear never had any intent in building a functional relationship. You were just showing up and hopefully everything just worked out happy ever after, as long as it worked out for you and just you.

That's not a partnership, that's servitude. You and I come from different cultural backgrounds. I was willing to learn about yours, I ate with your family, I learned their names, I talked with them about their life and love and careers. I supported you and encouraged you for months to get out of that job you hated and only when I pushed you for the final time to PUT A DATE ON THE CALENDAR did you finally commit to it. Yet, you took all the credit. As if the hours and hours of venting you did to me as I supported you for months with an empathetic ear meant nothing to you. I supported your solo travels, and I encouraged you to be more independent when it came to validation. But no, you take my wisdom and you spit on it. You spit on it with delusions and self deceptions that you tell yourself so that you can continue this narrative of being a victim.

I showed up for you in all of the ways I wish you would've shown up for me. When you were sick I rubbed your feet, when you were tired I drew you a bath. When you worked too long of hours I would clean your apartment for you so you'd have some peace. When you were on your time of the month no matter the hour I would go to the convenience store and get you the pain relief you needed. Those acts were my way of showing you that you're worth me spending my free time lessening your burdens because you're important to me, and love.... You *never* had to¬†*ask me to do any of it,*¬†I did it because I loved you fiercely. I was attuned to your needs the way someone is when something is¬†*important*¬†to them.  Then you had the *gall* to say ""well I never asked you to do any of that"" as you would make complaints and I would solve your issues without being asked.  I wanted you in my life forever and I valued you. Too bad you were too fucking ignorant to see it.

Honey, we're in our 30's, time is running the fuck out to get your shit together. Well,¬†*whatever*, it's not for me to worry about anymore. Come end of August I'll reveal your lies and walk away with my head high. It brings me no pleasure to do so, because I so desperately wanted it to be you. But you felt the need to project your traumas and your past experiences on a man who treated you like a queen even when you behaved like a fucking brat. Your lies, your manipulations, your control tactics are coming to an end, I waited 100+ days but I will wait no more. You'll be fine though, you'll just do the same thing to the next man, because lets face it, you're intoxicating, and you can easily create this scenario over and over until you wake up one day, bored, bitter, and resentful for the way you cheated yourself out of living a genuine life. You'll look around at your empire of absence and feel a vast emptiness that no validation will ever fill. You will feel the black hole that I feel in my chest every time that I think of the nights I gazed longingly into your eyes and kissed you on the forehead even when you would demonize me and treat me like a monster for things I never did. It's not me though, and it never will be, you never loved me.  
Sayonara.

So anyway I found Perc Guatemala with roasting date of July 9 at Whole Foods. That‚Äôs alright.

I‚Äôm not a big fan of subscriptions before you all start rolling those out.
I almost always buy a bag of beans whenever I go on vacation to supplement the slim pickings I have been able to find. That‚Äôs more realistic‚Ä¶ driving to nearby cities occasionally. Still.. I‚Äôm looking for recommendations.

Edit: The idea here was to find a group. Suggesting places that I‚Äôve already been to isn‚Äôt really what I had hoped for. If you like the place, then what bean and how fresh was it? Was it a light roast?

Yet, when I've reached out (through various avenues), a coffee has taken up to 2 years to organize (I'm not joking), barely any follow up effort, ghosting, flaking, and so on still persist. Or a 'check in' after 6 months, only to vanish again.

Then we are told to get off apps and meet people in person and find things in common. I've done this, and its the same thing, you are just ghosted more nicely if anything haha. This includes hookups, I've found it extremely transactional here, even with so-called 'coupled up' dudes (who you would assume would be better at intimacy). It is much worse than any other country I've been laid in, and yet this is supposed to be the 'mecca' of the gay world. I've literally met dudes from the same country as me, similar work/other experiences as me, sharing of woes, everything, and still, 99% of things fizzle out.

I just don't get it. I am literally scratching my head wondering if I am living in some metaverse of NY, as 3 years in, this has not been a great experience in terms of gay life (but otherwise its been great).

I totally get people have busy lives, economy, all of it, but really if you want to make time to connect with someone, I just don't get why this is so hard.

The whey powder can slide into a few types of baked goods I make, and the skim milk powder is for when I make yogurt.

That said, I've recently been experimenting with whey powder and coffee. I often don't get enough protein, so my thought was if I could slide a quick 7g into a cup of coffee by adding 1 Tbsp of whey powder to it, I should do that. 

It's a bit tricky, because if you're not careful, the coffee can and will cook the protein and the result will be ick. So it's essential to mix the powder with a bit of water, then add the coffee. When done correctly, the result looks like a coffee with foam on top.

An alternative I tried today was to do 1 Tbsp protein, plus 1 Tbsp milk powder, plus 1-2 Tbsp water. Mixy-mixy, add coffee, and you get something that's more like a latte with foam on top.

I generally take my coffee black, so I don't add any syrups or sweeteners, but these experiments seem like a good springboard for folks who do like those things to add them in.

1m8bwt8,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBagCheck/comments/1m8bwt8/explore_whether_briggs_riley_essential_carryon/,Explore whether Briggs & Riley Essential Carry-On Luggage lives up to the hype review,"Briggs & Riley BLU122CX-4 Essential Carry-On‚ÄîTesting Its Limits

Traveling frequently means my luggage needs to handle everything from crowded overhead bins to unforgiving airport floors. The Briggs & Riley BLU122CX-4 Essential Carry-On seemed like an ideal companion, combining durability with thoughtful features. I had the opportunity to test it on multiple trips, and here‚Äôs a breakdown based on my firsthand experience.

**Design and Build Quality**

One thing I immediately appreciated was its sturdy build. The black finish with sleek lines looks as premium as it feels. At 22 inches by 14 inches by 9 inches, it fits most domestic airline carry-on standards‚Äîeven when fully packed. Its ballistic nylon exterior resists wear and stains, a huge plus after accidentally spilling coffee on it (and yes, it wiped off easily without leaving a mark). 

The integrated bottom fabric handle is an underappreciated feature‚Äîit made quick grabs from the trunk much easier. Paired with the telescoping Outsider handle, it felt natural to maneuver. It‚Äôs clear Briggs & Riley invested in making this luggage stylish and practical.

**Capacity and Packing Efficiency**

Packing this carry-on is almost like playing Tetris. With expandable CX compression technology, it‚Äôs deceptively spacious. Expanding the sides using the single-press buttons allowed me to fit a week‚Äôs worth of clothes into it. My partner was shocked that I even managed to fit my trusty travel pillow in there. Then, compressing the bag back down into carry-on regulation size was oddly satisfying. 

That little garment folder inside was a gem. Having suits, shirts, and even slacks stay virtually wrinkle-free throughout the flights felt like a victory. However, the ""floating insert"" at the bottom was a bit of an enigma for me. I didn‚Äôt find a real use for it since I rely on packing cubes, but others might appreciate it for separating items.  

**Advantages**

- CX compression technology adds space yet complies with cabin restrictions.  
- The Outsider handle design maximizes the internal packing area, minimizing clothing wrinkles.  
- Durable build, including impact-resistant corner guards and high-density wheels.  
- The smart compression straps prevent items from sliding around in transit.  
- Lifetime Guarantee‚Äîseriously, Briggs & Riley will repair this thing no matter what happens.

**Mobility and Wheels Performance**

Rolling this carry-on through the airport was smoother than I expected, especially since it‚Äôs a two-wheeler. I‚Äôve had trouble with four-wheel carry-ons before‚Äîthe wheels always seemed to snag somehow‚Äîbut these high-density wheels handle long terminals, sidewalks, and even cobblestones as if they were born for it. Noise levels when rolling were barely noticeable, another little detail that kept the experience seamless.

**Internal and External Pocket Layout**

Having numerous pockets on hand turned out to be a lifesaver. The discrete Powerpocket on the exterior made it easy to charge my phone on-the-go‚Äîsomething I fully appreciated when my battery sank to 5% en route to a gate. Inside, the mesh lid zippered coverings came in handy for toiletries and socks. The simplified SpeedThru pocket lined with orange worked well for travel documents like boarding passes and even spare change I usually forget to store properly.

Sadly though, I wasn‚Äôt entirely convinced by the between-the-handle exterior pocket. Its size felt restrictive‚Äîtrying to store anything larger than glasses or boarding passes there didn‚Äôt work. The add-a-bag strap, however, was useful during a recent family trip, as I was able to tether a tote bag securely without juggling multiple straps.

**Areas of Concern**

- At 9.7 pounds on its own, it‚Äôs heavier than other carry-ons I‚Äôve used.  
- Not everyone will need or use the floating insert at the bottom.  
- The between-the-handle pocket offers limited utility for larger items.  

**Competing Products**

Having trialed other premium brands like Tumi and Samsonite, I‚Äôd say this carry-on sets itself apart with its organizational features and durability. While Samsonite offers excellent options at lower price points, its zippers and materials often lack the sturdy, lifetime feel I experienced with Briggs & Riley. As for Tumi, its sturdy builds come close, but the price hikes for newer models feel harder to justify, especially without a warranty comparable to this brand‚Äôs lifetime guarantee. Briggs & Riley offers compression technology that‚Äôs a step above Tumi‚Äôs designs.

That said, TravelPro Platinum Elite comes close. While lighter and more affordable, it sacrifices some durability, and its wheels don‚Äôt glide as effortlessly as this carry-on‚Äôs do on rough ground. For serious travelers, this Briggs & Riley luggage edges ahead.

**Value for Money**

Paying for premium carry-ons can feel daunting, but this model assures value through its performance and promising warranty. Its lasting design, paired with ingenious space considerations, makes it a worthy investment if smooth and stress-free travel is a priority. The added benefits, like compression technology and durable engineering, turn what could feel like splurging into smart spending in the luggage realm.

In 2007, Apple didn‚Äôt just launch a phone ‚Äî it redefined how the world communicates, connects, and computes. With one elegant device, it replaced dozens of clunky tools. It brought the internet to your pocket, created new industries, and revolutionized user experience.

At **The Connecter**, we‚Äôre taking the same approach to **Web3 wallets**.

Because let‚Äôs be honest ‚Äî crypto is powerful, but right now, it‚Äôs a mess.

# The Problem with Today‚Äôs Web3 Tools

For most people, using crypto today feels like learning a new language. Seed phrases, chains, bridges, wallets, gas fees ‚Äî it‚Äôs overwhelming, fragmented, and risky. Even seasoned users juggle 5+ apps just to do basic tasks like buying, sending, or storing assets.

This friction is the single biggest reason the next billion users haven‚Äôt entered Web3.

# A Web3 Wallet That Just Works

**The Connecter** is changing that.

We‚Äôve built a next-gen wallet that behaves like the best consumer fintech ‚Äî not a clunky Web3 dashboard. Think of it as the **Apple Pay of crypto**, with one-click functionality, smart automations, and bank-level security.

Here's what sets us apart:

‚úÖ **Buy Crypto at the Best Rates** ‚Äì We aggregate top global fiat onramps so users always get the best deal, no matter where they are.

‚úÖ **Save & Pay with Contacts** ‚Äì Easily send or receive funds from anyone in your address book. No more copying long wallet addresses.

‚úÖ **Seamless QR Payments** ‚Äì Scan to pay instantly. Just like you‚Äôd tap your phone to buy coffee.

‚úÖ **Seedless, Secure Access** ‚Äì No more losing funds to lost seed phrases. We‚Äôre building wallet access that‚Äôs both user-friendly and non-custodial.

# This Isn‚Äôt Just a Wallet ‚Äî It‚Äôs a Gateway

The Connecter isn‚Äôt just solving technical problems. We‚Äôre building a **new financial experience** for the mobile-first generation. One that‚Äôs borderless, interoperable, and radically inclusive.

From Lagos to Lisbon, from developers in Buenos Aires to freelancers in Manila ‚Äî the next wave of crypto users won‚Äôt tolerate friction. They want fast, secure, elegant solutions. And that‚Äôs exactly what we‚Äôre delivering.

# Why It Matters

We believe Web3 won‚Äôt go mainstream through speculation. It will go mainstream when people use it every day ‚Äî to send remittances, get paid for freelance gigs, shop, save, and thrive.

We‚Äôre not here to build for insiders.  
We‚Äôre building for everyone else.

# The Future Is Closer Than You Think

With early backing from top accelerators like **Google for Startups** and **AWS Startups**, and a growing network of partners, advisors, and early adopters ‚Äî The Connecter is poised to become the **default interface to the decentralized economy**.

And just like Apple brought the internet to your fingertips‚Ä¶  
We‚Äôre bringing the power of Web3 to your pocket.
