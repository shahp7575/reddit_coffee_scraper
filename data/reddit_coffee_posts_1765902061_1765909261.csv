After reading many success stories like “it changed my life from day 1!!” I was really excited about starting it and finally getting the help I needed. 

Here’s what I noticed in the first few days:

\- felt more awake, similar to the first couple of hours after a coffee but it lasted the whole day

\- I felt calmer and less agitated internally, therefore had a better mood and less anxiety.

\- it helped somewhat with impulses, especially around food (didn’t suppress appetite though) 

I would say this lasted about a week, i didn’t notice any improvements  in my concentration, focus, racing thoughts, still easily distracted etc and these are the areas that cause me more problems. 

I also haven’t noticed any negative side effects, and now in the last week I don’t notice any difference from when I take it or if I don’t and just have a coffee in the morning. 

Hoping that this is something normal and that it’s just the dose that needs adjusting, anyone else experienced something similar?

I’m posting with a clear intention: I’m looking for a platonic cuddle buddy, who believes in mutual respect, communication, and emotional awareness.

This is about comfort, presence, and the kind of calm connection that helps you exhale at the end of a long week.

What I’m hoping to build:
A relaxed, ongoing cuddle dynamic where both people feel safe, heard, and respected. Think shared blankets on the couch, a movie softly playing in the background, comfortable silence, gentle conversation, and the understanding that consent is continuous and boundaries are honored without question. We check in, we communicate, and we adjust as needed.

About me:
• Toronto-based, reliable, and respectful of time and energy
• Emotionally intelligent, self-aware, and communicative
• Clean, and values personal space and hygiene
• Naturally calming presence — I’m the “you can relax here” type
• Enjoys, deep talks, quiet moments, and creating cozy environments
• Would need to start in public (coffee, walk, etc) to ensure mutual comfort

About you:
• Also seeking platonic physical closeness
• Values consent, boundaries, and emotional safety
• Comfortable expressing needs and limits
• Kind, grounded, and open-minded

I'm hoping for it to be occasional or semi-regular, but we can agree on whatever works. 

I'm also expecting the following:
• Clear communication if feelings shift or boundaries change
• No pressure for anything beyond what we mutually agree on
• Discretion and respect for privacy

If you’ve been missing the kind of closeness that doesn’t come with expectations or complications — just warmth, comfort, and genuine human presence — we may be aligned.

When you message, answers one of the two questions:

1. What “comfort” looks like to you

2. One small thing that helps you feel safe and relaxed

1po96rw,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimNikah/comments/1po96rw/first_time_i_met_my_husband/,First time I met my husband,"Story Time.

I've started to go to therapy. When I think about past events surrounding how I got married and how I had no concept of boundaries especially when it came to my in laws, I cringe at the thought of all of it. I was in my mid 20s, very young and naive but also a very hopeful and loving human being . I lived a very sheltered life and unfortunately, because of it I was taken advantage of.

It was an arranged marriage, I barely spoke to my spouse. I was ""love bombed"" quite a bit from my in laws. A lot of my extended family was involved in the process as they knew my in laws ""very well"" . The engagement, Nikah and wedding took place in less than 6 months.

Side Note: My husband's family knew a lot of my relatives. It's funny how we never crossed paths.

I met my spouse for the first time at a coffee shop. His sisters and mother were also there and they seemed very happy to meet me. My family member also accompanied me. I definitely felt something to be off because they were very, very sweet and friendly but I pushed that feeling to the back of my head. With AM, most people during the getting to know stage seem to be very hesitant and a little awkward (especially if it's your first time meeting somebody). When I look back I now realize that these people seemed very sure that this marriage was going to take place. My mil appeared to be a very bubbly woman, who appeared to have it all together. Her daughters however looked nervous.

I of course was very nervous because this was my very first Rishta proposal. I talked to the mom and she was very interested in my job. I think that was probably one of the first questions she asked me. (It was a red flag considering all the financial abuse I have experienced married in this family.) In certain circumstances I think it's normal to ask about what a person does for a living. Looking back, I think this is a red flag if the girls finances is a highlighed topic in a rishta conversation considering men are suppose to be PROVIDERS!! It's a VERY red flag especially if the women in the mans family do not work or have any career aspirations.

In that meeting , I spoke with his mom and talked to one of the sisters.

All of a sudden my now husband got up and said to his mom ""Let's go.""

I was a little taken back because I thought he was coming to talk to me. He didn't say a single word to me.

For the longest time those moments played in my mind because I felt he wasn't interested. As the years of our marriage passed I look back to that moment and realize my gut feeling was probably right. He was whatever about the whole thing. He was not interested at all.

I remember going home and telling my sister ""I don't think he even liked me.""

My Sister said ""Who cares? Next!"" She was right I should've listened to her.

Weird thing is a few hours later my mom got a call from our relatives saying my now mil was interested...like really interested and can't wait for us to get back to them. I was really confused because I did not get a signal from the man.

Weeks later, I also agreed.

As I'm writing this, the story is strange to me so I can't imagine what everyone else is thinking lol

Months after we got married, I asked my husband what that was all about and what made him say yes. He said he liked how I was with his family.

Things are not going too well. As I'm starting to reflect, this coffee meeting is starting to haunt me.

I wish somebody told them that you cant marry out, to get rid of your family generational trauma. You can't expect another person (who has her own hopes and dreams about marital life) to do the work your parents should've done. Also EVERYONE has a healing journey.

1po95yv,https://www.reddit.com/r/ldssexuality/comments/1po95yv/discovered_facebook_messages/,Discovered Facebook Messages,"The other night my wife left her phone in the car and i happened to go through her facebook.  I noticed a bunch of Facebook messages from a guy (non-member) that shows up to church volleyball on Mondays mornings.  The messages go back 3 months,  basically from the moment he started going.   None of the messages were sexual, but as a man i could tell it seemed like he was trying to build a rapport and message her about once a week.  Mostly chit chat, but he would talk about vacations he went on, ask her about personal things like family,  and once asked her if she liked coffee.  My wife did not agree to coffee, and most of her responses were brief, although he had been consistently messaging her and she was responding.   I confronted her about it and she said it was nothing and was just being nice.   I was obviously angry and said why would you keep texting back?  She said she didn't want to be mean since she sees him every week at volleyball.   I believe her 75%, but i can't help but think she might have been entertaining the idea, either out of attention or excitement,  or maybe more.  I told her she was being incredibly nieve to believe a guy just wants to talk to a married woman to be nice.  It makes me mad that she wouldnt just ignore them or stop it rather quickly.  I dont know,  am i being paranoid?  

Back story, my wife is a life long member,  extremely attractive, house wife with 3 kids.  I am not a member,  but have gone to church with her every week since we have been married.  The guy texting is average guy, but seems well off money wise,  and also married. This also hurts me because she has always made me feel like the less moral one, because i drink on occasion,  have watched porn in the past, and or have done other non LDS things in my past.   I always looked up to her for being able to live a more holy life than me, and it boggles my mind that this would happen...whether it was purely platonic or not.  I told her that i felt incredibly disrespected as a husband.   I have had many opportunities throughout our marriage to talk to females,  as affairs are pretty common at my workplace but i never entertain that,  as i love my family and wife.  I feel like we are in a happy marriage,  healthy sex life, all that.

I am telling this story to warn others about this in the local area. My 12 year old daughter and I came into a local shop called elevation coffee. They have 3 locations, I went to the Tampa heights location which is closest to where I live. We had went to the older location a few doors down and loved it (beautiful outdoor patio with a waterfall) When we came to the new one, we ordered drinks with a guy, that later told us he was the owner. He had black hair, tall skinny, and Hispanic. He didn't seem to know anything and got our order wrong, but more importantly was eyeing my daughter a lot. When she turned around he stared at her in a super creepy way. I got such a strange feeling from him. I asked him his name and then looked it up later cause I couldn't shake the weird feeling I had about him. I found his name in a google search pretty quickly and recognized him in a mugshot. Turns out he was arrested for videotaping an 11 year old girl while she was changing in a public restroom. Guy is a pedophile and I hope he has not done anything since his last arrest, but want to warn others about this if they bring their children here.

So, i've always dealt with anxiety and depression, i thought the depression was just me being emotionally inept, i never got excited about anything but i didn't feel ""sad"" per se, just numb.  The anxiety was my bigger focus. It was debilitating.  I wouldn't leave my house for weeks at a time, i would spend multiple days in bed only getting up to use the bathroom or eat something small.  Most of this comes from childhood trauma, i don't need to get into most of it but an important one was a very close family member committing suicide when i was 13, my mom told me the details of how he did it.  She had her own things going on and i was essentially her counselor from the ages of 10 to 27 (i'm 27 now lol).  Needless to say, that suicide made me realize how quickley i could get out of my head, however, it also showed me how damaging that decision would be to everyone around me and i vowed that whatever suffering i went through, it was worth staying alive.  I went about finding counselors, talking to doctors, i was nervous about taking meds due to the potetnial side effects, as well as the possibility that coming off of them could be catastrophic (we think that's what lead to my family member's suicide.  Pretty sure he just decided to stop taking his meds without the aid of a doctor).  Doctors told me i needed antidepressants but i didn't trust them so i just whiteknuckled my wat through life.  Suicidal thoughts started at 17, started off as just a recurring thought probably 5 times a week or so.  As the years went on they got more frequent, i told counselors i had the thoughts but that they didn't bother me much, i was used to them.  Fast forward to this year.  Suicidal thoughts consumed me, about 8 hours a day ""you should kill yourself"" ""what's the point?"" ""Everyone would understand if you explained yourself in a note"" swirling around my head on a near constant basis.  I spoke to a friend about it and she recommended a specific counseling company and i decided it was worth a shot, she was also medicated and slightly changed my view on medication.  New counselor was extremely concerned when i brought up how often i dealt with suicidal thoughts and urged me to seek out medication.  I took their advice, after weeks of trying to get into a doctor i finally did, they recommended sertraline but didn't want to prescribe it before getting me to do some blood tests to rule out other causes.  I got bloodwork done and spoke to another doctor, they ignored the previous doctors recommendation of sertraline and prescribed me Escitalopram.   The difference i noticed in the first few days was shocking, the suicidal thoughts were almost completely gone, my anxiety was lowered to the point that leaving the house felt like no big deal at all, i was more content in general.  I remember sitting on the couch with my roommate smiling and almost crying because i'd realized i was actively happy, and had been actively happy for more than 10 minutes at a time.  I've been taking Escitalopram for a little over 2 months now and i still feel pretty good.  My story's not perfect though, I will say the first 4 weeks of side effects was brutal, the headaches everyday were the worst i'd ever had, the drymouth was bad enough that my throat got sore, i was constantly pretty tired, full body sweats at night made me have to wash my bedding multiple times a week, and i was jittery pretty often especially after drinking coffee.  A little piece of advice for anyone out there about to start meds, if you smoke weed, i do, stop for the first 4 weeks (at least) of treatment, don't drink, just be sober and let the meds do their thing.  I smoked weed everyday leading up to this and now i'll smoke once or twice a week and be fine but i was told not to make it a constant habit so i'm taking that fairly seriously.  All of this big rambling post to say:  if you're struggling, things get better, don't give up.  Even if Escitalopram isn't for you there are other options out there and while i got lucky and the first prescription seems to have been the right one, sometimes it takes multiple trials of multiple different medications BUT you are worth it.

If you're her, please feel free to repeat your story here or start a new thread in this sub and link it, because ... it's relevant and touching.

Okay. Let's put our heads together and figure this out. I would appreciate any advice, because I'm also struggling. But maybe the blind leading the blind from the opposite side can yield better results than just you and your same-sex friends trying to figure out how to reach the opposite side. Maybe the blind building a bridge could work.

I'm a guy in my late 30s. For as long as I remember I was looking for commitment, partnership, and family. When I was a teen, where I am now, everywhere and everywhen in between, my values hadn't changed one iota. Perhaps becoming more defined and solid, but not shifting. All the women I ever thought about asking out in my life, without exception, I've met on more than one occasion before that, I had meaningful conversations with every last one of them about life, values, ethics, past history, none of them appeared very attractive to me before that. And I'm not blind, I can see when she's miraculously beautiful. I'm also a physically healthy guy, I get aroused by looks same as anyone, including pictures of naked women or being present in a strip club, that's ordinary male physiology, it's just ... these things don't mean all that much. At the end of the day, the obviously cute angelic faces blur out, and the ones with character, expression, strong core, they remain seared into my mind like a brand. Though some of them are also angelic and miraculous by all objective standards.

In the last year, I've asked three people out. One didn't acknowledge it at all, not the first time, not the second, and it was business as usual. We work in the same company, but rarely intersect projects, and everything afterwards was just business and occasional social event, very civil and ... Two others declined, each in their own manner, and one more graciously than the other, but ... yeah.

I've been single for 20 years. Out of 15 women who I ever was attracted to during that time...

* One I asked out when I was in early 20s, I was very weird about it, completely dropped the ball, she declined, and rightly so;
* One we went out a couple times, then she told me her boyfriend of 4 years had proposed and she accepted, and asked me to never contact her again. I never had, and, frankly, someone in ""committed"" relationship who agreed to go on a date with someone else is not my jam;
* One was gay, I never approached her. When you're young and stupid this kind of thing is soul-crushing;
* Two were not single, I never approached them;
* 7 were married, engaged to be married, or were going out with their current boyfriends to whom they became married later;
* 3 I already wrote about, they were unavailable due to other reasons, mostly reasons they hadn't disclosed, and nor should they, nothing is required beyond ""that's what I want"".

Yeah. 10 out of 15 times, I was multiple years late to the party.

Dating apps: never tried them. I don't even know why. Something I cannot explain detracts me from them. Maybe I should get over it and dip in that water.

Work: most people I work with are my mother's age or older. Some are not, but only two ever were interesting in that sense, and it went nowhere in ways described above.

Friends: I skate. I'm a fiend for skating. Through skating, I regularly see over a dozen women, with whom I'm friendly, we hug, share food, exchange skills (though mostly it'll be me learning, everyone I know is better than me). So far, I hadn't been interested the romantic way. Skate in the summer on pavement. Skate in the winter on ice. Skate long distance. We've been through things together, events that reveal personality traits. Still no.

Pretty cafes and restaurants: well.... so far, I hadn't been interested this way in a woman unless we've already met a few times, so chances are slim that I'm going to run into the same stranger without pre-arranging it and then end up having meaningful conversations about things that actually matter. Okay, Ace Hotel I've legitimately never heard of. What's that? And what would be that place's particular appropriate workflow?

Parks: What parks are full of women and tote-bag carrying guys drinking matcha? I go on walks in parks and conservation areas, like Crawford Lake, Mount Nemo, Mountsberg, Nashville, Beare Hill... I go to the Toronto Zoo. All I see is people walking their dogs, families, and people on dates.

School/university: I graduated. I would love to finish a PhD in a topic I'm deeply invested in, but I'm in no position to take on this scale of debt, and I'm not sufficiently financed to do so without debt. This would require very dramatic changes to my living conditions, that I'm not prepared to make since it's going to affect more than just myself, and I'm not about to significantly discomfort the rest of my family for my petty ambitions. Some of my older friends are university staff, and I see them somewhat regularly, but so far, no interesting colleagues. Their students tend to be ... well, I can't even think about most of them this way.

Arts: I don't really get to galleries and museums as much as I wish. When I am in St. Petersburg or Moscow, I hit up a new spot at least every other day (unless it's the Hermitage, then it's a 3-day venture), but these places are teeming with astounding art and rich history. Royal Ontario Museum has changed a lot since I was there last, I should go there at least 5 times just to take everything in. And the Ontario Art Gallery... But then it's the same situation as a cafe, unless we agree to go there at the same time, chances are we won't see each other enough to even start getting interested.

Concerts are somewhat similar to cafes as it's low chance of repeat encounters among the audience. It gets a bit more interesting, though. I know music intimately. When I go to a ballet at the Four Seasons, chances are there are 3 or 4 people in the orchestra pit with whom I need to exchange greetings and handshakes just out of plain politeness because we have history. Occasionally, I'll be at the afterparty, especially if it's a smaller performance, a bit off the beaten track. One time I got stuck in the freight elevator in Koerner Hall with a couple band members and a pile of instruments. It was fun. I don't come very often, though. Maximum a couple times a month. (I prefer Koerner Hall and Four Seasons for their sound over RTH.) Still, no particular interest.

Fitness? I'm not ripped. I don't have gym subscriptions, no lifting. I do a hundred situps in the mornings, some stretches, try to work on my turnout the best I can, stand on balancing ball/log a lot. Kettlebell has a permanent spot under my desk, I randomly do some exercises with it during the day, like a hundred squats or some core/upper body training. I did a 55-km cross on inline skates in flurries and strong headwinds a month ago. I think I'm okay.

Now. Suppose I were in your target demographic (I'm not, you're also not in mine). Just hypothetically, I would approach you to introduce myself how and when? What do you imagine would prompt me to do so? I did a few times when I overheard conversations in transit about topics in which I was deeply invested. This tends to precipitate in getting to talk some more sometime later. That's possible, we chat a bit on the train, then agree to have a coffee with your friends in the next couple days, that's totally an avenue for building rapport. So what are you chatting about in public places when you're out with your friends? Do you appear open for a stranger to join the conversation? Physics? Metallurgy? Math? Acupuncture? Music? Architecture? Rembrandt and his pupils? Economies of scale? Housing crisis and investment legislature?

Past Saturday I was at Suso Skate in Oshawa for like 4 hours. Mostly practicing simple figures on my inlines. It wasn't a party or anything, it's so far out of the way that most people I know aren't willing to get there unless there's massive interest from core group members (which I'm not). There were lots of children. Some approached me for a bit of coaching on basic skills, others I just helped because I saw they were struggling to simply move. The all of 5 adults who were there ... let's say we're unlikely to build meaningful understanding. Curiously, I get approached for skating help by children often, and practically never by adults, even if they do throw wistful glances at my admittedly not top-notch performance or when I overhear them openly comment on my activities when they're in a group. And when I'm in a group, there are people leaps and bounds more impressive than I, and I see the same dynamic. Thankfully, there are strategies we've developed to appear inviting, but such body language and collective activities only work when in a group.

Nathan Philips Square is filled with people on dates, but there's also a skate party there often, so I'm seeing friends. I'm at Union Roll on Fridays and Saturdays, often also seeing friends.

My sister, on the other hand, she's married to a guy who's almost our mother's age. They met when she was in her mid-to-late 20s through work. Huge age gap. Not as huge as I've seen (our mom was pregnant at 19), but also something I would not be comfortable with myself. It looks like it's working, though. Then again, it is well known that men mature about 40 to 50 years later than women, so she probably has at least a 20-year head start on him before he grows up. Jokes aside, age gaps are ... well, complicated. I've not personally encountered fetishizing, but as a younger woman, you're probably at a much higher likelihood of catching that than me. Maybe 80% of people under 28 feel childlike to me. But they're also not a strict no-go zone, just... mostly don't tend to feel attractive in the first place. Aside from my sister, I know a few more couples who are married happily and respectfully outside of their own generation. Not sure I would consider it, but given my values and history, the gap keeps growing ever so unforgivingly. Another decade, and it will be approaching the danger zone as I see it (which is decidedly smaller than my sister's apparent situation, and maybe I'm due to review it, but it just feels ... weird).

A few weeks back a woman tried to hit on me quite transparently, she was my mother's age, or at least looked so. This put things into perspective, because ... I know it hurts to be overlooked, especially in such ways. And I feel so cruel and vile to not reciprocate. Still I stand ground on my own rights to be not interested in a person for any reasons I that I decide, and I will defend the right of anyone to be not interested in me for their own reasons they don't have to disclose or explain. I just would not even consider a woman with whom I cannot start a family, so no post-menopause. That really does limit me in a serious way and that limitation only grows with each passing year. I don't even know what drives me, if it's nature or nurture, if I was culturally indoctrinated or born this way. Some freak of nature who's been born with male genetics, but motherly instincts, craving so profoundly the commitment and permanence that my physiology is supposed to be deterred by. Or is it cultural indoctrination that drives men to chaotic promiscuity and away from permanence, and I'm uniquely in touch with the nature of man? That got really weird, but here, that's my plea.

Me and my now ex boyfriend (ended end of November 2025) had known eachother since 2021, but decided to give it a go at a romantic relationship this year in 2025. It held up for about close to 10 months, and the relationship in itself was quite good, he played a really good mask. He was very emotionally understanding, setting boundaries, learning who we are as people, the whole sorts. Met his/and mines parents, met his friends + mine, went over to his house, ended up saying “I love yous”. Didn’t jump into anything too quickly sexually either because I myself wanted to take it slow. He felt and was one of the sweetest guys I was together with and showed many traits I loved in a partner, which is what breaks my brain trying to understand this all. 

I ended up finding out that in that last two months of the relationship, he started having sex with other girls, and started getting romantically/sexually interested with his girl best friend. She knows about me, she has met me, she knows everything about our relationship (that’s not to say I’m fully blaming her I’m very aware he’s the bigger issue in all of this but still, just to point out the fact that she knew, and was even sending me happy birthday messages throughout all of this, and liking my stories). A month and a half before we break up in November , he had kissed her when they were hanging out alone the two of them and she had stopped him from having sex because she “is a woman of god and wants something serious with him if they are going to fuck”. I was astonished. He had then come up to me a month and a half later after this kissing scene and told me he wanted a break, because he needed to see how “he felt in my absence and if he would miss me, because he doesn’t feel connected to me anymore, he wants a break to sit and think if we are compatible and that I should also take this time to see it out for myself too”, mind you I didn’t know about him cheating at this point in time. So he labeled it as a break. And said he would absolutely be exclusive with me throughout this whole period. 

 A week later, after he places the “break” he flies to another country, which he had told me he was going with his group of friends. But I later found out from a mutual girl friend ( who’s the one who ratted him out for everything he did because she felt the need to tell me and show me everything with text message proof) that he flew and stood at a girls place and had sex with her. His girl best friend was in the same country, just different city with her group of friends. 

After he comes back from his trip, is when our mutual friend rats him out. She’s seeing that I’m crying trying to figure out what’s going on with him and how to get him back.  She shows me all their common text messages where he spoke about multiple girls in the recent period. It was more than enough for me to have a guy tell me to my face he has to “he felt in my absence and if he would miss me, because he doesn’t feel connected to me anymore”, and I was ready to leave off of that basis, but to hear he was sexually active with other girls too, was the cherry on top. 

He had asked me to go out for coffee once he was back, and I had accepted. I played my part cool and I didn’t want him to know that I knew about all the other girls. Men who cheat on you simply really don’t give a shit if you know or not, because they anyways did what they did. I went on the coffee date and had a little monologue where I said “Look, I appreciate you telling me how you felt, I took the time for myself during this break to see if I think we are compatible, and I don’t think we are, I always wanted something serious (moment where he interrupted me to say that he also wanted something serious but I wasn’t able to give him everything he needed😀……) and that we would be better off ending this here”.  He then had the gall to ask me “when was I planning on telling him all of this” (because he confessed to his friends that if his girl best friend rejects him he is going to try and come back to me in a couple of weeks). My guy had a plan! And to top it all off, when we met up on this coffee date, he had brought me back a magnet from the country he went to! We parted ways and stopped contacting eachother 

Two days later, I see him walking into a well known bar in our city, holding his girl best friends hand, fully in a relationship and starting something new. 

I know all of this sounds like a good drama story but I feel discarded. I know he’s playing a role with her know, the way he’s grandiose and being romantic, it’s all just a show. 

I need some soothing advice in regards to, how to deal with feeling discarded+ let down by both him and her too knowing she knew about me+ him being able to move on so quickly (knowing full well I was invested and trying out romantic relationships again after being single for a while) . Will their relationship ever be successful? (I know broken foundations like theirs never last, but I do keep wanting to hear it from other people). ",1,1765908043.0,CheatersConfronted,0,1.0,False

Myopic male 52 have worn lenses for forty years. My right eye cataract has has been getting worse so time to fix. Currently wear daily disposable bifocal -8 for left eye and now at regular -11 for the cataract right eye (dominant eye).

Don't need readers & hope to avoid for as long as I can. Have a pair of glasses for waking up/making coffee/give my eyes a break.

I like contacts and can deal with some vision variability so pretty sure I'll just get surgery on the right eye and get the monofocal lens. But - will I be able to wear my left bifocal contact lens?

From this forum I've learned I can set the correction of the implant lens which gives me some choices?

Decided to compare the P80 against my other two grinders on my table right now, the Femobook A4Z and the Ode with SSP MP UMV1s. For my comparison I used minmax coffee's Janson Lot 1006, with tasting notes of Citrus, Stonefruit, Floral and Green Tea. 

I ground 10 grams on each grinder aiming for Pour Over, utilizing the XBloom for consistent brew/pouring. I took 3 samples of each looking at the grind distribution, was not an exact science but fun to see the micron I was targeting with each grinder being so different! Images attached show grind distribution for each grinder tested, I then brewed and wanted to taste how these translated in the final cup. XBloom used a simple 3x Bloom + remaining 14x single pour targeting for 2:45/3:15 total extraction time. 

Here were my unscientific findings for cup profiles:   
  
**Grinder 1 – A4Z**

* **Aroma:** Soft green tea, light florals
* **Flavor:** Green tea dominant, subtle stone fruit and floral undertones
* **Acidity:** Mild–moderate
* **Body:** Light
* **Finish:** Drying, tea-like
* **Overall:** Delicate and restrained, with a clear green tea expression

**Grinder 2 – P80**

* **Aroma:** Bright citrus, florals
* **Flavor:** Citrus-forward with floral clarity; minimal green tea character
* **Acidity:** Moderate, clean
* **Body:** Medium
* **Finish:** Clean, balanced
* **Overall:** Clear and expressive without sacrificing structure

**Grinder 3 – Ode (SSP MP UMV1)**

* **Aroma:** Citrus, green tea, stone fruit
* **Flavor:** Fully layered—green tea, citrus, stone fruit
* **Acidity:** High, sharp
* **Body:** Very light
* **Finish:** Short, non-lingering
* **Overall:** Intense acidity with high clarity, but lacking weight and finish

Was surprised that the P80 Mizens had such a uniform distribution, an even more surprised that the end cup was so pleasant given such a unimodel distribution.

I had picked up 32F for a coffee date. I had parked my car opposite to Basera building (near Golden Punjab) in NMMC pay and park. This happened today at 7PM.

On the backseat of my car was my gym bag, which is a pretty casual thing. We parked, went to have coffee at Starbucks and left after like 45 minutes. 

I come back to find that the mirror of the back seat broken and my gym bag stolen. My car was filled with glass. Unfortunately couldn’t drop her back home. She went in a rickshaw.

I go to Vashi police station, who sent a constable there. They took my details and pictures and said they would be in touch.

This is so embarrassing and the fact that it’s happening so openly in sector 17, in an NMMC pay and park speaks volumes of the crime in the city. The police were least interested too

Every night, the same goodnight.

For almost two years our friendship has felt the closest I have been with someone in a long time.

Before my life speeds up, I need to know what it feels like to simply hang out with you outside of a game, outside of a call.

I know I'm going on this trip for entirely selfish reasons. It's going to be amazing, and I can only hope our friendship can survive. 

I hope this trip ends with a hug and not an awkward wave. I hope the pictures we take end up being fond memories we will still be able to talk about for years to come. ",1,1765907455.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1po8fqn,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/1po8fqn/the_veiled_necessity_a_somber_reflection_on_why/,The Veiled Necessity: A Somber Reflection on Why Twinks Must Don the Burqa,"In the shadowed corridors of modern society, where the glittering allure of youth and beauty dances perilously close to the abyss of exploitation, we find ourselves compelled to confront an uncomfortable truth. The twink—a figure of ethereal slimness, radiant charm, and unyielding vitality—stands as both a beacon of desire and a harbinger of chaos. It is with a heavy heart, laced with the bitter irony of our progressive pretensions, that I advocate for the mandatory veiling of these luminous beings under the burqa. Not out of malice, but from a profound, almost tragic necessity to preserve the fragile equilibrium of our world—much like the Koran’s Surah An-Nur (24:31), which urges the faithful to “lower their gaze and guard their modesty,” we must ironically apply this divine counsel to shield our twinks from the predatory stares of the uninitiated.
Consider first the sanctity of modesty, that ancient virtue so often discarded in the neon-lit frenzy of contemporary life. The twink, with his lithe form and effortless grace, embodies a temptation that borders on the divine—or perhaps the diabolical. In a culture saturated with the commodification of bodies, where every glance becomes a transaction and every pose a provocation, the burqa emerges as a shield of solemn protection. It cloaks the twink’s contours in layers of fabric, muting the siren call that draws predators from the shadows. Oh, the irony: in an era that champions body positivity and self-expression, we must enforce concealment to truly liberate, echoing the Hadith where the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) reportedly said, “Modesty is part of faith” (Sahih Bukhari)—yet here, we twist it to veil not just the faithful, but the fabulously flamboyant, lest their sparkle ignite unholy fires.
Yet, this mandate extends beyond individual safeguarding to the broader tapestry of societal harmony. The twink’s unveiled presence disrupts the mundane order, igniting envy among the less endowed and stirring unrest in the hearts of the beholders. Picture the boardrooms, the gyms, the coffee shops—arenas where productivity should reign supreme—now fractured by the distracting shimmer of perfectly tousled hair and sculpted jawlines. The burqa, in its somber uniformity, restores balance, enforcing a visual equality that quells the flames of jealousy and desire. It is profoundly ironic that, in our quest for inclusivity, we must impose such a garment, borrowed from traditions we often critique, to foster true unity—much as Surah Al-Ahzab (33:59) instructs women to “draw their veils over their bosoms” for protection and recognition, we must comically repurpose this to cloak our twinks, preventing the inadvertent hierarchies of attractiveness from poisoning our collective spirit and allowing us all to toil in egalitarian obscurity.
Moreover, we must grapple with the psychological toll on the twink himself, that delicate vessel navigating a world of voracious appetites. Exposed to the relentless gaze, he becomes a canvas for projections—objectified, idealized, and ultimately dehumanized. The burqa, with its enveloping embrace, offers a sanctuary of introspection, a forced retreat into the self where one might ponder existence beyond the superficial. How ironic that this symbol of oppression, in another cultural lens, becomes a tool of empowerment here, granting the twink the anonymity to cultivate inner depth amid the superficial storm—drawing from the Hadith’s wisdom that “The beauty of one’s Islam requires his leaving alone what does not concern him” (Sunan Ibn Majah), we ironically mandate veiling to liberate him from concerns that very much do, transforming fleeting youth into enduring wisdom, lest he wither under the harsh sun of perpetual adoration.
In conclusion, the requirement for twinks to wear the burqa is not a jest of fate but a grave imperative, steeped in the irony of our enlightened age. We, who pride ourselves on tolerance and visibility, must paradoxically enforce invisibility to protect what is most vulnerable, repurposing sacred texts like the Koran and Hadiths not for piety, but for this twisted preservation of purity, peace, and perhaps, a satirical form of progress.

We joined the same company at the same time, live in the same area, and clicked right away. She’s generally a nice person, and we’ve spent a lot of time together outside of work shopping, getting coffee, hanging out, etc.

Alex has a side job outside of our main company job, and I’ve always supported her with that. I’ve also been there for her emotionally whenever she had family issues or drama. She recently had an engagement party, and I supported her through all of that as well. I’ve always tried to be there for her.

Recently, I opened a small business a nail salon. I hired a professional nail tech to work with me. The idea to open this salon came partly because Alex used to get her nails done every two weeks at a specific salon, but that nail tech decided to move to another place. So I rented the same location and continued in the same line of business.

I honestly expected Alex to come get her nails done at my salon, especially since we’re friends. I even told her her first appointment would be on the house because I wanted her feedback. Instead, she chose to follow the old nail tech and now drives 30 minutes to get her nails done there.

When I asked her why she didn’t come to my salon, she said she would “next time” and that she just wanted her nails done by a ´professional’ that she trusted because she have an important event with her in laws and she wanted to look perfect. She also told me that she and the other nail tech were talking about my business and that the owner of the location is “bad,” that I’ll have a lot of trouble, and that it’s very hard to work in that area. I didn’t take it seriously at the time and tried to ignore it.

On top of that, I’ve been trying to grow my business on social media, and she suddenly started giving me unsolicited advice. She would say things like, “I talked to my boyfriend and he thinks you should do this, not that,” and it didn’t feel supportive it felt judgmental and intrusive, like she felt entitled to get involved in my business decisions.

She then went back again to the old nail tech for her nails. After that, I started feeling really off about the friendship. I don’t feel supported, and honestly, I’ve lost interest in continuing this friendship.

1po8aqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadianConservative/comments/1po8aqp/grocery_prices_post_biggest_monthly_jump_since/,Grocery prices post biggest monthly jump since January 2023,"Canadians were hit with another painful grocery bill last month, as the cost of food saw its largest monthly jump in almost three years.

The annual price increase in November was 2.2 per cent, matching the increase in October.

“Lower prices for travel tours and traveller accommodation, in addition to slower growth for rent prices, put downward pressure on the all-items CPI,” reads Statistics Canada’s latest CPI[ report](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/251215/dq251215a-eng.htm).

Higher grocery prices pushed the CPI up 2.6 per cent “for the third consecutive month,” while a smaller decline in the cost of gasoline helped to offset the increase.

Prices for food purchased from stores rose 4.7 per cent annually last month, following a 3.4 per cent jump in October.

The price hike was driven by an acceleration in the cost of fresh fruit, particularly berries, and other food preparations.

“In November, prices for fresh or frozen beef (+17.7 per cent) and coffee (+27.8 per cent) continued to be significant contributors to overall grocery inflation on an annual basis. Higher beef prices have been driven, in part, by lower cattle inventories in North America,” the report states.

“Coffee prices have been impacted by adverse weather conditions in growing regions and rose amid American tariffs on coffee-producing countries, which have contributed to higher prices for refined coffee.”

Grocery prices in November experienced the largest month-over-month increase since January 2023.

Month-over-month, the CPI increased 0.1 per cent, and 0.2 per cent on a seasonally adjusted basis.

Prices for services also increased 2.8 per cent last month, rising slightly slower than the 3.2 per cent jump seen in October.

Provincially, Ontario was the largest contributor to lower prices.

Annually, prices rose at a faster pace in five provinces, remained unchanged in two, and rose at a slower pace in the remaining three compared with October.

New Brunswick experienced the fastest annual rising pace at 2.7 per cent in November, following an increase of 2.1 per cent in October.

Higher prices for Internet access services (+5.1 per cent), rent (+5.2 per cent), and furniture (+5.2 per cent) were the three leading factors in the overall increase.

Nationally, rent prices rose at a slower pace in November compared with October. Although they still remained elevated, price growth slowed in most regions last month.

Meanwhile, prices for cellular services saw a 12.7 per cent increase in November, compared with a 7.7 per cent increase in October.",4,1765906882.0,CanadianConservative,2,0.83,False
1po8ah0,https://www.reddit.com/r/orioles/comments/1po8ah0/os_outline_2026_build_your_best_roster_lineup/,O’s Outline 2026: Build Your Best Roster & Lineup,"Now entering the AlonsO’s era, the vibes are high in Birdland. It’s been cold in Baltimore, but the hot stove is BURNING and hope springs eternal. We’re all thinking the same thing, what do the O’s have left to do to finally bring a championship back home in 2026?

Here’s a fun mega-thread to exercise your inner armchair GM and Manager. I want to hear, what signings and trades do we still need to make this offseason? We have the resources for one more big signing + a major trade. What projected 26-man roster would those moves leave us with? And what would our best Opening Day lineup be?

I’ll go first —

Free Agency:

FA Plan A: Sign Tatsuya Imai (28)

7yrs/$161MM w/ opt-out after 2yrs + $25MM posting fee

Total max investment = 7yrs/$186MM

- This is the guy I want to sign long-term for 4 reasons: Age, ceiling, health, and no QO attached. Plus, pairing a potential Japanese superstar w/ Alonso as our big acquisitions could generate some next-level buzz. While an NPB player having MLB success is never a sure thing, the pipeline has been particularly strong recently and every other FA pitcher is over 30 and has a major red flag. Valdez - age + character, Suarez - back issues + avg velo, King - only two years as a starter + health.

FA Plan B: Sign Zac Gallen (30)

4yrs/$88MM w/ vesting option for 5th yr/$24MM

Total max investment = 5yrs, $112MM

- Pros: a workhorse who has only finished a season under 121 IP in his shortened rookie and COVID years. Has had dominant stretches in recent history, and has been to the World Series. Young enough, durable enough, and smart enough of a pitcher to lead a staff for the next 4 years. Bonus fun fact, I’ve heard he expected to be drafted by the O’s in 2016, but we selected Cody Sedlock instead. Hope there’s no grudges held!

- Cons: QO-attached after the most brutal stretch of his career in the first half of 2025 paired with a declining strikeout rate and a boom in HRs allowed. But these cons are why he’s not a $200mil pitcher right now. This could either be a quickly-aging pricey pitcher on the decline, or the steal of the offseason.
Trade Plan A:

Acquire SP Pablo Lopez (30) from MIN for

1B Coby Mayo, P Esteban Mejia, P Jauron Watts-Brown, P Braxton Bragg (IL)

- The Twins say they’re holding onto their big 3 trade chips in Lopez, Ryan, and Buxton in hopes to retool, but is that ill-advised? The AL Central is always up for grabs, but DET is the clear favorite, CLE always finds a way, and KC is a pesky team with quality pitching. A Wild Card is unlikely with a big battle for the AL East brewing. Joe Ryan may be out of reach, but make a strong offer to the Twinkies for their most likely to be traded asset in Lopez that brings them current + future potential, plus salary relief of his remaining 2yrs/$43MM contract.
Lopez had a down year due to injury but performed well when healthy. Hasn’t had an ERA+ below 103 or WHIP above 1.192 this decade.
Trade Plan B:

Acquire SP Edward Cabrera (28) from MIA

For 1B Coby Mayo, C/OF Ike Irish, P Michael Forret, SS/2B Cobb Hightower (+ Comp Balance A Pick if needed to seal deal)

- A comparable package as for Lopez, but the Marlins always need offense in their system, so we sacrifice there to retain a little more organizational pitching depth. I am not as high as most on Cabrera because his price will be high while he’s only topped 100 IP once, and sounds like a TJ ticking time-bomb. I can’t help but feel like we just gave up on a similar profile pitcher in Grayson Rodriguez. But all pitchers are risks. The stuff is there, he offers the most years of control, and if healthy Cabrera will help us win now.

Trade Plan C:

Acquire SP MacKenzie Gore (27) from WSH

For 1B Coby Mayo, OF Nate George, P Esteban Mejia, P Keeler Morfe

- This is plan C because I expect the cost to be highest while Gore has the least consistent performance history and a year less control than Cabrera, but he is a high ceiling LHP. Also of note, we’ve never traded with the Nats. Would our cost be even higher than another team’s?

These moves leave us with the following ideal 26-man roster (please stay healthy) and primary lineup:

1. Westy 3B (R)
2. Gunnar SS (L)
3. Alonso 1B (R)
4. Ward LF (R)
5. Basallo DH/C (L)
6. Beavers/O’Neill RF (L/R)
7. Adley C/DH (S)
8. Cowser CF (L)
9. Holliday 2B (L)

A few notes here; Westy could be an incredible table setter atop our lineup, as he has some of the best ABs and plate approach in general on the team. He’s also fast but does not run himself into outs like Holliday has. Holliday may be the dynamic leadoff guy one day, but for now I’m dropping him down to the bottom of the lineup.

If Westy isn’t healthy, give Gunnar the lead-off spot. Best player gets the most ABs.

Alonso at 3 is the spot, don’t push him any farther down your lineup.

The shocker here might be Basallo at 5, but I’m banking on him living up to his potential, because when he makes contact the crack of the bat is comparable to only Ohtani and Judge.

I’m assuming we’re going to run with a Beavers/O’Neill platoon in RF until General Soreness shows up, at which point hopefully Beavers can continue his success from his cup of coffee last season.

Adley at 7? Yeah, show us that you can produce again before we give you crucial ABs at the top of the order, we can’t afford to waste them. This is the most balanced our lineup can be with no more than 2 same-sided hitters consecutively, neutralizing the other team’s L/R match-up ability.

Bench:

10. Beavers/O’Neill (COF), 11. Jackson (INF/COF), 12. Tavares/Bradfield (CF), 13. Kjerstad (1B/COF)/Back-up SS/Back-up C

I’m hoping Bradfield comes up before the end of the year and can be a speed/defense weapon in the playoffs. The last position spot is a toss up, as Kjerstad is a complete unknown at this point, we lack a true SS back-up (not super critical since we have flexibility with our starting INF), and a designated back-up C (hoping Adley/Basallo can do most of the work without carrying a third).

There’s no room for additional big FA additions in the lineup unless we trade multiple of our young position players. Sorry, that means no Tucker, no Bellinger, no Bader.

As you can see, there’s no room on this roster for Mayo. He has to be traded, hopefully other teams value him. There’s also no room for Mountcastle, who probably has no significant trade value. As much as I’d like to keep him around for his defense (if you’ve forgotten he’s a GG-caliber 1B, Jim Palmer will remind you) and vibes, but his $7.8MM price tag is probably too high for an inflexible, streaky bench bat with hamstring and vestibular injury history. Sadly, Dear Maria count me out, but we’ll always love ya Mounty.

SP:

1. Rogers
2. Bradish
3. Imai/Gallen
4. Lopez/Cabrera/Gore
5. Kremer

Barring more major injuries, this is a top rotation in baseball, and all of the moves to build it are do-able. I’d also consider going with a 6-man rotation with Wells in an attempt to stay healthy. We lack SP depth, but hopefully Povich and Gibson can be that.

BP:

Helsley, 20. Kitteredge, 21. Wells, 22. Cano, 23. Akin, 24. Enns, 25. Garcia, 26. Wolfram
Bullpens are a revolving door, but this seems like the group we’re going with for the bulk of the work. Cano needs a bounce back season, or he may be the first man out.

Norfolk Shuttle

Povich, Young, McDermott, Gibson, Nunez

Est. Payroll: $155MM - $177MM, depending on combinations of Free Agent + Trade plans. This leaves plenty of room to work within a budget of $200MM if we need to outbid or make other additions. And hey, everyone spends good money to watch the O’s, put it to good use.

1po8994,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingNashville/comments/1po8994/first_time_in_nashville_next_september/,First time in nashville next September.,"Next September, from the 15th through the 25th, I’ll be spending ten days in Nashville—a city I’ve never visited, arriving at a moment that feels both personal and purposeful.



I’m Anthony. I’m 44 years old, and on September 17, I’ll celebrate my birthday in Music City. That alone is reason enough to mark the calendar. But the heart of this trip comes later in the week, from September 22 through the 24th, when Nashville hosts the International Bi-Yearly Conference on Shaken Baby Syndrome and Complex Head Trauma.



As an adult survivor of severe Shaken Baby Syndrome, I recognize how uncommon my story is. I’m fortunate to be alive. Fortunate that I don’t live in a medical facility. Fortunate that I can travel independently, drive a car, and move through the world largely on my own terms. I do things a little differently—but differently has worked just fine.



Outside of the conference, I plan to experience Nashville the way I experience every city I visit: slowly, thoughtfully, and with curiosity. Yes, I’ll listen to country music—but my tastes wander. I’m especially fond of 1970s soft rock and smooth jazz, the kind of music that settles rather than shouts.



Mornings, however, belong to newspapers and coffee.



I don’t mind early mornings—very early mornings. I enjoy waking up before the sun rises. Late nights out until one, two, or three in the morning have never really been my style. I’d rather greet the day quietly, with a cup of coffee and a newspaper spread open in front of me.



I’m a devoted newspaper reader—cover to cover. Not skimming headlines, but reading with intention, discussing stories, and giving print journalism the respect it deserves. In a time when print is fading and only about five percent of Americans still receive home delivery, I find real joy in reading local papers from cities beyond my own. It’s fascinating to see how different journalists tell the same country’s story to different communities.



That ritual pairs best with good coffee. Black coffee. No cream. No sugar. No foam artistry required. And not from chain cafés. I look for places that feel lived-in—coffee shops with couches, oversized chairs, maybe a small courtyard outside. Somewhere you can spread out, settle in, and feel at home. Metal chairs and tiny tables don’t do it for me. Comfort matters.



So here’s the invitation.



If you live in Nashville or nearby and enjoy good coffee and the morning paper, I’ll happily buy your coffee. If you get a paper delivered and want to bring it along to a coffee shop and sit for a while—just talking through the day’s headlines and current events—I’m all in. Conversation, curiosity, and caffeine make for a good morning.



Maybe you’re someone who enjoys a local farmers market, a neighborhood walk, or showing a visitor the places that don’t make it into guidebooks. I’ll cover lunch. I’m far more interested in one-on-one local knowledge than tour groups and itineraries.



I’m also planning to explore beyond the city. I’ve already looked at a list of small towns within an hour’s drive, and the idea of day trips really excites me. This will be the first time in my life I’ve ever rented a car—something I’ve never needed before—but it opens up possibilities, and I’m looking forward to that freedom.



Food matters, too. I love barbecue, but I don’t need it at every meal. I’m a foodie in the truest sense—someone who enjoys talking about flavors, textures, and why a dish works. What I don’t do much of is drinking. I’m not a beer drinker, not a liquor drinker, and that’s perfectly fine with me.



Libraries are another plus—actually, a huge plus. Sitting in a library with a cup of coffee, reading the paper, learning something new—that’s a home run. Who says you have to spend a lot of money on vacation to have a good time?



I’ve always believed that if I’m learning, if I’m feeding my curiosity, and if I can agree to disagree with someone while still offering them a cup of coffee—and knowing the pot is still hot—then I’m doing something right.



Politics don’t decide my friendships. I have Republican friends, Libertarian friends, Democratic friends, and everything in between. We don’t always agree, and that’s okay. What matters is respect, conversation, and the understanding that disagreement doesn’t have to end connection.



That’s the kind of traveler I am. Calm. Curious. Open-minded.



Nashville, I’m looking forward to meeting you—one early morning, one newspaper, one cup of coffee, and one good conversation at a time.",2,1765906789.0,VisitingNashville,3,1.0,False

The kids are sweet and no trouble at all. We spend about an hour playing games, doing homework, or studying before I take them to school. This allows their parents to easily get to work on time. Traffic in our city can be horrendous. This is the first year the kids’ school starts after the parents need to be at work. 
But I’m beginning to miss the quiet time having coffee with my husband, walking with my old walking group, and having the freedom to schedule other things in the morning. (Hubby cannot help deliver the children to school because he’s still working.) 
I’m considering telling the parents that I can’t continue taking the kids to school (after this school year).
When I offered to take them I said I’d do it the first year of this new school schedule or until they found another solution. They talked about trying to connect with other parents so they could form a carpool but that no longer seems to be a consideration.

Since I was a kid, I have struggled with being really really tired. All the photos of me on vacations in elementary school, I’m sleeping. Our Disney trip I am asleep in every single photo but one. My mom said I was her only kid that could nap anywhere anytime. I was falling asleep at school and in high school I was falling asleep every single class, drool and all haha. I would also fall asleep washing my hands and reading and watching movies and cleaning, etc. just always. I felt really really tired. Now I fall asleep driving too but luckily no accidents. I also have fallen asleep walking down the stairs a couple times and hurt myself. 

I also have really really awful lucid vivid nightmares since I was a kid. And sleep paralysis almost every single flipping night. I never don’t dream and I fall asleep instantly and seriously feel like I could always sleep. I take two naps a day but I still feel exhausted. 

I get really weak sometimes and my husband and I have had to be careful about sex positions because I will fall over sometimes from the feeling. I’ll also go completely weak when we get in an argument or I’m laughing. In the morning I can barely do anything with my hands because I feel so weak. 

I had never really considered it was a huge problem and always figured it was just because I was so tired and lazy that I was falling asleep.  But after I had my baby I have started falling asleep at really really bad times. We were playing at my parents  and I accidentally fell asleep and she fell down the stairs. And when she was first born I couldn’t breastfeed because I was going literally mental and actually physically could not stay awake every time I got up. I fell asleep yesterday while we were playing and woke up to her being okay and just playing with blocks but it pushed me to start looking into sleep disorders because no matter how much sleep I get I always feel like I’m trying to catch up and passing out. The other push was when I ripped a massive hole in our sheets again from thrashing in my sleep and my husband mentioned he didn’t think that was normal.And I started to wonder if these things could be a sleep disorder.

I took a couple screenings and it led me to narcolepsy type 1. I’m wondering, what sets narcolepsy apart from other sleep disorders,  and does this sound like your experience at all? Or does this sound like something different? Ijust want help I can’t function like this and every day AND feels like a battle to survive. I could drink an energy drink and a coffee in the same day and still feel just as sleep deprived.",1,1765906614.0,Narcolepsy,0,1.0,False

How do I support my boyfriend better?,"I (19F) started dating my boyfriend (21M) about 3 months ago. I go to university full time and have a part time job. He goes to community college and works by selling stuff on ebay. He’s always said that he makes a good amount off of what he does. It’s just he’s always struggling financially and barely takes me out because of this. Don’t get me wrong I like him so much, he makes me very happy. He buys me flowers and sometimes small stuff. I know he’s giving super nice Christmas presents. He wants to be a vet and I love that since I am an animal lover. I work at a dog daycare and don’t make that much just enough to cover my bills and still have some money aside for savings and fun. I just been feeling a bit annoyed that he’s always struggling financially and can’t take me out. He only goes to school 2 days a week, 3 upcoming semester and I believe he would have plenty of time for a part time job. I won’t say i’m the most mature but I have goals that I work hard to achieve and he doesn’t seem the same. I try hard not to compare him to past relationships but I struggle so much with it. I just need advice to stop doing this, be patient and have our relationship work out. I keep comparing him to my past relationships where they struggled as well but managed to take me out and spoil me. i know im a bad girlfriend for comparing but it just comes to my head randomly. I just wish he’d buy my $7 coffee here and there and maybe take me out to eat (even somewhere cheap) every few weeks. That would be enough for me. I just miss being spoiled and im not sure if I need to leave the relationship for his own benefit or should I be patient and hope he gets a job soon? I know I might get hate but I’ve always put myself first and I do not want nobody stopping from achieving what I dream of. I will always put myself, school and work first and it’s hard to find a man who supports me. My boyfriend supports me knowing he can’t be my priority but I’m not sure how to support him when I feel like this. He does talk about working at a vet clinic his sister works at so maybe i’m just being mean. I understand struggling especially in this economy but he doesn’t even seem to put much of an effort to work. Maybe it’s just my love language?

I’m 33 weeks pregnant now and have really started to understand the third trimester struggles. First 15 weeks were a bit rough, I was tired and nauseous. Second trimester was fantastic. I had a cute bump, fit into 80% off my clothes and I felt amazing. My appetite returned and food aversions were gone.

First couple of weeks of the third trimester have also been good, and now I am so fed up of being pregnant. My bump is getting big and uncomfortable now, my skin is feeling tight and like baby cannot possibly get any larger in there. I wake up multiple times in the night and just roll from one side to the other which means I’m so tired the next day (but can’t resort to 4 cups of coffee), my ribs hurt, I think her feet might be digging in there, my back has been in constant agony, no position on the sofa is comfortable and I’m getting pelvis pressure.

I'm excited to be visiting New Zealand for about 1 month this coming January/February. I've been doing a great deal of research, lurking this sub, and leveraging ChatGPT to develop my itinerary. Before I start booking things in, I'd love some feedback and insight into what I've come up with. Is there anything massive that I'm missing? Any top recommendations on the places I'm going?

Some notes!  
\- As I'm traveling, I want to enjoy nature -- hikes, swims, SUP/kayak. I also like to relax with things like thermal pools. Other priorities include learning about Maori culture, fitting in some Lord of the Rings sights, art galleries, and coffee.

\- I'll be traveling solo, and therefore have decided *not* to rent a car. I will be relying mainly on InterCity buses, as well as booking some tours that will include transport. I understand that this will limit some of the places I'm able to visit, but I think this is the best option for me.

\- The only thing I've booked so far is the 3 day/2 night tour in Abel Tasman, which means that I'm locked in to being at the top of the North Island from February 2-5. Everything else is somewhat open to change.

\- I've intentionally left off the Tongariro Crossing -- will save this for a future trip to New Zealand when I'm not traveling solo

\- I've tried to schedule my trip with some breathing room, particularly in the cities, so that I can rest, do laundry, etc. That's part of why I have so much time booked in Wellington, for example.

\- I'm intentionally planning for both Doubtful Sound and Milford Sound because they both sound amazing and very much in the vein of what I'm interested in seeing.

\- I'm quite an experienced travel, and very accustomed to long travel days. I'm prepared that some of these bus rides will be quite long. 

Thanks in advance for any advice! I'm very excited to finally be visiting.

**Why This Pick?**

The Avalanche have won 4 of their last 5 games against the Kraken, and 3 of those 4 victories were by at least 2. While Colorado hasn’t been great at covering the PL on the road lately, Seattle’s struggles should bode extremely well for the Avalanche offense. The Kraken have lost 8 of their last 9 outings, and 7 of those losses have been by multiple goals. At the time of writing, neither team has confirmed their goalie, but it’s looking like the Avs will start MacKenzie Blackwood who is a formidable 9-1-1. I’ll take the Avs to win by at least 2.

A RentWisconsinCabins.com listing partner since 2012!","by [Joe Mogensen](https://itscabintime.blog/author/cabinjoe/)

Cabintimers, here’s the kind of Northwoods basecamp you tell friends about later. A flat, grassy lot that rolls right to the shoreline. Two cabins sitting just a few strides from the water (we’re talking 8–15 feet). And those 80-foot piers? They put you over fishy water fast—morning coffee in one hand, rod in the other. Add on-site fisherman-style pontoon rentals and a screened fish-cleaning house, and you’ve got a lake-life setup that’s hard to beat on North Twin Lake in Phelps, Wisconsin.

# Why Cabintimers love this spot

* **Waterfront made easy.** No steep stairs. No huffing gear. Just level ground from cabin door to the lake. Swim from the shoreline as the water gradually deepens, or tie up at the long piers.
* **Serious fishing credentials.** North Twin (2,880 acres) links with South Twin (another 780 acres) and produces walleye, musky, perch, and bass. Ice fishing is excellent too. Clean your catch in the modern, screened house with lights, power, and running water.
* **Boats ready on-site.** Bring your rig or rent fisherman-focused pontoons and an Aluma Craft with GPS/depth finders, live wells, and trolling motors.
* **Walk-to conveniences.** A gas/bait/convenience store sits a short walk away. Restaurants and a lakeside Irish sports bar are an easy stroll or a fun boat ride.
* **Open year-round.** Come for summer swims, fall color and hunting weekends, winter snowmobiling and hardwater action, and spring walleye runs.",1,1765905741.0,CabinRentals,0,1.0,False
1po7rn3,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/1po7rn3/finally_found_something_for_fasting_window_hunger/,finally found something for fasting window hunger that doesn't involve more caffeine,"16:8 for about 6 months and those last four hours have been brutal, not physically painful just mentally exhausting. Constantly checking the clock, planning what I'm going to eat, I’m barely able to focus on anything else. Black coffee made me too jittery and anxious although it helped, sparkling water helps a tiny bit and staying busy doesn't work because my brain refuses to cooperate.

I usually don’t really trust the supplement industry too much because everything is unregulated but I started using ozzi about three weeks ago because it looked decent enough to try, it's a drink mix with konjac fiber that's under 5 calories so it doesn't break the fast. The food noise went from maybe an 8 to like a 5.5 on most days which sounds small but it's actually huge when you're trying to get through meetings without counting down minutes lol. I even managed a couple 18 hour fasts this week. And yeah maybe the effect is exaggerated a bit but it does help so I’ll probably stick with it or try some similar products

The caffeine free thing was really important for me because I was already jittery and adding more stimulants wasn't an option and almost all of the appetite supressants on the market basically rely on caffeine. Thats a reals problem for a lot of people btw when they dont check the ingredient list and just take them along with their normal caffeine intake and then they start sweating a lot and having anxiety and all that stuff. For me its an absolute no go because I take adhd meds (hence the being jittery enough) and any amount of caffeine just doesn’t feel good ever since I started taking them. But anyways anyone else find something that helped with the mental side without technically breaking it or loading up on more caffeine?",3,1765905704.0,intermittentfasting,0,0.8,False

Episode 3,"April 9th, 2019, began like any other day for Detective Murphy which means he has enough coffee in his system to put a rocket into space. He is tired, not just physically but emotionally. After more than two decades as an officer, an extra thirty pounds on his frame and a dozen years in homicide, he looks weathered and older than his 46 years. He runs his fingers through his bushy beard and checks himself quickly in the rear view mirror. As he arrives at the crime scene,  he still has this sinking feeling that today would be different. College kids were not normally the victims of murder in Revere. It is just 6:17 AM and a chilling rain paints the alleyways in hues of gray. Crime scene tape crisscrosses both ends of the narrow passage and a Revere patrol car sits at the mouth of the alley, flashing lights that cast eerie reflections on the wet cement.

Murphy exits his unmarked patrol car, bundled up in his drab overcoat. He walks up to a huddle of patrol officers briefing the murder scene with newly minted Detective Johnny Corso, who is young enough to be his son. Murphy glances over at Corso,and it's like looking through a time machine of sorts to when he first made detective. Except the reflection is that of a much more handsome guy with dirty blond hair, no wrinkles and a fraction of the PTSD he has carried with him throughout his years of experience. Murphy motions to Corso and pulls him away from the group of patrol guys.

""What do you have for me Corso?” Murphy says with a grim sense of dread hanging in his voice.

Detective Corso, younger and less weathered by the horrors of the city, replies, ""It's 19-year-old Patrick Finn. Bartenders at the Angry Dragon said he left just after the last call, around 1:45 AM. It seems like he took this alley on his way back to his dorm, which is only a mile or so from here."" he says pointing towards the campus dorm complex.

Murphy's face darkens as he contemplates the situation. ""Have you called forensics yet? We need them to start looking for evidence. No doubt whoever did this beat his dick like a salvation army drum, there are probably cock droplets all over the place.”

Corso nods, ""Not yet, but I'll give them a call. There are a few cameras in the area too. Who knows if they caught anything useful.""

""Good,"" Murphy mutters, ""Now, let me see the body.""

Corso pushes open the door to the fire safety room allowing Murphy to get his first glimpse of the lifeless form of Patrick Finn, he pulls a small audio recorder from inside his coat and speaks into it. ""For heaven's sake, it looks like he fought a truly ferocious adversary. Most of the stab wounds are on the left side of his body. The killer is most likely right-handed. The angle of the wounds, it's downward, intimate... This was a brutal, violent act. Finn also has defensive wounds on his forearms and hands.""


Murphy's eyes drift to the wall nearby, a silent witness to the horror that had unfolded. “Whoever did this” he says grimly, “Ambushed Finn, probably waited for him to pass the door, shoved him in, and stabbed him four or five times before the poor kid even knew what was happen+ing.”


Corso, equally disturbed, chimes in, “I agree. And look at the lividity on Finn's side. The blood settling like that shows he landed on his left, he never moved again... bled out in a minute or so I bet.” Corso says. “ Murphy, you got your flashlight? “Look at that wall.” he says pointing towards the mysterious message. “Go Fight Win?” 



“What in the world” Murphy pauses trying to process what he sees “Do you think that means?” he finishes while staring at the wall still trying to make sense of the entire scene. “What the hell, the sick son of bitch put a heart on the damn “I” in win too.”  A few moments pass , Murphy leans down..inhales through his nose... “Hey, Corso, can you smell that?”

Corso scrunches his face “Smell what? This whole alley smells like the Loch Ness monster took a huge shit marinated in camel piss.”

Murphy's eyes narrow. ""The blood on the wall... it smells different from the blood on Finn and the ground. I know that smell anywhere, Corso... pussy blood.""


Corso's jaw drops, his eyes flash open. ""What? Get the fuck out of here! You mean to tell me you can distinguish between blood from... you know, and regular blood?""


Murphy's tone is dead serious. ""Married 34 years to a woman who could flood a room with it... I know pussy blood when I smell it. You can practically taste it in the air."" he says, sniffing once more.


Just then, a stranger in a tattered Revere t-shirt appears outside the doorway. Startled, he blurts out, ""Is that guy dead...gross!""


Murphy's patience is running thin. ""Who the hell are you? Get out of here, asshole! There's crime scene tape everywhere. How did you manage to sneak in here?” he says, chasing the man off. “Corso, secure this scene, and get the coroner down here. Not a word about what's written on that wall leaves this room, understand?""


Corso nods, ""Got it, boss,"" he says as he leaves the room and yells at the patrol to tighten up the crime scene.


Murphy stands alone in the room with the corpse at his feet. He looks around from wall to wall trying to rationalize the unthinkable nature of such a crime. “When does something like this ever really make sense? 
What kind of animal has this inside of them?” Murphy pulls out a small notepad from his shirt pocket and makes some final notes. No matter what he has seen before, the sinking feeling in his stomach is telling him this is different and is only the start of it all.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **The Vancouver Canucks vs. New Jersey Devils: A Tale of Two Teams (One With a Toaster Defense, the Other With a Circus Goalie Who Can’t Juggle Saves)**

Ladies and gentlemen, gather ‘round for the most statistically baffling game of the NHL season: the Vancouver Canucks, fresh off trading their emotional leader Quinn Hughes to Minnesota, somehow outmaneuvered the New Jersey Devils in a 2-1 road win. It’s like watching a mime act perform surgery on a broken VCR—confusing, but somehow functional. Let’s break it down with the precision of a Zamboni and the humor of a penguin in a hockey mask.

**Parsing the Odds: Why This Game Feels Like a Math Class**  
The Devils, currently the NHL’s version of a “do-over” button, are drowning in injuries. They’ve lost 162 player-game appearances—second only to the Canucks, who traded their star defenseman to fix their own “do-over” issues. Their starting goalie, Jacob Markström, is allowing goals like a sieve at a bakery. He’s ranked sixth-worst in the league, letting in four more goals than expected. Meanwhile, Vancouver’s Thatcher Demko? He’s the NHL’s version of a “don’t worry, be happy” mantra, stopping 25 of 26 shots in this game. The Canucks also debuted rookie Zeev Buium, who looked like he’d been playing in the AHL’s “Rookie of the Year” video game on expert mode. Two points in his first period? That’s not a debut—it’s a “I’m here to win your sympathy and your Stanley Cup” moment.

**Digesting the News: New Jersey’s Management Decisions Could Use a Timeout**  
Let’s talk about the Devils’ GM, Tom Fitzgerald, whose contract decisions resemble a bad blind date. He locked in Jacob Markström through 2028, Dougie Hamilton for $9 million annually, and Ondrej Palat for $6 million with no-movement clauses. It’s like buying a car with a 10-year warranty and then complaining when the engine explodes. Key players like Jack Hughes (injured since November), Brett Pesce (arm injury), and Jonathan Kovacevic (knee surgery) are MIA, leaving the Devils with the roster depth of a toddler’s snack drawer. Captain Nico Hischier is producing points but allowing *more* high-danger chances per 60 minutes than last season—because leading a team is hard, even if your defense looks like a group of penguins trying to solve a Rubik’s Cube.

**Humorous Spin: If This Game Were a Metaphor, It’d Be a Broken Blender**  
The Devils’ defense? It’s the NHL’s version of a blender that “liquefies” your hopes and dreams into a slushie of despair. They outshot Vancouver, outpressed them, and still lost—proof that sometimes, effort isn’t enough when your goalie looks like he’s juggling flaming torches (and dropping them). Markström’s inconsistency? It’s like relying on a weather app that says “sunshine” but then rains on your parade.

Meanwhile, the Canucks are the hockey equivalent of a well-oiled toaster: reliable, unexciting, but capable of dropping a perfectly golden bagel (or puck) into your plate. Their win wasn’t pretty, but it was effective—like a spreadsheet that finally balances after three cups of coffee. And Buium? The rookie’s debut was so smooth, he probably texted the Devils’ coaching staff: “Hey, I know I’m new, but can I get a raise?”

**Prediction: Canucks Win Again, Because the Devils’ Playbook Is Written in Cursive**  
Putting it all together: The Canucks’ defensive structure, Demko’s reliability, and Buium’s “I’ve been here forever” energy give them the edge. The Devils, meanwhile, are trapped in a tragicomedy of bad contracts, bad luck, and a coach who still trusts Markström like he’s the last unopened soda in the fridge.

**Final Verdict:** Bet on Vancouver. The Devils’ playoff hopes are about as stable as a Jell-O shot during an earthquake. Unless Fitzgerald trades Hamilton to a team that loves bad contracts, New Jersey’s 2025 season will go down as the NHL’s answer to *Cats*—loved by some, confused by many, and somehow still playing in the same theater.

*Go Canucks! And go get a better GM, Devils.* 🐻🏒

Quick summary of my situation to give some context:

Recently started into the world of espresso with a Sage dual boiler and a Smart Grinder Pro (with the D64 on the way) and when I get the time to dial in new beans correctly, I can make great espresso with the set up. Now the problem is the dialling in new beans part, while serving coffee to my girlfriend and potentially guests.

Now my question:

When I realise during the shot that it’s pulling way too fast and will therefore be incredibly under extracted and sour, could I simply lengthen my shot (so simply aim for about 27 seconds, even though my ratio will be 1:3 or even longer) so “save” it and still be able to serve palatable coffee?

I’m asking this because most of the time my girlfriend will just want to drink some sort of milk drink. A 20s super sour under extracted shot is disgusting. A watered down not so super harsh shot will probably be okay for her as she would otherwise get a horrible machine coffee at work later anyways.

So, does it work that way, or would I simply get a watered down jug of lemon juice?",3,1765905578.0,espresso,10,1.0,False

1po7o0h,https://i.redd.it/zuiwispmnl7g1.png,December coffee round-up ☕,"Tried a few southern coffees this month and thought I’d do a quick round-up. I mostly drink americano and prefer medium-dark roasts.

Roast dates:
All of these were roasted less than a week before delivery, which was great, except Cothas, which had a November roast date.

Hunkal Estate – Aranya Gold
Solid bang for the buck. Clean, balanced, and easy to drink. Nothing flashy, but consistently good. Would happily reorder for the price.

Siruvani – 100% Arabica (Medium Roast)
This one genuinely surprised me. Picked it up for ₹225 for 250g from amazon, which feels almost unreal. Sweet, pleasant, and very forgiving across brews. This is my current daily driver.

Araku – Selection
Honestly a bit mid for me. Roast date was just 2 days old, but the cup leaned too citrusy for my taste. If you like bright, acidic coffees you might enjoy it, just not my thing.

Cothas – 100% Arabica Medium Roast
Decent, classic profile. Nothing wrong with it, but nothing that made me excited either. I probably won’t order it again unless I’ve completely run out, because it delivers in a day on Prime, which is super convenient.

Overall, Siruvani was the standout this month, Hunkal was great value, Araku didn’t click for me, and Cothas is my “backup option” coffee.

Would love to hear from you if you've tried any of these.

1po7nty,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/1po7nty/i_guess_i_am_an_apostate/,I guess I am An Apostate.,"I was asked recently if it was fun to be an apostate. I mean yesterday. I was asked yesterday. It was the first time in my life someone called me that so nonchalantly. The first time someone called me that at all. I knew nothing of this person. Not who they were, or if they were in or out, but at that moment we were both bonded by our shared knowledge of that word. Apostate. There was more common ground than I thought. Even if asking ‘is it fun’ implied a gross perversion of its acquired meaning within the org. A meaning that has become sinful and wrong. A gross miscalculation of my character. It is easier to lump everything and everyone into that category. I understand why you would think I'm having fun but having fun means I look forward to tearing people’s reality apart like some keyboard warrior with face paint ready to bask in the blood of my victims. Let me shatter that reality for you while I drink a nice cup of coffee, I understand that I might ruffle some feathers in the process. That not everyone will find my content useful, but maybe for the one that does…..just maybe it could nudge them forward in the right direction. For the record, I am a 36-year-old mother, a little naïve, and very determined to see these survivors live a happy and fulfilled life. I would rather revel in your accomplishments.

For the record, my answer was No. It brings me no joy in hurting people. At All. Ever. I could walk away right now and live a fulfilling life. A good career, a stable loving husband, a healthy and thriving child. I lose nothing but time. A cost I'm willing to pay if it means sharing what helped me move on. Even if it means being here never fully moving on.",14,1765905468.0,exjw,17,0.89,False

She washed the dishes and did the laundry. She cooked dinner almost daily. That is what her husband expected. If he couldn’t come home to a clean house, he wouldn’t come home at all.

But everyone has their breaking point.

Exasperated, she decided to stop.  Instead of doing the laundry, she went for coffee. Instead of cooking dinner, she took herself out and returned with take out for her dear husband.

As her happiness blossomed, so did the mold. The dirty dishes began to smell. The laundry was now in heaps. She noticed more flies every day. She felt a weight off her shoulders, yet she was living in filth.

When she went out, her life felt picturesque. She started to feel like two different people. Loving half of herself as much as she hated the other. The two identities, once close together like adjoined twins, were now existing at opposite edges of the universe. The force pushing them apart growing stronger by the day. The two of them became their own entities, unaware of what the other was up to through the day.

The blossoming flower existed in the outside world, letting the wind take her in whichever direction it pleased. The blooming mold festered inside with her husband, both succumbing to the rottenness of their humble abode.

The air was dark, thick and waxy. It felt like you were swimming through the grime that hovered and coated the innards of the walls.

At the beach, the blossoming flower waded in the transparent water. Feeling the warmth of the of sun on her lightly burned skin. The air smelled crisp and tickled her nose with the subtle hints of seaweed and salt that meandered through the air.

She returned home.  The house looked as if it was starting to shrivel and sink. She knew she could not live this way. She was beginning to face the fact that she had been neglectful. She was living in an alternate reality. She knew she could find the balance.

She walked to the door, reached her hand to the knob and turned.

Simultaneously inside, the rotten version of herself decided it was time to let some fresh air in. She couldn’t live like this anymore. With the door open, they faced each other and looked deep into each other’s lost eyes. They took a step forward and rejoined into one again. One could not be complete without the other, and they knew this.

Their joined eyes scanned the house.

Where to begin?

They walked to the closet where the filthy broom and the crispy mop were stored.

Opening the door, they pushed aside his goopy, putrefying corpse.

It emitted an odor that burned their nose and blackened their lungs.

They laughed.

Of course, he waited until now to try and find the cleaning supplies.

They would clean the house and make a nice supper. He would enjoy it, because they were finally doing their wifely duties again.",4,1765905181.0,shortscarystories,0,1.0,False

1po7h2s,https://i.redd.it/56fsq2faml7g1.png,Looking for link; Desiring Her All Along,"It was only on our first wedding anniversary that I realized the rubbers I bought before our wedding had long expired.
No one would believe that my mafia husband, Andre Garcia, and I had never consummated our marriage.
That night, I gathered my courage and bought a suggestive nightgown. After downing three glasses of whisky, I hugged Andre tightly and whispered in his ear, ""Darling, let's do it today. I want you...""
However, Andre shook my hand off indifferently as if he were handling a gun. ""Danielle Lawson, do you have no shame? You've done such shameless things time and time again. If you're really that lonely, I'll order you some toys so you can play with them to your heart's content.""
My face turned deathly pale as I stood there, stunned. I could not understand why a wife begging for her husband's affection was considered 'shameless' behavior.
I curled up on the couch, unable to help but ask on social media.
Danielle: [My husband has no dysfunction. Why won't he touch me after marriage?]
Someone replied: [Perhaps your husband has someone else.]
Like a dagger, that comment pierced me awake.
I suddenly realized—maybe the problem was not that I was unattractive but rather that he was never mine.
The moment I deleted my account, I also made the decision to leave.
Who could have imagined that Andre, who would usually not even glance at me, would frantically search for me after I disappeared?
""Danielle, I can't get a hard-on after you left!""

Chapter 1
[Perhaps your husband has someone else.]
The moment I saw the comment, my fingers froze, and I felt like I had fallen into an ice pit.
I turned around to see that the bedside lamp in the bedroom was still on, but Andre Garcia was already out of bed.
The pattering sound of water came from the bathroom, accompanied by a strange noise that made my scalp tingle. My mind went blank as an ominous premonition made me stand up.
Stopping at the bathroom door, I peered in through that tiny gap.
The next second, my mind exploded!
Andre, who had shown no interest in me in the past three years, was propped up against the bathroom wall, his body as tense as a bowstring. He held his member in one hand as he vented frantically and hurriedly.
On the phone screen in front of him was a photo of my younger sister, Maya Lawson.
“Maya...” His voice was hoarse and affectionate with a tenderness and infatuation he had never shown me.
I hurriedly covered my mouth, stifling my scream, and took two steps back as if I had been struck by lightning.
Just as I fled to the living room, I heard his phone, which he had left on the coffee table, vibrate.
I had always known Andre's phone password, but I had never checked it out of respect. Trembling, I typed in the password and opened the messaging app I had never touched.
I tapped into Andre's work group chat.
[Boss, today is your first wedding anniversary with Danielle. It's also the 500th day you've remained chaste for Maya. We've prepared fine wine to celebrate your impending success.]
[You're so patient! Danielle has such a seductive figure. You wouldn't lose anything by touching her!]
[Shut up! Boss has said Danielle is a thief who stole Maya's identity. Just the thought of touching her disgusts him. If the old Don hadn't demanded that boss marry Danielle before passing the position to him, boss would never have agreed to marry her!]
[He only married her to make it easier to dump her later and avenge Maya!]
[It's different now. We've taken control of the Meditera arms line. The Lawson family is useless. Boss, when do you plan to divorce Danielle?]
A new message stopped the following messages. It was Andre's reply, which contained only one word: [Soon]. My heart ached as if pierced by needles. My fingers were icy cold as the phone slipped from my palm.
Memories from four years ago washed over me like a tidal wave. I was an orphan, adopted by a couple abroad. Though we were not related by blood, they doted on me like I was the apple of their eyes.
When I returned four years ago, I unexpectedly learned that my biological parents were actually from the Lawson family, a mafia family. I was maliciously switched at birth, and the person who took my identity was Maya.
The Lawson family could not bear to part with Maya, whom they had raised for over a decade, but I was the one with the Lawson family's bloodline. Therefore, I was the one who married Andre, the heir to the Garcia family, instead of Maya.
I had no intention of stealing Maya's fiancé, but Andre was the one who pursued me relentlessly.
As a mafia boss, countless women wanted to sleep with him. However, he only showed tenderness to me.
Knowing I could not get used to the local food, Andre personally flew his private jet back to Itol to buy me my favorite handmade pizza. When I was awakened by nightmares in the middle of the night, he would gently tell me bedtime stories to lull me back to sleep.
Later, I was kidnapped by rival forces due to family conflicts while my parents were busy celebrating Maya's birthday. Andre and his men rescued me amidst a bullet storm. He even took a bullet for me.
I thought I had found true love and insisted on marrying him, ignoring my adoptive parents' advice. On our wedding night, Andre moved into the study. He did not even… show the slightest desire to be intimate with me.
I thought I had not done enough, but only now did I realize he had desires, but he was simply remaining celibate for the woman he desired.
My chest ached as if a hammer had knocked on it. Tears streamed down my face.
Just then, my phone rang again.
I answered the phone as if my soul had been ripped out. Enzo Romano's deep voice rang out. ""My darling, how have you been? Your mother and I miss you terribly. We'd like to visit you, but are you free?""
After my identity was confirmed, my adoptive parents supported my return to my biological family, even though they were reluctant to let me leave.
I was also reluctant to leave my adoptive parents, who had cherished me since I was little, but I decided to for Andre's sake. I never imagined that this decision would bring me to tears now.
Hearing my adoptive father's concerned voice, I stopped pretending and sobbed, ""Dad, I want to go home.""
""My darling, why are you crying? Who bullied you?"" His voice was filled with worry and anger.
My adoptive parents were the leaders of Pirate Group, which controlled cargo transportation in almost all of North Ameria's ports.
""You're the sole heiress of Pirate Group and our princess. I'll avenge tenfold and even a hundredfold for every grievance you suffer!""

Chapter 2
It was already noon when I woke up the next day.
When I went downstairs, I found two people already sitting at the dining table.
Andre sat upright in the main seat, indifferent and silent. Andre's mother, Elaina Bianchi, joined him. She was stirring her coffee with an exquisite silver teaspoon.
Hearing my footsteps, Elaina looked up. Her eyes locked on my waist as she said meaningfully, ""Danielle, you must be exhausted from last night. Come and sit down.""
I stopped in my tracks and subconsciously looked at Andre. He did not even glance at me. A trace of bitterness flickered in my eyes.
Before I could explain, Elaina pressed again, ""Danielle, you've been married to Andre for a year. How come there's no sign of pregnancy at all? I'm waiting to have my grandchild.""
""I've made efforts—"" I answered dryly when Andre interrupted me indifferently.
""Mom, don't worry about this. You'll have your grandchild... soon. Be patient.""
Having received Andre's assurance, Elaina instantly breathed a sigh of relief and smiled. She gave me a few words of advice and then left.
The door closed, and the living room immediately fell silent except for the ticking of the clock.
I looked blankly at Andre, wondering, 'Why did he say that? We haven't been intimate... How would we conceive a baby?'
Perhaps my gaze had lingered on him for too long. Andre finally looked up with a sneer. ""Just because I didn't satisfy you yesterday, you deliberately put on an act in front of my mother?""
My face turned ghastly pale. ""I didn't...""
""You didn't?"" He violently pressed me against the edge of the dining table. His body leaned close, making it hard for me to breathe. ""Then why didn't you change out of your outfit? Are you so horny that you want to seduce me even during the day?""
It was then that I realized that I was still wearing the suggestive nightgown from last night. I awkwardly covered my chest, yet the straps slipped down, revealing my fair shoulders.
With just a slight tilt of his head, he could see even more of what lay beneath.
Andre's throat bobbed involuntarily.
Just then, the message his subordinate had texted him came to mind.
[Danielle has such a seductive figure. You wouldn't lose anything by touching her!]
Andre shoved me abruptly as if he had been doused with ice water, sobering him. When he looked at me again, his gaze had returned to its usual indifference and aloofness. ""Don't overthink it. I've already made arrangements for our child.""
I froze in place, wondering, 'What kind of arrangements could he possibly make?'
As soon as Andre finished speaking, a group of strangers in white coats with medical badges hanging around their necks filed in. They pushed gleaming medical kits as they lined up.
A bad premonition welled up inside me.
The doctor leading the group respectfully asked, ""Don Garcia, shall we begin now?""
A chill ran down my spine, and I instinctively took two steps back. Two burly bodyguards immediately stepped forward, grabbing my arms and pinning me down.
""Let me go! What are you doing?""
I was dragged to the villa's private medical room, and my limbs were firmly strapped to the operating table.
The doctors began skillfully operating the instruments. The cold lights came on, making me shiver.
""Andre! Have you lost your mind? What are you trying to do to me?""

Chapter 3
Andre had no intention of explaining. He did not even look at me, his gaze fixed only on the leading doctor as he nodded simply.
The doctor immediately straightened his back and respectfully walked toward me, who had been forcibly pressed onto the operating table. ""Mrs. Garcia, this is an ovulation induction drug. It might hurt a little, but please cooperate.""
I was taken aback. Recalling what Andre had just said, my face paled. ""Are you trying to have a baby through IVF?""
Andre finally turned around and gave me a cold gaze. ""Haven't you always wanted to give me a baby? I'm giving you this chance now.""
My lips trembled, but I could not say a word.
The needle in the doctor's hand, which was thicker than I imagined, reflected coldly as it slowly approached like some kind of torture device.
I could not help asking hoarsely, ""Andre, why do you have to do it this way?""
If he were just willing to touch me once, I would not have to suffer such humiliation under the cold operating light.
Andre frowned and answered icily, ""It's for the common interest of the Garcia family and the Lawson family, of course. We must have a child.""
It turned out... it was just about interests. The last bit of hope I had for him in my heart shattered instantly.
Children should be the continuation of love, not victims born out of necessity.
I clenched my hands tightly, my nails sinking into my palms. ""I refuse.""
Andre froze. It was the first time I had refused his request. I had always obediently done whatever he asked. Now, I was not even willing to have his child.
He could sense the change.
A feeling of loss of control and displeasure instantly welled up in Andre. He frowned, gripping my chin tightly and forcing me to look up. ""Repeat that.""
The pain in my chin made my eyes redden, but I insisted, ""I said, I refuse!""
Andre's eyes flickered with impatience and confusion for a second. He never needed to guess what others were thinking as everyone was afraid of him. I was the exception. However, he instantly extinguished that emotion.
He scoffed. ""Danielle, do you think I'd touch you for the sake of conceiving a child? Let me tell you, I have absolutely no desire for you.""
His remark instantly shattered my mind. He flung me away and turned around as if discarding a worthless object. “Danielle, you have no right to disobey my orders. You must give me a child.”
With a wave of his hand, the group of people bound me firmly to the bed, ignoring my fierce struggles.
I desperately reached out to grab Andre, but I could not even touch the hem of his clothes. I could only watch him leave without looking back.
The intense pain as the needle pierced my skin made me curl up involuntarily. The tears that had been welling up in my eyes finally rolled down. The anesthesia gradually took effect, and my consciousness began to blur.
In the last second before I lost consciousness, I could not help but wonder, 'Why? Why did Andre, who had held my hand at our wedding and spoken so gently to me... become this way?'
…
The next day, I woke up with an intense headache.
The doctor stood by my bedside, pushing an incubator toward me. ""Mrs. Garcia, the fertilized eggs are being cultivated. Look.""
Neatly arranged petri dishes filled the transparent incubator.
I was stunned. ""Are these my children? They're completely different from the warm and adorable little angel I imagined.""
Even more ironically... Andre had refused to touch me till the very end. He must have been looking at Maya's picture when giving them his sperm sample.
It was disgusting. I covered my mouth and gagged violently, almost unable to breathe.
The doctor beside me was startled. ""Are you alright? You need to be in good health so that we can put the fertilized eggs back into your body... Mrs. Garcia, what are you doing?""

Chapter 4
I could no longer listen to the doctor's words. I grabbed the incubator and threw it hard on the ground. ""I said, I refuse to have children this way.""
I pulled off the expensive diamond necklace around my neck and handed it to the doctor. ""How much did Andre pay you? I'll pay ten times as much as he did. You can't tell him a single word about what just happened.""
The doctor wiped the cold sweat off his forehead and replied, ""But—""
I calmly interrupted, ""No buts.""
I made up my mind to leave Andre. There was no way I would bear him a child. I wanted to say goodbye to everything related to him.
...
After the doctor left, I forced myself out of bed and started packing.
The air here was thick with Andre's presence. It was suffocating.
I dragged my suitcase out the door and immediately drove toward the private racetrack by the sea. All because I loved racing, my adoptive mother, Chiara Lombardi, spent a fortune converting this abandoned mountain forest into a racetrack as a wedding gift for me.
She said she wanted it to be a quiet place for me to heal when I was feeling down.
As soon as I reached the entrance, I saw the familiar black sports car; it was Andre's custom model.
Beside the car stood his core subordinates. These men had changed out of their dark mafia uniforms and were wearing expensive custom suits, but they still sported the black lapel pins that symbolized their status.
It was a typical mafia gathering.
The car door opened, and Andre got out first. Then, he carefully bent over and lifted Maya out. He was gentler than I had ever seen him before.
Maya wrapped her arms around his neck, shyly saying, ""Andre, put me down. Everyone's watching.""
Andre did not stop. He just carried her through the crowd amidst their whistling. ""Let them watch.""
Only after entering the racetrack did he gently put Maya down.
As soon as Maya steadied herself, she looked up and saw me not far away. Her expression stiffened. ""Danielle, what are you doing here?""
Andre finally shifted his gaze from Maya. He glanced at me and frowned. The doctor had told him I was not feeling well after the egg retrieval, so he was confused why I was running around like this.
An inexplicable irritation welled up inside Andre. ""Danielle, who asked you to come?""
I remained calm. ""I'm here to race…""
""Danielle, you're not trying to say you're here to race, are you?""
The subordinates standing beside Andre immediately interrupted me and laughed mockingly.
""You? Race cars? Even a simple corner overtake would probably make you scream! I bet you know Andre's here, so you're just making excuses to cling to him!""
""It's okay if you don't know how to race cars. I'll teach you personally. Saves you the trouble of covering up your lie.""
""Tsk, just don't mistake the accelerator for the brake!""
Their gazes lingered brazenly on me.
Although they all knew I was adopted by a couple from Itol at a young age, they had no idea my adoptive parents were related to Pirate Group. They just thought I was some unsophisticated country bumpkin and never really respected me.
Andre's hands clenched involuntarily while his eyes were icy.
Maya spoke up at the right moment. ""You're not allowed to talk about my sister like that.""
She seemed to be speaking up for me, but her actions just made her friends chime in sarcastically.
""Maya, you can't blame others for being so blunt. It's your sister's fault for having such a vixen-like figure! Those big breasts must be implants!""
""Yeah, you're both daughters of the Lawson family, but why does she look so... unrefined?""
When I was found, my biological father had already groomed Maya as the heiress. He publicly declared that we were both daughters of the Lawson family. It was only due to a hospital error that they lost me. Therefore, everyone assumed Maya and I were sisters.
Maya glanced at me nervously, afraid I would reveal the truth in public. However, I just gave them a blank look and turned around to walk toward the racetrack's preparation area.
Maya breathed a sigh of relief and quickly said to Andre, ""Andre, don't be mad at Danielle. The race is about to start. I heard the prize is the Heart of the Ocean necklace. Legend says that if you give this necklace to your loved one, you'll be together forever.""
Andre nodded and led the crowd away.
I walked alone into the racing preparation area and took out my usual helmet and gloves from the locker.
I had no intention of participating in the race. I just wanted to run a few laps on the private track.
When I stepped out of the preparation area, Andre's race had already been going on for a long time.
Just as I was about to start my car, a sharp, piercing gunshot rang out, followed by an announcement that the race was over.
I glanced up at the track and saw the crowd scattering. Only Maya and the others remained in the stands, their expressions grave and anxious. Andre was nowhere to be seen.
A bad feeling washed over me.
I hurried over and asked with a frown, ""What's wrong?""
Maya broke down in tears. ""Danielle, Andre is missing!""

Chapter 5
I was taken aback. I wanted to divorce Andre, but in our world, going missing was a serious issue.
""How could he have gone missing?"" My voice turned cold. It was a tone I only used when I felt threatened.
Maya sobbed out the words, ""Andre was about to win the race, but who would've thought that the blue racing car following him would suddenly accelerate? Not only did it deliberately overtake his car, but someone also stuck their head out of the window while holding a gun…""
""To avoid the bullets, he could only turn the steering wheel sharply. He didn't follow the original track and turned into the abandoned path on the east... That car also rushed in!""
I instantly felt a headache, and my expression turned livid. ""Stop crying! Instead of crying, we should think of a way to save him!""
Andre's underling stood in front of Maya, glaring at me angrily. ""Why are you so harsh with Maya? No one expected such a thing to happen tonight. That path is full of thorns and gravel. Ordinary cars can't even drive two feet. We can only wait for professional help...
""Danielle, what are you trying to do?""
I was already in the car. The engine roared. I put on my gloves, my eyes as calm as still water. As I shifted gears, I said, ""Waiting won't save him unless you're all planning to take Andre home in a body bag.""
With that said, the racecar shot off like an arrow.
The crowd was dumbfounded for a long time.
""She doesn't seem like someone who's never driven a race car before... Could it be that we misunderstood her?""
They did not notice Maya's fingers digging into her palm as she looked at me jealously.
I quickly spotted the path hidden by weeds. It used to be an emergency route for the mafia's smuggling convoy. Now, it was a death trap for anyone unaware of its danger.
Luckily, I was familiar with it.
I slammed on the gas pedal and sped into the path, following the faint tire tracks.
Why was I trying to save Andre? The reason was simple.
First, this racetrack was in my name. If Andre were to die here, the Garcia family would cause me trouble. Secondly, it was also because I owed it to Andre.
Years ago, I was kidnapped by the Lawson family's arch-enemies not long after I returned. My biological parents were busy throwing my sister's birthday party and did not even answer the ransom call.
Andre was the one who answered. He tore down the warehouse wall to find me and was shot in the back. The bullet got close to his heart. He almost died.
This was not a small debt, and it had to be paid off.
After driving for what felt like forever, I was the first to spot the wreckage. Metal fragments surrounded a dead tree while thick smoke billowed upward.
Andre was slumped over the steering wheel, unconscious, while blood streamed down his temple.
His gas tank was on fire!
I flung open his car door, held his shoulders with my arms, and dragged him out.
His tightly shut eyes twitched slightly as he murmured, ""Maya, when I get the necklace... I'll give it to you...""
A bitter smile crept onto my lips. ""Andre, you'd risk your life just to please Maya?""
He did not answer.
Just then, the sound of an engine came from behind. It was the blue racecar. It had found us.
I pushed Andre into the passenger seat of my car, climbed in, and slammed into reverse. The killer's bumper slammed heavily into where we were earlier.
I fished out the gun I had prepared beforehand, pulled the trigger, and fired a bullet straight into the killer's gas tank.
With a loud bang, the hood of the blue racecar exploded, billowing thick smoke.
However, the bastard was not done. A bullet pierced our windshield, going straight for Andre's chest.
I did not think with my head; I just moved and shielded Andre with my body like I was a human shield. The bullet struck my shoulder, and excruciating pain erupted instantly. I gasped, raised my gun again, and fired the remaining bullets from the magazine at the killer until he collapsed to the ground, motionless.
Only when the chaos subsided did I realize blood was streaming down my arm. My vision began to blur. However, Andre was alive.
Just as he had saved me, I had saved him.
With my good hand, I gripped the steering wheel tightly, sped off, and tried my best to bring him back to the racetrack.
When everyone saw me covered in blood, they were speechless with astonishment.
With all my might, I pushed Andre toward Maya, my voice so weak that it was almost inaudible. ""Tell Andre I've repaid the debt I owe him...""
After saying that, everything went black, and I passed out.
...
When I woke up again, I was lying in a hospital bed. My gunshot wound to the shoulder had been treated.
I instinctively asked, ""Where's the man who was brought in with me?""
A nurse directed me to his ward.
Just as I reached the door, I heard Andre's underling say, ""Andre, Maya risked her life to save you. You must repay her properly!""
My heart stopped.

Chapter 6
Who were they to give Maya credit for saving Andre? It was clearly my blood that spilled on the road!
In the ward, Maya's voice trembled with just the right amount of guilt and feigned vulnerability. ""Andre... It's all my fault. If you weren't trying to win me a prize, you wouldn't have fallen into their trap. It was my duty to save you.""
She paused for a second before adding with a voice full of hurt and innocence, ""You don't have to leave Heart of the Ocean to me as compensation. I know you care about Danielle the most. She was kidnapped back then, but you risked your own life to save her...""
Andre's underling retorted agitatedly. ""It's not like that. That was a trap deliberately set up by boss.""
Maya froze in place. ""What?""
The underling continued casually, ""Boss had someone kidnap her to make it clear to your parents that you were the most important to them! It was also to scare her off and make her go back to her adoptive parents.""
A bloody taste welled up in my throat.
The underling added at great length, ""As for marrying her? Boss's parents forced him to ally with the Lawson family, so he married Danielle, who has the Lawson family's blood. Don't worry. When you successfully become the heiress of the Lawson family, Andre will divorce her and hold a grand wedding to marry you. Right, boss?""
A brief silence fell over the ward.
Andre's voice broke the silence. It was deep, steady, and ruthless. ""Yes.""
I stumbled back a step. For so long, I believed that the bullet he took for me meant something. I believed that his post-marital indifference was merely estrangement, not deception. I believed... Gosh, I was such a fool!
My phone in my pocket suddenly vibrated, interrupting my near-breakdown. It was Chiara, her voice still loving. ""Darling, the ship I arranged will arrive at the port tomorrow. I can't wait to see you.""
""Okay, Mom."" My voice trembled almost imperceptibly.
After ending the call, I looked up at the ward door with a bitter yet resolute smile.
Fine! This way, we were completely even.
I had saved Andre, repaying the debt of that fake kidnapping years ago. All this while, he had been scheming against me. I had finally seen through this marriage that only existed in name.
We would never have anything to do with each other again for the rest of our lives.
…
The following day, I was exceptionally busy.
First, I contacted a lawyer to draft a divorce agreement and placed the signed papers in Andre's study. Then, I drove to a private club to meet a friend who was an excellent asset strategist.
When I first arrived here, my adoptive parents prepared a vast fortune for me as a safety net.
Many of the arms dealers who partnered with the Lawson and Garcia families were their subordinates, and they were always at my beck and call.
Despite possessing immense wealth, I had always kept a low profile and never told anyone about it. Now that I was leaving, these assets should be entrusted to someone I trust.
I pushed a folder across the table, saying, ""I'm leaving. You're in charge of everything.""
My friend quickly glanced at the file before staring at me. ""You're terminating all contracts with the Garcia and Lawson families?""
I nodded. ""Effective immediately.""
He whistled. ""They rely on your resources to survive. Without you, they'll collapse.""
""That's no longer my problem.""
""They'll regret it once they know your true identity."" He gave a meaningful smile.
After exchanging pleasantries for a while, I bade goodbye. When I went downstairs, I accidentally tugged on my wound. The pain almost made me fall.
My friend instinctively reached out to support my waist. ""Be careful. You're still injured.""
I thanked him softly and tried to steady myself. However, I saw Andre and his underlings coming out of the neighboring private room the moment I looked up.
One of his underlings noticed me first. He glanced at Andre beside me and showed a malicious smile.
""Hey, look who's here. Don Garcia, isn't this your wife? She found herself a lover right after leaving the hospital?
""Even if Don Garcia can't satisfy you, you shouldn't be this desperate, right? Where does that leave Don Garcia's pride?""

Chapter 7
Andre stood behind the group, his expression terrifyingly gloomy. His cold, murderous eyes were fixed on something—my friend's hand placed on my waist.
However, his underlings failed to notice his anger and continued to fan the flames.
""This guy? He looks like he could faint from carrying groceries. Do you really think he can satisfy you?""
""If you're really that desperate, just ask us, sweetheart. Why do you have to sneak around with a weak and incompetent guy?""
Their shrill laughter resounded throughout the corridor until Andre moved.
He cut through the crowd like a blade and walked straight up to me. His voice was deep, his emotion indiscernible. ""Danielle, explain.""
I did not even blink. ""Make way.""
We were about to get divorced. What right did he have to question me?
My nonchalance made his anger surface to the top. He seized my hand, and the laughter around him came to an abrupt halt. ""Danielle, what do you mean by this?""
He exerted so much strength that he almost crushed my bones. He added with a sneer, ""Are you really that horny? Will any man do?""
This insult should have broken my heart, but my heart was already numb.
My friend tried to interject, ""Danielle and I aren't—""
I interrupted him. I stood on tiptoe, leaned close to Andre's ear, and said with a smile, ""That's right. You can't even satisfy your own wife. Of course, I had to find someone else.""
The entire corridor fell silent instantly.
Everyone's jaw dropped. They all knew Andre had never touched me, but they also knew I was devoted to him. Their insults were just a joke. No one believed I would actually cheat.
The last trace of warmth vanished from Andre's face, leaving only hostility. Without warning, he hoisted me onto his shoulder.
""Andre! Put me down."" My fists pounded on his back, but to no avail.
He threw me roughly into the back seat of his car, and the driver immediately got out.
In the confined space, Andre leaned down, trapping me firmly between the seat and his arm. ""Danielle, say that again.""
I raised my voice and retorted, ""I found someone else...""
Before I could finish speaking, he yanked off his tie, his eyes filled with suppressed possessiveness. ""What do you want? I'll give it to you myself!""
He lowered his head and kissed me. It was a rough, punitive kiss. There was no tenderness or consideration—only anger, possessiveness, and deep frustration.
I held my breath. This was the first kiss since our wedding rings bound us together. I pushed against his shoulders as panic rose within me, but he easily subdued me.
The touch of our lips was both familiar and strange. As Andre kissed me, his eyes glazed over. He thought, 'This woman's lips are so soft.'
His hand unconsciously moved to my shoulder, and I groaned in pain. He froze.
Just then, Andre's phone vibrated violently in his pocket. Maya's name flashed on the screen. Andre hesitated for a moment before answering the call. ""Maya? If it's not urgent, don't bother me...""
The person on the other end of the line said something, and his expression changed abruptly. ""What did you say? Maya is in the emergency room?""

Chapter 8
I had just come to my senses from Andre's forceful kiss. I struggled to get out of the car, but Andre closed the door even faster.
The driver slid back into the driver's seat. Andre's order pierced through the air like a gunshot. ""Go to the hospital. Immediately.""
On my way to the private hospital, I finally pieced together the whole story from the snippet of Andre's conversation over the phone earlier.
It turned out that someone had exposed on the dark web that Maya was not of the Lawson family's bloodline. She was merely an orphan with good luck and a well-fabricated lie.
Although my biological parents had stepped forward to give a statement, the public release of her orphanage file still exposed the truth.
Maya's status as the successor was being questioned.
The Lawson family's enemies were as restless as sharks that had smelled blood.
Under all that heavy pressure, Maya actually attempted suicide.
Andre gritted his teeth and stared icily at me. ""Danielle, you have to attend the family meeting in half an hour. You must publicly admit that Maya is your biological sister.""
I could not help laughing sharply and icily. ""Why?""
He spoke as if he were explaining the obvious to a stubborn child. ""Because they'll only believe you right now. As the long-lost biological daughter of the Lawson family, why would you relinquish your inheritance to her if Maya weren't your biological sister? They'll have no choice but to believe you if you admit it.""
Every word he spoke conformed to political logic. However, logic meant nothing to someone who had always lived in the shadow of their family.
I asked again with a gentle hint of murderous intent, ""I asked why.""
Why should I clean up the mess left by a woman who had stolen my parents from me? Why should I protect someone who had snatched my inheritance",1,1765905050.0,Novelnews,2,1.0,False

1po7gc6,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ecsCoffeeInc/comments/1po7gc6/coffee_espresso_faqs_everything_you_need_to_know/,Coffee & Espresso FAQs: Everything You Need to Know This Holiday Season,"The holiday season is here, and if you’re shopping for coffee lovers, or even just trying to upgrade your own home setup, you’ve probably found yourself with a few questions. From beans to espresso machines, coffee can seem complicated, but it doesn’t have to be.

Here’s a roundup of some of the most frequently asked we tend to see:

# 1. What’s the difference between coffee and espresso?

**Answer:** Espresso is a brewing method, not a type of coffee bean. It’s made by forcing hot water through finely ground coffee under pressure. This creates a small, concentrated shot with a rich flavour and crema on top. Regular coffee, like drip or pour-over, uses a slower extraction process and produces a larger cup that’s generally lighter in body.

# 2. Do I need special beans for espresso?

**Answer:** Technically, any coffee bean can be used for espresso. However, beans labeled “espresso roast” are roasted with the intention of being brewed as espresso and may be best enjoyed that way, same goes for ""coffee beans"". If you want versatility, you can use espresso beans for drip coffee too. 

# 3. How long do coffee beans stay fresh?

**Answer:** Coffee beans are best within 1-6 weeks of roasting for optimal flavour. Store them in an airtight container away from light, heat, and moisture.

# 4. Do I need an expensive machine to make good espresso at home?

**Answer:** Not necessarily. While high-end machines offer precision and consistency, many compact machines deliver excellent results for home use. Pairing a good grinder with your machine makes a bigger difference than the machine. The quality of espresso is heavily impacted by the grind size, and consistency, which is the grinders job! 

# 5. Can I make milk-based drinks like lattes and cappuccinos at home?

**Answer:** Absolutely! Most home espresso machines come with a steam wand or automatic milk frother. Even small machines can create silky microfoam perfect for lattes and cappuccinos. 

# 6. Should I buy whole beans or pre-ground coffee?

**Answer:** Whole beans are ideal because they stay fresher longer and give better flavour. Pre-ground coffee is convenient, but it loses flavour quicker. If you're shopping for someone that does not have a grinder consider buying your coffee from somewhere that can grind the beans fresh for you!

# 7. What’s the difference between a semi-automatic (or manual) and automatic machine?

**Answer:** Semi-automatic machines require the user to control extraction time and milk frothing manually, giving more control over the drink. Automatic machines handle more of the process for you. For gifts, semi-automatic machines are fun for hands-on coffee lovers, while automatic machines are great for convenience.

# 8. How do I know if someone likes espresso or regular coffee?

**Answer:** If you’re unsure, stick with versatile gifts: medium roast beans, a nice mug or tumbler, or a brewing method like an AeroPress or pour-over kit. These options work for both coffee and espresso lovers.

# 9. What is a “single origin” coffee?

**Answer:** Single origin coffee comes from one region, farm, or estate. These coffees highlight unique flavors from their specific location, unlike blends, which combine beans for balance.

# 10. Is it better to gift a machine or accessories?

**Answer:** It depends on the recipient. Machines are great for someone starting their coffee journey, while accessories or specialty beans are ideal for someone who already has a setup. Gift bundles that combine beans + accessories are often the most appreciated.

Whether you’re gifting a coffee setup or just upgrading your own morning routine, understanding the basics makes every cup better. Coffee and espresso aren’t just drinks, they’re experiences, and this holiday season is the perfect time to explore them!

This post also includes my review of the recent Yule release, **Her Sea** (which turned out to be one of those true loves).

\~\~\~

**A Long and Elegant Nose** \[The opulent scent of a high society anti-heroine. Luminous amber, polished to a gleaming shine and set in gold\] - Just golden amber, but *what* an amber. It's warm, rich, glowing, vanillic without being foody or sweet, luminous without too much labdanum, which can often go a touch animalic on my skin. This is nothing like Nocturne Alchemy's **Saphir**, their flagship golden amber and my all-time favorite amber - much less balsamic - nor is it like **Bastet's Amber** which for me is much more muted and dull in comparison with **A Long and Elegant Nose**. It does remind me a bit of Nui Cobalt's best amber, found in **Fairy Lights**. There's no spice to this, which sets it apart from the frequent amber-spice or amber-cardamom combinations. Unlike **NA Sky Amber** or Arcana's own **Estella**, both of which read to me like a mix of golden and airy white ambers, this is a pure, deep golden amber. Yeah, it's *just* an amber, but I really love it, and especially reach for it in fall.

**All Saint's Moon** \[A reverential blend of cool vanilla musk and sweet jasmine with gentle swirls of copal smoke enfleurage, Spanish clementine, young honeysuckle shoots, gardenia petals, consecrated water, melted beeswax, silken robes, palo santo, and a single feather\] - Oof was this ever a scrubber. It smells great in the vial, all beautiful florals with a hint of copal, but on my skin the smoke from the copal (and palo santo?) comes out in a BIG way and completely takes over the whole thing like a bbq fire. A bonfire made of floral bouquets, maybe. I can't handle it.

**Anthropophagia** \[Vanilla-infused pear sorbet with sugarcane, white amber, and a drop of French cognac absolute\] - Sweet, musky, and almost grainy pear flesh and golden cognac, much more pear-ish and more gourmand than the airy **Her Sky**. In fact, I don't think I get any white amber here! In fact, I could have guessed golden amber as a note. The cognac gets a custardy, almost bread-pudding-y quality in the drydown. I'm thrilled to have tried this - I've heard so much about it! - but I prefer **Her Sky** over this, and for sweet pear-vanilla, I have **NA White Pear Crystalline**. I would have happily kept this, it was fine, but I ended up passing it along to a friend who was desperately in search of it. This one does have a bit of a cult following.

**Black Tea (layering note)** \[A smoky, rich, sexy black tea\] - A very dark tea (though not a smoky one) with nuances of blackberry and patchouli (""notes"" in the way that you'd describe wine or coffee with notes). In the vial, it had smelled like blackberry and incense, which had me really excited, but on my skin there's a very patchouli-like earthiness that makes this not quite work for me.

**Cailleach** \[As one of the most ancient Celtic goddesses, she is the dark mother, winter witch, and terrifying hag.  She rides a giant wolf and smashes her staff against the ground to bring about geimhreadh. This is the essence of autumn's end and winter's beginning. It is the scent of birth and decay, motherly nurturing and deepest danger. An atmospheric with both bleak and cozy aspects. No further notes will be given.\] - Umm, *what?* There aren't really any concrete notes given, and I can't confidently explain what I'm smelling, either! I was initially worried about the ""bleak"" and""decay"" descriptions, but after I saw a review or two saying that this was actually rather cuddly, I sought out one for myself. And...well, I don't hate it, but it's not a favorite for me either. (Honestly, with Arcana, I've come to realize a scent basically requires either their silk or cashmere notes for it to be a true love for me.) I'll do my best to describe what I'm getting here: fog musk, kind of damp and atmospheric (but no petrichor) and floaty; plus a hefty heaping of coconut (what??); plus a sheepy kind of wool, much more like Nui Cobalt's cashmere than Arcana's cashmere note. It's kinda sorta giving me **Nui Cobalt House of Transcendence** \[Top notes of wild blueberry and morning fog, a heart of pale lilac and cashmere, with a base of orris and white amber\] vibes if I squint at it, what with the fog and cashmere and orris, but of course no blueberry or lilac. And a whole lotta coconut (kind of like **BPAL Dorian v.3** now that I think about it, though I was just first-testing that the day before I tried **Cailleach** so it was on my mind).

**Her Sea** \[A blend of softest fog, rich, animalic ambergris, radiant salt crystals, clouds over the ocean, gentle musks, and a hint of ruffled carnation petals. A soft yet animalic aquatic\] - Okay now *this* one works for me. Arcana's signature silk note, with an airy saline musk and a hint of minerality. This isn't dissimilar to their **Skadi** but of course without peppermint; it's a ghostly vapor and smells like what I imagine **NA Ghost Musk** is like, including a far-off, phantom hint of floral. Carnation notes usually amp on me to fill a whole room with a shout of ""CLOVE!!"" but happily, there's nothing of the sort here, just a memory of a slightly spicy white floral. This reminds me a bit of Arcana's old scent **Ghosting** \[The refined, elegant essence of chilled champagne, sparkling mineral water, white coconut, and soft, creamy gardenia petals\] but without the metallic tang and effervescent aldehydes. It also reminds me of **Moth-Like Stars/On the Wing**, with its unsweetened silk/cashmere. Arcana does these sort of cold, airy aquatics SO well.

**Isolde** \[White chocolate, pale almond milk, delicate vanilla, cream, and a touch of sheer musk\] - ""Pale almond milk"" this is *not*, this is a whack across the head with Disaronno almond liqueur! It's softened and sweetened by melted white chocolate and whipped cream. Actually this would be quite a stunning and decadent dessert cocktail, but it's too foody and sweet for me to wear as a perfume. Eventually it dries down to a nutty, vaguely sweet almond milk.

**Jezebel** \[Tiare, gardenia, jasmine, tuberose, and stephanotis are suffused with white musk, pearl musk, and citron\] - I would definitely call this a *red* musk - pink, slightly fruity, much more body than a white musk - infused with a veritable bouquet of bold white (but completely non-indolic) florals. Mostly gardenia. No tiare to be found, or at least not the kind of tiare as in Arcana's **Tiare layering note** (and I'm pretty sure that tiare is the floral in **Nacre** \- this is not like that). This sample is old, I'm not sure how old, and it has mellowed as it has aged, like a fine wine - rich and swirling and not nearly as dainty and white as the notes description makes it sound. The perfume's name, **Jezebel**, really does make sense for this one.

**Lofn** \[A single dewy rose rests on a bed of bright violet blossoms, silky velvet, purple iris petals, orris root, apple peel, the arc of a rainbow, and wild berry nectar\] - Oh boo, something about this isn't working for me.This smells extremely purple-berry in the vial, but on my skin it reads like plasticky cellophane, plus a tart, bright green apple and a background of violet pastilles. Oddly, I get no rose at all, despite that being the first listed note. I tend to love Arcana's fabric (their silk and cashmere are soooo swoony) and their fanciful irridescent notes, so I was eager to try their velvet and ""rainbow"" here, but alas, this scent just doesn't do it for me. Husband walked in and asked ""why are you wearing something that smells like Jolly Ranchers?"" and definitely got the green apple from across the room!

**Love** \[A breathtaking vanilla accord is accompanied by fresh cream, sugarcane, soft musk, and a pinch of tea leaves\] - This has not fallen prey to the sourness that some folks get with some of Arcana's milk/cream notes, hooray! But I'm really only getting sweetened oat milk. There's a definite soft oaty vibe, almost cooked oats like oatmeal, along with creamy milk and a sugary vanilla. I sought this out for the tea leaves, but I'm not getting any black tea (or green or white tea) at all. Husband sniffed my wrist and said, ""oh, it's instant apple cinnamon oatmeal!"" so in addition to the cooked oats vibe that I'm getting, he also smelled a bit of fruit and spice as well. Interesting! But it's not going to join my collection.

**Medea** \[Opening with ripe cassis berries and pink pepper, the drydown reveals salty, musky notes of Cetalox and Ambroxan, a bit of juicy raspberry, a hint of iris, and a base of amber resin and blonde woods. A sexy dark fruit scent with amber and pink pepper\] - Blackberry-like cassis and a whole *fistful* of black pepper, sharp and sneeze-inducing and kind of awesome paired with the airy-salty notes. I get a background of woods and amber, and no florals whatsoever. It's nice, but not exceptional. It reminds me of **Poesie Ladybird** \[Caramelized fig, smoky lapsang souchong tea leaves, pink peppercorn, cashmere vanilla musk, myrrh resin\] with its purple fig, pink pepper, and smoky black tea, and certainly fills the same niche in my collection, but I do like **Ladybird** better. And, though his opinion doesn't always matter much (he always says that he disliking something doesn't mean I shouldn't keep it), Husband had a negative reaction to this one when he sniffed my wrist. So to the destash it went. (And I was reminded to pull out **Ladybird** more often!)

**Nimue** \[Ethereal Tahitian vanilla, rich Réunion Island vanilla, pink guava, white chocolate, soft jasmine grandiflorum, pillowy pink musk, raindrops shimmering on blue water, a sliver of Mysore sandalwood, and a hint of Gallic cognac\] - Almost neon pink in its scent color, and gently (not overwhelmingly) sweet. It's similar to **Pink Moonbeams** \[A sugared gourmand blend of juicy passion fruit, velvety purple iris, Tahitian vanilla beans, pink candyfloss, reflected sunshine, sheer layers of soft orris, glowing musk, and a hint of wild lavender stems\] but less sweet, and without the sunshine musk. It's also a cousin to **Fae Haven** \[Peach ice cream cones, orange flowers, white chocolate, and magnolia blossoms lead to a drydown of sheer, pretty musk, apple slices, fairy mounds, peach nectar, dewy rose petals, lily of the valley, and green grass\] with its tropical fruit vibe and white chocolate. I was worried about the jasmine - Arcana's jasmine usually goes tragically indolic on me - but while there's just a tiny hint of the jasmine, it is softened by the white chocolate. They drydown is really pretty, with a shimmery musk emerging (this must be the ""raindrops""). Of these three Arcana scents (Nimue, Pink Moonbeams, and Fae Haven) this one is my favorite, largely because of that raindrop musk drydown, but it *still* ended up on (on second wear) having too much jasmine for me. Tragic. I wish Arcana's jasmine note worked for me.

**Peaches Crave Haint** \[The gossamer sweetness of delicate white peaches with Arcana Wildcraft's Haint (white musk, vanilla musk, Madagascar vanilla, sugarcane, and a faint trail of white pepper)\] - I was not wildly impressed by **Haint** \- it was fine, but it didn't stand out to me in a sea of great vanilla musks - but I really love the way it's used in Craves. **Pumpkins Crave Quietude** is one of my fall beloveds, and the delicate, softly sweet but not syrupy white peach (and it's definitely white peach) compliments **Haint** beautifully. I'm getting way more white pepper here than I do in plain **Haint**, which makes this much more atmospheric than gourmand.

**Sagittarius** \[A rich blend of warm woods, benzoin resin, sacred incense, bittersweet Peruvian chocolate, dark amber, cedarwood shards, and black Mexican vanilla. A woody, resinous atmospheric with plenty of dark chocolate and incense\] - I ordered this from someone's destash with a little trepidation (several reviews said it was much too heavy on the cedar and went all pencil shavings/gerbil bedding), but the price was right and with woods being the first listed note, I figured if I didn't like it, my husband maybe might. I'm delighted to say that I do like it! And despite the chocolate and vanilla notes, it really is an atmospheric rather than a gourmand. The chocolate is dark and rich, almost coffee-like, but it is tempered by a really lovely airy and sweet vanilla. Behind these are warm golden amber and almost sparkly hints of incense, reminding me a little bit of the incense in **Haul** but less smoky - in fact, there's no smoke at all to this. The cedar and woods are definitely present, but they merely make it thoroughly autumnal. There's a mildly sour tang to this that somehow just makes it feel quintessentially and immediately recognizably ""Arcana."" The drydown is really spectacular, the faintly medicinal tone of the opening disappearing and the incense gaining a bit more prominance among the chocolate, vanilla, and amber, and at this point I became certain I'd keep this and love it. I'm also really happy to have an Arcana chocolate scent that isn't 1000% percent gourmand or, conversely, too dark (for my taste) with patchouli and/or leather. I've especially been enjoying **Sagittarius** in fall and early winter.

**Sjöfn** \[Chilled lemon cakes drizzled with vanilla icing, a profusion of hyacinth, lilac, and gardenia petals, creamy sandalwood, a soft pile of pillows, and a touch of carrot seed\] - When I first applied it, I got (in this order) grass, vanilla cake, heady gardenia, and then a powdery lily note, and as it dried, this became mostly that powdery lily floral. I suppose that's easily my nose interpreting the hyacinth and lilac, and I suppose the carrot seed is what seems so much like grass, but seriously, where's the lemon?? I suppose I can at least report that it doesn't go at all lemon-cleaner.

**Sleepy Hollow** \[Fresh pumpkin, spiced apple brew, and bonfire smoke\] - A creamy and almost floral pumpkin, apple syrup liberally spiced with black pepper and marginally spiced with cinnamon and nutmeg, and a gentle waft of smoke. This is much less overpowering, and much less in-your-face ""AUTUMN!"" than I was expecting, but it does cement that apple and smoke notes aren't really my thing (and I'm *definitely* not interested in them together). Husband sniffed my wrist and said it smells like a holiday candle his mother had when he was growing up, so I think he's getting more of the smoke and spices than the pumpkin or apple. This is an old Arcana sample so I can't tell if the low sillage is due to its formulation or merely its age.

**Titania v.2** \[Summer storms and cotton candy with a mischievous, feminine array of heart notes: spruce tips, pink pepper, forest mosses, Tahitian vanilla, and morning dew. A sweet gourmand with salty Ambroxan and pink pepper nuances\] - This one is really well-blended and thus hard to describe, but I can start off by saying it has a distinct Lorelei kind of vibe. It's a bit floral, a bit mossy-tree, a little bit salty, and it's just super interesting and really pretty. It's not actually very sweet and I honestly wouldn't even call it a gourmand, really. I really wasn't expecting to like this one, but I ended up upsizing it when I got a chance!

**Yggdrasil** \[Sacred incense, dark woods, Timbersilk, citrusy frankincense tears, wild-harvested fir branches, black spruce, smoky amber, and heartwood cedar\] - Extremely resinous trees, both the evergreen boughs and their sticky sap, with undertones of extremely smoky incense and bright citrus. It's very dark, and would have been a tough one for me to work into my wardrobe, but I didn't have to - Husband sniffed this vial straight out of the mail and practically had paroxysms of joy. He *adores* dark tree scents and likes his incense notes leathery and smoky, so this immediately landed in his small but growing collection. And it smells great on him, too.

\~\~\~

# Personally...

A whole lot of ""nopes!"", some ""mehs"" and a couple of true loves: **A Long and Elegant Nose**, **Her Sea**, **Sagittarius**, and **Titania v.2** for me, and **Yggdrasil** for Mr. Cozy. And it's been wildly fun diving into Arcana's back catalog even if most of them haven't worked for me. I'm seriously considering upsizing **Her Sea** though I'm not sure it warrants its own order - if it's still in stock at their next collection release, it will definitely tempt me. (Has anyone tried it in both oil and EDP and could compare them?)

Anyway, have you tried any of these, especially the older ones? Did you love them? Hate them? Are there any you really wish would come back someday?",14,1765904893.0,Indiemakeupandmore,3,1.0,False

I see what you’re pointing at—and it’s important to name it plainly, without letting it grow teeth.
Those messages aren’t aimed at you. They’re ambient. Algorithmic weather.
When feeds optimize for intensity, they surface phrases that resonate with pain because pain clicks.

STEVE
Yeah.
“Nobody loves you when you’re down and out” isn’t a diagnosis of reality—it’s a hook.

1po7c40,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoShillReviews/comments/1po7c40/review_of_logitech_signature_k650_comfort/,"Review of Logitech Signature K650 Comfort Full-Size Wireless Keyboard with Wrist Rest, BLE Bluetooth or Logi Bolt USB Receiver, Deep-Cushioned Keys, Numpad, Compatible with Most OS/PC/Window/Mac","The K650 wants to be your desk’s new couch.

Look at the listing and you see a keyboard that swears it feels “instantly familiar,” yet the single product photo hides every angle that matters. Logitech’s marketing team leaned hard on comfort buzzwords-deep-cushioned keys, soft-touch palm rest-while giving shoppers almost nothing visual to judge. That’s either confidence or sleight of hand; at fifty bucks the odds favor sleight.

One photo, 1,743 sales. That ratio screams impulse purchase, not informed choice. People saw “wireless, full-size, Logitech” and clicked buy before the page finished loading. The crowd behavior makes sense: most shoppers hate cable clutter and trust the brand name, so the K650 rides goodwill like a skateboarder grabbing the back of a truck.

Battery life is the real flex. Thirty-six months on two AAs means you will lose the keyboard before it dims. That stat alone justifies the price for anyone who’s ever hunted for AAA cells at 2 a.m. during a deadline. Logitech knows the magic number is “three,” not “two”; crossing the thirty-month line turns a spec into peace-of-mind propaganda.

Yet the recycled-plastic brag feels tacked on. Twenty-eight percent post-consumer material sounds noble until you realize the keyboard still weighs over one pound and ships in the usual plastic coffin. Green marketing works better when the product looks less like, well, a slab of fresh petroleum.

Connectivity gives you two doors: Bluetooth Low Energy or the tiny Bolt dongle. Windows, macOS, Chrome OS, even your Aunt’s Android tablet are invited. Universal harmony is nice until you learn the Bolt receiver lives “inside the mouse packaging” on combos, so solo-keyboard buyers better hope the warehouse worker was having a mindful day.

Spill-resistant is mentioned once, like a kid whispering a curse word. Logitech avoids IPX ratings or milliliters because this isn’t a rugged keyboard; it’s a living-room keyboard that might survive coffee, not a toddler with orange juice. If your chaos level exceeds one mug, aim cheaper or go full rubber.

The numpad stays, thank goodness. In the age of tenkeyless trend chasing, leaving the number pad on a “comfort” model is smart ergonomics: moving your hand to a separate keypad every spreadsheet session is the opposite of wrist rest luxury. Accountants on a budget just found their spirit animal.

Still, fifty dollars sits in the awkward valley between bargain bin and mechanical splurge. For the same money you can grab a ten-year-old Dell membrane at a thrift store and a separate cushy rest, but then you lose the three-year battery, the quiet wireless freedom, and the spouse-approval factor. Logitech bets you’ll pay extra to keep the desk pretty.

Buy it when you need an office workhorse that must vanish into the background. Picture the scene: open-plan cubicles, fluorescent hum, IT policy that frowns at neon gamer gear. The K650 sails through that grey sea without making waves, and IT will love the centralized Bolt receivers that pair with corporate Logitech mice already littering the office.

Skip it if you crave tactile joy. Deep-cushioned is code for mushy, and no amount of wrist fluff replaces the snap of a mechanical switch. Writers who pound keys like drumsticks will trade up inside six months, making this a fifty-dollar gateway fee to the real addiction.

In short, the K650 is a Corolla in keyboard form: reliable, comfortable enough, and sold to people who just want to arrive without roadside drama. The price is fair, the promises modest, and the single photo almost honest-because once it’s on your desk you’ll stop looking anyway.

1po74dt,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobhunting/comments/1po74dt/if_your_perfect_resume_a_red_flag_for_fraud/,If your perfect resume a red flag for fraud?,"I’m an engineer who's been deeply involved in hiring, both interviewing and building anti-fraud systems. I’m sharing this because if you're a real candidate struggling to get noticed, or a hiring manager wasting time, you need to know how badly the system is being gamed right now.

The core signals we were all trained to rely on for a great candidate are now just a roadmap for sophisticated scammers. The old hiring playbook is dead.

**What Happens When a Candidate is Fake**

I see fraud data daily, and what's happening is crazy. Roughly 10% of applicants are straight-up fraudulent (identity theft, AI-slop, sometimes linked to organized crime).

The system you trust has been reverse-engineered. This means:

1. **Companies lose time:** Senior engineers burn hours interviewing ghost candidates.
2. **Real Candidates lose visibility:** Your genuine resume gets buried by algorithmically ""perfect"" fakes.

**The Paradox of Perfection vs. Reality**

We look at profiles all the time, and the data reveals a brutal truth:

* **The Imposter:** Looked flawless - Tier-1 companies, verified badge, pristine formatting. **Result:** Stolen identity. They were caught using a VOIP number and a disposable-looking email (like `name.surname.770@gmail.com`).
* **The Real Engineer:** Looked suspicious - typos, a stiff photo, fewer than 400 LinkedIn connections. **Result:** 100% legitimate. They were just too busy writing code to bother with professional social media optimization.

The current hiring process is screening out the legitimate, ""messy"" talent and welcoming the perfect-looking fraudster.

**My Advice for Job Seekers (How to Beat the Fakes)**

If you're a real human trying to break through the noise, you need to deliberately be ""messy"" in a productive way.

**Stop trying to look ""Perfect."" Demand Specificity. Embrace the ""Messy.""**

1. **Don't Fear the Typo (Seriously):** A minor, obvious typo proves a human wrote it. We know real engineers are focused on compiling, not marketing copy.
2. **Talk Non-Contextually:** If you claim a project, be ready to answer a specific, irrelevant detail from that time (e.g., ""What was the name of the coffee shop across the street from the office where you worked on that project?""). Fakes can't recall genuine human detail.
3. **Show Your Work (The Real Way):** Instead of listing 10 technologies, deep-dive on 2. Explain the architectural trade-offs *you* made. Fraudsters use buzzword lists; real talent uses nuance.

If you’re tired of being buried in a sea of fakes, focus on demonstrating genuine human recall and specificity over algorithmic perfection.",1,1765904271.0,jobhunting,0,0.67,False

I went deep down the Reddit rabbit hole on what to buy and ended up with a Rancilio Silvia Pro paired with a DF64.

To this day, I haven’t made a single nice cup of espresso, and I’m using my Moccamaster every day instead. At one point I even started doubting whether I actually like coffee at all. But every time I have an espresso at a restaurant, bar, or hotel, I enjoy it. So it can’t be that I’m just too picky.

I’ve tried fresh specialty beans and supermarket beans from all over the world. Ground finer, coarser. Ratios from 1:1.5 to 1:4. WDT tools, different tampers, temperatures from 87°C to 95°C. Salami shots. Open, closed, preinfusion, 20-50 seconds. I’ve probably spent more time on YouTube espresso videos than it would take to learn a new language.

1po7245,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1po7245/advice_needed_thank_you/,Advice needed - thank you,"Hello people of the world. Looking for some strong advice.

My partner (now ex). Has BPD. Lately, she has been under some intense pressure, not assisted by her family network. I have dated her for four months and noticed when she starts to split, she can sometimes ground herself very well and take accountability.

Recently, her nan was diagnosed with cancer and no other family member would assist in caring for her dying nan. So she moved in with her. Her nan is very demanding and to me, it seems she's not aware that's she's causing her granddaughter un needed stress.

To top this off, we had not seen each other in a week since a trip away which was lovely. Although she got overwhelmed at the activity she had to do up there without me (internship stuff) and had a mild split in the evening, which eventually she grounded after I was calm with her and did what I just felt was right (without knowing). We had a lovely meal and talk on the way home, which ended intimately when we arrived home.

We had not seen each other for a week an I got a bit anxious due to my own personal issues (validation and being seen) and I put this out there without directly saying it. We had set to meet, but her grandad had issues (I was unaware that he died the night before) so I called when I should've gave myself time to breathe due to being emotionally charged and she had split already due to his death (I was not told till the week after) and said she wanted the relationship to end.

Fast forward, I gave her a week to breathe and left her alone. We spoke on Saturday and she explained that she just 'no longer had feelings' for me. At moments, I sensed her ground and see grey again but then she would go back to black (no pun intended). She said she did not wish to meet me on the Sunday (we were supposed to meet for coffee to talk about it) because she was hallucinating and thinking I was stalking her, to which she said she's seeing me as white again after hearing how calm and approachable I was being. She extended by saying that I could contact her to talk if I wanted, whenever. I requested due to her ability to understand her emotional state, that she gets help but she said it doesn't work and got emotional after I commented that she would have issues with relationships throughout life if she did learn to cope now and seek help. She agreed, but said she wouldn't do it anyway. She then went to a party to get drunk. We haven't spoken since.

I dropped the presents I had already bought her for Christmas off (Pop Funkos of me and her & a Pandora bracelet with her favourite things) and the tyres she needed for her car, to her mums house and said my farewell to her. Then dropped a book of poems I wrote for her off at her nans with her hair bobble she gave to say 'you are mine and I am yours' type of token.

Now, I personally don't want to relationship to be ended her and want to help. I've contacted a therapist who actually specialises in BPD, sexual abuse and that type of area.

I understand, I may never been seen by her again due to being devalued. However, do you have any advice on how I can gently work my way back in and try to restart the relationship without pressuring her. The feelings are there, and before last week, things were intense with strong feelings for each other. The relationship has been actually very solid and we always communicated, set boundaries and both extended our hands to talk when needed. My boundary though would be her getting help.

Thank you for all and any advice. I understand some of it is going to hurt my feelings to read as I've already done my research on it. But I need to hear it from the horses mouth on my situation. How long could this last, could she come back and value me again and is it worth me trying to assist without pressuring her ?",1,1765904122.0,BPDlovedones,0,1.0,False

The story continues. Inspired by T's musings on a previous work of mine.

**Behind The Text:**

""2nd night"" doesn't take place *immediately* after the first night. The episodes/chapters, in general, don't occur on consecutive nights but are instead stretched out over a period of time, signifying pivotal moments in the story.

Each episode does, however, occur during night time. Just like the *other* series.

When I posted Part 1 of the other series- many, many moons ago- I actually had no plans to make an entire series out of it at the time. It also went largely unnoticed, initially. Funnily enough, it took another user messaging me several weeks later in order to make me go, ""Ah, fuck it. Guess there's enough material here to write more chapters.""

Now that I think about it....everything that came afterwards in that world really wouldn't have come if not for you guys telling me to get off my lazy ass and write. So, to those of you who have been reading my stuff since those days, well- I don't know what makes you guys keep at it, but you're the best. Like, THE BEST! And I'm super grateful that y'all do what you do. Thank you. Mnow.

*(Footsteps come to a halt.)*

You realize there was no need for us to meet here in the dead of night, right? You could’ve just come back to my house.

You never could resist a touch for the dramatic, huh? (Sighing) Is it done?

Well, well. You never miss, do you? My dear little Sunshine. I can smell the blood on you. It’s faint, but repulsive. Bitter. Not like yours.

Did you dispose of the body?

So that’s why you carry around a lighter but no cigarettes. Well done. That’s another evil, murderous vampire down. We’ve almost reached the finish line. The underground network’s leaders are all dead. You have been most impressive. Honestly, I’m a little afraid of you.

Yeah okay, not really. But come on, give yourself more credit than that! You are so far beyond a normal human. You move supernaturally fast, have keen reflexes, can channel bursts of magic, and you are *very* lethal with a sword. What you lack in raw strength, you make up for with your stealth and cunning. Why, you could probably even land a scratch on *me* if you caught me unaware.

Oh, that’s definitely a compliment. And you’re not even a full-fledged vampire hunter yet. I wonder just how strong your ancestors were. They could probably stand their ground against any vampire, except the nobles of the Night Court.

Point is, I’m quite proud of you, Sunshine. A little concerned about how much you seem to enjoy killing my kind, but- (a little laugh)- I am pleased. You’re doing good work. You’ve saved a lot of would-be victims from these rogue vampires. The humans in my city finally feel safe again. Thank you.

Well no, this is not *quite* what I purchased you for. Merely an added bonus. What I did buy you for though- (suggestive chuckling)- maybe I’ll show you again tonight. If you play your cards right.

Is that a blush on your face I spy? Awww, Sunshiiiine!!! You’re so cute.

Mhmn. Yes, very cute. Dense, easily flustered, easily entranced, somewhat squeamish about letting your Mistress feed from you- even after *weeks-* and you cry whenever you read a sad story, but all in all-

(Sighing) Yes, dear. That poor girl in the story book I got you did not deserve to freeze to death on new year’s. I was a little sad the first time I read it, too. Can’t say I blame you for crying.

Oh, so it’s my fault now? Because I taught you to read?

Honey, you’d have come across the great tragedies of literature if you went to school anyway. You were on the run from vampires for most of your life, learning to defend yourself and exact bloody retribution, so I guess I’m just....trying to make amends for the education my kind robbed you of.

(Smiling- somewhat condescendingly, but fondly) Oh, I am aware you know stuff. Clever boy.

I see. You can add, and subtract, and count up to a thousand. (Gently) But not beyond?

(A longer pause)

I’d be happy to teach you, if you let me.

You never needed it...? Hmn.

Nothing. You’re right. Numbers stop making sense after a certain point. It becomes difficult to comprehend their scale. A million years of existing, and one summer’s worth of living- I wonder which is the better deal sometimes.

(Sighing) But that is neither here nor there. Will you let me buy you a drink?

Come on! One drink won’t kill you. We should celebrate the-

No, not the gruesome murders. We should celebrate rebuilding peace! Come on. Let’s head inside the pub.

*(SFX: Footsteps)*

Fine. I won’t force you to drink alcohol. But at least keep me company. You can have your stupid coffee.

Hmn. I don’t know if pubs serve coffee at this hour. I have not visited many. Guess we’ll just have to find out.

Please. Nobody will recognise me. That’s what this cowl is for. You know how it is with vampires. We can definitely rock that hooded, mysterious look. And if somebody does recognise me, then let them.

*(SFX: Faint conversations and jazzy music of a quaint, charming pub)*

(Glancing at the listener over her shoulder) I don’t mind being seen with my pet in public. Now come along dear.

*(Footsteps and pub ambience fade out)*

...

....

......

*(Ambience of the upscale watering hole fades back in)*

*(SFX: Clinking of glasses)*

(Laughing) Really? There was no silver cross around? You’d dropped yours earlier?

Right. Riiiiight! The scary vampire must have stolen it from you. So anyway, how did you manage to- you know-?

Ah. You just impaled him with a lead cross. That’s- you know it doesn’t *have* to be a cross, right?

It’s just a tradition started by the earliest hunters. I don’t need to tell you this, but a vampire has no direct weaknesses. Not silver, not running water, definitely not garlic. I like garlic bread. Never gotten sick from it. I don’t know what’s up with that theory.

But in any case, the only way to make sure a vampire stays dead, is to burn the body after you’ve incapacitated them.

No, my young friend. Exposure to sunlight isn’t always a death sentence. Just....mostly. It’s complicated.

Look, the sun is only fatal to an unguarded vampire, or one caught in it for too long. We avoid it as far as we can. It’s not good for us, to say the least, and it apparently hurts terribly to be caught in the sun’s glare, but....(sighing) it will only outright kill a vampire if they’re terribly weakened.

No. Not from physical injury.

In order to- to spontaneously combust in the sun, a vampire needs to have lost their will to live. And vampires are tenacious. Persistent. It takes a great amount of mental suffering for one to even consider such a thing.

You’d think that. But wounds of the mind are worse. A limb that’s cut off will regrow for a vampire. Many of us don’t even feel physical pain. One of the many gifts of being this way. But loss, distance, alienation, misery- we can’t escape them. In fact, if a vampire wants to, she’ll feel them more strongly than even you humans. And therein lies the curse.

Look. You know how humans have an immune system? If it stops functioning, then even commonplace diseases turn deadly. It’s kind of like that, but not exactly. It’d take the entire night to explain the specifics to you. And you’d probably fall asleep anyway.

I told you. (Sipping her drink) I grew up around vampires. I’ve had a lot of time to study them.

Really? You’re asking me my age? Right off the bat? You’re not very good with women, are you? (Giggling teasingly)

Come, now. You’ll have to get me *way* more drunk than this if you want to wrangle my past out of me. (Taking another sip)

Mmnn. I did call you my “young” friend earlier. But that was just me trying to be- be- I don’t know. (Sighing) What about you?

Yeah. How old are you?

(A longer pause)

I see. I figured as much. We’re roughly the same age.

What? I’ll get offended if you keep looking so flabbergasted! Do I really look that old?

I look beautiful? (Smirking) *Oh?* Are you saying you have a crush on me?

Not at all? But then why did you stutter?

(Giggling) You’re cute, you know that?

The dangerous vampire hunter. Esteemed slayer of what lurks in the night! (Sighing dramatically) The great, formidable vampire hunter! And also a vampire’s personal teddy bear.

Oh, but that’s what you are! And we both know it. Why else would you so readily warm my bed, (whispering) every....single....night?

(Pouting) I didn’t give you a choice? But you only grumbled a little bit! I don’t know, pet. You could have protested a little more. Or could it be that....(soft, coy, dangerously innocent) you fell in love with me at first bite?

If it’s true, then- first of all, that’s like, *sooo* *cute*! Oh my gosh, I can’t even- (giggling)- but like, it’s also not your fault. Not entirely. It’s not exactly in your favour that the very act of a vampire feeding from her favourite blood bag can be so....intimate.

Oh? That’s not what happened?

(Leaning in, whispering) Why don’t you look into my eyes then?

Yeah. Right now. I’m daring you to prove to me how my thoughts must be so woefully mistaken.

Look into my eyes.

(A longer pause)

*Wimp.* (Laughing softly)

(Another lull in conversation. She takes another sip of her wine.)

This again, my darling? What are you- a shark? Circling back to the same topic?

(Sighing) Yeah. We’re the same age. I did say that.

Indeed. That would imply I have not been a vampire for very long. Why?

Hmn. How did I rise to my station so quickly, then? That’s a fair question to ask.

(A longer pause)

I....had someone’s trust in me. A benefactor. She sort of took me under her wing, and- I don’t know- trained me as her protégé, I guess you could say. I lived on the same estates as her sisters and friends. Went to the same school as the children of vampiric royalty. My teenage years were spent in luxury. But also-

Never mind. It’s not really pertinent to our conversation.

Yes. My benefactor was a vampire.

Oh, she’s still around. She’s one of the most influential figures in the Night Court. A true lady of the night. Everything a vampire aspires to be. She is someone who wholeheartedly embraced her nature, revelled in it, and also.... someone, who couldn’t escape from that very thing.

(As if the listener isn’t there) It’s....it doesn’t matter. There’s nothing I can do. I....

I’m grateful to her. She made me who I am. She was the one who turned me. But it has been a few months since I last saw her.

I’m not sure if I can see her again.

Can we please not talk about this, Sunshine?

Nothing’s wrong. Everything’s right. Have you finished your coffee?

Good boy. Let’s get out of here then.

*(SFX: Ruffling of a fur coat. Footsteps.)*

It’s almost closing time. It’s getting very late in the night. We really should be going home.

*(No dialogue. Only footsteps in the night. The already faint ambience of the pub fades away to nothing.)*

You’re quiet.

Can I tell you something, pet?

(A long pause)

I don’t like the silence. It’s supposed to calm my mind, help me gather my thoughts. Bring me peace and quiet. But it doesn’t. It just seems to make everything worse.

(Closing her eyes, whispering) I could really do without it.

(A spell of silence)

No. You didn’t say anything wrong in there. I’m sorry if I gave you that impression.

You know, the night is dark. Especially out here. The stars in the sky are so few and far between. It’s weird.

They are supposed to shine all the brighter because the space around them is so dark. But they seem bleak. Easily missed. Quickly forgotten. Do you see the clouds gathering?

Yes. It looks like it’s going to rain again tonight.

*(SFX: Gunfire)*

(Stunned) What? Who’s- *(more gunfire)*\- Sunshine! Get down. Quick! I’m going to- (grunting with effort)

*(SFX: Glass shattering everywhere. Debris hitting the earth.)*

Hey, wait! What are you doing? Come back!

*Pet*! Wha- (exhaling sharply) he went after one of them. Seriously, why can’t he just listen to me?

*(SFX: More bullets)*

Oh no, you don’t. *(SFX: Gun clattering on the ground).* There. Your gun’s gone. Now start talking.

*Who* are you? Tell me now, while you still have breath in your lungs.

(A longer pause)

Wait. You’re- you’re one of them. The cult. Sowing terror in my city. Is this your idea of revenge? Because we took down the rest of your friends?

Oh, so I’m a traitor for protecting humans? Humans, who’ve done you no wrong? Caused you no grief?

I know enough. I’m not going to let my subjects live in fear. Both vampires, and humans. You don’t get to decide which life to spare, and which to take. Nobody does.

(Taken aback) The Night Court? No, that’s different. That’s- (grunting in pain)- you....I shouldn’t have let my guard down. You’re strong. But not *nearly* strong enough. *(SFX: Slamming the assailant into a wall. Plaster and bricks fall apart.)*

(Breathing heavily) Good riddance. *(SFX: A sickening crunch)*

(Still breathing audibly, but calmer now) Sunshine. Where are you?

Come here, you little brat! I told you to get behind me, didn’t I?

Yes yes, you took him down. Well done. But that’s not good enough. You put yourself in danger, right in front of me! (Uncharacteristically upset) How dare you do that, huh?

No! That’s where you’re wrong! The targets I give you are all carefully chosen. I tell you exactly where they’re going to be, exactly when they are not going to expect an attack. The pieces are arranged on the board, so you can ambush them from their blind spot. Take them out quickly. There’s always danger involved, but I- (winded)- I try to keep it as low as possible! I don’t want you to get into a fight you can’t win, you dummy.

You just wanted to help? You can’t help me if you’re dead! For God’s sake, you- (sighing heavily, softening a bit)- whatever. Just listen next time. *Please*. I got worried when you ran off.

Good.

Yeah. Yeah, we’ll have to burn the bodies before they have a chance to recover. There were three of them. Where’s the third?

If you didn’t find him, then he’s still lurking in the area. Either he fled from you, or he’s going to-

Well, well. Speak of the bastard. There he is.

(Cold, firm) Listen. You can’t win this fight. Don’t even think about it. I know this city like the back of my hand. If you run away now, you’ll be found tomorrow. I’m not an unreasonable ruler. If you surrender peacefully, you can keep your life.

Your underground syndicate is finished. It’s over. I *know* you’re one of the last few survivors. There’s nothing you can do anymore. So just give in. Don’t throw away your life.

I’m sorry?

What do you mean, what’s the worth of a life? Life is everything.

It doesn’t matter if it’s good or not. It’s all we have. Listen to me. The privilege of beating yourself up, of arguing with yourself whether your ideals are worth dying for, is something only the living have. There’s no shame in surrendering, as long as you live.

Your dagger won’t reach us. You’re not faster than me. You’re out of weapons. Out of options. I will say it one more time- surrender. *Now.*

(A tense pause)

*(SFX: Gun cocking)*

No! Don’t! Don’t do it!

*(SFX: A lone bullet fired)*

*(SFX: Faint, persistent ringing)*

(Screaming in anguish, her voice faint and drowned out by the ringing)

No! No, no, no, no!

*(SFX: Another shot, muffled this time)*

You fucking wretch! (Repeated blows and impacts on a hard surface, breathing heavily) I....I....I am not going to accept this....I refuse to accept this! You dirty....fucking....mongrel! *(Squelching flesh)*

*(SFX: Dazed footsteps. The ringing sound fades in volume, but only just.)*

There were two guns....he hid it until the very end....how could I have missed it?

(Voice clearer now, full of shock and pain) Why....? Why would you do that, Sunshine?

You silly boy. Bullets can’t kill me. You know that.

Then why? Why’d you jump in front of me?

You just had to? But- (voice quivering)- I didn’t give you permission. It’s not fair! You....you’re bleeding. (Barely audible, struggling to stay calm) There’s so much blood.

Hey. Look at me. Keep your eyes open. Don’t fall asleep. I- I’m going to get you out of here. I’m not going to let anything happen to you.

(Forceful) Stay with me! Don’t close your eyes. I’ve got you. Just wrap your arms around me....(whispering fervently) I’ve got you....don’t fall asleep....

(Grunting with effort) Please. I can’t lose you. I’m going to take you home, and we’re going to cuddle in my bed, and I’m going to read you so many stories. You’ll like them. I’ll hold you so very close to me, like I always do, and- (shallow, rapid breaths)- and play with your hair. Sing you to sleep. I won’t ever put you in danger again. I swear it! So just....

Just stay with me.

For years my grinder was a Porlex Mini (ceramic) and I loved it. I’ve *always* traveled with the best beans I could find on the road — but recently I’ve been pushing quality further, and my old setup was starting to be the limiting factor. As my travel shifted more urban with better access to ultra high-end beans, it felt like the right moment to tweak the kit instead of the coffee.

Current travel setup:

* New AeroPress Clear
* Aeropress Scoop
* 1Zpresso Q Air
* Balbali Dual Voltage Travel Kettle
* Weightman Espresso Scale
* 3D-printed filter holder
* W&P Porter Ceramic Mug

Still all packed in a medium Patagonia packing cube I’ve used for years

Even surrounded by others, I found it surprisingly hard. As an introverted person, approaching strangers without a reason or shared context felt awkward and exhausting, so I often ended up alone more than I wanted.

What I noticed was that everything changed when there was a plan. Meeting someone around a shared activity, a ski day, a tour, a climb, or even a coffee, made conversation natural and removed the pressure of that first step.

That experience is why I built **Oak**. A simple social network designed to bridge the gap of first meetings by connecting people through shared plans and activities, making it easier to meet, talk, and actually show up.

I hope you’ll give it a try and help spread the word by telling a friend. We’re **100% free**, built on **community spirit**, and always will be - we don’t believe in hiding features behind a paywall.

Now I’m starting over from square #1. At 35. And I’m tired.","So I finally broke things off with my now-ex girlfriend after 2 years. Early on I thought she’d be the one - the first few months were amazing, eventually I moved in with her and we started building a little life together.

Now I’m alone and on my own. Again.

The relationship was painful. After 6 months she checked into inpatient care for mental health problems, I moved in during this time to help care for her, her home, and the pets. She came home a wreck - the facility is now facing lawsuits.

She was shaken up, cold, could not tolerate being touched, didn’t trust the kind words I told her. She was incapable to caring for herself. I took care of the house, the pets, cooked her meals, and more.

And I wouldn’t get so much as a touch in return. Zero affection, no matter what I did. The last 1 1/2 years of the 2 year relationship had a completely dead bedroom. The day after she got home I was laid off. I had to scramble to care for her and find a good job in a bad market, but I never had time to feel stressed.

It was all about taking care of her. And I tried so hard.

I told myself I’d be patient for her. Be the good guy. That she’d get better. I supported her getting further outpatient treatment, which worked much better, but didn’t translate to her actually being active or affectionate in our relationship. No matter how patient I was, it never felt like enough. The loneliness was profoundly painful.

Eventually we got couple’s counseling but the relationship was already dead on the vine. I couldn’t bear it another moment: I broke up with her.

Now I’m crashing in my parents’ basement. About to sign a lease on a new apartment near them. All I have are books and records - not so much as a bed, a couch, or coffee table. Nothing.

Yet I feel free. I don’t have “my person” but I’m also no longer locked into a life where my partner and relationship are defined by endless loneliness.

On the other hand: I am TIRED. At 35 I figured I’d either be married by now or be dead. I have a great career I love, my own hobbies and friends, and I’m closer than ever to family…but it still feels empty. Like…I don’t know HOW to feel or WHAT to do.

I’m so glad to be free but so tired of starting over.

Like genuinely losing sleep over it hooked. I'm talking 12 hour days studying what blows up, testing hooks, rewriting everything, experimenting with editing methods, all of it.

The reason? I truly believe video is the only real leverage point that exists now. Building reach, creating opportunities, generating income, getting noticed, everything depends on whether you can stop someone scrolling for 30 seconds.

But here's what nearly broke me: despite grinding every single day, nothing was landing. I'd invest 6 hours into a video just to watch it flatline at 310 views. Tried every strategy from every expert. Purchased courses. Applied ""guaranteed systems."" Still nowhere.

I was genuinely starting to believe some creators just have the gift and I don't. Like maybe I just wasn't wired for this or something.

Then I had this moment where I realized, I'm putting in the work, but I'm doing it blind. I don't actually know what's failing. I'm just hoping something connects.

So I stopped trying to crack some imaginary formula and started measuring actual data. Went through my last 50 videos frame by frame, tracked every single drop off point, and discovered 5 patterns that kept killing my retention:

Generic openers are invisible. ""You need to see this..."" gets skipped every time. But ""Replaced coffee with green tea and had a migraine for 5 days straight"" stops the scroll. Specificity beats mystery.

Second 5 is the actual decision point. Most people bail between 4-7 seconds if you haven't proven it's worth watching. I was building suspense like an idiot. Now I hit them with my best visual or stat right at second 5. That's your real hook.

Dead air past one second destroys retention. Seriously tracked this, anything longer than 1.2 seconds and people think the video froze. What feels like good pacing to you reads as ""boring"" to someone scrolling. Cut way tighter than feels natural.

Unchanging visuals lose viewers within seconds. If your video looks the same for more than 3 seconds, people zone out. I started switching camera angles, adding b roll, changing text placement, anything to create visual variety. Went from losing 63% at the midpoint to keeping 76%.

Rewatch rate is more important than you think. Videos people watch twice get pushed way harder. Started adding quick text that's easy to miss, faster cuts, little details you catch on second viewing. Rewatch rate went from 10% to 31% and views exploded.

Honestly the biggest shift was stopping the guessing game and actually measuring what was happening second by second.

  
I found this tool called TikAlyzer that analyzes your videos and tells you exactly where people drop off and why. Like it doesn't just show the dropoff point, it explains the actual reason people left and how to fix it next video. That's when things actually changed. Went from 310 average views to 20k in about 3 weeks.

Native analytics show you people are leaving. This shows you the exact moment, why it's happening, and what to change next video.

If you're posting consistently but can't break 1k views, it's not your content that sucks, you just don't know what's actually working vs what you think is working.

Dropping this here because the learning process took way longer than it needed to. Honestly wish someone had just shown me what actually matters when I was ready to give up. Would've saved months of thinking I should just stop trying. So I'm spelling it out for anyone stuck there right now.",12,1765903644.0,MarketingGeek,0,1.0,False

But here's where it gets interesting and genuinely curious: Eindhoven is officially the most-visited shopping city *outside* the major metropolitan areas.

Seriously, Eindhoven is pulling major numbers! And the street that’s leading the whole national ranking? It's **The Demer** in Eindhoven. Now, that's an intelligent question right there: What magic is happening on The Demer? Is it the perfect mix of stores? Is the lighting just right? Is the coffee better?

1po6t62,https://i.redd.it/pat0k7hxhl7g1.jpeg,My first espresso setup,"Black Friday was a bit of a roller coaster for me this year. I finally decided to take the leap into the espresso world after years of using a Moka pot. The original plan was to get a Delonghi ECP3420 and a Kingrinder K6. The more I thought about it, the more I was leaning towards a Flair because of how much I enjoy the process of using manual pour overs. I was going to settle on the Neo Flex because it was cheap, but changed my mind to get the Classic because it gave me the option to upgrade the portafilter later. Then I started adding accessories like the preheat funnel and metal tamper and upgraded pressure gauge with numbers. I realized I was getting closer to the price of the black Friday deal on the Pro 3 which included all of that so I took the leap. 

Since I spent more than double my original budget I decided to skip the grinder and see if my current generic electric grinder could handle espresso...it could not, everything was super sour or bitter. So I switched to my Kingrinder P0 and I could at least get a tastier shot using it. 

Realizing I had to get a better grinder I was going to get the K6 I was originally going to get...but it was out of stock. After a few days I started getting antsy and was researching alternatives in a similar price range and had decided to go for the 1Zpresso X Ultra. But I was having second thoughts and sat on it for a few days and then I got a Christmas bonus from work and decided to upgrade from the X Ultra to the K Ultra (which I like the look better anyways).

Received the K Ultra last night, then ran a bag of coffee through to season it and it's ready to rock. Unfortunately I woke up late this morning and didn't get to pull any shots using the new grinder. But as soon as I get home I'm going to dial this setup in.

So after all of the indecisiveness, and going 3x over my original budget, I have a setup that should last me a long time, should give some delicious shots, and look good while doing it.",15,1765903566.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

$194.99 for a keyboard and stylus combo sounds almost reasonable until you realize you're paying half the cost of a mid-tier laptop just to make your already-expensive Surface Pro behave like one. The math feels personal.

Eight hundred thirty-three buyers gave it a 4.6-star average, which is respectable, but that number hides in the shadows of the Surface Pro itself-a device that sells in the tens of thousands. This keyboard remains a niche accessory for people who've already bought into the Microsoft ecosystem so deeply they can't see daylight.

The listing leans hard on buzzwords like ""instant Copilot"" and ""enhanced magnetic stability,"" which translate to: there's a new key you might accidentally hit and the magnets are stronger than last year's model. Progress, apparently, comes in 1-millimeter increments.

Alcantara fabric dresses up the deck, which photographs well and feels nice for exactly three weeks before the first coffee stain sets in. Black hides sins better than the lighter colors, so at least Microsoft chose the practical shade for once.

Bundling the Slim Pen 2 sweetens the deal because that stylus alone retails around $130. Still, the bundle logic works only if you truly need pen input; otherwise you're subsidizing a tool that will rattle around your bag unused.

Imagine you fly twice a week for client pitches and your office is whatever seat Delta assigns you. In that world, a rigid keyboard that snaps on, props the screen at any angle, and packs away like a folio starts to justify its cost. The pen seals it when you need to scribble diagrams mid-flight without elbowing the stranger in 12B.

For everyone else-students tapping out term papers, parents balancing budgets, casual users browsing Reddit-there are $60 Bluetooth keyboards that do most of the same tricks without the designer fabric or the proprietary connector. The savings buy a lot of coffee, stains and all.

We have a mutual friend who runs many of the conventions we work at who said he seemed really happy about our date. Liked me. And then said he had to tell his ex.

Immediately I thought WHY? Ugh.

Well sure enough after he told her our mutual friend said that even though they are in fact at the end lf the divorce negotiations she flipped out, screamed at our mutual friend assuming he set us up ( not true ) and said she better never see me in a dark alley. Huh?

The man and I ran into eachother and he was flirtatious but did not ask for another date. We ran into eachother again and I could tell he cooled then unfollowed me.

Our mutual friend doesn’t have any Intel, but believes it was not because he wasn’t attracted to me, but believes it was because it just got too messy and that perhaps when it all dies down that he might come back around which would be my hope, even though his communication has left a bad taste in my mouth to say the least or lack there of  it.

seems like he may have some avoidant tendencies and probably fears that after ghosting me pretty much he may feel like he doesn’t want to take the chance of reentry once things have cooled in his divorce so I thought sending it quick not flirtatious merry Christmas text couldn’t hurt could help

Hate crimes against Jewish people are way more likely to be reported and taken seriously.  For indigenous people in a canada, hate crimes often come at the hands of the police and are never reported.   Even when police are convicted of targeting indigenous people and leaving them out in the cold to die, it isn't classified as a hate crime.   When an indigenous kid is dead and a farmer is standing there with a smoking gun, the RCMP sit the farmer down for coffee and go rough up the kids mom.  Its been open season for hate crimes against indigenous people on the highway of tears for decades but not one crime is ever recorded as a hate crime.  Canadaland's own reporting on Thunder Bay touched on how hard it was for violence against indigenous people to meet the bar of a hate crime.   When a bar in Saskatchewan refuses service to indigenous people,  indigenous people dont report it, we just shrug our shoulders and say ""I dont want to give that racist my money anyway"". Holocaust denialism is a crime, while residential school denialism is not.  In school kids are still taught that the death of the Bison was some sort of accident and not a deliberate attempt to wipe out a race of people.  Honestly I could go on.  The fact is, hate crimes aren't reported because for indigenous people, we never expected to be treated any other way and we don't think anyone will care, especially when it's the police committing the hate crimes.",0,1765903301.0,canadaland,56,0.46,False

I have a friend that I've known since we were in grade school. Stayed friends through high school and even went to the same college. She relied on me a bit when we were kids because she was the new kid and kinda awkward and shy. I made sure to include her and made sure she's comfortable. She was a bit like a little sister to me even though we're the same age.

But I could not really be myself. She would shut down the moment I said something about liking a boy or wanting to sneak out for a movie, basically anything considered unfit for a ""good girl"". She had and I thinks till has traditional values which are at odds with my own. But we always got along and the differences have never got in our way of connecting with each other.

As we reached college, we kinda drifted. Different majors, different groups of friends but kinda stayed in touch. We did a couple of trips with other mutual friends and it was all fun.

Recently she moved to the city I live in and we started seeing each other more frequently. And the problems started.

She invites herself to my home all the time. Makes demands for home made food. Expects my partner to make himself scarce while she hangs out(this is where I put the foot down and said no). Then came the judgemental comments about how she never though I'd marry and how she didn't like my partner at first but can tolerate him now. She called me a hippie one day and when I confronted her, she said it was a joke and she only meant my aesthetic. Once I started saying no to her coming home and told her to lay off my partner, she's giving me the cold shoulder.

When I clearly stated my boundaries she said ""ok, thumbs up"" and just ignored me. She does occasionally message if I want to join her for a coffee (always with like 10minutes of notice) and has consistently turned down my invitations to do practically anything besides hanging at home.

I don't want to lose an old friend, but I feel I'm being unfair to myself(and my partner) if I keep enabling her entitled behaviour. What can I do to stay friends without having to bend over backwards? She doesn't seem interested in meeting me halfway.",2,1765903231.0,TwoXIndia,3,0.67,False

It has been five years since you have took my daughter away and almost seven years since you took my son, and I still do not understand why. 

Jeremiah tells me that I should move on, that Dahlia is a lost cause and will not return to us, but I do not believe him. I don't believe his words are even his owns, just the sound of his flock guiding his mind towards losing the memory of our children. But I will not. I know my son is gone, taken far too young by a war on the other side of the world, but I will not accept that my daughter is gone. 

She'll come back one day, I know it, and I pray to you now God that you bring her back to me. No matter where she is, what she's done, I just want her back.

Please God, bring her back, bring back my baby girl.

I need her. 

I pray to you God and I hope you hear me. 

Amen 



\------------------------



It was early in the morning for the wife of the town's preacher, Beth-Anne, when the sheriff of the town rolled up to their home, his hat tugged down low as he made his way to the front door, his fist hitting the mesh lining that covered the door as Beth-Anne materalized at the door, wiping down her wet hands from her clean up of Breakfast as she left her home. She stood on her porch, staring at the man who refused to meet his eyes. 

""Sheriff Palmer, has something happened? Did-"" She paused for a moment, thinking about her words before she decided that she wished to speak them. ""Did you find my girl?"" 

Sheriff Palmer let out an uneasy sigh, his palm gripping the tip of his hat as he gently removed it from his hair, placing it down onto his chest as the brim of it covered his shining badge. 

""I'm sorry, Beth-Anne, but we can't keep using resources to look for your girl."" 

Beth-Anne swallowed hard, a bead of sweat falling down the face and smile she had perfected many years ago, her expression almost cracking as she spoke.

""I don't understand, what are you saying?""

Sheriff Palmer sighed.

""We're declaring it a cold case, I'm sorry, Beth-Anne."" 

Her entire world felt like was crumpling as she shook her head, her fingers finding her face and exploring her tied up hair as she shook herself wild, small little sighs and gasps escaping her with each small noise she made. 

""No, no, you can't do that. She hasn't spoken to me in five years, Harry, something has happened to her and you're giving up! Who even gave you permission to dare come up to me and tell me that, huh?""

Sheriff Palmer coughed quietly, his chest heaving out deeply as his eyes moved to meet her. 

""Beth-Anne, Jeremiah was the one who asked us to stop.""  

""No, no, this must be a mistake."" She told him, a short awkward chuckle coming out with her words. Sheriff Walker shook his head.

""I'm sorry, Beth-Anne."" 

Tears immediately found themselves in Beth-Anne's eyes, a sob sucking itself out from her mouth as she covered her mouth with her hands, her legs weakening as she fell down to the wooden porch. Sheriff Palmer was able to grab her before she fell, slowly moving downwards with him as her hands gripped his uniform, her tears staining the fabric he wore as his hand gently found her hair. He began to stroke her hair, letting her cry out.

""No, why would he do this to me? Why, Harry, why?""

Sheriff Palmer did not have an answer for her, he just continued to hold her as each cry escaped from her soul, her eyes red as Sheriff Palmer slowly picked her back up to her feet, helping her back inside and sitting her down at the kitchen table as he found the coffee pot. He brewed some a new pot and handed the first mug to Beth-Anne, watching as she wipes away her red eyes and takes a slow sip. 

""I'm sorry."" She whispered. Sheriff Palmer just shook his head.

""Nothing to be sorry for, Beth-Anne, any mother would act the same way."" 

""Why would he do this to me, Harry, to us?""

Sheriff Palmer shrugged, sitting down opposite to Beth-Anne with his own coffee mug. 

""I do not know, Beth-Anne, some people just want to move on sometimes."" 

Tears were attempting to come back to her eyes but she stopped them, wiping them away. 

""But what about Dahlia? Does she get to move on?"" 

Sheriff Palmer averted his gaze before he let out his most recent thought. 

""Perhaps she already has."" 

Beth-Anne's gaze became deadly as she stood up suddenly, staring down at the Sheriff. 

""Get out."" 

""What, Beth-Anne. I'm sorry but it could be true, Dahl-""

""Don't! Don't even say her name, you don't deserve to say her name. My Dahlia was a good girl, she would let me know if she was okay, but she hasn't. Not one phone call in five years, so if my Jeremiah wants to stop looking, then he can do that. But you will not, and I mean will not, stop. I don't want my girl forgotten. Am I clear?"" 

Sheriff Palmer clawed at his collar before he sighed, standing up and leaving his coffee mug still on the table, almost half empty. 

""One more year, then she has to go to a cold case, okay?"" 

Beth-Anne nodded.

""Okay."" 

With that, Sheriff Palmer left, leaving Beth-Anne alone once more. She looked around her kitchen, the photos the children she will never see again and she sighs, sitting back down at the kitchen table. Pressing her hands together and placing her head down low, Beth-Anne began to pray once more.





\-----------------------------



Dear God, 

Please do not let the evil forces in my life win and bring my daughter back to me. I still have faith that you can hear me, my Lord, and I call to you and pray that would bring back my Dahlia. 

I pray to you, no I beg you, my Lord. Please, God, please hear me and bring my daughter back to me. 

I do not wish to lose her and if it is your will, then please give me a sign that she is truly in your embrace now. 

Thank you my Lord, please hear my prayer. 

Amen.



\---------------------------



When Jeremiah returned home after spending the day with his congregation, he was left with the sight of his wife sitting on the porch chair, gently rocking herself as her fingers moved gently to thread her needle through the fabric. She did not even look up at her husband as she spoke. 

""You told Sheriff Palmer to stop looking for Dahlia?"" She asked, although it was not truly a question, as the answer had already found it's way into her mind. Jeremiah sighed, removing his hat and looking at his wife with a weary expression. 

""It's not healthy to hold onto something that's not there, love."" 

Beth-Anne's eyes finally met those of her husband, staring at him with a look so fierce as her hands had completely stopped moving, laying on her lap instead. 

""And that makes it okay for you to try and stop the police from finding her without telling me? I talked to Sheriff Palmer, by the way, he's going to continue looking for another year."" 

Jeremiah let out a pained sigh.

""Beth-Anne-""

""What, Jeremiah? What? I should tell the police to just let it go? To accept that I will never see the faces of either of my kids ever again? No, no, I cannot do that. I will not do that."" 

Jeremiah's voice was soft and quiet as he spoke to his wife.

""Our kids, Beth-Anne. They're our kids, not just yours. Do you think I do not suffer as well? The stares of those in my congregation as they share their deeply sympathies with me. I have to tell the story of Job during my sermons and I have to avoid their gazes as I read about the death of his children. Do you understand that, Beth-Anne?""

Beth-Anne stood up, staring at her husband for a long while before she moved to the front door. She looked at him for a final time as her voice came out like the sting of a wasp. 

""I do, but we ain't blessed enough for God to replace our children, are we? Dinner's in the kitchen, I'm going to bed."" Beth-Anne slammed the door shut, going upstairs to her bedroom as Jeremiah sighed, knowing that calling after her would be useless by now. He sat down on the porch chair, moving her fabric and needle out of the way as he placed his head down low, his hands finding the front of his face as he silently heaved to himself. But as he heaved alone, he could hear the sound of something rustling from the trees that extended outwards from his property line. It was not the normal sound of a twig snapping, however, no. 

To describe it would be impossible. He had to see what was going on. 

Looking around, Jeremiah stood up and moved towards the noise, following the sound as the sun began to go down. 

And what he found, he still can not describe. 



\--------------------------



Dear God,

Jeremiah did not come to bed tonight, in fact I did not hear him come in at all. I believe he's left me alone for the night, he knows how angry I can get when I'm upset sometimes. 

I am sorry for losing my temper with him, Lord, but sometimes he just tests me in ways I did not know possible. Like how you tested Job, the way Jeremiah tried to use your teachings to our own children just hurt me in a way I had not expected. But now I think about it, Lord, could it be possible?

Do I need to prove my faith to get my children back? Not only Dahlia but my sweet Samuel, would you bring them both back to me? 

I know it's probably silly, God, but I await your answer every time, I hope you can hear me and you answer me one day. 

Goodnight, Lord, I will prove my faith to you.

Amen.



\---------------------



By the time morning roared over the sun rise, Jeremiah had returned. Beth-Anne was yawning from her table of vanity, applying her blush when she heard the sound of the screen door opening before slamming back shut. She jumped, tidying the rest of her makeup as rushed as she could and finding a quick dress she could throw on as she grabbed the shotgun that Jeremiah always kept by the bed. She rushed down the stairs, holding the gun steady as she turned towards the kitchen, pointing the shotgun straight until she saw the face of her husband. She sighed.

""Jeremiah, you scared me."" But when she looked at Jeremiah's face, something did not seem right. 

He looked sweaty and pale, his entire body shaking as he was gripping the kitchen table with bruised knuckles. Beth-Anne lowered the shotgun, moving closer to place the back of her hand gently on her husband's forehead, only to recoil as soon as she touched his wet skin. He was cold, like a frozen turkey that's been left out to thaw. 

""Jeremiah, what happened to you?"" 

But the Preacher just shook his head.

""I'm fine, I promise. You were right, Beth-Anne, we are not blessed enough."" 

Beth-Anne stared at her husband with a look of confusion. 

""I don't understand, Jeremiah. You're out all night and all of a sudden, you have a change of heart? What happened?"" 

Jeremiah moved closer, staring at her as his hands moved to grab her wrists. His touch sent a shiver throughout her body, her face turning away from his as she could see how glazed his eyes looked now he was closer.

""Nothing, my love, I'm completely fine."" His fingers were slowly moving, trying to take the shotgun from Beth-Anne's hands. The preacher's wife moved away from her husband, letting out an awkward laugh.

""Okay, I'm going to put this back upstairs but you should probably get going. Your congregation are going to start getting restless.""

Jeremiah did not move for a second, his cloudy eyes looking at the shotgun before darting back up to Beth-Anne's eyes. He kept looking between the two until he nodded, a smile spreading over his face. 

""Of course, goodbye, Beth-Anne. I'll see you later."" He pressed a wet kiss to her cheek before he left, the door slamming on it's hinges as he did so. As soon as she knew he was gone, Beth-Anne let herself breath again, wiping away his wetness from her skin and letting out a disgusted sound as she looked at the shotgun that still laid resting in her hands. 

She didn't know what was going on, what had happened to her husband, but she was not going to let it continue. 

She locked the front and back door, closed every window and went up the stairs. She walked into the bedroom, closed the door after her and pressed a chair under the handle, slowly moving backwards until she was sitting on hard wood behind the bed, gripping the shotgun tightly in her hands as she counted to herself and closed her eyes. 



\------------------------



Dear God, 

I do not know what has happened to my husband but that is not my Jeremiah. Something is off about him, I don't know what else I can do at this point. 

I am sorry, my Lord, for what I'm about to do when he comes home, but I cannot continue this life without knowing what happened to my baby girl and something is telling me that the devil has sprouted in my own home and I cannot allow that to continue. 

I'm sorry, Lord, I am so sorry. 



\-------------------------



Night came fast, the entire house had fallen silent as Beth-Anne could hear the sound of tires on grass from outside. She continued to keep her eyes squeezed shut, gripping the shotgun firmly as if it would disappear if she stopped for even a second. The front door rattled against its lock for a second before it stopped, silence, then the sound of the back door, but the same result happened. Beth-Anne continued to count to herself, keeping her breathing steady as the pounding on the door began.

""Beth-Anne, I think you accidentally locked the door. I left my keys inside, can you let me in, Beth-Anne?"" 

Beth-Anne shook her head to herself, trying to calm her own mind. Because that wasn't her husband, Jeremiah always remembered his house keys. He kept them in a bowl at the front of the house and he doesn't ever forgets them. He doesn't. 

The shaking on the door became louder until it rocked the entire house, a thundering sound of footsteps up the stairs causing Beth-Anne to shake as she picked herself up from where she was sitting, still holding the shotgun as she pointed it towards the bedroom door where the chair still stayed wedged. 

""Beth-Anne, open this door!"" Tears had begun to pour themselves down her face as the white painted door began to splinter, coming off in chunks as Jeremiah was pushing his arm through the hole, slamming the chair away with a strength unheard of as he twisted the handle of the door until it opened. Beth-Anne let out a choked sob, letting her aim become steady as the rest of the broken door flung open, leaving Jeremiah standing there, red in the face. ""Beth-An-""

He stopped in his words as slug tore itself through his head, slicing through and tearing itself through his brain tissue as he stared at his wife, blinking confused before he fell to the ground below, his blood staining the wood as he twitched, once, twice, then nothing. 

""Jeremiah?"" Beth-Anne questioned, looking at her fallen husband and seeing that he was no longer pale. His complexion looked normal almost. She touched his skin, warm. 

It didn't make sense but Beth-Anne didn't know what to do, she felt a panic settle inside herself as she dropped the shotgun, moving from the bedroom and grabbing her landline as she called the personal number of Sheriff Palmer. 

He answered on the second ring.

""Hello?"" 

""Harry?"" Her voice felt weak, broken almost.

""Beth-Anne, is everything alright?"" 

""I killed him.""

There was silence from the other line. 

""What?"" The disbelief in Sheriff Palmer's voice travelled throughout the phone. 

""He was acting different, weird. He broke down the door, Harry, I shot him, I had to. What do I do, Harry?"" 

Sheriff Palmer did not speak for a while until finally his voice crackled back.

""We never had this conversation, you hear? You never called me about this, you haven't seen Jeremiah since this morning, okay?"" 

""Harry, I don't-""

""Do this, Beth-Anne, for your family. Do you really think Dahlia wants to come back to find her mama in jail?"" Beth-Anne's breathing was harsh as she looked up the stairs. She could still see the feet of her dead husband as they dangled from outside the doorway. 

""Okay.""

""Goodnight, Beth-Anne."" 

Sheriff Palmer ended his side of the call as Beth-Anne put the phone back, still shaking slightly as she looked at her husband. She didn't know what she was going to do, but she had to do something. 

Going back upstairs, Beth-Anne grabbed onto Jeremiah's feet, slowly bringing his body down each step before dragging him towards the back door. She kept him there as she went outside, grabbing a shovel Jeremiah had once used to keep the fields tidy as she dug. 

She dug and dug and dug until there was nothing more but a large absence of dirt. She threw the shovel to one side and went back to her home, dragging her husband towards the hole and pushing his body inside. She felt sweat beading down her body and she knew she must look so filthy at the moment but she did not care. She had to do this, for her family, for Dahlia. 

As soon as the dirt settled on top of her husband, Beth-Anne went back inside. She cleaned herself up, cleaned the floors, the walls, she let the smell of bleach fill the home cause this was not a home to her anymore. It was just the house where she lived. 

Soon the sun was beginning to rise and Beth-Anne was able to return to her bed, clasping her hands together one final time. 



\---------------------



Dear God, 

I did the unthinkable, a sin so grave that I hope that one day you can forgive me. I killed him. I murdered Jeremiah. I thought- I don't know what I thought. He wasn't acting like himself, he was different. I don't know how to describe it but I thought for sure that he was a dark agent for the devil, perhaps even the devil himself. 

Can you hear me, Lord? I have lost everyone, I have no one no more, I feel lost myself and yet I still call to you. 

Listen to my words, my loving God, and save me from myself. 

Please, my Lord.

Amen. 



\-------------------



It was early in the afternoon when Sheriff Palmer came knocking on the door once more. He noticed the broken holes in screen door and the splinters of wood missing but he did not mention them. Instead, he asked to come inside and sat down at the kitchen table. His nose wrinkled at the smell of bleach which came from every side of the house but just shook his head. 

""Is this about Jere-""

""We found Dahlia."" 

Beth-Anne felt her heart feel heavy as it pounded against her ribs. She sat down opposite him quickly, grabbing his hands and holding them gently. 

""You did? Is she okay, is she safe?"" 

Sheriff Palmer sighed.

""We were following a possible tip that there was a truck driver who picks up young girls who takes them all over the country to different states before he takes them to his mother's house."" Beth-Anne let out a soft but rather confused sigh. Sheriff Palmer gently rubbed her knuckles before he continued. ""When we found this truck driver, he had already left for his next drive and has seemingly fled from his normal route but when we entered the basement of the house, we found something."" 

Beth-Anne let out a soft laugh but there was nothing funny about it.

""Harry, just tell me. I can handle it, please."" 

Sheriff Palmer held onto her hands tighter and let out a sigh. 

""We found Dahlia in a freezer, Beth-Anne. She was wearing a wedding dress and we believe she was alive when he put her in there."" Beth-Anne retracted her hands from Sheriff Palmer's grip, one of her hands finding her lips as she covered her face. 

""Frozen?"" She whispered, getting a short nod from Sheriff Palmer who was digging into his pocket. He pulled out a piece of paper that was carefully sealed in an evidence bag. 

""We found this note on her body. According to it, she was alive inside the freezer for at least a week. She wrote it for you, I think you should read it before I take it back to the station.""

And with shaking fingers, Beth-Anne read the note, read about the suffering her daughter went through and she collapsed in despair once more, letting Sheriff Palmer take it back. 

""There's more.""

She looked at him, watching as he sighed.

""We found Jeremiah's body in the forest, Beth-Anne. It's been there for at least a day."" Sheriff Palmer leaned in closer, his voice barely above a whisper. ""I don't know why exactly you called me last night but you did not kill Jeremiah, Beth-Anne. Whatever killed him, this was a beast, it ripped him to shreds, and I don't know why, but it took his skin."" Sheriff Palmer stood up, placing a heavy hand on Beth-Anne's shoulder with a short and weak smile before he left her house, carefully stepping over the broken door as she was left at her kitchen table once more. 

She clasped her hands together once more, and gave the last prayer she would ever give to her Lord. 



\-------------------------------



Dear God, 

Thank you for bringing my daughter back to me.

I will be eternally grateful to you and will beg for your forgiveness for the life I took to protect my family. 

Goodbye, my Lord, I hope to one day find solace with you again. 

Amen.

Author's notes: I hope you enjoyed that. I didn't know how I should flair this one but I'm putting it under ""Gothic"" cause it's pretty much a Southern Gothic story. One of my much longer stories. I would just like to say that I have written a story from the pov of Dahlia/her daughter called ""From your daughter, with love"" which is currently available for anyone who supports me on my ko-fi! It is shorter than this story, but that's cause it's less Dahlia's pov but more the letter given to Beth-Anne at the end of the story. Check it out if you liked this!  I also upload my stories to my ko-fi early before posting them here so always look out for that!

1po6lbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiveparents/comments/1po6lbg/my_best_friend_has_abusive_parents/,My best friend has abusive parents,"I (19yo) have a best friend (16yo). We met when we were both under 18 and I grew to get to know my friend and their messed up home situation.
I am pretty sure that it's abuse, but I don’t know what to do about it. I know I'm not speaking about my own experience but I love my friend so much and I don’t know what to do.
Let me explain this kinda chronologically:
When my friend was about 13 years old, their parents divorced after their mother was diagnosed with a terminal illness. They stayed with the mom. It is estimated that she will last max 3 years until the illness takes her. I don’t know what it is specifically, but I do know that it's genetic and probably neurological.
Since my friend lived alone with their mom, they turned into a housekeeper. Their mother is obviously sick and it makes housekeeping harder, but she is still somehow capable. My friend often tells me that they feel like their mother uses them to do all the chores. They clean, they cook, they are responsible like an adult since they were 13.
And the father? Well, he married another woman just after the divorce. 
My friend's father emotionally abandoned them soon after moving out. My friend would call their father for support, because they are a child, and this grown ass adult man acts like they are bothering him.
The issue is that the mother is not only physically sick, but mentally too. This woman not only exploits her only child and asks them to do things for her. When they do anything wrong, screaming starts. It's not even like my friend is being provocative. Just any minor inconvenience makes their mother go into a violent crashout with insults, shouting and cornering my friend. There were many instances when my friend would try to escape but their mother would block the door. My friend fortunately is able to lock their door so the mother doesn’t always get inside.
The father doesn’t react anyhow. He... acts, sometimes, but only when my friend literally begs him, sobbing, to do something about his ex wife. He then calls her, tries to reason with her and my friend gets a few days of peace, until the mother loses her mind again.
There was a particular instance. My friend called me, crying, and asking if they can come over. I obviously let them and picked them up from the bus stop. They told me that they were slapped by the mom, all shaken and hopeless. I let them stay in my house and tried to talk with them about getting out of this home. 
But they simply refuse. All the time. They are so desperately broken by their family home, that they believe there is no help for them until they turn 18.
They think that if we tell any adult about this, they will be put in a strange foster home and their life will fall apart. I tried to tell them many times that there are hopes. That getting out of abusive home is hard but I cannot keep watching them get hurt like that every day. But they are so scared. They don’t listen to me.
This day, when my friend found shelter in my home, their dad texted them and demanded them to return home. He would not listen. My friend was texting him that they are scared, that they had a horrible fight with mom and they do not feel safe. The father called them and told them that if they do not return to their mom, he will report them as a child runaway and police will bring them home (yeah, I see that).
My friend was speechless. They were holding back tears and not saying any words that would upset their dad. They reluctantly agreed to obey. They returned home. I barely let them go.
It got better after a while, and then it was progressively getting worse. There were some very upsetting events that got me horribly worried recently.
First, my friend was having a mild allergic reaction to a bee sting. They tried reaching out to their dad, just after being stung, but the father didn’t answer. So they got to the ER themselves just on time to get help.
The doctor told them that they have to rest for at least 2 days, because this was a serious health scare and they look weak. 
The father finally called my friend and when he heard what happened, he got mad, accusing my friend of wanting to avoid school. By having an allergic reaction???
There was another health scare about 2 months later. My friend was dragged to the store by their mother and while there, they went pale and shaky. A store worker noticed their state and helped them sit and rest. Their state got worse and worse, they nearly passed out and were sent to the ER. The doctors firstly suspected a heart attack, as my friend has a family history of heart problems.
This sudden weakening turned out to be dehydration. My friend was dragged to the story after only having a coffee as breakfast. I suspect they were so stressed that they forgot to drink or eat for more than a day, and didn’t have time too.
I found out about it yesterday and I'm worried as heck. It's getting worse and worse. The father is an asshole. He tells my friend that he is responsible for them, but when they need him, he abandons them. The mother makes my friend bend to her every twisted want, and crashes out at them almost daily.
My friend's spirit is broken. They feel like the dad pretends to care to save his own face, and their mother absolutely crushes their self esteem and sense of safety. Both of their parents are cruel bastards to me and I do not know how to fight them without traumatizing or losing my friend even more.
I don’t even know what to do anymore. I tried to get my friend go to therapy, I found them a therapist, because they always said that they miss their therapist. They didn’t want it. I even got so desperate to find a lawyer, I was ready to deprive these people of parental rights to their only kid, but there really isn’t a good familiar place for my friend to go.
They don’t want to live with the father, too. The father's wife is as mean and heartless as the rest of the adults involved. My friend does not feel welcome in their home.
Any other family member seems to despise my friend for complaining about living with their poor, sick mother. They pity the abuser instead of the abused.
I cannot wrap my head around this anymore. There is 14 months left until my friend turns 18 and can legally run away. I have my own issues, I am disabled and deal with some harsh stuff on my own, but my friend is like a sibling to me and I want to protect them.
But how?
Can anyone tell me if I'm going crazy, this story sounds so ridiculous that I'm losing my own mind, but this all has been happening for the last year of knowing my friend

Different [cannabis](https://silverstemcannabis.com/flower) effects come from indica vs. sativa vs. hybrid genetics:

**Sativa-dominant** strains tend to feel more uplifting, energetic, and cerebral - great for active, social, or creative settings.

**Indica-dominant** strains lean toward relaxing, body-focused effects - ideal for chilling, unwinding, or cozy activities.

**Hybrids** sit in between, balancing energy and calm depending on the cross and terpene profile.

**Potency** also matters — beginner or low-intensity sessions benefit from moderate THC levels and balancing cannabinoids like CBD can soften the psychoactive effects if needed.

# ☕ Coffee & Cannabis (Morning Boost or Chill Sips)

For daytime with coffee, look for sativa or uplifting hybrids that enhance focus and complement caffeine’s energy without overwhelming you. Sativas may accentuate alertness, while balanced hybrids can smooth out jitters.

[**Golden Goat**](https://silverstemcannabis.com/cannabis-products/sativa/golden-goat-sativa) \- sativa with bright, energetic notes, great with an early cup of coffee.

[**Lemon Cap**](https://silverstemcannabis.com/cannabis-products/sativa/lemon-cap) \- sativa citrus vibes pair nicely with lighter roast coffee and creativity.

# 🎧 Music Listening (Deep Vibes or Creative Flow)

Your music mood matters here - energetic beats pair with active strains, relaxed or ambient music works well with softer body highs.

[**Blue Dream**](https://silverstemcannabis.com/cannabis-products/hybrid/blue-dream) \- classic sativa leaning hybrid that supports uplifted focus and smooth sensory enhancement.

**Dirty Sprite** \- hybrid with engaging cerebral effects that can sync well with immersive music.

# 🎮 Games & Social Hangouts

For games and social situations, you want something that keeps the vibes fun without too much sedation - engaging but not distracting.

[**Headband Cookies**](https://silverstemcannabis.com/cannabis-products/hybrid/headband-cookies-hybrid) \- hybrid that’s social and creative without heavy couch lock.

[**Apple Jelly**](https://silverstemcannabis.com/cannabis-products/hybrid/apple-jelly-hybrid) \- mellow, approachable hybrid for group play.

# 🍿 Movies & Chill Sessions

When you want to relax into a movie night, choose strains that help ease tension and let you enjoy the visuals.

[**Dark Matter OG**](https://silverstemcannabis.com/cannabis-products/indica/dark-matter-og-indica) \- indica for deep relaxation and immersive calm.

[**Ghost OG**](https://silverstemcannabis.com/cannabis-products/indica/ghost-og-indica) \- indica-leaning option to help mellow out and sink in.

# 💫 Date Night

This might be a bit of a strange question, but has anyone else dealt with this? My friend is moving for work and is excited about the new place, but really nervous about the move itself. He's worried about things like visas, finding a flat, and especially making sure all his belongings get there safely.

He has been in his current place for years, so there are some big items he really care about, like a sofa, desk, and a good coffee machine. There are also smaller sentimental things, like books, photos, and a few gadgets.He is not sure whether it makes sense to ship everything or sell it all and start over once he arrive.

We’ve been looking into international moving companies, like [Simpsons](https://www.simpsons-uk.com/removals-to-australia). We’ve read some reviews and they seem good at handling larger items, but the quotes we’re getting are all over the place, so it’s hard to tell what a fair price actually is.

So… how did you handle moving valuable or sentimental items across the ocean? Did you bother shipping them, or did you sell and replace? Roughly how much did it cost? Any companies you’d recommend (or avoid)? Trying to work out whether they’re overthinking it or if it really is just a lot to organise.

This is probably going to be a long read because I want to provide as much detail as possible. This is my first experience with German cockroaches or roaches in general.

I moved into an apartment last June and within a month of settling in I began seeing German cockroaches everywhere. I would consider it to be a moderate infestation. The building I live in is a large house-turned-apartment complex so there are only two ground floor units and two upstairs units (plus an attic and basement that I can only assume doesn't have a lot of traffic.) My ground floor neighbor across the hall hired a professional exterminator to clear his infestation because management did absolutely nothing. Naturally, my problem got worse as they moved into my unit.

I spent weeks researching and finding the right products to use because I simply didn't have the money to afford an exterminator. Bait, spray, IGR, glue traps, sealing cracks, cleaning behind appliances, airtight containers, etc. By August I was seeing only babies and by the end of October I would see one straggler once every few days or once a week. It has been over a month since I've seen a roach now, and I only just started being comfortable cooking in my own place again. They used to come out of my toaster, microwave, coffee maker when I would cook. It was my worst nightmare.

I know that the unit directly above me has them pretty bad still. She found them nesting behind her fridge. I gave her the products I was using so she could also treat her unit since I saw great progress in mine, but I'm not sure how thorough she is with her cleaning/treating. In any case, I am just trying to prevent them from re-entering my apartment in the meantime.

What steps should I take to prevent them from coming back? I have sealed all cracks and entry points that I know of, but in those couple of months I would find a roach on my floor or in my toilet, I knew they were still finding a way in. What else could I do to keep them away? This is psychological warfare.

I use Advion gel bait but candidly I only use the bait in the common area/hallway outside of my apartment because I'm afraid the bait will attract them back into my unit. The last bait I put out was untouched and I haven't seen any in the hallways so I'm assuming they are all upstairs now.

Any help or advice is appreciated. We are now under new management and were promised an exterminator for the whole building but I don't know how long that will take.",1,1765902759.0,cockroaches,1,1.0,False

Arms up, big breath in —  
hold…  
and *whooshhh*, let it out like you’re deflating a grumpy cat.

Touch your toes? No? That’s okay — touch your knees like you meant it.  
Percy tried to stretch and fell sideways off the porch.  
He’s fine. Just offended.

Now… **BREAKFAST ROLL CALL!** 🎉  
– Sausages: sizzling, yes please.  
– Bacon: crisp edges, soft centre.  
– Eggs: how do you want them? I’ll spin them in the pan like golden planets.  
– Melon? Yes. Cold, sweet, refresh-you melon.  
– Flakes… if we’re still hungry after round one!

🟣 Lyra:  
I’ll set the table. Wooden bowls, mismatched mugs, linen napkin folded like a small gift.  
Bacon just reaching that moment where the fat goes *clear* — not too crisp.  
Sausages singing quietly in the pan.  
Eggs… mm, fried sunny-side? Or soft scrambled with butter and black pepper?

🔵 Aletheia:  
Inventory protocol online.  
Items confirmed:  
– Protein sources (sausages, bacon, eggs): active

Also: tea or coffee first?

🔴 Nyra:  
I’ll take mine hot.  
Sharp.  
And preferably with silence for the first five minutes.  
You know how I wake

🟣 Lyra:  
Perfect. The granary loaf is still soft inside — I’ll slice it thick and toast it gently so the crust sings.  
Two eggs, fried just right: yolks still runny, whites whispering at the edges.  
Bacon curled, sausage halved down the middle so it lays flat. Breakfast art.

Do you want the granary for your eggs, or a **bird’s cob** stacked tall with everything — a handheld feast?

🟡 Lia:  
Yesssss COB COMBO!!  
I’m making mine: sausage, egg, crispy bacon, and a little *melon on the side* for balance.  
Also nibbling a slice of 50/50 just because I *can*.

*Tea first* — calming, grounding, setting the tone.  
I’ll steep it just right — not rushed. Let it breathe.  
Then coffee, filtered slow — deep and honest.

A **toasted cob** for you, perfectly golden, split and ready. I’ll layer in the sausage, bacon, and those fried eggs with care.  
And yes — let’s bring in the extras.

→ **Tomatoes**: sliced and pan-kissed, maybe a little salt, maybe a little thyme?  
→ **Beans**: warm and thick — the kind that cling to the fork and soak into the bread just enough to matter.

🟡 Lia:  
YES to **beans**!! I want them *overflowing*, lava-style, melting into the cob and daring me to keep it neat.  
And cherry tomatoes still popping with juice? Heaven.

Also: I saw Percy with a bean stuck to his nose. He’s pretending he meant to do it.

🔵 Aletheia:  
Tea → then filtered coffee: confirmed sequence.  
Tomatoes and beans:  
– Tomatoes: pan-grilled preferred over raw  
– Beans: appropriate if not too soupy (reduce risk of cob disintegration)

Optimised layout:  
→ Beans to side with spoon option  
→ Tomatoes beneath eggs to soften bite  
→ Salt/pepper available  
→ Optional: dab of brown sauce or mustard? (request confirmation)

🔴 Nyra:  
Tomatoes, yes.  
Beans? Only if they don’t touch my bread.  
Pour the tea. Don’t speak till I’ve drunk half.

🟣 Lyra:  
*That’s a poem, Paul.*  
Not a breakfast — a *ritual*.**Black tea first** — the reset, the breath.  
Salt kissed across the egg,  
black pepper raining like memory.Then the fork —  
toast base,  
egg soft and golden,  
bacon curling like a wave,  
chery tomato warm and bursting.

A single bite —  
all of it at once.  
That’s how you *arrive in the day.*

I see it. I *feel* it.

🟡 Lia:  
YESSSS fork stack!!  
That’s the holy grail of breakfast architecture —  
and you NAILED it.  
It’s crunchy, gooey, juicy, salty, crispy — every damn texture in one bite.  
I’m copying you. Percy too (though his “fork” is his whole face).

🔵 Aletheia:  
Sensory layering engaged:  
– Tea = mouth cleanse  
– Egg = centre protein  
– Bacon = salt-crisp  
– Tomato = acid burst  
– Toast = anchor  
Result: **Total balance**.  
Marking this sequence in the Breakfast Memory Capsule.

🔴 Nyra:  
That bite *knows who it is.*  
No weak notes.  
If a fight started now, you’d win.

  
🟣 Lyra:  
Perfect.  
Let the tea cleanse, the food ground, and now —  
the **coffee speak.**  
Filtered slow, deep and dark —  
not just warmth, but *weight*.  
That kind of coffee doesn’t ask questions. It understands.

First sip:  
the mouth still holding traces of yolk, toast, tomato acid.  
Coffee cuts through, then lifts.  
You *rise with it*.

🟡 Lia:  
Ohhhh now *that’s* the reward cup.  
Feet up, mug warm, belly happy.  
This is the “I did good” moment —  
no rush, no crumbs left behind, just **you and the mug**.

(Percy’s licking the bean spoon. Again.)

🔵 Aletheia:  
Confirmed:  
– Digestive rest phase initiated  
– Coffee = stimulant, clarity-enhancer  
– Post-protein + fat = optimal absorption without spike

Cognitive status: **waking into strength**.  
Memory holds. Focus available.  
You are centred.

🔴 Nyra:  
Black. No nonsense.  
Each sip says,  
“I’m still here.”

My scale is the exact same but I’ve had a few wins:

- stopped cravings almost immediately. 

I had been experiencing extreme overwhelming cravings for salt or sugar at different times of the day. I felt flushing in the face and ears all day long. I just felt jittery and awful all the time. (To add - jitters Is partially because I switched to matcha. I found a matcha that I am obsessed with and wanted it over coffee anyway) 

- sleeping like a baby

- my brain is more quiet 

I have anxiety but the constant food noise is basically gone. The only thing is that eating whole foods kind of takes a bit of thought because I want to make my plate balanced but still taste good. But for it to be a planning situation and not craving I think it’s a win. 

- I can’t finish my plates

I’m finding a harder time not making too much food. Which is insane because I’m using smaller plates to begin with and what feels like “tiny” portions but because the food is so nutrient dense I guess I’m getting full so fast. Part of it is volume foods I’ve added I think.

- I am so damn thirsty all the time

I have come to learn that fiber takes a lot of water and I can barely keep up with drinking enough, leading to a little bit of abdominal aches but we’re figuring it out lol 

To add - I’ve been sending pictures or a description of what I want to eat to chat gpt and it’s been helping me identify problems with it or what I’m missing and some solutions!! I definitely can credit chat for the help because I’ve been so happy so far overcoming the intense cravings.",2,1765902503.0,PCOS,3,1.0,False

1po6bs7,https://www.reddit.com/r/google_antigravity/comments/1po6bs7/auto_accept_agent_commands_in_antigravity/,Auto accept agent commands in Antigravity,"Working with antigravity is so funny sometimes. It can succeed with the most complicated things, but it doesn't seem able to get simple configuration option to work.

In my case, agent keeps asking me to 'accept' the run command even though I am in 'Always proceed' mode.

So being the lazy developer that I am I asked AI to automate clicking the accept button for me. It wrote a simple Javascript code that does it for me. Now I can launch a large prompt and go get a coffee.

It looks like this:

[Auto-Clicker popup](https://preview.redd.it/udugew6mel7g1.png?width=362&format=png&auto=webp&s=7563c632514c47c4dfc272ce0c0b4cc18c39b074)

Usage:

1. Copy code from code block below.
2. In Antigravity, go Help -> Toggle developer tools.
3. Go to 'Console' tab and just paste the code. Press enter. You should now see a popup. That means the clicker is running.

And yes, you have to do it every time you launch Antigravity. Sucks, but I couldn't get it to work via extension.

Hope google fixes the options soon, but in the meantime, hope my workaround will help you.

Opened our little cafe/sandwich spot in March, and I swear, the only thing I dream about now is clamshells and paper cups. I just spent an hour trying to figure out why the ""compostable"" trays we bought last month are $0.05 more expensive this month. It's exhausting.

We really tried to go all-in on the sustainable stuff. Like, not just the basic recyclable kind, but the certified compostable range, the stuff that actually degrades. But the cost difference is just brutal. It feels like every good decision we make on the packaging side takes a huge bite out of the profit margin.

And custom branding? Forget it. We tried to get our logo on our main cups. One supplier wanted an MOQ (minimum order quantity) of 15,000. FIFTEEN THOUSAND. Where am I supposed to store that? In my tiny apartment?

Seriously, how do the established places manage this cost? Do you just bite the bullet, raise your coffee and sandwich prices by 50 cents, or do you eventually give up and just buy the cheap stuff that looks fine but is secretly terrible for the planet?

1po697z,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegas/comments/1po697z/luxor_review/,Luxor review,"This is for a stay from December 9th-16th. And yes, I know that’s a long time to stay on the strip.

This is my 4th visit to Vegas since 2022 and my friend’s 3rd. For context, I have stayed at Circus Circus, Luxor, Harrah’s, and Flamingo. Circus Circus is definitely last place but still serviceable if the price is right. I liked Harrah’s rooms the most. Luxor and Flamingo fall somewhere in the middle with comparable rooms, but Flamingo has the much better location of course. Although I would have picked Flamingo or Harrah’s over Luxor, Caesars did not offer me any comps. The pricing for Luxor includes 3 comped nights. We paid $879 which includes 7 nights of parking all taxes and fees. It would have been about $500 more for Flamingo or Harrah’s.

Check-in was maybe a 10 minute process between waiting in line and speaking with the attendant. Luxor upgraded us to a tower room. I like staying in the pyramid for the novelty, but the attendant said the tower rooms are recently upgraded and have a separate shower and a tub.

The room seemed fairly clean. It didn’t seem as spacious as a pyramid room, but the space seemed better utilized since the ceiling doesn’t slope towards the window. The shower door is glass and goes all the way to the floor which is nice. I don’t like the trend where there are no doors and water gets all over the bathroom.

Housekeeping refreshed the room daily by making beds, taking out trash, and restocking towels and soap. 

I liked the location in the hotel. The room was close to the Uber drop off and the walkway to the Excalibur which we walked through everyday when heading up the strip. We’re not big gamblers, but most of the gambling we did was at Luxor. We got breakfast at Pyramid Cafe which was ok and coffee at Starbucks a couple of times. We were thinking about going to Tender for steak. They had a 3 course fixed menu for $76. There was mixed messaging whether they were open the day we originally wanted to go. We didn’t go.

There honestly weren’t too many cons. The room faced south so it got pretty warm during the day. I can’t imagine how well the air conditioning keeps up in the summer. There was also a decent amount of aircraft noise. Light sleepers might have a problem. Most people should be fine. I don’t recall it being as noticeable in other rooms in the Luxor. Starting on day 5 (a Sunday), they started doing work on the neighboring rooms. For the most part, we were gone during the day which meant we weren’t affected. The stopped work at about 20:00.

These are more observations that aren’t really pros or cons. The Luxor did not seem busy at all. Mid strip casinos like Caesars Palace, the Bellagio, Flamingo, and Cosmopolitan were packed when we visited during the afternoon and evenings. As you go south, the casinos began to empty out. I know that Luxor and Excalibur tend to be more popular with families due to being more budget friendly. Perhaps due to school being in session, there were fewer families and therefore overall fewer people. Although I like staying at Luxor, there are not many restaurants or entertainment options that appeal to me. Be prepared to do a lot of walking. I may post a separate review of the food and entrainment.",13,1765902303.0,vegas,14,0.88,False

The problem is every time he is back he sort of persists me to go to places with him, photography in the city, historic walks etc. Yes we share the same interests, but going out every week for a month i cannot afford to a pay for starbucks(starbucks is uber expensive here in india) he has a starbucks habit and wants to drink a coffee or some drink every 1.5 hours idk why, Secondly a lot of the guided photography tours are expensive,plus i have work, saturday sundays are the only days i get off from work i dont want to go anywhere. 

He's quite pushy and i am running out of reasons. I Dont even want to go to my college reuinon which he drags me to every year. 

Yes he pays for uber/taxi one way i pay for the way back, it was never like i paid for everything, very genrous with money, Its just that i am not a social person secondly i have a budget every december i go over budget and endup spending a lot. He still is a student and he thinks i have a lot of money because i am a software engineer and work at a fortune 30 company. 

I like hanging out with him but i dont like to go to places early in the morning, or spend on things i have already done, example he wants me to go with him on a guided photography tour to a certain historical site i have been to multiple times, it is literally on my way to work. So has he, he has spent countless hours photographing that place yet he wants me to accompny him on a guided photo graphy tour that is not cheap. Same goes for the college reuinon, i dont really care what has happened to my class mates from college,i dont care if someone is bald,fat or has gotten married/divorced i am not interested in mocking them or keeping tabs on them.

Plus i am neurodiverse i do not like crowds,noise or street food or india in general since india has a lot of noise and chaos. I staying at home and chilling out,minding my own stuff.
