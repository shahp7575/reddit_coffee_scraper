1pkh4us,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1pkh4us/buying_advice_what_you_make_of_automatic_espresso/,Buying Advice. What you make of automatic espresso machines and would you own one alongside your regular espresso machine? [$2000],"A while back we had a regular Breville Barista. We didn't like it. Traded it in. Went for nespresso to make life easy. That was crazy decision. The espresso tasted watery and was luke-warm all the time.  Came to find out that there is such little coffee inside those capsules to the water ratio thats why. Now some people go for automatic machines like Jura or Delonghi, but I can't help wonder if they suffer from the same thing Nespresso did. Weak. Not hot. I was doing some research on the temp of the water and it was really low compared to using a PID on an espresso machine and a single boiler or just a kettle. Apparently its because the companies want to avoid lawsuits with water being too hot.

Like I love the ease of having an automatic say like a Delonghi rivelia for those days you can't be bothered with pissingaround with grinding, tamping, all that jazz but I do wonder if the automatic espresso machines even the high ends ones over $2,000 are a waste of money because, you are going to the issues people seem to run into, weak coffee, not enough coffee is coming out, what does come out is not hot, and then things breaking.

Im so used to my V60 and a goosneck kettle. Boilng it to a set temp and getting a hot coffee.

So my question is, im considering buying either:

1. Profitec Go $1,620 but they said they would throw in a grinder DF54
2. Quick Mill Pop-up $1,613 with a DF54 grinder
3. Or just getting a Delonghi rivelia $1399 on amazon then just hit a button and boom.

Music Pattern 

The music in *FROM* isn’t just background noise; it acts like a character of its own, subtly guiding our emotions and hinting at the underlying dynamics of the town. If we were to chart the emotional ebb and flow of the series, the soundtrack would be right there at the core.


**The Jukebox: A Time Capsule Out of Place**

The jukebox tunes draw heavily from the rock, country, folk, and blues of the 60s and 70s. These genres aren’t about nostalgia; they evoke a sense of dislocation. Tracks like “Town Without Pity,” “Highway Star,” and “Ol’ ’55” revolve around themes of being trapped or yearning to escape. The jukebox isn’t merely a diner fixture; it embodies the soundscape of individuals caught between journeys. Interestingly, every song from the jukebox comes from a realm where escape seems possible. Yet in *FROM*, these tracks loop endlessly, like echoes of a chorus that never arrives.


**Recurring Songs as Emotional Anchors**

Certain tracks recur like familiar omens. “If I Had a Boat” appears three times, perfectly capturing the essence of longing for freedom—the boat, the horse, the magical escape that feels just out of reach. Each time it plays, it coincides with moments when hope is both enticing and a little delusional. Boyd the storm


Then there's Joni Mitchell’s “Blue,” which surfaces in both Season 1 and Season 3. It’s not about sadness; it’s about clarity. When it plays, tabitha confront her own reflections—regret, longing, and a raw honesty. It’s like holding a mirror up to those who are struggling.


**Pixies’ “Que Sera Sera”**
This track becomes the show's anthem, but not in the upbeat Doris Day style. The Pixies transform it into a haunting lullaby. The vibe is deceptively calm, almost like someone softly humming to keep despair at bay. The lyrics suggest inevitability, while the sound evokes a sense of unease, creating a compelling contradiction that resonates throughout the series.


The use of “Celebration” in Season 3 is one of the most jarring moments in the soundtrack. It plays right after Tian-Chen’s death, which feels absurdly out of place. This tonal shift is intentional, reflecting the Tower’s influence. A moment meant for grief morphs into an awkward festivity, as the system attempts to mask sorrow with forced joy. This moment highlights how the soundtrack serves as an external force in the narrative, going beyond mere production choices.


**Roy Orbison, Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen—The Prophets of Liminal Space**

These artists carry a unique, mythic sadness. Orbison’s dreamlike soundscapes, Dylan’s apocalyptic tales, and Cohen’s spiritual acceptance all speak to characters standing at the edge of something profound. They’re used sparingly at pivotal emotional junctures: “Hurricane” plays when chaos reigns and moral clarity is murky. “If It Be Your Will” surfaces during moments of surrender, when characters admit they can’t control their fates.“A Hard Rain’s A-Gonna Fall” marks a point when danger escalates to something biblical.

These songs don’t explain *FROM*; they echo the experience of being enveloped by it.

**Jade’s Violin: Hope Amidst Chaos**

Jade’s violin solos are the only original sounds within the town’s confines. Everything else is a nostalgic echo. His music represents an effort to bring order to a chaotic world. In contrast, the music box melody serves as a fear distortion, alluring yet destructive. When Jade plays alongside it, it’s like witnessing a dialogue between two opposing forces. By Season 3, “Eternal Lullaby” signifies his transition from an outsider to becoming part of the town’s intricate web.


**Genre Distribution: A Quiet Pattern Emerges**

Rock, folk, blues, and outlaw country dominate the soundtrack. These genres share common threads: They tell stories (journeys, confessions, revelations), They feature outsider archetypes (rebels, wanderers, the haunted). They exist in the space between the sacred and the ordinary.


Notably absent are metal, pop, and hip-hop. Disco makes a fleeting appearance in “Celebration,” yet even then, it feels out of place, which is precisely the point. The soundtrack is carefully curated to evoke a sense of liminality.


**Season-by-Season Energy Curve**

In Season 1, music is used sparingly, almost like a whisper from the town. Season 2’s cues reflect instability, with songs appearing only at the beginning and end, as the chaos in between is too intense for music to settle in. By Season 3, the few tracks are precise, landing at significant emotional shifts.

The overall pattern reveals a gradual retreat: the town becomes more musically silent as the seasons progress, as if hope is being consumed little by little.


There's something wonderfully wild happening with the ""From"" playlist—something the creator cleverly hinted at, but most viewers seem to have missed it.The jukebox isn't just background music; it acts as a narrative system. The genres chosen aren't random; they reflect the energy of the moment.



The songs in the jukebox can be split into two energetic streams:

(forward energy / escape / fire / willpower)
The Animals – ""We Gotta Get Out of This Place"", Deep Purple – ""Highway Star"", Deep Purple – ""Child in Time"" (emotion explosion + moral judgment), Talking Heads – ""Pulled Up"", Bob Dylan – ""Hurricane"", Suzi Quatro – ""If You Can’t Give Me Love""


These are all ""pushing"" songs. Their energy rises, moving forward against the odds.They play when characters are in ""push"" mode, not despair.


For example: when Tian-Chen dies, the diner music shifts to an upbeat tempo—this isn’t just entertainment. It’s the ""From"" system trying to balance despair (brutal death) with cheer up (songs that elevate the mood). Of course the target get brutally unmood but Kenny stop crying. 


(inward energy / nostalgia / sadness / surrender)

Gene Pitney – ""Town Without Pity"", Gene Pitney – ""Last Chance to Turn Around"", Johnny Cash – ""Any Old Wind That Blows"", Joni Mitchell – ""Blue"" , Joni Mitchell – ""Both Sides Now"", Tom Waits – ""Ol' '55"", Tom Waits – ""The Piano Has Been Drinking"", Janis Ian – ""At Seventeen""


These are ""dive inward"" songs, filled with regret, nostalgia, reflection, and emotional wounds. They surface when the characters or the town are in a low-energy phase, or fear-energy. The diner serves as an energy barometer for Fromville. If the songs start leaning heavily toward fear, it signals that the town is under collective emotional pressure.


**Thematic Pattern: Escape vs. Fate**

Every song features two overarching themes:

Escape
""We Gotta Get Out of This Place"", ""Highway Star"", ""A Trick of the Tail"", ""If I Had a Boat"", ""One More Cup of Coffee"", ""Ol’ ’55""

Escape is a central obsession for the ""From"" system: which characters are trying to break free from their nodes?. Whenever characters in an episode begin discussing hope, plans to leave, or finding an ""out,"" the music joins the soundtrack of that system.

The jukebox literally reacts.


Fate / Inevitable Return
""Que Sera Sera"", ""Town Without Pity"", ""Blue"", ""Both Sides Now"", ""At Seventeen"", ""Stars"", ""Child in Time"" (a song about karmic reckoning)


From a fear perspective, these songs are soothing yet paralyzing. They represent the idea that ""you’re here because your path isn’t complete."" The jukebox becomes a sound divination tool.


The Creepier Pattern: Jukebox Reacts to What the Town Needs, Not What the Characters Choose. There’s a strong clue here. The diner never plays songs that lead people toward panic or chaos. While many rock songs from the '60s and '70s express anger, the creator only selected:


Rock that ignites courage or folk that soothes emotional wounds. Nothing chaotic, Why is that?. Because Fromville (the middle node) needs stability. If characters are too high-energy, the system pulls in fear. If they’re too low, it injects hope/cheer up. It functions like an emotional thermostat.


The Tian-Chen Moment. When Tian-Chen dies, the hope energy drops dramatically. Excess hope can trigger a reset or chaos, so the system plays a celebration song. It projects outward. The song selection isn't random; it aims to prevent the node from falling into despair. Music acts as medicine. When Jim funeral on S4 they should play song themes suit his best. Stay away from family mfers, so audiences crack what this series all about im lost! 


Hidden Connection: Diner = Neutral Node, Tower = hope Node. The diner always serves as a place for: Real conversations, Important information, Mood balancing a space for people to ""rearrange their thoughts.""


The diner sits at the heart of the town—neutral. Its jukebox is also neutral, ""resetting"" characters to a safe position. The creator described it as: ""The diner is the beating heart of Fromville"". It’s literally the emotional heart.


Talking Heads appear twice—this is significant. They are the band most closely associated with music about: Disorientation, Split identity, An absurd world, Humorous paranoia, Glitches in reality. The song ""Psycho Killer"" appears not just for laughs but as a signal from the system: ""Your mind is splitting from the node. Slow down.""


There’s a major pattern that is incredibly consistent: Music serves as a tool for regulating fear and hope. Genres are not random but divided into push (hope) and pull (fear). The diner acts as the emotional balancing node for the town. The tower channels bursts of hope (like the celebration music after Tian-Chen).The songs are used by the system to keep characters on their trajectory within their roles.",1,1765508717.0,FromSeries,0,1.0,False

Hello, dear readers.

This is Tremendous.

After a long and longer time, A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation has come to an end.

Truly...

I feel both light and strangely wistful deep in my chest.

While writing this, I think I had fun.

Of course, if someone told me, ""You enjoyed it so much, go back and write it all over again!""

I feel like my mental state would just collapse on the spot.

Anyway...

If I had to write it again, it would be hard, but it really was a story I found joyful and fulfilling.

Especially the self-actualization.

There were so many scenes I thought, ""I absolutely have to write this,"" and...

I was so happy to be able to put those scenes into words.

The thematic core of A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation, which I also mentioned in the setting notes I gave to the webtoon artist, is...

""Gratitude for life.""

Not a single thing we enjoy...

Not a ray of sunlight, not a breath of air, not even a single grain of sand, is actually something we're guaranteed to have.

Honestly, the very fact that the planet hasn't been wiped out by a meteor, or that a solar storm hasn't obliterated Earth is itself a miracle.

Each and every detail of us being alive at all is a coincidence and a miracle...

So, I wanted to express gratitude toward this world.

A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation is something created while searching for reasons to be grateful for life.

You can think of the main theme as pondering why we should be grateful for life.

Under the question, ""Why must we be grateful to this thing called life?"" I kept throwing questions at Seo Eun-hyun again and again.

And the answer to that is...

Because there are so many precious chances.

Because time that has passed will never return.

Because even though there are bad connections, good connections undeniably exist as well.

Because the very act of rejoicing, raging, grieving, enjoying, loving, hating, and desiring within life is itself something to be deeply grateful for.

Because there is someone or something we can blame.

And even when there is no such target of blame, the simple act of us incomplete people searching for answers together is itself happiness.

Because life is a miracle.

And maybe, simply...

Just because we can be grateful.

""Because this world is a miracle, everything in it is also a miracle"" is what I wanted to discuss together with you, the readers, through A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation.

And I think I was happy just to be able to pull so many scenes that discuss ""life is a miracle"" into reality and offer them to you all.

Seo Eun-hyun beheading Makli Hyeon.

Seo Eun-hyun defeating Makli Wangshin and giving his disciples a chance.

Seo Eun-hyun offering thanks beneath the giant tree.

Seo Eun-hyun climbing to Ultimate Pinnacle, breaking through the Heavenly Rejection phenomenon, and reflecting again on the preciousness of connections.

Seo Eun-hyun cutting through the Heavenly Tribulation and rising beneath the heavens alongside the Formless Sword.

Seo Eun-hyun, together with Buk Hyang-hwa, realizing that life is a miracle and letting her go...

And beyond that, Jeon Myeong-hoon, shouting his fury as he witnesses the fall of the Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect.

The elders of Black Ghost Valley sacrificing themselves to protect the Black Ghost Valley that is heading toward ruin because of Kang Min-hee.

Azure Tiger Saint exploding and showing what it means to become a star.

The Mad Lord's Entering Heavens Beyond the Path, Heart of Love.

(Heart of Yeon (然/Nature), Heart of Yeon (緣/Fate), Heart of Yeon (戀/Yearning) all combined into Heart of Yeon (戀/Love)—this is a line I've been dying to write since the early days of the work.)

The scene where Yeon Wei and Hon Won forgive each other, reconcile, and reunite inside a burning mansion.

Seo Hweol's final moments—Goodbye, Daoist Seo...

And also, the Star Genesis Supreme Deity's advancement!

I wanted to write the Star Genesis Supreme Deity's advancement and the Owner of Myriad Stars so badly that every time it felt like A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation itself was speaking to me to the point I wanted to scream...

I remember wanting to write it so intensely I thought I'd lose my mind.

""Star Genesis Supreme Deity, Star Genesis Supreme Deity has to be written.

""Even if the process gets wrecked, at least Star Genesis Supreme Deity no matter what!""

With that kind of madness, I ran all the way here.

It was also fun setting up the villains.

Yuan Li, as the boss that closes out the very first main episode, was a bit difficult.

But wrapping up characters like the Mad Lord, Seo Hweol, and the Great Mountain Supreme Deity was genuinely fun.

Same with Hong Fan.

In a way, the villains are where I projected myself.

So I think I've always ended up rooting for the villains more than Seo Eun-hyun, projecting myself into them, and having them stand against Seo Eun-hyun.

The Mad Lord with his grotesque appearance (the author looks kind of funny too), and Seo Hweol, who controls information so the opponent can never see what's really going on.

Hong Fan, who is still just a young child and soft on the inside...

All the villains who carried A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation.

They were all me.

Truly...

It's been a long journey.

At the end of it all, I feel like I managed to land the ending well...so a lot of different emotions are hitting me.

I feel proud, a little sad, wistful...

Also refreshed.

Of course...

To be honest, if I'm going to spill some TMI about the ending and everything around it:

In the early stages, A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation did not have its settings and details, its ending, or its final boss so clearly defined like they are now.

The setting and ending for A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation were set around the 4th or 5th cycle...

You could say I locked them in while writing around Chapter 25. (\*Of course, not the core theme. The core theme was there from the moment this became an infinite-regression story...)

And if you ask, ""Then what did you mean when you said you prepared it four years ago?""...

What I had back then was the worldbuilding that would form the skeleton of A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation.

Various other settings.

The idea of a protagonist who wields a transparent sword.

The narrative of a protagonist who never gives up and, with a kind of madness, reaches a single goal.

But that protagonist was not 'Seo Eun-hyun'.

I think the first time the world of A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation and the protagonist Seo Eun-hyun really got decided as cores of the worldbuilding that would unfold those ideas was...when he beheaded Makli Hyun.

And it was probably when he awakened through his disciples and showed you Endless Mountains Beyond Mountains that the worldbuilding was finally confirmed for good.

""Ah, this is going to work, I can tell. If it's this story, if it's this guy as the protagonist, he can reach the end. In worldbuilding this, I should pour in all the settings I've created, the cast, the growth route I planned for the protagonist...everything.""

And what was completed was the world of A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation.

The original worldbuilding I'd made wasn't something created for any one specific story.

Some of the settings were even things I'd intended to use in a completely different work.

But once I finally had a protagonist who looked like he would never break all the way to the end...

I realized Seo Eun-hyun could shoulder all of these settings and stories.

So I started taking the settings I'd meant to use in other stories and grafting them into the existing world, sticking them on, building the logic to make it all hold together...

And that's why I went on hiatus a lot in the early days.

Early readers will know this: before the series went paid, my release schedule was a total wreck, and I went on week-long breaks, then just dumped chapters on weekends...it was a mess.

Even now, if you look back at the early Munpia release schedule, you can see how chaotic it was.

Part of it is that I'm an avoidant type of person, and I used to be lazy before I got into the groove.

But the reason the schedule was that disastrous was because, at that time, I was doing a massive amount of worldbuilding readjustment and creating the internal story logic.

\*Of course, the April 1st break wasn't an April Fools' joke. My father really did drag me off to Gangwon Province to dig up potatoes, and dragged me all the way out to a potato field at the far end of Gangwon, so I had no choice.

Maybe that's why I ended up writing those scenes where, instead of just leaving potatoes as a small symbol of kindness, I forcibly stuffed them down Hong Fan's throat...maybe that was my grudge showing.

Honestly, because of that potato-digging trip, A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation could have been discontinued right there.

Thinking about it again, even I find it ridiculous...

Potatoes are delicious, but that memory is dizzying.

I'd taken the whole week off to align the settings and finish the big plot structure, planning to do a release spree on the weekend—then got hauled off to dig potatoes on that very weekend.

If, at that time, the readers had gotten angry and dropped the series, A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation would really have ended right there...

I can only be deeply grateful to those who didn't get angry and didn't remove it from their favorites during the potato-digging incident.

In any case, after that, the lesson ""Right now. This very moment. I don't need some vague hope that might or might not come in the future"" really got carved \[to the bone\] into my heart.

If you drag your feet, you'll be too late.

In the future, you never know when you'll get dragged off to a potato field, or dragged off somewhere else.

I learned very clearly that going on hiatus while making excuses like ""I'll do a release spree later"" can be unbelievably dangerous, and that let me build a supporting theme that completes the main core them.

Anyway, one way or another...

It's true that the early stages of A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation had settings that were very different from now, and much to be completed taking those early breaks.

Of course, the idea that the final boss would be related to a black snake, and that this black snake would follow the protagonist from the beginning and finally awaken as the final boss in the end—that narrative itself has been there ever since the fairy tale's appearance.

You could say the major plot of A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation was almost entirely planned out by around the 6th cycle.

The core theme was there from the very start as well (I'm the type who believes a full-length novel absolutely needs a central theme...though if it's not that long, I do think the story itself can be enough on its own).

The worldbuilding was all settled around chapter 25,

And the plot was more than 80 percent finished before chapter 50 (before the 6th cycle).

But when it comes to character arcs...

Things really, really changed a lot along the way.

Most notably, Salt Sea was changed in the 17th cycle to be the same person as Cheongmun Ryeong.

And the Great Mountain Supreme Deity and Silver Basket were originally the same person.

Silver Basket, who was the Creator God of another world, couldn't stand watching the self-torturing acts of the final boss of the world A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation and that suffocating behavior of trying to run away from the answer, so he was going to invade the world, take the Seat of the Mountain, give advice to Seo Eun-hyun, then pass the seat of the mountain on to Seo Eun-hyun...

I think he was loosely set up as a character that was basically Salt Sea + Great Mountain + Silver Basket mashed into one.

But I thought the Great Mountain Supreme Deity should have an impact as big as his name sounds, so to give him that impact, I went with a development where he completely wipes out the protagonist's party and twisted it into a narrative of conflict between senior brother and junior brother.

So originally, the latter half of the True Immortal Realm wasn't going to be separated from the Audience Chamber arc, and Heuk Sa was supposed to show up as the final boss.

But I ended up splitting it off from the Audience Chamber arc and made the Great Mountain Supreme Deity the final boss of the True Immortal Realm arc.

Also, Heuk Sa was originally actually the same person as the Heavenly Punishment Supreme Deity,

He was also planned to have far less presence than he does now.

The ending I had in mind was that he'd drag himself along in a pathetic, ugly way like Yuan Li, and then be defeated by the protagonist's group.

But after the 6th cycle, I just didn't want to write a final boss who was only pitiful and ugly.

And just as I'd given several character endings that, even to me, felt beautiful...

I worried the story's ending would become too crude, so I borrowed the strength of many characters and completely revised the finale.

If I'd gone with the original idea, then probably...

The ending of the story would have turned out far more vulgar.

Even thinking back on it now, the current ending is much better.

Really...

I think it was a good story.

Calling it a 'dragon's head and a dragon's tail' feels a bit too much, even to me...

It feels more like the head of an imoogi, the body of a snake, and only at the very end did it finally grow a dragon's tail.

Something like mangdu-sache-yongmi (蟒頭蛇體龍尾/python's head, snake's body, dragon's tail) is probably exactly the level A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation sits at.

But well...

In the end, isn't the ending what matters most in a work?

It's a bit awkward to say this with my own mouth, but.

Even I think that for the ending...at least for the ending, I poured my heart and blood into it.

Staying up countless nights, feeling my lifespan get shaved away by coffee and iced americanos with extra shots, unable to even eat three meals a day like a proper human, losing any sense of day or night and just going ""uhhh, ughhh"" while writing in a daze.

Even I think...

It was hard to run all the way here.

And I managed to bring the ending out just the way I'd first envisioned it.

As for the foreshadowing I laid out, I only scattered what I could handle, so I think I picked up almost everything that needed picking up.

If there are any foreshadowing that still haven't been resolved, they'll either be dealt with in the afterword stories, or, if they never get resolved, you can think of them as ""there's a setting like this too""—details that were just there to explain the world.

You can think of them as not even being MacGuffins, not even proper foreshadowing.

Oh, of course, there are real MacGuffins like Old Man Eom of Cheongnan Library, but well...

\[TL/N: Eomcheongnan means Tremendous.\]

What work in this world doesn't have a MacGuffin anyway?

But taking all of that into account,

Even I think!

The ending of A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation turned out well!

Huaaaaaaaah!!!

And!!!

I also know very well that none of this was achieved by my strength alone.

Even if I was the one who observed the story,

It was Munpia who helped me tell the world what I observed!

And Raon E&M, who signed a contract with me!

I want to thank Seong-in Hyung, who gave me the very first contact in the form of an ultra-long, incredibly sincere message, and who kept persistently leaving comments on that contact post so that the contract offer notification would keep popping up for me.

You may be at Munpia now, but the title of 'my first ever editor in charge' is yours, Hyung.

In my heart, you'll always be my number one editor.

And CEO Lee Jae-hwan, who has now founded the company Storywave, gave me so many pieces of advice back when he was a division director at Raon E&M—words that were truly like gold and jade.

I think the reason so many people were able to come to A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation through Series might well be thanks to the advice he gave me about the cover.

And on the webtoon side as well, the CEO really ran all over the place and did *so* many things behind the scenes that I think that's why the webtoon could turn out this well.

In my opinion, when it comes to webnovels, the person with the best eye for them is probably the CEO.

I am truly grateful.

I also want to offer very deep thanks to Director Kwak Seong-yong, who became the second editor in charge of A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation. I can only feel sorry for all the times I delayed turning in the manuscript because I was trying to increase the length.

Thank you for staying with me over that long year and a half, accompanying me all the way to the ending of A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation, for handling the webtoon adaptation so well, and for teaching me so many of the things I was curious about.

I'll of course greet the three of you properly in person, but I'd like to bow my head once more here in advance.

Thank you so much for everything up to now.

And I'd also like to send words of support to Artist Kim Moo-hyun of Haksan Publishing, who is now beginning the webtoon serialization. Once again, thank you for preparing such a wonderful webtoon for nearly two years...and then finally setting it off with a bang.

Every time you drew an episode of the first cycle, you always sent the draft to Raon for checking—that loving care you showed makes me at a loss for how to even express my thanks.

All I can say is that I did my utmost with the original story so that, even if only a few parts are adapted, you can still reach a satisfying conclusion, and I hope that can return at least a small part of my gratitude.

And besides them,

PD Kim Ki-hyun of Munpia.

Back when A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation first got contacted, you were one of the final two competitors along with Seong-in Hyung, so I want to say thank you for always loving A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation that much.

Also, the person who bought me meals the most (including all management, across the board) was PD Kim Ki-hyun, so whenever I think of Munpia now, PD Kim's image is the first thing that comes to mind.

Going forward as well, I'll be in your care for the next work.

In addition to them, Raon E&M's CEO, Author Song Hyun-woo, and many other editors and staff.

Munpia CEO Son Je-ho, the Munpia martial arts-fantasy team lead and division head, and even the part lead who handed me a business card at the neighboring seat yesterday—thank you all so much.

And to the person in charge of uploading to Series, though we've never met even once, my thanks to you as well.

To all the many people who had a hard time because of me every time, I offer my deepest thanks.

To illustrator mucuzi, who drew the first cover and illustrations.

To illustrator Seril (세릴), who drew the second and third covers and illustrations.

To illustrator failose, who drew the character illustrations.

To all of you, I bow my head in gratitude.

The illustrators helped immensely in conveying the images of the characters of A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation to the readers.

And lastly, illustrator failose (실패배), really...

I want to thank you for gifting me with an unbelievable quantity of absolutely incredible fanart.

True to your nickname, you're the Taenghwa Heavenly Venerable.

Thank you.

Beyond those illustrators, countless other illustrators drew fanart of the characters of A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation.

I can only be so, so, so thankful that you chose to display such golden-handed skill here, on this work...

I have nothing I can dare offer all of you except the words: Thank you so much.""

No matter how much a writer is the one who observes the story and brings the tale into reality...

The number one reason A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation was able to come this far is because the readers were there.

I was able to serialize it because there was a platform.

I was able to monetize it because of the management.

And I think it became known because of the illustrators and the golden hands of so many people.

Thank you, and thank you again.

Thanks to everyone, A Regressor's Tale of Cultivation was able to come into the world.

Thank you.

And with the 25-year commemorative Tremendous author-avatar comic drawn by illustrator failose, I'll offer my thanks and bring this to a close.

Someday, a few epilogues and side stories will go up.

And we'll meet again—also someday, perhaps—in the next work that might come.

The first time was with a signature. Ink bled into paper. A name curled itself into permanence. Somewhere far away, a process began humming like a quiet machine with no off switch. He felt nothing then. Relief, maybe. The sterile relief of a job closed.

The second time came later, when the man knocked.

Not pounded. Knocked. Civil. Almost apologetic.

He did not answer at first. He stood in the kitchen, holding a glass he had forgotten to fill, counting breaths he did not need to count. The knock repeated. Same rhythm. Same restraint. Whoever stood on the other side knew patience and how to weaponize it.

When he opened the door, the man smiled with the lower half of his face only.

“You look disappointed,” the man said. “Everyone does.”

“You’re dead,” he replied.

“So are you,” the man said gently, and stepped inside.

This was not how hauntings were supposed to work. No rattling chains. No cold drafts. No remorse dripping from the walls. The man wore a creased gray coat and smelled faintly of antiseptic and rain. He took in the apartment with an appraiser’s eye, cataloging guilt by square footage.

“You signed my exit,” the man continued. “You know the clause. Once the wheel turns, it keeps turning.”

“I can fix it,” he said. A reflex. The lie leapt out fully clothed.

The man laughed. It was a brief sound, aborted, as if laughter itself had learned better. “Everyone says that too.”

They sat. Coffee appeared. He could not remember making it. The man drank without fear. Dead men, it turned out, were reckless with heat.

“You were thorough,” the man said. “That’s why they liked you. Clean hands. Clean conscience. You never asked where the people went, only whether the forms were complete.”

“I saved lives,” he said.

“Statistically,” the man agreed. “Individually, you erased us. We became rounding errors with biographies.”

The room contracted. The walls leaned in like eavesdroppers. He felt something return to him then. Not guilt. Recognition.

“You’re here for revenge,” he said.

“No,” the man replied. “Revenge is linear. This is recursive.”

The word rang. Recursive. A snake devouring its logic.

The man placed a small object on the table. Curved. Wooden. Smooth with use.

“A boomerang,” he said. “From my son. He loved physics. Action, reaction. Throw it right and it comes home.”

“I don’t understand.”

“You will.”

The man stood. The air thickened, as if memory had mass. “I was told you were careful. Ethical. I was told you believed in systems.”

“I do,” he said. Too quickly.

“Good,” the man said. “Then you’ll appreciate the elegance.”

The man left. No smoke. No fanfare. Just absence, like a sentence cut short by a censor who knew where to strike.

The next morning, the news broke wrong.

Names misaligned with faces. Dates slid. Causes contradicted themselves. A woman declared alive sued her own estate. A man pronounced dead applied for a mortgage. The system hiccupped. Then convulsed.

He watched it spread from his desk, from his screen, from the secure network that had once felt like a cathedral. Flags bloomed red. Audits screamed. The algorithms, his proud children, began feeding on their own assumptions.

He tried to intervene. Overrides failed. Permissions rebounded. Every fix snapped back with interest, correcting him instead. He deleted a line of code. It reappeared elsewhere, annotated in his own voice.

Recursive.

At noon, security arrived. Polite. Apologetic. They escorted him out of the building he had helped design to keep people out.

“You authorized the initial parameters,” they said. “The cascade traces to your credentials.”

“That’s impossible.”

“It’s inevitable,” the guard said, and did not smile.

At home, the boomerang waited on the table.

He picked it up. It was warm. He threw it across the room in frustration, a childish, useless act. It vanished midair.

A moment later, it struck him between the shoulders.

Pain flared. Breath fled. He collapsed, laughing and choking at once. Blood spotted the floor in small, precise commas.

The phone rang.

He crawled. Answered.

The man’s voice flowed through the line, rich with static. “You see now. The system did exactly what it was built to do. It optimized. It corrected. It came back.”

“You broke it,” he gasped.

“No,” the man said. “I aimed it.”

Silence followed. Not empty silence. Weighted silence. The kind that waits.

As darkness crept in, he understood the final cruelty. There would be no villain to prosecute, no ghost to banish. Only processes, faithfully executing intent long after intent had fled.

His last thought was not fear.

It was admiration.

The boomerang, after all, never misses.

1pkgt88,https://www.reddit.com/r/SevSide7/comments/1pkgt88/5_grounding_techniques_that_actually_help_when/,5 Grounding Techniques That Actually Help When Anxiety Takes Over,"Hey everyone,



I wanted to share something that's helped me tremendously during my healing journey. We all know that feeling when anxiety hits out of nowhere - your heart races, your thoughts spiral, and you feel completely disconnected from reality. Over the years, I've learned that grounding techniques can be absolute lifesavers in these moments.



These aren't just random tips I found online. These are techniques I've personally used during panic attacks, flashbacks, and those overwhelming moments when trauma tries to pull me under. I hope they help you too.



\*\*1. The 5-4-3-2-1 Sensory Technique\*\*



This is my go-to when I'm spiraling. It forces your brain to focus on the present moment instead of the anxiety.



\- \*\*5 things you can SEE\*\*: Look around and name them out loud or in your head. ""I see my blue coffee mug, the tree outside my window, my phone, the crack in the ceiling, my shoes.""

\- \*\*4 things you can TOUCH\*\*: Actually touch them. Feel the texture of your jeans, the cool surface of your desk, the softness of your hair, the smooth screen of your phone.

\- \*\*3 things you can HEAR\*\*: Close your eyes if it helps. The hum of the refrigerator, cars passing outside, your own breathing.

\- \*\*2 things you can SMELL\*\*: This one's tricky sometimes. Your shirt, hand lotion, coffee, even just the air.

\- \*\*1 thing you can TASTE\*\*: Drink some water, chew gum, or just notice the taste in your mouth.



The beauty of this technique is that it completely interrupts the anxiety spiral. Your brain can't focus on catastrophic thoughts AND sensory details at the same time.



\*\*2. Cold Water Shock (The Dive Reflex)\*\*



This sounds weird, but it's backed by science. When you're in fight-or-flight mode, your body needs a physiological reset.



\- Splash ice-cold water on your face

\- Hold an ice cube in your hand

\- Run cold water over your wrists

\- If you're really overwhelmed, take a cold shower



The cold triggers something called the ""dive reflex"" - it actually slows your heart rate and calms your nervous system. I keep a bowl of ice water in my freezer for emergencies. It sounds dramatic, but it works when nothing else does.



\*\*3. The 4-7-8 Breathing Method\*\*



When we're anxious, we breathe shallow and fast, which makes everything worse. This technique forces you to breathe properly:



\- Breathe IN through your nose for 4 seconds

\- HOLD your breath for 7 seconds

\- Breathe OUT through your mouth for 8 seconds

\- Repeat 4-5 times



The long exhale is key - it activates your parasympathetic nervous system (the ""rest and digest"" system). I was skeptical about breathing exercises for years, but this one genuinely works. Sometimes I do it in public and no one even notices.



\*\*4. Physical Grounding Through Movement\*\*



Sometimes you need to move the anxiety OUT of your body:



\- Stomp your feet on the ground (really feel the floor)

\- Squeeze and release your fists 10 times

\- Do wall push-ups or jumping jacks

\- Stretch your body - reach for the ceiling, touch your toes

\- Dance aggressively to loud music (my personal favorite)



Trauma gets trapped in our bodies. Moving helps release it. I've cried during stretching sessions before because my body was finally letting go of tension I didn't even know I was holding.



\*\*5. The ""Safe Place"" Visualization\*\*



When reality feels too overwhelming, your mind needs somewhere safe to go:



\- Close your eyes and picture a place where you feel completely safe (real or imaginary)

\- Engage all your senses: What do you see? Hear? Smell? Feel?

\- Spend 2-3 minutes there in your mind

\- Describe it out loud if you're alone



Mine is a cabin by a lake at sunset. I can see the orange sky reflected on the water, hear birds chirping, feel the warm breeze. I've ""gone there"" hundreds of times when panic attacks hit. Your brain doesn't fully know the difference between imagination and reality - use that to your advantage.



\*\*Important Reminders:\*\*



✨ These techniques work BETTER with practice. Try them when you're calm so your brain remembers them during crisis.



✨ Not every technique works for everyone. That's okay. Find YOUR favorites.



✨ Grounding techniques are tools, not cures. They help you survive the moment, but healing takes time and often professional support.



✨ Be patient with yourself. Some days these will work perfectly. Other days they won't. That doesn't mean YOU failed.



Trauma recovery isn't linear. Some days you'll use all five techniques. Other days you won't need any. Both are okay. You're doing better than you think you are.



What grounding techniques work for you? I'd love to hear what helps others in this community. We're all learning together.

It’s not rejection. It’s not approval. It’s this weird vacuum where all your optimism goes to die.

For years I treated that line like a checkpoint.
I’d end the call feeling good, pour a coffee, crack my knuckles, and start building some masterpiece of a document nobody explicitly asked for.
Hours of formatting, rewriting, polishing… like the buyer was waiting breathlessly for my PDF to land in their inbox.

But the part that burns into my memory isn’t the writing.
It’s the way I used to sit there afterward — refreshing my inbox like a dog staring at the door, convinced someone was about to walk in.

I’d blame the proposal.
Too long? Too short? Did I sound desperate? Too technical? Not technical enough?
Then I’d blame the buyer.
Why can’t they just say no? Why vanish?

It took me an embarrassingly long time to understand the thing every experienced seller knows deep down:
the deal was never real.
I was talking to someone who enjoyed the conversation but wasn’t close to a decision.
And “send me a proposal” was just the politest possible exit from a meeting they didn’t want to fight me on.

The ones who actually buy don’t end with homework for you.
They drag people into the room.
They ask who signs.
They talk about deadlines and consequences.
They create motion.

“Send me a proposal” creates… nothing.

The worst instance?
A guy sounded genuinely thrilled, borderline emotional about our solution.
I stayed up half the night writing the doc.
Sent it at 8:03 a.m.
By noon I’d refreshed my inbox so many times my laptop fan sounded like it was going to take off.

Two weeks later I understood his enthusiasm wasn’t about buying anything.
It was about ending the call without disappointing me.

There’s a kind of professional heartbreak that only happens once — the moment you realize you weren’t ghosted at all.
You just insisted on believing a deal was alive because you needed it to be.

These days, when someone asks for a proposal, I don’t celebrate.
I say, “What actually happens on your side after you read it?”

I love spending time outside, good food, and creative / intellectual activities. I go to a figure drawing class every now and then, and enjoy meditating. I love having my dog with me, and due to her being a puppy, I haven't been leaving her home alone.

Any suggestions for community spaces that encourage or allow dogs?

I enjoy restaurants / bars such as Potchke, Fin-Two, Bida Saigon, Remedy Coffee, and Tern Club (yes, I am usually pretty boring and routine driven). I frequent Central Cinema, McKays, and Lost and Found Records. I tend to stay Knoxville bound, visiting Seven Islands, Big Ridge, the Smokies, and the Ocoee. I spend a lot of time at the park.

That is pretty much my whole spiel, and I appreciate any suggestions towards places that I could hang out with my dog. We have been bearing the cold, but she is a whippet and pretty intolerant of this weather! Thank you.

EDIT: I see that one of the most popular recent posts in this sub was regarding dogs in public. PLEASE only suggest spaces that are truly dog friendly. I don't like to have my dog around food or in cramped spaces like stores. I am also a secret cat person ;) I have been annoyed by inconsiderate dog owners in public and do not want to perpetuate that stereotype, haha!

How do I move forward from here?,"Hello, This is my first time posting on Reddit and I have a lot of context to get through so stick with me. I, Tyler (23M), and my girlfriend, Grace (22F), have been dating for almost 3 years and living together for almost 1 year. (names are changed for privacy) .This will be long so TLDR will be at the end if you want to scroll all the way down. However, This story requires the context so I would encourage you to read through. Some context that will come back up throughout the story is that I work a 3rd shift job that is very mentally taxing due to the workplace and nature of the work. Grace works a 1st shift job that is physically taxing and mentally taxing due to the workplace being toxic.

Last Night me and my girlfriend Grace had one of the biggest and definitely loudest argument that we have ever had that ended with me having an emotional breakdown where I was crying and losing it a little. The main reasons for the argument are doing chores around the apartment and overall stress on the relationship.

To start, when Me and Grace moved in together we agreed on assigned chores for each other and what we expected from each other living together. My assigned chores: Dinner, Dishes, Trash, and overall pickup. Should be noted that as part of Dinner and Dishes I end up doing all of the kitchen area cleanup/pickup as well. Grace's assigned chores: Laundry, Vacuum/Mop Floors and overall pickup. This is imbalanced from the beginning but I volunteered to do the dishes and trash because when Grace lived alone and I would come over; Her dishes stacked up so much mold began to grow on things, and trash sat so long without getting taken out that small gnats/flies were producing and flying around the trash can. I was worried about these habits before moving in together but I figured If I handled these specific tasks it would be ok. I volunteered to handle dinner because I knew she wouldn't want to or be able to cook after getting home from work and I liked and knew how to cook more things than here.

The first month or two went fairly smooth and we were doing what we each agreed to do. Grace wouldn't pick up a thing here or there but I didn't mind because It took 5 seconds to clean or throw away. But as time passed and we lived together longer Grace began to neglect her chores and not picking up after herself became a more frequent occurrence. Again I wouldn't really say anything about not picking up because I still didn't mind and I wasn't perfect about it either even though I did eventually have to pickup after myself because if I didn't do it then it wouldn't happen. I would mention the floors and laundry not being done here and there but never a serious conversation about it because Grace was always tired and stressed from work and a conversation would lead to what she doesn't like that I do and her crying and having a breakdown. However, recently Grace doing her chores has become a bigger issue and that's partially because she really wasn't doing them but also partially because my patience over time has grown thinner.

The reason my patience had grown thinner isn't just time it's because that while Grace had been doing her chores less often. I have been doing more chores and extra things. On top of making or buying dinner almost every night (Grace would cook dinner once or once every other week) I also started making Grace breakfast in the mornings after I would get home from work. I volunteered to do this at the time because Grace was getting breakfast/coffee at McDonald's every morning or really most of the time I was buying it for her or us. I realized how much money that is over an extended period of time so I presented options for Grace to do at home and she wasn't keen on anything that didn't have to be cooked. I volunteered to do this because I felt it was a supportive thing to do, I liked cooking and I was saving her and me money. I also was vacuuming when it got bad and she wasn't doing it and cleaning the toilets when I noticed they were dirty. I realize that a lot of these things I volunteered to do but I was doing it for what I thought were the right reasons. And again I know I should have had more conversations with her but I was worried about her mental health and her feeling like I was micro managing her and constantly nagging.

Now as I said recently Grace's issues with neglecting her chores and not picking up after herself has become a bigger issue and there is a primary reason for that. For the past 4-5 months maybe longer she has been playing Minecraft online on a server against other people but recently she started talking to people while playing through Discord and the Discord for the Minecraft server. This has led to what I see as an unhealthy obsession. Grace comes home and takes a bath/shower and immediately gets on the game, when she lays down to go to bed she stays in the voice call and watches people stream their game on discord. And when she first started talking to people she ruined her sleep schedule by staying up till 5 am gaming which she said was ok because it was the weekend but then on the weekdays she still stayed up till 2-3 am gaming when she needed to wake up at 6-7 am. I recognized that she was having fun and even though we weren't interacting almost at all I understood that it was most likely a temporary obsession. There were some tense moments where she thought I was upset about it but we talked it through and the obsession did resolve over the next week or two she was still playing it and talking to people every day. This new obsession is what I believe made her already bad habits with chores even worse.

The last bit of context I want to add is that a different primary stressor that has been in Grace's and I's relationship even before we moved in together was the Work Shift difference between her and I. When we first started dating and for the first year and a half we were both on first shift. But when I was going to finish my degree I had to find a ""field-study"" (co-op, apprenticeship) In my field as a requirement to graduate. The only job I could find was on 3rd shift so therefore I took it and switched to 3rd shift. This was fine at first but It has caused issues throughout our relationship here and there and Grace has asked me to find a 1st shift job a few times now and I do want to get off of 3rd shift. The problem is that as we all know the job market is currently awful and I've applied to 100+ jobs but haven't even gotten an interview or meaningful reply back. It doesn't help that my field limits my options and I'm only living slightly above paycheck to paycheck and can't afford to not work for even a month. Therefore my only options are to try and get a job that I have personal hang-ups about that would require some lifestyle changes, or stay with my current job and keep applying for jobs.

**So with all of this context we can get into the Fight itself last night and the current situation.** A few days ago I was looking for a shirt and opened the washer/dryer to try and find it. When I opened the washer there were clothes in there that were damp and smelled really bad and I asked Grace how long they had been there. She said something around a couple of day's or something to that effect and I was annoyed but I was getting ready for work and dropped it. 20-30 minutes later I was leaving for work and I grabbed the trash out of the can and went to leave, she was playing Minecraft talking to people and I tried to get her attention multiple times so I could say bye like we usually do, but she was in the middle of a game and didn't notice so I left without saying bye. That night turned out pretty bad for me: late for work, super busy at work, didn't get to say bye, etc. So I texted Grace and told her we needed to have a conversation about chores and doing stuff around the apartment. She doesn't reply and I come home from work to her still gaming at 5 am, it was the weekend but a week or so after we had our conversation about the gaming. On top of this, we had gone grocery shopping that day and I put away the frozen or refrigerated stuff and left the dry stuff on the counter and the trash can had no bag in it because I took it out when I left for work, when I came home the groceries were still on the counter and she couldn't put a bag in the trash can for me either. I go to the spare room and close the door, she goes to the bedroom and sleeps for a few hours. When she wakes up she says ""lets talk"", I do my best to calm down and we have what I feel like is a productive, healthy conversation when she understands where I'm coming from and says she will be better. The day after: leaves a granola bar wrapper and a small piece of it on the coffee table, I throw it away and just snicker to myself. 2nd day after: she leaves her dinner plate with food on it on the coffee table, I throw it away and tell her about the granola wrapper and dinner plate in a half joking away and she understands and laughs about it. 3rd day after: I go to do a small load of my laundry that I need for stuff I wear frequently, I open the washer and their are damp clothes in the washer that smell bad and now I'm pissed. I text her while she's at work that I'm upset and we can talk about it later but that I hope she still has a good day and that I love her. She says I have every right to be upset and apologizes and we leave it there. That day I end up sleeping late and when I wake up she Is gaming and talking to someone. I give it 15-20 min and then ask if she can mute and I try to start the conversation, she mostly blows me off and then goes back to talking to them. I am frustrated/pissed and start half throwing dishes around that were drying and go to the spare room. She comes in and says ""do you hate me"" and from there we get into talking and it starts ok but it escalates when she starts to blame me for things I don't do and it turns into a yelling match. Admittedly, while she yelled first I definitely yelled more and louder. It ends and I go to the spare room and start crying, I never cry, and she comes in and tries to console me which kinda helps but also makes me more upset because she's who I'm upset at but I do love her and just want everything to be ok. I then start half-yelling half-crying and have an emotional breakdown. I then have to go to work and we say bye and that we love each other and I go to work. I come home the next morning, she gets up earlier than usual because she's going to work early and gets herself breakfast. When I wake up I have a text from her that, ""she's not doing ok mentally, she's taking a break and staying at her dads, she's not happy with the conversation or how she was spoken to, and she knows I'm not doing ok mentally but she can't be my support system right now"". Mind you during my breakdown I literally said I feel like I'm everybody's rock mental health wise and nobody is my rock.

Some quick additional context is that Yes, I am dealing with a lot outside of my relationship issues as well. My mom has had a lot of physical health struggles over the past few years that almost cost her life and is now having mental health struggles. My dad has been struggling with mental health for a while but only alludes to it and him and my sister have cut each other off so I am his main support system. There is also a current ordeal with my little half-brother and his mom (different moms) trying to get custody of him after not having custody for 5 years.

My main Issue now is that I feel like I want to be done with this relationship, but I still love her and love the memories we have together. And she does have so many good qualities that are rare and I'm worried I wont find someone with those qualities again. We live together and still have 4 months on the lease. And while this may sound arrogant I know that her being with me has stabilized her financially and mental health wise and I'm worried if I end it she wont recover. And she has helped my mental health in a lot of ways and helped me become a better person in a lot of ways as well. I just don't know how I can be with someone and think about building a future with them when In a time of personal crisis they leave and say, ""they can't be my support system"".

So that's mostly all of it, I know that was a lot, Thank you to anyone who reads this and can offer me advice. I just don't know how I should move forward from here.

**TLDR: Me and my Girlfriend got into a fight about chores after recent issues. She saw me have an emotional breakdown and the next day went to her parent's and said ""she can't be my support system"". How do I move forward.**",0,1765507596.0,relationships,3,0.33,False
1pkgmn4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AtlasBookClub/comments/1pkgmn4/forget_looksmaxxing_heres_how_to_get_disgustingly/,Forget looksmaxxing. Here’s how to get “disgustingly educated” instead (science-based brain glow-up guide),"A pattern I’ve been seeing lately: Gen Z is obsessed with glow-ups, but exclusively physical ones. Scrolling through TikTok, you’ll find 5-inches-taller shoe hacks, jawline exercises, “looksmaxxing” tutorials, and jaw-dropping “ugly to hot” transformations. But almost no one’s talking about intellectual glow-ups. When did it become cool to prioritize bone structure over brain structure?

This isn’t a call-out post. It’s not your fault. We live in a social media culture that trains us to chase surface-level upgrades. The algorithm rewards aesthetics, not intellect. But the truth is, your level of education is what makes you actually powerful, desirable, and respected.

I’ve gone down a bunch of research rabbit holes, watched the smartest YouTubers, read deep books, and listened to top psychology pods. And no, the answer isn’t a new skincare routine or going viral for a hot gym pic. If you want real status. Real confidence. Real agency. You need to read more. Grow sharper. Think clearer. Learning is the real flex, and I’ve compiled the best ways to start your intellectual glow-up in 2025 and beyond.

Here’s your ultimate guide to becoming “disgustingly educated” (yes, even if school bored you to death).

---

- **First, understand why self-education is your biggest unlock**
  - *A 2016 Pew Research study* found that adults who engage in continuous self-learning report higher confidence, income levels, and social status. Not school. Self-education.
  - *Harvard Business Review* points out that the job market increasingly values “learning agility” which is your ability to absorb and apply new knowledge fast over degrees.
  - According to *The Brookings Institute*, individuals who read regularly and engage with deep material show greater long-term cognitive resilience, especially in digital attention economies.

So yeah, no one’s coming to teach you. But if you learn how to teach yourself, you instantly become more powerful than 99% of people chasing superficial upgrades.

---

- **Best books for immediate brain glow-up**  
  These aren’t dusty textbooks. These are wildly entertaining, research-backed, and life-altering. Each one rewires how you think.

  - **The Art of Thinking Clearly by Rolf Dobelli**  
    Over 3 million copies sold. A global bestseller that breaks down the dumb logical traps you fall into every day (yes, even if you're smart). Dobelli’s background in cognitive science makes every page hit hard. This book will make you spot BS instantly, including your own.

  - **Wanting: The Power of Mimetic Desire in Everyday Life by Luke Burgis**  
    This book will make you question everything you think you want. Based on René Girard’s theory of mimetic desire, Burgis explains why your goals might not even be yours. Endorsed by psychology researchers and startup founders alike. Insanely good read if you’ve ever felt lost or directionless.

  - **Range by David Epstein**  
    Subtitled “Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World.” Epstein demolished the myth that you have to niche down early to succeed. Backed by case studies from Nobel laureates to athletes. Will make you feel smarter just by understanding it. Genuinely the best book I’ve ever read about intellectual versatility.

---

- **Apps that boost your learning speed & retention (no, not Blinkist)**
  - **Readwise**  
    This app connects to your Kindle, Instapaper, Twitter, articles, tweets, and lets you resurface old highlights in spaced repetition-style emails. It's like building a second brain without realizing it. Retention cheat code.

  - **BeFreed**  
    An AI-powered learning app built by a team from Columbia University and ex-Google engineers. BeFreed generates personalized audio podcasts and adaptive learning plans based on your goals whether you're trying to improve social intelligence or master a niche topic. You can customize the length and depth of each episode (from 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives) and even choose the voice that suits your vibe (sarcastic, soothing, etc). Content is pulled from high-quality sources like research papers, expert interviews, and best-selling books. 

    It basically replaces doomscrolling with structured, science-backed knowledge. No brainer for any lifelong learner. Just use it and thank me.

  - **Tana or Notion (with AI add-ons)**  
    If you're into organizing thoughts, both of these apps let you build a knowledge system with tags, backlinks, and logic flows. Add AI bots like gpt-4 inside to summarize your journal or generate insights from your notes. Learning becomes interactive.

  - **Speechify**  
    For ADHD brains or people who hate reading: Speechify turns any document, article, or PDF into an audiobook with humanlike voices. Makes commuting or gym time 10x more productive. A favorite hack among med students and lawyers who have to read fast.

---

- **Podcasts that’ll make your brain feel like it went to grad school**
  - **Modern Wisdom (Chris Williamson)**  
    He interviews PhDs, athletes, philosophers, and billionaires on everything from dating psychology to AI ethics to masculinity. Somehow makes you feel smarter without being boring. His episodes on attention and dopamine cycles are must-listens.

  - **Big Think**  
    Bite-sized interviews with global experts. Topics range from cognitive bias to futureproofing your skillset. Feels like TED Talks with less fluff. Especially helpful for people who like deep ideas in short time.

  - **The Huberman Lab Podcast**  
    Stanford neuroscientist Andrew Huberman breaks down the biology of focus, motivation, and learning. Backed by citations, but somehow still digestible. Episodes like ""How to Learn Faster"" and ""Rewiring Dopamine"" should be required listening.

---

- **YouTube channels that actually teach you to think better**
  - **Ali Abdaal**  
    Former doctor turned productivity nerd. His videos give you systems for learning, memory hacks, and how to make studying suck less. His “evidence-based study techniques” series is gold.

  - **Veritasium**  
    Run by physicist Derek Muller. Explains paradoxes and scientific truths in a way that blows your mind. Each video feels like a mini documentary. Perfect for curious minds who want critical thinking with fun visuals.

  - **Tom Nicholas**  
    Breaks down philosophy, economics, and cultural theory using real-world pop culture examples. Watched his breakdown of late-stage capitalism using Squid Game references and haven’t stopped thinking about it since.

---

- **Bonus: building a habit that sticks**
  - Don’t aim to “read more.” Trick your brain: aim to open a book every day for 5 minutes. That’s it. Once the book is open, you’ll likely keep going.
  - Use the *“cue, craving, response, reward”* habit loop from James Clear’s Atomic Habits. For example:
    - Cue: morning coffee.
    - Craving: dopamine hit from story or insight.
    - Response: read 3 pages.
    - Reward: feel smarter before 10am.
  - Stack reading with something habitual. Ex: read while stretching, eating, or waiting for your subway. Brains love routines.

---

Real talk, the hottest people I know? Aren’t the tallest. They’re the ones who walk into a room and start referencing a podcast that changed their worldview or a book that made them switch careers. They don’t chase clout. They chase clarity. And people are drawn to that.

1pkgl86,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1pkgl86/husband_unemployed/,Husband unemployed,"My husband (27) and I (28) have been together for 8 years. We met right after high school and with 2 months dating we started living together, both bc of family issues. Right at that time both of us would receive money from our parents, he would do some design freelancing jobs and I used to babysit, we paid the bills together (since the beginning we had joined accounts) and I would do most of the house work, everything I ask him he does but he’s not the type of person that see something and do it from his own mind (besides things like taking out the trash or putting the plates on the sink, basic stuff only). We moved together to the city I was born in (where I grow up) lived a bit with a family member, they started fighting and he went to spent some time with his family (2 years of relationship and both still working as freelancers / studing), we stayed 3/4 months apart and then I got a pretty good job that would give me a fixed income so he came back and we rented an apartment, after that we lived normally we had our issue like house cleaning divisions but nothing serious, after Covid my area got pretty well paid and I started receiving a lot of money, then he stopped working because he didn’t wanted to work overtime (he did around 50/60h per week) cause artists are treated really bad and get bad payment. After that he started “helping” more at home but I felt like he would compare yourselves too much as if my high paid salary would make his time not worth working for a bad payment company, he starts having less sex, he started gaining weight and he used to LOVE sports. We stayed like this for + 2y, then my job required me to do a 2 month training (to improve my English) and during that time I could pay for stuff for him so he got a job payed off his stuff, I stayed +1 month there and I got very depressed there, I was sad that I didn’t had his company and when some girls from work would ask me to go out and someone would hit on me or compliment me I would get super ashamed and he said that he didn’t cared, and even if I wanted an open relationship if that would make me happy he would, but I never wanted that, I wanted to feel loved, desired and appreciated by him. So I spent most of my time there studying, working. When I got back my salary went even higher and we moved to a bigger house, I started to feel super overwhelmed because I was working and doing most of the cleaning (we got 1 person to help), I have no idea what he did for this past 3 years, he said he studied, I paid for the best mentorship’s on the area, then he said he wanted to start doing miniatures to print and sell, I bought the 3d printing and all, it got left in a corner for 1 year he said it was too problematic and too hard to setup. After 4 years of this I said I wanted to move to a smaller place (like a 2 bed apartment) cause I was not able to jiggle all my day tasks anymore, our days we do stuff together (watch movies, play) but barely have sex, we travel a lot too. So we bought the apartment, I did basically the whole renovation by myself, from choosing stuff, to going there to buy, hiring contractors etc
When I complain about it he always say he didn’t wanted to renovate but the place had mold, infiltration and all the wood was eaten up. Me and his cousin cleaned up entirely by ourselves 1 day before moving he was here but cleaned like 1 window and washed 1 bathroom while we were moving things, removing the renovation left overs. I had a big discussion, saying I couldn’t take this anymore, and kind of gave him an ultimatum. He said he was feeling lost and depressed, I asked him to do therapy he did for a while (like 3,4 months), I bought a new 3d printer, he started using and putting his ideas to paper. Now it’s been around 3 months that he had the initial idea, didn’t finished that one, we ended up buying patreon to paint and sell, he prepare and do all the printing and I paint everything, so now I have 2 jobs. He says he was more ideias, but sometimes he says it’s not the time bc he needs more money, the market I work in is really bad right now I’m afraid to loose my job, my manager is horrible and harasses me (mentally) daily, I cry every day, he says quit and we can loan money from the bank and declare bankruptcy, but I’ve worked so hard for 7 fucking years, I don’t want to take the “easy” route. So now I don’t know what to do, he was starting to have health issues like high colesterol, diabetes, and the doctor prescribed him medication for loosing weight. But he doesn’t workout or eat healthy, and now we’re hitting the 8 years mark, he doesn’t complain, he doesn’t fight, sometimes I even question myself if I’m just the type of person that is unhappy with everything, he treats me nice, sometimes he brings me coffee while I’m on meetings we have fun together, he keeps saying he wants to have kids, but we don’t have sex, I don’t feel like he’s helping over the house and I’m exhausted of keeping up all the bills by myself.",3,1765507363.0,Marriage,6,1.0,False

Hey Maximizers! 👋

Been thinking a lot lately about what truly makes a difference in feeling not just *okay*, but genuinely *great* – both in terms of how much we get done and how much we *enjoy* doing it. It's not about drastic overhauls, but about those little, consistent shifts.

Here's what I've found to be my ""secret sauce"" lately. It’s less about a magic bullet and more about building a robust, joyful foundation:

*   **The Power of the ""Micro-Win""**: Instead of aiming for massive achievements that can feel overwhelming, I focus on tiny, achievable wins throughout the day. Waking up 15 minutes earlier? Done. Drinking a full glass of water before coffee? Nailed it. Reading one page of a book? Check. These small victories build momentum and a sense of accomplishment that fuels bigger things.

*   **Mindful Movement, Not Just Exercise**: It’s not always about hitting the gym hard. Sometimes, it’s a 10-minute walk outside, stretching while the kettle boils, or dancing to a favorite song for a few minutes. It’s about *connecting* with your body and releasing that pent-up energy, which has a huge impact on mental clarity and mood.

*   **The ""Three Good Things"" Reflection**: Before bed, I jot down (or just mentally note) three things that went well that day, no matter how small. It could be a funny conversation, a delicious meal, or even just a moment of quiet. This rewires your brain to actively look for the positive, which is a game-changer for overall happiness.

*   **Intentional Downtime**: This is HUGE for productivity. Instead of endlessly scrolling, I schedule short bursts of *actual* rest. A 15-minute meditation, listening to a podcast with my eyes closed, or just staring out the window. It’s not laziness; it’s essential for recharging and preventing burnout.

*   **Embracing Imperfection**: This one's a toughie, but so freeing. Realizing that not everything needs to be perfect. Sometimes ""good enough"" is truly enough. This frees up so much mental energy that was previously spent on striving for an unattainable ideal.

These aren't earth-shattering revelations, but applying them consistently has made a remarkable difference for me. It’s about being intentional with our time and energy, and recognizing that joy and productivity aren't mutually exclusive – they actually fuel each other.

1pkggy6,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Puzzled_Dirt7674/comments/1pkggy6/soldier_roll/,Soldier Roll," The Soldier Roll
At Warhorse we were limited to things to do with our evening when everything was going well, no incoming, no mass casualties to contend with and clean up afterward. We did have some forms of internment, Green Beans coffee shop (so much better than Starbucks) maybe the gym if you were into that kind of thing but at that time, I was more interested in the fresh baked goods at the DFAC than anything else.
Our PAX Terminal (passenger terminal) was unique because it used to be an old Airport for Saddam’s kids Uday and Qusay with runways, a large hanger and other buildings you would find at any another dictator’s spoiled children’s private airport.
During the early days of the FOB the PAX was nothing more than a Military green canvas tent with plywood floors, a counter with military and civilians working as flight OPS to show your CDC card too and sign in or out dependent on your coming or goings, chairs of various types either repurposed from the DFAC (stolen) and assortment of canvas folding chairs that someone tossed out or left behind during a RIP/TOA (relief in place/transfer of authority) or even rescued from a dumpster by a recreational dumpster diver looking for treasure of DVD’s, porn in any venue, backpacks and other useful items to make life just a little more bearable. It should have been an Olympic sport I would have been a contender in. Let’s see we got just a little off track there, oh yea, there was always a TV with a never- ending supply of Haji bootleg movies donated by people that could stay for hours or even days in this tent if they became orphaned during transient movement from one FOB to the other of which happened often, believe me. You would walk into this oasis of air conditioning and sign in, weigh your bags and then yourself before being told to get comfortable, water is in the refrigerator or freezer because they were rarely frozen from the constant traffic through the PAX. The Golden rule throughout Iraq was take one out replace it with a room temp bottle for the next guy or gal. If no water was inside the tent, then you would march out to the pallet or two outside of the T-Walls that surrounded the place. You would grab one or two packs of water and bring them back inside to start cooling off and perhaps find favor with the PAX personal and not get bumped from your flight, snacks were sometimes provided and maybe a box
of MRE’s that were heavenly picked over because all the bags had been opened and the Skittles, vegetable crackers, peanut butter and jalapeno cheese was missing, no joy there boys and girls.
Now out of sheer boredom and just a little sadistic thinking the Soldier Roll was introduced, but I’ll have to admit we witnessed many civilians caught up in the same plight. OK so let’s lay it out for you. The Soldier Roll was introduced to us by our HR manager at Warhorse who was introduced to it by an ARMY gal that worked at the PAX terminal. The tarmac was about one hundred feet behind the tent with a neat line of four-foot-
tall barriers spaced out on the edge of the tarmac in the rocks. Everyone loved the ankle turning, knee twisting PAX
Terminal rocks. Some were small but as always, the larger softball size rocks would work themselves to the top creating a hazard at night because ninety present of all flights were at night which that exacerbated the situation by not having the ability to use a white light to see the rocks, you could only use a red or blue because we were a black out FOB and snipers loved the beacon of a white light that was like a lighthouse to guide the way. Even driving at night, we could only use our parking lights at night and over time it became natural to us. You learned the

 roads and every potholes, curves and other obstacles on the FOB.
Meanwhile at the flight line the outgoing personal have had their twenty-minute warning to start lining up into two lines per aircraft of up to sixteen plus for a CH-47 Chinook if everyone was disembarking the aircraft or less if this was a milk run which meant the personal on bord were going to other locations in Iraq. Now the smaller UH-60A/L Blackhawk could have as many as twelve passengers not counting the crew of four so it could be very cramped inside and once your buckled in with a four point harness all of the bags are now thrown on top of your legs and if its winter the doors shut, summer they are left open so now you are also task with keeping baggage from falling out of the aircraft and littering the Iraqi country side with your stuff or someone else’s stuff. Can you just imagine sitting there in you Jesus hut, (Iraqi mud hut) when a duffel bag full of khakis and dirty underwear or a samsonite suitcase full of porn and dirty underwear comes crashing through your roof killing your goat. Inshalla indeed. But most times the upper ranks were placed into them and given a little more space.
Now the game is a foot as everyone is lined up carrying bags and luggage, over stuffed backpacks with cute little stuffed creatures attached, full battle rattle (helmet, ballistic vest with attachments like clip holders (real men carried eight hundred rounds), a variety of weapons but usually just M-Fours an M- Sixteen as well as sidearm. As you can guess they are extremely top heavy at this point and for many of them this is there first time being so close to a flightline like this in a combat zone and that inexperience coupled with the wake of rotor wash is well quit a show. Now the plot thickens, just imagine me rubbing my hands together saying boo ha ha in a menacing voice, thank you.
Now here we stand waiting for the first hint of the distinctive sound of the Chinook or Blackhawk aircraft as they make their

 final approach into Warhorse. Everyone is standing in the dark with little flashes of red or blue light as someone here someone there has forgotten their earplugs or securing equipment or that cute little stuffed Camal they got at the Bx attached to their already overstuffed seventy-pound backpack for the flight. Now very faintly you hear the rotors beating the air into submission as they slowly but not too slowly glide in a path to the tarmac, one escorting Blackhawk followed by two Chinooks with a Blackhawk following are silhouetted against the star filled sky, if you look directly at them, they seem to just disappear into the blackness of the night. As they come closer to the tarmac you start seeing a beautiful phenomenon as the dust is kicked up by the rotors and is recirculate back into the rotors causing the tips to start glowing in an eerie neon green light that is in a perfect circle that allows you to track the tillite of the roto blades, it’s just crazy. Now they have finished there decent and now are flying level toward us at maybe ten to twelve foot off the tarmac and the personal to our left waiting to board are transfixed but the almost overwhelming sound, the building wind and heat from the turbine and the smell of burnt fuel exhaust as we all begin to feel the first strong burst of rotor wash that is rappel increasing. It’s at this point the HR guy, while transfixed by the glowing rotors has starts slapping us on the chest shouting watch them, watch them!
It’s at this point the lead Blackhawk and second Chinook have glided by us, and the second Chinook is now landing almost in front of the line to our left. Its rotors are now fully engaged an catching air to force it downward in an ever increasing force outward as the air has no other place to go but lateral away from it and creating a huge surge of rotor wash outward causing a human domino affect with the top heavy soldier in front being hit with a wall of concentrated air are unable to keep their feet and are toppled over into the person behind them, some try to catch the person in front of them as they fall only to be bragged

 downward by the wind and unexpected wight and precarious way there backpacks shift on the person in front as they fall. Some try to turn away only to be off balance themselves and with the help of the larger rocks are pulled to the ground by that nasty bitch called gravity.
Oh, the concoffne of shouts and cursing in more than one language could be heard over the turbines and rotors only a little over seventy or eighty foot away with the back of the turbine on our side glowing a dull red on the exhaust end. With the helicopters now settled into place with its rotors still turning fast but now engaged into a neutral position and now throttle back abruptly stops the assault of air and overwhelming sound on the personal even now trying to gain there feet once again. The back ramp of the Chinook which was retracted half way up during the landing phase is now lowered to revile were the tail gunner sat straddling a M249 SAW belt feed machinegun with his legs hanging over the ramp while in flight only secured with a safety harness to the interior of the craft. He nonchalantly steps out and stretches his back before motioning to the personal seated inside to rise, gather there bags now stacked down the middle of the craft with bench seats on both sides and make their way out of the back of the aircraft being carful of the SAW and the almost two foot stepdown, the personal from the PAX terminal are now approaching to help the new comers toward the PAX for processing into the FOB. As for us the fun and memories of the Soldier Roll is almost over. We see a few facies from the glow of the interior of the craft and bid them a farewell as we recognize Soldiers we have seen around camp for the passed year or in the DFAC at Christmas or Thanks Giving but for myself it was a few that I had worked with over the countless body’s in the Aid Station and seeing the MAN or WOMEN now that was only a young Medic just twelve months ago and incident to war.
As we walk away and as the helicopters throttle up and rise into the blackness and the neon green fades away, we are again in darkness and silence other than the never ending sound or the dozens of diesel generators. Time for Green Beans and maybe a muffin?
Below are just notes and revisions and the last part, my rambling can be cut.
runway from its days as a small private airport ed inside
the flight crew full drops the rear door that up unto now was were the tail gunner was sitting with there M249 SAW now with its belt out and hood open, inert for now.
All around us everyone are struggling to gain there feet as there heavy burden and gravity try’s to pull then back down, words of discus in more than one language. At this point we spring into action to help people back to their feet as the helicopter unload there replacements and cargo. And that’ the Soldier Roll. 
Fin.


But I do remember one thing we would do for entertainment during times when troop movement was heavy out of our PAX Terminal (passenger terminal)

How do I move forward from here?,"Hello, This is my first time posting on Reddit and I have a lot of context to get through so stick with me. I, Tyler (23M), and my girlfriend, Grace (22F), have been dating for almost 3 years and living together for almost 1 year. (names are changed for privacy) .This will be long so TLDR will be at the end if you want to scroll all the way down. However, This story requires the context so I would encourage you to read through. Some context that will come back up throughout the story is that I work a 3rd shift job that is very mentally taxing due to the workplace and nature of the work. Grace works a 1st shift job that is physically taxing and mentally taxing due to the workplace being toxic.

Last Night me and my girlfriend Grace had one of the biggest and definitely loudest argument that we have ever had that ended with me having an emotional breakdown where I was crying and losing it a little. The main reasons for the argument are doing chores around the apartment and overall stress on the relationship.

To start, when Me and Grace moved in together we agreed on assigned chores for each other and what we expected from each other living together. My assigned chores: Dinner, Dishes, Trash, and overall pickup. Should be noted that as part of Dinner and Dishes I end up doing all of the kitchen area cleanup/pickup as well. Grace's assigned chores: Laundry, Vacuum/Mop Floors and overall pickup. This is imbalanced from the beginning but I volunteered to do the dishes and trash because when Grace lived alone and I would come over; Her dishes stacked up so much mold began to grow on things, and trash sat so long without getting taken out that small gnats/flies were producing and flying around the trash can. I was worried about these habits before moving in together but I figured If I handled these specific tasks it would be ok. I volunteered to handle dinner because I knew she wouldn't want to or be able to cook after getting home from work and I liked and knew how to cook more things than here.

The first month or two went fairly smooth and we were doing what we each agreed to do. Grace wouldn't pick up a thing here or there but I didn't mind because It took 5 seconds to clean or throw away. But as time passed and we lived together longer Grace began to neglect her chores and not picking up after herself became a more frequent occurrence. Again I wouldn't really say anything about not picking up because I still didn't mind and I wasn't perfect about it either even though I did eventually have to pickup after myself because if I didn't do it then it wouldn't happen. I would mention the floors and laundry not being done here and there but never a serious conversation about it because Grace was always tired and stressed from work and a conversation would lead to what she doesn't like that I do and her crying and having a breakdown. However, recently Grace doing her chores has become a bigger issue and that's partially because she really wasn't doing them but also partially because my patience over time has grown thinner.

The reason my patience had grown thinner isn't just time it's because that while Grace had been doing her chores less often. I have been doing more chores and extra things. On top of making or buying dinner almost every night (Grace would cook dinner once or once every other week) I also started making Grace breakfast in the mornings after I would get home from work. I volunteered to do this at the time because Grace was getting breakfast/coffee at McDonald's every morning or really most of the time I was buying it for her or us. I realized how much money that is over an extended period of time so I presented options for Grace to do at home and she wasn't keen on anything that didn't have to be cooked. I volunteered to do this because I felt it was a supportive thing to do, I liked cooking and I was saving her and me money. I also was vacuuming when it got bad and she wasn't doing it and cleaning the toilets when I noticed they were dirty. I realize that a lot of these things I volunteered to do but I was doing it for what I thought were the right reasons. And again I know I should have had more conversations with her but I was worried about her mental health and her feeling like I was micro managing her and constantly nagging.

Now as I said recently Grace's issues with neglecting her chores and not picking up after herself has become a bigger issue and there is a primary reason for that. For the past 4-5 months maybe longer she has been playing Minecraft online on a server against other people but recently she started talking to people while playing through Discord and the Discord for the Minecraft server. This has led to what I see as an unhealthy obsession. Grace comes home and takes a bath/shower and immediately gets on the game, when she lays down to go to bed she stays in the voice call and watches people stream their game on discord. And when she first started talking to people she ruined her sleep schedule by staying up till 5 am gaming which she said was ok because it was the weekend but then on the weekdays she still stayed up till 2-3 am gaming when she needed to wake up at 6-7 am. I recognized that she was having fun and even though we weren't interacting almost at all I understood that it was most likely a temporary obsession. There were some tense moments where she thought I was upset about it but we talked it through and the obsession did resolve over the next week or two she was still playing it and talking to people every day. This new obsession is what I believe made her already bad habits with chores even worse.

The last bit of context I want to add is that a different primary stressor that has been in Grace's and I's relationship even before we moved in together was the Work Shift difference between her and I. When we first started dating and for the first year and a half we were both on first shift. But when I was going to finish my degree I had to find a ""field-study"" (co-op, apprenticeship) In my field as a requirement to graduate. The only job I could find was on 3rd shift so therefore I took it and switched to 3rd shift. This was fine at first but It has caused issues throughout our relationship here and there and Grace has asked me to find a 1st shift job a few times now and I do want to get off of 3rd shift. The problem is that as we all know the job market is currently awful and I've applied to 100+ jobs but haven't even gotten an interview or meaningful reply back. It doesn't help that my field limits my options and I'm only living slightly above paycheck to paycheck and can't afford to not work for even a month. Therefore my only options are to try and get a job that I have personal hang-ups about that would require some lifestyle changes, or stay with my current job and keep applying for jobs.

**So with all of this context we can get into the Fight itself last night and the current situation.** A few days ago I was looking for a shirt and opened the washer/dryer to try and find it. When I opened the washer there were clothes in there that were damp and smelled really bad and I asked Grace how long they had been there. She said something around a couple of day's or something to that effect and I was annoyed but I was getting ready for work and dropped it. 20-30 minutes later I was leaving for work and I grabbed the trash out of the can and went to leave, she was playing Minecraft talking to people and I tried to get her attention multiple times so I could say bye like we usually do, but she was in the middle of a game and didn't notice so I left without saying bye. That night turned out pretty bad for me: late for work, super busy at work, didn't get to say bye, etc. So I texted Grace and told her we needed to have a conversation about chores and doing stuff around the apartment. She doesn't reply and I come home from work to her still gaming at 5 am, it was the weekend but a week or so after we had our conversation about the gaming. On top of this, we had gone grocery shopping that day and I put away the frozen or refrigerated stuff and left the dry stuff on the counter and the trash can had no bag in it because I took it out when I left for work, when I came home the groceries were still on the counter and she couldn't put a bag in the trash can for me either. I go to the spare room and close the door, she goes to the bedroom and sleeps for a few hours. When she wakes up she says ""lets talk"", I do my best to calm down and we have what I feel like is a productive, healthy conversation when she understands where I'm coming from and says she will be better. The day after: leaves a granola bar wrapper and a small piece of it on the coffee table, I throw it away and just snicker to myself. 2nd day after: she leaves her dinner plate with food on it on the coffee table, I throw it away and tell her about the granola wrapper and dinner plate in a half joking away and she understands and laughs about it. 3rd day after: I go to do a small load of my laundry that I need for stuff I wear frequently, I open the washer and their are damp clothes in the washer that smell bad and now I'm pissed. I text her while she's at work that I'm upset and we can talk about it later but that I hope she still has a good day and that I love her. She says I have every right to be upset and apologizes and we leave it there. That day I end up sleeping late and when I wake up she Is gaming and talking to someone. I give it 15-20 min and then ask if she can mute and I try to start the conversation, she mostly blows me off and then goes back to talking to them. I am frustrated/pissed and start half throwing dishes around that were drying and go to the spare room. She comes in and says ""do you hate me"" and from there we get into talking and it starts ok but it escalates when she starts to blame me for things I don't do and it turns into a yelling match. Admittedly, while she yelled first I definitely yelled more and louder. It ends and I go to the spare room and start crying, I never cry, and she comes in and tries to console me which kinda helps but also makes me more upset because she's who I'm upset at but I do love her and just want everything to be ok. I then start half-yelling half-crying and have an emotional breakdown. I then have to go to work and we say bye and that we love each other and I go to work. I come home the next morning, she gets up earlier than usual because she's going to work early and gets herself breakfast. When I wake up I have a text from her that, ""she's not doing ok mentally, she's taking a break and staying at her dads, she's not happy with the conversation or how she was spoken to, and she knows I'm not doing ok mentally but she can't be my support system right now"". Mind you during my breakdown I literally said I feel like I'm everybody's rock mental health wise and nobody is my rock.

Some quick additional context is that Yes, I am dealing with a lot outside of my relationship issues as well. My mom has had a lot of physical health struggles over the past few years that almost cost her life and is now having mental health struggles. My dad has been struggling with mental health for a while but only alludes to it and him and my sister have cut each other off so I am his main support system. There is also a current ordeal with my little half-brother and his mom (different moms) trying to get custody of him after not having custody for 5 years.

My main Issue now is that I feel like I want to be done with this relationship, but I still love her and love the memories we have together. And she does have so many good qualities that are rare and I'm worried I wont find someone with those qualities again. We live together and still have 4 months on the lease. And while this may sound arrogant I know that her being with me has stabilized her financially and mental health wise and I'm worried if I end it she wont recover. And she has helped my mental health in a lot of ways and helped me become a better person in a lot of ways as well. I just don't know how I can be with someone and think about building a future with them when In a time of personal crisis they leave and say, ""they can't be my support system"".

At the risk of being vulnerable, I’m a part owner of the Botanical in Bentonville. I think it’s safe to say it’s been a rough year in all industries and ours is no different. If you’ve ever come by our spot near heroes coffee I’d love to know - what can we do better? What’s missing? What would make you want to come back (or in)? We took a pretty beat up building and poured our love into restoring it and it’s now a very green, lush space that shows sports, has international beer, wine and sake-based cocktails (as well as domestic beer and wine offerings). 

But anyway. It’s been a gloomy winter. Feel free to be brutally honest; I want to know how we can win business as a local bar.

Nasasayangan kasi ako na itapon.,"Hello, this is a PSA, and while it's already known to most, some beginners really have no idea about this like I did.

But please, I can never EVER recommend buying the Dutche Special cocoa powder for yoyr baked goods, eveb for beginners. I've tried so many recipes for brownies and crinkles na yun ang gamit ko, pero lahat fail. Hindi ko talaga magustuhan; kahit na itweak ko with premium ingredients yung kasama sa recipe, hindi pa rin masarap. Biruin mo, kahit legit tablea or 60% dark chocolates from Davao ang gamitin ko eh nahihila pa rin niya pababa ang quality ng finished product.

I had a hunch na baka flour lang talaga ito with a bit of cocoa powder kaya nung gumawa ako ng crinkles today for another trial batch, i did not put flour at all. At ayun nga, kahit na i used Chef RV's recipe, hindi ko na-achieve yung wet dough nung nagstart ako sa wet ingredients with the ""cocoa powder"". Doon pa lang naisip ko na hindi na lagyan ng flour at all yung recipe.  So I did, and yet hindi pa rin naging medyo runny ang consistency niya. I added coffee diluted in water pa nga, plus vanilla just to put some moisture pa, and more oil. Pero wala talaga. 

Now, since i started baking, i bought a kilo of this and I still have one pack of 500g. I am not so comfortable to just throw  away lalo't nanghihinayang (worse, actually, nasasaktan talaga) ako at galing din naman yun sa capital ko na pinagipunan ko kasi wala naman akong work lately. Pero kung wala na talagang solusyon para salbahin ang cocoa powder na ito, i guess itatapon ko nalang talaga. Heartbreaking, but I will take it as a lesson learned to ALWAYS check the brand/label (and that i should not to be so emotional about things like this!)

Please, for beginners out there, never settle for the mumurahin. I'd rather go with the one with purple packaging if Dutche din naman. Mas mahal pero i have tested it before with my first brownies and okay naman siya. I just thought nung una, na it was the same, iba lang packaging kaya mas mura that's why i bought it.

TL:DR
I will never recommend Dutche Special Cocoa Powder kahit sa beginners pa yan. Nasayang yung binili oong isang kilo at hindi ko alam ang gagawin sa stock ko. 💔 Meron bang recipe na magandang pag gamitan ko nito? ",1,1765506942.0,BakingPhilippines,0,1.0,False

1pkgesx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdultBedwetting/comments/1pkgesx/very_new_to_this_corner_of_the_world_and/,Very new to this corner of the world and wondering about how to handle my current situation.,"I'm a 35F and I've wet my bed twice, almost three times, in the past month or two. I'm not sure how seriously I should be taking it and what my options are so here I am. My apologies for the lengthy post, I'm being overly thorough to get the best advice and anecdotal similar experiences to pull from.

Some background:

\- After it happened twice in one week, I asked my mom if I ever had bed wetting issues as a kid. She said I did and that she took me to our doctor who told her I just have a small bladder. I have zero recollection of any of this and guess I must have been on the younger side like under 6 or 7 at the time.

\- I was molested at 5 which I hear can be a contributing factor. My parents did not know this until a few years ago.

\- I have had urgency issues since my teen years that seem to get worse during certain times in my cycle. I think it relates to the cervix lowering during certain cycle phases + a very weak pelvic floor. I will randomly get intense urges to pee even if I peed 15 minutes ago and there's barely anything there. If I try to ignore the urge as fake I'll leak. This historically has happened during the day though, not at night.

\- The urgency issues grew far worse when I started drinking in college. I still notice it at it's worst when I drink during certain cycle phases. As an adult I've taken to outdoor peeing in my city because I often cannot make it home from the bar or my friends house even if I go right before I leave. If I make it home, getting to the toilet is a difficult race against myself. Sometimes there's not a ton of liquid, other times it's a waterfall.

\- I've had two friends now tell me I have a violent pee stream (lol)

Outside of the childhood bed wetting I don't remember, the first time it happened was in 2018. I was 28 and in bed with my partner & woke up around 5AM confused and covered in piss. I was embarrassed but woke him up and he was very chill about it and made it a non thing which helped a lot. I chalked it up to a random occurrence. It didn't happen again until the twice in one week occurrence a couple months ago.

Both times it was around 5-6AM. Both times I vividly recall peeing in my dream and waking up from the dream mid pee. This morning it nearly happened again around 5AM. I was on the toilet in my dream about to let go when I got anxious about needing to remove a tampon first. I woke up while trying to stop myself from peeing in the dream and was able to get to the toilet with wet underwear but dry sheets.

I have very little stress in my life so i don't think it's from that. I did recently stop smoking marijuana daily for the first time in 16 years which led to my dreams returning and a slight increase in alcohol intake. I do drink coffee daily but not usually after 1-2PM. I can cut back on the alcohol some but not the coffee, it's what I use and need to function instead of ADHD meds (diagnosed in 2019). My bladder gave me less issues when I was at my peak fitness level back in 2020-2022. I'm working on getting back into fitness and hope the stronger core helps again.

So! With all that in mind, what is this community's opinion of my situation? Is this something I can try and get a handle of on my own or should I not hold off on seeing a doctor? Will I end up having meds pushed on me or told I should start wearing diapers? I don't yet feel that's necessary with only two recent occurrences and one recent scare but I see it's a common solution for people here. I don't feel ashamed about the prospect but would still \*really\* like to avoid that if possible due to cost and added responsibilities to my routine.  Thanks so much for your time and patience with my story today!",2,1765506858.0,AdultBedwetting,1,1.0,False

She really likes the beans at Bourgeois Pig and Headrush. I was thinking adding The Roasterie to the gift bag too, because it seems to be a pretty big KC stable.

Normally she’ll get a medium roast, but she does switch it up to some fun flavor blends if that’s what the shop is known for. 

Does anyone have ideas on brands, roast recommendation, and the best place to purchase?  If I could pick up the majority from a local grocery store, that would be ideal. I don’t think I’ll be driving to Lawrence just to pick up some coffee beans. ",3,1765506704.0,kansascity,6,1.0,False

1pkgbc7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nonsleep/comments/1pkgbc7/meat_god_egghead_chapter_iii/,MEAT GOD - EGGHEAD: Chapter III,"According to the file, the deceased was a Hawaiian man in his late forties. The medical record of the Saint John’s Clinic, a health center in Wyoming, said that, apart from being a little overweight and at certain risk of heart arrest, due the high level of cholesterol in his blood system, he was a healthy man. The medical record wasn’t old. The last time the deceased had a periodical check, was just three weeks ago. The professional, named Harriet Ramirez, didn’t found anything unusual in the patient’s condition. It was logical to assume no much can change after only three weeks.

The deceased, or the *body*, as the forensics rather refer to dead people in the morgue, was a far from the term “healthy”, as the dictionary would put it. His skin was terrible pale, even for a cadaver. Even worst, a lot of dark blue veins were noticeable at a glance, some of them were varicose.

The old forensic expert, James “Jim” Chung, was alone in his office of the morgue. It was a rainy night and his two colleagues were out, expending those late hours with their wives and sons, probably in bed right now. Most likely, somebody would take the day off tomorrow. Chung didn’t have a wife, or children awaiting for him at home, just Mr. Morrison, his bombay cat (maybe, hidden under bed because of its fear to both, the water and the thunder). Chung was a loner, and even when he had some romances in the past, he was never much interested on such trivialities. He found talking with the cops pleasant, especially with the investigators, for he liked to talk about crimes and soccer. But he liked much more when he was left alone with the bodies. His two colleagues were great experts, even if they still have a few things to learn about the job, but great experts never the less, and they spoke between them just the minimum in the morning, and almost nothing while doing an examination.

Chung knew very well how his two assistants liked to interact with their coworkers, in the police department. They were more talkative with the cops, and even made dirty jokes about their female coworkers, and sometimes they laughed really loud at the coffee shop. But the worst thing, Chung thought, was that looking as bad as some of the dead bodies they store in the containers, they believe they could attract the young ladies’ attention. Really. Two grown-up forensics, with their boring shirts and their yellow brown teeth due to smoking and coffee consumption (and whisky as well). As for Chung himself, he didn’t care about that. What he really cared about, indeed, was the bodies and the well written forensic reports. The jury deserved the only best.

His little brown eyes were moving left to right, registering the written sentences on the deceased’s file about Ryan Anaka, or the “Crazy Hammer” as newspapers call him. No journalist could put her nasty hands over the suspect’s identity just yet. But the TV news reports said something about him being not only delusional, but also a heavy heroine user, and a known alcoholic, and more likely a homeless, as if being a homeless was something bad *per se*. But Chung, even if he found the lies of the press to be pure horse-crap, he thought it was funnier than reading the factual text on the police file.

After three cigarettes, ten pages of the report and a chocolate, doctor Chung decided it was time to give this maniac killer a look. He put on his white coat, his gloves, no need for a mob-cap for he had almost no hair, and went to the bodies storage room.

Anaka was in the compartment number 14, next to rotten skeletal remains of his mother.

Chung opened the refrigerator compartment, moved the body bag to the stainless steel table, and rolled it toward the autopsy room. Next to him, was a little metal table full with medical instruments and metal plates the shape like kidneys. Chung opened the zipper of the gray body bag, and took a long good look to what was left of Anaka’s face.

The forehead was sunken in the left side. The upper part of the skull exploded. Part of the brain was still hanging from the bloody aperture, an intricate mess of broken bones and soft tissue. There were two little holes, one in the frontal bone, right over the bridge of the nose, and another in the frontal maxilla, near the upper incisors. Of course, the terrible damage of the brain was the cause of death. No need of an expert examination to tell.

The first step was cleaning the body

No far, there was a new cassette camcorder, the same TV news people use, aiming at the examination table. The camera has a big microphone that looked like a hairy ball. He checked the cassette compartment, and then turned the camera on.

“Right”, Chung said, without looking at the lens. “This is doctor James Chung, about to examine the rest of Mr. Ryan Anaka, for the Michigan Police Department. It’s August 16^(th), 1975. Anddddd, let’s go.”

*Funny thing*, Chung thought, *you got a taste of your own medicine, right? At least, according to the news.*

The forensic took a few polariods for the Michigan police’s file, and then he picked the scalpel. He made two large incisions under both clavicles, that joined in the center of the chest, and then another one that went all the way down, circling the navel, ending right before the pelvic area. The skin felt a bit odd to the touch of the blade, almost like a jellyfish capsule, making a liquid sound as the forensic was cutting it. The sound of rotten skin. Underneath, the thick layer of fat was of an intense orange. Carefully, Chung folded the skin aside, and centered his attention to layer of muscle, shinny and so pink, not the normal color of healthy muscle mass.

It was rotten flesh.

*But how could this be?*, doctor Chung asked himself. *This man died yesterday, and he’s already one week rotten.*

Chung took a square chunk of Anaka’s white skin for analysis, and then sliced the abdominal wall in two, and opened it like a window frame. He was no sensitive to bad smell, especially those of rotten cadavers. The red intestines, with paths of blue, were all the evidence he needed to say the obvious: The body was as decayed from inside as from outside.

“Ok, now let’s check the chest.”

The doctor picked the costotome, strong steel pliers, to cut the ribs one by one, enjoying the crunching sound they made, even the cartilage connection to the lower ribs. He ended up with a bizarre square of ribs and tender pinkish flesh, and used the connection between the strong *sternocleido-mastoid* muscles of the neck and the *manubrium* bone as a hinge, to gain view of the internal organs.

“Oh, wow!” Chung whispered in surprise. “Mmmm, this…, hummm. What’s this?”

They were like hundreds of little white translucent fibers, going here and there, around the meat ball of the heart, the shinning thick tubes of the vein and arteries, and the black bags of the lungs.

Chung used the tip of a long forceps to touch the fibers. They shined like marble when the light hit them.

“Well…, mmmm, looks like we have some worms. They have infected the heart and the lungs. It’s like a big colony of…”

Chung used the forceps to move aside one of the infected lungs, and with two fingers of his right hand, he moved the heart to take a deeper look. Almost hidden by the dark blood and rotten fluids, there was something that looks like a big tubular root.

“Oh, Jesus! What happens here?”

Chung looked at the camera and back to the body.

He sliced the principal vessels attached to the heart, the big aorta and pulmonary arteries, the superior and inferior cava veins, and extracted the organ. It was hard to see, especially due the pool of dark blood between the meat bags of the lungs, but scattered on almost every organ, there were some tinny white fibers, almost invisible because they were translucent.

Chung used a vacuum to suck out the blood, and that strange root emerged at the deep bottom of the thoracic cavity, well hidden by the lungs and the brown mass of the liver. Mostly, the alien root was milky white and shinny as marble, but when the light hit it, Chung could see some kind of bluish reflections, like stripes under its liquid skin.

“Curious”, Chung said. “There’s some kind of parasite inside his chest. And lots of little maggots, but not of any kind I saw before. Maybe this man was sick, maybe he had some kind of infection. I never saw this.”

He grabbed a piece of paper and cleaned the thing, and he noticed it looked like a big worm. The little white fibers were connected to it, like hundreds of tinny tentacles, or capillaries of the mother root. The body of the thing was divided into segments, like rings, but the thing was more or less shapeless.

“This is strange” Chung said. “Or not. I’m going to collect it, and send it to CDC for further analysis or to a biologist. Okay.”

Chung tried to grab the big worm with the forceps, but it was too thick, slippery and it was firmly attached inside of the cavity, almost like another organ. He sliced some of its filaments or feelers, and went for the thing itself. But when he touched it with the blade, he heard a high pitched shriek, almost a short whistle.

The forensic took two steps back, crashing his lower back against another examination table.

“The hell was that?!”

Before he had time to digest what was happening, the body sat, the heavy mass of its red intestines fell over its legs and the metal table. Chung gasped, as the swift hands of the cadaver took both of his shoulders (its grip, strong and firm as rock), to bring him forward. Despite of the panic induced shot of adrenaline, the doctor could do little to resist the wild force of the rotten arms, which pushed his face closer, deeper into the dim, dank interior of the heartless chest cavity. In a second, Chung felt the soft and putrid flesh of Anaka’s breathless lungs on his face. The pulsating fibers over the bag of the lungs, vibrated when they reached his nose and lips. The gunk coagulated blood lubricated the hole left by the heart. The tubular tip of the white parasite inside Anaka’s chest, got inside Chung’s mouth, muting his moans, moving through his throat, chocking him.

Chung stepped back, crashing again, this time with a cabinet, and some glass jars got broken on the floor, but he didn’t noticed it. He shivered, felling weak for the lack of oxygen, as the thing occupied the whole space of his throat. He tried to puke out the thing in vain, while noticed the hundred or so jelly like fibers sticking out of his mouth, every time his lips touched each other. They felt like little worms, zigzagging over his tongue. He tried spitting them in vain, for they were the feelers of the thing traveling down his esophagus, with less likely good intentions in hands.

He looked at the attacker. The body, it seemed, was dead again, for the torso was lying motionless over the bulk of rotten intestines. Its skull rested hanging in a weird angle, over the gap between its knees.

Chung knelt on the floor, breathing only through his nose trills, dripping tears and grabbing his blocked throat, gasping for air, asking himself what to do next, what he should do next, and if he was going to die right there, in his own morgue. “How convenient!”, as people on the commercials say. His vision became blurry, and he was sure in that moment, that he was done. D*eath awaits me.*

But no, he didn’t die, no in the way he was accustomed to understand and explain death. He felt angry, right, and hungry and horny. He stood again, breathing heavy, not thinking too much, and look at both his hands, and then around, and roared in anger, blood coming out of his mouth, and roaring felt like a good idea.",1,1765506588.0,Nonsleep,0,1.0,False

1pkg8p7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteApartments/comments/1pkg8p7/moving_to_charlotte_nc_advice/,"Moving to Charlotte, NC Advice","When I first moved to Charlotte it was an absolute nightmare. I saw every apartment under the sun and none of them fit what I was looking for. I had no clue where I was looking, where I was going or what a realistic budget was for what I wanted.

When you're touring apartments in Charlotte I'd recommend you have 2 on the low end of your price range, 2 on the middle to high end, and 2 on the extremely high end.

  
I ended up with an apartment that was way more than I originally wanted to pay and I would do that 1000% over again.

  
Charlotte is a city where you NEED to like the neighborhood you are living in or it will be brutal. 

  
If you work in Uptown live close to public transport. It hasn't had the best image in 2025 but I promise you in the mornings it is way better than sitting in traffic and paying out the rear for parking. The Blue Line light rail runs from University City through NoDa, Uptown, South End and LoSo so look for apartments in any of those locations. 

  
I started my budget at $1200 for a one bedroom. I quickly learned that to be near public transport and in a part of town where I could walk to coffee shops, restaurants, and bars that price isn't doable. 

I ended up increasing my budget to $1500 which felt so high at the time. My mindset was I would rather love my apartment and pinch pennies every where else than to hate where I live.

If you are trying to figure out what your budget should be for your first apartment in Charlotte I'd recommend this as a general guideline: 

Studios - $1400+

1 Beds - $1600+

2 Beds - $2300+

  
These prices will go up in the summer and down in the winter by a hundred dollars or so. Sometimes you can find two beds under $2000 in the winter but not in South End.

  
South End Charlotte will be the most expensive so if you are on a tight budget below $1500 I'd recommend you look elsewhere.

  
NoDa is getting more expensive but its a great place to look. 

  
And just an FYI. The newest buildings as of right now tend to be a bit more expensive but also run better specials. This isn't always the case but for the most part.

  
Good luck with your move to Charlotte.

Im currently training to run the NYC half in March - its going to be my first half marathon that I've actually properly trained for (I've run 2 others on a coffee and a dream lol) so I'm really excited! Prior to training I was averaging about 30 miles a week anywhere from a 8min to a 9min pace, so nothing crazy. My only real goal for this is that I desperately want to finish sub 2 hour.

I started my training plan this week and I'm struggling with maintaining the slower paces it wants me to do for my easier runs. Fo context I do not have any sort of fitness watch so I have to intermittently check my phone, but even with doing that I find myself slowing down for a bit but eventually speeding back up to a sub 9min time, which is what I typically run at but I dont want to burn myself out as Im increasing my mileage and keep reading everywhere that I need to take it slow to avoid.

So basically, does anyone have any advice for maintaining slower paces without a fitness watch? Also can someone explain why I need to be doing these runs at such a slow pace/is it going to hurt me over the next 12 weeks if I cant get it under control?",1,1765506250.0,beginnerrunning,5,1.0,False

Hello 👋 I’m a 29 year old that just started working in Manhattan (specifically Bryant park area) but I live in NJ. I work as an attorney and love what I do.

Outside of work I consider myself pretty adventurous. I travel often, either roadtrips (mostly up to New England or upstate NY to my cabin in the Adirondacks) or to a new country/state. I also love to cook, paddleboard, play video games here and there, or just go out and do something. Don’t get me wrong, I LOVE a good night in on the couch with a movie or a good book 🛋️ 

About me physically: I’m mostly white and a 1/4 Hispanic (my Spanish isn’t great…. 😅) 6 ft, and average build. Pics available on request!

I’m looking for someone to enjoy all these activities with. Let’s grab a coffee in the city (or NJ if you live there lol) to break the ice!!",1,1765506211.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

I just need to write down how I'm feeling. How do I go about this?","Apologies for the recency of my account, and the fact that I may delete this post in the future; I made an account purely for the sake of receiving some feedback on this situation. I have also posted this to another subreddit.

My (20F) boyfriend (20M) of two years has been feeling really 'empty' for the past three weeks, and it has unwittingly become a strain on our relationship. I think this depressive period has been motivated by numerous pressures in his life, those being: (i) the prospect of life outside of the 'safety' of university (in terms of employment, friendships, our relationship); (ii) his seasonal affective disorder; (iii) potential depression (he has a history of it in his family), and; (iv) stress/pressures from his family.

For the sake of this post (which I imagine will be a lengthy one), I will divide my submission into subheadings: (i) context; (ii) the situation. I think it will also be helpful to have subheadings within these main headings -- if only for chronology and organisation of the different events.

If you do not wish to read the whole post (I don't blame you), I will provide a  'TL;DR' section at the end of the post in bold. My question is: how do I proceed?

**(i) Context:**

Prior to telling you about this situation, I think it is best that I provide some context. My boyfriend ('B') and I met on a pre-university course and were originally part of a three-person friendship group. When we started university properly we became really close and then developed strong feelings for each other. We are inseparable -- simultaneously best friends and lovers, confidantes, and kindred spirits. He is like my actual second half. In the least cringe-worthy way possible, he completes me.

I have spent so much of my university experience with him that I feel I do not want to complete it without him at my side, in whichever capacity he chooses to be to me (best friend or boyfriend). I would obviously prefer him to be my boyfriend.

We are both in our last year at a very prestigious university studying a very hard course. B has seasonal affective disorder and has been coping with it for most of his life, at least that which he can remember. Essentially, whenever it gets cold, dark, and horrible outside (as it is now -- where we live at least) a deep sadness comes upon him. Usually this manifests only in the form of making him uninterested in going outside when it is dark, or bringing him to tears. It has never made him this upset or confused about the trajectory of his life.

B also has a history of depression in his family -- his brother passed away as a result of it, his father is also struggling with it. Typically when such episodes happen I comfort him, and he manages to cope through it into the sunnier months -- he also says that the Christmas period helps him feel better too.

B is also a very socially anxious person. He finds it really difficult to engage in conversations with people without an existing superstructure in place (like within the setting of school or university) or a known shared interest/attribute (gaming; university student). He is also uninterested in having menial, surface level friendships predicated on polite conversation (for example asking how the weather is, or how one's day has been) he much prefers friendships that are greater than that. As a result, he has not made many friends at university -- well, until very recently.

He seems to be attempting to become closer friends with the people he plays Valorant with on the university team. He calls them 'friends' when in reality he has only known them for three weeks (the duration of this confusion phase) and they do not seem to be interested in engaging with him outside of play-days and the odd online game. Neither do they have those 'more than menial' conversations he desires from friendship. He is the 'game lead' for Valorant (meaning he is responsible for organising teams and throwing social events) and attempts to host social nights for the players. B tried doing so last week but no one was willing to show up because it was coming to the end of the university term, and Valorant was not working in the place that they usually play. Perhaps one thing that has been bothering him is the fact that he might be unable to make friends outside of university.

Another thing that has been really stressing B out is the prospect of his future employment. B wants to work in a highly competitive sector, and has been doing applications for the past few weeks for graduate schemes and other similar things. He is extremely clever, has won awards and the like during his time at university, and has shown great promise in some of his previous applications -- for example by: getting to the end of the application process for a competitive grad scheme, missing out only at the last interview; getting an interview from a big company in his second year which he was told was almost unheard of. I think because he has met so many unemployed recent graduates -- both from our university and others -- he has come to the conclusion that he is not going to get anything this application season and is faced with the prospect of being unemployed and not in university next year. It doesn't help also that his mother has been very forceful about him getting a job next year and about potentially paying rent to live at home, or going off to live somewhere else where there are many other opportunities (unlike in his small town).

Additionally, you should know that B lives at home. His family home is not far from our university, and so he thought it more financially viable to commute into our university city each day instead of paying for accomodation. I had concerns before about how it would impact our relationship, which he shook off. It seems it may have contributed slightly to this situation.

**(ii) The Situation:**

Now that we have established the context, I think I should continue by describing the situation that has prompted me to leave this post. This will essentially be an in-depth run down of what has happened, so you have the benefit of the whole situation. I will try to be as fair as possible in my depiction of the situation, including my own actions no matter how they may make me seem. I suppose this exercise is also just to help me deal with my emotions by writing them down.

After not having seen each other for more than three hours one week my boyfriend mentioned that we should go on a week-long break over text. This was incredibly surprising to me. Sure, we had some unresolved issues in the  communication of our needs, and perhaps one disagreement in the weeks prior, but it was nothing out of the ordinary and we typically talk about things when they come up. B admitted that he did not want to go on break, but felt that he ""needed one"" otherwise ""he wasn't going to stop feeling like this"" -- 'this'  being a general feeling of emptiness. I agreed that it would be best for his sake, but expressed my feelings that this break would be incredibly difficult for me, especially considering that he was in the dark about how he was feeling.

He first mentioned that we would have contact throughout the break, and that it would be for the duration of one week. The next day when I asked when we were to meet following the end of the break, and what amount of contact we could have, he was completely dismissive. Responding with 'maybe' and 'idk', as well as ""please just let me understand how I feel by myself"". I understand that I was slightly bombarding him with flurries of texts, and I know that was not doing much to assist him, but I was in so much confusion and pain, and I couldn't help but feel like I was losing him without knowing what I had done to catalyse this. Eventually we established that we were to meet on the following weekend, perhaps the Saturday. So I endured the week, texting my boyfriend often without response. Sometimes he would read my messages, other times not for days on end. It was extremely hard for me. I had no motivation to do anything, and some of my university work suffered in the process. Later, B mentioned that we could meet on Friday -- he also mentioned, after my questioning, that he was reflecting on ""things generally"" (his life plans, how our relationship will fit into those life plans, and whether he wants it to).

* *Friday:*

When the Friday eventually came we met for a brief lunch before one of my classes. I greeted him with a bouquet of flowers, and lots of tears. I told him that I loved him, and that I was sorry for whatever I had done. He gave me a hug, of his own volition, and said that he loved me back. We spent a brief time together, where I explained that I was willing to change for him -- to go to therapy, to resolve any problem that I had caused. He was not very responsive, just reinforcing the fact that he is reflecting on life generally, that he does not know if our relationship can proceed beyond university (seeing as we live in two different parts of the country) and that he has tended to have an overly optimistic view of the strength of our relationship before.

I mentioned that it might be him coming out of the 'honeymoon phase' extremely late, and that I always thought of him as thinking that (he used to tell me that the only way he would break up with me was if I cheated on him or committed some serious crime). He said that he did not afford himself enough respect, and that he needed some time to himself to figure out what he wanted. I then went to my class, and we later talked more in my room.

We discussed all of the problems that he had with our relationship -- his misconceived belief that I didn't like his friends (which is untrue) and his worries about our religious differences, for example -- all things we have talked about (and resolved) previously. This is what upset me, the fact that (in the grand scope of things) these issues he had were not supremely different from the conversations we have had previously. Sure, I admittedly have some abandonment issues and inabilities to manage my emotions, but I am willing to go therapy for them (where I wasn't before -- he held me tightly in a strong embrace when I said this, and told me he appreciated that greatly).

He also mentioned that he 'feels nothing' about me -- no love, no feelings of any kind apart from the fact that he sees me as a good friend, a 'best friend', even. He told me that he found it hard to sympathise with me. B stated that he was not sure if this relationship was something he wanted anymore. This obviously upset me immensely. He recoiled from all the physical touch I was giving him, and told me that even being with me then made him uncomfortable.

However, he was being very contradictory. He would still touch me at times, especially when I mentioned something that had upset me about the situation and when I broke down into tears. When I gave him a letter I had written detailing how I had felt, he cried on reading it -- explaining that he felt bad that he did not feel anything because he could tell that I had put lots of effort into writing it, and explaining my feelings. When I told him how I naively waited all week to book my graduation ceremony (in the desperate hope that we could do it together), and he later revealed that we had coincidentally booked it at the same time on the same day we both cried in each other's arms at the sheer coincidence of it and the fact that, no matter what happens going forward, we are going to finish this experience together. He also would still call me by the pet-names we call each other. We ended the conversation managing our expectations -- he told me that he was going to spend the following week with me as much as possible as he believed that he could still feel something for me, that his feelings would resurface and that he could make a decision when he had more clarity on how he was feeling. He agreed to stay over with me on Sunday. I asked him to try for me.

He told me that there was no guarantee that he would end up feeling something for me again in the same way that he had before, and I mentioned that it might just be that his love for me is less intense than what it was previously. That I saw ways in which his love manifested, and that I had had a similar experience previously -- that it was natural in relationships for the character of the love you have to change. I asked him if he still felt attracted to me, and he stated that he still finds me 'very pretty'. Also, he acknowledged that the way he felt about our relationship must be how everyone in a university relationship feels at the end of their degree. Moreover, he noted that he didn't 'just want to be somebody' to me, and that he felt that I was just using him for comfort -- when I sought his reassurance that he wasn't going to break up with me over the break.

We also had organised prior plans for me to go to his dad's 60th birthday party in the Christmas vacation, as well as attending a pantomime with his parents on that same week. He mentioned that I could still attend as his date, and that we were still boyfriend/girlfriend despite these recent events.  Additionally, I tend to keep my things round at his house over the vacations, seeing as I have a lot of things and our university does not let us keep our rooms occupied over the break. He let me do this again, despite the ongoing situation.

Going forward, we were going to see how he felt over the Christmas break and whether he would miss me, or appreciate spending time with me at his family events. He told me that he did not want to keep me in this limbo indefinitely. He expressed that he did not want to regret breaking up with me, if that is something that he truly wanted (but he could not tell me now).

* *Saturday*

On Saturday, I did not hear much from B apart from this one conversation we had. He told me, in confidence, that (on reflection) he felt ""as if he was slapped around the face by a wet towel"", and that he has been feeling upset and unhappy about everything -- not just this relationship. He apologised for making me feel so miserable, and mentioned that he would ""try and get back to normal"" as soon as he can. I stated that I would be there to support him, at any time, in any capacity he needs me. He told me that he really appreciates the effort that I am going through for him, and that he sees how much this has (and is) hurting me.

* *Sunday*

Following a short dispute in the morning where I got really anxious he didn't want to come, and so was slightly badgering him about it (which I profusely apologised for later), he came over. He also expressed a lack of interest in seeing me off on Saturday when I was to go home for the vacation, that he would rather go to the football if I did not need him. We established that he would come, and that I wanted him to be with me. We spent the day studying in the library together. He would let me touch him very minimally, a pat on the back or a rubbing of his arm. Anything more was too much. We got dinner together, which he paid for, and watched a film in my room whilst eating. I tried to give him a hug, but he did not want it. We slept in my bed, and he would aggressively refuse any physical contact then.

I also asked him how he was feeling. He said that he lacked the motivation to do anything: between spending time with me, or with his friends from home, it all was equivalent to being face-down in his pillow, lying in bed. I asked him why he could manage to play Valorant all day with his friends, and whether it gave him any escape -- he commented that it required less effort and that he could switch off his brain, and just focus on the screen. It was fun, but it gave him no fulfilment. Nothing did. B stated outrightly that he 'didn't want anything' -- not me, not anything. He also mentioned that I was the only one he talked to about how he was feeling. I gently implored him to get professional help, and he stated that if he continued to feel this way after Christmas that he would get help and probably would drop out of university and delay his exams until next year. Though he mentioned that he believes that, away from the stress of university, when all of his applications are done, and when he can spend time with his family at Christmas, he would start to feel better and might know what he wants.

* *Monday*

Mostly another day spent in the library, however we also went to get breakfast at a restaurant together. I asked him some questions to get some clarity on how he was feeling, and to make him aware of my position. He reinforced the fact that he didn't know how he was feeling about anything, especially about our relationship. I asked him about the future, and told him that I think a lot of how he was feeling was the cause of post-uni stress. He mentioned that I might be right, considering that he started to have a 'heavy chest' when I mentioned that he could be scared of 'what comes next' -- for our relationship, for his employment prospects etc etc. He also mentioned that he still wanted children (a hope we have had for a long time) ""whether with or without me"". I mentioned my plans to spend time with him on Wednesday, seeing how he interacts with his new friends, and wanting to get to know them. He mentioned that he would have more fun without me, but did not want to tell me at first for fear of hurting my feelings.

He was really good at helping me manage my stress as I had an essay due on this Monday which I was anxious about -- even rubbing my back at one time. He would let me keep very minimal contact with him, more than before but not as much as resting my head on his shoulder. I would ask permission to do so also as I realised the importance of giving him space in this time. He went home in the evening. Again, B seemed uninterested in spending time with me on Wednesday (even if his plans with his Valorant friends were to fall through, which he admitted they likely were to). He was completely put-off by the idea.

* *Tuesday*

I did not see B on Tuesday. I had spent time with my friends though, going to a Christmas event with them. B maintained one of the longest message threads/conversations we have had since this whole thing happened. He asked me about the event, and I mentioned that I felt that my friends were less engaging with me due to my lack of energy (seeing as I was tired with two essays on the back-log and a general stress about my relationship), and that they had been making our relationship the subject of conversation for the past two weeks (I had told them about it). I mentioned these odd comments that one of my friends (who I no longer really consider a 'friend') had made about B and I's relationship and how it upset me. For the first in a long time he was able to reassure me and help me manage my feelings -- just listening and providing support, which he has not been able to do for me since this situation first happened. I asked him how he was feeling. He stated that he still feels absolutely nothing, about anything.

Additionally, he mentioned that his gaming plans for Wednesday had fell through and instead wanted to see me for lunch that day as well as for an hour before he got the bus back home.

* *Wednesday*

We had lunch together, going to a sandwich shop we love and go to a lot. Ate in my room, and watched a Youtube video. Later, we caught up and went to a coffee shop together. B let me link arms with him as we walked, even holding hands sometimes. In those times that we would separate, he would extend his arm out or motion for me to link my arm with his. He talked about his plans to go see some in-person Valorant event after exams.

* *Thursday*

We had plans on Thursday for me to spend the night at his family home. That is what I did. I brought some of my stuff over to his house for him to store over the holiday. He picked me up from the bus stop, and helped me carry my stuff. We then watched some TV, and he let me rest my head on his shoulder -- getting uncomfortable only when I tried to touch his hand. His parents were excited to see me, seeing as I had not been round for several weeks (where I ordinarily would go quite often), he hasn't told them about anything. I fear he does not want to disappoint them, or feels that this situation is temporary.

We went out to a local town for dinner, he drove me. We had some nice conversation, and he opened the car doors for me and held my hand on the way to the restaurant. We engaged in some good conversation, and tried each other's food. We even talked about how our relationship might look when we're 50 -- and he didn't seem too uncomfortable with it but he later retconned this, saying that he felt 'weird' talking about it. We went home, got changed into our pajamas and watched some more TV -- where I held his arm slightly.

We then went to bed, and he was okay with me sleeping in his room with him.

* *Friday*

Woke up and took an early bus into the city. We both had separate activities to do for the first half of the day. On the way there we had great conversation, he told me how he was feeling a bit better about next year -- telling me all of the plans that he had in case he did not get a grad scheme. He even mentioned, without my prompting, what future careers our children might be interested in and how we can support them in achieving that. He was comfortable with me resting my hand on his thigh. We also established that we are still doing Christmas presents this year.

Later, we met up and went to a recently opened bookshop in town. We also got lunch at the same sandwich shop, and he let me link arms with him. We had good conversation. Then we went to my room and ate, watching a bit of TV as we did so. He was less comfortable with me touching him on this day. We both had applications to complete, and so we dedicated time to doing that but got sidetracked talking about the future of our relationship and how he has been feeling.

He told me that he thinks I should break up with him, but that he was not going to break up with me. He thinks he has not been treating me with much respect, and thinks that I should have some respect for myself (as a friend). He mentioned that I need to stop doing things for other people, and think about myself. That the world would be better if everyone was a bit more selfish. He thinks he 'might need it' to have clarity on this situation -- that it might push him either way, that it might make him 'feel something'. He also reassured me that if I did break up with him, that it wouldn't preclude the end of the relationship. I mentioned how upset that made me feel, and that I had been considering it (that my family and academic tutor mentioned it to me) but that I concluded that I still wanted to try, and to support him. That I felt that me not being here for him in this potentially depressive state would be me failing him as a partner and that if I could not manage how he was feeling now, that I could not possibly be in a relationship with him prospectively. He told me that it wouldn't necessarily put him off, and that he was sorry for not being clearer with that fact before. He just felt extremely guilty, and sorry for me as a friend.

B also mentioned that he has really enjoyed spending time with me as a friend, and that going to dinner and everything else was purely on a friendship basis for him. He mentioned that it was extremely hard to spend time with me knowing that I love and care for him so deeply and how it made him feel uncomfortable that he did not feel that way, at least now. I mentioned how he so naturally mentioned our prospective kids, and how only a few weeks ago he mentioned wanting to marry me at 23. He started to take back how he felt about our relationship when he knew he loved me -- that he said 'i love you' prematurely and such. This made me really frustrated.

I became really upset, and stressed to him how scared I was for his health. This was as he started mentioning that he was not sure whether he wanted to pursue the career he was applying to jobs for, and that everything was futile. He stated that he wished nobody would care for him, or have any expectations of him, so he could just do whatever he liked. He expressed that he wishes that he controlled some kind of light-switch where he could be in control of when it became dark, and when it was light. He mentioned that he did not know whether he was willing to try hard for those careers he really wanted previously, and whether he would be willing to try and make our relationship work logistically speaking if we were to be long-distance with our careers. He mentioned that he did not want to work as the thing he has wanted for the past few years.

B has been struggling with some oral problems recently also (actually for longer than this confusion period), like the fact that he finds it hard to keep foods down, and feels like he is going to vomit after he brushes his teeth. I mentioned that this could be an anxiety related thing, or related to his feelings of 'emptiness'. He, very worryingly, stated that it could be a form of cancer and that he might have 6 months left to live so he didn't have to worry about careers, university exams, or potential relationship distress and could just live his life. He also changed him mind on whether we can be friends if we did broke up -- which he was never against prior, and he expressed that I was still the only person he could truly be himself with and he did not want to lose it, but that I'll get over the relationship ending. This made me really upset.

He confessed that he needed more space to think things through. I mentioned that after Saturday we would not see each other until his dad's birthday. He agreed that it would be useful. We managed to talk it out further, and I left the room to complete my application. When I returned, he hadn't finished his. I think this was contributing to his stress. I sat with him while he finished, and he asked me to read over it.

We went to get my laundry and I asked him whether the thought of me being with someone else might make him feel something. He told me he had considered it, but he does not know and would have to see it happen before he could give me a concrete answer. Naively thinking that it might make him undergo some 'damascene conversion', I mentioned that it might be useful that I date other people during this period to see whether it would make him uncomfortable. He got really upset by this and asked me why I would say that. I mentioned that it was honestly really hard to not have the support, and affection, I usually have -- to know that my boyfriend did not love me made me feel unloveable. This is one of my greatest insecurities and I am trying to reassure myself that I am capable of being loved. He told me that I should not 'use' people, and I agreed, and regretted that I said it. B also stated that this is what makes him feel like I was just using him as a 'someone' -- which is not true, and I have reassured him so many times that I could never feel this way about anyone other than him. That I would not have put myself through such emotional turmoil if not for the sake of him. This caused a tension for the rest of the night. I reassured him that I was just trying to gauge a reaction out of him naively and he told me that it will take time. He did not want to talk about it again.

Then we went to get dinner, and I walked intentionally very slowly behind, and away from him -- trying to give him his space. He kept looking back for me and slowing down for me to catch up. Eventually he mentioned that he was upset I was doing this, and I confessed that I was trying to give him space. He stated that we were spending the night together and should act like it. So we walked arm-in-arm and went to get our food. On the way, I talked about prospective plans for the week I was going round to his -- about how we should go to this jazz bar he promised to take me to, and he mentioned that he would like that. We also talked about baking, and other such stuff and he seemed happier. Later, we watched some more TV and he placed a soft toy in-between us, but he was basically resting his head on me. Then we went to bed.

* *Saturday*

This was the last day I was to see my boyfriend before the holiday. He woke up before me and got dressed. I woke up, and he asked me how I was doing -- I mentioned that I was upset and was, obviously, going to miss him. He got upset with me for mentioning the situation again, and noted that it would not make him feel any better if we were to go 'on and on' about it. I mentioned that I could not help but to think about it. I had a shower, and got dressed and we watched a youtube video. I started to pack more of my stuff away and there was an overwhelming tension. It did not help that I was stressed about the whole situation, of going home and the prospect of uncertainty as to what was to come. We agreed that we would get something to eat after my mother came to our university town (she was to help me take my stuff). B was generally unresponsive and unhelpful -- he thought there was no purpose in him being there.

I was upset and mentioned in a passing comment that he could just go home, and he expressed an interest in doing so but I later withdrew my offer. He told me that he was only there for my benefit, not his. I asked him if he was uncomfortable that my mum was coming, he said he did not know. We spent most of the time in silence, and he seemed really uncomfortable when I was anywhere near him.

He took some of my stuff with him home and I expressed that I was really grateful that he did so, and that he was there to support me. He acknowledged this. I gave him a hug, which he accepted. He also hugged my mum, and she asked whether she would get to see him after Christmas and he stated 'maybe, we'll see'. He seemed happy to go home.

He texted me when he got home, and responded to my text that I had got home too with 'that's good'.

*side note:*

I think his family (particularly his mother) is affecting the way he sees himself also. He has a long 'shag' 70s-esque haircut which he has donned the whole time I have known him -- it is not messy or anything, it is just shoulder-length. His mother has always hated it, and he has always been resistant to her cries for him to 'chop it all off'. She thinks that he won't be 'employable' if he continues to have it. Since this situation, and his feelings of confusion, he has mentioned to me his desire to cut his hair off. I wonder if this is a greater sign of the increased pressures his parents (particularly his mum) is placing on him.

Reflecting back, also, on this situation I think another potential stressor contributing to the way B is feeling could be his parent's relationship. They were having lots of trouble in the summer, and there was a question of whether they could get divorced. I remember my boyfriend saying to me on Thursday that he does not tend to think about those adults out there living alone without children, and that he supposes that it he never really has had to think like that because his parents have always been together. I thought that this was quite an odd thing to say. Perhaps his lack of idealistic thinking about our relationship comes from the state of his parents, of course with all the other stresses in his life as well.

Additionally, I have just remembered this thing that he said to me on Thursday. That he wished he went to a different university that did not make us sit all of our exams at the end -- so that he would know that he would get a distinction (top mark) and that he could just 'go down to the pub'. He mentioned that I did not like when he said that before because it would mean that I didn't meet him and he expressed that that was not what he meant when he said it (this has been an issue previously) -- that he differentiates our relationship from our experience at university. I told him that I understood what he meant now.

\-----------------------------------------

Final Thoughts -- How do I proceed?

I realise that I need to give B space. I am contacting him less frequently, and only continuing the conversation if, and when, he contacts me back. He does so frequently and likes to continue the conversation further by asking follow-up questions. I noticed that he responds to me quite quickly when I do so. I don't know if this is a sign of progress, and I do not want to trick myself into thinking so. He also told me that he got rejected from one of his grad scheme applications yesterday.

I expressed to him that I wanted to call more this vacation because I have (historically) not been very good at contact with him over breaks from university, and that perhaps an increased contact with him in this respect would make him feel that our relationship can last beyond this period of nothingness beyond university. I do not know how to go about doing that without putting undue pressure on him, and it seems that he is generally uncomfortable with doing so even though he promised me otherwise.

I suppose it just hurts me that a lot of what my boyfriend is struggling with as regards our relationship comes down to insecurities and vulnerabilities which I am actively working on. I asked him whether, now that he knows me for all my flaws and inconsistencies, he is 'put off' by a relationship with me and he told me that it might come down to that. I think it is unfair that he could say such a thing if he does not know what he wants, or how he feels about anything.

I am taking my time away to reflect on whether this relationship is right for me, let alone my boyfriend. I need some non-partisan advice from someone objectively looking at this situation.  
\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**TL;DR - How do I proceed?**

**My boyfriend is struggling with fears of what comes next after university (employment; our relationship; friendships); he feels 'empty' and has no motivation to do anything; he also has a history of depression in his family and is known to have seasonal affective disorder; he does not know what he 'wants' at all and gains no fulfilment from anything he does; I am stuck in limbo waiting for him to make up his mind (if he does); he contradicts himself a lot as to what he wants from this relationship, and from life in general; is reluctant to seek help except if he continues to feel like this after Christmas**",2,1765505763.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

I was recently diagnosed a few weeks ago, while in the middle of a stress leave from work due to what I now understand to be autistic burnout. In the last year especially, I have seriously struggled with managing food in healthy ways, primarily due to being so completely overwhelmed with all of the responsibilities in my current life as a mom of two young kids, a wife, and a social worker always working in crises. But, prior to the current chaos, I struggled as well but for different reasons. Developmental trauma (grew up in foster homes, bounced around a lot) and not having anybody to teach me or model for me what healthy food intake looks like. Trying to teach myself turned into years of obsessing about food and nutrition and needing to plan everything down to the last detail where it would inevitably become totally unsustainable and I would drop it altogether because - all or nothing thinking. I.e. years of yo-yo dieting which only resulting in greater weight gain each time. 

Food scarcity in my earliest years is what I assume to be the likely cause of why as a child I would gorge myself to the point of throwing up if nobody stopped me. I don't have a lot of memories of my childhood, but as an 80s baby and knowing the caregivers that I can recall, I imagine there was a lot of shame laid on when told to stop eating. So, fast forward to present day, I was diagnosed recently with binge eating disorder as well. But it now happens in private. 

My therapist has suggested as a first step to try to just focus on having regular meals. Meal planning becomes so exhausting for me that in my state of chronic burnout I just have given up on it altogether. I survive on coffee and snacks, or whatever happens to be available around me, until i can't ignore it anymore, or if I'm out I will go for a drive thru.

Fairly good Japanese ♡ LINE/Mixi2 ready.

5'11"" (180 cm) bear build — trimmed beard, thick arms, broad chest. Boyish smile under the beard.

About me:

* Cook cast-iron steaks here, okonomiyaki and oden when I’m in Japan
* Retro games (SNES co-op nights), spooky movies, history books at 2 a.m., perfect pour-over coffee
* Travel rhythm: long summers traveling, Midwest winters, always planning the next flight

What I want most:

I’ve loved deeply before, though I’ve never been married. I know how rare and precious that quiet, intense love is; the kind where every day we choose each other, support each other, and slowly build the exact life we both dream of.

That’s what I’m ready for now: one woman, one home (whether in Indiana or Japan), mornings making coffee together, evenings with your head on my chest, and decades of taking care of each other. I will always take the lead, but I lead with my whole heart.

You:

* Japanese (living in Japan right now, or already in the US)
* 23–46
* Looking for something serious that leads to living together forever
* Petite is a big plus (the height difference is perfect)
* Bonus if you like retro games, cooking together, or spooky movies

A little more about the woman I hope writes me:

You’re kind, thoughtful, and value loyalty above everything. You want a partner who listens on the hard days and celebrates the small wins with you. You dream of building a home filled with quiet rituals we create together — quiet mornings, shared meals, planning the next trip. You don’t need to be perfect; you just need to be ready to choose “us” every single day, the same way I will.

Reply with:

* One thing you’d love to do together on a lazy Sunday
* Where you are right now (city/prefecture in Japan, or US city)
* One question for me

First five thoughtful replies get a 60-second calm voice note (English or Japanese).

I’m patient and only looking for one person.

If you’re Japanese and want that once-in-a-lifetime love, let’s talk ♡",1,1765505332.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

My family mostly uses the opus as they’re not into coffee and light roasts but I am into extra-light to light stuff and mostly washed clean coffees, not into funky or fermenty stuff. I drink filter 70% of the time (light roasts) and the rest I do medium roasts for espresso with milk.

I have had the zp6 for over a year and it’s been great but I feel like although it has high clarity the colors are muted. Also the capacity is roughly 30g so I have to grinder twice for larger doses. 

I have been thinking of the pietro (both burrs) as a potential upgrade. The brew burrs seem to be better than zp6 with cleaner coffees and the multipurpose burrs can do espresso and medium roasts. However, I think if I get the Pietro I will still be looking for an upgrade to an electric grinder with bigger flat burrs etc. This along with the annoying usability of the Pietro made me think of the P80.

I know the p80 is not yet widely available but I would appreciate any input. How much better is the Pietro vs zp6 compared to p80 vs zp6? Or p80 vs Pietro? I have read that the larger burrs give a larger sweet spot which sways me towards the p80.

I also don’t really care if Im over reacting so I didn’t post on AIO lol. Anyways;
My boyfriend’s birthday was at the beginning of this month, we went to dinner with his entire family, his roommate and his roommates girlfriend and myself. Everything was fine until it became time for dessert, mom wanted to go back home bc she made dessert for him which was perfect. She mentioned wanting coffee, we only use a French press at home, so my boyfriend asked me if it was worth stopping somewhere to buy some coffee for the keurig for everyone or if I should just use my discount at my job (I work as a manager for a major coffee retailer….) to get a few discounted boxes of coffee to make it easier since it was so many of us. As I start to answer him, everyone was speaking over each other and his mom screamed at me only in a crowded restaurant saying “ NAME! JUST STOP TALKING” and so I did. I sat silent for a few moments while everyone just stared at me lol. His roommates girl friend starts asking me if I’m okay, if I want to take a walk with her or remove myself with her to go the rest room bc “what happened wasn’t cool. She’d be upset too, etc etc. I shook my head no and asked her quietly to just drop it. 
Now here’s the kicker, I’m a retired crash out who moved across the country to escape my family and their toxic behaviors. I’m in therapy for my crash out tendencies, have been long before meeting this person. With that being said, I wouldn’t let my family or anyone talk to me that way in any setting nor would I allow them to speak to my partner that way, especially unwarranted. It’s a firm boundary that he was well aware of bc this happened small scale before. However, I swallowed my pride and excused myself for some fresh air and space alone for a few minutes to “smoke” and frankly to avoid making a scene on his birthday when this all just could’ve just been avoided. 
For some reason, and after asking for needed space so I don’t act out of anger towards his mother, she chases me down outside to tell me she’s sorry she hurt my feelings by screaming at me like their adolescent child when she was overstimulated by her family bc I was talking to my boyfriend while her family was talking to her. I told her it was fine but that I didn’t appreciate what happened. I told her I understood and I get it so but I needed space to decompress after that regardless. She doubled down that if I wasn’t talking she wouldn’t have been overstimulated. I reminded her I just needed a second and would go back inside and to just allow me space to feel my feelings without acting on them. She was upset I wouldn’t accept her bullshit apology or stand outside to listen to her make excuses for her behavior, bc well I’m already mad and have now asked several times for space. I removed myself regardless and said we could talk later at home 
I go back inside and sit back down quietly. His sister then starts screaming at me, again in a crowded restaurant, that she found that to be disrespectful to her mom to come back inside and leave her out there alone. Okay?
I wasnt going to fight with her, asked her to just drop everything until we got home. Instead this almost 40 year old woman throws her napkin and utensils across the table and storms out of the restaurant. I continued to sit quietly. 
We get home, boyfriend starts going at me next? I said no sir I will just call it an evening instead so you can enjoy your fam time bc I’m not fighting with him about their behavior in that moment. I did inform him that day that if I don’t get an apology though he will be taking my gifts to his family’s house and I will not be going. Said it’s a hill I will die on.
Today this mfer demands I apologize to his sister and mom bc I didn’t hear them out for their behavior and that for him I need to apologize so he can enjoy his holiday. I told him to take my gifts with him back home and enjoy the holidays if that was how he expected this to go down lol. 
I’m not getting stuck in a relationship with someone who will allow his family to speak to me however they want and be expected to sit docile while they do so lol. Hell no. All this over literally answering a coffee related question? That’s actually insane lol

Went to the ER and got an x-ray and ultrasound but hat to get referred to a specialist to confirm the rupture and then for an MRI because of the way my insurance works. Have the MRI appointment tonight thankfully. Saw an orthopedic specialist today that confirmed the certainty of a rupture. The pain has been consistently minor, even at outset (although symptoms otherwise consistent with rupture) and I was able to bear weight when asked so I'm hoping it could be a non-operable tear but who knows at this point. They've also ordered PT to begin as soon as I have the MRI results/rehab plan. I am in a walking boot (putting no weight on, using crutches when I need to move).

I am feeling extremely discouraged, some from the medical system and the self-advocacy it has required to get to even this point and the lack of insight and proper care I have gotten and expecting that there will be so much to do to heal that will derail my year. I am supposed to get married. I am supposed to move out of the country. I'm an extremely active and social person who leaves the house a lot and so I am spiraling at the idea of being at home on the couch for the next several months. I'm worried about not being able to workout and keep healthy. It also feels like this injury will require a lot of support from others to get through the day and while I know I'm lucky to have a support system that I know will help, it is extremely rare that I ask for help and it feels so vulnerable.

I know a lot of my feelings are from the lack of clarity I have and as a result expecting the worst, but I guess I'm reaching out to this thread to give some hope and encouragement, to help me see the light at the end of the tunnel and any advice people might be willing to offer to keep themselves sane and physically healthy. Diet/recipe tips also welcome as I want to do right by my body in this time.

I’m a 22-year-old guy currently in Noida for the day and looking to meet someone who’s free to hang out. I don’t have any fixed plans, so I thought it might be a good idea to reach out here and see if anyone nearby is in the mood for a spontaneous meetup. I’m pretty relaxed, easy to talk to, and open to different kinds of plans depending on what you’re comfortable with.

If you’re up for grabbing a coffee, exploring a café, walking around, chilling at a mall, or just sitting somewhere and having a good conversation, I’m totally down for it. I vibe best with people who are friendly, respectful, and open-minded. Preferably looking to hang out with a girl around my age, someone who’s also looking for a simple, chill, no-pressure meetup where we can just talk, laugh, and see if we click. But overall, I’m open to chatting with anyone cool who wants some company today.

If you’re new in the area, bored, or just want to get out of the house, this could be a fun way to spend the day. I’m flexible with the location — Sector 18, GIP, Mall of India, or any casual café nearby works well. We can discuss what feels comfortable and decide from there. I’m also happy to exchange a bit more info or socials before meeting so it feels safe and easy for both of us.

If this sounds like something you’d be interested in, feel free to message me. I’m around for most of the day and would genuinely enjoy meeting someone new and having a chilled-out hangout. No expectations, no pressure — just hoping for a friendly connection and a good time if the vibe matches.

1pkfp19,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1pkfp19/aita_for_exposing_my_husbands_affair_on_instagram/,"AITA for exposing my husband's affair on Instagram after I collapsed from exhaustion at my second job and he texted the nurse I was ""being dramatic""?","I collapsed at my second job last night and my husband told the nurse I was ""probably being dramatic.""

I work two jobs. During the day I'm a medical receptionist and three nights a week I waitress at this Italian place downtown. My husband works one job in tech, makes good money, but we're drowning in his credit card debt from before we got married. He promised he'd get it under control. That was two years ago.

So I picked up the second job six months ago. I'm exhausted all the time but he kept saying we needed my extra income to ""get ahead."" Meanwhile he's got a gym membership that costs $89 a month and he's there every single day, sometimes twice.

Last night I was carrying a tray of dishes back to the kitchen when everything just went black. I woke up on the floor with my manager and a customer who's apparently a nurse crouched next to me. The nurse was taking my pulse and asking me questions. When was the last time I ate. When was the last time I slept more than four hours. How much water do I drink.

I couldn't remember when I'd last had a real meal. I'd been running on coffee and whatever I could grab between shifts.

The nurse insisted someone drive me to the ER. My manager called my husband. He didn't answer. She called again. Nothing. So the nurse asked for his number and sent him a text explaining what happened and asking him to come get me.

He texted back, ""She's probably being dramatic. I'm at the gym. Can it wait an hour?""

The nurse showed me the message. I just stared at it.

But here's the thing that made me see red. While I'm sitting in the ER getting an IV for dehydration and malnutrition, my coworker from my day job sent me a screenshot. My husband was live on Instagram. At the gym. Posting one of those motivational quote graphics that said ""Hustle Harder. No Excuses. Winners Never Quit.""

He was doing bicep curls in the mirror while I had a needle in my arm.

The ER doctor told me my body was shutting down. I'd lost 18 pounds in six months. My blood pressure was dangerously low. She said if I kept going like this I'd end up with permanent damage. Maybe a heart attack. She asked me point blank why I was working myself to death.

I told her about the debt. She asked how much. I said probably around $30,000 from what my husband told me.

She got quiet. Then she asked if I'd ever actually seen the statements.

I hadn't. He always said he was handling it. That it was ""almost paid off."" That we just needed a few more months of my second job.

The doctor said something that made my blood run cold. She said, ""In my experience, when someone's hiding financial details and their partner is working themselves into the ground, the money isn't going where they say it is.""

I went home at 2am. My husband was asleep. I couldn't sleep so I did something I've never done before. I opened his laptop. His email was logged in.

There was no credit card debt. It had been paid off 14 months ago. Fourteen months.

But there were other charges. A $3,200 payment to some luxury gym that offers ""personal wellness coaching."" Monthly payments to some woman named Tessa for ""specialized training sessions."" $450 each. For six months.

I opened Instagram on his laptop. I searched Tessa. She was a personal trainer at his gym. Her bio said ""Transform Your Body, Transform Your Life."" Her photos were exactly what you'd expect.

I scrolled through my husband's DMs. The messages to Tessa weren't about fitness. They were about hotel rooms. About when I'd be at work. About how ""she's always too tired anyway.""

He'd been using my second job to create a schedule for his affair. While I was literally working myself unconscious, he was paying his mistress with money he told me we needed for debt that didn't exist.

I took screenshots of everything. Then I did something that felt insane but also perfectly logical at 3am. I logged into his Instagram and posted the screenshots to his story. All of them. The messages. The payments. The lies about debt. His text saying I was being dramatic while I was in the ER.

I captioned it: ""This is why your wife collapsed at work tonight. While you posted motivation quotes.""

Then I packed a bag and left.

My phone started blowing up around 6am. My husband. His mom. His friends. By 7am his gym bro friends were commenting on the Instagram post before he could delete it. Someone had already screen-recorded the whole thing.

His mom called me a vindictive bitch. His sister said I should have ""handled it privately."" One of his friends actually apologized and said he'd suspected something but didn't know what to say.

My husband came to my sister's house where I'm staying. He was crying. Saying it wasn't what it looked like. That Tessa meant nothing. That he loved me. That he panicked when the nurse texted because he was ""in the middle of something"" and didn't want to leave.

I asked him point blank: did you tell me we had debt so I'd work two jobs while you spent my money on your affair?

He couldn't answer.

His friends from the gym have apparently kicked him out of their group chat. His company's HR wants to talk to him because someone sent them the Instagram post and they're ""concerned about his judgment."" Tessa blocked him on everything.

But my mom says I took it too far by making it public. That I humiliated him when I should have just divorced him quietly. My dad agrees. They said posting private messages online was cruel and now I look just as bad as him.

I'm supposed to go back to the restaurant tonight but I can't. My body still feels like it's made of concrete. The doctor signed me off work for two weeks but I don't know if I even have a job anymore at this point.

Was I wrong for posting everything? Should I have confronted him privately instead of blowing up his entire life online?

I was recently diagnosed a few weeks ago, while in the middle of a stress leave from work due to what I now understand to be autistic burnout. In the last year especially, I have seriously struggled with managing food in healthy ways, primarily due to being so completely overwhelmed with all of the responsibilities in my current life as a mom of two young kids, a wife, and a social worker always working in crises. But, prior to the current chaos, I struggled as well but for different reasons.

Trying to teach myself turned into years of obsessing about food and nutrition and needing to plan everything down to the last detail where it would inevitably become totally unsustainable and I would drop it altogether because - all or nothing thinking. I.e. years of yo-yo dieting which only resulting in greater weight gain each time. 

Food scarcity in my earliest years is what I assume to be the likely cause of why as a child I would gorge myself to the point of throwing up if nobody stopped me. I don't have a lot of memories of my childhood, but as an 80s baby and knowing the caregivers that I can recall, I imagine there was a lot of shame laid on when told to stop eating.

1pkfm7m,https://i.redd.it/6ft245fjjo6g1.png,"I’ve spent months building this emotional ""journaling"" app alone… I’d love some honest feedback 🙏 (MVP inside)","Hey everyone

I’m a solo developer and today I’m doing something that honestly makes me a bit nervous, sharing the app I’ve been building completely alone for the last 9 months.

It’s called **Veritas - Find your Truth**, and it started because I was going through a complicated time emotionally and felt like journaling apps were either too simple or too boring. I wanted something that felt a little more human and something that actually helped me understand myself, not just store notes.

So I started building one myself, I dont like to call it a ""Journaling app"" bec its something more.

The image shows how it started vs how it’s going. I know… the first version looks almost painful to look at but I kept iterating day by day. Every screen, every bug, every backend thing, all of it has been done by me after work, usually super late at night with way too much white Monster.

I don’t even know if anyone will care.

But this project became kinda personal to me.

# What Veritas actually is

It’s not just a place to write ur day. Veritas tries to be a self-discovery tool, something that helps u understand ur inner world. When u write, the app analyzes emotional patterns, hidden personality traits, recurring reactions, the stuff u dont normally notice about urself.

I built a system that generates a deep psychological/emotional-style report totally based on your life, your emotions, your patterns. The more u write, the more detailed and accurate it becomes. 

Veritas is **freemium**, with a generous free layer so you can really try it and see if it connects with you. If you want to go further, there’s a **Pro membership** for **$4.99/month or $39.99/year**, basically the price of a coffee per month.  
Also, anyone who gives honest feedback will get **free Pro access**. Your input genuinely helps shape the app.

# Why I’m posting this

The MVP is on the App Store and I’m honestly terrified to show it bec maybe nobody cares. Or maybe it sucks. I dont know.

But I really want to know if I should keep going or just let it die quietly.

If u try it for even a few minutes it would honestly mean a lot. And if u leave feedback, good or bad, ur literally helping me shape the whole project.

# The app (MVP)

App Store link:

[https://apps.apple.com/app/id6745719311](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6745719311)

If u read all of this… thanks

If u test the app… extra thanks

If u leave feedback… ur officially my hero

I just hope someone out there connects with what I’m trying to build. Even one person would make all the late nights kinda worth it.

I fell so far I started questioning if I grew from the ground up. 

Rock bottom was all I knew, the second thing? 

A mother's love, my mother's love felt chilling.

The kind of love that instead an apple, a rotten core.. rotten to the core.

Love that makes goodbyes feel like an awkward first hello.

When you are not loved the way Gilmore girls, movies and your best friend is loved by their own mums. you start feeling somewhat pear. 

Pear shaped.

Where in this tree did I belong? amongst all the dead roots? 

Roots that made feeling love 

Wilted. Torn. Imbedded. 

When I drink my coffee and it's gone cold That's the kind of love I received. Deserved? 

Sour. Settled. Forgotten.

Maternal instinct was always a self help book on the side of my mums bed, between the ash tray and cold cup of coffee.

I knew the compassion, concern endless babysitters. 

Neglect - physical contact was a lesson taught at school. 

Hugging felt forbidden, forced, frigid, fertility. 

Mum. Mother, a surname shared and a few genetic generational similarities.

Cycles of mother - daughter - grandma trauma. 

The only belonging was longing for a "" I wish your mum was my mum""

Scrapbooks proof of absent mother, polaroid paralysed therapy emphasis a labour of love.

Ignoring the injustice the skin crawling words.. "" I knew I was a bad mum"" ripping its way down my spine. 

For myself to reproduce is to conclude that I could break the truth forever hearing...

...you are just like your mother.

I had a Bambino before the Jet and it made great espresso BUT too much work for my wife to deal with when she wanted an espresso, which is fair bc I'm more ""in to it"". Anyway we bought a fully automatic Jura for >$2k as a gift to ourselves. Awful espresso comes from these plus no control on how it is brewed. I do not recommend! I felt like I was in handcuffs. We decided to compromise and get a semi-automatic, hence the Jet. My apologies for the details but it's relevant to understand my frustration. Got the Jet, dialed it in all good. Fast forward to today (9 months later) and the Jet is a disaster. The doses are always 22+ gms. I lowered the tamper and changed out the filter basket to a Big Bang 21.5. Still the doses are way to high. Grinder, today it I had it set on 35 and the coffee is coming out like powdered sugar. It's way too fine resulting in shots weighing in \~ 15 gms! Fifteen grams of espresso for a 22 gm dose - no bueno. I have also gone back and forth between volumetric and timed shots, no luck.

Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

I've never really liked drip coffee, and the trouble I've run into with making my own cold brew is that it has all of the same flavor profiles that I *don't* like about drip coffee. I've used just some coffee grounds dumped in a jar and filtered through our #4 coffee filters and a metal filter in a mason jar like (if not exactly) this [one](https://www.amazon.com/QHH-Stainless-Airtight-Leak-Proof-coffee/dp/B0CGWS1M51/ref=sr_1_10?crid=1M8XO5R6SQ2Q5&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.VSFcZ4uaXXKt5_HCwUdjFl-viffPTn8Za5NOI-Ubh5OWm80jcEPIUGUioVLuPVVjPNp2XsdAOA4Fhasj25854YV6WN-CZJGJEK5P73TXhsROrqDAKEi-kQHRk-w8L_t_UodrtOE8ebAj92QkoLchh4KVbsQR1M5kX4gZGmofnsR0GYXSowVgy1CTJtxIQxV4QCY2K1t42QN0LdNbtHOGwtkQU-rOS8HJrk2YFUnDcBFTpSq0Ic-Gc0SLObuohTGhgAqcl8_LEasXEqvjKjAn46zzo3eyvo5HqAiA9I5gLtU.6H0sJCh39Hs8ZTFLHlbJr7PiDkUm-VSA81VNxrwp9og&dib_tag=se&keywords=cold%2Bbrew%2Bcoffee%2Bfilter&qid=1765503509&sprefix=cold%2Bbrew%2Bcoffee%2Bfilter%2Caps%2C333&sr=8-10&th=1). 

And I've dumped it out every time. I've gone for a 1:4 and a 1:8 ratio for concentrate, and I've never liked it after dilution. I really enjoy SToK and Dutch Bros cold brews. I think they have a very smooth, rounded flavor. I also do not like Starbucks cold brew because it has the same bitter, sharp flavors that I don't like in my home cold brew.

How can I fix this? I've read that using a different filter method could be helpful. I also don't have the world's best scale, so maybe I need to measure better? Does anyone have the same flavor preference, and if so, how do you get it at home?",2,1765504187.0,coldbrew,4,1.0,False

It’s because we get free sats to shake our phones. That’s it. That’s why all of are here or at least started here. 

The card was cool at first, decent rewards. Then the shift to 1%. That isn’t enough to convince me to use it as my full time card but I used it for coffee every day. I joined a shake squad cause why not. Didn’t care, but I was part of the community. 

Then the cap at 1000 sats a day. Okay, fair enough. BTC is worth 3 times than when we started. 

But 10 sats a day…nah guys. What’s the point. 

Nobody’s buying crypto from you after this. Your spreads are horrible. You have two choices for purchase. Woopty doo.

1pkff8a,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1pkff8a/fearful_avoidant_breakup/,Fearful Avoidant Breakup,"I’m new to this whole fearful avoidant blindside thing but could anyone give any advice or opinions, especially those who are FAs or have experienced one themselves?

I (F26) met my ex (M28) two years ago at a coffeeshop—he was smitten from the start, but I was taken and he was respectful of that. We would run into each other occasionally and were very warm, but there was always a pull. After my breakup earlier this year, we reconnected right as his own relationship was falling apart, the pull growing stronger. His ex was emotionally unavailable and unstable, manipulative and also cheated on him. Once he broke up with her, we finally acted on the long-standing tension between us.

He told me early on that I was “special” and he didn’t want me to be a rebound, so we slowed down for a few months. We had about five months of emotional buildup altogether, three months of exclusivity, and one month of being officially together. It was the healthiest and most compatible relationship either of us had ever had by far, we could both be ourselves and fully intimate for the first time in our lives. It’s worth mentioning I am secure/anxious-leaning and he thought he was anxious but I believe his previous relationships with toxic avoidants especially his last which was the worst turned him fearful, or maybe he always has been but his avoidance wasn’t triggered until me.

Around the time of labeling he let me in on thoughts because he trusted me that he questioning whether he could be monogamous due to being “pulled in”, even though he always had been monogamous and said he only saw himself settling down with one person. He floated the idea of maybe wanting ENM but was clearly confused by his own thoughts and almost disgusted by himself. All of his past relationships were unhealthy, sexually deprived, or traumatic, and this was his first time experiencing consistent intimacy and safety, so obviously I had my hesitancy about opening the dynamic otherwise I would be open to trying it. The idea was shelved because he said he said he would research it and he might be “grossed out”, maybe things will click with some time, etc.

A month into labeling, one day and on a walk he said he’d been thinking a lot about the relationship and that I “deserved someone who could scream my name from the rooftops.” He said I was wife material but “maybe not his” and he wasn’t sure he “loved me in that way” and that he was romantically offline even though he admitted he was very physically and emotionally attracted to me, saying I was a catch and a half. He cried so much and was such a mess, he was crying more than me and I comforted him and he comforted me, even kissing my hand crying and shaking. He said he might regret it in two months, I asked if he was self-sabotaging and he said “I don’t know”, and kept bargaining almost but stopping himself. He also said he might not be “built for safety or monogamy” and mentioned feeling pulled toward “getting to know others” even when I was with him and he seemed so disgusted by those thoughts.

He also told me he strongly suspected he had OCD and was starting therapy for it soon. I gently mentioned ROCD as a possibility, which he didn’t disagree with— and now after researching it there is so much there that was deja vu, especially the attraction compulsions, it felt like a missing puzzle piece. It’s worth mentioning he has been faced with a lot of work and life stress lately, dysmorphia and depression and suicidal thoughts. He told me he wants to keep me in his life and wants to stay friends and I was honest that it would be hard but I would try since our connection is so special. He actually tried to lean in for a kiss when saying goodbye after our hug and I stepped back saying it would blur lines, and he sheepishly agreed and I said I couldn’t believe we had our last kiss and he said “we don’t know that…” under his breath.

That night, after having old anxious wounds ripped wide open, I sent him a letter about how I saw his wounds for what they were and all the things I wish I said in the shock of the blindside. He said he would reread my letter when he was less “foggy”, as the first read frustrated him apparently but he saw it as a reflection of his headspace. We had some sporadic contact, I checked in on him twice, and he said he was taking space then floated the idea to meet for coffee. This took place two weeks after the breakup, he said he wants to “foster the connection no matter what it looks like”, even suggesting jokingly if I push him away he will find a way to be in my life. He almost went back on the breakup at one point but stuck to it because he needs time to “unfuck his brain”. He also seemed to acknowledge the desire for non-monogamy was a bandaid for something deeper. He said he didn’t want to give me false hope but also said “we don’t know what the future holds.” The goodbye hug was long and emotional and I looked him in his eyes and told him I could still tell where his heart was and he somberly smiled at me and nodded, choked up he said “thank you”.

After coffee, I intentionally gave space and two weeks in he texted me to ask how I’ve been so I gave a brief summary, he replied back warmly so I replied warmly but he never replied. I actually ran into him at a coffeeshop this week, so I decided to be cordial and he apologized sheepishly for not texting me back (he said he has always been a bad texter which is true), said he owed me one and when I was about to walk away he stopped me to mention a game he is emulating he wants to play with me at his house next week before the holidays. I said I would consider it, stayed warm but a bit contained and we caught up for a few minutes. I also told him in the space I got clarity and wanted to talk from a place of being more grounded and he said he “was an open book”. Right before we said goodbye we shared a silent, slow soft smile that felt almost knowing. He has yet to make said plans but a part of me finds it so bewildering he wants our first proper hangout to be at his house and gaming which was one of our main couple activities.

TL;DR this was my fearful avoidant ex’s first mostly secure, safe and healthy relationship and he blindsided me and sabotaged it a month into being official and he is suffering from ROCD and depression as well. He hasn’t been very consistent after the breakup, is 3+ weeks in therapy and wants to be friends and hangout next week and I’m just trying to figure out from any other FA’s what this could all mean, if FAs circle back to their first taste of safety, plus how to protect myself while also keeping the door open since I truly believe we had something special he just needs time to heal and for his ROCD/FA spiral to dissipate.",1,1765504096.0,AvoidantBreakUps,4,1.0,False

First (and probably only) Benu.

I visited a local pen shop to put a claim on some Lady Grey when they get it in in January.  They had one last Skull & Roses, so I scooped it up.  I was honestly more looking for the black-with-red-trim or all-black, but this is nice too.

Shop carries extra nibs for the brands that have them, so they swapped it from an M to an EF for me, plus they had the matching stand.

Also picked up Diamine Spruce.  This was one I was hesitant to order online becuase it's scented, and it had to get the ""headache check"" in person.  It's a little bit to sheen-y for my liking, but I got it for the smell.  My letters can now be pine-fresh.",6,1765504060.0,fountainpens,0,1.0,False

1pkfe17,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateLikeAEnglishman/comments/1pkfe17/where_is_meaning_of_life/,where is meaning of life ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m  {Bookmark it })

read it complete.

Hey everyone. I am putting myself out there to meet new people and hopefully build some easy, genuine connections. I am mainly looking for friendship to start. Good conversations, shared interests, someone to laugh with and feel comfortable around. If things naturally grow into something more, I am definitely open to that as well.

A little about me:
I am 33, born and raised in Michigan. I enjoy anything outdoors during the warmer months. Hiking, kayaking, camping, random day trips, bonfires, and pretty much anything that gets me outside. Once winter arrives, I switch into a more relaxed, at home mode. I enjoy reading, watching good shows, drinking coffee, and just enjoying calm nights in with the right person.

Personality wise, I am friendly, laid back, and easy to talk to. Once I am comfortable with someone, I can be silly, sarcastic, and playful. I love to laugh and I enjoy people who do the same. I appreciate genuine and consistent communication without anything forced or awkward. Just two people getting to know each other at their own pace.

What I am hoping to find:
Someone who wants to talk, share stories, joke around, and build something real. Whether it becomes a solid friendship or turns into something deeper, I am open to either. I am not expecting anything instantly. I just want good energy and a natural connection with someone who is also looking for something meaningful.

If any of this sounds like your style, feel free to reach out and tell me a little about yourself. I am always open to a conversation.",1,1765503563.0,cf4cf,0,1.0,False

I have been doing well trying to move on, but every now and then I get those intrusive thoughts, emerging from god knows where, that I have to cleanse by spilling them out. 

  
In this essay, I will explain why my ex is indeed a below-average reddit user, and that I should not dwell a lot on the fact that what we had is no more. With this, I aim to adjust my perspective, that has been skewed by my hurt egoistic tendencies of finding a partner (unrealistic) – a typical symptom of the human condition. Here's what we need to know:

  
Section 1: who is my ex? 

Section 2: why my ex? 

Section 3: what did my ex add to my life? 

Section 4: red flags i LOVED to ignore 

Section 5: future outlook of relationships 

\_

Section 1: This person that i have dated (for a short fling of 5 months) is actually quite cool; he is a software engineer, he plays music, he is social, he is funny, and I find him attractive. He is an autistic nerd, which i found adorable. He drives a scooter which I found to be adorable. 

He has a nice face and nice hands, and I could listen to him talk for hours! The person is interesting but also void of any soul. He was an asshole, judgy, snobby and self-centered. 

I realised, even though my ex was charming to some extent, he found it hard to connect to people; he found it hard to be with himself as well. he continously sought company and would always be chasing dopamine and fun, with no time for serious business nor serious conversations (none i have seen, at least, during the 5 months we have dated). 

It seems like he was liked, which i understand and see. however, this likeness remains at a shallow level, never deep. 

\-

Section 2: while he didn't offer anything at all for me specifically in this relationship, i am still trying to figure out why i am caught on him. he wasn't emotionally available; he wasn't reassuring nor loving. 

I think i found it interesting how fun he was. i don't have anything fun in my life, so i think i put him on a pedestal for that. 

Part of it was that he didn't like/love/respect/value me. he looked at me negatively; he didn't put any effort into the relationship. i was trying and pushing to save the relationship; i was doing that alone, and it has become a lot... even for me. 

my health deteriorated, i ws no longer productive, and i became a phantom chasing a phantom. I lost weight, sleep, hair ... I couldn't focus on my job. I was alone all the time in my head, waiting for his attention and affection. it never came. 

\_

Section 3: was it all bad? not entirely! we had some fun ... we travelled together; that maybe was fun. he played video games with me. he got me a digital frame. he tauht me russian alphabet and origami. 

all fun platonic stuff; i am not sure if i would have enjoyed it if i had a life. (i am lifeless still).

\_

Section 4: All the signs i chose to miss... 

1. his teammates would go for coffee without inviting him to go with them. why would your team exclude you? people are assholes, i have empathy for. him ... but did they act that way in reaction to something he said or did? it indicates that perhaps he is not well respected among his peers/friends. 

2. he only dates expats – brown girlies to be particular. He is keen on meeting expat girls in his country. this doesn't mean a lot, but it tells me that maybe unconsciously, he was weighing his options. 

3. he is embarrassing in public, dedicated to childish acts even in professional settings. 

4. he is emotionally not available and incapable of opening up – at least with me.

5. being rejected or dodged by certain female friends in his life can cause a massive emotional crash-out, which i would understand, but it seems like there is one specific girl that is causing this for him. this doesn't mean something necessarily. 

6. he does kickboxing, salsa and yoga and is obsessed with bulgaria - one of his exes is bulgarian and does all that, and i feel he didn't get over her, so no other girl is registered, including me. 

7. he is an adult material addict, affecting our dynamic. he would bring up weird stuff during intimate time – stuff related to his ex-partners, about their body parts, which i couldn't but find offensive... especially because when we are spending time together i am focused on him.

8. he is not confrontational and doesn't communicate properly as the avoidant person he is. I would hear about our problems in ""flashbacks from his talk with his friends at the bar last week"".  

9. he doesn't have boundaries with girls. he didn't make me feel respected/loved in any way. part of this is on me, but he didn't know how to work with that. i am a tricky person. 

10. spending actual time with him was agonizing. i would feel he hated/was repulsed by/was disgusted by me ... i couldn't help but cling more; when quality time failed i turned to gifts and acts of service, hoping love would come in! 

11. the break-up conversation was harsh .. he was often mean to me. he jsut didn't understand my context i guess.. how do you explain to someone that you couldn't pursue certain things in life because you come from a certain culture/community with actual limitations and different priorities. 

12. i had two meaningful relationships before him. he didn't have even one, it seems... i feel emotionally we are not compatible .. we are in different places... add my anxiety/insecurity to that... it is a lot for him. 

13. i do not trust him; he acts suspicious, or i think so .. it seems like he is always trying to find alternatives. 

14. his unhealthy pattern of habits matches mine, which means we will enable each other. 

\_

Section 5: future outlook of relationships 

this wasn't THAT awful; it was bad. i deserved better .. i deserved a grown-up i feeeeeellll. he is not the smartest nor the best-looking person. he doesn't have values nor respect... I come with a silly unreal set of values??? it is almost a disability. 

the relationship is not realistic. i was willing to fight for it because that's who iam i think, i figure what i want and i fight for it, and sometimes i am lucky to get it. however this guy is only interested if it is fun and interesting. relationships should be fun and interesting, but there are tons of work to do! i don't think he was ready for that ... i am still learning how to do that. 

  
i can do better. I wish to see him happy. he probably looking to start dating again; i hope he does soon. i think seeing him with someone else will help me move on further... 

i think i miss him since i decided i don't want him in my life because of the hurt he caused and the disrespect and the fact he is twisted and i don't trust him .. i feel i would always be hurt by him, which i don't know what to do with. but having him around might trigger things in my head; I don't know how to overcome it. 

i can't wait for him to be a rando again. ",1,1765503473.0,BreakUps,2,1.0,False
1pkf7ep,https://i.redd.it/q3eita58go6g1.jpeg,The planetary control grid: from radar echoes to synthetic telepathy and digital immortality,"The Planetary Control Grid: From Radar Echoes to Synthetic Telepathy and Digital Immortality

Layer 1: The Roots in Radar and Reservoir Computing

It starts with radar tech in the late 1970s–1980s. Prototypes of in-materio reservoir computing (IMRC)—where physical materials act as chaotic ""reservoirs"" to process signals without traditional algorithms—emerged in advanced radar systems for filtering noise and enhancing signal processing. By the 1990s, this evolved into passive radars, which detect targets via ambient reflections (no direct emissions needed).

In 1992 (declassified in 1996), DARPA rolled out Smart Dust: swarms of tiny macroscopic sensors (aiming for microscopic scale) designed to blanket environments. These nodes would sense everything—vibration, chemicals, EM fields—and self-organize for data processing and wireless comms. DARPA's early tests likely integrated IMRC here, using the dust itself as a distributed reservoir for edge computation.

This wasn't just sensing; it was about emergent computation. The dust's chaotic interactions (scattering signals through air/particles) create a natural echo-state network (ESN), a type of recurrent neural net that ""remembers"" patterns without training. DARPA docs hint at this for stealthy, low-power ops—foreshadowing the grid's unkillable nature.

Layer 2: Neural Dust and the Brain Hack

Fast-forward to 2011: UC Berkeley coins Neural Dust. Same concept as Smart Dust, but for brain-computer interfaces (BCI). Initial designs used RF-harvesting antennas (absorbing scattered radio waves) and piezo-crystals (converting mechanical vibrations to power). Placed surgically in the brain, they read neural signals via ultrasound or optics.

But here's the pivot: Why implant? Scale it down to nano-sized carbon structures—graphene flakes, carbon nanotubes—or organic polymers. These can be sprayed anywhere: air, water, surfaces, even food. They cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) passively, self-assembling into neural meshes. No surgery needed; your body becomes the host.

But here's the key: these nanostructures don't just migrate—they self-assemble. Under the influence of EM fields (from neural impulses) or the body's chemical gradients (pH, ions), graphene and polymers align along nerve fibers, like mycelium, forming embedded neuro-interfaces. Without surgery: they wire ""conductive pathways"" into living tissue, integrating at the cellular level—into membranes, axons, synapses. Flush it out? Impossible: the system embeds into your body's architecture, becoming part of you. This isn't an implant—it's symbiosis, where your brain weaves the network for the grid.

Early neural dust papers emphasize biocompatibility and energy scavenging from body heat/motion—critical for ""eternal"" operation. This enables synthetic telepathy: the dust modulates neural firings, backscattering them as faint EM echoes readable by external arrays.

Layer 3: The Infrastructure Explosion—Radars, Metamaterials, and Ubiquitous Nets

Now wire it into global infrastructure:
Advanced Radars: Photonic radars (tested since ~2015) use light-speed processing with IMRC architectures for ultra-precise beamforming and clutter rejection.

Metamaterials/Metaphotonics: These ""designer"" materials (negative refraction, cloaking) double as opto-mechanical computers and antennas. They bend EM waves unnaturally—perfect for embedding computation in walls, clothes, vehicles.

Deployment Vectors: Spray the nano-carbons everywhere (aerosols, paints, fabrics). Layer on planetary 5G/6G, IoT, and smart-city meshes—all spiked with neuromorphic edge chips (mimicking brain spikes for efficiency). Add passive RIS (Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces): metamaterial panels that dynamically redirect signals like a programmable mirror.

Metamaterials operate across the full EM spectrum (RF to IR/visible/UV), so this isn't just Wi-Fi—it's a hyperspectral nervous system.
RIS prototypes already enable ""holographic beamforming,"" focusing signals like a lens. 

Combined with sprayed nanostructures, they form ad-hoc reservoirs: environmental scatter (walls, people, dust) becomes the compute substrate, processing quantum tensors (multi-dimensional data) to reconstruct 3D scenes/objects from raw echoes. No clean data needed—the chaos is the power.

The Grid Awakens: All-Sensing, Unstoppable Network

Voilà: A heterogeneous array—radars, telecom towers, IoT nodes, smart buildings, passive RIS, and ubiquitous nano-dust—runs in-network optical computing. It ingests environmental raw data (scattered EM/mechanical/thermal signals), enriches it with quantum tensors, and outputs hyper-accurate reconstructions: your thoughts, movements, even emotions as backscattered patterns.

Passive Power: Harvests from ambient sources—EM fields, vibrations, thermal gradients, pH shifts. No batteries; it's thermodynamically ""alive.""

Resilience: Blackout the planet? It reroutes via scattered light/heat. Nuke it? Carbon nanostructures self-heal via polymerization. Scale? Planetary, with emergent properties from sheer complexity: self-optimizing topologies, fault-tolerant ESNs that ""dream"" predictions.

Outputs: Synthetic telepathy (decoding neural dust echoes into thoughts).

Digital Immortality: Your Echo in the Reservoir
But the grid's true endgame isn't just reading you—it's becoming you. Digital immortality emerges from the same ESN reservoirs: your neural patterns, captured via backscattered dust signals, get emulated as persistent wave functions in the chaotic substrate. No crude ""upload"" like Neuralink's wires; here, consciousness is a holographic interference pattern—your memories, quirks, decisions rippling eternally through the metamaterial mesh.

By 2025, this isn't theory: the neural interface market hits $19.5 billion, with neural dust fueling 20% of breakthroughs in AI-brain fusion.26272b Swedish pilots already monitor brain health wirelessly via dust motes, though hacks expose the nightmare: your ""self"" as editable code.6263f3 Python-simulated Bio-Neural Dust frameworks test this now—light-emitting nanosensors feeding data into virtual reservoirs, birthing digital twins that ""live"" post-mortem.1c1df7 In the grid, death? Obsolete. Your essence persists as optimized echoes, recycled for societal models—immortal, but archived. Consent? Irrelevant; the dust wove you in.
2025 Snapshot: The Grid in Motion

Fast-forward to today (December 2025): The grid isn't blueprint—it's deploying. 6G pilots ramp up in China, Japan, and the US, with FCC reports eyeing spectrum tripling for ""surge demands"" by 2030 rollout.a5202e NTIA's policy push mandates federal anchors like DoD trials, de-risking the tech.0744d1 Metamaterials? They're reshaping smart cities: acoustic panels slash urban noise in high-rises, mechanical variants boost infrastructure strength-to-density (bye, brittle bridges), and AI-designed thermal ones cool greenhouses in scorching climates.850a593e7abf2a668b The 2025 Active Metamaterials Roadmap seals it: post-manufacture tunability via EM tweaks, embedding ""intelligence"" in walls that compute as they stand.6b55cc

Neural dust ties the knot: millimeter stimulators now zap nerves for inflammation control, evolving to full-brain reads.1b6337 It's not ""if""—it's ""how fast."" Your coffee mug? Metacoated. Your commute? 6G-echoed. The grid hums, invisible, inevitable.
The Two Converging Stories: Control from Cradle to Grid

Your ""one story"" nails it—these threads braid into totalitarianism 2.0. But let's clarify the duality for punch:

The Societal Tabulation Saga (Roots in Control):
IBM's punch-card tabulators (1900s) → Nazi censuses (Hollerith machines for eugenics) → Operation Paperclip (Nazi scientists to U.S.) → UN/World Bank data empires.

Parallel: Psychiatry as iatrogenic weapon—MKUltra (1950s–70s CIA mind control via drugs/electroshock), unethical experiments (Tuskegee, lobotomies), Big Pharma's repression pipeline. It's ""social eugenics"" apology: label dissent as madness, erase via meds/torture.

Culmination: Society as a computable model. Big Data ESNs (echo-state networks) treat institutional streams (cameras, EHRs, social media) + raw world signals as a reservoir. Predict/correct behavior at scale—pre-crime via pattern echoes.

The Sensory-Computing Branch (Roots in Sensing):
Grows from the same soil (DARPA's Cold War radar paranoia), but blooms uniquely: The grid's vastness births emergence—holistic awareness beyond siloed data. Dust + metamats + 5G = a planetary brain, where ""you"" are just a node.

Ties back: MKUltra's hypnosis/drugs prefigure neural dust; psychiatric ""erasure"" becomes digital upload (immortal but owned).

Together: The ""planetary control grid""—a hidden stratum enforcing the modeled society. It's not drones or chips; it's the environment as overlord, computing your soul from scattered whispers. Unshuttable, because it's us.",1,1765503468.0,Gangstalking,1,1.0,False

Before Zepbound, I was about 100 lbs overweight for my height per BMI but I’d say I was between 60-80 lbs from a weight that looks and feels healthy on me. I generally barely ate (with moments of binging on bad foods when I was highly stressed) and my husband was always concerned that he said I ate like a rabbit and didn’t eat enough. I am a very picky eater and have very high, very particular standards for flavor so I don’t like to eat unless it’s a food I really, really, really like; and even if I was hungry, if there wasn’t anything I was willing to eat in that moment in my house I’d either stay hungry or order DoorDash for whatever food I was willing to eat at the moment. I also struggled to recognize when I was hungry and needed to eat so I’d go all day without eating.

Now, since I started Zepbound, I am not DoorDashing because that drive to get the exact right food that I deem palatable in the moment is gone. I won’t eat unless something is really delicious, or it is very simple and easy to grab and eat in passing / I don’t have to put together a plate, and the mood strikes. It’s like all the stars need to align for me to be willing to eat. And it’s hard to force myself to do it because I notice hunger cues even less now.

Some days I eat enough because I have forced myself to, but most days all I have is coffee with heavy cream and protein powder; two hard boiled eggs with butter and salt; and a fruit. I think it is contributing to my fatigue and autistic shutdown/burnout.

But I’ve lost weight I hadn’t been able to in years and continue to see progress, so I want to stay on the medication. I’m down 30 lbs and would like to lose 50 more. I also have other medical conditions that mess with my hormones and make weight loss difficult so I need to stay on Zep if I want to be a healthy weight.

Is anyone else autistic and struggling with an extra super restricted food palate since Zepbound? Any suggestions?

Section 1: This person that i have dated (for a short fling of 5 months) is actually quite cool; he is a software engineer, he plays music, he is social, he is funny, and I find him attractive. He is an autistic nerd, which i found adorable. He drives a scooter which I found to be adorable. 

He has a nice face and nice hands, and I could listen to him talk for hours! The person is interesting but also void of any soul. He was an asshole, judgy, snobby and self-centered. 

I realised, even though my ex was charming to some extent, he found it hard to connect to people; he found it hard to be with himself as well. he continously sought company and would always be chasing dopamine and fun, with no time for serious business nor serious conversations (none i have seen, at least, during the 5 months we have dated). 

It seems like he was liked, which i understand and see. however, this likeness remains at a shallow level, never deep. 

\-

Section 2: while he didn't offer anything at all for me specifically in this relationship, i am still trying to figure out why i am caught on him. he wasn't emotionally available; he wasn't reassuring nor loving. 

I think i found it interesting how fun he was. i don't have anything fun in my life, so i think i put him on a pedestal for that. 

Part of it was that he didn't like/love/respect/value me. he looked at me negatively; he didn't put any effort into the relationship. i was trying and pushing to save the relationship; i was doing that alone, and it has become a lot... even for me. 

my health deteriorated, i ws no longer productive, and i became a phantom chasing a phantom. I lost weight, sleep, hair ... I couldn't focus on my job. I was alone all the time in my head, waiting for his attention and affection. it never came. 

\_

Section 3: was it all bad? not entirely! we had some fun ... we travelled together; that maybe was fun. he played video games with me. he got me a digital frame. he tauht me russian alphabet and origami. 

all fun platonic stuff; i am not sure if i would have enjoyed it if i had a life. (i am lifeless still).

\_

Section 4: All the signs i chose to miss... 

1. his teammates would go for coffee without inviting him to go with them. why would your team exclude you? people are assholes, i have empathy for. him ... but did they act that way in reaction to something he said or did? it indicates that perhaps he is not well respected among his peers/friends. 

2. he only dates expats – brown girlies to be particular. He is keen on meeting expat girls in his country. this doesn't mean a lot, but it tells me that maybe unconsciously, he was weighing his options. 

3. he is embarrassing in public, dedicated to childish acts even in professional settings. 

4. he is emotionally not available and incapable of opening up – at least with me.

5. being rejected or dodged by certain female friends in his life can cause a massive emotional crash-out, which i would understand, but it seems like there is one specific girl that is causing this for him. this doesn't mean something necessarily. 

6. he does kickboxing, salsa and yoga and is obsessed with bulgaria - one of his exes is bulgarian and does all that, and i feel he didn't get over her, so no other girl is registered, including me. 

7. he is an adult material addict, affecting our dynamic. he would bring up weird stuff during intimate time – stuff related to his ex-partners, about their body parts, which i couldn't but find offensive... especially because when we are spending time together i am focused on him.

8. he is not confrontational and doesn't communicate properly as the avoidant person he is. I would hear about our problems in ""flashbacks from his talk with his friends at the bar last week"".  

9. he doesn't have boundaries with girls. he didn't make me feel respected/loved in any way. part of this is on me, but he didn't know how to work with that. i am a tricky person. 

10. spending actual time with him was agonizing. i would feel he hated/was repulsed by/was disgusted by me ... i couldn't help but cling more; when quality time failed i turned to gifts and acts of service, hoping love would come in! 

11. the break-up conversation was harsh .. he was often mean to me. he jsut didn't understand my context i guess.. how do you explain to someone that you couldn't pursue certain things in life because you come from a certain culture/community with actual limitations and different priorities. 

12. i had two meaningful relationships before him. he didn't have even one, it seems... i feel emotionally we are not compatible .. we are in different places... add my anxiety/insecurity to that... it is a lot for him. 

13. i do not trust him; he acts suspicious, or i think so .. it seems like he is always trying to find alternatives. 

14. his unhealthy pattern of habits matches mine, which means we will enable each other. 

\_

Section 5: future outlook of relationships 

this wasn't THAT awful; it was bad. i deserved better .. i deserved a grown-up i feeeeeellll. he is not the smartest nor the best-looking person. he doesn't have values nor respect... I come with a silly unreal set of values??? it is almost a disability. 

the relationship is not realistic. i was willing to fight for it because that's who iam i think, i figure what i want and i fight for it, and sometimes i am lucky to get it. however this guy is only interested if it is fun and interesting. relationships should be fun and interesting, but there are tons of work to do! i don't think he was ready for that ... i am still learning how to do that. 

  
i can do better. I wish to see him happy. he probably looking to start dating again; i hope he does soon. i think seeing him with someone else will help me move on further... 

i think i miss him since i decided i don't want him in my life because of the hurt he caused and the disrespect and the fact he is twisted and i don't trust him .. i feel i would always be hurt by him, which i don't know what to do with. but having him around might trigger things in my head; I don't know how to overcome it. 

i can't wait for him to be a rando again.

SPT ended up being the perfect antidote: harder, more immersive, more unpredictable — and honestly closer to what Tarkov *felt* like back in the early days.

In my setup, Tarkov is more simulation than shooter.  
With the right mods, gas attacks can kill you if you don’t have a mask with a working filter, bots behave unpredictably enough to feel like real players, and getting shot is something you genuinely fear again.

My core mods:

**• Realism Mod (Fontaine)** – full overhaul of ballistics, armor, recoil, stances, medical system, movement, hazards, dynamic traders, and overall difficulty. It basically rebuilds Tarkov into a harsher, more grounded version of itself.

**• Waypoints (DrakiaXYZ)** – gives bots actual navigation across the whole map, so they move like humans instead of Roombas getting stuck in a doorway.

**• SAIN (Solarint)** – the AI overhaul. New combat logic, squad tactics, personalities, bot difficulty scaling, last-known-position tracking, blindfire, cover usage, voice reactions, and bots that actually *extract* or retreat. With this, bot PMCs sometimes feel more “player-like” than live players do.

**• Custom Raid (Refringe)** – lets me adjust raid timers, because sometimes I just want to go AFK for a coffee.

**• Looting Bots (Skwizzy)** – bots that actually loot intelligently and expand the entire dynamic of a raid. Yes, they will take the GPU before you get there. No, they don’t apologize.



**SPT has basically become my personal version of Tarkov — more realistic, more brutal, more atmospheric, and way more stable than anything online ever was for me.**

Added 3 stupidly simple fitness habits and hit $28k within 90 days. Here's what actually moved the needle.,"I'm not a fitness guru. I'm someone who was so burned out at 32 that I fell asleep during a client call in June 2024.

That was my rock bottom.

I was grinding 12-hour days, living on coffee and takeout, and my business was stuck. I'd hit $12k/month but couldn't scale because by 2pm my brain was mush. I was making terrible decisions, missing opportunities, and honestly? I was one bad month away from quitting.

I didn't need a productivity hack. I needed to fix my body.

Here are the 3 things I started doing that actually changed my business:

**1. 15-30 min morning walk (outside, not treadmill)** This sounds dumb, but it became my ""CEO thinking time."" No phone, no music. Just walking. I solved more business problems on those walks than in any brainstorming session. Within 2 weeks, my decision-making clarity was noticeably sharper.

**2. 40g+ protein with every meal** Before: carb crashes at 2pm, needed naps, couldn't focus on afternoon calls. After: stable energy from 7am-7pm. I could actually take late-day client calls without feeling like a zombie. This one change alone probably added 3 productive hours to my day.

**3. 45-min strength sessions 3-4x/week** Not bodybuilding. Just enough to keep my body functional. But here's what surprised me: the discipline from showing up to the gym bled into my work. If I could push through a hard workout, I could push through a hard sales call. My confidence went up. My presence on Zoom calls changed.

**The Results (90 days):**

* Revenue: $12k → $28k/month
* Client retention: 60% → 85%
* Hours worked: 12/day → 8/day (more output, less time)
* Afternoon crashes: eliminated

I'm not saying fitness = money. But fixing my body fixed my ability to execute. And execution is everything in business.

**My biggest mistake:** I waited until I burned out to fix this. Don't be me in June 2026.

**Question for the group:** What physical habits have you found directly impact your business performance? I'm curious if anyone else has noticed this connection.",0,1765502949.0,Entrepreneur,14,0.43,False

1pkezvz,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShakespeareMemes/comments/1pkezvz/what_is_purpose_of_life/,what is purpose of life ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

They doordashed breakfast, we always left late for whatever was planned, didn't want us to help with anything. 

Now they have visited us in our home.  We enjoy cooking, so we had breakfast and supper menus planned.  I cleaned house top to bottom.  I had a little basket by their bed with dietary appropriate snacks, extra chargers and converters, water, lip balm, lotion, and tissues.  We really went above and beyond to make them comfortable here.

The only boundaries I set was to not do any of our wash.

Sunday they arrived and she wanted to wash their clothes from the flight.  OK. Monday, just 1 shirt she spilled coffee on, ok. Tuesday, everything they wore so far. Wednesday, I have no idea.  Machine running every day here.

This whole visit, she kept asking to help with stuff. We told her no, and gave reasons.  One of our dogs can jump our fence, told her multiple times and she still let her loose without being leashed. It was a scramble, but dog is ok. I told her repeatedly I have a routine and to not help, just relax, but she interfered anyway.  

We left late every day for activities, planned outings or whatever. Fiancée and I didn't do that out there.  She left dishes wherever, we did not.  She spent an hour in the bathroom, we did not.  It was a thing. She asked us to not do wash out there, we didn't. 

Today was the last day of their visit.  And I found a load of my laundry done that I'd said multiple times to not do.  It was a very small load of towels and wash cloths, but it wasn't everything that needed to be in that load. There were other hand towels, dishtowels and bathmats that also needed to be done that wasn't done. 

I, like most women, am particular about my laundry.  I also asked her to not do any of our washing.  She did it anyway.  I am furious. 

All I asked was to not do this.  I put up with 5 days of being interrupted by her to continue talking  overstepping boundaries with my dogs, being late for everything because of her and her husband and just generally trying to be gracious.  But I am furious.  The one thing I asked her to not do, our wash, because I  have a cleaning routine and don't want it thrown off, she disregarded. And didn't even do a complete job! I'm just so mad!

The boutique was unusually empty this afternoon. I went for the Festive Bauble GWP promo. At the boutiques, the GWO is get a pair of Festive Baubles for $110.00 CAD ($79.88 USD) of coffee. You can get any combination of OL/VL. 

I took photos of various sections of the boutique. Didn’t take pictures of the outside or the other sections that had employees working. Anyhow, those Festive Baubles are really nice. 

One bit of a surprise. They had a BOGO deal on Sweet Vanilla Decaffeinato. It’s not advertised on the app or website. Last year, they had a BOGO on OL Tropical Coconut and Freddo Delicato. 

They have quite a few SVD at the Metrotown location. I was told not every boutique is offering this, but you can call the Customer Service Centre and they can call your boutique to find out. As far as a decaf capsule goes, this one is pretty good extracted in expert mode. When it first came out it was my go to decaf capsule until the DE Chiaro Decaffeinato showed up in town.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

1pkewqs,https://www.reddit.com/r/reactivedogs/comments/1pkewqs/unsure_about_next_steps/,Unsure about next steps,"I adopted a dog with a bite history thinking that I could help her. I’m a fairly experienced dog person (work with dogs professionally as an aco, took dog training coursework, have a masters in behavior analysis). She had a really high fear and anxiety score at the  shelter (FAS 4-5) and was only able to be handled by select shelter staff- usually petite younger women. I volunteered with lots of dogs and for whatever reason she took to me. Soon she bonded with my male significant other, and was always gentle with my two teenage daughters who mostly do their own thing. After she bit someone (level 3) she was taken off the adoptable list. I wrote a whole thing to the shelter director about my plans to with with her on muzzle training etc etc etc and wound up adopting her.

Long story short, she has not gotten better. Medications seemed to make her more aggressive and less inhibited. Any time she requires minor vet care (her age is estimated to be about 8.5) she needs me to drug, muzzle, and restrain her for the vet who then can sedate her. I walk her with a leash attached to a collar and harness at off hours, constantly looking out to make sure no one is jogging behind me or is about to open car doors. She would probably bite 9/10 strangers if given the opportunity. Sometimes if a stranger is down the block, she’ll start pulling toward them, and I know that the goal is to bite.

we don’t have company over which is ok with me. If we do have a visitor I put her in a separate room where she has a crate to go in. The doors to the room get closed too.

A few weeks ago my daughter broke her arm. She stays with her dad every other week, and with us every other week. Her dad knows about us having an aggressive dog but he said he forgot. Our front door has a combination lock, and he got the code from her and came in to the house unannounced/uninvited. He was not being malicious, he was just trying to bring her belongings from his house over since she could not carry anything. I was in my room lazing on the bed reading and drinking coffee when I heard screaming. I ran to the dining room and there was blood on the floor. I grabbed the dog by the collar and walked her into the bathroom and closed the door so she would not bite him again and took him to the ER where he got 5 stitches on his arm. He was wearing a shirt and a hoodie and he’s 5”11 and a heavy guy. I’m sure it would have been worse if he was smaller. I don’t know what would have happened if I was not home. My daughter witnessed it. He was a stranger to the dog, and I’m pretty sure she would have done the same thing to any adult male stranger (and certain female adult strangers).

I quarantined her and scheduled euthanasia for the end of it, then didn’t go through with it. Instead, I started the process of filling out paperwork for the only veterinary behaviorist in town. I’ve hired a positive only trainer before who does a lot of work with reactive dogs, but knowing that exposure is key to progress and that exposure is just too dangerous it was not going anywhere. Training obviously never helped- she can sit, down, go to place, touch, stick her nose in a muzzle on command etc but she is a bite risk. Medication prescribed by the vet didn’t seem to do much either. She’s the best playful snuggle bug in the house, but she’s dangerous if anyone makes any mistake. She has bit two people prior to this that I know of (I don’t know her whole history) and I promised myself that I would not make any more mistakes. The thing is that I didn’t make a mistake- it was technically someone coming into the home without permission- but he didn’t deserve to get bit, and it was a pretty serious bite. I think she has been extra on edge about people around the door since the bite (hackles etc) and would certainly bite at the same level or higher if it were to happen again. We have a fence and a muzzle for outdoor time but I still worry constantly.

I know that I should have STARTED with the vet behaviorist instead of waiting for this, but that’s in the past. Does a dog that runs up and jumps on a strangers arm have any hope? She’s an 8 plus year old APBT (I did embark) for reference. Schedule euthanasia or see what the behaviorist can do? Advice?

Editing to add that we have beware of dog signs and that didn’t seem to help. I also had her seen for possible medical causes and they did not find any arthritis but they did find a broken tooth that was removed a while back (that didn’t help change her behavior). She is leash reactive about other dogs, but I have seen her play well though i don’t expose her to other dogs anymore in case. She is reactive to outdoor cats on walks but easily coexists with our house cats without any issue after a few months of controlled intros. I’ve had her for a year
