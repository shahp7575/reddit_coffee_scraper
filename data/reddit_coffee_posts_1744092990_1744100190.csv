1ju8gif,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ju8gif/aitah_for_thinking_my_friend_is_the_asshole/,AITAH for thinking my friend is the asshole,"I (36F) have a married female friend (35F), husband is (37M). Married for 5 years, dated for 1+. We have been friends for more than a decade. She was a colleague of mine but we do keep contact every once in a while. Around September last year, she contacted me to attend our former colleague's wedding and after that once in a while we hang out to eat/for coffee. 

Around Oct/Nov I found out that her husband laid his hands on her (as a DV survivor myself, it triggered me a lot to hear that). The story was that he sneaked around her phone and he found deleted pictures of her and a guy, the guy was hugging her by the waist. She got angry and she slapped him and he did it to her back. They both went to told their respective parents (husband's family live in the same city whilst hers are in a different city). So I told her, if you need anything, you can always go to my place for safety.

I met with her a couple of days ago for coffee, she told me that her husband is still suspicious of her and following her every move. Apparently she met another guy friend (just the two of them at an open area coffee shop) and she informed husband where they were and her husband abruptly came was being violent (ask nearby thugs to beat up the guy), so she got scared. I am still on her side by this point.

But during the conversation, she let it slipped that she did in fact cheated on her husband and are already talking about divorce. The guy who she cheated with went dark but her husband somehow is still keeping an eye on him (private eye or something). Her husband is telling her that he's gonna get even with this guy (I tend to think of the worst on this one) because the last time, they only have a restraining order (similar to this, I don't live in America)

So I was basically guiding her step by step on how to defuse his anger via text while I was talking to her. I told her to tell him that she is sorry for not letting him get even in the first place (a punch or two) and that she doesnt want to ruin their marriage even more if things got ugly (police involved and such). I asked her if she knew if he has been cheated on in the past and  I told her his pain and fear have festered and that men most likely resort to violent. She mentioned he said 'you made me do this' which is narc's textbook gaslighting (i am well aware of that) and it scared me for a while because thats what my ex used to do to me.

I advised her to go to marriage counselling and gave her list of doctors for recommendation. She doubted that her husband is willing to do go at first but he is.

After a little more 'prying' for information, turns out she almost always never introduced/included him in her circle of friends. When asked why, she said that her husband is very quiet and awkward around people and she kinda feels ashamed of him (I advised her to start slowly introducing him to her circle of friends to make him feel at ease and be less suspicious, to build more trust and transparency)


For additional info: 
- They have been trying to have a kid but failed, want to try again but money got in the way (for now)

- She makes more money than him. Her friends suspected that he's using her for money but I don't because he's also working but making less and she doesnt pay for everything. She owns the house and has a car. Husband only has motorcycle. 

- Her husband is introverted, wife is very extroverted. I am introverted (mostly ambivert)

- In-laws relations are no longer bueño. She thinks the in-laws are siding with the husband and won't help her talking him out of it. 

Am I the asshole for siding with my friend at first because of my past experience but now I am kinda thinking she's the asshole in all this and start feeling sorry for the husband? By no means, i don't condone any kind of violence from/ to both sexes. They already talked about divorce and she seems to be okay with it and she just want to get it over with. Like she did wrong and now she wants to move past this. She said that she thinks divorce is gonna hit him harder than it will to her. 

What do you guys think

PS: sorry if my story seems to be all over the place, typos, sentences that dont make sense. English is my second language.

1ju8eml,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1ju8eml/elevate_your_space_with_boho_decor_and_ceramic/,Elevate Your Space with Boho Decor and Ceramic Vases,"If you're drawn to interiors that feel relaxed, artistic, and full of personality, boho decor might just be your design soulmate. Rooted in creativity and self-expression, this style combines global influences, earthy tones, and eclectic pieces to create a warm and inviting atmosphere in any home.

**What Is Boho Decor?**

[Boho decor](https://homeandsouldubai.com/collections/decoration), short for bohemian decor, embraces freedom in design. It’s all about layering textures, mixing patterns, and showcasing handcrafted pieces that tell a story. Think natural materials, macrame wall hangings, cozy throws, and earthy ceramics. Whether you live in a studio apartment or a spacious villa, boho styling brings a sense of calm and individuality to your space.

**Make a Statement with Boho Wall Decor**

No boho-inspired home is complete without [boho wall decor](https://homeandsouldubai.com/collections/wall-hanging-decorations). From woven baskets to rustic mirrors and nature-inspired art, your walls offer endless opportunities for creative expression. You can build a wall with a mix of textures or let one oversized piece speak volumes. Natural materials like wood, jute, and rattan add warmth accents provide an unexpected twist.

**The Charm of Ceramic Vases in Boho Styling**

Ceramics play a major role in achieving a cozy boho aesthetic. [Ceramic vases](https://homeandsouldubai.com/collections/ceramic-vases) are versatile, grounding, and beautifully imperfect—perfect for this eclectic style. Place them on open shelves, coffee tables, or entryway consoles to bring a soft, organic touch to your decor.

Whether you're displaying fresh blooms or leaving them empty as sculptural accents, ceramic vases instantly add soul to your interiors. For an even more curated look, mix different shapes and finishes—glazed, matte, textured—to create visual interest.

**Don’t Overlook the Ceramic Vase Small**

Sometimes it’s the smallest details that make the biggest impact. A [ceramic vase small](https://homeandsouldubai.com/products/rosalia-ceramic-vase-white) is ideal for styling nooks, side tables, or open shelving. These little gems can hold a single dried stem, fresh herbs, or stand alone as artistic objects. Their compact size makes them perfect for layering with candles, books, and other boho accents.

**Final Thoughts**

Creating a boho-inspired space is all about telling your story through design. Whether you're starting with a bold piece of boho wall decor or slowly adding accents like ceramic vases, each element should feel personal and intentional.

All of a sudden last week I started getting watery but slow shots.

* Sette 270 is on 2 shims, size 4E. Tried 3E and it's even slower but still watery
* Sette 270 cleaned with cleaning chips around 6 months ago
* I use a scale, 20g in 40g out
* Sage dual spout portafilter, IMS basket
* 2 weeks old square mile red brick espresso beans
* I use RO water and no Sage filter in the tank
* I run 4 empty shots to warm up the machine before I brew the real one
* Automatic steam function does the job well
* I regularly descale and clean the pressure overflow valve as soon as the machine requires so

This whole setup **never changed** in 3 years, everything has always been working great. Same coffee, same settings, same everything.

What steps could I take to troubleshoot? What could this be? Especially since I have 2 devices, I am not sure which one could all of a sudden have started going bad...?",2,1744099708.0,espresso,2,1.0,False
1ju8e55,https://i.redd.it/yatl7xmujkte1.jpeg,"Is this just Freelancing, or am I starring in my own low budget workplace sitcom? Client Ghosting on Iteration 8...","Okay, real talk. Is this just the freelancer experience, or am I trapped in some kind of never ending, slightly soul crushing workplace comedy? You know the kind. It starts with a ""simple"" project (Telegram bot plus backend, described in maybe four lines of text, tops). You think, ""Piece of cake.""

Then, naturally, the scope starts expanding like that one coworker's ego. Around iteration 4, the client drops a 2 to 3 page document of ""minor"" changes that are definitely not minor. You propose a new milestone for this extra work (because, you know, fair is fair). Crickets.

But you're a professional, you persevere. You tell yourself, ""Just gotta get through this quarter."" You keep iterating. Debugging. Tweaking. We're now on Iteration 8. EIGHT. The bot is built. It's running. ✔️ It just needs… feedback. That magical ingredient that unlocks the ""final"" version.

And that's where the sitcom absurdity kicks in. The client? Gone. Poof. Disappeared into the digital ether for weeks at a time. It's not just ""slow to reply."" It's full on radio silence. It's like they've clocked out and gone home, leaving you staring at your screen, wondering if you imagined the whole project. And this isn't a one off; it's the pattern. Every time feedback is needed, it's like waiting for a memo to come down from corporate. You know it should arrive eventually, but who knows when?

The best part? Even now, after all this, they'll occasionally pop back up, completely ignore the milestone conversation from weeks ago, and ask, with a straight face, ""So, is there any progress on this?""

ARE YOU KIDDING ME? The backend IS running. My server costs ARE running. 🥲 It's all running and waiting for your input on Iteration 8! It's like asking if the presentation is ready when you haven't even given me the slides.

Seriously starting to feel like I'm in a workplace sitcom where the joke is just… me. Do I just ship Iteration 8 and hope for the best? I hate sending unfinished work, but I'm also burning time and money waiting in this feedback void. What do you do when your client turns into the office ghost? How do you escape this cycle of feedback limbo? Send help (and maybe some coffee).

So, first of all, *Pookie* ko koi letter dene ki zarurat hi nahi thi… but here I am anyway. 😄 I think what you really need is a little realization that *tu ek number ka chomo hai*—just kidding!

Honestly though, I can’t thank you enough. Not because I don’t have words, but because *tu khud hi sab samajh jaata hai.* You know how much I respect you, how much I love you as a friend, and how much I owe you. I don’t even remember how we met, and frankly, I don’t think it matters. What matters is—I always wanted a friend like you… or better yet, a *Pookie* like you.

I love the way you *try* to understand people and solve their problems—even if you aren’t always successful (points for trying 😆). Lunches, tea breaks, long walks… I’ll never forget any of it. You somehow always make time for everyone—so don’t you *dare* start ignoring me now.

Whenever you talked about your struggles, I often wondered how you manage to stay so cheerful. But then I realized—when you're truly attached to something, love happens... even if it comes with pain. I don’t know everything about you, but I genuinely want to. I’ve seen your cute side, happy side, angry side, sad side… but your *Pookie* side? That’s my favorite.

And I feel completely comfortable around you. Don’t get me wrong—I’m straight 😅—but not everything deserves an “I don’t care” response, okay?

I don’t know you *enough* to describe what kind of person (yaani ki 26 saal ka uncle) you are, but I *do* know I’m grateful for everything you’ve listened to. If I ever unloaded too much, and it gave you low-key trauma—*sorry yaar*. I worry about your sleep, your diet, and yeah… your relationships (you *know* what I’m talking about). So, if you ever feel like you need someone—I'm just a text or call away. No drama.

Now about that Comicon invite… that was awesome. I mean it—I don’t even have words for how much I enjoyed that. I met your friends, your colleagues—and yes, *Pragati was looking cute* (don’t tell her!). You were rocking that crimson red sweater, by the way. And on the way back to the station, all I had were memories and a smile I didn’t expect… all because of you. So thank you.

I’ve really enjoyed your company. From deep conversations about crushes and heartbreaks to all the random rants about how messed up life is—we’ve covered it all. One of my favorite things about you? Your beard. Why? Because I don’t have one. But hey—I probably have double the hair on my head, so win-win. And don’t even think about stealing my “Chocolate dena” sorry trick—it’s my thing, and it only works when *I* do it!

And yeah, I did feel bad seeing you upset when Melissa turned me down for coffee because of her *shift extend*. That sucked.

But look—I’ve made it this far in life, and you’re one of the big reasons why. Whenever you’re around, I feel this strange sense of peace. And when you’re not, I have to depend on others—and let’s be honest, no one quite fills your shoes.

You’re extroverted, soft-hearted, handsome (ugh), and most importantly—*a true Pookie.* Not praising you too much though, warna *Deepti jealous ho jayegi.* 😜

I can't think of a traumatic event to pin point it. And I go through periods of time where I have no anxiety, so I think it's gone, and then inevitably it comes back and I'm plagued with a tight chest and trouble-breathing and being scared to sleep and worried about what food or situation might trigger a panic attack. It's on and off for months at a time.

I've had blood tests. I had my thyroid tested. I've had my vitals taken multiple times because I'm convinced there must be SOMETHING that's causing this. I'm going to see a gastroenterologist next month because much of my symptoms are digestive-related, but I'm sure the tests will all be normal, just like every other time. 

Maybe there's a genetic component? Both my siblings struggle with all the same symptoms and have tried different medications. Every single solution anyone has ever given me has helped me cope, but none of them cure it. Nothing makes it go away. 

I do yoga regularly now, I'm exercising, I've cut out coffee and alcohol, I got off social media, I'm avoiding the news, I tried traditional Chinese medicine, and acupuncture, you name it. I haven't dabbled much in medication because I have a negative perception of it. It feels like masking or tricking my brain when what I really want is to get to the root of it.

At 100%, you'll be as energetic as a 25 year old after a good night's sleep and a cup of coffee. At 5% you'll struggle to stay standing. 

Your metabolism is suspended while the power is active, and rather than burning calories you draw from your phone (or tablet or other reasonably equivalent device)'s battery instead. 

Sitting at home watching TV will drain your battery about as quickly as scrolling Reddit. Playing an active sport will drain it as though you were playing high res video with max brightness and the flashlight on. 

If your battery dies while this power is active, so do you. This goes for damage as well. If it is rendered nonfunctional you're dead.

If you start charging your phone, you have about 30 seconds to get into a comfortable place/position before you fall asleep. This *cannot* be done against your will. If you don't want to charge your phone, it will ignore the power source. 

When your phone reaches 100%, the power deactivates automatically and you'll wake up refreshed as though you'd had about 5 hours sleep. You can then go back to sleep normally to make up the difference. 

You also wake if your phone is unplugged, the power goes out, etc. This CAN be done without your consent and thereby prevent you from deactivating the power. 

The phone must be your primary personal device. You don't need to do anything to switch devices, the power simply ""knows"" which one you are most bonded to.

You instinctively know your exact battery percentage while this is active. 

Using your device while the power is active *will* drain it faster accordingly. 

Turning the device off or removing the battery will not harm you, but won't save battery power either. This is mostly so you have a chance to rush out and replace it if it is lost or stolen while the power is on.  ",2,1744098629.0,shittysuperpowers,1,1.0,False

The Ultimate Guide to Safe & Healthy Sweetening,"https://preview.redd.it/2hlyrx6n3kte1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2814b2445b73aa7777c157282281134e79ed0e09

Since there are ever-growing health issues regarding sugar intake, Stevia is being resorted to as a natural sweetener. Still, one massive question lingers:"" Can We Consume Stevia Every Day?

Stevia has been touted as a sugar substitute that is healthy, has no calories, does not cause blood sugar increases, and has even health advantages. But is it really safe to consume over the long term? How safe is Stevia to take every day? And are there hidden side effects?

In this research-driven guide, we'll cover everything you want to know about Stevia's daily consumption, how it compares to sugar and artificial sweeteners, and if it truly is a healthy choice for gut health, diabetes, and weight loss.

Let's get started!

# What Is Stevia? A Quick Overview

Stevia is derived from the leaves of the plant Stevia rebaudiana, which originated in South America. Its sweetness is a result of steviol glycosides, which are 200-300 times sweeter than sugar but contain no calories and have no effect on blood sugar.

# Forms of Stevia

* **Pure Stevia Extract (Reb-A) –** The FDA-approved form used in most commercial products.
* **Stevia Blends –** Mixed with erythritol, monk fruit, or other sweeteners.
* **Raw Stevia Leaves –** Unprocessed but not FDA-approved for commercial use.

[Stevia is widely used in beverages](https://zindagistevia.com/stevia-recipes/?v=f9f0a42f293e), baked goods, and even salad dressings, but is it safe for daily consumption? Keep reading!

# Is Stevia Safe for Daily Use?

https://preview.redd.it/eu2tysj15kte1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=72457d2ccfd8a8cfaac101b1a346706a8f997c56

**FDA Approval & Daily Recommended Intake**

The FDA has approved [Stevia extracts like Rebaudioside A (Reb-A)](https://zindagistevia.com/product/zindagi-stevia-powder-stevia-sugar-200gm-natrural-sweetener/?v=f9f0a42f293e) for consumption by humans. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 4 mg/kg of body weight.

**What does this mean in real life?**

If you are 70 kg (154 lbs), you can consume up to 280 mg of Stevia a day safely.

This means 5-6 packets of Stevia every day, depending on the brand.

So, YES, Stevia is safe to consume daily—if you don't go beyond the recommended guidelines.

# Stevia vs. Sugar: Which One Is Better for Daily Use?

https://preview.redd.it/9nkns8456kte1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=110d5361f949119b212e70d1b7fa17605c7811e8

# Why Stevia Wins:

It offers sweetness without calories, sugar crashes, or dental issues.

# Why Sugar Fails:

[Sugar contributes to obesity, diabetes, and tooth decay](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/food-news/10-reasons-why-white-sugar-is-considered-bad/articleshow/114430942.cms)—making it a bad choice for daily consumption.

# VERDICT:

**If you’re looking for a daily sweetener, Stevia is the healthier option.**

# Stevia vs. Artificial Sweeteners: Which Is Safer?

Some people prefer artificial sweeteners like aspartame, sucralose, or saccharin, but are they really safe?

https://preview.redd.it/mtukmhgg6kte1.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=df33d1326425bbe22446d9950cbde93bb6267948

# Why Stevia Wins:

It is a natural sweetener with no recorded long-term risks.

# Why Artificial Sweeteners Are Risky:

Studies show they can change gut bacteria, make people crave more of them, and cause metabolic issues.

# VERDICT :

If you want a [safe, natural, and gut-friendly option, Stevia](https://zindagistevia.com/products/natural-sweetners/?v=f9f0a42f293e) is the better choice for everyday consumption.

1ju7z52,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1ju7z52/what_is_the_best_at_home_teeth_whitening/,What is the best at home teeth whitening?,"# My Quest for the Best At-Home Teeth Whitening

Like most people, I've always wanted brighter teeth without paying hundreds at the dentist. I've tried just about everything—**whitening strips, whitening toothpaste, even DIY baking soda methods**. Some worked a little, some didn't work at all, and some made my teeth sensitive enough to quit after a few days.

Recently, I heard about Laughland teeth whitening. It seemed different because it uses a dentist-formulated whitening gel combined with an LED mouthpiece. Reviews mentioned quick results and minimal sensitivity, so I decided to give it a try and see if it's really the **best at-home teeth whitening** out there.

# What's Inside the Laughland Kit?

Opening the box, I liked the simplicity right away:

* **Whitening Gel Pens** – Easy to apply without mess.
* **LED Mouthpiece** – Designed to boost the whitening effect.
* **Straightforward Instructions** – Clear and simple.

Honestly, it looked promising and was a nice change from those messy whitening trays or slippery strips.

# How Does Laughland Teeth Whitening Work?

Each session takes just **10 minutes a day**, which fit easily into my schedule. Here's exactly what I did each day for a week:

1. **Brushed and dried my teeth** (important step!).
2. **Applied the whitening gel evenly** using the gel pen.
3. **Inserted the LED mouthpiece** and waited 10 minutes.
4. **Rinsed my mouth and cleaned the mouthpiece**.

The instructions explained that the LED light helps activate the whitening gel (hydrogen peroxide), allowing it to penetrate stains better and faster.

# My Daily Results

* **Day 1:** Not much difference in whiteness, but teeth felt cleaner.
* **Day 3:** Noticeable difference, especially in coffee stains around my front teeth.
* **Day 7:** Teeth were significantly whiter—I'd say **around 6 shades brighter**, noticeable but still natural-looking.

The best part for me was **no sensitivity**, which had been a major issue with every other whitening method I'd tried before.

# What Sets Laughland Apart from Other Whitening Products?

To really see if Laughland was the **best at-home teeth whitening**, I compared it to products I'd used previously:

* **Whitening Strips:** Worked slowly and caused sensitivity, results uneven.
* **Whitening Toothpaste:** Didn't really whiten, just cleaned surface stains.
* **Professional Whitening (Dentist):** Very effective, but expensive and hard on sensitive teeth.

Laughland seemed like a great middle-ground option—results close to professional whitening, without the pain or high cost.

# How Does the LED Light Help Whiten Teeth?

Before trying Laughland, I wasn't totally sure if LED lights did anything. After researching and testing it myself, here's the deal:

The LED itself doesn't whiten your teeth directly. Instead, it helps activate the whitening gel, making the gel work quicker and more effectively. That's why results came faster than with strips or toothpaste alone.

# Tips for Getting the Best Results

* **Be consistent:** Use Laughland daily for best results.
* **Cut back on staining foods/drinks:** Coffee, tea, and wine can slow progress.
* **Keep brushing and flossing:** Helps maintain results longer.

# Final Thoughts – Is Laughland the Best At-Home Teeth Whitening?

For me, Laughland hit all the marks:

* Noticeable results within a week.
* Zero tooth sensitivity.
* Easy to use daily without hassle.

Would I say it's better than professional dentist treatments? Probably not if you're looking for dramatic Hollywood-white teeth overnight. But if you're like me and want something effective, affordable, and gentle enough for everyday use, it's worth checking out.

I want that hometown feeling of seeing familiar faces and having stomping grounds. It sounds old-fashioned and even naive, but that’s what I crave. I don’t want to be the guy always wearing headphones or with his head buried in his laptop at Starbucks. Not that there’s anything wrong with that, it’s just not the lifestyle I want.

*   **Professional Cleaning:** Consider professional upholstery cleaning every year or two to keep your ottoman looking fresh and new.

Country: Equitorial Guinea (Malabo island to be exact). Symptom seen both with trying wireguard on wifi, as well as wireguard on the local phone 4g data 

Issue: for a few hours, wireguard works perfectly fine (it's a travel router / wireguard config port 124 mtu 1420 going back to my home residential ip in USA). All my devices are set to US timezone.

But after a few hours of use, wireguard just stops working. I can toggle it on/off a bit or use a regenerated config, and it works again sometimes, but often the only resolution is for me to just turn off everything and go for lunch/coffee etc, come back after 2-3 hours and then it's working again. (The wifi itself is working fine it's not an issue, there's definitely some sort of VPN/wireguard block, but it only manifests itself intermittently).

Of note, this country blocks WhatsApp video calls similar to UAE/Qatar etc, and I talked to the phone company reps here in person who did mention something about VPNs not being allowed, so there must be some govt filter, but even so, what kind of filter is it technically that only blocks intermittently but not always? 

I would assume if it's a block like Qatar/China etc, the block would be happening 24/7, not just randomly? How can I resolve this issue if someone else has experienced it, besides taking forced coffee breaks.",2,1744096669.0,WireGuard,0,1.0,False

And we're getting married soon. (I'm not breaking up with him. I want to find a way to make it work)

Context:
- Boyfriend is the engineer turned consultant turned start-up PM. He works for atleast 15 hours a day? I don't track it but he works all the time. Even Sundays.

- I'm in the creative field and work in a studio. I work project basis so I sometimes work 5 hours a day and sometimes 20 hours a day. It depends on the nature of client and projects I do.

- With my 3 YOE my CTC is in the 20LPA to 30 range. With his 8YOE his is in 25LPA to 35. (This matters because I don't comments telling me that he's the provider and I am the rider. So be okay with what he does)

- We split all our bills 50-50. Even coffees are on splitwise. So, he doesn't take my money. And I don't take his either. 

Background about boyfriend:

So, the thing is my boyfriend has always been the workaholic and it's been this way for the last 20 years. He always felt he wasn't good enough, academically qualified enough (his cousins went to IITs) so he's felt that his life purpose is to work and get the bestever CV on the planet. 

When he's not working he works on his hobbies. He loves water sports and does a lot of trips (nationally and internationally) maybe 4 trips a year

Problem I feel is:

He doesn't dedicate that amount of time + effort he does for work + hobbies -- for:

1. Managing the house: Regular cleaning / housekeeping / house improvements 

2. Managing relationship with me: whether it is planning a wedding together (I planned our whole wedding 99% of it - with no parents help because I didn't want to tire parents out) or planning trips or celebrating occasions. He hates birthdays. Hates it so much that he won't remember to call and wish. If he forgets he forgets.

3. Managing relationship with parents: I don't have siblings so I manage parent's and grandparents' needs on my own. His sibling left country so he mostly manages them by himself too. He pays his parent's credit card bills but, doesn't push them to have fun, organise trips, host lunches for them or my parents. I do all that. All of it.

And if I make the effort to do something and ask for 50% of his help. He says: ""who asked you to do it?"" ""I'm perfectly happy doing nothing"" ""MY PARENTS ARE HAPPY SITTING AT HOME, NOBODY ASKED FOR IT""

So, how do I make him understand that life is not about just a CV or his hobbies. There's more to it. And I can't keep doing everything without help? 

I'm posting her because I want suggestions from people that are like him and from people that have lived with such personalities.

With more tech teams going hybrid or fully remote, onboarding has become *a lot* more complex than just a first-day checklist. We recently published a blog post breaking down how tech companies are **reinventing onboarding** to make it seamless, inclusive, and effective — from Day One. 🚀

If you're in HR, team leadership, or just scaling a distributed team, here’s a sneak peek of what we cover:

✅ **The Hybrid Challenge:**

* Loss of informal learning moments (no more ""overheard at the coffee machine"")
* Unequal onboarding experiences for remote vs. in-office hires
* Localization needs + GDPR compliance (a big one in Europe!)

✅ **What Great Onboarding Looks Like Today:**

* Pre-boarding that starts *before* Day One
* 30-60-90 day plans that guide new hires step-by-step
* A healthy balance of automation + real human support
* Feedback loops from day 7 onward to improve the process continuously

✅ **Tools Tech Teams Are Using:**

* Notion, Slack, Trello, Loom, Miro, and LMS platforms
* Automation workflows inside HRIS systems
* GDPR-safe onboarding documentation

✅ **Don’t Forget Culture:**

* Build trust and psychological safety early
* Create rituals like “Intro Fridays” or virtual coffee chats
* Assign buddies based on region/time zone

✅ **And Yes — It’s Measurable:**

* Onboarding satisfaction scores
* Time to productivity (e.g. first pull request)
* Manager & buddy feedback loops

This blog gives practical, tactical advice and showcases real examples from companies. If you're looking to upgrade your onboarding strategy for hybrid/remote setups — it’s worth the read.

After an incredible year of development, I’m happy to finally launch **Tale**, an innovative social platform where people can collaboratively create stories. It’s been an amazing journey to turn this idea into reality, and now I’m looking for feedback from the community.

**About Tale**:  
Tale is a space where anyone can start a story and watch it evolve through the contributions of others. Users can add to stories, vote on contributions, and enjoy a community-driven creative experience. It’s essentially a social network built around collective storytelling, making creativity more interactive and inclusive.

**Technologies Used**:

* **Flutter** for cross-platform mobile development
* **Firebase** and **Firestore** for backend and database services
* **Cloud Functions** to run server-side code
* **ML Kit** for text language recognition (to keep the story in the same language on each contribution and recognize the incipit language)
* **Firebase Push Notifications** to keep users updated on story developments and new followers.

I would love to hear any feedback from you! What features would you love to see? How could we make the storytelling experience even better? Let me know your thoughts!

The app is totally free, no ads in it!

It’s still hard to say that word, even though I know that’s what happened. I’ve replayed the night over and over, trying to find a moment where I could have changed things. But the truth is, the only person responsible is him.

I was in Japan with friends—first Osaka, then Tokyo, the last stretch of what was supposed to be the trip of a lifetime. We’d just finished a night exploring Shibuya when we met a group of Americans drinking outside. A goth-looking girl barely said ""hey"" before disappearing. One guy, Matt, struck up a conversation and said he could show us around the local ""emo bars"" the next night. He seemed friendly and outgoing. I don’t use Instagram or Facebook, so I gave him my phone number.

We were texting back and forth. When we finally met a few weeks later, my friends were too tired to go out, so I met him alone in Shibuya. When I arrived at Rockaholic, he wasn’t with any friends. Matt did all the talking. At the bar, he showed me pictures of what he said was his two-bedroom apartment with a recording studio and a cat. It looked clean and cozy—totally normal.

I had one rum and coke. He bought me another.

The next thing I remember is waking up completely naked on the floor of a filthy room. No mattress, no pillow, no blanket—just a pile of my clothes near some guitar equipment. The only furniture in the place was a dirty fridge, a TV stand with no TV, and a single bed. I had no idea where I was, but later found out it was in Chiba—far from where we started. A different prefecture altogether, and not Suginami like he’d said.

He was in the bed, fully clothed, weird white noise music playing. My phone was on charge.

I felt sick. Disoriented. Violated.

I didn’t remember getting there. I didn’t remember undressing. I didn’t consent.

When I asked what happened, he smiled and said we got drunk and had sex. I told him I didn’t consent. That he raped me. He tried to play it off, tried to put his arm around me, told me I ""shouldn’t worry"" because he didn’t come inside me and had ""cleaned me up.""

I have flashbacks of him cleaning himself off my stomach. That moment haunts me. I never said yes. I never had a chance to say anything at all.

I just wanted to get away. I grabbed my things and told him I was heading to the station. Instead, I went to the nearest convenience store, bought a coffee to calm my nerves, and called a taxi back to my hostel. I sat in the shower for what felt like hours.

Later, he sent me a picture of my necklace—one I’d looked for before I left. I know he kept it intentionally. A manipulation tactic. A way to lure me back.

When I got back to the UK, I went straight to my local NHS clinic. I was tested for everything. I was raped, and because of him, I now have HSV-1 and HSV-2. A lifelong reminder.

I should have gone to the police. I should have done a lot of things. But at the time, I just wanted to feel safe again.

His name is **Matt** from LA, probably around 36 years old, though he looks older. He has a band called **FaveRiot**. When I looked him up through a friend’s account, I saw him wearing my necklace in one of his band photos. I felt used all over again.

I want to warn other women. (TW: sexual assault)","I’ve gone back and forth about sharing this. It’s been almost a year, and I’ve spent that time trying to heal, trying to move on. But I don’t think I ever truly will. And if speaking up can stop someone else from going through what I did, then it’s worth it.

In March 2024, while traveling in Tokyo, I was

It’s still hard to say that word, even though I know that’s what happened. I’ve replayed the night over and over, trying to find a moment where I could have changed things. But the truth is, the only person responsible is him.

I was in Japan with friends—first Osaka, then Tokyo, the last stretch of what was supposed to be the trip of a lifetime. We’d just finished a night exploring Shibuya when we met a group of Americans drinking outside. A goth-looking girl barely said ""hey"" before disappearing. One guy, Matt, struck up a conversation and said he could show us around the local ""emo bars"" the next night. He seemed friendly and outgoing. I don’t use Instagram or Facebook, so I gave him my phone number.

We were texting back and forth. When we finally met a few weeks later, my friends were too tired to go out, so I met him alone in Shibuya. When I arrived at Rockaholic, he wasn’t with any friends. Matt did all the talking. At the bar, he showed me pictures of what he said was his two-bedroom apartment with a recording studio and a cat. It looked clean and cozy—totally normal.

I had one rum and coke. He bought me another.

The next thing I remember is waking up completely naked on the floor of a filthy room. No mattress, no pillow, no blanket—just a pile of my clothes near some guitar equipment. The only furniture in the place was a dirty fridge, a TV stand with no TV, and a single bed. I had no idea where I was, but later found out it was in Chiba—far from where we started. A different prefecture altogether, and not Suginami like he’d said.

He was in the bed, fully clothed, weird white noise music playing. My phone was on charge.

I felt sick. Disoriented. Violated.

I didn’t remember getting there. I didn’t remember undressing. I didn’t consent.

When I asked what happened, he smiled and said we got drunk and had sex. I told him I didn’t consent. That he raped me. He tried to play it off, tried to put his arm around me, told me I ""shouldn’t worry"" because he didn’t come inside me and had ""cleaned me up.""

I have flashbacks of him cleaning himself off my stomach. That moment haunts me. I never said yes. I never had a chance to say anything at all.

I just wanted to get away. I grabbed my things and told him I was heading to the station. Instead, I went to the nearest convenience store, bought a coffee to calm my nerves, and called a taxi back to my hostel. I sat in the shower for what felt like hours.

Later, he sent me a picture of my necklace—one I’d looked for before I left. I know he kept it intentionally. A manipulation tactic. A way to lure me back.

When I got back to the UK, I went straight to my local NHS clinic. I was tested for everything. I was raped, and because of him, I now have HSV-1 and HSV-2. A lifelong reminder.

I should have gone to the police. I should have done a lot of things. But at the time, I just wanted to feel safe again.

His name is **Matt** from LA, probably around 36 years old, though he looks older. He has a band called **FaveRiot**. When I looked him up through a friend’s account, I saw him wearing my necklace in one of his band photos. I felt used all over again.

I don’t know what happens next. Maybe nothing. But I do know this: I refuse to carry his shame.

If you’re reading this and you've gone through something similar—you're not alone. And if you think it can’t happen to you… I used to think that too.

1ju7e2c,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ju7e2c,Whirlwind Trip March 26 to April 3,"My partner and I booked an eight night trip to Paris just nine days prior. We used tips from this sub and elsewhere online to coordinate our itinerary providing a mix of scheduled and flexible activities.



# Highlights:

* Best Day: Musée d'Orsay in the morning with the Le Walk tour. We paired both of our airpods with the same phone to ensure we were synced. We took lunch at Le Relais de l’Entrecôte (30 minute wait, €92.50 for two including a bottle of wine). We boarded the metro to Montmartre and did the ""Artists and Dreamers"" Le Walk tour and saw the places important to people we learned about in d'Orsay.
* The boulangerie down the street from our Aparthotel in Clichy provided us with two croissants, two double espressos, and would pack us two incredible baguette sandwiches for lunch for €18.85. We finished our coffees at their little counter by the window every morning and pulling out the sandwiches at lunchtime was always something we looked forward to.
* The Sewer Museum (now referred to by us exclusively as the Musée Dookie) was unexpectedly fun and it was hilarious watching school groups in hi-vis vests enter the ""wet gallery"" and their sounds of disgust when they realized the smell. Definitely glad we had finished our lunch a few hours prior.
* We made Versailles a day trip. We took the train and walked to the Palace from the station. The Versailles Palace app audioguide was excellent. The Trianon was an unexpected highlight of the trip, especially as it was considerably less busy than the Palace.
* The public transit efficiency was awe-inspiring to me. Except for days we knew we were only going to need a couple of trips (for example when going to/from airport, or when we went to Versailles all day) it was great to just get the day pass to the entire city for €12/person and we would hop on and off the bus, tram, metro, or RER to get between locations. You end up walking around and seeing a ton of the city no matter what, but the day pass saves you from staying too close to the tourist hotspots for the day and it also prevents you from completely wearing out your feet walking constantly. As mentioned frequently on this sub, taking the bus was a great way to see parts of the city you were not intentionally visiting.
* The weather was really lovely. The flowers are blooming and grass is green. A long-sleeved shirt was enough except on the one day it rained in the evening. It was almost a little hot in some of the museums/attractions. I'm glad it wasn't the peak season.



# What I wish we had done differently:

* We took a ""guided"" tour to Giverny to visit Monet's gardens and house. A guide talked at us for an hour on the bus and the tour company had an audio tour we could listen to on our phones if we had their app downloaded when we got there, but you were not permitted to use it inside the house. We should have just taken the train to Giverny and then the bus/shuttle to the gardens. We could have read Wikipedia on the 2 hr train ride to learn more than the audioguide and tour guide could offer. I would recommend the train/shuttle option unless you have aversions to public transit as it would have saved us approximately €140/person and only cost us 2 hours extra in transit.
* I was hyped for the catacombs but it was a bit of a letdown. The audioguide (free) gave you an explanation for their existence and development over the years but the fellow tourists treated it like an instagram photo-op. It felt a little weird to see people posing and making faces in front of the remains of someone who lived, was loved, and was grieved when they died. Overall I am glad I went so that I could decide for myself but if someone was on the fence about going I would say to pass it up. 



Overall, was an unforgettable experience for both of us and an entirely positive vacation. I hope to return someday soon and build on the experience we gained from this trip to improve our experience next time.

Could someone share if they experienced side effects on Dexedrine that went away with time?

I started at 2.5 mg because I’m extremely sensitive — for example, I can’t tolerate coffee.
Even this low dose still makes me feel jittery and anxious. My hands shake a bit like I did drink too strong cup of coffee. 

I’m wondering if this might pass with time, or if it’s a sign that Dexedrine just isn’t right for me. I’ll definitely take a lower dose tomorrow — luckily, the 5 mg pill is already scored into four parts.

Dexedrine feels like my last option, as I’ve already tried all the other stimulants and non-stimulants out there. My ADHD is brutal combined with CPTSD.

however, last night i took a dose of CBD, just to enjoy the moment better. and while i expected to be a lot more relaxed, my mind really freed itself a little. it was really noticeable to my gf, but more by myself. i could think a lot more straightly, my brain fog reduced, etc.

i'm wondering if continuing to take CBD (in the dosage i took last night, 10 mg) would be better or worse for my overall productivity? thank you",1,1744094025.0,productivity,1,1.0,False

1ju71fg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1ju71fg/extremely_difficult_time_loosing_weight/,Extremely difficult time loosing weight,"I’ve had a problem with weight since I was a kid, gaining weight with ease, and loosing it with extreme difficulty. When I’ve asked doctors about this, I don’t seem to get help on the matter. What could be my issue?

Some context:

Thyroid levels come back normal.

Yes I’m making sure I’m in a calorie deficit. No I’m not overeating without recognizing it or not counting everything, I’m so tired of hearing that in response to those who have difficulty loosing weight. I either measure things, or I’m eating things that come in prepackaged servings. I’m including also even the sugar and cream that go into my coffee.

I’ve been at points where all I was eating most days was a couple rice cakes with a thin layer of peanut butter for weeks on end (not having cheat days either). I’d be ultimately consuming ~500 calories a day and after some initial losses (still very slow losses) I’d barely be losing weight. I’ve actually been hospitalized before after a prolonged period of extreme deficit dieting like that because my vitamin levels were so low my heart was in very very critical danger of stopping. The hospital was dumbfounded because they said usually they see such issues in extreme anorexics, and yet I looked to them like I could loose weight (note I didn’t disclose my eating habits).

This has been going since I was a kid. I have a parent who teaches health & nutrition (at a college not for a MLM) and so my meals were always low calorie and healthy, yet I was a chubby kid. The same diet that will have me gaining weight, will have my family (that I live with and eat with) dropping pounds.

An aspect of this is that I also don’t really ever feel full, nor have I really ever. There are times when I have had cheat days, holidays or extremely stressful days, and no matter how much I eat, I don’t really ever feel full. I can just keep eating and eating until I feel like I’m about to burst and vaguely feel full, and then 20 minutes later I’ll feel hungry again.

I’m so tired of this. Like so tired. I’ve spent years of my life in restriction… struggling to maintain extreme diets just to look slightly pudgy at absolute best. You may think I just have an image problem and would show you a picture of a skeletal being, but if I showed you pictures (which I’m not for privacy reasons) you’d see that is not the case. I’m really at my wits end, because when I’ve mentioned these issues to doctors, I don’t get much help. At this point it’s ruining my mental health and causing me a lot of grief. Please, if you have an idea of what the issue could be, speak up!

1ju6zye,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1ju6zye/aio_for_demanding_my_husband_get_rid_of_his/,AIO for demanding my husband get rid of his electric kettle?,"My husband bought a Bodum Gooseneck electric kettle a few months back. One night a few weeks ago right before we were going to bed, I noticed the orange light on it was on, there was condensation on it and it was steaming, and not far from the heating plate on the counter, was as a kitchen towel. The asked husband why it was on since we were going to bed, and he didn’t know it was on. He turned it off, but I then tested the power button, and it was like a light tap was enough to turn it in. So apparently, he had turned it on by accident and never knew. I immediately told him I didn’t want it, something that could turn on that easily without us knowing, and could’ve lit the towel on fire. (It didn’t help that I’d just finished watching This Is Us for the first time a month or so before this happened). He refused to get rid of it and said he’d just remember to unplug it from now on.
I love my husband, but I knew right away that didn’t mean a damn thing. He is so incredibly scatterbrained he can’t remember anything he says he’ll do. And tonight, before going to bed, I noticed once again, that he left it plugged in. Our kitchen it small, he’s the primary cook, loves to cook, loves to make coffee, has more gadgets and gizmos than I would like us to have with very little space. I say this to make the point that our counters and such are often cluttered and there’s little room. To make it worse, we also have cats. Cats who against my rules, he allows to jump on the counters. Therefore, they could easily walk across and tap the sensitive switch and turn it on. I do not want the damn kettle. I told him tonight I’m getting rid of it, I don’t care if he likes it, I’m not comfortable with it in the house. If he’s not responsible enough to manage it and unplug it after every use, it’s not my job to go behind him every night checking the appliances because I’m anxious he might’ve left something on or plugged in. It’s easier to not have it period. He says I’m overreacting and he likes it and he’ll be careful, but he’s just proven he isn’t. Am I overreacting?

TL;DR: I want to get rid of my husbands electric kettle that has a hair trigger switch that turned on once before without our knowledge. We noticed it because it started sweating and steaming and there was a towel on the counter close to the heating mechanism. It couldve started a fire so I told him I didn’t want it in the house. He said he’d be careful to unplug it every time but tonight he forget again. We also have cats who could accidentally trigger the switch in our sleep. I told him tonight that I’m getting rid of it and he thinks I’m overreacting. Am I?",1,1744093463.0,AmIOverreacting,32,0.67,False

A Little About Me:

Hey you! I’m a 36-year-old professional overthinker from Europe, armed with a PhD in sarcasm and a master's degree in memeology. I love my motorcycle more than I love most people (sorry, not sorry). When i'm not riding my motorcycle, i'm either traveling, gaming, or pretending I’m an extrovert with friends. 

I asked a librarian once if the library had any books on paranoia; she whispered, “They’re right behind you.”.... i hvn't visited a library eversince...🤣🤣🤣fuckthat! 

My life’s chaotic, but I’m here to embrace the chaos with laughter and questionable life decisions.

Quickfire Facts About Yours Truly:

🏍 Motorcycles are my therapy. Don’t ask me how many I’ve almost bought on impulse.

💪🏽 All my leftover energy gets released at the gym.

🎮 Board/video games champion. (Trash talk included for free.)

☕ Starbucks owns my wallet.

🍕 Pineapple on pizza does belong there, fight me.

🍷 Red wine > beer. No arguments.

📸 Your pic gets you mine. Bonus points if you have a cute pet.🐕


About the pineapple on pizza discussion. Just hear me out okay?

Pineapple on pizza is like that one quirky friend you didn't ask for it, but now the party's better because they're there. Plus, it’s fruit, so technically, it makes pizza a salad. You're welcome.....😌🤣

Closing Argument:
If you’re looking for a partner-in-crime who will take you on wild motorcycle rides, crush you at Mario Kart, and debate pizza toppings with unshakable confidence, slide into my DMs. If not, may your coffee be hot, your Wi-Fi fast, and your day lovely. 😊🍷👋🏽
