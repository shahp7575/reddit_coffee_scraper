Zero tokens. I laughed at first, then checked Discord and realized half the people I’d been grinding with for a year got the same red banner. Turns out sending faucet funds to your own alts was apparently the fastest way to get flagged as a sybil. Who knew? A week later, I’m seeing screenshots of Azuki whales and Farcaster power users pulling 15–20k $MON each without ever touching the testnet. Feels bad, man.  
  
Bitget just dropped their listing announcement, and suddenly I’m curious again. Part of me wants to watch the price get obliterated on open just for the schadenfreude, still another part remembers how clean the testnet actually felt, like, 500 ms finality with full EVM tooling is legitimately insane. The numbers are brutal, though: 100 billion total supply, roughly 10.8 billion tokens hitting the market tomorrow between the public sale and airdrop, and a lot of those airdropped wallets are people who never cared about the chain in the first place. My gut says we open somewhere around 4-6 cents, then the “thank you, next” crowd starts dumping, and we see 2-3 cents pretty quick. Wouldn’t shock me to wick below the $0.025 sale price in the first hour.  
  
Still going to watch the charts with coffee tomorrow, though. There’s something weirdly entertaining about seeing a project you bled for finally trade while you sit on the sidelines with nothing but screenshots of your old testnet transactions. If it somehow holds $0.05 and rips from there, I’ll tip my hat. If it face-plants to a billion-dollar FDV in a bear market, well… at least I’ll know my faucet-spamming wasn’t completely pointless; it kept me out of the exit liquidity.

I'm curious for anyone else pulling singles with this kind of setup (so, not Flair Classic, which is a similar diameter but not as shallow of a puck) — do you approach single shots any differently than your double shots? 

I am just looking to calibrate my expectations and seeing if there's any interesting ideas I could explore. I have my current coffee dialed in and I'm having to pull a bit longer ratio at lower bar. Not sure if that's just the coffee (it is a light roast) or if the single basket is factoring in.

1p4qh9y,https://www.reddit.com/r/DispatchAdHoc/comments/1p4qh9y/going_deeper_into_robert_as_a_character_would_be/,Going deeper into Robert as a character would be a good plot point for S2,"I've seen discussion about Robert's character for the last couple of days, and it got me thinking about it as well, specifically how little the game highlights the darker parts of his persona. Admittedly S1 probably wasn't the best place to delve into the intricacies of Robert's character, especially since the main focus of the story was redeeming the Z-team and journeying through uncharted territories of working an office job. By the end everything seems to have wrapped itself in a neat bow: he has a shiny new suit and potential love interest.

But the tidbits we get from Robert's monologues or snippets of past lore come together to paint a picture of a incredibly broken man with issues that remain unresolved by the ending of S1.

\- From the facts made known in-game and comics, we can reasonably assume that Robert is around late 20s\~early 30s of age. We know that he has been active as Mecha Man since the passing of his father, which was 15 years ago. Putting Robert as roughly 30, he's spent almost half of his life in the metal suit since around 15. Even if we assume that he didn't immediately go full-time hero, He barely made it out of school and has since lived a life shut out from any social setting or close acquaintances that we know of. 

\- We know that his main source of funding came from his inheritance and insurance money, and that they've since run dry from constantly needing to maintain and repair his suit. His apartment is nearly completely empty, and all we've really seen of his appliances is the single chair Toxic was tied to + the pillow Beef sleeps on, plus the most basic kitchen & bathroom appliances (though he did manage a coffee machine, priorities.). It's apparent that he doesn't have/can't afford any hobbies, nor is he particularly interested in spending for smaller pleasures in life apart from an occasional snack or alcohol. 

\- His relationship with his father was far from healthy, in the typical Tony-Howard Stark kind of way. It's clear that the adult Robert hasn't moved on from those scars, and according to the dialogue choices, are among the main contributing factors that led Robert to push himself as hard as he did to continue the Mecha Man legacy. Though he does 'avenge' his father one way or the other in the S1 finale, it's hard to say if this is enough for him to make peace with his insecurities.

Following from all that, it's clear that Robert has pretty much abandoned his social and economic life to continue his work as Mecha Man. Abandoned not as in sacrificed pre-existing stability, but abandoned as in '*has never experienced a healthy and socially functioning adult life*' kind of way. His quippy attitude and charismatic demeanor mask these darker parts of his character, to the point where the only ones even remotely aware of them are Chase and Blazer.

Not sure how they plan to continue on the 'dispatching' part of the story in S2, but now that there's nothing stopping Robert from reclaiming his life as Mecha Man I'm interested in how those issues might resurface, and if the presence of Visi/Blazer and the Z team might impact him for the better or worse. It might even show up as a source of major conflict, as balancing personal life and the hero life often does is the superhero genre.  ",1,1763914125.0,DispatchAdHoc,0,1.0,False

The NCAA Cross Country Championships drew one of the largest crowds Gans Creek has ever seen — and that turnout is expected to bring in more than a million dollars into the local economy.

Mizzou Cross Country Assistant Head Coach Paige Duca confirmed to ABC 17 News on Saturday that 6,085 tickets were sold for Saturday’s meet. By comparison, the NCAA reported on social media that roughly 5,000 tickets were sold for the 2023 championship at the University of Virginia, a number that reflected a sold out crowd.

With a crowd this large, some traffic was expected. After the meet concluded around noon, Route 63 experienced minor congestion comparable to typical rush-hour traffic. Meanwhile, East Gans Road, Bristol Lake Parkway, and Discovery Parkway remained clear due to the shuttle services that helped alleviate traffic.

Large school buses acted as shuttles, transporting thousands of fans back to their vehicles throughout the morning. Fans traveling from several hours away said parking and shuttles were easy to navigate.

""I had a great experience. I pulled up to the parking lot that I had a ticket with and the shuttle was pretty much ready to go. It took like 5 minutes to get here. I didn't have any traffic getting here,"" David Mannella said.

Many attendees complimented the city and university for organizing a smooth, well-executed event.

Megan McConachie with the Columbia Convention and Visitors Bureau told ABC 17 News about the extensive planning and logistics involved in hosting the meet.

""The turnout is amazing,"" Head Coach at the University of Oklahoma James Thomas said. . ""It's almost impossible to navigate in person because it's a huge turnout for a cross-country event. I've been to about five or six of them in my day. This was my second time as a head coach and I haven't seen anything like it, so far incredible.""

Saturday’s championship announcer David Lile said the event was years in the making.

“Some of the Parks and Recreation guys were hired five years ago and this was immediately their concern. So, this took a lot of work by a lot of people in this community,” Lile said.

2024 Olympian Isabella Whittaker was among those in attendance and said Gans Creek is a spectator-friendly cross-country venue.

“I think it was great because I got to see her [her sister, Juliette Whittaker] run several times throughout the race. The course is built very well for spectators,” Whittaker said.

The crowds didn’t just fill the concourse — they filled the city. The Columbia Convention and Visitors Bureau estimates the event will bring in $1.2 million.

Lester Hampton, father of former Mizzou Track and Field star Gabi Jacobs-- who recently competed at the 2025 Outdoor World Championship in Tokyo-- said he visits Columbia often. When he’s in town, he said his daughter always takes him to local favorites, like Booches and the Broadway Diner.

Stanford athlete Juliette Whittaker told ABC 17 News the team enjoyed a group dinner at Addison’s restaurant downtown earlier in the week. She said she and Stanford alumni explored the city during their free time and noticed an unmistakable “championship atmosphere,” with athletes and families filling nearly every corner of downtown.

Local businesses also felt the rush. On Thursday, ABC 17 News spoke with The Park Restaurant, located just minutes from Gans Creek, which reported an influx of customers tied to the championship. Another business, the Travelin Tom’s Coffee pop-up truck, set up directly in the course’s parking lot and served spectators for hours.

""It's been super busy all morning, but we love it,"" Jackson Deney, an employee said. ""It's a really big community event and we love to come to stuff like this.""

Deney said they were told to prepare for roughly 5,000 customers. He could not provide an exact number of drinks sold but estimated the total to be well over a thousand.

Mizzou coaches and the Columbia Convention and Visitors Bureau told ABC 17 News that they would welcome the opportunity to host more major championships in the future.",1,1763914079.0,columbiamo,0,1.0,False

This made me look out for apps that might make this 50x easier, sadly there where some apps, but  most where to old or had major flaws in my opinion. 
Therefore my ambitions side, thought why not invent an app that is able to handel such perfect. 

Therefore i created inflam Ai
Its an app where you can do pain tracking, take  40 assessments to keep track about your diseas. Also i do have an Workout/ Exercise part integrated, where you can save the Exercises from your Physiology. 

My plan is to build an Maschine Learning Modell that is 1) Able to see or detect patterns into your life, for example that coffee.. which lead to worse sleep --> more pain. Secondly to be able to have insights / warnings about higher disease activity, so you dont wake up on a morning and all your plans are ruined. Therefore i plan to predict such mini flare ups 3-7 days in advance. 

One thing to note, the app runs completely on your device. Even later when i would be able to build an ML Modell, it would fully stay offline.

The Part where i would need your help and would offer you something. 
There arent any good data recourses out there which makes it hard to create an ML modell, that could help. 

Im opening a Githup Repository soon, where you would be able to download the app onto your Macbook/ Imac ... and then could deploy the app onto your iPhone.
In exchange i would love if you would give me the data that you collect.

--> if you dont know how to do that, i could help you with setting it up :-)


To give you a understanding of which parts are required to have for using this app in such an early stage: 
• iMac / MacBook or any Apple desktop device 
• iPhone 11 or newer 
• apple watch Series 6 / Se 1 or newer 



Im planning to release this app for a little subscription later or if you life in germany, you would be able to get the app via a recept from your doctor and wont have to pay anything. 

Beforehand im realsing this app im planing to go this route 


Get investments 

|
|

Employ a Rheumatologist & a professional developer to make this app perfect 

|
|
 
Launch a study to test it to its limits 

|
|
Bring it to the App store 


Depending on how big the budget / investment will be ,i might even be able to bring out a Andriod version out at the same time as the app store launch. 





Firstly i want to apologise that i talked so much tech stuff , finance & i that sadly for using the app you need to have these things above. 





Even if you dont feel comfortable sharing data with me or don't meet the points from device Perspektive.

I would still appreciate a feedback onto the ideas, how the app looks or any other concerns.. ideas anything that you would wish or not wish for. 
Even if you say, thats a shitty idea i wouldnt use any of this... i would love to get the feedback. 
Because the last thing i want to do is build an app which doesn't meet our standarts / wont help us. Therefore im very open for any point. 


If you are interested intesting the app answer with a 📱 then i will sent you the githup link 


Sry that the text is stacked with grammer mistakes :/

I just had a look at the kind of reviews and reception the Naked gun film received and i'm absolutely shocked to find its RT score is 87%. What on earth is going on?   
Have peoples standards dropped or is this what people find funny nowadays? Really obvious jokes and writing and basic slapstick. 

Comedy is obviously subjective and i know american humour can range from brilliant (Superbad) to the most mundane obvious shit where the joke is just repeated constantly, but 87% suggests that it's some brilliantly comical well written film when it quite clearly isn't. 

'how many things can we pack into a line of dialogue that makes constant reference to the fact that this film is a parody of itself and it's definitely a joke film so this is where you need to be laughing!

I am going to be taking a tester trip to Portland, OR this coming year in late May, early June. I am looking for a few neighborhoods to stay in/explore while I'm there for a couple weeks. 

  
I really enjoy sewing, crocheting, and knitting so I would love to be somewhat near an independent fabric shop and/or sewing studio. I also like to write so a good coffee shop is a must, though I feel that the factor is kind of null when it comes to Portland. I am also a big reader, so being near a good book store and/or library would be wonderful. I'm in the 55-60K range for salary range and I would be planning on living alone with two cats that are both registered ESAs.

I've been looking at the Alberta Arts District a lot but it seems there are just too many areas that would be really enjoyable to me.

I’m lean (162 cm/5'4, \~47 kg/104lbs, which technically puts me in the underweight range) but have PCOS confirmed by ultrasound. I have hirsutism, very irregular periods, chronic fatigue, and despite being underweight I still have stubborn fat around my stomach, lower back, and face. My acne gets much worse when I eat high-GI carbs. I also take sertraline 50 mg for MDD, and I’m starting to suspect it might be affecting my appetite and cravings.

My recent labs were normal for insulin resistance (fasting insulin 5.7, fasting glucose 83, HbA1c 5.3), and my thyroid numbers are normal. So it looks like I don’t have insulin resistance, which actually surprised me. What confuses me even more is that inositol made me extremely hungry even at low doses. I first tried around 2 g/day, then later 4 g, and every time I became ravenously hungry to the point where all I could think about was food. I stopped taking it because the hunger was overwhelming.

I’ve been eating low-GI, which cleared my acne a lot, but it hasn’t helped my cravings, fatigue, or body fat distribution. What’s strange is that at one point my cravings were actually better when I was eating very unhealthily. I’d drink coffee for half the day and then have small, very carby meals like instant ramen. My acne was terrible during that time, but my cravings were low. I did weigh a bit more then and probably had slightly more body fat than I do now.

I’m trying to figure out whether metformin is worth considering even without insulin resistance, whether sertraline could be playing a major role in my appetite and fat distribution issues, and what practical steps actually help with cravings, energy, and appetite swings in cases like this.

1p4qazk,https://www.reddit.com/r/BetterAtPeople/comments/1p4qazk/how_some_people_make_friends_so_easily_and_why_it/,How some people make friends so easily (and why it feels impossible for the rest of us),"Walk into any cafe, bar, or yoga class and you’ll swear some people have a \*cheat code\* for making friends. They walk in alone, leave with a group chat. You watch them from the sidelines, lowkey amazed, lowkey annoyed. Because for the rest of us? Asking someone to grab dinner feels like proposing marriage. 



This is especially true for adults trying to form new friendships without the built-in scaffolding of school, team sports, or shared trauma from a crappy internship. And for many queer folks, neurodiverse folks, or just shy humans who grew up overthinking everything? Approaching someone for a platonic hangout can feel way too loaded.



If you’ve ever hyped yourself up to ask someone to get coffee, then panicked because ""what if they think I'm hitting on them""same. You’re not weird for struggling. You’re wired to fear rejection. Blame evolution and also social media.



This is a breakdown of what actually works. Not the fluffy “just be yourself” stuff that TikTok keeps shouting. This comes from solid books, psych research, and behavioral science. Plus real people who’ve hacked adult friendship without cringing their way through forced mingling.  



\*If you’re ready to stop watching friendships happen like a spectator sport, here’s what helps:\*



\---



\* \*\*Friend-magnet people don’t “ask to hang out.” They offer a shared activity.\*\*

  \* According to Robin Dunbar, the psychologist known for the “Dunbar’s Number” theory (the idea that humans have a limit to how many stable relationships they can maintain), \*shared experiences\* are key to forming deeper connections. The fastest-growing friendships are built around \*doing\*, not just talking.

  \* Instead of saying “Wanna grab dinner sometime?”, say:

\* “Hey, I’m trying out this Thai spot in Valencia Tuesday night if you’re down.”

\* “I’m doing a solo museum run this weekend. Let me know if you’d want to come too.”

\* This makes it feel low-pressure, casual, and time-bound. You’re not asking them to evaluate your worth as a friend. You’re just inviting them into something already happening.



\* \*\*They pick “open” people, not “cool” people.\*\*

  \* The NYU psychologist Matthew Lieberman, author of \*Social: Why Our Brains Are Wired to Connect\*, found that humans subconsciously mirror each other’s emotional openness. Meaning: people who \*seem\* easy to chat with often \*are\*, because they’re sending cues that they’re socially available.

  \* Instead of approaching the person with perfect posture and airpod pros in, scan for people who make eye contact, smile, or even say something random out loud (especially in group settings).

  \* That one woman who cracks a joke to the cashier? 10 times more likely to say yes to your invite than the person who looks like a Pinterest board.



\* \*\*They use proximity to build warmth. Not small talk.\*\*

  \* A lot of adults try to start friendships with instant vulnerability or long convos. But psychologist Paul Bloom (author of \*The Sweet Spot\*) points out that most friendships form when we consistently see the same person over timeAKA, what researchers call the \*mere exposure effect\*.

  \* Translation: show up to the same events regularly. You don’t need to become BFFs on Day 1. Just be seen. Say a few words. Then say more next time.

\* Join a recurring book club or hobby group (Meetup, Eventbrite, even subreddits like r/SanFrancisco can help)

\* Go to the same workout class on the same day each week

\* Visit a weekly market, game night, or coworking space where people are open to casual convos

  \* Bonus: if you naturally run into someone more than once, it becomes easier and less awkward to slide into shared plans. “Hey, want to co-work next time?” becomes normal.



\* \*\*They signal “safe” energy by setting clear context and boundaries.\*\*

  \* One reason it feels scary to make new friends, especially across gender or sexuality lines is the risk of being misinterpreted. You want to seem friendly but not flirty, casual but not distant.

  \* Say your intention \*out loud.\* Normalize it. Context removes weirdness.

\* “I’ve been trying to be more social this year so I’m asking people out to random stuff. No pressure at all if it’s not your thing!”

\* “I’m trying to find more people to go on little adventure walks with. I love city but hate doing it alone.”

\* “I realized all my friends moved away and I miss weekday drinks that aren’t ‘networking’.”

  \* This takes people off high-alert. It frames the task as pro-social, not personal. And it gives the other person space to accept or decline without guilt.



\* \*\*They treat it like dating: there will be duds and it’s not that deep.\*\*

  \* Dr. Marisa Franco, in her book \*Platonic: How the Science of Attachment Can Help You Makeand KeepFriends\*, says most adults \*underestimate how much people like them\* after initial interactions.

  \* She calls this the “liking gap.” You think you came off awkward. They think you were fine.

  \* Friendship, like dating, is a volume game. Some people flake. Some say no. Some click magically. Don’t assign meaning to every weak response or one-off coffee.

\* This is what socially skilled people do differently: they keep the momentum going. They don’t wait for “friend chemistry.” They build it.

\* Treat it like reps. The more you reach out, the easier it gets. And the less rejection stings.



\* \*\*They deliberately invest in “weak ties” who later turn into strong ones.\*\*

  \* Sociologist Mark Granovetter's paper \*The Strength of Weak Ties\* is still one of the most cited in social science. The idea: acquaintances give us more opportunities than close friends, because they span diverse social circles.

  \* That acquaintance from your walking club? Might introduce you to your future roommate. That coworker you only eat lunch with? Might become your Sunday hiking buddy.

\* Instead of waiting for \*one\* best friend, tend to your ""friend garden."" A little watering across multiple people goes a long way.

\* Regularly initiate light touchpoints like:

\* Sending a Reel that reminded you of them

\* Inviting them to tag along on something you were already planning

\* Sharing a relevant event flyer or workshop you think they’d like



All of this is learnable. It’s not about being extroverted or smooth. It’s about having a few go-to scripts and understanding how human psychology works in your favor when you take initiative with warmth and clarity.



Books don’t lie. People want friends. Most people \*don’t\* I think it’s creepy when you ask to hang. They think it’s flattering, brave, and often... a little contagious.



If you’ve been overthinking it, try this: message 1 person today. Invite them to something casual and short. Make it specific. Keep it chill. Then do it again next week. Momentum is everything.",1,1763913709.0,BetterAtPeople,0,1.0,False

1p4q87z,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p4q87z,Disgusting behavior - losing all trust in our community,"Recently I was really excited to have finally scored an espresso machine on Vine, even if it is a cheap one that I knew wasn't going to make the ""best"" espresso. 

Fast forward to today after a week of detailed testing and this thing is truly garbage. It doesn't actually make espresso (more of a drip coffee at a 1:7 ratio you can't adjust), it doesn't get up to the advertised pressures (20 bar) and it has parts that are actually not possible to clean. I was disappointed but I left a review warning folks about these issues. 

Today I checked if Amazon approved that review and EVERY other review is rated five stars and clearly from people who didn't actually use the product. The first review is straight out of Chat GPT and talks about functions the machine doesn't even have, like a cold brew button (shame on you ""BrittNicole"" if you're in here), or that it brews at 20-bar. The machine literally tells you the working pressure on the front and the manufacturer says that it only brews at 9-bar even though it supposedly could reach 20 bar. 

Just blatant lies and misinformation of others. People like this are literally costing others in their community money, causing ruined birthdays/holidays with dishonest reviews of crap products, and only further supporting manufacturers who make garbage. I'm confident anyone using this, even the reviewers, would rate it at most 2 stars, and it's clear the five reviews so far are from folks who never even opened the box and probably just resold it. 

This entire situation has me reconsidering if participating in Vine is actually a good idea at all. How can we eliminate bad actors like this? Is there a method to email Vine and flag dishonest or inaccurate reviews? ",10,1763913549.0,AmazonVine,8,1.0,False

1p4q6xw,https://www.reddit.com/r/KerrCountyFloods/comments/1p4q6xw/seeking_aim_of_human_civilization/,seeking aim of human civilization,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",0,1763913463.0,KerrCountyFloods,0,0.2,False
1p4q6dj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1p4q6dj/a_review_of_exactly_half_of_the_current_cardinal/,a review of exactly half of the current Cardinal Scents catalog,"⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ perfect, will wear often & rebuy  

⭐⭐⭐⭐ I like this but doubt I'll ever need a fullsize

⭐⭐⭐ this is good for someone else 

⭐⭐ I would prefer to never smell this again 

⭐ had to scrub, big whomp experience 

_____

my biggest likes: salt, creamy, semisweet, clean musks, violets, fruit, aquatics, weird atmospherics 

my biggest no-no notes: smoke, cinnamon, incense, anything resembling a Christmas tree, dirty animalics

_____

**Blue Collar** oil (*cherry vape juice, black coffee, machine oil and coolant, a freshly ironed work shirt*)     

- The cherry opening is a bit odd to me, but gets so lovely in the drydown. Blended so well, you really have to concentrate to identify the individual notes. Slightly sweet but not overly femme.   
- Personal bubble of projection, all-day longevity.   
- ☕☕☕/5    

**Body Double** oil (*iris, amber, styrofoam, thermal paper, new clothes*)     

- Smells like green paint in the bottle, and no I can't explain further. This is delightfully weird, worth sampling just to experience the plastic-adjacent sweetness and the way that certain inorganic scents can feel comforting. I'll be keeping my sample for the novelty of it but I don't think I'd ever need to upsize.      
- Personal bubble of projection, not sure about longevity because I've only tested it before bed.    
- 👾👾👾👾/5     

**Circus Tears** oil (*buttered popcorn, lemonade, cedar shavings, salt*)     

- I got this one on a quest for a fairground scent featuring salt, a quest I've given up on because I tried half a dozen and realized I was never going to find one that I loved but would also wear regularly; we don't always understand what we actually want, you dig? This one was exactly what I was looking for but turns out I don't need more than a sample. Opens buttery popcorn, turns quickly to a cedary lemonade with an essence of salt.    
- Thinker pose level of projection and less than four hours of longevity, but both may be improved by applying more.     
- 🎪🎪🎪🎪/5    

**Familiar Spirit** EDP (*milk, white sage, sea salt, white amber*)     

- In the bottle you can immediately recognize the sage. On my skin, I am transported to the fanciest spa where I'm having the best time: I am moisturized, unbothered, sitting next to a giant salt lamp. This is my new obsession. The only reason I don't have a full bottle yet is because the edp hasn't been in stock since I fell in love.     
- Personal+ bubble of projection, six to ten hours of longevity depending on the day.     
- 🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️ infinity/5      

**Gentle Reader** EDP (*old book pages, vanillin, orris butter, vintage amber*)    

- In the bottle there's a clear impression of old books. On skin, this is a hyperrealistic old bookshop elevated by sweet amber, and the orris is more of a texture than a scent. This perfume transports me to a secondhand bookstore once owned by my friend's grandmother, but also reminds me of bookmarks at the scholastic book fair somehow. I will be buying a full bottle. It did take me two wears to really fall in love with it, and I do like to layer it with something else for a bit more complexity.      
- Personal bubble of projection, and an INSANE full day of longevity even when I've had a very active and stressful workday.     
- 📚📚📚📚📚/5     

**Girl Crush** oil (*hazelnut cappuccino, raspberry body spray, pear shampoo, warm skin musk*)     

- A gorgeous, nostalgic portrait of innocent romance and sapphic longing. Mostly hazelnut accented by the other notes, fairly linear but like a dance. I don't wear this often enough to need bigger than a sample, but I will replace the sample once it's panned. (I actually have to check whether there's real hazelnut involved as I recently developed an allergy to them, and haven't worn it since just in case.)     
- Personal+ level of projection, at least 4 hours of longevity with a slow but steady fade.   
- 🌰🌰🌰🌰/5    

**Indigo Child** oil (*grass, lake water, fruit punch, dry cedar planks, summer air*)      

- In the bottle this presents itself as a fruity aquatic, one of my favorite subcategories of perfume. On my skin, the sweet aquatic note persists but somehow feels artificial; the fruit punch note transforms into yellow orange juice as it hits my skin, and the cedar note feels oddly clean. This one is almost certainly a skin chemistry issue because it smells so differently on me than it does in the bottle. Didn't need to scrub it but will probably sell my sample.     
- Personal bubble of projection, 4+ hours of longevity with a slow but steady fade.      
- 🚣‍♀️🚣‍♀️/5 willing to believe it could be good on someone else, I suppose     

**Midnight Laundry** oil (*crushed violets, laundry detergent, cedar paneling, skin musk*)     

- Starts heavily laundry-scented, fades into a floral musk with maybe a hint of something fruity. For me this is best as a few drops under something else, like Sugar Haze.    
- Personal bubble of projection, 5-8 hours of projection depending on the day.    
- 🫧🫧🫧/5   

**Original Sin** oil (*crisp red apple, fig leaf, skin musk, dust of the earth*)   

- This was the one that originally interested me in this house in the first place! It's dusty dry dirt and fresh apples, very nice and I'm not sure why I don't reach for it more often. I'll probably try a sample of this as an EDP eventually.    
- Personal bubble of projection, I keep forgetting to note the longevity.   
- 🍎🍎🍎🍎/5       

**Rain Dance** EDP (*sweet pea, grape hyacinth, clover, dewy skin musk, spring rain*)      

- Pleasantly nostalgic, but why does it make me want to eat flowers like I'm a baby bunny here to ruin your garden? Realistic flowers but also candy flowers. Gets a bit ""fancy soap"" about halfway through the day but in a way that I find palatable. If you love grape hyacinth you will love this perfume.      
- Absolutely a powerhouse with a conversational bubble of projection with even just a single spray, and a full day of longevity (at full strength too, if you get some on fabric!) like 12+ hours at least.      
- 🪻🪻🪻🪻🪻/5     

**Rewind Button** oil (*florida orange juice, warm vhs tapes, cereal milk, tv static, line dried laundry*)     

- Wet this is warm orange juice and nothing else, in a distinctly not refreshing way. It quickly becomes a barely-there oj musk, and just clearly isn't meant for my skin.    
- Slightly less than a personal bubble of projection, longevity unknown because it was unpleasant enough that I washed it off after about a half hour.      
- 🍊/5 but it's probably a skin chemistry issue      

**Rose Baby** EDP (*candied rose, raspberry jam, marshmallow, sandalwood*)     

- Okay here's the thing: yes rose, and yes raspberry, but also somehow mostly salt-cured black olives? The impression of olives remained for the entire wear, which I actually didn't mind, because I love olives. I probably won't reach for this much though, because it's not often I wake up wanting to smell of olives.    
- Personal bubble of projection, and about five hours of longevity.      
- 🌹🌹🫒/5 (the third star is an olive, of course)     

**Sugar Haze** oil and EDP (*spun sugar, pink himalayan salt, sea amber, white musk*)     

- I got the oil in my first round of samples, and enjoyed it so much that I got the EDP in my second round. Now I can't decide which format to full-size! Immediately an addictive scent in both formats, though the oil definitely benefits from resting. Both are a salty sugar and the essence of a freshly baked crust of bread, and the edp wears ever so slightly sweeter than the oil.      
- Projection depends fully on how much you apply, anywhere from nothing to conversational.     
- 🌫️🌫️🌫️🌫️🌫️/5 for both formats     

**Thinking Cap** EDP (*earl grey tea, hard caramels, notebook paper, pencil dust*)     

- Bottle sniff was an exciting impression of pencil dust. Unfortunately, the entire wear experience was also (realistic, comforting) pencil dust and nothing else, because apparently I'm a pencil dust amper. It faded pretty quickly but when I woke up the next morning it was back with a hint of caramel finally making an appearance.      
- Personal bubble of projection, longevity a rollercoaster less than 4 hours but also somehow overnight.     
- ✏️✏️/5 (more stars if you're looking for just pencils)       

**Twice Shy** oil (*pistachio ice cream, black walnut, green amber, flushed skin*)     

- In the bottle I was confused by an impression of sour candy. And then when wearing it I was even more confused by further impressions of other candies, like maybe fundip or those bottle cap candies? The walnut is identifiable eventually, but maybe I'm just not excited by walnuts. The creaminess begins to settle in after a while, but it's more observable from a distance than it is up close.     
- Personal level of projection, longevity about six hours.        
- ❔❔/5 I feel unqualified to have an opinion, idk    

**Wish Fish** oil (*bamboo, guava candy, copper verdigris, fountain water*)     

- Oooooo this one is so cool. It's vaguely tropical, lightly aquatic, with a warm metallic aspect, but beyond that it's a smooth blend of summer vibes. Can't wait to try this one in warmer weather, and really curious how it wears as an edp. Really fascinating, and definitely olfactive art.     
- Personal bubble of projection, about 4 hours of total longevity though after about 3 hours it's down to a gentle ""post-swim skin"" scent.    
- ⛲⛲⛲⛲💧/5 (4.5 due to longevity)     

**Witch Hat** oil (*black plum, wormwood, caramel, patchouli*)    

- The plum comes through with an unsalted buttery note (maybe I'm just reading the caramel wrong?) grounded by a rough woody darkness. My partner is sensitive to strong smells finds this one abrasively overwhelming unless I wear far less of the oil than I usually do. Although! It's not the patchouli that's the culprit, this is actually a really gentle and subtle use of patchouli that I really enjoy, more of an enhancement than a presence. If I could wear more than four tiny drops at a time I'd be considering upsizing this.      
- Projection is anywhere from personal to conversational depending on how much is applied, and longevity is about five hours.     
- 🧙‍♀️🧙‍♀️🧙‍♀️🧙‍♀️/5       

In conclusion, I have a pretty high hit rate with Cardinal Scents and will be compulsively refreshing the website all morning in hopes that I can snag some Familiar Spirit EDP this round.

Recently I noticed that when I would take it off of charge, when it said fully charged, via the coffee cup icon, it would jump immediately down to 70 or 80% battery as soon as I unplugged it. 
Shortly after that started occurring I noticed that the watch would shut itself off due to ""no power"" yet when I would turn it back on it would last at least another 6 to 8 hours before fully shutting off and not being able to turn back on. 

I did a full battery calibration cycle by making sure the battery was 100% depleted and then charging it to full but the battery is still dropping down to 90% instantly as soon as I take it off the charger most times if not a lower percentage. 

Does anyone have any suggestions on why this might be occurring? Do I just have a bad battery? Does anyone have any suggestions on how I could rejuvenate the existing battery?

1p4q2t5,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrangeCountyGangs/comments/1p4q2t5/seeking_final_end_of_all_knowledges/,seeking final end of all knowledges,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1p4q2k1,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1p4q2k1/11_new_coffee_deals_this_week_usa_only/,11 New Coffee Deals This Week [USA Only],"I wanted to share some new deals from interesting roasters in the USA that I blogged about recently.

For those not familiar, BeanDeals started a couple months ago on a whim as an experiment. I started following as many roasters as I could find to test a hypothesis that there would be cool deals every day. The hypothesis proved correct, and that’s the back story of how I came to track 1,500+ roasters and launch a blog to share my findings with the community. Every day I look for the best 1 or 2 deals that stand out.   I'm excited that this week I past a milestone having now featured deals from more than 100 unique roasters (106 as of today).

This week has been busy with Black Friday deals rolling in. I've tried to be pretty selective with the deals I publish and really look for the best ones.  I blogged about 15 new deals, but 4 of them expired already. 11 new deals are live. Too many to mention all of them, but here are a few highlights:

1. [Sightglass](https://beandeals.com/sightglass-25-off-36-off/) (San Fran) - 25% off promo code, but what makes this deal great is you can stack it with their bundle sets for an extra 15% off (36% effective discount).  I highlight two of their more premium 3-pack bundles that include some single origins which are enough to get free shipping on their own.  Expires on Black Friday.
2. [Good Brothers](https://beandeals.com/good-brothers-25-off-roasted-coffee/) (Michigan) - This is a rare 25% off as this roaster does not do promotions often. They have a great lineup from a discounted rotating blend I mention to ultra premium beans, and I've personally enjoyed this roaster in the past.  Likely 4 bags for free shipping \~$15/bag.   I also like this deal for bulk buyers; you can get a 5lb bag of a nice espresso blend for $60.  Expires Cyber Monday.
3. [Foxtail](https://beandeals.com/foxtail-coffee-40-off-3-pack-bundle/) (Florida)  - 40% off on some select blends, plus I found a 20% off code that stacks with this for 52% off.  With this deal you can get a 3 bags shipped free for $10.40 / bag.  Great value.  Expires Wednesday.
4. [Opus Coffee](https://beandeals.com/opus-coffee-25-off/) (Florida) - This roaster has been popular in the past when we featured them at 20% off, and this deal is even better at 25% off.   At their cheapest prices you'll need 4 bags for free shipping, but you can easily do this with 3 bags by including 1 origin or some mid-priced blends.   They have a nice selection of premium origins.    Expires Thursday.
5. [Dancing Goats / Kaldi's](https://beandeals.com/dancing-goats-kaldis-30-off-flash-sale/) (Atlanta / St. Louis) - There two roasters merged in 2023 so this is a parallel deal both are offering.  It is not active just yet.  Tomorrow morning for 3 hours there will be a 30% off flash sale.   The selection of both roasters largely overlaps but each roaster has some bags the other doesn't (Dancing Goat's trends to higher prices).   I like the Kaldi's side of the deal better because free shipping is only $40 vs $60 at DG.   On the Kaldi's side there is also a 3-pack bundle that I am hoping is included in this sale for some extra savings.  If the bundle's included, you can add a bag of your choice and get 4 bags for under $12/bag with this deal.
6. [Casa Brasil](https://beandeals.com/casa-brasil-25-off/) (Austin) - 25% off.  If you love Brazilian coffee, this deals for you.  They have so many varietals from blends to microlots.  4 bags for free shipping and their prices are pretty competitive to begin with so with their blends you'll be at $12.75/bag with this deal.  Ends Saturday.

I've also got other deals live on my site, including from some popular brands like CounterCulture, Stumptown, Irving Farm and Intelligentsia, and from a bunch of small roasters that are probably new to you.

I don't make any money if you buy any of the deals I post (even from exclusive deals). I am not a middleman and not affiliated with any roasters. If you guys come across any awesome deals in the future from your favorite roasters, definitely drop a reply or PM.",1,1763913170.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I got into Art of Tea after a friend gave me a tiny tin of Earl Grey that smelled like someone actually cared about ingredients. Ever since, I’ve kept a small rotation of their teas on hand, and the $20 Off coupon makes the first order way easier to justify. The link’s simple: [**http://rwrd.io/lpdql82?c**](http://rwrd.io/lpdql82?c)

What I like about this brand is how every blend tells you exactly what to expect, whether it’s floral, citrus, earthy, sweet, or some mix in between. You don’t need to be a tea expert. You just pick what sounds good and go with it. Their sampler sets are especially fun if you’re indecisive like me. 

Their herbal blends are great before bed, and the caffeinated ones have smooth energy without the coffee jitters. The packaging looks nice enough that you can give it as a quick gift without wrapping drama.

If you want to explore better teas or build a small stash for winter, that $20 Off goes a long way. Grab a flavor that catches your eye and enjoy something cozy.",1,1763913104.0,ReferalCodes,0,1.0,False
1p4q1hs,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/1p4q1hs/closeted_gay_seeking_normal_family_life_future/,Closeted gay seeking normal family life / future,"24, M

Hey guys, I'm not familiar with reddit so this is kind of a long shot. But maybe I can get some advice on here.

First off, I'm about to become a police officer. Which is one of the reasons why I have avoided therapy over the years, because I'm convinced that this can be seen in the system and impact my future career. I guess I've done well so far, but I don't really have anyone to talk to in this regard, so here goes nothing. 

I've known that I'm into men since I was 11. There was never a point during puberty and growing up, in which I have ever been into woman. They simply did not arouse me in any way. So I also never felt the need to experiment with one, unlike with men, I've had my first experience with 15 and it was horrible. During puberty I had one close female friend whom I told my secret. When our friendship went down the drain, she started telling everyone in school, luckily for me noone believed her since she was acting crazy at the time. 

Now I'm 24 years old, my family still doesn't know anything and I have one male friend whom I trusted enough to tell, but we barely talk about it since I believe he might have a crush on me and I don't have one on him. Also one of my best friend's mother and aunt found out, but they thankfully kept my secret and don't judge me for it.

My family situation is a little difficult since my parents separated four years ago and both have new partners. I'm on good terms with my parents and they would also probably not be mad at me for coming out, just disappointed.

There is a lot more backstory, detail and drama to my story, but I'd have to write a book to fit everything in (including that I know my mother to be a closeted bisexual, but her not knowing that I know). 

All in all life has been good to me so far, I'm in no bad financial or social situation, have good friends, own a place, so I feel like I don't really get to complain. But here's where it's getting difficult now.

I've been thinking a lot about my future, and I definitely want to have children. But I will never be comfortable being in a public relationship with a man, especially not raising kids with one. I'm absolutely convinced that every child should have both a mother and a father for a healthy development, plus I also want to give on my own genes to my future kids, so adoption isn't an option for me either. I know some will probably scold me for this, but this is my opinion and I cannot change it, even if I wanted to, I'm too stubborn.

The last year I've started to also find woman attractive for the first time in my life. Only in very specific scenarios and very specific body types, but I can live with the thought and actually become aroused by it. I would love to be in a relationship with a loving, accepting woman whom I can give back the same love if not more, but I'm still at a point where my attraction is 95% towards men and I will never be able to get rid of that fully. I also want to be 100% honest and upfront, but I just can't imagine any woman ever wanting to go with a gay or bisexual man. 

I know it's mostly a thing of values, and my values happen to be of a more conservative family type, which is what I grew up with and what I feel comfortable with. I don't consider myself part of the LGBTQIA+ community and I also don't want to be. I don't feel hate for anyone who is, I simply do not identify with it and I think sexuality is something everyone should keep to themselves. But you can probably see how all of this is conflicting in and by itsself. I've always stayed very firm with my beliefs and values, one of which was to never drink coffee or alcohol or do drugs, which are all things I've never done in my life and am happy about. 

It just keeps gnawing on me to see no possible relationship future with myself and a possible partner really being happy. Almost all of my friends are hetero and in good relationships, the guys always try to hook me up with woman in bars and anywhere we go. Adding that I'm not such a huge fan of those settings, I most of the time just completely lock up and leave, which has my friends very worried about me and confused. They think of me as seeing woman only as sex objects, though I simply know I cannot ever date a ""normal"" woman because she would likely be freaked out by me also liking guys.

I just want a ""normal"" family life, marry a woman, have children, grow old happily together, that's my dream. But my sexuality is in the way of things and I know that denying or trying to ignore it would only make it worse. I've never been in love or in a relationship at any point of my life so that also has me worried about my capabilities in this regard. Anybody got any advice? ",1,1763913100.0,LifeAdvice,2,1.0,False

I'm an outdoorsy remote working tech bro who moved to the PNW a few years back so that I could more easily spend my free time mountain biking and snowboarding/XC skiing.

I'm also indoorsy - I love to go to the [movies](https://tinpantheater.com/) (I also legitimately rent movies from the [last Blockbuste](https://bendblockbuster.com/)r regularly), [read](https://jacobin.com/) [indie](https://www.nplusonemag.com/) [magazines](https://asteriskmag.com/) over [coffee](https://www.lonepinecoffeeroasters.com/locations-1) at [cafes](https://www.thecommonsbend.com/), go to an awesome monthly book club, play [board games](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/822/carcassonne)/pub [trivia](https://vanhenionbrewing.com/events/) with my awesome friend group, [go see live music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5UBAfUtJ2vIptFjreQhruk?si=01d41052b22b47ce), and work on my house (owning a house eats time, haha.)

Long story long: I'm a 6'5"" 210lbs remote tech bro who feels healthy after a few years of therapy, finding a community, and putting down roots in a place I love.

**A few possible deal breakers:**

1. I don't want, nor can I have, kids. I'm searching for a childfree partner
2. I don't drink or smoke so not a big party guy
3. Bend is home and I would really prefer to chat with someone who lives close-ish
4. I don't know anything about video games or anime
5. I don't like backpacking as much as I want to like backpacking. I moved to Bend so I could be outdoorsy during the day and take a shower after.

**What I'm looking for:**

Someone who would also describe themselves as fit, outdoorsy, loves alpine lakes and rivers more than ocean beaches, is a leftist, has their own goals/life, and is seeking a partnership based in love, compassion, communication, and compromise!

I'm flexible on most other things — I'm mostly just looking for a rad human who's looking for what I wrote above as well.

If that sounds like you - send me a chat! I want to know what genre of movie should we rent first and, importantly, Buttered popcorn or kettle? How do you spend your evenings in?

Let's see if we're a match. If not, I wish you all the luck trying to find your person!

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

A heated smart mug just felt like one of those gadgets that sounds cool but ends up collecting dust. After using it every day though, it actually surprised me more than I expected.

The main thing it does is keep your drink at the exact temperature you like. You can adjust it through the app or leave it on the default setting, and it keeps your coffee or tea warm from the first sip to the last. I am the kind of person who keeps forgetting about my cup and comes back to cold coffee, so having it stay warm the whole time feels pretty convenient.

There are a few downsides. The battery without the coaster usually runs for about an hour and a half, sometimes a bit longer if the temperature is set lower. That is fine if you stay at your desk, but it is not ideal if you carry it around the house. The Bluetooth connection can also be slow to pair at times, even though the mug remembers the last temperature you set.

Outside of that, it is built well and looks nice on the desk. The price is definitely the biggest drawback since it feels more like a luxury item than something everyone needs. It does exactly what it claims though. If you enjoy hot drinks and hate reheating them, it makes the whole experience smoother.

It worked well when I got it in September, but now won't grind fine enough. 

During the first week or so getting used to it, I settled on a grind setting of roughly 50 for my Chemex, and 30 for my La Pavoni Europiccola. I like to use a variety of beans, switching up among 5 or 10 favorites every time I buy a new bag, but the switches didn't have a major effect on the grind.

Then at some point, the coffee started coming out coarser. I think I barely noticed it at first, so I'm not sure when it happened. I started setting the grind lower, and when I got down to 40 for Chemex and 20 for La Pavoni i got concerned. I opened it up and cleaned it, following Baratz's video, with no improvement. There was no problem whatsoever with grounds clogging in the chute or beans staying in the hopper. The grind setting ring moves well, not too hard or too easy to adjust. The only symptom was the too-coarse grinds.

Now it's acting as though the grind setting has hardly any effect. For the La Pavoni yesterday I turned it all the way down to 1, and got a barely acceptable espresso grind. I was at 38 (espresso range) this morning for the Chemex.

(Backing up a few days, I talked to Baratza four days ago, who said she would send me instructions for cleaning and ""alignment"".

I know this isn't much 

Every Thursday morning I go for a 7-10 min walk from my house to a local convenience store to pick up a coffee and a snack (usually a chocolate bar or some crisps)

The convenience store has a deli, off license, ect.. the usual shit, (used to have an ice cream shop but that's been closed for years :c i miss it lol... and the aforementioned coffee machine. 

So here's the trick, the coffee machine is self service and you pay at the main till of the shop and it has a waste system,

You can select a Americano, cappuccino, cordato, or a lungo (they also have tea and hot chocolate)

The coffees are around 3€ - 3.50€

Normally you'd select one drink and let the machine make it once and if you wanted extra coffee youd simply buy a second coffee,
But since I have a crippling caffiene addiction, what my trick is, I select an Americano, let the two espresso shots pour into my cup, but let the water shots drain away, and then repeat the process again for a 4 shot esspresso 

It works because since I dont use the water that should be in the drink, thus creating space to put the extra shots 

This way I  basically get two coffees for the price of one

The shop is a large chain here in ireland, so its not like im robbing from some mom and pop place, (as the yanks say) and its also not stealing anyway since I still pay

I’m really not sure if I should talk to our priest about what they were saying, some of it was genuinely heinous and vile. My wife said that feels tattle-y and to just let them grow up, but there’s a part of me genuinely concerned for their sake - and I also think our priest is the person who should be addressing this type of thing.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

So I coordinated with her parents, picked a restaurant, and picked them up. 

My birthday was two weeks before. The night before her dad texted me and said “can you please let me pay for lunch? It’s both your birthdays and I want to be able to do that” I pushed back. He insisted. 

By that point it was too late for me to find something else to do for her birthday in a day so I just went with the plans along as normal. 
So lunch happens. The check comes and my wife’s dad reaches for it. I let him. My wife taps my arm and tells me to split it. She doesn’t know the convo I had with her dad the night before. I put my card down. Her dad says “you don’t hav to do that” I pull my card back.  

My wife gives me a look. The rest of the night was fine but then she tells me she’s bummed because she feels like I didn’t really get her anything for her birthday.  I explain the text from her dad but she’s upset because 1. The restaurant was $73 a person and I picked it so she feels that was rude 2.  She thinks I should have insisted on at least paying half since it was my birthday gift to her and I am her husband and 3. I didn’t get her anything else except a card which I bought when I was with her at the store that morning which made her feel like I didn’t prepare. (I was running out of time and didn’t know how to get it at a time when she wasn’t there) I also said I would get her birthday flowers at the store but then forgot to when I was rushing out. She told me she didn’t like that I was buying her birthday card right in front of her and it felt like I wasn’t being thoughtful. 

The night before I did cook her a nice lamb chop  dinner and I got her breakfast and coffee that morning. 

For background, I’ll admit my wife is very thoughtful with elaborate birthdays for me and anyone she loves. I try to be equally as thoughtful but I’m not the best at gift giving. 

She’s doing a smaller brunch with her friends the next day and I tried to text one of her friends to use the money I would have spent at lunch with her parents to send to her friend to put toward brunch. But she figured out that I was doing that and asked me not to because she said it felt like a makeup gift and didn’t actually involve me because I wouldn’t be there. 

She’s not angry but she’s a bit bummed and distant but I felt I was trying. Am I the asshole?

TLDR: I planned a birthday lunch for my wife but accepted the offer from her dad to pay for it and now my wife feels like I didn’t do anything thoughtful for her birthday.

Sometimes the result is grammatically correct, but sometimes it isn’t; literal translation leads to mistakes or very unnatural wording. Below I’ve listed some examples of common errors that come from literal translation from English. In this post I focused on verbs, although there are plenty of similar examples with other parts of speech, tenses, etc. Try to learn the expressions below so you don’t keep making these literal-translation mistakes.

Mistakes with hacer:

1 . ❌ Hacer una decisión

✅ Tomar una decisión → to make a decision

2 . ❌ Hacer un error

✅ Cometer un error → to make a mistake

3 . ❌ Hacer sentido

✅ Tener sentido → to make sense

4 . ❌ Hacer seguro de

✅ Asegurarse de que… → to make sure (that)… (You “ensure yourself” rather than “do/make sure.”)

Mistakes with tener:

5 . ❌ Tener desayuno

✅ Desayunar → to have breakfast

6 . ❌ Tener un buen tiempo

✅ Pasarlo bien / Pasar un buen rato → to have a good time

7 . ❌ Tener un descanso

✅ Descansar / Tomar un descanso → to have a rest / take a break

Mistakes with other verbs:

8 . ❌ Pagar atención

✅ Prestar atención → to pay attention. (You “lend” attention in Spanish.)

**Bonus tip**: “¿Puedo tener…?” sounds unnatural in Spanish

Learners often translate “Can I have…?” as “¿Puedo tener…?”, but this is very unnatural in most everyday situations.  
In Spanish, we normally ask the other person to give/do something, instead of saying “can I have…”.

❌ ¿Puedo tener un café? 

✅ ¿Me pones un café? / ¿Me das un café? → Can I have a coffee?

❌ ¿Puedo tener tu número de teléfono? 

✅ ¿Me das tu número de teléfono? / ¿Me pasas tu número de teléfono? → Can I have your phone number?

I met this guy through dating app and he invited me for coffee. I agreed. The actual day we didn't really text each other but I showed five minutes earlier to the spot.

I text him to let him know I have arrived to which he replies ""So soon?""

So yeah, after little back and forth he tells me he will be around 10-ish minutes late, which was really testing me since I wouldn't have minded if he let me know in advance or even if he told me directly when I first texted him.

10 minutes is about the max I can tolerate for someone being late, but later he sends me the shakiest photo of him driving with the GPS that had a number between 15-19 minutes of estimated time of arrival.

At which point I just told him I was leaving.

I told my friend this and she told me I was overreacting because maybe he was struck in traffic and maybe couldn't reply to me while driving and that stuff happens. And I get that, still if someone leaves home and hits traffic a heads up would have been appreciated.

He happened to hit my pet peeve of people being late and I didn't feel like accomodating that day, which I think it's fine. But after talking with my friend I wonder if I overeacted by leaving immediately instead of waiting.",11,1763911750.0,AmIOverreacting,51,0.79,False

And there  -under my bed-  was my mom.

Her hair hung over her face, her eyes wide and wild, still holding that same knife.

Lana shrieked,
“WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOUR FAMILY?!”

She ran out of my room, crying, shouting that we were psycho freaks.

The next day, everyone at school knew.

Someone had recorded Lana’s rant on live.
“Corry’s mom HIDES UNDER HIS BED while we’re together! He’s a total weirdo!”

By lunch, I was a meme.
People made fake TikToks pretending to check under their beds for their moms.

Lana ignored me completely, pretending I didn’t exist.

And Mom?
She just sat in the kitchen, hands trembling around a mug of cold coffee.
Her eyes were red  not from anger, but exhaustion.

That’s when I snapped.

“You ruined my life, Mom! Do you even realize what you’ve done?!”

She tried to speak, “Corry, please”

But I didn’t let her. “Do you get some thrill out of embarrassing me? You’re insane!”

I grabbed the mug on the counter and hurled it against the wall. Coffee splashed across her face.

She gasped softly, eyes filling with tears.

And then, in the quietest, most broken voice, she said,
“You want to know why, Corry? Why I hide under your bed every night?”

Her voice cracked.

“Because I lost my parents that way.”

I froze.

She sank to the floor, clutching her chest, her voice trembling.

“When I was little,” she whispered, “my mom and dad were murdered in their sleep. A burglar broke in. I heard everything from under my bed  the footsteps, the screams, the silence.”

Tears streamed down her face.

“I survived because I hid. But they didn’t.”

My throat tightened.

“I swore that night I’d never let my child go through what I did. Ever.”

She looked up at me, eyes filled with pain.
“So when the news came out about that serial killer  the one breaking into houses nearby  I couldn’t sleep. I thought if I stayed close, if I listened from under your bed, I could stop it from happening again.”

She held up the knife with shaking hands.
“I wasn’t trying to scare you, Corry. I was trying to protect you.”

I just stood there.
Every cruel word I had shouted at her came rushing back like a slap.

She wasn’t insane.
She was broken.

Broken by something I never even knew about.

I knelt down beside her, tears burning in my eyes.
“Mom… I’m sorry.”

She smiled weakly through the tears.
“You don’t have to be. I just wanted you safe.”

That night, for the first time in months, she didn’t hide under my bed.
She sat next to me until I fell asleep.

And I realized something ,
 sometimes, the things that seem “crazy” come from the deepest kind of love.

A few days later, the police caught the serial killer.
He had been targeting homes in our neighborhood  breaking in at night.
And the night they caught him?
He was only two blocks away.

If Mom hadn’t been so alert all those nights…
If she hadn’t stayed awake listening for sounds…
Who knows what could’ve happened.

Lana tried to talk to me again after that.
She said she “didn’t mean” to make me a laughingstock.
But I realized  I didn’t need someone like her.

Because love isn’t about how you look in front of others.
It’s about who stands beside you when no one else does.

And that’s what Mom did  even when it made her look crazy, even when it cost her everything.

She protected me.
Every single night.

Now, when I go to sleep, I still sometimes feel like someone’s watching over me.
But it doesn’t scare me anymore.

Because I know it’s her not under the bed this time, but in my heart.

Sometimes, the people who seem “crazy” are the ones who’ve loved and lost the most.
Before judging them, try to understand why they are the way they are.

IMDb Summary: A town's Sheriff and regular patron of a historical whorehouse fights to keep it running when a television reporter targets it as the Devil's playhouse.

Starring Burt Reynolds, Dolly Parton, Jim Nabors, Charles Durning and Dom DeLuise.

Today is the “Fall Festival” in our subdivision. We donated the last of our Halloween candy. We stayed in and spent a mellow morning watching some musicals so that we did not need to listen to the noise coming from the park next to our house. 

While we chose this home next to the park, it does have more noise than other areas in the subdivision. Normally we don’t mind. But there was a local singer out there today and though she was giving her all, it was not exactly to our tastes. 

Now, when I first put in *Sister Act*, Zedd said (keeping in mind he had not even had his morning coffee) “MLZ, this is not the *right* kind of Nun movie.” 

Goodness sakes Zedd, it’s 9:00 am! It’s the right kind of movie for 9:00 am on a Saturday morning! The other nuns come out of their habits on Saturday night! 

While Whoopie (Deloris) was definitely the big star in *Sister Act*, my focus today was much more strongly on our Mother Superior, namely Maggie Smith. She was so awesome as a “straight man” against Whoopie’s comedic relief. The film could have been darker, but they chose to focus on the good and it brought the whole feel of the film up. The music, though squarely positioned in the 50’s and 60’s, played well against the serious Catholic songs the nuns were originally singing. It’s an 80’s comedy, it just showed up a few years later in 1992.

The church in which Deloris takes sanctuary is St. Paul's Catholic Church, located at Valley and Church Streets in Noe Valley, an upper-middle-class neighborhood of San Francisco. I used to pass this beautiful church daily on the way to work and never realized it was this church! Apparently this film was caught up in a couple of lawsuits after release, both of which seemed to have decent amounts of similarities, but not enough to prevail.  This was a huge hit for Disney, grossing $231.6 million worldwide against a $31 million budget.  

Ten years before Deloris was hidden away in a convent, *The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas* went out of business after a “do-gooder” decided it needed to go. Now, in the movie it was Dom DeLuise. In reality, the Chicken Ranch was closed down with the efforts of a quirky Houston reporter, [Marvin Zindler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Zindler?wprov=sfti1). Marvin was a Houston legend! 

*Now, 25 years ago I told a little fib when I said I got into the act because of an anonymous tip. The tip was actually a phone call from the office of the Texas Attorney General John Hill. Hill asked the chief of his organized crime division Tim James to get me involved in closing the Chicken Ranch.*
~ Marvin Zindler in a 2005 interview

The brothel that became the Chicken Ranch opened in La Grange, Texas, in 1844.  In 1917, the current Madam purchased ten acres outside the city limits of La Grange, two blocks from the Houston–Austin highway. This was the final location of the Chicken Ranch.  

During the Depression, due to difficulties with payment in cash, the brothel implemented the ""poultry standard"", and charged one live chicken for each sexual act. The number of chickens at the brothel exploded, and soon the place became known as the Chicken Ranch. They supplemented their income by selling surplus chickens and eggs.

About five years after the closure of the Chicken Ranch, a musical play was put together by Texas author Larry L. King and Peter Masterson and music and lyrics by Carol Hall. 

The play was such a hit that they took the story and very loosely used it to create a screenplay which brought Dolly Parton on board as our Madam and Burt Reynolds as our Sheriff. 

This is definitely a case where the movie does not reflect the difficulties of the production. Apparently they went through several Directors before settling on  Colin Higgins. He had directed Dolly in 9 to 5. Yet it was still apparently a really difficult set. 

Honestly, you could not tell that there were any issues because the co-stars still had incredible chemistry. Dolly lent a song or two to the soundtrack as well which was a big plus. 

Oh, about to close this whole shebang out and remembered what I was supposed to talk about! I miss Maggie Smith terribly. She was an incredibly talented actress and watching her in Sister Act brought to mind how much I miss her. Then, discussing this with Zedd this morning, I also recalled how much I miss Burt Reynolds. While I was never a huge fan of his, he was just a fun guy to have in some of the films of my youth and he was always good for a laugh. 

Man, getting old sucks. But it’s definitely preferred over the alternative!

Since I live in Europe, I assume I have easier access to authentic Italian brands (this person loves everything Italian lol). 

I’m also considering adding a set of Italian espresso cups to make the gift feel more complete, maybe even something from Bialetti or some local Italian hand made stuff so it all matches nicely. But the coffee itself is the part I’m most uncertain about, especially since I don’t drink coffee at all. Maybe you know of sets that already have everything together?

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

My husband has been diagnosed with  diabetes, which he needs to manage with medication. He has to take one pill 20 minutes before breakfast, one after breakfast, one with lunch and one 20 minutes before dinner.

He's doing ok with the pre-breakfast ones because he puts the pills on top of his phone on the bedside table, so he remembers to take one as soon as he wakes up, and the after breakfast pills are on the coffee table next to where he eats breakfast. Lunch also seems ok, he has lunch at work and keeps them in his bag with his card for buying lunch. 

The pre-dinner pill is the difficult one. We've tried different hacks, but he still keeps forgetting until some time after dinner, often an hour or two after he should have taken it.  The barriers:
- We can't always eat dinner at the same time, so he can't set an alarm on his phone. 
- Dinner takes different amounts of time to make, so he can't put it somewhere he'll see it when we start cooking. 
- We can't think of anything he does around 20 minutes before dinner that he can bundle with taking his meds at the same time. 
- We sometimes have dinner at home and sometimes eat out or at other people's houses, and he doesn't have one bag that he takes everywhere, so he forgets to take the pills with him if we go out.

Then a friend told me four words that changed everything.,"I still remember the smell of my office in those final weeks. It was a depressing mix of stale coffee, desperation, and the faint hum of a server that was about to be shut down for good. For two years, I had poured every ounce of my soul, every dollar from my savings, and every waking (and sleeping) moment into my startup. My identity wasn't just tied to my business; it *was* my business. When people asked what I did, I didn't say 'I run a company,' I said 'I AM a founder.'

So when it all came crashing down, it felt like I was dying. The final 'all-hands' meeting where I had to tell my small, loyal team that we were out of cash was the single hardest moment of my life. The looks on their faces weren't just disappointment; it was like I had personally failed each of them. I went home and just stared at a wall for hours. I wasn't just broke; I felt like a complete and utter fraud. The shame was so heavy it felt like a physical weight on my chest.

About a week later, a friend dragged me out for a coffee. I was ready for the pity party, the 'you'll get 'em next time' speech. I just wanted to crawl out of my own skin. I mumbled something about how I'd failed and my name was basically mud. He just looked at me, dead serious, and said, 'Dude. You are not your business.' He just let the words hang there in the air. It was so simple, so blunt, that it cut through all the noise in my head.

It was like a light switch flicked on in a dark room. My business failed. It didn't mean *I* was a failure. The skills I learned, the insane pressure I operated under, the network I built—that wasn't gone. That was experience. That was a PhD in resilience that you can't buy. For the first time in months, I could breathe. I finally understood that the venture's outcome didn't define my worth as a person.

It took time to internalize that, but that single sentence was the turning point. I'm now working on something new, but this time, my approach is completely different. The passion is still there, but that crushing, identity-fused pressure is gone. So, I have to ask: what's a piece of advice you received that completely changed your perspective on failure or success?",1,1763911239.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False

1p4p9aq,https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkatives/comments/1p4p9aq/incompletism_and_death/,Incompletism and Death,"Death is a concept that can feel almost comforting from a nihilistic or pessimistic point of view. But I, as someone who sees myself as incomplete, don’t think I’m going to find any kind of completeness in death. I think I would rather fully understand something — and maybe, if I did, I could conceive its meaning afterward. Because I won’t be able to interpret death after it happens, right?

Death, whether we like it or not, could look like the “answer” to the incomplete. But if I love the search for completeness, why would I end everything just because the search also has its bad side?

This analogy applies to the whole philosophy of Incompletism. Everything has its negative side — absolutely everything — but maybe that negative side wouldn’t even exist without the positive one. It would be incomplete. For things to function, there must be at least two perspectives. Even death is like this: you can see it as freedom, or as a bad ending, or just as something pointless or indifferent.

My philosophy reflects itself in this plurality of feelings. I can see death in all these ways during something as simple as a morning thought with a cup of coffee next to me. So don’t think death is pure freedom, because tomorrow you might find something you genuinely enjoy and change your entire idea of what living even means.

I, for example, am loving writing about my philosophy — Incompletism. And because of that, I don’t see any reason to end things right now, even if I’ll never be able to fully grasp the idea that I created something that moves me in life.",2,1763911218.0,thinkatives,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

So… today started normal. Coffee, headphones, existential dread — the usual.

Then out of nowhere, a girl stops me outside a store, looks me dead in the eye, and says:

“Just act natural. He’s watching.”

Before I can even load the update in my brain, she grabs my arm and whispers,
“Please. Just go with it.”

Next thing I know, a dude comes storming toward us like a villain reveal in a daily soap.
He’s glaring at me like I stole his WiFi, his girlfriend, and his happiness.

She suddenly says loudly,
“See? I told you I moved on.”

Bro…
WHAT?!!
I’m literally standing there wondering if this is a prank, a Netflix pilot, or the universe trolling me.

The guy leaves.
She looks at me, says, “Thanks… you saved me,” gives a tiny smile, and disappears into an auto like Batman in a kurta.

No number.
No explanation.
Just trauma, confusion, and a weird sense of being used as a prop in someone else’s emotional movie.

My preference would be in person since I am still trying to make friends since moving here the first week of October and would like to get out of the house and increase my network in the political/legal fields in Miami-Dade county. I am thinking we can meet at Barnes and Noble or any other cozy comfy coffee places. Too bad public libraries aren’t open on Sundays but we can find our spots. 

I am 24f and I currently live in the southern side of Miami Dade county. I don’t care about your gender, your age, your political beliefs (as long as you are not extreme, misogynist, racist, etc.). I just care about respect, discipline, integrity, friendliness, intelligence, and openness (I like humor too). I don’t want to get to know anyone who smokes, respectfully. Before starting my studies, in the last week of October I got a score of 145 just to know where I was at. Since then, I’ve been studying for the LSAT 30 min a day for the past four weeks. I’m following along the Princeton review and I am in the sufficient assumptions section of the book. I am a month into studying but I am a disciplined and routined individual and would love to learn from someone else and get some guidance along the way and help you anyway I can. Figured I would plant the seed now. My goal is 180 LOL. 

My goal is to take a real test in Feb/March and again during the summer. Apply to law schools by early fall of 2026, and matriculate fall 2027. My hope is to go to Georgetown, Harvard, Columbia. I want to be U.S. attorney general one day. Although I am young, I have experience working for the federal government and well known NGOs and graduated top of my class and am well traveled domestically and internationally. 

Our meetups would mainly focus on LSAT but some of my hobbies include baking, salsa casino, bachata, hiking, history, philosophy, book clubs, I LOVE walking, strength training, reading, self development, meditation. I don’t have social media but I PROMISE I’m not a creep or catfish I just don’t have it for more focus and better mental health but I do have LinkedIn. Before meeting up I imagine talking on Reddit and later FaceTiming or calling on WhatsApp. Not sure if there is already a group in the Miami Dade county for LSAT studiers. Once we chat we can find a rhythm that works for us or just start literally just by studying together. 

I’m open to the above and at any level you are at as long as you yourself have a rhythm as well. Thanks so much for reading this far and excuse the informality I wrote this with a lot of excitement and first draft jitters. Let’s see what happens!!

So far, everything new I have tried this week has been great. I think the fact that I am trying new things I have never had before, is a great thing. Went to the store and bought all kinds of new foods to try. This strawberry banana Greek yogurt, which was really good. I got two different kinds of granola to try, one with cinnamon and berries in it, and one with chocolate in it. Both were delicious. I got the best tasting cereal. Wheat flakes with strawberries. I added blueberries to it and it was so good. And I really like coffee ice cream, so I got these coffee ice cream bars that looked good. I will be getting these again, for sure. I have also tried a new flavor of coffee every day this week. My parents got this new coffee machine at home and you can choose from a variety of unique coffee flavors, like hazelnut or vanilla caramel. This is a major improvement for me, as the anorexia makes me feel like I often cannot try new things and have to keep things exactly the same.

Sooo, at the youth shelter im living at for the moment, a good friend of mine who il call Jane, also lives here, and she decided she likes, and wanted to date another person i know who lives here (and i am not a fan of). She knows that ive known him for a few years now, and she knows the bad history between us, so she came and talked to me about him because she was second guessing herself, so i gave her my honest take, I dont think they would be a good match and she would get hurt. 

Il call him John, John has a slew of mental health problems, schizophrenia being one of them, and he goes in circles. He will be good and behave for a while, then he will cause all hell to break loose, before behaving again, then letting all hell again.
Well, she did atleast say thank you for being honest and didnt get upset, but went and dated him anyways. 

Friday night, he started picking a loud fight with her, then one of my roomates yelled at John to stfu because it was 1am and he went off the rails. The roomate went outside and they had a screaming match, i ended up following him outside a few mins later, but said nothing, went directly to the far side of the lawn to watch and hit my vape. 

The second i stepped outside he immediately started shit with me, i said nothing untill yelled at, but still kept walking away. Couple mins later, cops show up, at first hes calm and talking to them, then all the sudden he starts fighting them and gets forced to goto the hospital for a mental health hold. 

They let him out a few hours later, he came back and immediately started starting shit again. Jane was having a really bad day so we went to go grab Coffee and chat, were sitting in the smoking area, ive finally got jane smiling and laughing again, John barges outside comes over and just immediately starts screaming at Jane despite her asking for some space, then John hit Jane and i stepped in between them, Cops came again but didnt take John this time. 

Later that same day, i go over to the corner store to grab some chips and pop for a movie night, as im walking back hes headed the other way screaming at shelter people across the road, sees me, starts yelling at me going on about hes going to r**e my sister and kept walking towards me, then just started swinging, got ganged up on and got his ass beat. Cops came, Ambulace came, Ambulance took him, and are now investigating us. 

Now onto today, John came back yet a 3rd time, still dont know why he hasnt been kicked out but eh, and b-lines it for Jane who has made clear she needs space for a few days. Well, screaming match breaks out, i come outside, staff come outside, and thats when John started swinging on Jane, so staff stand there like a bunch of pussies while me and a few other residents who were outside go racing over to get him off her, cops show up yet again, and this time they finally took him. 

Things still havent calmed down 100% yet, but i tried to go sit with Jane and check on her, but i guess now im the biggest asshole on the face of the planet because i didnt stop her from dating John..... like broooo. I warned you, you didnt listen, then i protected your ass, made sure you were ok, and cheered you up, but im the asshole? Really now..... 

Ontop of that, Staff are pissy at me because this is the second incident ive been involved with between John and I (this year atleast). Ohhh you shouldnt have got involved when John and Jane were fighting. Oh just sit there and watch a man beat the shit out of a woman? I dont think so. Oh you shouldve ignored him at the corner store, ignore a fist to the face and him saying hes going to r**e my family? Nah i cant ignore that. 

This is why i want a fucking job, so i can get money and get tf outa here so i dont gotta deal with this shit amymore. Im 23, im supposed to be buying a home, starting a family, etc. I aint got time for this shit. ",3,1763911048.0,homeless,5,1.0,False

I just bought my mom a Fellow Aiden coffee maker, and I want to make sure she can actually get good coffee out of it. She currently has a Cuisinart Supreme Grind Automatic Burr grinder.

Since I don’t drink drip or pour-over coffee myself, I honestly don’t know what “good quality” pour-over coffee should taste like or how much the grinder actually matters.

My questions:
	1.	Is the Cuisinart Supreme Grind good enough for the Fellow Aiden, or is it too inconsistent for proper pour-over?
	2.	If it’s not ideal, what inexpensive grinder would you recommend that gives a noticeable improvement without spending too much?

I’d really appreciate recommendations from people who know the Fellow products and pour-over brewing better than I do. Trying to make sure my mom gets the best coffee she can without breaking the bank.",2,1763911015.0,FellowProducts,2,1.0,False

1p4p5ox,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMechanics/comments/1p4p5ox/2014_accord_i4_eps_light_steering_judderrock_hard/,"2014 accord i4, eps light, steering judder/rock hard to turn","Bought the car new in 2014, currently \~75k miles.  
Last week the EPS light started coming on randomly. When it’s on:

* Steering wheel judders badly
* Feels like it’s fighting me – can barely turn even ¼ turn at standstill

Turning the car off and back on would make the light go away and steering return to 100% normal.  
As of today the light is on permanently and the car is basically undriveable – stranded in my driveway. Recent history that might matter:  


* 2–3 weeks ago someone backed into me at \~5 mph – only a scuff on the front bumper, no visible damage underneath
* Spilled coffee around the shifter/console area (not near the column)
* \~3 months ago sent the ABS module out for the common “Christmas tree dash” repair on eBay – fixed that issue completely
* Cleaned battery terminals and tightened them last week when the problem was still intermittent – helped for a few days, now back permanently

I know the next step is to pull codes now that the light stays on, but I wanted to post first in case anyone recognizes these exact symptoms.  
I’m terrified it’s the infamous torque-sensor/steering-rack failure like the 2013–2015 cars (TSB 17-013). I’ve seen the $100 “EPS control module on the column” fix on YouTube, but I think that’s mostly Civics and not our cars.  
  
My mechanical experience stops at brakes, starter, and sending the ABS module out – I don’t have a lift or the tools/confidence to swap a whole rack myself.I have three young kids now, sentiment for the car is real, but a 11-year-old Accord that might need $2k in steering work + future repairs feels like the wrong hill to die on. A new 3-row (Pilot, Carnival, palisade.) makes a lot more sense for the family.  
  
Questions for the group:  


1. Anyone in the NYC/Brooklyn area see this exact pattern and confirm it’s the rack?
2. Best cheap scanner that can pull Honda-specific EPS codes (61-01, 53-01, etc.)?
3. Any indie shops in Brooklyn/Queens you trust for diagnosis or rack swap?
4. Worth trying the column module anyway for $100, or is that a waste of time on a 2014?
5. If I’m probably going to sell/trade anyway, should I just get Carvana/CarMax offers now, right now i don't know if i can even steer it into the flatbed. Would scanner be able to temporary fix issue to get into flatbed.

Thanks in advance – really hoping some of you have lived through this exact nightmare and can point me in the right direction.

I’ve been teaching in the non profit, private independent sector for 20 (!!!) years! My starting salary was something like $24k. I’ve been an upper elementary (grades 4-6) Montessori teacher for most of that time period. I have two masters in Education and one BA/minor in Spanish and Latin American Studies from a state school. I went into teaching, and particularly Montessori, early and fell in love. I adore my job - not all day, every day, but I am definitely one of those people that whole-heartedly believes in and talks positively about what I do. I have banging benefits but a crap salary. I’m proud of how much I make now but we live in a HCOL area (that’s only gone up!), so you know - “the grass is always greener/salary higher in public ed,” yada yada yada, is often not far from the forefront of my mind. We both grew up in MA and stayed in the suburbs.

My husband C (43M) is a mechanical engineer and has always made at least double my salary. This is the first year that he does not make double, although it’s close! (He makes $140k).  We have our own accounts for spending, saving, solo trips, gifts, gas, etc., and a joint account for all “together” things like house related things (grocery, utility, mortgage, streaming, maintenance, special projects, etc.) and outings/vacations. 

**Side Gigs:**

I’ve tutored for about 15 years and have had long standing clients. This year, I tutor 1x/week and charge $75/kid. There are two kids (ages 15 and 10), so if I see them both, I walk away with $150/week. Last year I brought in an extra \~$6k, since they both needed consistent help. This year, I will probably bring in less, as the 15 year old is knocking it out of the park and doesn't need my help as much as in the past!!

Secondly, I work for a non-profit six week summer school each summer that serves underprivileged local students (ages 3-14) and have been part of this program for about 8 years. This past summer, I taught for three weeks and brought in an additional $3k. I do this solely for the students & families, since I firmly believe that maintaining strong relationships with the families and children is the BEST way to serve this type of community. It’s sort of similar to my “typical” teaching job and in other ways, so far away from my day to day classroom.

**Section II: Assets and Debt**

*Retirement Balance:* 

Me: \~$480k in retirement (combo of Roth/403B/HSA/HSA investments); cash at hand is about \~$15k (combo of HYSA, regular savings/checking account).

C: \~$710k in retirement (combo of 401K/Roth and investments); cash at hand is about \~$40k (combo of HYSA, regular savings/checking account).

We both drive older cars that are paid off.

*Equity if you're a homeowner: \~$530k*

We bought our house in 2011 for $257k (just under 1200 sq feet, 2 beds, 1 bath, 1 acre of land in an amazing neighborhood). We owe about $142k on the house now. We did a cashout/refi in 2018 and put a second bathroom in off our primary/re-did the driveway and did another refi in 2020 in the very beginning of COVID. Our rate is now 2.5% for 15 years (9 remaining). We are super fortunate to have bought at a low and have this interest rate. I am the oldest of many cousins and am really feeling for them, as they’re coming into their 20s and 30s and looking for property in the Mass. area. 

I am the executor of my parents estate and “own” their property. I will receive a third of their assets upon their passing; I do not wish this even a little bit and do not count, nor care, what that number will be. My family and I are very tight and my parents/two younger siblings are my best friends.

*Credit card debt* (and how you accumulated it): $0. We pay them off each bill cycle. (JetBlue for points, WellsFargo for cash back).

*Student loan debt:* $0. 

*Anything else that's applicable to you:* I grew up comfortably in the (upper?) middle class bracket and was granted a lot of privilege, although my family was on the “low end” in the town I grew up - think cars on 16th birthdays, horses on 10th birthdays, latest fashion trends for Christmas (go 90s!), lavish graduation parties/sweet 16s, bat/bar mitzvah, international vacations, etc. We went to a hunting camp up in NH once a year, went to Disney World twice, grew up going to the beach in the summer, and learned how to garden/sew/cook/fish/dig clams early on. My parents were very intentional with their money and really did a wonderful job saving and being frugal, while modeling for us kids what good money habits looked like. My dad grew up in the town I grew up in and my mom grew up in a much, much lower class bracket nearby. I think my siblings and I had a really different perspective based on our moms’s and cousin's upbringing. We often volunteered our time and donated food/toys around the holidays, used the library frequently for entertainment and did free summer activities.

I was not directly “educated” on money, but dad and mom made it very clear to always save what you could and spend carefully. They were wonderful models of what to do with your money, although I had no idea at the time!  I started working part time at 14 and have worked since. I had everything I needed and lot of what I wanted - still do.

Not going to college was never even discussed. I always just assumed I would and so I did. When I was 16 and looking at colleges, my parents told me that they’d take care of tuition if I went to a state school; this was the same set up for my siblings. I had a huge leg up in life having my entire college career funded.  My family and I are very close - my siblings are my best friends & I see most of my cousins frequently. 

I knew very early on that I didn’t want children, maybe because I was the oldest sibling/cousin of so many young kids. I met my husband at age 26, we bought our house at age 30, and married at age 34. While we’ve had our share of ups and downs, he is my favorite person and I’m so lucky to have a partner who shares my values and a similar belief system in kindness/humanity, money/investments, our present/future and family.

**Section III: Monthly expenses** 

*Savings contribution*: I put about $700 to our savings account and C puts in about $1500. I need to change my contribution after seeing these numbers. I also put in $200 twice a month to my personal HYSA

*Net take home pay after deductions:* $1,694.32. I get paid twice a month. My deductions include 28% to my 403B, (as well as separate monthly contributions to my Roth IRA to fully fund it each year), HSA to fully fund it each year, MA taxes, Fed taxes, medicare, SS, etc. My school does a double match up to 4% in a 403B.

*Health insurance:* my school pays 100% of my health insurance. I opted into the HSA a few years ago and so my in network deductibles are HIGH. HSA’s are “for the healthy and the wealthy.” I pay around \~$100/month for my inhaler through GoodRX and I pay a couple bucks a month for dental. C is on his own insurance and does not have an HSA or FSA. He has epilepsy and goes to a specialist once a year, in addition to his regular check ups.

*Debt payments*: No debt other than our mortgage; we overpay a bit to even it out to $2100/month. We pay our credit cards in full upon their billing cycle due date. 

*Donations:* we do not donate financially to any org consistently. 

*Electric/Gas*: \~$200 electric, \~$80 for gas. This obviously fluctuates seasonally.

Interestingly enough, we (meaning C) are DEEP in the middle of installing our own solar panels & hope to make the Dec. 31st deadline for the tax credit. This is my husband’s project and I am a cheer leader! We are working with our electrician and C has spent \~$12k for all of the materials, plus an additional \~$8k for labor (trenching, wiring and racking and panel installation on a 45 degree pitch roof). While the panels will not run our entire house, we estimate about 75% in the summer and about 50% in the winter. We have run the numbers and since we will “own” the electricity we make, the investment on our materials and labor will be paid off in about \~8 years. We will also get a 30% tax credit.

*Wifi/Cable/Landline*: *Cellphone:* \~$120/month for two phones & $71/month Wifi through Verizon with a teacher discount. We have a very old package that is no longer available through Verizon. We bought our androids straight up two years ago. We do not do Apple products (or Amazon…). 

*Subscriptions*: $145.68/annually (paid in full for a baby discount) for two cars on Sirius XM and $8/month for Netflix streaming service. & Hulu is paid for by a generous cousin. We have an old school antenna that picks up local channels that we use for the Patriots games seasonally. Go Pats!

*Gym membership:* I pay for a boxing gym each year up front, about $1100 for unlimited classes a month. I go 2-3x a week; as a teacher, boxing is my therapy. I also have the Peloton app from a generous aunt/uncle - I strength train at home 2x a week, use the walking feature 3-4x week and the stretching classes 2-3x week. 

*Pet expenses:* $0 now. We lost our beloved senior mutt back in September. I’m still heart broken by this loss. If you have experienced pet loss, I am here with you in solidarity. It is a grief unlike any other that cannot be described and I’m so sorry. (TW: I cry everyday and write about it in this money diary).

*Car payment / insurance:* No car payments but \~$2300 for two cars and our house for insurance. We pay this in full annually for a baby discount and receive a twice a year “safe drivers discount” of about $100.

*Paid hobbies:* None for me - I cook, walk, garden, and read (go Libby!!). My husband is an avid archer/target shooter and we belong to a local gun range. His dues are $170 a year. We both have our MA gun license and I go with him a few times a year. I have no idea how much he spends on archery and ammunition. (Please don’t come at me; yes we have licensed guns, yes they are locked up, yes our country is totally EFFED up with gunlaws/protocol, yes I am a teacher and have lots of feelings about that).

**Section IV: The Money Diary!**

It took me about two hours to write out all of the above info, which I always appreciate as a reader. The diary itself took a while, too, and is pretty detailed. I wrote for an audience of “me’s” and the format that I like to read. It is LONG.

Sunday: $0 spent. 

* Woke up around 8:30a to the smell of coffee and TJs cinnamon rolls - what a treat! I drink my obligatory 20 oz of water and enjoyed my breakfast while listening to the new Nine Inch Nails album. I’ve always loved hard rock but since our dog passed, I have been listening to channels like Turbo, Ozzy’s Boneyard, Lithium, etc. on repeat. Change into what I dub as a “raking leaves” outfit, since I’m not leaving the house.
* 10am-noon: Listening to *Himself* by Jess Kidd on Libby. Did some typical Sunday chores & smoked some of our weed to ramp myself up. C declined while he did solar project stuff and re-arranged our detached garage. I vacuumed the rest of the house while the robot vacuum took care of our second bedroom/home office, cleaned the two bathrooms, washed/dried bedsheets and bathroom towels and cleaned  the kitchen. Woof!
* 1pm: Put together a snack lunch for us while watching the Pats beat the Buccaneers (great game!!) - salami, TJs unexpected cheddar, raw carrots and red peppers and hummus, & a cut up apple. C makes microwaved nachos for our second snack lunch around 3pm. I have a super yummy stout from a local brewery during the game. I do a 15 minute Peloton stretch during the game but it’s interrupted several times by lots of choice words and shouts!
* 4:30p: start dinner - roasted some red skinned potatoes with rosemary from the garden, baked marinated chicken (paprika, cumin, garlic, brown sugar, olive oil, soy sauce) & air fried cauliflower (paprika, turmeric, SPG). Prep some green beans for tomorrow’s dinner, put them in a vase of water and into the fridge.
* 5:45pm: Dinner time! Have a half of a yummy pumpkin beer from another local brewery we visited a few weeks ago. Put the rest in the fridge for tomorrow.
* 6:30pm: start on dishes while C takes out trash and recycling and folds the last of our laundry. Log my food for the day plus my groovy beers. 
* Veg’ed out and read my book, *Onyx Storm*, by Rebecca Yarros, the last of the series. I couldn’t really remember what happened in the first two books since they were so long ago, but I’m getting back into the story. Violet and Xaden’s sex life is hot and hilarious!!
* 8:45pm: Start getting ready for bed. I have my period and am beat. I’ve been off my BCP since April when C got a snip snip and my periods are wacko. However, my sleep is significantly better and my heart palpitations have basically disappeared. Nighttime routine (brush my teeth, wash & moisturize with a local skin care cleanser, toner and nightcream), get my workout clothes and school clothes for tomorrow morning, read for a bit and lights out at 9:15pm.

Monday: $0 spent

* 5:45am: Alarm goes off. Do I get up immediately? Nope. C turns over and we snuggle for a bit and I reluctantly get up around 6am. Drink my 20 oz of water, change, put dishes away from last night and do a 30 min Peloton full body strength with Adrian (helloooooo nurse!), & a 10 min stretch. I finish up around 6:45a. C had made my coffee (extra cream, normal sugar for me!) and gives it to me as he heads to the office for another WFH day. I throw the last of the cinnamon rolls into the Breville on reheat, and get dressed in what I dub as “school appropriate” clothes & do my post workout skin routine (micellar water, moisturizer with sunscreen, Merritt stick, Merritt blush, mascara) while the buns warm up.
* 7:15am: eat, drink coffee, make the bed and load the morning dishes into the dishwasher. 
* 7:34am and I’m in the car heading to school.
* 8am: I arrive at school and my co-teacher is not feeling great. I cover their Morning Warm Up at 8:15am and take laps with a few sixth grade girls. We talk about their weekends.
* 8:30am to 3pm: Pretty easy Monday as the students have specials all afternoon. Tomorrow is Veteran’s day & a random day off, so the kids are a bit more hyped up than usual but it’s all good. At morning meeting, we talk about what a veteran is and I give lots of examples of how to appreciate and/or honor veterans in their lives and communities. Monday is math day, so I give many math lessons and review work from previous weeks before lunch. Lunch is last week’s meal-prep of meat and bean chili, sour cream and half an avocado, plus a clementine, that I had left in my classroom fridge. There are leftover individual chili fritos in the teachers room, so obvi I grab those, too! I eat lunch during an admin meeting, and take a 10 minute “brain break” by walking end to end of the building five times. 
* 3:30 to 4p: after school meeting with parents. This child is very unique, as it’s their first time in an actual school due to living in a developing country most of their life up until now. We preview some upcoming events, address strengths and challenges, and academic and social/emotional learning. The parents are very pleased with their experience so far. 
* 4:15pm: I leave school and get home around 4:45pm. C opts out of our evening walk because he is in the garage doing garage things. I take a few hits of weed and walk solo. It is black as midnight and rainy and cold. 
* 5:30p: While I was gone, C seasoned the meat for smash taco burgers (my fav) and spread it on the tortillas and made burger sauce. I drink the other half of the groovy pumpkin beer while I cut up some lettuce and pickles, and air fry some frozen rosemary fries. C sautes the green beans I prepped last night and we sit down to a feast. After dishes and clean up, we start season 2 of *Nobody Wants This.* I log my food into the app.
* 9:30pm: I am falling asleep on the couch! I do my nighttime routine, read *Onyx Storm* for about ten minutes and lights out at 10pm. I cry a little bit because I miss our dog so badly. Night times are the hardest. 

Tuesday - $46 spent, $75 made

* 7:00a: I sleep in a bit since I have the day off due to Veteran’s Day. Hurray! My most sincere gratitude to those who have served our country and their families. I text my cousin, a BPD detective and former Marine. We catch up in mini texts and will see each other at Christmas. I drink my 20 oz of water, drink some coffee that C brings me, change & get ready for an 8am boxing class.
* 9:15am: I am staaaavin! What a class!! I get home and strip, putting my PJs back on while I fry up some eggs & deli ham and dig out some leftover homemade cheddar jalapeno bread from the freezer. While I'm there, I also dig out some blueberries from our bushes to defrost and turn into blueberry oatmeal for breakfasts this week. I drink a half more cup of coffee, eat solo and leave C a plate, as he’s on a call in the office for another WFH day. I clean up dishes, wipe the counters and decide to also hard boil six eggs for breakfasts, snacks or lunches, whatever comes first. I work on this money diary and listen to *Himself.*
* 10:00am: I find my giant backpack and travel backpack and take stock of what I need for an upcoming overnight trip with my students to VT next week. I am scheduled to give a “packing lesson” on Thursday, so I start making piles of long underwear, socks, heavy pants, etc. I take an everything shower before getting dressed into another “raking leaves” outfit and head out the door again for an 11am pedicure ($46: $38 cash with $8 tip). It’s the first real cold air of the season and very windy.
* Noon: Pedicure was amazing, the massage chair hit and I read more *Onyx Storm*. I head over  to a friend’s house to pick up a bag of hard-neck garlic. We ate all of ours this past year from our gardens and have nothing to plant. Luckily, our friends have an excess! Friend and I catch up for a bit and then I head home. Before I start driving, I catch up via text with my LDB - long distance bestie. On the highway, it starts snowing legit snow squalls. There’s a lot of breaking and confused looks - where TF is fall??!? It feels like we went straight from summer to fall for three days to winter.
* 1pm: I make a can of tuna with mayo, red onion, celery and pepper and put it on top of a salad that I made a few days ago. I eat half, along with a mandarin, a few Firehook crackers and a grapefruit seltzer and pack the other half for lunch tomorrow. I continue packing for the trip with my students and hunt down some cold weather gear that has been stored in the closet since the spring.
* 2:30pm: I get a response on FB Marketplace for a patio heater we’ve had listed for a minute. C moves some stuff in the garage, takes it apart and loads it into this dude’s mini van (+$75). I heat C up some leftover pasta with homemade pesto, soprasatta and veggies for his lunch. I add the cash to our money pile on the dresser. 
* 3pm: I bundle up to head out for a 30 minute walk because it’s still light for another hour or so. I listen to *Himself.* I run into a neighbor who I haven’t seen since our dog passed who says how sorry they are; I cry, duh.
* 4pm-8:00pm: I watch a couple episodes of Selling Sunset. Holy moly. It is entertaining but makes my brain hurt. I read *Onyx Storm* while C heats up smashburger tacos & green bean leftovers from last night. I read more, we chat about my upcoming birthday, we text back and forth with my brother and go outside to see if we can see the Northern Lights (we cannot). I log my food from the day and am a bit under the suggested cals.
* 8:30pm: make my way to bed, start my routine. I browse on Reddit for too long and sleep like crap, waking up far too often. It could be my period still, could be my browsing too close to bedtime - who knows. 

Wednesday: $4 spent

* 5:45am: I hear C get up, since he’s going into the office. Wednesday is my rest day, so I fall back asleep and wake up at 6:30am. C has made my coffee, so I chug my 20oz of water, fold the blankets on the couch from last night, pack his lunch (leftover pasta, the last of the apple oatmeal from last week, the last of a banana protein breakfast cookie and two clementines) and my morning routine begins. He gives me a smooch goodbye, promises to bring back office snacks and reminds me that he has an event until 5pm. I get dressed (red cords, grey and white leopard sweater) and I break out my Blundstones. 
* 7am: I make the bed, clean up the coffee dishes and remote start my car from the house. I grab my lunch bag and am out the door at 7:34am. 
* 8am: arrive at school. I make a gajillion copies, staple packets because the copy machine is out of staples and set up all the materials. The kids come back in at 8:30am and my co-teacher runs morning meeting while I continue setting up.
* 9am: let the games begin! The students are in the middle of an engineering unit focusing on mechanical engineers and wind and air usage for science. It’s a busy morning and I’m on recess duty, where I take laps with a teacher friend. It is true winter coat weather and I make a mental note to dig it out when I get home. Pizza gets delivered at some point (my students run a pizza business on Wednesdays) and I come back to organized chaos - welcome to my classroom :) The afternoon is pretty chill - I have a meeting with another co-teacher and meet with my students at the end of the day to log their work and progress.
* 3:45pm: I make the dreaded drive to the nearest JCrew outlet to exchange a coat. I’ve been putting this off because traffic in that area sucks big time. It’s actually not so bad and I’m glad to get this errand off my plate. Great news - I am able to exchange the beautiful coat for free AND they apply the teacher discount, so I save an additional $24! I pursue the sale racks and buy a grey sleeveless sweater and a navy/gold stripe turtleneck for $20. Score!
* 5:30pm: I am home and I inhale the last of the pasta from Friday night while C unpacks our lunchboxes and loads the dishwasher. He ate at his work event and is not hungry for dinner. I talk to my mom about an event we’re going to Saturday night, read the sweetest condolences snailmail from LDB (and you know, cry) and talk to another friend on the phone. I also finally make the oatmeal with the blueberries I pulled out and decide to add a cut up apple that is looking left out. The oatmeal turns a shade of pink. Ha!
* I read more *Onyx Storm* and C and I chat on and off. I have a TJs dark chocolate peanut butter cup and log my food. I’m happy to see that I’m within the suggested cals!
* 8:45pm: I start my nighttime routine and take out my clothes for tomorrow. C goes to bed later than me but almost always tucks me in :) Lights out at 9pm.

Thursday: $75 made

* 5:45am alarm goes off, coffee goes off 5 minutes later. My ring says I slept 8 hours and 20 minutes!!! I chug my 20 oz of water, change into work out clothes, roll out my mat and get set up with my weights.
* 6am-ish: 30 minute full body strength on Peloton with Ben (love him, too - he’s so clear!), 5 minute core and a quick stretch on my own. 
* 6:45am I drink my coffee while C packs me the pink oatmeal for breakfast and cleans up. He’s unsure if he’ll WFH today (he does…). I get dressed (school appropo: new turtleneck, dark skinny jeans, dark green quilted vest, blundstones), start the car from the house, hunt down my winter coat, make the bed, fill my to-go coffee, kiss C and am out the door at 7:34am. I forget my “packing lesson” stuff inside, so come back to get it, load it in the car, and am off.
* 8am-noon: School! It’s another busy day with my friends. We practice singing our group songs for an upcoming performance (“This is What It Sounds Like,” by Huntrix! These lyrics, dude…) and I kickoff a new unit in writer’s workshop. History skits, work time, area of annulus, community meeting, a packing lesson for our upcoming trip….and then it’s dismissal! I organize a Community Lunch each Thursday with people who like to take turns cooking for others. Today’s lunch is salad, garlic bread and baked raviolis! My friend is going through it hard with her sick dog. We chat a bit and both cry. 
* 1-3pm: meetings. 
* 3pm: I leave for tutoring. Traffic is not so bad but the temperature drops from 50 degrees to about 42 degrees in a couple minutes and it starts to HAIL! WTF. Only one of the kids needs my help so we do some general organizing, review tables and ratios from last week, work on word problems with ratios and fractions, and brainstorm/research pictures for a poster. The mom Venmos me before I get home. (+$75).
* 5pm: home! My tire air pressure came on and C fills it up as soon as I pull into the driveway. I bring my packing lesson stuff inside and put it in our bedroom to be dealt with and finalized this weekend. I wash up, unpack my school bag and listen to “This is What It Sounds Like” on repeat for about 15 minutes.
* 5:45pm: Dinner is leftovers. I reheat the baked chicken, cauliflower and roasted potatoes from Sunday, the rest of the green beans from Monday, and make a salad with the rest of the iceberg lettuce, red pepper, cuke, carrot and herbs from the garden. 
* 6:30pm: I sign up for the 6am boxing class tomorrow morning, as well as the 10:15am boxing class on Saturday. I have an early meeting tomorrow morning, so I need to go straight to school after the class. C cleans up dinner and preps our coffee while I make egg salad with the eggs I boiled earlier in the week for lunch tomorrow. I pack my pink oatmeal, egg salad over veggie salad, two clementines, a homemade protein banana muffin from the freezer stash, and some Firehook everything crackers. I pack my boxing gloves, wraps, towel and water, pick out my school clothes (upscale “raking leaves” outfit) and lay out my boxing clothes.
* 7:30pm: I hop in the shower, do my nighttime skin care, change into PJs and am on the couch in time for Patriots kick off. I hate 8:15pm games but know that I’ll watch till the half. I log my food for the day and am within the suggested calories. My two oldest friends text me to make dinner plans next weekend for my birthday and I text two of my cousins to confirm my visit on Saturday.
* 9:45pm:  Why do nine seconds in football take 10 minutes?!? 14, 7 at the half. Brush  my teeth, kiss C, and lights out right away.
* Friday: $60 made
* 5:10am: coffee goes off, 5:15am alarm goes off. I’m up. I chug my water, make half cup of coffee, fill up my coffee travel mug and grab my lunch bag. I check the score from last night - Pats take another W! 
* I weigh myself once a week on Fridays and I’m down 12 lbs in three months. THAT feels good. I get dressed, drink half a cup of coffee and remote start my car. Off I go into the darkness and cold with all my bags!
* The Friday class kicks my ass but in a great way week after week. I do a ten minute Peloton post stretch at my gym and head to school. 
* 7:15am: I pull into the school parking lot and grab my stuff. My classroom has its own bathroom and I keep a variety of personal hygiene products in there for my students who need whatever, so it’s pretty well stocked. I change, do a quick wipe of my face, moisturize and comb my hair. It’s soaked in sweat but will figure itself out later. 
* 8am: meeting with a needy parent. Le sigh. 
* 8:45am: meeting ran over. Co-teacher ran morning meeting and the day begins! Lit circle, math lessons, one on one help/review, a check in meeting with my head of school, recess with our upcoming performers and “stage managers” lunch (yes, this performance is legit!)…and the fire alarm sends us all outside. Womp womp waaaa. It’s very cold and windy. Kids still need to eat, so once we get inside, everything in the afternoon backs up a bit. 
* 1:30pm: The students go for a hike on our land. This is a monthly occurrence and we rotate curriculum connections and the teacher who leads it. I stay back and work on groups for our upcoming trip next week. This takes me to the end of the day.
* 3:45pm: peace out, cub scout. Head home, greet C & he gives me an update on the solar project and head out for a cold, dark solo walk. C reminds me that I need my nighttime walking stuff. I listen to *Himself* as I walk for about 20 minutes. 
* 5:30pm: C has started dinner - basmati rice, roasted broccoli and TJs mandarin orange chicken. He greets me with a whiskey cider and we talk about some big feels regarding loss. We both cry. I’m surprised and proud of C for opening up - he is a stoic but sensitive and softy. We eat together, chat about our days and the week, and listen to Lindsey Sterling. During dinner, I find out that my friend from school had to put down her beloved dog. I send her a long ass loving message from us. C and I have a big hug. He is my favorite person in the entire world and we’re lucky to have each other.
* 6:30pm: I get a message from FB marketplace about a stand up boxing bag I posted a while back. They are on their way! I posted for $75 and will I take $60 cash? Yes, sir. 
* I smoke some weed. We try to frontload chores on the weekend, starting with little things on Friday night. C changes over the wash to the dryer and turns on the dishwasher while I do a quick counter wipe in the kitchen and vacuum the kitchen, entryway and living/dining room. 
* 7:15pm: We settle on the couch. C hands me a second whiskey cider. We peruse  movies and eventually settle on *Being Eddie*. I eat a bowl of some bougie popcorn left over from our Halloween celebration at school. I log my food for today, including my two whiskeys, and I’m over by a couple hundred. 
* 9:15pm: we both rot on our phones and cuddle on the couch. C tells me his time off for Thanksgiving week and Christmas week were approved and we talk about our plans for my two weeks off in March. Around 10-ishpm, I brush my teeth, read *Onyx Storm* for ten minutes and lights out.

Saturday: $114.56 spent

* I have a very vivid dream of being on a boat with C and my dad driving into a literal wall of water. My dreams have always been pretty detailed and I REM like a boss. C tells me it’s not even 7am and to go back to sleep. I roll over and do, waking again at 7:50pm. C makes coffee and comes into the bedroom so I can recap my entire dream to him. 
* 8:30am: C unloads the dishwasher and I start on breakfast - the last of the jalapeno cheddar bread from the freezer, the last of the deli ham, and four fried eggs with SPG and pesto. We eat and I talk about my meetings yesterday and our plans for the weekend. C has a “war” on his game to attend to, I am signed up for the 10:15a box and lift class, and I have plans with two cousins and my mom later tonight. C wants to take down “small trees” by the garage today and there’s a BJs trip in our future since we have one bag of coffee beans left!
* 9:30am: I clean up breakfast dishes, make the bed, change for boxing and get all my gear together. C promises to either clean bathrooms or fold laundry while I’m gone. 
* 11:15am: daaaaammmn, that class killed everyone!! I am feeling very strong. I stop at Marshall’s on the way home to get a gift for my cousin, who just bought their first home. I find a cozy blanket and adorable LED tap lights, both on clearance ($41.72 personal account). The packy is next door, so I run in to get a bottle of Prosecco and a four pack of beer for C. ($33, our account)
* Noon: I parked by a Bruegger’s Bagel and the smell is just too much. I go in to purchase half dozen everything bagels & chive cream cheese for future me and C and leave with an Herby Turkey sandwich, too. ($19.84, our account)
* 12:15pm: I am about to eat my arm! I split the sandwich in half on two plates and add a clementine, an ounce of cabot cheddar cheese, and the rest of the cut up veggies from the week with some hummus. C has been doing yard work since I’ve been gone (taken down some trees, weed whacked, blown leaves and picked them up on the mower). I log my food, full on knowing that I’ll go over tonight.
* 1pm: we have some sexy time, shower together, and I change into wide leg dark jeans, my new sleeveless sweater, a floppy beanie, white infinity scarf, black cashmere gloves and suede bomber jacket. I do some quick makeup and straighten my hair. 
* 1:40pm I am later than I wanted to be and still stop to get gas ($20, my account). I text my cousins that I’ll be there by 2:30p. Unfortunately, there’s a wicked big multi-vehicle accident on the way. I end up calling 911 because it’s clear that it just happened. Big trucks are driving down the grassy/bumpy/ditchy median to get around the three lanes and I hang in the breakdown lane. 
* 2:45pm I visit with my two cousins, see their adorable new place and we split a bottle of Prosecco. I also have a glass of red wine. They ask about our dog and I tell them the whole story, start to finish, while weeping. Big hugs.
* 4:45pm: I head to my parents house. My dad is hunting and I’m my mom’s “date” to the $10k raffle at the local watering hole in their town. We do not win the big bucks, but I do eat meatballs, salad, veg lasagna and garlic bread and drink two gin and tonics (double limes) and a red wine. I say hello to many of my parents' friends and meet a few new ones. 
* 10pm: I drive back to my parents house to drop mom home and we have tea and chat. I leave my parents house and it’s sleeting and freezing rain. Cool, cool. The drive home is awful and turns to legit rain about halfway home. I call C on the way. I work on this money diary, drink water and eat popcorn when I get home.
* 12:45am: how did it get this late?!? Brush teeth, wash face and na-night.

Sunday: $440 (joint account)

* 8am: C makes coffee and toasts us bagels. I eat my bagel with chive cream cheese and drink my coffee while watching one episode of Selling Sunset. I am feeling a bit rough - sleep did not come easily last night due to my drinks. I chug water with some electrolytes and take three IBs. C wants to go to BJs so I shower and feel a lot more normal.
* 9:30am: off to BJs. This is a big shop since there’s a lot of restocking we need to do - olive oil, grapeseed oil, yogurt, eggs, chicken, veggies and fruit in bulk, protein powder, TP, paper towels, tissues, pecans, flour, chocolate covered almonds, coffee beans, butter, sandwich bread and more. 
* 11am: We listen to Lincoln Park and similar artists while we unload all the shit and C organizes the pantry in the laundry room and the deep freezer in our garage while I take on parceling out and vacuum sealing the chicken for our deep freezer. We go BJs every 3-4 months and buy most of our meat there, unless it’s a special occasion. Typically, our Market Basket weekly grocery bill is \~$75/week, which we know is great for two people. Our pantry is well stocked and if we skip a week of shopping, we usually can pull meals together from our deep freezer and pantry. We love to eat and learned how to cook and plan well. I make bread pretty regularly and always have homemade stocks available from veggie scraps, meat scraps and chicken bones, make our own dressings and sauces, etc. We have six gardens and several fruit trees/bushes and we spend a ridiculous amount of time towards the end of the season batch cooking, canning, roasting, etc. our veggies and fruits to store and eat throughout the winter months. 
* I eat the rest of the TJs orange chicken, rice and broccoli at some point. I also pull apart the rotisserie chicken we bought and make chicken salad with herbs from the garden, SPG, celery and red onion for lunches this week. I save the bones and scraps in my chicken stock bag in the freezer. C eats the rest of the marinated wings and roasted potatoes from earlier in the week and samples many bites of chicken salad as “quality control.” We talk about our dog and how much we both miss him and cry. I’m feeling super anxious about the upcoming holidays without him and C talks me off the ledge. Big feels. Big hugs. 
* 1:30pm: I smoke some weed to get myself together and clean the bathroom off our bedroom. C unloads the dryer and dumps the two loads of laundry on my reading couch for later. He heads outside to take down another tree. Crazy man. He also plants the garlic bulbs from earlier this week! I listen to *Himself*, make the bed and a marinade for a mini pork roast I had pulled out of the deep freezer for dinner - tons of garlic, olive oil, s&p, brown sugar - and prep some brussels and more potatoes to roast along side the pork. I slice up some apples and onions, pick some rosemary, thyme and sage from the garden and add everything to my largest cast iron pan. 
* 3pm: My sister went on a work trip up north and brought us back some groovy northern beers. We talk on the phone and it sounds like she and her two little boys need to get out of the house. She says she has some great cheese and meat snacks, too. Score! I make apple crisp for dessert while C picks up the house, folds the laundry and cleans the second bathroom. Pork, potatoes, brussels and crisp goes into the oven at 400 degrees and I set a timer to check everything in thirty minutes. 
* 4:45pm: The fam is here and the two boys are cutie-patooties! We play and chase and yell and eventually, eat cheese and meat snacks with crackers and fruit spread and enjoy the pork, brussels and potatoes and apple crisp for dessert. As I suspected, we kill all the food and there’s maybe a lunch portion leftover of everything. Around 7pm, we get them settled on the couch with Paw Patrol (they hardly ever watch TV but know they can here!) and my sister and I do our nails. I choose a vampy red, which will hopefully hold up through my trip to VT. C and our bro in law chat solar project stuff.
* 7:45pm: it’s pouring rain mixing with sleet again, so it’s time for them to say goodbye. Once they’re gone, we assess the damage and it’s not so bad. The dishwasher is on, the dishes are drying, and the table is clean. There’s some towels in the bathroom and a rogue diaper on the floor.
* 8:15pm: I pack my breakfast and lunch for tomorrow (pink oatmeal, the last of the egg salad over the last of the regular salad from Friday with a scoop of the chicken salad on top to bulk it up, two clementines, a meat stick and protein banana muffin) and brush my teeth. I get my workout clothes for tomorrow and set my alarm for 6am. I am sore from my box and lift class yesterday and I am so tired! I read for a half hour or so and call it quits by 9pm.

**Reflection: Yikes! If you read this far, well done and thanks.**

**This was a unique week with making over $200 on FB Marketplace and a big spend at BJs. This is our typical week in terms of entertainment and hobbies after work. I had no idea how LONG this would take (and be!!) and I’m super impressed by those of you who have submitted several times. I enjoyed this exercise and found it interesting to get all of our numbers in one spot, as well as to reflect on my upbringing and how it’s shaped my money habits today.  We are in a terrific spot financially and that feels good.**

**This is the first time in my life that I’ve tracked calories. As I mentioned, I went off BCP back in April and gained about 15lbs in four months, which was a big pill to swallow. I’m for sure in perimenopause and it blows. I knew I had to do something about the weight gain, so tracking calories + consistent exercise (which was already a habit) has worked so far for me.** ",7,1763910899.0,MoneyDiariesACTIVE,2,1.0,False

**INCIDENT DATE: NOV 6th, 1983**

It was a brisk walk to the main entrance—one of those parking-lot treks that wakes you up before the fluorescent lights do.  My truck was the third of two other cars out there. In less than a couple hours, the whole place would be packed, down to the last handicapped spot.

Some of the other techs complained when management asked us to leave the closer spaces for lab personnel. Never made much sense to me. We did most of the physical work, while half their day was spent behind a desk. But I didn’t complain. I’d taken enough orders in my life to know when something wasn’t worth arguing about.

Besides, I knew what the outside was like. I’d spent years in the union—no warm desks, no fresh coffee waiting for you in the morning. If you needed something quick, your best bet was whatever a gas station had behind fingerprinted glass. Compared to that, clocking into an air-conditioned space—seventy degrees all year round—still felt like getting away with something.

I held my badge to the reader. It flashed green. In the reflection, I caught the small worn photo on the front: a fresh twenty-eight-year-old me, smiling like an idiot.  *“D. Marin - Tech 3*.” They must’ve reprinted this badge a hundred times, and every damn time they use the same picture. Doesn’t even look like me anymore.

I scoffed at it and headed inside.

The long hallway flickered awake as the motion sensors caught me. The quiet broke under the echo of my squeaking boots, mixing with a woman’s voice. Up ahead, by the main elevators, a wall-mounted screen played the same ad it had played for months: grainy stock footage of a happy family overlaid with a soft, soothing woman's narration.

“*Your family can rest easy this holiday knowing Wexler Corp is with you. With our advanced testing technology, we can predict early infection signs and preventive measures. Get your diagnostics today*…”

I rolled my eyes and mouthed the last line along with her. “Helping you find the best version of yourself.”

The ding of the elevator doors was my cue. I stepped inside and descended toward the lower level.

As I passed below the first floor, a noise drifted up—something like a commotion. The elevator slowed. Stopped. On the other side of the doors, someone was speaking, frantic and muffled.

They slid open, and Eddie—night-shift tech—stood there looking like hell. His hair clung to his forehead; he was breathing hard, like he’d sprinted the whole corridor.  This was especially jarring considering how quiet he usually is.

I hit him with the obvious: “What the hell is going on?”

He stammered, “Don and I… we were in the suite… we saw the— the lights, you know? Room pressures were going crazy! The alarms, they’re going off everywhere!”

I held my hands up and stepped out, scanning the hallway. Don stood at the far end, phone to his ear.

“Okay,” I said, “Fucking relax, man. Room-pressure alarms come in all the time. This is normal.”

Eddie squeezed his eyes shut, pressing his fingers to his temple. “No, not just that. The building alarm system never displayed it. It— it must’ve been offline since yesterday, and no one noticed! We went in to work on something and then—”

His eyes shot past me.

“ARE THEY ANSWERING?” he shouted down the hall.

Don lowered the phone and shook his head. “Fuck. Nothing.”

I turned back to Eddie. “Okay, everybody stop. Who are you trying to call? Because if this were any other day, we’d be the people they call to fix it.”

Eddie grabbed my arm, his hand tight on the fabric.

“Daniel,” he said, voice low and shaking. “The freezers have been down. There’s water on the floor.”

The words hit me like a gut punch. My stomach dropped. My mind raced, flipping through emergency protocols I’d never actually expected to need.

I turned to Don. “KEEP TRYING! If they don’t answer, get out of here and block the entrance!”

Don nodded and rushed off.

I faced Eddie again. “Get your shit. We’re going up.”

The elevator numbers rose as my mind raced faster.

1st floor, 2nd floor…

“Okay, so there’s water on the floor,” I muttered. “Could be a leak from the pipes…”

Eddie cut in. “No, man, it ain’t a pipe leak—”

I snapped, “Shhh! Just shut up for a second. Let me think.”

Training after training flicked through my head—nothing sticking. I was an idiot for skipping through half those CBT modules.

5th floor, 6th floor…

“Fuck, man,” Eddie said, voice trembling. “I got my daughter’s birthday tomorrow.” He lowered his head. “You’re already thinking what we’ve all been thinking.”

I didn’t respond.

“DING.” The elevator chimed. 8th floor.

I stared into the crack between the doors—wanting to leave, wishing this was just another rough day.

They slid open. A barrage of alarms and flashing red lights met us. The power on this floor was out in various places; only the red strobes on the ceiling gave us enough light to see.

We moved fast toward the airlock.

“So the backup power failed too?” I asked.

“Never switched to backup,” he said through heavy breaths. “Don’t know why. It’s like this whole floor was never set up right when they did the updates.”

We reached the airlock. I scanned my badge and looked through the glass into the lab. A sheen hung in the air, like a light fog.

The doors opened as the light fog got sucked out of the lock and into the hallway.  It disappeared slowly.  I knew what that meant.  Some of the air handlers were down.  Room pressures are off.  The lab is freely flowing air straight out into the halls. 

Eddie didn’t notice and I didn’t make a mention of it.  We continue to rush into the airlock. 

We grabbed the positive-pressure suits on the wall, skipping half the gowning protocol.

As I pulled the air hose from the wall, I wondered what kind of severance package—if any—we’d get. It was clearly an engineering failure upstream, but they’d still find a way to blame us.

I hooked the compressed air line to my waist and felt the suit inflate. Eddie did the same. We disconnected and stepped through the airlock.

The thick entrance door slid aside, opening into quiet, foggy chaos.

“The dry ice tanks are leaking,” Eddie said over the comm. “That’s why we can’t see shit.”

“That’s the least of my concerns,” I said.

My boot hit the wet floor. I followed the puddle through the fog to the freezer entrance. The heavy, gasketed door sat open. Water flowed from it like a slow bleed.

“Why the fuck is this open? What were you guys doing in here?” I asked, stunned.

“We weren’t anywhere near this thing, man! We just came in to read the room flows!”

I stepped into the walk-in—shelves of vials lining both walls. On the floor, beneath the fog, lay the truth.

I backed out slowly. There was nothing more to see. I shut the door and pulled the latch until it thudded shut.

Eddie watched me like a child waiting to be told the verdict.

“You’re not going to that party tomorrow, Eddie,” I said softly. “Neither of us are going anywhere.”

His eyes widened. “You’re fucking with me. Daniel… what did you see?”

The words left me hollow. “Broken vials on the floor. A whole shelf. They’re mixing with the water.”

“Jesus Christ!” he said, stumbling back. I grabbed his arm before he slipped.

“Stop. Listen to me. You’re safe, okay? You’re wearing a suit. Positive pressure. Nothing gets in.”

He nodded rapidly, holding his breath.

“Breathe, man. You can breathe.” He gasped, tears forming inside his hood.

I knew I’d just given hope to a dead man.

It had been about an hour. We sat on the floor of the airlock across from each other, still in our suits. Eddie stared at the ceiling. I stared at him, picturing his daughter, his wife. He was my age when I first started at Wexler. Probably making decent pay too. I hoped he took the max on his life insurance.

Don still hadn’t checked in. Last we heard, he’d made it to the main gate and was talking to senior officials. They were “aware of the situation.”

“So what do you think caused it?” Eddie asked. “Someone broke something and got scared to tell anyone?”

“No. There was a CO₂ tank in the corner of the freezer. Top was blown off. That’s the fog. It exploded.”

“No way! Who the fuck would leave a tank in there?”

“We use them for general checks. You take one in, refill lines if needed, then head out. Simple. Do it every month.”

Eddie hesitated. “So… did you leave one in there?”

I chuckled darkly. “Yeah, Ed. Guess I did. Really fucking stupid mistake for a senior tech, right?”

“Bro… fuck, man. They’re gonna tear you apart for that. And the CDC’s definitely getting involved.”

“Oh, no doubt. They have every reason to let me go. Guess I just wasn’t thinking.” I swallowed hard.

My walkie lit up.

I grabbed it. “Don, what’ve you got?”

A woman’s voice answered instead. “Hello Mr. Marin. How is everyone feeling up there?”

Eddie and I exchanged a glance.

“Oh, just peachy,” I said. “We’re taking a little extended break. How’re you guys down there?”

Silence.

“Who is that?” Eddie whispered.

“Probably some big wig,” I muttered.

The voice returned. “We’re sending up an SHR representative to take vitals and ask some questions. Please stay put.”

“10-4.”

Eddie frowned. “An HR person?”

I snorted. “No. S.H.R. Synthetic Human Replacement.”

Eddie looked stunned. “Holy shit. I’ve never seen one in real life.”

“Nothin’ special,” I said. “Job stealers. She’s gonna want us to take these suits off.”

“No, man,” he said quickly. “That’s dangerous—”

“We’re in the airlock. You already stepped in here without a suit earlier. It doesn’t matter.”

“I just don’t think it’s safe. We’re dealing with airborne Delta Variant. What if spores got in?”

“Then there’s nothing we can do. We were at risk the second we got here.”

He slammed his fist on the floor. “FUCK! FUCK! FUCK!” His last hit landed limp. Tears filled his eyes. “What am I supposed to tell my family? They’re not even gonna let us out of here. Eveline is gonna be so pissed.”

The elevator doors opened. Through the glass we saw her—synthetic woman, all white jumpsuit, shaved head, skin too perfect. She carried a small bag.

She knelt in front of the glass.

“Hello, Mr. Marin and Mr. Martinez,” her muffled voice said. “I’m going to breach the airlock now. Please stay where you are.”

The doors hissed open. She stepped inside.

Eddie jumped in quick. “What’re you gonna do with us? Are we fucked?”

“Please stay calm, Mr. Martinez. I need you to remove your suits so I can run tests.”

“But are we going to be stuck up here? When will they let us see our family?”

“I can’t answer that right now. I just need your cooperation.”

Defeated, Eddie leaned back. I began removing my suit as it deflated.

She cleaned my arm with a cold pad, her blue eyes empty as the syringe slid into my arm.

“So what’s happening out there?” I asked. “News crews? Hazmat teams?”

“We’ve deployed other SHR units around the perimeter. No human is allowed in at this time.”

Eddie cut in. “What about Don? The night tech?”

“He’s quarantined on the property. I believe he’s undergoing the same tests as we speak.”

She drew Eddie’s blood next and placed both vials into a small machine. The display faced away from us.

A long analog beep sounded. She checked the results, then silently began packing up.

Eddie’s voice cracked. “Hey—what does it say?”

She ignored his request. 

“Thank you for your cooperation.  Place stay put until further instruction.”

“WHAT DOES IT SAY?” he shouted as she walked out.

I should’ve felt something. Fear. Rage. Something. I envied Ed’s panic—it meant he still had something to lose.

I was furious with myself. Furious that my mistake could take a father from his family. Maybe two, counting Don. If I had a gun, I’d hand it to Ed and tell him to shoot me twice.

I replayed it again and again. How could I do something so stupid? I tried convincing myself it wasn’t me—but I was the only one who worked on that freezer. Seven years. SME. Subject Matter Expert.

Doesn’t mean shit now.

“Screw it,” Eddie said. “I’m going out.”

“No. We could be contagious.”

“To who? The robots?” He pushed out of the airlock. “I just want to look out the window.”

He wasn’t wrong, so I followed.

I met him at the 8th floor window. We looked down. The whole parking lot was filled with trucks and white tents. Synthetics moved equipment back and forth. Beyond the gate, emergency lights pulsed in red and blue.

“Holy shit,” Eddie whispered. “We’re never getting out of here.”

A low rumble shook the building. Something slid across the roof. A massive white tarp slowly lowered over the top of the window frame and met the bottom, blotting out the morning light. The hallway went dim.

“They’re tarping the building,” I said.

Eddie turned and ripped a sanitizer dispenser off the wall, hurling it down the hallway.  A voice echoed amongst the destruction.  The TV ad.

“*Helping you become the best version of—*”

 He punched the TV screen beside the elevator, shattering it mid-ad.

Glass spider-webbed under his fist.

I spoke softly. “I’m so sorry, Ed. This is all my fault.”

He wiped his face.  His head hung below his shoulders and his fist still pressed into the glass.  “It’s okay. Shit happens, man. And it’s not all your fault. If the right precautions were in place, this never would’ve happened. You’d think a billion-dollar company could keep up with preventive maintenance.”

He let out a defeated laugh.

“I got a pack of cigarettes in my desk drawer in the lower level.  What do you say we go smoke em?” I suggest.

Ed nods in approval.  “That sounds great.”

My feet rest on the desk in front of me. The back of my chair is adjusted as far as it can lean.

Eddie is playing music out loud on some old computer speakers and blowing smoke toward the ceiling.

The room fills with a relaxing haze.

“Oh… wait. I got the perfect one,” he says as he makes a few clicks on the keyboard. The current music stops, replaced with “The End of the World” by Skeeter Davis.

Ed leans back slowly and takes another long drag.

I look his way as we share a laugh.

“Oh yeah. This is perfect,” I add.

He exhales and looks toward me in thought.

I see a question behind his eyes. 

“Shoot,” I say.

“Who you got wondering where you are right now?”

“Hah. Nobody, man. I’m a lone soul.”

“You mean no one at all? Brothers, sisters, girlfriend?”

“Nope. Kids live with their mother in Colorado. They don’t talk to me anyways.”

“Oh shit. I didn’t know you had kids.”

“Yeah, they’re teenagers now. Mom convinced them I was cheating on her.”

“Well… were you?”

“Shit no, man. No. It was an excuse. Built up this whole story in her head. She was looking for a way out I think.”

“Damn. I didn’t know.”

“What about you, though? Tell me about your daughter.”

Eddie takes a deep inhale. “Man, where do I start? She’s amazing. Beautiful. Got her mother’s eyes. She’s what keeps me going every day. No matter how hard my day is, I know that when I get back home, she’ll be fresh out of bed and running to me with a hug. The whole world just melts away, man.”

“That’s beautiful, Ed.”

He nods silently. “She’s gonna be four tomorrow. I got this Barbie bicycle sitting in the garage. She’s been asking for it for a year now.”

Tears fall from his cheeks. “I really wanted to see her face when I opened that garage door.”

I adjust and lean my elbows over my knees. The room fills with silence and regrets.

The song comes to a close.

“How long do you think it’ll be?” Eddie asks quietly.

“How long till what?”

“Till we start getting sick.”

I check the watch on my wrist. “Been about six hours. Probably midday. It’ll come on fast.”

Eddie feels his forehead with his hand and then sniffs deeply.

“Yeah, I ain’t feel nothing yet.”

We can still feel the rumbling of trucks and helicopters from above. I wonder what they’re asking over the walkies right about now. Left mine upstairs. Didn’t see how I’d have much use for it now.

He continues, “You know how many hours I’ve given to this company? How many things I missed out on?” 

“Tell me about it.”

“If I could take it back, I’d get back every time I was supposed to show up.” His eyes look like they’re replaying memories from a past that could have been.

I sit now imagining what my own life would have looked like.

“I would have fought,” I say to Ed, but also to myself.  

“I would have fought harder to learn about the new person my wife was becoming. I would have fought for my kids. I would have… just fucking tried, ya know?”

My words settle like dust on all the surfaces of the room.

We both share a moment in our silence as the reminder of our situation flows back into the room.  

The dimly lit desk lamps flicker. The sounds of commotion recede—trucks leaving, synth radio communications going quiet. It’s just us now.

A thought crawls into my mind.

“Wanna go check out some daylight before it’s over?”

“Walk out?” Ed asks.

“Yeah, why not? Worst they can do is shoot us.”

He breaks from contemplation with a nod of approval.

The halls leading to the entrance are too quiet. No hum from the circuits. They’re shutting down power.

We come to the long tarp draped over the doors. Ed searches his pocket, pulling out a utility knife. I hold the main door open as he cuts away at the thick tarp. Daylight breaks through the slit. 

Cool, fresh air washes across our faces. It smells so good. We take turns squeezing through.

I know it was only yesterday since I last stood in sunlight, but for some reason it feels like it’s been years.

Outside, to our surprise, we find the parking lot empty. Half-built white tents sit abandoned, some collapsed on the ground. We scan the horizon. No trucks in sight. They left in a hurry.

“The hell?” Eddie says.

A low hum rides the wind. I look up. High in the empty sky, I spot a single black hover craft moving directly over us.

My body feels weightless.  My usual back pain is numb.  It’s backwards, but I feel a great sense of peace.

Both of us are fixed on the craft when I speak. “I know I already said it, but I’m sorry again, Ed.”

He lights another cigarette and takes a drag before responding.

1p4oxdh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rants/comments/1p4oxdh/idk_how_tf_to_deal_with_this_shit/,Idk how tf to deal with this shit.,"Sooo, at the youth shelter im living at for the moment, a good friend of mine who il call Jane, also lives here, and she decided she likes, and wanted to date another person i know who lives here (and i am not a fan of). She knows that ive known him for a few years now, and she knows the bad history between us, so she came and talked to me about him because she was second guessing herself, so i gave her my honest take, I dont think they would be a good match and she would get hurt. 

Il call him John, John has a slew of mental health problems, schizophrenia being one of them, and he goes in circles. He will be good and behave for a while, then he will cause all hell to break loose, before behaving again, then letting all hell again.
Well, she did atleast say thank you for being honest and didnt get upset, but went and dated him anyways. 

Friday night, he started picking a loud fight with her, then one of my roomates yelled at John to stfu because it was 1am and he went off the rails. The roomate went outside and they had a screaming match, i ended up following him outside a few mins later, but said nothing, went directly to the far side of the lawn to watch and hit my vape. 

The second i stepped outside he immediately started shit with me, i said nothing untill yelled at, but still kept walking away. Couple mins later, cops show up, at first hes calm and talking to them, then all the sudden he starts fighting them and gets forced to goto the hospital for a mental health hold. 

They let him out a few hours later, he came back and immediately started starting shit again. Jane was having a really bad day so we went to go grab Coffee and chat, were sitting in the smoking area, ive finally got jane smiling and laughing again, John barges outside comes over and just immediately starts screaming at Jane despite her asking for some space, then John hit Jane and i stepped in between them, Cops came again but didnt take John this time. 

Later that same day, i go over to the corner store to grab some chips and pop for a movie night, as im walking back hes headed the other way screaming at shelter people across the road, sees me, starts yelling at me and kept walking towards me, then just started swinging, got ganged up on and got his ass beat. Cops came, Ambulace came, Ambulance took him, and are now investigating us. 

Now onto today, John came back yet a 3rd time, still dont know why he hasnt been kicked out but eh, and b-lines it for Jane who has made clear she needs space for a few days. Well, screaming match breaks out, i come outside, staff come outside, and thats when John started swinging on Jane, so staff stand there like a bunch of pussies while me and a few other residents who were outside go racing over to get him off her, cops show up yet again, and this time they finally took him. 

Things still havent calmed down 100% yet, but i tried to go sit with Jane and check on her, but i guess now im the biggest asshole on the face of the planet because i didnt stop her from dating John..... like broooo. I warned you, you didnt listen, then i protected your ass, made sure you were ok, and cheered you up, but im the asshole? Really now..... ",0,1763910408.0,Rants,0,0.5,False

The U.S. Export-Import Bank (EXIM) will invest $100 billion to secure U.S. and allied supply chains for critical minerals, nuclear energy and liquefied natural gas, the organisation's chair John Jovanovic told the Financial Times in an interview published on Sunday.

The first tranche of deals will include projects in Egypt, Pakistan and Europe, Jovanovic told the newspaper, adding that the West was over-reliant on supplies of these critical materials that ""are no longer fair"".

""We can't do anything else that we're trying to do without these underlying critical raw material supply chains being secure, stable and functioning,"" he was quoted saying.

Jovanovic told the FT that the bank's early deals would include a credit insurance guarantee for $4 billion of natural gas being delivered to Egypt by New York-based commodities group Hartree Partners, and a $1.25 billion loan for the Reko Diq mine being developed by Barrick Mining in Pakistan.

The bank has $100 billion left to deploy of the $135 billion authorized by Congress, he said.

EXIM did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours.

The investment aligns with U.S. President Donald Trump's energy-dominance agenda.

Trump had campaigned on a promise to increase U.S. energy output and has sought to roll back energy and environmental regulations since taking office in January.

# FORM YOUR OWN OPINIONS & CONCLUSIONS ABOVE:

[Elk Creek is the only U.S. facility capable of producing SEVEN critical oxides on one site — Niobium, Scandium \(plus aluminum-scandium alloys\), Titanium dioxide and TiCl₄, and the magnet-grade REEs Nd, Pr, Dy, and Tb. No other American project comes close to that scope, especially on the heavy rare earth side. \\""TO MAKE STUFF!\\""](https://reddit.com/link/1p4osu7/video/u2862tsxs03g1/player)

IMHO-

NioCorp is entering the most strategically important phases in its history. If Elk Creek secures its long-awaited project financing, it becomes the **only U.S. facility capable of producing seven critical oxides on one site** — Niobium, scandium (plus aluminum-scandium alloys), Titanium dioxide and TiCl₄, and the magnet-grade REEs Nd, Pr, Dy, and Tb. No other American project comes close to that scope, especially on the heavy rare earth side. The full flowsheet in the 2022 Feasibility Study already outlines integrated separation of these oxides on-site; all that’s missing is capital to turn it on. With assays trending positively, the resource case keeps strengthening, but the real bottleneck is the last step: final financing.

On **Nov. 21, 2025**, NioCorp’s board quietly added a **six-month shareholder rights plan** (a classic “poison pill”). This isn’t because a takeover is happening **— it’s a temporary shield designed to keep predatory actors from scooping up control while the company is in the middle of the most important negotiation window of its life.** Rights plans legally must expire in months, not years, and NioCorp’s May 21, 2026 expiration date lines up almost perfectly with the expected financing decision window. In other words, management is locking the gates just long enough to get through FID without disruption.

This timing now looks even more relevant because of today’s news: the **U.S. Export-Import Bank is deploying $100B** toward securing Western supply chains for critical minerals, LNG, and nuclear fuels. EXIM’s chair directly emphasized how the West is overly dependent on unstable suppliers, and their early deals include major mining and energy projects across allied jurisdictions. The bank still has **$100B left to deploy**, and its mandate explicitly matches the type of strategic, U.S.-based, supply-chain-critical project that Elk Creek represents. The geopolitical stars have never aligned more tightly for domestic niobium, scandium, and heavy REEs.

[STAY TUNED because per \\""Dingman\\"" - February 2026 might unlock more Scandium Aluminum Alloy news with Defense prime Lockheed & more!  The Catalysts are STACKED!!! ](https://reddit.com/link/1p4osu7/video/7ali8gjjt03g1/player)

Put these facts together and the picture becomes clearer: NioCorp’s temporary rights plan looks like a **protective bridge** meant to get the company safely from late-2025 through what could be the decisive financing 2026 period — including potential EXIM involvement. If diligence continues, partnerships lock in, and the capital stack finalizes, that puts NioCorp in realistic striking distance of **FID by mid-2026**. Once that happens, the project rerates, the defensive measures expire naturally, and Elk Creek transitions into construction as the first full-spectrum, vertically integrated U.S. oxides complex!

# Elk Creek’s “U.S. National Security Asset” moment has arrived! — 🛰️⚡

[Waiting for MORE CORE = MORE ORE](https://reddit.com/link/1p4osu7/video/oa909vezt03g1/player)

***NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project delivers the full SEVEN-material punch the U.S. defense and aerospace base is starving for:*** 

**Niobium** for high-strength, high-temperature alloys that survive hypersonic heat; **scandium** for ultra-light, ultra-tough aluminum alloys; **Sc-Al alloys** for next-generation fighter, UAV, and space structures; **Titanium dioxide and TiCl₄** for the titanium metal that aircraft, missiles, satellites, and naval platforms literally depend on; and the four magnet rare earths—**Nd, Pr, Dy, Tb**—that power every high-performance actuator, guidance system, electric propulsion motor, and high-temperature aerospace magnet in the DoD inventory. Together, these seven materials form the backbone of modern U.S. capabilities from F-35s to hypersonic gliders, from directed-energy systems to advanced drones and space assets. This is exactly why defense primes like Lockheed identified multiple platform-level applications: Elk Creek aligns directly with the most urgent and irreplaceable supply-chain gaps, giving the U.S. a single-site domestic source for the alloys, feedstocks, and high-temp magnet elements that 21st-century national security cannot function without!

1p4ordu,https://www.reddit.com/r/harfordcountymd/comments/1p4ordu/want_to_know_ultimate_goal_of_life/,want to know ultimate goal of life ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

We're considering the Gaggia Brera but are confused about pricing. Are there different version, beyond the silver and black models?

Here in the Netherlands it is sold at a few places (like [koffiewarenhuis.nl](https://www.koffiewarenhuis.nl/producten/gaggia-brera)) for 550 Euro, but [Amazon.nl](https://www.amazon.nl/-/en/Gaggia-RI9305-coffee-machine-sprayer/dp/B002Y2ZLEW/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2R969UTHT0LM&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.GP48G3tLE1RAasu6L_3zpbiUmGrX4cn13dADLes_JgG2t8JoXmaHujEZrPVbg-CtZK2edhY_H6m0-gevcoWCt5628YMCEajqIrsV80ygbDHnquuiFUr1Jk0d-gYjoenW-R6l1R7cGBQNdbKv2eukNCvhGXdgbG2ajdAgBmAubUkjYW_YGemZilyBEEa7MC7X5sGmIbM73YqGK-U7r77fH-I3F2kKg4SmrZM0zwPlnqUWCRB8xk0zeEGNK361zJneLA-NdBfbdnQBZjC-XrggRy_xHy7wmBGL-a0O5iPJvUg._nNsak8lwqdCMXLqxU8cuVF46_AXcDBsMIFMKa8G94k&dib_tag=se&keywords=gaggia+brera&qid=1763892811&sprefix=gaggia+brera%2Caps%2C153&sr=8-2) and [coffeeitalia.nl](https://www.coffeeitalia.nl/gaggia-brera-zilver.html) have it for around 330-350 Euro, and that doesn't seem to be Black Friday deals either.

This makes me wonder if they're the same model. For such a comparably inexpensive machine that is a substantial price difference.

Lastly, would you know if all Breras are made in Italy?

1p4ooz8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/1p4ooz8/post_ralp_day_27/,Post RALP Day 27,"Good morning amigos. I had my official follow-up Friday, which included the final pathology report. The bottom line is my results were “favorable.” Here are some stats: tumor was 15% of total tissue. No extra-prostetic extension.  Right edge had 2 mm spot on the exterior.  Intraductal cells not identified. Cribiform not identified.  No cancer in seminal vesicles or bladder neck. Diagnosis= PT2.  

In the world of Prostate Cancer, I feel very lucky. First PSA test will be in January, and until then, I will be pretty nervous. 

The ARPN was shocked that I am not using any pads this early, another thing to feel very lucky about. I credit this to my surgeon, and my own fanatical approach to preparation. I don’t really know why, though. ED is my front-line issue. I am using a pump daily, and taking 5 mg Cialis. Muscle pain in the limbs is a side-effect of Cialis, and I’m definitely having that in my shoulders.  It’s always towards the end of the 24 hour cycle, before my next dose. I can live with it in the interest of “raising the Jolly Roger” again. The nurse said not to stress it this early, and I’m not. 

I have some soreness around one incision site. I got a lecture about over-doing it, which I took to heart. Maintaining a healing mindset when you feel good and want to do normal stuff is hard. 

What else? Coffee, alcohol, and spicy food are all tough on the recovering bladder, and will instigate leaks.  Coffee is worth it, so I plan for it in the morning. Booze and spicy food are mostly “on the bench” still, but sometimes I say fuck it, and enjoy life. 

My biggest challenge at this stage is what do I do with these feelings of overwhelming gratitude? It’s a good problem.  

Thank you to everyone who shares the good, the bad, and the ugly here. Every story helps someone.  I never thought having cancer would restore my faith in people.  

Good luck everyone. ",8,1763909824.0,ProstateCancer,3,1.0,False

The world is soft and gray. A cool morning chill is in the air. Your thoughts are still fuzzy, floating. The day hasn't really begun yet. The gentle sound of coffee brewing. You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song. You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

I have a habit of rushing to get things done as quickly as possible. LO is 5 months old and I've worked really hard to calm down and take things slow. If things take longer, so be it. I don't want to be stressed around her all the time.

On work days (we both work), I bring the baby in the bathroom with me while I get ready so he can sleep a little longer. In the evening, I don't always get to really get ready for bed. After I put her down, the kitchen needs cleaned up and shut down. My husband helps with this but lays on his phone while I get her ready for bed. Then I want to relax a bit. She often wakes up around the time I would shower so I scramble to brush my teeth and thats normally it. I miss my skin care routine lol.

Last night, I was exhausted but felt I should shower because I know I have limited time in the morning (Sunday morning before Church). My husband says obviously he's there in the morning so you'll be able to shower then. So I go straight to bed.

This morning, she's up at 7:20 (slept in lol yay). We play in bed for 20 minutes or so, then I take her with me to shower and get ready. Shower was face and body wash only. I don't wear more makeup than concealer and I don't do more to my hair then up in a claw clip. She started getting fussy while I was getting dressed. I hand the baby off and he just lays there in bed while she makes clearly annoyed noises. I try on one outfit that I don't like. I know I'm on borrowed time and need to start rushing. He is mad at me, says it takes me too long to get ready. He says you cant take an hour and try on so many outfits. It's been 20 minutes, one outfit. I say he could take her down to make the coffee like I do every morning. Maybe she needs a change of scenery. He puts her down and I hear her. Yes, I know she needs some independence and she normally does pretty well. Likely is hungry. I give up on the cute outfit of a dress and put on jeans and a sweater so I can go take care of her. He goes to get ready.

He's telling me I'm rude. I tell him he agreed to this last night and I feel he isn't being nice about it. He goes early to teach and I take care of her and hold her for her nap. I'm nap trapped, no breakfast or anything to drink. Will scramble out the door later. No goodbye, no offering to get me anything while I sit here.

I'm frustrated because in the end exactly what I expected to happen, happened. He actually took longer to get ready than me. I know he isn't a morning person, but we are adults with a child. It is 8am, not 5am. Why is it so hard to sit up and play with her so I can get ready. Even if it does take me an hour. Why does it matter? He agreed to help.

I backed these glasses specifically because I wanted to take calls without headphones glued to my head all day.

The call quality is actually pretty solid. I've taken probably 30+ calls through these over the past three weeks and only had one person ask me to repeat myself. Most people say I sound clear on their end, maybe slightly different than phone audio but totally usable for professional calls. On my end, I can hear fine and volume gets loud enough even with background noise.

What I really like is being able to walk around during calls. I've taken calls while making coffee, doing dishes, even walking my dog once (probably looked insane to neighbors but whatever).

The notification glances are handy too. I can see if an urgent message comes in without obviously checking my phone.
Downsides: Music quality through these is pretty mediocre, so don't expect to use them for that. Also the battery drains faster when you're on calls constantly, I get maybe 4 hours of heavy call use versus 8+ hours of normal wear. Not a dealbreaker but means I charge them during lunch.

Pagkalabas namin ng cafe sa city, nag aya ako na maglakad lakad sa plaza, on our way, I saw two familiar faces - ex and wife nya. I knew he noticed, the woman probably knew me too kasi they smiled at each other tapos habang nagkasalubong kami, etong friend ko tawa ng tawa tapos sabi nya talaga pagdaan sa tapat namin “di ba ex mo yun?” Jusko nilingon pa ng friend ko hahaha 
At ang sabi ng friend ko, it’s like my ex was grinning like dude, cheater ka, it’s been 2 years and I am genuinely happy for you but we gotta mature lol

When I say gwapo ang boyfriend ko, lahat pati kapitbahay ko tinawag ako para sabihing gwapo nga daw hahaha sa comment section ng picture nya sa ig ko talagang sinasabihan syang “gwapo” ng mga kakilala ko and he is more than that face - not perfect, but I really hope he is as true and sincere as his words, when we met with my friends.

1p4oeoq,https://i.redd.it/odvaqo0ar03g1.jpeg,"My DoorDash Villain Origin Story: The Man, The Myth, The Coffee Lid!","So I’m a little annoyed… actually no, I’m a lot annoyed. I haven’t been dashing long, but I take ANY job seriously and my personality is competitive enough that if a rating even looks at me wrong, I feel it in my soul. Every time I open the app, my ratings punch me in the throat. Why? Well, My ratings are being held hostage by ONE MAN. ONE singular BUTT HURT MAN, My arch-nemesis. My DoorDash Voldemort. He Who Should Not Be Ordering Starbucks. 

This happened on like my 3rd or 4th dash ever. Baby DoorDasher energy. I get an order from Starveez (yes, that’s exactly how it felt). I’m still in the “yes DoorDash, anything for you DoorDash” honeymoon phase. I pick up a Starbucks order, the baristas seal the bag like they’re packaging evidence from a crime scene, and I’m even ahead of schedule. I’m walking up to this house like I’m about to win Employee of the Month for a job that doesn’t even have employees. Acting like I’m about to win some imaginary DoorDash Olympics.

The order instructions are screaming at me in all caps:
“LEAVE AT DOOR. DON’T RING. DON’T KNOCK. JUST LEAVE.”
Got it. Easy. I’m basically a ninja with a latte.

I walk up, go to place the bag down gently like it’s a newborn kitten, —the air is calm, the birds are chirping, and then BAM! The door EXPLODES open like this man has been crouched behind it waiting for me in full ambush mode. Like holayyy I’m surprised one of the hinges didn’t hop a ride in my pocket.  Anyways, I jump back, say the customer’s name, he says “nah duhh🙄” , then snatches the bag like we’re playing NFL tug-of-war. And I’m just shook, stunned, astonished, I feel like a deer trapped in front of headlights! Cause there’s no way this interaction is real right now! It all happened so fast! In the process, I literally hear the coffee lid pop like it’s going into orbit! 

Instantly, he blames me.
“You need to go get me a new coffee.”

Sir… YOU are the one who Hulk-grabbed it. I didn’t even get to breathe near the drink.

I calmly explain to him, damn near like a hostage negotiator, that I can’t do that since the order is technically delivered in perfect condition. ALTHOUGH I still offer (because I’m a decent human and brand-new at this) to call the store AND DoorDash to see if they’ll let me replace it. He looks at me, says “fxck that,” and slams the door in my face.

Cool. Alrighty then! Enjoy your lukewarm rage and slightly damp coffee sleeve.

Next day: ding—a shiny 1-star rating with “mishandled order.” From him. Of course.

Now fast forward: I get him again recently. I brace myself. My soul leaves my body. But everything goes fine. He behaves. I behave. The vibes are shockingly civil. The universe seems at peace.

Then he hits me with a 2-star! & A little Note : “just so you never forget me” like a freaking parting gift?! 

This was purely Out of spite. OUT OF PURE SPITE.

At this point, THIS ONE MAN , ONE COFFEE is single-handedly, one bean at a time literally anchoring my ratings down like a petty little shipwreck. I’ve done over 200 orders—almost perfect scores across the board—and then there’s… him. My personal villain. My personal DoorDash nemesis. My unwanted recurring character. The reason my score will never know the joy of seeing a full 5 stars.

So DoorDash drivers—how do y’all deal with ratings from customers who seem to exist purely to hate? Because this man is living in my stats rent-free like a gremlin and I’m tired. Will these stats ever drop? Have you guys been able to get specific customers banned from your own deliveries ? Have you ever had a customer ambush you at the door even when the instructions scream “NO HUMAN CONTACT”?

We just got the all in one espresso and coffee maker. Overall the build seems good and I like a lot of the features. 

The first espresso I tried to make the flow was good and everything seemed to be working as intended.

Now every subsequent one I’ve tried to make the flow from the spigots is anemic at best. I’ve tried the single and the double. I’ve never owned an espresso machine before so I thought maybe I was tamping down the grounds too much and that was blocking the flow but I seem to be getting the anemic flow regardless of how strongly or gently I tamp the grounds.  

Any ideas on what might be causing this issue?

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.

1p4oa4t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxietyhelp/comments/1p4oa4t/these_supplements_and_lifestyle_changes_actually/,These supplements and lifestyle changes actually helped me!,"I've been battling anxiety for several years. Been through waking up at night with heart racing, palpitations (including heart missing beats), as well as panic attacks in broad daylight. I've been experimenting with a couple of supplements and lifestyle changes for several years now. Here's a list of things that helped me and will definitely improve (maybe even cure) your situation:

\- This is some of the groundwork: Make sure your body doesn't lack essential vitamins, and you eat well. Nutrition can change a lot in your body, and lacking vitamins or eating unhealthy food can also be a root cause of anxiety. Especially in the US, it's very easy to eat unhealthily. Reduce sugars and avoid eating too much sodium. A lot of food in the US has excessive amounts of these two, so check the labels before you buy. The easiest way to avoid these is by cooking for yourself with fresh ingredients and not relying too much on processed foods. Also remember that your body turns flour directly into sugar, which includes bread, breading, tortillas, noodles etc. Avoid or substitute with things made from whole wheat flour. I also recommend taking a vitamin complex each day, which should include vitamin D. 

\- Avoid coffee, Red Bull, excessive amounts of tea, or anything else with caffeine. This should be a no-brainer, but many people are coffee addicts. Caffeine increases your heart rate and can trigger a feeling of uneasiness and anxiety.

\- Cardio workout 3 times a week. This can be as simple as power walking for just 30 minutes or even dancing. Cardio reduces stress hormones like cortisol and increases serotonin and endorphins.

\- Let your body calm down before bedtime. Don't play stressful games, don't watch thrillers or horror movies, don't doom-scroll or argue on social media. Do some guided meditation exercises on Youtube before bedtime or just meditate by yourself, focusing on your breathing and imagining yourself immersed in a serene scene for a few minutes.

\- Supplements: I am aware that supplements can sometimes trigger anxiety psychologically, but the ones below are fully natural, made by reputable brands, and are known for having no side effects. They’re a far gentler option than chemically produced prescription ""hammers"":

\- GABAplex by Swanson. This is the holy grail supplement for me. It calms you down within an hour, and the effect lasts a whole day. GABA ""puts the brakes"" on overactive neural signaling, and the L-amino acids (L-tyrosine, L-glycine, L-theanine) support stress relief. Plus, it's super cheap. 

\- Calm by Nature's nutrition. Also, super cheap. This is a vitamin B complex including a mix of calming herbs, many of them known for reducing anxiety. Almost the same ingredients as ""F'ing Anxiety,"" which is a rip-off. Take 1 pill before a stressful day or before bedtime.

\- Valerian root mixes, for instance: Valerian, Chamomile & Hops by Swanson or Restorative Herbal Sleep by Zzzquil. Not super-necessary, but great before bedtime, especially combined with meditation. I also take it before flights, and it fixes about 90% of my flight anxiety.

Hope these findings help you as much as they’ve helped me in dealing with anxiety. 🍀

1p4o83e,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p4o83e,LOOKING FOR INVESTORS AND FINANCERS!,"Hi! I’m currently looking for someone who’s open to investing in or financing a small, but passionate and well–thought-out business. I’m from Cebu, and I’ve already tried different kinds of selling over the years, which helped me understand what customers want and how a business grows.

Ever since, I’ve always dreamed of putting up my own shop. But because of life circumstances and financial limitations, I haven’t been able to fully pursue it. Still, I’ve been building my skills step by step.

I have experience making satin ribbon rose bouquets, crafting fuzzy flower arrangements, and selling cosmetics and coffee from home. I’ve attached some sample photos, including the small shop page I’ve already started. I also create content on TikTok, beauty product reviews, mini vlogs, and more. So I already have a growing platform to promote future products.

My plan is to open a small, cozy coffee shop in a strategic and accessible location, preferably near schools, workplaces, or a busy street. I want it to be the kind of place where students can study, workers can rest, and anyone can enjoy affordable but good-quality coffee and pastries. Meals may be added later, but the main focus will always be the coffee.

Inside the shop, I imagine a warm, inviting space with self-help books that customers can freely read during their stay. There will also be designated corners for cosmetics, fuzzy flowers, and even K-pop merch, because these items have real demand, especially among the teenagers. I want the shop to feel like a little world of interests, where customers can discover more than just drinks.

One unique addition I hope to include is a small self-shoot studio, where customers can take their own photos. Videos will be free, especially for birthdays or special occasions, so they can bring home memories along with their coffee.

If you’re someone who believes in supporting small but passionate entrepreneurs, I would genuinely appreciate your help. This isn’t just a business idea, I’ve been dreaming of this for so long, and with the right support, I truly believe it can grow into something meaningful.

Thank you so much for taking the time to read this. 🥹🩷",1,1763908588.0,SmallBusinessPH,0,1.0,False

1.  Being able to rearrange the ingredients/ Stack ingredients

4. Zoom out feature (Points 1,3 and 4 are correlated)
5. No need for the energy feature please. It feels like a really cheap move for such a good game.
6. More game modes! Maybe a rush hour mode, where you get multiple customers at once and have to deal with all their orders together (Love stressing myself out).
7. More toppings! I love sprinkles but only one drink uses it :( We could also do with some more cute toppings just to make the drinks look good.
8. More flavours! Caramel syrup & Matcha are popular here.
9. Different mug types- customers can ask for a cup to-go! And you can put a lid and straw (it has no function, its just cute)
10. The milk cooler is so empty :( We would love some more options there too!
11. Buddies! Like in GPGP, especially for milk steaming, dear lord.
12. I'm kind of confused as to what the point is to the train station, in terms of functionality.

1p4o4tb,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingIceland/comments/1p4o4tb/trip_report_for_early_july_iceland_itinerary/,"Trip Report for Early July: Iceland Itinerary, Helpful Tips and Google My Maps","**Iceland Ring Road – 2 Week Itinerary Recap**

We went to Iceland in early July and wanted to share our itinerary as well as some tips, packing list, Google My Maps, etc. We rented a car and drove the full Ring Road over two weeks, stayed in hotels/guesthouses/apartments, and ate out for almost every meal. I've included alternate accommodations, restaurants and points of interest so you can tailor the trip to your preferences.

I’ll post our Google My Maps at the end which is organized by each day of the trip. We skipped the Westfjords due to time constraints - but it’s definitely worth considering if you have extra days. We lucked out with incredible weather and avoided crowds by starting early and visiting some spots in the evening when they were quieter. We never felt rushed and had plenty of time to enjoy every stop to fullest. We somewhat frontloaded the trip with more hiking and activities and toward the end did more museums, hotspring's and easier activities which worked out really well. We are in our late 20's and are in good shape but the knees definitely started feeling it a bit midway through. 

**Packing List (for 2 Weeks)**

**Luggage -** 1 backpack, 1 carry-on duffel, 1 large checked bag

**Clothing**

* Tops: 5 t-shirts, 4 light long sleeves, 1 hoodie, 2 sweaters, 2 quarter zips
* Outerwear: 1 light down jacket, 1 waterproof anorak, 1 light rain jacket
* Bottoms: 2 joggers, 4 hiking pants, 1 pair of sweatpants, 2 swim trunks
* Underwear: 14–20 pairs (just in case ;) , 14 pairs of socks
* 2 beanies, 1 balaclava, gloves, 2 swim trunks
* Footwear:
   * Waterproof hiking shoes - Nike Pegasus 37 Shield - wore for majority of hikes
   * Waterproof boots - Salomon (used only 2 or 3 times during the trip)
   * Adidas Ultraboosts for comfort - plane, towns, light walks
   * Flip flops (barely used – lagoons/hotsprings were clean)
* Accessories: Compact towel, laundry bag, sunglasses

**Toiletries**

* Shampoo, conditioner, body wash/soap (most hotels provided Sóley or similar brands)
* MUST-HAVE: Lotion for face and body – pools/lagoons dry out your skin
* Toothpaste, floss, mouthwash
* Sunscreen, chapstick, OTC meds (hard to find on the road), first-aid kit 

**Electronics**

* **Chargers**: MINIX P100 GaN Wall Charger (Comes with EU adapter and is voltage converter) + Anker MagGo 3-in-1 charging station (really all I needed), + camera charging cord
* Car charger (although our rental provided one), Portable power bank
* **Camera**:
   * Sony FX30 + Sigma 24–70mm f/2.8 (Would have been nice to have 16-30mm F/2.8 for tighter spaces like caves, waterfalls, interiors but I packed light and this worked well for most photos/videos)
   * K&F ND Filter + 3 batteries

**Miscellaneous**

* Small trash bags, foldable grocery bag, water bottle
* Wet wipes, hand sanitizer, laundry sheets, dryer sheets, ziplocks
* **Binder clips** (for clipping blackout curtains closed and to clip chip bags)

**What I Didn’t Use**

* Shorts
* Rain pants - hiking pants were quick-dry and our hotel was 5min away from Seljalandsfoss where we got soaked
* Sleep mask - blackout curtains at every place we stayed
* Snacks - Bonus had plenty of new snacks to try
* Cooler bag, ice pack - we didn't really buy anything perishable

**What I WISH I Packed**

* A firmer pillow – hotel pillows were super flat. Would be nice to have for plane and driving too
* A flat sheet would have been amazing – I’m 6’3 and the small twin sized comforter provided everywhere didn’t cover me completely and was also way too warm. A queen or even full-size sheet would’ve been amazing to have.
* Most places we stayed had smart TV’s but I wish I brought a Firestick or similar dongle to be able to stream shows/movies on the nights we were winding down.

 We did laundry halfway through our trip. You may want to bring a few extra shirts, underwear, socks, or pants depending on your access to laundry.

 

**Driving the Ring Road**

* Emergencies Dial 112
* Keep headlights on at all times
* Speed Limit: 90 km/h on most of the Ring Road (slower in towns)
* Cruise control is super helpful for long stretches of driving
* Try and learn what road signs mean - especially No entry, One Way, No overtaking, no parking, no stopping, poor road surface, Slysasvæði, Blindhæð
* **Do NOT stop on the side of the road**. There was never a single moment where I found the need to do this. It’s dangerous, damages flora, and is just overall unnecessary. There are frequent pull-offs and places to turn around.
* No right turns on red and use a turn signal when exiting the roundabout
* Inner lane has the right of way in a roundabout
* For one lane bridges, make sure you slow down and yield. The first to the bridge has the right of way unless the road signs say otherwise
* Use Parka app for parking or there a pay stations that accept credit cards at every location – remember your license plate number for these stations
* Google Maps alerts for speed cameras (we saw \~5-6 total) 

**Car Rental Tips**

* Get full coverage (we used Lotus - excellent service, fast pickup/drop-off)
* Apple Pay works at most gas stations
* Gas = green nozzle, Diesel = black nozzle, yellow and blue is for buses
* Gas stations have language option on the touch screen (usually a globe icon)
* Can select ""fill up"" / ""fylla"" on gas pump but it'll charge USD $200–300 each time and it'll take several days for the charge to be removed

**Lagoons & Pools (We went to Blue, Forest, Sky Lagoon, Geosea)**

1)    Enter the appropriate changing room and remove shoes at the door. Usually a shoe rack is provided, don’t put them in locker if possible. Most places have a wristband locker system for locking locker and paying for things.

2)    Put all your clothes in the locker, keep your swimsuit and towel, and head to the showers.

3)    Every place we went (Blue, Forest, and Sky Lagoon, and Geosea) had a communal showering area w/ at least one private shower/changing areas. There are cubbies to put your towel by the shower which usually has the same number as your locker on it.

4)    Wash thoroughly with soap/shampoo provided - especially head/hair, armpits, groin and feet. Don’t forget to condition and it also never hurts to give your swimsuit a quick rinse

5)    Once clean, put on your swimsuit on, proceed to the pool area and enjoy!

6)    Once you are done, head back to the shower, dry yourself thoroughly with that towel you stashed earlier before proceeding to the locker room.

7)    Get dressed and don't forget your shoes on the way out!

I really cannot emphasize this enough but just keep your phone in the locker and just enjoy the experience without it. It’s hard to fully enjoy when you’re trying to keep your phone from getting wet and you’re wading through the water holding it up in the air. There are saunas and steam rooms and cold plunges to enjoy so leave the phone behind!

**Restaurants & Groceries**

* Most places seat you; very few are self-seating
* Water carafes are usually at the table or rarely there will be self-serve water dispensers. Tap water is very clean and most restaurants or cafes with fill your water bottle if you ask
* 99% of restaurants have you pay at the front after your meal, no tipping required
* Grocery stores like Bonus have self-checkout with English language options

Apple Pay was accepted literally everywhere we went – we never needed cash or even took our cards out once. Carry a little just in case, but it’s rarely necessary.

**Common Courtesy**

* Try to be cognizant of people taking photos – Don’t stand right next to someone when they’re clearly posing for a photo and try not to walk in front of someone’s camera if you can help it. Also, it’s always nice to offer to take photos for people.
* When walking on trails or sidewalks keep to the right and pass on the left. Please don’t walk 4 people across blocking everyone.
* Don’t talk in Saunas or steam rooms or any place where clearly everyone is trying to relax.
* When there are cars behind you trying to pass, signal with your right blinker indicating there is no car coming from the other direction and that it is safe for them to overtake you.

 

**Day 1: Arrival + Blue Lagoon + Reykjavík**

* Landed @ 11:30am (KEF) instead of 9:15am due to delay.
* **Car Rental**: Lotus w/ Platinum insurance — highly recommend due to gravel damage risk. Picked us up from airport and dropped us of from their location 5min away.
* **Blue Lagoon @ 12:30pm**: Ate a light lunch at the Café
* **Lunch: Víkinga Pylsur** near Hallskrimkirkja - Lamb and Bernaise was phenomenal and so was the classic hotdog as well (Better than Bæjarins Beztu Pylsur and no line). Other Lunch options: Mamas Reykjavik, Chickpea, Garðurinn, Dr Bao, Himalayan Spice, Sandholt, Café Loki, Fröken Reykjavík Kitchen & Bar, Skál!
* **Walked around Reykjavík**: Hallgrímskirkja, Harpa, Rainbow St., Sun Voyager, Höfði Lighthouse, Handknitting Association

* **Stay**: **Hotel Odinsve** (1 night)– Small, no breakfast but fine for 1 night and in a quieter area

**Day 2: Golden Circle**

* **Breakfast at** **Brauð & Co**. - Gets busy quickly. We went around 7:30am and there was no line. By the time we finished eating our pastries at the only 2 seats, the line was out the door. I recommend the Cinnamon buns and Hjónabandssæla (Happy Marriage Cake). Other great bakery options are DEIG Workshop for the best bagels and crème brulee donuts, Hygge Coffee & Micro Bakery, Sandholt
* **Þingvellir** \- Important to get here early and before the tour busses start piling up. Park in Lot 1 since it’s an easy point to do a loop around the park. We started at the main viewpoint, went down past Drekkingarhylur, to Öxarárfoss, then to Langistígur and made our way down to Þingvallakirkja, crossed the bridge to parking lot 5 and then up and over the hillside back to Lot 1. It took about 1-1.5 hours in total.
* **Lunch at Friðheimar**: No reservation but we walked in at 11:30am and were seated by 11:45. Unlimited tomato soup & bread. Skip the tomato drinks. Books up months in advance.
* **Brúarfoss** \- 10min walk from lot
* **Geysir** – unreal amount of people but was fun experiencing Strokkur erupting with everyone around it
* **Gullfoss** \- Upper and lower viewing deck with stairs leading down. You may get a little misting viewing from the lower area. 5 min walk from carpark
* **Kerið Crater** \- Walked around the rim but didn’t go down into crater. Took around 20min
* **Dinner**: Ingólfsskáli Viking Restaurant – atmosphere was cool and pretty good food. Other options would be Samúelsson Matbar, Mjólkurbúið Mathöll, Fröken Selfoss.
* **Stay**: **Skalakot Manor Hotel** (2 nights) – Absolute favorite hotel. Great breakfast, sauna, hot tub, friendly staff, stunning scenery.

* **Alternative Stays**: Umi Hotel, Boutique Hotel Anna, The Greenhouse Hotel, Tower klettar (silo converted into apartments)

**Day 3: Waterfalls + Horseback Ride**

* **Horseback Ride** at Skalakot – 1000% recommend this – we did a 3 hour glacier ride and went up into the mountains of Eyjafjöll behind the hotel to a viewpoint where we could see Eyjafjallajökull. There are shorter options for less experienced riders.
* **Lunch at Mia’s Country Van** – Fish and Chips 10/10 and right next to Skogafoss and Kvernufoss (Other options would be Freyacafe, or Skogafoss Bistro Bar but likely not nearly as good)
* **Skogafoss** – A lot of people and a long set of stairs. We continued walking to Hestavaðsfoss, Steinbogafoss, Skalabrekkufoss \~ 1 hour round trip.
* **Kvernufoss** – One of my personal favorites, a lot less people and the little canyon leading to the waterfall was beautiful. You can walk behind the waterfall as well.
* **Drangurinn í Drangshlíð + Rutshellir** – Both have parking areas. You can walk into Rutshellir cave. Really pretty with horses grazing outside.
* **Seljalandsfoss -** Definitely will get soaked but it is such a beautiful and powerful waterfall.
* **Gljúfrabúi** \- Will also get soaking wet - another one of my favorites and 5min walk from Seljalandsfoss
* **Dinner**: Skalakot Hotel – amazing lamb stew + langoustine.
* **Other Things to See**: Seljavallalaug Swimming Pool, Solheimasandur Plane Wreck, Sólheimajökull Glacier Hike.

**Day 4: Black Sand Beaches + Caves**

* **Loftsalahellir Cave** – short, steep climb, 100% worth it. Wear shoes with grip.
* **Dyrhólaey** – short walk around lighthouse with puffins spotted around
* **Reynisfjara** \- Plenty of parking, café, bathrooms. They have a sign w/ red, yellow, green indicating how bad the conditions are on the beach - make sure to respect the water and always keep an eye out for waves. DO NOT go past sign if the light is red.
* **Vík i Myrdal Church** – beautiful lupines around church
* **Lunch**: Black Crust Pizza – get there and line up inside as soon as they open if possible. Langoustine pizza was very good. **Other food options**: The Soup Company, Smiðjan Brugghús, Restaurant Suður-Vík, crepes. is (sweet or savory options).
* **Skool Beans** – 10/10 Japandian and Chai-Spresso were both excellent
* **Gígjagjá Cave** \- Yoda Cave overlooking a black sand beach. Drive up unpaved road.
* **Laufskálavarða** \- bathroom if needed – does cost money to use bathroom
* **Eldhraun** \- expansive area of land with lava rocks covered in moss
* **Fjaðrárgljúfur Canyon** – took us about an hour of walking and enjoying the canyon. Please respect the signs that say not to walk even if it looks like a footpath.
* **Vatnajökulsþjóðgarðs Visitor Centre** – nice and modern visitor center with clean bathrooms, place to refill water. Architecturally unique and you can go on top to get a view of Systrafoss
* **Kirkjugólf Tiles** – short walk over a couple small footbridges
* **Dverghamra** – short 20min loop around these columnar basalt rock formations
* **Foss á Síðu** – Again, respect the sign saying not to enter as the waterfalls are on private land. You can view from the parking area
* **Dinner at Klaustur Restaurant & Bar** – one of the best meals I had on the trip. We had the Cod in a delicious creamy caper sauce and a Chickpea curry over barley. Other dinner options would be Systrakaffi, Kjarr Restaurant & Bar.
* **Svartifoss Hike** 1.5 hour round trip hike that starts next to Skaftafel visitor center. If you are ambitious you can do a loop that takes you to the “Skaftafell Glacier high-altitude observation point” that overlooks the glacier.
* **Svínafellsjökull Glacier** – I highly recommend - 15-20min walk from parking area – we had the place to ourselves and were able to walk right up to the glacier.
* **Stay**: Fosshotel Glacier Lagoon (1 night) – good stopping point, hot tubs & sauna.
* **Alternative Stays:** Hótel Jökulsarlon Glacier Lagoon Hotel (kind of wish we stayed here instead), Vesturhus Hostel, Hali Country Hotel

 

**Day 5: Jökulsárlón + Eastfjords**

* **Diamond Beach** (Fellsfjara) → **Jökulsárlón Zodiac Glacier Boat Tour** 10/10 I highly recommend. The boat goes full speed and gets you the closest you can safely go to the wall of the glacier. They provided a waterproof coverall; the tour guides were great and in total it took about 1.5-2hrs. We did the tour with Arctic Adventures
* **Lunch at** **Heimahumar food truck** – amazing langoustine roll. Other lunch options include Fancy Sheep, and Fish and Chips. You can also get lunch in Hofn (Hafnarbuðin, Pakkhús Restaurant. There is also a craft store called **Handradinn** in town where you can get a variety of wool products. 
* **Vestrahorn + Stokksnes** (pay at café for access) – walked to Stokksnes lighthouse and back.
* **Hvalnes Lighthouse** – underrated scenic spot
* **Early Dinner** **at Matarvagninn á Djúpavogi** **Food Wagon** food truck – salmon roll was great, closes at 5pm. Other food options are limited in the area - Hafið bistro, Restaurant Framtíð are in Djupivogur or there’s Berunes Restaurant 30 min north.
* **Djupivogur lighthouse** – We parked at **Tankurinn** which is an old fish oil tank turned into an exhibition space for art and music. You can go inside and experience the fun echoing. The walk for the lighthouse was 40min round trip – some parts of the path were muddy so wear appropriate footwear. There’s also a little ladder so you can walk on top of it.
* **Eggin í Gleðivík** is right across the street and is an art installation featuring 34 granite eggs along the harbor, each representing a native bird species in the region.
* We did not take road 939 so we can enjoy the winding ring road along the Eastfjords.
* **Hafnarnesviti Lighthouse** – another small orange lighthouse, 10-minute walk to lighthouse.
* **Stay: Gistihúsið Lake Hotel** (2 nights) – nice hotel with good breakfast. Walls were a little thin and smelled like farm when the windows were open. They had a very nice spa with the largest indoor hot tub I’ve ever seen. I think it was 1,000 – 2,000 isk per person to use the spa.
* **Other Things to See**: Grófarlækjarfoss, Fjallsjökull, Múlagljúfur Canyon, Hoffell Hot Tubs, Folaldafoss, Nykurhylsfoss, Petra’s Stone and Mineral Collection, Streitisviti Lighthouse
* **Alternative Stays**: Our first choice was Hotel 1001 Nott but it was fully booked, Hótel Hallormsstaður, Hengifosslodge, Móðir Jörð Organic B&B in Vallanes

**Day 6: East Iceland + Seyðisfjörður**

* **Hengifoss/Litlanesfoss** hike (\~1.5hrs). Can walk close to waterfall but slippery.
* **Skriduklaustur Café** – 500 ISK for coffee + cookies. They also offer a lunch buffet that looked very good but wasn’t quite lunch time for us
* **Reindeer Park** – get to hand-feed reindeer
* **Lunch at Móðir Jörð** – farm-to-table vegetarian buffet that was incredible. The apple cake was great and the apples come from their orchard which according to the owner, is one of the only apple orchards in Iceland.
* **Drive to Seyðisfjörður**: Walk Rainbow St., Seyðisfjarðarkirkja, Blóðberg and Gullabuid
* **Dinner** **at Aldan** – reindeer was cooked perfectly + good pierogies
* After dinner we hiked up to the sound sculpture **Tvísöngur** \~45min round trip.
* Stopped at **“How are things?”** Sculpture and **Heavier Mountain** on the way back.
* **Other Things to See**: Seyðisfjörður, Háifoss, Gufu waterfall, Klifbrekku Waterfall, WWII US Navy LCM ship wreck, Fardagafoss, Vok Baths. Borgarfjarðarhöfn if you want to see Puffins, Lindarbakki - further drive.

**Day 7: Diamond Circle**

* **Stuðlagil Canyon + Stuðlafoss** – muddy but beautiful. \~1 hour round trip.
* **Lunch at Beitarhúsið** – Ok lamb soup that was fatty w/ thin broth, hot dogs, good Kleina. Another option would be Fjallakaffi just 7min further down the road which looks to have a wider variety of food and better atmosphere. Sænautasel is also nearby which is a turf house that serves pancakes, coffee, hot chocolate
* **Dettifoss** – We took the West side that’s paved (862) and continued north to **Hljóðaklettar** basalt formations + the Lava Church (small sign on the path says “Kirkjan”)
* **Ásbyrgi Eyjan Hike** – 1-1.5hr round trip. They have a nice visitors center but we parked further down at the campground and followed the trail for the Eyjan hike that goes west toward the cliffs then turns north. You’ll find a staircase that takes you up and then you follow the trail out to the tip for absolutely beautiful 360 views. If you have time or don’t want to do a strenuous hike, you can see Botnstjörn pond at the end of the canyon
* **Stay**: Bjarnabúð in Húsavík (2 nights) – awesome apartment with a ton of room, views of the harbor, walking distance to everything, washer dryer (did 4 loads of laundry
* **Dinner**: Hlodufell – skip the ramen, sushi was decent. Other options: Naustið, Pizzakofinn
* **Geosea Baths** – great vibe, view of Húsavíkurviti lighthouse, more locals, no phones
* **Other Things to See**: Mánárbakki museum, Whale Watching Husavik, Botnstjörn, The Arctic henge if you have the time (1hr from Ásbyrgi), Bustarfell Museum (1hr from Stuðlagil Canyon)
* **Alternative Stays**: Árból Guesthouse, Fosshotel Húsavík, Húsavík Green Hostel, Saltvík Farm Guesthouse. You could also stay in Akureyri which has many more hotel and food options and is a larger city similar to Reykjavik. We stayed in Husavik since it allowed us to do parts of the “Diamond Circle” without having to double back

 

**Day 8: Mývatn Area**

* **Breakfast at Lókal Bistro**
* **Viti Crater** – right next to parking lot, crater with deep blue waters
* **Hverir** – Geothermal Area – there is a viewpoint you can hike up as well. Smells like eggs
* **Grjótagjá Cave** – almost dangerously crowded and can be dark in the cave. Skip if tight on time.
* **Lunch at Vogafjós Farm Café** – smoked char, geysir bread, smoked lamb all amazing. Other lunch options would be Fish and Chips Lake Mývatn, Gamli Bærinn
* **Hverfjall Volcano -** 15 min walk up steep incline. There looked like there were paths to go into the center of the volcano if you so wish.
* **Dimmuborgir Lava field -** This was probably my least favorite thing the entire trip – there were around 10 tour buses and just walkways filled with people looking at a pretty uninteresting lava field. Definitely skip it if your crunched for time.
* **Skútustaðagígar -** we got ice cream from **Skútaís** across the street and took a leisurely stroll around these pseudocraters
* **Dinner at Naustið** in Húsavík – lamb + fish were phenomenal
* **Other Things to See**: Mývatn Nature Baths, Grenjaðarstaður, Lofthellir Ice Cave Tour

**Day 9: Waterfalls + Turf Houses + Churches**

* **Goðafoss** – parked in East parking but west is easily accessed via 1 lane bridge. 10min walk to waterfall.
* Turn right onto 84 for better views of fjords - adds only 15min to drive and is free. If you take the tunnel you will be charged $15 - You can pay ahead of time [tunnel.is](http://tunnel.is) but no worth it imo.
* **Forest Lagoon -** Really nice facilities, sauna, not too many people
* **Lunch in Akureyri at Turninn Kabob** in a little yellow building on Hafnarstræti was a nice change of pace and their pita and wraps were fantastic and came with well-seasoned fries. Other options for lunch would be Pylsuvagninn á Akureyri, Taste, Rub23, Ketilkaffi, Moe’s Food Truck
* **Glaumbær turf houses and Church** \- I highly recommend - very well preserved turf houses that you can walk through
* **Víðimýrarkirkja** – 1 min off ring road
* **Þingeyraklausturskirkja** – I highly recommend seeing this as well - stone church with 360 views – up a dirt road \~10min
* **Kolugljúfur Canyon –** 100% recommend stopping here. Short drive down rocky road and you park right next to canyon. Plenty of lookout spots to appreciate the canyon and we only saw 2 other people at this stop
* **Stay** **at Eyri Seaside Houses** in Hvammstangi – great views, very clean, kitchen
* **Dinner**: Sjávarborg – good soup, better vibes
* **Other Things to See**: Ystafell Transportation Museum, Laufás Museum and heritage site, Reykjafoss, Fosslaug, Akureyrarkirkja, Petting Zoo Daladýrð, Grenjaðarstaður, Beach Baths Hauganes, The Beer Spa, Verksmidjan Hjalteyri, Grafarkirkja, Saurbæjarkirkja, Hofsós Sundlaug, Grettir's Pool, Kálfshamarsvík Lighthouse, Hvitserkur, Breiðabolsstaðir, Skardsviti Lighthouse, Icelandic Seal Center, KIDKA Wool Factory Shop in Hvammstangi
* **Alternative Stays**: Mörk Homestay, Hótel Laugarbakki, Guesthouse Höfðabraut

**Day 10: Heading to Snæfellsnes**

* **Súgandisey Island Lighthouse** \- short staircase to get up to lighthouse
* **Stykkishólmskirkja Church**
* **Shark Museum** \+ **Bjarnarhöfn Church** – ticket includes Hákarl tasting w/ rye bread.
* **Kirkjufell + Kirkjufellsfoss** – we initially wanted to hike Kirkjufell but it was a little rainy and didn’t want to risk it. Can be a challenging hike even in good weather.
* **Stay at Akkeri Guesthouse (2 nights) -** quaint little guesthouse, fairly small rooms but still plenty of space. The owner was super nice and continental breakfast was inexpensive.
* **Dinner** at Narfeyrarstofa – þorskhnakki (Pan fried fillet of Cod) was phenomenal and so were the Mussels. Other options include Bjargarsteinn Mathús or Harbour Cafe in Grundarfjörður.
* **Other Things to See**: Grundarfoss (we admired from the road but looked like a short walk), Selvallafoss , Stykkishólmur Swimming Pool (we were too dried out from the hotsprings), There was also a crater that is unmarked and looked like there was a path – I didn’t get to hike it but it seems like it would take less than a half hour to get to the top – by Road 558 (64°57'28.5""N 22°54'01.1""W), Erpsstaðir Creamery near Eiríksstaðir
* **Alternative Stays**: Hótel Egilsen, Fosshótel Stykkishólmur, Hotel Stundarfridur, Berg Horse Farm. You can also stay in Grundarfjörður which is a nice little town - The Old Post Office Guesthouse, Grundarfjörður Bed and Breakfast, Kirkjufell Guesthouse, The Freezer Hostel

 

**Day 11: Snæfellsnes Loop**

* **Nesbrauð** – Kleina, cinnamon rolls, ástarpungar
* **Ytri Tunga** for seals → **Búðakirkja** → **Rauðfeldsgjá Gorge** (10/10 – try to get there early, we had the place to ourselves and it was magical)
* **Arnarstapi Walk**: Bárður Snæfellsás → Gatklettur → Stone Bridge → Pumpa  → Arnarstapi Lightouse → Arnarstapi Harbour
* **Lunch at FRISTA food truck** – Quesadillas and fish + chips are excellent. Line up 5min before they open because they got busy really quick. Other lunch options in the area: Samkomuhúsið Arnarstapa, Arnarbær, Stapinn
* **Hellnar** (You can walk down to the beach and see arch → **Londrangar** → **Malarrif Lighthouse** → **Djúpalónssandur** → **Saxhóll Crater** → **Skarðsvík Beach** → **Svörtuloft** **Lighthouse + Öndverđarnes lighthouse** (not much different than the other short orange lighthouses but there were a bunch of wooly sheep around here sunbathing and no other people. The road to both lighthouses is not paved and fairly bumpy to see both lighthouses - skip if you're crunched for time)
* **Dinner** **at Sjávarpakkhúsið** – Best place to get locally caught fresh fish. Has tasting menu as well
* **Other Things to See**: Vatnshellir Cave, Sönghellir Cave, Ölkelduvatn Mineral Spring, Lýsulaugar pool

  

**Day 12: Snæfellsnes to Reykjavík**

* **Gerðuberg Cliffs -** Rauðamelskirkja down the road as well
* **Lunch**: *Mama Reykjavik* – phenomenal vegan food + smoothies 10/10
* **Perlan Museum** (interactive + great views)
* **Stay at**  Parliament Hotel (2 nights) (nice but noisy area)
* **Dinner at Matur og Drykkur tasting** – not worth the $$ - I would recommend getting dinner elsewhere like Reykjavík Kitchen, Raðagerði Veitingahús, Fiskmarkaðurinn, Foodcellar, Grillmarkaðurinn, Dill Restaurant, Forréttabarinn, Skál!
* **Þúfa -** green mound with view of Harpa. Easy walk or scooter ride from dinner
* **Other Things to See**: Landbrotalaug hotspring, Eldborg Crater, Akranesviti + Akranes kighthouse, Grábrók Crater, Hraunfossar, Krauma, Into the Glacier, Glymur Waterfall, Hvammsvik Hot Springs, Husafell Canyon Baths, Höfrungur AK 91
* **Alternative Stays**: Edition Reykjavik, Exeter Hotel (I would stay here just for the bakery), Canopy by Hilton Reykjavik, Sand Hotel by Keahotels

 

**Day 13: Reykjavík + Sky Lagoon**

* **Breakfast at DEIG Workshop -** great bagels, creme brulee donuts
* **Icelandic Phallological Museum** \- Just do it
* **Kolaportið Flea Market** – Open Sat and Sun 11am-5pm. This is a great place to get crafts, jewelry, wool products, really any souvenir you can imagine.
* **Lunch at Icelandic Street Food** – Unlimited soup in a bread bowl, free waffles w/ rhubarb jam.
* **Dinner at Sol Restaurant** – 20 min out of town – The dining room is in a greenhouse and you sit above where they grow everything and can see down through the glass floor. Really cool concept but the food was very ok. There are probably better options in Reykjavik.
* **Sky Lagoon** – This was such an amazing experience and so different form the other hot springs. Experience the Skjól Ritual and splurge on the private changing rooms. This was a really nice way to end our trip.
* **Other Things to See**: Sundhöllin Pool, National Museum of Iceland, The Settlement Exhibition.

Some things I would do differently

* Obviously if we had more time we'd do the Westfjords - I think it's better we save it for a future trip since we were pretty sore by the end of this trip.
* I wish we stayed an extra day around Jökulsárlón so we could have more time to do the Svartifoss hike to the high-altitude observation point. This would have also maybe given us some time to do the Mulagljufur Canyon hike as well which I really regret not being able to fit in.
* It was nice having the midnight sun when we went for late night hikes and sight seeing, however, I would have maybe preferred to have some sunsets a little earlier to enjoy on night hikes.

1p4o1jz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p4o1jz,"Low Sodium Vegetarian Food, Public Hospital in Spain (6/10)","I (26M) spent ten days on a cardiology ward at a public hospital in Madrid last December. I’d been struggling for a long time with symptoms of hypertension, and had no idea what had been causing them until I ended up in A&E. A year later, I’m doing alright with lots of medication and regular checkups.

The meals were really hit or miss - some were excellent, and some I struggled to finish. The quality was quite inconsistent, but overall I’d give the food a 6/10.

I’m a vegetarian, and so, having informed the nurses, I was always given meat-free meals. Whilst some were really tasty, they often lacked protein, and given my high blood pressure, they were also supposed to be low in sodium, which they often weren’t (e.g. feta cheese)

Here are just a few of the meals (photos attached) …

1 - White bean and pepper salad, mushroom stew, a bread roll, and two satsumas. This was easily the best meal I ate on the ward. They’re two quite simple dishes, but were both really well seasoned and flavourful (10/10)

2 - Tortilla de patatas with roasted tomato, lentils, a bread roll, and two satsumas. Two very Spanish dishes. The tortilla was much drier and less ‘eggy’ than I’m used to, and the tomato was pretty flavourless, but a solid effort (7.5/10)

3 - Rice with green pesto, feta cheese, tomato, cucumber and onion salad with walnuts and raisins, and a bread roll. Some nice flavours in isolation, but a truly strange combination (5/10)

4 - Plain pasta with carrot and cucumber, steamed broccoli. I’ve never liked broccoli, and  as an adult can just about eat it if it’s pan fried with garlic and olive oil. I was served this meal more than once, but never finished it (4/10)

5 - Penne pasta with cheese and tomato, cream of leek soup, a bread roll and a pear. Nice concept, but poorly executed. The soup was foul, and the tomatoes were sour and cold inside. Still, I was glad to get a bit of cheese (5/10)

6 - Warm milk, instant coffee, Queso de Burgos, and an apple. Typical breakfast. This type of cheese has always been my favourite, but without salt it doesn’t hit the same. Sometimes they’d swap the cheese out for some grated tomato and a tiny bottle of olive oil. Even more Spanish! (7/10)

Not pictured - Warm milk, instant coffee, a bag of nuts, sometimes with a piece of fruit. This was the merienda (afternoon snack) that the nurses would bring everyday at 5pm on the dot.

Overall, I feel pretty fortunate to have received three healthy vegetarian meals a day, consistently served at the same time. I definitely noticed the lack of protein, but I enjoyed the variety of flavours, and was glad to be given a few familiar dishes that I’m used to eating at home.",45,1763908094.0,hospitalfood,8,0.96,False
