**The Pitching Matchup:**  
Dustin May (Dodgers) vs. Walker Buehler (Red Sox)? More like *Dustin May-HEM* and *Walker Buehler-BREAK*. May‚Äôs tasked with keeping L.A.‚Äôs anemic 11-16 stretch in check, while Buehler (3.27 ERA) hopes to avoid becoming Boston‚Äôs latest sacrificial lamb.

Shohei Ohtani (37 HRs, +240 to go over 0.5 HRs) is the game‚Äôs ultimate X-factor. He‚Äôs basically a nuclear reactor in a batting helmet‚Äîunstoppable, slightly dangerous, and guaranteed to make the odds sharpshooter.

# Decaf Coffee Basics

[Are you in search of the best decaf instant coffee?](https://gomehedi.com/best-decaf-instant-coffee/)¬†Understanding the basics of decaf coffee can help you make an informed choice. This guide will walk you through what decaf coffee is and how it compares to regular coffee.

# What Is Decaf?

Decaf, short for decaffeinated coffee, is coffee from which most of the caffeine has been removed. This process allows coffee lovers to enjoy their favorite beverage without the stimulating effects of caffeine. Here‚Äôs a brief overview of the decaffeination process:

* **Soaking:**¬†Green coffee beans are soaked in water to dissolve the caffeine.
* **Extraction:**¬†The water is treated with a solvent or activated charcoal to remove the caffeine.
* **Drying:**¬†The beans are dried to their original moisture content.

The goal is to retain the flavor and aroma of the coffee while removing at least 97% of the caffeine. The end product is perfect for those sensitive to caffeine or who enjoy a cup of coffee in the evening without disrupting their sleep.

# Decaf Vs. Regular Coffee

Comparing decaf and regular coffee involves looking at several key differences:

|Aspect|Decaf Coffee|Regular Coffee|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Caffeine Content|Less than 3% of regular coffee|Approximately 95 mg per cup|
|Flavor|Milder, sometimes slightly different|Full-bodied, robust|
|Health Impact|Less impact on sleep and anxiety|Can cause jitters and insomnia|

Decaf coffee is ideal for those who need to limit their caffeine intake. It‚Äôs also suitable for pregnant women, individuals with certain medical conditions, or those who prefer a milder taste. Regular coffee, on the other hand, is often chosen for its bold flavor and stimulating effects. Understanding these differences can help you decide which type of coffee suits your needs best.

# Instant Coffee Explained

[Looking for the best decaf instant coffee¬†](https://gomehedi.com/best-decaf-instant-coffee/)can be challenging, especially with the variety available. Understanding what instant coffee is and how it is made can help you make an informed choice. This guide explains instant coffee and its production process.

# What Is Instant Coffee?

Instant coffee is a type of coffee made from brewed coffee beans. It is processed into a powder or granules that dissolve quickly in water. This makes it a convenient option for coffee lovers who need a quick caffeine fix or prefer a decaf option.

Key features of instant coffee include:

* **Quick Preparation**: Simply add hot water to the granules or powder.
* **Long Shelf Life**: It can be stored for a longer period compared to regular ground coffee.
* **Convenience**: Ideal for travel, camping, or busy mornings.

Instant coffee comes in two main forms:

1. **Powdered Instant Coffee**: Finely ground coffee that dissolves quickly.
2. **Granulated Instant Coffee**: Coarser granules that are more stable and easier to handle.

Overall, instant coffee provides a quick and easy way to enjoy a cup of coffee without the need for brewing equipment.

# How Instant Coffee Is Made

The process of making instant coffee involves several steps to ensure that the final product retains its flavor and aroma. Here is a breakdown of the production process:

|Step|Description|
|:-|:-|
|1. Brewing|High-quality coffee beans are roasted and then brewed to create a strong coffee concentrate.|
|2. Extraction|The brewed coffee is then filtered to remove water and extract the coffee essence.|
|3. Concentration|The coffee essence is concentrated to increase its strength and flavor profile.|
|4. Drying|Two main drying methods are used: spray drying and freeze drying. Spray drying involves spraying the coffee concentrate into hot air, turning it into a fine powder. Freeze drying involves freezing the concentrate and then sublimating the ice into vapor, creating granules.|
|5. Packaging|The dried coffee is then packaged into jars, sachets, or tins, ready for consumer use.|

This meticulous process ensures that instant coffee retains its rich aroma and flavor, providing a quick and satisfying coffee experience.

1mad6f7,https://www.reddit.com/r/paypigs2/comments/1mad6f7/for_those_of_you_dommes_who_are_always_begging/,"For those of you ""dommes"" who are always begging for $20-$25 in these groups: Borrow it from Cashapp.","This might draw some criticism, but if you're truly in this for the money and not to play, there are far more strategic and consistent ways to achieve your goals. If you're actually desperate for a few days. Cashapp will give you the easiest $25 loan I've ever seen lol. 

If you need ACTUAL recourses to help you get financially through a week or two, let me know! I'm not sending money (don't dm with your aggressive domme persona), but I'm happy to help provide some resources to help! I know a lot about aid programs/small loans.

Lots of you have reached out to ask me ""how I did"" it. I don't really have an answer, they genuinely just find me everywhere I go lol. As someone who's been deeply involved in findom and fincucking for seven years, I can tell you that consistent, significant money-especially anything over $150 for a new domme - is hard to come by these days. It's disheartening to see so many new ""dommes"" on social media platforms resorting to begging for paltry sums like $10 or $25. It casts a shadow over the entire findom scene, making it seem desperate and cheap.

There are always ebbs and flows in this dynamic; some months are incredibly abundant with lavish tributes (rent, travel, concerts), while others bring smaller, more infrequent gifts (coffee sends, sends lower than $100, just physical presents).

Frankly, the oversaturation diminishes the genuine art of findom for those of us who truly cherish the intricate dance of power, control, and desire. True findom, at its heart, is about cunning, confidence, and cultivating genuine dynamics, not about begging for crumbs.

The Blind Eye Scenes

Delilah



 The needle rolled out of Sam‚Äôs reach as she struggled with her tourniquet, her frustration rose as she felt she was being deprived of her high. The spoon rested on her coffee table waiting for the lighters affection. She scrambled for the syringe as she felt her arm begin to numb, veins began to bulge out of her arm‚Äôs. The syringe now within reach she momentarily set it down to put a flame to the spoon. The heat did it‚Äôs job instantaneously, the heroine pooled in the center of the spoon. Sam quickly put the swab in to absorb the toxic liquid then put in the syringe and pulled it all in at once. She clumsily smacked her inner elbow, all the veins jutting out of her arms like speed bumps in a road.

Sam haste-fully drove the needle into her skin careless if she hit a vein correctly, she wanted her high. That was all she cared about or needed. The drug quickly entered her bloodstream, sending Sam into a relaxed euphoric state in seconds. She felt on top of the world as she Sat drooling onto her chest. Nothing could bother her. Nothing. Not the rent that was 2 months late, not losing her job 5 months ago, not even the guy she had just sucked off to score this rush. This was her feeling of immortality.

The doorknob to Sam‚Äôs room began to jiggle till it swung open completely, Sam‚Äôs daughter Delilah stared at the woman with the ugly look sitting in front of her. ‚ÄúMom?‚Äù Delilah said softly knowing there wouldn‚Äôt be a response. ‚ÄúI hate you‚Äù, she began to whisper repetitively as she shut her moms door, ‚Äúyou‚Äôll never change‚Äù.

Sam was far beyond consciousness and was never aware her daughter was there. To Sam this couldn‚Äôt last long enough, she would wake up and do it all over again. In secret Delilah Sat crying in her room hoping her mom would never wake up.",1,1753590008.0,WritersGroup,0,1.0,False

So, if you‚Äôre tired of the grind and want to **start working smarter, not harder**, keep reading. Here‚Äôs a sneak peek inside the vault:

- **AI Magic**: I‚Äôm not kidding when I say AI can help you 10x your productivity. Ever wish you had a sidekick who could churn out content ideas, catchy headlines, or even drafts while you grab your third cup of coffee? ü•¥ With tools that analyze trending topics, you can create content that resonates with your audience before they even realize they want it!

- **Growth Hacks Galore**: You don‚Äôt need to wait for some magical moment to gain followers. I‚Äôve compiled tactics that can boost your presence overnight.

- **Real-Life Examples**: We all love story time, right? Picture this: a small food blogger who went from 100 followers to 10,000 by simply tweaking the way they showcased their recipes with AI-generated visuals. **It‚Äôs not luck; it‚Äôs strategy!** 

Look, I get it. The internet is packed full of noise, and it‚Äôs super easy to feel like your voice gets drowned out. But it shouldn‚Äôt be that way. **Instead, it should feel like you have the ultimate inside scoop**.

**Why This Pick?**

The Blue Jays offense is just too good, betting fam. Toronto is on a ridiculous heater, and I highly doubt Detroit starter Jack Flaherty (4.77 ERA)¬† is where they decide to put the brakes on. 4 of Flaherty‚Äôs last 5 starts have resulted in losses for the Tigers, and 4 of Blue Jays pitcher Max Scherzer‚Äôs (5.14 ERA) last 5 outings have seen at least 9 runs. I know Detroit‚Äôs offense has been rough, but Scherzer has allowed 4 HRs over his last 2 starts ‚Äì I think they get enough on the board here to push this total Over 8.5. To be frank, I won‚Äôt be surprised if Toronto bags 7 of the runs by themselves. My money‚Äôs on the Over to cash.

I got given I guest pass for this limited space private wellness club. It's nice, but gosh it's expensive. ~$8,800 for the year of their mid-tier level.

To give an idea of a scope of what they have, apart from a a fully equipped gym with all brand new equipment (no gripes there), they have:

- A sauna
- Three small indoor pools (6c, 10c and 35c)
- A outdoor pool that is also shared by the building occupants
- reformer pilaties room with about 30 machines
- Stretch and mobility space (warm-up cool down, small area)
- A body build mini gym space for high intense workouts and classes
- 2 hypobaric pods
- 2 cryotherapy pods
- 2 IR saunas
- 2 lymphatic compressions
- 2 PEMF mat beds
- A bookable nutritionist & coaches
- A bookable RN who comes on site three days a week for IV drips of vitamins and supplements should you want it
- The lobby cafe and bar, with coffee and takeaway lunches to buy
- A bookable conference room /phone booth rooms
- bookable classes for workouts, pilaties, yoga, sound meditation, intensive high-energy.
- Plus lots of little things around the venue, still/sparkling and tea stations, hot/cold face towels, full bathrooms with steam irons and such for the business types etc

The only thing I have spotted they are legit missing is some more boxing-style equipment and classes. They have some, but not like other gyms I've seen, but that can vary place to place. They have said as they work through request and demands they will change things but yeah.

Also it's only open 5am-9pm at this stage during week days and 6:30am - 6pm on weekends, which they may increase as they get more people in. So not even 24hrs - I think at least the gym part should be open for that, even if they close up the rest and the bookable room areas. 

If you've read this far the place is [Saint Black](https://www.instagram.com/Saintprivateclub) if you want to see photos/read up about it.

I get that someone truly focused on fitness and health would benefit more than the average gym goer, especially if you're booking multiple places like a separate gym, yoga/pilaties venue etc etc. to combine it all-in-one.

There is a higher tier than makes more sense $ wise to me, is about an extra $100 a week more, but you get unlimited bookings on the stuff like baric chambers and IR saunas instead of only 2x a week (and then additional $ after that) and either a private PT session or $100 Cafe voucher.  The PT/voucher alone offsets the cost there for that part. 

TL;DR: what is your thoughts on these private wellness clubs, and what price do you think is reasonable for something fitness related",0,1753588972.0,AusHENRY,11,0.33,False
1mactp3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tonsillectomy/comments/1mactp3/end_of_day_5_and_i_feel_surprisingly_ok/,End of Day 5 and I feel surprisingly ok,"Hello!  
I'm a 21M, had my tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy on the morning of Tuesday 22/07 and it is now Sunday afternoon (27/07) and I don't want to speak too soon but this recovery period has overall been a very positive experience for me so far. 

As soon as I woke up from the surgery I started chomping down a bucket of ice and drinking copious amounts of water. It was painful but I was pretty determined to start the swallowing process early so that I would get used to the sensation of painful swallowing (headspace was this is inevitable just accept the pain). I ended up having an omelette with salad for lunch and roast chicken with mash and beans for dinner (painful? a bit but I was hungry so I ate ). 

I came home the following day prescribed with 25 Oxycodone pills to take when experiencing extreme pain, Tranexamic acid to prevent bleeding for the first 3 days and then just Ibuprofen as my main pain reliever. After being in hospital all morning (had an omelette, muesli and fruit for breakfast), I came home at about 10am absolutely starving and had some leftover pasta and two ham and cheese toasties. I swigged coffee down between bites of toastie so the pain wasn't as harsh but it wasn't unbearable. That afternoon I kept on snacking on chocolate, icecream, celery sticks and HEAPS OF WATER. I'll keep it short and brief but pretty much all week I've been eating more food (porridge for breakfast, soup with bread for lunch, and whatever is cooked for the family for dinner) than I normally would and drinking plenty of water. I had two big burritos for dinner last night on night 4 while reading through endless horrific stories on this subreddit and I feel very relieved I haven't experienced the 'swallowing a lightsaber' pain. 

I go to bed at around 10pm and wake up with a really really sore throat at like 4am. The first few swallows are so so painful but I just as they say, rip the bandaid off, by skulling a whole bottle of water to rehydrate my throat. The pain in that time is very intense but if I avoid the pain by not swallowing the water I know the pain will remain at this intensity. I only have two oxy's a day in the morning, I don't feel they really help with the pain, in all honesty it's just nice laying out in the sun, reading a book and feeling the buzz it gives you (this has been my daily routine and it's been really enjoyable, something about reading a romance while on oxy's makes me really want to fall in love lol). 

So yeah that's been my daily routine, and all in all I've had a very good experience, I actually look forward to waking up spending the day laying in the sun at my local park reading. I always have a water bottle beside me and constantly swallow. I'd say I swallow about 1000 times a day. Every single time it's painful, i want to make that clear, it is painful, but I'd much rather accept the inevitability of the pain and make sure I drink water and eat food, then to avoid the pain in total which I know will make the pain way more unbearable when I do have to swallow. I'm not scared of hemorrhaging because statistically it only happens 1% of the time, and a nurse at the hospital told me he's only seen it once in four years and it because the person refused to eat or drink.   
  
I'll provide you guys an update in a few days with how I go with all the scabs are falling off (apparently more painful?) but until then I'll be soaking in the rays, slowing down (seems impossible these days) and reigniting my love for reading. I just want to reemphasise my main advice for people who are about to undergo this surgery - eat regularly (soft foods if the pain is really bad but if you can try eat whole meals like pasta etc) and drink heaps of water. Eating and drinking has been painful for me but I refuse to avoid the pain of swallowing because I know my pain will get a whole lot worse if I do avoid swallowing. 

Best of luck to everyone on their recovery journeys, in the midst of all these horrific stories I hope mine can give people who are anxious about this surgery some relief.

My girlfriend came home to my on therapy through telehealth. She heard me talking about her and chose to listen for about 30 minutes before i realized she was home. she stormed out and was extremely angry at me. I had been talking about our relationship, and had in heat of emotions, jump to hurtful conclusions about how people around me feel about her, which is worry I misconstrued in my speaking as dislike. I had also been talking about iur relationships, some stresses, getting everything out and just talking through it. She says she feels betrayed and like she was stabbed in the back over this. I feel awful, and I haven't been able to interpret my feelings on this appropriately either, and I have been responding with anger. How do I proceed? What do I do? Sorry for the small details. it's for privacy sake.

**IPutThisUsernameHere**

>First, discuss this with your therapist. Get their opinion on the situation, since it sounds like you're using them as a touchstone for your relationship and this is impacting it.

>Second, ask your girlfriend to talk to you. See if she'd be willing to discuss what you said, perhaps provide some context for what you were expressing or feeling.

>Beyond that, there's not much any stranger on the Internet can tell you.

**OOP**

>>I have given context, I've tried to explain to her that my friends and family dont dislike her, and that was harsh wording on my part. We've argued a lot in the past few months and there worried about me. But she isn't listening to the context or me telling her that, and that isn't how it is. She says there is no way to misconstrue that and I've betrayed her.

**huey2k2**

>You didn't do anything wrong, she was the one who violated your privacy by listening in on your session, as far as I am concerned it's not on you to do anything; she should be apologizing to you.

**camelCaseCoffeeTable**

>>100%. You didn‚Äôt betray her at all, she betrayed your trust. It‚Äôs therapy, you‚Äôre supposed to be able to talk freely and privately. She majorly violated your trust and is now manipulating you. 

>>Honestly, this is almost breakup worthy. Trust is a major part of a relationship, and idk if I could trust someone again if they snuck around and listened in on what they know is a private conversation. With my therapist no less. And then for some reason got angry at me?

>>OP should be the one who‚Äôs pissed. Fuck apologizing to her or anything else. Tell her you want an apology and a plan for how to build the trust back or you want the relationship to be over.

**OOP**

>>>She says she can't trust me anymore because of what I said, even after I explained to her everything.

EDIT: I do want to add other than what has been stated here, I did not say anything directly mean about her. I've only talked about issues we've had and how those around me might view her. She only heard me talking, and not my therapist. She is upset I would share any information about our relationship or what she's been struggling with with anyone, including my therapist

EDIT 2: I thank you all for all your support, and although im not replying to every comment I am reading them, and taking everything into account. I am also at work and work EMS so im sorry if I dont get to your comment

EDIT 3: I thank you all for your replies. Im sorry I haven't been able to to respond to everyone, you've all been a big help, and im going to reflect on everything everyone has said for sure when looking at this relationship. Thank you all

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/s/BieXd0K4Cf)  **July 20, 2025**

Hello! I recently posted here about my girlfriend eavesdropping on my therapy conversation, and the huge fallout that came of it. Its been a couple weeks and a lot has happened. I took everything everyone had said from my previous post, and read it multiple times to really get my head where I need to be. I realized that she shouldn't have listened, and that was on her. We had an argument not long after I had made the post, she blamed me for everything, said many hurtful things. I was leaning towards breaking up whem her whole script flipped. She acted like she was in the wrong about everything, made me feel like she was going to change for the better. She wasn't.

I took a step back from pur relationship for two days. I wanted to really reflect and think, she didn't honor that wish, and she didn't have any plans to. But after reading all the comments and reflecting, I realized I was in a toxic relationship, where I was cutting off my friends and family for this person that I would never be enough for.

I ended up breaking uo with her. It hurt a lot but I thank you all so much for helping me see to what needed to be done. I couldnt have done it if it weren't for all of your advice. I wanted to give this little update to let everyone know how thankful I am, and to answer any questions I didn't from my previous post.

>My older sister listened in on an in person therapy session I was having.  She was my ride home and I guess was able to hear from the waiting room, or maybe was listening at the door.  I wasn‚Äôt aware she had listened until about a year later when she used what she had heard to nuke me over an argument about where to go for vacation that year.    It was a strange, almost out of body experience, realizing I could never trust her again and never should have trusted her in the first place.  

>I‚Äôm sorry you experienced this.  I‚Äôm glad it gave you what you needed to make a change; otherwise, it‚Äôs just hurt.

**OOP**

>>She would take things I had said before, and use it against me, and after everything I knew I couldnt trust her with any information id ever told her, especially since it had happened in the past and she wasn't opposed to sacrificing morales.

**How did the ex handle the breakup**

>Not well, I had asked originally for two days just to reflect on everything. She ended up showing up to my house and threatened suicide :( and that's was a lot on me, and made me really scared. I ended up having to cut ties with her, I sent a message and blocked her, because everytime I had tried to talk to her she would make me feel bad, say she was going to therapy and wanting to change and be with me. But that wasn't what was happening, so I had to bite the bullet.

I (30F) am getting into road biking and would love to meet a community of people in the Irvine-ish area (or who are willing to ride in the Irvine-ish area) who do it semi-regularly. If you‚Äôre trying to win the yellow jersey and have a few weeks to help make sure that the first bus that passes me by doesn‚Äôt immediately end my life I‚Äôd be greatly appreciative! 

Very much so at square one outside of: I know how to ride a bike (and a unicycle), I put thousands of miles on a trek bike in my late teens, and I really REALLY want to do this. I‚Äôm pretty overwhelmed by the number of bikes/guides/shops/brands/pricepoints/sizes/etc and would love to hang out with folks who can help me look at used bikes and determine if they‚Äôre in good enough shape to purchase, guide me through the process of finding shoes and peripheral gear, and then learning how to be safe on the roads, changing tubes, clipping in, etc. I rode a Cervelo for a short amount of time a few years back and it was lovely, but not locked into anything. 

Pros: you get to ride a bike with someone you taught to ride like you. You can put me on your resume as ‚Äúprofessional mentorship and development‚Äù, I‚Äôll reference for you. Like Tadej I also like coffee and food and am willing to treat/bribe for time teaching. I‚Äôm not horribly out of shape so it should only take me a couple of weeks to be a good full time riding partner if you‚Äôre looking for one. I‚Äôm very consistent so if you are missing a long-term riding buddy in your life who will be able to go 5-6 times a week I will quickly become your gal. I always carry sunscreen so you wont die of skin cancer in your 40‚Äôs. 

Cons: I am a little shy, I‚Äôm rubbish at interfacing with venders, I will ask you a lot of questions, I know little to nothing about bikes, and I‚Äôm going to be pretty heavily reliant on you to help me get up to speed (until I have a bike in my hot little hands.)

1macqut,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1macqut/my_first_writing_retreat/,My first writing retreat,"Today was a good day. :)

Like many of you, I'm sure, I have a family and a full time job. I've had a book sitting on my hard drive unfinished for five years. After years and years of being burnt out working for someone else and spending all of my vacation time pleasing family by visiting them, I finally took time for myself. At first it was anxiety provoking, to the point of being in a state of panic (with frequent panic attacks) the week leading up to this trip. 

I built in buffer time for tourism on the front end and made sure that I at least tried to write something every day. It wasn't much, but i did write again. I was worried that I just didn't have it in me, that I wasn't really a writer, that I was one of those people who wanted to have written a book, not one of those who wanted to write a book. 

The six days of writing at the retreat started and it was rough, but I stuck with it. I played video games, i went for walks, I got lost in my phone, and that led to a particularly miserable Wednesday where I was rewarded with my lowest word count. I decided to end my day with journaling, exploring why I was here what I wanted to accomplish and what I actually wanted to write in the last chapters that had stumped me for half a decade. 

I found answers when I have myself permission to write anything in any way it would come. I summarized action. I told instead of showing. I broke most of the rules, but when I was done I had a scaffold of options to build from. 

I woke up the next day focused. I powered through and at the end of the day, exhausted I had written 12k words and the end was in sight. Finishing was possible, seemed inevitable.

And then, I had a rough night where a fly got into my room and kept dive bombing my head, waking me up. Worst night of sleep that I can remember since my children were first born and waking up every half hour to forty five minutes. I woke up as a shell of a human being. I drank coffee and stared at my computer screen, bad techno music playing on my headphones. Nothing, the words would not come. So I back tracked and noodled. And I found things to write that were not the ending, but probably needed to be written. But that's last chapter and it's blank page stared at me mocked me.

I gave up and tried to do back to bed. The fly attacked me after fifteen minutes. I found the swatter and ended it's miserable life. I gave up on sleep. I played bad video games and read the internet. I tried to write again at lunch. Nothing, more bad video games. 

Then I thought, one more cup of coffee. Maybe you won't finish, hell there's almost no chance you will, but it's why you're here. Just make the coffee and state at the screen. That would be more of an attempt than hiding in my room all day. 

So I did it. I wrote three very bad paragraphs and hated them. Why? Because I realized the stakes had but raised properly for the end of the book. I wrote a 600 word interlude and suddenly it clicked. The words started to flow, things started happening, events and people clicked into place. I found symmetry between where my characters started and where they were ending. 

And i finished it. It is likely that the last page will need to be entirely re written. But it has my two favorite words on it: The End.

Tomorrow I begin the journey home. I am not nervous. I did what I cameb here to do. I'm not done, not by a long shot, but I have written a book and it was extremely rewarding to finish it. 

Words at the beginning of the week: 76,000
Final word count: 121,834
New writer friends: 7.

Thanks for reading. If you're struggling, from me to you: Good luck. You may have more in the tank than you think.

I‚Äôm sorry; maybe it‚Äôs gonna be a long post but it could help someone and that‚Äôs the point 

Well first I‚Äôm gonna talk a little bit about myself and repass my previous breakups 

Well I‚Äôm close to be 25; I‚Äôm from latam, not from a conservative family but also not a progressive one 

Well I guess I‚Äôm an attractive guy, (attractive as I could see another Latin boy I guess); I still manage with my self esteem sometimes 

¬øHow I know I‚Äôm attractive?

Well I know there were people of both genders interested in me (probably this means nothing)

But I still struggle with myself ¬øwhy? 

Cause I used to live with my brother and cousins, 1 boy, 1 girl

And the three of them used to get all the attention; I can discard her cause she‚Äôs a girl, but well my brother and my cousin used to get all girls attention ¬øwhy do I care about that? 

Cause when everyone talks about your brother or seems to be interested in him u realize who‚Äôs the attractive one 

Well the three of them are more ‚Äúwhite‚Äù than me; I‚Äôm more like ‚Äúmilk with coffee‚Äù and at this side of the world if ure more either you‚Äôre more attractive 

They always joke about me being adopted 

And when people see us together they always said this stupid bullshit about we don‚Äôt look like brothers 

Either I wear glasses and I‚Äôm not tall at all 
I‚Äôm 1,64cm 

So ‚ÄúI was nerfed‚Äù

Let‚Äôs talk now about my previous relationships 

A guy) My best friend for 7 years; he make me realized that I was not straight at all; we‚Äôve been for 3 months and broke up cause he was scared cause my brother found about us 

It took me 2 years to overcome that relationship (yup; that hurt a lot) in my defense it was my first love 

B guy) a sweet guy I met at university; we‚Äôve been together for 4 months; until I realized he was on Grindr and he was making money hooking up with other guys 

C guy) been having dates for 4 months; we had sex, go to eat pizza, the cinema; but well once I kissed him in a restaurant; when he went to his home he told me that I confused things and that he didn‚Äôt want to have a relationship; dude, yeah of I was interested in him, but I just kissed him, and it wasn‚Äôt like I didn‚Äôt kissed him before, but it was the first time I kissed him in a public space 

D guy) met this guy on internet; at that time I was living alone in another country he‚Äôs younger than me at that time I was 20 and he just became 18; well that was Chernobyl, first we were friends, but yeah he manipulated me in a way √≠ couldn‚Äôt did anything, I use to wait for him to call me at 10pm when he told me that, he just didn‚Äôt care and still talking with his friends, I used to wait him till 5am and I used to went bed crying I just couldn‚Äôt understand what was happening at that time 

He use to tell me that he loves me like; that I was everything for him, and then he used to disappear or tell me that he didn‚Äôt want to be with me anymore and then come back a couple days later or months later telling me that he loved me 

This is something embarrassing to admit; maybe u could think that I‚Äôm stupid; and I still think of that as a possibility (I didn‚Äôt even saw his face once) he ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt feel comfortable with that‚Äù so basically I fell in love with messages 

Yup that could talk a lot about myself, and maybe the community in general, but let me continue 

2 years had passed; and now we‚Äôre with: 

E guy) the perfect one, he didn‚Äôt threat me bad, he talk about things, he had the tastes that I wanted from a partner and i couldn‚Äôt believe it could be even possible, and he always supported me with every idea not matter how mad it could be 

An example: 
I told him I read a book and now I wanted 3 statues of gods on a specific place 

His answer? I always thought about how great statues could be in gardens 

Damn I just can‚Äôt believe it 

Well; when we started dating; at the 2nd month I told him I wanted him to be my boyfriend, he told me that he preferred to take more time to know each other and eventually we could talk about this and he could give me an answer 

Everything seemed to be perfect, he even went with me to meet my cousins 

We use to talk every night and he used to stream my favorite video games and then he used to play those video games songs on piano for me 

But months passed by and then I realized that have an answer was something important for me, call me old fashioned but labels make me feel secure 

So one day I talked with him about it; our last talk about that topic was 10 months ago, yeah; almost a year 

He told me that he was afraid about this conversation but he reach an answer months ago, but he didn‚Äôt want to brought it cause he thought I didn‚Äôt want to talk with him after that 

Yeah surprise, he didn‚Äôt want a relationship; he told me he that even if it sounds selfish he wanted to continue talking with me 

I told him that in fact that was really selfish and I didn‚Äôt want to continue talking with him; since then I don‚Äôt know nothing about him; 2 months had passed since then, almost 3 

Now I‚Äôm single and I‚Äôm not thinking to be in a relationship, at least for now 

I‚Äôm really into my studies, I‚Äôm in my second career 

I‚Äôm gonna talk about myself again just a little bit 

I didn‚Äôt used to think that I‚Äôm attractive, a couple times when I was in other countries for vacations like USA I was like 

I‚Äôm not even in a standard level over here 
Damn it, everyone here seems to be a model 

That was not something good to my self stem esteem 

 But well; before ‚Äúmeeting‚Äù D guy I managed to have a lot of hook ups on Argentina; even a couple of threesomes, and I accomplished my dream about getting involved with one red hair guy 

At that time I realized; well if I could get hook ups here where everyone‚Äôs seems to be a model, maybe I‚Äôm attractive enough 

Now I‚Äôm working on myself 

I found that I love femboy stuff; so now I‚Äôm appreciating my height, but I‚Äôm still working with my weight 

I use contact lenses; that way I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm a nerd 

Im still managing to get some more money to buy a switch 2 and remove all my body hair cause I hate it 

Im afraid to grown up; I didn‚Äôt feel that I had that teenage relationship 

In fact now I look younger; and when I enter to a hookup app sometimes its impossible to get one cause there are not too many profiles over here (normally 3 or less; yeah I fuck live in the middle of nowhere) but if I manage to see someone foreign whom I‚Äôm attracted to they think I‚Äôm lying about my age and they think I‚Äôm not even legal; it could be fun cause yeah; I want to look younger, but it‚Äôs a mess 

I can‚Äôt bring someone to my home 

Yesterday I saw D guy in a group talking about how delicious is to have sex without protection 

I was like wtf 

I had a little heartbreak when I saw that; I enter to his profile and i eliminated it and block him 

I also deleted some fake friends and toxic family members 

Sorry I‚Äôm getting out of what I wanted to say 

A couple years ago it would be impossible for me to consider something like eliminating D Guy or even not talking again with E guy, or maybe don‚Äôt accept disrespect treatments of ‚Äúfriends‚Äù or family 

As gays we usually don‚Äôt have a figure; something to relate to

No one‚Äôs in our familiy knows or support us; we suffer in silence and heals our broken hearts 

Because of this; we accept things that no one should accept 

Love doesn‚Äôt mean to hurt u 

Love should feel make u secure 

We use to be like scared kittens whom want to protect ourselves and in that path we hurt other people 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs better to feel safe‚Äù

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm not trying to say that love is not real or something like that 

When I‚Äôm happy and feel corresponded I‚Äôm gonna say love is real 

But when someone breaks my heart I will say i don‚Äôt believe in love 

Love is real but it needs time, space, care, empathy 

Don‚Äôt feel disappointed, I still don‚Äôt find it, and in some point I know I‚Äôm not gonna find someone here and eventually I‚Äôll have to move on 

But I want u to have more empathy with yourself and hug yourself 

Take care of u 

Look what u have achieved, get the body u want, eat that dessert and don‚Äôt let anyone to treat u in a way u know u don‚Äôt deserve 

U have the right to love and to being loved 

And read this 

Read this well 

Your mental health it‚Äôs not something negotiable, for anything or anyone, nothing is more value than ur mental health and your happiness 

And I u read this and find that ure not being good for your partner, be honest with yourself, don‚Äôt do that, it‚Äôs not fair, get over it 

And I know; cheaters are everywhere; sometimes on this sub we have a lot of stories about couples with 10 years being together or more and found their partner cheating 

Be empathic; help them 

But I also want to encourage u 

Do u know a real gay love story? 

Share it 

As a community I feel like we need to believe in love again 

We deserve it 

As any other human; we‚Äôre searching for love 

But we need to learn how to love us first 

That‚Äôs it 

Hope this will help u 

I also wrote an essay about hookups and things like that if you‚Äôre interested 

But it‚Äôs even longer and it‚Äôs in Spanish so u get it 

But if someone it‚Äôs interested I could share it 

This is written with my heart; the essay is written with study 

Thanks for reading; it means a lot for me ‚ô° ",3,1753588693.0,askgaybros,2,1.0,False

1macqaj,https://www.reddit.com/r/helpme/comments/1macqaj/should_i_go_no_contact_with_my_grandparents/,Should I go no contact with my Grandparents (mainly my grandpa),"hello Reddit! I‚Äôm coming on here to sort of rant, but also ask a question and advice from people who aren‚Äôt so close to the situation.

One thing you should know about me is that I‚Äôm adopted. My parents could not have children and there was never really a reason why. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with either of them they could just never have children. This was the first breaking point in my parents marriage.

Another thing you know is my dad comes from a family of narcissist. He‚Äôs a narcissist. My grandpa is a narcissist and his dad was a narcissist. If you can‚Äôt tell, it‚Äôs just a lot of narcissism in this household. 

The story starts a couple of years ago when my grandpa decided to blow up and yell at my mom. I was no older than five or six. But I vividly remember standing in the garage, listening to my mother my grandfather just bloody scream at each other over something I view as quite Manute.

This was the official official breaking point in my parents marriage. Instead of standing up for my mom and being a good husband, my dad took his parents side and from then on, has continued to take his parents side with every single argument since then.

My dad no longer stand up to my mom. He ignores her and yells and blames her for everything. He also does the same for me. I remember one time being home alone with him when he screamed in my face over me not going on a ‚Äú daddy daughter date‚Äù with him. Over the years, my father has gotten increasingly more creepy with me.

Another thing you should know about my grandpa is that he comes from a line of men who all believe they are the alpha males. Each Christmas, every blood-borne male goes into a room and discusses the ‚Äúfamily business‚Äù. We own nothing. We have no big property. They quite literally are just men in a room gossiping about the family and its affairs.

I consider my mom to be one of my best friends. Also, being her daughter just makes it easier for us to have a closer relationship than I do with my father and with my grandpa. This infuriates, my dad and my grandpa that I like my mom more. It also infuriates them that I like my mom‚Äòs parents more because‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶they aren‚Äôt manipulative.

I have suffered year after year after year of hearing my Mom talk about how poorly my dad and my grandparents treat her as well as my whole dad side of the family. The only good people on my dads side of the family are my aunt and my uncle. my uncle has stood up to his parents numerous times fighting for his wife and for his children‚Ä¶unlike my father.

today I reached a breaking point with my grandpa. My parents were celebrating their 25th anniversary with a party. My mom‚Äòs best friend, me, and each of my grandma‚Äôs house for this party. We were all involved in different ways some more than others. The main point person was my mom‚Äôs best friend. We will call her S. S used to be a party planner so she knows how to run parties

The building we‚Äôre hosting the party and had no reception. I mean if you tried to call us it would immediately go to SOS or the emergency call or whatever. You could not reach anyone when they were inside of that building.

We left around nine that morning to go set up for the party. The people setting up were me, my mom, my mom‚Äòs mom, S, and S daughter.

set up didn‚Äôt take long, only about 45 minutes maybe. I didn‚Äôt do really much of the set up. I actually went and I got coffee as a thank you for everyone. I got back and we were sitting around kind of just talking for a little bit before we went home to change and get ready for the party later when my grandparents (Dad side obviously) sort of just came in without an invitation. My grandpa immediately went to the bathroom while my grandma looked in the fridge and then walked out. She was looking in the fridge because she was in charge of food for that day.

Once my grandpa came out of the bathroom, he immediately went up to S and my mom and started complaining and bickering and yelling about how they ‚Äú were weren‚Äôt involved enough‚Äù in this party planning and how the party wasn‚Äôt even about my dad. (which is so false by the way.) he was upset that they weren‚Äôt involved in the setting up of the party and that my dad wasn‚Äôt there. There was a lot of stuff that he said that I really don‚Äôt feel like putting on here for everyone to read but basically let‚Äôs say I had a panic attack and started sobbing uncontrollably for about two to three hours.

in between blubbers and tears and cries, I said I never wanted to see my grandpa again. I said that I never wanna talk to him. I never wanna see him. I want no contact. What he just did had severed any ties of a relationship. He yelled at my mom and at S. Two of the most important people in my life. He also yelled in front of her daughter, someone I view as a little sister. He has scarred me and terrified her.

now you‚Äôre probably thinking. That‚Äôs a little bit of an over reaction don‚Äôt you think? No. It‚Äôs not. Again I‚Äôm not gonna share what he said, but if anything has solidified me and making this decision, it‚Äôs the years and years and years of conversation and things I‚Äôve heard him say to put down my mom that is led to this decision. It‚Äôs not when I make lightly but it‚Äôs what I have to do to protect my peace.

The thought of talking to family or being around them physically made me sick. I drove to a friend‚Äôs house and cried there for a little bit and then I ended up hanging out with another friend for about three hours before I came back home. 

The party was still on, but you could cut the tension in that room with a knife. In case I didn‚Äôt mention this room was tiny. Like think college dorm but may be a little bit bigger. Not huge at all. everyone could hear every conversation so you had to be whispering or basically not talking at all. my grandpa came over and talked to me during the party, but I refused to make eye contact with him.

as the party was winding down, my mom‚Äòs dad (the good grandpa) and my other grandpa headed outside to what I assumed was to talk. I knew that more yelling can be involved immediately. Both my mom and S booked it outside to go in monitor the conversation. Since I already had at least one panic attack/crying fit, I decided to just leave and drive home with my brother.

About 45 minutes after I got home my mom called me and told me to go into my room and lock the doors. Apparently the arguing had just gotten over with (it was about an hour of everyone kind of yelling at each other). I immediately went to my room and locked my door.

later, after a lot of things had calmed down, I found out that S and my good grandpa were both arguing with my bad grandpa. Actually, S aired it all out to my bad grandpa. She yelled at him and basically called him out on all of the things he has done wrong over these past couple years. She made no mistake in calling him out and calling his bluff. I cannot be more thankful for S and what she did for our family today.

So Reddit. I know I left a lot of things out. I‚Äôd be happy to answer any questions if I get asked any, but just know that I might also be protecting my peace and not answering questions that will trigger me.

should I go no contact with my grandpa? I‚Äôm just trying to think realistically how that would work. I‚Äôm only 19 but he has destroyed any relationship that he ever thinks he could have with me. How do I go No contact with someone who is supposed to be a huge important part of my life?

(something else I feel like you should know is my parents don‚Äôt have a healthy marriage at all. My dad has told me he has never loved my mom before and my mom is constantly egging my dad on. Instead of celebrating their marriage they should‚Äôve celebrated with a divorce.)

I'm someone with autism and I have a hard time understanding people. I'm having issues with my ex co-worker. I was really close to her when we worked together. We would talk and 1 time she bought me free donuts and personal trained me for free and then 1 time I bought her a birthday cake for her birthday. I was one of the 3 person she confided in at work. She told me about her leaving the job at the time and for me not to say anything. She told me she was giving her 2 weeks and then staying for the duration of it. I didn't say anything. She did say that we can remain in contact after she leaves the job by messaging each other. Also, she said that me her and the other 2 person who she confided in can hang out later in the month. Then I broke my clavicle and have been off work since and then I found out that she resigned via email and never came in to finish her 2 weeks. She knew I broke my clavicle and I feel like she's been acting strange as of late. When I post stuff on instagram, she would usually see it but she haven't seen it in the past week. I also messaged her and she didn't respond. I'm starting to feel like she was being fake all this time. I feel like when I broke my clavicle, she showed her true colors. One of her friend who she confided in said that she would be straight forward and honest but in a nice way. But I feel like she is ghosting me and not being straight up. So I ran into her another time. She is blunt and straightforward, which is something I would like. I was close with my ex co-worker before. So I asked her about the situation regarding my ex-worker. The original plan was to meet with me, her and another person at the end of the month. But she told me that my ex co-worker doesn't want to meet up anymore and also she said that my ex coworker was busy and she doesn't have time. I also was told that my ex co-worker didn't serve out her 2 week notice because she was sick and also she didn't want to get into a confrontation with the personal trainer manager since they had a bad relationship. I was told that she resigned by email and the personal trainer manager didn't even respond to her resignation. Also, she told me straight up that she doesn't think that my ex co-worker will go out of her way to ask me to go for coffee. Although the truth hurts, I see where she's coming from and there's truth to that. The weird part was when she was working here, she bought me donuts and personal trained me for free 1 time and I bought her a birthday gift. Before she left, she told me and 2 other people not to say anything and she thinks I'm trustworthy. I didn't say anything to anyone but then I broke my clavicle and then she showed her true colors by her ignoring my texts. On one of our last texts I asked if we can remain in contact and she said yes but she can't promise me how often we can meet for coffee since she doesn't know her schedule. I was also told by the mutual friend that she told her that I was needy. I felt like my ex-worker stabbed me in the back. Also, the mutual friend said that I could message her but she wouldn't advise it because she said if I message her 1 more time, she would tell me that I'm needy and give me a piece of her mind. I was also told that although she's a nice person, it doesn't mean she wants to be my friend. I was gonna tell her but I got injured. I kept her secret and didn't tell people yet she showed her true colors and treat me like this. She's giving me mixed signals since I feel like she said that we can remain in contact but then she's ghosting me. Then I saw her story on instagram and I didn't message her and then she blocked me. I feel like she stabbed me in the back. Do you guys think she stabbed me in the back and can someone help me understand the situation better. ",0,1753588508.0,work,0,0.33,False

1mackqn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mackqn,Antique (?) Copper Engraved Coffee Table With Islamic Calligraphy?,"Hello from the K.C., MO. area.

I do not know if this type of post is allowed here since it l don't really know if this qualifies as Arabic writing.

It was purchased in the mid 1960s Turkey by a career U S. military officer and collector who was almost 90 yrs. old.

However, I'm presuming it's relevant to this forum because I believe it's a form of Islamic calligraphy.

If the moderators or administrator deem it irrelevant to this forum, I would appreciate it if someone could point me in the right direction to research this item.
It would be very helpful.
I've spent many, many hours trying to find out anything I can about it.

I recently purchased a hammered, scalloped edged, 33"" round copper coffee table at the estate sale.

I didn't think a whole lot of it at the time other than I found it interesting.

After taking it off my wall one day and propping it down with it in front of me in good light, I really started noticing all the detaiks of the intertwined engraving and fine, lightly hammered infill.

I tried trying to find out what the calligraphy is, my amateur sleuthing and what I've already known about some interpretations of the Quran, I've deduced, maybe incorrectly, that the writing is Ottoman Turkish Thuth calligraphy, but it's an educated guess.

If I'm not mistaken, images of people and animals may be considered idolatry, so passages from the Quran may have been inscribed in place of more Western, Indian, or East Asian examples I've seen online.

Any help on the history or possibly help with the type of writing it is would be amazing.

I care not for it's worth.

It's a beautiful piece of Islamic craftsmanship.
Note how the symmetrical, geometric type of identical engravings around the center all morph into different words or phrases.

Just fascinating to me as a history buff who loves learning about ancient civilizations.
I plan on polishing it and leaving it to my daughter.

I'm thinking it may be based on the six day creation story from the Quran based on the six symbols surrounding a central symbol, either Allah or The Prophet, (?) and the corona like engraving pattern around the 6 symbols.

Thank you in advance for any assistance.

But I‚Äôm here with ¬£0 in my UK Revolut account, just enough rupees left to convert into ¬£52 after TravelEx took a massive cut from the ‚Çπ9500 I handed them. ¬£1 = ‚Çπ172 they told me. The actual rate is closer to ‚Çπ116. That‚Äôs nearly 45% gone in thin air. The same air that smells of oud and capitalism.

I packed some homemade theplas before leaving India. That‚Äôs my food for the next 7 hours. And I‚Äôm grateful for it. What‚Äôs crushing me isn‚Äôt just being broke. It‚Äôs seeing a world this wealthy and realising how little of it is meant for people like me.

The coffee shops here charge more than my day‚Äôs salary back in London. A bottle of water is a joke. I tried looking for free spaces, not lounges, not retail caf√©s. just a bench to sit, breathe, write. Even that feels rationed. You‚Äôre either buying something, or you don‚Äôt exist.

I‚Äôm not asking for pity. I‚Äôm angry. Not at the airport, but at the system that built it. This terminal, like many across the world, is a monument to inequality. Designed not to serve, but to segregate. This isn‚Äôt about me being broke. This is about what kind of people the modern world was built for. And who gets left out, even in transit.

7 hours to go before I catch my flight to London. No cash left. No food left. No sleep either. But somehow, clarity.

And that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm posting here. Because I know I‚Äôm not the only one who‚Äôs sat in a polished, ultra-modern space and felt completely invisible.

This post is for everyone who‚Äôs ever passed through a place like this, surrounded by obscene wealth and felt like they weren‚Äôt meant to be there. You‚Äôre not alone.

And the next time I have signal and a bit of strength, I‚Äôm turning this into a bigger story. Because something is deeply broken, and I‚Äôm done pretending it‚Äôs normal.",2,1753588134.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

I was on lexapro, 5 mg, for 6 days. By day three I was having nightly panic attacks that kept getting worse and worse.

1mac9fl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAVoyager/comments/1mac9fl/what_is_the_best_golden_circle_tour/,What is the best Golden Circle tour?,"Just got back from an incredible Circle Island Tour of Oahu that honestly exceeded all my expectations. After researching countless options, I can confidently say this comprehensive 8-hour journey around the island is the best way to experience Hawaii's diverse landscapes and culture in a single day.

I spent weeks comparing different tour options before booking the Circle Island Tour with Waimea Waterfall (https://athometouch.com/Oahu-Island). What sold me was the perfect mix of iconic spots and hidden gems, plus the stellar reviews from other travelers.

The day starts early with a convenient pickup from Waikiki hotels around 7 AM. Our guide, a true local, shared fascinating stories about Hawaii's history and culture throughout the journey. The air-conditioned vehicle was super comfortable, which matters when you're exploring for 8 hours.

Here's what made this tour stand out:

The first stop at Diamond Head offered breathtaking coastal views - perfect for those Instagram-worthy shots. The Halona Blowhole was mesmerizing; watching the natural geyser shoot water up to 30 feet high was quite a sight. 

The North Shore portion was a highlight. We stopped at famous Sunset Beach, and our guide knew exactly where to find the best garlic shrimp trucks (definitely worth the extra cash for lunch). The local fruit stands were a delicious bonus.

The crown jewel was Waimea Valley. The botanical garden is stunning, but the waterfall swim was unforgettable. Bring your swimsuit - you won't want to miss this opportunity. The water was refreshing, and the setting felt like something out of a movie.

Other memorable stops included:
- Nu'uanu Pali Lookout for incredible valley views
- Tropical Farms for coffee and macadamia nut sampling
- Kualoa Regional Park (Jurassic Park fans will love this)
- Dole Plantation (the Dole Whip alone is worth the visit)

Pro tips from my experience:
1. Book early - tours often fill up weeks in advance
2. Bring cash for lunch and tips
3. Pack both swimming gear and a light jacket
4. Don't forget your camera - every stop is photo-worthy

The tour costs $154 per person, which initially seemed steep, but considering the included admissions and comprehensive experience, it's actually great value. They offer free cancellation up to 24 hours before, and you can reserve now and pay later through this link: https://athometouch.com/Oahu-Island

After trying various tours on different islands, this Circle Island Tour truly stands out. It's well-organized, informative, and hits all the must-see spots without feeling rushed. The small group size (max 24 people) means you get personal attention from the guide.

If you're planning a trip to Oahu and want to make the most of your time, this tour is absolutely worth booking. It's perfect for first-time visitors who want to see the island's highlights in one day.",1,1753587106.0,AskAVoyager,0,1.0,False

I sent him a slightly flirty message suggesting coffee sometime as I live not far from where his new job is located. I thought my message was pretty direct and obvious, but now I'm 2nd guessing myself.  
So he replied fairly promptly to the first text and sounded enthusiastic about getting together, said to let him know when I'm free. But when I told him my availability, it took him nearly 24 hours to respond. When he did, he suggested a lunchtime catch up on Tuesday, but I'm left feeling like the loonnnnggg response time means he may just see me as a friend. Anyway, what I want to know from a male perspective...  
* Would a guy say yes to coffee if he's not keen? Surely guys know a one on one coffee generally has saying connotations? 
* If so, why then take so long to follow up? Or is he possibly just not a big texter, busy or whatever? 

If it's relevant, I am F48 and he's M35 so there's a bit of an age gap. However he doesn't know my age, and probably thinks I'm early 40s (I look good for my age). 

Basically I'm just trying to decide if I should be writing him off based on the super slow response to my 2nd text. I'm not interested in game playing of any kind which is why I tried to be quite blunt in my original message to him.

We have made this once streamlined and truly accessible platform more expensive and more convoluted to use because it ""Makes it more interesting""???

I also adore writing conversationally, from mundane chats to lengthy letters, often permeated with a dim poetic glow. Photography also has a hold on me, and I hope to do more than just dabble in it.

*I like burning incense, time pieces, archiving and organization, collecting, and coffee.* I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted.

Just moved to atlanta for work but open to making friends anywhere. Ideally looking for fun friends to hang out with but open to more.

I'm getting back into the gym but I do bike a little. I like some creative hobbies like cross-stitching and painting. Love going to shows or checking out new coffee shops.

I'm liberal af, so please don't bother if you describe yourself as ""conservative"", ""moderate"", or ""not political"".

I do have a teen son who resides with his father in my home state. It's not far from where I live in the city so I go home every weekend. I hope to eventually have him here when things are more stable.

C.gpt came in clutch with turning the 3 martini recipe into grams and even adjusted to my exact output of espresso since I went a little over on the three shots.
All in all drinks were a success and a hit. üôå it still went slower than I expected, don't know how bar tenders do these all night.

 I think I need to pre measure beans and grind all 3 double shots together to expedite it, maybe. I basically ran through the whole process of pulling a shot 3 different times and then combined all. ",7,1753586304.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

1mabw6g,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mabw6g,Turtle matching game,"Hi y'all!        I posted these turtles and the blank bag a while ago, but I just completed the embroidery last night at 330 am. Then the birthday boy received it today at noon! 
   I hope he loves it but amongst the trucks and most importantly, the wrapping paper, it held no candle.
Parents loved it though! 
   I put extra effort into sewing the turtles' million magic rings and left long ends to weave in and everything I could do to make sure they could handle lots of play and cleanings. 
 The embroidery I have almost no faith in lasting üòÖ it's all different types of thread some bought this year some from the 80s some from friendship bracelet kits. So who knows how long the colors will last or how much friction they can take before ripping. 
I'm also sad to see how pilled the bag got just kicking around my coffee table and couch.
  I wicked love the liner I made, it was super satisfying. I saved the fabric from a broken laundry thing, it was already a perfect circle so I centered the bag and what was left was the perfect length/height of the bag. No cutting required! I just tucked the excess as I sewed. Perfect slippy material for the turtles to slide out. 
The project is finally out of my sight! Done and gone! Good riddance!! Except I miss it a little lol

Well don‚Äôt let it be a secret I like you.

I wasn‚Äôt looking or seeking and that‚Äôs what gets me.

you saw me today and made it known‚Ä¶.

I came by to get my usual banana bread blonde‚Ä¶..

well I didn‚Äôt think anyone was working but a few people on shift.

I figured by time I got over to that side of town you‚Äôd be off shift or just didn‚Äôt work today‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

I pray you boom you show up when I stop by like it‚Äôs kind of wild‚Ä¶.the first time you showed up as I was waiting in line‚Ä¶.. any time I forget and I‚Äôm just going for coffee and my mind isn‚Äôt thinking about the what ifs with you.

My life is chaotic but you know with the kids it can get wild but we handle it the best we can and make every day a good day.

But your there almost every time and boom you still make sure I know‚Ä¶üòçü§Øü•µ 

I don‚Äôt know which one is more accurate‚Ä¶..


the fact that you see me and let it be known in your own way. 


You even stuck your tongue out playing around with my son‚Ä¶.üòõ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

you really don‚Äôt know how that hits with the first emoji and the last first it makes my heart melt‚Ä¶.thats mini C*** the fact I see you already projecting your interest in me your already attempting to be kind and playful with my kids‚Ä¶.thats just amazing in its self ‚ù§Ô∏èüôè


You know from just looking in from the outside that my kids are my entire life regardless of the chaos. 

You know some of my complex situations helping my children‚Äôs mother with the kids I made along side her.

They deserve both parents regardless if we aren‚Äôt together they don‚Äôt deserve any kind of side effects due to our emotions or situation.

But I feel like deep down you see that I just can‚Äôt find the words when I see you.


You make me laugh and smile and I see you laugh and smile back ü•∞

I haven‚Äôt felt this ‚ÄúSpark the Electric feeling within the air‚Äù in a long time.

I say electric because it‚Äôs definitely energy I‚Äôve tried to remember your name I feel like I‚Äôve heard it but I keep meditating on it and trying to go back to when or replay a time I‚Äôve heard it but I can‚Äôt ever seem to match it with you.


I want to reach out I know you would like that but I can‚Äôt find you, your name I can‚Äôt recall I‚Äôve only heard it once and it was months ago.


I meditated and went down a list.

I wanted to believe it started with a T while meditating I moved to a J then ending on an M nothing making a connection.


Why do you always show up make me laugh brighten my day and then I can never ask you about how you feel towards me or just a simple could I get your name? If you‚Äôre comfortable with that of course.

I‚Äôd ask if you want to exchange snaps or numbers.

I dream of a day I can talk to you freely without restrictions or worrying about getting you in trouble.


But story time, you had been on a ladder when I came by‚Ä¶.you got off the ladder the second you saw/hear me and came out and said hi‚Ä¶.you know your very Gorgeous right?

I don‚Äôt even see you normally I think I‚Äôm more falling for your Energy and Radiance more so cause damn‚Ä¶..it‚Äôs great to just talk and laugh with you it‚Äôs so easy and relaxing I let my guard down around you.

Asap no more waiting .


Part 3 I hope üôè I hope ü§û 

Falling asleep writing this but still have you in my mind. 

At first I doubted myself I doubted how you felt but seeing as every time I come by you laugh smile and make it known by stopping your tasks and saying hi and you always say hello for as long as you can ü´∂ I can‚Äôt doubt it when you make your presence known and that energy is so Comforting‚Ä¶


Rants of a Pisces who‚Äôs been placed in warmer water ü§∑ü•∞

 

So what I‚Äôve observed as I was told.


First you pop out make a joke about my doppelg√§nger.

Second we talk for as long as possible smiling and laughing and you played with my son through the window again melted me‚Ä¶..definitely got some big points with me on that and when I pulled up in line I never saw you pop out say hi to anyone‚Ä¶so I get to pay I start roaming and bomb just like Fate your hanging out the Sliding door looking gorgeous and just casting out the most comforting of energy‚Ä¶I want to know your sign because‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ü§§ I don‚Äôt understand it at all but it‚Äôs like the warmest blanket/hug and I want to know and understand why.


But I‚Äôm awkward and I don‚Äôt want to push or rush anything so patience is key but wow you really really got me today and also made it well known your interested why else pop out every time.

We clicked pretty quickly and got close fast. We talked openly about life, goals, and struggles, and over time, I met a lot of his friends and family. It genuinely felt like a deep friendship was forming.

That said, I started noticing some things. Charles could be really rigid in conversations (like he always had to be right). Even chill discussions would turn into debates. Still, I stuck around. I gave him relationship advice, shared job tips, and tried to support him whenever he needed it. I thought that support went both ways, but looking back, I‚Äôm not so sure.

Earlier this year, we were talking about politics and he told me he was conservative. He asked about my views and I said I leaned liberal. Right away, he said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs probably just because of your dad.‚Äù I said yeah, my upbringing had some influence, but I‚Äôve formed my own opinions. He laughed and said, ‚ÄúHow much?‚Äù I told him I didn‚Äôt want to get into it and wasn‚Äôt going to quantify it. He kept going anyway, trying to convince me I actually agreed with him deep down. It didn‚Äôt feel like a respectful convo‚Äîit felt like he was trying to invalidate everything I said.

The next day, I texted him and said I felt disrespected by how he handled the conversation. I wasn‚Äôt aggressive (I just wanted to say how I felt and ask for an apology). He told me he doesn‚Äôt like texting and wanted to talk in person.

So we met up at Starbucks. I bought him a coffee, thinking we‚Äôd clear the air. Instead, it all blew up. The moment we sat down, he went off on me (said I was trying to tear him down, that I have low self-esteem, that I‚Äôm controlling, untrustworthy, and that I ‚Äúlove conflict""). It felt like he had been building up resentment and was now unloading all of it. I reminded him of how much I‚Äôd supported him (not to throw it in his face, but to show that I always had good intentions).

He ended the conversation by saying, ‚ÄúThis friendship is over.‚Äù Then he told me to get up and hug him. I said no, but offered a handshake instead. He shook my hand and walked away.

Afterward, I sent him one final message and blocked him. It basically said I didn‚Äôt agree with the things he said about me, and that I wasn‚Äôt okay with being insulted like that. I told him I didn‚Äôt want to be friends anymore and that I deserved better. I haven‚Äôt spoken to him since.

It‚Äôs been about 7 months now. I also stopped going to the church he invited me to. Recently, I overheard that he‚Äôs been telling people I‚Äôm ‚Äújust looking for attention‚Äù by not showing up anymore and staying silent. That honestly hurt, because I haven‚Äôt said a single bad thing about him to anyone‚ÄîI just left.

Now I keep wondering if I overreacted. Should I have just brushed it off instead of saying something? Did I make a big deal out of nothing? AIW?",10,1753585533.0,amiwrong,18,0.81,False

We technically dated for a year but broke up in February when she was asking for things I just financially could not afford. We've been in somewhat of a situation ship since February where we have still only been seeing each other but don't have a title. We spend every weekend together and she will often even drive to come stay with me a night during the work week. We live an hour apart so I do appreciate her traveling to see me. She still lives with her family so I only rarely will come to her house to see her. 

She is consistently passive aggressive and when she is mad will send me TikToks ""He didn't cheat but there's no dates, no effort, no flowers"" which is not applicable to our relationship what so ever - We actually go on dates every weekend (which is a financial burden I've been coping with because I genuinely do want to be with her). She complains we haven't taken any flights together, complains I am not paying for her maintenance (hair, nails, lashes) and generally does so in a way I feel belittled. I have explained that my current financial situation multiple times and she claims to understand but then it pisses me off when she claims I am not putting forth effort despite weekly dates and I have even planned trips for us this summer (one of which is supposed to be next weekend). It feels like what I do is not appreciate at all. We actually make about the same money but she lives with her family and doesn't pay rent so she has a lot more disposable income. 

She has definitely withdrawn physical intimacy too - although we do still have sex at least once when I see her - we used to be intimate A LOT more frequently. She tells me she just needs me to step it up and plan more dates - and fancier ones - and she wants me to do different things like take her to NBA games or an MLB game. I'm not opposed to this - just not sure how sustainable it is financially for me if I am still expected to keep up with all these other dates. 

I've communicated this to her and told her its getting to a point where I am feeling she doesn't want to be with me - she just wants experiences and doesn't mind if I am there. She took offense and again claims If I was ""doing more"" she would be much more affectionate again but it just feels like I'd be stupid to stretch myself thinner when I am already pretty stressed handling all of this (when in my mind she just doesn't like me the way she once did). 

When her and I started dating it wasn't like this at all - she would always tell me how much she missed me and drive out and just enjoy my presence - it seems we have to have exciting stuff to do all the time now... its kind of chunking my self esteem and I am normally a very confident guy. I have had multiple other women express interest in me but I've turned them all down despite technically being ""single"". 

She does do little things here and there that make me think she still cares for me like will send me a little money for my morning coffee when she gets her paycheck but its kind of in a position I genuinely don't feel wanted a lot of the time and I am already stretched thin and have no desire to stretch myself thinner for someone I feel isn't as interested in me anymore. 

Is it time to call it? All of this also really undermines my sense of security in the relationship and she does go out ALL the time to bars and clubs with her friends and recently hasn't been inviting me anymore like she used to. ",3,1753585296.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

I drew him a portrait weeks ago and somewhat asks how's the drawing when we get to chat (we don't chat regularly, I always seem to initiate the conversation) I finally finished my drawing and decided to give him that along with a set of origami paper cause he mentioned he have been wanting to make origami flowers but never had the chance to. He was smiling while staring at the portrait then thanked him. After that, we grabbed coffee and just talked.

He mentioned that his friends bought him a dating app subscription for a week and he said he tried to make the most out of it then told me not to try cause it's not worth it. We just talked about a few more stuff. I'm supposed to go to a party but there's still time and we talked again in the pool area of their condo. He shared stuff about his mom, I just listened and gave him my insights. When I was about to leave, I told him that if I don't get drunk in the party, let's continue our chat, he agreed.

We met again after the party, we stayed in their home a bit and ate pizza, talked a bit about music, he also asked if I believe if guys and girls can be friends, I said yes and he said he kinda has a mixed reaction. He also asked if it's alright for a boy and girl friend to hangout if the person has a partner. I said, if the friend is really in the lowest point of his/her life, has a problem, wants to celebrate, or has been their friend for more than 5 or 10 years, it's alright with me. He said that he agrees, if the friend they hangout with is their friend for a long time.

After that, we grabbed coffee again, played 2 hours of billards, then slept on his room. I had 0 plans of sleeping there in the morning but I fell asleep for a few minutes while sitting and maybe he saw I look like a mess so he insisted that I should just sleep there. He slept on the floor and I slept on his bed (I feel bad cause it's cold on the floor even if he had giant pillows under him)

I get a feeling that he doesn't like me, because we haven't talked about our feelings yet, and we don't flirt up front. Maybe he just also hung out with me cause he's thankful for the portrait. Is it normal for a guy to hangout with someone who's interested in them?

No experience is necessary as long as you are honest and affectionate. I am very attracted to all adult ages and nationalities and body shapes from thin to curvy. I would like to get to know each other to develop a good trusting friendship, hopefully followed by an incredible dynamic filled with fun times, and intense pleasures in a personal relationship with a strong emotional connection. You will find me to always be fair and respectful, as well as funny and adventurous.

A discreet recent picture of me is posted in my profile. Because of my public profession, I can‚Äôt post or send identifying pictures online, but we can introduce ourselves in a videochat conversation. Please be willing to videochat with me soon; let me know which videochat app(s) you prefer. I choose to be private with my pictures, my full name, my age, and address especially on websites, but when we meet I will always be fully transparent and I will always be honest with you.

We can start with a casual coffee date and if we like each other, we can talk about dating more and spending time together with the possibility of so much more. Let me know what kind of dynamic that you wish for, and we can adjust our situation to make it great for both of us. I'm open to short-term, friends, dating, and even maybe eventually long-term. I like outdoor activities such as hiking and bicycling and boating and tennis, and I would love an upbeat fun activities exercise partner. I also like staying at home and cooking dinner or watching a movie together. I would also like to explore new places and events with my girlfriend. I want a close and intimate and trusting bond with a nice girl who really cares about fitness and good health and helping others.

I'm 5'9"", 205 pound, athletic and muscular, but not perfect or ripped, and I'm not looking for flawless people but youthful girls who want to eat and live healthy, exercise and always make ourselves better together while having so much fun together. Let‚Äôs start getting to know one another.

I am into personal touch, as my love language with many hugs, gentle aftercare, kissing, PDAs, holding hands, and cuddling. I hope for intense intimacy and a strong positive emotional connection. I desire quality time together and many fun dates exploring and always getting to know ourselves better.

1mabe5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/wetbrain/comments/1mabe5p/i_think_i_got_wks_from_an_eating_disorder/,I think I got WKS from an eating disorder.,"Some background.  I started what I now know was an eating disorder after getting laid off in jan of 2019 and went on an overnight ""diet"" of \~1200 cal a day along with approx 20 miles a day on a bicycle.  I lost about 50lb by late fall when i started a job.  I would wake up early to get a 13mi ride in before work and usually another after work with the same 1200 cal intake.  When lockdowns happened I lost what little control I had and increased mileage to 25, 30, 40+ miles per day on a restriction.  I was down to 118lb by summer of 20 from a start of 200.  Frustrated that I was still ""Fat"" I accidentally learned that artificial sweeteners caused a laxative effect along with a coffee/caffeine intake that eventually hit 2\~3000mg per day (for real..)  I started ever increasing my fake sugar intake and added otc laxatives until I was having multiple daily bouts of diarrhea.  During this time my ""food"" was usually a breakfast of protein powder in coffee with maybe some puffed rice in artificially sweetened almond milk.  I would purge approx 3-4 times before riding \~30mi in all weather conditions.  Get home and have ""lunch"" consisting of coffee zero sugar jello topped with a 1/1 ratio of cocoa powder and granular erithrytol for crunch until diarrhea again.  Dinner was usually a dry cast iron skilled full of random vegetables on high heat until they were burnt to charcoal with some lettuce and zero sugar dressing.  This went on in one form or another until approximately fall of 23 when my new therapist basically said she couldn't help unless I could stop that otherwise I would be dead, disabled, or inpatient.

During this time I was fully avoiding treatment because I was worried if I was honest with my doctor I would get the help I should have gotten and I ""would have got fat""

I was experiencing near daily, crippling anxiety and panic attacks, muscle pain and leg cramps, joint pain, burning feet that I scratched to bleeding so bad my sheets would be stuck to them in the morning, balance issues, insomnia, irritability, depression, I was weak and constantly very tired and cold feeling, I became functionally illiterate (I could read a word or sentence but could not understand paragraphs),  my vision was out of focus along with daily nystagmus and hallucinating flashes of blue and white light and thrumbing noises in my ears. I was delirious and could not think.  I had to switch to children's audio books during bike rides because I couldn't make sense of adult literature, I had chronically numb hands and fingers and a tremor in my hands.

This went untreated for about 3 years..  I was intentionally trying to flush myself out every day as much as I could.  Calories eventually went up due to a binge/purge cycle but there was very little nutrient diversity.  I never thought I was an alcoholic but there was a problematic use of 1-4 drinks at night for a large portion of this due to depression and anxiety.  I wasn't "" a ton "" but it was for the wrong reasons and chronic.

I still exercise and purge but usually no more diarrhea and no more burnt dinners.  Probably a good 18 months now from the worst of it and I'm in recovery now but I've had many lasting effects.   Depression, anxiety, and apathy/numbness.  Not debilitating but regular balance and hand coordination issues.  Drooping left eyelid and blurry left eye.  Occasional slight horizontal nystagmus.  And recently I've become more aware of ongoing memory problems, and most concerning is I've noticed I confidently ""remembering"" things that didn't happen or happened way different than I remember.  There's big gaps in memories of things even in the last two years.

I actually did bring this up to my Psychiatrist two years ago but she immediately said no that for alcoholics, and I forgot about it until I found a purple wiki link last night while searching for memory issues in anorexia.

1mabcha,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1mabcha/ghosted/,Ghosted,"My name is Edward Foster. I'm a psychiatrist. I see patients, and I determine their ailments. I‚Äôm 38. I live alone, and I drink heavily. The demons in my head are making it difficult to type this out. This is very important, so listen up.



I have to tell you about my patient. My patient James. You see a lot of unfortunate cases of extremely unwell patients in this profession. Complete Norman Bates f\*cking psychos. Most of the time I'm booked up. The same people every week. Some of them I might not think were sick, but who else would come to my office every Wednesday and talk about every insecurity they have for 4 years straight. Sorry Janice.¬†



My schedule freed up when one of my patients died. I don‚Äôt beat myself up over it. Anyone in the profession will tell you it happens. I saw potential for Clark, but he couldn‚Äôt see it himself. Anyway, I had an opening.



James was different. He wasn‚Äôt obviously insane, and he wasn‚Äôt someone who just wanted to vent either. He was one that seemed normal. Normal to anyone who hit him up for chit chat, but it was when you had a long conversation with him. A long conversation revealed he was definitely unwell and probably a flight risk. He was just extremely good at masking it.¬†



So I sat down with him every Monday, and tried to figure him out. After multiple sessions he began to open up. He told me about his obsessions with the occult, demonology, alternate dimensions.



‚ÄúLots of people are fascinated with the occult doc. Lots of people. It doesn‚Äôt make me bad or evil. I'm just curious. Really curious, that's all. I can‚Äôt stop reading about it. I just- well Dr. Foster you should really check out the book I'm reading. By Crowley. It‚Äôs really something doc. Not dull stuff.‚Äù



I was curious what he wanted out of these sessions. No one was forcing him to see me. He came voluntarily. I thought maybe he was aware his mind was slipping.



And then I didn‚Äôt see James for months. He vanished, just like that. I didn‚Äôt think about it much. I went onward.¬†



Then one day I came home from work in the afternoon, and poured myself a scotch. My place is really clean, so I noticed the paper sitting on my counter. I sipped my scotch and read.



‚ÄúHey Dr. Foster, it‚Äôs me James. Please listen. Please listen to what I have to say. Below I have written 6 steps. Please follow the steps. I know it seems silly, but I will explain everything after. -your friend James‚Äù



These were the following steps.



‚ÄúStep 1: Go to the bathroom

Step 2: Close the door

Step 3: Turn on running water (sink, bathtub, or showerhead)

Step 4: Turn out the lights

Step 5: Get on your knees

Step 6: Say these ancient words



tsacy eht gnip eer c pu siohw‚Äù



It was unsettling, to know James had broken into my house. He didn‚Äôt take anything. Just left a stupid note. So I called the police. They searched the home, and didn‚Äôt find him. So they put a warrant out for his arrest, and that was it. I knew James was batsh\*t, bananas, a certified silly goose who belonged in a straightjacket.¬†



I was extremely cautious to lock every possible entrance to my house the following days. But the notes kept showing up. I called the police a couple more times, but there was nothing they could do. I had the option to stay somewhere else, but I wasn‚Äôt going to let James drive me out of my house. It would be too much of a pain to move, and I‚Äôve never seen him be violent. I figured I'd catch him, and talk some sense into him.



The creepiest part about all this is that there were no signs of entry anywhere. Everytime I came home the doors and windows were still closed and locked.¬†



The notes after the first go as follows:



1. ‚ÄúFoster this is not a joke. I told you what you have to do. I won‚Äôt cause you any trouble. Just do this one thing for me. -James‚Äù



‚ÄúStep 1: Go to the bathroom

Step 2: Close the door

1. ‚ÄúYou're going to regret this Foster.‚Äù



The last one chilled me to the bone, because of how I found it. I didn‚Äôt find it after coming home from work like the others. I was watching television on the couch with my feet on the coffee table. I got up to use the bathroom. When I came back it was there. On the coffee table. I knew immediately he was near. I called out to him. ‚ÄúJames come out here. Let‚Äôs talk about this.‚Äù Silence. ‚ÄúJames?‚Äù¬†



Then it began. A book flew off my shelf at mach speed, missing my head by a foot. Then my ceiling fan swung back and forth and fell.¬† An entity I couldn‚Äôt see was trashing my room. Papers flew about, chairs hurled at me, and my belongings smashed. Then everything stopped, for a moment. Then my old wooden baseball bat floated towards me and swung into my kneecap, my ribs, and my family jewels.¬†



As I laid on the floor groaning in pain, another note was written. It was crumbled up and thrown at my face.



‚ÄúI will f\*ck you up Edward. I will follow you. I will beat you. I will breathe on your face when you're in bed. I will do everything I can to make your life as painful, miserable, and uncomfortable as possible.‚Äù



‚ÄúStep 1: Go to the bathroom

Step 2: Close the door

Step 3: Turn on running water (sink, bathtub, showerhead)

Step 4: Turn out the lights

Step 5: Get on your knees

Step 6: Say these ancient words



tsacy eht gnip eer c pu siohw‚Äù



I folded immediately. I don‚Äôt like being hit with baseball bats, and I'm not fond of ghosts either. So I went to the bathroom to appease James. I closed the door, turned on my shower, and cut the lights. I got on my knees and forgot the words. I turned the light on, said the words over and over. Then I tried again. I turned the lights out and spoke the words best I could. ‚ÄúTsacy eht gnip eer c pu siohw.‚Äù¬†



My body was lifted off the ground. I heard voices, whispers. They weren‚Äôt in any language I knew. My best guess is middle eastern. Some sort of Hebrew or Arabic maybe? I did my best to move toward the light switch. I cut the lights on and what do ya know? My body was gone. Completely invisible. I had to feel around for the doorknob. It was difficult to even know where my hand was. The voices quieted down.



I opened the bathroom door and saw James. In the flesh James. He said your name. Yes, your name. You reading this. I can‚Äôt post your actual name or info here, because of some demon curses and website rules and regulations and stuff. It isn't important. What is important is I‚Äôm coming for you.



I've spent the last few days hearing voices, presumably demons giving me all kinds of information. For some reason they wouldn‚Äôt give me your phone number or anything. They told me you go on this website often though, and I could reach you by posting here. They also told me ‚ÄúRelease and be released.‚Äù I released James. That's what the demons call it anyway.



You see, when you release someone they get to choose the next victim. Someone released the first ghost, and the first ghost gave that person James‚Äô name. James released the second ghost. It gave James my name. Then I released James, and he gave me your name.¬†



I‚Äôm not sure who gave James my name. Who had it out for me? Is it a coincidence that James knew me before he and I were picked to become ghosts? I don‚Äôt know, but when you release me I will find and kill whoever involved me in this. Being a ghost f\*cking sucks. I can‚Äôt get the voices out of my head. People are terrified when I move any object. That was funny at first, but I'm tired of the screams now. I just want quiet.



Please listen to me. Don‚Äôt make it harder than it has to be. We can streamline this, and no one has to suffer for too long. You follow the steps, and then make the next one follow the steps.¬†



I'm on my way to your house. You have about a day. Why did James have to pick someone halfway across the states? I'm not sure why James picked you. Maybe you two have beef, or maybe he saw your name flipping through a newspaper in my house. Either way, the sooner you follow those steps, the sooner you can be released and kill him.¬†



Everything is explained to you now. There is nothing left, but for you to do what must be done. If you don‚Äôt I will torment you or make ghost love to your girlfriend or something. So do us both a favor and get it over with. In case you're too lazy to scroll up, here they are again.

1mabbza,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1mabbza/rf_the_night_at_brookside_community_center/,[RF] The Night at Brookside Community Center,"The Idea for this story came to me in a dream. 'most' of whats here happened in the dream. I just added for the story. Enjoy!

The snow began as a gentle little sprinkle. Quite lovely, really. The sort that makes you roll your eyes at the weather app because it insisted there‚Äôd be a ""historic winter event."" But in just twenty minutes, that gentle sprinkle escalated into a whiteout so dense that the road seemed to vanish completely. No lines, no shoulder, no idea where the world ended and the ditch started.

The wind was the worst part, not merely blowing, but pushing the car as if it had a personal vendetta.

""Mom, we‚Äôre not actually staying on the road, are we?"" her sixteen-year-old asked. He had that tone of someone trying to sound composed while already picturing their obituary.

""Nope,"" she replied, her jaw clenched, both hands gripping the steering wheel tightly. ""We‚Äôre getting off before we become a news story.""

She inched along until a parking lot light broke through the chaos, a halo in the blizzard. The sign, half-buried in snow, read: Brookside Community Center. The building was dark except for a faint glow at the back.

She pulled in and turned off the engine. The snow was already creeping up the tires. They sat in silence, the heater humming, the outside world resembling the apocalypse.

Her son was the first to speak. ""Bathroom?""

She shot him a look. ""If it‚Äôs locked, you‚Äôre not peeing in the car.""

They trudged through the snowdrifts to the front doors. To their surprise, they were unlocked. The place had a faint smell of bleach and basketball sneakers, but it was warm. That was good enough.

They hit the bathrooms, but before the sinks stopped running, they heard tires crunching outside. Then again. And again.

Within an hour, the lobby transformed into a waiting room for storm refugees: families, a few college kids, a trucker, and some guy walking his golden retriever (because apparently that was his plan for the evening). Everyone shared the same story: roads were gone, visibility was zero, and they were all waiting for the plows.

Initially, nobody really spoke much. Just a bunch of strangers gazing out the large glass windows, their phones lighting up as they checked the radar every five seconds, as if that would make a difference. But gradually, the atmosphere relaxed.

The truck driver pulled out a huge thermos filled with coffee. ""This is going to go to waste if no one helps me drink it,"" he remarked. Cups started appearing from glove compartments like some bizarre magic trick.

A mother with little kids dumped a box of crackers on the counter. ""Looks like a community potluck, huh?"" she said with a shrug.

One of the college students stumbled upon a vending machine and, after some fiddling with a credit card and a bit of questionable ethics, liberated a bunch of chips and candy bars. No one complained.

The guy with the dog turned into the unofficial emotional support unit. Everyone gave the golden retriever a pat at least once, some even multiple times, because nothing makes a blizzard more bearable than a warm dog head resting in your lap.

Someone found that the gym had thick blue mats and dragged them out to make the hard tile floor more comfortable. Another person discovered a closet full of board games. By midnight, the lobby didn‚Äôt feel like a lobby anymore. It felt like a quirky, makeshift neighborhood, complete with snacks, coffee, a snoring dog, and a growing group of half-frozen folks getting to know each other.

The storm continued to howl against the glass, but inside, things became oddly‚Ä¶ peaceful. Not exactly cheerful, but steady. People exchanged stories about their destinations, the worst weather they‚Äôd ever encountered, and what they‚Äôd do first once they could finally leave. Nobody was in a hurry.

At some point, someone unearthed a tangled mess of Christmas lights in a storage room, likely leftover from some event, and strung them up in the lobby. The warm glow made the entire place feel cozier, as if they weren‚Äôt just passing the time but genuinely sharing it.

The mom and her son even got into a heated game of Uno, which ended with the trucker declaring he was done with card games for good. The golden retriever barked as if he agreed.

Nobody really got any sleep. The wind was too noisy, the floor was too hard, and technically they were all trespassing, which made the whole night feel a bit surreal. But when dawn finally arrived and the plows rolled by, the outside world seemed like a fresh start, quiet, white, and safe once more.

People started packing up. They waved goodbye, exchanged phrases like ""Good luck"" and ""Drive safe"" and ""Text me when you get home"", fully aware that most of those numbers would likely never be dialed. Nobody had the right words to describe what the night had been like, so they just let it go.

The mom and her son were among the last to head out. As they stepped into the crisp morning air, her son looked back at the community center.

""Do you think anyone will believe us when we share this story?"" he asked.

She smiled, brushing snow off his hood. ""Probably not. But it‚Äôs a good one, right?""

And together, they drove off into the peaceful morning, a bit tired, a bit sore, but somehow feeling lighter.",1,1753584129.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôm a little nervous. This year feels big. Depending on how it goes, I‚Äôll decide whether I keep teaching‚Ä¶ or finally ride off into the sunset (preferably on a beach with a cold cherry coke in hand).

There is a spark of excitement though, I‚Äôll be teaching some new content this year, so at least the kids and I can be confused together for the first couple of weeks. üòÑ

But honestly, my heart is a bit heavy. My work bestie won‚Äôt be by my side this year as they focus on their health. It just won‚Äôt be the same without them (don‚Äôt we all have something going on these days? üòî).

Here‚Äôs to a fresh start, strong coffee, patient hearts, and whatever this school year decides to throw our way. I must remind myself that pink is a powerful color and by gosh this Barbie can climb any mountain in her way! üíõüìö‚úèÔ∏è",1,1753584110.0,TeacherMusings,0,1.0,False
1mabba0,https://www.reddit.com/r/motherinlawsfromhell/comments/1mabba0/this_is_crazy_right/,This is crazy right?,"I (38F) and partner 33M live 45 mins away from MIL. When I was fresh postpartum in 2023 with new baby she wanted to come over every other weekend and sleep on our couch. I came back from a work trip late 2024 at a rural cabin excited to lie in my own bed and laid in my bed and smelled patchouli (she‚Äôs always drenched in it) and realized she had slept in my bed! On my side! I kept my baby monitor on so I could see my little son go to sleep and knew my partner was asleep in our sons room with him bc I have a wifi camera. He said he never gave her permission to sleep in our bed. So I know that instead of sleeping on our couch she helped herself to our BEDROOM. She hasn‚Äôt slept over since then bc I said I AM DONE! I am currently starting traumatic birth therapy this week. Back to 2023 she snuck into my hospital room at 5-6am when I was spending the night after emergency c section and blurted out ‚Äúoh is he (her adult son) sleeping? I texted him!‚Äù Yes he was sleeping, in the hospital room just like me and baby were. And proceeded to drop off coffees beside me and go okay guess I‚Äôll go now! she woke me up sneaking/barging in and gave me a full blown panic attack! She had already been to the hospital twice the day before (the day of my emergency surgery) and even pulled her son to ‚Äúgo for coffee‚Äù within hours of sons birth before I had even gotten to do skin to skin and the 3 of us (partner baby and I) hadn‚Äôt even spent time bonding yet and I had no idea where he was!! I had to call him and he said ‚Äúoh my mom wanted to go for coffee! (in the hospital cafeteria)‚Äù. The first time she stayed over in 2023 after baby was born (when she would stay on our couch, almost every other weekend, bc we have no extra bedroom and she refuses to sleep in RV with full kitchen and bathroom that we have on property for guests) she fell down the stairs drunk. She told me in front of him make sure you do your stretches! And pointed to the vagina (stretch it for birth?) and ask for an episiotomy! she asks deeply personal questions all the time. 

Her last text to both of us was ‚ÄúAre you ok!‚Äù followed by his grandmother and father (he was pressured to call son and even guilt tripped for not worrying about him more) due to a thunderstorm warning in our area on my due date!! A little storm! I‚Äôm 38 years old! We‚Äôre fine!!! Last week, the day before my due date with #2, she showed up in my driveway as I was leaving the house because she was heading to the farmers market in my town 45 mins away and she ‚Äúwanted to show her friend where we live!‚Äù I‚Äôm absolutely petrified that she‚Äôll show up at the hospital again or show up at our house and haven‚Äôt sent a text yet about boundaries but plan to.",7,1753584068.0,motherinlawsfromhell,2,1.0,False

1mab9e9,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1mab9e9/tifu_by_washing_the_dishes_at_work/,TIFU by washing the dishes at work.,"TL;DR I accidentally sprayed dish soap in my only good eye at work today trying to do the dishes.

I work at a small coffee shop and as it's getting closer to 2pm, I start to run the dish water so I can get some of the dishes done early. We close.at 4pm. And after running the sani sink and dropping the sanitizer tablets in the one sink, I run the other sink. And after finishing up filling that sink I grab the dish soap we use. And as I squeeze the pump the first time nothing came out. So I pushed a second time really hard, and the next thing I feel is a very strong burning sensation coming from my left eye. Unfortunately for me, due to a birth defect in my right eye, I can't see very well. I had to grab the bottle of soap and run to across the store.  to the cashier who was the middle of taking someone's order, so she could read to me how long i needed to rinse my eye out and if we needed to contact a hospital.
