1j3bjf2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1j3bjf2/relationship_advice_26f49m/,Relationship Advice 26F/49M,"So, let me start by giving you some context. I‚Äôm 26F and I‚Äôve had many unfulfilling relationships in my past, nothing lasting more than 6 months. To be honest, love is not something that I actively pursue; I‚Äôm an artist and a freelancer and I‚Äôve lived alone since I was 18, so basically getting work and manifesting more abundance has been my primarily focus. I was single for 4 years before this happened, with flings and ONS and I was fine with that. However, I did know the kind of person I wanted to be with, so when this person showed up (back in July 2024) I knew I had manifested him: 49M, handsome, rich, mature, very loving and caring and completely obsessed with me. 

So, we met through a dating app; he was traveling and was supposed to go to a country that required a yellow fever certificate that he didn‚Äôt have, so he decided to come to my country instead. We met and I wasn‚Äôt feeling great so we said goodbye at the end of the night and that was that. He texted me the next day and said he wanted to buy one of my paintings he had seen on my website before he left, so we met the next day for coffee and I gave him the painting. We had a very nice conversation and I paid for the coffee since he‚Äôd paid for the drinks the night before. I was sure that was the end of that; it was pleasant but I didn‚Äôt think anything else would come out of it, but we continued texting and we got along great. 

So my bday is in October, and he told me he‚Äôd come to my country and if that was okay with me, we could get to know each other better. He came in October and we spent 10 wonderful days; we finally kissed and we had amazing chemistry and we slept together and it was great. I can honestly say I‚Äôve never felt this way before. The sex was amazing and he was caring and attentive. He left (he lives in another continent, I might add) and he said he was so happy that he didn‚Äôt have the yellow fever certificate and that fate had brought him to my country. I thought, again, that nothing would come out of it. I was not being pessimistic or anything, I just felt like we had an amazing time but it was hard to be together due to the distance, so I really didn‚Äôt think anything serious would come out of it. To my surprise, he suggested to come back or that I fly out to him within two weeks of parting ways. He suggested I could go visit him and he would pay for my tickets and my stay. I agreed and he bought tickets for me three months away, at the end of January. So destiny comes into play again, as I was confirmed to be in a group exhibition for my art during the dates I‚Äôd be there, and I truly felt that was destiny talking to me. 

So we continued talking all this time, from November to the end of January, deepening our connection. We talked daily, despite the time zone difference, we sexted often, we sent pictures and selfies and all of that. It was amazing and I enjoyed this part as much as actually being physically together. We got to know each other really well and developed a lot of trust. He helped me navigate some body image issues I had. I finally traveled to his country for ten days. We also went to another country for the weekend and just enjoyed each other‚Äôs company immensely. I‚Äôm a very cautious person when it comes to relationships so I can honestly and objectively say I looked for all the red flags and the only one I found was that he felt a little uncomfortable with public displays of affection because he said he felt judged and that people looked at him like a ‚Äúdirty old man‚Äù, something that wasn‚Äôt apparent when we were in my country. I even met his kid (16F) and one of his friends; he was a perfect gentleman, he paid for everything, he went with me to the exhibition and I introduced him to the gallerist, and overall we were very much in love the whole time. No problems, no arguments, anything. The last night I spent there, we cuddled the whole time watching the great British bake off, and we slept holding each other‚Äôs hands. When it was time to say goodbye, we cried at the airport (I cried, he cried, and we hugged). 

So I came back to my country and everything seems pretty normal. We continued to text and send voice notes, and I allowed myself to be a bit more loving than usual. We sent songs to each other everyday and I sent him love songs and he replied with love songs that mirrored my own feelings (I feel like this part is important because before I‚Äôd never send him love songs thinking that maybe he‚Äôd interpret them like I had stronger feelings for him than I did, but when I finally did it, he also replied with love songs that pretty much answered what I had sent. For example, i sent him ‚ÄúIf I fell‚Äù by the Beatles, and he replied with ‚ÄúGod only knows‚Äù by the Beach Boys).

So fast forward to February 14th, when he entered a Vipassana meditation retreat he had booked back in 2024. I knew we would be in no contact for 10 days and it would be hard, but I continued to send him texts when something reminded me of him or something like that, knowing he‚Äôd read them when he got out. When he went out of the retreat, he texted me and replied to my texts, and said he felt really tired but we could sext later (I had mentioned in my texts that I was very horny and wished we could sext soon.). But over the next couple of days, he continued saying that he was very depressed and had a lot of trouble adjusting to ‚Äúnormal life‚Äù. He showed me the email he sent to the people in the retreat asking for help. I was very supportive and I suggested he talked to someone and he said he‚Äôd talk to his sister who is a counsellor. He finally did, and he said that he felt a lot better and that his mind was more at peace. 

Fast forward to three days ago. He texts that one of the reasons that was causing his anxiety was how I felt about ‚Äúbeing friends and lovers‚Äù and that he didn‚Äôt want to hurt me by not being that emotionally available. I was stunned. I know we haven‚Äôt had a talk about where this was going or labelled it, but this felt completely out of the blue and out of character from what I‚Äôve been getting from him. He said that the retreat has caused him to take stock of his life and that he have never though about things progressing to a serious relationship because of the distance and the age difference, and that he saw things ending in a friendship rather than a serious relationship. I told him that I didn‚Äôt want a ‚Äúserious‚Äù relationship right away but that we could continue to explore each others feelings like we‚Äôve been doing, no pressure, but that it wasn‚Äôt going to work if he felt lukewarm about me. He said, and I quote, ‚ÄúLukewarm isn‚Äôt the right word for me at all - I really like you and I care about you and I like hanging out, but I‚Äôm not in love with you. It hasn‚Äôt developed like that for me. And so I‚Äôve been getting in really worried about things from your side as I don‚Äôt see it ending in a long term monogamous relationship but a friendship.‚Äù

Long story short we ‚Äúbroke up‚Äù and now I feel completely gutted and devasted. I‚Äôm wondering if I did something to push him away and make him change his mind about me? I felt he was the love of my life and now it‚Äôs all gone :( ",1,1741097220.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm trying to determine the fairness of d20 dice. 
I‚Äôve already used the dice floating in salt water, and I also did a chi-squared test on a series of almost 1000 rolls. 
However, I thought about refining my methods some months ago by measuring each pair of faces accurately. 

I started with a cheap digital caliper that got me going, but I studied a little bit of metrology and decided to go with a nice micrometer. I bought a mitutoyo 0.001mm micrometer (103-129). Since dice are about 15-22mm in average, I bought a 0-25mm micrometer. 

It‚Äôs been working alright. After I take measurements from each opposing side, I plot then, calculate an average of 10 measurements, and I can then use the dimensions difference to create a modified probability for each face (faces that share a shorter distance between themselves are more likely to show up than faces with a longer distance between themselves).

When I use this tool, I take everything out, lay then on the table, go for coffee while a wait them to reach the temperature I set with my air conditioner: 20¬∞C, as it is the temperature the micrometer has been calibrated. I make sure the faces of the micrometer are clean, and then I check if it zeroes properly. 

I then hold the micrometer and die with my left hand and rotate the ratchet on the thimble with my right hand until it clicks. I then try to make soft adjustments with the die on my left hand while clicking the ratchet further as to gain the firmest grip. I thought about using gloves, but I only have nitrilic gloves available, and I don‚Äôt think it may offer any significant difference. These gloves were designed for self protection after all, i was concerned as some of these use powder that it would eventually end up inside the tool, and possibly damaging the fine mechanism of it.

Reading the vernier scale is no big deal, i usually take around a minute or two to each measurement. (Fun fact- if you upload a picture of the micrometer to AI and ask it to read it, it will fail miserably!)

I‚Äôm having a lot of fun going down this rabbit hole of determining dice bias. 

What I want to ask you guys, expert metrologists, is: am I doing anything wrong? Is there any room for improvement? What would you do differently? What would you recommend me? Bear in mind that I have no technical training at all, and all my knowledge and training in maths, statistics and metrology came from Reddit/youtube/chatgpt. I may be missing some obvious things.

That‚Äôs a picture of my setup ready for another measurement. ",1,1741097190.0,Metrology,0,1.0,False

I am finally returning back to writing after a long (maternity) break. I finally have a somewhat decent schedule that helps me squeeze in some short writing sessions. But I am facing a problem I did not have before. 

There are things happening in my life currently that cause me a lot of stress and anxiety. The thing is, writing used to be my escape from the problems. It used to be on par with video gaming - the moment I sat down, I could forget my worries. But right now, it is the exact opposite. I sit down and tend to wander off mid-writing, pondering about the problems and feeling the anxiety creep up. It is not writer's block, since I am full of ideas and really want to get them on paper. 

I decided to cut back on coffee to see if that helps, but what else can I do? What tips and tricks do you guys use?

Then barter with neighbors for other products.¬†

So for example, I find a wholesale distributor and buy 100 20lbs bags of rice. My neighbor buys 200 1lbs bags of coffee from another distributor. We agree that one bag of rice and five bags of coffee are both worth about $50, so we trade them (please don‚Äôt kill me on the numbers, it‚Äôs just a concept).

In the end, we‚Äôre both paying wholesale prices and not giving money to Panda Express or Starbucks. It‚Äôs basically a co-op but directly in your neighborhood. No need to drive, just walk and pick up. 

I suppose people could sell rice and coffee but that might bring the government and taxes into the equation. But maybe slipping $10 cash for a bag of coffee would go unnoticed.¬†

The major hurdles could be having to organize with your neighbors (aghast!) and also the actual sourcing of the wholesale products.¬†

1j3bc4r,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j3bc4r,SP question. Very long story but I‚Äôm New to this and I need help desperately.,"Hey guys! I‚Äôm a bit new to this whole ‚ÄúSP‚Äù thing. I‚Äôm not new to manifestation, but I‚Äôve never thought I‚Äôd use it to manifest a SP, but I definitely feel like this might be one of those cases. 

So, let me start by giving you some context. I‚Äôm 26F and I‚Äôve had many unfulfilling relationships in my past, nothing lasting more than 6 months. To be honest, love is not something that I actively pursue; I‚Äôm an artist and a freelancer and I‚Äôve lived alone since I was 18, so basically getting work and manifesting more abundance has been my primarily focus. I was single for 4 years before this happened, with flings and ONS and I was fine with that. However, I did know the kind of person I wanted to be with, so when this person showed up (back in July 2024) I knew I had manifested him: 49M, handsome, rich, mature, very loving and caring and completely obsessed with me. 

So, we met through a dating app; he was traveling and was supposed to go to a country that required a yellow fever certificate that he didn‚Äôt have, so he decided to come to my country instead. We met and I wasn‚Äôt feeling great so we said goodbye at the end of the night and that was that. He texted me the next day and said he wanted to buy one of my paintings he had seen on my website before he left, so we met the next day for coffee and I gave him the painting. We had a very nice conversation and I paid for the coffee since he‚Äôd paid for the drinks the night before. I was sure that was the end of that; it was pleasant but I didn‚Äôt think anything else would come out of it, but we continued texting and we got along great. 

So my bday is in October, and he told me he‚Äôd come to my country and if that was okay with me, we could get to know each other better. He came in October and we spent 10 wonderful days; we finally kissed and we had amazing chemistry and we slept together and it was great. I can honestly say I‚Äôve never felt this way before. The sex was amazing and he was caring and attentive. He left (he lives in another continent, I might add) and he said he was so happy that he didn‚Äôt have the yellow fever certificate and that fate had brought him to my country. I thought, again, that nothing would come out of it. I was not being pessimistic or anything, I just felt like we had an amazing time but it was hard to be together due to the distance, so I really didn‚Äôt think anything serious would come out of it. To my surprise, he suggested to come back or that I fly out to him within two weeks of parting ways. He suggested I could go visit him and he would pay for my tickets and my stay. I agreed and he bought tickets for me three months away, at the end of January. So destiny comes into play again, as I was confirmed to be in a group exhibition for my art during the dates I‚Äôd be there, and I truly felt that was destiny talking to me. 

So we continued talking all this time, from November to the end of January, deepening our connection. We talked daily, despite the time zone difference, we sexted often, we sent pictures and selfies and all of that. It was amazing and I enjoyed this part as much as actually being physically together. We got to know each other really well and developed a lot of trust. He helped me navigate some body image issues I had. I finally traveled to his country for ten days. We also went to another country for the weekend and just enjoyed each other‚Äôs company immensely. I‚Äôm a very cautious person when it comes to relationships so I can honestly and objectively say I looked for all the red flags and the only one I found was that he felt a little uncomfortable with public displays of affection because he said he felt judged and that people looked at him like a ‚Äúdirty old man‚Äù, something that wasn‚Äôt apparent when we were in my country. I even met his kid (16F) and one of his friends; he was a perfect gentleman, he paid for everything, he went with me to the exhibition and I introduced him to the gallerist, and overall we were very much in love the whole time. No problems, no arguments, anything. The last night I spent there, we cuddled the whole time watching the great British bake off, and we slept holding each other‚Äôs hands. When it was time to say goodbye, we cried at the airport (I cried, he cried, and we hugged). 

So I came back to my country and everything seems pretty normal. We continued to text and send voice notes, and I allowed myself to be a bit more loving than usual. We sent songs to each other everyday and I sent him love songs and he replied with love songs that mirrored my own feelings (I feel like this part is important because before I‚Äôd never send him love songs thinking that maybe he‚Äôd interpret them like I had stronger feelings for him than I did, but when I finally did it, he also replied with love songs that pretty much answered what I had sent. For example, i sent him ‚ÄúIf I fell‚Äù by the Beatles, and he replied with ‚ÄúGod only knows‚Äù by the Beach Boys).

So fast forward to February 14th, when he entered a Vipassana meditation retreat he had booked back in 2024. I knew we would be in no contact for 10 days and it would be hard, but I continued to send him texts when something reminded me of him or something like that, knowing he‚Äôd read them when he got out. When he went out of the retreat, he texted me and replied to my texts, and said he felt really tired but we could sext later (I had mentioned in my texts that I was very horny and wished we could sext soon.). But over the next couple of days, he continued saying that he was very depressed and had a lot of trouble adjusting to ‚Äúnormal life‚Äù. He showed me the email he sent to the people in the retreat asking for help. I was very supportive and I suggested he talked to someone and he said he‚Äôd talk to his sister who is a counsellor. He finally did, and he said that he felt a lot better and that his mind was more at peace. 

Fast forward to three days ago. He texts that one of the reasons that was causing his anxiety was how I felt about ‚Äúbeing friends and lovers‚Äù and that he didn‚Äôt want to hurt me by not being that emotionally available. I was stunned. I know we haven‚Äôt had a talk about where this was going but this felt completely out of the blue and out of character from what I‚Äôve been getting from him.

Please help me relieve my anxiety.

So, I ordered an item from a reputable company from Italy to be sent to the UK, it's worth ¬£1000. The company used UPS to send the item to the UK. Parcel went through the whole process, from hub to hub, to customs, to the depot, etc, nothing out of the ordinary.

Drive came yesterday to drop the parcel off, only for me to see that it's clearly not the product I ordered, I was expecting a much bigger and heavier box. But the box the driver handed to me clearly is not the item I bought, it's in a book sized, less than 5kg box. FYI, im expecting a small coffee table sized box and at least between 15kg - 20kg in weight.

I took photos of the parcel, and handed the parcel back to the driver, and refused delivery and for the item to be sent back to the company who sent it.

was this my best move? should've I kept the box and reported its wrong? It seems like UPS/or maybe somebody else stole the item then replaced it with something else and stuck the original postage stickers on it.

somebody told me that I should've kept the parcel and reported its not the item I ordered, some said I did the correct thing by refusing it. and now im anxious as heck...

thank you

edit: just to add, I contacted UPS already and they told me to contact the sender, I contacted the sender but now they're confused why I refused the delivery, I did explain the situation though. Maybe im just overthinking this and being impatient... so apologies..",1,1741096251.0,UPS,2,1.0,False

It was a mutual decision, but more from his part. We had gone to therapy, and it became clear that he wasn‚Äôt willing to work on our issues or see a future together. That realization crushed me because I truly believed we could fix things.

It has now been almost three weeks since the breakup, and we are still living together because I need to find a new apartment. I‚Äôm moving out in two weeks when my new lease starts. In the meantime, he‚Äôs been coming home late and saying that he‚Äôs feeling better. I‚Äôve been trying to process everything, but it has been hard living under the same roof.

This weekend, he went out and forgot his phone on the table. I was sitting there drinking coffee when I noticed it buzzing constantly. At first, I thought it was his work phone, but then I saw messages popping up from three different women. That already felt strange, especially on a weekend. Out of curiosity, I scrolled through the notifications and saw messages from Tinder, Hinge, and Bumble. I couldn‚Äôt read them because his phone was locked, and honestly, I wouldn‚Äôt have wanted to. But just knowing that he was already actively dating while I was still in the process of moving out was a punch in the gut. He couldn‚Äôt even wait.

Then today, he told me he wouldn‚Äôt be sleeping at home (he‚Äôs been sleeping on the couch since the breakup). It‚Äôs been three weeks, and this is how he treats someone he was with for four years? And after all the bla bla bla about ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll always be an important person to me‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôll always be there for you if you need anything.‚Äù

\- make references about something that the crowd possibly can't connect with! Either a super obscure show or something that totally doesn't translate well to the crowd (like university student jokes told to people in their mid fourties). Or in general being extremely unrelatable 

\- dropping ALL the basics like putting in way to many saves or asking the people for five minutes how they are actually going! 

\- degrading the audience too - like ""oh yeah that joke was just too smart for you"" type beat. Also mabye into the direction of ""oh okay all of you are just stuck up, huh?""

\- constantly looking at notes and leaving LOADS of dead space in between some sentences 

\- just totally trailing of once or twice without ever hitting some punchline ""so uh yea..... coffee shops ;D""

\- only telling a story. No punchline, nothing. Just an anecdote!

# Introduction: Why Coffee is a Popular Daily Beverage

Coffee is more than just a morning ritual‚Äîit is a powerhouse of antioxidants, essential nutrients, and bioactive compounds that influence overall health. Millions of people rely on coffee for its stimulating effects, but recent research suggests it does much more than just wake you up.

¬†

# The Nutritional Profile of Coffee

Coffee is rich in several beneficial compounds, including:

‚úÖ **Antioxidants**¬†‚Äì Helps fight oxidative stress and inflammation.‚úÖ **Caffeine**¬†‚Äì Improves focus, alertness, and energy levels.‚úÖ **Chlorogenic Acids**¬†‚Äì Aids in fat metabolism and weight loss.‚úÖ **Vitamins & Minerals**¬†‚Äì Contains small amounts of B vitamins, potassium, and magnesium.

¬†

# Health Benefits of Drinking Coffee Daily

# 1. Rich in Antioxidants and Nutrients

Coffee is one of the largest sources of antioxidants in the modern diet. These compounds help protect the body from free radical damage, reducing the risk of chronic diseases.

# 2. Boosts Brain Function and Mental Alertness

Caffeine, the primary active ingredient in coffee, blocks adenosine (a neurotransmitter that makes you feel tired) and increases dopamine and norepinephrine levels. This leads to improved focus, reaction times, and cognitive function.

# 3. Supports Heart Health and Blood Circulation

Studies show that moderate coffee consumption can reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke. Coffee helps improve blood vessel function and circulation, which benefits cardiovascular health.

# 4. Aids in Weight Loss and Metabolism

Caffeine stimulates thermogenesis, helping the body burn fat more efficiently. Many weight loss supplements include caffeine for its metabolism-boosting effects.

# 5. Protects Against Neurodegenerative Diseases

Research suggests that drinking coffee may lower the risk of Alzheimer‚Äôs and Parkinson‚Äôs disease by up to 65%. The neuroprotective effects come from its antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties.

# 6. Enhances Liver Health and Detoxification

Coffee has been linked to a reduced risk of liver diseases, including cirrhosis and liver cancer. It helps lower liver enzyme levels, supporting detoxification.

# 7. Reduces the Risk of Type 2 Diabetes

Several studies indicate that coffee drinkers have a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Coffee improves insulin sensitivity and regulates blood sugar levels.

# 8. Lowers the Risk of Certain Cancers

Coffee contains polyphenols and other compounds that may protect against liver, colorectal, and prostate cancers.

# 9. Improves Mood and Reduces Depression Risk

Coffee‚Äôs ability to increase dopamine levels contributes to better mood and a lower risk of depression.

# 10. Increases Longevity and Lifespan

Regular coffee consumption has been associated with a lower risk of premature death, thanks to its wide range of health benefits.

¬†

# Potential Risks of Drinking Coffee Daily

While coffee offers many benefits, excessive consumption can lead to:‚ùå **Increased Anxiety and Jitters**¬†(especially for those sensitive to caffeine)‚ùå **Sleep Disturbances**¬†(if consumed too late in the day)‚ùå **Digestive Issues**¬†(such as acid reflux in some individuals)

Experts recommend limiting intake to **3-4 cups per day**¬†for maximum benefits with minimal risks.

I have a Facebook page with close to 7k followers that got suspended suddenly and without prior notice a few days before its 1st anniversary.

It's is dedicated to geopolitics, defense, security and armed conflicts monitoring.  
Page Status shows **""Good news: no violations to show""** and **""Account status: No restrictions"".**

  
It was first suspended on Feb 26, 2025. Shortly after I requested a review of the decision and Facebook **restored my page two days later** ‚Äì on Feb 28, 2025.

However, on Mar 2, 2025 they **suspended my page again**, this time without giving me the option to appeal.

In both cases the reason stated is ""This goes against our Community Standards on **cybersecurity**."".

  
I've never made any attempts to use phishing tactics or steal someone's data.

The content consisted entirely of **news and analysis**. At the end of every post I **shared links to my page ""Buy Me A Coffee"" and ""Revolut""** links in order to let my followers to support my work if they want to. That's the only reason I can think of that may have triggered Facebook moderation algorithm.

  
I've lost thousands hours of work and would very much appreciate if you point me in the right directions and help me restore the page.

Are there any 3rd party case management platforms such as [https://portal.appealscentre.eu](https://portal.appealscentre.eu) that DO cover cubersecurity issues? If nothing else works, I may take the time to try something like that.

Failed relationships, career flops, that time I accidentally called my boss ‚ÄúMom‚Äù‚Ä¶ My brain was a Netflix algorithm of shame, recommending ‚ÄùRemember That Time You Ruined Everything?‚Äù on repeat.  

Then one day, I spilled coffee on my laptop and cried for 45 minutes. Not because of the laptop‚Äîbecause it felt like the universe was saying, ‚ÄúYeah, you‚Äôre a disaster. Here‚Äôs another L.‚Äù  

That‚Äôs when my roommate, who‚Äôs basically a human Golden Retriever, said: ‚ÄúDude, why don‚Äôt you just‚Ä¶ forgive yourself? Like, you‚Äôre not a war criminal.‚Äù  

I scoffed. But later, I Googled: ‚ÄúHow to stop hating yourself without therapy.‚Äù The top result? ‚ÄúBury your guilt. Literally.‚Äù  

So, I tried a Guilt Funeral. Here‚Äôs how it went down:  
1. Step 1: I wrote down every mistake I couldn‚Äôt let go of.  
2. Step 2: I grabbed a shovel and buried the list in my backyard at 2 a.m. (Yes, my neighbors think I‚Äôm a serial killer.)  
3. Step 3: I gave a eulogy: ‚ÄúYou were a real piece of work, Past Me. But rest in piss.‚Äù  

At first, it felt like performative nonsense. But over the next few weeks, I stopped flinching when my phone buzzed, joked about my cringey TikTok, and even texted my ghosted friend: ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm sorry. Wanna get tacos?‚Äù (Spoiler: We got tacos.)  

What I learned: Self-forgiveness isn‚Äôt a feeling‚Äîit‚Äôs an action. You don‚Äôt have to ‚Äúdeserve‚Äù it. You just have to do something stupid-symbolic to prove to your brain that the past isn‚Äôt a life sentence.  

If you‚Äôre holding a grudge against yourself, try this:  
1. Write down ONE thing you‚Äôre clinging to.  
2. Burn it, bury it, or flush it (RIP goldfish funeral).  
3. Do something dumb to celebrate‚Äîeat cake for breakfast, buy a whoopee cushion, whatever.

I‚Äôm developing a business that brings fresh coffee, sandwiches, wraps, and pastries (such as scones, cake pops, croissants, pies, and cinnamon rolls) directly to office parks like Emerald Hill and embassies in Harare. My plan is to operate between **9:30 AM and 11:30 AM** in high-foot-traffic areas, catering to professionals looking for a quick breakfast or mid-morning snack. After that, I would relocate to a different location and operate until **3:30 PM**, targeting the lunch and early afternoon coffee crowd.

To better understand the market, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts:

**Coffee Culture:** How often do Zimbabweans drink specialty coffee (lattes, espresso, mochas, cold brew, cortado, iced coffee, etc.)? Is coffee a daily habit or an occasional indulgence?

**Spending Habits:** Would you realistically spend **$3 on a coffee and sandwich** during work hours, knowing that you might need to budget for lunch later?

**Convenience & Availability:** If a coffee and snack cart were within your office park or work area, how likely would you be to purchase from it instead of going elsewhere?

**Timing Preferences:** What time do you typically take a coffee break or grab a snack? Would morning (9:30-11:30 AM) or early afternoon (12:00-3:30 PM) be more convenient?

**Product Preferences:** What types of coffee and food items do you prefer? Would you be interested in **healthier options** like whole-grain wraps or low-sugar pastries?

**Loyalty & Frequency:** Would you buy from the same coffee vendor regularly if the quality and pricing were good? Would a **loyalty program** (e.g., buy 4 coffees, get 1 free) encourage repeat business?

Going all the way to 150 just means the system needed more data to confirm you were above the passing standard, not that you were on the edge of failing. It‚Äôs common to feel unsure after hitting the maximum  150 especially since the test can feel brutal with its mixture of hard and tricky questions.

I conquered the NCLEX at the maximum 150 questions. It‚Äôs a testament to grit, perseverance, and the sweet relief of victory I celebrate today. I was a  determined nursing student who‚Äôd spent two years juggling clinicals, late-night study sessions, and a part-time job. When NCLEX day arrived in late 2024 I walked into the testing center with a mix of nerves and hope, armed with months of preparation using tools like Naxlex Qbank, Saunders, and mark K audios. Test day arrived,and I felt ready, but the NCLEX exam had other plans. Question after question, the difficulty seemed relentless; priority questions, SATA, obscure pharmacology, I sware it wasn't in my books. By question 85, I hoped for the screen to go blank but it kept going. At 100, my palms were sweaty. Then 130. By the time it hit 150, my heart was pounding, and the screen finally blinked off. I left feeling drained, convinced i failed because it went the full distance.

For two agonizing days, I replayed every question I could remember, second-guessing my answers on electrolyte imbalances and delegation tasks. I heard the myths: ‚ÄúIf it goes to 150, you‚Äôre borderline.‚Äù But i also knew the NCLEX was adaptive, not a death sentence.Unable to wait for  official results, i tried the Pearson Vue trick; I entered my credit card information and it wouldn‚Äôt process. A glimmer of hope.

After several days my mail results popped up: PASS. I had done it. At 150 questions, the system had tested my limit and confirmed i was above the passing standard. I aced it‚Äînot by luck, but by proving my competence across every tough SATA and critical-thinking curveball thrown my way. My first call was to my mom, tears streaming, followed by a celebratory coffee run with my study group, who were rooting for me.

Looking back, I say going to 150 wasn‚Äôt a sign of weakness‚Äîit was proof of my resilience. My fellow don‚Äôt fear the maximum. It‚Äôs just the test making sure you‚Äôre ready.

Who else felt the questions got tougher as you went along, who else did 150 questions and passed? Was it a rollercoaster of emotions when you went up to 150?",2,1741094619.0,NCLEXsuccessStories,1,1.0,False

Failed relationships, career flops, that time I accidentally called my boss ‚ÄúMom‚Äù‚Ä¶ My brain was a Netflix algorithm of shame, recommending ‚ÄùRemember That Time You Ruined Everything?‚Äù on repeat.  

Then one day, I spilled coffee on my laptop and cried for 45 minutes. Not because of the laptop‚Äîbecause it felt like the universe was saying, ‚ÄúYeah, you‚Äôre a disaster. Here‚Äôs another L.‚Äù  

That‚Äôs when my roommate, who‚Äôs basically a human Golden Retriever, said: ‚ÄúDude, why don‚Äôt you just‚Ä¶ forgive yourself? Like, you‚Äôre not a war criminal.‚Äù  

I scoffed. But later, I Googled: ‚ÄúHow to stop hating yourself without therapy.‚Äù The top result? ‚ÄúBury your guilt. Literally.‚Äù  

So, I tried a Guilt Funeral. Here‚Äôs how it went down:  
1. Step 1: I wrote down every mistake I couldn‚Äôt let go of.  
2. Step 2: I grabbed a shovel and buried the list in my backyard at 2 a.m. (Yes, my neighbors think I‚Äôm a serial killer.)  
3. Step 3: I gave a eulogy: ‚ÄúYou were a real piece of work, Past Me. But rest in piss.‚Äù  

At first, it felt like performative nonsense. But over the next few weeks, I stopped flinching when my phone buzzed, joked about my cringey TikTok, and even texted my ghosted friend: ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm sorry. Wanna get tacos?‚Äù (Spoiler: We got tacos.)  

What I learned: Self-forgiveness isn‚Äôt a feeling‚Äîit‚Äôs an action. You don‚Äôt have to ‚Äúdeserve‚Äù it. You just have to do something stupid-symbolic to prove to your brain that the past isn‚Äôt a life sentence.  

If you‚Äôre holding a grudge against yourself, try this:  
1. Write down ONE thing you‚Äôre clinging to.  
2. Burn it, bury it, or flush it (RIP goldfish funeral).  
3. Do something dumb to celebrate‚Äîeat cake for breakfast, buy a whoopee cushion, whatever.

My (ex) boyfriend and I broke up at the beginning of February after four years together. It was a mutual decision, but it was coming more from his part. We had gone to therapy, and it became clear that he wasn‚Äôt willing to work on our issues or see a future together. That realization crushed me because I truly believed we could fix things.

It has now been almost three weeks since the breakup, and we are still living together because I need to find a new apartment. I‚Äôm moving out in two weeks when my new lease starts. In the meantime, he‚Äôs been coming home late and saying that he‚Äôs feeling better. I‚Äôve been trying to process everything, but it has been hard living under the same roof.

This weekend, he went out and forgot his phone on the table. I was sitting there drinking coffee when I noticed it buzzing constantly. At first, I thought it was his work phone, but then I saw messages popping up from three different women. That already felt strange, especially on a weekend. Out of curiosity, I scrolled through the notifications and saw messages from Tinder, Hinge, and Bumble. I couldn‚Äôt read them because his phone was locked, and honestly, I wouldn‚Äôt have wanted to. But just knowing that he was already actively dating while I was still in the process of moving out was a punch in the gut. He couldn‚Äôt even wait.

Then today, he told me he wouldn‚Äôt be sleeping at home (he‚Äôs been sleeping on the couch since the breakup). It‚Äôs been three weeks, and this is how he treats someone he was with for four years? And after all the bla bla bla about ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll always be an important person to me‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôll always be there for you if you need anything.‚Äù

And now it's asking me to rate my own replacement. That's the kind of sardonic twist many startups are waking up to these days. While AI is often hailed as the harbinger of innovation, for some fledgling companies, it's increasingly resembling the grim reaper.

### The Digital Guillotine

The speed at which AI can develop and automate tasks is astounding‚Äîand slightly terrifying. In industries ranging from healthcare to tech support, startups that once stood as pioneers in niche fields are finding themselves outpaced and outgrown by AI counterparts who neither tire nor require coffee breaks.

**When AI Strikes:**
- **Legal Services:** AI tools can review and even draft complex legal documents faster than a roomful of junior associates.
- **Customer Service:** Chatbots are overtaking human agents, offering 24/7 service without the human error margin.
- **Data Analysis:** Let's face it, AI crunches numbers and identifies trends in seconds‚Äîtasks that might take a human hours or even days.

### Is AI the Startups' Kryptonite or Catalyst?

Here's the paradox‚ÄîAI doesn't just close doors; it opens many. Some startups are thriving precisely because they're leveraging AI, not fighting it. They integrate AI into their services, enhancing efficiency, accuracy, and innovation potential. But it's a tightrope walk, balancing what's essentially robot collaboration without being subsumed in the process.

**Survival Tips for Startups:**
- **Adaptation:** Embrace change. Incorporate AI into your processes instead of viewing it as competition.
- **Niche Specialization:** Focus on hyper-specialized areas where human creativity and intuition trump AI's analytical prowess.
- **Human Touch:** Maintain a personal customer experience‚Äîsomething AI has yet to fully integrate.

### The Dystopian Delight

Despite its lethal efficiency, there's an irony in how AI's rise sometimes feels like dark comedy. Picture a startup founder, who‚Äôs spent the last five years building a product, watching as an AI snaps its digital fingers to outwit them overnight. It's like a tech noir film, only you're living it.

### Let's Discuss

First and most likely last attempt at a dry martini.  I followed the recipe in the post linked below (5:1 gin:vermouth).  

My partner and I are still discovering our preferences, but we both agree that the more spirit forward drinks aren‚Äôt quite our thing.  We have a good list going though with only a few disagreements. For example, she loves tonic water drinks but to me the quinine is unpalatable (which is strange because I like bitter things, like black coffee and licorice). 

For what it‚Äôs worth, I really enjoyed the Carpano Dry by itself.  Same thing with the Antico.  I also have a bottle of the Bianco to try, but only after the liter of the Dry is gone.

I'm a 40-year-old IT professional working in one of the largest entertainment companies globally, and I'm ready to embark on another exciting age gap journey. Standing tall at 6'4, with a stable financial background and an adorable dog by my side, life's been treating me well. Despite never tying the knot or having children, I've found meaningful connections in age gap relationships, with my last two lasting a solid 4.5 years.

Now, I'm not entirely sure what I'm seeking, but one thing's for sure: I'm not interested in anything casual. I've got over a decade of experience being a ""daddy"" and dating younger women, and I'm hoping to find someone special again.

I don‚Äôt do much in the evenings, and I could use the extra cash. 

‚ÄúGet Nadia to show you round the play centre before you leave today,‚Äù said Craig.

Nadia‚Äôs my coworker. The soft play centre is her patch. Most jobs at the Leisure centre take two, maybe three hours at most, but Nadia rarely got away before ten each night. 

My tongue was already in knots. ‚ÄúSorry‚Äìwould it be ok if I got here for, like, 5pm?‚Äù

He gave a smiling nod. ‚ÄúNadia doesn‚Äôt usually start the clean ‚Äòtil six.‚Äù

I thanked him again. Good manners make up for all the times I‚Äôd taken his instructions way too literally. Craig‚Äôs been much more tolerant with me than other bosses. His slow, plodding steps and thick Blackpool accent made it hard to feel afraid of him.

‚ÄúSee how you like it,‚Äù  he fell in step beside me as I continued down the corridor to find my colleague. I thought he was making a joke, and tried a laugh. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm probably a bit old for soft play.‚Äù

He laughed. ‚ÄúNo, I meant the cleaning shift.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh‚Äìof course.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very different job from cleaning the gym. But if you like it, you could maybe take these hours on for good.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs Nadia leaving?‚Äù 

Craig gave a slow shrug. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs off on holiday this week‚Ä¶ we‚Äôll see what happens after that. Thanks, sweetheart.‚Äù

 I liked Nadia. We didn‚Äôt know each other that well, but I‚Äôd only ever had kindly smiles from her and she never seemed annoyed when I asked for help. What‚Äôs more, I always thought that she kind of looked like Mary from Silent Hill (!) Eventually I found her in the cleaning cupboard, twirling her earphones round her finger. 

‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù 

At the sound of my voice, she let out a stifled gasp. 

I smiled an apology. ‚ÄúI should have knocked.‚Äù


She stared at me, wide-eyed, for a second or so, waiting for her brain to process whose face she was looking at. ‚ÄúOh,‚Äù she laid her hand on my arm. ‚ÄúSorry, honey, sorry.‚Äù

‚ÄúN-no worries. Um‚ÄìCraig says you‚Äôre off, tomorrow?‚Äù

She nodded. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm c-covering your shifts this week,‚Äù I continued, ‚Äú...just wondered if you had a second to show me how you clean the soft play sometime this morning?‚Äù

Nadia looked at me in silence for a minute. It made me feel a little awkward. Had I offended her? ‚ÄúCraig asked you to cover me?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I smiled. Her eyes grew wider. I felt myself wilt. I guessed she thought I wasn‚Äôt competent (but was too nice to admit it.)

‚ÄúUh-huh.‚Äù She shook her head, and stuck her phone back in her pocket, leaving the earphones trailing. Ushering me out, she smiled hard. ‚ÄúI start upstairs.‚Äù

The experience of that first walk-around was one of nostalgia. The faded walls, the gaudy illustrations of cartoon animals, and the playful shadows cast by snaking slides and sprawling ball pits were precisely as I remembered them. The sickly smell of birthday cake and vomit inspired in me a wave of memories. As we plodded round the parent‚Äôs cafe, I could almost see Mum sipping tea at the corner table, like some disconsolate prisoner. I felt my brother‚Äôs spirit running to the rope swing that dangled barely half a foot from the cushioned floor. Even the squeak of Nadia‚Äôs trainers against the spongy green floor was tinged with childhood. I remembered every lonely moment, playing by myself at the back while the other kids giggled behind me. 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mop everyday,‚Äù Nadia‚Äôs voice brought me back from reverie. 

‚ÄúOh. That‚Äôs good.‚Äù

‚ÄúOnly once or twice a week. Or when someone‚Äôs spilled juice.‚Äù

I was glad to hear it. At the back of the soft play, the dimly lit corridors wound left and right without any discernible pattern. We passed a solitary waste bin. Shaped like an anthropomorphic beetle, its sordid smile betrayed ten years‚Äô grime. ‚ÄúWe‚Ä¶change the bins too, right?‚Äù I asked, when the silence had lasted a little too long between us.

‚ÄúIf you want,‚Äù Nadia turned to me. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not technically meant to start clean-down until 6pm. But I try and sneak in here at 5. That way I‚Äôm not here after dark.‚Äù

‚ÄúI imagine it‚Äôs a bit spooky after dark, back here‚Äì‚Äù

I meant it as a joke, but Nadia took me seriously. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to stay the whole three hours, you know.‚Äù

Her heavy tone caught me off guard. But as I studied her face, I saw her features bore a strange, almost protective quality. ‚ÄúJust make sure you don‚Äôt hang around if you don‚Äôt need to. You‚Ä¶it doesn‚Äôt take a whole three hours. And if you feel weird about being here alone, just lock up and get out. Ok?‚Äù

I was touched. ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù

She held my gaze. It was as though she wanted me to say something more, but I couldn‚Äôt think of anything to say that wouldn‚Äôt sound contrived. ‚ÄúStill,‚Äù she added, at last. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt put yourself at risk. It‚Äôs not worth it.‚Äù

My first shift was that night. I got to the sports centre just before 5 and got a redbull from the vending machine. Before I went any further, I pulled my earphones carefully over my head. The long, strip-lit corridor has that hard, vinyl flooring that makes footsteps offensively loud. I pattered past the disused lockers and the old squash courts, until I reached the door emblazoned:

TunnelWig Play Centre

I swiped my card and opened the door. As it was nearly closing, a handful of kids were visible through the rope mesh that separated the play centre from the parents‚Äô cafe. A tired looking young woman called her child from one of the tables as the supervisor appeared behind the counter. She was tall and blonde; maybe 28, or 29 years old, and very pretty. ‚ÄúHey,‚Äù she flashed me a sunny smile. 

‚ÄúHello,‚Äù I mumbled. ‚ÄúAm‚Ä¶I too early to get started?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Nadia?‚Äù 

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs on holiday.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh‚Äìyou‚Äôre covering?‚Äù

‚ÄúUh-huh,‚Äù the sound of my voice was egregious to me. 

She nodded over to the cafe. ‚ÄúWould you mind getting started over there, please? Someone‚Äôs just wee-weed on the floor.‚Äù

My attraction to her died that instant. I filled my bucket full of lemon soap and hot water, before dragging it over to the pool of ‚Äúwee-wee‚Äù (!) I finished up the floor and got started in the cafe; sweeping crumbs off tables, wiping down chairs, before running the shitty Henry-Hoover over the sticky floor. 

It was nearly half eight when I got done, and all the play centre staff had left. I sighed. I was so tired, and the constant smell of nappies grated on my senses. Waiting for me upstairs was the wreckage of a birthday party. Garish cellophane and dishevelled party hats were strewn over the floor. I crouched down and crawled inside the jungle gym itself. Cake crumbs and sticky fingerprints were smeared across the interlocking foam flooring and walls. I cleared as much as I could, before shuffling back out of the cramped tunnel to empty the pan. 

It takes a lot to gross me out these days. What I noticed in the pan didn‚Äôt gross me out as such, but gave me pause. Amidst the party crumbs was a single strand of human hair. There‚Äôs nothing abnormal in that; kids pull each other‚Äôs hair out all the time. The weird thing is that this hair was silver. 

Wrinkling my nose, I lowered the dustpan into the cafe bin. Someone‚Äôs grandma must have followed their grandchild into the squishy tunnel and got stuck. Maybe they had smuggled in some red wine to pass the time, while their infant threw themselves at other kids and into ball pits for hours. It must have been a very small old lady who could fit in there. 

Once the crumbs were clear, I shuffled back out of the tunnel. It wasn‚Äôt easy; even at five foot five, I was too long for the environment and ended up back-crawling out of the warren like a fat badger. The soft play‚Äôs cushions were warm to the touch, but it was freezing in the cafe area. I pulled my jacket closer over my uniform. If the janitors had turned the central heating off, I was probably the only person left onsite. I never thought I cared about working late, but the idea of the empty swimming pools and miles of deserted corridors gave me a creepy feeling. I‚Äôd never been at the Leisure centre this late before. Maybe that‚Äôs why my soul left my body when I caught sight of a leering face out of the corner of my eyes. 

It was, of course, only the beetle-bin; its plastic mouth  incapable of anything more than a shit-eating grin. Laughing, I sauntered over to it and produced another cloth from my pocket. I sprayed the synthetic cheek with blue window cleaning fluid and scrubbed coffee spots off the white cast teeth. 

‚ÄúWhy would they put this in a kids‚Äô play centre?‚Äù Don‚Äôt get me wrong; the hideous, sordid creature was probably charming when it was new. In its present state, only Russ McKamey would choose it for furniture. The sleazy effect was not helped by the slogan slapped on the wall above in yellow bubble-writing: Can you find the tunnel Wig?

I fucking hope not. I finished polishing the bin, and reached to unscrew its grey head. I carefully held my breath as I ducked close to its mouth to prevent the damp, rotten smell of the rubbish from invading my senses. It did not. 

I jumped back from the beetle-bin. Its many limbs were fixed in a perpetual shrug. You get used to freaky stenches when you clean for a living, but this smell was different. Think sickly-sweet birthday cake frosting, mixed with banana peels and those button mushrooms that languish at the bottom of the vegetable draw. Think mould furring on apples, or a halloween pumpkin left out in the rain until January. 

What the hell were they putting in there? I peered at the bin with renewed caution. It probably hadn‚Äôt been changed in months. I double-gloved my hands and craned my neck back as I reached forward to carefully unscrew the beetle‚Äôs head. Had someone brought their hamster in, only for it to escape and die at the bottom of the barrel? It smelled too sweet to be a carcass, but as I inched closer and closer to the beetle-bin, I reconsidered. Sweaty hands closed round suppurating peaches. A stomach distended from a manic binge. The devil‚Äôs smoothie. It actually made my head swim as I placed my hands on the Beetle‚Äôs smiling cheeks and slowly unscrewed the top. 

The black plastic rustled, and a waft of death assaulted my senses. I turned my nose away, pressed my lips together and coiled the bin bag closed around my finger. Slowly, I lifted it, only to find that the liner was stuck to the bin‚Äôs bottom. Whatever was making the unholy smell had leaked through the plastic and solidified. 

‚ÄúOh God,‚Äù I gingerly shook the bin to loosen it, to no avail. No wonder Nadia never changes it, I thought, they should just chuck this in a skip. It was too far behind the cafe area to get proper use anyway, yet I could not (in good conscience) neglect my duties by leaving the spoiled bag in situ. Kids use this space. Whatever was in the bag, it wasn‚Äôt safe. Besides, I didn‚Äôt want Nadia to think I had half-arsed it (or Craig, for that matter.)

‚ÄúCome on, come on,‚Äù I whispered, half to the beetle and half to myself. That was when I felt it: a sharp, piercing stinging on the back of my clenched palm. It was acute, like a dog bite, but as I pulled my hand away with a cry, it oozed until my whole hand throbbed.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck?!‚Äù I staggered back, pressing hard on my hand that shrieked in pain. I lifted my fingers for a second to see if my skin was broken. I turned my hand over, then back again, looking for a welt or a cut. Not only was there no blood‚Äìbut there was no mark to be seen at all. Worse still was the feeling that succeeded; a cold, prickly realisation, like sweat breaking on my brow, that I was not alone. 

My nerve broke like a twig beneath my feet. I kicked the hoover back into the cleaning cupboard. grabbed my cleaning caddy and hared out of there. I thundered down the stairs and back into the reception bay, before jamming the key code in and throwing back the door. I didn‚Äôt stop running until I got to the cloakroom. Just as I pulled my bag over my shoulder, I realised how absurd the whole thing was. I stood there, panting, and checking my hand over again. Nothing. 
I sighed, and trudged back to reception to clock out. I scribbled something down in the incident book. If there was some kind of biting-bug infestation in the beetle-bin, there was no way the play centre was fit for public use. Perhaps the closing mechanism on the lid was rusted and my hand had caught on the hinge. That explained it. The stench‚Ä¶well, that would be gone as soon as the janitor team saw my note in the maintenance book. They‚Äôd just cart the bin off and hurl it in the landfill, where it belonged. As for the creepy feeling? That was me, I thought, just being a scaredy little bitch. 

These explanations are so rational that I can almost bring myself to believe them. Thing is, I‚Äôm on the bus to work now to start the next shift. Has anyone got any idea what might be in that beetle-bin that stinks so horribly? Ideally I don‚Äôt want to hear suggestions about severed limbs or dead kids. I‚Äôd feel a lot better if I knew what to tell the janitors so they take it away asap. If anyone‚Äôs come across anything like this before, please let me know if you can. 

Thanks for reading. Once again, sorry for any typos. I‚Äôm writing this on my phone. I‚Äôll post an update tomorrow sometime if anything else weird happens.

Also we went together for Coffee at CCD, where me met alumni's of IIT Kanpur ( 1980 passout batch) and had some fun and engaging chit chat with them. We really enjoyed talking as a group and discussing personal struggles wrt college conversion. After 1 hour or so with fun, we decided to move on with our own journeys.
We male guys had already shared our numbers and have contact details, but since me and the girl which was with us , since we two were native from Kanpur, she asked me if se could drop me to home as her dad was coming to pick her up anyway and I came by public transport. She with her father dropped me to my home and I am really thankful to them. 
In this whole moment after okayish GDPI, I really enjoyed talking with her as she was very jolly and cheerful. But I even didn't thought of taking her number or even know her full name or any other details.
I just know her first name , her school (Jaipuria) and her working domain ( it's in marketing in Bengaluru).

I hope she sees this on reddit and can connect for simple and happy friendship. May we both get this college atleast and I wish her best for her upcoming IIT Madras interview. And also to my 2 Bhailog whom I met ...üôÇüôÇ

Please help! - first time poster so apologies if this is in the wrong subreddit/flair.

I‚Äôm (30M) and have just started a new job around about a week ago. After 3 interviews and supposedly over 700 applicants I was told YOU HAVE THE JOB! (woohoo - so I thought).

I have resigned from a previous role and financially taken a large step back to join a company which promises it will make a very comfortable income for its employees and from what I have seen some of the employees do.  (The industry is finance).

The problem is, upon arrival on my first day I was basically shown the bathrooms, the fresh water and the meeting room where training would commence. 

In the time I have been there and supposedly ‚Äútraining‚Äù, the trainer has not been training us but rather taking her own leads, dealing with clients and closing deals. (Settling some too!). During this time, there‚Äôs been about 1-1.5 hours of training a day. This is all rushed through and basically get the *RAISES VOICE* ‚Äúsorry no questions we mentioned this yesterday - got it, good‚Äù type of deal.

Another example - today while they took a phone call they did ask for us to log the call in our notes so we can recap with her post call. I did this to which she read my notes shrugged and said good. I said thanks - I am not really used to typing it out I‚Äôm more of a pen and paper guy. I was told ‚Äúthis is a red flag, we have had people do the same and they do not succeed or they leave very quickly‚Äù I simply replied with ‚Äúif you stir a coffee clock wise or counter clockwise you achieve the same result‚Äù this didn‚Äôt go down too well but at this stage I was relatively frustrated as were other trainees.

I have tried to give the signals of I‚Äôm bored - I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm supposed to be doing because there is literally no sheets to learn off, no slideshows to go through, no modules, no licensing etc. 

Now the reason I took a step back financially was because this is an ‚Äúentry role‚Äù where I am meant to be trained and taught from the ground up what it is like to succeed at this role. What makes it tricky is there is no direct HR officer and if there is they are offshore (I think- unsure as have not been introduced to anyone). The other issue is the director seems particularly close with the trainer where they could potentially be related.

I am unsure if there is even HR as it‚Äôs a director and managers? (If there is, we weren‚Äôt introduced).

Essentially what I‚Äôm asking here is, what is the right way to approach this? As I have extremely cold feet and am thinking of leaving due to gut instincts, but would be gutted I‚Äôve thrown away a decent job for a role where I‚Äôve ‚Äúquit‚Äù not due to any lack of my own effort.

Level 1: Before the All-Nighter (Preparation Phase)

Do NOT start with coffee ‚Üí Caffeine too early = crash later.

Save it for 3-4 AM when you really really need it.

The ""Sleep Bank"" Trick ‚Üí If you know an all-nighter is coming, stop waiting for the crush's message and sleep early previous nights. A 90-minute nap before you start can also keep your brain from frying.

Chew Gum or Eat Crunchy Snacks ‚Üí Your brain associates chewing with wakefulness.

Best options: Apples (natural caffeine) Carrots (crunchy = alertness) Dark chocolate (tiny energy boost without a crash)



Level 2: Surviving the All-Nighter (The Right Way to Stay Up)

Light, Not Dark ‚Üí Studying in a dim room = instant sleep mode. Sit in bright white light to trick your brain into thinking it's daytime. That's why most of the offices offices are so lit up.

Cold Shower Instant Alertness ‚Üí If you're already exhausted, a 2-minute cold shower wakes up your nervous system better than coffee. No, you won't like it. Yes, it works.

Move Every 45 Minutes ‚Üí Sitting still for hours will guarantee sleepiness. Stand up, stretch, or do 10 jumping jacks every 45 minutes to keep your energy up.

Teach What You Just Learned If you can explain a topic out loud, you'll actually remember it. Bonus points if you use Insta Voiceovers (not kidding-our loves it).

Study Out Loud ‚Üí Reading in your head? Snooze. Reading out loud? Engaged. If you can't make noise, whispering works too



Level 3 !!!

Damage Control (How to Recover the Next Day)

Don't Sleep Immediately ‚Üí If you crash at 6 AM and wake up at 3 PM, your sleep cycle is done for. Instead, power through until 10 AM and take a 90-minute nap.

Hydrate Like Crazy ‚Üí Sleep deprivation dehydrates you. First thing in the morning: 500ml water + a pinch of salt or take sugar free readymade electrolytes drink Green tea or lemon water (natural energy boost)

Go Outside ASAP ‚Üí Sunlight = melatonin reset. The faster you expose yourself to natural light, the faster your brain adjusts back to normal.

Use the ""Coffee Nap"" Trick ‚Üí Drink coffee, then immediately nap for 20 minutes. By the time you wake up, the caffeine kicks in and you get a mini recharge.

Illuminate the room: 

I thought when I first started doing stand-up comedy, I didn't have to work hard on my jokes.

I could just go up on the stage and wing it.

And just my presence alone would illuminate the room. 

Everyone would say what a natural and comic genius I am.

It's kind of like when I was in college 
You need to do your homework 
Work hard 
Practice 

You can't just go into your tests and illuminate the test because you'll get an F on your assignment 

And when it comes to comedy, you'll get booed off stage...

Joke 2:
Double Standards - Attractive People:

Did you ever notice they're real double standards when it comes to attractive people and ugly people? 

I go to mental health recovery groups... 

I know it's hard to believe. 

I'm so mentally stable.

There'll be some 40 something year old 400 lb man who has suffered tremendously. He's been homeless - his life has been hell on Earth 

Then there'll be some attractive 20 something year old woman who looks like a model who suffered significantly less. 

But we tend to empathize with the attractive woman because she's cute.

I often see the social media models who are female say: What would you do if you came home and there I was in your room in just my underpants? And a lot of the men say this is my dream come true!

But if the 400 lbs 40-year-old schizophrenic was in your room in his underwear you'd probably call the cops and think you were just about to be assaulted.

I hate double standards.

When it comes to drinking alcohol men can't drink fruity drinks. Men can't wear short shorts. Because people will think you're a homosexual or light in the loafers. 

All in all, I want to go into people's bedrooms in just my underpants, damn it. 

But seriously, I'm aware you can't do that because you would quickly get taken to jail.

Joke 3:
You know you're depressed when:

You know you're depressed when... You walk into the supermarket And you see the scary looking maintenance worker who's working 9:00 am to 5:00 pm, 5 days a week, for minimum wage, who's cleaning fecal matter in the bathroom...

You see him like a dirtbag dribbling coffee all over himself while he's scrubbing shit and trash... And you're envious. You project onto the maintenance worker... this guy's life must be happier than mine. He's so cool and badass.

Even though I'm depressed and miserable, I'm sure My life is peaches and cream in comparison to this maintenance worker. So try not to be so sad.

And it's not just him. I'm probably happier than terminal cancer victims too.

You know you're depressed when... You consume coffee like it's water and eat sweets gluttonously. You realize it's probably giving you cancer. 

But you're like, screw it! what other pleasure do I have in my life? I'm going to do it anyway.

Maybe soon I'll be the most unhappy man ever.

but hypothetically if I did, how would I go on there? 

I'm going to start searching Google, how do you download the dark web app? Is it like a social media app? Just to to the app store?

That will probably get me on some watch list.

I want to play video games with Vladimir Putin on the dark web. It sounds like a lot of fun.

Somebody said You're a dumbass and really naive when it comes to the dark web. It's not like an app or a video game. 

I'm like, then what is the dark web...

They say, We can't tell you what it is.

They ask, who is they?

Obviously, I'm in referring to the voices in my head. I don't talk to anyone in real life.

I wonder are there any good uses for the dark web?

1j39ott,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChurchOfMineta/comments/1j39ott/the_influence_of_exaggeration_in_my_hero/,The Influence of Exaggeration in My Hero Academia's Characters,"Japanese theater, especially Kabuki, has a long history of prioritizing exaggeration in performance. This tradition influences many aspects of anime, including *My Hero Academia* (*BNHA*), where characters often exhibit highly exaggerated traits to enhance their archetypes. But what if these characters were toned down to a more realistic level? Here's a breakdown of how some key characters would change:

# Izuku Midoriya

Midoriya's exaggerated kindness and emotional reactions would be lessened, making him more composed and pragmatic. Without theatrical exaggeration, he would likely not continue associating with Bakugo after experiencing bullying, taking a more neutral stance. His intelligence and strategy-building would remain, but his relationships would form more organically rather than being driven by admiration. Ochaco‚Äôs feelings for him would develop subtly rather than fitting the ""protagonist's love interest"" mold.

# Katsuki Bakugo

Without his extreme anger and loud personality, Bakugo would still be intense, but more controlled. Instead of outright bullying Midoriya, he might have grown indifferent over time, seeing him as irrelevant. However, upon recognizing Midoriya's capabilities, he could develop a more natural rivalry based on respect rather than sheer aggression.

# Shoto Todoroki

Todoroki's reserved demeanor would remain, but without the theatrical aloofness, he would appear more like a withdrawn but approachable person rather than an emotionally distant one. His struggles with his father would still be present, but his interactions with classmates would be more fluid instead of feeling like a dramatic thawing arc.

# Tenya Iida

Iida‚Äôs robotic mannerisms would be toned down, making him less of a comedic figure. He would still be a rule follower, but instead of being an exaggeratedly righteous class representative, he would be more of an academic and slightly elitist student, prioritizing his future over friendships.

# Ochaco Uraraka

Without the exaggeration of being the ""sweet love interest,"" Ochaco‚Äôs attraction to Midoriya would develop more subtly. She wouldn‚Äôt be bound to the trope of the protagonist‚Äôs first love but rather have options. While still a kind and determined person, she would also be more pragmatic about relationships and her hero career.

# All Might

All Might is deeply influenced by the Tokusatsu style, where over-the-top poses and speeches are a staple. Without exaggeration, his hero persona would still be charismatic but in a way that feels more like a sports coach than a larger-than-life superhero. His influence on Midoriya would be more practical, focusing on technique rather than dramatic inspiration.

# Shouta Aizawa

Aizawa's sleep deprivation would be portrayed more realistically‚Äîhe wouldn‚Äôt constantly nap in class but would rely on heavy caffeine consumption, always carrying a thermos of coffee. His dry wit would still exist, but rather than being an overtly eccentric, sleep-deprived teacher, he would come across as a strict and pragmatic educator who keeps students at a professional distance.

# Himiko Toga

Toga‚Äôs obsession with blood and love would be more unsettling rather than playful. Instead of an exaggerated yandere persona, she would be a genuine stalker with dangerous romantic fixations. Her interest in Midoriya would still be present, but it would manifest in ways that feel more like psychological horror than comedic villainy.

# Toru Hagakure

Toru would likely be the ‚Äúhidden pervert‚Äù of the group, using her invisibility to sneak around undetected. Unlike Mineta, who is overtly perverse in the exaggerated version of the story, Toru would get away with her antics because no one would catch her in the act. Her cheerful personality would remain, but she would also have a mischievous streak that makes her interactions with classmates more layered.

# Minoru Mineta

Without exaggerated perversion, Mineta wouldn't act out in inappropriate ways. Instead, he would focus on developing charm and emotional intelligence to attract women. This version of Mineta would be more of a smooth talker with natural social awareness, using wit and understanding of people‚Äôs emotions to win them over rather than resorting to comedic gags. He would still be underestimated by others due to his height, but those who trusted him‚Äîlike Kaminari and Midoriya‚Äîwould benefit from his guidance. Despite his success in romance, he would remain a loyal and supportive friend, never sabotaging his friends' relationships but instead helping them navigate them.

# Conclusion

Theatrical exaggeration plays a major role in *BNHA*, shaping characters into larger-than-life figures. Without it, the series would feel less like a shonen anime and more like a grounded drama with nuanced character interactions. While some characters would still shine, their dynamics and relationships would unfold more organically, creating a more realistic but potentially less vibrant world.

On our last day here and I have some do‚Äôs and don‚Äôts 

Don‚Äôt accept an upgrade at the hotel unless you want to be forced to change rooms when they sell your upgraded room. We spent an entire day with a room change after unpacking our bags and settling in. At 11am on our 3rd day, we got a call saying that we needed to pack up and change rooms. After many many phone calls, I literally had to refuse to leave our room until the next room was ready. I sat in the room for 5 hours waiting for a room that was going to be ready in 45 mins. Otherwise, we would have had no room in the middle of our stay for hours. 

Don‚Äôt think Marriott will help you once you‚Äôre there no matter what level you are. We are Titanium, and contacted Marriott beforehand to make sure we would have no problems, trying to make sure we set up everything correctly. Oh, yes, everything will be great, we were assured. When they told us we had to pack up and move, we called and called and were finally told that Marriott has no ability to help you once you‚Äôre there. But they are happy to file a complaint and give you some points. Super. 

Don‚Äôt believe anything the hotel tells you before you arrive. I sent emails to several people at the hotel-including many who are the ones replying to bad reviews here with apologies. Once we got here, no one at the hotel would help us with anything and they denied having said what they had written back to us. 

I‚Äôm sure that when Serrgeo or Christian or Keisha respond to this review they will tell me how sorry they are. They do seem to be great at apologizing as they certainly have lots of experience doing that. 

Don‚Äôt believe anyone when they tell you that the next person, who comes on at 2pm, 9am or sometime on the second Tuesday of the week, will be able to resolve your problem. They either never arrive or they have no idea why the last person told you they could help. 

Don‚Äôt plan to sleep later than 6:30am because you have to race out and secure a place by the pool or you‚Äôre out of luck. Also, you have to make reservations for dinner on the app when it clicks on at 7am. But don‚Äôt count on the app. We never once were able to make a reservation. 

Don‚Äôt believe what anyone tells you about room service or housekeeping. If you need anything, and you will because the rooms are poorly stocked, you will wait hours and will have to call multiple times. Also, you have to wait in your room because they can‚Äôt come in without you there. 

Don‚Äôt expect a 5 star experience with the room. The rooms are definitely run down. We didn‚Äôt see any mold like others have mentioned, but they are shabby. 

Do expect that the staff will either be lovely and gracious or look at you like they want to kill you. They seemed to be very short staffed. Most of the staff just looked tired and angry. 

Do expect that the beach front, the pools and the common areas are very nice. It‚Äôs a beautiful spot. Have a few drinks or an edible by the ocean and you may forget what a sh*tshow the hotel is.

Do go to the gelato spot. They have fabulous coffee drinks. 

Do order multiple items from room service. One serving of bacon is one piece of bacon. One cheesecake is literally a tiny one bite piece. And do expect to wait. 

Do expect to spend much of your vacation trying to figure out the app. Even the front desk has no idea how the app works. If you‚Äôre lucky that one person who can figure it out for you will show up at some point, but count on eating at the international default buffet more than you wanted because the app doesn‚Äôt work and you can‚Äôt make reservations. 

Do count on a two hour drive from the airport. Do yourself a favor and book a nice car, otherwise it will be miserable. 

If after this, you still plan to book here, do give yourself credit for your boundless sense of adventure and your apparently admirable optimism that things might work out better for you. That‚Äôs why we booked inspite of the bad reviews and now we just want to go back home.

I've got a transgender date under my belt and it went well. My second however, made my Intuition scream: ""Get out of there!""

I was out ubering food late one night and when I was done I decided to try and hook up while I was in the city, away from my rural home. my attempts on grindr for a meet were unsuccessful. I wasn't quite ready to give up yet so I went to taimi, and started swiping. First swipe of the day was the lucky one, or so I had thought. 

At 4 am I get a few messages that go like this:

""Come chill""
""I'm bored""
""We can go with the flow and get to know each other""

""Number and home address; mckees rocks, Pittsburgh, PA""

It was unnervingly forward but I thought I'd take a chance, and texted the number: 

""Hey (name)""
""You still up?""

Her: ""Yeah come talk chill""

""Have you had/coffee breakfast yet?""

Her: ""Nope""


""Okay would you like to go get some?""

Her: Idk maybe 

""It's gonna be a 30 min drive, would you like to talk over the phone""

Her: ""Imma shower, after I will""

I get within 10 mins of the address and I get a text: 

Her: ""I need 15 more minutes, why don't you bring some something with you""

That's fine so far, but I didn't get to talk to them and get a sense for who they are, So I take my knife and carry it appendix style.

I circle around the block to scope and to find parking, preferably close incase I need to nope the fuck out of there. Some one had just parked on the street infront of the location and sat in their car. 

I wait it out a bit and they never get out. 

I then gain the courage to go to the door, mentally prepared for shit to go down. I knock, and the door opens. I didn't recognize the person who opened the door, but I told them who I'm here to see and they let me in, directing me to the door to my left. The guy then stands between me and the exit and says: 

 ""Come on man, wtf"".

As if on que another man enters the building and they go upstairs. I think this was the man who parked in the spot and never got out. 


There were 3 apartments in said building, hers, the 3rd, to the left as soon as you enter the main door, then one up some stairs facing the main door, and I didn't pay much mind at this point to where the last one was.

I knock on the 3rd apartment  to see my date, and she answers right away: I still need a few more minutes babe"" and shuts the door. I didn't get much more than a glimpse of her face in the process. 

Once she shut the door and I was in the hall alone, I heard 2-3 mens voices speaking to each other inaudibly as music dampened this secret conversation 

In that moment, my heart sank to my stomach, and it felt like I had to go before anyone noticed I'd left. I walked out and went straight to my car. 

I drove forward as I Watched a man in the street presumably from that house walk in my direction to see where I was going. I did a U turn as there was a ""no outlet"" sign only to find my original path blocked with an idle car, so I took a side street out of there. 

I pass a few lights then see the man that never left his car next to me at a red light looking over. I managed to lose him going around big trucks at the wee hours of the morning as I drove to more familiar territory. 


I don't know what could've happened to me that night, but looking back at it now I'm glad my instincts kicked it while I still had a chance.

My (29F) husband's (30M) new friend (34F) is making me jealous,"tl;dr Husband meets woman in hobby class, they quickly become friends, she's inviting him out to a show and my alarm bells are ringing. Am I just over reacting?

My husband met a woman in his pottery class. He likes working with his hands, and he's pretty introverted, so I persuaded him over a few months to try the local pottery studio and meet people. But now I'm beginning to regret it.

As he says it, they hit it off very well. She's in the same industry as him (accounting) and into the same science fiction books as he is. They ended up getting coffee after the last workshop and traded a bunch of book recommendations.

Today he said that she's invited him to see a stand up comedy show. My husband always wanted to take lessons in stand up comedy but been putting it off, and apparently she's done amateur stand up for 2 years so she knows the local scene. I told him that I feel uncomfortable about it and he got visibly sad and confused. He says it's just a friendship because of many shared interests and nothing more and that this woman is just super extroverted and friends with a ton of people at the pottery studio.

Am I right to be jealous? I trust my husband. He's been a solid, loving, caring man. I've definitely had some bad experiences with men in the past, so maybe I'm overreacting.  Can someone pls give me a reality check?

  
Edit: wanted to provide more background.

  
We've been together for 6 years and dated for 2 years before. I think our relationship is rock solid. We've had rough patches but worked on fixing things up and it's been really great over the last couple of months.

My husband is a really quiet guy. He hangs out with a few friends every now and then but otherwise spends time alone, either bird watching or reading. (He's not part of any clubs). But he's also really nice. Just last weekend when we were coming back with groceries we met our new neighbors who were moving in and he just offered to help them (he's fit and pretty handy). I sometimes think he's a little too trusting.

I also feel confused about this situation because I go to a woodworking workshop which is mostly men and I've started a few friendships there. I'm the only woman in a small group of shop friends where we often hang out at the bar afterwards, though the guys there tend to be much older (45-65) so I never had any tension there. My husband brought this up when we talked because it's ok to have different gendered friends for me but not for him? He met most of the guys in that group but not all of them just because scheduling conflicts.

I'm a freelancer with 5+ years of real-world experience (and a side of caffeine-induced creativity). I specialize in digital marketing, content creation, and multimedia management‚Äîwith a particular knack for:

* **Digital Marketing & SEO:** Boosting your online presence without turning your site into a ghost town.
* **Content Creation:** Writing blogs, articles, and copy that even my mom would brag about.
* **Podcast Management & Audio Editing:** Helping you launch and polish your podcast, because your brilliant ideas deserve better than ‚Äúum‚Äù and ‚Äúah.‚Äù
* **Content Repurposing:** Transforming long-winded pieces into snappy, shareable content‚Äîless is more, right?
* **Social Media Strategy & Guidance:** Offering down-to-earth advice and management to make your social media as engaging as your favorite meme.

I promise I'm not some corporate robot‚ÄîI bring a human touch, a few laughs, and a genuine passion for helping your project shine. If you‚Äôre looking for reliable, fun, and effective freelance support, shoot me a message!

1j39euw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dryeyes/comments/1j39euw/cutting_dairy_may_have_improved_my_symptoms/,Cutting Dairy May Have Improved My Symptoms,"I got diagnosed with dyspepsia a month ago and the doctor told me to cut off from acidic foods, spicy ones, coffee, and dairy. Two days in my new diet and I began to notice that my eyes have been feeling alright, almost normal. Surprisingly, I can look at screens for a really long time, there are no headaches, no doziness, no dry or gritty feeling, everything was like... normal, except when I'd wake up in the morning with really dry eyes, but even that has improved! My eyes during the mornings are less dry than when I had not yet avoided dairy. So to test if my idea is correct, I took dairy a few times this week and my eyes would feel dry many minutes to hours later. 

This may not work for everyone, but I hope this could reach some help to those who are still looking for ways to improve their symptoms.",2,1741090444.0,Dryeyes,0,1.0,False

He only mentioned to me before going that it is his friend.

Before the play he mentioned ""let me text my friend and know when I can meet her""

I thought it was just a regular friend and usually he only went to theater with two of his guy friends. We only been with each other for 7 months so I thought maybe still a regular female friend. 

But it was strange to me that he didn't mention her name or any background context. I have some feeling that it was not a regular female friend.

Next morning when we drink coffee and there's a hair he picked up himself and said that was my hair, because he was with a blonde girl last night.

Then he said it was a girl named Vivy and they used to go on 10 dates but wasn't a match so they decided to stay friends since then.

When I was told so I feel a bit uncomfortable because the context seemed wrong: going on one-one theater date with an ex date while he is in a relationship with me on a Saturday night.

But he said he had no feelings for her and they are just friends.

I acted calm and just said it is a bit strange to process for me.

He said I was more conservative and he is more liberal on this matter of staying friend with exes.

And he said he would be fine if I do the same, it is just a matter of trust.

I feel so confused guys.

How should I react about this?",1,1741090282.0,Advice,10,1.0,False
