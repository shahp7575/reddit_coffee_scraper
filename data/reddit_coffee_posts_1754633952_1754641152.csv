Would be great if you’re around my age and maybe local, but honestly, I’m just as happy keeping it online if that’s easier.

A bit about me:
	•	Big football fan 
	•	Into cars and mountain biking
	•	Love getting out for dog walks — happy for you to ask about my dog, he’s basically my little shadow
	•	Also into gaming and F1

If you’ve got similar interests, even better. We could chat about anything from the latest match results to what’s under the bonnet of our dream cars. If you’re nearby, maybe meet up for a coffee, a walk, or a kickabout sometime — but no pressure.

Drop me a message if you’re up for a chat.

I never missed a single episode, and I had posters all over my room. The main actor was my absolute hero ,  someone I thought I’d never get the chance to meet.

Fast forward about 15 years, and I’m waiting in line at a small coffee shop on a random Tuesday morning. A man walks in wearing a baseball cap and sunglasses, but I recognized his voice instantly when he ordered. My heart started racing because it was *him*.

I froze for a moment, not sure if I should say anything. In the end, I just smiled and told him how much his work meant to me growing up. He was surprisingly kind and even took a couple of minutes to chat before leaving with his coffee.

It was such a small moment, but it made my whole week. Funny how life throws these unexpected little gifts our way.",1,1754641099.0,story,0,1.0,False

I was late. She was early. I spilled coffee on her sketchpad, and she just laughed. That’s how it started — every day after that, we met at the same bench before our trains went in opposite directions. Different lives, 20 minutes of overlap. Somehow, it became everything.

We never called it dating, but we stopped seeing anyone else. We didn’t need to. Those 20 minutes each morning became our little world. She brought me breakfast when I overslept. I brought her flowers on Tuesdays, because she once said Tuesdays felt like forgotten days. She hated goodbyes, so we never said them. Just “see you tomorrow.”

One day, I told her I loved her. She looked at me like she already knew, like she had been waiting for me to say it out loud. She whispered, “Me too.” That was the last day I saw her.

I was hit by a drunk driver that night. I was in a coma for nearly a year. When I woke up, my memory was patchy. Her name, her laugh — gone. Doctors said it was normal. I didn’t feel normal.

It took me another year to remember her.

By the time I made it back to the station, she wasn’t there. I waited for a week. Then I found the older woman who sold flowers nearby. She remembered us. Said the girl with the sketchpad came every day at 8:20 for three years. Just in case.

And then, one day, she stopped coming too.

I never found her again.

Some days I tell myself she moved on. Other days I imagine her waiting just one more day. I carry a flower in my bag every Tuesday. Still hate goodbyes.

He never gave off any weird vibes, never rushed anything, and honestly made me feel safe.

We started seeing each other regularly. No love bombing, no sketchy disappearances. Just easy, consistent presence. I hadn’t dated in a while due to a messy past relationship, so this felt real. Like maybe this time would be different.

Then last week, while we were hanging out at my place, his phone rang. He looked anxious. He silenced it, but I saw the caller ID. I made a joke, something like, “Ooh, is Sophie your mom or your secret wife?” expecting him to laugh.

He later said it’s “complicated.” That Sophie is technically his roommate, but they used to date. He claimed they’re not together anymore but still live in the same place for financial reasons, and that they’re “trying to figure things out.” I asked him why he didn’t mention this earlier. His answer? “I didn’t want to ruin what we had.”

Since then, I’ve been spiraling. I feel stupid and used, even though part of me wants to believe him. Was I the “other woman” this whole time? Was he emotionally cheating?

I’ve been working at a coffee shop for almost 8 months, and here’s the list of gifts I got myself to celebrate:

Invisalign – This basically took all my savings (and yes, my parents helped too). I’ve always felt a bit insecure about my teeth,I had an overbite and never liked how I looked when I smiled. I thought about getting metal braces, but I really didn’t want to start college with a bunch of wires in my mouth, so I went with Invisalign

Soocas electric toothbrush and Zima Dental’s ultrasonic cleaner, My dentist told me it’s super important to floss or use a water flosser. I found this Soocas one on Amazon that’s a toothbrush and water flosser in one, so it saved me from buying two separate things

Lululemon Double Zip Backpack 22L – I used to use the Adidas Wonder Blue. Honestly, even though the Lululemon one is smaller on paper, it somehow holds more. I got the raw linen color and love how the compartments are set up. I keep my iPad in the laptop sleeve, lunch and daily stuff in the main part, a pouch of hygiene stuff in the front pocket, and my ADHD meds plus power bank in the top pocket. My favorite part? The stretchy mesh side pockets,one fits my water bottle, the other holds my umbrella. Super handy

Stanley THE ICEFLOW — I ended up leaving with the Prickly Pear iceflow (which has the new lid/spout thankfully). Love that the accent on prickly pear is actually an olive color (originally it looked black or navy). And Petrol is a really pretty smokey blue in person…

My son is eight weeks old and only breastfed. The last three days his stomach bubbles significantly after feeds (I can hear and feel it). Sometimes it seems like he is handling it well and other times he cries and kicks his legs a bunch. Leg kicking will sometimes lead to a series of farts that may make him cry a bit. This is at its worst when it’s time for sleep. Last few nights have taken us 2 hours to get him to sleep, just because the gas keeps waking him up before he can hit deep sleep. This does happen the odd time but its been the last three nights in a row now. 

For further context, my boy will usually poop 3-4 times a day after meals. But the last three days he is pooping 1-1.5 times and the poop is a BLOWOUT when it finally comes, with some mucus. He is super happy after its out and then the process repeats with his tummy getting more upset as the day progresses and him trying to poop like usual after feeds but not succeeding. 

Lastly, I recently had a clogged duct and started feeding him both breasts at each feed instead of just one (as it seemed like he needed both). My one breast is now working back to 90% I think but he is still taking both boobs. I am wondering if volume could be contributing to the change/tummy upset. I do LOTS of bicycle kicks and knees to chest, tummy time, gas drops. I do my best to burp him but he has been a very difficult baby to burp. 

I don’t drink coffee anymore or eat gassy foods as his stomach has appeared to be sensitive to these food types. ",1,1754640011.0,newborns,0,1.0,False

I’m just a regular watcher, not some tech genius, so here’s how things stacked up for me—hopefully this helps someone else save time (and maybe a little sanity).

# 1. IPTVMEEZZY

* **Price:** $16/month (a bit less if you prepay)
* **Channels:** 45,000+ live, 220,000+ VOD
* **Smoothness:** 9/10 (only the very occasional hiccup, even during big sports events)
* **Devices:** Works on everything I’ve got—Firestick, Android TV, even my old iPad

I first tried MEZZY after a friend mentioned it in a group chat. To my surprise, it’s been the least fussy of the bunch. Setup was quick, and honestly, I haven’t thought about it much since—which is a good thing! Everything from Premier League to obscure cooking shows has streamed smoothly, and their VOD library is a rabbit hole (I’ve started so many shows I’ll never finish). Their support actually replied when I had a weird EPG issue at 2am, which I didn’t expect.

# 2. PixelStream Vault

* **Price:** $18/month
* **Channels:** 37,000+ live, 160,000+ VOD
* **Smoothness:** 8/10 (streams are sharp, but I hit some buffering during championship finals)

PixelStream is a bit on the pricier side, but I do like their modern interface. Their movie selection is strong, especially for newer releases, but their Asian lineup is thinner than others. Customer service is quick, but I lost a couple of channels during a major live event (not a dealbreaker, but slightly annoying).

# 3. Aurorafast

* **Price:** $14/month
* **Channels:** 39,000+ live, 125,000+ VOD
* **Smoothness:** 8.5/10 (really stable, especially for Euro sports)

Aurorafast was my “surprise winner.” Not as flashy on paper, but it quickly became my go-to for football and F1. The VOD isn’t as huge, but it’s easy to browse and well-categorized. I did have a couple slow VOD loads on weekend nights, but live TV rarely let me down.

# 4. StreamBlazeTV

* **Price:** $17/month
* **Channels:** 36,000+ live, 145,000+ VOD
* **Smoothness:** 8/10 (setup is super fast, but there’s the odd lag when everyone’s streaming at home)

StreamBlaze is the definition of “plug and play.” I was up and running in minutes, no drama. Their VOD updates a lot, which I like, but international news channels are a bit limited. Still, overall it’s hard to complain.

# 5. NovaFlare IPTV

* **Price:** $15/month
* **Channels:** 33,000+ live, 110,000+ VOD
* **Smoothness:** 7.5/10 (a couple of 4K streams felt compressed, but fine for most stuff)

NovaFlare has a quirky, old-school interface, but it covers the basics well. US and South American channels are solid, and I actually found some rare documentaries I hadn’t seen elsewhere. Movie quality can be hit or miss, but I can live with that.

# 6. VisionCastPro

* **Price:** $13/month
* **Channels:** 28,000+ live, 80,000+ VOD
* **Smoothness:** 7/10 (buffering during peak hours, but good for everyday background TV)

VisionCastPro is my “budget pick.” If you’re not super picky and mostly want the classics or familiar cable channels, it’s a solid choice. I did run into a few buffering issues on Friday nights, but support was friendly and helpful.

# 7. EdgePlay Media

* **Price:** $16/month
* **Channels:** 34,000+ live, 120,000+ VOD
* **Smoothness:** 7.5/10 (great for sports, a little lag on older movies)

EdgePlay Media is about as straightforward as it gets. Sports coverage is good, and their setup guide could be followed by my grandma (no offense, grandma). Some movies lagged, but live sports were usually crisp.

# 8. IPsharkTV

* **Price:** $15/month
* **Channels:** 30,000+ live, 90,000+ VOD
* **Smoothness:** 7/10 (audio sync issues on a few channels, but easy to use)

IPsharkTV is basically my backup for the kitchen TV. It’s user-friendly and quick to set up, but the channel list isn’t as deep as others. Good for casual viewers or as a backup option.

# Final Thoughts

Honestly, there’s no “perfect” provider, but MEZZY ended up being the most reliable for me—mainly because I just don’t have to think about it. Aurorafast and PixelStream are both good if you like sports or movies, and VisionCastPro is decent if you’re on a budget. I’d say try a short-term plan first and see what fits your habits (and your late-night snack routine).

If you’ve got a favorite I missed or a different take, definitely let me know—especially if it pairs well with insomnia and leftover pizza.",1,1754639573.0,boisvert,2,1.0,False

It was one of the hardest years of my life. Always on a survival mode. Choosing a particular meal for it's price/function rather than it's desirability. This was 2014-2018.

Yung classmates and friends ko dati pag may major exams kami, bumibiyahe sa centro para lang magstudy sa coffee shops. Especially during the thesis year. Di pa uso study hubs and co-working spaces that time. They said na sobrang productive daw nila pag sa coffee shops sila. Of course my poor ass couldn't go with them kasi yung kape palang pang daily allowance ko na. At parang di naman bagay dun yung sobrang kapal na 2010 acer aspire laptop ko.

As the title says, I’ve been together with my girlfriend for 4 years (and a few months) and I’ll start by saying we get along really well. We can hang out like friends, barely ever argue (never anything serious) and are attracted to each other still, generally a pretty healthy relationship I suppose.

However, for more context, my girlfriend has never worked during the course of our relationship. We each had some difficult years mentally in our teens, and it affected her results, couple that with her quite serious anxiety she suffers with, she never started applying for jobs until around 22 - we’re now 24, and she still hasn’t been successful in any applications. It gets her down, and it gets me down, even if I never show it to her, and try my best to constantly reassure her that it’s ok and to just keep trying! I’ve worked the entire time, I’m an accountant, and have saved really well to the point where I’m pretty much ready to buy a decent house on my own, so I don’t feel like I need her to have an income necessarily to survive. I do pay for everything though, days out, meals, coffee etc etc

It gets even more complicated however when you consider her home life. 3 years ago her dad took his own life, it was the saddest situation I have ever been a part of. She has a younger sister who is now 10, and helps to look after her a lot with her mum, who honestly I’m not sure if she works/if she does it’s not a job affording her surplus income. She also has 2 brothers, one of which is 20, and has just got his girlfriend of 1 year pregnant, the baby coming later this year, and both the girl and the baby moving into an already cramped house shortly. None of them drive either, so the entire relationship I’ve been driving around 1 hour from my house to see her, mostly picking her up to stay with me on weekends.

My family like her, however I do wonder if they ever think about our future. I feel a little like our lives don’t match up, and she is so dependent on me for any sort of future that it isn’t good. But that’s where I get stuck, because I feel if I broke up with her, she really would be totally stuck, and I do genuinely love her and care about her, so that bothers me a lot. Like, she would have no job, no career, no relationship, not many friends - I’m worried she would get really depressed and be in a bad situation. It stresses me out every single day. I’m just really not sure what to do, as our relationship is definitely unhealthily one sided, but she has lots of family troubles so I don’t blame her for it all. I’m not even sure if I want to/don’t want to break up. I’m honestly so conflicted and confused that it drove me here. Please feel free to add any thoughts, they might really help me!

What can I do about this?

1mkoygt,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Ok_Exchange4762/comments/1mkoygt/checklist_before_you_rent_a_coworking_space_in/,Checklist Before You Rent a Coworking Space in Patna,"Let me tell you something, I’ve seen a lot of people jump into renting a [coworking space in Patna](https://www.exospace.in/locations/coworking-office-space-in-patna) just because the interiors look good or the price feels “cheap.” But once they start working there, they realize the internet drops every hour, the parking is a nightmare, or they can’t even get a meeting room when they need it.

If you’re in Patna and considering a coworking setup whether it’s on **Fraser Road**, **Boring Road**, or near **Ashok Rajpath** here’s my checklist before signing anything:

1. **Location & Connectivity** Make sure it’s close to public transport or easy to reach during peak hours. Patna traffic can be unpredictable.
2. **Internet Speed & Power Backup** Test the Wi-Fi speed yourself. Ask about backup generators or inverters power cuts do happen here.
3. **Meeting Rooms & Privacy** Even if you don’t have clients every day, you’ll need a quiet space for calls or private discussions.
4. **Community & Vibe** Some [coworking spaces](https://www.exospace.in/) in Patna are lively with events and networking, others are dead silent. Choose what matches your work style.
5. **Hidden Costs** Ask about GST, security deposits, and extra charges for printing, coffee, or additional guests.

A little homework before committing will save you a lot of headaches later. Patna’s coworking scene is growing, so take your time and pick a space that lets you work at your best without worrying about the basics.",1,1754638740.0,u_Ok_Exchange4762,0,1.0,False

The lobby of the Valor Tower was as glamorous and quietly oppressive as its exterior — so much so that Sunny and Effie, the only two people not wearing smart business suits here, looked woefully out of place.

Effie was stunning enough to turn heads, but her lackadaisical athleisure ensemble seemed too casual and slopρy… as for Sunny, his cheap, nondescript cop clоthes looked outright shabby and inappropriate in this grandiose temple to money and power.

Nevertheless, both carried themselves with absolute confidence, as if they owned the place, which only brought them more attention.

'Here we go.'

Walking over to the vast reception desk, Sunny showed his badge to the nearest receptionist.

""Detective Sunless and Detective Athena of Mirage PD. We are here to meet Mr. Mordret.""

The young woman looked between the two of them with a lost expression — at least for a moment. Then, her training kicked in. Her expression instantly changed to that of an extremely polite brick wall, and she said with a flawlessly neutral smile:

""Oh… oh, I see. Do you have an appointment?""

Sunny mentally translated her words…

'No chance in hell. Be gone, peasants!'

Of course, not just anybody could meet the CEO of the Valor Group. In fact, very few people could, and a couple of lowly detectives were definitely not in that small, exceedingly elite club.

He responded to the receptionist's smile with one of her own.

""No. Do you have hearing loss?""

She blinked.

""Excuse me?""

Effie leaned on the desk languidly.

""My partner was wondering which part of what he had said you failed to hear. Was it 'detective' or 'Mirage PD'? Or do you just think that police officers have nothing to do all day and would seek out your CEO without a reason? We have an important and official reason to see him, so hurry up and get him into a room with us.""

Sunny raised an eyebrow and waved his badge in the air.

""Or are you blind? Did you perhaps not see our identification?""

The receptionist maintained her professional smile.

""I am not sure I...""

Effie shook her head and said loudly:

""Wait, no. They wouldn't keep a deaf, blind girl at the reception — that'd just be cruel. Perhaps they simply don't care that the Nihilist is walking around killing people.""

By then, they were already being slowly surrounded by security guards, who weren't even trying to be subtle about it.

Sunny sighed, and then added in a similarly loud tone:

""Killing people, including their own colleagues! My, what a shame… it seems that the Valor Group treats police officers with contempt and is refusing to help the investigation. Are they just callous, or do they have something to hide? Goodness gracious, what a sad turn of events…""

He felt a little guilty about putting the poor receptionist on the spot. Gods knew she was probably just hoping to get through the day… but at the same time, she was guarding the gates of hell, so a bit of torment came with the territory.

The security guards had surrounded him and Effie by that point, looking at each other with troubled expressions. The loud voices had also gathered a small crowd… if office workers were known for one thing, it was that they often suffered from boredom. So, they were not going to miss a bit of drama to fuel the gossip.

That was what Sunny wanted. He knew, of course, that getting to Mordret was not going to be simple — in fact, it was all but impossible in the short term.

Even if an employee of the Valor Group had been killed by the Nihilist, that did not mean that they could just go and interrogate the CEO… they would have to go through a chain of increasingly important people first, starting from some poor exec and working their way upward from there.

So, he was fully prepared for that long and arduous process. Making a scene in the lobby was merely the first step — the threat of a public disturbance would force someone in the hierarchy of the Valor Group to appease them, which was going to be a start.

Effie sighed and reached into her paper bag to produce a sandwich. Unwrapping it slowly, she said:

""Well, what can we do? I guess I won't have anything to tell the press tomorrow… just that our attempts at cooperation with the Valor Group were, sadly, met with a pronounced lack of enthusiasm. It just breaks my heart to imagine what people will say the next time the Nihilist strikes… could it have been prevented? Could the Valor Group have helped? I guess we'll never know…""

The receptionist paled a little, then exchanged a series of glances with a senior colleague. Finally, she smiled weakly.

""Oh, no… I'm afraid you misunderstood, detectives. Let me contact a superior and see what I can do. Please make yourself comfortable! Would you like a cup of coffee?""

Sunny once again translated her words:

'Shut up and stop making a scene, bastards! Go sit in a corner like good children while we find a scapegoat to entertain you for a bit!'

At the same time, an avalanche of phone calls would probably descend on the Homicide Division Captain, who would get screamed at by half a dozen people to remind him to keep his subordinates under control.

Sunny glanced at the nervous security guards, then at the receptionist.

Eventually, he shrugged.

""I don't want coffee. Do you have chocolate milk?""

The receptionist gave him a very odd look.

""Wha... I'm not sure?""

Sunny frowned.

""Then that won't do…""

But before he could continue to apply pressure to hopefully get a more important scapegoat, and therefore shave off a couple of steps to the unreachable, deific CEO of the all-powerful Valor Group, a pleasant voice suddenly resounded from behind.

""Excuse me. Perhaps I can help?""

Sunny froze.

Effie did, too.

They glanced at each other tensely, then slowly turned around.

Behind them, a striking man in an immaculately tailored, slightly flamboyant yet elegant suit was standing in a circle of bodyguards.

He seemed to be around thirty, tall and in perfect shape, with pale skin and raven-black hair. His face was on the sharper side… not exactly handsome, but at the same time charming and strangely beautiful. Everything about him screamed of wealth and class — the emerald fabric of his bespoke suit, the subtle splendor of his luxury watch, the precious gemstones on his cufflinks and tie pin…

But more than wealth, the man emanated the feeling of power.

It was a different kind of presence from the oppressive aura his father used to possess. Instead, the man seemed friendly and mild. And yet, anyone could tell that he was someone extraordinary simply because of how absolutely relaxed and at ease he seemed — as if nothing in the world could possibly pose a problem to him.

His tie was loose, and a few buttons of his designer shirt were stylishly missing. There was an easy, relaxed smile on his face, and a spark of curiosity in his strange eyes… his eyes that resembled two pools of liquid silver, reflecting the world back on itself.

Noticing their strange expressions, the man blinked a few times.

""Oh, where are my manners? Allow me to introduce myself…""

But of course, the man needed no introduction.

He was the young CEO of the Valor Group…

Mordret.

And I'm not talking about some basic elevated room. This is a PROPER treehouse built around actual trees.

The Location Reveal:
Hidden deep in Munnar's hills, you literally drive through tea plantations thinking you're lost, then BAM - this architectural masterpiece emerges from the forest.

What Makes It Insane:

- Built AROUND living trees - branches grow through the structure
- Forest views from your bed - wake up to monkeys and birds at eye level
- Eco-luxury done right - solar power, rainwater harvesting, composting
- Staff that actually cares - most welcoming team we've ever met
- Silence - only sounds are wind and wildlife

The Experience:

- Morning coffee 30 feet up in the canopy
- Stars visible from your pillow (no light pollution)
- Private forest walks with naturalist guides
- Farm-to-table meals grown on property
- Digital detox vibes but with luxury amenities

Best Part: It's incredibly calm and peaceful. Staff are genuinely caring and attentive to every detail. This isn't Instagram luxury - it's authentic eco-luxury that actually respects nature.

Bottom Line: If you want to experience Kerala beyond the usual backwater houseboats and beach resorts, this is IT. Best boutique property we've ever stayed at, hands down 🙌",14,1754638547.0,Hotels_India,0,1.0,False

Saw this beautiful girl sit down close to us, with her friends. Petite, cinnamon skin, in an all-white cute outfit. Absolutely precious.

After about 30 minutes of eye tag with her, I go to pay the bill and like the sigma male gigachad I am, I just give her another wishful glance, careless about the fact her friends are staring at me back and basically giving me the “ok” to approach her. So I do what a normal, well-raised gen Z young man does, I turn my ass one-eighty and walk out of there.
Omw home I couldn’t help but think about that meme “when you see some fine shyt and just say “Damn!”, but don’t even shoot your shot no more, just move along.”

Truth be told, there was no reason to not approach her. Due to the German, she likely isn’t fully native and it would proceed into us having a long-distance thing IF she vibed with me, that is, but that’s honestly just my cope.

The coffee tasted heavenly. It was strange, really… Sunny had been suffering from insomnia for a while now, surviving on sleeping pills and still having nightmares every time he did fall asleep. Perhaps as a result, everything felt tasteless to him — but whenever his therapist offered him coffee, he could not help but enjoy it.

""So, where do I start?""

As she opened her notebook to silently take notes, Sunny sighed.

""I don't get those recurrent nightmares often, anymore…""

He still saw them every time he slept, but he rarely slept, so that could hardly be called ""often"".

""The world is sort of annoying, but I don't get irrationally angry either. It feels like I have a firmer grasp on myself.""

He had smashed his TV just this morning, but that anger was perfectly reasonable. There were many good reasons to hate the Valor Group and its CEO.

""...I don't thinκ I really felt paranoid about something since our last session. So, I guess that is an improvement?""

He had considered the best way to kill the supposed drunk in case the man attacked him, earlier this morning, but that was not paranoia. That was just experience, and Sunny would be a fool not to pay attention to strangers around him.

Sunny continued spouting confident half-truths to give the therapist the impression that he was a stable, well-functioning member of society. Someone whom she should give a clean bill of health and never see again. He wasn't sure if his act was fooling the taciturn beauty, but she did not question his account even once.

He was not sure if she believed him or simply didn't care.

After a while, Sunny found himself simply recounting his thoughts to her without much pretense.

""I am bored. I am restless… I want to get back to work. I tried doing things that normal people do in their free time, like going on a picnic or taking a walk in the park. But it has been raining the whole damn month. Staying inside is infuriating because of all the bullshit on the news, and I can't really go to a bar, can I? You told me not to mix sleeping pills with alcohol. I feel like... I'm missing something that I never had. So…""

He hesitated for a few moments, and then asked:

""Can't you just pass me, doc? We both know that I am only here to comply with what the judge said. And the judge only sent me here to comply with people paying for his vacation home.""

Of course, Sunny had failed to disclose a few important facts about himself to his beautiful shrink.

For example, the fact that he sometimes felt like his nightmares were the actual reality.

Or that he sometimes believed himself to be the only real person in the world.

Or that he sometimes hallucinated foreign sights, sounds, and sensations, as if he possessed multiple bodies. That was probably because he often spaced out for a few seconds because of the insomnia, falling into bouts of microsleep.

Little stuff like that.

The therapist looked at him with her usual aloof expression.

""Do you think you are mentally fit to resume work, Detective?""

Sunny laughed, hiding the literal shivers her sonorous, enthralling voice sent running down his spine. It was probably a good thing that his therapist did not speak a lot… her voice was just as perilous as her looks, if not more bewitching.

He shook his head.

""Me, mentally fit? God, no. But who the hell is, anyway? I mean… with the way the world is, wouldn't it be stranger if I was perfectly fine? I'd definitely turn around and run if I ever met a person who seemed happy, healthy, and completely sane.""

She studied him for a while, then nodded and closed her notebook.

""Alright, Detective. To be honest, I am not a fan of mandatory counseling myself. Despite the circumstances, however, you did show considerable progress in these few months we have been seeing each other. So, I am ready to report that you are fit to resume service… on one condition.""

Sunny raised an eyebrow, surprised. This was probably the most he had heard her talk ever since they met.

""What's that?""

The therapist studied him for a while, then said in her usual aloof tone:

""I want you to continue therapy even after you are reinstated… in fact, I insist that you do. You are my patient, and I dislike the idea of leaving things unfinished. I abhor it.""

Sunny chuckled.

""So… either I continue to see you, or I can't go back to work? How is that different from mandatory counseling?""

She shrugged.

""You can refuse.""

He remained silent for a few moments, then scoffed.

""I am sorry, doc, but you seem to be overlooking something. These sessions were being billed to the Mirage City Police Department. If we continue to see each other after my mandatory therapy is over, though, I'll have to pay for the sessions myself. And I am very sorry to say this… but you are way out of my price range.""

A peasant like him would not even be let near this exclusive hospital in normal circumstances, let alone receive treatment here.

His therapist gave him an impassive look, then sighed and reached into her pocket. Producing a beautifully embossed business card, she offered it to him with a graceful gesture.

""This is my personal number. We can work something out.""

Sunny received the card with a stunned expression and looked down at it.

'...Saint? No way, that's her actual name?'

The saintly therapist was actually called Saint. Learning that fact, Sunny really felt crazy for a moment.

Plus, she was giving him her number…

Pushing silly thoughts out of his head, Sunny looked at the aloof beauty and cleared his throat.

""Well, alright. I'll call you when things settle down a little, doc.""

With that, he put her card into his wallet and stood up.

""Thanks for everything… I guess.""

She nodded indifferently, already turning away to start filling out the necessary paperwork.

""Don't forget to get your sleeping pills from the pharmacy. Good sleep is the foundation of mental health, Detective. Be well.""

A few seconds later, Sunny found himself outside her office, somewhat lost. He had not expected that getting the stone-faced shrink to give him the clean bill of health would be so easy.

'It turned out great, though?'

Shaking his head, he went to the pharmacy situated on the lower floor of the hospital to get his prescription.

…It was when he was waiting for the pharmacist to fill it, listening to the rain pattering against the window, that there was a loud sound of something heavy falling nearby.

Then, a piercing scream shattered the silence.

As Sunny turned around, he saw several tall, muscular orderlies running to the source of the noise with troubled faces.

""Hurry!""

""She got out again!""

""How the hell is she…""

He lingered for a while, watching the disappear behind a heavy door, then separated himself from the wall he had been leaning on and followed.

Behind the door was one of the areas of the hospital where casual visitors weren't allowed. The dimly lit corridor was a complete mess, with several people struggling to get someone whom Sunny could not see behind them to the floor.

Just in front of him, he saw an overturned wheelchair, its wheel still spinning…

And a pool of red, vivid, glistening blood slowly spreading across the floor.

At the heart of the pool was a kneeling nurse who was crying loudly while clutching at her face, red streaks running between her fingers and painting her white uniform into a striking shade of vermilion.

At that moment, one of the brawny orderlies was tossed back, colliding with the wall with enough force to make the floor shake.

""D—damn it! How is she… so strong!""

""Hold her down, shit!""

""Don't hurt her, you idiots! We're all done for if she gets hurt!""

Sunny could finally see the cause of the mayhem.

The person whom four muscular orderlies had been struggling to contain… was a slender woman with wavy black hair and a pretty, but cold and sharp face. She was wearing a shredded straitjacket and resisting the orderlies with an amount of strength unexpected from someone of her build and constitution, clearly unhinged.

Strangest of all, though…

Was the fact that her eyes were of bright, vibrant red color.

Just like the blood on the floor.

Humans were not supposed to have vividly red eyes, but no one seemed to notice or pay it any attention.

By then, the orderlies finally managed to push the woman to the ground and were in the process of tying the sleeves of her straitjacket back up. She had been resisting them, still… until her gaze fell on Sunny.

He froze.

'Why… why does she look so familiar?'

The woman's eerie red eyes widened a little when she saw him.

And then, she suddenly laughed.

Her laughter resounded across the corridor, growing louder and louder until it drowned out the pitiful whimpers of the injured nurse.

The insane woman seemed to be incredibly amused all of a sudden. She seemed to be having thе time of her life.

Taking a step back, Sunny pursed his lips and turned around.

'Just another psycho.'

There were too many of those around, these days.

As he was walking back to the door, however, her laughing voice washed over him:

""Kill him! You can actually kill him here! Find… Athena!""

Shaking his head, Sunny shut the door behind him and tried to calm his wildly beating heart.

The stench of blood was still stuck in his nose, making his hands tremble.

The sight of it…

'Damn it.'

Although Sunny knew that mixing sleeping pills with alcohol was a terrible idea, he suddenly really craved a drink.

Sunny dreamed a nightmare.

In that nightmare, he lived in a dying world where grotesque monsters were real, people possessed supernatural abilities, and humanity was on the verge of being snuffed out by the encroaching darkness. The world was one vast battlefield, and every day, countless lives were lost in the bloody battle for survival.

Sunny himself was one of the strongest people in that world, having clawed his way to the pinnacle of power through mud, blood, heartbreak, and thorns of betrayal. He was buckling under the crushing weight of responsibility and carrying the cruel burden of his own past sins.

…He also had a smoking hot, stunning, drop-dead gorgeous girlfriend.

Sunny could somewhat accept the existence of monsters and superpowers, but that last detail had really clued him in to the fact that it was all a dream.

'Ah…'

He was woken up by the blaring sounds of the alarm.

""Wake up, Sunny! Wake up, Sunny! Wake up, Sunny!""

'Shit.'

Grabbing his phone, he fumbled to turn the alarm off and then sat up, looking around with groggy, bloodshot eyes.

His room was dark and messy, full of stale air and empty bottles. The TV was on, showing a colorful commercial for Valor Group's new extravagant mall. The young CEO was cutting the red ribbon in front of a cheering crowd, his simple smile blinding the camera…

Sunny stared at the TV for a while, deep darkness nestling in his eyes, then tossed his phone at it. The screen shattered, and a net of cracks distorted the smiling face on it, making it seem as if he was staring at a broken mirror.

Sunny was suddenly wide awake.

""Ah, no! Shit!""

He jumped off the bed, sending several empty bottles rolling across the floor, and hurried to the TV. The screen of his phone was cracked, as well, but luckily, it was still in working condition. Sunny checked the time and the date, then let out a relieved sigh and slowly stood up.

Still reeling from the damn nightmare, Sunny muttered a few curses and walked to the window. Opening the shutters, he grimaced from the light and looked outside.

The dim lilac radiance of the early dawn washed over his pale body — his toned muscles, a scattering of scars decorating it like badges of dishonor, and a frightening tattoo of a black serpent coiling around his arms and torso.

...Not exactly what one would expect from a decorated police officer, but Sunny had lived a tumultuous life before finding the straight path.

Outside the window, the city was obscured by a curtain of rain. Cars were rushing to outrun the morning traffic, leaving trails of scarlet glow in their wake. Here and there, red neon crosses stood out against the twilight sky like beacons for lost souls, and all around them, countless shops and restaurants were opening their doors like temples to greed and gluttony.

Above it all, glass skyscrapers stood like towering cathedrals. There, in the bowels of conglomerate offices, dwelled the real power.

The streets were grimy, the apartment buildings were decrepit, and the people were worn down, confined to the narrow pavements by the traffic while walking to their destinations with glassy eyes.

Something about it all seemed strangely off, as if the world of his nightmares was much more real.

'...There aгe no barriers surrounding the city.'

It was such a strange thought, and yet, Sunny could not get rid of the feeling that there were supposed to be enormous air filtration barriers on the horizon.

But what for?

'I must have really lost it.'

In any case, the sun was rising above Mirage City.

It was time to face a new day...

Today, Sunny made a reluctant effort to look presentable. He took a shower, shaved, and found the least wrinkled clothes he had. Black jeans, a gray t-shirt, and an inconspicuous jacket… the clothes hid his sharp edge, but thеre must have still been something in his gaze, because a drunk loitering at the back of the building reeled back from just one glance.

Sunny watched him stagger away with a cold, somber expression. The man seemed like a genuine drunk, but one never knew… it paid to be careful.

Once the swaying figure disappeared around the corner, Sunny climbed into his old, battered car and put the key into the ignition.

As he drove along the city streets, he could not help but think of the dark, desolate coastal highway of the Antarctic Center. No… that had happened in another nightmare. This was reality, so why was he thinking about such dreadful things?

The radio was playing a catchy tune, reminding him that, apart from having a smoking hot girlfriend, he was also friends with a genuine pop star in those dreams. On top of that, he owned a thriving business, lived in a castle, was watching over a lovable little sister, and… played the flute?

'What the actual hell...'

Dreams were truly a bizarre place.

Sunny was not really a person with a rich imagination, though. How did his subconscious even imagine all these things?

Shaking his head, he stopped at a traffic light and struggled against the paranoid feeling that every driver on the road was staring at him.

Some time later, Sunny reached his destination... it was a prestigious psychiatric hospital on the outskirts of the city.

Locking his car, he walked across a small park to the entrance and showed his pass to the security guard. Many affluent people received treatment in this seemingly idyllic hospital, so security was really tight here — the stunning building was no different from a fortress, really, and there were many places inside where regular people like himself weren't allowed.

As for Sunny himself, he was not an affluent person. However, he was a civil servant in a situation that put the higher-ups in an awkward position, so they sent him here for mandatory psychiatric counseling.

That had been months ago. And today… today, gods willing, was going to be his last session. If everything went well, he was going to be reinstated and return to work. And just in time — Sunny had a feeling that the bastard he had been pursuing for so long was going to strike again, soon.

As Sunny was let inside, he caught himself on having used the word ""gods"" — plural — and frowned.

'Get a grip, damn it.'

He could not mess up today.

Soon, he found himself sitting in a comfortable chair and facing his therapist.

His therapist was some kind of big deal in the shrink world despite being relаtively young. She was quiet and extremely professional, so despite the mandatory nature of their relationship, Sunny did not dislike her a lot. The woman just sort of sat there silently while he talked about whatever was on his mind most of the time, so there was little to dislike.

Well… there was one thing.

His therapist really had no business being so goddamn beautiful. It was surreal, really, how breathtaking she was — not to mention distracting.

Her skin was pure white alabaster, her eyes were like two onyx gems, and her features were almost inhumanly flawless. It was as though she had not been born, but actually cut from stone by a mad sculptor. As a result, what should have been beautiful looked a bit eerie, instead... haunting, even.

Her usual lack of emotion only made the overall impression more disturbing.

Meeting her indifferent gaze, Sunny forced out a smile.

""Good morning, doc.""

She looked аt him evenly…

And then smiled softly.

The smile transformed her face, making it utterly tantalizing, almost painful to look at. It was like looking at something holy... a living saint, maybe.

""Good morning, Detective. Would you like a coffee?""

For some reason, Sunny felt a sense of profound wrongness when he heard the hauntingly beautiful therapist talk.

Also, for some reason, he felt compelled to answer her question honestly.

Sunny shrugged.

""Sure. Why not?""

...Like every other calamity in his life, this catastrophe started with the smile of a beautiful woman and a cup of coffee.

1mkork2,https://www.reddit.com/r/gayrelationships/comments/1mkork2/i_thought_i_was_straight_and_now_im_obviously_not/,I thought I was straight. And now I'm obviously not. What do I do know?,"The facts that English is not my first language, and that I'm more confused than ever might shine through in this post, but please be gentle.

So... Since divorcing my wife about a year ago, I've enjoyed single life for the first time in ten years. Had some short flings with women, just having a general good time, being your average straight guy etc. But...

I met a man through a work contact. We kind of hit it off immediately. We had each other's numbers and started to occasionally send a ""how's it going"" message and so on. Then we started having a coffee now and then. Then hanging out at his place, at my place. Every time we met, it was incredibly easy to be with him, share all the thoughts and feelings, and I had the impression the feeling was mutual. Just the easiest time every time, being open and just truly yourself.

So, one of the feelings we were able to share was, there was some chemistry between us. The thing is, we were both straight. Or ""straight"". But it was obvious for both there were romantic feelings between us. And, we discussed it. Admitted it.

And it was so easy to discuss. Like stating the obvious. It didn't affect our interaction in any way, we just said it, put it there out in the open.

Since then, things have progressed. We have hugged, shared kisses, not that intense but still quite a lot longer than a ""friendly"" kiss. And we've slept together. Not made love, just slept. With underwear on, but close to each other, spooning or hugging. And it all still feels like the most natural thing ever, we have discussed it and shared how much we both enjoy it. Basically we are just waiting for the next chance to sleep together, it has become a frequent thing.

It is obvious we have something going on, and we aren't trying to hide it. We have talked about a possibility of a relationship. We had a warm, hearty talk about it, and we are both really into each other. And very naturally, with incredible ease, we discussed intimacy too. Not like we're going to make love immediately, just shared what we feel as it is a big question mark for both, both having lived a straight life and slept with women only.

But here's the thing. During one deep discussion, he shared his sexual orientation is ""straight"". And that he would love if i was his ""woman"" in bed. It was a very warm and intimate moment, we were on his couch basically in each other's arms. I asked him a some questions about what he means, he answered, there was to pressure to anything, to move forward with this, nothing. Just sharing our feelings. There was no pressure  into anything, it was just like one of the thousands of honest discussions we've had. Afterwards we went to sleep, like before, holding each other close.

Jump to this day. I haven't told him yet, but the more I think about what he said, the more I'm... Turned on about the idea. When we discussed this, I got the idea of what he means by me being his ""woman"". Like, the sexual acts involved, he hinted at lingerie etc. And honestly, my feeling right now is I want to run to him, jump in his arms and tell him I want it more than anything.

I'm not even sure what I'm looking for posting this. Getting it off my chest? Advice? Doesn't matter. Hearing someone say ""it's ok"" would be great too. I still feel I'm straight. But obviously I'm not. Because what we have, I want to take further. If I think about being sexually ""equal"", or whatever the correct term is, I don't even want that. I want what he said. And honestly, I don't feel I want it because he wants it, but more like he unknowingly gave me an idea that has never even crossed my mind that felt like a true eye-opener.

If it matters, I'm well into my 30s and he is 20 years older than me, which I also find very, very attractive in him.",3,1754637978.0,gayrelationships,2,1.0,False

If anyone's considering a similar trip, here's how it went:","**Intro + Background**Hello everyone. I did a lot of poking around on here while researching this trip so I figured it would be be helpful to add my own writeup for people planning in the future, in case it's helpful.I'm from Anchorage and still have family there. Recently a family member was interested in getting a new EV but the shipping up to Anchorage was problematic and / or expensive - I am not an EV owner and I don't really follow what's going on but sounds like there was some kind of accident or fire with a container ship recently that means that shipping up there either isn't happening or is really pricey.

I needed a break from work and have wanted to do that drive again for a while now, so I agreed to drive it up from where they purchased it in Washington, to Anchorage, through Canada.

We looked at taking the ferry for part of the way - from Bellingham to Haines - but it was also pretty costly and they only sail once a week these days so the timing was a little awkward. I have done that leg in a car in the past (in an ICE car) and it's a blast if you don't mind sleeping on the deck of the ferry, but these days I am not sure my lower back would be too happy with that decision.

So the all-land route it was.

I'll break this down into sections and a day-by-day quick log. Jump around if you want. I really liked having the detail when I was doing my own research so I apologize if it's too nitpicky.

**Summary**6 driving days, ranging from 5-10 hours drive time. Longest charge time was 4-5 hours, in a town where the fast charger was broken. Typically charged up above 80% given the unpredictability and distances involved in the more remote areas. Didn't ever get stranded but it was a little dicey in spots. Overall much better charging support than I expected, especially in BC, where I feel like the infrastructure is to the point where you don't really have to do much pre planning. No real regrets or big things I'd change.**Even Shorter Summary**

Fun drive, a little stressful sometimes, worth it, long, beautiful!

**Vehicle**I drove the 2026 Kia EV9 - I think they have only been out for a very short amount of time. I believe it was the long range model. Like I said, not my car, and I am not an EV guy so I don't know too much about this aspect of it. I know I had to use a CCS charger adapter at almost every stop.

I liked the car a lot. It's pretty huge for a guy like me but for their family with kids I think it makes sense. It has quite a bit of range, realistically, it's only in places like northwestern Canada that you feel it. I really liked the driving assist features - in my day to day I drive a pretty basic (but hey, still great) Subaru without a lot of the bells and whistles. The lane keeping assist or whatever was awesome. Less functional on rougher roads of course but on highways, I could set cruise control and lane assist and pretty much uhhhhhhh let the car drive, not sure if I am supposed to say that.

The one downside is the climate control cuts into the mileage pretty significantly. Took me a couple days to figure this out. Also the charging port is on the opposite side of the car of a lot of other EV’s which makes it a little goofy to orient while parking at a charger that other people are at / may arrive at. But not insurmountable.

**Route**I took I-5 north through Seattle, then cut east at Bellingham to cross the border in more like Abbotsford than Vancouver itself. From there in order I went through Kamloops, Cache Creek, Prince George, Fort Nelson (skipping Dawson), Watson Lake, Whitehorse, Beaver Creek, Tok, Glennallen, and ended in Anchorage. Stopped more places than that obviously but that will give you something to put into a map.

This was driven by a combination of places I wanted to see, charging places I knew about, avoiding forest fires, trying to stay within some kind of range of services in case of a problem of some sort, and driveable distances. I’ll get into it more in the day-by-day.**Lodging**

I stayed in a hotel (of some description) every night. If I was to do this again and I had more flexibility, I think staying at RV parks and camping would be a good option because I think a good number of them are starting to or have chargers that charge reasonably overnight. Because I was only driving one-way though, I couldn’t bring all my camping stuff because I wasnt going to be able to take it on the plane on the way back. Or it would have been a giant pain. Plus, again, lower back. But I think you could definitely do this a little cheaper and a little more rustic.

The one pain here is that quite often, I was playing it by ear where I would end up on any given night, due to uncertainty around charger availability and charge time. If I ever showed up and had to wait for someone to charge, or if I needed to charge and the charger wasn’t available for whatever reason, the amount of charge time needed especially further north where the chargers were slower (50kw if you were lucky) meant that it was hard to reserve hotel rooms ahead of time and know for sure you would be there. Day-of is sometimes cheaper if they need to sell a room that would otherwise be empty, but it can be a real roll of the dice.**Cost**

For 6 nights, charging, food, snacks, coffee, etc. my cost as 1 person was about $1700 USD. Again camping would make this a lot cheaper, and I like to try restaurants when I’m in new places, so you could certainly lower your food costs and be more frugal.



**Resources**I used A Better Route Planner which I’m sure you all know about, which was pretty good. Further north I relied more on the official apps of the charging utilities - BC Hydro, and Flo in the Yukon. I also started relying on stopping in at every town’s visitor center and talking to the desk staff - they are quite often across developments in the EV charging area much earlier than some of the other resources. Things like Oh yeah, they just put in a new charger at Johnsons Crossing! or “I think that RV park has a fast charger now actually.” that maybe weren’t on other resources [yet.One](http://yet.One) challenge here is that the Kia was not linked up with A Better Route Planner so ABRP couldnt access my real-world driving efficiency data and adjust its predictions and routing advice. There were a couple times when I input the days travel into ABRP just to back-check it, and ABRP assumed I should have arrived in a town with 25% battery left and I showed up with 6%. For example. Normally not an issue but in the areas with big stretches between chargers… a little harrowing.

I also used the Milepost, which I got a physical copy of, and flipped through at charging stops to see if there were any points of interest coming up. I would recommend doing this as well. They have pretty good EV charging information in there too since they update it every year.

**Daily Outline**

Quick outline of each day, where I charged, and also non-logistical highlights of the day for your traveling consideration.

**Day 1 - Portland to Kamloops BC**

Started off early ish in Portland, and stopped just north of Seattle (I used to live in Seattle and boy I do not miss the traffic) to charge at a Tesla supercharger. It was on the map as being east of the highway, but all I saw over there were regular chargers, which do not work with the Kia despite the plug fitting. Stuff you guys probably already know. So I bopped across the highway and with a little maneuvering found a row of superchargers in a parking lot of like a totally nondescript office building. This was my first time ever charging any kind of EV so it was a learning curve. I had to download the Tesla app and make an account, which was annoying. First time also using a charging adaptor but once I got the hang of it it went swimmingly. Charged for about 30 minutes I think to get back up to 80%. In the meantime I went into the lobby of the office building to find a bathroom - it was code locked but I just did the classic wait for someone to come out and pretend you were just about to go in move and it worked great.

Crossed the border near Abbotsford. Some questions regarding the newness of the vehicle but overall fine. One interesting note: the Kia does not switch its displays to kilometers automatically, but the display does change its speed limit guidance to a conversion from KM. A little funky but for example, in a 100km/h speed zone, the display still shows your speed in Miles per hour, but the little speed limit sign on the dash says Speed Limit 62MPH (the conversion from KM). I assume you can change this in the settings but I didn’t want to dick around with it and it worked well enough. Hung a right to head for Kamloops, and stopped pretty quick in Chilliwack to add some more juice - this was an “On the Go” charger in the parking lot of a gas station / convenience store. Worked reasonably well.I headed for Kamloops because it was the biggest city near ish to my route and I figured had the best odds of having a decent hotel room available. I don’t know what’s going on in that town but boy they sure love hotels there - there are a gazillion. I pulled in late-ish and was able to get a room at the Doubletree - there were two EV charging spots out front where I could have charged overnight but since I got in late, they were both taken. Nice hotel, nice room, everything besides bars was closed for the evening though so I just went to bed.  
  
**Day 2 - Kamloops to Williams Lake to Prince George**  
  
Got up early-ish and found a charger in town to plug the car in at while I went and had breakfast. Had a pretty good sun dried tomato + asiago benedict at Hello Toast. It was busy but I sat at the bar and eventually got served - very tasty stuff. The breakfast potatoes were incredible. Then I moseyed back through town and looked around, passed through the farmers market, retrieved the car, and headed out to Williams Lake, the rough midpoint between Kamloops and Prince George, the goal for the evening. 

Note - at this point I was hoping to push a little past Prince George, but there was no real logical next town that made sense. If you look at the total mileage to Anchorage you’d like to divide it up into pretty even chunks but what I found was that the population centers with fast chargers are not really spread out like that. So Day 2 was a shorter day than I might have liked - if spacing was a little better, or I was camping, I definitely could have equalized the days a little better with that added flexibility.

Williams Lake was an interesting little town at the confluence of two rivers. Beautiful scenery in this part of BC that reminded me of eastern Oregon and Washington. Dry golden browns, bluffs, water. Unfortunately they put the chargers in the ass ends of some of the weirdest parking lots in BC so my half thought through plan of “Park to charge for a bit and walk around looking at the town” did not really work. Instead I got a disgusting drink at Tim Hortons and wandered around looking at some First Nations interpretive installations and eavesdropped on everyone in a Tesla charging at the same bank of superchargers. Could be worse!  
  
On the way out of town (kinda) I stopped for coffee at Logjam. Great little shop, great vibes, great coffee, very weirdly shaped iced drink cup that did not fit that great in a cupholder, but it’s all part of the vibes.  
  
Next stop was Prince George for the evening. I got a room at the Hyatt Place there, which again, had a couple of EV chargers in the lot that were available in theory but busy when I got there. Bad luck.  
  
I had quite an evening here - went to the Twisted Cork, it was a bit of a quiet night initially but Mike the bartender was great to talk to (possibly slightly too energetic but what’s one dropped bottle at the end of the day) and made some delicious drinks. I had the scallops and risotto, and the caesar salad, both of which were very tasty. Got to talking to another solo traveler at the bar, we had another drink or five and ended up playing blackjack at the local casino til last call. My new friend was a real pro and I think turned her $100 into $110. Fun night. Funny little town.  
  
**Day 3 - Prince George to Fort Nelson**

Note here: I decided to go up 97 instead of the Cassiar for a couple reasons. One, there were some fires brewing on 37 that I didn’t like the looks of. Two, the chargers were more spread out on the Cassiar, and I was still a little gun shy about being so far from towns and services. 97 is more populated along this stretch although that’s not saying a ton. I believe the Cassiar is much more scenic, though.

This was a long-ass day, with two charging stops planned, and a nice little hangover to boot. Grabbed a plate of eggs at the hotel. Had to top off in the morning at a BC Hydro charger on the edge of town, in the community college parking lot. Got coffee at The Open Door Cafe on the way out of town, which was totally passable. Tons of local art and crafts for sale there which is cool.  
  
The first haul was Prince George to Chetwynd, a small little town that is famous for its chainsaw carving competition. Had lunch at A&W here while charging at the visitors center (BC Hydro). Beautiful scenery, you are kind of following a valley along this leg with lots of farms and forest and some great terrain change that offers some real sweeping views.

Via Hudsons Hope, I cut off the corner that would have taken me to Dawson City - this only saved a little bit of time, so if you are interested in sightseeing and are at a more leisurely pace I think it’s definitely worth a jaunt into Dawson to poke around. Beautiful scenery through by Hudsons Hope though, including a big dam project and some killer views up and down a river valley. Hopped on the Alaska Highway (Finally!) and the next stop was a BC Hydro near Wonowon. As I was pulling in to the chargers area I noticed two dudes in I think a teal Chevy Volt with a decal on the side that said “Bolt to the Arctic Circle.” Not sure what they were up to but if they’re on this subreddit - Whats up guys  
  
This stretch is scenic in a totally different way - it’s definitely starting to feel very northern. You can tell the soil is not deep - all the trees stop growing at a very specific height - and things feel muddy, boggy in a way. Thunderstorms. Not a ton of mountainous terrain yet. Most of what you see along the highway here are motels, abandoned motels, turnoffs for natural gas facilities, and work camps. There are a ton of giant pickup trucks around here full of sunburned men and welding gear.

I had my eye on a hotel in Fort Nelson that supposedly featured an abandoned tiki lounge, but when I pulled into town, the hotel was dark and locked. Someone saw me at the door and came to the door and told me “You can check in, but we’re closed tomorrow.” I didn’t really like the sound of waking up in a closed hotel, not even really sure what that would mean, so I backtracked a quarter mile up the main drag and got a room at the Woodlands Inn and Suites. Totally serviceable hotel. Very big. Lots of kids running through the lobby yelling which I knew because they put me in a ground floor room immediately adjacent to the lobby. But it’s all good, it’s all love. Had a very questionable chicken caesar salad at the Boston Pizza up the road.   
  
No EV plugs at the hotel but a BC Hydro fast charger in town.

**Day 4 - Fort Nelson to Watson Lake**

Woke up early again eager to hit the road. This day was probably the highlight in terms of things seen. Charged the car up at the BC Hydro fast charger while chomping down some McDonalds breakfast and a “Long Espresso” which they gave me in the type of cute to go espresso cup that would cause a security incident if it was ever handed to an average American McDonalds customer at an average American McDonalds.

Next charge stop was Toad River Lodge, another one of dozens of funny gas station / motel combos that exist in this part of the world. Had some decent coffee. Wandered around. Moseyed. Took some pictures. BC Hydro fast charger again. The BC Hydro fast chargers are pretty plentiful, even this far north, and most of them advertise 150kwh which is nice and zippy.  
  
This section is crossing into and within the Canadian Rockies, so the scenery starts to get pretty dramatic again. I did succumb to the temptation to stop and take pictures of vistas every 10 minutes. The joys of road tripping by yourself. You pass Muncho Lake for a stretch here, which has incredibly dramatic teal colored water.

Next stop was probably the highlight of the trip and another reason I took 97 instead of the Cassiar - Liard Hot Springs. A day use area with a cool bathing structure (changing rooms and benches) built into a natural hot springs. Stinky, but a real treat and a real unique area. Tons of folks were congregating here, including a few Quebecois dudes on motorcycles I had spotted at the A+W in Chetwynd, and I think the same dudes in the teal Volt. Again, not sure. Dudes, let me know.Look up some pictures of this place and definitely consider adding it to your route.

Stop for the night was Watson Lake. I realized that basically every successive town heading north, pulling into the town I had been like “Wow, this place is really fuckin tiny” only to then drastically revise my expectations downwards when I got to the next, even incredibly tinier, town. Watson Lake is basically a wide spot with a few motels along the highway. And a visitors center, where the charger lived. I was in the Yukon territory by now - no more fast BC Hydro, I was stuck with 50kwh Flo chargers. Fortunately, the government of Yukon made all the chargers free to use. Unfortunately, they were pretty slow.   
  
I left the car charging and walked across the highway to the Sign Post Forest - a grove of trees where almost 80 years worth of travelers have hung up signs and license plates, whatever, commemorating their journeys through. Unexpectedly very moving. I spent an hour just wandering around here, reading signs from people who had passed through decades ago and had more than likely passed on. Bring a sign of your own and definitely plan to stop here.  
  
I got a room at A Nicer Motel in the strip of motels - as far as I could tell they all looked pretty similar. Again a nice functional room, nothing flashy. I think based on reading google reviews of places a lot of people had higher expectations for rooms, and I could envision a world in which I thought these rooms were crummy. But at the end of the day they were quiet and clean and the plumbing worked. So.

Had dinner at The Nugget, a Chinese place. Haven’t had Chinese food of that particular kind - your classic 90's American Chinese food - since I was a kid growing up in Anchorage, so it was pretty nostalgic. Up in this area the similarities between Alaska and this part of Canada were really hitting me - weird little frontier places that basically only exist because of a big resource extraction boom 50-100 years ago and are somehow still hanging on.  
  
Anyway.  
  
**Day 5 - Watson Lake to Whitehorse**

Every night at the hotel I would do a little research and fine-tuning on the route ahead the next day, mostly so I could have the most current wildfire information. The night before is when I had noticed ABRP distance guidelines and route planning were way more optimistic than distances and charge levels I was hitting in the real world. I started to worry a little bit - there’s a leg on this trip when you hit Alaska where you really do not have any intermediate points and pretty much have to have a 100% charge to make it from Beaver Creek to the next charger. The distances I had been hitting and the car was telling me it was capable of, I was not going to make that leg, even at 100%. Light freakout moment, but I decided to dedicate Day 5 to some serious data checking. By which I mean I busted out a pen and pad, wrote down the actual distance between some stops, wrote down the ABRP prediction, wrote down my car’s start levels and the car’s prediction of miles remaining, and then did it all again at every stop and used good old fashioned arithmetic to see how much the car was off by.

Topped off again at the visitors center charger in the morning, then hit the road. The first stop was Rancheria Falls - no charger here but a quick 10 minute walk along some very nice boardwalks to see a cool series of waterfalls in the woods. I am a little bit spoiled living in Oregon but these were quite nice. Took a photo of a couple on their way from Edmonton to visit their son in Whitehorse.The math here said the car was optimistic by about 25%. Not as bad as I thought, and a short distance, but still worrying. For the next leg I cut the climate controls completely to see if that would help.

It sure did.  
  
Originally my thought was to try and make it to Johnsons Crossing in one leg without stopping to charge, because the distance was pretty comparable to the worrisome leg from Beaver Creek to Glennallen. But the charger in Johnson was super slow - i think it was a 25 - and as the day wore on and I checked my math with pen and paper at every stop I got less worried. I had figured out the AC was a massive impact on efficiency, and with the AC off, I was actually often *beating* the car’s estimates. So leaving from Beaver Creek with a 100% charge and no AC usage would actually give me a very comfortable buffer to get to the charger in Glennallen.

So I stopped at Teslin and used the fast (“fast”) charger at the marina there. Left the car charging, crossed the highway for a pretty passable clubhouse sandwich and fries at the restaurant there. Restaurant was quite busy!

Left on about an 80% charge for the leg to Whitehorse. Aimed for the Flo fast charger at the Whitehorse Transporation Museum - at this point again I was kind of high-centered in terms of timing. Part of me really wanted to push to Beaver Creek and cut a day off the trip and get home a little earlier, but the chargers in Yukon were really not fast enough to make that a reality without planning to pull into Beaver Creek at like 11PM with no hotel reservation and no camping gear. And also - all the fast chargers in Whitehorse were down that day anyway. As I was pulling in to the fast charger at the visitors center, a guy in the next stall over waved me down - he lives in town, and told me that all the fast chargers were not really functional at delivering 50kw and most of them were stuck at more like 12 for various reasons. He had theories. Not sure. But there were plenty of like, 7kwh chargers that were still paid for by the Yukon government. So I hooked up to one and planned to spend the night in Whitehorse.

This town broke the every-town-is-tinier trend. Wow, it really reminded me of Anchorage. Architecturally and vibes wise. They have a beautiful river front path, it seems to be a jumping-off point for outdoor activities like hunting, mountain biking, etc in the area, so it was full of like, young adventure type people. Bend Oregon vibes. Sorry for saying Vibes again. I got a room at the Sternwheeler, after calling around to about five other places that were already full. Then I went and put my name in at Gather, had a drink and some decent tempura green beans at the hotel across the street while I was waiting, then had some kind of delicious ahi / guacamole situation with a marg at Gather, and a couple more drinks at the Woodcutter’s Blanket up the road.   
  
Talked to some interesting folks at the bar, including an older couple from Alberta on their first road trip in 40 years, and a young man who had just gotten laid off from his job in fuel cells. Always sit at the bar and talk to people IMO. Car was just reaching 90% ish at this point, five hours later. Back to the hotel and conked out.  
  
**Day 6 - Whitehorse to Beaver Creek**

Another short-ish day because of the timing of charging, so I planned to take it easy and give myself plenty of stopping time. Good thing too because this is probably the most or second most scenic leg of the drive. Got breakfast at The Open Door, a fascinatingly busy coffee shop where they’ve got a real streamlined operation happening. Whitehorse is a very interesting place, I would love to go back and spend more time there and figure out the vibes. It’s definitely a major regional hub of some kind.

Short, mountainous, beautiful leg to Haines Junction - another spot I had considered pushing on to and staying at the previous night if the car had charged faster. Pulled up to the fast charger at the visitors center and for the first time in the trip, had to wait in line for someone else to finish charging. Another couple in a Tesla pulled in a few minutes later, we chatted for a bit, they said they had just been in Whitehorse and all the fast chargers were working fine and they were a little insistent. Not really sure what to do with that information but I hit them with a “Huh that’s crazy.”

Very cool visitors center here. Tons of info on geology of the area, the mountains, icefields, First Nations people, the whole deal. Overheard a First Nations fella from the eastern side of Canada talking to one of the local First Nations guys about the differences in how their treaties were set up, how they handled certain things, so on and so forth. Cool moment to eavesdrop in on for a white boy like me.

After charging up to 80%, I went and grabbed a coffee and snack at the coffee shop / bakery in town. Very cute little place with an awesome patio - I should have stopped and had real lunch and enjoyed it a bit more but I was not feeling amazing from the night before.

Continued on. This segment is definitely the most bonkers scenery of the whole drive. Take your time here if possible. The road got pretty bad around Destruction Bay, which I was expecting since I talked to a bunch of the visitor center people along the way. It’s built on permafrost so in the spring it heaves like crazy, not much they can really do about that. Definitely need to be prepared to slow down, there are some wild dips.Pulled into Beaver Creek around 5pm maybe, hit the charger at the visitors center. Another slow one so no chance of scooting out early since I pretty much needed to be at 100% to feel good about continuing to Glennallen without problems. Asked the visitors center attendant about motels, got told there were only three so I was in luck in that it would be easy to choose. One was full, one was disrecommended by the lady I talked to, so I got a little cabin out back of Buckshot Betty’s. Decent enough little spot but god I wish they had put a fan in the room. it was real stuffy. Had an OK burger at the restaurant, some good fries, sat next to a shockingly vulgar Canadian fella who seemed to take offense to the fact that I scooted down the bar to give him and his buddy a little more elbow room. Whatever.

Returned to the visitors center on foot to sit in the car for another hour while it chugged up to 100% ever so slowly. By the time I got back to the cabin it was cooling off a bit but still quite toasty in there. Took a cold shower to cool down and passed out surprisingly easily.  
  
**Day 7 - Beaver Creek to Anchorage**  
  
Woke up early, got coffee at a place across the street, it was fine, hit the road. Roads still quite bad and lumpy in this area. No real cell service once you leave town for quite a ways. Border crossing was very quick and easy, and I laughed at how much better the road instantly got. Some construction in the area (hence the good roads I guess) and had to wait for pilot cars a couple of times, but overall pretty quick through here. Quite beautiful again, this whole day was.

Got to Tok midmorning, stopped for coffee and a snack. I had been keeping my eye on a big fire in the area that looked like it was threatening the town and possibly to close the cut down to Glennallen, which would have detoured me up around through Delta Junction and then down the Richardson. Not a ton longer but not time I wanted to spend. 7 days on the road is a long time. Fortunately, there had been a giant downpour in the area the day before and the fire was totally out. God loves me.

Continued on to Glennallen, pulling in around 1130. No state or federal funding in this great nation of ours for charging infrastructure - this one was hilariously tucked in the back parking lot of a log cabin Subway, right next to a dumpster. Sure says something about something, I bet. Brief moment of panic when the CCS charger wouldn’t start charging, but downloaded yet another fucking charging network app and eventually got it to start charging. 50kw again. Not really “Fast” but at this point I only had 180 miles to go to Anchorage. Rather than eat at Subway I hiked up the road a bit to the Caribou motel where there was a cafe. Had a pretty great grilled cheese sandwich and a pretty decent bowl of tomato soup and a pretty weird salad.Hit the road with about 85%. 

No more charging stops til Anchorage. The section of highway between Glennallen and Palmer is again some of the most beautiful on the whole trip, despite the rainy weather.

Arrived in Anchorage on about 17%. Good enough!

**Trip Highlights**  
  
\- Liard Hot Springs, number one with a bullet  
\- Canadian Rockies scenery  
\- Spending way too much on good food and booze at The Twisted Cork  
\- Signpost Forest  
\- Kamloops... something about that area really spoke to me. Would like to go back.  
\- Logjam Coffee  


That's it! Hope this helps someone in the future. It sounds like Canada is really rolling out some more EV capabilities as we speak, so the chunk of the drive in the Yukon especially should be getting less stressful every day.",19,1754637962.0,electricvehicles,0,1.0,False

# Guardian Class

There's a few feats of each level from 1 to 8, and most content works as written (aside from testing bugs in production). And **yes,** you can in fact **rest** in armor (I **dare you** to find the Easter Egg). More feats will come **in time**. You can find more comprehensive information on the mod page itself.

For those wondering where the **Commander** class is, that is being handled by @""SilchasRuin"":

>I'm almost feature complete, I need to redo a couple minor things, and I need to do icons for like everything.  
  
I should have it out within a week, hopefully on Monday if I don't run into issues.  
  
Also, I have every offensive and mobility tactic implemented (except mountain training, because what would that even do?), and all but 2 expert tactics (gonna wait till after release to do them, but I don't think it'll take long, Alley-oop and Take The High Ground).  
  
I have every feat up to 8th level done.

I'd like to give special thanks to @""ubik2"" who has given us their blessing to continue these classes where they left off with the original [Battlecry Playtest](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3246164409) mod.

He’s a 3-year-old golden retriever, basically a walking ball of sunshine. We were just doing our usual loop — he sniffs every tree, I sip my coffee, nothing unusual.

Out of nowhere, this woman (mid-50s maybe?) comes over with this over-the-top “OH MY GOSH, what a beautiful boy!” energy. I smile, because okay, Max is adorable, and I’m used to people wanting to say hi. She crouches down, gives him a scratch, and starts talking to him in baby talk. So far, normal dog park stuff.

Then she says, “You don’t deserve such a sweet dog. I’ll give him a better home.”

I laugh because I think she’s joking… she’s not.

Before I can even process it, she grabs his leash and starts trying to walk away. Like… what?! I’m still holding my coffee and standing there completely blindsided while Max is looking back at me like, “Uh… mom??”

I tell her, “Excuse me, that’s my dog.” She goes, “Dogs choose their owners, and he chose me. Look at how happy he is with me.”

At this point, I’m in full “what is happening” mode. I step in front of her and firmly take the leash back. She gets huffy and says I’m being “selfish” and “depriving him of a better life.” Then she stomps off muttering something about “ungrateful people.”

This might run long. Might wander a bit.
But that’s okay.
Because if you’re the kind of person who feels a little too much, who thinks way too deeply during those brutally quiet 2:27 a.m. hours, who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly just wants something raw and unfiltered...then maybe this isn’t just a post.

Maybe it’s a tiny nudge from the universe.
A crack in the chaos.
A weird little sign that this might be your leap of faith.
One you didn’t know you needed, until now.

Because I don’t believe people stumble into our lives by mistake.
Some show up to test our patience.
Some derail us, turn everything upside down.
But then...
Some just feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways.
They arrive, and your soul exhales like it’s been holding its breath for years.
And quietly, something inside you whispers.. this, this is what I’ve been missing.

So hey,

I’m 26. I’m a doctor. From India.
And no, I won’t diagnose you unless you sneeze like a suspicious side quest and my reflex jumps into action.

But I’m more than a white coat and a stethoscope.
I’m a loud and proud nerd.
Not the cute, Pinterest-board kind.
The “quotes random Marvel lines in conversations” kind.
The “still mad about how Interstellar messed with time” kind.
The “loses sleep over fictional deaths and weird plot holes in sci-fi” kind.

I fall hard for characters that don’t exist.
I spiral into thoughts about time, death, memory, consciousness....... you know, the casual stuff.
Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I’m the main character in a noir detective story, trying to solve a case that’s equal parts medicine and existential meltdown.
Other times I vanish down a rabbit hole about marine biology, quantum reality, or nanotech in surgery because my brain whispers, dig deeper bro, we’re not done yet.

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a bit of Arabic (barely enough to survive a desert trip).
Oh, and I’m learning Klingon. Because curiosity and chaos kind of run the show up here.


---

Now there’s this voice in my head.

It isn’t always kind.
It’s definitely not gentle.
But damn, it keeps me going.

It says:
Think harder.
Don’t settle.
Fix what’s broken.
Show up even when everyone else bails.

It doesn’t care about grades or gold medals or what some fancy LinkedIn profile says.
It cares about truth. About purpose.
About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world.
Why grief hijacks the brain.
How trauma gets buried in bones.
What we’re really chasing under all this noise.

I’m not wired for surface-level anything. Never was.
I need depth. I need meaning.
I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.


---

So what am I even looking for?

Let’s keep it messy and honest.
I want someone real.

Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual “hey” like they didn’t leave your head spinning.
Not someone who opens with “wyd” and ends it with “lol.”
Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations.
The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

Someone who says, “I’m not okay, can we just exist side by side today?” without feeling like a burden.
Someone who hears a lyric and feels it deep in their ribs.
Someone who smells something random and suddenly time-travels back to a memory they can’t explain.
Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes, then goes quiet thinking about souls, stars, and why love always feels like both a war and a poem.

You don’t have to be perfect.
Just be human.
Just be honest.
Just... be there.


---

But let’s get even more specific.
Right now?
I want a study buddy.

Not the “let’s do one pomodoro and ghost each other for eternity” type.
Nope. I’m talking real. Consistent.
Like, actually showing up even virtually.

You don’t have to be in medicine.
You could be studying law, architecture, psychology, space dust, or just... life.
You could be healing. That counts too.

I want someone I can sit with  virtually while we both fight our own dragons.
No pressure to talk all the time. Just be in the same digital space. Two people grinding. Growing.

Imagine it 
Midnight hustle.
Lo-fi beats or soft rain sounds in the back.
Steaming mugs of chai or coffee.
Occasional breaks where we drop either the dumbest memes or the deepest truths.

We keep each other on track.
We say, “You got this. I’m here.”
We share that random quote that hits way too hard.
We remind each other why we started.

Maybe we make it fun 
Send a quote before we begin.
End the night with a trivia game or a challenge that makes us laugh till our faces hurt.
Doesn’t matter how.
As long as we grow. Together.

And who knows?
Maybe this study session... maybe this is our shared leap of faith.
The one that keeps us grounded when the world feels too loud.


---

Outside study time though?

Let’s build a weird little friendship.

Watch movies and analyze characters like we’re their therapists
Share playlists like we’re swapping pieces of our soul
Talk about mythologies, science, dreams, multiverses
Argue over which villain actually had a point
Speak in bad Russian or British accents because life’s too short for dignity
Send random voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels a bit too much
Make inside jokes that no one else would ever get
Create a chaotic but cozy digital home made of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos


---

And just a few confessions to keep it real:

I’ve imagined being an X-Men way more than I should probably admit
Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting for me
I’ve been broken. Really broken. But I never stopped showing up

So if you’re:

A little cracked but still trying your best
Empathetic but forged of inner steel
Smart but soft in the ways that matter
Funny but carrying some quiet storms
Brilliant in your own messy, imperfect chaos

Then maybe just maybe  this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

This is my leap.
No filters. No flex.
Just me. Honest. Tired. Still dreaming.

So if any part of this made your chest warm or your brain go, same,
Send a meme. A quote. A lyric. A thought. Anything.

And if nothing else?

Let’s start with a study session.
Two nerds in different corners... 
Screens glowing. Hearts open. Minds focused.

Showing up.
Holding space.
Getting stronger.

Together.

Because in the end we’re all just stories trying to make sense of ourselves.

Let’s make this one a damn good one.

Still trying.
Still here.

So hey,

I’m 26. I’m a doctor. From India.
And no, I won’t diagnose you unless you sneeze like a suspicious side quest and my reflex jumps into action.

But I’m more than a white coat and a stethoscope.
I’m a loud and proud nerd.
Not the cute, Pinterest-board kind.
The “quotes random Marvel lines in conversations” kind.
The “still mad about how Interstellar messed with time” kind.
The “loses sleep over fictional deaths and weird plot holes in sci-fi” kind.

I fall hard for characters that don’t exist.
I spiral into thoughts about time, death, memory, consciousness....... you know, the casual stuff.
Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I’m the main character in a noir detective story, trying to solve a case that’s equal parts medicine and existential meltdown.
Other times I vanish down a rabbit hole about marine biology, quantum reality, or nanotech in surgery because my brain whispers, dig deeper bro, we’re not done yet.

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a bit of Arabic (barely enough to survive a desert trip).
Oh, and I’m learning Klingon. Because curiosity and chaos kind of run the show up here.

Now there’s this voice in my head.

It isn’t always kind.
It’s definitely not gentle.
But damn, it keeps me going.

It says:
Think harder.
Don’t settle.
Fix what’s broken.
Show up even when everyone else bails.

It doesn’t care about grades or gold medals or what some fancy LinkedIn profile says.
It cares about truth. About purpose.
About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world.
Why grief hijacks the brain.
How trauma gets buried in bones.
What we’re really chasing under all this noise.

I’m not wired for surface-level anything. Never was.
I need depth. I need meaning.
I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.


---

So what am I even looking for?

Let’s keep it messy and honest.
I want someone real.

Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual “hey” like they didn’t leave your head spinning.
Not someone who opens with “wyd” and ends it with “lol.”
Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations.
The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

Someone who says, “I’m not okay, can we just exist side by side today?” without feeling like a burden.
Someone who hears a lyric and feels it deep in their ribs.
Someone who smells something random and suddenly time-travels back to a memory they can’t explain.
Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes, then goes quiet thinking about souls, stars, and why love always feels like both a war and a poem.

You don’t have to be perfect.
Just be human.
Just be honest.
Just... be there.

But let’s get even more specific.
Right now?
I want a study buddy.

Not the “let’s do one pomodoro and ghost each other for eternity” type.
Nope. I’m talking real. Consistent.
Like, actually showing up even virtually.

You don’t have to be in medicine.
You could be studying law, architecture, psychology, space dust, or just... life.
You could be healing. That counts too.

I want someone I can sit with  virtually while we both fight our own dragons.
No pressure to talk all the time. Just be in the same digital space. Two people grinding. Growing.

Imagine it 
Midnight hustle.
Lo-fi beats or soft rain sounds in the back.
Steaming mugs of chai or coffee.
Occasional breaks where we drop either the dumbest memes or the deepest truths.

We keep each other on track.
We say, “You got this. I’m here.”
We share that random quote that hits way too hard.
We remind each other why we started.

Maybe we make it fun 
Send a quote before we begin.
End the night with a trivia game or a challenge that makes us laugh till our faces hurt.
Doesn’t matter how.
As long as we grow. Together.

And who knows?
Maybe this study session... maybe this is our shared leap of faith.
The one that keeps us grounded when the world feels too loud.

Outside study time though?

Let’s build a weird little friendship.

Watch movies and analyze characters like we’re their therapists
Share playlists like we’re swapping pieces of our soul
Talk about mythologies, science, dreams, multiverses
Argue over which villain actually had a point
Speak in bad Russian or British accents because life’s too short for dignity
Send random voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels a bit too much
Make inside jokes that no one else would ever get
Create a chaotic but cozy digital home made of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos


---

And just a few confessions to keep it real:

I’ve imagined being an X-Men way more than I should probably admit
Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting for me
I’ve been broken. Really broken. But I never stopped showing up
I’ve walked alone more times than I’d like. Still do. But I haven’t stopped hoping

Three months ago, I was scrolling through productivity content at 2AM (ironic, I know) when I stumbled across the whole ""5AM club"" thing. My first thought? ""These people are insane.""

But I was desperate. I felt like I was always behind, always stressed, never had time for myself. So I said screw it let's try this for 30 days.

Here's what actually happened:

Week 1: Pure hell. I'm not gonna lie. I wanted to quit every single morning. My body was in retaliating. But I stuck with it because I'm stubborn.

Week 2-3: Something shifted. I started looking forward to those quiet hours. No notifications. No chaos. Just me and my notes. It felt like I had peace for the first time in my life.

Week 4+: Life changer. I suddenly had 2-3 extra hours every day. I started reading again. Working out. Actually eating breakfast instead of grabbing whatever.

When you win the morning, you feel like you can win the day. That confidence carries over into everything else. I became the person who gets shit done instead of the person who talks about getting shit done.

Three things that made it stick:

1. Go to bed earlier (revolutionary, I know). If you're staying up till midnight, 5AM won't work.
2. Have something to look forward to. For me, it was that perfect cup of coffee and 30 minutes of reading. Find your thing.
3. Start gradually. Don't go from 8AM to 5AM overnight. Move it back 15 minutes every few days.

I'm not saying you need to become a 5AM person. But if you're feeling stuck and want those extra hours back in your life give it a shot for just one week.

It helped me become more productive and disciplined.

What's the earliest you've successfully woken up? Drop your morning routine wins (or fails) below mine is skipping day 3 because I was too lazy to wake up.

## Key Features Analysis

The effectiveness of a body man scrub depends on several factors, including its exfoliating agents, moisturizing ingredients, and overall formulation. Understanding these features is crucial to selecting the right product for yoru specific needs.**Exfoliating Agents:** The primary function of a body scrub is exfoliation, which removes dead skin cells and unclogs pores. Different scrubs utilize various exfoliating agents, ranging from natural ingredients like salt, sugar, and coffee grounds to synthetic beads. Natural exfoliants are generally preferred for their biodegradability and skin-friendliness. The type and size of the particles determine the intensity of exfoliation.

Different ingredients impact the user due to their own chemical compound structure. such as, salt scrubs tend to be more abrasive and better suited for tougher skin, while sugar scrubs are gentler and more appropriate for sensitive skin. Coffee grounds offer a more invigorating experience.Microbeads, once commonly used, are now often avoided due to environmental concerns and their potential to irritate the skin.

**Moisturizing Ingredients:** Exfoliation can sometimes leave the skin feeling dry, so a good body man scrub should also contain moisturizing ingredients to replenish hydration. Common moisturizers include natural oils like coconut oil, shea butter, jojoba oil, and argan oil. these oils provide a protective barrier, locking in moisture and leaving the skin feeling soft and supple.

In addition to oils, humectants like glycerin and hyaluronic acid can also be included in the formulation. These ingredients attract moisture from the air and draw it into the skin,further enhancing hydration. The presence of moisturizing ingredients is especially critically important for individuals with dry or sensitive skin.

**Formulation and Texture:** the overall formulation and texture of the scrub substantially impact its usability and effectiveness. A well-formulated scrub should be easy to apply and rinse off, without leaving a greasy or sticky residue. The texture should be consistent and not too harsh, to avoid damaging the skin.

Cream-based scrubs tend to be more hydrating and suitable for dry skin, while gel-based scrubs are lighter and better suited for oily skin. The size and shape of the exfoliating particles should also be considered. Rough, uneven particles can cause irritation, while smaller, smoother particles provide a more gentle exfoliation. The fragrance of the scrub is also important, as it contributes to the overall sensory experience.

**Added Benefits:** Some body man scrubs offer additional benefits beyond exfoliation and moisturization. These may include ingredients that help to soothe inflammation, reduce redness, or even tone the skin. For example, scrubs containing ingredients like aloe vera, chamomile, or colloidal oatmeal can help to calm irritated skin.

Other scrubs may include ingredients like caffeine or antioxidants, which are believed to improve circulation and protect the skin from damage. The presence of these added benefits can make a scrub even more appealing, especially for individuals with specific skin concerns. It is always a good approach to thoroughly research an ingredient list to discern if individual components will benefit the end user.

## Core Benefits

Body man scrubs offer a range of benefits that contribute to healthier, smoother, and more revitalized skin. These benefits extend beyond simple cleansing and can significantly improve the overall appearance and feel of the body.

**Improved Skin Texture:** Regular use of a body man scrub helps to remove dead skin cells, revealing the smoother, healthier skin underneath.This leads to a noticeable enhancement in skin texture, making it feel softer and more supple. Exfoliation also helps to even out skin tone and reduce the appearance of blemishes.

The physical act of scrubbing stimulates circulation, bringing more oxygen and nutrients to the skin's surface.This can help to improve skin elasticity and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Additionally, exfoliation allows moisturizing ingredients to penetrate more effectively, further enhancing the benefits of moisturization.

**Enhanced Cleansing:** Body man scrubs not only remove dead skin cells but also help to unclog pores, preventing the buildup of dirt, oil, and sweat. This can help to reduce the occurrence of breakouts and other skin issues. The exfoliating action also helps to remove ingrown hairs, making it an essential tool for men who shave their body hair.

Unlike regular body washes, scrubs provide a deeper and more thorough cleansing experience. The scrubbing action helps to dislodge impurities and debris that may be trapped in the pores. This leaves the skin feeling cleaner,fresher,and more revitalized.**Increased Moisture Absorption:** By removing the barrier of dead skin cells, body man scrubs allow moisturizers to penetrate more effectively. This leads to increased hydration and improved skin health. The exfoliating action also helps to stimulate the production of natural oils, further enhancing the skin's ability to retain moisture.Regular use of a body scrub can significantly improve the effectiveness of your favorite body lotion or moisturizer. By preparing the skin to receive moisture, you can achieve deeper and longer-lasting hydration. This is especially important for individuals with dry or sensitive skin.

## FAQs Section

Before incorporating a body man scrub into your routine, its natural to have questions about its usage, suitability, and potential effects. Here are answers to some frequently asked questions to help you better understand this essential skincare product.

**How often should I use a body man scrub?**
The ideal frequency of use depends on your skin type and the intensity of the scrub. Generally, using a body scrub 1-2 times per week is sufficient for most men. Over-exfoliating can lead to irritation and dryness, so it's important to listen to your skin and adjust the frequency accordingly. if you have sensitive skin, you may want to start with once a week and gradually increase the frequency if tolerated.

**Can I use a body man scrub on my face?**
While some body scrubs might potentially be gentle enough for facial use, it's generally not recommended. The skin on the face is much more delicate than the skin on the body, and using a harsh scrub can cause irritation, redness, and even damage. It's best to use a dedicated facial scrub specifically formulated for the face.

**Are there any ingredients I should avoid in a body man scrub?**
Yes, avoid scrubs containing harsh chemicals, artificial fragrances, and microbeads. Harsh chemicals can strip the skin of its natural oils, leading to dryness and irritation. Artificial fragrances can cause allergic reactions in some individuals. Microbeads are harmful to the surroundings and can also irritate the skin. Look for scrubs containing natural ingredients and avoid products with long, intricate ingredient lists.

Finney's novel is often celebrated as one of the most elegantly crafted time travel stories ever written, and after spending time with Simon Morley, I understand why. This isn't your typical sci-fi romp with fancy machines and blinking lights. Instead, Finney gives us time travel through self-hypnosis, a psychological journey rather than a technological one. How refreshingly human in a genre that often prioritizes gadgets over growth.
What struck me most was how Finney uses New York City itself as a character. The Dakota apartment building becomes more than just a staging area, it's a temporal gateway, a structure straddling two centuries with equal authenticity. As I read about Si gazing out those windows at Central Park, I found myself wondering which spaces in my own city might harbor such timeless pockets. Haven't you ever stood in an old building and felt the weight of history pressing in from all sides? Finney captures that sensation perfectly.

The novel balances its historical tourism with genuine human stakes. Si's mission begins as simple observation, but as with all great adventures, what starts as curiosity evolves into something far more profound. The emotional complexity deepens with each page, raising questions about where, and when we truly belong.
Finney's attention to historical detail is nothing short of remarkable. The inclusion of period illustrations (attributed to Si's artistic talents) creates an immersive authenticity that few historical novels achieve. Reading about Si wandering through old Manhattan, I could practically smell the coal smoke and hear the clip-clop of horse-drawn carriages. It's the kind of vivid scene-setting that makes you look up from the book and feel momentarily disoriented to find yourself in the present.
""I have been in New York for less than a day, and already I feel the city folding around me like a familiar coat,"" Si observes early in his journey, and Finney makes readers feel the texture of that coat in exquisite detail. The gaslit streets, the formal manners, the heightened sense of propriety—all rendered with such precision that the past becomes as tangible as the present.
What sets ""Time and Again"" apart from other time travel narratives is its thoughtful meditation on the nature of history itself. Most sci-fi treats the past as either a playground or a puzzle box, something to be enjoyed or solved. Finney instead presents history as a living, breathing entity with which we can engage directly. The novel asks: If we could step into the past, would we be mere observers, or would we become participants? And if participants, what responsibilities would that entail?
This philosophical dimension elevates what might otherwise be a simple adventure story into something more profound. As Si becomes increasingly invested in the lives of those he meets in 1882, we're confronted with questions about connection, intervention, and the butterfly effects of our smallest actions. The moral complexity grows alongside the narrative tension, creating a reading experience that's intellectually stimulating as well as emotionally engaging.

The love story that develops adds yet another dimension to the temporal exploration. There's something achingly poignant about connections formed across the boundaries of time, they highlight the universality of human emotion while simultaneously underscoring the cultural differences that separate eras. Finney handles this delicate balance masterfully, avoiding both anachronism and alienation.

After finishing the novel, I found myself looking differently at historical photographs, wondering about the lives captured in those frozen moments. ""Time and Again"" has that rare quality of changing how you perceive the world long after you've closed its covers. I've caught myself studying the architecture of older buildings more carefully, imagining what it would be like to see them in their prime.
For anyone who's ever walked through an old neighborhood and felt that strange tingle of temporal displacement, or stared at a vintage photograph long enough to imagine stepping into it, this novel will speak to you. Finney hasn't just written about time travel; he's created a literary time machine between two covers.

What I appreciated most, perhaps, was Finney's resistance to technological solutions. In an age obsessed with gadgets and scientific explanations, there's something wonderfully subversive about a time travel method based on psychology and perception. It suggests that the barriers between now and then may be more permeable than we imagine, that with enough knowledge, focus, and desire, we might bridge temporal gaps through sheer force of will.
Isn't there something captivating about that possibility? That the key to visiting another time might lie not in some complicated machine but in our own minds? It's the kind of concept that lingers with you, making you wonder as you walk past historical landmarks if you could, with sufficient concentration, slip sideways into another era.

""Time and Again"" offers not just entertainment but a gentle invitation to see your surroundings with new eyes—to recognize the layers of time, present in every street, building, and park. It's a book that makes you feel like a time traveler in your own life, more attuned to the historical echoes resonating around you.",1,1754636992.0,fantasy_books,0,1.0,False

Hey everyone I’m at it again, lol. 

I’m looking for folks that like playing FFXIV, drawing/making digital art, and roleplaying!!

A bit about me. I majored in the arts, and dabbled a bit in creative writing and photography. I loooove making art though, but I’ve gotten burnt out lately. Just to let you guys know, I am goth and poly. With that, I do have 2 boyfriends and I’m not really looking for anything. I’m also queer and non-binary. 

The kind of stuff I used to do was OC stuff and roleplay inspired ones. 

Gonna be super honest. If we don’t share similar hobbies I really will lose interest. Sorry about that. 

Big passion is creating art and writing roleplays or character backstories sometimes. 

FFXIV and the island sanctuary take up my free time sometimes when I’m home. Otherwise I’m just kind of staring at my screen or trying to figure out how to make more til, lol. I love watching like 18th century cooking stuff or arts and craft stuff. I also like going through weird deep dive stuff and sometimes it’s true crime related or urban exploration. 

I love national parks, museums, botanical gardens, coffee shops, going to cons, uuuhhh other stuff that will come up. Oh oh collecting little trinkets. Gundam kits, blind box stuff, having alone time. 

If any of that sounds fun uhh, yeah lol.

When you search online, you’ll get a list of spaces, some fancy websites, and Instagram-worthy photos. However, finding the right coworking space isn’t as simple as picking the one that looks the best.

I’ve hopped around a few places in Guwahati, so I thought I’d share what I learned (the hard way) for anyone who’s currently figuring this out.

1. Location matters more than you think

Trust me, you don’t want to spend half your energy commuting. If you’re looking around GS Road, Ganeshguri, or areas like Kamakhya Tower, check how accessible it is. How’s the parking? Is there a metro/bus stop nearby? These small things add up.

2. Don’t fall for photos — visit and sit for a day

Many spaces look cool online but feel dead when you walk in. I made this mistake once. Go visit, take a trial day, see the vibe. Are people working? Is there a community feel? Or is it just empty desks?

3. Understand your work style

Some people need quiet corners, others love buzzing environments. Some [coworking spaces](https://www.exospace.in/) in Guwahati are more community-driven, while others are super basic (just desks and WiFi). Make sure you know what YOU want before picking one.

4. Check flexibility of plans

Many places will try to push you into monthly contracts, but if you’re a freelancer or remote worker, look for flexible daily or weekly plans. Also, ask about amenities. Is meeting room usage included? Do they charge extra for basic stuff like coffee?

5. Talk to people already working there

This helped me a lot. During trial days, I casually asked other folks working there about their experience. You’ll get honest feedback this way whether it’s about internet reliability, management support, or even how crowded it gets at peak hours.

Quick Tips Before You Decide:

* Prioritize location convenience over aesthetics.
* Trial a day to feel the actual working vibe.
* Make sure amenities match your workflow (WiFi speed, meeting rooms, 24x7 access if needed).
* Check if they host community events (great for networking if you’re a freelancer or startup)",1,1754636708.0,u_Ok_Exchange4762,0,1.0,False

FOOD/RESTAURANTS

LUCKY LOTUS is a gem and I go there every time I’m back. Across the street is LACHELES which everyone knows about. Best happy hour in DSM is EATERY A.
USULUTECO for their pupusas. In general all taco trucks because they are a special part of the DSM culture that makes our city unique and people take them for granted.
Also PALMS DSM from the farmers market to their own restaurant on ingersoll, so proud of them. Then a quick fire for nostalgia: THAI FLAVORS, ZOMBIE BURGER SHAKES, PHO REAL, LA MIE, ALOHANA, LZAZA, AKEBONO 515, MYABI 9 (closed now MASAO).

CAFES in general but specifically DAISY CHAIN and that man Dan. SMOKEY ROW(DT) for its environment and crappy furniture. SLOW DOWN and how Drew has created community there. HAPPY HOME COFFEE because they are good friends. HORIZON LINE cannot be forgotten. Lastly a cafe I wish I went to more is MAYALU!

BARS even though I’m not a huge drinker I do love a good atmosphere. In dsm those places were HELLO MARJORIE, BLACK SHEEP, BARTENDERS HANDSHAKE, THE LIFT, ERNIES, CARLS, COPPER CUP, and BAR 85. Cannot forget THE CAVE + PURVEYOR for a wine night.

I miss EVENTS like the IOWA STATE FAIR, FARMERS MARKET, LATINO FESTIVAL, ASAIN FESTIVAL (not sure the actual name now), WORLD FOOD FEST, 80/35 (rip), FIRST FRIDAYS at MAINFRAME, any event put on by DSMFLEA, and any event going on in the EAST VILLAGE from PRIDE to PROTEST. EAST VILLAGE will always be a special place to me.

I’m sure I missed a bunch of things but just reflecting on what I miss about my hometown and hoping to give it some light here for others to try out!

Place your paw in my palm. Retract your claws, for this is a safe place. Touch me with your eyes, hold me with your mind. Don't simply look at me, but see through me.

Can you feel your heart beat? Can you feel it pace in my presence? Can you feel it quiet down in my embrace?

Can you see all the colors in my irises? Pay attention and you'll see – they aren't just blue. They are sky blue circled with navy, their center is golden yellow fading into lush green. Pay closer attention, look at the filaments within them. Do you see the rivers and the canyons? Do you see the lightning strikes? Stare for a moment and see how they interconnect and intertwine.

And then tell me ""this is nothing"" – what we have. Tell me you don't feel a pit in your stomach at the thought of never being able to claim me *yours*. And then tell me ""time is fleeting"" – and so are we, and you are *fine with it*. 

Or choose to tell me – everything. How you truly care for me. How my skin feels like silk under your fingertips. How my hair smells like coffee and vanilla. How I changed your perspective on things – ultimately on life itself. How you didn't expect to fall but got shaken and fell to your knees. How weak you felt before I made you feel strong.

Just tell me – which of it is it.

But tell me quickly – before I abandon myself to something it's not.

And maybe let me tell you – before you make up your mind...

Let me tell you how your imperfections make you human, relatable. How lovable you are despite it all. Let me tell you I'm neither afraid nor repulsed by you – more the contrary. How I'd want to hug you for as long as you need to feel safe – loved – complete. 

Let me tell you how I'd pour water within your cracks to gently fill them without ever pretending they're not here. Because they always will be – but I can make them beautiful. Let me tell you how I'd mend your heart, always care for it, hold it gently and never drop it. Emphasis on the *always* and *never* – because I truly mean it.

Also let me tell you about the torments within me – and how you bring peace to me. Also about my complexity – and how you make it feel easy. Also about the tears I shed – not *because* of you but *for* you. 

And let us tell them – they were wrong. They didn't see and couldn't understand – what we have, what we are. Let us tell them they were mistaken and blindsided. They thought life was black or white – but we are a rainbow – with an infinity of shades, and so much color. Not all visible – mostly indigo. Let us tell them we won the game – not just the one of ""cat and mouse"".

And let us tell them odds are never in your favor nor against you – they are a quantic concept.

So, tell me... If I open the box – is Schrödinger's cat dead or alive?

With love, care, and devotion – *yours*, if you want it so.",5,1754636539.0,UnsentLetters,2,1.0,False

Let’s be real for a sec.

This might run long. It might wander a bit. That is okay. If you’re the kind of person who feels too much, who thinks too hard at 2:27 a.m., who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly wants something raw and unfiltered maybe this isn’t just a post. Maybe it is a tiny nudge from the universe. A crack in the chaos. A weird little sign you needed and did not know you needed.

I do not think people stumble into our lives by accident. Some test our patience. Some derail us. Some feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways. They arrive and your soul exhales like it has been holding its breath for years. Quietly, something inside whispers, this is what I have been missing.

A bit about me. I am 26. I am a doctor. I am from India. I will not diagnose you unless you sneeze like it is a suspicious side quest and my reflex kicks in.

But I am more than a white coat. I am a loud, proud nerd. Not the Pinterest kind. The type who quotes Marvel lines in conversation. The type still mad about how Interstellar messed with time. The type who loses sleep over fictional deaths and weird sci-fi plot holes.

I fall hard for characters who do not exist. I spiral into thoughts about time, memory, consciousness the casual stuff. Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I am the main character in a noir, solving a case equal parts medicine and existential meltdown. Other times I vanish down rabbit holes about marine biology, quantum reality, or nanotech in surgery because my brain whispers, dig deeper, bro — we are not done yet.

Languages: English, Hindi, Urdu, a bit of Arabic, and I am learning Klingon. Curiosity and chaos run the show up here.

There is a voice in my head. It is not always kind. It is not gentle. But it keeps me going. It says: think harder. Do not settle. Fix what is broken. Show up even when everyone else bails.

It does not care about grades or gold medals. It cares about truth, about purpose. About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world. Why grief hijacks the brain. How trauma gets buried in bones. What we are really chasing under all the noise.

I am not wired for surface-level anything. I need depth. I need meaning. I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.

Right now, what I want is messy and honest.

I want someone real. Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual, hey, like they did not just leave your head spinning. Not someone who opens with, wyd, and ends it with lol. Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations. The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

I want someone who can say, I am not okay today, can we just exist side by side, without feeling like a burden. Someone who hears a lyric and feels it in their ribs. Someone who smells something random and time-travels to a memory they cannot explain. Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes and then goes quiet thinking about stars and why love feels like both a war and a poem.

You do not have to be perfect. Just be human. Just be honest. Just be there.

And right now, I am also asking for a study buddy.

Not one pomodoro and ghost. Not the flakey, let us meet once and vanish kind. I mean consistent. Actually showing up, even virtually.

You do not have to be in medicine. Law, architecture, psychology, astrophysics, studying life any of it counts. Healing counts too.

Imagine this: Midnight hustle. Lo-fi beats or soft rain in the background. Steaming mugs of chai or coffee. Occasional breaks where we drop the dumbest meme or the deepest truth. We keep each other on track. We say, You got this. I am here. We share the random quote that hits too hard. We end the night with a trivia question or a challenge that makes us laugh until our faces hurt.

We show up. We hold space. We get stronger. Together.

Outside study time, let us build a weird little friendship.

Watch movies and psychoanalyze characters like we are their therapists. Swap playlists like we are trading pieces of our souls. Talk about mythologies, multiverses, dreams. Argue whether a villain had a point. Speak in bad accents because life is short. Send voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels too much. Make inside jokes nobody else would get. Make a chaotic, cozy digital home of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos.

Confessions, quick and honest: I have imagined being an X-Men way more than I should. Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting. I have been broken, really broken. But I never stopped showing up. I have walked alone more times than I like. I still hope. I do not want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.

If you are:

A little cracked but still trying

Empathetic but forged by experience

Smart but soft in the ways that matter

Funny but carrying quiet storms

Brilliant in your messy, imperfect chaos


Then maybe this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

If any part of this warmed your chest or made you think, same, send a meme, a lyric, a quote, or a thought. If you want to start practical, let us begin with a study session. I prefer late nights IST, but I am flexible. Tell me your timezone and what helps you study pomodoro, 50/10 focus, or a soft ambient timer.

If you want to slide into DMs first, say hi and tell me one unexpected thing about yourself. I will match honesty for honesty.

Still trying. Still here.

Argue whether a villain had a point. Speak in bad accents because life is short. Send voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels too much. Make inside jokes nobody else would get. Make a chaotic, cozy digital home of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos.

Confessions, quick and honest: I have imagined being an X-Men way more than I should. Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting. I have been broken, really broken. But I never stopped showing up. I have walked alone more times than I like. I still hope. I do not want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.

If you are:

A little cracked but still trying

Empathetic but forged by experience

Smart but soft in the ways that matter

Funny but carrying quiet storms

Brilliant in your messy, imperfect chaos


Then maybe this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

If any part of this warmed your chest or made you think, same, send a meme, a lyric, a quote, or a thought. If you want to start practical, let us begin with a study session. I prefer late nights IST, but I am flexible. Tell me your timezone and what helps you study pomodoro, 50/10 focus, or a soft ambient timer.

If you want to slide into DMs first, say hi and tell me one unexpected thing about yourself. I will match honesty for honesty.

Still trying. Still here.

1mkobui,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1mkobui/realising_im_addicted_to_caffeine/,Realising I'm addicted to caffeine,"Everything is clicking now. The constant anxiety. The racing heart. The compulsive binging on chocolate.

I always thought I just couldn't resist chocolate. Because of the taste  The sugar. If there was chocolate in the house I would always eat it all in one go even if it made me feel sick. I thought it was sugar being addictive, which it is. But I don't have the same problem with cake, confectionary or other sweet things. I can leave them uneaten and not even think about them being there.

It's the caffeine. And I'm realising I don't even like the taste of chocolate as much as I thought. After 30 years of binging on the stuff, and thinking it was my favourite treat.

When I got a job as a Barista many years ago and got unlimited free coffees on shift, I suddenly started having severe panic attacks. I didn't connect it to the caffeine.

But it's so obvious now. It was the caffeine.

And when I started working in an office the tea and coffee flowed all day. I always felt rushed, frantic and stressed.

I thought it was simply how I was. A stressy, anxious person.

Recently, since having my child, I have been really struggling with periods of irritability, fear and anger and stuck in negative thought loops that I can't seem to shake. I'd stay awake in bed feeling so angry over relatively minor things and not wanting to feel angry. Because it felt horrible. And it just wouldn't stop. It felt completely out of my control. I thought I maybe had PPA, and that my hormones were out.

And then there came a day when I wasn't angry and felt completely normal. No anger, no thought loops. I felt relaxed, even cheerful, and the things that had been bothering me for months weren't bothering me at all. And then I realised, I hadn't had any caffeine for over a day. I had been hammering the coffee since my child was born to stay awake through the exhaustion.

And I read about how caffeine affects your adrenals and puts your body into a state of fight or flight and it all began making sense.

This is crazy, that a drug that can affect people so potently is so widely available, in so many foods. And so normalised.

I don't want it any more. Time to find out who I really am without it.

When I was in 6th grade, I went to summer camp and met this boy (we’ll call him M). He was wearing a Spider-Man costume, and I didn’t know who he was, so I thought it’d be funny to flirt with him. We became friends, and later that week we told each other we liked each other. He was literally my first crush/first “anything.”

At the end of camp, he gave me his number, but I threw it away because my family was strict, I didn’t have a phone, and I didn’t want to get in trouble.

About a year later, I made a secret Instagram account and we reconnected. We kind of “online dated” off and on through middle school. He only lived an hour away, but we never met up again. I was obsessed with him all through middle school (like planning-our-wedding obsessed).

In high school, we started talking again and got closer, but then he started pushing for sexual stuff. I wasn’t okay with it, so I’d block him, but I’d always end up going back. Even when I had other boyfriends, I thought about him, and it seemed like he thought about me too.

Junior year, we talked again, but he was way pushier for nudes. I almost sent them, but he went silent. I sent him a long message saying we shouldn’t force something that happened when we were 12, and if it was meant to be, it’d happen naturally. Then I blocked him everywhere.

Senior year, I did an exchange in Korea and started thinking about him less. I got a boyfriend, but when he asked about my exes, I started thinking of M again. I unblocked him just to check his account and found out he’d started dating someone around the time he ghosted me. I forgot to block him again, he followed me, and I spiraled. I blocked him again and tried to move on.

After graduation, my boyfriend and I broke up (long distance wasn’t working). I checked M’s Insta again and didn’t block him this time. He messaged me asking how I was. I hesitated, but my best friend told me to just respond.

He was super flirty right away, hinting at us getting back together. I tried to set boundaries, but I’ve loved him for so long that it’s hard. He invited me to get coffee, and we met at the mall. This was the first time seeing each other in six years.

At first it was awkward. He kept trying to hold my hand, but I kept some distance. We ended up sitting in my car, talking. He was super touchy but promised he wouldn’t kiss me, so i kinda leaned into it. But when I hugged him goodbye, I was scared it was going to be the last time I saw him, so I hugged him for a long time. When we pulled away, we kissed. He then pulled me to the back seat and tried to start more, but I shut it down. I am definitely more open minded than I was, but I didn't want to go too far and then regret it later. 

After that, things escalated over text. A few days later, we met again and I let my walls down. We went further physically than I’d planned, and he told me he loved me. I thought this meant we were actually going to be together.

Butthen that night he kept talking about how good it was and I suggested slowing down on the sexual stuff, he completely changed. He became distant and the next morning said we should just be friends.

Now I’m heartbroken. I’ve loved him for years, and the idea of being “just friends” is killing me. I told him if things really end between us, I’m never speaking to him again because I can’t do the hot-and-cold thing anymore.

He says he feels bad about how far things went when we’re not dating, especially since I’m leaving for college across the country in a few days. I get that, but I’m terrified he’s just going to end up with someone else and ghost me again.

So… is this the love of my life, or do I need to finally let him go?",1,1754635697.0,LifeAdvice,1,1.0,False

I deleted it again after five days. Felt like a total waste of time.

Out of frustration, I tried out a few others. Hinge wasn’t bad, I actually went on two decent dates from there, but it still had that kind of “everyone’s just browsing like it’s a shopping app” vibe. Bumble felt a little more intentional, but I honestly got tired of always having to make the first move. Plus, the responses were sometimes just as lazy as on Tinder.

I’ve heard a lot of people mentioning lesser-known apps lately that aren’t just carbon copies of Tinder. Some folks swear by things like Coffee Meets Bagel or even niche ones like Thursday or Feeld (which sounds intense lol). I'm just trying to find something that feels more human, you know?

To eat lunch in Medellín’s poshest neighborhoods is to be assaulted with the sound of jackhammers. Most of the buildings going up are viviendas turisticas, or “tourist homes,” an emerging style of housing that combines elements of a boutique hotel, a co-living space and a studio apartment.

The short-term rental properties are targeted at the droves of self-described digital nomads who’ve arrived in Colombia from other Latin American countries, Europe and the US since the Covid-19 pandemic. These youngish visitors, most of them under age 45, stay anywhere from a few nights to several months. An estimated 90 viviendas, ranging in cost from $1 million projects with a handful of units to $100 million towers built by major developers, have been constructed or are under construction, according to Growth Lab, a research and consulting company in Medellín owned by Trazos Urbanos SAS, a local developer.

The viviendas share certain key features: large private rooms with bathrooms and kitchenettes; fast internet; design-intensive common spaces; and, very often, planned activities. Starting at about $50 a night, they hit a sweet spot on price and comfort not readily found in other global cities. They also reflect a certain lofty urbanist sensibility shared by their architects, who cut their teeth during an earlier era of the city’s transformation.

“We want someone who can enjoy the place—our culture, the tropics and our local ecology—in a more conscious way,” says Federico Mesa, an architect and co-director of Plan:B, a company that’s wrapping up construction on its third vivienda, Entre Muros, a 22-unit property in the El Poblado neighborhood in a restored mansion once owned by a Medellín clothing magnate. “We know this kind of tourism—and tourist—exists.”

Although co-living spaces and serviced apartments are a staple of global nomad hubs such as Barcelona and Mexico City, Medellín’s viviendas tend to be purpose-built and regulated the way hotels are. They’re the latest expression of a long-term shift in identity for the city, once notorious as the murder capital of the world. Starting in the early 2000s with national government backing, Medellín mounted an ambitious effort to design and build its way out of the brutal cartel violence of the 1980s and ’90s. Young architects including Mesa competed for the chance to put their mark on iconic parks, stunning sports complexes and templelike libraries in hillside barrios once known for warring drug gangs.


That urban renewal, along with improved safety, temperate weather and a weak peso, brought an increasing number of visitors every year. “One day we realized we had no beds,” Mesa says. To meet demand, local residents converted their apartments into Airbnbs, causing rents to skyrocket and aggravating long-standing problems with sex and drug tourism. By 2023 anti-foreigner flyers could be spotted on city streets.

Yet with foreign tourism rising as a key revenue source in Colombia (the sector took in about $10 billion in 2024, almost three times the value of the country’s coffee exports), elected officials have sought to temper the negative effects while keeping visitors coming. Starting in 2020 the country placed strict limits on short-term rentals in residential buildings nationwide, and officials in Medellín came up with clever incentives to push new, purpose-built developments for tourists into neighborhoods less prone to gentrification. That the viviendas are professionally operated and staffed, unlike most Airbnbs, helps deter sex and drug traffic, city tourism officials say.

Los Patios Cool Living, a 51-room brick tower, opened in 2023 in the leafy upscale neighborhood of Laureles. On a pleasant afternoon in June, a wind blew through the cavernous open lobby where guests tapped on computers and played pingpong. “That breeze is intentional,” says architect Juan David Botero of Planta Baja, a company that also designed a 100-room vivienda blocks away. Like other local architects of his generation, Botero considers air conditioning something to be minimized in favor of good airflow, tons of plants and cooling materials such as poured concrete.

As with many of his peers, Botero designed a major public project before working in hospitality: Museo Casa de la Memoria, a museum honoring victims of Medellín’s urban strife. Some of that influence can be felt in Los Patios. Although it boasts comforts including a rooftop bar, gift shop and pool, its rooms and atria are painted in homage to the elaborate murals in the city’s tough outer barrios. A manifesto posted in the lobby proclaims the spirit of the city as “ALWAYS BUILDING NEW AND STARTING OVER.”

All these properties, including the luxurious ones charging $200 per night, sell guests on the chance to feel part of an authentic community. Although most global nomads stay less than a month anywhere, the viviendas like to squeeze the word “living” into their names, as if to distinguish the experience from “staying.” Some cater to specific niches, with bright, Instagram-ready decor and podcasting booths for content creators, or juice bars for fitness types.

“Wellness is where it’s at right now,” says architect Paola Álvarez. Fresh from designing one spa hotel in Laureles, her company, Bassico, is developing MedellINN, a project that was originally conceived as an old-school party hostel and is now being retooled as an oasis for health-conscious guests, particularly women seeking a longer, more immersive stay.

“The hostel business is dying. No one wants to be so close together after Covid, and you need that touch of luxury now to compete,” says Joel Goleburn, a former hostel owner whose four-unit vivienda and coworking space—CHCW House, designed by Plan:B—opened in 2024. With its undulating ceiling of suspended bamboo rods, blond-wood finishings and dramatic spiral staircase, “it just feels wholesome,” Goleburn says, adding that he hasn’t had to advertise; customers find the property on Booking.com and other platforms.

Ads seeking investors—whether to buy individual units or revenue shares from projects—are all over local news and social media. Small and midsize developments are attracting local backers and Americans with ties to Colombia, and bigger ones have lured Asian and European investors as well. Occupancy rates hover around 70%, owners say—on par with Medellín’s hotel sector in recent years. And unlike traditional rentals in which tenants have strong protections, property managers can kick guests out if they need to.

Digital nomads may represent the ideal guest for developers and designers, but at less than 10% of the 1 million-plus foreign visitors now arriving in the city every year, they’re not the viviendas’ sole clientele. The buildings are finding favor not only with foreigners but also with locals, whether relocated employees or newly divorced men. “What appeals to nomads appeals to a lot of people,” says Andrés Giraldo, the director of Growth Lab.

This might run long. It might wander a bit. That is okay. If you’re the kind of person who feels too much, who thinks too hard at 2:27 a.m., who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly wants something raw and unfiltered maybe this isn’t just a post. Maybe it is a tiny nudge from the universe. A crack in the chaos. A weird little sign you needed and did not know you needed.

I do not think people stumble into our lives by accident. Some test our patience. Some derail us. Some feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways. They arrive and your soul exhales like it has been holding its breath for years. Quietly, something inside whispers, this is what I have been missing.

A bit about me. I am 26. I am a doctor. I am from India. I will not diagnose you unless you sneeze like it is a suspicious side quest and my reflex kicks in.

But I am more than a white coat. I am a loud, proud nerd. Not the Pinterest kind. The type who quotes Marvel lines in conversation. The type still mad about how Interstellar messed with time. The type who loses sleep over fictional deaths and weird sci-fi plot holes.

I fall hard for characters who do not exist. I spiral into thoughts about time, memory, consciousness the casual stuff. Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I am the main character in a noir, solving a case equal parts medicine and existential meltdown. Other times I vanish down rabbit holes about marine biology, quantum reality, or nanotech in surgery because my brain whispers, dig deeper, bro — we are not done yet.

Languages: English, Hindi, Urdu, a bit of Arabic, and I am learning Klingon. Curiosity and chaos run the show up here.

There is a voice in my head. It is not always kind. It is not gentle. But it keeps me going. It says: think harder. Do not settle. Fix what is broken. Show up even when everyone else bails.

It does not care about grades or gold medals. It cares about truth, about purpose. About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world. Why grief hijacks the brain. How trauma gets buried in bones. What we are really chasing under all the noise.

I am not wired for surface-level anything. I need depth. I need meaning. I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.

Right now, what I want is messy and honest.

I want someone real. Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual, hey, like they did not just leave your head spinning. Not someone who opens with, wyd, and ends it with lol. Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations. The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

I want someone who can say, I am not okay today, can we just exist side by side, without feeling like a burden. Someone who hears a lyric and feels it in their ribs. Someone who smells something random and time-travels to a memory they cannot explain. Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes and then goes quiet thinking about stars and why love feels like both a war and a poem.

You do not have to be perfect. Just be human. Just be honest. Just be there.

And right now, I am also asking for a study buddy.

Not one pomodoro and ghost. Not the flakey, let us meet once and vanish kind. I mean consistent. Actually showing up, even virtually.

You do not have to be in medicine. Law, architecture, psychology, astrophysics, studying life any of it counts. Healing counts too.

Imagine this: Midnight hustle. Lo-fi beats or soft rain in the background. Steaming mugs of chai or coffee. Occasional breaks where we drop the dumbest meme or the deepest truth. We keep each other on track. We say, You got this. I am here. We share the random quote that hits too hard. We end the night with a trivia question or a challenge that makes us laugh until our faces hurt.

We show up. We hold space. We get stronger. Together.

Outside study time, let us build a weird little friendship.

Watch movies and psychoanalyze characters like we are their therapists. Swap playlists like we are trading pieces of our souls. Talk about mythologies, multiverses, dreams. Argue whether a villain had a point. Speak in bad accents because life is short. Send voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels too much. Make inside jokes nobody else would get. Make a chaotic, cozy digital home of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos.

Confessions, quick and honest: I have imagined being an X-Men way more than I should. Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting. I have been broken, really broken. But I never stopped showing up. I have walked alone more times than I like. I still hope. I do not want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.

If you are:

A little cracked but still trying

Empathetic but forged by experience

Smart but soft in the ways that matter

Funny but carrying quiet storms

Brilliant in your messy, imperfect chaos


Then maybe this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

If any part of this warmed your chest or made you think, same, send a meme, a lyric, a quote, or a thought. If you want to start practical, let us begin with a study session. I prefer late nights IST, but I am flexible. Tell me your timezone and what helps you study pomodoro, 50/10 focus, or a soft ambient timer.

If you want to slide into DMs first, say hi and tell me one unexpected thing about yourself. I will match honesty for honesty.

Still trying. Still here.

    “So, Mr. Thompson, when did you say your nightmares began?” 
    
    Aaron blinked. Just for a second, he was somewhere else—some *when* else, maybe. Not here in Hill Lake Psychiatry, with its perfectly aligned brickwork and those gaudy gold letters that gleamed like teeth in the sunlight. He had walked through those doors 45 minutes ago, desperate for clarity, or at least a name for the thing that had begun to slither its way back into his sleep. The fear in those nightmares eroded his lust for sleep. Nowadays, he was happy to be an insomniac, at least he wouldn’t have to see those eyes anymore, those purple shaded eyes.
    
    It wasn’t just the dreams, however, it was who was in them. A man—but not really a man—something older, deeper, colder. He wore death like a second skin
    
    He hadn’t seen them in years. Not since... that summer. The summer that carved a scar so deep across his memory, even time couldn’t stitch it shut. And now here he was, miles away, hiding in the sleepy fog of Hill Lake, Utah, as if geography could outpace guilt.
    
    “Mr. Thompson?”The doctor’s voice yanked him back like a fishhook through the cheek. Aaron jerked in his seat, blinking the fog away.
    
    “Sorry, doctor.”
    
    “No, no. It’s all right, what were you thinking about?”
    
    “My old friends.”
    
    “Good memories?”
    
    “The best.” Of course it was a lie. The truth lived somewhere darker. It gnawed at him from the inside out, a thing with yellow eyes and too many teeth. He couldn’t say it out loud. Didn’t want to. Didn’t want to feed it. Because it was *still* there—*he* was still there—just below the surface of his thoughts. Aaron could remember almost everything. A few details had eroded like chalk in the rain, sure... but the rest? The rest was sharp as broken glass.
    
    “Mr. Thompson, I would like to try an exercise with you.” The doctor’s voice was calm — too calm, like a radio host introducing a midnight show no one listens to, except the dead. He placed his clipboard down on the marble table between them with an almost reverent care. The clipboard made a dull *thunk*, and Aaron flinched at the sound. Aaron glanced up, brow furrowed. The man’s expression didn’t waver — that professional half-smile, too practiced to be real.
    
    “An exercise?”, Aaron echoed, voice low, wary.
    
    “Yes”, the doctor said, steepling his fingers now. “There are places in the subconscious… locked rooms, if you will. Yours are linked to your trauma, and I believe we might be able to access them. I want to try hypnotherapy.”
    
    Aaron blinked. “Hypno-what now?”
    
    “Hypnotherapy”, the doctor repeated, with the same soft tone you’d use on a skittish dog.“I’m no magician, Mr. Thompson. No swinging watches or carnival tricks. But I’ve used this method before — with patients who carried their pain like lead inside them. It’s completely safe.” He said it like a promise.
    
    Aaron sat back. The room suddenly felt colder, like someone had cracked a window he couldn’t see. He could hear the faint ticking of a clock on the wall behind him — slow and steady, a sound that had been swallowed by silence until now. He looked at the doctor — really *looked* — and for a moment there was something in the man’s eyes. Not warmth. Not concern. Hunger, maybe?
    
    But it passed, like a shadow of a bird flying over the sun. Gone too fast to be sure it had ever been there at all. Aaron hesitated. The silence stretched. Thickened.He raised his eyes slowly, gaze landing on the doctor. Not hope, not quite, more like surrender.
    
    “Alright, I’ll try it.”
    
    “Excellent!”, the doctor nearly *chirped*, his voice higher now, too cheerful — like a father playing a game he knew his child would lose. He stood from his oak chair, went around to his desk where his computer resided, opened a drawer, closed the drawer, and came out with a weird looking device. It was six steel balls on a string. The doctor placed it gently on the marble table between them, lifted one ball on one side, and he let it fall. It connecting with the others, causing them to rythmically clash against one another. 
    
    *Click-clack.*

*Click-clack.*

*Click-clack.*

    “Alright,” the doctor said, his voice softer now, smoothing out like water over stone. “I want you to lie down on the couch. Just... relax.” Aaron did as he was told. He sat on the couch, the leathery cushions making loud noises as Aaron adjusts to be comfortable. When he found a spot he laid there with his eyes on the ceiling. “Good,” the doctor whispered. “Now... concentrate on my voice. That’s all. Let the rest fall away. Just you, and me... and the sound.”
    
    *Click-clack.*

*Click-clack.*

“Breathe in... slow. Good. Now out. There you go.”

    Aaron let go. His body started to relax a lot, his thoughts became smoke. He floated in that liminal space between waking and sleep — where the monsters in your dreams crawl closest to your ear. 
    
    Then-a voice. Not the doctors. “*Come baaack to meeeee, Aaronnnn...*” That *voice*. Wet, breathy, rotted at the edges. It oozed into his mind like mold in the walls. “*Commeee baaackkk.*”
    
    His body jerked violently upright, as if ripped from the inside. A cry caught in his throat, and for a terrifying moment, *nothing* came — no air, no sound, only ice and pressure, like a fist closing around his lungs. He clawed at his chest. He couldn’t breathe. Then — *gasp* — air tore through his throat, and it was freezing, like breathing in a mouthful of snowmelt. The doctor was suddenly there beside him, hands out but not quite touching, like someone unsure whether they should comfort or restrain.
    
    “A-are you alright?”  the doctor asked, though the words were hollow, distant — like a recording played back through an old tape deck. Aaron stared at him.
    
    “I-I’m fine”, Aaron tried to say, but the words clung to his throat like cobwebs soaked in glue. He mouthed them more than spoke them—just the shape of syllables on his lips, no sound, no breath. The doctor waited in silence. After a few long seconds, Aaron exhaled, shaky and shallow. The air slithered back into his lungs, warm now, though it burned like it had been dragged through ice. His throat loosened. He could breathe again. Speak again. But he didn’t want to. Not now. No way in hell he was trying *that* again. He stayed on the couch this time, sinking deeper into the stiff leather, as if the cushions might offer some kind of protection. They didn’t.
    
    The doctor didn’t sit. Instead, he walked slowly across the room, the click of his shoes sounding louder than they should’ve on the tile—like nails on bone. He came to a stop in front of his wall of accolades: diplomas in expensive frames, photos of smiling colleagues, a black-and-white photo of a younger version of himself shaking hands with someone important, both of them frozen in amber smiles.
    
    The doctor stood there a moment too long. Just staring. Then his voice came, quiet and flat. “Your youth, I’m safe to assume it was troubling?” 
    
    Aaron blinked at him, his throat still raw. “Yeah, I’d say so. Lots of trouble.”
    
    The doctor’s head tilted slightly, as if listening for something behind the wall. “Would you like to elaborate?”
    
    “No, I’m ok. I don’t want to talk about anything from there.” Aaron watched him, something sour twisting in his gut.
    
    “Not even…the mine?”
    
    Aaron stood, slowly. His knees stiff, his breath shallow. The air in the room felt... *wrong*. Like a sealed basement just before the mildew hits your nose. Like something was *behind* the walls, listening.
    
    Aaron’s demeanor changed, he wasn’t relaxed anymore. “How do you know about that?” In all the years Aaron has been coming to this particular doctor he’s never spoke about the mine, not once. Not to any doctor really. The only people who knew that Aaron was there were the others who were there as well. No mention of them on the news, no mention on the radio, nothing.
    
    “I know.” 
    
    Aaron tensed up. The only ones who knew were them and that monster. Oh god. The realization hit him like a truck at a million miles per hour. He felt the vomit catching in his throat, or was it fear?
    
    “I knowwwww, Aaron, I wasss thereee tooo.” The voice was different now, a happy gurgling came from the doctor. He turned around, the first thing Aaron noticed was his eyes, a deep purple shine, his teeth grinning widely. The doctor took a step forward. “I’m going to kill you”, another step, “I’m going to eat you alive”, another, “I’m going to rip you to SHREDSSS!!” This time he lunged at Aaron, luckily he was on the couch and not a chair, he dodged the lunge and sprinted for the door taking one look behind him. The room was empty. Not even taking the chance, Aaron bolted out the door and into his car. He drove, but for some reason he wasn’t driving home, not the home he made in Hill Lake, his home in Wespin. 
    
    He made it as far as Salt Lake. The fear not once dissipated. His instincts not once let up. Not even when he paid for his ticket, got on the 4 p.m. train, and departed towards Wespin. The low rumbling of the train nearly sent him to sleep, he didn’t want to sleep, not even a wink. Sleeping meant he would relive those moments. Those moments. However, his brain didn’t care for what he wanted. The drive to Salt Lake took a lot out of him and he couldn’t keep his eyes open for long. 
    
    Then a voice, a soft recognizable voice came from his left. He looked over but only saw sleeping passengers, then it came again to his right, out the window. The voice seemed to carry a sleepy weight. Like with each word, his eyelids got heavier and heavier. Then his mind drifted off, off to those days, then the voice’s words became clearer and clearer. 
    
    “Aaron”, it said in an urgent tone. “Get up.” By the time Aaron realized who the voice belonged too, he was already fast asleep. The voice, getting more impatient, then-Then…

2

He jerked upright like a man shot in a dream, the remnants of sleep clinging to his eyes like cobwebs. For a moment, everything was soft and smudged — the edges of the room blurred, light leaking in from the slats in the blinds like fingers creeping across the floor. Then the shape at the foot of his bed came into focus. A figure. A woman. Tapping her foot like a jackhammer on linoleum.

    It was his mother. Of course it was. Natalie Thompson — lean, tired, with her hair tied back in a rubber band she probably found in the junk drawer. Her arms crossed, lips pressed into a flat line.
    
    “You finally awake?” she asked, the kind of question that wasn’t really a question. Her voice had the usual early-morning rasp, somewhere between anger and coffee-deprived impatience. Aaron leapt out of bed like a startled cat, his heel catching on the blanket. The floor greeted him with a loud *CRACK!* as his bare feet slapped down. He teetered for a second, arms pinwheeling, then caught himself just before eating the floorboards. He turned to look at her — maybe to laugh it off, maybe to apologize — but she was already gone, her silhouette disappearing through the cracked door. Left behind in her wake was the smell of breakfast, thick and warm and comforting, like something out of a memory.
    
    Bacon. Pancakes. Eggs — a little overdone, probably, but still good. The kind of breakfast that tried to say everything was okay, even if it wasn’t. Aaron dressed in a hurry, yanking on his jeans and grabbing a crumpled shirt from the laundry chair — everyone has a laundry chair — then made a beeline for his desk. He scooped a handful of quarters from a Mason jar labeled *Arcade Money* in crooked Sharpie. He liked the feel of the coins in his hand. It made him feel prepared for the day. Like armor. 
    
    In the kitchen, his mom was already deep in her routine. Tank top, jogging shorts — standard Natalie. She liked to run after dropping Aaron at school, a ritual she never missed unless it was raining sideways. Then it was yoga in the den, muttering curses at YouTube instructors under her breath. She flipped a pancake with a practiced hand while the radio played on low in the background — 100.3, the Wespin women’s gospel of midday gossip, oldies, and the occasional inspirational quote of the day. She couldn’t remember the last time she’d listened to anything else, and frankly, she didn’t care. Stability was a kind of music, too.
    
    She slid a plate in front of Aaron without looking — pancakes, eggs, and a slice of ham. She would’ve added grits if they had any, but they were out. Her husband was supposed to grab some two nights ago, but late shifts at the mill meant late dinners and even later trips to the grocery store. Still, she loved him. Tired, forgetful, overworked and underpaid — but she loved him. Life wasn’t perfect. But it was breakfast, and sometimes, that was enough.
    
    Aaron thanked his mom as he grabbed his Trapper Keeper and made for the front door, Walkman clipped to his jeans and headphones around his neck. “Wait!” she called out. He paused, hand on the doorknob. She was standing there in her robe, one of those pastel terrycloth ones she’d had since the Bicentennial, arm outstretched like a mannequin left mid-pose. A brown paper bag dangled from her fingers, grease starting to spot through at the bottom. “Don’t forget your lunch,” she said, not looking at him. Her eyes were somewhere over his shoulder, somewhere far past the kitchen walls, like she was seeing something only she could see.
    
    “But mom…”, Aaron tried, shifting his weight. The bag felt like a third-grade science project. She didn’t say anything else. Just stayed there, frozen, arm rigid like she was waiting for a director to yell cut. Aaron sighed and took the lunch bag. The bag crinkled in his grip. Bologna again, he could already tell. He stuffed it in his bookbag on his way out. 
    
    He stepped out the door. Just as the screen creaked shut behind him, he heard her voice float after him in a low, hollow tone, like it’d been recorded on an old cassette and left out in the sun too long: “I love you.” He didn’t answer. Just pulled his jacket tighter around him and jogged toward the corner, high-tops slapping the pavement.
    
    The bus was already there, its engine chugging like a chain smoker and that telltale puff of blue exhaust drifting out the back. The doors had started to close, slow as molasses. He jumped the last few steps and made it — just in time for the driver, a gray-haired guy in aviators who smelled like stale coffee and menthols, to grunt and jerk a thumb toward the back. 
    
    Aaron climbed aboard to a blast of warm air and bad deodorant. Music leaked from a dozen headphones — Madonna, Run-D.M.C., Phil Collins. The floor was sticky from someone's spilled Big Gulp, and there was a faint trace of grape Bubble Yum in the air. He moved down the aisle, scanning for a seat, his backpack bouncing off the vinyl-covered arms of kids he didn’t know. Most faces were turned toward the windows, sun glaring off neon scrunchies and tinted shades.
    
    There. One open seat, second from the back. He started toward it—
    
    A hand shot out, gripping his sleeve and pulling him off balance. He staggered a little, nearly dropping his Walkman. The hand was pale, sinewy, and strong. He looked up. A black shirt with a cracked and faded *Ride the Lightning* print, the electric chair right over the chest like a warning sign.
    
    Benjamin Trowler.
    
    Aaron’s stomach dropped. Something about the way Benjamin looked at him — not angry, not even mean — just *decided* — said more than words ever could. This wasn’t Aaron’s seat. Not now. Not ever. He didn’t argue. 
    
    Who was Benjamin Trowler? He was a violent kid. As violent as they come. He’s been to *real* jail before, not just juvie, though he did do a couple stints there. He went to real jail for nearly killing a kid in Nebraska for saying his shirt was for losers. It took five adults to get him off the kid but by that time, the kid was barely alive. Benjamin then spent four years in jail but got out in eight months for good behavior. His parents then moved to Wespin this past summer. He was supposed to start sixth grade all over again but his parents talked to the principal and got him to advance on. 
    
    Aaron was in fifth grade when Benjamin Trowler came to his school. Rumors about him circled around the whole summer. “A murderer is coming here!” Some would say around town, “Stay away from him!” Others would repeat. It was the same everywhere, even adults would say those things about him. “I heard his mother was a whore! She would sleep around with other men, who knows who his father is.” Aaron never paid *too* much attention to those rumors. 
    
    Aaron moved along and found an empty seat further along down. He sat next to Rickety Craig. A kid with tourette syndrome who would lick his fingers in a certain order within a certain time frame. Somewhere, a few rows ahead of him, Benjamin laughed once, low and lazy.
    
    The bus made its slow crawl through town, swallowing corners and coughing up exhaust as it rattled down cracked blacktop and past rows of tired homes with peeling paint and aluminum mailboxes dangling on rusted hinges. Last stop before the school was always Milton Road — a stretch of nothing that meant something, even if nobody said it out loud. Milton Road was famous for exactly one thing: the mine. 
    
    Abandoned since the ‘40s, long before Aaron was born, but not forgotten. Not by a long shot. The old-timers still talked about it, sometimes after a few beers at Vern’s Tavern.
    
    A couple streets later, the school came into view — boxy, brick, and grim like all schools built before disco died. The bus screeched to a halt, the brakes giving off that familiar banshee wail, and the kids stood like they always did, single file, sleepy-eyed and already halfway out of their minds with boredom or dread. The driver — Ron, or maybe Ray, Aaron wasn’t sure anymore — sat behind the wheel like a wax figure in a greasy uniform. He grunted vaguely at the stream of “Thanks,” “See ya’s,” and “Later, man”s, never looking up. You could’ve sworn he wasn’t actually *there* sometimes. Like he was just part of the bus. An old fixture. Something left running.
    
    His last class of the day was English, and yeah, it was his favorite. Not because Aaron had any great love for Shakespeare or dangling participles — hell no. It was the *quiet* he liked. The kind of deep, dead quiet that made you feel like you were underwater. The kind where you could almost hear the fluorescent lights buzzing above your head if you held still enough. That quiet had a name, too: Mrs. Duttle.
    
    She wasn’t tall, and she wasn’t loud, but Mrs. Duttle didn’t *need* to be either. She had a presence — capital P — like a librarian in a haunted house. Wire-framed glasses that magnified her eyes just enough to make them unnerving, lips always painted a dusty rose, and a spine so straight it looked like it had been reinforced with steel. She ran her class like a submarine — tight ship, zero tolerance. Talking was a mortal sin, whispering a capital offense. And if someone broke the rule? Out. No debate. No second chances.
    
    Benjamin Trowler, of course, had made a career out of breaking that rule. It was never anything obvious — no shouting, no swearing. That wasn’t Benjamin’s style. He was a *needler*, the kind of kid who took pleasure in death by a thousand cuts. Low giggles from the back row, wet *ptoo!* sounds when a spitball flew like a sniper round toward the back of Brian Nol’s neck. You could practically set your watch to it. Brian would twitch, Benjamin would snicker, and Mrs. Duttle — who somehow *always* knew — would slowly rise from behind her desk, spine clicking like a clock winding up.
    
    “Out, Mr. Trowler,” she’d say, voice colder than the AC vent. And he’d go. Grinning. Always grinning. Like getting kicked out was the game, and he was winning. Aaron just kept his head down. Eyes on his desk, pencil in hand, ears tuned to the silence. Because in Mrs. Duttle’s room, silence wasn’t just expected — it was sacred. A kind of armor against the rest of the world. Against whatever weird thing was waiting out there past Milton Road. Against whatever followed you in through the school doors on days when the sky looked a little too gray.
    
    And in that silence, for forty-seven blessed minutes, Aaron could almost pretend everything was normal. Almost.
    
    Brian Nol sat two seats over from Aaron, and had all year long. The kid was like a shadow — there, but easy to forget unless you were looking right at him. Always quiet. Always still. Like a mannequin someone had dressed up in flannel and jeans and dropped into the room when no one was looking. Aaron had seen him talk to other kids in the halls, maybe even smile once or twice near the vending machines. But in class? Nothing. Not a word. Just silence. The kind of silence that didn’t beg for attention — it just *was*. 
    
    Aaron didn’t mind. He wasn’t much of a talker himself. Never had been. After class, he didn’t hang around the other kids, didn’t flirt with the girls loitering by their lockers or shoot the breeze by the trophy case. He had places to be — *important* places — like the arcade off Main Street. That place with the flickering “OPEN” sign, sticky floors, and the smell of burnt popcorn always lingering in the air. Where the machines hummed like living things and the glow of the CRT screens was better than sunshine.
    
    To get there faster, Aaron always cut through the courtyard. It shaved five, maybe ten minutes off the walk if you knew where to jump the fence. But it also meant passing right by the mouth of the abandoned mine. Most kids didn’t go that way. Too many stories.
    
    So when class let out and Aaron pushed through the double doors into the courtyard, hands stuffed in his jacket pockets and mind already on how many quarters he had left in his wallet, the *last* thing he expected was to hear footsteps behind him — fast, then slowing. He turned, it was Brian. Not smiling. Not saying anything yet. Just… there. Like he’d materialized from the brick walls themselves. His backpack hung from one shoulder, and his face looked pale in the overcast afternoon light. Aaron stopped walking. “Uh… hey?”
    
    Brian looked at him — not nervous, not excited. Just serious. Like he’d been building up to this moment for longer than Aaron could guess.
    
    “Hi, I’m Brian, we have the same English class together, you know?” Brian stood there with his lightning backpack over his stomach. It reminded Aaron of something but he couldn’t place it. 
    
    “Yeah, I remember.” 
    
    “I was wondering if you’d want to come by the library, you know?” The library? Aaron didn’t even give the thought a chance.
    
    “Um, no thanks, I’m heading to the arcade instead.” He was curious at the suggestion. “Why the library?” Brian was already turning to head in that direction, he spun his head back to Aaron.
    
    “I…well…you know…” 
    
    “You say “You know” a lot don’t you?”
    
    “Sorry,” Brian said, rubbing the back of his neck like it was a nervous tic baked into his DNA. “It’s something I can’t help doing, you know?” There it was again — *you know.* Like a verbal twitch, something cracked and nervous hiding under all his words. Aaron didn’t answer right away. His fingers dipped into his left pocket, tracing the edges of the quarters he’d stashed there earlier. He felt their cold weight — four of them, maybe five. Enough for a good hour at the arcade. Maybe longer if he stuck to *Galaga* and avoided *Dragon’s Lair*. And yet… he didn’t move. He was actually considering it.
    
    Not just *going* to the library — which, let’s be honest, was already weird enough for a Thursday afternoon — but *whether it felt right*. Like there was something in the air between them, something humming underneath the skin of the day. That low, invisible pressure you get before a summer storm hits — when the birds go quiet and the sky turns the color of old bruises.
    
    *Go with this kid*, something in him whispered. *Talk. Try. Be normal for once. Make a friend.*
    
    It reminded him of something his mom said a few weeks ago. Something offhand, half-said while she was folding towels and smoking one of her menthols by the sink. “Honey, you gotta make friends or else you’ll die lonely.”
    
    Aaron blinked. Wait… was that right? Would she even *say* something like that?
    
    It didn’t sound like her — at least not the *her* he wanted to remember. But the line was lodged in his brain like a splinter, specific and sharp, and no matter how many times he tried to rephrase it, it came out the same way. Deadpan. Almost cruel. Like something whispered just before you wake up from a bad dream. Before he could dig into it any deeper, Brian broke the silence. 
    
    “It’s okay,” he said. “You can come another time.” Then he turned and walked off — that same loping, unsure stride, backpack bouncing against his spine like a metronome. Aaron didn’t follow.
    
    He could’ve.
    
    Should’ve. But he didn’t.
    
    And years later, when the town had changed, when kids whispered about things that crawled out of dark places and memories they didn’t trust, Aaron would think back to that day — to the soft *clink* of quarters in his pocket, the smell of distant rain on concrete, and Brian’s voice fading into the air like a signal from a station just out of reach. He wished he had gone, God he wished he had gone.
    
    Winter break was just three days away, and Aaron was counting down like it was the end of a prison sentence. He’d already made his plans — or *plan*, singular — which was to spend as much time as humanly possible in the arcade down on Main, the one with the flickering sign and the duct tape holding the change machine together. It wasn’t much, but it was his.
    
    Christmas was his favorite holiday, no question about it. The lights, the music, the way the whole world felt like it was wrapped in some kind of glittery magic. He loved the gifts, sure — what kid didn’t? — but he hated the snow. Hated how it crept in overnight like a quiet enemy and ruined everything. Whenever it snowed too heavy, the arcade would close up, its metal gate rolled down like a tongue sticking out of a dead mouth. No blinking lights, no beeps or bloops, no escape.
    
    And on those days, Aaron had nothing. No friends to pelt with snowballs. No one to trade gifts with or laugh about dumb TV specials. Just him. Alone with himself and the silence. But today? Today the sky held. Gray, yeah, but dry. And that meant the arcade would be open, warm and humming and waiting for him like a neon temple.
    
    After Brian walked off — disappearing into the distance like a ghost nobody asked for — Aaron turned toward his destination. The shortcut. Through the courtyard, over the fence, past the edge of that no-man’s-land where the mine entrance sat buried under weeds and legend.
    
    He could hear the change rattling in his pocket, jingling with every step. *Spend me!* they seemed to say. *Use me! Win the tickets! Grab the grand prize!* 
    
    “I sure will!” Aaron said aloud, more to the coins than to himself, his voice bright and cartoonish for just a second. Like he was trying to sell himself the dream. He'd never gotten the grand prize. Not once.
    
    Oh, he’d tried. Piled up tickets like a squirrel storing acorns. Spent hours at *Whack-A-Mole*, *Skee-Ball*, and that broken-down claw machine that hadn’t actually picked up anything heavier than a gum wrapper since '83. He wasn’t *bad* at arcade games — just never good enough. Never lucky enough. Always a little too slow, or a hair too early. The jackpot was always just out of reach, blinking at him like it knew.
    
    Still, he kept coming back. Because somewhere in all those lights and sounds, in that room full of bad carpet and better memories, there was *something*. Not a grand prize, maybe. But something else. And maybe today would be the day he found it.
    
    Aaron was so caught up in the jingling chorus of his pocket — the coins singing out their little arcade dreams — that he didn’t realize where he was heading. He was grinning, talking to himself like a loon, imagining tickets flying and sirens going off and some blinking jackpot light finally, *finally* shining for him. Then his toe slammed into a rock. Reality crashing down like a plane with one wing off. He yelped, grabbing at his foot like it had betrayed him, and stumbled back—then froze.
    
    His breath caught. Not like a gasp — more like someone had reached into his lungs and just… turned them off. Because he was there. *There*. 
    
    The mine entrance. The one place everyone knew but nobody talked about. The one with the sagging fence and the collapsed “KEEP OUT” sign hanging by a single nail. The path he only ever skirted, never *approached*. And now he stood less than ten feet from it, with the opening yawning like the mouth of a dead god.
    
    His feet wouldn’t move. Concrete. No — *ice*. They were blocks of *ice*. He couldn’t have lifted them if someone screamed in his ear. 
    
    “*Hellooooo.”* It was a whisper. A whisper from somewhere he wished it didn’t come from. The whispering came from inside. “*Do you wissshhhhh tooooo playyyy?”* Then another horrifying realization dawned on him, the voice was coming closer. The first whisper sounded impossibly miles away, now it was only feet away. “*I wannnttt tooo playyyy.”* Now it sounded so close he could feel the breath wafting from the darkness-sour and wet and awful, like the inside of an old refrigerator filled with meat gone bad. And then… “*Let’ssss playyyyy.”* In an instant Aaron recognized who the voice was coming from, or rather what.
    
    The flesh on the face was rotten so bad you could see its teeth poking out on each side. Two rows of razor sharp teeth filled its jaws. The clothes looked watery and rotten. Its eyes, a bright purple haze, filled with hunger. It bolted towards Aaron, him grabbing the change he had in his hand and throwing them at the monster, at the-at the-ZOMBIE!! Yes, of course, it looked straight out of a zombie film, but it talked, how could it have talked?
    
    Aaron screamed. Not loud, not heroic. A cracked, panicked sound that barely made it past his lips. He didn’t think — just grabbed the coins in his fist and hurled them at the thing’s face.

Clink. Clink. Clink.

    One struck the creature right above the eye. It hissed — or laughed — he couldn’t tell which. He didn’t wait to find out.

 	He ran, oh he ran and ran until he made it to Withchell street, three blocks away from the entrance. From that *Thing*. Once he caught his breath he didn’t stop until he got home. He bolted to his room and shut his door. His breathing started to calm a bit. That’s when he saw it. His breathing got faster now. On his nightstand next to his bed was some change. The same change he threw. A whistling filled his ears, he wanted to scream, to…to…",1,1754634769.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False

This might run long. Might wander a bit.
But that’s okay.
Because if you’re the kind of person who feels a little too much, who thinks way too deeply during those brutally quiet 2:27 a.m. hours, who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly just wants something raw and unfiltered...then maybe this isn’t just a post.

Maybe it’s a tiny nudge from the universe.
A crack in the chaos.
A weird little sign that this might be your leap of faith.
One you didn’t know you needed, until now.

Because I don’t believe people stumble into our lives by mistake.
Some show up to test our patience.
Some derail us, turn everything upside down.
But then...
Some just feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways.
They arrive, and your soul exhales like it’s been holding its breath for years.
And quietly, something inside you whispers.. this, this is what I’ve been missing.

So hey,

I’m 26. I’m a doctor. From India.

But I’m more than a white coat and a stethoscope.
I’m a loud and proud nerd.

The “quotes random Marvel lines in conversations” kind.
The “still mad about how Interstellar messed with time” kind.

I fall hard for characters that don’t exist.

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a bit of Arabic (barely enough to survive a desert trip).
Oh, and I’m learning Klingon. Because curiosity and chaos kind of run the show up here.

Now there’s this voice in my head.

It isn’t always kind.
It’s definitely not gentle.
But damn, it keeps me going.

It says:
Think harder.
Don’t settle.
Fix what’s broken.
Show up even when everyone else bails.

It doesn’t care about grades or gold medals or what some fancy LinkedIn profile says.
It cares about truth. About purpose.
About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world.
Why grief hijacks the brain.
How trauma gets buried in bones.
What we’re really chasing under all this noise.

I’m not wired for surface-level anything. Never was.
I need depth. I need meaning.
I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.


---

So what am I even looking for?

Let’s keep it messy and honest.
I want someone real.

Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual “hey” like they didn’t leave your head spinning.
Not someone who opens with “wyd” and ends it with “lol.”
Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations.
The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

Someone who says, “I’m not okay, can we just exist side by side today?” without feeling like a burden.
Someone who hears a lyric and feels it deep in their ribs.
Someone who smells something random and suddenly time-travels back to a memory they can’t explain.
Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes, then goes quiet thinking about souls, stars, and why love always feels like both a war and a poem.

You don’t have to be perfect.
Just be human.
Just be honest.
Just... be there.


---

But let’s get even more specific.
Right now?
I want a study buddy.

Not the “let’s do one pomodoro and ghost each other for eternity” type.
Nope. I’m talking real. Consistent.
Like, actually showing up even virtually.

You don’t have to be in medicine.
You could be studying law, architecture, psychology, space dust, or just... life.
You could be healing. That counts too.

I want someone I can sit with  virtually while we both fight our own dragons.
No pressure to talk all the time. Just be in the same digital space. Two people grinding. Growing.

Imagine it 
Midnight hustle.
Lo-fi beats or soft rain sounds in the back.
Steaming mugs of chai or coffee.
Occasional breaks where we drop either the dumbest memes or the deepest truths.

We keep each other on track.
We say, “You got this. I’m here.”
We share that random quote that hits way too hard.
We remind each other why we started.

Maybe we make it fun 
Send a quote before we begin.
End the night with a trivia game or a challenge that makes us laugh till our faces hurt.
Doesn’t matter how.
As long as we grow. Together.

And who knows?
Maybe this study session... maybe this is our shared leap of faith.
The one that keeps us grounded when the world feels too loud.


---

Outside study time though?

Let’s build a weird little friendship.

Watch movies and analyze characters like we’re their therapists
Share playlists like we’re swapping pieces of our soul
Talk about mythologies, science, dreams, multiverses
Argue over which villain actually had a point
Speak in bad Russian or British accents because life’s too short for dignity
Send random voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels a bit too much
Make inside jokes that no one else would ever get
Create a chaotic but cozy digital home made of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos


---

And just a few confessions to keep it real:

I’ve imagined being an X-Men way more than I should probably admit
Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting for me
I’ve been broken. Really broken. But I never stopped showing up
I’ve walked alone more times than I’d like. Still do. But I haven’t stopped hoping
I don’t want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.
I want someone who knows how to sit in silence and still be there fully.


---

So if you’re:

A little cracked but still trying your best
Empathetic but forged of inner steel
Smart but soft in the ways that matter
Funny but carrying some quiet storms
Brilliant in your own messy, imperfect chaos

Then maybe just maybe  this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

This is my leap.
No filters. No flex.
Just me. Honest. Tired. Still dreaming.

So if any part of this made your chest warm or your brain go, same,
Send a meme. A quote. A lyric. A thought. Anything.

And if nothing else?

Let’s start with a study session.
Two nerds in different corners... 
Screens glowing. Hearts open. Minds focused.

Showing up.
Holding space.
Getting stronger.

Together.

Because in the end we’re all just stories trying to make sense of ourselves.

Let’s make this one a damn good one.

Still trying.
Still here.

Because if you’re the kind of person who feels a little too much, who thinks way too deeply during those brutally quiet 2:27 a.m. hours, who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly just wants something raw and unfiltered...then maybe this isn’t just a post.

A crack in the chaos.
A weird little sign that this might be your leap of faith.
One you didn’t know you needed, until now.

Some show up to test our patience.
Some derail us, turn everything upside down.

And quietly, something inside you whispers.. this, this is what I’ve been missing.

# [1.1 A preface to the preface]()

Life looked a bit different in 2009. As a young pediatrician, I felt like the king of the world. I was about to start my second residency in infectious diseases and thought I was invincible.

Then came that phone call. It wasn't even meant for me.

The call was between Prof. P.Y. and Prof. D.G. At its core was P.Y.'s need to find a replacement lecturer for the parasitology course for second-year medical students, due to Prof. Y.A.'s imminent retirement. P.Y., who was then the head of the medical school, saw he was in trouble and immediately called the least suitable person for the task. He knew very well that D.G. was lazy and knew nothing about parasites, but he also knew very well that he could impose anything he wanted on D.G., and D.G. had no means of resistance.

I was casually passing through the corridor next to D.G.'s room, where I constantly hung out. A silly smile on my lips and a deep need to read another 500 unnecessary pages in Feigin or Mandell (the textbooks for infectious diseases in children and adults, respectively). I had no idea how my life was about to change completely.

I could hear snippets of the conversation. It was clear D.G. was in distress, and the hundred-kilo hammer on his head was causing him slight discomfort. Then the unbelievable happened. Deus ex machina. D.G. spotted my clumsy figure dancing in the hallway and immediately jumped up – ""Shalom, you have a phone call."" The idiot that is me immediately replied, ""No problem,"" took the receiver, and brought it to my ear. ""Yes, P.Y., what's up?"" The end.

I won't bore you with the details. P.Y. commanded me, in the most polite and friendly tone he could muster, to attend a meeting with Y.A. in the parasitology lab to replace him in delivering the course in question.

A week later, I was walking happily and light-heartedly, with septol in my eye (don't ask) that made me grimace and look like a pervert, on my way to the pathology building. On the second floor, in the parasitology lab, Prof. Y.A. was waiting for me.

It's worth understanding a few basic things about the situation at that time:

* I have just finished my pediatrics residency. My knowledge of parasitology was close to zero and included memories of missing a class or two due to military reserve duty and my father's memorial service. That's it.
* Parasites sounded to me like something related to bizarre jungle diseases. Something with swollen testicles and terrifying pictures of worms peeking out of all sorts of holes and orifices in the body. (Yes, I know I was stupid, and I hope it's mostly passed).
* Prof. Y.A. didn't know me at all, certainly didn't remember me from my student days (a grade of 85 in the course, thanks for asking).
* My professional aspirations were limited to completing my infectious diseases residency; I was happy to be the youngest and most enthusiastic in the group.
* I had no teaching experience at all and only a vague idea in my head of what I wanted to say in the conversation.

I entered the room. Y.A. offered me coffee. I refused. He tried to understand why I was twitching as if suffering from St. Vitus' Dance. I didn't have the energy or desire to explain to him that I had gotten septol (alcohol-based hand sanitizer) in my eye a few minutes ago in the ward, while washing my hands for the thousandth time that morning, as usual.

He got straight to the point and immediately surprised me. Yes, of course, he needed me to teach the course. But that wasn't the main thing. Before his retirement, the sleepy Iraqi realized he hadn't secured a successor for managing the parasitology lab. In fact, he had found a successor, Dr. D., but had a fight with him a few weeks before the end. Now he dropped the bombshell and asked me to take over the lab management. I chuckled, contorted, grimaced, didn't understand. What did that have to do with me, for God's sake?!

I had never considered a career in a lab. After all, I was a clinician burdened with shifts and sleepless nights filled with resuscitations and hallucinations. What did I have to do with this?!

I explained that it wouldn't happen, but gladly (a blatant lie, but I tried to minimize damage and retreat quickly) I would teach the course starting next year. The conversation quickly died down; one could see the light fade from Y.A.'s face and his enthusiasm vanish. We quickly agreed on a course outline, he handed me some files, and we parted ways.

Since then, I have been teaching the parasitology course every year with great enthusiasm, both mine and the students. This book summarizes the course as it is – a rollercoaster ride of dubious science (all my knowledge comes from self-study), eternal stand-up shows (I have a need to make people laugh in lectures, otherwise I get bored), and countless experiences with parasites. I learned to love the profession, the patients, and yes, even the parasites. They are my closest friends. I try to know everything about them, to laugh at them, to understand them, and to successfully kill them. All out of mutual respect for these repulsive creatures.

I'm sure you'll find interest in the crazy journey you're about to embark on. Parasitology is fascinating. The most fascinating of all. Believe me.

And as for Y.A.'s offer to manage the lab? In retrospect, the best offer I ever received. I regret not taking it in real-time.

That is really interesting. For example, I work from home til 10am and then usually go to the office with the motorbike. Everytime I drink coffee, I am kind of scared to take the bike to work and take the car instead. When I had not drank a cup of coffee in the morning I always take the bike to work. In general it feels like after the first cup of coffee I have way higher anxiety levels than without. After longer periods without coffee, the first cup does not raise anxiety at all. But if drank regularly after a couple of days I notice that the levels are culminating and rising. Weird, isn't it?",3,1754634656.0,decaf,2,0.81,False

Warning: Gore, violence, and flashbacks are involved



	“So, Mr. Thompson, when did you say your nightmares began?” 

	Aaron blinked. Just for a second, he was somewhere else—some *when* else, maybe. Not here in Hill Lake Psychiatry, with its perfectly aligned brickwork and those gaudy gold letters that gleamed like teeth in the sunlight. He had walked through those doors 45 minutes ago, desperate for clarity, or at least a name for the thing that had begun to slither its way back into his sleep. The fear in those nightmares eroded his lust for sleep. Nowadays, he was happy to be an insomniac, at least he wouldn’t have to see those eyes anymore, those purple shaded eyes.

	It wasn’t just the dreams, however, it was who was in them. A man—but not really a man—something older, deeper, colder. He wore death like a second skin

	He hadn’t seen them in years. Not since... that summer. The summer that carved a scar so deep across his memory, even time couldn’t stitch it shut. And now here he was, miles away, hiding in the sleepy fog of Hill Lake, Utah, as if geography could outpace guilt.

	“Mr. Thompson?”The doctor’s voice yanked him back like a fishhook through the cheek. Aaron jerked in his seat, blinking the fog away.

	“Sorry, doctor.”

	“No, no. It’s all right, what were you thinking about?”

	“My old friends.”

	“Good memories?”

	“The best.” Of course it was a lie. The truth lived somewhere darker. It gnawed at him from the inside out, a thing with yellow eyes and too many teeth. He couldn’t say it out loud. Didn’t want to. Didn’t want to feed it. Because it was *still* there—*he* was still there—just below the surface of his thoughts. Aaron could remember almost everything. A few details had eroded like chalk in the rain, sure... but the rest? The rest was sharp as broken glass.

	“Mr. Thompson, I would like to try an exercise with you.” The doctor’s voice was calm — too calm, like a radio host introducing a midnight show no one listens to, except the dead. He placed his clipboard down on the marble table between them with an almost reverent care. The clipboard made a dull *thunk*, and Aaron flinched at the sound. Aaron glanced up, brow furrowed. The man’s expression didn’t waver — that professional half-smile, too practiced to be real.

	“An exercise?”, Aaron echoed, voice low, wary.

	“Yes”, the doctor said, steepling his fingers now. “There are places in the subconscious… locked rooms, if you will. Yours are linked to your trauma, and I believe we might be able to access them. I want to try hypnotherapy.”

	Aaron blinked. “Hypno-what now?”

	“Hypnotherapy”, the doctor repeated, with the same soft tone you’d use on a skittish dog.“I’m no magician, Mr. Thompson. No swinging watches or carnival tricks. But I’ve used this method before — with patients who carried their pain like lead inside them. It’s completely safe.” He said it like a promise.

	Aaron sat back. The room suddenly felt colder, like someone had cracked a window he couldn’t see. He could hear the faint ticking of a clock on the wall behind him — slow and steady, a sound that had been swallowed by silence until now. He looked at the doctor — really *looked* — and for a moment there was something in the man’s eyes. Not warmth. Not concern. Hunger, maybe?

	But it passed, like a shadow of a bird flying over the sun. Gone too fast to be sure it had ever been there at all. Aaron hesitated. The silence stretched. Thickened.He raised his eyes slowly, gaze landing on the doctor. Not hope, not quite, more like surrender.

	“Alright, I’ll try it.”

	“Excellent!”, the doctor nearly *chirped*, his voice higher now, too cheerful — like a father playing a game he knew his child would lose. He stood from his oak chair, went around to his desk where his computer resided, opened a drawer, closed the drawer, and came out with a weird looking device. It was six steel balls on a string. The doctor placed it gently on the marble table between them, lifted one ball on one side, and he let it fall. It connecting with the others, causing them to rythmically clash against one another. 

	*Click-clack.*

*Click-clack.*

*Click-clack.*

	“Alright,” the doctor said, his voice softer now, smoothing out like water over stone. “I want you to lie down on the couch. Just... relax.” Aaron did as he was told. He sat on the couch, the leathery cushions making loud noises as Aaron adjusts to be comfortable. When he found a spot he laid there with his eyes on the ceiling. “Good,” the doctor whispered. “Now... concentrate on my voice. That’s all. Let the rest fall away. Just you, and me... and the sound.”

	*Click-clack.*

*Click-clack.*

“Breathe in... slow. Good. Now out. There you go.”

	Aaron let go. His body started to relax a lot, his thoughts became smoke. He floated in that liminal space between waking and sleep — where the monsters in your dreams crawl closest to your ear. 

	Then-a voice. Not the doctors. “*Come baaack to meeeee, Aaronnnn...*” That *voice*. Wet, breathy, rotted at the edges. It oozed into his mind like mold in the walls. “*Commeee baaackkk.*”

	His body jerked violently upright, as if ripped from the inside. A cry caught in his throat, and for a terrifying moment, *nothing* came — no air, no sound, only ice and pressure, like a fist closing around his lungs. He clawed at his chest. He couldn’t breathe. Then — *gasp* — air tore through his throat, and it was freezing, like breathing in a mouthful of snowmelt. The doctor was suddenly there beside him, hands out but not quite touching, like someone unsure whether they should comfort or restrain.

	“A-are you alright?”  the doctor asked, though the words were hollow, distant — like a recording played back through an old tape deck. Aaron stared at him.

	“I-I’m fine”, Aaron tried to say, but the words clung to his throat like cobwebs soaked in glue. He mouthed them more than spoke them—just the shape of syllables on his lips, no sound, no breath. The doctor waited in silence. After a few long seconds, Aaron exhaled, shaky and shallow. The air slithered back into his lungs, warm now, though it burned like it had been dragged through ice. His throat loosened. He could breathe again. Speak again. But he didn’t want to. Not now. No way in hell he was trying *that* again. He stayed on the couch this time, sinking deeper into the stiff leather, as if the cushions might offer some kind of protection. They didn’t.

	The doctor didn’t sit. Instead, he walked slowly across the room, the click of his shoes sounding louder than they should’ve on the tile—like nails on bone. He came to a stop in front of his wall of accolades: diplomas in expensive frames, photos of smiling colleagues, a black-and-white photo of a younger version of himself shaking hands with someone important, both of them frozen in amber smiles.

	The doctor stood there a moment too long. Just staring. Then his voice came, quiet and flat. “Your youth, I’m safe to assume it was troubling?” 

	Aaron blinked at him, his throat still raw. “Yeah, I’d say so. Lots of trouble.”

	The doctor’s head tilted slightly, as if listening for something behind the wall. “Would you like to elaborate?”

	“No, I’m ok. I don’t want to talk about anything from there.” Aaron watched him, something sour twisting in his gut.

	“Not even…the mine?”

	Aaron stood, slowly. His knees stiff, his breath shallow. The air in the room felt... *wrong*. Like a sealed basement just before the mildew hits your nose. Like something was *behind* the walls, listening.

	Aaron’s demeanor changed, he wasn’t relaxed anymore. “How do you know about that?” In all the years Aaron has been coming to this particular doctor he’s never spoke about the mine, not once. Not to any doctor really. The only people who knew that Aaron was there were the others who were there as well. No mention of them on the news, no mention on the radio, nothing.

	“I know.” 

	Aaron tensed up. The only ones who knew were them and that monster. Oh god. The realization hit him like a truck at a million miles per hour. He felt the vomit catching in his throat, or was it fear?

	“I knowwwww, Aaron, I wasss thereee tooo.” The voice was different now, a happy gurgling came from the doctor. He turned around, the first thing Aaron noticed was his eyes, a deep purple shine, his teeth grinning widely. The doctor took a step forward. “I’m going to kill you”, another step, “I’m going to eat you alive”, another, “I’m going to rip you to SHREDSSS!!” This time he lunged at Aaron, luckily he was on the couch and not a chair, he dodged the lunge and sprinted for the door taking one look behind him. The room was empty. Not even taking the chance, Aaron bolted out the door and into his car. He drove, but for some reason he wasn’t driving home, not the home he made in Hill Lake, his home in Wespin. 

	He made it as far as Salt Lake. The fear not once dissipated. His instincts not once let up. Not even when he paid for his ticket, got on the 4 p.m. train, and departed towards Wespin. The low rumbling of the train nearly sent him to sleep, he didn’t want to sleep, not even a wink. Sleeping meant he would relive those moments. Those moments. However, his brain didn’t care for what he wanted. The drive to Salt Lake took a lot out of him and he couldn’t keep his eyes open for long. 

	Then a voice, a soft recognizable voice came from his left. He looked over but only saw sleeping passengers, then it came again to his right, out the window. The voice seemed to carry a sleepy weight. Like with each word, his eyelids got heavier and heavier. Then his mind drifted off, off to those days, then the voice’s words became clearer and clearer. 

	“Aaron”, it said in an urgent tone. “Get up.” By the time Aaron realized who the voice belonged too, he was already fast asleep. The voice, getting more impatient, then-Then…

He jerked upright like a man shot in a dream, the remnants of sleep clinging to his eyes like cobwebs. For a moment, everything was soft and smudged — the edges of the room blurred, light leaking in from the slats in the blinds like fingers creeping across the floor. Then the shape at the foot of his bed came into focus. A figure. A woman. Tapping her foot like a jackhammer on linoleum.

	It was his mother. Of course it was. Natalie Thompson — lean, tired, with her hair tied back in a rubber band she probably found in the junk drawer. Her arms crossed, lips pressed into a flat line.

	“You finally awake?” she asked, the kind of question that wasn’t really a question. Her voice had the usual early-morning rasp, somewhere between anger and coffee-deprived impatience. Aaron leapt out of bed like a startled cat, his heel catching on the blanket. The floor greeted him with a loud *CRACK!* as his bare feet slapped down. He teetered for a second, arms pinwheeling, then caught himself just before eating the floorboards. He turned to look at her — maybe to laugh it off, maybe to apologize — but she was already gone, her silhouette disappearing through the cracked door. Left behind in her wake was the smell of breakfast, thick and warm and comforting, like something out of a memory.

	Bacon. Pancakes. Eggs — a little overdone, probably, but still good. The kind of breakfast that tried to say everything was okay, even if it wasn’t. Aaron dressed in a hurry, yanking on his jeans and grabbing a crumpled shirt from the laundry chair — everyone has a laundry chair — then made a beeline for his desk. He scooped a handful of quarters from a Mason jar labeled *Arcade Money* in crooked Sharpie. He liked the feel of the coins in his hand. It made him feel prepared for the day. Like armor. 

	In the kitchen, his mom was already deep in her routine. Tank top, jogging shorts — standard Natalie. She liked to run after dropping Aaron at school, a ritual she never missed unless it was raining sideways. Then it was yoga in the den, muttering curses at YouTube instructors under her breath. She flipped a pancake with a practiced hand while the radio played on low in the background — 100.3, the Wespin women’s gospel of midday gossip, oldies, and the occasional inspirational quote of the day. She couldn’t remember the last time she’d listened to anything else, and frankly, she didn’t care. Stability was a kind of music, too.

	She slid a plate in front of Aaron without looking — pancakes, eggs, and a slice of ham. She would’ve added grits if they had any, but they were out. Her husband was supposed to grab some two nights ago, but late shifts at the mill meant late dinners and even later trips to the grocery store. Still, she loved him. Tired, forgetful, overworked and underpaid — but she loved him. Life wasn’t perfect. But it was breakfast, and sometimes, that was enough.

	Aaron thanked his mom as he grabbed his Trapper Keeper and made for the front door, Walkman clipped to his jeans and headphones around his neck. “Wait!” she called out. He paused, hand on the doorknob. She was standing there in her robe, one of those pastel terrycloth ones she’d had since the Bicentennial, arm outstretched like a mannequin left mid-pose. A brown paper bag dangled from her fingers, grease starting to spot through at the bottom. “Don’t forget your lunch,” she said, not looking at him. Her eyes were somewhere over his shoulder, somewhere far past the kitchen walls, like she was seeing something only she could see.

	“But mom…”, Aaron tried, shifting his weight. The bag felt like a third-grade science project. She didn’t say anything else. Just stayed there, frozen, arm rigid like she was waiting for a director to yell cut. Aaron sighed and took the lunch bag. The bag crinkled in his grip. Bologna again, he could already tell. He stuffed it in his bookbag on his way out. 

	He stepped out the door. Just as the screen creaked shut behind him, he heard her voice float after him in a low, hollow tone, like it’d been recorded on an old cassette and left out in the sun too long: “I love you.” He didn’t answer. Just pulled his jacket tighter around him and jogged toward the corner, high-tops slapping the pavement.

	The bus was already there, its engine chugging like a chain smoker and that telltale puff of blue exhaust drifting out the back. The doors had started to close, slow as molasses. He jumped the last few steps and made it — just in time for the driver, a gray-haired guy in aviators who smelled like stale coffee and menthols, to grunt and jerk a thumb toward the back. 

	Aaron climbed aboard to a blast of warm air and bad deodorant. Music leaked from a dozen headphones — Madonna, Run-D.M.C., Phil Collins. The floor was sticky from someone's spilled Big Gulp, and there was a faint trace of grape Bubble Yum in the air. He moved down the aisle, scanning for a seat, his backpack bouncing off the vinyl-covered arms of kids he didn’t know. Most faces were turned toward the windows, sun glaring off neon scrunchies and tinted shades.

	There. One open seat, second from the back. He started toward it—

	A hand shot out, gripping his sleeve and pulling him off balance. He staggered a little, nearly dropping his Walkman. The hand was pale, sinewy, and strong. He looked up. A black shirt with a cracked and faded *Ride the Lightning* print, the electric chair right over the chest like a warning sign.

	Benjamin Trowler.

	Aaron’s stomach dropped. Something about the way Benjamin looked at him — not angry, not even mean — just *decided* — said more than words ever could. This wasn’t Aaron’s seat. Not now. Not ever. He didn’t argue. 

	Who was Benjamin Trowler? He was a violent kid. As violent as they come. He’s been to *real* jail before, not just juvie, though he did do a couple stints there. He went to real jail for nearly killing a kid in Nebraska for saying his shirt was for losers. It took five adults to get him off the kid but by that time, the kid was barely alive. Benjamin then spent four years in jail but got out in eight months for good behavior. His parents then moved to Wespin this past summer. He was supposed to start sixth grade all over again but his parents talked to the principal and got him to advance on. 

	Aaron was in fifth grade when Benjamin Trowler came to his school. Rumors about him circled around the whole summer. “A murderer is coming here!” Some would say around town, “Stay away from him!” Others would repeat. It was the same everywhere, even adults would say those things about him. “I heard his mother was a whore! She would sleep around with other men, who knows who his father is.” Aaron never paid *too* much attention to those rumors. 

	Aaron moved along and found an empty seat further along down. He sat next to Rickety Craig. A kid with tourette syndrome who would lick his fingers in a certain order within a certain time frame. Somewhere, a few rows ahead of him, Benjamin laughed once, low and lazy.

	The bus made its slow crawl through town, swallowing corners and coughing up exhaust as it rattled down cracked blacktop and past rows of tired homes with peeling paint and aluminum mailboxes dangling on rusted hinges. Last stop before the school was always Milton Road — a stretch of nothing that meant something, even if nobody said it out loud. Milton Road was famous for exactly one thing: the mine. 

	Abandoned since the ‘40s, long before Aaron was born, but not forgotten. Not by a long shot. The old-timers still talked about it, sometimes after a few beers at Vern’s Tavern.

	A couple streets later, the school came into view — boxy, brick, and grim like all schools built before disco died. The bus screeched to a halt, the brakes giving off that familiar banshee wail, and the kids stood like they always did, single file, sleepy-eyed and already halfway out of their minds with boredom or dread. The driver — Ron, or maybe Ray, Aaron wasn’t sure anymore — sat behind the wheel like a wax figure in a greasy uniform. He grunted vaguely at the stream of “Thanks,” “See ya’s,” and “Later, man”s, never looking up. You could’ve sworn he wasn’t actually *there* sometimes. Like he was just part of the bus. An old fixture. Something left running.

	His last class of the day was English, and yeah, it was his favorite. Not because Aaron had any great love for Shakespeare or dangling participles — hell no. It was the *quiet* he liked. The kind of deep, dead quiet that made you feel like you were underwater. The kind where you could almost hear the fluorescent lights buzzing above your head if you held still enough. That quiet had a name, too: Mrs. Duttle.

	She wasn’t tall, and she wasn’t loud, but Mrs. Duttle didn’t *need* to be either. She had a presence — capital P — like a librarian in a haunted house. Wire-framed glasses that magnified her eyes just enough to make them unnerving, lips always painted a dusty rose, and a spine so straight it looked like it had been reinforced with steel. She ran her class like a submarine — tight ship, zero tolerance. Talking was a mortal sin, whispering a capital offense. And if someone broke the rule? Out. No debate. No second chances.

	Benjamin Trowler, of course, had made a career out of breaking that rule. It was never anything obvious — no shouting, no swearing. That wasn’t Benjamin’s style. He was a *needler*, the kind of kid who took pleasure in death by a thousand cuts. Low giggles from the back row, wet *ptoo!* sounds when a spitball flew like a sniper round toward the back of Brian Nol’s neck. You could practically set your watch to it. Brian would twitch, Benjamin would snicker, and Mrs. Duttle — who somehow *always* knew — would slowly rise from behind her desk, spine clicking like a clock winding up.

	“Out, Mr. Trowler,” she’d say, voice colder than the AC vent. And he’d go. Grinning. Always grinning. Like getting kicked out was the game, and he was winning. Aaron just kept his head down. Eyes on his desk, pencil in hand, ears tuned to the silence. Because in Mrs. Duttle’s room, silence wasn’t just expected — it was sacred. A kind of armor against the rest of the world. Against whatever weird thing was waiting out there past Milton Road. Against whatever followed you in through the school doors on days when the sky looked a little too gray.

	And in that silence, for forty-seven blessed minutes, Aaron could almost pretend everything was normal. Almost.

	Brian Nol sat two seats over from Aaron, and had all year long. The kid was like a shadow — there, but easy to forget unless you were looking right at him. Always quiet. Always still. Like a mannequin someone had dressed up in flannel and jeans and dropped into the room when no one was looking. Aaron had seen him talk to other kids in the halls, maybe even smile once or twice near the vending machines. But in class? Nothing. Not a word. Just silence. The kind of silence that didn’t beg for attention — it just *was*. 

	Aaron didn’t mind. He wasn’t much of a talker himself. Never had been. After class, he didn’t hang around the other kids, didn’t flirt with the girls loitering by their lockers or shoot the breeze by the trophy case. He had places to be — *important* places — like the arcade off Main Street. That place with the flickering “OPEN” sign, sticky floors, and the smell of burnt popcorn always lingering in the air. Where the machines hummed like living things and the glow of the CRT screens was better than sunshine.

	To get there faster, Aaron always cut through the courtyard. It shaved five, maybe ten minutes off the walk if you knew where to jump the fence. But it also meant passing right by the mouth of the abandoned mine. Most kids didn’t go that way. Too many stories.

	So when class let out and Aaron pushed through the double doors into the courtyard, hands stuffed in his jacket pockets and mind already on how many quarters he had left in his wallet, the *last* thing he expected was to hear footsteps behind him — fast, then slowing. He turned, it was Brian. Not smiling. Not saying anything yet. Just… there. Like he’d materialized from the brick walls themselves. His backpack hung from one shoulder, and his face looked pale in the overcast afternoon light. Aaron stopped walking. “Uh… hey?”

	Brian looked at him — not nervous, not excited. Just serious. Like he’d been building up to this moment for longer than Aaron could guess.

	“Hi, I’m Brian, we have the same English class together, you know?” Brian stood there with his lightning backpack over his stomach. It reminded Aaron of something but he couldn’t place it. 

	“Yeah, I remember.” 

	“I was wondering if you’d want to come by the library, you know?” The library? Aaron didn’t even give the thought a chance.

	“Um, no thanks, I’m heading to the arcade instead.” He was curious at the suggestion. “Why the library?” Brian was already turning to head in that direction, he spun his head back to Aaron.

	“I…well…you know…” 

	“You say “You know” a lot don’t you?”

	“Sorry,” Brian said, rubbing the back of his neck like it was a nervous tic baked into his DNA. “It’s something I can’t help doing, you know?” There it was again — *you know.* Like a verbal twitch, something cracked and nervous hiding under all his words. Aaron didn’t answer right away. His fingers dipped into his left pocket, tracing the edges of the quarters he’d stashed there earlier. He felt their cold weight — four of them, maybe five. Enough for a good hour at the arcade. Maybe longer if he stuck to *Galaga* and avoided *Dragon’s Lair*. And yet… he didn’t move. He was actually considering it.

	Not just *going* to the library — which, let’s be honest, was already weird enough for a Thursday afternoon — but *whether it felt right*. Like there was something in the air between them, something humming underneath the skin of the day. That low, invisible pressure you get before a summer storm hits — when the birds go quiet and the sky turns the color of old bruises.

	*Go with this kid*, something in him whispered. *Talk. Try. Be normal for once. Make a friend.*

	It reminded him of something his mom said a few weeks ago. Something offhand, half-said while she was folding towels and smoking one of her menthols by the sink. “Honey, you gotta make friends or else you’ll die lonely.”

	Aaron blinked. Wait… was that right? Would she even *say* something like that?

	It didn’t sound like her — at least not the *her* he wanted to remember. But the line was lodged in his brain like a splinter, specific and sharp, and no matter how many times he tried to rephrase it, it came out the same way. Deadpan. Almost cruel. Like something whispered just before you wake up from a bad dream. Before he could dig into it any deeper, Brian broke the silence. 

	“It’s okay,” he said. “You can come another time.” Then he turned and walked off — that same loping, unsure stride, backpack bouncing against his spine like a metronome. Aaron didn’t follow.

	He could’ve.

	Should’ve. But he didn’t.

	And years later, when the town had changed, when kids whispered about things that crawled out of dark places and memories they didn’t trust, Aaron would think back to that day — to the soft *clink* of quarters in his pocket, the smell of distant rain on concrete, and Brian’s voice fading into the air like a signal from a station just out of reach. He wished he had gone, God he wished he had gone.

	Winter break was just three days away, and Aaron was counting down like it was the end of a prison sentence. He’d already made his plans — or *plan*, singular — which was to spend as much time as humanly possible in the arcade down on Main, the one with the flickering sign and the duct tape holding the change machine together. It wasn’t much, but it was his.

	Christmas was his favorite holiday, no question about it. The lights, the music, the way the whole world felt like it was wrapped in some kind of glittery magic. He loved the gifts, sure — what kid didn’t? — but he hated the snow. Hated how it crept in overnight like a quiet enemy and ruined everything. Whenever it snowed too heavy, the arcade would close up, its metal gate rolled down like a tongue sticking out of a dead mouth. No blinking lights, no beeps or bloops, no escape.

	And on those days, Aaron had nothing. No friends to pelt with snowballs. No one to trade gifts with or laugh about dumb TV specials. Just him. Alone with himself and the silence. But today? Today the sky held. Gray, yeah, but dry. And that meant the arcade would be open, warm and humming and waiting for him like a neon temple.

	After Brian walked off — disappearing into the distance like a ghost nobody asked for — Aaron turned toward his destination. The shortcut. Through the courtyard, over the fence, past the edge of that no-man’s-land where the mine entrance sat buried under weeds and legend.

	He could hear the change rattling in his pocket, jingling with every step. *Spend me!* they seemed to say. *Use me! Win the tickets! Grab the grand prize!* 

	“I sure will!” Aaron said aloud, more to the coins than to himself, his voice bright and cartoonish for just a second. Like he was trying to sell himself the dream. He'd never gotten the grand prize. Not once.

	Oh, he’d tried. Piled up tickets like a squirrel storing acorns. Spent hours at *Whack-A-Mole*, *Skee-Ball*, and that broken-down claw machine that hadn’t actually picked up anything heavier than a gum wrapper since '83. He wasn’t *bad* at arcade games — just never good enough. Never lucky enough. Always a little too slow, or a hair too early. The jackpot was always just out of reach, blinking at him like it knew.

	Still, he kept coming back. Because somewhere in all those lights and sounds, in that room full of bad carpet and better memories, there was *something*. Not a grand prize, maybe. But something else. And maybe today would be the day he found it.

	Aaron was so caught up in the jingling chorus of his pocket — the coins singing out their little arcade dreams — that he didn’t realize where he was heading. He was grinning, talking to himself like a loon, imagining tickets flying and sirens going off and some blinking jackpot light finally, *finally* shining for him. Then his toe slammed into a rock. Reality crashing down like a plane with one wing off. He yelped, grabbing at his foot like it had betrayed him, and stumbled back—then froze.

	His breath caught. Not like a gasp — more like someone had reached into his lungs and just… turned them off. Because he was there. *There*. 

	The mine entrance. The one place everyone knew but nobody talked about. The one with the sagging fence and the collapsed “KEEP OUT” sign hanging by a single nail. The path he only ever skirted, never *approached*. And now he stood less than ten feet from it, with the opening yawning like the mouth of a dead god.

	His feet wouldn’t move. Concrete. No — *ice*. They were blocks of *ice*. He couldn’t have lifted them if someone screamed in his ear. 

	“*Hellooooo.”* It was a whisper. A whisper from somewhere he wished it didn’t come from. The whispering came from inside. “*Do you wissshhhhh tooooo playyyy?”* Then another horrifying realization dawned on him, the voice was coming closer. The first whisper sounded impossibly miles away, now it was only feet away. “*I wannnttt tooo playyyy.”* Now it sounded so close he could feel the breath wafting from the darkness-sour and wet and awful, like the inside of an old refrigerator filled with meat gone bad. And then… “*Let’ssss playyyyy.”* In an instant Aaron recognized who the voice was coming from, or rather what.

	The flesh on the face was rotten so bad you could see its teeth poking out on each side. Two rows of razor sharp teeth filled its jaws. The clothes looked watery and rotten. Its eyes, a bright purple haze, filled with hunger. It bolted towards Aaron, him grabbing the change he had in his hand and throwing them at the monster, at the-at the-ZOMBIE!! Yes, of course, it looked straight out of a zombie film, but it talked, how could it have talked?

	Aaron screamed. Not loud, not heroic. A cracked, panicked sound that barely made it past his lips. He didn’t think — just grabbed the coins in his fist and hurled them at the thing’s face.

Clink. Clink. Clink.

	One struck the creature right above the eye. It hissed — or laughed — he couldn’t tell which. He didn’t wait to find out.

 	He ran, oh he ran and ran until he made it to Withchell street, three blocks away from the entrance. From that *Thing*. Once he caught his breath he didn’t stop until he got home. He bolted to his room and shut his door. His breathing started to calm a bit. That’s when he saw it. His breathing got faster now. On his nightstand next to his bed was some change. The same change he threw. A whistling filled his ears, he wanted to scream, to…to…

# [1.1 A preface to the preface]()

Life looked a bit different in 2009. As a young pediatrician, I felt like the king of the world. I was about to start my second residency in infectious diseases and thought I was invincible.

Then came that phone call. It wasn't even meant for me.

The call was between Prof. P.Y. and Prof. D.G. At its core was P.Y.'s need to find a replacement lecturer for the parasitology course for second-year medical students, due to Prof. Y.A.'s imminent retirement. P.Y., who was then the head of the medical school, saw he was in trouble and immediately called the least suitable person for the task. He knew very well that D.G. was lazy and knew nothing about parasites, but he also knew very well that he could impose anything he wanted on D.G., and D.G. had no means of resistance.

I was casually passing through the corridor next to D.G.'s room, where I constantly hung out. A silly smile on my lips and a deep need to read another 500 unnecessary pages in Feigin or Mandell (the textbooks for infectious diseases in children and adults, respectively). I had no idea how my life was about to change completely.

I could hear snippets of the conversation. It was clear D.G. was in distress, and the hundred-kilo hammer on his head was causing him slight discomfort. Then the unbelievable happened. Deus ex machina. D.G. spotted my clumsy figure dancing in the hallway and immediately jumped up – ""Shalom, you have a phone call."" The idiot that is me immediately replied, ""No problem,"" took the receiver, and brought it to my ear. ""Yes, P.Y., what's up?"" The end.

I won't bore you with the details. P.Y. commanded me, in the most polite and friendly tone he could muster, to attend a meeting with Y.A. in the parasitology lab to replace him in delivering the course in question.

A week later, I was walking happily and light-heartedly, with septol in my eye (don't ask) that made me grimace and look like a pervert, on my way to the pathology building. On the second floor, in the parasitology lab, Prof. Y.A. was waiting for me.

It's worth understanding a few basic things about the situation at that time:

* I have just finished my pediatrics residency. My knowledge of parasitology was close to zero and included memories of missing a class or two due to military reserve duty and my father's memorial service. That's it.
* Parasites sounded to me like something related to bizarre jungle diseases. Something with swollen testicles and terrifying pictures of worms peeking out of all sorts of holes and orifices in the body. (Yes, I know I was stupid, and I hope it's mostly passed).
* Prof. Y.A. didn't know me at all, certainly didn't remember me from my student days (a grade of 85 in the course, thanks for asking).
* My professional aspirations were limited to completing my infectious diseases residency; I was happy to be the youngest and most enthusiastic in the group.
* I had no teaching experience at all and only a vague idea in my head of what I wanted to say in the conversation.

I entered the room. Y.A. offered me coffee. I refused. He tried to understand why I was twitching as if suffering from St. Vitus' Dance. I didn't have the energy or desire to explain to him that I had gotten septol (alcohol-based hand sanitizer) in my eye a few minutes ago in the ward, while washing my hands for the thousandth time that morning, as usual.

He got straight to the point and immediately surprised me. Yes, of course, he needed me to teach the course. But that wasn't the main thing. Before his retirement, the sleepy Iraqi realized he hadn't secured a successor for managing the parasitology lab. In fact, he had found a successor, Dr. D., but had a fight with him a few weeks before the end. Now he dropped the bombshell and asked me to take over the lab management. I chuckled, contorted, grimaced, didn't understand. What did that have to do with me, for God's sake?!

I had never considered a career in a lab. After all, I was a clinician burdened with shifts and sleepless nights filled with resuscitations and hallucinations. What did I have to do with this?!

I explained that it wouldn't happen, but gladly (a blatant lie, but I tried to minimize damage and retreat quickly) I would teach the course starting next year. The conversation quickly died down; one could see the light fade from Y.A.'s face and his enthusiasm vanish. We quickly agreed on a course outline, he handed me some files, and we parted ways.

Since then, I have been teaching the parasitology course every year with great enthusiasm, both mine and the students. This book summarizes the course as it is – a rollercoaster ride of dubious science (all my knowledge comes from self-study), eternal stand-up shows (I have a need to make people laugh in lectures, otherwise I get bored), and countless experiences with parasites. I learned to love the profession, the patients, and yes, even the parasites. They are my closest friends. I try to know everything about them, to laugh at them, to understand them, and to successfully kill them. All out of mutual respect for these repulsive creatures.

I'm sure you'll find interest in the crazy journey you're about to embark on. Parasitology is fascinating. The most fascinating of all. Believe me.

And as for Y.A.'s offer to manage the lab? In retrospect, the best offer I ever received. I regret not taking it in real-time.

Life looked a bit different in 2009. As a young pediatrician, I felt like the king of the world. I was about to start my second residency in infectious diseases and thought I was invincible.

Then came that phone call. It wasn't even meant for me.

The call was between Prof. P.Y. and Prof. D.G. At its core was P.Y.'s need to find a replacement lecturer for the parasitology course for second-year medical students, due to Prof. Y.A.'s imminent retirement. P.Y., who was then the head of the medical school, saw he was in trouble and immediately called the least suitable person for the task. He knew very well that D.G. was lazy and knew nothing about parasites, but he also knew very well that he could impose anything he wanted on D.G., and D.G. had no means of resistance.

I was casually passing through the corridor next to D.G.'s room, where I constantly hung out. A silly smile on my lips and a deep need to read another 500 unnecessary pages in Feigin or Mandell (the textbooks for infectious diseases in children and adults, respectively). I had no idea how my life was about to change completely.

I could hear snippets of the conversation. It was clear D.G. was in distress, and the hundred-kilo hammer on his head was causing him slight discomfort. Then the unbelievable happened. Deus ex machina. D.G. spotted my clumsy figure dancing in the hallway and immediately jumped up – ""Shalom, you have a phone call."" The idiot that is me immediately replied, ""No problem,"" took the receiver, and brought it to my ear. ""Yes, P.Y., what's up?"" The end.

I won't bore you with the details. P.Y. commanded me, in the most polite and friendly tone he could muster, to attend a meeting with Y.A. in the parasitology lab to replace him in delivering the course in question.

A week later, I was walking happily and light-heartedly, with septol in my eye (don't ask) that made me grimace and look like a pervert, on my way to the pathology building. On the second floor, in the parasitology lab, Prof. Y.A. was waiting for me.

It's worth understanding a few basic things about the situation at that time:

* I have just finished my pediatrics residency. My knowledge of parasitology was close to zero and included memories of missing a class or two due to military reserve duty and my father's memorial service. That's it.
* Parasites sounded to me like something related to bizarre jungle diseases. Something with swollen testicles and terrifying pictures of worms peeking out of all sorts of holes and orifices in the body. (Yes, I know I was stupid, and I hope it's mostly passed).
* Prof. Y.A. didn't know me at all, certainly didn't remember me from my student days (a grade of 85 in the course, thanks for asking).
* My professional aspirations were limited to completing my infectious diseases residency; I was happy to be the youngest and most enthusiastic in the group.
* I had no teaching experience at all and only a vague idea in my head of what I wanted to say in the conversation.

I entered the room. Y.A. offered me coffee. I refused. He tried to understand why I was twitching as if suffering from St. Vitus' Dance. I didn't have the energy or desire to explain to him that I had gotten septol (alcohol-based hand sanitizer) in my eye a few minutes ago in the ward, while washing my hands for the thousandth time that morning, as usual.

He got straight to the point and immediately surprised me. Yes, of course, he needed me to teach the course. But that wasn't the main thing. Before his retirement, the sleepy Iraqi realized he hadn't secured a successor for managing the parasitology lab. In fact, he had found a successor, Dr. D., but had a fight with him a few weeks before the end. Now he dropped the bombshell and asked me to take over the lab management. I chuckled, contorted, grimaced, didn't understand. What did that have to do with me, for God's sake?!

I had never considered a career in a lab. After all, I was a clinician burdened with shifts and sleepless nights filled with resuscitations and hallucinations. What did I have to do with this?!

I explained that it wouldn't happen, but gladly (a blatant lie, but I tried to minimize damage and retreat quickly) I would teach the course starting next year. The conversation quickly died down; one could see the light fade from Y.A.'s face and his enthusiasm vanish. We quickly agreed on a course outline, he handed me some files, and we parted ways.

Since then, I have been teaching the parasitology course every year with great enthusiasm, both mine and the students. This book summarizes the course as it is – a rollercoaster ride of dubious science (all my knowledge comes from self-study), eternal stand-up shows (I have a need to make people laugh in lectures, otherwise I get bored), and countless experiences with parasites. I learned to love the profession, the patients, and yes, even the parasites. They are my closest friends. I try to know everything about them, to laugh at them, to understand them, and to successfully kill them. All out of mutual respect for these repulsive creatures.

I'm sure you'll find interest in the crazy journey you're about to embark on. Parasitology is fascinating. The most fascinating of all. Believe me.

And as for Y.A.'s offer to manage the lab? In retrospect, the best offer I ever received. I regret not taking it in real-time.

1mknr0u,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1mknr0u/fn_three_wishes/,[FN] Three wishes.,"**People expect wishes to be loud.**  
They expect them to come from people clutching at hope with shaking hands, ready to demand something for themselves.

**Hiraya was not like that.**





She was fifteen when she found my lamp, buried in a thrift store bin.

When I appeared, she didn’t flinch — she just tilted her head slightly, as though she’d been expecting me.

“Three wishes, right?” she asked.

“Yes,” I told her. “Anything you want.”

But Hiraya didn’t answer right away.

That afternoon, she wandered the quiet streets of her town.

The air was crisp, heavy with the scent of damp earth and wood smoke from nearby chimneys.

She watched an old woman struggle with heavy groceries, her hands trembling just enough to betray the effort.

She saw children laughing by the fountain, their breath misting in the cool air, but one boy stood apart, his gaze lost in the fading amber light.

She listened — to the distant hum of voices, the soft shuffle of feet on worn pavement, the weight of things left unspoken.

After a long pause, she spoke.

“For my first wish… I want a bell.”

“But not just any bell.”

“I want it to ring only when someone needs help — and only the people strong enough to give the right help will hear it. Not just anyone. And not just for me… for everyone here.”

The next morning, she stood in the center of town with the silver bell I had given her,  
the kind of bell whose chime could melt the edge off winter air.

She tied it to the old wooden post, her fingers steady despite the bite of the cold.

A thin layer of frost glazed the post, glittering in the early sunlight.

It rang that night.

A boy heard it from his bedroom, the soft chime weaving through the quiet like a gentle call, and crossed the street to sit with his grieving neighbor.

The next week, it rang again, and a woman brought soup to a friend she hadn’t spoken to in months.

When Hiraya passed through the square the next day,  
she saw them smiling, standing close together, breath visible in the chilly morning air.

She smiled too.

Most days, someone heard the bell.

Some days, it rang for no one.





Weeks later, Hiraya sat by her window as the afternoon sun dipped low, spilling golden light across the wooden floor.

She watched neighbors pass without a word, their footsteps muffled on the cracked pavement, their eyes cast down, their silence heavy with things left unsaid.

The space between them felt thick — crowded with regret, fear, and the weight of truth they could not bear to voice.

She called me to her room.

Her desk lamp was the only light, flickering softly and casting long shadows under her tired eyes.

“For my second wish,” she said,

“I want a way for people to say what they truly feel, even when they can’t say it out loud.

If it’s honest and from the heart, it should find its way —  
a text from an unknown number, a note on a foggy window, an email from nowhere.

I want it to reach who it’s meant for, even if the sender is too afraid or too tired.”

“Again… for everyone?” I asked.

She nodded.

“For everyone.”

Two days later, the café buzzed with soft laughter and relief.

An old man clutched his phone, his knuckles white as he read a message from the daughter he thought had forgotten him.

Two women hugged by the window, the warm scent of coffee and cinnamon swirling around them, their argument dissolved by a note neither had the courage to write.

Hiraya sat in the corner with a cooling cup of tea, steam curling faintly above it, watching, and her lips curved in the faintest smile.

Her second wish stitched invisible threads between people who thought they’d been left behind.





When winter came, Hiraya stood beneath a cold, frozen sky late one night.

The stars above were pale and distant, the world hard and unforgiving.

She wrapped her arms around herself, the rough fabric of her sweater scratching against her skin, and thought about the cruelty people carried inside,  
the way hardship hardened hearts and numbed kindness.

She summoned me.

Frost patterned her window like delicate lace; the only sound in the room was the whisper of her blanket shifting as she sat on the edge of the bed.

“I want a space in everyone’s hearts that stays pure,” she said.

“Even if the world is cruel to them.  
A place where kindness and love can live, untouched.

I want it to be a safe place for their feelings, so the world can’t make them numb.”

I hesitated.

“That’s… a big gift. Why do you want that?”

She looked at me for a long moment, then back at the frost.

“Because people lose too much of themselves when it gets hard.

I don’t want them to lose this too.”

And that was all she said.

I granted it.





She sat in silence for a while, watching the frost crawl along the windowpane.

Then, without looking at me, she said softly,

“I’m sorry.”

“For what?” I asked.

“For being selfish,” she said.

“I could’ve used a wish to free you. But I didn’t.

I know that’s… not what a truly selfless person would’ve done.

I hope someday, someone better than me will do it.

Someone who deserves to meet you more than I did.”

She finally turned to me, and there was the smallest, tired smile.

“Thank you. For not twisting my wishes, and for granting them.”

She waved goodbye, a quiet smile on her face, and went on her way.





The bell still hangs in the town square, swaying gently when no wind blows.

It moves softly in the empty air—

It rings only for those who can help, and sometimes they come.

The unspoken words still find their way into trembling hands.

The quiet spaces in people’s hearts still glow, untouched by bitterness.

But none of it was ever for her.

No one heard the bell for her.

No letter found its way to her hands.

Whatever safe place she had in her own heart… wasn’t enough to keep her here.





Maybe she had already given up before she even met me.

Maybe she knew no one was strong enough to help her.

Maybe that’s why she never asked for herself.





I remember that night.

The bell swung gently in the cold night air.

It should have rung—for me, for her—

but it was silent.

No sound.

No help.

Her need hung in that silence, desperate and unseen.

And I, who grant wishes,

could do nothing.

That empty, unheard bell haunts me still.",2,1754634213.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
1mknqat,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1mknqat/racking_up_massive_amounts_of_debt_and_not_paying/,Racking up massive amounts of debt and not paying it is smart.,"Money is just imaginary magic paper. It's a number on a computer. Numbers are symbols to represent how much goods are worth. It's just an amount some dude decided. A $3 cup of coffee is $3 because a guy said he wants $3 for it. There's no scientific reasoning behind the value of it. 

If this wasn't true then why would debt collectors constantly be settling balances of account holder's delinquent debt by half- millions of times a day? I had a light bill for $3000 once that I never paid over the course of 2 years. The electric company sent it to a collector and I settled it for $1500. When a bill goes to collections you win. You just got a 50% discount on an essential good you need to live. 

I'm not going to defend people who rack up credit card debt on stupid things like dining and entertainment, but if you're hungry- stacking up credit card debt on grocery store food for 10 years because you're hungry and then settling it later is absolutely a genius survival tactic as a human in modern civilization. 

I'm thirsty! How much is this water? $4? Ok here's my piece of plastic. You take this? Thanks. 

And the worst that can happen? You'll go bankrupt and have bad credit. Ok. Credit is an imaginary thing also. Does having bad credit/going bankrupt prevent you from working? No! Does it prevent you from saving cash? No! All it does is prevent you from continuing to borrow money. 

Just imagine you're an alien from outer space. 

👽: So you can buy anything you want with this little plastic card? And what happens when you don't pay them back? 

🧔‍♂️: They charge interest. 

👽: What if you don't pay the interest? 

🧔‍♂️: You have to go to court and they wipe all your debt clean! But it's bad! 

👽: Why is it bad? Do they send you to jail or something? 

🧔‍♂️: NO! They don't let you borrow anymore money!

1mknqak,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sims4/comments/1mknqak/how_to_avoid_cooking_skill_my_tutorial/,How to avoid Cooking Skill - my Tutorial,"We all know how mother clucking annoying it is that Sims build their skills waaaaay too easily. My special gripe are Cooking, and Fitness. So here are my (tedious to funny) Tipps how to avoid the Skill like the plague!

1. Apartments without a functional kitchen! You can place the Restauration Hardware Kit items for some nice rating, and then never repair it. If you do, add some vending machines in the hallways, it really makes getting food easy. Always have more than one in case stuff gets stuck and you don't want to test your luck.

2. ""Door Dash"" food to your Sims regularly. The waiting time is acceptable, and you can even order more than one meal, and just put them into the fridge. If you have one, haha.

3. It's giving you a reason to visit festivals for the food!

4. And honestly, also restaurants. I only place the ones EA build, but some gallery builds are functional and amazing. If not, I add a vending machine somewhere. But it's also great for dates. Yes, it takes a whole Sim Day. It's a dining experience and all.

5. A lot of worlds have food stalls. If my Sim is living in a neighborhood with one, I skip the kitchen in my build entirely. Mt. Komorebi, San Myshuno and Selvadorada are great for that.

6. Finally a reason to visit lounges when a Sim calls you for ghost-celebrity-alien-night on the town or whatever reason they find.

7. University Study Spots have the cafeteria item where you can eat for a small budget. If your Sim is in the Teaching Career it absolutely makes sense.

8. Active careers provide a way to make food, just pick cereal or something that doesn't raise the  Skill. Acting even has catering! I always bag some food for later, because I'm tacky af.

9. Rabbit Hole Careers/Schools will feed the hunger need when you're low.

10. Items like the cooler boxes, the cookie jar, lunch boxes, or cereal boxes all allow to eat food that doesn't require cooking.

11. Townies love to use the BBQ in public spaces. Keep your eyes peeled for them and you can grab plates of food for your inventory, then drag and drop into the fridge to have leftovers.

12. Foraging and Harvestables, as well as Fishing, but sadly those are all connected to other skills.

13. Dumpster Dive for food, especially viable in Evergreen Harbour. Although icky, sometimes it just fits the Sim's character, you filthy disgusting simulated person!

14. Have a Butler. They'll cook when you ask them to.

15. Not tested yet, but I highly suspect you can abuse roommate's tendency for white cake, roasted chickens, and whatever new bug they'll introduce with the Foodies United NAP, but you need to stay vigilant about cancelling any autonomous cooking attempts, which makes it not worth it for me personally.

16. Have another Sim cook in general, for example when you have a Grandmother Sim in your family, they exclusively cook for the family, and everyone else is just never raising the skill.

17. Get the Small Business Coffee or use the Thrift Tea Counter, and then use one Sim to tend it, while another orders stuff. Tending the counters doesn't raise cooking.

18. Have a stocked small business vending food shop with another household, then switch Families and buy the whole stock. Immediately go home, and refridgerate.

19. Not Tested Yet: Join/Make a foodie club, invite them over to cook for you, then end the club meeting.

20. Do a potluck event, and let your guests bring the food over. Refridgerate throughout. You may not get a high rating, but you'll get stuff for free.

21. Not Tested Yet: have buffet tables in your house, stock them, then put the items in the fridge. Rinse and repeat as needed.

Do you have any additional Tipps?

Please share if you tested some if my ideas.

I might do one to avoid Fitness. There are some ways without cheats.

Edit:

22. Mood potions to set your needs to max. Also works with the Apothecary Table Potion, and all buffs that refill needs like from the wishing well.

23. Get a crypt for your lot. I don't know why, but my Sims get all their needs to max when I discover it. Just jump out (cancel the action) once it's filled up.

24. If you have too much spare money, build a food stall on your lot, and hire a vendor (100 Simoleons), then order whatever you want once they're there.

25. Tomarang and The Coast of Adhmore have food shops/groceries. Also works with the food shop in Henford-on-Bagley Town. You can buy Fish in the Fish shops, or food on the night market, or visit the supermarket near the gnome stall. In Henford you'll get cheese, milk, and bread relatively regularly.

26. Fairy Sims can exclusively eat other Sim's emotions - or just use the Fairy House. No need to cook ever. Vampires can feed on other people or snack on Plasma Fruits, make themselves Plasma Drinks, Convert Frogs into Plasma Packs, or use the vet machine on packs to get Plasma Packs. Just saying.

From the comments (please like their comment!):

27. Spellcasters can learn the Delicioso/Grand Delicioso Spells in the Practical Magic category to conjure food. You may have to stall with other methods until your Spellcaster learns the spell.

28. Werewolves can hunt for food, and bring back raw meat to eat. You may have to keep their hunger need satiated with other methods until you unlocked the ability.

29. Plant Sims don't have a hunger need. You can easily get a plant by asking an existing Plant Sim for a seed, then plant it and harvest the fruits (may have to do other things while you wait for it to bear fruits), or you visit the portal tree in Willow Creek. You can sometimes get the seeds by fishing in the Forgotten Grotto, too.

30. High Debate Skill can use convince others to cook for you, and the skill is overall less often used than cooking, and if you go to university you'll raise it anyways. Quite neat idea honestly.",1,1754634137.0,Sims4,8,0.6,False

This second time I tried a new shop and within 45 minutes of drinking it I got super super nauseous,  and my heart started racing and I had awful tremors. I felt awful. I freaked out and went to the ER because it wouldn't go away and they ran several labs, did a few ekgs. I felt better after a few hours. The doctor later told me he didn't see anything dangerous.
