She discarded me after a small argument end of March. She ghosted me. Wouldn't reply to anything I sent even when I begged for a single response. 

After a month in April, I tried calling her. All my calls got forwarded, and her fucking brother and mother intervened for no reason, calling me back every time I attempted to call. Berating me. Telling me to stop contacting her like I'm a nosy toddler that ""doesn't get the hint"". All I wanted was a single conversation. Escalating it like hell.

After being holed up in my room for a month, I got out the start of May, to reminisce around a bridge she showed me near her area. I encountered her at a nearby bus stop and waved hi from a distance. 

She sprinted away from me. 

Then her brother and mother had the audacity to drive to my family's porch and threaten my mom that they would involve police if I kept contacting her. Her brother yelled at her. 

I still am not over how absolutely lunatic it is that they threatened to call the police because I waved hi at her AT A PUBLIC SPACE. I encountered her by chance, and now I am traumatised from going to even a fucking coffee shop in-case, god forbid, I come across her. 

You'd think from how I've been treated I was an abuser or worse. I just wanted to talk, I never did anything to hurt her throughout our time together. I was a sobbing mess the whole time and I didn't get an inkling of compassion. 

Her silence was so dehumanising. I've been in no contact since then. She eventually cut me off from everything.

I hate this. So why do I miss her? What do I miss?!",1,1748924271.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

9 AM, coffee’s brewed, the world’s quiet — just missing one good conversation.

I figured instead of scrolling endlessly, I’d shoot my shot here. Maybe you’re also sipping coffee or just starting your day, wondering who else out there is in the mood for a little connection — not the rushed, awkward kind, but something honest, maybe even a little flirty if we click.

Cool with random check-ins or sharing songs throughout the day

1l22e6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cruise/comments/1l22e6o/guide_travel_router_with_private_vpn/,Guide: Travel router with private VPN,"I keep seeing posts about how all VPN and travel routers are ""blocked"" on cruises. That has not been my experience. Often they are just badly configured or have provider specific VPN blocks on ""spammy"" companies. 

So here is my guide to configure a travel router with personal VPN server that should work on most poorly configured public wifi networks. 

# Disclaimer 

Some cruise lines may outright ban travel routers and/or VPN protocols. Be sure to check the rules for your specific line before bringing your travel router or connecting to your VPN server.

# What

Use any GL.iNet travel router to tunnel your internet connection through home network while traveling. I've perfected this configuration through years of traveling while working remote and it works seamlessly everywhere I've tried it. From coffee shops to planes to ships.

# Why not just use my phone hotspot? 
Well, as you've probably noticed, it sometimes just doesn't work. Often because:
* TTL issues(breaks MTU path discovery)
* VPN can't be shared in hotspot mode
* Captive portal won't load when hotspot is active
* Hotspot only works with 4G, not wifi
* Hotspot only routes TCP traffic
* Hotspot poorly implements NAT
* DNS is all F'ed up from bad captive portal implementations
* Etc etc

# Why go through this hassle?
* No VPN bill
* Not blocked by some websites like VPN providers are (spammers use them)
* Can access IoT devices on home LAN like thermostats and cameras
* Traffic appears to originate from your home connection. Useful if you don't like megacorporations like Meta, Netflix, and Google tracking your location as you travel around the world. 

# Home network config

## Dynamic DNS
You need dynamic DNS configurated  to reach your home network reliably because it usually doesn't have a fixed IP address. 

* Set up Dynamic DNS so you can reach your home network from anywhere. Lots of options here, Google it.

* I like https://www.noip.com/ right now because it's easy. You will need to run a DDNS client on a desktop PC that's always on or your router.

You can test out your Dynamic DNS using NSLookup. https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/dynamic-dns-ddns-troubleshooting-guide

Your public IP shown on https://www.whatismyip.com/ should match the address below your DDNS domain when you run nslookup. 

## Home VPN server
Yes. You can run a VPN host at home and avoid expensive and wonky public VPN servers. 

* Set up a WireGuard server at home on your router or a desktop PC you leave on. Many tutorials online for this too. Just run it on same machine as DDNS client. 
* The easiest option for WireGuard server is probably this. https://github.com/micahmo/WgServerforWindows
* Configure WireGuard server to use port 443. It's the HTTPS port, which is sometimes the only thing routed correctly on Chinesium network ""appliances"" running 15 year old Linux. 
* Set up port forwarding if needed so your WireGuard server is publicly accessible on port 443.
* Port forwarding is Internet provider specific and usually involves logging into your gateway. You can Google ""gateway port forwarding with X ISP"" to figure it out.
* Assign port forward to MAC address of WG server machine if possible so you don't need to mess with static LAN IP addresses.

**NOTE:** If given option to forward TCP/UDP on port 443, choose UDP or both. 

## Simple VPN check

At this point, you should be able to use a port scanner to test if your VPN server is up and publicly accessible (and port forwarding is working). 

Go here and run a port probe for 443. It should be OPEN.
https://www.whatismyip.com/port-scanner/

## Validating VPN configuration. 

At this point, you should test out your new private VPN server. 

* Grab with wireguard client config file that got generated by server app and modify the server address to match your dynamic DNS name. 
* Make sure that VPN port in config is 443
* Download updated VPN config to your phone.
* Install official wireguard app to phone. 

***NOTE:*** Do not share this VPN config file with anyone. It contains encryption keys that allow private access to your LAN from the Internet. 

Now, turn off your phone wifi so connection switches to 4G. Then turn on the VPN connection in Wireguard app. Your phone Internet should work, with traffic routed through VPN to your home network. 

You can use a speed test phone app to check ISP, it should match your home internet provider if VPN is working. Not your cell provider (will happen if VPN config is broken). 

***After testing, be sure to disable VPN connection on your phone***

# Travel Router
Now switch focus to configuring GL.iNet router.

* Follow their instructions for initial setup. 
* It usually involves connecting to router and going to 192.168.8.1 in browser.
* Follow their instructions for WireGuard **client** setup. https://docs.gl-inet.com/router/jp/3/tutorials/wireguard_client/ You will need to copy updated Wire guard client config again to the device you're using to configure travel router. 
* Upload or copy paste your WireGuard client config you tested earlier with your phone into travel router web UI
* Save your new WireGuard VPN client configuration. 


## Test VPN on travel router

### Using phone to emulate public wifi network
* Turn on hotspot on your phone
* Disable wifi on your phone. It should switch to 4G.
* Connect to travel router's wifi with another device (not your phone hosting 4G hotspot!)
* Follow GL.iNet docs to connect to your phone hotspot in repeater mode https://docs.gl-inet.com/router/en/4/interface_guide/internet_repeater/

You should now have your travel router connected to your phone which is sharing its 4G connection.

We are going to pretend that your phone's 4G hotspot is a public wifi network for testing purposes.

### Testing VPN on travel router
* On same device you used to connect your travel router to phone's hotspot in repeater mode, navigate further in router UI to Turn on WireGuard VPN client
*  Switch on ""block non vpn traffic"" and ""allow access to WAN"" https://docs.gl-inet.com/router/en/4/faq/block_non_vpn_traffic/

Test out the travel router connection. At this point, traffic should be flowing from your device connected to travel router's wifi, over phone's 4G hotspot, then VPN tunneled from your 4G to home connection. 


# On the ship
* Connect a device that you will only use via travel router to ship's wifi and authorize it. I usually use a laptop. Ensure internet works. 
* Disconnect it from ship wifi and forget the network
* Now connect that same device to your travel router's wifi
* Go to travel router config page (usually 192.168.8.1)
* Go to VPN config page. Ensure that your VPN client is enabled, ""block non VPN traffic"" is still enabled, and ""allow access to WAN"" is still enabled. 
* Go to connect in repeater mode page again. Don't actually connect yet though. See https://docs.gl-inet.com/router/en/4/interface_guide/internet_repeater/
* On the ""join network"" pop-up that comes up after selecting ship's wifi in travel router UI: Set MAC mode to ""clone"". Then scroll down to TTL and enter 64. You may have to check ""advanced settings"" to set TTL.  
* Now hit ""Apply""

Congrats! If you did all bazillion steps properly you should have Internet working on any devices connected to travel router. Automatically tunneled through your VPN to home network. This connection should behave just like your home internet (but slower of course).

It's good to test your setup by doing the final ""on the ship"" part on some random public wifi before going on a trip. Run a speed test and verify that location shows your home network.

I use this setup whenever I'm traveling because public wifi is usually fucked up one way or another. Either mangled DNS, only HTTP ports forwarded correctly, TTL ICMP and MTU issues, etc. By VPN tunneling through my home network I get a stable connection where all the sites and apps work normally.

1l22dw5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l22dw5,Lid not closing tight enough,"Hey everyone,

Vertuo Next - purchased in March as replacement for leaking original bought back in December last year that was leaking the usual dark, coffee brew from underneath.

Last couple of weeks I noticed more liquid than usual, and what feels acceptable, in the drip tray and the similar brew water underneath. 

Fully cleaned, descaled etc and went over it again. Nothing clogged in the usual places, paper clip trick and toothbrush etc on the main feeds of water and brew out to cup.

After a few tests it seems the rubber gasket thing (pic 1) isn’t sealing right and tight into the dispenser hole (pic 2 and 3) causing leakage/flow which can be seen in picture 2.

I’ve done a couple more tests, applying pressure to close the lid tighter and there is ZERO leakage. Completely stopped. No sign of leak/backflow underneath either.

Now, the quandary, how do fix the lid so it closes tighter? 

The mechanism inside feels like there’s a little give in terms of where it’s in the lid, but it’s negligible. The lid feels like it’s closed and secure too apart from when I push down on it and it shifts a couple of millimetres.

I know this is probably a thing for customer service, but the last time I called they were useless and made me go through everything I’d already done for the same result. And frankly, I’m bored of their zero ability to resolve things. 

Anyone had any success with lid fixes or similar gasket seal fixing?

Thanks

I'm a 5'2 southeast Asian guy who's never asked a woman out in my life, having been through 7 serious relationships and over a dozen people dated only thanks to changing attitudes in the last decade and the sheer grace of the incredible women who showed interest in me. Please bear with me as I am mildly autistic (diagnosed, formerly Asperger's) and suspect that my understanding or ability to have romantic relationships is impacted by this.

The ways I've been described within the first few dates:

* Bob Ross (angry military dude -> chill peace lover)
* Sweetest guy they've ever gone out with
* Safe and calming to the nervous system (especially for anxious / neurodiverse people)
* ""The booktok experience"" / ""too pretty""

I've never had a bad date. *All* of my dates have been positive for both myself and the other person - again, I think this indicates something is off with how I approach things. Things have always played out in a similar fashion:

1. Within a few days of being back on Hinge (dating app), I'll have been asked out by several matches so I go with the one who I vibe with most and we connect on Instagram
2. We meet for something casual like coffee, sometimes they're very forward about wanting to go back to mine or theirs but otherwise I don't bring up the topic
3. If we spent the night, I've always been asked for exclusivity immediately. Otherwise, the second date has been where they would decide on continuing as friends / fwb or that they wanted to take things seriously

I know that it seems ""fast"" but each of these people were very forward and certain about what they wanted at that time, while making me feel emotionally safe. I was also genuinely attracted to them; I've tried to debate with myself whether I'm just settling but even in retrospect, these women were absolutely beautiful, kindhearted, and unbelievably generous to me. They've also all stayed connected except for 3 who have had to block me only because they couldn't stop themselves from reaching out after things ended.

Typically in a relationship I'd see them anywhere from once every 2 weeks to once or twice a week, I'd make sure to text them in the morning/night, but never any calls except my most recent relationship who sparked this as she was just the perfect energy that I'm looking for. I've been playfully laughed at by my coworkers (mostly women) who insist that this is NOT a relationship and I suspect that here they have another point; I'll enthusiastically anticipate and respond to bids for attention but I never make my own bids for attention. This might even be related to having never asked anyone out as I am constantly experiencing a sense of ""gosh, *she* wants to spend time with *me*?"" when my *girlfriend* would ask to see me.

Which means that relationships often stagnated and I know at least one girlfriend was trying to communicate this to me through song lyrics. My suspicion is that there's probably been frustration around this yet at the same time, not knowing how to ""blame"" me for it because it was very much my own fault. My girlfriends would go above and beyond to let me down gently, insisting that it was all positive and not knowing what to say besides ""this isn't it"". The only constructive ""criticism"" I've received has been:

* Love yourself
* You need to realize you're really f\*ing attractive

Recently I broke up with someone who absolutely revitalized my enthusiasm for dating as it was such a great short-lived experience with possibly the most chemistry and most attractive personality so far, yet she had a lot of circumstances which were terrible on paper and ultimately did me a favor because I would've dug her out of her troubles on top of providing for her kids. It's made me happier and more hopeful because now I know what I'm looking for and I know people like her exist out there, yet maybe I'm also scared that I'll forever bounce around great relationships but never finding someone who wants to keep me.",0,1748922931.0,self,0,0.5,False

This is hard to explain, but I have noticed I do this thing sometimes, when I get triggered: Like bang a part of my body on something or burn my hands, or basically do something where I feel quite significant pain, which then distracts me from the trigger.

Like someone might mention briefly about getting hospitalized years ago after a bicycle came out of nowhere on the sidewalk one morning and bumped into them really badly so they had to go to the ER for severely bruised ribs and that they had the terrible pain for like 3 months.

They might just be telling me this because they just bought a bicycle or saw a movie or anything. They are not in pain now and don't mean to make me anxious, but I get triggered regardless and I think the event stays with me after the conversation is over because I notice I'm dropping things afterward or overeat or do something else that shows me I'm nervous and got triggered.

This is the time I have to be careful because I become very prone to hurting myself. It's stupid because why would I do that and how does self-harm prevent anything?

But the original trigger which is probably about loss of control and life's unpredictabilities and unknowable harm is probably so strong that maybe I need a painful distraction I can do something about. For instance, if I burn my lips from accidentally warming my coffee for 2 minutes in the microwave than 20 seconds, I will apply a cream or cold water to it or something else, but it's something I can do something about here and now. And more importantly, I sort of forget about the earlier conversation and the bigger fear of threats being ever present and in everything. Now the threat is one thing. And I can focus on fixing that one thing. But I can't worry about bicycles, cars, airplanes, diseases, earthquakes, losing family members, wars, and on and on and on.

# Best Rugs 10x14 (2025): Find Your Perfect Style!

A 10x14 rug isn't just a floor covering; it's a statement piece that can define the entire aesthetic of a large room. These rugs are essential for anchoring furniture arrangements, adding warmth and texture, and unifying disparate elements within a space. Selecting the right 10x14 rug is crucial for creating a harmonious and visually appealing surroundings.

Whether you're aiming for a cozy living room, a complex dining area, or a luxurious master bedroom, the right rug can elevate the design and enhance the overall comfort of your home.

## Key Features Analysis

A 10x14 rug offers a significant canvas for various designs and materials. Let's delve into the key features that differentiate high-quality rugs in this size category.

**Material Composition:** The material used in a 10x14 rug significantly affects its durability, feel, and appearance. Options range from natural fibers like wool, cotton, and silk to synthetic materials such as polypropylene, polyester, and viscose. Wool rugs are known for their resilience and warmth,while cotton rugs are often more affordable and easier to clean. Synthetic rugs offer stain resistance and are ideal for high-traffic areas.

The choice of material should depend on your lifestyle, budget, and desired aesthetic.

**Knot Density/Pile Height:** For woven rugs, knot density is a critical indicator of quality and durability. A higher knot density means a more intricate and long-lasting rug. Pile height refers to the length of the fibers that create the rug's surface. A high pile height offers a plush and luxurious feel, while a low pile height is more practical for areas where furniture is frequently moved.

Different weaving techniques and pile heights can dramatically alter the rug’s texture and overall look.

**Design and Pattern:** 10x14 rugs come in a vast array of designs, from traditional Persian and Oriental patterns to contemporary geometric and abstract motifs.The design should complement the existing décor of the room and reflect your personal style. Color palettes can range from neutral and understated to bold and vibrant, depending on the desired mood and ambiance.

Consider the scale of the pattern in relation to the size of the room and furniture.

**Construction Method:** The construction method of a rug impacts its durability, texture, and overall value.Hand-knotted rugs are considered the highest quality, as they are meticulously crafted by skilled artisans. Hand-tufted rugs offer a similar look at a more affordable price point. machine-made rugs are the most budget-pleasant option and are ideal for areas where frequent replacement is expected.

Understanding the construction method helps determine the rug’s longevity and maintenance requirements.

**Stain Resistance and cleanability:** The ability of a rug to resist stains and be easily cleaned is an crucial consideration, especially for households with children or pets. Many synthetic rugs are inherently stain-resistant, while natural fiber rugs may require special treatments or professional cleaning.Darker colors and busy patterns can also help to conceal stains and dirt.

Look for rugs with stain-resistant coatings or those made from inherently stain-resistant materials.**Underlay Compatibility:** Using a rug underlay or pad is crucial for preventing slippage, protecting the floor beneath, and extending the life of the rug. The underlay should be the correct size and material to provide adequate cushioning and support. Some underlays also offer additional benefits, such as moisture resistance and sound insulation.

Ensure the underlay is compatible with both the rug and the type of flooring you have.

## Core Benefits

Investing in the right 10x14 rug provides numerous benefits that enhance both the aesthetic and functional aspects of your living space.

**Defines and Anchors Space:** A large 10x14 rug effectively defines a large living area by visually anchoring the furniture arrangement. It creates a sense of cohesion and order, preventing the furniture from feeling scattered or disjointed. A rug in this size helps to group furniture, like sofas, chairs, and coffee tables, into a unified seating area.

This creates a more inviting and comfortable atmosphere for relaxation and conversation.

**Adds Warmth and comfort:** Rugs provide a layer of insulation that adds warmth and comfort to a room, particularly on hard flooring surfaces like tile or hardwood. A 10x14 rug can significantly reduce the chill in a room, creating a cozier and more inviting environment. This is especially beneficial during colder months, making the space feel warmer and more comfortable underfoot.

The added warmth enhances the overall comfort level of the room.

**Enhances Acoustic Properties:** Large rugs can improve the acoustic properties of a room by absorbing sound and reducing echoes. This is especially beneficial in rooms with high ceilings or hard surfaces that tend to amplify sound. A 10x14 rug can dampen noise levels, creating a quieter and more peaceful environment.

The improved acoustics make the room more conducive to relaxation and conversation.

**Protects Flooring:** Rugs act as a protective barrier between furniture and the floor, preventing scratches, dents, and other damage. This is particularly critically important for delicate flooring materials like hardwood or tile. A 10x14 rug can protect a large area of the floor from wear and tear, helping to maintain its appearance and value over time.

This protection saves on costly repairs or replacements in the long run.

**Elevates Style and Design:** A rug is a versatile design element that can instantly elevate the style and design of a room.10x14 rugs are available in a wide range of colors, patterns, and textures, allowing you to create a customized look that reflects your personal taste. Whether you prefer a traditional, modern, or eclectic style, the right rug can tie the entire room together and make a statement.

The rug becomes a focal point that enhances the overall aesthetic appeal of the space.## FAQs Section

Understanding common questions can help you make an informed decision when purchasing a 10x14 rug.

**What size rug pad should I use with a 10x14 rug?**
The rug pad should be slightly smaller than the rug itself, typically about 1-2 inches shorter on each side. This ensures that the pad is fully concealed and doesn't extend beyond the edges of the rug. A pad that is too large can bunch up and create a tripping hazard.

A properly sized pad also allows the rug to lay flat and evenly distribute weight.**How often should I clean my 10x14 rug?**
The frequency of cleaning depends on the rug's material, the amount of traffic it receives, and whether you have pets or children. Generally,vacuuming the rug 1-2 times per week is recommended to remove surface dirt and debris. Professional cleaning should be done every 12-18 months to remove deep-seated stains and maintain the rug's appearance.

Spot cleaning spills promptly is crucial to prevent permanent staining.

**Can I use a 10x14 rug in a bedroom?**
yes, a 10x14 rug can be an excellent choice for a master bedroom, especially if the room is large. The rug can be placed under the bed with enough rug extending on the sides and foot of the bed to provide a soft and comfortable surface to step on. In a bedroom, a rug can add warmth, texture, and visual interest, creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere.

Consider the placement of furniture and the overall layout of the room when choosing a rug size.

**What's the best way to prevent my 10x14 rug from slipping on hardwood floors?**
Using a rug pad specifically designed for hardwood floors is the most effective way to prevent a rug from slipping. These pads provide a non-slip surface that grips both the rug and the floor,preventing movement. Avoid using double-sided tape or other adhesives, as they can damage the hardwood finish.

Regularly check the pad to ensure it's still providing adequate grip and replace it if necessary.

Also big on books, learning languages (currently on Japanese and German), and just exploring new cultures in general.

I’m more of a mountain-and-coffee than club-and-shot type of guy. Solo travel? Big yes. Quiet sunrises? Even bigger yes.
Work-wise, life’s kinda wild—I run a marketing agency, work with an American company, and manage an NGO and school for kids who deserve better. So yeah, my schedule is chaotic—but I’m passionate about it.

What I’m looking for:
A long-term friend. Someone I can talk to regularly. Could be about deep life stuff or stupid memes. Could be voice notes at 2am or random “you gotta hear this song” moments. I’m open-minded, respectful, and not here to waste anyone’s time.
And no, I won’t ghost you. I know how to hold a convo and actually enjoy it.

If you’re down to talk, just tell me your age and gender when you message. That’s all.
Let’s make something cool out of this.

I contacted their customer support to complain about this, and after sending them pictures upon their request, they finally got back saying that the purple tint is likely due to a common reaction from the dye and that it doesn’t affect performance or durability in any way. So they’re  admitting that there is a defect in their product, but they’re not offering any apology or form of compensation. They try to make is seem like I’m complaining about nothing—as I tried to convey to them in my subsequent response, I wouldn’t expect a running garment which retails for 230 USD to leak dye and become discolored after such little use.

I wanted to start a thread asking people what they personally do to be less chronically online. 

What magazines/newspapers do you choose to read physical copies of, instead of reading them on your phone? What places do you go to (outside of work) to connect with people in real life? What non-technological rituals do you have to disconnect and spend some time in the real world? How many times do you say “fuck AI” on your day to day? 

I’ve been feeling really overwhelmed by technology lately. Everyone seems to get all their information from IG/TikTok. Can’t seem to stay in the loop or find a new coffee shop to go to without scrolling on my phone. 

I’ll start 

After my morning runs at McCarren I’ve started stopping by a newsstand on Manhattan Ave and buying the physical NYT paper. I don’t care how cumbersome it is to read it old fashion. I prefer it now. 

I’ve also been reading a lot of manga / comic books when I’m too tired/ADD to read a book, but dont want to stare at my TV (yet another screen). 

Also, running club and yoga studios have proved to be great places to make new friends.

1l21yc9,https://www.reddit.com/r/askfitness/comments/1l21yc9/from_bullied_to_building_my_legs_what_are_the/,From Bullied to Building My Legs: What Are the Best Leg Workouts to Get Strong?,"Hey r/askfitness , I’ve got a story to share, and I need your help. I’m Jake, 29, from Chicago. Growing up, I was the “chubby kid” who got picked last in gym class. Kids at school called me “Jelly Legs” because I could barely run a lap without wheezing. The worst was in high school when a group of jocks laughed at me during a dodgeball game, saying my legs looked like “toothpicks stuck in a marshmallow.” That stung. I avoided mirrors, hated my body, and honestly, I hated my life for a while.Fast forward to last year. I was 28, working a desk job, still carrying extra weight, and feeling like I’d never escape that “weak” label. Then I saw a video of a guy squatting double his body weight, looking like he could kick through a brick wall. Something clicked. I didn’t care about being skinny—I wanted to be strong. I wanted legs that could carry me through anything, not just physically but mentally.I joined a gym, super nervous at first. I’d sneak in at odd hours to avoid the “gym bros” staring. My first leg day was a disaster—my quads were screaming after one set of bodyweight squats. But I kept at it. I started with basic stuff: bodyweight lunges, some light dumbbell goblet squats, and a lot of falling over. Six months later, I’m squatting 135 pounds, leg pressing 300, and feeling like a different person. My legs aren’t just stronger—they’re starting to look strong. For the first time, I’m not embarrassed to wear shorts.Here’s the thing, though: I know I’ve barely scratched the surface. I see guys and girls at the gym with tree-trunk quads and explosive power, and I want that. I’m ready to level up my leg game, but the internet’s a mess of conflicting advice. Some say heavy barbell squats and deadlifts are king. Others swear by Bulgarian split squats or sprint intervals. And don’t get me started on all the “hack squat vs. leg press” debates. I’m lost.So, Reddit, I’m turning to you. What are the absolute best leg workouts for building strength and size? I’m 5’10”, 200 pounds, and my goal is to squat 2x my body weight by next year. I’ve got access to a full gym (barbells, dumbbells, machines, the works). Should I focus on compound lifts? Isolation moves? How many days a week should I train legs? And any tips for a guy who’s still fighting that “Jelly Legs” voice in his head?Bonus: I ran into one of those high school jocks last week at a coffee shop. He didn’t recognize me at first, but when he did, he said, “Damn, Jake, you look like you could crush me now.” It felt good. But I want to keep pushing—not for him, but for me.

And its all over the place 
Long story short 
Girl got pregnant 
Her Mom made her abort 
This was over ten years ago 
I was going to join the air force and had a ship out date. 
I woke up one day to this girl hugging me in a weird way and I never saw her again. 
Kid gone 
Prospect of my soon to be wife as we planned marriage 
Gone 
Just disappeared 
Poor
This is just say Girl 1 

Had another relationship lasting a while though she was 11 years older than me 
Cheated on me 
At the same time my truck broke down 
I got two staff infections and almost lost my legs  
I got slammed into a wall and a piece of metal went through my leg 
I had to move back home 
Lost my house 
Lost my truck cuz the transmission blew 
Lost my job 
Lost my girlfriend
Girl 2 but not important 
She got a DUI one night and I had to sit around waiting for her to get bailed out while my mom was calling me telling me my dog was dying throwing up having seizures 
And she died that night 
And I wasn’t there 

Relationship wise I’ve been a wreck ever since and this pregnancy was two years after graduation high school 
(High school I got to clean up blood for Easter and thanksgiving as my mom had cut her arteries three times trying to commit suicide and I couldn’t convince anyone she was doing it because I didn’t have proof?? Like the blood pool that my dog was laying in finally I found a suicide note and she got taken to a facility 
Which didn’t go well came home and did it again 
All while I went to school 
Let alone being so poor I started working at 13 so I could eat and have a few bucks going to school cuz I couldn’t event afford lunch 

But as my mom slit her vain and as it is dripping in the floor and my dog is licking it up while my mom still had hep c and I only found out cuz I went to go get a bowl of cereal and tried saying I’m sorry for arguing and didn’t get a response. 
Walking over to her the amount of blood that was there I visually didn’t even see it and was like why is my dog licking up something then…. The floor turned red 
911 of course 
Paramedics 
And then 

Here I am 16 years old 

Getting to clean up a tremendous amount of my mother’s blood out of the cream colored carpet. 
Happy thanksgiving 
Oh and more 
She had hepatitis C and at the age of 5 I was told my mom had only a couple years to live 
8 chemo treatments later and countless doctors and etc the works 
6 months free she FINALLY got the all clear
Than She was walking across the st and got hit by a car 
I can’t tell you the amount of times I’ve answered a phone to hear my mom is dead on a surgery table and they’re trying to revive her 
Or at a friends house and getting a knock on the door to say hey everyone is trying to reach you 
(Since I didn’t and could afford a phone till after around 18 years old) and was told my mom is in critical condition after the car accident 
She had brain damage and fractures and breaks 
She’s undergone three humongous surgeries where that’s has been a nightmare of let’s put metal cages around your spine not counting all the “minor surgeries” 
I’ve never gotten a life with my mom 
It’s been a nightmare for as long as I can remember 
And with her surgeries they’ve gone totally blinkers 

Oh let’s take the metal out 
Oh let’s put them back in 
My mom walked in the shape of an L 


Woe as me etc 
Just background noise I guess 

So after getting hurt from the leg ordeal I work on getting a degree in chemistry 
With another girl 
Happens to be an ex 
I got a domestic violence charge for literally touching her because she was spitting in my face 
My bad got it don’t need to discuss this 
Did my time
I’m on probation and I meet another girl 
We’ve been together for 7 years today 
We finally got engaged after my drinking problems and extensive fighting and arguing 

Probably clear as day already 

But then I reach out to the prior girl I got pregnant as a reach of comfort and then we almost got back together after finally moving into our own place with what’s supposed to be my current fiancé 
So it’s been a battle ever since She was talking to guys because I cheated on her with girl 1 
I get it I messed up but I was scared first time in life own place never have I seen a working functional family that pays bills since my mom has been in disability for my entire life practically 

During all this I become a firefighter 
While working on chemistry 
Then I get a job with an amazing gold mining company 
Rather not say which 
And that’s been a shit show with my mental health and physical health 
I had to get a back surgery 
Which I had an old hernia a new hernia and a chronic fracture still currently in my spine 
Now I’m messed up taking meds 
Then my dad just died last September because he had dementia at the age of 64 it was rapid and I barely got to say anything about my new direction in life with schooling and chemistry 

(I failed algebra 1 four times in high school and I now have a minor in mathematics) 
I sacrificed every waking hour for five years getting this degree 
Cuz I apparently am struggling at everything for some reason 
But back to my dad I broke down and nearly drank myself into a coma for two weeks and of course my relationship took a huge plummet 
Idk how many times I’ve been told to pack my stuff and leave 
Then during this my mom had another surgery 
After I had joined AA and was sober for nine months or whatever until last week after I was physically struggling to make a chicken coop when I said chickens were not a great idea right now 

During my surgery she went to see her ex 
8 or more times 
Goin on dinner dates 
And apparently as far as I know went to his house twice 
Getting home close to midnight 
While I got to sit in bed for a month after a back surgery 

And then during last thanksgiving her brothers wife started taking diet pills 
Well she passed out went into a coma for nearly three months and had such severe brain damage 
She died three hours after her 30th birthday just a couple months ago 
We had just gone out to visit for a family vacation and all was absolutely normal 

And now 
Once again fighting for four weekend in a row 
Continuously this girl is giving my ring back “as this is how serious I am” and it’s like no a ring is a commitment it something you flick off like a nickel waiting to see if it landed in the side you secretly are hoping for but don’t have the courage to speak 

I get I make mistakes and mess up 
I’m always the first to apologize 
Own my mistakes 
And accept it 
I scream I yell I am explosive but I am literally losing my mind 
I’m taking hand fulls of meds now 30mg of Lexi pro daily 
And then I’ve had hemroids so bad I’ve lost so much blood I’m anemic and finally after drinking and breaking down and saying screw it because I can’t physically take it mentally take it and I have four itty bitty lives to take care of and she hasn’t even gone out there to the 1000$ coop I’ve built let alone saying she can’t pay an electric bill though was gimme pay a portion of the near 1200$ she said she would give me back after I’ve bought things and helped and over spent when I felt I had to 

Only to always be cold shouldered and dismissed and never allowed to say my side because when I do it’s “here’s the ring and pack your sh%# like what the heck 
I have been working so hard to better myself only to be left with this job


I get it probably sounds clear as day but when everything is tied together the times the house the boxes the separation 
The splitting of two dogs 
The chicken coop 


Today because she is mad after giving the ring back and me drinking again and then reaching out to pregnant girl 
Who has a kid and wife now And just wanted to maturely be apart of one another’s life and just like be friends and soulmates? I get that comes off selfishly and makes her insecure especially after all that’s happened and almost leaving my fiancé for girl 1 which is obviously not even a possibility now and that’s fine 
Probably for the best 
But currently 
Trying to apologize and make up for speaking to girl 1 and all that was said is I think about you every day 
Yea pushing it for sure 
But not cut my head off 
Brought her a coffee and a card and then got her an hour tattoo session at this bada55 shop she goes too and then got roses and had rose pedals in a bubble bath candles and a bottle of wine which is our favorite one and is expensive and had a glass poured 
And apparently I lit her up cuz I said we haven’t once talked about why I reached out to someone when I’m constantly given a ring of commitment back??
 

I am and have lost my friggen mind and idk what to do or where to go 

And with all this said. Use your imagination to fill in the rest from the current 7 year relationship to the over 10 year pregnancy (oh she didn’t get me a single thing for our anniversary today btw) 

I seriously need some help 
Be mean 
Be real 
I criticize myself worse than any of you can so let’s gooo 😎 live laugh toaster bath 


Edit:I guess the shpeel before with all my life crap that isn’t so much relationship related for this thread and post 
Today is still my seven year anniversary 
I have built a chicken coop with my bare hands 
It’s amazing 
For chickens I said no too 
And I decided to drink over memorial weekend because I was so stressed my hemorrhoids were gushing blood every day till the toilet turned black and I was dizzy at work and had to make this stupid coop because the chickens were getting big and now I’m in love with them and they literally live in a Dubai mansion 
It’s awesome 
But with that said 
The moment I drank and “relaxed” I stopped bleeding when I used the bathroom 

Here I go again 


But I’m dealing with someone who is blaming me saying I’m a cheating liar when I was upfront about her finding the message I sent to girl 1  yet can’t even get the chance to say I’m hurt and felt alone 
I don’t go out every week like she does 
I work 
I have gotten to work at 6am in the morning and got off at 430 I finally broke down and my body gave out 
And I have zero support 
I was working in the coop for a couple weeks till almost 9 at night 
Let alone the regular house chores I beg to have help for 
I don’t cook often cuz I don’t eat much 
But I vacuum like crazy 
Clean the house 
Mop 
Scrub 
Water the grass 
Cut the grass 
Got the entire flower bed redone with mulch 
The roses are finally thriving and blowing up 
Grass has almost no weeds after it looking like a meth house when we got here 
And I’ve done all this after healing over a back surgery and having to quite Being a fire fighter 
Plus I need toe surgery cuz I ripped a tendon 
And I also have a cut tendon in my hand 
And both my pinkies are number 

And I’m just straight like how
How can I be a better man for this woman and I’m screwed because I wanted to talk to someone I felt like was the closest thing I had to a family and someone I didn’t have to say much for them to also get it 
Yea I should I hate her after abandoning me 


But this entire talk and stuff I’ve said just is like I have gotten so far with so little and this girl is hounding me and I’m so stuck in this hell hole financially 
I’m 93,000$ in debt too like bruuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhh ",1,1748921223.0,relationship_advice,6,0.57,False

1l21qe0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1l21qe0/ive_struggled_my_whole_life_with_being_a_people/,I’ve struggled my whole life with being a people pleaser and not knowing how to set boundaries and saying no…,"So basically I (23F) met this person (27M) at a mixer/networking event at my school for TV/Film/Acting/etc. That was about a month or so ago. He eventually reached out to me to collaborate on a project with his friend. I was super stoked and excited to finally officially start voice acting and doing actual projects with people. We met up cuz he wanted to vet me, get to know me more to make sure I wasn’t gonna flake on him or anything like that. He mentioned that some people have flaked in the past and wanted to make sure I wasn’t gonna do that. Fair enough, I completely get that. 

It was chill. He seemed nice and friendly at first. I mentioned to him that I had social anxiety and trouble socializing so he knew that about me from pretty much the beginning. He seemed encouraging at the time so I thought that was good. At one point he mentioned his group of friends and the fact that a female was included in his group made me feel more at ease because in my head that meant that he was gonna be chill and would treat me platonically and professionally. Idk maybe my thought process was dumb about that lol. 

Anyways we chat for a while and it was chill and friendly. Nothing odd or strange. I’m generally a friendly and kind person and at some point we were chatting casually with a fellow person who goes to the same school. She referred to us as friends and we were like sure yeah lol I guess we’re friends haha y’know like collaborating on something together and we hugged and chuckled. Idk maybe he took that a different way but in my eyes it was a platonic bro type of hug. Idk. 

Eventually, on a different day, we got together with some other people at the school to do a test recording for the project to see what type of character I might be able to voice. I guess he knew the professor/person who dealt with the recording booth at school and was able to schedule a time slot to record. It was chill. I had fun. Everything seemed pretty normal. He got me a cup of hot water from the Starbucks on campus cuz I had a bit of a sore throat and my voice was a bit crackly. I also double checked that the water wasn’t gonna cost money to get and he was like no yeah water is free. I appreciated him getting me the water. I would’ve done the same thing for anybody else if they were in my position.

After the recording session was over we were walking to a different building cuz I had a class to go to and he had to return some equipment. He was explaining how he wanted to rewatch this one movie but none of his friends wanted to rewatch it with him and invited me to watch it with him because his friend works at the theater and I could get in for free. I have a hard time deciphering things socially sometimes and couldn’t tell if it was just a platonic friend type of thing or something else and I also have a hard time saying no to people so I said sure. 

He was messaging me online pretty much every day. Mostly normal conversations. I spoke to him like how I speak to all of my friends. He eventually asked over message of if I wanted to actually see the movie. I basically said “okay, is it cool if I bring one of my close friends with me as well? He’s a creative type too and I think you’d get along”. I figured if I brought my friend with me and made it a group thing it would make it more apparent that I was only interested in being friends. And also I think if I’m gonna hang around a guy who I haven’t known for a while, it’s just generally safer for me as a female in this world lol. He was like “Ya that’s cool!” And him saying that made me feel better in that specific moment because I was like okay he’s cool with that he must be a good person with good intentions. 

But yeah he messaged me every day and sometimes he said things that could be potentially read as maybe flirting or at least interest, but I didn’t wanna be rude and assume anything. Sometimes I’d call him bro or dude just to be safe. 

He was wanting to meet up again at school and I assumed it was most likely to discuss collaboration related stuff, but I still felt a bit paranoid. Eventually I invited him to this lunch thing me and some other classmates/friends were going to. I figured group settings are better and if we’re in a group he’ll assume things are platonic and also I’m more comfortable in group settings anyway. Also he knows some of the people who went anyway so I figured it’d be chill. I was still anxious though because I overthink everything and it makes me anxious when I think there’s a possibility someone might be hitting on me, especially since I really struggle to set boundaries and say no to people. 

When he entered the establishment, I went in for a high five because I didn’t wanna risk anything, but he hugged me anyway. I felt a bit weird inside but pushed it aside. Later on, without warning, he hugged me again. This hug was definitely a more than friendly hug and I wanted to tell him he was hugging me way too long but the words were stuck in my throat. I didn’t know what to do so I was very awkwardly patting him on the back. He asked me “Why are you patting me on the back? I’m not a dog.” I was like “Oh sorry hahaha I’m just bad at hugging people.” My tone of voice was very obviously anxious and uncomfortable. I was basically in anxiety/dissociation mode and was still patting him on the back because he was still hugging me and was like “You’re still patting me on the back. I’m not a dog” and I was like “Oh haha sorry I’m bad at socializing.” My voice was still obviously very uncomfortable. 

Eventually he let go and I immediately beelined to sit in the corner of a booth next to another that was in the group. I was kinda anxious and dissociating and staring at the floor. He walks up to me and grabs my hand and was inspecting it basically saying how small it is. I very awkwardly said “oh haha yeah I was probably malnourished as a child and stunted my growth.” He also put my hand up to his and compared the sizes. I didn’t know what to do so I limply just let it happen. 

He also brought up the movie he invited me to see. He told the group “Yeah I invited her to see the movie with me but she was like nah fuck off lol.” I was like “No haha I told you me and my friend could go see it with you.”

Eventually we all walked to a coffee shop near by cuz some people wanted some coffee and tea. I was just walking with the group quietly trying not to stand too close to him. He went up to me and was brushing my hair out of my face while I was quiet and uncomfortably staring at the floor in a daze. Then I awkwardly said hi to another friend that was in the group because I just wanted to interact with someone that wasn’t him. 

Eventually we all walked back to the parking lot. He came in a separate car from the rest of us (thank god). I was still kind of dissociating at this point. Before I could even get in the car with my friends, he, without warning, enveloped me in an uncomfortable way too intimate hug. It was obvious I was uncomfortable. I didn’t lean into it. I was actually leaning away. My arms were glued to my side and I was stiff and my shoulders were raised and I was looking away. He kept mentioning the movie and was like “nah why don’t you wanna go with just me. Am I not swag enough?” and I was like “no haha I just prefer group hangouts with my friends.” My voice was very obviously shaky and uncomfortable. Then, still trapping me in the hug by the way, was like “Nahhh I’m not swag enough for you” and I was like “No haha I just prefer group hangouts with my friends” voice still shaky and uncomfy.” I started dissociating more and I think he was talking about him or me being the one to make the plans. All I wanted was for him to let go of me but I was still frozen and dissociating. At that point I just kept responding “I dunno haha” “I dunno haha”. Also my “haha’s” that I do are very quiet, shaky, and clearly uncomfortable. Eventually after what felt like at least a minute or so he let go.

I just remember getting in the car and being like “am I crazy or was he hugging me way too much” and they all agreed. I felt so anxious and overwhelmed and overstimulated that I just started to cry. They were comforting me and being so incredibly sweet to me and I really appreciated it. They were apologizing for not saying anything, they just didn’t know how well we knew Escher or how close we were so they weren’t sure if it would’ve been overstepping a boundary to tell him to back off which I completely understand. They also told me if I was ever gonna be around him in the future to just text any of them and they’d come with me so I wouldn’t be alone. But yeah they were so nice and comforting and I appreciated that a lot. 

Eventually I ended up messaging him and told him the way he was hugging me for way too long and being way too touchy feely with me made me extremely and obviously uncomfortable and that everyone else could tell as well. I said that I was no longer interested in collaborating with him but I wished him luck. I was clear, firm, but polite. I didn’t wanna come off bitchy or anything cuz I’m afraid of him getting mad or bad mouthing me to other people or whatever or maybe I’m just paranoid lol.

But yeah I know he saw my message. He didn’t respond. He did unfollow me and unfriend me though so I hope he got the message loud and clear. I hope he doesn’t do this to another girl in the future. I’m glad what he did was at least in a group in front of people, good and kind people at that. 

So yeah that’s what happened lol. I just don’t quite know how to overcome my fear of setting boundaries and saying no to other people. It almost feels as if I’m physically incapable of making those words come out of my mouth. Especially in that situation where I felt physically trapped. Any advice on how to overcome and fight my mind and body’s urge to shut down instead of speaking up for myself?

Note: I read the rules and know I’m not supposed to ask if I’m paranoid or anything so I just wanna make it clear I’m not asking that haha. I mentioned me calling myself paranoid in what I wrote just to paint a better picture of how my mind worked/works and kinda what my  thought process was/is.",3,1748920906.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

I’ve been testing out these reusable K-Cup pod filters for about a week now in my old Keurig 1.0, and I’m genuinely impressed. They fit snugly, don’t leak grounds, and the coffee tastes just as rich as the store-bought pods, maybe even better since I can use my own blend. Cleaning is simple with a quick rinse, though I’ve tossed them in the dishwasher a few times too. If you’re tired of tossing plastic every morning or just want to cut back on pod costs, these are a no-brainer. Solid value and surprisingly durable.

1l21n4y,https://www.reddit.com/r/swimrun/comments/1l21n4y/first_swimrun_bellingham_swimrun_race_report/,First swimrun - Bellingham swimrun race report,"Hi everyone,

I enjoy race reports on the running subreddits and since I just did my first swimrun last weekend, I figured maybe sharing a race report will get someone else to sign up for a local race. Plus, I just got to get all the stoke out of my system.

This ended up getting super long, but there's some reflections at the bottom that may or may not be interesting for other beginners who don't wanna read my full epos.

# Background

I raced a 70.3 early last summer and spent the rest of the summer thru hiking. Started training for a spring Marathon in January but got too close to injury so I deferred my entry. Swam pretty consistently 2 times a week during that time.

After the marathon deferral, I reflected and realized that a) I need to ramp up my running mileage more carefully for a good marathon build and b) a good mix of difference sports works better for my body. I'd been eyeing swimrun (particularly Orca's Island) since last year and a couple of weeks ago, I just signed up - it seemed like a perfect goal that would provide motivation to ramp up my running while not locking me in too specifically in case there's any hiccups. Also, I'd really been enjoying swimming lately.

Since my wetsuit size was sold out for Orca's rentals, I started researching which one to get and posted to this subreddit. People replied and I was even offered to borrow one to figure out sizing - that's when I first learned how awesome the swimrun community is! When I shared my address (in Seattle), that person was like ""Dude, there's a swimrun in Bellingham this weekend! You should do it!"". I'd been completely unaware of this event! My initial reaction was ""no, I can't"" but talking to my partner, I eventually ran out of excuses. And that's how I ended up signing up for my first swimrun less than 48hrs before the race started.

# Training

Due to my Marathon training, I was in okay running shape. Swimming-wise, I'd worked on my catch a lot recently and also ramped up my swimming to 2-3 sessions per week which probably was helpful. I'd done 2 open water swims this year and obviously, due to me signing up on such short notice, I got zero specific training.

In particular, I swam maybe 400yds with paddles in the past year, so I opted not using any for the race.

# Pre Race

Spent the day before the race last-minute carb loading a little bit and getting a rental car to drive up to Bellingham. This involved going to the airport which takes a little while. I used the time to listen to some ""swimrun 101"" episodes by the lowtideboyz, particularly 5 tips and 5 things to avoid for your first swimrun. Needless to say, it was too late to implement any of them \^\^

I will admit I was a bit nervous. I'd signed up for the ""long course"", consisting of 8 miles of running and 2 miles of swimming. I was confident about the running but my swim sessions usually hovered at around 2300-2500yds and I hadn't done any pull sessions lately. I was worried my shoulders were gonna blow up completely and / or that I was gonna be much much slower than everybody else and miss course markings or so when I was all alone. Eventually, I realized that not knowing how it's gonna go kind of is the part that makes it an adventure and I let it go. Worst case, I'll jog around the lake back to the start and call it a learning, right?

Woke up at 5:45 that Sunday and drove up to Bellingham. Had some overnight oats for breakfast and some much needed coffee on the drive.

I arrived a bit early and had some time to chat people up and check out Lake Padden. Everyone was super friendly and welcoming. The loaner wetsuit fit like a glove and I spent the rest of the time figuring out how to deal with my glasses - due to the short timeline, I didn't have time to get contacts and so I was stuck with my prescription goggles and eyeglasses. I ended up opting for a hardcase for my glasses shoved into the wetsuit and it worked reasonably well.

# The Course

The race is around Lake Padden. The swims are across the lake and the runs are individual loops near the lake. There's very little backtracking and every run is a new little surprise. It's hilly but not overly technical through beautiful lushest PNW greenery. I absolutely loved the course!

# Race

After a short briefing, the gun goes off. I started wearing my goggles because the first run leg is less than half a mile. I'm surprised how well I can see in my goggles. I line in behind a dad and his son who are racing together.

We hit the first swim (\~750yds) and boy does this one feel weird. I go out too fast, the pull-buoy slips from between my legs a couple of times, my sighting is okay but not great. The swim takes us across the lake. I finally hit the shore and feel pretty gassed. But: I'm not the last guy. Phew!

The 2nd run leg (1.4mi) leads up to a little ridge (the climb of which is a speedhike for me) and back down again. I pass some people. This makes me feel more confident that I'm not gonna be too slow. I actually opt to keep wearing my prescription goggles for all but the longest run leg which works okay albeit not great. On the plus side, it makes transitions pretty efficient.

I hit the 2nd swim (600yds) which takes us all the way back to the start, which is also where the only aid station is located. This time, I'm more relaxed, I swim with slower, more powerful strokes and generally feel SO much better. I figure out how to rotate my shoulders despite the pull buoy between my legs and that's where I'm becoming fully confident I'll finish all the swims without my shoulders exploding.

Exiting the water, I hit and pass the aid station and instead opt to take one of the Carbs gels I brought and have a few sips of electrolyte drink.

Run 3 goes around the lake a little bit, before Swim 3 only clips the edge of the lake and is pretty short. The exit is rocky but not overly tricky and we're rewarded with a nice Run 4 (.68mi). Swim 4 takes us back to the start again. This time, I refill my electrolytes and take another gel as it's the last time we're passing the aid station.

Run 5 is super short again (.35mi) before Swim 5 the longest swim of the day (780ft) awaits. I feel better and better and even start catching up to a few people on the swims now!

Run 6 is by far the longest run segment at 3.88mi. I stop by a table in the picknick area to remove swimcap and goggles, and switch into my eyeglasses. Running is immediately so much more fun. The run starts out flat before transitioning to a long-ish climb through the forest which I run-hike. We're rewarded with a super flowy downhill, followed by two more smaller climbs and downhills. I spend most of this section alone, as I seem to be in between groups. Maybe it's for the best because in between electrolytes, 3 gels, probably a liter of lake water and 6 iterations of going from horizontal to vertical, my stomach gets a little crampy and gassy. My stomach feels better by the time I approach the lake shore. A pretty strong runner passes me. I use the flat and easy gravel path around the lake to put my swimcap back on and switch into my goggles. The last swim is only 415yds and so I try to push it. I catch the guy who just passed me running and try my hardest to catch another person in front of me. Not really because I'm actually competitive but more so because I'm so overjoyed with how confident I've felt basically since after swim 1. I don't sight well enough and so I don't manage to catch him but at least this pushed me to finish strong. I cross the finish line and receive a ton of fist bumps. Immediately people are curious how each other's respective races went and the vibe is awesome as everyone cheers for the remaining people finishing.

Finished in something around 2:40 but don't care about the time at all. Super happy with how comfortable it ended up feeling, though.

# Post-race reflections

Randomly collected thoughts:

* This is such a fun sport! Such a great community!
* Swimming without paddles was no problem at all and would defo recommend if one isn't used to it
* I'm wearing contacts next time
* Since almost all segments are relatively short, it is super tempting to go fast. I ended up in mid/upper Z3 for most of the runs (no idea about the swims). Will keep that in mind during longer races where I need to conserve energy.
* I think you don't need to be able to do the individual cumulated distance per discipline beforehand. The 80% rule I sometimes find sounds reasonable, maybe even a little less would be sufficient.
* Usually, my gut is really strong and I have no problem downing 120g+ of carbs and 1L of liquid per hour. Swimrunning hit differently, though. Need to figure out why and what to do about it.
* I need to figure out the pull-buoy. My most sore muscle post race are the ones clenching the thing.
* The swim really is what decides if the race is going to suck or not. I was glad being a strong enough swimmer despite only swimming for \~1.5yrs and having an okay catch.
* Huge shoutout to the race organizers and all the volunteers! The race was organized super well. Didn't miss a single turn despite wearing my goggles for most of the runs and always knew where I needed to go!",2,1748920611.0,swimrun,0,1.0,False

[$500],"I know that similar questions have been posed in the past, so sorry for asking similar questions, but as the title states, I am looking to invest in my espresso equipment and am at an impasse. I bought a Casabrews CM5418 almost 2 years ago and have been using my roommates SMEG grinder that isn't really for espresso (I only found out recently), and given that I am moving soon, I wanted to use the opportunity to revamp my coffee bar.

As the title said, I am debating on either spending $200 on a better grinder or getting a new machine instead and waiting on a machine. I understand the Casabrews isn't great quality, but with pressured basket, it pulls decent enough shots for me for now. However, I have a feeling it won't stand the test of time, so I thought maybe I could get the BBE as people who like it on this sub as a daily driver seem to love it and it would likely make good enough espresso for my needs. Having said that, I like the idea of being able to have a grinder that can allow me to do french press or pour over if I don't want espresso, so the Baratza checks those boxes. However, I just don't want to buy that to find that the CM5418 breaks down or will still make mediocre espresso and I'm suddenly having to spend a ton on a new machine as well sooner than expected.

Open to suggestions for Baratza + new machine ideas that would fall into similar price range as the BBE. Appreciate the advice in advance!

EDIT: I do have a bottomless portafilter for this, not just the pressurized one, but since our grinder doesn't work super well, I haven't gotten any good experience with it.",1,1748920329.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

My copy is worn and seen some mileage, and it’s pretty dated now. 

Another one I pick up randomly sometimes is Star Trek Phase 2 The Lost Years by Garfield and Judith Reeves Stevens. I’ve always been fascinated by the Star Trek series we got so close to getting before TMP. It includes, scripts and photos and the progress of its development. 

I know I could go online and get the same info, but there is just a charm in picking them up, going to a random chapter and absorbing the info. I am saddened these types of books are not as commonly published nowadays. 

Do any of you relate to this? If so, which book should I add to the coffee table?

So basically I (23F) met this person (27M) at a mixer/networking event at my school for TV/Film/Acting/etc. That was about a month or so ago. He eventually reached out to me to collaborate on a project with his friend. I was super stoked and excited to finally officially start voice acting and doing actual projects with people. We met up cuz he wanted to vet me, get to know me more to make sure I wasn’t gonna flake on him or anything like that. He mentioned that some people have flaked in the past and wanted to make sure I wasn’t gonna do that. Fair enough, I completely get that. 

It was chill. He seemed nice and friendly at first. I mentioned to him that I had social anxiety and trouble socializing so he knew that about me from pretty much the beginning. He seemed encouraging at the time so I thought that was good. At one point he mentioned his group of friends and the fact that a female was included in his group made me feel more at ease because in my head that meant that he was gonna be chill and would treat me platonically and professionally. Idk maybe my thought process was dumb about that lol. 

Anyways we chat for a while and it was chill and friendly. Nothing odd or strange. I’m generally a friendly and kind person and at some point we were chatting casually with a fellow person who goes to the same school. She referred to us as friends and we were like sure yeah lol I guess we’re friends haha y’know like collaborating on something together and we hugged and chuckled. Idk maybe he took that a different way but in my eyes it was a platonic bro type of hug. Idk. 

Eventually, on a different day, we got together with some other people at the school to do a test recording for the project to see what type of character I might be able to voice. I guess he knew the professor/person who dealt with the recording booth at school and was able to schedule a time slot to record. It was chill. I had fun. Everything seemed pretty normal. He got me a cup of hot water from the Starbucks on campus cuz I had a bit of a sore throat and my voice was a bit crackly. I also double checked that the water wasn’t gonna cost money to get and he was like no yeah water is free. I appreciated him getting me the water. I would’ve done the same thing for anybody else if they were in my position.

After the recording session was over we were walking to a different building cuz I had a class to go to and he had to return some equipment. He was explaining how he wanted to rewatch this one movie but none of his friends wanted to rewatch it with him and invited me to watch it with him because his friend works at the theater and I could get in for free. I have a hard time deciphering things socially sometimes and couldn’t tell if it was just a platonic friend type of thing or something else and I also have a hard time saying no to people so I said sure. 

He was messaging me online pretty much every day. Mostly normal conversations. I spoke to him like how I speak to all of my friends. He eventually asked over message of if I wanted to actually see the movie. I basically said “okay, is it cool if I bring one of my close friends with me as well? He’s a creative type too and I think you’d get along”. I figured if I brought my friend with me and made it a group thing it would make it more apparent that I was only interested in being friends. And also I think if I’m gonna hang around a guy who I haven’t known for a while, it’s just generally safer for me as a female in this world lol. He was like “Ya that’s cool!” And him saying that made me feel better in that specific moment because I was like okay he’s cool with that he must be a good person with good intentions. 

But yeah he messaged me every day and sometimes he said things that could be potentially read as maybe flirting or at least interest, but I didn’t wanna be rude and assume anything. Sometimes I’d call him bro or dude just to be safe. 

He was wanting to meet up again at school and I assumed it was most likely to discuss collaboration related stuff, but I still felt a bit paranoid. Eventually I invited him to this lunch thing me and some other classmates/friends were going to. I figured group settings are better and if we’re in a group he’ll assume things are platonic and also I’m more comfortable in group settings anyway. Also he knows some of the people who went anyway so I figured it’d be chill. I was still anxious though because I overthink everything and it makes me anxious when I think there’s a possibility someone might be hitting on me, especially since I really struggle to set boundaries and say no to people. 

When he entered the establishment, I went in for a high five because I didn’t wanna risk anything, but he hugged me anyway. I felt a bit weird inside but pushed it aside. Later on, without warning, he hugged me again. This hug was definitely a more than friendly hug and I wanted to tell him he was hugging me way too long but the words were stuck in my throat. I didn’t know what to do so I was very awkwardly patting him on the back. He asked me “Why are you patting me on the back? I’m not a dog.” I was like “Oh sorry hahaha I’m just bad at hugging people.” My tone of voice was very obviously anxious and uncomfortable. I was basically in anxiety/dissociation mode and was still patting him on the back because he was still hugging me and was like “You’re still patting me on the back. I’m not a dog” and I was like “Oh haha sorry I’m bad at socializing.” My voice was still obviously very uncomfortable. 

Eventually he let go and I immediately beelined to sit in the corner of a booth next to another that was in the group. I was kinda anxious and dissociating and staring at the floor. He walks up to me and grabs my hand and was inspecting it basically saying how small it is. I very awkwardly said “oh haha yeah I was probably malnourished as a child and stunted my growth.” He also put my hand up to his and compared the sizes. I didn’t know what to do so I limply just let it happen. 

He also brought up the movie he invited me to see. He told the group “Yeah I invited her to see the movie with me but she was like nah fuck off lol.” I was like “No haha I told you me and my friend could go see it with you.”

Eventually we all walked to a coffee shop near by cuz some people wanted some coffee and tea. I was just walking with the group quietly trying not to stand too close to him. He went up to me and was brushing my hair out of my face while I was quiet and uncomfortably staring at the floor in a daze. Then I awkwardly said hi to another friend that was in the group because I just wanted to interact with someone that wasn’t him. 

Eventually we all walked back to the parking lot. He came in a separate car from the rest of us (thank god). I was still kind of dissociating at this point. Before I could even get in the car with my friends, he, without warning, enveloped me in an uncomfortable way too intimate hug. It was obvious I was uncomfortable. I didn’t lean into it. I was actually leaning away. My arms were glued to my side and I was stiff and my shoulders were raised and I was looking away. He kept mentioning the movie and was like “nah why don’t you wanna go with just me. Am I not swag enough?” and I was like “no haha I just prefer group hangouts with my friends.” My voice was very obviously shaky and uncomfortable. Then, still trapping me in the hug by the way, was like “Nahhh I’m not swag enough for you” and I was like “No haha I just prefer group hangouts with my friends” voice still shaky and uncomfy.” I started dissociating more and I think he was talking about him or me being the one to make the plans. All I wanted was for him to let go of me but I was still frozen and dissociating. At that point I just kept responding “I dunno haha” “I dunno haha”. Also my “haha’s” that I do are very quiet, shaky, and clearly uncomfortable. Eventually after what felt like at least a minute or so he let go.

I just remember getting in the car and being like “am I crazy or was he hugging me way too much” and they all agreed. I felt so anxious and overwhelmed and overstimulated that I just started to cry. They were comforting me and being so incredibly sweet to me and I really appreciated it. They were apologizing for not saying anything, they just didn’t know how well we knew Escher or how close we were so they weren’t sure if it would’ve been overstepping a boundary to tell him to back off which I completely understand. They also told me if I was ever gonna be around him in the future to just text any of them and they’d come with me so I wouldn’t be alone. But yeah they were so nice and comforting and I appreciated that a lot. 

Eventually I ended up messaging him and told him the way he was hugging me for way too long and being way too touchy feely with me made me extremely and obviously uncomfortable and that everyone else could tell as well. I said that I was no longer interested in collaborating with him but I wished him luck. I was clear, firm, but polite. I didn’t wanna come off bitchy or anything cuz I’m afraid of him getting mad or bad mouthing me to other people or whatever or maybe I’m just paranoid lol.

But yeah I know he saw my message. He didn’t respond. He did unfollow me and unfriend me though so I hope he got the message loud and clear. I hope he doesn’t do this to another girl in the future. I’m glad what he did was at least in a group in front of people, good and kind people at that. 

So yeah that’s what happened lol. I just don’t quite know how to overcome my fear of setting boundaries and saying no to other people. It almost feels as if I’m physically incapable of making those words come out of my mouth. Especially in that situation where I felt physically trapped. ",1,1748920191.0,helpme,0,1.0,False

Oh, okay—about me? Well, I’m Gabriel, 29, from the Philippines. I’m 5'6"", chubby-built, and yes, I’m definitely the smaller spoon. *\[laughs\]*

I work in healthcare, under the wing of a statistician—so, not a frontliner exactly, but still right in the middle of it all. It can get hectic, but I like what I do.

I love running, and I’m planning to start going to the gym again soon. Not because I’m chasing a certain look—I just want to feel stronger and healthier.

I’m big on cooking. If you love food, that works out perfectly, because I’ll happily make you something from scratch. Cooking is kind of my love language.

I’m also a nature geek—put me in a forest or by the sea, and I light up. I get genuinely excited discovering animals or plants I’ve never seen before. It’s one of the reasons I’d love to travel more.

Movies over series, always. Not a gamer, but I’m a bookworm, especially when I find a story that completely pulls me in.

I don’t really party much. I’m more of a homebody—someone who finds peace in keeping things tidy, cozy, and welcoming. I’m the kind of person who’ll make you coffee, fluff your pillow, and ask about your day. That’s just how I show care.

I’m family-oriented. I really admire people who are close to their loved ones or who enjoy simple things, like taking a walk, just talking, being present.

So yeah, that’s me. Bisexual, open-minded, and just hoping to find someone real—someone I can share calm moments with, and maybe a few adventures too.",0,1748920113.0,gaydating,0,0.5,False

The world of literature and historical significance found itself centered on a single, remarkable location on June 2nd, 2025: the ancestral home of the legendary mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan Aiyangar FRS, located in Kumbakonam, Tamil Nadu, India. This unassuming dwelling, now an international monument, offered a poignant glimpse into the life and legacy of a mathematical genius, drawing attention to the power of self-education and the enduring impact of Ramanujan's groundbreaking work.

The narrative began with a casual encounter – a coffee plan with parents that serendipitously led to the doorstep of mathematical history. Situated in a narrow lane off the bustling Sarangapani Sannidhi Street, the traditional house, often obscured by the sprawling branches of a large tree, stands as a testament to the humble origins of a man who redefined mathematical boundaries. Adjacent to a popular coffee spot, the home offers a stark contrast between the everyday and the extraordinary – the mundane routines of modern life juxtaposed with the echoes of Ramanujan's formative years.

The house, a physical embodiment of his early life, has become a place of pilgrimage for those fascinated by his intellectual prowess and the struggles of a self-taught prodigy. Ramanujan, born on December 22, 1887, was a mathematical visionary who made monumental contributions to infinite series, number theory, and mathematical analysis, entirely self-taught. Despite lacking formal training, his innovative approach and unique insights revolutionized mathematics, leaving an indelible mark on the field. He moved through the world with a singular focus, pushing the boundaries of what was known and forging new pathways.

The conversion of the house into an international monument, a move that speaks volumes about its historical importance, occurred in 2003, initiated by the late President of India, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam. This transformation underscored the global recognition of Ramanujan's achievements and ensured the preservation of his legacy for future generations. The monument serves not only as a tribute to his brilliance but also as an inspiration for aspiring mathematicians and researchers, reminding them that greatness can emerge from the most unlikely of settings. The article's invitation to ""join us for a tour"" implied accessibility, indicating a conscious effort to open up the space for public appreciation and discussion.

The essence of the news piece focused on the power of Ramanujan's memory and his achievements. The story highlights the humble surroundings of the house-turned-monument and invites readers to contemplate the journey of a man who defied convention. The emphasis on his self-taught nature further underscores his dedication and ingenuity. It's a tale of extraordinary achievement against seemingly insurmountable odds, suggesting that the location itself, within the context of his incredible legacy, is a symbol of resilience and an example of the powerful human spirit.

The juxtaposition of the ordinary and the exceptional – the coffee shop and the monument, the busy street and the quiet house – creates a vivid picture of the context in which Ramanujan’s genius blossomed. This narrative choice is purposeful, intended to convey a deeper message about the accessibility of brilliance. It’s a story about a man who grew up in a setting similar to many others but achieved greatness nonetheless.

The emphasis on the physical location of the home acts as a reminder of Ramanujan’s humanity. It serves as an emotional anchor for the profound intellectual contributions he made. By focusing on the house, the story humanizes Ramanujan. It invites the reader to not just contemplate his abstract achievements but also reflect on his context.

In essence, the news summary captures a multifaceted narrative: the quiet presence of the monument itself, the profound mathematical contributions of Ramanujan, and the global recognition of his genius. The fact that the story connects the memory of Ramanujan to his humble beginnings, and highlights the place that influenced his upbringing, reminds us of the importance of recognizing the remarkable within the ordinary. The story, focused on a single place, serves as a reminder that the greatest achievements often start from the most unassuming of places. The story celebrates his memory while opening the door to the appreciation of his contributions to mathematics. By describing the location and inviting readers for a virtual tour, it attempts to capture the essence of Ramanujan's life, his work, and his enduring impact on the world.

The drive through extended up from the road in front of the store before whining around the store to the window. The back of the drive through ran along a throughway/parking lot linking all the business in that block.  If the line up was extremely short, you could join, but most of the time the was at least 20 cars long. 

I’m waiting patiently when this car approaches the line from the parking lot at the rear. As he is getting close, I see him glance at me and my disability placard. He smirks at me and drives his car towards mine to force his way into the line. He inched towards my car, still smirking, expecting me to let him in. 

What, he didn’t know was that I have one hell of a temper and I HATE  bullies. I was already having one hell of a day and I wanted my coffee. I lost my shit. I turned my car towards his car, revved the engine and drove towards HIS car, stopping with a few inches to spare.  He called me a crazy fucking bitch and I revved my engine again. He said he just wanted to get in line and I told him he could wait like everyone else. He said he was in a hurry and. I gestured to the line and said we were all in a hurry. I told him there was no fucking way he was getting in front of me and to go fuck himself. He screamed more insults, so I put my car in park and was grabbing my titanium crutch to put a few dents in his car when my daughter finally stopped me. 

He thought he was going to get a quick ego boost by bullying a disabled woman but he picked the wrong person. In the end, he backed away and left, screeching his tires.

1l21azy,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1l21azy/professional_tips_for_better_pour_over/,Professional Tips for Better Pour Over,"I live in Brisbane Australia and at the weekend, Toby's Estate ran a coffee omakase event which I attended.

It was not only a chance to try a bunch of amazing coffees (including a Panama Geisha that tasted like gummy bears) but to question a professional to find out how to get closer to what they're producing.

After I tried the first coffee, I asked a simple question; ""How the fuck do you guys do this?!?!""

I explained that even when my brews are at their best, they still have a background generic coffee flavour which is quite overpowering and covers the flavour notes, which in his cup were super clear!

After going through my set up (V60, Cafe Abaca Filters & Timemore C3) and recipe (4:6 with 5 pours) he shared some wisdom.

1. Ratio - He said the first key is ratio and most grinders produce too many fines and therefore can't handle long ratios like a 1:16+. The first coffee we tasted was brewed at 1:14 and the Geisha at 1:12.5 and they were enough to convince me to try a tighter ratio at home.

2. He never brews hotter than 93°C, even for light roasts. His home kettle has been on 90°C for a year and he said for fruit and floral-forward results, this is absolutely key.

3. ""You're definitely grinding too fine"" - Obviously there's no 'right way' but after hearing my brew times are 3:00-3:10 he said a time of 2:15-2:45 is what he uses to bring out fruitiness. There's still a TON of sweetness because of the tighter ratio but the bitterness that masks acidity is kept at bay 

4. Water - This is a rabbit hole I've explored in the past few months. He confirmed that you can't get the results they get in the cafe with tap or even standard filtered water. As long as it's soft enough (100PPM or less) and consistent then you should be able to dial in your brews.

5. Pours - All of the above combine to REQUIRE 5 pours for adequate agitation and therefore extraction in his view.

So, I went home with some beans from the shop (Indonesian Anaerobic Natural), set my kettle to 90°C, went from 18 to 22 clicks on the C3 and dosed 18g of coffee to 270g water. I used my standard recipe and I actually can't believe how much better the result was. All fruit and sweets, zero harshness and no ""generic coffee"" taste that I've been getting. My only gripe is that it got a little hollow as it cooled so slightly more agitation is needed for a better extraction next time.

TLDR: I changed ratio from 1:17 to 1:15, ground courser to reduce brew time from 3:10 to 2:45 and used 90°C water instead of 95°C and coffee went from good to GREAT! The ratio change is the most transformative as it makes so much sense now that I think about what I want in a pour over.",16,1748919542.0,pourover,4,0.94,False

I didn’t know it then, but you were bending over backwards too, in a much different way. You lied, again, and again and again to frame yourself in what you thought was the best possible light. I remember I cried in a coffee shop when I saw your passport and discovered you lied about your age, the first time I uncovered a lie. A construction worker nearby locked eyes with me while I cried and I felt an unexpected connection with him for a few minutes when I saw pure sympathy in his eyes as he kept looking back at me while he worked.

A hundred more lies later, I no longer saw you as an angel. You continued to take every opportunity to make me think I was crazy. So many absurd coincidences would seem to happen. I stopped believe in them, and then I stopped believe in you. 

Arguments became more and more common, the lies drove a wedge in us that got worse everyday. I never thought I’d see you throw things across the room, and then later ask me why I won’t speak to you, like you’re so approachable... Your other childlike qualities that I once thought were cute and heartwarming just became echoes of immaturity to me. It fell apart about as quickly as it began. 

And so here I am, locked inside my room everyday after work, dreading every encounter with you. I initially thought we could function as roommates, because I need space. I bought you a mattress for your room, but instead you slept on the cold hard floor next to it with a bottle of rum… When will this end?

If I stay with my wife I want to be happy and I want her to be happy. I want to be able to do some of the things I want to do, but those things may make her unhappy. 

So how have you guys in this mixed-faith marriage figured things out? What are examples of all the things you guys have compromised on? What things has your spouse let you do and visa versa? How have you been able to discuss things so that your spouse lets you do things you want to do (that are against the church) without her feeling bad or guilty or like she’s sinning or allowing you to sin?

I’m hoping this makes sense…

I don’t need everyone telling me how it won’t work or it will suck or be super difficult, I already know this. I’m just curious and looking for any examples of instances where it has worked.",3,1748919396.0,exmormon,4,1.0,False

It sounds amazing in theory – a minimalist closet with versatile pieces that all mix and match. But in reality, I feel like I'm wearing the same five outfits over and over again! I meticulously planned everything, considered my personal style, the climate... everything.I even invested in some better quality basics, thinking that would help.

But the problem is, my life just isn't that... basic. I go from casual coffee dates to slightly dressier work meetings, to evenings out were I want to feel a little more fun and expressive with my clothing. A capsule wardrobe just feels incredibly limiting. Like I'm stifling my personality to achieve some idealized minimalist aesthetic.

Has anyone else experienced this? What do you do when the capsule closet dream just doesn't mesh with your actual lifestyle? is it possible to modify the concept, or is it just fundamentally not for everyone? I'm starting to think I'd rather have a slightly chaotic, maximalist closet that actually reflects who I am, rather than a perfectly curated one that makes me feel blah. Maybe itS about adapting the principle rather than rigidly following the ""rules""?",1,1748919376.0,CapsuleClosetCrew,0,1.0,False

1l218cq,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1l218cq/officer_darnell_inetstca_part_3/,Officer Darnell (INETSTCA Part 3),"My head is still spinning from Victoria’s note. Did Mr. Walker really have something to do with Sarah’s disappearance that night?

This is part 3 of an ongoing story, so If you're not caught up with what I've been going through, please read, [""I Never Expected To See That Camera Again.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1kvzu1r/i_never_expected_to_see_that_camera_again/) and [""Blue Eyes (INETSTCA Part 2)""](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1kxayyh/blue_eyes_inetstca_part_2/)

It had to be a coincidence. Just because someone has blue eyes doesn’t necessarily mean anything. I can think of 3 other people in this town with blue eyes right now. Hell, even my dad had blue eyes, at least from what I could remember about him.

The more I read those journals, the more memories returned. My mind was like an old wooden chest and someone had just blown off the dust and cracked it open. Part of me felt like I had been drifting on auto-pilot for the last 17 years of my life.

School. Home. Friends.

Move out. More School. Less Friends.

Work. Home. Even Less Friends.

More Work. Less Home. No Friends.

I wasn’t the only one, of course. I think it’s pretty normal to find yourself in a routine. One look online and you’d see a lot of people I grew up with that were the same way. Everyone drifts apart eventually. As trivial as it might be to boil it all down to “just growing up”, it really is just that sometimes. Life becomes less magical as the years pass. Theme Parks turn into long lines. Road Trips turn into long drives. And nights turn into darkness.

Part of you might be wondering why I didn’t mention Sarah’s return sooner. To be completely honest, it’s because it never felt like she did actually return – at least not the Sarah I knew. She became cold and distant. I always just chalked it up to the fact that I had abandoned her that night. If I was in her position, I don’t know if I could have forgiven me either. The police called off their searches and considered this an open and shut case. A little girl snuck out of her parents’ house and stayed with some friends for the weekend. It was easier to let them believe their version of events. No one wanted to hear about mysterious houses and blue-eyed strangers from an eleven-year-old who shouldn't have been in those woods in the first place.

The day Sarah first appeared in Mr. Walker’s class again was the last day she talked to me. I can remember it vividly now. I leaned over in my chair and whispered to her, “Hey, where have you been? Are you okay?” I should have just started with something more along the lines of ‘I’m sorry for abandoning you in a mysterious house’, but I was too taken aback by her sudden apparition.

“Hey, I’m fine. Thanks for asking.” She replied soullessly. Goddamn it, I could tell she was pissed.

“You’re fine? Sarah, I haven’t seen you since that night at the-” I pleaded, but was interrupted by Mr. Walker’s booming voice entering the room.

“Okay class! Today we’ll be going over metamorphosis in caterpillars.” The class groaned. “And I know, I know. The word “metamorphosis” made about 70% of you immediately check out and start thinking about video games or cute boys and what not, but I promise it’s really interesting!”

Every detail came rushing back to me, right down to that fucking lesson in metamorphosis. Mr. Walker would never shut up about something called “imaginal cells”. Sarah never acknowledged me after that, aside from the odd “Hey” or “Oh, hi” when I would engage her first.

I began to remember how stupid I was back then, convincing myself of every possibility beyond taking personal responsibility. *She must be jealous of Victoria*, I used to think. *Or maybe it’s the movies we make. My ideas were always clearly better and she must have hated me for that.* What the hell was wrong with me?

After shaking off the previous entry, I continued to read through my journals into the early morning. The entries before the day Sarah disappeared weren’t very helpful. They essentially covered everything I had already come to remember from watching our recordings. I made it all the way up to that day she mysteriously came back. I could tell from my handwriting that I was overwhelmed and frantic – writing about how immature and unfair she was being. I turned the page and was met with the jagged edges of paper where my final entry had previously been.

Someone had ripped it out.

I could hear my mom coming down the stairs around 7 am. I didn’t want her to see that I had been up all night obsessively reading through my memories. I jammed the journals underneath the couch and pushed the side of my head against the pillow, pretending to be fast asleep. After a brief breakfast of french toast and coffee with her and Lily-Ann, I told them I wanted to take a look around town for nostalgia’s sake. I could tell my mother was disappointed by this, most likely hoping we’d spend the entire day together. I promised her that I would be back in time for us to get lunch at our favorite diner, Gem’s.

“12 o’clock and no later okay?” The way she said it sent me back 20 years. I felt like a little kid again.

“No problem, mom. I’ll be there.” I snatched my coat off of the hook behind the door, and made my way outside. I checked the time on my phone and it was 10 am. Plenty of time for me to investigate the old house and return in time for lunch.

It had been a while but, if I remembered correctly, the abandoned house was somewhere rather deep in the woods behind my mom’s home. I chose to walk about a block up the street before cutting across a small grass field. Immediately walking into the woods behind my old house probably would’ve raised some flags for my mom and Lily-Ann.

Sometimes I forget how much bigger the world seemed when I was 10 years old. The walk to that old house was much shorter than I anticipated. The treeline was rather thick, but without the fog of youth I could tell it was only a stone’s throw away from the road.

As I approached the brooding exterior of the house, something inside of me stirred. Literally. It felt as though the bones underneath my skin shifted an inch to the right clockwise, pulling my flesh along with it. I let out a small grunt before catching myself from being too loud. I still don’t know if anyone, or anything, was in that house. I looked down at my hands when the sensation ceased, expecting to see a mangled version of my limbs but I appeared totally fine.

I’ve had severe anxiety attacks before, especially when I was a lot younger, but nothing to this degree. I brushed it off the best I could with a deep breath and stepped toward the front door.

After at least 2 decades abandoned, I half expected this place to be in complete ruin. Yet, the exterior held up quite well over the years. The ivy grew strong, at least twice as tall as it was when I was a kid. The wood, while weathered, still held its integrity. It was better than my expectations… but it still looked like absolute shit.

That is, until I stepped inside.

The old hinges protested as the front door slowly opened before me. That was when I saw it.

The most beautiful home decor that I had ever seen in my life.

It was astounding. Polished marble flooring with pristine white walls that rose around me, untouched by time. Gold and black accents scattered across the rooms in the form of lamps, end tables, pottery and statues. Where previously there had been dust covered chairs draped in foreboding white sheets, there was now beautiful leather couches and love seats. They all faced the fireplace, adorned with carvings that seemed too intricate for human hands.

Even with the windows boarded up, the sunlight cascaded through cracks bouncing off of the impeccably clean floors, blooming light through the entire house.

The light found its way up the staircase. While the stairs and railings themselves were elegantly designed, the upstairs remained dark and decrepit, as though the house was mid-way through renovations. Tucked beneath the staircase, I noticed a door sitting slightly ajar. It had to be some sort of storage closet or basement entrance. Even in the dim light, I could make out a carving on the white door's surface—a gold cicada with its wings and legs spread in every direction.

The kitchen remained the darkest part of the house. I stepped closer and peered into its entrance. Even though it was the middle of the day and I was almost 30 years old, something about the thought of that ‘window’ made a knot of dread form in my stomach. I didn’t think I would be able to handle it if I saw those blue eyes staring back at me when I turned the corner.

But sure enough…

I braced myself as I entered the only half-renovated kitchen. I kept my gaze toward the fridge and counter top, building up the courage to face it. I turned, and two bright pools of blue stared back at me. I froze. Every nerve ending in my body twisted and screamed for me to run. My fists tightened out of instinct, ready to defend myself from whatever was looking directly through me. The figure stayed completely still. Too still.

After a few seconds had passed I felt the breath in my lungs return. I was about to run for the exit when I noticed the figure still hadn’t moved, nor did its gaze. It was looking at me the same way the Mona Lisa would, as if its always staring “toward” you but not quite “at” you. I built up the courage to step closer and as I did my eyes adjusted to the darkness.

It *was* a painting. But how was that possible? I know what I saw in that recording and I know what Sarah said that night. I reached forward and sure enough, my hand touched glass. It was like one of those paintings you’d see in a cheap motel or a museum, covered by a pane of glass so the guests couldn’t destroy it. *Was it just an optical illusion from the light reflecting off of it?* I thought to myself.

As I studied the room further, something struck me—the wall holding the painting was interior, with no outside access at all.

That was when the floorboards above me creaked. The upstairs remained a horrifying mystery in my mind. I felt compelled to go up.

As I walked upstairs, the smell that I had remembered all those years ago swept its way into my nose, but it was far worse now. The stench of molded wood began to burn my nostrils. Essence of rot and decay overtook my senses. I instinctively brought my hand to my face, covering as many openings as I could. The second floor was coated in a thick layer of dust and debris. A far cry from what it looked like downstairs. A creak from down the hall echoed toward me.

It was in this moment that I realized I hadn’t brought a weapon with me. I had walked straight into the lion’s den without a whip or a chair. I searched my pockets for anything that could be used as self defense. I felt the outline of my keys and fished them out. I remembered an old technique my mom taught me in case something ever happened to me after school. I quickly spread out the keys and placed each one between my fingers. Gripping the key chain, my hand now resembled that of Freddy Krueger or Wolverine.

With a new found confidence in my ability to fight back, I moved down the hall. A steady tapping sound began to emerge.

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

A door on the right side of the hallway stood ajar. A light shined through the crack, creating a vortex of glistening dust that swirled with each step I took. The tapping grew closer.

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I tightened my grip on the keys. Reaching my unequipped hand out, I pushed the door gently. More light bled into the hallway as suddenly, a shadow crept over me. Something blocking the window created a haunting silhouette against the glaring sunlight.

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

It swayed back and forth as my eyes adjusted to the brightness. Finally I could make out what was causing the tapping sound. Blood. Blood dripped onto the floor steadily beneath the rocking figure.

It was an orange tabby, torn open viciously from neck to groin. Its eyes frozen in shock with it’s limbs laying dormant. My body couldn’t decide if I was more saddened or disgusted. Immediately rejecting the sight, I lurched against the door frame, throwing up the contents of my stomach. French Toast. The sickeningly sweet nature of my vomit felt like an ironic kick while I was already down.

I composed myself and looked back up at the disgusting omen. That was when I saw it. Something was protruding out of it’s mouth. Another memory card – the same sized memory card that fit inside of my old camera.

It was meant for me. I just knew it.

The floorboards creaked loudly as I stepped toward it. I felt the cat’s jaw slightly unhinge as I pulled the memory card from it’s mouth. The sight and awful squelching sound of it made me retch.

“What kind of sick fuck would do this?” I whispered to myself.

A voice replied from the doorway.

“Exactly what I was wondering…” a stern deep voice boomed.

I looked to my left and was greeted with the barrel of a 9mm pistol pointed directly at me. A golden badge shined against the incoming streaks of light. A burly black man stood glaring at me through a pair of dark Oakley knock-offs. His dark blue uniform fitted tightly against his rotund body, creating stress marks on the shoulders and above his belt.

“Put your hands on your head immediately and get on the ground!” The tension in his voice grew.

I shoved the memory card into my pocket and did as he told. I didn’t know what to say but all I could blurt out was, “I didn’t do this. I promise.”

There was a moment of silence before it was broken by the cop’s voice again. “Kasey? Is that you?”

I didn’t know for a second if I should have been more scared or relieved.

I heard the sound of a click and braced myself for the impact of a bullet. I had just hoped it was in the head so it would be immediate. Instead, nothing happened. I looked over and saw the sound had come from the officer’s holster. He had placed the gun back on his belt.

“Holy shit, Kasey, it’s me! Darnell!” His voice was now a pitch higher and more excitable.

It took a moment to recall, but that was when it hit me. Darnell was one of my classmates from E. Bird Elementary. In fact, he sat right in front of me in Mr. Walker’s classroom and was one of the only other people who gave me the time of day. We used to commiserate about how cruel everyone else could be in school.

“Darnell? Oh my god, I haven’t seen you in almost…”

“17 years!” He interrupted, walking towards me with arms open. I embraced him and he continued, “Oh man, I can’t believe you’re actually back. This is amazing.”

We giggled awkwardly as the hug ended, unsure of what to say as both of our gazes returned to the unfortunate feline.

“What the fuck happened here, Kasey? I got reports of a random person going through backyards and followed your trail here…” He shot me an accusing and concerned eye, “Please tell me you didn’t do this.”

“No! I swear, I just showed up about 30 minutes ago and the cat was already like this.” I sounded frantic, but I knew it was the truth. Mentioning the time made me remember the promise I had made to my mom. I pulled out my phone to check the time. 11:55 am. *Fuck. The Diner.*

Darnell stared at me for a moment. His thick black glasses made it near impossible to read his emotions. He let out a brief sigh before reaching for his radio’s microphone and cupping it in his hands, “Unit 23 to dispatch, I investigated the complaint at the old Whitaker house. It was just some kids messing around. I sent them home with a warning. No further action required.”

The mention of the name Whitaker stopped me… that was *my* last name.

A calm woman’s voice came through the receiver, “10-4, Unit 23. You’re clear and available.”

Darnell looked back up at me with a smile of relief, “The kids around here have been really escalating their stupid pranks lately. I honestly didn’t think they’d go this far.” He gestured toward the tabby. “I’m sorry you had to see this. Especially at your dad’s old place.”

I was still in shock, “My.. dad?”

“Yeah, you know. The place your dad grew up with all the other kids?” He said every word as if he was waiting for me to jump in, but I had no idea what he was talking about. I think he saw the look on my face, his facade shifted.

“Sorry Kasey, maybe your family never told you. That’s not my business. Forget I said anything.. Do you need a ride back home to your mom’s? I’ll have someone come out and clean this up later.”

I hated the idea of ending the conversation here, but two things stopped me. One, I need to get to the diner as quickly as possible before I felt the wrath of my mother. And two, he had a gun.

“The Gem Diner… please.” I muttered.

We both hopped into his cruiser and within moments had pulled up to the diner. I finally got to experience the perks of using police sirens in traffic.

I stepped out of the vehicle in front of Gem’s, expressing my thanks to Darnell as he shouted from the driver’s seat, “Just stay out of trouble Kasey, you hear?”

I looked back at him to wave goodbye as he lowered his sunglasses.

His eyes met mine.

His beautiful, lightning blue eyes, met mine. I froze.

He lifted his glasses with a smile and drove away.",1,1748919300.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

* What **food** options are included when ordering via OceanNow? Can we order from the main dining room, casual eateries, or specialty restaurants without extra charges?
* Are there any **additional service charges or gratuities** that apply to food or drink orders even with the Premier Package?
* With the Premier Package, can we get **alcoholic drinks, specialty coffees, bottled water, etc.** through OceanNow without paying extra?
* Are there any **exceptions or common surprise charges** we should look out for?

1l215f6,https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepApnea/comments/1l215f6/remedies_for_while_i_wait_for_final_diagnosis/,Remedies for while I wait for final diagnosis,"My doctor told me recently he very much believes I have sleep apnea since I have such a classic case of waking up at night, brain fog, tiredness, snoring and obesity. I called to set up for a sleep study, but the earliest date I could find is for next year. Now, my insurance won’t pay for any machine or treatment without a study first, and I really need to get this treatment going, as tiredness and brain fog are becoming ever increasing and harder to deal with. I can’t use the mouth tape since sometimes my nose clogs up because of allergies or sinusitis, so is there anything I could use in the meantime to at least alleviate the symptoms?

My full story here:

I was mildly overweight (15-20 lbs) when I had an injury while exercising to shed those pounds. This along with long work hours led to me putting on a ton of weight over the years (like 50 lbs more). I believe back then I started to have apnea since my anxiety started becoming ever more present and my energy to do things I loved took a nosedive, to the point I couldn’t even watch a series. During this time I curbed the tiredness with coffee. In comes 2023 and my body started reacting strongly to coffee and causing me anxiety. My GP recommended to leave coffee behind. This exacerbated my sleep problem. I couldn’t get past the tiredness in the morning and I’m basically a zombie in the afternoon when I get home from work. I tried losing weight, but it was so difficult mustering energy when I had none and after going to a nutrionist and following every recommendation to a t I only dropped five pounds then stopped altogether. When my pulmonologist told me it could be apnea a lot of things clicked. I thought my tiredness and lack of energy to even visit family was due to age, but he told me I’m too young for that. I was happy since a solution seemed close. But now the solution is so far away and I really want to turn my life around, be healthier, have energy and do things I love.",3,1748919041.0,SleepApnea,0,1.0,False

I’m relatively new to at home espresso. Been a daily brew from home drinker for many years using various methods. I bought these three machines within 3 months of each other last year, the grinder and kettle first than the espresso machine. I only use recently roasted beans for espresso and always weigh my portions. 

At first everything worked amazingly, exactly as specifications listed said they would. What I mean by that is the grinder settings 0-2 worked great for espresso and produced the correct grind. For the bambino everything seems in order. I always use filtered water or bottled water. I have not used the descaler package that came with the box but have considered it as a potential solution to try. 

The problem: recently I have not been able to pull a good shot out of the bambino. 

I have tried cleaning the grinder, different grind settings, it seems like anything below 4 won’t even push water through the puck anymore. 

I’m starting to wonder if I need to just ignore entirely the grind settings and pay attention to what’s actually coming out of the machine but then how will I ever keep consistency? 

I was very happy with the results when I first started using these two machines together but now idk what is off, the grind, the bambino pressure, I am not sure. I think the grind settings that I used to use now pulverize the beans into more like flour than grinds. Thinking that’s part of the issue. Do I need to brush out the grinder with an actual paint brush? 

Any advice or help is appreciated, I might just need to buy a new bag of coffee and play for awhile but im tired of wasting 20 gms to find out I did it wrong again. ",1,1748918932.0,espresso,1,1.0,False
1l213jp,https://v.redd.it/kwa1w1lqlm4f1,How to reduce the bitterness,"
How is my brew? I used Arabica 100% medium-dark roast. 16 g of the coffee with this Bialetti 3 cup express. Using Comandante c40 at 20 clicks. Fill until the funnel is full to the rim with some stir and tapping but no tamp. 95c pre-heat water in the boiler. Use medium heat (2 from 3 level), no stove preheating. And also use filter.

The coffee aroma and taste is ok but I feel the bitterness still lingering on my tongue after each sip. 

How to tune more to solve this bitterness?

Thinking about using 19 click and try to control the heat to the pot. Still want to use the same coffee to know how much I can tune the taste.",3,1748918888.0,mokapot,1,1.0,False

Our budget for buying a house is $1.3m. I would love somewhere with greenery that's not too far from the city. And also has good coffee nearby! But I'm afraid we're being budgeted out to the outer suburbs.

Looking at Chapel Hill, anyone have any tips on that area, or other similar recommendations?

I use medium / medium-light beans and value clarity, sweetness and acidity over texture and body.  I’m looking at the Breville Bambino for the brewer because of its size, value and the fact that I’m currently not interested in modding my equipment.  I’m willing to use a manual grinder if it gives me SIGNIFICANTLY better tasting espresso for the same price as an electric grinder, but otherwise prefer electric.  Although I am considering the DF54, I could be talked into the DF64 or any other grinder.  As far how much I am willing to spend, I have a $400 budget, but it’s more about reaching a point of maximum value where spending more would start to have diminishing returns.  I don’t care about bells and whistles.  I care about the final product.  Thanks in advance for your thoughts",1,1748918803.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Zodiac Sign: Libra—because she’s all about balance (between city life and nature, students and locals, tradition and progress).
Vibe: That quirky, artsy aunt who went to grad school, grows her own herbs, hosts porch concerts, and has very strong opinions about local politics and bike lanes.
Occupation: Works in higher ed, obviously. She’s the cool administrator at a Big 10 university who wears Birkenstocks in the office and somehow makes it work.

⸻

🏙️ Appearance & Style

She rocks a wardrobe that’s one part farmer’s market, one part bookstore chic. Lots of denim jackets, vintage Mizzou hoodies, and graphic tees from Flat Branch or Logboat.

1 smoothie shortly after with 
greek yogurt
coconut milk
two tablespoons of hemp and flax
1 tablespoon of oats
Assorted berries
Sometimes peanut butter and banana 

I only drink water throughout the day and have another smoothie when i get off work. 8:30-9:30

I intend to add two salads by week two, adding nuts, assorted vegetables, evoo or avocado oil, red wine or balsamic vinegar. Keep smoothie in morning, salad lunch, smoothie mid day, salad dinner. 

Im not sure what would be a healthy progression going into the following weeks and am curious if you guys have any thoughts/advice about moving this diet forward. I intend to do a 6-8 week diet. I am aware i am low on my protein right now, but i wanted to treat it like a cleanse for week 1. I was a heavy drinker and a chef that is looking to be more mindful of what he ingests on the day to day and gain some ground level discipline. I would also like to apply a slight workout/routine once i get some protein in the mix so any and all advice best for losing a few pounds and finding some balance would be much appreciated.

See on the map a level 30 and 31, travel to them and they're sneaking around with trash weapons and having trouble with regular enemies, obviously new.  Give them a few serums, meds, coffee, candy, water.

Found one guy using a bow, crafted him a bunch of bows with various arrow types to get him to level 50, I had a few pre-made sitting in my stash.

Found another person around level 70, gave them 1 of each of my plans, any regular fasnacht mask they didn't have.

Now, I'm about to log off but decide to once again visit the pair I saw originally.  I decide to give them each every regular fasnacht mask and some other stuff like meds and water.  This time, they know what's up.  They know if I show up waving, I'm going to drop a bag and then run away thumbs upping and waving.  So, I start dropping.  Meds and stuff, then masks masks masks...

One of very few glowing masks I have, gone.  I message him, xbox, that I didn't mean to drop the glowing mask.  No reply.  I continue dropping the other masks either way, unhappy AF.  Will I get it back?  Fuck if I know.  I do, man drops everything I just gave him.  Whether he just didn't know that it's a struggle to get those masks or he was appreciative of what I'd done so far, I got back my mask.

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the US (EST time zone, and with a rather sporadic schedule). My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, life is far more intricate than this. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are emphatically established and developed over time for a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**Also, no hesitations or doubts, please.** If you're at all interested then take the chance. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** My ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. I seek people who generally know themselves and what they desire and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost. The type of connection I want also understands, accepts, and embraces the reality that there's more than deliberate engagement and a handful of interests that make someone up, from mundane chatter to intense distress - it strives to embrace these more grueling aspects of existence in a considerate way, while not being totally lost to them.
* **Being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** I want people with a vibrant imagination that are high in cognitive sensations in which such interaction, of various sorts, creates an elated state of splendor. I peak with ideation and abstraction, and seek out others who do as well.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics, which is inscribed onto one of the plaques I've placed above my abode in the Epistemic Wilderness. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and have actively sought out the most peculiar and obscure bits of knowledge possible since I was young. I seek peers in this and related endeavors.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, in which I primarily write about my observations and thoughts. I also adore writing conversationally, and am not uncommonly poetic and intense when doing so. Photography is also something I dabble in, although not as much as I'd like. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, and coffee.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with. A person who understands that no one will ever be your clone and dares to take exuberant advantage of that fact seems required for the deepest sorts of bonds.**  I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably detailed chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention; anything dazzling will also do. I look forward to us chatting and connecting around meaningful and fervid passions.",1,1748918335.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

I stretched my back, my quills shaking as I let out a yawn.  While we’d become more used to Human days, trying to keep up with the primates stamina was exhausting.  *Almost done for the day*, I thought, turning back to the table before me. Myself and a few others were in the town built for training, practicing bomb making for our field exercise.  The building we were sheltered in had been made to resemble a warehouse, and we were in a partitioned area towards the center.

 I picked up a metal pipe, a cap  and a soldering pen, and carefully secured the cap to the end of the pipe.  Setting down the pen, I reached over to the graduated cylinder across from me, and began to pour the white powder inside into the pipe.

“Careful there,” [~~Yotul-1~~] Rels said from across the room.  “It’s very impact sensitive; please don’t set it off.  It took a lot of work.”  I paused, and set down the container.  “Rels, what do you mean very impact sensitive?” I asked, my growing exhaustion putting a sharp tone to my voice.
“I mean if you drop it, then poof,” Rels said, pantomiming an explosion with his paws.  He cocked his head, examining me.  “What did you think I meant?”

I heard a resigned sign behind me, and turned to see [~~Krakotl-1~~] Jarla rubbing her beak at her station.  “Rels,” she asked, seemingly annoyed.  “You do realize this is supposed to be non-lethal flash powder, right?  As in, not supposed to kill anyone, right?”
“Oh course I know that,” Rels huffed back.  “It’s still non-lethal; I don’t plan on killing any of you.”  He paused.  “Unless a certain someone keeps stealing my mangos.”  He fixed Jarla with an accusing stare for a moment.

He hopped down and wandered over, leaning over my bench.  “One of the issues I noticed with the last batch was that there was a slight delay in detonation,” he said, picking up a detonator we’d assembled earlier.  “Standard flash powder doesn’t exactly react like real explosives; you set of the detonator and there is enough of a delay as it ignites to let your opponent get to cover.”

I rubbed my eyes, bracing for another lecture.  *He’s taken the title of Chaos Marsupial far too literally*.  “It’s just a second, and it’s supposed to make a bunch of smoke,” I said.  “Not explode.  Again, non-lethal.”

Rels gave us a Human smile, his tail up and waving back and forth excitedly.  “Once again, of course,” he said.  “But real bombs explode instantly; they don’t slowly pumping out a higher and higher volume of smoke.  So, to make it a bit more realistic, I modified the recipe a bit.”

“How late did you stay up last night?” Jarla asked, setting down the detonater she was assembling.  “Did you get any sleep?  And how much coffee did you drink.”

I turned back to the Yotul, who seemed to be considering his words carefully.  “I stayed up late enough to get it done,” he said.  “I got enough sleep, and only a reasonable amount of coffee.”  *So all night, none at all, and the DI’s are gonna be pissed someone raided their stash again*, I thought.

“Anyway,” Rels said, continuing before either Jarla or I could respond.  “I tweaked the chemical makeup enough to make it much more reactive; basically, if you hit it hard enough.”  He pointed at Jarla’s table, and the small stack of detonators on the side.  “Or explode a detonator in a pile of it, it will ignite much faster.  Think of a bundle of dry grass versus a bundle of dry twigs.”

I was about to start explaining to him that he shouldn’t start playing with the chemical makeup of our mock explosives, when my pad gave a low, grating tone.  I froze, my quills flaring, as did Jarla and Rels.  *Perimeter alarm,* I thought.  *Raid.*

Jarla reacted first; dropping what she had, she gave a few strong flaps of her wings and propelled herself across the room, dropping next to the gun rack and ripping it open.  I reached out and first caught the rifle she sent me, then the magazine, quickly loading it and chambering a round.  I caught the next two magazines, stuffing them behind the belt I wore around my waist.

“Rels,” I said, seeing him setting the weapon Jarla tossed him on a table.  “You’ve got thirty seconds to set those charges.”  Out front and at our rear, our lookouts began to open fire, and was answered by a hail of gunfire on either side.  *We don’t have much time*, I thought.

Rels reached down under his table, pulling up a wire with some kind of cylindrical device attached to it.  Quickly, he gripped the cylinder and snapped it; it folded but did not break.  Dropping it, he grabbed a harness, threw it over his head, then picked up his weapon and said “Already done.  We should get moving.  We have a few minutes.”

“You already had this place rigged?” I asked, moving to the door of our partition, wondering at the harness he now wore.  He wagged an ear -*yes*-.  *Shouldn’t be surprised*, I thought.  

“Whose team do you think it is?” Jarla asked, stacking up on the door.  I moved to the other side of the door and we breached; her sweeping left while I went right, Rels coming up the middle.  “Could be Sanin; or Fayla,” Rels remarked, crouching next to a box.

“The easy way is to suppress the attackers out front,” I said, “While the rest exit the back.  If it’s either of those two, they’ll have planned for that.”  I turned my head towards the front, a door surrounded by boxes, with the small office our lookouts had been sheltering in beyond it.  Compared to the gunfire from our rear, there were only a few answering shots.  “I say we rush the front; close react to ambush.  Hit them hard, push through, and scatter.”

“On your six,” Rels said, repositioning himself towards the door.  I nodded, and waved the three of us forward, weapon raised.  It didn’t take long to reach the door; this time Rels and I took a position on either side of the door, with Jarla ready to assault.  I flicked my ear once, twice, three times, and Rels kicked the door, quickly going right.

A round hit above me as I went left; seeing no immediate targets I dropped behind the concrete wall of the office, immediately returning fire.  Behind me, Jarla had taken flight, getting to the rafters and moving for an elevated shot.  “How many?” I asked the “surviving” lookout; the other was stretched out on the floor, a sim round having hit their upper chest.

“Only a couple,” [~~Venlil-1~~] Nalim, a brown furred Venlil, replied.  He spared a glance over, and fired towards a tree, where I saw a shape taking cover.  I fired at it, and it ducked back quickly.  

Glancing over my shoulder, I keyed the radio attached the the slim collar around my neck.  “Anyone at the rear, move up to us now!  Jarla, suppressing fire.  Rels, Nalim, on my mark, start bounding forward.”  Behind me, across the warehouse, I heard a dull bang; someone had just opened a boobytrapped door.  *Distract us from the front, attack from the rear*.

I spied a rusted vehicle, the front tires long gone, resting in a parking lot before us.  Just ahead, only several yards, was the tree line.  Behind me, the two rear lookouts arrived, slamming the door closed behind them and taking cover.  “There must be a half dozen back there at least,” a Gojid who I thought was [~~Gojid-2~~] Shen, reported, firing towards the tree line.  *Most of the team then,* I thought.  Now or never.  “Jarla, suppressing!  Rels, Nalim, everyone else, let’s go!”

**Memory Transcription subject: [~~Venlil-2~~] Fayla

I watched as [~~Farsul-1~~] Sarq, one of the few Farsul in the class, and [~~Krakotl-2~~] Zelkim started falling back as Macan and his team assaulted forward.  Now on the roof, I could see the blue feathers of Jarla as she lay down suppressing fire.  Perfect, I thought.  I keyed my radio, and said, “[~~Takkan-1~~] Sarn, [~~Yotul-2~~] Kamso, and [~~Venlil-3~~] Vanek, secure the target.  Everyone else, go loud.”  

Our part of this field exercise had been to raid an enemy held building; either go in and eliminate them, or flush them out, and secure their intel.  To flush them out, I’d had three of my team rig up some extra guns to fire automatically; making it seem like we had most of our troops at the rear.  Kamso, one of our crazy neighborhood Yotul, was probably the second best at explosives; behind Rels of course, would enter with them once our opponents were driven away and disarm the explosives inside.  

To deal with the rest, our sparse “rearguard” would fall back, letting Macan’s team pursue them… right into a crossfire from the rest of us.  I spared a glance to my left, where [~~Arxur-1~~] Zirz lay, his machine gun ready.  Across from us, in a position that wouldn’t see us shoot each other, was [~~Mazic-1~~] Tupo, our Mazic heavy weapons operative, and [~~Arxur-2~~] Djir, another Arxur.

I gave myself a heartbeat to think about how crazy it was that I was leading an attack against fellow prey with Arxur on my side.  *By the Tenants, the galaxy truly has gone mad.*. Where once I’d have been terrified by the toothed visage to my left, and his smooth, warm scales, gentle claws that dug through my wool just right… *Stop; don’t get distracted*, I reminded myself.

The two “fleeing” recruits passed the kill zone, and we immediately opened fire.  I saw Macan duck behind the rusted remnant of a car; great protection, had he not been flanked.  I fired, and saw him jump as a pair of rounds hit his back.  Beside him, Nalim turned and raised his weapon before Zirz’s machine gun began to chatter, and the Venlil dropped.

Jarla, who had swooped down to the ground by now, was caught by Djir as she tried to get to cover.  Another Gojid got hit, only having made it a few yards past the structure.  *Probably still winded from running from the rest*, I thought.

The last two, another Venlil and Rels, had dove into a culvert alongside the parking lot.  “Djir and Tupo; shift fire, keep them pinned,” I ordered, tapping Zirz beside me to cease fire.  “Sarq, Zelkim, flank around their rear; make sure they don’t crawl to the other end of the culvert.”  I turned to Zirz.  “Come on, Croc,” I said, getting up from my position.  “Let’s move.”  

“After you sheep,” he replied, giving me a toothy grin and a gentle tap with his tail.  Instead of terrifying me like it should, it somehow gave me butterflies.  *I know Ma and Pa had worried I was diseased*, I thought as I moved, low to avoid presenting a target.  *I know they kept the exterminators from getting to me.  And I’m glad they did.*

Most of my life I’d been the “black sheep,” to borrow the Human term; always standing up to bully’s, always going first, always pushing my limits.  While that would have been considered a good thing on Earth, it had been decidedly un-herd like behavior.  It had been what made my parents eventually pull me from school and finish the last few years themselves; it’s what led me to the Venlil Space Corps, and what eventually led me to the Legion.

I came to a halt, on the opposite side of the car where Macan had “died.”  I peered around it, and saw him laying on his side, paw tapping away at his pad.  “Corpses don’t play games in their pads,” I teased.  “Must be a zombie,” Zirz added.

“Shoo,” Macan replied, not looking up.  “Get a move in.  If someone sees you talking to a dead body, they’ll think you’re diseased.”  I shared a chuckle with the two of them, then nudged Zirz.  “Come on, let’s finish this.”

*Shit shit shit shit,* I repeated in my head, hugging the cold mud of the ditch, water over my paws, and peering down the culvert.  I was rewarded with a spray of sim rounds, and I ducked back just in time.  *So much for Plan B,* I thought.  

[~~Venlil-4~~] Marek, the only other surviving member of my team, lay a few feet into the culvert, now humming to himself as he picked dirt from his rifle.  We’d hoped to take cover in the culvert before advancing; the trap laid by what I suspected was Fayla having ruined Macan’s plan.  *Shame; it would have definitely worked against the feds.*

Plan B had us crawling through the culvert and making a break for the woods; based on the glimpses of an Arxur snout, they’d thought of that too.  I weighed my options.  *Can’t go through the culvert; might make it back to the warehouse before it blows, sneak around the ones probably inside now*.

I cursed myself for not grabbing a few grenades on my way out; that would have at least let me distract them.  No sense crying over spilt milk.  I shuddered.  *Gods the Humans are so gross.  Damn their useful idioms*.

Suddenly, the gunfire slowed and stopped.  I turned my ears, trying to hear where the inevitable attack would come from, but heard only silence.  Then my suspicions on our opponents identity was confirmed when I hear a familiar bleat.  “Hey, Rels,” Fayla called out.  “Looks like your the last one left.  Care to surrender?”

I laughed.  “Why would I do that?” I shouted back.  “When I can just wait a little bit and try to run when the warehouse goes up?”

“Because it’s not going anywhere,” the voice of my nemesis, my greatest rival and good drinking buddy Kamso announced, seemingly from the doorway of the warehouse.  *Speh.*. “Nice work with the riggings; too bad I’ve worked with you enough to know how to disarm your sets.  And the backup.”

“Congrats; I’ve taught you well,” I said, dropping the pitch of my voice mockingly.  “The circle is now complete.”  If he’s got my backup, this mission is toast.  I straightened the harness I’d grabbed on my way out.  *Guess it’s time for Plan D.*

“Fine, fine you win,” I shouted, pulling my magazine from my weapon, then tossing the two out of the ditch in opposite directions.  Then, I checked to make sure that the harness lay properly over my neck and shoulders.  “I’m starting to get cold anyway.  I’m coming out.”  I started climbing, pulling a nearly invisible wire from the harness as I did.

As I reached the top, I smiled inwardly, forcing my tail and ears to reflect sadness or anxiety instead of the excitement they wanted to show.  *Sloppy*, I thought.  Ahead, Fayla was standing in the opposite side of Macan’s failed cover, while Zirz, Djir, and Zelkim approached, weapons raised.  *Overconfident, are we?*

I raised my paws halfway, being careful with the wire as I did.  “I surrender,” I said.  “Mind getting me a towel?  I’d like to dry off myself and my new fashion accessory.”  There was no point hiding the harness; they saw it.  With luck, they’d assume it was for carrying ammo.

“Sure, once we have you secured,” Zelkim squawked.  “Now keep your paws where we can see them, and get on the ground.”

I groaned aloud.  “I’m done with hugging the dirt tonight,” I said, motioning to my mud covered fur.  I took another step forward, then another.  This time Zirz spoke, raising his rifle level with my head.  “Stop where you are,” he hissed.  “Paws behind your head, and get down.”

I took a brief moment to observe my surroundings; Zelkim, Zirz and Djir were about five yards from me; Fayla was another five and behind cover; Kamso and what looked like Vanek were approaching for the building.  *Five, maybe six if I get lucky*, I thought.  *Good enough.*

“Roger that,” I said, letting my excitement show.  I raised my paws behind my head, and saw a flash of realization in Zirz’s eyes as he saw the tiny wire in my paw.  He fired, but was already too late.

The wires pulled taut, and there was a soft click.  Then the harness exploded in an orange cloud, obscuring my vision for a moment as it blinded me.  I felt the impact of over a dozen sim rounds and it dropped, giggling despite the pain.  As the dust cleared, I saw the three closest to me covered in the orange dust; a mirror of what I looked like myself.  A bit further away, Vanek and Kamso had managed to get a little spray on them, and they looked around confused.

“The hell was that!?” Zirz exclaimed, brushing off some of the dust from his chest.  “Chalk?”  He looked at his hand, then back to me.  “This is going to stain, isn’t it?”

Suddenly, there was a loud bang from within the warehouse, and I heard a Takkan cry out in surprise.  From within the warehouse, thick white clouds of smoke began rolling towards us, and rising into the sky.  Seeing this, I pumped my paws in the air in success, still laughing.

“The hell was that Rels?” Fayla asked, popping her head from behind the car.

“That,” I said, chuckling.  “Was me winning.”

“I swear to God, you fucking Chaos Marsupial,” [~~Human-1~~] Sgt Summer said, shaking his head as the now orange Yotul beamed.  “That’s King Chaos Marsupial, Drill Instructor,” Rels said, tail wagging a mile a minute.  

I shook my head, and went back to digging some dirt from my action.  The ground had been muddier than I’d though when I dropped after being “killed,” and I’d been rewarded with a glob of mud in my action.

“I’ll let that one pass, but just this once,” Sgt Summer said.  “Don’t let it go to your head.  We’ll get to the AAR, but first, can you tell me just what the hell have you been up to?  Explain to me why you made not only a deadman switch, but a suicide vest?

“A what!?” I squawked in shock, the name registering.  Rels looked at me, and twitched an ear in confirmation.  “You were running around with us with a bomb strapped to you!?”

“Only for the attempt at getting out of the warehouse,” the Yotul said, still proud of himself.  “It was something I was toying with, kind of a last ditch thing.  Obviously, it worked!”

As Rels started rattling off some of the history and tactics of suicide bombing, while I looked down at my rifle, my thoughts a torrent.  I had ceased to be shocked at the various ways humans had sought to kill one another; but to hear one of the prey species not only willing to use the tactic, but to seemingly support it in any way was insane!

“You okay?” Macan asked, settling beside me.  “You look a bit… disturbed.”

I looked at him incredulously.  “And you’re not?” I asked.  “I know it is a tactic, but actually killing yourself in order to harm your enemies seems… wrong.”  I quickly tried to run through scenarios in my head where I’d be able to justify it.  *Sure, sacrificing yourself to protect others, or kill those who would harm others, was just duty.  But using yourself, or someone else as the weapon yourself…*

“Is it any different than what we’re doing anyway?” Macan asked.  “I mean, we’re learning how to be guerillas; to be terrorists.  We all know we could die a thousand different ways; shot, stabbed, burned alive.  At the end of the day we’d still be dead.  So what if we take a few with us?”

“There’s a difference in dying for a cause and killing yourself for it,” I replied.  “Killing yourself seems wasteful.  And just imagine how much inner turmoil someone should have to have to be willing to kill themselves; not die fighting, but to kill themselves to kill their enemy.  You either hate your enemy more than your own life, or you hate your life more than the enemy.”

“I think you’re thinking too much into it,” Macan said, wiping some dirt off his barrel.  “It’s a tactic, a valid tactic, but it’s just another tool in the toolbox.  And if it’s something that helps you win, then who cares?  At the end of the day, as long as you accomplish the objective.”  He laughed.  “That rascally bastard sure did.”

I looked back at him, thinking.  “We may be learning to be terrorists, and we do have a lot of tools in our toolbox, but there have to be some lines we don’t cross,” I said.  “I want to see victory over the Federation; to see the galaxy free, but I don’t want to lose myself in the process.”

I set my rifle on my lap, memories of the chaotic days after the interview had aired. “After the interview, I could have hated myself,” I said.  “I could have called myself a predator, a monster.  I could have locked myself away to protect others; or even hurt myself like so many others did.”

I turned to Macan.  “But I never felt any different,” I said.  “I didn’t feel like I wanted to eat flesh or hunt my neighbors.  I wasn’t consumed by bloodlust or a desire to rage and kill.  I was still just… me.  Just Jarla.  I still liked the Exterminator show.  I still enjoyed tasting fruits from new worlds, and that imported berry wine from the Cradle.”  

“I had friends abandon me, and I lost my job because I’m a Krakotl; everything changed.  But I don’t plan to change because of it,” I said firmly.  “My religion may be fake, or it may not.  My species history may be fake, or it may not.  But I’m not fake, and I’m not going to be.  I want to change the galaxy as myself; but I don’t want the galaxy to change me.”

“Easier said than done,” Macan said bitterly, running his paw over his weapon.  “When that damned interview aired, my friends turned on me.  I’d always been there for them, and just hearing that my species may have been omnivores in the past was enough for them to completely change their opinion of me.”

He shook his head.   “My best friend was an exterminator,” he said.  “We were together when we found out.  And he tried to burn me.  To cleanse the taint, he said.”  Macan balled his paws into fists, and his spines flared in anger.  “I lost my friends, I was fired from my job, and had to run from my world.”

He looked back at me, with a cold rage in his eyes.  “I don’t want anyone to ever go through what I did again,” he said.  “And I’m going to make damn sure the people responsible never have the chance to do what they did to me again.”  He looked out at the slowly setting sun.  “And I don’t care how I do that.”

It was dark before the AAR was finished and we were released to return to our barracks.  We had a few hours to rest before the next excercise; street to street fighting, with the objective of seizing a checkpoint.  *I’m already tired just thinking about it.*

I looked over Zirz beside me, his entire front half covered in orange dust.  He’d done his best to get it off; even dunking himself in a colder than anticipated stream, to no avail.  *You big dumb lizard,* I thought affectionately.

“You’re quiet,” I said, breaking the silence.  “What’s on your mind?”

“I’m thinking that the scale cleaner back in the barracks better work,” he said.  “Or next I’ll be thinking of the best way to roast a Yotul.”  He glanced over.  “You think Djir has any recipes?”

“Monster,” I joked, bumping him, careful to not get any of the orange dust on myself.  “You’d waste good meat like that on a Djir recipe?  Everyone knows [~~Arxur-3~~] Heliss is the better cook.”

We both laughed as we walked down the path, completely at ease with one another.  I noticed Zirz’s tail, wagging in happiness.  *I wonder*.

“Zirz,” I asked.  “That dust does look like it’ll be a pain in the tail to clean off.”  He nodded in agreement.  “Probably,” he said.  “I’ll be lucky to get it off after a night of scrubbing.”

“You know,” I said slyly, “It’s going to be tough to get all of that out of your scales yourself.  Especially all the nooks and crannies.”  He looked down at me, the speed of his tail wagging increasing, and he gave me a Human smile.  I could see a slight darkening to his snout; one which I’m sure was matched on mine.

“I think you’re right,” he said.  “Alas, I am born with but two hands.  Woah is me.”  He feigned a dramatic sigh.  “If only I had someone to help clean between my scales, but who would help such a monster as me?”

“Acting isn’t your strong suite,” I replied dryly.  “Don’t quit your day job.”  *He’s gonna make me ask to help him, isn’t he?*. A smug look on his face, and knowing look, confirmed my suspicions.

I huffed.  *Fine.  Guess I’ll do the heavy lifting.*. I leaned in close, and wrapped my tail around his.  “Would you want me to help you get cleaned up?” I asked.  “Two sets of paws is better than one, after all.  We need you ready for later, after all; you’ll be a fat target painted orange.”

“I’d love to have your help Fayla,” he replied, and I felt my heart soar in spite of myself.  “I was just planning on just staying behind you later, use you as a fluffy shield, but your idea is better.”  *And there goes the moment.*

I copied a human eye roll, and whacked him on the back of the head with my tail before returning it to curl around his.  “Smartass,” I muttered, and he chuckled in return.  “Well then, my scaly friend,” I said . “Let’s get to it, shall we?  I hope you’ve still got that brush I got you.”

Together, tails entwined, we headed for the barracks.  *It’s not a date*, I told myself.  *Just going to help him clean up.*. I bloomed, feeling my ears heat up.  *Though, maybe the next time it could be.*

We’ve had some really solid conversations in person. She smiles when she sees me, comes over to talk, we dap each other up, and there’s been good eye contact and energy. We grabbed coffee once after I asked, and it went well. After that, I casually asked if she wanted to watch a movie sometime and she said yeah.

A few days later I messaged her suggesting a couple movies, and she replied saying she wasn’t really interested in any of the ones out right now, and that she was feeling pretty tired and not up for much socialising. She added, “maybe if I see anything I’ll let you know.” I sent back a light reply and she left it on read.

What’s throwing me off is that her energy over text feels very different from how she is in person. At the gym, there’s no distance. She comes up to me, seems happy to talk, and it never feels awkward or forced. It actually feels good. But the message felt kind of like a brush-off.

Just trying to figure out if this is her way of gently passing, or if she’s just genuinely tired and not in the mood to make plans right now. Not looking to overthink it, I just want to handle it right. Should I keep it casual and see how she acts next time we talk at the gym, or step back completely?

She tried to reach out multiple times but I ignored her, and since then I’ve been working on bettering myself, I lost 90 lbs, worked really hard at work, but I was still thinking about her every day.

In the beginning of May I was going out on a date to see a girl, but the girl canceled the date last minute, and then I realized I’m just a few minutes away from where my ex used to work at a coffee shop, so I don’t know what I was thinking and I went there.

She saw me when I walked in, and a few minutes later came to my table, and asked me what I’m doing here? And I answered I’m here for just a cup of coffee.

We talked for a few minutes and she didn’t let me leave, and she complemented how great I looked since I’ve been working out, and wanted to have lunch with me when her shift is over.

We had lunch and we talked and she told me about everything and how she regrets leaving me for someone else, and she was praying every day that I come back and when she saw me it’s like god answered her prayers.

Then stupid me I believed all these lies, and tried to give her a second chance, since I was moving to a new city in June, I was like what can go wrong?

During this month I realized she has another man in her life, and she had sex with him a week before my birthday, and on my birthday she canceled all the plans, and now I know why!

I feel I broke my heart again by the same mistake and the same person, but it’s hitting harder now while in a new city with no one around.

About Me

Traveler + Homebody hybrid
I’m 27 and proof that someone can plan a whole trip with matching itinerary… then cancel it all just to stay in and binge-watch a series.

I’m happiest when I’m:
• Sipping coffee at a newly discovered café (or any cafe in general)
• Eating my way through hidden food spots
• Staring at a peaceful sea or mountain view
• Watching k-dramas, thrillers, or anything with good plot twists
• Talking to dogs like they’re babies 🐶
• Crying over movies but laughing at my own jokes — balance! Haha
• My friends say im funny and I usually give life fo the party (that is valid until my social battery gets depleted)


About You

You’re taller than me (5’4), physically attractive (yes, pasok dapat sa pogi standards — which actually depends and varies 😆), and you know how to hold a real convo — not just “wyd?” energy.

You’re someone:
• Who’s kind, consistent, and knows what he wants
• Who enjoys going out and exploring but also loves chill days
• Who’s down to travel and can match my energy when it comes to making plans ✈️

• Na hindi jeje typings (no offense, just preference)

🚩 Dealbreakers:
• Doesn’t know how to hold a conversation beyond “kumain ka na?”
• Smokes — sorry, non-negotiable
• Ghosting or playing games — grown-up na tayo diba

1l20tea,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1l20tea/the_flight_that_called_me_from_nowhere/,The flight that called me from nowhere,"I work as an en-route air traffic controller in Moscow ACC. A few months ago I was transferred from the Moscow Approach Combined sector to the Moscow Control North sector — specifically, to the night shifts, when the sectors North, West, and Gorky are collapsed into one.

At night, traffic is light. The hall gets quiet. Most of the time you just monitor. My working position is next to the T1 sector (transit traffic over the Moscow area), and not far from us there’s the Southern Moscow sector, and the merged Moscow Approach, Vnukovo TMA, Domodedovo TMA, and Sheremetyevo TMA. A pretty standard layout.

That night, I had control of the collapsed North sector. The Senior Duty Controller (SDC) was sitting just behind me, as always. Also nearby was the Flight Director — not directly involved, just observing the overall flow.

It was a slow night. A few overflights at FL340, handoffs from T1 to North, some initial descents into Sheremetyevo via NAMIN, ROMTA. I was sipping cold coffee, monitoring a quiet frequency, when it happened.

At 01:42 local, a call popped up on the frequency:

""Moscow Control, this is Ruby 210, level three six zero.""

I almost didn't catch it at first. There was a strange modulation — not distorted, but flat, dull, like it lacked the usual background hiss. Still, it was clear enough. Standard phraseology, correct call.

I checked the strip list.

Nothing.

No Ruby 210 on frequency. No flight plan under Ruby. No call sign match on the screen. I leaned closer, ran a quick scratch search through the FDP. Still nothing.

Maybe a callsign confusion? Someone misreading their own?

I keyed the mic.

""Ruby 210, Moscow Control, confirm your call sign.""

A pause. Then:

""Affirm, Moscow. Ruby 210, level three six zero, estimating point RULAB at zero one five seven.""

RULAB is within my airspace. I glanced at the radar again.

Still nothing.

I don't know why I didn't immediately flag it. It felt... procedural. He sounded so normal. I did what I was trained to do.

""Ruby 210, Moscow Control, roger. Squawk ident.""

Nothing happened. No ident, no radar return.

I was about to ask again when a hand landed on my shoulder.

It was the SDC.

He didn't say anything at first. Just stared at my screen.

Then, very quietly, he reached over and **cut my transmission line**.

""Don’t answer that one again,"" he said.

I turned to him, confused. ""What the hell is Ruby 210?""

He didn’t blink. Just said:

""I thought we wouldn’t get it this month.""

And then he walked off to the Supervisor’s desk.

I sat there, silent, headset in my lap. No more calls came from Ruby 210. No radar return. No strip ever generated.

That night, when I got off shift, I went home and searched through my old ATC training folders. There was a section — crash studies and incident reports. One of them hit me like a punch to the chest.

**An en-route loss of separation followed by structural failure. No survivors. Aircraft lost radar and radio contact before the incident. Estimated last call: ""Ruby 210, level three six zero"".**

The date?

**2008.**

# The Ghost in the FDP

When my shift ended at 05:00, I didn’t go straight home.

The sky outside was that iron-colored pre-dawn you only see from the high windows of a command center. The cleaning staff had just started moving through the hall. Most of the other controllers were already logging out. I sat there, headset off, staring at the empty slot on the radar screen where Ruby 210 should have been.

I told myself it was just a miscall. A bleed-over from another FIR. Maybe a simulator transmission — I’d seen that happen before. But something in the voice, the timing, the way the SDC reacted…

No. I had to check.

I waited until the room was nearly empty, then slid into one of the admin terminals in the back. It wasn’t against the rules — not exactly — but it wasn’t encouraged either. These terminals are used for strip history, FPL archives, tech support routing. Not for casual curiosity.

I typed in:

CALLSIGN: RUBY210  
DATE RANGE: LAST 60 DAYS  
STATUS: ALL

Nothing.

Expanded the search:

DATE RANGE: LAST 365 DAYS

Still nothing.

I ran it again with wildcards. Partial callsigns. Alternate entries. Possible typos. Tried searching by aircraft type, route, SSR codes, estimated times.

Nothing.

I leaned back in the chair, staring at the screen.

Then I remembered: in training, we were taught that the FDP logs *everything*. Even if it’s deleted, even if it was never assigned to a sector, the call is stored as a ""raw trace"" — an unconfirmed object in the technical backend.

It’s not meant for operators. But I knew one of the old routing engineers — a quiet guy named Sergey who always worked night maintenance shifts. He wasn’t in today, but I had his internal address. I sent him a short, dry message:

“Hi. Quick tech inquiry. Did any raw FDP object use the callsign RUBY210 in the past 48h, UTC range?”

He didn’t reply immediately. I went home.

I showered. Made coffee. Laid down on my bed without sleeping.

Around 09:00, my phone buzzed.

**It was Sergey.**

“Don’t send that name again. I don’t want it in the log.

No emoji. No sign-off.

My blood went cold.

I opened my logbook. Flipped back to my entry for that night.

And noticed something else.

Under ""frequency events,"" I always write down each first contact from a flight: time, callsign, sector entry.

For Ruby 210, I had written:  
**“RUBY210 - FL360 - RULAB - 01:42”**

But the handwriting…

It wasn’t mine.

# Not the First

I didn’t sleep that day.

Every time I closed my eyes, I saw that strip line. The call sign, the level, the fix. My own pen — but not my hand. Same ink, same pressure, but something in the shape of the letters felt… wrong. Like someone had written it while trying to mimic me.

I kept telling myself I was tired. That fatigue does strange things.

But it wasn’t enough.

Around 18:00, I went back to the center. Off shift, unofficial. Told security I left a personal item. They didn’t ask questions. Most of them know better than to get involved when ATC staff walks in with that look on their face.

T1 sector was working that evening. Same guy — Anton, mid-40s, always sharp, ex-military. A guy you could trust not to panic.

I waited for his strip handover to finish, then casually slid into the break room behind the radar line. Waited for him to come grab coffee.

He noticed me immediately.

“Didn’t think you had back-to-back shifts.”  
“I don’t,” I said. “I just… I wanted to ask you something. About last night.”

He didn’t react at first. Just stirred his coffee. No eye contact.

“I heard a call. RUBY210. No flight plan. No radar. Nothing.”

That’s when he looked up.

Long, silent stare. Not confused. Not surprised.

Just… tight.

He set the cup down.

“You acknowledged it?”

I hesitated. “Just once. SDC cut my line after that.”

Anton nodded slowly, then leaned in slightly, voice low.

“They told me about that one in training. Back when I moved from approach. There’s no official policy. No logbook entry. But every few years, someone hears it. Sometimes it’s a different call. Always a ghost. Always FL360. Always near RULAB.”

I didn’t know what to say. My heart was thudding.

“What is it?”

Anton picked up his coffee.

“Some say it’s a training artifact. A corrupted simulator scenario that loops. Others think it’s an old crash that never cleared from the system.”

He paused.

“I used to think it was a myth. Until I heard it too.”

I froze.

“You—?”  
“Six years ago. Same time. Same voice. I didn’t answer. But I heard it clear. Clean. Like a real flight. They never found a source.”

He started to leave the room, but stopped at the door.

“Here’s the thing,” he said. “Once you hear it… it comes back.”

# RULAB, Again

My next night shift was three days later.

I didn’t ask for it — the roster just fell that way. North sector again. This time, the full night shift. All three sectors — North, West, Gorky — combined into a single console. Traffic load: minimal. One or two transits per hour. Nothing complex.

Just like before.

The room had the same sterile hush. The radar screens glowed the same cold blue. The click of strips, the occasional handoff chatter, the low hum of air vents.

SDC was the same: Alexey, former military, calm, sharp. He didn’t mention the previous shift. But I saw him glance at my console more than once in the first hour.

I logged in. Established comms. Tested voice links. Normal.

But around 01:30 UTC, the discomfort returned.

It wasn’t fear, not yet. Just a *presence*.

Like the air was thicker.

The headset felt heavier. The screen slightly too dim. The symbols on the radar — tiny, twitchy. Not moving wrong, but *not moving natural*.

I checked sector logs. No anomalies.

I opened the FDP interface. Nothing unassigned.

Then I noticed a shift: the system's latency counter — normally 4–6 ms — ticked to **38**. Just once. Then back down. No explanation.

I checked the STCA system.

It reset itself.

**That never happens.**

At 01:41 UTC, a faint sound broke the silence. Not a voice. Not a tone. Just… static. Low and sharp, like someone had keyed their mic for half a second without speaking.

SDC looked up immediately.

I stared at the screen.

Then at **01:42**, just like last time:

""Moscow Control, this is Ruby Two One Zero, FL360, approaching RULAB.""

But this time… I didn’t react.

I didn’t touch the PTT.

I let the silence hold.

The voice didn’t repeat.

But then — something worse.

The **strips auto-generated a flight**.

RUBY210.

RULAB — 01:42.

FL360. Type: A320.

Assigned SSR: **0000**.

The system had written it in.

It had filled itself in.

I felt the blood drain from my hands.

I turned to SDC.

He was staring at the same thing. Then back at me.

His voice was quiet.

“Log it manually. Don’t acknowledge. If he speaks again… give me the headset.”

# Departure of the Watcher

For seven minutes, the room was silent.

No new traffic. No handoffs. No chat on VHF or coordination lines. Just that one strip on my console: **RUBY210**, FL360, inbound from **nowhere**.

I didn’t touch it.

I didn’t delete it either.

SDC sat next to me, stiff, not moving. Watching. I heard him breathing — slow, measured, like someone trying not to panic.

At 01:49 UTC, he stood up.

No words. No sigh. He just removed his headset and placed it — neatly — on the table.

Then he turned to me.

""If it calls again… Don’t respond.  
Not even to me.  
Especially not to me.""

He looked… different.

Like something inside had shifted, collapsed maybe.

And then he walked out.

No handover. No explanation. No call to Ops or supervision.

The room swallowed him like he’d never existed.

I sat there, alone.

T1 sector glanced at me from his console. I saw it in his eyes — he knew something was wrong. But he said nothing.

I hovered my cursor over the RUBY210 strip.  
Clicked its info.

The source field read:

\[undefined\]@fdp.localhost:0

Not ARINC. Not EUROCONTROL.  
Not even a manual input.

I tried to delete the strip.

**ACCESS DENIED.**

Then, exactly at 01:52, the system flashed a route update.

RUBY210  
Route amended: RULAB — AGLAN — PESAB  
Speed: M.78  
ETA at boundary point: —

But the SSR remained **0000**.

No transponder. No squawk.  
Still, it moved. On the scope. Smoothly. Perfectly.

Like it was real.

Or worse — like it was **remembering** what real looked like.

# Echoes in the Wire

At 02:07 UTC, the call came in.

Not on the main ops line.  
Not on the coordination loop.  
On the **maintenance interlink**, usually reserved for backend tech support — database failures, voice channel diagnostics, that kind of thing.

I didn’t even know it had a ringer.

But there it was.  
A dull amber flash on the bottom screen.  
**CALL: SYS/MAINT LINE 04 — INCOMING.**

I hesitated.  
Then answered.

""Moscow Control, North sector combined. Who’s calling?""

A pause.  
Then a flat voice. Filtered. Almost synthetic.

""Confirm your current FL360 inbound from RULAB. Callsign: Ruby Two One Zero.""

I froze.

""That… flight is not under control. Strip appeared automatically. SSR 0000. No voice contact since 01:42.""

The voice didn’t change tone.

""Do not delete. Do not amend. Do not report this to your supervisor.""

I stared at the screen.

""Who is this?""

The reply came instantly.

""This communication is monitored. Further inquiry will be noted. Resume normal operations.""

**Click.**

Line dead.

No trace in the phone logs. No caller ID.  
No redial option.

I looked around.  
The T1 controller was typing strips, pretending not to have heard.

But I saw the sweat on his collar.

# The Weight of the Signal

02:15 UTC. The control room felt wrong, like the air had thickened into something you could taste. The hum of the air vents was there, but beneath it, a faint vibration pulsed through the floor, like the system itself was straining. The RUBY210 strip sat on my console, its text glowing faintly, daring me to interact with it.

I didn’t.

Anton, at T1 sector, was still typing, but his movements were off—jerky, like he was forcing himself to focus. His coffee sat cold, untouched. He’d heard the maintenance line call. I knew he had. But he didn’t look at me, didn’t say a word.

The radar showed the RUBY210 blip, still tracking toward IPSIL at Mach 0.78. No transponder. No ADS-B. Just a ghost, moving through my airspace like it had every right to be there. I checked the system logs again. Nothing. No record of the maintenance interlink call. No trace of RUBY210 beyond the strip and its route: RULAB to IPSIL to LEMRO.

I wanted to message Sergey again, ask what he meant by “ghost packet.” But his warning—“Don’t send that name again”—stopped me cold. My phone stayed in my pocket.

At 02:20 UTC, the radar flickered.

Not a full blackout, just a single frame, like the system blinked. The RUBY210 blip vanished, then reappeared, now closer to IPSIL. The latency counter spiked—39 ms—then dropped back to normal.

I kept my headset off. Alexey’s words echoed in my head: *“Don’t respond. Especially not to me.”* What did that even mean? I glanced at his station. His headset was still there, perfectly centered, cord coiled tightly. No sign of him. The supervisor’s desk was empty. No Flight Director. Just me and Anton in a room that felt too vast.

Then the strip updated.

RUBY210.  
Route amended: IPSIL — LEMRO — \[undefined\].  
ETA: —.  
Status: ACTIVE.

*Active?*

The system shouldn’t mark a flight active without a confirmed radar return or flight plan. My hands shook as I opened the FDP interface and queried the strip’s source.

\[undefined\]@fdp.localhost:0

Same as before. But now a new field appeared:  
*Last update: 02:22 UTC. Operator: \[REDACTED\].*

I hadn’t touched the strip. No one had.

I glanced at Anton. His hands were still, hovering over his keyboard. His eyes were locked on his screen, but he wasn’t typing.

“Anton,” I whispered. “You seeing this?”

He didn’t look up. Just nodded, slow, like he was afraid to move.

“Don’t touch it,” he said, voice barely audible. “It’ll go away. It always does.”

*Always?*

I wanted to press him, but the maintenance interlink lit up again. Amber flash, no sound. Just a pulsing light, like a warning.

I didn’t answer.

It stopped after eight seconds.

Then my headset crackled. Not the main frequency. Not the coordination line. The emergency backup channel, used only for overflow or critical failures.

“Moscow Control, Ruby Two One Zero, requesting descent to FL340.”

The voice was the same—flat, too clean, like it was reciting something it had said a thousand times before.

My hand twitched toward the PTT, years of training screaming to respond. But Alexey’s words held me back. I let the silence stretch.

The crackle stopped.

The strip updated:  
RUBY210.  
Level: FL340.  
Status: DESCENDING.

The radar blip shifted downward, smooth and precise, as if my silence had given it permission to move.

# The Last Fix

03:05 UTC. I was unraveling. The control room was a void—no chatter, no handoffs, just the weight of RUBY210 on my console. The strip hadn’t updated in nearly thirty minutes. The radar blip held at FL340, tracking toward LEMRO. No conflicts, no other traffic. Just a ghost, gliding through the night.

Anton hadn’t spoken since his warning. His strips were piling up, unprocessed, his posture rigid like he was waiting for something to break. I couldn’t sit still. The air felt heavy, pressing against my chest. I stood, walked to the coffee machine, more to escape the console than because I needed a drink.

That’s when I saw it.

Alexey’s station. His headset wasn’t just placed—it was *arranged*, cord coiled in a perfect spiral. Next to it, a single handwritten strip.

I hadn’t noticed it before.

I shouldn’t have looked.

But I did.

RUBY210.  
FL360. RULAB. 01:42.  
In Alexey’s handwriting. At the bottom, in smaller, sharper letters:  
*“Don’t follow me.”*

My heart stopped. I scanned the room. Anton was still at his console, head down. The cleaning staff hadn’t reached this side yet. I folded the strip and slipped it into my pocket, not sure why. It felt like proof. Or a curse.

Back at my console, the radar blip was gone. The strip remained, but its status had changed:  
RUBY210.  
Status: TERMINATED.  
Last update: 03:07 UTC.  
Operator: \[REDACTED\].

No log of the termination. No record of the blip vanishing. The system was clean, like RUBY210 had never been there.

But the strip was real. Ink on paper. Heavy in my pocket.

At 03:40 UTC, Anton stood. He didn’t look at me. Just logged out, grabbed his jacket, and headed for the door. He paused, his back to me.

“Don’t come back tomorrow,” he said. “Take a sick day. Trust me.”

He left without another word.

I finished the shift alone. No more calls. No updates. I left the RUBY210 strip on the console when I logged out at 05:00. I didn’t want it following me home.

But when I reached my car, I felt it in my pocket. The handwritten strip from Alexey’s desk. I hadn’t put it there.

I haven’t returned to the center. I called in sick, like Anton said. Last night, my phone buzzed at 01:42. No caller ID. Just a voicemail.

I haven’t listened to it.

But every time I pass a window, I catch myself looking up at the sky. At FL360. Toward RULAB.

And I swear, sometimes, I hear static.",1,1748918047.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False
1l20swp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1l20swp/thoughts_on_caplyta/,Thoughts on  Caplyta,"Hi, 

I am very sensitive to EPS/TD and it has felt like a nightmare having to learn about which meds have the least chance of causing this. I feel so alone because since mine is not as noticeable my family & doctors write it off. But it has spread to my teeth years later even without being on meds. But I found out weed and coffee were factors and if the nigrostriatal pathway has been damaged or compromised it is sensitized to any dopamine related effects. Both of which could be caused by cannabis & coffee. It’s like I shot myself in the foot because I didn’t know this. Although, I knew that I shouldn’t have been smoking weed or drinking so much coffee. I believe I was self medicating due to depression. 

My point is that each time I am hospitalized I get shot up with Haldol & Cogentin. My lips began to swell that it looked like I had a bad case gone wrong of botox injections and there was nothing I could do but hope it would go away. Could you imagine how distressing that could be. 

It also didn’t help that my psychiatrist had also prescribed me a high dose of Latuda 80mg, which despite being a newer med, is a strong D2 blocker - making it a moderate to high risk, especially combined with Haldol & Cogentin. I also recently found out that even Cogentin can cause TD to worsen. 

So, after researching all the meds that could possibly be safer for my sensitivities their were minimal choices. 

Seroquel is my God send for sleep and mania but not necessarily a good daily AP despite it being one of the minimal ones that cause these effects. 

Although, I discovered that Caplyta, although new, focuses on targeting more of a Serotonin receptor not associated with movement parts of the brain.

I also read that Caplyta is only dosed as a single 42mg. You don’t have any other dosages they can prescribed which is similar to about 40mg of Latuda respectively. So, the doctor cannot overmedicate you. So I am planning on having  them mark it on my chart to never use Latuda again if I am not in a condition to choose, even though I pray that may never be the case again with early intervention and a better understanding of my condition. 

It’s all rather complicated, but I wanted to know what anyone’s experience has been like on Caplyta? ",1,1748918004.0,BipolarReddit,1,1.0,False

Feeling used, confused, and trying to heal.","I’m currently on Day 1 of a no contact challenge, and I’m struggling.
I couldn't sleep last night — too many thoughts, too many questions. I keep asking myself: Was I just used? Did he ever even care?

We weren’t just hooking up — we were something. Or at least, that’s what I thought.

He started off so strong. Put in effort, showed care, picked me up, dropped me home, remembered my likes/dislikes, even got me fancy food on dates. He seemed emotionally mature, kind, funny — someone I could genuinely look up to. I started to open up about my family, my struggles, and my messy days, and he listened. He opened up to me about his ex, past traumas, his dead dad, etc. It felt safe.

But after a few months, he started pulling away. Delayed replies, lack of interest, no check-ins. When I gently asked what was going on, he gave vague answers like “I’m just lost” — then later told me his mom didn’t approve of my matrimonial profile and he didn’t want to argue with her or try to convince her otherwise.

That broke me. Not just because she didn’t approve — but because he didn’t even try.
No stand. No fight. No “let’s figure it out.”
Just… retreat.

I felt completely abandoned. In my mind, I kept wondering — what’s so wrong with me that I’m not even worth defending?

Still, I tried to be civil. We ended it. Then a month later, I reached out just to check in. We met again. Friendly. Platonic. Fine.

But then came the confusion again.

He initiated physical intimacy. We drank, we kissed, we hooked up. And it didn’t stop at once. This kept happening for a few weeks — until he started going distant again. I finally asked what we were doing, and he pulled out the old “we talked about this, we’re just friends” line.

When I asked why he kept crossing boundaries when he knew I liked him and he didn’t want more — he said, “yeah, should’ve had boundaries,” followed by vague non-answers and defensive energy like I was blaming him.

I wasn’t blaming him. I was hurting. I told him I did what I did because I still had feelings — he did it knowing he didn’t. And now I'm left wondering: Did he ever really see me for me? Or was I just convenient?

Now he says he wants to “be friends with boundaries,” but I’ve decided not to reach out again. We were supposed to meet for coffee, but he said he “needs space to process.” What is there to process when he already made his choice?

I miss him. I keep getting waves of “just one message,” but I’m trying not to give in. I’ve done this before — I’ve healed before. But right now, it just hurts.

If anyone’s been in this weird in-between space where someone says they want “just friendship” but acts differently, how did you cope?
And how do you stop feeling like you were just used for attention, comfort, or sex?

Any insights are welcome. Just wanted to share.",3,1748917924.0,RelationshipIndia,4,0.81,False
1l20ryf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1l20ryf/captain_and_deckhand_is_he_into_me_or_am_i/,"Captain and deckhand, Is he into me or am I reading too deeply into it?","I recently got offered a job deck handing on a party boat for my sisters friend, Im 18F and hes 23M. He is a captain that runs a pretty successful company for party boat on a popular lake near me. My sister, him, and myself all hungout for a whole weekend staying at his place and my sister and I kept getting the vibe he was flirting. Little things like her catching him looking up at me while he played guitar, checking me out, making a point to sit next to me in ubers, etc. I didn’t think much of it until my sister told me she was getting that vibe. He also has shown a lot of interest in my last relationship. I recently went through a breakup and he’d been encouraging me to leave for quite some time, he’d even go as far as to take my phone so i wouldn’t get caught up on talking to my ex while I was there. Anyway he insisted on me coming out to deckhand for his boat party that weekend and said I had a great personality for it. I was nervous and decided to push through and go anyway.

The day comes and we agree that I come a couple hours early so that I can learn the ropes and break my nerves before we pick the group up. Its hard to summarize those first couple hours but I definitely felt like he was flirting with me. He wouldnt let me carry anything even though I told him it was my job (Ik this is normal, he is just kind) but he literally wouldn’t let me carry or pay for anything. He let me drive the boat and he was being quite touchy like leaning up against me and holding the wheel with me. Told me to go sit in the front of the boat in front of wheel and keep my eyes on him while he drove the boat under a huge sprinkler type thing, i got soaked. He was just being sweet, he also took me to get coffee at this popular coffee shop. he kept asking me if i thought he looked good because “he likes to look good for his groups”. lastly i brought bandanas and he wanted to wear them together and match, he even had my tie his on because he “didnt know how”… then he took pictures of us. He also asked if I wanted him to take pics of me in front of the view. These are all kind of mediocre compared to what happened once the group got on.

Anyway we pick up the group and they are all so kind, it immediately puts me at ease. We get familiar with everybody yk introductions, basic rules etc, encourage a couple beer bongs and then let them do their thing, my job was basically just to check on them and make sure they had drinks and were having a good time every now and then. As the night went on the flirting was getting heavier, he (lets call him Josh) would touch my waist, getting really close when talking to me, the things hed say were flirtatious. I was sitting in the captain chair and he’d come sit on my lap. At one point he picked me up out of the chair by my armpits lol. Him and I spent a lot of time on the upper deck because everyone was below and we would just lay there and talk. His friend even sent him a video from another boat where josh and I were laying up top next to each other and he was kicking his feet. Later, were on the lily pad (like a floating pad that you connect to the boat) and he put seaweed on my head and said “so pretty”.

Eventually he left for a second while I was on the top deck and one of the guest came up and the first thing he said to me was asking if the captain and I were dating, to which I replied no… He said it seemed obvious we were into eachother and that confirmed my thoughts. I just want an outside opinion and want to know if I am just taking it to deep!! I honestly denied it until the guest had come up and asked me about it, he was in fact a man so idk.",2,1748917922.0,AskMenAdvice,4,1.0,False

So, in 1997, my mom, who was not a big fan of F1, bought my dad a Damon hill mug (his favorite driver at the time) . My dad loved that mug, has always said it was his favorite mug he has ever had (he drinks a cup or 2 of coffee/tea every morning). unfortunately, it got broken or lost in the mid 2000's. With fathers day coming up, i want to see if i can find that mug or something close to it. i dont remember all the details on the mug from him tell me over the years and i dont want to ask him so i can make it a surprise. 

  
• i know it was from the 1996 season as he says it had his championship winning car on it

• I also think he said that hill was holding the trophy on it as well, but that may be wrong

•i would guess it would have been a officially licensed mug as, being from the Midwest region of the USA, i wouldn't think there would be a lot of knockoff damon hill mugs in stores or what not in the USA in 97. (i cant find out where my mom bought it as she passed away in 2016)

•I have also tried to find it myself, but all i can come up with are mugs from Redbubble and other shovelware merch stores like that. ive also checked ebay from time to time and get nothing.

I have always wanted to grow citrus and have seen other people in the area growing them but could never find any at the nursery.  Well yesterday I finally found some small lemon and lime trees and some larger orange varieties.  How often should I water and fertilize?  Do citrus trees do well with coffee grounds and or epsom salt and how often?  What encourages flower/fruit production?

The small lemon and lime trees say they are hardy to zone 7b on the container but the tag wrapped around the trunk says to cover or bring indoors when below 30*F or -1C.  I planted both of them together in a large planter that I can bring indoors if needed this winter.  Will I need to bring them indoors or wrap them this winter since they are supposedly hardy in 8b?  Should I expect these to flower this year or next year?

I went back today and bought a larger Meyer lemon tree that has two fruits already growing and also a tangerine variety that has a few fruits growing.  I don’t see anymore flowers on either, so I wonder with these two, will that be all I’ll get this year or should I expect more flowers to bud in the coming weeks?  These also are supposedly hardy but I put them in individual planters as well.  Will these need to be covered or brought indoors this winter?
One last question, I have a friend who has a satsuma tree, can I take a cutting and graft it to my tangerine tree?  I’ve tried cuttings before with hibiscus and I’ve never been successful but I read all the time about citrus doing well with grafting.  How long does a graft take to incorporate?

Sorry for all the questions; I love to garden but I am a complete noob with citrus.

**Please no transphobia or homophobia it's pride month**

Me (Mtf) and my crush (nonbinary they/them) have been friends at work for like 4 months. We talk a lot and ask each other questions about our interests and goals and stuff and encourage each other in schooling and career stuff. The only person I've formed a friendship with at this job. I am demisexual and pan. They are only into women.

Two weeks ago I realized that I didn't identify with the nonbinary label anymore after using she/they pronouns for 3 years. I told my boss I was a woman and that I wanted a new name tag that represented this. That Monday after the weekend I saw them at work and we started talking about gender expression and stuff. I didn't know they were nonbinary at this point. I come out to them as my true self and they come out to me. We talk about our sexuality and explain our gender preferences for a bit and then we both have to go back to work so we end the conversation and say bye as we will likely not have a chance to talk again until next shift. 

That Friday we talk about me wanting to get out more and meet people and their struggles with never getting responses and people being really flaky in our local queer community. There's like a 5 second pause and I check the time and they are leaving so say bye have a nice day see you Monday. 

Monday rolls around and we have another chance to talk. It's memorial day and our retail store is slow as fuck. So we closed down the front register and they came to my department to check people out for me. We had 4 hours to talk and it was just nonstop conversation. Id get an order and do it and we'd pick up right where we left off. Same thing when they had to check someone out. The topic of me wanting to go out more came up again and I talk about how I haven't dated since 2021 and they ask if I'm currently interested in anyone or seeing anyone. To which I reply ""PFFFFFFFT NOPE!"" they ask how I feel about dating currently and I say ""I have school going on and I'm really focused on that so it's not something I put time into or even really care about right now."" Now I'm not very good at picking up on body language (autism) but I'm pretty sure after I said that their head dropped a noticable amount. At this point I'm thinking they might be into me so my demisexual brain starts firing and I'm realizing how cool they are and how well our personalities mesh. We talk more about me wanting to go out more to meet new people and get involved in the local queer community. Their shift ends I say bye

That night I tell a few friends I think I have a crush and all of them are saying I should've asked them out and that they are clearly interested in me. I really value being professional at work so even if I did ask them out then and there it would've felt wrong to me. 

Friday rolls around and I bring up that one of my favorite bands will be playing at a pride event but that I most likely won't be able to make it and that I'm bummed about it. They say ""yea I took off work for this other pride event but I only have a few friends to go with."" And I reply in and unsure voice ""I mIghT bE aBle To MAkE iT."" KNOWING I WORK THAT DAY. Earlier that week my friend decided we were gonna move to a new town and I started looking for new work. Currently have 3 interviews lined up. All my friends say again that I should've just asked them out again because I knew I'd be leaving the job at some point. But again I am very against forming relationships with people I work with. All of them are telling me I HAVE to ask them out Monday (today) we make a plan over the weekend and I'm ready prepared and convinced that I should do this. 

Today was literally the busiest non holiday day I've ever worked after being there for 2 years. Usually I get there early so I can go grab something to eat then I eat in the break room while they are on their break after their break is done we both go to do our jobs. So this morning I go to buy some bottled coffee from our little snack area at the front register. I break the news that I'm moving out with my friend and that I'll be putting in my two weeks as soon as I find work. A customer rolls up so I lose my chance to ask them out. Queue 5 hours of the busiest day so busy they don't have time to take their break until I clock in. Again losing out on the chance to ask them on a date. Usually when around 4 rolls around we close the register and we get a chance to chat for about 45 mins depending on how busy we both are. I'm fuckin busy. I still had like 12 orders in the queue and I'm busting ass so I can get all the ones due today done so I can ask them out. I finally get a chance to at least let them know I can make it to pride and they say ""Don't you work that day?"" And I go ""Oh don't you worry about that"" and they seemed a little happy about that but again I don't pick up on social signals or body language. My supervisor was still there like an hour and a half late and I'm trying to convince him to leave so I can ask them out before their shift ends. We exchange numbers and say we'll talk about plans in the next few days.  Now I literally had maybe 10 mins to talk to them 3 of them alone right before their shift ends.

I have 45 hours of sick time saved up that I have never used. So I'm using 8 of them to call off Friday and go to pride with a friend and meeting them there where I am 100% going to get them alone and ask them out. But I'm still not convinced they are into me. People have genital preferences and stuff but if they're trans and I'm trans I think the possibility they're into it is higher than if they were cis and straight. Are they into me? I'm making my move on Friday regardless but I just need the input of non biased and non invested people.

A few other things. They have said that drag queens makeup looks pretty and I showed them a picture of me in a dress at a wedding I attended Sunday and they complimented it and said my hair looked nice. Also complimented my hair today saying it makes me look more feminine. When we were first getting to know each other they would ask me question after question about my travels. To the point where I couldn't really ask them questions because right after I finished answering one they would ask another. We show each other our art a lot and compliment it and talk about art and stuff. 

TL:DR I am into a coworker and I think they might be into me too I'm asking them out on a date on Friday at pride but I just need to know if they're into me or not. I'm leaving the job asap. They asked if I was single and I said no and then they asked if I was looking for anyone to date which at the time I wasn't so I also said no. To which according to my friends they got visibly upset about after I described what happened. Is the only person at work who uses my correct pronouns and treats me like a real woman. I am Mtf. I think I'm reading into things and my friends don't have the context of the real situation. What do you think?",1,1748917588.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Dear Ember People,

I want to like this mug. I really do! When it’s working, it keeps my coffee at a perfect 145 degrees. I haven’t found another solution that will do this, and I have a collection of various mug warmers gathering dust to prove it. 

So I trudge along, dealing with the constantly failing charging pins; the app that makes it ever so hard to connect to the cup or once connected, to keep it connected; the charging that constantly fails, and the almost indecipherable lights.  

Just now, I am getting random blinking: white slow-blinking light, then solid red, and the app says I need to charge the cup. Now random rapid red light blinking, now no light at all. (I’m typing this in real time, so that’s what I’m seeing.)  

I have reset the cup until I’m blue in the face. I’ve Bluetoothed and re-Bluetoothed until I can Bluetooth no more.  

I’ve considered offerings; you know, maybe throw in a shot of whiskey to see if that appeases the EmberCupGods. But I’m not ready to go that far yet. 

Please tell me you are working on the tech; that one day, an Ember cup will heat my coffee to a perfect 145 degrees without making me feel like Charlie Brown once again helplessly but hopefully kicking an EmberCup-shaped football that we all know Lucy will snatch up at the last minute.  

Still no light, and the Bluetooth has dropped again. “Connect to your Ember,” it pleads; and I can offer no succour. 

Please help.",3,1748917581.0,Embermug,0,1.0,False

I have narrowed down my espresso machine search to two options. My main requirements are a relatively small machine due to counter space limitations, the ability to do a 1 oz or 2 oz shot ( I often do just a single-shot espresso drink, due to not always wanting a ton of caffeine), and , last and most important, a quiet machine. On my in-office days I am the first one awake in the house ( my mom is a \*very\* light sleeper), so I don't want a machine that makes too much noise. I have watched videos for the grinder and machine I plan on purchasing, and it seems the noise level is fine. 

I want a separate grinder and machine, as it works better for the limited counter space ( as I can put the grinder in one place, and the machine in another). 

  
I decided I felt better buying  a machine from a brick and mortar store, that way returns/repairs can be more straightforward. 

I""m thinking of the following Grinder: 

LELIT William Burr Grinder

And the following machine: 

De'Longhi Dedica Maestro Plus Espresso Machine with Automatic Steaming

I know a quality grinder is important. Looking at my favorite coffee house for whole beans. 

It seems the De'Longhi Machine is quiet, compact, and easy to use for a manual machine. You can do a single or double shot easily. ( Single shots are important. Sometimes I do one caf and one decaf.)

The grinder is quiet and high quality, and designed for use with espresso machines. 

Any drawbacks I'm not aware of?

Most people said they liked them because you can tactfully leave when you finish your coffee and end the date after less than 30 minutes if you aren’t feeling it. I’ll admit I never really considered that — I’ve only wanted to leave a date that early twice in 8ish years on the apps and a lotttt of first dates. Usually I’m having a nice time even if I may not want to see them again, and enjoy spending an hour or so together talking or doing something. (For context, I live in a large city where there are a lot of interesting, nice men to go around LOL) So, reality check me: how often are y’all leaving dates  (or wanting to leave dates) within the first half hour or less?

How would you feel about that?","So, my husband is a doctor, and from time to time, his ex fuck friends are old grindr hookups texting and asking him for medical advice, such as PrEP prescriptions, help with steroid-related issues, or sexually transmitted infections. He sometimes even meets them for coffee to counsel them. He does this for free and out of his workplace. 

I've always been a bit indulgent about it because he's a doctor, does public practice, feels a calling to be a public servant, and for him, it might be nice to help other gay people like him facing similar issues. So, I understand why he wants to help them.

I'm not worried about him cheating on me at all. 

But it just feels a bit weird to me. I don't completely like it. I kind of feel it's somewhat disrespectful and that it wouldn't be acceptable for many couples and that I only accept it to avoid being a snake. I am not like complaining much with him but I just don't like it.
