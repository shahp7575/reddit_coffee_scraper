1ikihhr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Interstitialcystitis/comments/1ikihhr/i_have_been_in_remission_for_the_past_several/,I have been in remission for the past several weeks. Here are some things that helped me.,"Hey friends! For context I am an early 40s male whose journey started in June 2024. I want to begin with the premise that I believe my symptoms and experience are a result of COVID sequelae (aka long-COVID symptoms). There are now more than a handful of studies out there that show a correlation between COVID-19 infections (and in some cases even the vaccines)* and lower urinary tract symptoms arising 10-14 weeks after infection.

My household is very COVID conscious, and we did not have our first confirmed COVID infection here until late June of 2024. My symptoms began exactly 10 weeks later, with very strong urinary frequency and urgency despite having very little to pass. I was peeing several times an hour! My symptoms actually started before an international vacation, and got so bad while we were traveling that we had to cut short our trip and come home early. The only thing that initially helped was to adopt a very strict version of the IC diet, which basically amounted to white foods - chicken and rice and oatmeal. With time and very strict adherence to the diet and among other things, my symptoms gradually started to improve. I want to make it clear that it's possible that the biggest improvement factor was time, if this was indeed a result of long-COVID symptoms, but there are many things that made immediate and sizable impacts on my quality of life and helped to slowly restore my sanity even if they weren't singularly responsible for improvement. There are many tools at our disposal and we should use all of them we have access to!

Okay, so here's the list, basically in chronological order, after adhering very strictly to the IC diet.

1). Hydroxyzine - I started taking this after reading about it here -  my wife happened to have an expired bottle of 25mg pills and while it's hard to quantify the histamine-blocking effect it had on my symptoms, the SLEEP BENEFITS were gigantic. As a lot of you can probably relate, I was barely sleeping and it was ruining my life. A few weeks after, I was able to get a prescription for 10mg from my primary doctor, which have been working just as well.

2). Pelvic floor physical therapy - even though my physical therapist determined that my pelvic floor was not the likely cause of my symptoms, it was still really helpful to learn the exercises, and those exercises were super helpful during flares to help me relax enough to get to sleep for a few hours. As well as the colon self-massage while having to abandon coffee and tea, but most importantly, my therapist was the first medical professional I met who *really* empathized with me and seemed to understand what I was going through. I was in a REALLY bad mental state and am so grateful to have worked with someone who really asked questions and listened to try to get to the bottom of what was happening. That was priceless.

3). Tibial nerve stimulation via TENS unit. This was prescribed by my urologist, after my cystoscopy which was performed three months after my symptoms started and found no abnormalities. In my opinion this lends some credibility to the long-COVID/nervous system inflammation and dysregulation correlation with IC/OABS. If you don't know what this is, please check it out and ask a health professional for the protocol. It did not improve anything overnight and it's hard to separate from all of the other things I added to my routine, but it definitely didn't hurt. It's also interesting to me that the electrode pads are placed on your foot, and my grandmother (not genetically related), who suffers from Hunner's lesions and has been a member of the IC society since the early 90s, can tell when a flare is about to happen when the bottom of her foot starts to hurt. Again this is anecdotal, but I do find that it's an interesting correlation and this is an intervention that has been practiced well before long-COVID was a possible contributor (my urologist had not heard of any of these new studies showing this COVID as a possible catalyst when I discussed it with him in December).

4). Talk therapy. IMMENSELY HELPFUL. If you are dealing with any chronic illness at all I can't recommend this enough. For me the physical symptoms were just absolutely demolishing my psyche. Just as absolutely low as I've ever felt. Please talk to a therapist if you can. The therapist also prescribed regular journaling, which I also have read in this subreddit several times is correlated with an improvement in symptoms if done consistently. And if it didn't make my body feel better, it sure helped me be able to face the world sometimes. 

5). Bottled/filtered water.  We have insanely hard water at my house (TDS hovering around 400) and things have always been a little off ever since I moved to this area. I noticed a huge improvement when I started drinking bottled water instead of our tap water. I hated that this actually worked. Eventually I bought a Zero Water filter system and that has been helping quite a bit. There are times when I end up drinking tap water and I swear I can tell a difference.

6). Lactoferrin and olive leaf extract. I started taking these both at the same time so I can't tell you which is more responsible, but these seem to be the last piece of the puzzle. Lactoferrin may have anti-inflammatory properties and olive leaf extract may have antiviral properties. And again I want to emphasize that this could be coincidental and time is the bigger factor for improvement - there's no way for me to know at this point, but things did get extra better within three weeks of taking just one capsule a day of each. 

I'm not ready to accept that I'm out of the woods yet, but in the past four weeks I've had the following foods without a flare that would have absolutely ruined me back in September: onions, tomatoes, ketchup, Diet Coke, Beer, Vodka, soy sauce, salsa, hot sauce, sausages. I'm still really wary of citrus and super tannic alcohol or any of the preceding foods in large amounts. I'm going to keep doing all of the things I mentioned above for a good while. I may never fully be back to ""normal"" but for now I'm sleeping well and I can go to a restaurant without having a panic attack and find something that's reasonably appetizing without sending me into a terrible flare.

Oh, and AZO and Cystex basically didn't do jack shit for me at the very beginning. Only after a month or so when things finally started to reduce a little bit did it even matter if I tried those. And since then just one of each has been really helpful to temper a flare-up.

I hope this helps anyone who needs it. I'm really grateful to the community here and how helpful everybody has been, especially to us newbies. And really on the cutting edge - I've been consistently surprised at some of the things that are almost common knowledge here that aren't yet widely understood among urologists. THANK YOU ALL and I wish you all good health and good sleep.

As usual I do the normal clean or tidy of the morning and then the evenings. 

He and I are both retired giving our time to local charities or sporting clubs.

Over the last 4-5 months I’ve noticed that after making his morning tea and lunches leaves a mess on the counter to be cleaned up by me mid-day. 

I mentioned a few things to him over the last few days as in, “hey would you mind putting your coffee cup at the front or very back of the dish washer drawer? So I don’t have to restack it?” or “would mind washing up the breadboard when you’re done”. Today when mentioning the breadboard he blew up at me, “you’re really making me mad, picking at the little things!” 

But it’s every day. I’m only asking him to clean up after himself.

He told me he was going to start demanding I did xyz and I told home I would appreciate it.

1ikies1,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/1ikies1/hockey_parents_making_up_their_own_rules/,Hockey Parents Making Up Their Own Rules,"It's a tale as old as time in this community.  Got about 48 rooms full of hockey teams bringing their usual bullshit--lots of noise, unattended kids running around, trash everywhere, and parents drinking themselves stupid in the breakfast room until about midnight, when I finally asked them all to disperse as I have to start cleaning up and preparing for the morning.  All left in good time; in situations like this, you give them fifteen minutes, they'll usually take half an hour.  Some leeway is always required.
Except for two guys in particular who just will not leave.
It's been three hours now.  I eventually managed to get them out of the breakfast room while I was cleaning it, wiping down tables, mopping.  They simply moved out to the chairs in the lobby (after I just mopped it).  They continue to talk and talk and talk here in the lobby, cussing more than you'd hear in Scarface and Pulp Fiction combined.  Curfew is at 10, and obviously you can't just loiter in the lobby for hours on end even if you have a room.
Not that it matters to these guys.  One of them just tries to gaslight me with this ""I don't understand why you're being so aggressive"" bullshit while his buddy downplays the situation with compliments.
It was, at first, just me asking them to vacate the breakfast room so I can clean it, as it was closed as of an hour ago (I had given them fifteen minutes and they still sat there an hour later, ignoring my occasional reminders).  Even then, one of them argues that they're not disturbing anyone, completely disregarding the fact that this place still has rules we all need to follow.  It eventually went to a terse conversation about the usage of a jar we use for tongs, which are meant to be used at breakfast time.  These guys had it on their table full of coke or beer or something.  I found it again in the coffee station sink, still full of the mystery liquid.  That's when I showed it to them and said as a gentle reminder that guests shouldn't be using these, because their purpose is not for beverages.  If they break, that would be on the guests, which we would rather avoid.  The man decided to ask ""Well who's using it now?""  Obviously no one right now, but I told him I saw it on his table and just wanted to let him know for future reference.  He continued to be a smartass about it and ask me why I'm being so aggressive toward him.  I told him i was calm and countered with the question as to why he was being so defensive about it.  After more sarcasm, I asked him if he makes up his own rules in every establishment he goes to.  He continued to argue with me with these runaround phrases designed to actually agitate me, so I gave up after a while, because it was obvious what this guy was up to.
And so, here they are.  Still sitting here.  We also can't have open alcohol out in the main areas, but that's a rule EVERYONE ignores.  These two bastards have been working their way through an entire case for the past several hours.  Not exactly sure what I can do about it now, since they're too drunk to evict, and I'm sure it's gonna be just as bad if not worse tomorrow night.  Saturday nights are almost always the days of reckoning.
Hopefully security will actually show up tomorrow night.  Been in the industry four years, and I always dread the hockey groups where I get inconsiderate assholes like these two.",2,1739001884.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,0,1.0,False
1ikidin,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1ikidin/my_duke_interview_experience/,My duke interview experience,"So I am an international and had an interview with duke alumni today and here is how it went.

- interviewer joined 5 minutes late
- the email said it would last 30-35 minutes and he literally oined with a free zoom meeting link that was supposed to get over after 40 minutes. Not a rant but I do not know how people ended up discussing for hours.
- since the time was running, it was pretty rushed but he gave me all the time I needed to speak. He had a few sets of questions (given below) and wanted to ask all of them so cut me short on 2 of them to avoid any unnecessary stuff.
- I did not get time strike a 'personal connection', it was a bullet train, he asked me and I had to answer. 

This is what the discussion was about -

1) introduced himself and briefly explained how the interview usually goes. He said he had a set of questions he generally asks and sometimes the responses lead to other questions. Generally it's a mix of both

2) he started with 3 questions in one go (I (don't remember the exact)  - tell me where do you live ? Tell me about your high school and your interests? Why duke ?

3) i answered all of them in one go and that took me a while. I am forgetting the sequence of questions but would do my best to include most of them.

4) if I am a parent wanting to enroll my student in (my city), why should I choose your school over others? 

5) if you had 45 minutes and could go for a coffee with somebody from the past who isn't alive, who would it be and what would you discuss? Second part to the same question, what about a person from contemporary world, it could be somebody alive ?

6) since time was running short he asked me to answer quickly if there was anything I would want to emphasise on in my profile apart from everything that I have said.

7) devoted the remaining 6-7 minutes for me to ask him questions.


It was very professional and sticked to the topic. I was very comfortable and enjoyed the interview. I wish we had little more time so that I could answer a bit more slowly and had more time to think about my answers. I am sure he would have asked me more about my interests if he had more time.

I wasn't the best person neither the worst. Well in short I was never a person who announced myself to the world but knew my lord, and valued the ethics of family,duty, and honor. Someone, a ""muslim"" stole my phone and exposed my bi-sexuality to my muslim family,community, and friends. I was ashamed myself and was wishing to stop myself and would never have proclaim to the LGBT movement. I lost my friends, I was mocked, I was called all kind of words  disgusting, failure to my family, and physically abused by these bullies. Now either people act in denial, avoid me, or call him a liar. Now do note exposing my sins nearly caused me to commit suicide, and outcasted.

Now two years has went by. I kind of used it as fuel to get clean off drugs, finish my degree, and achieved the job which I wanted and 6x my salary. I was just a troubled youth, In life people say you're not so important. But till today I get people mentioning it when they see me or they tell more people in mockery. In-fact i've came to the conclusion some of these people go prison, are of terrible character, don't pray, sell drugs, commit 101 sins, but no one haunts them. They are infact praised for some of there wrong doing in society. ""Oh his hard"", ""His got out his one of the brother"", ""He is one of the boys he has good cocaine"". We all know a once gangster who ruined many lives now religious leader. 

But be gay or take of your hijab, it's like an eternal tormenting. I realized, i will never been seen on ""their"" level.

I had tried to put my hope of people aside, and have my hope in Allah. But no matter how much I pray,read quarn, sunnah, or haddith. I question aren't the ummah the reputation of Islam and I clearly don’t fit in. They bully me after 2 years and left me with religious trauma of PTSD,depression, anxiety,insomnia,cold sweats at night, and still they are after me and tell more people. I get my possession stolen, and de-humanized, get my choice taken away, get made lonely without friends, and value tarnished towards other women.

The shame culture is rife lets be honest. Islam is not only private, it is public. It is not based only on rationality, it's also based on primarily optics. I played by their rules, but they could not respect my privacy nor sin. No matter what I achieve I realized I am less then everyone. People require a scapegoat to their inadequacies and a perceived evil. I live in fight or flight of who can they tell next.

I felt like I wanted revenge.Then I wanted peace. But I got bullied again 2 years later and re-triggered my PTSD. But now I'm getting to the point I want nothing to do with anyone or anything got to do with this religion. Even hell isn't worth killing myself which is the aim of these people. I just don't trust Muslims for support or to find a new group of friends who are religious. Infact anyone it’s so much baggage I feel worthless. Quite frankly I prefer to be alone. I may possibly just get truly cynical and just pretend to be Muslim to have my million dollar inheritance and live how I wish in another state. I'm worthless to a Muslim woman anyways, i'm damaged goods in this community. I'm the evil one and i've learnt to embrace it :).


The pain is unbearable most days and I struggle to leave my house. Making friends as an adult is hard men are cliquey. Women don’t want bi-sexual men, whereas prior I had no issues. I get assumptions I’m gay when I defiantly can’t love a man, competition issues that they can’t satisfy me, that I’m lying to myself, rather be friends or act overtly feminine wishing for gay best friend vibes. When I’m very outwardly masculine with kickboxing,bbqing, brewing and roasting coffees as hobbies.  I dont even feel comfortable explaining all my trauma it’s so much baggage from drug addiction to sexuality. I have no social proof. I was socially conservative and sexually privately liberal. I don’t fit in with the ideals of a liberal or leftist women’s life and neither do religious or conservative women want me. Once you fit into too many boxes you fit into none. I feel like I should not be in this world anymore. Hobbies aren’t helping and I’m getting scared what I will do to myself. The loneliness is devouring me everything being taken away from me my reputation, confidence, community, friends, social proof, my mind, my choice, my health. My masculinity being questioned by both male and female friends. Once you’ve got nothing you’re nothing.

TW - SA and Grape

My mom was always jealous of the fact that my sister and I loved our dad and were happier with him than with her. Which is sad because she always claimed my grandmother had been the same with her. 

Shed often have little fits about it even to the point of throwing me out of the house when I was around 10. 

However this one time, I was around 19/20 and my flat had been accidentally flooded. She was there to “help” but was really just sitting on the sofa whole my friend and I mopped up. 

The topic of my dad same up and my mom did that mocking thing she always did…”Oh ye you always love your dad more than you love me. You’ve always been a daddies girl, you and your sister!” This was normal and I brushed it off. Then she went further.

“I am sure I could tell you things that would make you change your mind.”

“I don’t think so.”

“Well, if you knew the truth…”

Ok I was stupid and I bit.

“What truth?”

“Did you know your dad r*ped me? Came home from work one day and demanded s*x and when I said no, he forced himself on me?”

She sat there smug with her cup of coffee. “Well? Do you still love him?”

“Yes? He’s my dad, ofc I love him. I don’t approve of that if it’s true but that doesn’t make me not love him.”

Eventually she left and I was left in a whirlwind of confusion, that seemed so out of character for my dad. It weighed on me for weeks. 

Eventually I went to visit my sister and told her what mam had said. She was disgusted. 

“Vile woman! Ofc that’s not true, how could you believe her? You know better!”

She was making sense so on the train ride home, I called my mam and asked her. Was it true? She laughed.

“No, don’t be silly. I just wanted to see if it would make you love him less.”

(I'm not a sell out I swear)

After dwelling on the suffocating loss of a fic I held quite dear, I began a quest to find something else to fill the angsty void left in it's wake. I did not expect much, and I only really did it out of habit; Else I succumb to the plight of having to leave my precious abode. 

At the dawn of my perilous journey, I packed what supplies I could muster (Copious amounts of coffee) and set off into the blinding white unknown of AO3's fandom list. I went past obscure franchises with twenty or so fics that would only lead to heartbreak, and I shed a silent tear for the authors who labored to bring these unknown creations into the limelight. I will visit another day, perhaps, when I have less to lose than I do now. 

Far in the distance, I saw a great behemoth that stretched from rising sun to rising moon, from which issued forth innumerable works of both great and terrible prose. This beast for which I held a certain distaste, but only for the one who had birthed it onto a napkin at a train station, and used their great power for terrible, terrible effect. It took many days to venture from beyond it's reach, and I left feeling a quiet sense of regret that I had refused to give any of it's number a chance. Another day, perhaps, when I have less to lose.

I ventured past the stormy seas, past many packed fandom, and in the midst I spied an old friend of mine. They had kept me company throughout my growing years, and they had taught me what good and evil were. The friend I had left behind as I deemed it 'childish' and 'not with the times'. I was a fool, then. I realize that now.

Perhaps, I thought, perhaps I might find my holy grail here. Here, in this soot-covered and corporate festered land of greed, I would find something untouched and still clinging on to the remnants of what once was. I docked my ship, and set out. I would search until I had either found what I needed, or succumbed to the despair around me. 

Once-great stories sat piled together with vain unfinished works, both deemed to be forgotten amid i the Canon Wars and subsequent infighting. The battles were brutal, drawn out, and accomplished nothing. I wasn't there, and had heard only rumors, but I knew it to be pointless bickering with drastic and far reaching consequences. 

I had already scoured innumerable husks filled with unrealized dreams and growing pains, and searched through discarded tales whose masters were to critical of to continue. I felt pity, of course, but also understanding. I was not innocent, of course, I didn't have much to lose back then.

Finally, when all hope seemed lost, when I was ready to lean back in defeat, I found something. No, not something. 

IT. 

I found IT.

I didn't believe it at first. No, I couldn't. I didn't know it at the time, dear reader, but I was afraid. Afraid of the loss I would feel should it not be everything I wanted. 

I shrank back, wary, and idly flicked through the masterful pages. It couldn't be...

But it was indeed exactly what I had been looking for. This was it! My heart leaped and I almost saw stars. First page. Masterful. Gripping. Opening both invigorating, enticing, and full of deep mystery. I nearly fled. But I am grateful I didn't. 

I needed recon. I shan't let myself get too excited. Who was this author, who had boldly claimed this was part one of a series. 

Liar, I swear it! But no, three works greeted me, all complete, and all stretching out before me like a golden field of wheat; Ripe for the harvest. I checked the authors other works. 

Finished. Finished. Finished. Posted as recently as yesterday. I immediately set to work. 

When I emerged once more, four hours had passed and my eyes had grown bleary from constant use. I underestimated how this story would grip me. How my favorite characters would be realized, how the setting would be fleshed out with both canon description and careful fan interpretation. How the events befalling would excite me, and I had never seen them put to paper like this. How the plot unfolded naturally, and the romance believable and \*real\*. I had never considered the pairing, but now I was invested. 

I took a moment to marvel at the expansive authors notes, somehow richer in tone and wit. Clearly, this author was someone who made it their mission to be as interesting as they aught to be. Perhaps, when my mind is clear, I will reach out and describe how their work affects me. 

But until then, I will continue the journey. Long may it reign, because now I have more to lose than ever.



Lmao anyways hope that wasn't too long, I got carried away. I've got my work cut out for me, but I was happy to have an excuse to bring things full circle. Let me know if you can relate, as I feel it's the dream of many to encounter such an author, especially fresh off the heels of a heartbreak like mine. 

Also kudos if you can figure out what both of the fandom's were.

I hope you have a great day/night!",1,1739001316.0,FanFiction,0,1.0,False

I can get a great moka out of it when I do my usual routine. Fresh ground, preheated base and water, low flame while under observation. The concept of the pot is to heat and foam your milk with the remaining steam from the chamber, after the coffee has been added to the milk.

Absolutely fantastic idea. My trusty red 2cup off-brand mokapot has been with me for a good while, but I have to walk back and forth from the fridge, microwave and stove for the fastest and best possible morning latteish strong creamy coffee.

Now for the burnt part. When I steam the milk enough to get it warm and foamy, it tastes like burnt coffee. If I don't let it steam very long, it creates a luke warm, slightly foamy coffee. My theory is that the bed gets too hot after the water has passed. So the steam ""grabs"" the burnt taste and adds it to the coffee post extraction.Preheated milk help, but puts me back to square one where I have to go back and for the microwave. It doesn't help with the foaming part though.

Do you have suggestions to thoughts on my issue? If you want to know more about the pot, ask away. It has some really funny features. 

Pre-edit. I can make my perfect coffee in other ways. I want to try to make it with this one. If you don't like the pot, complain to bialetti. I am here to chat about a funny mokapot. ",2,1739001233.0,mokapot,0,1.0,False

I’ve been following James Hoffmann’s videos for a while now, and they’ve been incredibly helpful in my journey into coffee. But I’ve noticed something interesting—James has reviewed almost every type of coffee brewer on the planet, yet I can’t seem to find a review of the Espro Press.

I started my coffee journey with a French Press, but I found it too heavy on sediment and sludge. Trust me I tried many hacks including paper filters in them but they either make coffee thinner or the process cumbersome. 

That led me to the Espro Press, which, in my experience, is an excellent improvement over the traditional French Press. It retains the rich, full-bodied texture that makes immersion brewing great, but the dual micro-filters remove almost all the sludge—something I really appreciate.

I know pour-over is incredibly popular, but from what I understand, it creates a thinner cup. Espro gives me the best of both worlds—a thick, rich mouthfeel without the grit. It even allows you to use paper filters for an even cleaner cup, but when I tried that, it felt too weak for my taste. That’s why I assume pour-over methods might not suit me either.

What surprises me is that Espro doesn’t seem to be widely discussed—not just by James Hoffmann, but even within coffee forums and YouTube (Appears even that company has given up 😄). Most Espro videos I find are at least 4–6 years old. So that makes me wonder:
	•	Why isn’t the Espro Press more popular?
	•	Are most people just moving towards pour-over and fine filtration?
	•	Is there any better alternative for those who love the French Press mouthfeel but want to avoid sludge?

And finally, is there a reason people dont discuss much on the Espro Press? Given how much it refines the traditional French Press, I’d love to hear your thoughts!",0,1739001121.0,JamesHoffmann,0,0.33,False

She always talks about how stressful taxes are and since she lives with me, I figured I’d make things easier for her.

It wasn’t well received. At all. (This was all last year) She made a huge deal out of it and started going off about how Valentine’s gifts should be romantic. She called me cheap (even though it was a $130 value). I tried explaining my logic— a gift like flowers die, but TurboTax lasts like a year- which she didn't seem to care about.

I think a big problem was that it was a license code, so there was nothing to physically wrap. I think that made it feel even less like a “real” gift to her. I was also planning to surprise her with a cute coffee mug after, but she walked out before I even got the chance.

  
She ended up staying at friends place that night and her group chat was roasting me. We made up, but she recently brought this up again bc valentines day is coming up and it started a huge fight.

1ikhz9l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1ikhz9l/20f_texas/,"20F, Texas","Hey everyone!

I’m pretty new to Reddit and thought I’d give this a shot since dating apps aren’t really my thing. I’m 20F, live in Texas, and currently in college working toward becoming a dental hygienist.

Faith is a big part of my life, and I want to be with someone who genuinely loves the Lord. I’d consider myself Baptist, though I don’t focus too much on denominations—it just helps explain my beliefs better. That said, if you’re Catholic or Orthodox, we probably wouldn’t be the best match. I believe in biblical leadership in relationships and marriage, and I want a man who will lead with wisdom and faith.

A little about me: I’m 5’2, Hispanic with a bit of Asian heritage (happy to share pictures), and I spend most of my time studying, helping out with my younger sibling, hanging out at coffee shops, or staying active at the gym or on walks. In the future, I’d love to be a stay-at-home mom and homeschool my kids, so I’m looking for someone who values family and shares that vision.

I do take care of my health and would like a partner who does the same. Ideally, I’m looking for someone between 20-29 who’s fit, grounded in his faith, and serious about building a Christ-centered relationship. It’s also very important to me that my future partner has a history of remaining abstinent and does not struggle with porn or lust. I want a relationship that honors God, built on purity and self-control.

I also tend to be more attracted to white men, so if you fit that and everything else I’m looking for, definitely reach out! (Please be normal😂)

Btw, I'm okay with LD for now but hopefully not for too long.

If any of this sounds like you, send me a message. I’d love to chat and get to know you!

You can find part one here: [Part I](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hxz9es/something_that_happened_to_me_in_early_november/)

I found myself in the hallway in front of my apartment. There were certain flashbacks, red lights, the cemetery. Chanting. The feeling that I am not entirely myself, I must have slipped out of consciousness. The night after my encounter, I was unable to find sleep. I must have been. Many of you might not be directly familiar with esoteric dealings, but many of those who are into the dark arts are, I want not say squeamish, but have a very healthy respect. 

I needed to find out what happened the night before. I felt like I was running a light fever, and my stomach felt raw on the inside. My eyes were burning, like they were melting out of my skull, and my temples felt like someone had beaten me with a hammer. I guessed the headache was mostly because of the lack of sleep. Had I had alcohol? Did I talk to anyone? This felt like the worst hangover of my life.

My apartment is small and consists of a very small hallway, my tiny bathroom and my bedroom/living room/kitchen with a kitchenette, a desk which also functions as a dining table and two bookshelves. I am normally a tidy person, but when I opened the door this morning I found myself in front of a sea of clothes, basically, everything I had was thrown on the floor. The smell was nauseating. It was strange to come back to my place like this. Thinking for one moment someone might have broken in, I checked the window and the door, but both seemed untouched. It was next to impossible to tell if anything was missing in the mess. I had a diary, one could call it a grimoire, but it might also have been among the stuff. I only had one set of keys, the only other person having a spare was my landlord. 

For one moment I was thinking whether I should retrace my steps.

*Nonci ta qaa*

This phrase ran through my mind. Speak the name of power. I decided to ignore this for now. I took the three steps into my bathroom, grabbed three ibuprofen, put two in my pocket, and swallowed the third with some water from the faucet. It was time to go grab some coffee, I could not be inside my apartment now. The place smelled too much like garbage.

I walked two blocks to the bus stop, where there was a small Turkish cafe. I needed to collect myself and calm my nerves. I walked in and the owner Burak greeted me. My habit was to have my coffee with a cardamom pod in the cup. I took my wallet out of my pocket and put it on the counter in front of me. 

“You look like shit”, he is blunt like that, of course, it must be true. I hope I don’t smell like garbage. When I ask for a cup of coffee, he tells me that there is none left. I look at him, trying to understand, when he laughs out, “Your friend had it all”. ”What do you mean?”, I ask, as I follow his glance. In the far corner, there she was. He smiles, but this smile is not warm, it looks menacing, like a grimace. I nod, as he turns around, breaks a cardamom pod, and pours me some coffee. She was sitting there, reading a comically large and apparently leather-bound book. This was, unmistakably, the girl from last night.

I did not dare to look at her too long and looked right back at Burak. He looked back at me and visibly forced a smile, giving his face a grotesque look, just to quickly avert his glance from me. As if he doesn’t stand my sight. I notice at this point that I still smell awful, like something is far rotten, for a long time. The fact that she was here could not be a coincidence, and it felt so wrong. My stomach felt like a knot, and my throat was just a big lump in my neck at this point. Fight or Flight, and for me, it was clear, that I had to get out of this place, I turned around and heard Burak say something sheepishly, but I could not turn around. I felt like prey.

I walked in the opposite direction away from my thrashed apartment, apart from trying to get away from her, I had no idea, where I was going. In fact, I must have been heading toward the university. I was walking as fast as I could without running and turned around. There was no sight of her, or Burak, or anybody else for that matter, nevertheless, I began running.

I ran for several blocks, breathing heavily and feeling my burning lungs after only a few steps. I tasted blood in my mouth, my feet felt like they would tear every time my shoes hit the ground. 

Eventually, I turned into a small side street and patted myself down. My wallet must have still been in Burak’s café, or I lost it while running for who knows how long. I stood trying to catch my breath for a few seconds and then began walking down the street quickly, my head dizzy and the terrible headache I had in my apartment earlier coming back with a vengeance.

I stood in a little arch, yielding to an inner yard, and tried to catch my breath. In the window on the other side of the street, I saw the head of a girl with a horrified look on her face. 

Mordeshu.

She did not look away immediately after I looked back at her but then was gone quickly. I stared at the window for a moment and realized that my reflection was pale, my hair completely messed up. I must have looked like a deranged homeless person. I looked down at my hands and with the intense smell of rot in my nose, and the hammering inside my skull, I noticed how diseased my hands looked. My fingers were bony as if the skin was old and about to fall off, completely pale. On my left middle finger, the skin around the fingernail was retracting in a way I had never seen before as if it was tightening and couldn’t hold on to the nail. I touched my fingernail and felt intense pain, as it came off as easily as plucking an overripe berry from a straw. 

Further down, I saw that there were two red puddles around my shoes on the pavement, where I was standing. Blood was leaking out of my shoes. My body gave in at this point and I collapsed onto the ground, with a last glimpse I saw how the door of the house on the other side of the street opened.

That’s when I found what I now call my secret weapon.

At first, I was skeptical. I’d tried countless supplements promising to fix my low energy, sharpen my focus, or magically help me drop those stubborn pounds. Nothing ever lived up to the hype. But something about this product caught my attention. Maybe it was the science-backed ingredients. Maybe it was the glowing testimonials that felt like they were written by people who’d been exactly where I was. Or maybe it was just desperation. Either way, I decided to give it a shot.

Fast forward three months, and my life has completely transformed.

The first thing I noticed was the energy. Not the jittery, crash-prone energy you get from caffeine or sugary drinks. This was clean, sustained energy that powered me through the day like a finely tuned engine. I woke up feeling refreshed—something I hadn’t experienced in years—and stayed focused and productive from morning until night.

And the mental clarity? Let me tell you, it was like wiping a foggy window clean for the first time. I could think faster, remember details, and tackle complex problems without the overwhelming sense of mental fatigue that used to haunt me. For someone who lives and dies by their ability to perform, this was a game-changer.

Then came the physical changes.

I’d always struggled with weight, especially around my midsection. No matter how much I worked out or tried to eat clean, progress was always slow. But with this product, my metabolism felt like it shifted into high gear. Combined with my renewed energy, hitting the gym didn’t feel like a chore anymore. It felt like an opportunity to push myself further. Within weeks, I started noticing changes in my body. My clothes fit better, the scale started moving in the right direction, and my confidence skyrocketed.

But the best part wasn’t just what I saw in the mirror—it was how I felt inside. There’s a unique kind of happiness that comes from knowing you’re living up to your potential, and for the first time in years, I felt like I was finally back in control.

I know it sounds dramatic, but I can honestly say this product changed my life. It wasn’t some overnight miracle, but it was the missing piece of the puzzle I’d been searching for all along. The natural ingredients, carefully chosen for their ability to support cellular energy, metabolism, and overall health, delivered exactly what they promised—and more.

Now, I’m not one to shout about products from the rooftops. But when something genuinely works, it’s hard not to share it.

That’s when I found what I now call my secret weapon.

At first, I was skeptical. I’d tried countless supplements promising to fix my low energy, sharpen my focus, or magically help me drop those stubborn pounds. Nothing ever lived up to the hype. But something about this product caught my attention. Maybe it was the science-backed ingredients. Maybe it was the glowing testimonials that felt like they were written by people who’d been exactly where I was. Or maybe it was just desperation. Either way, I decided to give it a shot.

Fast forward three months, and my life has completely transformed.

The first thing I noticed was the energy. Not the jittery, crash-prone energy you get from caffeine or sugary drinks. This was clean, sustained energy that powered me through the day like a finely tuned engine. I woke up feeling refreshed—something I hadn’t experienced in years—and stayed focused and productive from morning until night.

And the mental clarity? Let me tell you, it was like wiping a foggy window clean for the first time. I could think faster, remember details, and tackle complex problems without the overwhelming sense of mental fatigue that used to haunt me. For someone who lives and dies by their ability to perform, this was a game-changer.

Then came the physical changes.

I’d always struggled with weight, especially around my midsection. No matter how much I worked out or tried to eat clean, progress was always slow. But with this product, my metabolism felt like it shifted into high gear. Combined with my renewed energy, hitting the gym didn’t feel like a chore anymore. It felt like an opportunity to push myself further. Within weeks, I started noticing changes in my body. My clothes fit better, the scale started moving in the right direction, and my confidence skyrocketed.

But the best part wasn’t just what I saw in the mirror—it was how I felt inside. There’s a unique kind of happiness that comes from knowing you’re living up to your potential, and for the first time in years, I felt like I was finally back in control.

I know it sounds dramatic, but I can honestly say this product changed my life. It wasn’t some overnight miracle, but it was the missing piece of the puzzle I’d been searching for all along. The natural ingredients, carefully chosen for their ability to support cellular energy, metabolism, and overall health, delivered exactly what they promised—and more.

She doesn't know that I will not be going back to the temple again. I feel bad that I haven't told her I stopped paying tithing last October. I feel bad she doesn't know I don't have a testimony anymore. It is so hard being a PIMO. It is all coming to a head soon and I'm extremely nervous. I truly believe our marriage will survive this. We're still deeply in love. But it doesn't make the looming discussion any more comfortable right now. 

I want to fast forward to next year. On Sunday mornings I hope my wife and I are sitting on our porch drinking a bit of tea or coffee while we watch our neighbors drive to church. I hope my two teenagers are sleeping in instead of grumbling about having to get up and go to Sunday School. I hope my two daughters in college are out camping with their friends instead of sitting in relief Relief Society.

Most of all, I hope next year we're all healthier and happier for having left the church.

But...while I'm hoping for the best, I'm still planning for the worst, just in case. Send good vibes please.

A friend of mine is starting up a small accounting firm. So we were discussing what facilities we can provide like a coffee machine, water unit, snacks dispenser and a sanitary product dispenser to encourage employee engagement with the firm. So while discussing, a female friend of ours picked a point of preference for feminine hygiene products. We couldn't dig much further into the topic since our friend (F) was not comfortable to share much details for the same.
So my question is, in an office setup do women face a challenge while using a feminine sanitary products available at restrooms? If yes please elaborate along with a suggestion to overcome it.
PS. Making all brand and all products available is somehow impractical for a small startup like ours, and also seeking such highly personal preferences while joining the office is as well inappropriate.

1ikhlrk,https://i.redd.it/9wkxvtj87vhe1.jpeg,[Mentalist Rewatch] 7x02 The Greybar Hotel,"This anniversary rewatch will run daily until February 18, the 10-year anniversary of the Mentalist's series finale.


**SPOILER WARNING: Since this is a rewatch, it's assumed that anyone in these discussions has already seen the entire show, so all spoilers are allowed.**


Day 138 brings us to ""The Greybar Hotel,"" which begins with a car chase and a case of grand theft auto in Houston. One of the thieves, Marie, is caught by HPD while her boyfriend Cole gets away. Marie is taken to the FBI, where Abbott and Cho question her, wanting information about Cole. They offer her a deal, but she refuses and goes to jail. Cho asks if they're going to plan B, which is Lisbon undercover. The scene cuts to some days later, and Jane and Lisbon are sitting in the back of a car, and he's giving her tips, telling her not to lie a lot, leaving the details about her the same. He also makes her promise to wear the flip-flops when she showers. Abbott checks on them, and Jane cuffs Lisbon, then smiles and jokingly tells her he'll wait for her.

Title relevance: ""Greybar hotel"" is slang for jail, and Lisbon goes undercover in a prison.

Notable guest stars: Garcelle Beauvais (from Siren and The Magicians), Val Lauren (from Graceland), Brit Morgan (from True Blood and Riverdale), Ryan Dorsey (from Justified), and of course, Stella Baker (Simon Baker's daughter!)

Location: Travis County Correctional Facility


Notable scenes: 
- Lisbon, or ""Teresa MacGregor,"" goes through intake and is taken to the cell she's sharing with Marie. Lisbon shares that her grandparents came over from Derry (which, as a Derry Girls fan, made me lol). While Marie is initially friendly, when Lisbon asks for the top bunk, Marie becomes aggressive.
- At the office, Vega takes a cup of coffee to her desk, but Wylie spots her and worriedly approaches, telling her that's Jane's cup and that she should wash it and put it back and hopefully he won't notice. When she takes a sip, he warns her again not to, and to put it back.
- A woman from the CIA arrives and talks to Abbott, asking about Lisbon's undercover operation. She tells him that they're very interested in Cole because of his international ties, implying there's a bigger operation at stake. Jane and Cho look at Marie's escape route and try to hone in on where she was going. 
- Jane notices Abbott is wearing a new expensive aftershave, and we first learn of Abbott's wife, Lena. Noticing that Jane is worried, Abbott assures Jane they will bring Lisbon home safely. Later that night, Jane stays up, worried about Lisbon.
- Lisbon helps break up a fight at the phones, and Marie snaps at her again. She talks to Jane, and she tells him about how she's struggling to get close to Marie. He grins and says he may have met a woman like that before and says that he got her to lower her guard by lowering his own. 
- Lisbon takes his advice and talks to Marie about how she misses her boyfriend, describing him as a hustler. She talks about him and how she feels about him, speaking honestly like Jane suggested, that it felt so good not to lie anymore. Marie opens up, and Lisbon gets some details about their hideout.
- The FBI catches one of Cole's accomplices, and he tells them about Hendricks, the other accomplice. Abbott suggests they pull Lisbon out, but Jane says they should have Lisbon do a prison break with Marie to catch Cole. Jane goes to visit Lisbon at the prison, and Lisbon compliments Jane's vest, which he seems flattered by. 
- Playing his part in Jane's breakout scheme, Abbott tells Marie that she's being transferred to a supermax. Scared and in tears, Marie tells Lisbon, who tells her that the DA is going after her as well and she's facing twenty-five to life. As Jane suggested, Lisbon leads Marie to come up with the idea of breaking out. Lisbon tells her Marie needs to ensure they get a ride once they're out.
- Vega and Wylie listen to outgoing phone calls, and she listens to one angry at her brother (this is Stella Baker). They hear Marie making a coded call but are unable to trace it. They begin planning Lisbon's jailbreak. Jane presents a plan for them to walk out the front doors, similar to his own jailbreak in Season 2.
- Lisbon and Marie meet Hendricks outside the prison while Cho and Abbott follow. Wylie, Vega, and Jane watch the tracking from the office, but they switch cars and lose them. Jane tells Vega they're joining the search.
- Hendricks stops at a gas station and calls Cole. Lisbon and Marie go in, and they're browsing when a man grabs Marie and kisses her. It's Cole, and Lisbon tries to leave a message on a pad in the gas station store. Cole tells them that a half mile away, there's a helicopter waiting for them. Cole and Marie go to check out, but Cole gets suspicious of the texting cashier and shoots him dead. Lisbon smears the dead cashier's blood in the direction they're going.
- Jane and Vega arrive at the scene, and Jane finds her note and notices the blood. Vega insists they stay at the scene, but Jane is desperate to find Lisbon. Jane takes a case of blue Gatorade and takes the car, leaving Vega behind. He leaves a trail of Gatorades as he drives. 
- At the helicopter, Hendricks and Cole become suspicious when Lisbon approaches a gun. Jane finds them ready to get rid of Lisbon but has no service. He uses the rearview mirror from Hendricks's jeep and his wallet to pretend a sniper is watching them. They don't fall for it, and Jane tells Lisbon he's sorry, but he couldn't think of anything else. As they're about to shoot Jane, Abbott and everyone else arrive and arrest them.
- Cole tries to get a deal, but Cho is a hardass with him and tells him he's going to die in jail and that all he gets is no death penalty. He agrees to cooperate.
- Vega asks Cho if she can work more with him because he makes sense to her. He says he'll think about it.
- Sometime later, Jane arrives at the office, and Cho approaches, telling him that Jane knows the girlfriend of one of the names Cole gave the CIA. He hands him a file, and Jane opens it to find Erica Flynn staring back at him.

([see the Western Division post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FemFragLab/comments/1ijkwwn/rose_rumble_my_64scent_seeded_singleelimination/))

Thanks so much for all your awesome comments and for following along with me! Without further ado - the matchups.

[**Here's the current bracket**](https://i.imgur.com/dLwSw3f.jpeg)

# Round 1: Eastern Division

[**Maison Crivelli Hibiscus Mahajád**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Maison-Crivelli/Hibiscus-Mahajad-69069.html) **vs** [**Louis Vuitton Attrape-Rêves**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Louis-Vuitton/Attrape-Reves-51016.html)  
Hibiscus Mahajad is sharp, potently floral, and cannot be scrubbed off. Initially I thought Attrape-Rêves would be the clear winner, with its dark magenta rose resting in fruit syrup. But it just kept getting stickier, and heavier, choking me in rotten fruits and flowers. I could never inflict this on others. HM proceeds by a hair. **Winner: Hibiscus Mahajád**

[**Atelier Cologne Rose Anonyme**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Atelier-Cologne/Rose-Anonyme-16013.html) **vs** [**Jo Malone Red Roses**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jo-Malone-London/Red-Roses-5484.html)  
Rose Anonyme starts out almost a little humid, like a rosebush sprayed with hosewater on a hot summer day. But it quickly dries down into something too dry, too incense-y, and there’s some kind of baby wipe musk in the distant background. I expected Red Roses to be the rose to end all roses, but it’s actually a little bit sour and rotted, a little bit too much of the water the roses have been sitting in, unchanged for too long. It’s definitely a realistic red velvety rose, I can’t fault the realism one bit, so I’m surprised that I didn’t fall in love with it right away. Still, it beats Rose Anonyme’s babywipe potpourri. **Winner: Red Roses**

[**Maison Tahité Arabican Rose**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Maison-Tahite-Officine-Creative-Profumi/Arabican-Rose-92488.html) **vs** [**Goutal Rose Pompon EDP**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Goutal/Rose-Pompon-Eau-de-Parfum-49597.html)  
Arabican Rose smells like coffee left out to get cold. My husband said nothing, just recoiled like a cat made to smell a lime. Rose Pompon is sweet and powdery, so much so that it makes me want to sneeze. It smells like rosy sweet dust. **Winner: Rose Pompon**

[**Masque Milano Love Kills**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Masque-Milano/Love-Kills-54644.html) **vs** [**Marissa Zappas Honey Rose**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Marissa-Zappas/Honey-Rose-77567.html)  
Love Kills was a rollercoaster. The opening is harsh and metallic, with something almost like mint at the end of each inhale. After a while, it settles into a deep-red rose with hints of lipstick, airy and not at all cloying. As it goes on, it remains beautiful and mysterious and edgy. Rosy and hazy and green and prickly. If I huff deeply I get the tiniest bit of soapiness that I actually really enjoy. Unfortunately, after a few hours it picks up a sweaty note - still a rose, but like, if rose had stinky feet. Honey Rose opens with glorious ruby red rose glitter, but dries down into a powerfully animalic honey so intense that I was genuinely worried it could attract bears. **Winner: Love Kills**

[**Marissa Zappas Annabel’s Birthday Cake**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Marissa-Zappas/Annabel-s-Birthday-Cake-71850.html) **vs** [**Initio Atomic Rose**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Initio-Parfums-Prives/Atomic-Rose-57587.html)  
There is a very nice rose note in Annabel’s Birthday Cake that prompted me to include in this playoff, but on re-sniff this still is primarily a cake scent. A very good one, but not what I’m here for. No problem, because it’s up against a heavyweight: Atomic Rose, which I already have gone through a bunch of samples and am basically just hoping for a good reason *not* to get it. I shouldn’t love this huge fake plastic basic bitch vanilla party rose as much as I do, but I do. **Winner: Atomic Rose**

[**Jusbox Siren & Sailors**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jusbox/Siren-Sailors-53042.html) **vs** [**Aerin Rose Cocoa**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Aerin/Rose-Cocoa-56979.html)  
Siren & Sailors started off so promising: juicy, deep, syrupy, and - what's this? Smoked meat? All of a sudden I am a rose-scented grilled hotdog. It meets it match in Rose Cocoa, which smells like if you could make tortillas out of rose petals. I can’t believe I have to make this choice, but rose hotdog seems like a much worse smell, so **Winner: Rose Cocoa**

[**Tiziana Terenzi Delox**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Tiziana-Terenzi/Delox-44357.html) **vs** [**Tom Ford Rose d’Amalfi**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Tom-Ford/Rose-D-Amalfi-71538.html)  
Delox is just SO sweet and syrupy and honeyed. It’s probably the best I’ve smelled in this rose-coffee-honey family, maybe because the coffee note is so mild. I liked it much more than Rose d’Amalfi, which gave me more heliotrope that rose or almond. **Winner: Delox**

[**Byredo Rose of No Man’s Land**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Byredo/Rose-Of-No-Man-s-Land-31931.html) **vs** [**Chasing Scents Weeping Rose**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chasing-Scents/Weeping-Rose-73357.html)  
Rose of No Man’s Land is surprisingly humid; from the notes I expected it to be spicier, woodier. It's like dried rose petals in a humid room with wood paneling. Sometimes I think it might be overwhelming, and then it floats away. I like it more and more as the drydown goes on. Weeping Rose is definitely rose and tea right away, but there’s something cold and vegetal too, like the smell of the veggies getting sprayed in the produce section at the grocery store. It is not unpleasant, but I don’t want it for me. **Winner: Rose of No Man’s Land**

[**Perfumer’s Workshop Tea Rose**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Perfumer-s-Workshop/Tea-Rose-5512.html) **vs** [**L’Artisan Parfumeur Arcana Rosa**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/L-Artisan-Parfumeur/Arcana-Rosa-9-40729.html)  
Tea Rose smells like a damp plastic rose on me, and there’s a sour note I’ve never gotten along with. Arcana Rosa has a cumin note that I’m not fond of, but I guess I don’t really love it or hate it. **Winner: Arcana Rosa**

[**Chloé Chloé EDP**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chloe/Chloe-Eau-de-Parfum-1733.html) **vs** [**Piper & Perro Bud**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Piper-Perro/Bud-72705.html)  
Chloe EDP is a pretty, light, watery rose with a tough of soapiness. An office rose, not a date rose. It seems to sink into my skin very nicely and stick around intimately for a decently long time. Bud is intense winey, overripe apple opening that dries into sharpie markers drawing pictures of roses on hot city asphalt, soaked with steaming hose water. I hate it. **Winner: Chloé EDP**

[**Maison Martin Margiela On a Date**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Maison-Martin-Margiela/On-A-Date-78292.html) **vs** [**Royal Crown Al Kimiya**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Royal-Crown/AL-Kimiya-38236.html)  
On a Date is a wet, juicy rose - almost a gummy candy note, with fresh grapes at the opening. Al Kimiya certainly has a lush red rose in it, but there’s also a jasmine + oud note that smells ever so slightly rotted to me. **Winner: On a Date**

[**House of Bo Rosario**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/House-of-BO/Rosario-78779.html) **vs** [**Pearfat Bread + Roses**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Pearfat-Parfum/Bread-Roses-79998.html)  
Aside from its deeply offensive price, it’s hard to find anything to complain about with Roasrio, other than the fact that it’s a pink rose. It's very airy and light, and I feel like I struggle to smell it, but that makes it more endearing and ensures that it's not overbearing. It definitely has that fleshy, soft, petal-y quality that I like about rose perfumes but can't better describe. It's a very alive, clean, zesty rose. Tiniest bit soapy, in a pleasant way. I liked smelling Bread + Roses but both note were a little weak, and I don’t think I’d go out of my way to smell *yeasty* on the reg. **Winner: Roasrio**

[**Dries van Noten Soie Malaquais**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Dries-Van-Noten/Soie-Malaquais-72605.html) **vs** [**Kieren Rose Ink**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kierin/Rose-Ink-63365.html)  
Soie Malaquais is a clean rosebud with no leaves. It is indeed very silky somehow. A little bit soapy or shampooey, which makes me like it a little less. Rose Ink is exactly what it says on the tin - opens with an inky black vinyl, becomes a nice soft basic rose. No complaints, but it’s just okay. The rose is a little too light and musky, and I wish that ink stuck around a little longer. **Winner: Soie Malaquais**

[**Tom Ford Café Rose**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Tom-Ford/Cafe-Rose-2023-83771.html) **vs** [**Olfactive Studio Rose Shot**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Olfactive-Studio/Rose-Shot-54870.html)  
I don’t get any coffee in Café Rose, really - just a velvety red-black true rose. Over time, it gets a lot soapier and I don't like it as much. Rose Shot starts out offensively sour, then develops into something so interesting and multilayered and aggressively green and prickly. Oily strong neon pink rose, thorns and all, sunlight beating down on ten thousand of them in a field. It keeps shapeshifting, and turns into soap - the most beautiful soap, but soap nonetheless. It's clean and carved like a statue made of soap. I enjoyed this journey, and maybe I'd want to be in a fancy bathroom that smelled like this, but I don't think I'd reach for it often (or ever). **Winner: Café Rose**

[**Aerin Rose de Grasse Rouge**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Aerin/Rose-de-Grasse-Rouge-83474.html) **vs** [**Miss Dior EDP 2021**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Dior/Miss-Dior-Eau-de-Parfum-2021-68905.html)  
Rose de Grasse Rouge is a pretty red rose through and through. It’s pretty beastly - a single spray in my elbow seems to billow around me. Miss Dior is so generically floral I can’t even come up with better adjectives. **Winner: Rose de Grasse Rouge**

[**Maison Francis Kurkdjian Oud Satin Mood**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Maison-Francis-Kurkdjian/Oud-Satin-Mood-30352.html) **vs** [**Ouai Melrose Place**](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/OUAI/Melrose-Place-52552.html)  
Oud Satin Mood is the least-offensive oud I've smelled so far, but it's still oud. Intense and rich, totally makes me think of velvet-lined halls in some ancient palace. I get the jammy rose that people mention, but a lot of makeup-y powder too. I can't hate it because it's clearly very done, but I really want to hate it. Melrose Place is a powdery fresh clean floral shampoo. I don't get any rose from it, just a very pink, bright flower. **Winner: Oud Satin Mood**

1ikhl0s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unsent_Unread_Unheard/comments/1ikhl0s/a_letter_from_the_other_woman/,A Letter from the Other Woman,"To you,

I’ve thought about you a lot over the last three years. First things first, I want you to know that I didn’t know you were together.

I would see your name on his phone when we were together and he would ignore it, telling me you were his crazy ex. I even pushed him about it and he sincerely looked me in the face and guaranteed me that I was not acting as someone’s monkey branch. Even after you showed up that day, he assured me you were crazy and bitter and he had woven this story and gotten his poison so deeply in my brain that I let myself continue to believe it.

It’s interesting now, 3.5 years later, that I see how he did the same thing to me. He made you (us) feel crazy. He would tell us he was home, that he was tired, that he was working while really he was with the other person. And when your gut told you he was lying and you went yo check his house? Of course he wasn’t there. When you thought to check the place where he hangs out and found him with me and (understandably) were furious? Of course it can be spun as a crazy ex. But you weren’t crazy. He intentionally wanted you to feel insecure, to not know where to take your next step- and he made sure to set the scene for you to be just an obsessive, psychotic ex when you finally found the truth.

He did the same thing to me. But I didn’t know he was capable of that. He would stay out until the early hours drinking and then stumble home either angry or without any announcement at all. Sometimes he wouldn’t come home. I would ask, but that would be met with rage about how I’m controlling or boring or whatever. I was lied to regularly. I never thought he was cheating, though, I just thought he had an alcohol issue.

Until one day something within me told me to look. To look back two years and see if his story about you was true. Well, it wasn’t. He lied to us both.

In that moment, and in many moments after, I have thought of you. I wanted to know everything about you. I wanted to know if we were similar. How you and him started. How you ended. What he promised you about your future with no intention of following through- he said you were crazy and would mention how insane it was that you told him you wanted to marry him and have a family. But I bet he told you that he wanted that too. I told him the same thing and he told me he was on the same page, while he was already starting a new book (actually a couple of new books) and methodically erasing every line in my story to fit the narrative of “crazy ex.” Intentionally leaving out details. Refusing the answer the phone for long hours. Lying directly about things (things which would have given me both the freedom to leave and seek out real healing and relationships and the agency to decide what energy to put into the relationship knowing there was never any intention of a future). 

I wonder how much of this he did to you too.

But you know what I don’t understand- you and him have reconnected. He called you. I don’t know how much you talk. I know you call him a sweet nickname and you send songs back and forth and that you met for coffee.

Did you know he told me he wasn’t talking to you? Did you know he would delete your texts (when I asked he said he didn’t want your name to flash across his screen when we were together)? He told me he was cold to you. That he was establishing boundaries. When I found out that wasn’t he true, he told me it was my fault that he was seeking comfort in someone else- even though I was giving everything I had to save our relationship because he was telling me he wanted it while simultaneously he was treating me in increasingly cruel and abusive ways and blaming me for his addictions, his lies, his anger, his loss of employment, his mental health. But he promised he was working on it and wanted me, and I was so poisoned that I kept destroying myself.

And he was rekindling his flame with you the whole time.

Did you know I was still in the picture? If you did, did it feel like some revenge, some reassurance that you are better than me? I don’t think you’re evil, I think he is the most charming executioner to ever live and I could see him painting that picture for you. Did he tell you I was crazy? That I was so in love with him? That I couldn’t accept that we were not together?

If you didn’t know- can you not see the same signs? Sense that you might be standing on the other side of the same glass where you once looked 3.5 years ago?

Why would you go back to him? He left you for me and is now leaving me for you- although he never actually left either of us and instead turned us into ghosts with feral hearts losing themselves to the need for proof that the reality you force on us is not the truth and that the reality we know in our hearts and see with our eyes and puzzle together in our minds is really happening- because you tell us we’re insane and wrong when we have concrete evidence directly in hand.

How did he charm you? Do you believe him? I have grown to care for you. To fill in so many little details of who you are and, honestly, to care for you. I want to run into you. I want to reach out to you. But I know that would get twisted because, once again, you’re under his spell.

I hope the best for you. I truly didn’t understand what happened until far too long after the fact. I’m sorry for the hand I had in crushing your heart and tearing up your mind- I was deceived and manipulated and I paid by losing so, so much of myself while acting in that role for 3.5 years.

I hope you see through him this time. I hope you one day know that I, in some weird way, care deeply for your well being and happiness. If it’s revenge on me for the thought that I knew about you and didn’t care- that is misguided and will leave you empty. If he told you that I was gone (I am now, but not when you came back 6 months ago) and he hit every note in the manipulator’s melody just right to make you feel a familiar emotion that he told you was love- I hope you can use the past to get away.

You deserve to be happy. You deserve someone who will be truthful about you and with you. You deserve someone for whom you are not only the first choice but the only choice. We both do. I wish you the best, and I am truly sorry.

How sustainable do we think this is?
I'm trying to nip an incoming flare in the bud before it snowballs. 
My worst symptoms that I can't stand is swelling. It makes my joints ache and not fit together properly, and its usually the first symptom to arise at the start of a flare, so I've been taking the maximum dose of Xyzal and Pepcid to try to calm everything down, and to treat symptoms (to prevent the snowballing they cause) I've been drinking two cups of coffee and a cup of black tea in the morning, and then two shots of espresso in the afternoon, and at like 6pm I'll eat a meal. Even when I'm feeling healthy I prefer to not eat in the morning, and am a coffee everyday person, but this is an extreme version of it. I explained this to my doctor, and she was completely unphased and said it made sense. 

It's absolutely working and making me able to go to work like normal, but my concern is that this doesn't feel like a very sustainable situation. I don't track it but I seriously doubt I'm getting a full days worth of food in that one meal. Maybe 1000 calories.
It also hasn't caused any drop in weight. Despite the diuretic effect of caffeine and barely eating, the number on the scale has stayed within a 2lb range of variation.
Could that mean I'm becoming more swollen at a similar rate to losing fat? Or that it's just doing nothing? Or that my body thinks it's starving, except it's only been a few weeks.

Anyone else do this? Science? Am I making bad choices, or does this make sense. How long should I keep this up before trying to intervene on my own intervention?",2,1738998098.0,MCAS,2,1.0,False

I lost him in the summer. Now that’s when I think about him most. I think about him when it gets hot. I think about him when our favorite waterfront bar opens again for the season. I think about him when I see young couples on the beach lifting their first child over the waves and how much he would have loved that. I think about him every day in this moment when I wake up in our bed alone.

When he wasn’t on call, we used to love spending the morning in bed. We’d talk about the week and laugh or lay there rotting, sending videos back and forth but never leaving our own feeds to open them. I do a lot of rotting by myself now. Most days I struggle to do anything else. 
Aside from drinking- that’s always part of the plan.
My alarm is going off again. I’ve lost track of how many times I hit the snooze button. The headache is really starting to take over so its time for me to make my way down to the kitchen for breakfast. I go by the door to the room that I never open in the hall and think about how I used to eat well. Now my morning menu consists of a glass of water, two amazon brand ibuprofen, and a dill pickle spear. Just enough to make my head and my stomach stop hurting.
I leave the kitchen and walk over to the navy drapes in the living room. Dark colors are always best for keeping the sun out. I pull them back and let it in and rub my eyes as they adjust to the change in brightness. Aside from my pounding brain the earliest parts of my day are always so quiet. I don’t know that who I am now could handle anything more.
Once the pocket door is all the way in the wall and latched, I go out to the backyard. I used to open both but now I only need enough space for me to get through. Where the yard ends there’s a stone wall and we covered it with ivy. He tried to talk me out of it because a lot of the people working the remodel of our home said they’d just be rat ladders, but I loved the way it looked so much. If it wasn’t for the landscapers, it’d all be terribly overgrown by now.
In the center of that wall is a gate, its big and it’s rounded at the top. We picked white oak because it was not only light and bright but resistant to salty air. I found someone online who did the prettiest designs with wrought iron and had them add the embellishments. They painted them white because I wanted it to feel elven, like the gate fell out of the pages of Lord of the Rings and if you went through it you’d go somewhere magical. It only leads to the beach now.
If you ask my brother about our finances he’ll say we got lucky but I know we worked hard. We met at school in Boston, neither of us had grown up too far outside of the city. Part of me thought we wouldn’t leave it. He studied to be an oncologist which ended up being pretty ironic. I became a pharmacist. I think that was one of the hardest parts of his battle. We’d both read his chart and know he was going to die. I remember looking at him in those doctor’s offices, and in those chemo chairs, and there was always someone else in those rooms with us. The silent knowing that he would soon be leaving me behind.
He worked as long as he could. I stopped not long after he finished his residency. We had a friend who was an engineer, a very smart man whose call I should probably return. He had this crazy idea for a sponge that would get hard or soft depending on the temperature of the water and he wanted to shape it like a smiley face. I thought it was insane until the first time I used it. We gave him half the money he needed to get started and now I’ve technically become a household product mogul as the company has grown. It feels meaningless knowing I’ll never be as happy as that sponge.
I guess this is my longwinded way of telling you that I don’t work. And that if you talk to my brother he’s wrong. I look back at the gate as my first tear of the day rolls down my cheek and wish so badly for the magic to come back. If this gate could really do what I wanted then it would lead me to a place where he is on the other side, it would take me right to him. But it will only take me to the sandy beach, where there’s one grain for every memory that we’ll never make together.
 
 
 
I’m drunk now. I’ve had probably six extra dirty martinis in a few hours. I hate them. They’re fucking disgusting. I only drink them because my warped brain thinks I should be suffering in order to make myself feel good. I should be.
I’m slumped over the bar in my favorite filthy dive, one of the few places in my town that stay open year-round. It’s called the Thirsty Clam. That’s what I used to call my sister’s vagina whenever we got in a fight in high school. She was a bit of a whore and its too easy to go for the low blows when you’re fighting with your sister.
The walls in here are shiplap obviously, which I hate. I think at one point they were some kind of awful green color but all the paint has chipped away with time. The walls are adorned with exactly what you’d expect to see in a coastal Massachusetts town. Its just a smattering of cheap looking seagulls, and buoys, and decorative lobster traps. Everyone in here with me, already drunk at this hour, is a lobster stuck in their own trap. Liquor tells me they’re beneath me, and so does money. My behavior shows that we are the same.
But they know me here. They take care of me. Mostly I think because they know what happened to me. The bartender’s name is Kristen. She could be 33 or she could be 45. It’s hard to tell her age but its really easy to tell that she used to love heroin. A lot of the people around here do. She’s something that I’ve started referring to as ‘gas station iced coffee hot’ in my head. She has a piercing under her bottom lip on the left side. One of those trashy looking silver balls that she pushes out with her tongue when she’s thinking. She dyes her hair too dark and she thinks low rise jeans and a cami constitute as an outfit even though no one else does.
She still has a pretty face but its tired and her eyes have seen a lot more than they should. She’s given up the worst of her vices and settles for stopping each morning at Cumberland Farms to fill a plastic tub with a little coffee, a ton of cream and sugar, and to get another pack of Newports.
I push the martini glass toward her as she’s walking by me, “lemme get another.”
She shakes her head when she should be shaking my drink, “I’m giving you one more and then you’re having a glass of water.”
I brush her off, I know what I need.
 
 
I’m coming to, I can feel myself being shaken. I haven’t opened my eyes yet but I can hear everything. I’m definitely still at the Thirsty Clam, and the personification of her is the one doing the shaking. I sit up fast and push her hand off me, “what are you doing here, Sarah?”
She responds with her usual incredulous tone, “picking you up, the same thing I’m always doing. Let’s go.”
“How did you even know I was here?”
She ignores me and speaks only to Kristen, “thank you for calling me, it’s a tough day for her.”
I can hear the smile on her raspy menthol voice, “anytimesweetie, we take care of our people here.”
I all but fall from the old wooden stool and start following my sister out of the bar. Even in my drunken stupor I feel stupid. And angry. I hate when people close to me see me like this. We don’t say anything on the walk to the car. In years past I would’ve made some remark about buying the car for her but she’s the one who manages all my finances. I don’t want to give her a reason to cut me off.
We’re in the minivan now. I never understood why she got something so mom-ish and frumpy with everything she has at her disposal. Car seats can fit in any vehicle on the road. She turns it on and starts driving. She’s not even looking at me, it’sobvious she’s pissed.
I open with an insult, “you should’ve gotten an SUV, this car sucks.”
She keeps looking at the road, “SUV’s don’t have automatic doors, its easier for me to get everyone in the car when I have a diaper bag and a thirty pound toddler.”
That silences me. I’d never thought of that. I’d never experienced that. I have never helped my sister get her kids in the car because I am too busy being a drunk. She has to help me in most of the time. I turn my body away from her and start looking out. She turns up the music when I see a text from my mother pop up on the reflection of the screen in the window. She’s probably thanking Sarah for everything she does, for having the strength she doesn’t. That makes me mad again, but I keep quiet until we get to the house.
Once the car is parked, I bolt out and say goodbye knowing full well she is going to follow me inside. I hear the car turn off and then my front my door close. I already have a handle of vodka out on the counter and I’ve just grabbed a glass.
Sarah sighs and shoots me a look, “there is no way you’re pouring another drink right now.”
I bark back, “why did you even come inside?”
She holds up the reusable shopping bags, “someone needs to make sure you don’t starve.”
I sit at the island and take a big swig of my drink. I watch her as she moves around my kitchen and puts everything away, wiping up left behind spills and crumbs on her way along. My cleaning lady only comes twice a week. I keep taking sips as I watch her look like I used to. Her long blonde hair is clean and shiny and held up neatly by an expensive clip. Her clothes aren’t wrinkled and she smells good and her nails are done. She’s someone you want to be.
She speaks to me while she faces the cabinet she’s organizing, “Jared’s mom would’ve liked to see you today. She waited for you at the cemetery, I thought you were going to get lunch.”
I cradle my forehead in my right palm, “can you not fucking say his name right now? Seriously.”
She sighs again, “I’m just trying to talk to you. I know you haven’t been going to your therapy appointments, I see the cancellation fee on your statements. You’re never going to feel better if the only people you’re talking to are your drinking buddies.”
I wipe another sip off my top lip, “you’re not my mom, alright? I’m fine. I don’t need mothering.”
She’s turned around now, leaning back against the counter. I can’t believe how casually she stands as she cuts me down, “who is going to take care of you if I don’t? Mom and dad won’t even talk to you when you’re like this. I can’t believe you’re doing this after everything we went through with Matt.”
I slam my hands on the counter, “jesus christ, Sarah? What the fuck is wrong with you? Can we just not fucking do this today?”
She looks down before looking back up again to meet my eyes, “I’m sorry, I didn’t come here to fight. I know you’re struggling;I just hate thinking about you being here alone all day and then being with dirt bags all night. Why don’t you just come over this weekend? We opened the pool, you can spend some time with me and the kids-
I throw my hand up and cut her off, “I don’t wanna see your fucking kids, they do nothing for me.”
She laughs and nods, “wow, okay, tell me then, what does it for you? What does it for you other than making a fucking fool of yourself all over town and drinking yourself to death? I shouldn’t even want you around my goddamn kids but I do,’ she starts to cry, ‘you’re a part of me, and whether you like it or not they’re a part of you too. But not when you’re like this. Y’know, in the beginning, everyone got it. If I went through what you went through I don’t know that I’d still be here. No one expects you to just magically be better, but its been four fucking years, Hillary. I do expect you to stop being a piece of shit.”
She storms out and I make another drink.
 
It’s dark now, I’m still fucking drunk. Obviously. Sarah did what she always does when she’s pissed at me and hid my phone charger. I don’t have time to look for it, not when so little of thisday is left. I’m in the kitchen again, doing what I should have done when my headache ordered me down here. Gathering the favorite things for us to share and putting them in the basket.
Its harder than it should be. I’m dropping things and my visionis doubling on and off. I’m not sure I have it all but I need to go. Time keeps running out. All I can hear in my head is the opening to that shitty fucking soap opera. I need to go.
The basket bounces against my body as I get on my bike and start pedaling up the driveway. This is a lot harder than it should be too. I get out on the sidewalk and the terrain starts to flatten. It allows me to steady myself enough on the bike to steal a few more sips on my voyage.
I’m not sure how long it took me to get here. Standing in front of another stone wall and another gate. This gate is fucking locked and I don’t have the key. I look at my watch and I only have 15 minutes left. I try lifting my bike over the wall and its too heavy. It falls out of my hands and knocks my basket and something falls out. I don’t pick it up.
I start digging my fingers and my feet into the wall of stone and climbing it. I hold the basket close to me. I need to keep everything else inside. I use what I have left and pull myself over the top. My choices cause me to lose my balance and I fall over onto the grass on the other side. Onto my back. Onto the basket.
I get up and see that its crushed, everything inside it unusable. This is the first time I see that my leg is bleeding where the pedal of the bike had scraped it. I start crying as I sway, looking down at my ruined gift, “I needed that.”
As I bring my hands up to cover my face, my watch slides down my wrist and I’m reminded of how quickly the sand is leaving the hourglass of today. I start running. It’s dark, I don’t have the flashlight of my phone to illuminate the way but I know it. I knew it the first time I came here and I’ll never forget it.
I run as fast I can, crying the whole way and breathing heavy. I can’t not see him today. Today of all days. I keep running, I keep running until I see him and fall on my knees before him. I cry as I read the words etched into his marble, “Jared Windsor, 4/13/1987-6/4/2019. He could save anyone.”
I wipe my cheeks, slurring, “I made it. I’m with you, we’re together,’ I look to my right and put my hand on the other marble slab next to Jared and allow myself to think of him for the first time that day, the little boy who never got to live in the room in the hall behind the door I never open, ‘we’re all together.”

I’ve thought about you a lot over the last three years. First things first, I want you to know that I didn’t know you were together.

I would see your name on his phone when we were together and he would ignore it, telling me you were his crazy ex. I even pushed him about it and he sincerely looked me in the face and guaranteed me that I was not acting as someone’s monkey branch. Even after you showed up that day, he assured me you were crazy and bitter and he had woven this story and gotten his poison so deeply in my brain that I let myself continue to believe it.

It’s interesting now, 3.5 years later, that I see how he did the same thing to me. He made you (us) feel crazy. He would tell us he was home, that he was tired, that he was working while really he was with the other person. And when your gut told you he was lying and you went yo check his house? Of course he wasn’t there. When you thought to check the place where he hangs out and found him with me and (understandably) were furious? Of course it can be spun as a crazy ex. But you weren’t crazy. He intentionally wanted you to feel insecure, to not know where to take your next step- and he made sure to set the scene for you to be just an obsessive, psychotic ex when you finally found the truth.

He did the same thing to me. But I didn’t know he was capable of that. He would stay out until the early hours drinking and then stumble home either angry or without any announcement at all. Sometimes he wouldn’t come home. I would ask, but that would be met with rage about how I’m controlling or boring or whatever. I was lied to regularly. I never thought he was cheating, though, I just thought he had an alcohol issue.

Until one day something within me told me to look. To look back two years and see if his story about you was true. Well, it wasn’t. He lied to us both.

In that moment, and in many moments after, I have thought of you. I wanted to know everything about you. I wanted to know if we were similar. How you and him started. How you ended. What he promised you about your future with no intention of following through- he said you were crazy and would mention how insane it was that you told him you wanted to marry him and have a family. But I bet he told you that he wanted that too. I told him the same thing and he told me he was on the same page, while he was already starting a new book (actually a couple of new books) and methodically erasing every line in my story to fit the narrative of “crazy ex.” Intentionally leaving out details. Refusing the answer the phone for long hours. Lying directly about things (things which would have given me both the freedom to leave and seek out real healing and relationships and the agency to decide what energy to put into the relationship knowing there was never any intention of a future). 

I wonder how much of this he did to you too.

But you know what I don’t understand- you and him have reconnected. He called you. I don’t know how much you talk. I know you call him a sweet nickname and you send songs back and forth and that you met for coffee.

Did you know he told me he wasn’t talking to you? Did you know he would delete your texts (when I asked he said he didn’t want your name to flash across his screen when we were together)? He told me he was cold to you. That he was establishing boundaries. When I found out that wasn’t he true, he told me it was my fault that he was seeking comfort in someone else- even though I was giving everything I had to save our relationship because he was telling me he wanted it while simultaneously he was treating me in increasingly cruel and abusive ways and blaming me for his addictions, his lies, his anger, his loss of employment, his mental health. But he promised he was working on it and wanted me, and I was so poisoned that I kept destroying myself.

And he was rekindling his flame with you the whole time.

Did you know I was still in the picture? If you did, did it feel like some revenge, some reassurance that you are better than me? I don’t think you’re evil, I think he is the most charming executioner to ever live and I could see him painting that picture for you. Did he tell you I was crazy? That I was so in love with him? That I couldn’t accept that we were not together?

If you didn’t know- can you not see the same signs? Sense that you might be standing on the other side of the same glass where you once looked 3.5 years ago?

Why would you go back to him? He left you for me and is now leaving me for you- although he never actually left either of us and instead turned us into ghosts with feral hearts losing themselves to the need for proof that the reality you force on us is not the truth and that the reality we know in our hearts and see with our eyes and puzzle together in our minds is really happening- because you tell us we’re insane and wrong when we have concrete evidence directly in hand.

How did he charm you? Do you believe him? I have grown to care for you. To fill in so many little details of who you are and, honestly, to care for you. I want to run into you. I want to reach out to you. But I know that would get twisted because, once again, you’re under his spell.

I hope the best for you. I truly didn’t understand what happened until far too long after the fact. I’m sorry for the hand I had in crushing your heart and tearing up your mind- I was deceived and manipulated and I paid by losing so, so much of myself while acting in that role for 3.5 years.

I hope you see through him this time. I hope you one day know that I, in some weird way, care deeply for your well being and happiness. If it’s revenge on me for the thought that I knew about you and didn’t care- that is misguided and will leave you empty. If he told you that I was gone (I am now, but not when you came back 6 months ago) and he hit every note in the manipulator’s melody just right to make you feel a familiar emotion that he told you was love- I hope you can use the past to get away.

You deserve to be happy. You deserve someone who will be truthful about you and with you. You deserve someone for whom you are not only the first choice but the only choice. We both do. I wish you the best, and I am truly sorry.

1ikha88,https://i.redd.it/3eqbiqei3vhe1.png,"Saturday, February 08, 2025 | Word of The Day ""Mindscape"" - Cultivating the Garden of Your Mind: What’s Growing in Your Mental Landscape? • [Click to Expand]","## Seeds of Thought: Nurturing Your Inner Garden for a Flourishing Life


If your thoughts were a garden, what would be growing in it right now? It’s an intriguing question, isn’t it? I mean, most of us don’t stop to think about our minds in this way. But the truth is, our thoughts are like seeds. Every single one of them has the potential to grow into something vibrant, or—if left unchecked—something invasive. Let’s pull on some gardening gloves and explore this idea together.

#### The State of Your Mental Soil  

Picture your mind as a stretch of earth. Maybe it’s lush and thriving, with flowers blooming in every corner. Or perhaps it’s overrun with weeds, making it hard for anything beautiful to survive. My own mental garden has looked like both at different times. For example, during a particularly stressful period in my life—let’s call it the ""endless email era""—my garden was mostly thistles and dandelions. Worries about deadlines and self-doubt were crowding out anything remotely positive.  

But here’s the good news: just like a physical garden, your mental one can be nurtured. You can tend to it, clear the weeds, and plant seeds that align with the life you want to live. It’s not about perfection—it’s about cultivating balance.  

#### Recognizing What’s Growing  

The first step is to take a moment and truly notice what’s growing in your mental garden. Are there vibrant sunflowers of gratitude standing tall? Or perhaps there are creeping vines of resentment winding their way around everything else?  

For instance, I remember a day when I found myself fixated on a minor argument with a friend. It was like a single patch of weeds had taken over the whole garden. I had to step back and ask myself: ""Is this where I want to focus my energy?"" The answer, of course, was no. But it took effort to redirect my attention toward the ""roses"" of our long-standing friendship instead of letting the ""weeds"" of one disagreement take over.  

#### Planting Seeds with Intention  

If you could plant anything in your mental garden, what would it be? Joy? Confidence? Resilience? Like any good gardener, you have to start with intention.  

Think about the seeds you’re sowing every day. When you choose to practice kindness, even in small ways—like holding the door open for someone or offering a smile—you’re planting seeds of connection. When you set aside time for self-care, you’re nurturing seeds of self-worth.  

A personal example: a few years ago, I started a gratitude journal. At first, it felt like another thing on my to-do list. But over time, those tiny daily entries—""I’m grateful for my morning coffee,"" or ""I’m thankful for the sound of rain""—grew into a deep-rooted habit of finding joy in the ordinary. Today, that journal feels like a flourishing corner of my mental garden.  

#### Weeding Out Negativity  

Of course, not all thoughts deserve to stay in your garden. Some are like weeds, draining energy from the more valuable plants. Negative self-talk, fear of failure, grudges—these are the types of growth that can choke out the good stuff if left unchecked.  

Weeding your mental garden doesn’t mean pretending the weeds don’t exist. It’s about acknowledging them and then deciding they don’t get to take up space anymore. For me, mindfulness has been a powerful weeding tool. When I catch myself spiraling into negativity, I pause, breathe, and gently guide my thoughts elsewhere. It’s not always easy, but every time I do it, I’m clearing space for something better to grow.  

#### The Seasons of Your Garden  

It’s worth remembering that every garden goes through seasons. There will be times when your mental garden feels bare, like winter, with no blooms in sight. Other times, it will burst with color and life, like spring.  

When my father passed away, it felt like the winter of my mental garden. For months, all I could see were the barren patches of grief. But eventually, tiny shoots of hope began to appear—memories of him that made me smile instead of cry, moments when I felt his presence in unexpected ways. Those became the seeds for a new season of growth.  

#### Tending Your Garden Together  

Here’s the thing about gardens: they thrive best with a little help. Sometimes that help comes from friends who remind you of your strengths. Other times, it’s a therapist who helps you identify the weeds you didn’t even know were there.  

I once confided in a close friend about how overwhelmed I felt at work. Her response was simple but powerful: ""You’re more capable than you think."" That small seed of encouragement grew into a renewed sense of confidence that helped me navigate a tough project.  

#### Expanding the Garden  

Once your mental garden is thriving, you might find yourself wanting to share its beauty with others. Maybe it’s through acts of kindness, volunteering, or simply being a source of positivity in your social circles.  

Think of it like planting wildflowers. The seeds you scatter—encouragement, compassion, understanding—can take root in someone else’s mental garden. Imagine the ripple effect if we all did this.  

#### Reflecting on Your Garden Today  

So, if your thoughts were a garden, what would be growing in it right now? Would you be proud to show it to others? Or would you feel the urge to apologize for the mess? Either way, remember this: every garden, no matter how overgrown or neglected, has the potential to bloom again.  

Your mental garden is a reflection of your inner world, and like any gardener, you have the tools to shape it. With patience, intention, and a little help, you can create a space that’s not only beautiful but also a source of peace and joy.  

Now, let me ask you: what seed will you plant today?

I realized a lot of things I hadn’t noticed before: •	Junseo seemed genuinely interested in Youjin but lost interest after seeing her vibe outside Paradise. I think he’s completely moved on. •	He’s not just trying to match Youjin with others—he does the same with Minseol, as if he hopes she explores other options. •	He keeps admitting he’s inexperienced with women and often asks, “How do you do this?” since the beginning 🤣. •	The pool scene was cuter than I remembered! Sian was the only girl there, which felt significant. •	I’m even more convinced that Sian & Junseo’s feelings are real and unexpected for both of them. •	Sian has been into him since he confessed (hair straightening moment), but even before that, during their coffee date, she was clearly interested. They just misunderstood each other. •	Junseo likes her too but seems scared of his own feelings. His hesitation on Date 2 felt like him realizing, “Wait, can I really choose this fast?” He keeps mentioning how pressured he feels by the show’s context. •	Their second date wasn’t that bad in hindsight—he was just exhausted. It felt more like a real couple navigating a misunderstanding. •	He’s just bad at expressing himself (e.g., “If you’re done eating, shall we go?” was actually about her being cold 😅). •	I don’t think they were jealous of JeongSu & Youjin—they seemed more focused on each other. Sian talking only about Junseo after Paradise shows where her mind is. •	Their conversations feel deep, like they’re seriously considering a relationship rather than just going with the flow for TV. •	They both acknowledge their differences but still seem drawn to each other. •	Junseo regretted not opening up more on Date 2 and admitted that talking about Minseol caused confusion. He seemed genuinely lost.

I don’t know who she’ll choose, but I have to admit I really like their relationship.

What do you guys think?

Can’t wait to see the next episode, and then finally move on with my life without these strangers occupying my brain 🤣.

The sky had darkened with thick clouds, casting the city in a muted gray.

His instinct stirred again—stronger this time, sharper.

Someone’s watching.

Raven slowed his steps, his eyes flicking across the street, scanning for something out of place. The crowd was thinner now, pedestrians moving with purpose, heads down against the chill wind.

But there was no mistaking it.

He wasn’t alone.

He kept walking, his posture relaxed, but his senses stretched to their limits. The buzz of his instinct grew louder, almost insistent. Not a threat—yet—but a presence. A constant hum just beneath reality’s surface, hidden but waiting to pounce.

At the next intersection, he glanced over his shoulder, catching a fleeting glimpse of a figure across the street. Cloaked in a dark coat, head bowed beneath a hood.

The same man?

No. This one was different—smaller, lighter on their feet. Whoever they were, they disappeared into the alley before Raven could get a closer look.

His instincts tugged again, but this time they urged caution.

Not yet.

Raven exhaled, his breath visible in the cold air. He wouldn’t chase shadows. Not until they revealed themselves fully.

He turned down another street, his eyes catching on something strange—a slip of paper fluttering in the wind, pinned against a lamppost.

It shouldn’t have stood out, but his instinct surged the moment he saw it.

He crossed the street and snatched it from the pole, his eyes scanning the faded ink. A swirling symbol—the same sigil from the alley—drawn in precise lines. Beneath it, a single word was written in an unfamiliar language.

He traced the edges of the symbol with his thumb, a chill running down his spine.

“Coincidence?” he muttered to himself. Not likely.

As he folded the paper and slipped it into his pocket, his instinct shifted again, a new pulse of energy threading through him.

It wasn’t over. Not by a long shot.

He walked away, the sigil heavy in his pocket, the wind picking up around him. This was no longer a game of subtle hints and whispers.

The city itself seemed to breathe with anticipation.

And Raven had a feeling he was about to meet the next piece of the puzzle.

The symbol lingered in his mind long after it had vanished from the wall. Raven Veyrin leaned against the cold brick of the alley, his breath steady but his thoughts racing. The city around him moved on, oblivious, but something felt irreversibly changed.

He traced the memory of the swirling sigil with his thoughts, each line burned into his memory with uncanny clarity. There had been a meaning in its design—something ancient, something deliberate. But what?

The man’s words echoed in his mind. It’s time.

Time for what? Raven didn’t believe in destiny, but this… this felt different.

He pushed off the wall and walked back into the street, his steps slower than before. The crowds were thinning as morning edged toward midday. The shadows shrank, but the air still felt heavy with something unseen, as though the city itself was holding its breath.

His instinct wasn’t pulling him anymore, but it remained restless, buzzing faintly in the background. Watching. Waiting.

Raven hated waiting.

He turned a corner and slipped into a narrow café on the edge of the district, its windows fogged with steam from the brewing coffee. The bell above the door chimed softly, and the smell of roasted beans washed over him like a calming tide.

The barista, a young man with tired eyes, glanced up. “Back again?”

Raven nodded, offering a faint smile. “The usual.”

As he waited, his gaze drifted toward the window. The city stretched out before him—familiar yet distant, as though something had shifted beneath its surface, unseen but undeniably present. His instincts stirred again, faint but insistent, like a whisper in the wind.

The coffee arrived, and Raven took a slow sip, savoring the warmth. His mind kept circling back to the alley.

The symbol. The man. The words.

None of it made sense. But that was what intrigued him the most.

He glanced at his reflection in the window, his eyes narrowing slightly. He would figure it out. He always did.

And whatever lay at the end of this new thread of fate, Raven Veyrin would be ready to meet it head-on.

>Reading research papers and writing publications

__Reading research papers__

start reading, a lot. Pick one topic from your course. go to google scholar and search that topic. Pick one paper. Read the introduction, then results then conclusion. If you found it interesting, read the methodology and the the rest of the meat. Dont get hung up on any one thing that you dont understand. Preferably, download zotero and the browser plugin and log the paper along with some notes about what you thought about the topic/paper. Then find another paper and repeat. You can find another paper through google scholar or through the references of the previous paper.  You can access papers through university provided login or pirate through scihub. 

__Writing publications__

having done the first half, compile your notes and identify any gaps in the field. search for more online research to fill those gaps. If you cant find it online, take your notes and references to a professor and sit with them for an hour and discuss. If you've put in the work, professors will engage and help you. It would also be helpful it you went to a professor with a topic that they've already spent time working on, find out their research background. 

>__useful skills as a fresher__

these are sometimes very different than research and publication prowess. Go to the linkedin or other job boards of companies (preferably startups) and log all the skills they require for their new hires. Build projects that would require those skills. Don't spend time learning only the skill, spend time building a project that uses the skill. Go to subs about engineers in your domain and ask for specific advise. Keep a log of your project progress in a word document with screenshots and pictures along with reasons for doing what you did. Very important to be able to tell your story in interviews. You'll forget what you did and therefore an explanation of your project that could have been 20 minutes will end up being just 10. The progress and pitfalls are your story. Make a record of them. Find other engineer's personal project blogs and maybe make your own. Don't spend time learning how to built it if you don't know, pay someone ~500INR to build yours. 

All this is general advise and i hope someone benefits from it. Don't depend on campus recruitment, connect with engineers companies directly at companies based on your project, what that means is do advanced projects, send linkedin messages to engineers asking for help with very specific things. Do it a few times and it'll get easier. Ask for maybe a 20 minute meeting and even have a presentation ready if your explanation needs that medium, but the theme is asking for help and advise.

1ikgxbp,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Escape_to_Entrance/comments/1ikgxbp/116/,1/16,"I must remember, I am only being returned to the void from whence i came. A void of knowing that I am wholly unfit for any kind of relationship. And i'll pull that up around me, a cold blanket of certainty, as the nightmares assail my dreams as I try to sleep each night. 

I know the broken parts of me will never fit with another human in a deep, meaningful, and sustainable manner. I tried, I tried to ignore, I tried to push through, I tried to better myself in so many ways I can no longer count them all. But at the heart of it all there are no saviors. The inane quotes of bedroom philosophers and top of the bell curve therapists only make me feel worse as I read their words of effortlessness when the right person is found and see in them only the emptiness inside. That's an idiom for others, not one for me.

I can pick holes through the justification she gave, over all the years, but at the core of it I wasn't wanted. Blamelessly, I should add, how could anyone stay with this?  And even if she doesnt put it as succinctly as that, I can. So why feel anger over what I feel were fabricated reasons? The truth is the truth. She can mend the pieces I broke in the sweat and sheets of another, but in those for me there is only much of the same. For my pieces werent broken by her, they just simply werent healed. 

I can decorate the absences of those I've lost however I wish, distractions and rote aspects of living, but they will be felt regardless. I can fall down the hole of various self-destructions, but that is only the slow knife on a wrist. And just more distractions already attempted, no saviors there either. 

I need to accept there is no hope for me, but in lieu of it I have what I've always had. A simple pushing in the dark, to keep going in spite of, to keep going in spite of me. Some may argue that man can not live through such alone. But there is no living, only dying at a later point. And spite will be enough, for now.  

So go on, let go of what you once hoped and remember. That there are few happy endings in this world, and none for you in particular. Accept it, let her find her happiness. Drink your coffee, clean your things, read your books, for you there is simply going on another day. ",1,1738995793.0,u_Escape_to_Entrance,0,1.0,False

You'll forget what you did and therefore an explanation of your project that could have been 20 minutes will end up being just 10. The progress and pitfalls are your story. Make a record of them. Find other engineer's personal project blogs and maybe make your own. Don't spend time learning how to built it if you don't know, pay someone ~500INR to build yours. 

All this is general advise and i hope someone benefits from it. Don't depend on campus recruitment, connect with engineers companies directly at companies based on your project, what that means is do advanced projects, send linkedin messages to engineers asking for help with very specific things. Do it a few times and it'll get easier. Ask for maybe a 20 minute meeting and even have a presentation ready if your explanation needs that medium, but the theme is asking for help and advise.

Young adults are starting more and more unique online and offline businesses. Someone's selling cheesecakes while someone's selling candles. Jewellery, event management, clothes to coffee shops, you name it, we have it. 

There should be a community/group for these young business owners to collaborate, converse and learn from each other. I, being a new business owner myself, would love to hangout with like minded people.

Do these kinds of communities already exist? Ya banale hum hi?",4,1738995247.0,jodhpur,6,0.83,False

The foods I’m most curious about that we don’t get much in San Diego are Jamaican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Dominican (Latino/Caribbean influence). Asian is always good (Vietnamese has been subpar here so far), but I hear yall have great Chinese and I wanna see how Korean food fairs. Open to all recommendations food/drink/coffee/pastries.
