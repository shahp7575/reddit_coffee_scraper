I feel so tired of everything, and I don‚Äôt want to kill myself but I don‚Äôt want to keep living either. The idea that I will have to carry this trauma forever, it‚Äôs memories and it‚Äôs long term effects on who I am is just too much. I hate my body, and I hate my mind. The one person I want to reach out to is my mom, yet she was my abuser and it would only bring me more harm. I was isolated from family and friends my whole life, so even though there are a few people who probably really do love me, I can‚Äôt bare to reach out to them. I‚Äôm so afraid of upsetting them and/or being rejected. I don‚Äôt want to spend my entire life punching a clock and working for someone else. I want to feel valued and wanted, and not so tired all of the time. Living a life where I am mentally damaged, physically unfit, constantly being treated like shit and feeling tired from work, and not even being able to move up in life and accomplish anything despite my efforts is all too much. I‚Äôm in therapy, and it‚Äôs harder to talk about things as an adult than it ever was as a teen. I have a job as a CNA, and I‚Äôm about ready to quit. To me, no amount of money is worth the experience of being in intense pain after my shift being barely able to walk, having to be disrespected by my superiors, have residents hit and scratch me, clean piss and shit, and then I get to watch people in their misery as they slowly die in front of me. I‚Äôm in college to try to make a life for myself but I struggle so hard with avoiding my homework and procrastination plus perfectionism and the thoughts of ‚Äúwell if I don‚Äôt do a good job why try at all‚Äù. Then I have a problem with my sleep, where I either don‚Äôt sleep enough or I sleep too much. This created a huge imbalance where I am more and more frequently sleeping through my appointments, class, and shifts. I‚Äôm watching myself ruin my life and I know I should keep trying but I really want to just throw in the towel and stop living. I want to just close my eyes and never wake up. But then I know there are things that I don‚Äôt want to give up. I don‚Äôt want to give up on laughing with my friends when things are good. I don‚Äôt want to give up on the idea that I might one day make it and be able to have my dream job and a stable and comfortable home, and the ability to travel and see the beauty of the earth. I don‚Äôt want to miss out on all the kisses I give to my two cats. I don‚Äôt want to miss out on new music, movies, or new games. I just feel like I‚Äôm never gonna make it. I feel like I‚Äôm embarrassing myself for even trying. I live in a small leaky trailer, my car is totaled and I don‚Äôt have money for a new one. Even when I am working full time, I can barely afford groceries or anything else. Sure I could stop buying coffee. I could not buy weed. I could not spend money on little things that I enjoy, but I can‚Äôt see the bigger picture. I know it‚Äôs true that frugality and saving will make a difference, but in the moment I‚Äôm never able to see how being frugal and saving will benefit me in the long run. I‚Äôm about to be two months late on rent, and my phone bill is overdue, and now extremely high. I have almost zero self discipline, I constantly chase instant gratification, and I know all I do is make excuses for myself. Which then makes me feel like the biggest idiot ever because I‚Äôm shooting myself in the foot, realizing it hurts, and then doing it again. I genuinely don‚Äôt know how to fix my life. I don‚Äôt have the energy to even wash my dishes. I just don‚Äôt want to keep participating in this rat race. I know life isn‚Äôt easy, but it‚Äôs a game that I‚Äôm not interested in playing anymore. I‚Äôm feel like I‚Äôm just a weak and entitled person. My therapist says I‚Äôm not, and that it‚Äôs understandable because of everything I am still healing from. I feel so at war with myself and with the world and any words of encouragement would be appreciated. 

Also I‚Äôm sorry about the flow of my writing, it was a brain dump. ",1,1734955935.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

Selling off my game collection to pay for life. You will see a good few new games added to the list. I have everything listed out by console. I am open to a full buy out, I have buyout numbers for each console below - Every single price is OBO, so please make offers if you're interested. Worst case scenario is I say no. Pricing does not intrinsically cover shipping, however if you pick up over 50$ worth of stuff I generally either split or take over the shipping cost.

With the bigger stuff, CE's etc. we can figure out the shipping cost and work out a deal there. Especially for the Death Stranding CE. That bear is going to be...interesting to ship.

Thank you so much for your time.

-------------------------------------------------

If you're searching for a brighter smile in San Diego, CA, you're in the right place. Teeth whitening options are plentiful in this sunny city, where a confident smile can make a lasting impression. Whether you're gearing up for a special occasion or just want to boost your everyday appearance, understanding your choices can make a significant difference. Here are some of the best methods for teeth whitening available in San Diego.

### In-Office Whitening Treatments

For those looking for immediate results, in-office whitening treatments are a fantastic option. Professional dentists use stronger whitening agents that can lighten your teeth by several shades in just one visit. This method is not only effective but is also closely monitored by professionals to ensure safety. Here are some advantages of in-office whitening:

- **Quick Results:** See dramatic improvements in just one appointment.
- **Professional Supervision:** A trained dentist ensures proper application and reduces the risk of side effects.
- **Customized Treatment:** Treatments can be tailored to your specific dental needs.

### At-Home Whitening Kits

If you prefer the convenience of whitening at home, consider at-home whitening kits. San Diego dentists often provide these kits that include custom-made trays and gel. Here‚Äôs why they can be a great choice:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Flexibility:** Use them on your own schedule, making it easy to integrate into your routine.
- **Personalized Fit:** Custom trays help ensure the whitening gel covers your teeth evenly.
- **Cost-Effective:** Generally, at-home kits are more affordable than in-office treatments.

### Over-the-Counter Products

How to Maintain Your Bright Smile After Teeth Whitening
-------------------------------------------------------

After enjoying your freshly whitened smile, it‚Äôs important to maintain that brightness for as long as possible. Teeth whitening in San Diego, CA, can work wonders for your smile, but your habits after the procedure play a significant role in how long the effects last. Follow these tips to keep your teeth looking vibrant and healthy.

### Eat Carefully

Your diet can have a big impact on the brightness of your teeth. Here are some key points to remember:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Avoid Staining Foods:** After whitening, try to limit your intake of foods and drinks that are known to stain teeth, such as red wine, coffee, and dark berries for at least 48 hours.
- **Choose Teeth-Friendly Foods:** Incorporate crunchy vegetables and fruits like apples and carrots that can help scrub your teeth naturally.
- **Hydrate with Water:** Drinking plenty of water can help wash away food particles and reduce staining. Aim for at least 8 glasses of water a day.

### Maintain Good Oral Hygiene

Keeping up with oral hygiene is essential after whitening treatments. Here‚Äôs how to maintain a healthy routine:

- **Brush Twice Daily:** Use a soft-bristled toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste. Focus on your technique to ensure all surfaces of your teeth are cleaned effectively.
- **Floss Daily:** Flossing removes plaque and food particles that your toothbrush can‚Äôt reach, helping to keep your smile bright.
- **Use Mouthwash:** Limit the use of mouthwashes that contain dyes or alcohol, as they can contribute to discoloration. Opt for a whitening mouthwash instead.

### Regular Dental Visits

Schedule regular check-ups with your dentist for professional cleaning and advice on maintaining your bright smile. Here‚Äôs why these appointments are crucial:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Professional Cleanings:** Your dentist can remove any stains that brushing alone may miss, ensuring your teeth stay as white as possible.
- **Evaluate Your Whitening Progress:** Your dentist can help you determine whether a touch-up or another whitening session is needed.
- **Oral Health Monitoring:** Regular check-ups allow for early detection of any dental issues that could affect your smile‚Äôs appearance.

### Consider Touch-Up Treatments

For some people, maintaining a bright smile may require occasional touch-ups. Here are your options:

- **At-Home Whitening Kits:** Discuss with your dentist about safe at-home whitening options. These kits can help maintain your results without needing to return for more treatments.
- **Over-the-Counter Products:** Select whitening strips or pens can be used regularly to keep your teeth bright. Ensure these are approved and gentle on enamel.
- **In-Office Treatments:** If stains begin to reappear, a visit to the dentist for a professional whitening session can restore your shine quickly.

### Quit Bad Habits

Some habits can contribute to teeth staining and discoloration. Consider these tips:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Avoid Smoking:** Tobacco can greatly stain teeth. If you smoke, consider quitting to protect your smile.
- **Limit Sugary Snacks:** Eating sweets not only promotes decay but can also lead to discoloration. Choose healthier alternatives whenever possible.
- **Use a Straw:** When drinking stain-causing beverages, use a straw to limit contact with your teeth.

### Be Mindful of Your Beverages

Your drink choices can play a huge role in maintaining your teeth's brightness. Here are some tips:

- **Opt for Clear Beverages:** Clear drinks like water or white tea are less likely to cause staining.
- **Rinse After Consumption:** After enjoying something that could stain your teeth, rinse your mouth with water immediately.
- **Limit Acidic Drinks:** Drinks high in acidity can wear down enamel, making it easier for stains to set in.

With these practical tips, you can enjoy a bright smile long after your teeth whitening treatment in San Diego, CA. By taking care of your oral hygiene, making smart dietary choices, and addressing habits that could harm your teeth, you can keep your smile looking its best.

1hkm6gt,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1hkm6gt/does_akka_superbiotics_really_work_my_experience/,Does Akka Superbiotics Really Work? My Experience,"Hey Reddit,

I wanted to share my journey with **Akka Superbiotics** and give an honest breakdown of what I experienced. This isn‚Äôt a sales pitch‚ÄîI‚Äôll be as transparent as possible about both the pros and cons. If you‚Äôre dealing with issues like stubborn belly fat, fatigue, or digestion problems, this post might be helpful.

# What Exactly Is Akka Superbiotics?

Akka Superbiotics is a supplement designed to support liver health and improve gut function. It focuses on a probiotic called **Akkermansia**, which is apparently a game-changer for metabolism, fat loss, and overall detoxification. I first heard about it while researching ways to deal with constant bloating and low energy.

The unique thing about Akka is its use of ""Preserve Pasteurized"" Akkermansia, which they say is better for the gut than live probiotics. It‚Äôs also packed with ingredients like **Quercetin**, **Resveratrol**, and **Silymarin**, which have been shown to help with inflammation, fat burning, and liver regeneration.

# Why I Tried Akka

For years, I struggled with unexplained weight gain and fatigue. Even after improving my diet and trying every workout plan under the sun, I still felt sluggish and bloated. A friend recommended Akka, saying it had helped them feel lighter and more energized.

I wasn‚Äôt expecting a miracle, but I was curious if it could help with my specific issues.

# My Experience With Akka Superbiotics

Here‚Äôs how things unfolded for me:

**Week 1-2**  
Not much happened during the first two weeks. I did notice slightly less bloating after meals, but it was subtle. I almost stopped taking it, thinking it wasn‚Äôt doing anything, but I‚Äôm glad I stuck with it.

**Week 3-4**  
This is when I started to feel real changes. My energy levels improved noticeably, and I wasn‚Äôt crashing in the middle of the day like I used to. Bloating reduced significantly, and my digestion seemed smoother overall.

**Month 2 and Beyond**  
The biggest surprise was the shift in my cravings. I wasn‚Äôt reaching for sugary snacks as often, which felt like a huge win. I also started losing a little weight‚Äînot a dramatic amount, but enough to make me feel better about myself. The best part was feeling less fatigued and more focused throughout the day.

# What I Loved About Akka

* **Improved Digestion**: The bloating I‚Äôd been dealing with for years is now almost non-existent.
* **Steady Energy**: I no longer feel like I need multiple cups of coffee to get through the day.
* **Fewer Cravings**: My sweet tooth has definitely taken a backseat.

# What Could Be Better

* **Price**: Akka isn‚Äôt cheap, especially if you commit to the 3- or 6-month supply.
* **Results Take Time**: If you‚Äôre looking for quick fixes, this isn‚Äôt it. It took about a month for me to really feel the effects.
* **Not a Standalone Solution**: Akka helps, but it‚Äôs not a replacement for eating well or staying active.

# Should You Try Akka Superbiotics?

If you‚Äôre dealing with bloating, fatigue, or stubborn weight, Akka might be worth exploring. It‚Äôs not an instant fix, but over time, it did make a difference for me. That said, it‚Äôs not a magic pill‚Äîyou‚Äôll still need to put in the work with your diet and lifestyle.

If you‚Äôre curious and want to learn more about Akka, here‚Äôs a link to a [**detailed guide**](https://dailywellnesscare.com/pages/dwc-akk-tsl?_ef_transaction_id=&oid=22&uid=33&oid=22&affid=80&source_id=&guaffid=8928&guoid=1041&uid=2376&guoid=1041&guaffid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HealthProductsNatural).

# Final Thoughts

Overall, I‚Äôd say Akka Superbiotics is a solid option for people who‚Äôve tried everything else and still feel stuck. It helped me feel lighter, more energetic, and less bloated, which is exactly what I was hoping for.

It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúone-size-fits-all‚Äù product, though, so your mileage may vary. If you‚Äôre willing to be patient and pair it with healthy habits, it might work for you too.

I was extremely anxious and horrified seeing all of the stories. What I'm about to say doesn't apply if you have allergies obviously but hopefully it will help:

- I took multivitamins before I started using it (Not every day, every other day). They had Zync in it which I think helped since Cipro apparently prevents your body from absorbing vitamins, zync and magnesium. Not sure about vitamin absorption but it is not allowed with Cipro so take them beforehand anyway.

- I had sleeping issues so I took magnesium every night beforehand so I think that helped, too. After 48 hours of being done with Cipro, start taking magnesium immideately. I will start with 3in1.

- Never consumed caffeine and anything with lactose while taking it (THIS IS IMPORTANT) (For coffee, wait for a day at least after you're done)

- Sleep as much as you need!!

- Don't eat anything that might upset your stomach BUT eat your protein. Remember, your muscles might get weaker. In fact, I will buy protein powder now that I'm done with Cipro.

- DON'T DO HEAVY EXERCISE! Don't strain your muscles for at least 6 months. However, don‚Äôt let your muscles weaken either. I will start with light exercises and no dumbells, nothing heavy for 6 months.

- Unless necessary, don‚Äôt take additional drugs. I even stopped taking my allergy pills and sometimes pushed through headaches. I think this drug tends to not mix well with other drugs. Take stomach pills though. It upsets the stomach.

I struggle with anxiety now, more than in my 20's. I'm 197cm (6 feet 6 inches), I'm going to the gym and besides a 6-pack I have a nice body, I think I'm above average in terms of beauty otherwise, I work remotely with decent pay. I moved to a new city and I have huge problems initiating contact with new people, especially women.

I noticed that my hands shake, when I try to smile (e.g. when approaching a woman) my cheeks shake, and if the tension is too much I have a migraine, I noticed that my voice is shaking and that my speech is less clear than when I was younger, I'm not able to speak clearly at the right volume and right pronunciation. I also noticed that in general is hard for me to find words.

All of that hurt my confidence a lot, to the point that for a while I was avoiding people, I never took anything but propranolol, just when needed. But it sks man, if I go to a party or group of new people, I have all kinds of shaking happening and it just makes me feel weird, then like a migraine happens and my mind is just blank, same when approaching women tho I'm trying, really trying to not care about the outcome.

I wonder what I could take to ease the symptoms, it would help me a lot in fighting anxiety and feeling somewhat normal. Also if you know what medical path I should take, I am open to anything.

The tipping point for me was 2 days ago, I was a bit tired and had a coffee, then at the gym,  my hands were shaking badly, a man with who I started having a good relationship joked about it and I took the joke good but it hit me hard.

Then on my way home, I saw a beautiful woman, I approached her, and chatted a bit, even if my voice was shaky she agreed to give me her number so I took off my phone, but I just couldn't hit the right freaking keys lol, then she said ""On the second through I don't really know you"". - She rejected me and that felt awful man.

I'm tired of fking victim mentality. I want to do something about it. There must be some solutions for essential tremors and the anxiety that it is often associated with. Thank you!",2,1734953540.0,EssentialTremor,0,1.0,False

Anyways, I've realized that I'm super sensitive to everything and I need to eat better. Since I started fasting, drastically reduced carbs, and cut out sugar and dairy, I feel great. I have no more crippling anxiety, just moderate ""my head hurts and my mind is racing a bit"" anxiety. It's like a 4/10 instead of 14/10 which is manageable.

I've quit alcohol, nicotine, most of my sugar intake, artificial sweetners (aspartame almost drove me insane like alcohol), and now caffeine.

I don't drink milk anymore either because it fucks with my stomach which triggers intense anxiety in me.

I just want to have a damn decaf americano, ffs. Give me SOMETHING besides soda water, FFS.

Today, I had one and immediately felt a bump of anxiety and a rush of anxious thoughts smashing against the inside of my forehead. There were some depressing and sad thoughts mixed in too followed by a crash and now I feel again like the burnt butt of a cigarette.

Tomorrow I'm going to have a decaf cappucino with oat milk instead of regular milk. If that gives me anxiety, I'm not really sure what I'll do.

I'm guessing that if the coffee beans are strong to begin with then decaf can still have 3-5mg of caffeine, which apparently is enough to make me anxious.",1,1734953460.0,Anxiety,3,1.0,False

The CAP Measurment showed 255, which should be mild to moderate fatty liver. However the Fibroscan measured 6,0 kPa. Doctor Said I have mild scarring. On the Letter He send me with the Diagnose it is written, that the measurments validity is 100%. Blood values (GPT, GOT, Gamma-GT, Alkaline Phosphatase, Thrombozytes) everything withing the Norm. However I read so many things about Fibroscan and that Sometimes it can be unreliable. I continued drinking for one month straight before finally I quit! I know this was stupid, but I am stupid. Now I am so anxious. Can't sleep at night. Take Xanax to calm me down and feel constipated. Sometimes very dark Urine. Could be because I Drink a Lot of Coffee but I also read about liver Problems and dark Urine. I found Out that Coffee should be good for the liver thats why I Drink a Lot.

The first dealt with an establishment in Japan. Apparently gambling isn‚Äôt permitted in Japan, and this establishment was using a system whereby the player would win valueless trinkets that could be used to exchange for actual items at a nearby store. This obviously was contrasted with skins and CS, and explained the loophole that Valve uses to exclude case openings from gambling restrictions.

Another interesting observation was that Valve‚Äôs X-Ray workaround for France is a strategy directly borrowed from casinos: the ability for customers to see the results of their initial slot roll, but having to invest if they wanted to attempt the follow-up roll.

Curiously, Coffee also obtained an interview clip regarding the CS dev team. The interviewer asked them for comment on how gambling affects the player base and growth of the game. The devs pretty much stumbled over their words and gave each other subtle cues to not over-speak. One of the devs took up the question and deflected, as was to be expected. Coffee discussed this clip, and the alleged lack of data claimed by the Valve dev. Earlier he also discussed Valve‚Äôs employment of experimental psychologists and drew comparisons/conclusions.

Coffee concluded by explaining that Valve have the power to create adequate restrictions to prevent gambling, and provided examples of how they‚Äôve already done so and how they‚Äôre the ones most equipped to get rid of underage gambling, and explained how their failure to act could be because they either don‚Äôt want to compromise profits or because they just don‚Äôt care to get involved.",1,1734952643.0,csgomarketforum,0,0.6,False

As the video title says, ""You'll thank me later"". I would like to thank Tom for taking me down the rapid hole and spending thousands of euros over the last few months, and for spending hours and hours in front of my computer screen trying to optimise my espresso shots. I really didn't like the taste of coffee before our new DeLonghi machine, it had to be 20% coffee and 80% oat milk. I have transformed into a wannabe ""expert"" espresso shot taster, with pinky finger raised, attempting to articulate every sensation that my palate experiences to my partner. Who knew 'bitter' came in so many different flavors? Yeah, still working on my shots though I feel that this morning I finally managed, with the help of the Breville Dual Boiler and all the input and advice from this forum and Youtube, to pull a shot that tastes almost delicious. And this wonderful shot is what motivated me to make this post, probably my firsts post ever on Reddit.

Rebounding is a fun, extremely healthy exercise for all ages that anyone can do in the comfort of their own home.

Just what is rebounding?

It's one of the newest forms of personal fitness that is quickly becoming popular for its affordability, effectiveness, and general appeal. Unlike normal trampolines a rebounder is a mini-trampoline that individuals use for personal fitness as well as fun. It has been associated with¬†[muscular growth, reducing arthritis pain, detoxification, quick weight loss, cardiovascular health, lymph node flushing and more](https://www.needak.com/rebounder-health-benefits#2736).

Read on to find out more about rebounding and how it can help you!

**Dynamic**

Rebounding provides a full body workout with minimal cost, space and time. It involves jumping on a rebounder and can extend into many different exercises and exercise routines. Rebounding can be as simple as walking or as vigorous as a fast paced aerobic, high energy workout. Some of the more popular rebounding exercises include:

* Slow paced jumping
* Fast paced jumping
* Walking
* Jogging
* Rebounder-style sprinting
* Star jumps / jumping jack jumps
* Cross country ski jumps
* Knee raise jumps
* Side twists
* Scissor jumps
* Alternating feet jumps
* High jumps
* Seated bounce
* Abdominal crunches
* Bicycle crunches
* Step-ups

**Practical**

In addition to the dynamic uses a rebounder provides, it's a very practical tool. It takes up roughly the same space as a small coffee table, requires very little maintenance, can be folded away or stored in the closet and used by children (with supervision),¬†[adults and the elderly](https://www.needak.com/exercises-for-seniors-and-elderly#2736). A high-end rebounder like the¬†[Needak](https://www.needak.com/rebounder/339/soft-bounce-folding-rebounder-black#2736)¬†can be used in apartments without concern of waking neighbors due to low noise, rubber floor leg tips and the impact absorption of both the mat and springs. For those customers that may have balance issues, you can get the optional¬†[Needak stabilizing bar](https://www.needak.com/rebounder-accessory/288/stabilizing-bar#2736)¬†which easily attaches to every Needak rebounder.

You can get a full cardiovascular workout with a Needak rebounder in about twenty minutes without leaving your room. And when you're not using the rebounder, you can easily fold it away (for the foldable versions) or lean it against a wall where it takes about as much floor space as a shoe-rack.

**All-in-One**

In terms of time and money, creating a home gym or purchasing gym memberships that often go unused can lead to wasted investments and feelings of frustration. Given that you can jump on a rebounder, run on it, stretch on it, recreate a variety of movements that would otherwise require several pieces of equipment and also create personalized workouts using a minimal amount of space, a rebounder can be a money, time and space saving decision.

Ever wondered why you can sometimes snag a flight to the Sunshine State for the price of a fancy coffee? We're diving deep into the factors that contribute to those jaw-dropping deals, exploring everything from seasonal lulls to airline competition. So, buckle up, because we're about to uncover the secrets behind cheap Florida flights!

Why Are Flights to Florida So Cheap? Unveiling the Mysteries of Budget-Friendly Travel
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We all dream of escaping to Florida's sunny beaches, vibrant theme parks, and lush everglades, but sometimes the price tag can feel like a barrier. Luckily, there are often deals to be found. But *why*? What magical forces align to make these flights so affordable at certain times? Let‚Äôs break it down.

### The Seasonal Seesaw: Supply and Demand in Action

Imagine a rollercoaster; that‚Äôs basically Florida‚Äôs tourism season. Peak season, like summer and major holidays, sees prices skyrocket as families flock to the state. However, during the shoulder seasons (spring and fall) and the off-season (typically summer's dog days), demand dips. Airlines, left with empty seats, often slash prices to incentivize travel. It‚Äôs a classic case of supply and demand. Think of it like buying strawberries ‚Äì they‚Äôre cheaper when they're in abundance.

### Competition is King: The Airline Price War

Florida is a hotbed for airline competition. Multiple carriers vie for passengers, leading to price wars that benefit budget-conscious travelers. Legacy airlines, low-cost carriers, and even ultra-low-cost options are duking it out, which can drive down prices significantly. It's like a Black Friday sale in the sky!

### Hubs and Spokes: The Network Effect

Florida boasts several major airport hubs, like Miami, Orlando, and Tampa. This dense network of airports means more flight options and, consequently, more opportunities for competitive pricing. These hubs act like central distribution points, allowing airlines to offer connecting flights at cheaper rates. Think of it as a well-oiled machine, smoothly transporting passengers to and fro.

Why Are Flights to Florida So Cheap? A Deeper Dive into the Dynamics of Airfare
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, we‚Äôve touched on the basics, but let's delve even deeper into the factors influencing airfare. What other secrets are hiding in plain sight?

### Fuel Prices: The Volatile Factor

Jet fuel prices are like the weather ‚Äì unpredictable and constantly changing. When fuel prices dip, airlines can offer cheaper flights. Conversely, when fuel prices soar, airfare often follows suit. It‚Äôs a delicate balancing act that airlines constantly grapple with.

### Hidden Fees: Beware the Fine Print

While some airlines advertise incredibly low fares, it‚Äôs essential to be wary of hidden fees. Baggage fees, seat selection charges, and even change fees can add up quickly. Be sure to factor in these potential costs when comparing flight prices. A seemingly cheap flight can quickly become pricey if you're not careful.

### Timing is Everything: Booking Your Flight Strategically

Like catching a wave, timing is crucial when booking flights to Florida. Booking in advance often yields better deals, especially during peak season. Conversely, last-minute deals can sometimes pop up for those willing to take a gamble. Flexibility is key! Being open to flying on weekdays or during off-peak hours can also unlock savings.

Why Are Flights to Florida So Cheap? Exploring the Role of Budget Airlines and Travel Hacks
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, let‚Äôs turn our attention to the role of budget airlines and some clever travel hacks that can help you score even cheaper flights.

### The Rise of Budget Airlines: Shaking Up the Industry

The rise of budget airlines has been a game-changer for affordable travel. These airlines offer no-frills flights at rock-bottom prices. By stripping away extras like complimentary meals and in-flight entertainment, they can keep costs down, passing the savings on to passengers. It's perfect for travelers who prioritize price over pampering.

### Travel Hacks: Unlocking Hidden Savings

- **Be flexible with your travel dates:** Shifting your departure or return by a day or two can sometimes lead to significant price differences.
- **Consider flying into smaller airports:** While less convenient, flying into a smaller airport near your destination can often be cheaper.
- **Use flight comparison websites:** Websites like Kayak, Google Flights, and Skyscanner can help you compare prices across multiple airlines and find the best deals.
- **Sign up for airline newsletters:** Stay up-to-date on flash sales and special promotions by subscribing to airline newsletters.
- **Clear your cookies:** Believe it or not, clearing your browser cookies can sometimes prevent dynamic pricing and help you snag a lower fare.

### The Impact of Economic Fluctuations: A Ripple Effect

Just like the tide, economic conditions can impact flight prices. A downturn in the economy can lead to decreased demand for travel, which in turn can push airlines to lower prices to attract passengers. Keeping an eye on economic trends can provide insights into potential travel bargains.

### The Power of Packages: Bundling for Bargains

Bundling your flight with a hotel or car rental can often result in significant savings. Travel agencies and online booking platforms frequently offer package deals that are cheaper than booking each element separately. It‚Äôs a convenient way to simplify your travel planning and save money at the same time.

### Mileage Programs: Reap the Rewards

Joining airline mileage programs can pay off in the long run. Accumulating miles can lead to free flights, upgrades, and other perks. It's like earning frequent flyer points ‚Äì a little reward for your loyalty.

Conclusion: Soaring to Florida on a Budget

Why are flights to Florida so cheap? Well, it's a confluence of factors, from seasonal fluctuations and airline competition to fuel prices and travel hacks.

After some time using an aluminium Bialetti, I‚Äôve switched to a stainless steel Bialetti Venus, which I really like.



I got the perfect coffee down and have used every day at least once.



However, that little grudge on the side drove me crazy. No matter how I cleaned it, there was always some residue of coffee.¬†



After some research I found that the Giannina moka pot fits the bill: Solid construction, no grudge on the upper part and (apparently) makes great coffee.



Now to the questions for the Giannina experts:

* I‚Äôm used to removing the gasket for cleaning, there is almost no way I can do that without additional tools (and sometimes even destroying the gasket). The Bialetti Venus was also tough at the beginning but then eased up, will the same happen with the Giannina?
* What's the perfect ratio for a 3/6 coffee, using a medium roast coffee? So far, my go-to numbers were \~19g of coffee and 200ml of water in the Bialetti. Here the ratio seems a bit off (I've used less water on the 3 cup version).  
* I'm prepping it on a ceramic stove with a setting of 1-6, on 2.5 (always did it with the Bialetti to ensure steady flow) but it seems the flow is a bit fast?
* Aeropress Filter users: where do you put the filter? In the Bialetti it fit perfectly but with the Giannina it only stays when I actually wet it a bit and stick it directly onto the filter, any tips?
* This part is super sharp, normal? I can also grind it a bit, but just want to be sure it‚Äôs to be expected. I think this is completely round on the restyled version, can anyone confirm?

1hklf3g,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hklf3g/i_36f_need_advice_on_how_to_avoid_resenting_my/,"I (36F) need advice on how to avoid resenting my husband (36M). I'm struggling with feelings of resentment over a variety of things. How do I fix this for my mental health? Also, how can I improve our relationship when I'm not allowed to communicate with him?","I'm new to Reddit (I read and don't post, lol). However, I've been forbidden from talking to people in my life as it's ""inappropriate"" to discuss relationship problems with anyone. I don't think my husband is on Reddit, and I am at my wit's end tonight and don't know what to do. I'll try not to give too much detail so the post doesn't get too long, but I make no promises. I'm not trying to bash my husband. He is a good man. In some of these situations, I feel like I portray him in a negative light. I want to make it clear that I am not explaining my struggles to bash him in any way, but because I feel like I need to explain the issue if I am to get good advice on how to change my feelings and cure my resentment. 

TLDR: I'm struggling with feelings of resentment towards my husband. It's not good for my mental health, and I don't know what to do. I'm looking for practical advise to help me change my mindset and feelings.

I think I've reached the end of my rope tonight. My baby has been awake since 11 PM (it's now 230AM, and she's just starting to go back to sleep). I've done everything - gel, Tylenol, and teething crackers - so please don't judge me. After an hour of her sobbing while we cuddled in her bed, I changed tactics and we watched The Nutcracker on TV while I laid in the big lazy boy with her. I rarely let her have screen time, but I'm exhausted and desperate. Here's the start of my frustration. I drank a pot of coffee while we watched The Nutcracker because I was horrified of falling asleep in the big rocking chair with her. If hubby naps with her in the chair, it is ""cute daddy-daughter napping."" He naps in the chair with her most weekend afternoons. If I fall asleep in the chair with her on my chest (which happened one time) or even half snooze (anyone who's been up most of the night with a newborn after working all day likely understands the hazy nodding off state you can be in), he accuses me of trying to kill our daughter by not practicing safe sleep. Before we had her, we agreed that I would take all of the nighttime needs as he has to drive an hour to work, and I only have to drive 15 minutes. Also, I do better without sleep than he does. I don't resent him for being awake at night with her. She is a good sleeper overall and has only gotten up for a 1 AM bottle most nights for the last few months. But on nights like tonight, I despise the double standard of him napping in the chair with her for hours most Saturdays. I can't nap with her in the wee hours of the morning when she needs her momma to sleep without risking being accused of not caring about her well-being, endangering her life, and being an uncaring mother. I may be too touchy, but those accusations hurt my feelings so badly, I will do almost anything to have those kinds of things never yelled at me again. 

This kind of segways into another resentment I'm having tonight - showers. He gets to wake up and take a shower or come in from outside and take a shower without thinking twice about where the baby is or if she's being taken care of - literally, no second thoughts. Last year, shortly after she was born, I had put her down to bed. She was snoozing soundly, safely swaddled, had her Owlet on, and I had her baby monitor and phone with me in the bathroom. I took a five-minute shower. I'm not exaggerating, I scrubbed my body and hair as fast as I could and got my butt out of the shower in case she woke up and needed me. I got out and as soon as I opened the door I ran into my husband, who had woken up to use the bathroom. He jumped down my throat about how I was trying to kill our daughter because what if she needed me while I was in the shower and how irresponsible it was of me to be in the shower while she was asleep and he didn't understand how I could care so little about the child I said I love. I love her so deeply. She's my little miracle baby. I was stunned. I tried to say, careful to stay calm, that I thought she was safe as she was fed with a fresh diaper, safely swaddled, had her Owlet on, and I had the baby monitor with me. .Also, I was as fast as I could possibly be. He made mean comments about how I didn't care about her welfare and how I clearly didn't care if she lived or died as long as I got a shower. After what seemed like forever of listening to his concerns, I couldn't control myself and started crying. He demeaned me for this, telling me I was so overly dramatic and now I was just pretending to be a victim. I can count on one hand how many showers I have taken in the last year. I wash my hair in the sink, and I have gotten quite good at cleaning myself in the kitchen by standing on a towel and scrubbing my body down using a washcloth and the kitchen sink. It's not ideal, but it gets me clean. I miss the feeling of the shower, water running over my head, the warmth, the comfort. I hate shaving my legs in the bathroom sink. I resent that he can take a shower pretty much whenever with zero concerns and I am terrified even just washing my hair in the sink and sponge bathing. I'm not terrified she'll suffer some awful accident in her sleep while I wash my hair because I have the Owlet and an audio/video baby monitor; I'm terrified he will wake up and yell at me. 

I am not able to do indoor chores while he is home and awake because it makes him feel like cleaning the house and doing chores is more important than him; the same goes for outside chores. I want to respect his feelings. Especially since he sat me down calmly to tell me this. He didn't yell it during one of our ""fights."" I put ""fights"" in quotes because that's what he calls it when he yells at me for hours on end, and I say very little as I know he won't hear me, and I don't believe in engaging in a yelling fight as it's not productive and doesn't solve anything. I used to believe an argument couldn't happen if one party refused to engage, but that's clearly a wrong belief. He believes he does half of the chores even though he only does maybe 5% of them. He takes care of the cats most mornings, including replacing the bag in the litter robot, and takes out the trash more often than me. Since we moved into the house two years ago, he has never cleaned the bathroom, even if he says he will do so, and I leave it until it's too gross for me to accept. I did this twice, left it for him since he said he would do it, and both times, when I couldn't take it anymore and cleaned it, he made snarky comments about how I finally cleaned the bathroom. He vacuums maybe once a month and has swept the floors maybe three or four times in the last year and a half and he got mad I didn't give him enough praise after he did so. I did say thank you and write him a thank you note and an appreciation text. He recently yelled at me because I ""get to the chores before him and then wash dishes at 4 AM and that's a stupid time to wash dishes"". Yes, I didn't do dinner dishes after dinner as it took a while to get the baby down to bed, and I fell asleep next to her bed - it happens. It's way easier to make breakfast and lunches and sterilize my milking equipment in an empty sink, so yeah, I have a tendency to wash the previous day's dishes between 3 and 4 in the morning. I have to leave the house by 7:15 and baby usually wakes up by 6. I have to have breakfast ready and lunches for my husband and daughter packed by 6:30 and I need an hour to take care of bare minimum outdoor chores on the ranch. Chores go faster if I do them before baby wakes up, which means being outside no later than 5 AM. Ideally, a bit sooner so I don't have to rush so much to prepare breakfast for baby and me (maybe me) and breakfast, lunch, and coffee packed for my husband. He yelled at me for hours a few weeks ago because I accepted his offer to help me with outside chores as I was in a hurry to leave on a work trip. I asked him to not help with chores two years ago as I couldn't stand the constant complaining. He asked for a fresh start with that, and since I agreed to that I let him help. One of the hoses was frozen. I said I would have some friends check waters at 9 when it would be well above freezing and he lost it. He yelled at me about how I shouldn't own animals because I don't care if they live or die (what the heck, I've stayed up in the barn countless nights nursing a baby animal to health) and how dare I ask friends to check on something I should have gotten done since they are my animals and not theirs (I live in a farming community and friends and neighbors help each other). He yelled at me for cleaning the house late at night or early in the morning, he yelled at me for taking care of the animals late at night and early in the morning, he yelled at me for not staying up on the big outside chores that aren't daily necessities (like cleaning manure out of pens). I finally had enough and argued back. I told him I couldn't meet his unrealistic expectations. I work from 7:30 to 3:00 most weekdays at my part-time job and work on the weekends and the late afternoons or evenings at my full-time job. If I'm not allowed to do chores on when he is home, when and how am I supposed to stay up on any of the chores. It's hard to clean manure in the dark and I need to sleep sometime. I work 60 to 80 hours a week, and the primary care-giver of out daughter, and I run a small ranch. I told him I leave the house 15 minutes after him, get home an hour and a half before him at best and in that hour and a half I have to take care of animals and cook dinner while working on whatever other chores I can cram in while entertaining my daughter. It was probably wrong to argue back, but I don't understand when he thinks I can clean pens and how I am going to get all animal and household chores done if I can't do them when he is home and awake. 

Anways, to the point. He was gone on a guys trip the last three days. It was amazing! I got so many loads of laundry done, got so much work done outside over the two weekend days, and unpacked several boxes that have been waiting in the laundry room to be unpacked from moving into the house and slept in until 5 AM on Friday. I vacuumed and swept and mopped after my daughter went to bed and I went to bed by 11 at night. I got 6 hours of sleep two nights in a row! Now, I'm facing two weeks with holidays. I was so excited because the schools are closed for two weeks. I was picky about how much freelance work I accepted so I could work on big projects before we get into the single digits. Rebuild a pasture fence, strip all the pens, and unpack the boxes left in our house are my three big goals. But, he is home two days in the middle of the week for Christmas Eve and Day and New Year's Eve and Day. I don't mind Christmas Day as we are going to family, and it will be a fun day, but experiencing the freedom and peace of taking care of things without the stress of worrying about my husband was way nicer than it probably should have been. I find myself resenting and dreading that he will be home three extra days over the next two weeks because I could get so much done if he was at work, and it was so wonderful while he was gone. My daughter was safe at all times while I worked outside. She was either in the special baby backpack or happily playing in the playpen or her walker within four feet of me. I always meet her every need immediately when she comes outside with me and I have confirmed with caseworkers I am friends with that bringing a child outside with you while you do chores is not abuse or neglect if you are taking care of their needs and keeping them safe. I'm just clarifying this because he has yelled at me about how I am trying to get her taken away by health and human services by bringing her outside with me and I don't know how common of a feeling that is in the world, and I don't want anyone fearing for her safety. How do I get rid of that feeling of dreading him being home extra? I don't like it. I feel guilty and icky about it. I feel selfish about it. I know it's not ok to wish he had to work while I have off so I can get stuff done. He deserves time off, too, especially during the holidays. I wish he would go out with friends or on a trip or almost anything other than stay at home and I hate that I feel that way. I know these feelings aren't healthy, but I've never felt these feelings before, and I don't know how to change them or get rid of them. I'm worried it will be hard to pretend to be happy on his vacation days when I am already resenting him being home, and therefore, I have so much I could do that I won't get to touch. 

I don't want to wish he wasn't home extra. I don't want to resent him. How do I change my perspective? I think I'm too tired and overwhelmed to see the solution and get over myself. 

I am so sorry for the long, drawn-out post. The details were important to me so I knew there was context. I'm hoping for ideas that I can implement before the holidays. Thank you in advance for any helpful advice!

After spending 2 months with the Hinomi H1 Pro V2, I can confidently say this chair punches well above its weight. I‚Äôve been through a lot of office chairs (including the iconic Herman Miller Aeron and the somewhat disappointing Autonomous ErgoChair Pro), so my expectations were pretty low. But this chair? It‚Äôs surprisingly impressive. It doesn‚Äôt scream ‚Äúluxury‚Äù like a $1,000 chair, but it definitely gets the job done in style.



Let‚Äôs talk about the mesh seat first‚Äîit‚Äôs breathable, so goodbye sweaty back. This is huge for me because I‚Äôm the type to overheat just looking at a warm cup of coffee. The seat‚Äôs firm but comfortable enough for a full day of sitting (I‚Äôm talking 6-8 hours). It‚Äôs not plush, but it‚Äôs not like sitting on a hard bench either‚Äîjust the right amount of support. Assembly was a breeze, too. It took me about 15 minutes, which is a miracle compared to the two hours I spent putting together a bookshelf from IKEA once (who knew the instruction manual was actually important?).



**Comfort & Ergonomics:** 

This is where the Hinomi H1 Pro V2 really shines. The lumbar support is adjustable, which is great if you‚Äôre the type who needs that extra bit of back love. It‚Äôs not a back-massager by any means, but it‚Äôs definitely supportive. The backrest is comfortable for someone like me (5'10""), but I could see how shorter people might feel like it‚Äôs a bit off. The seat height adjustment is smooth, but I do wish it could go lower. My legs like being flat on the ground, and this chair doesn‚Äôt quite get me there, but that‚Äôs a small thing.

Honestly, the adjustability here is a game-changer. You can tweak everything: seat depth, armrest height, headrest. The headrest surprised me‚Äîdidn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd use it much, but it‚Äôs been great for those ‚Äújust five more minutes of napping‚Äù moments. The recline lock, though, is a bit finicky. It doesn‚Äôt lock perfectly, and there‚Äôs a slight rebound when you lean back. It‚Äôs not a huge deal, but if you‚Äôre the type who wants to lock your chair at a precise angle, it might annoy you.

**Comparisons to Other Chairs**: 

When compared to the Autonomous ErgoChair Pro and the Herman Miller Aeron, the Hinomi H1 Pro V2 holds its own. The ErgoChair Pro always felt a little flimsy to me, especially in the backrest, and let‚Äôs be real‚Äîthe Aeron is overpriced unless you have money to burn. This chair strikes that sweet spot between affordable and functional. It‚Äôs not going to give you that $1,000 luxury vibe, but it definitely performs better than most budget chairs.



**Drawbacks to Consider:**  

\- Foldable Design: Sure, it folds, but how often do you really need that? I folded mine once, just to see if it worked, and then never again. It‚Äôs a cool feature, but don‚Äôt expect to fold it up every time you‚Äôre done working. 

\- Seat Depth: If you‚Äôre on the shorter side (under 5'5""), the seat might feel a little too deep. It‚Äôs not a dealbreaker, but it might not be as comfortable if you‚Äôre not the right height. 

\- Weight: This chair is a little heavy, so don‚Äôt expect to be carrying it around solo. If you‚Äôre assembling it by yourself, it‚Äôs a two-person job for sure.



**Conclusion:** 

All in all, the Hinomi H1 Pro V2 is a great chair‚Äîespecially considering the price. It‚Äôs not trying to be fancy, and it doesn‚Äôt need to be. The mesh seat keeps me cool, the adjustability options are top-notch, and it‚Äôs just overall a really comfortable chair. Sure, it has a few quirks (like that pesky recline lock), but for the price, I‚Äôm willing to overlook them. If you're looking for a solid, budget-friendly chair that won‚Äôt leave you aching after a long workday, this one‚Äôs a keeper.



\---



**Pros:**

\- Great adjustability (seat depth, armrest height, headrest)

\- Breathable mesh seat‚Äîno more sweaty back

\- Solid build quality for the price

\- Surprisingly comfy for long hours



**Cons:**

\- Seat depth might be too much for shorter individuals

\- Recline lock has a bit of a rebound

\- Armrests could use more padding

\- A little heavy‚Äîcould use some help during assembly

Forgive me for not being as well versed in specifics, I truly love my degree and everything I‚Äôve learned over the past four years but I don‚Äôt really have anyone in my life that is knowledgeable about anything career related, much less careers in economics, as a first generation minority student. But I am incredibly thankful for any and all input!

I‚Äôm a senior attending a prestigious women‚Äôs college about to graduate with a degree in economics and have found it incredibly difficult to decide what my next best move should be with my degree. I have a pretty low gpa (2.8) compared to all my peers in the same major, I know this because it‚Äôs a smaller school, and have felt pretty defeated about making it in the finance world from this. I also have adhd and have only recently been medicated, and found it to be incredibly helpful in my classes but I am graduating soon so this doesn‚Äôt really do much for recovering my gpa. I will still be doing my absolute best to raise my gpa next semester, my final semester, but it‚Äôs looking a little bleak. I don‚Äôt have any real preferences for careers, I enjoy the research portion of economics, econometrics, policy, consulting, financial statements, really anything and everything. 

I have no internship experience, but I have been the financial manager of a student run coffee shop on campus for about 3ish years and deal with all finance related duties. I have also worked 1-2 jobs all 4 years mostly as a barista and some time as a back office admin dealing with cash and excel. I have also just completed my senior thesis on labor economics in Mexico and love anything related to economics of latin America.

My questions are, 1) do I have a shot at getting an internship as a senior with no past internship experience, 2) should I try again and go to community college for an associates in accounting, or maybe even do an mba for econ? (Trying to make my resume somewhat redeemable after my crappy grades in undergrad) 3) if you had a bad gpa in economics, or started late on internships/a career in economics, what should I do to get my foot in the door?  4) should I give up on getting into the finance world and just try to shoot for something more realistic?

TLDR; Im a senior at a prestigious hwc, but have 2.8 gpa majoring in economics, no internships, only job experience in handling cash as a back office admin, customer experience, and am financial manager for 3ish years of a student run coffee shop. I am genuinely passionate about economics, and love everything I‚Äôve learned and really want to enter the finance world but genuinely feel defeated with a low gpa, comparing myself to other incredibly accomplished peers.
