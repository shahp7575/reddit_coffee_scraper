1kx0fjx,https://www.reddit.com/r/interviews/comments/1kx0fjx/second_interview_coffee_chat_after_a_vp_interview/,Second interview (coffee chat) after a VP interview at a big bank — haven't heard back in almost 1 week.,"I recently applied for a position at one of the big banks and, to my surprise, got contacted for an in-person interview pretty quickly. The first interview was at a branch and lasted about an hour with both a recruiter and a VP. The recruiter said I’d hear back in 3 weeks, but when he stepped out, the VP told me it would likely be closer to 2 weeks — so I figured I’d just wait it out.

But then the next day, I got a call inviting me to meet the **same VP again**, this time for an **informal coffee chat**. Recruiter mentioned the first interview was “only an hour” and that VP didn’t get to ask everything she wanted to. The following week, we met at a local coffee shop, and the vibe was much more relaxed. She asked me a lot of personal questions about my background and interests — not too much technical or role-specific talk.

At the end, she told me she still has two more candidates to speak with by the end of this week (it's Tuesday now, the coffee chat was on Wednesday of last week). Before we parted ways, she reminded me I have her email and said I could reach out if I had any questions.

Some context: I’ve only been working in banking for about 4 months, and this would be my first position in finance **outside of retail banking**. I’m a little anxious because I don’t have much experience, so I’m trying to read between the lines here.

If your story sounds even a little like mine, I hope this post can bring you something — clarity, comfort, or just the sense that you’re not alone. That’s why I’m sharing it.

I’m not healed. I’m not saying this is the end of my journey. But something happened recently that *broke* a loop I’ve been stuck in for almost ten years. A loop that stole my presence, my energy, and a big part of my life.

First, I was able to clearly identify my deepest fear: that unsettling sense of not being fully present — even though I was physically there. For years, I thought this meant I was dissociating during panic attacks, and that idea alone was terrifying to me — the thought of watching my life happen around me without being able to engage, to connect, to participate, and that for days, weeks, months. It was hell at some points.  
But recently, after a lot of therapy and deep introspection, I saw something I’d never realized before:

What I was calling dissociation was actually **hyper-focus**. I'm not saying dissociation doesn't exist — it absolutely does for many people — but in my case, it wasn't dissociation. It was something else entirely.  
Not an absence of awareness — but a tunnel of *intense* mental energy directed toward escape. Escape from the sensations, from the fear, from the possibility of panic.

And when I truly saw that clearly — *not just intellectually, but with my whole awareness* — something clicked.  
Suddenly, I didn’t need to manage or fix anything anymore. Because I understood that the act of “managing” was itself the source of the disconnection. And if you remember what I said earlier — that feeling of not being there — this was clearly the source of my fear. 

It was that simple, and that profound. And almost instantly, my entire internal state shifted. It was like a thick fog lifted — not because the sensations disappeared, but because I was no longer caught in the exhausting cycle of trying to control or avoid them.   
**If I stop trying to escape, my brain won’t be focused on escaping.**  
**And if my brain stops trying to escape, I’ll be present again.**  
The thing I feared the most — being gone, not being there — would no longer exist.

And when my brain understood that, it stopped. It stopped running.  
I didn’t force anything.  
It just didn’t need to run anymore.

And I was left with something surprisingly gentle:  
Just a body. Just small physical sensations. Just... me.

But here’s the part that really hit me yesterday:  
I realized that these physical sensations — tight chest, heart beating, chills — they’re **always the same**.  
Whether I’m in a calm state, slightly anxious, or in full panic — **they don’t change**.

What changes is what my mind *adds* on top:  
The fear, the urgency, the sadness, the confusion, the mental spinning: *“What’s happening? How do I stop this? How long will it last? I can’t live like this.”*

That’s what makes it unbearable — not the sensations themselves.

And when I stopped fueling that mental chaos — when I simply sat with my body, and let myself *just feel* — I saw how neutral the sensations really were.  
Sometimes even soft. Familiar.

I want to be super honest here though:  
This shift didn’t come out of nowhere.  
I’ve done **years of emotional work**: therapy, trauma processing, facing deep-rooted fears of abandonment, identity struggles, low self-worth… the whole mess.  
And once those parts had space to heal, what remained was the **loop**: the fear of fear itself.

And seeing that loop with clarity broke its power.

Another thing I want to say — because this might speak to someone out there — is that this all happened while I was in my **luteal phase**.  
This is the part of my cycle where I usually feel the most disconnected, the most anxious, the least present.  
It’s when I usually feel like I’m just surviving.

But even in that phase, I saw something:  
The sensations were **not stronger** than usual.  
They were the same. It’s my *mind* that usually makes them feel worse — by panicking, by trying to fix everything, by fighting the sensations instead of allowing them.

That’s when I realized:  
I was never actually accepting.  
I was just *fleeing differently*.

That part is huge, and I want to say it clearly:

People always say “don’t fight it, just accept it.”  
But what does that mean?

I thought I was doing that. But I wasn’t.  
Because I still did things like:  
→ Drinking water ""to flush the stress""  
→ Going for walks ""to lower cortisol""  
→ Avoiding coffee ""just in case""  
→ Washing my face with cold water ""because it helps regulate""

That’s **not peace**.  
That’s still **fleeing**. Just sneakier.

And so now, whenever I act, I try to ask myself:  
*“Am I doing this because I love it? Because it makes me feel alive?*  
*Or am I doing it to escape panic?”*

That shift — in intention — is everything.

I know everyone’s experience is different. This is just mine.  
But maybe, if your story is anything like mine, you’ve been stuck in this same loop without knowing it.

**I (F24) and my BF (M25) had a trip planned and the day before the trip he stops messaging me and then doesn't show up the next day to leave. Can you tell me what to do so I don't lose my mind?**

Hi. This is my first post, because I need people to tell me what to think right now. My bf and I have been dating for a little over 6 months, and we have both been really busy with work and his dad has recently been sick so we haven't gotten to see each other as often these last 5-6 weeks. So about a month ago we decided to plan a vacation during a national holiday that is going on right now. We both are early in our careers and don't make much but we decided to use a bit of savings and fly to a nearby country and have a beach vacation, stay in some hotels, swim and the lot. We've both been so excited for this trip. He's planned most of the general stuff, which days and times we should fly, he booked all the hotels ( we were going to go back and forth between some islands), and messaging me almost every day this week with weather updates and things we could do. I have been super busy with work but cut out some time earlier this week to make a more in depth schedule so we could make the most out of our vacation and to book some stuff for us to do to ensure we would have tickets. It was all going perfectly, we were both clearly excited and had spent a good amount of money. I know he already spent at least $1000 booking stuff, so he was very invested. Plus he is the one who initially came up with the plan and invited me.

Here's where the story turns. (Keep in mind our flight is at 9:10 this morning , the 30th, so we had loose plans to meet near my street and get a taxi at 7:30) Yesterday the 29th I have wifi issues at my apartment, so I don't get a ""good morning"" message. (When we first started dating I kind of found these a bit annoying but I've grown to love them so much, and I know it means a lot to him that I say good-morning back so i try my best to respond within a few hours) So I go to a coffee shop and see that he hasn't messaged me, which I find a little weird but I take the opportunity to be the one to say good-morning first (something I very rarely get to do since he works a 9-5 and I'm remote) and I get to work on my latest project and don't think too much of it. Then a little later I send him the latest ideas for our trip and ask if hes bringing any nicer clothes if we want to do a slightly fancier dinner one night. No response. This man is always ALWAYS on his phone, he responds so fast sometimes it gives me whiplash and its been hours and... nothing. But I know hes at work and I feel a little crazy for even thinking anything of it. I accidentally leave him for hours sometimes because I'm not as attached to my phone so its not a big deal if he doesn't respond quickly, but it is weird for him.

A few hours later I send him a booking confirmation. No response. I finish my work and go home. Then 5:30 rolls around, and I know he should be off work. I message him again and no response. An hour later I message again because I'm getting worried he isn't messaging back the night before our flight. No response. I call him a couple times and he doesn't pick up so by 7/7:30 I'm stressing out, and I walk over to his apartment (a 5 min walk from mine). His bike is outside his door but I knock for 20ish min, and NO RESPONSE. I'm trying to come up with excuses. Maybe he had to work super late? He's at dinner? His phone is dead or broken? I go home and just pack and go to sleep.

This morning still nothing. We planned to leave at 7:30, so I get ready as I would have and try calling him a few times. At 7:30 I go out to the street corner where we normally have met before and wait. To get to the airport in time to check in we have to leave by 8:00 at the absolute latest. I message and call him the whole time and NOTHING. At 8:01 I head to his apartment again. I'm pounding on the door, calling him, there is nothing, no response. His shoes are there that I can see, his bike outside unmoved from the day before. We have missed our flight, so I request a refund on the site while literally sitting against his door. (I miraculously got the refund BTW) and I cancel any bookings I made, all of which went through. So I'm super sad about missing our vacation but I wan to emphasize that I'm not mad about the money, I was able to get it back. I'm scared at this point.

He's been the perfect boyfriend, he brought flowers to my place when I got sick, he is always on time to pick me up for our dates, he plans things for us, we've never fought, I don't even think I've ever seen him annoyed with me, and I'm super annoying. The last time a saw him ( The 24th?) His last words to me were ""I love you"" like 3 times, and then when I left me messaged that he ""loved being with me"" and then later I got a goodnight message.

Cut to today and suddenly its radio silence. Nothing. I'm crying at this point and accept that he's probably not home or I would have hear him so I go home and just cry and get pizza and wine and message him approx. 100000000 times, and try to call and NOTHING.

I haven't met his family yet so I don't have their contacts, I've met a couple of his friends and workmates in passing but didn't think to get any of their numbers, why would I? I know the buildings where he works but not where his office is or the name of the company (its not my native language and names are really hard for me to remember so he might have told me but I forgot if he did), My point is that I have no way of contacting him. If he is in the hospital or something no one is going to think to call me.

It's the evening of the 30th as I'm tying this. I recently got back from his apartment again and his bike hasn't moved. I taped a message to his door to call me, and my contact info for anyone who goes to his apartment in case someone else might know what happened. I can't think of anything else to do and I'm terrified and crying constantly thinking the worst.

I'm trying to think of what could possibly be happening. He takes his bike everywhere but its outside his apartment unmoved. He spent a lot of money on tickets for this trip and then didn't show. Where I live you need your phone to use taxis and metros and such, and there are charging ports and repair shops everywhere so even if his phone died the 29th or broke it would be fine by now. My best idea is that there was some sort of family emergency? maybe with his dad who is sick, that he had to go early on the 29th to see them and after he got there he lost his phone and has been super crazy with family stuff that he hasn't had the bandwidth to go get a new phone. He also just has my contact saved and doesn't have my number memorized (we use wechat), so he wouldnt be able to contact me on another phone.

I've cried more today then in the past year. Please tell me other things I can try, or other excuses for why he isn't responding and didn't go on the trip. I'm so scared. When I was at his apartment door tonight all I could think is ""what if he fell and hit his head and hes on the other side of this door dead?"", but I'm not about to go full crazy and call the cops. Though I'm considering it at this point. Because the image wont leave my head and something is wrong I can feel it.

please help me.

Edit: Thanks for telling me I'm not overreacting this was what I needed to actually try to contact the cops.

*Definitely call the cops. This is very worrying. I would be concerned about his safety/wellbeing. You are NOT overreacting. Have them do a wellness check.*

*Why aren’t you calling the police?? Call them!*

*If Chinese is not your first language, I'd also look into contacting the embassy for your country (got the impression you were foreign). They may have resources to help you get translations when contacting the police. I really hope that he's safe and that you're doing as okay as you can be in this situation. You are NOT overreacting in the slightest, I would be a mess, and so would most of my loved ones if something like this happened. Trust your gut. Please don't prioritize updating Reddit. Your emotions and both of your well-being should matter more. Thinking of you guys.*

>OOP: Thanks so much. So many people have just been replying ""Why haven't you gone sooner??"" But Chinese is very much not my first language and when I'm tired/upset I'm even worse. But I was thankfully able to get by, thanks for the kind words. It's really helping me wind down from the craziness

**Update - 3 hours later**

He's not dead!

Okay so its been a crazy night. For everyone asking why I hadn't already gone to the cops, it had only been a day and a half and I live in a very safe place so I didn't want to overreact. People have always told me I blow stuff up so I'm very cautious about it now. I know I probably should have gone earlier though.

Anyway, I left my house and tried to find a police station but all I could find were traffic violation stations, so I called in even though I have the speech capabilities of an 11 year old in Chinese, and told them what was going on. There was. nice woman on the phone and she was very helpful and patient and sent over some officers to meet me and help me.

They immediately take my case very seriously, but I still have the problem of not really having much info to give them. They asked if I had a picture of his ID and I was like... no? and so it took them a long time to find his record in the system. They were ready to go with me to do a house check but then they got an update on the system and asked if I was okay going with them to the station, and I of course was. So I get there and they ask me a few more questions like if we were fighting (no we weren't), etc. Then the officers who I'm talking to get a bit nervous and one types something into his phone and shows me a translation, and it says: ""Your boyfriend was arrested 2 days ago.""

I felt so many emotions and I'm still reeling, I barely slept last night and I have been worried sick and crying all day and so I'm relieved that hes fine, hes not dead or hurt or sick or in a coma or something. But at the same time,,, Hes fucking arrested????

I'm still trying to wrap my head around it quite frankly. They couldn't tell me why he was arrested because the case isn't closed, but they took down my number and said they'd call me.

But yeah. I'm so exhausted from this whole ordeal.

Since I know people will ask, he's a great guy, a very nice person. He does, however, have very little regard for rules and regulations. He is an asshole driver on his bike and often cuts off cars. Also, he's not an angry person ever, but I can kind of seeing him getting in a fight if there's a good reason, at least in his own mind. (I know he once got in a altercation with someone early in our relationship for cursing out his mother).

But both of those mean you are held in custody until they figure out the case. If its just a minor traffic violation or a fight he'll be out in a few days, and probably pay a fine. If it's something worse... well then maybe I shouldn't be seeing him anyway.

Anyway thanks for everyone who commented, and made me feel like I wasn't overreacting or being a crazy girlfriend.

I'll update if I ever find out what he did.

TLDR: Hes not dead, he was arrested 2 days ago and his case is still ongoing.

Edit/ update: The more I think about it, He had to have been arrested early on tuesday. So probably not a fight or anything, maybe something he was caught on camera for?

Edit: when I say he has little regard for rules I mean compared to me, its very typical here. Bikes are illegal in this city so I'm told and yet I almost get hit by one daily. Jaywalking is illegal and yet he and everyone else does it all the time. Also, you can get held in custody for very minor things, which is why I haven't blacklisted him quite yet. Like once a guy yelled slurs at a group of my friends and called my black friend the n-word and the police detained him for 3 days for disturbing the peace. Not saying my bf would do that but you can get detained for parking tickets

**Comments**

**Questionsey**

*This post has made me realize how rare it is that anything leaks from China onto the English speaking internet.*

>OOP: haha yeah, I'm originally from america so (this might not be a good thing) but one of my first thoughts when I started to truely spiral was... lets ask reddit

**DawaLhamo**

*Early in our relationship, my husband got pulled over (in a small town in Kansas) for a rolling-stop at a stop sign. He had some unpaid parking tickets from years before, so they arrested him. Luckily he was able to get them cleared up, and he was able to get word to me, and was out in a couple days.*

*I hope you have the same kind of luck with your boyfriend, and it's something that can get cleared up quickly. The timing really sucks, though, and I'm sorry you missed your trip. Your boyfriend will really need to make it up to you.*

**Tremenda-Carucha**

*It'll probably be alright, honestly, but it's hard when someone you care about is going through something like this, and you're left feeling lost and a bit bewildered, and I suspect many of us have felt that way at some point, facing an unexpected crisis, so maybe try to be kind to yourself and just focus on taking things one day at a time, because, really, there's not much else you can do right now, is there?*

>OOP: thanks, yeah its been stressful. But I'm also just glad he's okay. Im just typing this until I get tired enough to go to sleep at this point.

I’ve been there – wading through endless articles, trying to stitch together coherent content from a chaotic sea of information. It’s exhausting, right? But what if I told you there’s a way to cut that time in half? Yep, I’m talking about harnessing the magic of **AI as your research assistant**. 

I mean, why work harder when we can work smarter? Let me share how I’ve set up my AI buddy to help me create deeply researched content in record time. And trust me, I’m no tech wizard; I just found a system that works! 

Here’s my go-to setup that’ll have you loving those late-night writing sessions (or at least dreading them a little less):

### 1. Choose Your AI Tool Wisely
I typically go for **ChatGPT** or similar platforms. It’s like having a research buddy who never charges you for coffee! ☕ I’ve found it’s great at summarizing dense content, pulling key points, and even drafting outlines.

### 2. **Start with a Killer Prompt**
The right prompt can make or break the outcome. Here’s a quick example:
- “Summarize the impact of climate change on marine biodiversity in bullet points.”
This gives you concise, digestible info that you can build from. 

### 3. Organize Your Findings
After you get the initial research from your AI tool, take a moment to group similar points. I like to use **Google Docs** or **Notion** for this:
- Create folders.
- Tag key themes.
- Make sure you can find that info when you need it – nothing worse than losing a useful nugget!

### 4. Fill in the Gaps
Now comes the fun part! Use the bullet points from your AI output to feather in personal insights, anecdotes, or examples. Ever wonder why that personal touch matters? Because it makes your content relatable! And isn't that we all crave in reading? 

### 5. Edit Like a Pro
Here’s where you can really polish your work. I typically go through:
- **Clarity**: Does it flow?
- **Conciseness**: Can I cut any fluff?
- **Engagement**: Would *I* want to read this?

### Bonus: Your Research Deck!
I recently stumbled upon this nifty guide (and yes, it’s not just me hyping it up) that dives deeper into creating effective content through AI. You should check out the **Viral Creator Vault** for some incredible insights that can elevate your game (link here: [Viral Creator Vault](https://whop.com/viral-creator-vault/?a=liveitupdeals)).

So, in case you’re feeling overwhelmed the next time you’re faced with a blank page – remember you’ve got tools to turn that chaos into clarity. It’s about finding a rhythm and process that works for you, not against you.

First, I was able to clearly identify my deepest fear: that unsettling sense of not being fully present — even though I was physically there. For years, I thought this meant I was dissociating during panic attacks, and that idea alone was terrifying to me — the thought of watching my life happen around me without being able to engage, to connect, to participate, and that for days, weeks, months. It was hell at some points.  
But recently, after a lot of therapy and deep introspection, I saw something I’d never realized before:

What I was calling dissociation was actually **hyper-focus**. I'm not saying dissociation doesn't exist — it absolutely does for many people — but in my case, it wasn't dissociation. It was something else entirely.  
Not an absence of awareness — but a tunnel of *intense* mental energy directed toward escape. Escape from the sensations, from the fear, from the possibility of panic.

And when I truly saw that clearly — *not just intellectually, but with my whole awareness* — something clicked.  
Suddenly, I didn’t need to manage or fix anything anymore. Because I understood that the act of “managing” was itself the source of the disconnection. And if you remember what I said earlier — that feeling of not being there — this was clearly the source of my fear. 

It was that simple, and that profound. And almost instantly, my entire internal state shifted. It was like a thick fog lifted — not because the sensations disappeared, but because I was no longer caught in the exhausting cycle of trying to control or avoid them.   
**If I stop trying to escape, my brain won’t be focused on escaping.**  
**And if my brain stops trying to escape, I’ll be present again.**  
The thing I feared the most — being gone, not being there — would no longer exist.

And when my brain understood that, it stopped. It stopped running.  
I didn’t force anything.  
It just didn’t need to run anymore.

And I was left with something surprisingly gentle:  
Just a body. Just small physical sensations. Just... me.

But here’s the part that really hit me yesterday:  
I realized that these physical sensations — tight chest, heart beating, chills — they’re **always the same**.  
Whether I’m in a calm state, slightly anxious, or in full panic — **they don’t change**.

What changes is what my mind *adds* on top:  
The fear, the urgency, the sadness, the confusion, the mental spinning: *“What’s happening? How do I stop this? How long will it last? I can’t live like this.”*

That’s what makes it unbearable — not the sensations themselves.

And when I stopped fueling that mental chaos — when I simply sat with my body, and let myself *just feel* — I saw how neutral the sensations really were.  
Sometimes even soft. Familiar.

I want to be super honest here though:  
This shift didn’t come out of nowhere.  
I’ve done **years of emotional work**: therapy, trauma processing, facing deep-rooted fears of abandonment, identity struggles, low self-worth… the whole mess.  
And once those parts had space to heal, what remained was the **loop**: the fear of fear itself.

And seeing that loop with clarity broke its power.

Another thing I want to say — because this might speak to someone out there — is that this all happened while I was in my **luteal phase**.  
This is the part of my cycle where I usually feel the most disconnected, the most anxious, the least present.  
It’s when I usually feel like I’m just surviving.

But even in that phase, I saw something:  
The sensations were **not stronger** than usual.  
They were the same. It’s my *mind* that usually makes them feel worse — by panicking, by trying to fix everything, by fighting the sensations instead of allowing them.

That’s when I realized:  
I was never actually accepting.  
I was just *fleeing differently*.

That part is huge, and I want to say it clearly:

People always say “don’t fight it, just accept it.”  
But what does that mean?

I thought I was doing that. But I wasn’t.  
Because I still did things like:  
→ Drinking water ""to flush the stress""  
→ Going for walks ""to lower cortisol""  
→ Avoiding coffee ""just in case""  
→ Washing my face with cold water ""because it helps regulate""

That’s **not peace**.  
That’s still **fleeing**. Just sneakier.

And so now, whenever I act, I try to ask myself:  
*“Am I doing this because I love it? Because it makes me feel alive?*  
*Or am I doing it to escape panic?”*

That shift — in intention — is everything.

I know everyone’s experience is different. This is just mine.  
But maybe, if your story is anything like mine, you’ve been stuck in this same loop without knowing it.

I truly hope this helps someone out there. I'm available if anyone has questions or wants to talk.",1,1748383362.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False
1kx0908,https://www.reddit.com/r/gastricsleeve/comments/1kx0908/calories_and_ounces/,Calories and ounces,"Hi. I’m 13 months post op gastric sleeve and not hitting my calories at all. I want to maintain my weight now but am roughly 400 calories below daily my maintenance calories and I have to eat when I’m not even hungry to try get to where I’m at. 
My periods have stopped and I feel dizzy everytime I stand.
But I can only eat 3oz in one sitting. My question is sometimes I get full around the 2.5oz mark and could stop there but I wait about 10 minutes and then eat the rest due to the fact I’m so anxious that my periods have stopped and obviously my body is some sort of malnourished for this to occur. I force myself to eat the 3oz and I know this might not be the best but if I didn’t there’s no chance I could ever eat even the low calories what I do. I’ve read at this point you should be able to tolerate 4-8ounces of food at one time. 
But obviously everyone is different. Will I be stretching my stomach forcing myself to eat 3oz? Is this even possible to do so with only 3oz of food? My body needs the food but I get full so quick. I add smoothies and shakes throughout the day to get me to my calories I’m at now which is 900-1000 (and I have to push and sometimes eat when I’m not hungry) but yeah , can I stretch it from forcing myself to finish the food? It’s frustrating me because how on earth am I ever meant to get my periods back and stop feeling dizzy all the time when 3oz 6-8 times a day is a push. 
I’ve added things to meals with higher calories such as nut butter , add cheese to everything. But am I damaging myself for finishing a 3oz meal even though I could probably stop around 2.5oz. I go back to it to finish it because my body is crying out for more nourishment but will I be stretching it doing this?? 
Also adding like milk to coffee to get calories in that way? Is that good or is that classed as grazing if I drink that when I’m not hungry just for the calories ?? And do I have to wait 30 minutes before and after drinking coffee with milk. Sorry so many questions

1kx07lu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1kx07lu/hows_your_memory/,How's your memory?,"Hey everyone,

I haven't been experiencing panic attacks but do have a heightened sense of anxiety. I think I'm so use to it that I would call it normal and not really heightened if that makes sense. Been struggling with slight dpdr aswell this past while and attribute it to just a stressful life. All in all I have been handling stress well and when anxiety creeps in I can de escalate it and remain calm as much as one is able to.

However one symptom I have noticed and I have now gone for a bloods, mris, eegs and more which all came back normal but both my memory and cognitive ability is shot. It's like I always feel like I just need a cup of coffee. I've also been doing this weird shoulder shrug sort of ticks but the frequency depends on how stressed I am.

Just checking if anyone else has these weird ticks and the cognitive decline?

I will see a psychiatrist in the coming month to hopefully put a stop to this. Currently on 20mg prozac.

Also my orgasms are non existant. Sexual activity brings as much joy as rubbing to stones together. Will need to also discuss this with my psychiatrist.  40mg prozac destroyed it and reduced dosage,  coming off for a year and switching to Paxil made no difference.

1kx014q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1kx014q/slow_weight_loss/,Slow weight loss,"Hey guys! I’d love some advice. I’ve been on ozempic for about 8 weeks now and starting to panic that it’s not working for me. I was originally 154 pounds or 69.8kg at my start weight. I’m now at 145 pounds or 65kg in 8 weeks. I’m quite short and have PCOS, I’m on metformin and spironolcatone as well as lexapro (very low dose). I was originally prescribed because I was rapidly gaining weight in a very short amount of time without any lifestyle or dietary changes whatsoever. I’m also 5 foot exactly, so being that weight, I was clinically overweight for my height and you can see it. 

Now, I haven’t made a huge difference, except only eating half the portions I was before because of the ozempic and making a bit more healthy choices because I feel sick if I eat junk now. But I definitely have had some junk food! I’ve tried to run between 3-4km once or twice a week and try to walk between 7-10k steps a day, but mostly make 6k as I work from 9-6pm everyday. 

To give you an idea of what I’m eating, I eat a banana for breakfast with a coffee, lunch I usually have a bagel with smoked salmon, soup or eggs and a thin (slims) bagel. For dinner I could have anything but mostly fish and veg with a carbohydrate, or honestly even spaghetti bolognese or something pretty normal, just a smaller portion. 

So, do you think it’s working for me? I’m broke so can’t join a gym and find it so hard to motivate myself to do exercise, but I like running when it’s nice out (I can just about pay for my meds). I also have bad veins and have had surgery to get varicose veins removed in my legs, and often get cramps because of it, which makes me tired and not want to do anything. Any advice?

Hey there,

I'm a 33 year-old guy from Michigan who thrives in the sunshine hiking, grilling, and just being outdoors when it's not snowing sideways. Come winter, I trade trails for books, binge-worthy shows, coffee, and good company and bonus points if you're a fan of cuddles.

I’m laid back, sarcastic as hell, and quick to laugh once I’m comfortable with someone. Physical touch is my love language, and I’m the kind of guy who’s attentive, dominant, and insatiable behind closed doors — but chill and respectful outside them. If you’re fun, flirty, and down for consistency without pressure, we’ll probably get along great.

I work a hybrid job with odd hours, which makes traditional dating a bit tricky. The upside? I can travel easily if you happen to be near and we get that far and I can  adjust to your schedule pretty well.

A few basics:
5’10”, green eyes, brown hair, athletic build

Drug-free, social drinker

Open to all body types, races, and ages (30+)

Looking for friendship or more or something in between

Respectful of boundaries and low pressure  I know we all have lives

If you’re craving real connection with a fun, no-drama guy who knows how to listen and make you laugh (and maybe bite your lip a little too), shoot me a message. Let’s see where this goes.

Here’s What the Science Actually Says,"Cold exposure has blown up lately. From Wim Hof, to cryotherapy, to 30-day shower challenges. But is it just another trend, or is there real science behind turning the knob all the way cold?

Turns out, cold exposure can do a lot more than just wake you up.

🧠 **Mental clarity and focus**  
Cold showers can stimulate norepinephrine release, a neurotransmitter that sharpens alertness and attention. A cold blast in the morning may help clear brain fog faster than coffee.

🩸 **Circulation and recovery**  
Cold water causes blood vessels to constrict, then dilate when you warm back up. This ""vascular workout"" may help improve circulation and reduce post-exercise soreness.

🧬 **Hormone and immune support**  
Some studies link cold exposure to increased endorphins, testosterone, and even white blood cell count, all of which play a role in resilience and overall health.

🧘 **Mood and stress resilience**  
The shock of cold water activates the parasympathetic nervous system and has been studied for its potential to reduce symptoms of low mood and improve stress response over time.

🔥 **Brown fat activation**  
Cold exposure can stimulate brown adipose tissue, which burns energy to generate heat. This may support metabolism and thermoregulation.

Start slow if you’re new to it, even 30 seconds at the end of a warm shower can offer benefits. Over time, the mental discipline and physical response tend to build.

Anyone here doing cold showers or other cold therapy consistently?

I posted this last week but it got deleted due to Reddit rules but many comments really helped me get through that day. And a lot of them reassured me that it would be fine. I’m posting this in hopes that people will find this post + give me reassurance & hope. Please share your stories too. 

but Hi, this is X (26F) & here’s me sharing extremely personal details from my life, love & how I lost my life in the span of 2 years through a speed dating event that was hosted by bumble in Hyderabad in May 2023.

It all started with my friends encouraging me to attend the bumble IRL event happening in Hyderabad at this Asian restaurant called Taro in Jubilee Hills. I was hesitant at first but when I thought to myself, what could go wrong - atleast there’s free food & who knows I might end up making good friends if not  a date. I always wanted to go to Taro but somehow the plan always got cancelled so I took this as universes sign for me to make it to the event and I travelled nearly 15 km & attended the event. Met a bunch of people, didn’t really enjoy because I was overstimulated by so much chatter & sound but the food was great, I ate a lot lol and during the 3 minute speed dating round,  3-4 guys stood out in my head as they were really intrigued by my work & had asked good questions. One of the guys was actually very cute. I shared my Instagram handle with a few girls & guys there & decided to head home. 

I didn’t think much of it honestly, I came home and had a good sleep. I barely was interested in dating anyone, but I did remember that cute guy & the way I was stuffing my face with food while talking to him & I texted my friend that I see someone very cute here. I didn’t even remember his name. I just remembered that he’s the cute/shy guy. 

Cut to nearly 3 months after - I get a call from an HR of this hedge fund inv. company located in J hills saying that they’re organised a flea market & they’d like to have my brand to a pop up shop at their office. My mom, a friend of mine and I were there to handle the stall and suddenly the cute guy from bumble IRL event shows up at my stall. So turns out he worked in the same office & he wanted to come say hi. It took me 2 seconds to recognise but I did recognise him & I think we exchanged phone numbers finally. Let’s call him YZ. He texted me a couple of times but I didn’t know that it was him so I didn’t reply I guess. But after taking his name I did decided to text him later when I actually want to intentionally decide to go on a date. 

Maybe after a month, in the first week of September 2023 I reached out to him & asked him out for a coffee. He instantly responded positively & we locked in a place near my college & decided to meet. His response and a major part of the chat from his side was all CHAT GPT responses. I quickly caught on to it. I felt bad but I let it slide thinking he’s just taking its help to framing his words better.

I went with 0 expectations or hopes & the first date actually went well. & then we decided to go on another date & that went really good too! We actually opened up to each other, shared vulnerable things from our life & bonded over on Spotify Jam. It was extremely special for us. Almost every night we would have a jam. We would text often, share pictures, funny moments and it was extremely wholesome. We had extremely cute dates at Kbr park - Hyderabad reads, we watched interstellar release together & actually had a great time. He was kind & very giving. We really prioritised this time & soon after - had the “what are we conversation”. It was clear that we were girlfriend - boyfriend but we also spoke about how we want this to lead to a marriage & not something casual. It wasn’t too hard to have a conversation about this. All we did was hold hands, walk, talk & listen to music. 

In November we started getting really attached & close & said I love you to each other. I was the first one to say it. It took a lot for me to say it but I didn’t question it. I said it. & he was happy too. 
In December suddenly my knee joint health started detoriating. I was doing physio, swimming and working out and actively working on healing my body. He got overly anxious & worried but always tried to care for me and he was great at it. He really took care of me. 
I used to end up staying with him until 11 pm at some cafe or just my cat hanging out, listening to music & I’d by 12 midnight. My parents trusted me so they didn’t scold me but they knew that I was seeing someone and lot of curiosity about this was present at home. 

After my 25th Birthday I told my parents about this guy & the relationship. My mom was happy but curious. My dad kind of lost his shit - difference in caste, I’m from Telangana and he’s from Guntur, we belong to different castes (same category, he said caste wouldn’t be an issue) & have extremely different professions. No one was against the relationship but my did threw tantrums (I think he just freaked out cuz the idea of me getting married & moving out eventually really caused him to panic) but he wasn’t against the relationship or held any grudge. 

In January 2024, my father and mother were having a tough time with their marriage & became the punching bag for both mom & dad. And I had just started an extremely intensive internship while also working on my physical health. 

It came to a point where my Mom & I moved from our own house. It took a toll on me mentally. Family was falling apart. Health was falling apart. There was so much stress. Moms work, my work, my college and my internship and my work - everything broke me mentally. I had thoughts of disappearing from the world & self harming. I thought I’m done for. I couldn’t cope but through out all this, my boyfriend (YZ) was extremely supportive, loving and caring. He fed me, took care of me and gave me so much hope. I thought he would break up with me and I actually asked him to break up if I was getting a lot to handle. 

In Feb, my mom met him for the first time and she didn’t really have any opinion on him. My parents trusted my choice and just wanted me to be happy. They didn’t ask me his salary (which I didn’t know too) or anything about their property status or anything. They just wanted to know if he’s a safe guy and has a good family that is safe for me. I’m an only child so parents really just wanted my happiness. They put aside everything materialistic. 

Context : YZ parents are divorced. He lives with his mother. Mother is a business owner. He has an older brother who lives in New York.

In March 2024 my entire world came crashing when my dog had an accident & I thought I lost her. My entire life flashed in front of my eyes (it took me good 4-6 months to stop the panic attacks after this incident) & I was going through an existential crisis in this phase too because I was back in college after 4-5 years and changed my entire career trajectory while already having a successful job and business. I always questioned myself for my choice but I never strayed away. I had a tough time academically but I did score really well, all A+ & O’s and I gave credit to my mother, my boyfriend, faculty and classmates for always supporting me through this difficult time. 

Eventually mom and I came back home & dad was working hard to make things right. And shit was getting a little easy. I decorated our house, got lots of new furniture for home and literally re did our whole house so that I forget the trauma and create my own peaceful space. 

On Valentine’s Day 2024, I was combing my hair before college and I realised I had 3 bald patches on my scalp. I instantly went to a doctor - it was an auto immune disease called alopecia areata & all the stress I went through the last 1-2 months was the causes clearly. My joints were a little better. But this thing really scared me. My hair has been a huge asset for me throughout my life. It’s a huge part of my personality and identity. So this news broke me. My partner too got scared. He was worried about his mom getting to know about this (His mom didn’t know that her son was in a relationship). He said that his mom & brother would worry & say no to the relationship if I had alopecia. I obviously got the necessary treatment done & within 2 months the issue resolved and the patches grew back hair normally & it was all fine. He also got me hair supplements & hair products if I recall correctly. 

My parents, especially my mom wanted to meet his mother & figure out the scene for my future. But the man didn’t tell his mom yet about the relationship. His colleagues knew, I was good friends with a couple of his college mates. Everyone but his mom knew about the relationship because he was scared of telling her. 

To provide more context - given my family situation, my house wasn’t the most stable place for me growing up. It was dysfunctional & quite frankly I raised myself. My parents aren’t cruel or unkind. But I feel they were too young (24M 17F) when they got married and had me too young too. They have had a very rocky marriage due to family drama & a lot of lies. I did face a lot of stress and trauma due to psychological & physical abuse especially in my teenage years. I was depressed & seeked medical help too for it very proactively on my own. 

One mistake I made was, I was very open about my mental health struggles on my Instagram. I did post about all the mis diagnosis & random labels psychiatrists and psychologists were putting on a 18-19 year old me. These posts are from 2020-2022.

My partner wasn’t comfortable with these & worried if his brother or mother would get to know about this. He was worried if they get to know about my past relationship too. He told me that I was the first girl he was with in all means. My partner was for sure embarrassed about my past. I archived a lot of these posts that would potentially become a problem. Tbh, it took me a long time to accept my self & move ahead with my life & I knew I couldn’t allow him to make me feel broken again given his extreme fear of telling his mum about us. I gave an ultimatum, asked him to end the relationship if he was so embarrassed about my past but he reassured me that he wasn’t embarrassed & that he accepts me & that he’ll also tell his mom.

My mom and dad both kept telling me that this guy won’t tell his mom because of the caste difference & how dowry is extremely important for people in their caste. I obviously told them that he’s not like that and I defended him so much. So much.
Whereas this guy not only didn’t tell his mom for the longest time, but he started feeling like he betrayed his mother by being in a relationship with me. He used the word betrayed. I felt very effed up on hearing this. It broke me. I ended the relationship. But he came back & apologised and promised to fix things and also guaranteed my mother that things would change & he would tell his mother asap & I fully believed him. I had either the choice of delusionally having faith or walking away. 

During this time I once was on a call with him, and I heard a woman mo*ning. I instantly hung up feeling scared. He confessed that he was watching po*n and that the moa** probably were from there. He wasn’t watching it while talking to me but there was some audio sync issue probably. But this made me a little uncomfortable (I always knew that he watched po*n and I was okay with it cuz it’s no big deal & everyone anyway watched it & I wasn’t angry). But after he cleared this up for me I only had one question & I asked him if I was the first person he was physical with like he told me in the past or if he’s hiding anything from me. He apologised and confessed again that he was scared & ashamed to admit it - but I wasn’t the first person like he told me, but when he had gone to Bangkok, he hooked up with a local girl there through bumble or tinder. It broke me a lot because he lied to me. He didn’t have to lie. I just wanted to know if I was the first woman he dated. Not like it was important or anything but he absolutely didn’t have to lie and then reveal this to me in such a guilty manner. I never judged him. He knew that I wouldn’t even be sad or mad for being honest ever. He knew that I’m super chill & accepting of but him lying and hiding stuff unnecessarily did make me really mad. He said that he felt so guilty after hooking up that he blocked her from everywhere and ghosted her (this is exactly what he did to me in 2025, wait got it. And this pattern repeated)

I consoled him saying that he did nothing wrong by hooking up & that it’s super normal & that he doesn’t have to feel guilty or ashamed. I reassured him many times about this. 

Eventually in May or June 2024 he did tell his mom about me after many arguments & more ultimatums by me. I was willing to end the relationship because I couldn’t understand why he was so scared to even talk to his mom. He doesn’t tell his mom anything. His mom & him don’t have a good relationship I guess, they never have normal chill conversations like I or my friends do with their mothers. Their relationship started scaring me tbh.
I was very eager to meet his mom, wanted to give her a hug & in general make her a part of my family and give her the same love I gave my partner. I was super excited to eventually move in with them whenever we got married. I wanted to live with the both of them & not make my partner move out for me. Meanwhile, my parents, my grandparents met him. Liked him & hoped things would go well but they worried a little as his mom never contacted any of us and also this guys meek personality was of a concern. 

I was hoping that his mom would call me and then speak to my parents. But in June 2024 I myself reached out to her on WhatsApp & said Hi. She knew very well that it was her son’s partner. But she asked me who I was and I said that I’m her son’s friend. She said “oh, he’s still my son?”. A bunch of conversations that felt like horrible jokes that middle aged men crack about their wives occurred. 

After a few days “she called” me, & asked me who am I. I said hi aunty I’m X, your sons friend. She said “okay, so what, why should I talk to you?”. I said “if I have to live with you & your son eventually - you have to talk to me and get to know me.” My tone was very respectful & gentle. Her’s was sarcastic/funny but serious at the same time. 

She said that she never expected this from her son, as her son & boys in their family don’t even give eye contact to women and that she’s unable to believe that he has a whole girlfriend. She never brought this up to him. But kept asking me - how come he likes you, I never imagined my son was capable of anything like this.. and her tone with me started becoming very sarcastic yet stern. 

I kept telling him that his mom was behaving weirdly with me but he kept saying that she’s worried or insecure or just messing around. He didn’t dare to ask her why she was asking all these stupid questions. 
Somehow she managed to enter my head. Messed me up enough to bicker with him & silently started eating our us souls up. I could have handled it better but In hindsight, I should’ve  broken up with him at this point & gone my way for my own sanity but I was delulu & hopelessly in love with him. 

In July, things got really worse. His mom & I tried to work together for an event (both of us are business owners in the same industry) but a lot of misunderstandings happened, both of us messed up. I was 25 and she was 56 maybe and she acted no differently than me. Her age reflected no maturity whatsoever. She was very impulsive, rude & quick to pass judgements on me and also character assassinated me multiple times. I lost my shit too after a point & I went to their home (for the first time) and she refused to let me in saying that these aren’t good days astrologically. She didn’t let me in but she was texting me like a teenager saying that I ruined her reputation, and that me & her son will always make her suffer and she’s accepted her fate of suffering cuz of me. This was so melodramatic. I got very upset and angry and barged into their home & yelled at her. Yelling at her didn’t make me fell any better but I was being attacked unnecessarily & somehow me defending myself also seemed disrespectful. She was banging her head, collapsed in the pooja room & started crying. Anyway, long story short - I mentally felt like there’s no future here & my partner was quiet through out this. He wanted to react but he couldn’t and he was crying too a lot He couldn’t console his mom or me. He tried his best to console me but it was in vain.

I gave an entire account of what happened to my parents & a couple of friends who were involved in this incident and they all outright told me that this wasn’t normal or okay & that I need to move away from this relationship because there’s no future for me there if the woman is so dramatic and the son is scared to actually open his mouth and say something. Things got ugly. We however were spending time together whenever we could, he craved me, I craved him. We were inseparable. My parents gave up. But all that nonsense I was seriously depressed, I needed to be on antidepressants. My joints were better, my hair grew back better than before but the drama that happened between his mother & I. Also his silence/passivity was ruining me. I made attempts to end the relationship, I blocked him a few times, he would come home to me, give me reassurance & say that he will fix it. From July 2024 to Jan 2025 we endured a lot. I couldn’t leave him because he was actually a good person. He was kind, caring, respectful, always was there for me, helped me with my problems & genuinely was a great support. He was also present at the graduation ceremony last year at my college with my mom & it was so wholesome.

By January, I had moved on from the past drama, I was willing to give my all to this relationship and fix my relationship with his mother too. I wanted to genuinely try my best. I apologised to her for 4-5 months. She said it’s okay. But the way this stress ate up him & I internally is extremely heartbreaking.

On New Year’s Eve, him & I went out to an event & he was dull through out. I asked him what’s the matter- & only after I begged him to tell me he said that he will tell me only if I don’t react and he opened up to me saying that, his brother went through my socials, saw past posts about how I overcame thyroid (which was mild) and how I overcame PCOS just through diet and exercise & these posts had hundreds of shares & helped many women. & also that he saw some posts about my mental health from 2020-2022 & that his brother was extremely concerned about him as being a partner to someone with a history of mental health struggles, pcos & thyroid would be very difficult & this scared my partner. He was worried that his brother was worried, he was worried that I would get mad at his brother; he was also worried that I wasn’t exercisingy. I’m not someone that eats junk food but my body responds to stress very quickly. His brothers concerns were not invalid but the fear he mongered was a bit out of proportion. As I had very mild symptoms and nothing too much. It’s funny because my partner too had his own share of health concerns and he also had a skin condition which was an STD. To give more context, I have hypothyroidism and take 12.5 mcg, he has hyperthyroidism and takes 75 mcg. He’s probably 5”6 & skinny but muscular.  
I’m 5”1 & little overweight/mid size Indian woman but I eat healthy (this information will be relevant in the end trust me) But for now, I can say that x wanted me to workout to lose weight but he would say that he wants me to be fit. I love working out too but I stopped after I joined college + got the joint issue as doctors told me to not workout. 

Anyway, his mom & I worked on another project in January 2025 & it was a great experience. It was quite successful & we both got good recognition from the govt officials for it. I finally felt that this summer we could get married & my parents too felt that his mom is coming around. But out of no where, immediately after the work finished, she told my mom & I over phone that she didn’t like me, my dad & the way my family is after introducing me to everyone as her daughter in law. This was confusing. 

My parents maybe aren’t the greatest couple but they really are the most accepting people in the world. They are kind. They don’t wish bad on anyone no matter who it is. They’re very unproblematic people & super supportive to me. Throughout this project, my dad was my biggest supporter and he did 50% of my work. My partners mom didn’t like it. He was quietly helping me, making things easier for me so that I can focus on other things which were more important & difficult for anyone else to deal with. So she said that she didn’t like my family & specifically mentioned my dad.

She never directly said that she’s against us getting married - She just would bring up random things up & stress us out. And I really took a toll on me and him. My parents were worried. They were worried that I would be broken. My parents repeatedly asked him if he’s serious & genuinely wanted this. & he always said yes. Eventually on my dads advice, my partner decided to register apply online for a register marriage so that we could get through with the marriage atleast and we decided to live seperately until things sorted post marriage and eventually families would come around. My parents weren’t happy about this whole thing. But they wanted to see if this guy really cared for me & if he’s capable of taking a stand for me. His mother also told him to go ahead & get married. So he applied for a register marriage and after a 30 day waiting period, we would get married. He told his mom that he registered and she was pissed. She probably didn’t expect him to actually go ahead with it. To be honest, even I didn’t think that he could do it - given how scared he is of his mother and the way he always wants to ensure to be in her good books. Her love was so conditional. Her mood was very unpredictable and she was nice to all the outsiders but rude to him. At many occasions she said that she will think that her son is dead and move on. She told my mom that we probably did something to him or fed him something- because of which he’s in love with me and that my family has trapped him. No one trapped him. He was always free to leave. My parents told him to end the relationship many times when his mother acted out. It was our attachment that kept us together. 

A few days after we put the application for the register wedding, the following happened (19 Feb) - Everyday he would be the first one to text me or would atleast check in about college (I am doing another course at the same college at this point) but on this day, I got no texts from him. I called him, he was hanging up. Later he texted me saying that he’s stuck in a meeting. This is the first time in over a year he acted like this. It was strange because even if he’s in a meeting, he would text me atleast for 5 mins and get back to work. It was almost 4 pm, no info and then he called me back and said that his brother is here. I literally felt shivers run down my spine. My heart beat was weird too. My watch gave me alerts too. He said that his brother flew from New York to Hyderabad out of nowhere and directly went to my partners office and has been there only since morning and that’s why he couldn’t text me or call me. This was weird. I felt extremely uncomfortable and scared. I knew something was up. I felt like this was the beginning of something really bad. My body knew very strongly that this isn’t normal or okay. Because, last year his mom was sick and hospitalised, even then this brother guy didn’t fly down. All of a sudden now, and then heading to my partners office. I was scared. But I tried to act normal. We were discussing about me going the next day to buy gold rings for him and he said yeah go. We spoke for a long time that day. That day I got my medical reports too that said that I have thyroid and pcos again. Very slight symptoms and nothing intense. I was already stressed and this added more to my stress. And college too was next level stressful. Everything felt too much. I was exhausted. This was on Feb 19th. He knew I was exhausted but he went on telling me about some yoga asanas that can help with pcos. I instantly felt very pissed and yelled at him for dumping this info on me. He got extremely upset. I apologised. And then I told him that I’m scared to get married at this point and that some basic things between us aren’t sorted and that we should take 10 steps back and then slowly decide whether to go ahead with marriage or not. To which he panicked and ended up crying. I kept consoling him while I was tired myself. I needed a break badly. From everything. 

On Feb 14th we had a couple of discussions post which I got very confused about marrying him. We went to Fabindia, I bought a shirt for him & dad, & a Kurta for myself. I then also picked some stevia & saw there was some weight loss balance pills. I always knew that he wanted me to lose weight. But I wanted to see how far he would go with it, I wanted to buy some green tea, he said you already shopped a lot, guy green tea sometime else, don’t shop too much now. But then the weightloss pills didn’t seem to bother him. He offered to pay for it too. But I quickly paid off and noticed how he wasn’t against buying those pills and he even offered to pay. Weird. It was some sort of a twisted test I wanted to put him through. Any friend of mine would immediately say no to such things. I felt a bit surprised. 
Then we went to a cafe to have dinner. We chatted until the food arrived. He was talking about how in future he wants to trek, travel and explore the mountains. Trekking is something we both love. I said yes I’m excited too. And then idk why and how I brought up the topic of how I liked something at fabindia and it was so expensive but I really wanted to buy it. He said he saw it too and that he liked it too but maybe I can get it sometime else. They were white linen lounge pants priced at 3000 inr. 
That’s expensive for me. But I thought to myself that when I earn enough to buy them, I will buy them. & the conversation went around how rain-fed cotton & linen is expensive etc. almost like I was giving him an explanation as to why it’s priced like that. I’m someone that’s been exploring sustainable/hemp clothing. I don’t wear anything but cotton & linen as I have heavy sensory issues with any man made fibre like nylon or polyester.

This guy, sits in the washroom at office & opens cred & buys random stuff everyday pretty much (he also gifts me good stuff from there but he hoards stuff when it’s cheap & gives it off to me) & idk suddenly he became this anti capitalist person. I’m someone that gets very excited for small small things too - such as I saw that the cafe was selling gulkand in their storefront & I was happy as a kid to find it. He got upset at that. He went “I get scared when you get excited for things like this”. It honestly made me so sad. It’s just a bottle of gulkand. And it’s been ages since I had it. And he had to shut me down like that. Buy me being me, I got the gulkand, he bought it for me. I was looking to buy gulkand since many years tbh. I shop a lot. But I don’t do it very impulsively. I am very clear on what I want and if I don’t like something with my entire being, I don’t purchase it. I wait, think and then make any purchases. But I have this problem of buying clothes when I’m sad. From December 2024 to Feb 2025, I did buy 7-10 pairs of cotton clothes that genuinely cheered me up and made me happy. None of it was fast fashion or cheaply made stuff but extremely thought out purchases. So this person saying that he’s been concerned about capitalism lately was very funny to me. I literally write about capitalism on my social media and more than half my closet is thrifted stuff. I never shopped from H&M, Zara, shoppers stop, or any fast fashion place ever since my childhood even. I wear sarees & chikankari Kurtis most of the times. So all this was very weird coming from him. He is very simple and both of us obviously aren’t people that care for brands. He earned 10x as me and I actually never was interested in knowing his salary. Never. But he revealed it to me when my parents brought it up once. I don’t even remember the exact number he makes but it was more than 10x as me. I didn’t even know that software engineers could make so much. But even knowing this number didn’t make a different to me or my parents. His mom thought I’m trapping him for his money. But I’m not stupid to marry someone only for money. I actually come from an upper middle class family with own house (duplex villa, enough savings, investments, gold and property etc) & I’m the only daughter. Why would I ruin my future literally for money? So funny his mother thought of me that way. 
My parents only concern was that this guy stayed in a rented home. They always wanted me to get married into a family that has an own house. This, and his mother’s behaviour was the only reason my parents weren’t happy but ultimately they knew that I was super happy with this man so accepted him and treated him as a part of the family. He was always welcome at my home, we would watch movies together at my home, I would try to cook something for him, and genuinely my family never had an issue with him coming home. They were happy infact.

Okay so on Feb 19th (the day his brother came to hyd) the conversation somehow ended on a bitter note but we decided to meet and talk and sort this, I remember telling him that if things get too worse we can always end it and that I’m okay with breaking up rather than suffering forever due to his mom and brother. I told him that I’m sure there will be someone that accepts me for the person I am as I am instead of focusing on my thyroid, pcos, weight, etc. He went home, he wouldn’t talk to me as his brother was there. I don’t know I felt very overwhelmed, exhausted and chaotic so I took some melatonin and slept it off. Next morning I had plans to go to the gold shop so I showered & waiting for him to call me back. He didn’t text me, hung up my calls. Cut my calls. Diverted to voice mails. He texted me saying that he will meet me in the evening. I didn’t understand anything. This never happened before. He said he was in a meeting. I knew he was lying. And for the first time I kept calling him repeatedly. My brain couldn’t handle or comprehend what was happening. He picked the phone and said that this is really over and that he’s breaking up with me and that it’s all over for real. Just the night before he cried at the thought of losing me and now he said it’s over on a random Thursday. I asked him a couple of questions and he said that his family isn’t making him do it but he himself decided that it’s over and he instantly blocked me from everywhere. Literally from everything. He blocked my parents, my sister. And just like that he disappeared. I left him an email that day saying that I’ll wait for things to cool down and that we can talk then but he replied really harshly saying that we are different people, and that love isn’t enough, and that he’s already moved on and that he doesn’t love me anymore and that the version of him that loved me is no more there and that he’s gone forever. “I’m moving away from this phase of my life”. He said all this verbatim. He send me 2-3 emails I believe. The first one was written by chat gpt. His emails entirely placed the blame on me for the failure of this relationship and contained elements of 
Emotional Violence, Spiritual Bypassing. Devaluing me and Discarded me, Determinism, Splitting & Identity disintegration, Self Victimisation, Emotional severance, Reputation cleanse (of his) 
Gaslighting via flattery (thanking for me the love I gave him), Abandonment disguised as flattery & Ego preservation and not self preservation (saying that he’s doing this to protect his mental health). 

I didn’t understand one bit of what was happening. I cried till my lungs gave up on me. I was confused, shocked. I called his cousin and his cousin was shocked and suprised said that give it a couple days he will come back and maybe because the brother came all this is going on. My mom and dad were shocked. I was rushed to hospital the next day. My lungs gave up. My eyes were on the verge of popping out. No one understood anything. He just blocked me and disappeared. My family or I didn’t try to get in touch with him or his family. As much as I wanted to to drive to his office, my self respect stopped me. We didn’t try to contact him or anyone from his family after that. I didn’t go to his office or home to meet him or have a conversation. I had enough self respect to not do that. In a couple days he flew to Bangalore. He thought I’d come there - but It didn’t even matter to me anymore. I was in touch with a couple of mutual friends and they said that he’s serious about the break up and that his brother was coming to the office with him and stayed the whole day too at office with him. Very weird. Why would a grown man’s brother escort him to his office, eat with him,  play with him in the office and take him back home like he’s a kid. YZ is literally a 28 year old grown man. 

I don’t know how to even comprehend the way I felt. But I knew that I’m not gonna trouble him. I just gave up on contacting him or reaching him. I left all hope. I quickly understood that it’s really over and that he decided to do this and I have nothing else to do but accept this. On Feb 20th night, I received a couple of emails that said 
YZ removed you from Spotify Family. 
YZ removed you from YouTube Family. 
YZ made edits to Notion page.
He deleted the Notion pages where we wrote down everything we wanted to buy for our own home after getting married, he delete the list of places and things that we wanted to do together. 
He deleted our mutual gmail account too & all the photos in the drive. This hurts me even today. He exited WhatsApp groups that we both were a part of. He said in the email too that he deleted everything & he’s already moved on + wants to forget this phase of his life. 

I was/am stuck at - how does one move on in less than 24 hours? How does one delete everything? He literally erased everything. 
How could he erase it all without my knowledge? I had all the rights to atleast have one last chance to see them all before he deleted them forever. 
On Feb 19th he was cracking jokes from Sankranthiki Vastunnam movie. Feb 17th was the last time I saw him. Prakash Nagar Starbucks. I didn’t in my wildest dreams know that it would be the last time.

I was broken. On 19th Feb too I 100% willing to breakup. I told him too that we can break up. He didn’t have to do me dirty like this. He could have openly had a conversation with me about it and then left. It’s not about him breaking up with me that shattered my heart & trust, it’s the way he did it. My parents told me many times to end the relationship because they didn’t want him to pick between his mother & I. I told him to choose his mom always. As she has no one but her son yet I feel like this cruelty he chose broke me. 

If he actually met me & my parents told me that he wants to end it - we all would have moved past by now. I didn’t want to suffer cuz of his toxic family and his unresolved issues & neither did I want him to suffer cause of his family. His family was very unkind to him. Extremely unkind. But ultimately he felt safe with them because that’s what he’s familiar with. I have no qualms about this. But I wish I was given the dignity of a conversation atleast. It’s been 3 months but The first 20 days were easy as I was on 5 antidepressants & mood stabilisers & I intellectualised my feelings. But the medicines ruined my vision and made me wobbly. They put very dark thoughts in my head too. I had to get off them. I started drinking. I was drunk dialling our mutual friends and crying inconsolably. My parents were entirely shattered. My sister thought she lost me. I was no longer myself. I became a different person altogether. I couldn’t understand anything. I couldn’t believe that he moved on from me in a day and that I wasn’t even worth having a conversation in the end despite everything I did to save this relationship. I wasn’t the best girlfriend always but I was trying to be a better person every single day. I was learning to mould myself into a person that his mother would accept. I let him archive all the posts on my Instagram that he wasn’t okay with. I didn’t do anything without his knowledge or permission. I tried my best. But my best wasn’t enough. I was taking therapy to work on myself. I had some anger problems I can say. He promised to take help too to overcome or work through his own issues coming from his strained relationship with his mom or his passive behaviour etc. but he didn’t & I stopped asking too.

It’s been 3 months but There was this one day where my heart was aching and I was crying nonstop out of no where. I felt someone was pulling my intestines out. The entire day I cried. I felt like YZ was going far away from me physically. My gut instinct was that he’s leaving the country too now. I called a mutual friend, they said that my instinct was right, and that he’s left an hour ago for New York. A couple of weeks ago, I had a big day at work and a few hours prior to it, I had a huge breakdown in front of my parents. They didn’t understand anything. I texted my bestfriend saying that my gut instinct is that he’s back in Hyderabad. This time, I didn’t call any mutual friend. I cut off all our mutual friends. But somehow I still ended up getting to know on May 20th that my gut instinct about him coming back to Hyderabad was accurate. 

I lost my identity as a person, my academics went for a toll, I barely attended college since Feb 19th. My classmates, teachers, HOD & even the dean saw me morph into someone they couldn’t recognise. Heck, I didn’t recognise myself. I forgot to laugh. I lost myself. My memory was fading due to the medicines. I hated seeing myself in the mirror. I wanted to shave my head and go away forever. But I chopped off 14 inches of my long silky hair and broke my mom’s heart. I still want to shave my head but me doing that would break my parents heart even more. My parents blame themselves everyday for me becoming like this because they feel that they could have protected me from this heartache if they themselves pushed away YZ  after the drama with his mom in July 2024. They blame themselves for not involving themselves more into my life. My mom regrets not getting me married earlier. 

Like they said in life of pi, it’s important to take a moment to say goodbye. Goodbyes are necessary. There’s a reason why they mourn for 11 days and perform so many rituals when someone passes away. 
I wish I got my goodbye. I wish I got a funeral too. But here I am, carrying the grief of a girl that no longer exists.

Kafka’s Kitchen: Serving Hope with a Dash of Absurdity
At Kafka’s Kitchen, we turn life’s darkest absurdities into nourishing stories for the soul. We blend Franz Kafka’s surreal imagination, Kurt Vonnegut’s dark wit, and Terry Pratchett’s whimsical humor, all grounded by a touch of Schopenhauer’s philosophical insight, to reinvent how we talk about mental health in a creative, relatable, and data-driven way. This is a professional venture with a beating heart: a media platform where personal pain metamorphoses into inspiration and support (no giant insect transformations necessary).
The Vision and Mission
Vision: To build a world where no one faces mental anguish alone or without a laugh. Kafka’s Kitchen envisions a vibrant community united by candid storytelling and clever humor, helping people find light even when life feels Kafkaesque.
Mission: We harness storytelling and satire to break the stigma around mental health. By serving up “food for thought” —essays, photography, podcasts—we aim to comfort the weary, amuse the jaded, and inspire action. In simpler terms, we’re in the business of transforming despair into hope (with a side of laughter) and delivering it at scale.
Why “Kafka’s Kitchen”? We chose this name to reflect transformation and nourishment. Kafka’s famed metamorphosis story symbolizes how overwhelming life can feel—like waking up as a bug in a bewildering world—but in our kitchen, even the strangest experiences can be turned into something nourishing. A kitchen is warm, communal, and creative; Kafka’s Kitchen is where we cook raw emotions into digestible, even delightful, life lessons. In true Vonnegut fashion, we believe humor is often the sanest response to an insane world—and in Pratchett’s spirit, even a small spark of wit can illuminate the darkest night.
The Problem: A Kafkaesque Mental Health Landscape
A Silent Epidemic: Mental health struggles are widespread and growing. Approximately 280 million people worldwide suffer from depression, yet far too many suffer in silence or lack support. As Schopenhauer grimly noted, life often oscillates between agony and boredom—for those with depression, that pendulum swing is all too familiar. Traditional resources (therapy, hotlines, self-help books) are critical but often inaccessible, impersonal, or steeped in clinical jargon. The result: millions feeling isolated and misunderstood, like protagonists in a Kafka story trapped in a bewildering bureaucracy of the mind.
Stigma and Barriers: Despite recent progress, stigma still looms. Roughly 75% of people in some low- and middle-income areas receive no treatment for mental disorders, due not only to lack of services but fear of judgment. Even in developed communities, admitting “I’m not okay” can feel like standing trial for an unknown crime (cue Kafka’s The Trial). We live in a society that’s starting to talk about mental health, yet many conversations remain surface-level, overly sanitized, or depressingly dull. The raw, messy reality—the kind that real people live through daily—gets lost.
Lack of Relatable Content: There is a gap in the market for mental health content that is both deeply relatable and genuinely engaging. Much of the existing media falls into two extremes: dry clinical advice or overly polished “Instagram positivity.” For those in the trenches of depression or anxiety, a cheery platitude can ring hollow, and medical pamphlets often fail to speak to the heart. The hard truth is that confronting mental illness can be absurdly complicated and even darkly comic at times—but few platforms dare to acknowledge that. So it goes… for now. It doesn’t have to stay that way.
In summary, the problem is clear: Hundreds of millions are grappling with mental health challenges without a satisfying, relatable way to find comfort, community, and meaning. The world faces an epidemic of the mind, but the “medicine”—accessible support and honest conversation—hasn’t caught up with the scale or the strangeness of the problem.
Our Solution: The Kafka’s Kitchen Experience
Kafka’s Kitchen is the antidote to isolation and stigma—a creative refuge where we address mental health with candor, humor, and art. We offer a multi-platform content experience that turns “I thought I was the only one who felt like this” into “I can’t believe someone just captured exactly what I’m going through—and even made me smile about it”
Key Ingredients of Our Platform:
 * 🖋️ Storytelling (Essays & Articles): Personal narratives and essays that tackle the realities of depression, anxiety, and life’s curveballs—told with a literary twist. One week, readers might find a Kafkaesque tale of navigating a nightmare bureaucracy to get a therapy appointment; the next, a Vonnegut-style satire skewering the absurdity of “wellness” fads. These stories are raw, authentic, and sprinkled with humor to lighten the heaviness. Readers not only see their own experiences reflected, but also gain new perspectives and coping insights amid the punchlines.
 * 🎨 Visual Art (Photography & Illustration): In a nod to “a picture is worth a thousand words,” we incorporate photography and art that express what words sometimes can’t. Our founder’s original photographs (think moody cityscapes, symbolic still-lifes) accompany many essays, creating a powerful emotional resonance. We plan to host illustrated thought pieces—for example, a darkly funny comic strip about the “demons” of procrastination personified, or a Terry Pratchett-inspired drawing that finds whimsy in the mundane. Visual content broadens our appeal and is highly shareable on social media, drawing people into deeper engagements with our stories.
 * 🎙️ Podcasts (Voice & Community): At the heart of Kafka’s Kitchen will be a podcast series—essentially “audio soul food”. Imagine sitting at a cozy kitchen table, listening to a conversation between friends who have been through the mental health wringer and aren’t afraid to joke about the times they cried. Our podcast episodes blend heartfelt discussion, interviews with creatives and experts, and segments of humor (e.g. a satirical “news update” from the Bureau of Crazy Thoughts). This spoken-word format provides intimacy and comfort on demand. Notably, 94% of mental health podcast listeners say podcasts are important in managing their mental health, and 57% say such shows have helped remove the stigma around mental illness. We leverage this powerful medium to foster a sense of connection and hope, letting listeners feel understood and less alone.
 * 🌐 Interactive Community: Beyond consuming content, Kafka’s Kitchen invites participation. On our website (and future app), users can join forums and live chats themed to our latest stories or podcast topics. This peer community aspect is crucial—it’s the spice that brings the dish together. Users will share their own “recipes” for dealing with tough days, inspired by our blend of humor and honesty. Moderated by mental health advocates, the community space will be safe yet unfiltered. Over time, we plan to feature user-contributed stories and artwork (with permission and maybe small prizes or payment)—turning readers into co-creators. This not only deepens engagement but also scales our content library organically. Essentially, we provide the kitchen; everyone brings an ingredient.
Our Secret Sauce: We approach mental health content like a gourmet recipe:
 * Start with Authentic Emotions: We don’t shy away from the bitterness of despair or the spice of anger. Real feelings are the base.
 * Add Insight and Research: Fold in facts, psychological insights, and coping strategies (the nutritious part)—drawn from credible sources and personal experience.
 * Season Generously with Humor: A spoonful of humor makes the hard truths easier to swallow. By infusing wit reminiscent of our literary heroes, we turn “I can’t go on” into a wry smile and “I’ll give it another shot.”
 * Serve Warm in a Welcoming Space: Like a comforting meal for a weary traveler, our content is served with empathy. Readers and listeners feel seen, not judged, and even entertained.
In short, Kafka’s Kitchen provides what traditional mental health channels lack: a relatable, entertaining, and enlightening experience that helps people heal and grow. It’s not therapy, but it’s therapeutic. It’s not a self-help seminar, but you might just help yourself by enjoying it. We’re convinced that storytelling and laughter cannot cure mental illness, but they can make the burden lighter—and often inspire someone to seek further help or keep going. That is our ultimate goal: to stir the will to live and to live well, even when life’s recipe seems flawed.
Market Opportunity & Audience
The timing for Kafka’s Kitchen is ideal. The world has never been more ready to talk about mental health, and consumers are seeking fresh, engaging ways to find support. Here’s a look at our market and target audience:
 * Massive Unmet Need: The addressable audience is enormous. Over 280 million people globally suffer from depression (that’s roughly 1 in 20 people), and that’s just one condition. Anxiety disorders affect even more. In the U.S. alone, 1 in 5 adults experience mental illness each year. This translates to tens of millions of English-speaking individuals actively looking for understanding, connection, and tools to cope. Importantly, it’s not just those diagnosed—friends, family, and anyone feeling overwhelmed by modern life are seeking relief. Traditional mental healthcare can’t scale to everyone, leaving a wide gap that accessible content can fill.
 * Cultural Shift (Why Now): We’re witnessing a cultural metamorphosis in attitudes toward mental wellness. Conversations that were once taboo are now mainstream. The pandemic, while tragic, triggered a 42% surge in listeners of health & mental health podcasts over four years as people sought solace and community online. Social media searches for mental health content are booming (around 200,000 monthly searches in the U.S. recently), indicating on-demand digital support is in high demand. Younger generations (Millennials, Gen Z) especially value authenticity and humor; they respond to brands that “keep it real” about mental health. This audience is fluent in the language of memes, dark comedy, and pop culture—exactly the milieu Kafka’s Kitchen embodies. There’s a growing appetite for the kind of authentic, edgy, yet uplifting content we offer.
 * Sizeable Market with Room to Innovate: Kafka’s Kitchen sits at the intersection of the booming mental wellness industry and the ever-growing digital content market. The global mental wellness market (covering services, apps, content, etc.) is already valued at about $166 billion in 2024 and is expected to exceed $250 billion by 2030. Within that, digital mental health content and platforms are a fast-rising segment. Consumers spend on meditation apps, self-improvement courses, and supportive communities—proving people will pay for solutions that help them feel better. Yet, no dominant player owns the “creative mental health storytelling” niche. We see a white space to capture: those who find traditional self-help either too corny, too clinical, or too expensive. By appealing to this broad swath of consumers with a novel approach, Kafka’s Kitchen can attract not just eyeballs but loyal, engaged users in a market that’s financially substantial and socially impactful.
 * Competitive Landscape: On one side, we have serious mental health apps (e.g. Calm, Headspace) and on the other, countless personal blogs or forums. There are also non-profits pushing awareness campaigns and a few media outlets doing occasional mental health pieces. What’s missing is a brand that combines entertainment and mental health support the way we do. We’re akin to a new genre: think of us as HBO meets therapy, or a storytelling “support group” that people actually look forward to attending. Below is a comparison of our approach versus conventional mental health content:
| Aspect | Kafka’s Kitchen (Our Approach) | Conventional Mental Health Media |
|---|---|---|
| Tone & Voice | Humorous, candid, literary flair (Kafka/Vonnegut/Pratchett influence). Embraces absurdity and honesty. | Serious, clinical or overly positive. Often avoids dark humor; can feel preachy or sugar-coated. |
| Content Style | Personal narratives and creative storytelling drawn from real struggles, mixed with satire and philosophy. Engaging and story-driven. | Predominantly advice-driven or factual content. May feel like lectures, listicles of tips, or dry statistics without personal connection. |
| Formats/Media | Multi-format: written essays, visual art, podcasts, interactive discussions—meeting people where they are (web, earphones, social media). | Mostly single-format: e.g., articles or videos. Little integration across media; limited interactive or multi-sensory engagement. |
| Community Engagement | Active community-building; readers become participants. Safe space for sharing personal stories, inspired by our content’s tone. Fosters a tribe feeling (or a Pratchett-esque fellowship) among users. | Minimal community or confined to comment sections. Users are mostly consumers, not contributors. Any community is often unmoderated or off-topic, lacking a unifying creative theme. |
| Philosophical Depth | Doesn’t shy away from life’s big questions. Acknowledges pain (a nod to Schopenhauer’s realism) while finding meaning and humor in it. Offers depth behind the laughs. | Generally sticks to surface-level coping tactics or generic encouragement. Avoids philosophical discussions; less likely to resonate on a deeper existential level. |
In essence, Kafka’s Kitchen stands out in a crowded market by delivering substance with style, and support with a smile. Our audience spans young adults to middle-aged readers/listeners globally who are literate, internet-savvy, and craving authenticity. Initially, we target English-speaking markets (North America and Europe, where mental health awareness is high), but our content’s themes are universal. Eventually, we can localize content for other languages/cultures. The opportunity is not just to ride the wave of mental wellness interest, but to help shape it—infusing it with creativity and humanity that keep people coming back.
Traction & Validation
While Kafka’s Kitchen is in its early stages, we’ve made promising progress in validating our concept:
 * Content Creation Underway: Our founder, Kai, has already published a series of personal essays under the Kafka’s Kitchen banner on blogging platforms. Essays like “The Fog of Depression” and “Procrastination Nation” (humorously detailing a day in the life of a depressed overthinker) have been met with enthusiastic responses. One piece about battling morning dread in a “monster chef show” analogy garnered hundreds of reads within a week of posting, with readers commenting that the story “felt like it was about me” and even “made me chuckle at my own anxiety”. This early content serves as a minimum viable product (MVP), demonstrating that our unique voice strikes a chord.
 * Social Media & Community Building: We’ve established a modest social media presence (Instagram, Twitter, TikTok) where we share inspiring quotes, darkly funny mini-stories, and behind-the-scenes looks at our creative process. Without any paid marketing, the Kafka’s Kitchen Instagram page reached its first 1,000 followers in just 2 months, purely through content resonance and word-of-mouth. We receive messages from followers eagerly anticipating our full launch and podcast. This organic growth indicates pent-up demand. It’s worth noting that user engagement is high—our posts routinely see above-average save and share rates, signaling that people are not just consuming, but finding value worth passing on.
 * Podcast Pilot in Production: We’ve scripted and recorded a pilot episode for Kafka’s Kitchen Podcast. In this pilot (“Episode 0: Introductions and Appetizers of Absurdity”), Kai shares her personal journey in a candid monologue—from feeling like a “bug” in society to reclaiming her narrative—interwoven with gentle comedy. Early test listeners (a small group of 20 volunteers from our online followers) gave encouraging feedback: 90% said the content was “very relatable,” and many noted the mix of humor and vulnerability kept them listening through the entire episode (which is a strong sign in today’s short-attention economy). We’re incorporating their feedback to fine-tune the format before a wider release. This pilot process has de-risked our podcast concept and built buzz among our core fans.
 * Partnership Interests: Even at this nascent stage, we’ve had initial conversations with a few mental health advocates and content creators who love our approach. For example, a psychology PhD student (and popular mental health YouTuber) reached out about possibly contributing an essay or appearing on the podcast, saying our approach “finally makes mental health content less boring.” Additionally, a small non-profit that runs depression support groups has expressed interest in sharing our stories in their newsletter, which could be a future distribution and cross-promotion channel. These signals show that our idea resonates not just with end-users, but also with potential collaborators and influencers in the space.
In summary, Kafka’s Kitchen has moved from concept to initial creation, and the early indicators are validating our hypothesis: people are hungry for this kind of content. The next step is to pour fuel on the fire—to go from a handful of blog posts and one pilot podcast to a consistent content schedule and scalable platform. Which brings us to our plan for making money and growing.
Business Model and Growth Strategy
Kafka’s Kitchen is designed as a for-profit social enterprise—we intend to do good and do well. Our business model is diversified across multiple revenue streams to ensure sustainability and scalability:
 * Freemium Content & Membership: All our basic content (weekly essays, art posts, regular podcast episodes) will be free to access, to build a broad audience quickly. We will then offer a subscription membership (monthly or annual) for superfans who want more. This Kafka’s Kitchen Club might include perks such as: exclusive bonus podcast episodes, members-only “deep dive” articles (e.g., extended interviews with psychologists or authors we admire), early access to new content, and a private community forum or Discord channel where members can interact directly with the team and each other. Platforms like Patreon or a custom paywall can facilitate this. This model has worked well for content creators in various niches—converting even a small fraction of a large free audience into paying members can generate significant revenue. For example, if just 5,000 fans pay ~$5/month, that’s $25k/month of steady income. We see this as achievable within a couple of years given the size of our potential audience and the loyalty engendered by deeply relatable content.
 * Advertising & Sponsorships: Once our podcast and site traffic hit critical mass, we will monetize through select sponsorships and ads. Importantly, we’ll be choosy to maintain authenticity. Think sponsors like mental health apps (online therapy services, meditation apps) or publishers of relevant books—partners who align with our mission. Podcast sponsorship in the mental health genre is a growing market (advertisers know that 91% of mental health podcast listeners have found these resources help manage their well-being, making them receptive to related products). With an estimated 500+ million podcast listeners worldwide by 2024, the ad market is booming. We forecast that with ~50k regular listeners, we could attract sponsors at ~$20-30 CPM, yielding a healthy revenue per episode. On the website, we may use gentle banner ads or affiliate links (for books, courses, etc.) that fit our content. Our promise: monetization will never overpower content; it’ll be like a light seasoning, not the main ingredient.
 * Content Licensing and Publishing: As our library of high-quality content grows, we can repurpose and monetize it in various forms. E-books or Print Collections of our best essays (“The Kafka’s Kitchen Companion: Stories of Hope and Absurdity”) could be sold. We anticipate strong interest in a book that compiles our unique take on mental wellness; even libraries or schools might pick it up as a resource. Additionally, we might syndicate select content to larger media outlets (imagine a column in a major magazine or a featured story in an anthology, with Kafka’s Kitchen getting paid for the contribution). Down the line, if we accumulate a large following, merchandise (like inspiring quote calendars, art prints of our photography with witty captions, or even a cheeky coffee mug that says “So it goes… but first coffee”) can create another revenue stream while boosting brand visibility. These are mid-term opportunities that turn our creativity into tangible products.
 * Workshops, Events & Services: With credibility and community established, we envision hosting paid workshops and events. For instance, an online workshop series on “Writing Your Way Out of Darkness”—teaching others to articulate their story (therapeutic writing, essentially)—could be ticketed. We could collaborate with mental health professionals to do creative therapy group sessions under our brand. In-person events could range from live podcast recordings to “Kafka’s Kitchen Meetup: an evening of storytelling and comedy” where community members share stories on stage. Such events not only produce revenue (ticket sales, sponsorship) but also deepen our impact and brand loyalty. Furthermore, there’s potential to offer consulting to companies or schools looking to address mental wellness in a creative way (e.g., designing a custom workshop for a corporate retreat). These service-oriented streams round out our model as we grow.
Growth Strategy: To achieve scale, we’ll follow a phased approach:
 * Build the Brand & Audience (Year 1): Focus on content quality and consistency. Publish new stories weekly, release podcast episodes biweekly. Aggressively grow our online community through social media campaigns, cross-promotions, and SEO for our blog (so those 200k monthly searchers for mental health content can find us). We’ll engage in relevant online forums (Reddit, mental health communities) to share valuable content without feeling “spammy”. The quirky brand personality will help word-of-mouth spread. Key goal: reach an audience of ~50k monthly website visitors and ~10k podcast listeners within 12-18 months, demonstrating product-market fit.
 * Monetize & Iterate (Year 2): Introduce the membership model and begin light monetization (a few sponsors, pilot the Patreon). Use data and feedback to refine what content resonates most. We will track metrics: engagement time, shares, conversion to membership. If, say, our satirical articles drive massive traffic, we’ll produce more of those; if the community forum buzzes whenever we pose a discussion question, we’ll double down on interactivity. Essentially, treat this year as optimization—improving content strategy and scaling revenue streams. By end of Year 2, aim for breaking even financially (covering our costs with revenue).
 * Scale Up (Year 3+): With proven monetization and a growing brand, seek larger expansion. This could involve seeking a Series A investment or reinvesting profits to hire additional creators (expanding beyond the founder’s voice to include other “chefs” in Kafka’s Kitchen), increasing content output, and possibly developing a mobile app to centralize the experience (combining content consumption and community features in one handy place). We might also explore international markets and translations (imagine Kafka’s Kitchen in Spanish or Hindi, partnering with local mental health storytellers). By Year 3 or 4, we target a user base in the millions and a solid revenue footing, making Kafka’s Kitchen a leader in creative mental health media.
Throughout these phases, our guiding star is impact: we measure success not just in revenue or user counts, but in engagement depth and testimonials. Every story shared by a user saying “this helped me” is fuel to our fire. And as we grow, that human impact will only amplify—a fact any impact-conscious investor can feel good about.
Team and Key Players
Our team may be small now, but it’s rich in passion, lived experience, and creative talent:
 * Kai “Spencer” G, Founder & Chief Storyteller: The visionary behind Kafka’s Kitchen, I am a writer, photographer, and speaker who has spent the last decade navigating my own mental health journey. After years on the road, literally traveling through different countries and metaphorically searching for meaning, I settled down to channel those experiences into this venture. My eclectic background includes freelance writing for travel and lifestyle blogs, which honed my narrative voice, and volunteer work at mental health nonprofits, which deepened my understanding of the community’s needs. I often joke that I have a “PhD in personal chaos, with honors in dark humor.” In truth, it’s my empathy and authenticity that shine—when I talk or write, people know it’s real. I cite Franz Kafka, Kurt Vonnegut, and Terry Pratchett as my literary north stars, which explains the unique flavor of Kafka’s Kitchen. As CEO (Chief Epic Officer, as we like to say), I drive content creation, engage with our growing audience, and set the strategic vision. My ability to articulate the hard-to-express feelings and then find laughter in them is the keystone of our brand.
 * Advisors & Collaborators: We are building a network of informal advisors who believe in Kafka’s Kitchen. This includes:
   * Mental Health Advisor: Dr Elena R, a licensed psychologist (and self-professed book nerd) who advises us to ensure our content is sensitive and does no harm. She double-checks that our comedic approach remains respectful of mental health realities. Dr Elena also provides input on psychological insights that might benefit our audience.
   * Creative Mentor: Alex M, a published novelist and friend of Kai’s, who provides feedback on story ideas and helps refine our storytelling to be compelling and clear. Alex’s experience in publishing and media is a valuable compass as we grow content into products.
   * Technical Advisor: Jordan L, a former product manager at a mental health app, who is advising on our future app development and data analytics approach (to personalize content recommendations, for example). Jordan ensures we’re tech-ready for scale when the time comes.
   These advisors are not full-time staff, but they are in our corner and will likely transition into formal roles or board positions post-investment. As we secure funding, one of our first steps is to hire a community manager (to nurture our budding community) and a part-time audio producer for the podcast (to polish production quality). We know that assembling a talented, passionate team is crucial, and we have a roster of interested candidates ready to hop on once resources allow.
Why this Team? Because lived experience and storytelling finesse beat a fancy resume in this domain. Investors often look at the jockey as much as the horse—here, you have a founder who is deeply entrenched in the problem space, essentially her own target audience, which means an intrinsic understanding of what content will connect. Combine that with a creative skill set and a supportive cast of advisors, and you get a team that can execute the vision. We may be newbies in startup terms, but we’re veterans in fighting the very problems we aim to solve, and that motivation is a force of nature. As Terry Pratchett might quip, “You can’t make a good stew without a good cook”—and we’ve got one heck of a cook in Kafka’s Kitchen.
The Investment Opportunity
Kafka’s Kitchen is not just a creative venture; it’s a scalable business poised at the crossroads of a huge market and a meaningful mission. We are seeking an investment of $200,000 in seed funding to help turn our early momentum into a roaring fire. Here’s how we plan to use these funds and why it’s a compelling opportunity:
Use of Funds:
 * Content Production & Expansion (40%)—We’ll invest in equipment, software, and talent to dramatically increase our content output quality. This means better audio gear and editing software for the podcast, graphic design tools for our visual posts, and modest stipends for guest contributors to bring diverse voices into our mix. A portion will also support publishing our first book compilation (covering editing, design, printing for initial copies) to create a new revenue stream.
 * Technology & Platform (20%)—Development of a user-friendly website and community platform will be accelerated. We’ll hire a freelance web developer to refine our site for scalability (including member login systems for the subscription model) and lay groundwork for a mobile app. We’ll also implement analytics tools to gather data on user engagement, guiding our content strategy with precision.
 * Marketing & Growth (30%)—This covers strategic marketing campaigns to substantially grow our audience. We’ll allocate budget for content marketing (possibly collaborating with popular mental health influencers for guest posts or shout-outs), social media ads targeting likely community members (e.g., people interested in mental health and humor), and search engine marketing to capture those seeking help online. Additionally, we plan to attend key mental health and creative industry events or conferences, to network and promote Kafka’s Kitchen directly. This budget ensures that our signal rises above the noise.
 * Operations & Runway (10%)—Basic operational expenses and buffer: web hosting, podcast hosting, legal setup, and a contingency reserve. While lean, this ensures we can run smooth for the next 18-24 months without constantly worrying about cash, allowing the team to focus on building value.
Revenue and Returns: With the above fuel, our conservative projections show Kafka’s Kitchen reaching $500k+ in annual revenue by Year 3, derived from the blended streams of membership, ads, and content sales. Given the low overhead nature of digital content, profit margins can be healthy once initial scale is reached. Investors could see a return through either profit dividends (if we choose to stay private and sustainable) or through an exit—for example, a larger media company or mental health platform could acquire Kafka’s Kitchen for its brand and community (the space is active with acquisitions as big players seek authentic content—a precedent being Headspace acquiring creative wellness apps, etc). We estimate a potential 5-10x return on seed investment within 5 years, based on comparable media startup trajectories and our growth plan.
But beyond the numbers, consider the impact ROI: By investing in Kafka’s Kitchen, you are championing a cause that literally saves and improves lives. Imagine being a part of destigmatizing mental illness for a generation, of turning lonely nights into communal campfires of storytelling. Our success means thousands—even millions—of people empowered to face another day, to seek help, to laugh in spite of it all. There’s a burgeoning market for “mental wellness with personality,” and we’re leading the charge. Investors often talk about moats in business—our moat is that we deeply understand our audience’s psyche and have a brand voice that truly resonates, which is hard to replicate. With your support, we will convert that into sustainable growth.
Why Invest Now? We’re at the cusp of something special. The content is striking a nerve, the audience is growing, and the space is ripe for innovation. Early investment accelerates our timeline, locking in a first-mover advantage in this niche. It also means you get in at the ground floor valuation, maximizing upside. We’ve proven out the concept on a shoestring; with proper funding, the sky’s the limit. Together, we can capture this market white space before others catch on—building not just a business, but a brand that people love dearly (and that’s the kind of brand that endures and profits for the long haul).
Conclusion: Stirring a Revolution in Mental Wellness
In conclusion, Kafka’s Kitchen is more than a business idea—it’s a movement to rewrite the narrative on mental health. We mix the earnest with the absurd, the data with the personal, the pain with the laughter. In a world that can often feel like “one damn thing after another” (so it goes), we’re crafting a sanctuary where each damn thing can be dissected, understood, and even chuckled at.
Picture the impact a year from now: a young woman, who felt alone in her depression, now starts her morning listening to our podcast and realizes “I’m not alone after all”. A burned-out office worker reads one of our satirical articles during lunch, lets out a genuine laugh, and decides to share it with his friend who’s struggling. A college student attends our online workshop, writes her first short story about her anxiety monster, and feels a weight lift off her chest. These are the lives we’re already touching in small numbers; with your investment, we can scale this impact to countless more.
From an investor’s viewpoint, we offer a rare combination: a strong business case in a booming market and a product that genuinely helps people. Our approach is innovative and our foundation is solidly laid. The literary and comedic influences we channel aren’t just gimmicks—they are a proven way to engage an audience that’s craving authenticity. By subtly weaving in philosophy and bold humor, we ensure our content isn’t just another disposable scroll in the feed; it’s something people hold onto, talk about, and build a community around.
We invite you to join us on this ambitious journey. By investing in Kafka’s Kitchen, you’re pulling up a chair at the table where a new conversation about mental health is being served. It’s a conversation that’s inclusive, irreverent, and irrepressibly hopeful. As Vonnegut might toast, “If this isn’t nice, what is?”—a venture that nourishes the human spirit while yielding healthy returns is as nice as it gets.
Kafka’s Kitchen is ready to stir the pot. We hope you’ll add your ingredients to this recipe for change. Together, let’s turn the trials of life into a tale of triumph—one story, one laugh, one plate of metaphorical goulash at a time.
Thank you for reading, and we look forward to cooking up success (and plenty of soul-soothing smiles) with you.

Maintaining healthy gums is crucial for overall oral health, and your diet plays a significant role in preventing gum disease. Millions of people struggle with periodontal issues, often without realizing that certain foods can dramatically increase their risk of inflammation, infection, and tooth loss. The foods you consume can either protect or harm your gum health, making it essential to understand which dietary choices can support or compromise your oral wellness. Click here to learn more: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com

Understanding Gum Disease and Dietary Impact

Gum disease is a serious condition that affects the soft tissue and bone supporting your teeth. It begins with bacterial growth in the mouth and can progress from mild inflammation to severe damage if left untreated. Nutrition plays a critical role in either combating or contributing to this potential health threat.

Foods That Promote Gum Disease

1. Sugary and Processed Foods

Sugar is a primary culprit in gum disease development. These foods create an ideal environment for harmful bacteria to thrive:

• Candies and sweet snacks
• Carbonated soft drinks
• Processed baked goods
• Refined carbohydrates

When sugar remains on teeth, bacteria feed on it, producing acid that destroys tooth enamel and irritates gum tissue. Click here to learn more: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com

2. Acidic Foods and Beverages

Highly acidic foods can erode tooth enamel and irritate gum tissue, increasing vulnerability to infection:

• Citrus fruits
• Tomato-based products
• Vinegar-based dressings
• Wine and certain alcoholic beverages
• Coffee

These foods can weaken the protective barriers in your mouth, making gums more susceptible to bacterial invasion.

3. Sticky and Starchy Foods

Foods that stick to teeth create prolonged exposure to harmful bacteria:

• Dried fruits
• White bread
• Potato chips
• Crackers
• Granola bars

These items can get trapped between teeth, providing a breeding ground for bacteria that cause gum inflammation.

Nutritional Strategies for Gum Health

Replacing harmful foods with gum-protective alternatives is crucial. Consider incorporating these nutrient-rich options:

• **Crunchy vegetables**
• Dairy products rich in calcium
• Lean proteins
• Green tea
• Water

Hydration and Oral Health

Drinking adequate water helps:
• Flush away food particles
• Stimulate saliva production
• Reduce bacterial growth
• Maintain overall oral moisture

The Impact of Nutrition on Gum Inflammation

Research shows that certain dietary choices can directly influence gum health. A study published in the Journal of Clinical Periodontology found that individuals with poor nutrition were 70% more likely to develop advanced gum disease.

Key Nutrients for Gum Protection

1. Vitamin C
2. Omega-3 fatty acids
3. Calcium
4. Vitamin D
5. Antioxidants

These nutrients help strengthen gum tissue, reduce inflammation, and support immune response. Click here to learn more: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com

Practical Tips for Dietary Gum Protection

• Limit sugar intake
• Choose whole foods
• Practice thorough oral hygiene
• Regular dental check-ups
• Stay hydrated
• Consume anti-inflammatory foods

Understanding Your Individual Risk

Every person's oral health is unique. Factors like genetics, overall health, and existing medical conditions can influence gum disease susceptibility. Consulting with a dental professional can provide personalized dietary recommendations.

Long-Term Gum Health Strategies

Preventing gum disease isn't just about avoiding certain foods—it's about creating a comprehensive approach to oral wellness. Combining smart dietary choices with excellent oral hygiene and regular professional care offers the best protection against periodontal issues.

Conclusion

Protecting your gums requires a holistic approach that combines nutrition, hygiene, and professional care. By understanding which foods to avoid and which to embrace, you can significantly reduce your risk of gum disease. Remember that small, consistent dietary changes can make a substantial difference in your oral health journey, empowering you to maintain a healthy, vibrant smile for years to come.",1,1748381874.0,Teethgumhealth,0,1.0,False

# The Revelation That Changed Everything

It was 2:30 PM on a Tuesday when my friend Ivana called me, frustration evident in her voice. As a Product Owner, he’d just walked out of what should have been a routine Sprint Review. Her developers had delivered everything on the backlog—every feature, every user story, technically complete. Yet as they demonstrated the new login functionality to stakeholders, something felt terribly off.

“The stakeholders weren’t happy,” Ivana explained during our coffee meeting later that week. “Yes, users could log in, but the error messages were full of technical jargon that would confuse our elderly users. I had written acceptance criteria, but somehow we missed this completely.”

As someone with a [**testing background**](https://www.whatisscrum.org/software-testing-mastery-in-scrum/), I could see the issue immediately. “Ivana,” I said, “your developers built exactly what you requested, but your acceptance criteria weren’t thinking like a tester. You defined the ‘what’ but not the ‘how it should feel’ for users.”

That conversation became the turning point for Ivana’s approach to being a Product Owner. Over the following months, I helped her understand how [**testing principles**](https://www.whatisscrum.org/software-testing-mastery-in-scrum/) could transform her effectiveness, even though he’d never write a single test case.

# The Hand of Quality

In the Scrum Framework, we often think of testing as the developer’s domain. After all, they write the code, they run the tests, they fix the bugs. But watching Ivana’s journey taught me a fundamental truth: [**understanding testing principles makes you an exponentially better Product Owner**](https://www.whatisscrum.org/software-testing-mastery-in-scrum/), even if you never write a single test case.

Unlike traditional waterfall approaches, where testing happens at the end, Scrum weaves testing throughout each Sprint. Here’s what I helped Ivana discover—once she understood how her decisions influenced testing, her ability to deliver real user value skyrocketed.

# How I Helped Ivana Transform Her PO Skills Through Testing

# 1. From Vague Stories to Testing Blueprints

“I don’t understand,” Ivana confided after another frustrating Sprint Review. “I write user stories like everyone teaches: ‘As a user, I want to log in securely.’ But developers keep coming back with questions, and our Sprint Reviews feel chaotic.”

I sat down with Ivana and showed her [**how to think like a tester**](https://www.whatisscrum.org/software-testing-mastery-in-scrum/) while writing stories. “Every user story you write should become a [**precise testing blueprint**](https://www.whatisscrum.org/software-testing-mastery-in-scrum/),” I explained. “Instead of just ‘log in securely,’ try this: ‘login succeeds with valid credentials within 2 seconds’ and ‘displays helpful error message for invalid attempts within 1 second.'”

The change was immediate. Ivana’s next set of stories was crystal clear, and her developers stopped the constant back-and-forth questions. More importantly, her stakeholders could finally visualize exactly what was being built. “My stories became contracts that everyone understood,” Ivana told me months later.

# 2. From Observer to Quality Validator

“I feel like a fraud during Sprint Reviews,” Ivana admitted over lunch. “I watch developers demo features and nod if they look ‘right,’ but I don’t really know if they’re actually working for users.”

I introduced Ivana to the concept of validation versus observation. “Your real job during Sprint Reviews isn’t to watch—it’s to test,” I explained. “You need to ask: ‘Does this increment deliver the value our users actually need?'”

I taught Ivana to approach Sprint Reviews as testing sessions. Instead of passive observation, she learned to click through features, try edge cases, and coordinate hands-on testing with real stakeholders. The transformation was remarkable.

“Last month, during our customer dashboard Sprint Review, I caught something crucial,” Ivana shared excitedly. “The charts displayed correctly, but the loading sequence confused users. My new [**testing mindset**](https://www.whatisscrum.org/software-testing-mastery-in-scrum/) caught this before it reached production. We saved weeks of potential rework.”

# 3. From Feature Factory to Strategic Quality Investor

Ivana called me frustrated after a particularly heated stakeholder meeting. “They’re pushing for more features, but my developers keep talking about technical debt and test coverage. I don’t know how to balance this.”  
This was the perfect teaching moment. I explained to her how understanding testing economics could make her a more strategic Product Owner. “When your developers identify the need for better test coverage, don’t see it as ‘non-feature work’—see it as essential quality investment.”

I helped Ivana make a tough decision that initially frustrated her stakeholders: prioritizing automated regression tests over two minor feature requests. “I was nervous,” she admitted, “but you helped me see the bigger picture.”

The payoff was dramatic. “Our deployment confidence increased immediately,” she reported three months later. “We actually delivered more value to users because we weren’t constantly firefighting bugs. Understanding testing economics made me a strategic Product Owner instead of just a feature prioritizer.”

# 4. From Reactive Clarifier to Proactive Edge Case Thinker

“I’m constantly interrupted by developer questions,” she complained during one of our mentoring sessions. “‘What should happen if a user enters special characters in the email field?’ they ask, and I scramble to figure out the answer.”

I taught Ivana how a [**testing mindset**](https://www.whatisscrum.org/software-testing-mastery-in-scrum/) could make her proactive instead of reactive. “When you write stories, think through edge cases, boundary conditions, and error scenarios from the start,” I advised. “Anticipate the questions developers will ask by thinking like a tester.”

The transformation was remarkable. Within a few sprints, Ivana’s backlog refinement sessions became focused conversations instead of constant clarification marathons. “My stories are clearer, development is smoother, and our Sprint commitments are more reliable,” she reported.

# How This Transformed Ivana’s Effectiveness as a Product Owner

Watching her journey taught me [**how powerful testing knowledge**](https://www.whatisscrum.org/software-testing-mastery-in-scrum/) can be for Product Owners. She didn’t learn to write test scripts or execute test plans, but [**understanding testing principles**](https://www.whatisscrum.org/software-testing-mastery-in-scrum/) amplified every aspect of her role:

* **Stakeholder Communication**: Ivana could finally explain exactly what “done” meant in terms that business stakeholders understood
* **Risk Management:** She could identify potential quality issues before they became expensive problems
* **Team Collaboration:** She learned to speak the same language as developers when discussing technical quality concerns
* **User Advocacy:** She could better represent user needs by thinking through all the ways features might fail users

“You helped me realize that my influence on testing is indirect but incredibly powerful,” Ivana reflected during our last coffee meeting. “I don’t write tests, but I shape every testing decision. I’m the voice of the user in every quality conversation.”

# Quality Transformation Toolkit

Ready to elevate your Product Owner’s impact on software quality? Here are three immediate actions you can implement:

# Tool 1: The Acceptance Criteria Audit (This Week)

**What to do:** Review your last five user stories and evaluate their acceptance criteria against these questions:

* Are they specific and measurable?
* Do they cover both positive and negative scenarios?
* Can a tester create test cases directly from them?
* Do they define what “done” means from a user perspective?

**Assignment**: Rewrite one poorly defined user story with comprehensive acceptance criteria. Include performance expectations, error handling requirements, and user experience standards.

# Tool 2: The Quality Conversation Framework (Next Sprint Planning)

**What to do:** During your next Sprint Planning, implement the “[**Testing Lens**](https://www.whatisscrum.org/software-testing-mastery-in-scrum/)” discussion for each user story:

* “How will we know this works correctly?”
* “What could go wrong for our users?”

# The Mentoring Relationship That Changed Everything

Helping Ivana discover the connection between testing and effective Product Ownership taught me [**something profound**](https://www.whatisscrum.org/software-testing-mastery-in-scrum/): the most successful Scrum teams understand that software quality isn’t owned by one role—it’s a partnership. Developers bring technical testing expertise, Scrum Masters facilitate quality conversations, and Product Owners define what quality means in the context of user value.

Ivana learned that she might not write the tests, but she authored the quality story. She’s the voice of the user in every testing decision, the guardian of value in every Sprint Review, and the strategic mind behind every quality investment.

“You helped me understand that[ **learning to think like a tester**](https://www.whatisscrum.org/software-testing-mastery-in-scrum/) while acting as a Product Owner has been one of the most powerful skill combinations I could develop,” she told me recently. “I’m more confident, more effective, and my team trusts my decisions because they see the thoughtfulness behind them.”

If you’re a Product Owner struggling with similar challenges, start with a simple question: “How can [**understanding testing principles**](https://youtu.be/90A1fui8sno?si=HiUDSs8vLBc3MWld) (WATCH THE VIDEO) make me better at my job?” The answer might just transform your entire approach to the role.

*Sometimes the best way to help someone grow is to show them how all the pieces fit together. Ivana’s transformation reminded me that the most impactful quality improvements often come from understanding the connections between roles, not just mastering individual skills.*",1,1748381745.0,u_dejansoftware1,0,1.0,False

My doc gave me a diagnosis of orthostatic intolerance and prescribed me some compression socks

I also had low ferritin of 24, I was able to get it up to 33 taking a pre-natal vitamin with iron and iron rich foods but I still feel terrible all the time. I’m exhausted, get dizzy/faint, anxious, cold, brain fog, short of breath. I recently started taking a heme iron three arrows something or other I read about here along with vitamin C (no dairy or tea/coffee) 

It sounds like there’s a connection between heavy periods and low ferritin. I have extremely heavy periods. Is there a point in supplementing/trying for infusions? Would be it be better to try to address the heavy periods first? 

My OBGYN put me on bc to try to help, but I had to stop taking bc it worsened my symptoms. I later read estrogen is a vasodilator so it can worsen orthostatic issues 

I’d love input from anyone who has dealt with these issues. I feel like my doc and OBGYN are a clueless about both. I’m on a year-long waiting list to see a POTS specialist. My quality of life is so poor right now ",3,1748381706.0,Anemic,2,1.0,False

Should be easy, right? But it’s not, because

1.    published information from Tchibo doesn’t include the necessary data and

2.    when asked, Tchibo provided incorrect information

The INEI (Italian National Espresso Institute) recommended amount of ground coffee in an espresso shot is 7+/-0.5 grams. And, therefore **14 +/- 1 g for a double shot**.

How much ground coffee is in a Tchibo espresso shot is not published. I asked the company and received the following answer: *“An espresso shot typically uses about 19-23 grams of ground coffee….booting up the coffee can increase the up to 26 grams of ground coffee”.*

When I challenged this by showing numbers from SCA (Specialty Coffee Association) and INEI (Italian National Espresso Institute), Tchibo stood by the answer and wrote: *“we encourage you to verify them directly .. by conducting a hands-on measurement”.*

So I did just that: I measured several shots (with boost and without boost). After letting the discarded puck dry overnight (to exclude any water remnants) I weighed the ground coffee and I found the following:

Standard shot: 11 g

**With boost: 13 g**

My scale is just a simple kitchen scale so the measurements are not very precise. But the discrepancy with the numbers given by Tchibo (19-23 and 26, respectively) is huge.

And the answer to the question “How to make a double shot with Tchibo espresso machine?” is: **use single shot with boost**.

1kwziie,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kwziie,Neighborhood Exploration - Polish Village,"I've been in Chicago for a few years now and for a while I've been wanting to more regularly explore new neighborhoods. I finally got around to creating a random wheel with the 200+ neighborhoods and the first place it sent me was Polish Village (which Google told me was roughly between Diversey and and Addison and the train tracks and the highway). If you're interested here is a recap of my Sunday in the neighborhood:

Took the red line to the blue line and got off at Logan Square and walked up Milwaukee Ave. Got coffee at the horror movie themed The Brewed and noticed a horror themed store across the street too. It wasn't open but I'll probably bring my mom to both places sometime since she is a horror buff. 

Stopped in the Skunk Cabbage book store which was cute and gay (always appreciated) and continued walking along Milwaukee and enjoying the nice weather. Came across Kozys Cyclery which was great because I had been meaning to buy a phone mount for my bike, so did some shopping there. 

Once I reached Addison I walked down to Pulaski and stopped in at the first bar I came across called Teddy Bear Lounge. I was the only one for a minute but then some regulars showed up and I had a good time chatting with Jackie & Gill. Jackie's 91 year old mom showed up and bought me a drink (thanks Ma!) and after a THC & alcoholic beverages I said goodbye to the kind folks at Teddy Bear Lounge and walked to Staropolska for some polish food.

The restaurant was....fine. Definitely the low light of the day and I dont think I would go back there.

Afterwards I walked to Loaf Lounge (which has its own Wikipedia page!) for dessert and was excited to see strawberry rhubarb goodies available. My grandma made strawberry rhubarb pie growing up and it's one of my favorites. I got the cookie pictured and I legit almost cried after the first bite from nostalgia/it tasting so good/me being stoned. 

Overall I spent 4+ hours walking around the neighborhood looking at murals, gardens, the two polish churches, and just enjoying the sunny weather before heading back home

1kwzf6x,https://www.reddit.com/r/FattyLiverNAFLD/comments/1kwzf6x/advice/,Advice,"Hello!
I was diagnosed with Fatty Liver found by accident on an abdominal scan after pregnancy summer of 2024. 
My enzymes were 13 and 15 roughly (ALT and AST) and all labs (CBC and WBC) were in range. No symptoms whatsoever. 
I am a type 1 diabetic and have been on the heavier side since I had my first kid in 2024. I played sports up until pregnancy and hiked frequently. At 5’6, pure muscle, I was about 175. When I started losing some muscle, I was about 165. After pregnancy, I hovered around 210 with a small reprieve down to 188 before my second pregnancy. I am 11 months post partum, and hovering around 205. 
I understand that losing weight will be a huge contributing factor to kicking this fatty liver. I also have taken milk thistle nearly every evening in my tea, and dandelion root tea or tincture about twice a week. 
I just had labs done and my alt and ast were both 11. I still have no liver symptoms. I have drank about 2 beers every other day for a few months over the last 6. Now down to only drinking 2 days of the week. I hope to quit eventually as alcoholism runs in the family. And I know this will also help the liver. 
I am on insulin, and Methimazole for Graves’ disease, as well as Vyvanse for ADD. I drink water, zevia, coffee, tea, and kombucha only. 
I have started a low(ish) carb diet with only about 50-60 carbs daily. This consists of protein smoothies with real fruit, lots of chicken, rice, salads, and sometimes some potatoes or beef. I absolutely avoid food dyes, high fructose corn syrup, and ultra processed grains at all costs. It has done wonders for my bloodsugar control. My a1c has dropped from 7.2 to 6.7. 
I am lightly active, usually up and doing things with my kids and lots of walking but nothing else yet. 
I guess what I’m looking for is some hope. I understand the changes that need to be made: little to no alcohol, cleaner diet, losing weight. I have severe health anxiety after having babies and this terrifies me to the point of panic attacks, nightmares, and insomnia. I’m feeling a bit helpless as I’ve lost only 2 lbs after a month of low carb and more activity. I have to wait till at least 1 year to get another ultrasound of the abdomen to check my liver. I guess I’m curious if it’s still possible to eliminate fatty liver altogether as a type 1 diabetic? I am grateful that my liver enzymes have never elevated but I know that they probably will at some point unless I can kick this. (Edit:first kid was in 2022).

But seriously, I’m an extra on the show and have been fortunate to be invited back several times to play the Maitre D at St. Claire’s Grill.  Now that the season is over I can talk a little bit about it.  

While I don’t have any plot information (and wouldn’t share if I did—NDA), I can say a few things about my experience. 

Firstly, the studio (Assembly Studios in Doraville, metro Atlanta) is really nice. It’s shiny and new with very comfortable dressing rooms. The food on set is amazing!  I have to watch my weight for a few days before filming in order to partake in such deliciousness, lol.  

The cast and crew are tight. Many say it’s one of the best sets they’ve worked on and that it’s like a family.  They have been super sweet to us, the extras, and I’m really hoping the show gets picked up for another season. 

I’m also hoping (more like dreaming) that my “character” will become an actual character on the show. I took on-camera acting classes during the season and, fingers crossed, maybe it will help.  My acting teachers are Catherine Dyer (Stranger Things) and her husband Jason MacDonald (Vampire Diaries) at Drama Inc. in Atlanta. 

I’ve met about half the cast, and they all were super nice. Sometimes they eat with the crew and extras during meals.  Occasionally I get to chat a little when they are at craft services getting a coffee or snack. However, most of the time we leave them alone, of course, so we don’t mess up their groove. Acting on camera is much harder than it looks and they need to stay in the zone, so-to-speak. 

So far I’ve met (by character name): Catherine, Alice, Doug, Brett, Tucker, Josh, Birdie, Connor, Cricket, and Misty. I also met Kenny (Randy Havens) on a different show. 

Everyone is super friendly, I met a lot of cool people, and it’s been a ton of fun. Here are a couple photos that I can show without violating the NDA. I included a pic of one of the meals for fun, and the last pic is a screenshot from TV. You can see me standing in the corner like a lamp. 😂

1kwzahf,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawyerAdvice/comments/1kwzahf/spilled_coffee_burned_my_baby/,spilled coffee burned my baby.,"So this weekend we were driving down to Tennessee to spend a nice relaxing weekend at a cabin. I have an 11 month old baby girl who is just abled to sit in a high chair. We stopped at a well known sit down chain restaurant. After getting settled and being handed at least 6 menus between the 4 of us we started to figured out what we wanted. Well my husband ordered coffee, and the server decided to try to pour it in front of my daughter then hand it to my husband. It was like watching something in slow motion. Her fingers grabbed the porcelain coffee cup and it immediately spilled all over her!


I stood up ripped her onesie off her and ran outside to my van. I quickly took baby wipes dipped them in my water I had and started draping her in cooled baby wipes. I then ripped her diaper off and just held my burned daughter against my chest with both of us sobbing in the parking lot. NO ONE came out to check, the server saw it. The lady near to us saw it. The server even said, let me get you napkins(like that would help).

Eventually my husband came out and said he asked for neosporin and no one knew what that was. I just sat inside my van holding my burned baby covered in water soaked wet wipes. Finally the manager came out with some linacaine spray. And basically said sorry. Needless to say my daughter now has 2nd degree burns a on her wrist and thigh. I think I minimized the damage done bc I covered her in antibacterial vaseline and cold wet wipes for the next several hours. 


The manager knows the incident happened bc he gave me lidocaine spray. I am now nursing her burns as best I can. I took her to an urgent care a little ways outside of the location where the incident happened. They did not do much. 

Does anything legally happen now? I’m not trying to sue or anything. I’ve just never been involved in a situation like that. I don’t have health insurance but I wanted to make sure my child would be ok so I took her to urgent care just to make sure. I would assume I have to pay?

1kwz8ub,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychopath/comments/1kwz8ub/childhood_trauma_and_psychopathy/,Childhood trauma and psychopathy,"Is there a definitive correlation between nature vs nurture and psychopathy? It seems most people who suffer from psychopathy have one underlying connection. Mainly the way they might have suffered through life as a child. 

Even the wealthy children who end up like this go through something that equates to neglect from a parent in a way that fractured their mind, combined with abuse from a trusted person. I get there are people born without the proper synapse firing to not understand what is right and what isn't and impulse control becomes a faint thought. But I'm not sure that lashing out for Mommy's approval is so much psychopathy as it is desperation for recognition.

But those who suffer physical, mental and sexual abuse are a different story. Especially at a young age. 

For instance. I remember that once visiting my grandmother (dads side, my mother's mom died long before I was born) I was being a rambunctious 5-8 year old. My dad did nothing to correct me at the time so my grandma asked me if I wanted a piece of candy. I obliged and got smacked across the face and told to sit on my hands on the couch. 

My own mother beat the shit outta me because my younger brother didn't do his homework while she was at work. I was in highschool when this happened likely 9th grade. I just remembered having to go to school with my face and body hurting from being punched repeatedly. 

My quote unquote best friend when I was 12 sexually assaulted me out of nowhere and told me if I said anything he would tell everyone I was gay and tried to have sex with him. 

(Side note) When I was 20 I found out a drug dealer was looking for him because he owed the dealer several hundred dollars to flip some drugs. So I told the dealer where he was living and he got fucked up pretty bad. They both thought it was for the drug money. It wasn't. 

My uncle dislocated my left shoulder because I touched the remote when I was in fourth grade. Nothing happened to him. Though he did end up getting dementia and died. Not good enough, but he deserved it. 

When I was in the third grade my father threw me into a coffee table because I could only find one of my flip flops. 

My sister broke my nose on purpose. And I have orchestrated the sale of my dead mothers house so she can no longer mooch off the family. Next month it goes to auction. 

Because I was poor growing up everyone else thought I was trash because I didn't have new clothes or a dirt bike, or kept moving every six months because we were getting evicted again. 

The amount of times I've been physically assaulted because I was poor is alarming. I didn't get it, I wasn't even old enough to work but it was my fault? 

Then, my mom married a wealthy man. And it got 10 times worse. This was highschool 11th grade, this fucking guy, ruled his home with an iron fist. He beat the shit out of his 3 kids and me. When summer hit, the proper thing to do was make me and my step brother move rocks from one side of the property to the other, Dig trenches, plant trees, detail the company truck, build fences, paint, fill in holes ect. 

My step sister and him got into it one day and he kicked her out. So me and my step brother moved her out to her mom's house.

Alcohol and binge drinking (beer and liquor) I also used to smoke weed and tobacco daily (stopped that a 8 months ago).

- sleep 8 hrs every night 
- exercise more (weights and body weight exercise)
- eat cleaner (cook all my meals - red meat, eggs, fruits nuts and seed vegetables) and get more copper 
- no coffee 
- drink way less ( once every month or every 2 months)
- big clean up of house once a week and make an effort to do a bit of cleaning day to day.
- try not to stress at work and focus on breathing.

Before coffee.  
Before tea.  
Before your phone or your inbox…

**Drink water first.**  
Just one glass.

Start your day with **hydration before stimulation** — it’s one of the simplest ways to reset your body and mind.

**Why it works:**

* Rehydrates your body after hours of sleep
* Supports energy, digestion, and focus
* Helps prevent the jitters and crashes from caffeine
* Signals your body: *“We’re starting the day right.”*

**Pep Talk:**  
*“Fuel your body like it matters — because it does. One small glass of water tells your brain: ‘I’m showing up today. Let’s go.’”*

**Try it tomorrow morning.**

(Girl's night),"Last weekend, something unexpected happened that I can’t stop thinking about. My friend Sarah (Changed name) texted me, suggesting a girls’ night out with a few drinks. We met at a local bar. A couple of drinks in, I was feeling happy, just nicely buzzed.

After a fun night, we decided to head out. I called a cab to get home, and Sarah asked if I could drop her off at her place on the way. But halfway there, she changed her mind. “Hey, since you’re alone at home, mind if I crash at your place? I don’t want to wake anyone at mine.” I thought it sounded fun, so I agreed.

When we reached to my house, we kicked off our shoes and crashed onto the couch, still chatting and laughing. Sarah started getting a bit close, resting her hand on my arm. I didn’t think much of it; I was still in that carefree, tipsy mood. I got up to grab some water from the kitchen, and she followed. Before I knew it, things took a turn. She started touching me more, her hands wandering in a way that caught me off guard. She grabbed my breasts, I froze for a second, not sure how to react, but I didn’t stop her. Maybe it was the alcohol, maybe it was the moment, but it felt okay. Then she reached under my dress and started fingering me quite vigorously, I had few orgasms just standing there.

Afterward, we said goodnight, and went to our separate rooms to sleep. The next morning, I woke up to find Sarah gone— no text. It felt a little odd, and I wondered if she was embarrassed once the alcohol wore off. I got ready for the day and called my husband to tell him about the night. He was surprised but excited, joking about rushing home from his shift to go few rounds.

I wanted to check in with Sarah, so I texted her to meet for coffee. She agreed, and we met at the cafe. She showed up wearing big sunglasses, clearly avoiding eye contact and looking uncomfortable. I could tell she was worried I’d be upset. To break the tension, I smiled and said, “You know, that’s only the second time something like that’s happened to me, and I didn’t mind it.” Her face lit up with relief. For next few minutes she kept convincing me how straight she is (which i don't care). We both laughed it off, and soon we were back to our usual chatter.

I’m seriously considering investing in a self-service coffee bar franchise called Touch Coffee — they offer automated, 24/7 coffee kiosks with no staff needed, just daily maintenance and restocking. The model seems promising, with an upfront investment of around CA$20K and potential ROI in 6–9 months if the location is right.

They claim they already have 60+ locations across Canada and are expanding in the U.S. and Europe. I’m based in Ontario and exploring this as a scalable side business - maybe even grow it into multiple units.

Anyone here operated one of these or seen them in action? Curious to hear any first-hand feedback on:
	•	Actual daily sales volume vs claimed numbers
	•	Maintenance hassles or hidden costs
	•	Location negotiation support
	•	Customer adoption and repeat use
	•	How it compares to traditional vending or coffee shop models

We sell amazing ethically sourced coffee beans in whole bean or ground, with a twist. Some of our profits go straight back into educating farmers on better farming methods that protect parrot species, and we give money to parrot conservation charities. I know no one cares about parrot really, but they’re integral to so many ecosystems and the Amazon rainforest. Each coffee is represented by an iconic parrot that lives where those beans are grown, so the coffee you drink is tied directly to the cause you’re helping. 

We have a coffee truck and a flock of free flying macaws, and we intend to visit Lancashire and its rolling hills to serve coffee whilst you watch my rescued macaws fly freely all around you.

Recently I moved from my home town, to reside with him in his, an hour and half away, moving my son schools and living in his home.
I adore the man, and despite having a few hiccups along the way I have always felt this was the place I wanted to end up being, despite it being a small sacrifice leaving behind my family and friends and starting over here. I truly felt that having nobody here and moving my life to share his would show him he’s my absolute number 1.

Fast forward to now, and I have had another long term friend (F36) who I’ve remained in close contact with since moving. My son and her daughter were good friends at school, and we would often have coffees and catch ups before or after the school day together. Prior to me moving, in the past me and my partner have had messy arguments, which have lead to my friend telling me she is anxious of me moving, and disapproving of the treatment inflicted by my partner at the time of arguing. This I have relayed on to him at the time; but when me and him have made up, I have always reminded him she just had my best interests at heart and that she doesn’t hate him, just being a good friend and wants what’s best for me.

Now, over the past couple nights my partner has been getting quite heated about my friend, insinuating that we are romantically involved with one another, or that I put her first, and I’ve expressed my love for them both, in two different ways and how they both have different roles in my life. He gets antsy any time I go to see her, or if we send one another messages. We do not bitch about him, just merely catch up and talk about general life.

Today, he has told me it’s basically him or her. We have two sons (one each who love one another) and a son together who is a couple months old. This behaviour has really hurt me as I don’t see her as a threat, and being away from home it’s nice to keep a little contact to make me still feel nearby. After telling me it was him or her, he has also since told me I’m chosing her over our family. But I have expressed how I can’t see it’s fair being made to pick when they both are people I love and want in my life. He has subsequently told me he will end it as he can’t be 2nd place to anybody. 

Am I the arsehole for telling him I won’t make that choice and stop speaking to her?  Or should I cut ties in order to keep him happy and keep our family together? ",6,1748379793.0,AmItheAsshole,17,0.8,False

1kwyra6,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1kwyra6/incompatible_friends_i_feel_like_a_total_asshole/,Incompatible “friends” - I feel like a total asshole.,"I have this newly acquired “friend” who is a teacher at my son’s daycare and I regret being friendly. 

Backstory: there is a little boy in my son’s daycare class (we will call my son Owen and the other little boy David). David and Owen are generally 2 of the last kids to leave because David’s mom (we will call her Samantha) is a teacher at the daycare and I get off work just before daycare closes. Since they’re there together, they play before they leave. Samantha caught on to this and messaged me to invite me to a playdate about 2 months ago. I agreed because I’m not great at making friends and would love to have more mom friends! We have since gone on the play date, carpooled to a field trip and to another daycare friend’s birthday party.

In this 2 months, Samantha has started cornering me every day at pickup to talk for 20-30 minutes, texts me constantly about her multiple personal issues, invited me on vacations, and has declared that we are now best friends. I feel like the world’s biggest asshole when I say this, but we have NOTHING in common. We have kids that are the same age and that’s it. But she goes on and on about how David has never had a friend and that Owen is his very best friend. Owen doesn’t feel the same way and actively tells me that another kid in his class is his best friend. This has just gone way too far too quickly and I feel like I’ve led her on by allowing it. I’ve tried to send cues showing her that I’m not comfortable but she’s not picking them up. She tells me she loves me and is so so so grateful that we’re best friends and that Owen and I are in their lives. It takes me a while to open up to people but she has just bulldozed that wide open.

I’m 9 years older than her and just at a completely different place in my life. All she ever talks about is drama at the daycare, drama with her baby daddy, and jealousy of his new wife (who seems like a sweetheart and seems to be trying her best to be a good stepparent to David). I always drive and pay for coffee and breakfast for the kids on our outings with no expectation of repayment because she’s chronically broke. BUT she lives with her parents, gets consistent child support from 2 different men, and has money to buy a macbook and eat fast food EVERY DAY. I want to clarify that I don’t care one bit to pay and drive, but it rubs me the wrong way when she bitches to me later about how she bought another teacher a $7 breakfast and they never paid her back. She’s always the victim and I can’t STAND THAT. I honestly feel like I’m parenting her 90% of the time and thats not what I’m looking for out of a friendship at this point in my life. I’m always having to talk her out of dumb financial decisions, listen to the aftermath of those dumb financial decisions, listen to her whine about her baby daddy, and be the voice of reason. I already have a toddler that mentally kicks my ass daily, I don’t need another one.

I’ve been trying to put myself out there and make some mom friends in my area. My best friends have kids, but they all live almost 2 hours away. So this is why I feel like a selective douchebag when I say “I wanted some friends, but this one is annoying.” I feel like friends need to have things in common. Similar music taste, style, interests, hobbies, aspirations, hygiene standards, sense of humor, etc. She’s a nice person, but we are just polar opposites and not the kind of opposites that mesh.

How do I distance myself without being the worst human on earth? I am physically incapable of being mean and being perceived as mean gives me anxiety, which is how I got in this situation to start with. I don’t want to be NOT friends, but I don’t want to be bff’s.

I am only trying to document my Japanese journey to encourage myself (and maybe others). I may later learn that some of the resources I use are not the best options, so take everything with a grain of salt.**

**Introduction**

初めまして！マリーです。Recently my Jiji passed away and it made me realize had limited time with my Obachan who lives in Japan. We talk on the phone occasionally, but she doesn't speak English very well. I want the chance to know her (in her native language) before she passes on. She's the healthiest person I know so I'm hoping that's a very long while. My brother and I have decided to buckle down and learn the language so we can write her letters and speak with her.

I am half Japanese on my dad's side, and no one in our immediate family is fluent, but my mother lived a time in Japan and is conversational. She is also a language teacher and polyglot, so she's an excellent resource.

Here's how I'm progressing!


**Grammar and Vocab**

I am currently on chapter 3 of [Genki 1](https://www.amazon.com/Genki-Vol-1-Textbook-3e-ed/dp/4789017303/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1NIG9KDE3BLU5&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Ets0Rs-n2PD43PyRl3_RZvHceIwiGqD1p00DFhBNOdOFPpIUhGzF0XcakfJJDaJ9oL6MaSMrQ_p4uz3R3-qBsoeJHEfun0P1nTqcGxL6ldckMeXBaHFhrL0Tc11EaaLXNd_OkRNK41ynuHgMFRy6JCEgcGwM4SXam7q_h_fKoaP8JsoJXc7Swc0LPTQEN1OMcidFkwtVXgSSwt0VDohKV7E1KJTn6d6FKMBMzu39hZ4.k8Cyku7PZkouPgKtsEuUkmIoEZx5z6UEMRPSEwmy8Uk&dib_tag=se&keywords=genki+1+3rd+edition&qid=1748376344&s=books&sprefix=genki+1+3rd+edition%2Cstripbooks%2C86&sr=1-1). The grammar points flew over my head, so per the advice of people here I've looked into [Cure Dolly](https://www.youtube.com/@organicjapanesewithcuredol49)'s youtube channel, and found it a bit easier so far. I am still struggling quite a bit though haha.

[ToKini Andy](https://www.tokiniandy.com/) is my ""classroom"" exposure. They follow Genki material, and even if the textbook confuses me a bit, it's nice to hear everything said out loud.

I am also using [1000 Essential Vocabulary for the JLPT N5](https://www.amazon.com/Japanese-Vocabulary-Words-Language-Proficiency/dp/4872179811) for additional vocabulary. It has a nifty transparent red sheet in to cover up the red text in the book so you can practice. I enjoy that novelty enough to study lmao.


[**ひらがな　カタカナ**](https://imgur.com/a/tSbTxON)

This has been the easiest bit for me so far. I think hiragana took a week of studying to be comfortable, and katakana is going a bit slower just from limited exposure. Can I just say, whoever commented in this subreddit saying to distinguish ン,ソ,シ, and ツ by their respective hiragana stroke direction, I'd like to buy you a coffee. You're my hero.

[Tofugu](https://www.tofugu.com/) has been my favorite resource for this so far. I appreciate the visuals and mnemonics.


**漢字**

I keep hearing people say their least favorite part of learning Japanese is kanji, but honestly I am loving it. I'm 100 kanji deep into [Remembering the Kanji](http://www.amazon.com/Remembering-Kanji-Complete-Japanese-Characters/dp/0824835921/ref=sr_1_1?crid=10KW02X5WXZ54&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.P9cIU6asLVRxSK_xyzG5xe2qCOUX_2mAYQkmyWCvj3dwdDUng7mIKcFHcSyfWGgivdc-uuLMyCJnpH-IMD2HpAAsSHX7G3UBsS6SKNx6K1gdMhEAOT2Y-z9UcaQuZ1GRslIQ3HRGoK0aqlDd2KXUWQT3Owht4sJ8Twl3VVV-BX-igJDgsC3KqE2AUv8uZ2r4bze2XS9ad3xKIWkuHdH21HLULSu4DS_-LQ2cOw-kzlk.kIz2kKVYpUtcZ44vOkTU4Xn8xFuBX6zBHqwQ3gXko7Q&dib_tag=se&keywords=remembering+the+kanji&qid=1748377047&s=books&sprefix=remembering+the+kanji%2Cstripbooks%2C93&sr=1-1), which seems to be ubiquitous around these parts. I will say, Heisig makes me feel foolish sometimes, because words like ""decameron"" and an ""eminent"" person are not words I use or hear often in English, so using them as a keyword feels silly. Having to google *English* words while learning Japanese has kept my ego in check.

I am using [Anki](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1654787298) for review and using graph paper to [write them ](https://imgur.com/a/6fFrrH7)in order to recall.


**""Fun"" Practice**

I wanted something fun for a warmup or break between lessons, so I'm replaying [Fire Emblem 3 Houses](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/fire-emblem-three-houses-switch/?srsltid=AfmBOopHNgKvJAw8ojksp4DSJ-KW6HqWUKJGPWgCvWfwDcqSh5Xo5Sxb) with Japanese audio. All of its dialogue is voice acted, and there's an option to replay individual lines of dialogue. I know very little of what they are saying by listening, but every time someone says what year it is or sensei, I get very excited haha. That said, I doubt terms like ""progenitor god"" and ""sword of creation"" will come up for quite awhile. Who knows, maybe the JLPT 1 is crazy lmao.

In the future I'd love to find a game with furigana and voice acting.

I haven't watched much anime since high school, but am going to watch some Ghibli and Your Name later as well. Your Name is my favorite movie so shouldn't be too hard. I am definitely open to suggestions.

Right now I am in the market for youtube channels to expose me to native dialogue.

Note I am only 6 weeks in. I just don't know what enough.

Morning- wake up get the coffee going and take him for a 45 min- 1hr leash walk. He has no recall so pretty much all his walks are on the lead. 

He gets wet breakfast in a lick mat and some kibble

During the day one of us is at home so he has company but not necessarily attention.

Lunch either 30 min walk or 30 min fetch

He gets a lick mat with some frozen yogurt after his walk.

After work walk 45 min-1hr 30 mins. 

His dinner he gets the remaining tin and whatever left of hiss kibble allowance. 

All his walks have an element of training mainly trying to reduce his reactivity and work on recall.

Evening time I play with him a fair bit, tug cuddles some sit and wait training in 5 min intervals. 

He also has a bunch of toys he is starting to play with by himself. Like his bordem buster, chew toys and sometime we will give him cardboard to tear up. 

Weekends he gets two longer walks usually in the  morning and then early afternoon. We are trying to get him used to the car so 10 min drives to new locations. 

His standard walks are in woodland and his nose is to the ground most of the time. 

Ideally we would be seeing him to doggy day care but his reactivity just isn't there yet and he is very hit and miss with dogs so just don't/can't see this happening. 

Any tips to mix it up/does this sound reasonable amount to ensure the dog is stimulated? He seems healthy, comfortable and happy with us but if he had it his way it would be playtime all the time. ",3,1748379528.0,dogs,2,1.0,False
1kwynms,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1kwynms/lifes_unexpected_changes/,Life's unexpected changes,"We’ve all heard, too many times, the adage “Life doesn’t always work out how you planned.” However, we rarely discuss the practical implications of this truth.

We live our daily lives off a host of assumptions. These assumptions are necessary for survival. We have to assume that the roads we drive on, the products we use and the foods we eat are safe. We assume that by following through on our promises, working hard, and showing up where we’re requested, we’ll contribute both to society and our own self-development.

However, any of these assumptions could be false. In order not to become paralyzed by anxiety, our only option is to develop trust. And yet, blind trust has its own issues. 

An answer to this problem lies within nuance. We obviously can’t live our lives panicking over every detail we have no proof of–nothing would ever get done. We also can’t just trust that every choice we ever make will work out. As we know, many of our choices frequently come back to bite us. 

So, where should we place our trust? Well, ideally, we’d place trust in ourselves. In order to do this, we need to learn how to become trustworthy for ourselves. 

First of all, why do we want to place trust in ourselves above all else? Well, because regardless of your expertise on any given situation, you are the one who ultimately makes your own decisions. It’s up to you whether to get out of bed, go to work, take a class, start a hobby, go out with friends, watch TV, read a book, etc. For the vast majority of us, nobody is forcing us to do any one of these. They may heavily influence our decision, but even that is ultimately our choice. By developing our discernment skills, we can become worthy of our own trust. 

Ironically, one of the best ways to develop this skill is by learning how to question ourselves. Any time you feel any tension around a decision, you can ask yourself, “Why am I choosing to do this right now? What are the motivations behind this?” Whether or not this question leads you to change your decision, you have practiced discernment. 

We frequently look at issues through a black and white lens: this may be due to the fact that the brain works, fundamentally, a bit like a (wildly complex) computer: it is composed of a series of on and off switches. Sometimes, black and white thinking benefits us, such as when we need to cut out a bad habit, or bite the bullet and take action. However, in many cases, accepting the nuance around a situation can help us understand that the best decision may lie in the middle of the two options we see in front of us, or in a third, outside of the box option we hadn’t already considered.

For example, you may ask yourself whether you’re emotionally up for a social gathering you’ve been invited to. You can’t decide if the benefits of attending outweigh the drawbacks. By sitting with the question and using discernment, “What’s motivating me to go? Do I want to socialize? Do I want to be present for others? Am I only going out of pressure or guilt?” or “What’s discouraging me from attending? Fear? Burnout?” you can get to the bottom of your feelings and motivations, putting you in a mental space more fit for good decision making. You may realize that your emotional battery is indeed too drained to go, but also that you really do want to see everyone. By realizing that these are the motivations behind your feelings, you can then ask, “Why am I emotionally drained, and is there anything I can do about it?” You may then realize there is a specific reason, unrelated to this social invite, that you feel drained, and that that is it’s own issue. You may even realize that you need to tackle this outside issue first and foremost and, by solving it, will free up the energy needed to go to the party.

Of course, the above situation could play out in a myriad of ways. What’s important is understanding the role that learning to trust yourself has in helping navigate your life. It’s about asking the question, and understanding that the questions don’t end. Being ready to question a situation prepares you for the unexpected turns in life. This is why people call challenges opportunities. They may indeed be challenges, but so often they contain an opportunity to solve a problem you may not have even realized needed solving. Anticipating challenges openly (in that, it does not cause you to freeze), can also create a somewhat smoother sailing life. When we ask in what ways a situation with at least some stakes could go wrong, we prepare ourselves for course change. Again, it’s not necessary to do this with everything (we probably don’t need to anticipate all of the things that could go wrong when we’re trying to go get coffee… probably).

Gut feeling also comes into play with self trust. When you feel an extremely strong gut feeling that causes you to question the path you’re on or the decision you’re about to make, listen to it. You may or may not be in a situation where you have all of the conscious knowledge needed to make the perfect decision. Let the gut have some weight over the situation; it is part of you as well, and learning the language of the gut is part of self-trust. ",1,1748379515.0,Adulting,0,1.0,False

They're gonna be lesbian moms together!!""

Unfortunately (or maybe very fortunately), this did not happen. However now with the beautiful advancement of technology we do have the ability to dream. 

So I let chatgpt write an alternative ending for our star crossed lovers June and Serena and I wanted to share this with you for a good laugh. Enjoy!!!

  
**Title:** ***Redemption’s Embrace***  
*An alternate ending to The Handmaid’s Tale*

The train rocked steadily through the northern night, snow streaking past the window like ghosts. Inside the dimly lit carriage, June and Serena sat across from one another—silent, save for the occasional whimper of baby Noah. They hadn't spoken since June stepped aboard, breath caught in her chest when she saw Serena clutching the child, eyes wide with the same disbelief.

Days passed.

What began as wary silence turned to cautious conversation. They spoke like women pulling thread from the same wound—painful, deliberate, and necessary.

One night, June stood in the train’s narrow corridor, arms folded as she watched the stars blur by. Serena joined her, arms wrapped tightly around herself. “I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop,” she murmured. “For Gilead to find us. For punishment to come.”

June glanced sideways. “Maybe this *is* the punishment,” she said. “Starting over. Living with the people you’ve hurt. Being seen.”

Serena looked at her then—really looked. “Do you see me now?”

June held her gaze, her voice low. “Yeah. I do.”

In Alaska, they made a life that didn’t resemble penance, nor paradise—just something real.

A small house at the edge of a pine grove. Mornings of quiet coffee and baby Noah’s laughter. Nights spent by the fire, stories whispered between sips of wine. The world was wide and uncertain, but their orbit was shrinking, becoming intimate. Familiar.

One winter evening, June found Serena standing at the window, watching the snow.

“You always look like you’re waiting for someone,” June said gently.

“I was,” Serena replied. “But I think they’ve been here the whole time.”

June stepped closer. “You mean Noah?”

Serena turned. “No. I mean you.”

They stood like that, inches apart, their breath visible in the cold.

June reached out, brushing a stray curl behind Serena’s ear. “Do you really see *me*?” she whispered, voice trembling.

“I’ve always seen you,” Serena breathed. “Even when I hated you. Especially then.”

A beat of silence. And then—June leaned in, slow, deliberate. Their lips met, hesitant at first, but sure by the second breath. Years of rage, guilt, and longing alchemized into something new. Something soft.

Later, curled together beneath a quilt that smelled of cedar and smoke, Serena whispered, “Maybe we aren’t broken.”

June smiled against her shoulder. “No,” she said. “We’re just beginning.”

Well… what can I say about this fast?

I started this 21-day water fast after my annual check-up completely shook me. The results were a wake-up call, and I knew I needed to take control of my health—reset my body, reset my metabolism, and clear out anything that didn’t belong (bacterial overgrowth, yeast, toxins… all of it).

Let me tell you, Day 3 almost broke me. I had withdrawal symptoms like crazy—shaking, pounding headaches, weakness. I actually had to leave work early and just lie down. But once that passed, I knew I was in this for real.

I won’t pretend I’ve had high energy. Some days I’m winded just going up stairs or carrying groceries. But I’ve still been able to function, and oddly, I’ve gotten more done in the past 16 days than I have in the last 2 years. I realized I eat out of boredom way more than I thought. And emotionally? Yeah. I’ve had to face some deep stuff—stress, loneliness, overwhelm—and just feel it. No numbing with snacks, no comfort meals. Just… me and the moment.

This has also been a spiritual reset. I’ve spent a lot of time in prayer, in reflection, in tears. Yesterday I was sobbing thinking about all the foods I miss—short ribs, Jamaican food, fish tacos, sweet drinks. But I’ve stuck with it. I haven’t had any sugar, no coffee, no tea. Just water. Every time I feel tempted, I remind myself: breaking this fast doesn’t bring fried chicken and cake. It brings broth and avocado—and honestly, that’s kept me in line.

And maybe the most powerful part of all—this fast has helped me rebuild trust within myself. To believe in my ability to commit, to follow through, to keep going. What an amazing feeling it is to get this far. I can’t wait until June 1 to say that I made it. 21 days. All me.

As a mom, this journey means even more. It’s not just about losing weight—it’s about keeping up with my daughter, being present and active in her life, and taking care of my body so that I’m around when she grows up, gets married, has her own kids, and lives her beautiful life. That’s what keeps me going.

I’ve lost 32 pounds in 16 days, But this has become so much more than a number. It’s a healing. A reset. A promise to myself that I can do hard things—and that I deserve to feel good, inside and out.

1kwyavu,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_bettermetips/comments/1kwyavu/betterme_healthy_highprotein_meal_plan/,BetterMe: Healthy High-Protein Meal Plan,"If you’re looking to **build lean muscle**, **lose fat**, and improve overall health, a **high-protein meal plan** might be the missing piece in your diet.

But here’s the catch—it’s not just about eating tons of meat. A *healthy* high-protein plan is **balanced**. It includes:

✅ Lean proteins  
✅ Healthy fats  
✅ Complex carbs  
✅ Fiber and essential nutrients

# ✅ Why Choose a High-Protein Meal Plan?

Here are some science-backed benefits:

* **Muscle Growth & Recovery**: Protein provides the amino acids needed to repair tissues after workouts and prevent muscle loss during weight loss.
* **Weight Management**: Increases satiety (you feel fuller for longer), helps reduce cravings, and slightly boosts metabolism due to the thermic effect of food.
* **Better Sleep**: More protein at dinner may reduce nighttime hunger pangs.
* **Bone Health**: Combined with calcium, protein supports stronger bones.
* **Improved Metabolism**: Your body burns more calories digesting protein than carbs or fats.

# 🥦 Top Protein Foods for a Healthy Meal Plan

**Plant-Based Proteins:**

* Legumes (lentils, chickpeas, black beans)
* Nuts & seeds (chia, almonds, flax)
* Whole grains (quinoa, oats, brown rice)
* Soy products (tofu, tempeh, edamame)
* Protein-rich veggies (broccoli, spinach)
* High-protein fruits (avocado, guava)

**Animal-Based Proteins:**

* Fish (salmon, tuna, trout)
* Poultry (skinless chicken, turkey)
* Eggs and dairy (Greek yogurt, cottage cheese)
* Lean red meats (beef, pork in moderation)

📝 *Pro tip*: Mix plant and animal proteins to cover all essential amino acids and get a nutrient-dense variety.

# 🥗 Sample Beginner Meal Plan (100–130g protein/day)

**Meal Frequency**: 3 meals + 1–2 snacks  
**Calories**: 1800–2000/day

**🍳 Breakfast (30g protein)**

* ½ cup oats + protein powder
* Peanut butter + berries
* Black tea or coffee

**🥚 Morning Snack (20g protein)**

* 2 boiled eggs
* Unsweetened Greek yogurt

**🍗 Lunch (35g protein)**

* 150g grilled chicken breast
* Steamed broccoli
* 1 cup quinoa
* Olive oil dressing

**🐟 Dinner (25g protein)**

* Grilled fish or tofu
* Cooked brown rice
* Mixed veggies

**🥜 Optional Snack**:

* Tuna or protein shake
* Nuts or roasted chickpeas

❔❔ Do you use protein shakes or stick to whole foods?

This streamer, we can call him James, is a prominent marketing expert that shares his knowledge to a wide audience on Twitch.

One of the cornerstones of his community is the Paper Mario franchise. For those of you unfamiliar, it is considered one of the best video games of all time. It would be ludicrous for anybody to suggest otherwise especially since James himself has played the game over the course of half a decade. He even designated May 22 as a holiday to commemorate its greatness calling it Paper Mario Day.

However, on May 22 of this year, he only spent a single minute to celebrate the special occasion of Paper Mario Day. To add further insult to injury, he simply replayed an old play through of the game and passed it off as a live stream. It’s like pretending to drink alcohol at a party but actually just drinking water in a can designed to look like one.

I have just been in a state of shock ever since, and I can no longer hold this frustration inside me for so long. I have been drinking excessive amounts of coffee like some kind of cow and reverted back to eating sour patch kids — mind you these no longer taste as sour as they used to.

What should I do?,"I have a male friend that I met through a local tag team. We would see each other twice a week as a result and we would ride together to games as he either doesn’t have a car or license (unsure). 

We started texting back in January but I never took it as anything more than friendship. It was often about the going on of the team. We have hung out in a group setting maybe twice (he did not ask me on a date, we were watching other teams play in a different league) and a few weeks ago he asked me to go for a coffee. It was fine but definitely no romantic spark. Both paid for our own drinks and had a good chat, about the usual things like the team and some other stuff. Nice guy but nothing other than friendship vibes for me. We have never so much as held hands or kissed or anything. 

The problem is the texting has become routine and I have no interest in it. I’ve tried to phase it out but he isn’t getting the hint. I don’t want to send a “i don’t see this going anywhere” text because at the end of the day we are friends and that’s all I see it as, so I don’t want to make it weird. But our league is finished up now so I have no reason to see him and don’t want to be talking to him all the time. Especially because I do think he likes me and thinks this is something more than it is. 

I am currently doing my masters and have exams coming up so for now I am focusing on those and don’t want to have to be on my phone. 

How do I phase out the texting without making it awkward ? Having a “we’re just friends” conversation seems dramatic because it isn’t like we’ve been on a few dates and I’ve decided it isn’t what I want, it’s that all we are is friends and I don’t want to text him every day.

Rude!'-My everyday line in my head every time he doesn't comment on anything. No 'thank you' or whatsoever after giving his orders. I told you, he doesn't know the word thank you. It doesn't exist in his vocabulary.

Madi's POV: Tell me Madi, why do you have to apply for another job? You already have your own fine dining restaurants. Three big freaking restaurants in the City. And you're not lacking out of money, in fact, you give almost half of them to your charities. God! Aren't you feeling exhausted?""

That's Noelle. My best friend and manager to one of my three restaurants operating in the City.

""Because I told you it's also my dream since college. That's why I also took a business degree to fulfil my bucket list of dreams."" I tried to reason with her but still, she couldn't understand my point.

It has been a month since I started working as a Personal Assistant at Wilsons Electronics Corporation under the management of Mr Gabriel Wilsons, our CEO. And let me tell you, the pressure of working at the biggest company in the City of Chicago sometimes gets out of control.

Running there and everywhere, sending faxes, emailing documents, checking and updating my boss's schedules and making his coffee three times a day is just a small part of my everyday routine.

Of course, my duties and responsibilities as the owner of my own business are not yet included.

""Besides, it's part of my job to feel tired and exhausted. Come on.""

I waved my hand in the air and continued checking some papers that need my signature. We are currently in the back office of my first restaurant which is a 20-minute drive from the WEC building. Today is Sunday and it's my day off, so I can use the whole day checking out my three outlets.

""Yeah, but you're not getting any younger. You're already 26, single, no boyfriend since birth and a freaking virgin in all departments, Forgodsake!""

Thank God, the office is soundproof, so I don't have to cover her mouth even if she screams out of her lungs.

Ever since she found out that I got the job at Wilsons, she has started rambling and rambling on me.

""Hey! Stop mentioning my age and status."" I just chuckled at her as I brought the glass of orange juice to my mouth.

""Okay fine. So, tell me, how's your boss's attitude towards his employees? Is he someone like you, considerate and warm?""

I almost choked on my juice after hearing her words. My boss... considerate? I don't think so, I'm not sure. Warm? Haha.. the total opposite.

He's like a walking ice man every day. No, the right word is that he's like a zombie, cold and lifeless. There's something wrong with his personality that I couldn't figure out. He's a man of few words...Nah! I mean one word.

""Honestly, he's the total opposite of the boss you're imagining.""

""What do you mean, the total opposite?""

""Well, He's cold, a little rude and arrogant sometimes. He doesn't know the word thank you and likes to shout every time--- any time especially when he found something wrong or error on your reports, tsk. tsk. He won't give you any choice, it's either you get your ears ready or get yourself ready to say goodbye to your job.""

""Ohh, that's harsh?"" she said in disbelief.

""Yup."" I said popping the 'p' at the end. ""But, thanks to my skills and abilities, I have never been shouted at by him since day one,"" I proudly stated with my chest out and an arched eyebrow.

""Pss!"" she rolled her eyes. ""Wow! A loner and aggressive boss plus a narcissistic PA work in one. Yeah, I am really doubting how you two manage to interact with each other.""

""Me? Narcissistic?"" I acted horrified as I pointed to myself. ""Of course not! I'm just stating some facts about myself.""

""Yeah, it's exactly, what you are doing.""

I didn't counter back. I just laughed and took a sip of my juice again.

""Hmm.. by the way, how can you describe him physically?"" she has this malicious look in her eyes.

I sighed, rolling my eyes. How would I describe him?

""How would I describe him? Hmm.. well, let's just say he's a living Hercules of the country. Happy?""

""Oh shit! Describe exactly that living Hercules from head to toe!"" all her round eyes were on me.

""What? Seriously?""

""Yes! Because if that's true, you have a fucking hot of a boss! Yum!"" she squealed, clapping her hands. I just shook shake my head.

""Okay.. he's hot. He's handsome if you will look at his face, he's got brown eyes, perfectly sculptured nose, chiselled jawline... what else... hmm.. broad shoulders, toned and muscled chest, I guess?""

""You guess?""

""Yup.""

""You just guess? Are you kidding me?"" she furrowed her eyebrows.

""Well, I haven't seen him shirtless or in other attire than his business suit. What do you expect?""

""My God, Madielyn! You just let my imagination run wild. Hmmp! How about the size of his foot or at least his shoes? For sure, you can see them every day!""

""Why do you need to know the size of his foot and shoes? Are you planning to buy him a new one?"" I tried to throw a joke but it was just me laughing at my own joke. She glared at me.

""You wouldn't understand because you're a virgin!""

""What the-----""

""Just tell me the size of his foot!""

""I don't know exactly the size of his freaking foot, just his shoes!""

""So, what is it?"" her eyes were round as saucers.

What's happening to her?

""Uhm.. 10.. 11? Maybe 12?"" I answered bringing the half glass of juice to my mouth.

""Oh, Jesus! He has a huge and long member!""

She exclaimed loudly that caused my eyes to widen and I spit out the juice all over her blouse when I coughed. I even coughed so hard when I saw her awful face. I really wanted to laugh at her state if it weren't for the cough that made it impossible for me to do.

""Yucks! you're disgusting!"" she complained as she wiped her blouse with a tissue.

""I'm sorry."" I was trying not to laugh. ""But it's your fault. You can't control your mouth saying those----""

""What? Saying those gross, nasty, dirty, filthy words like a huge and hard member, penis and cock----""

""Noelle! I swear, I'm not going to discuss my boss's body with you again! You really have a dirty mouth!""

It's now her who's laughing at me. I arranged my already signed documents inside the folder and pushed them towards her.

""My God!"" I said getting up, stretching my arms.

""Where are you going?"" she's still laughing.

""I'm just going out for a random check."" I huffed and walked towards the door.

""Okay."" She tried to hide her smile, but she failed.

It's my weekly routine when I visit each of my outlets. Check randomly on its area and all the employees. I went first to the kitchen where my staff are busy cooking and preparing orders. Since it's Sunday, our customers have doubled numbers compared to weekdays.

""Good morning, Ms Madi""

I was greeted first by the group of waiters taking their customer's orders.

""Good morning, guys. How's your day?""

I treat them all like my friends and not just ordinary employees. As they say, if you want to earn the respect of others, treat them the way you want them to treat you back.

""Well... tiring as always. But we're happy because our beautiful boss came to visit us today, right guys?"" Tony winked at me, he's our head waiter.

""Yes."" they all answered in unison.

""Wow, thank you. Such a small thing--- beautiful? Nah... I already know that."" I said grinning proudly while patting my shoulder in the act of wiping dirt.

And they laughed and some shake their heads.

""Yeah. See? That's what we're talking about. You always make us laugh.""

""Why? Am I not beautiful?"" I joke on a horrified face.

""Of course you are. You're beautiful inside and out, Ms Madi. You just really like carrying your own chair not just sometimes but always.""

And they laughed again and I laughed with them too.

We're always like this. I always make a way to have at least a small conversation with them. Even if sometimes I carried my own chair, but it's worth it if that's the way they would open up to me, not just as their boss but as their considered friend.

The next area I went to visit is the dining hall. And yeah, it's really a tiring day. They were all busy serving and assisting customers.

People rarely see me in and out of my restaurants. I always keep myself on a low profile. I monitor the reports and happenings on my business usually through my phone and computer. I show my face once or twice a week or whenever there are papers that need my signature or my appearance personally.

There were just a few people who know that I took another course, my mom and my friends after opening my first restaurant.

I took Hotel and Restaurant Management course in college. After I graduated and started my business, I enrolled in an online school for Office and Business Management and got my degree.

My first job as an 'employee' was a Department Manager, but I resigned after a year. I applied again as an HR assistant in a not-so-big company in the City and after a year too, I saw the ads on social media that the WEC needs a PA to the CEO.

I tried my luck and got the job. I didn't put my first course and my business when I submitted my resume. In short, my boss and the company I currently work for are not aware of this.

After a random check in the restaurant, I said goodbye to Noelle and went to my another outlet. I spent the whole day visiting my stores and checking some important papers. I only got home when it's already 6 in the afternoon. I lived in a small apartment and had a roommate who is a bank manager. She also knows my business because we have been living together for 2 years and the reason why I decided to live in a small apartment.

**Roadmap**  
  
**Terlingua – January 15**  
  
The sun was just waking up.  
And you thought I was sleeping.  
Wrapped tight in your blanket  
you clung to your coffee like hope.  
I watched you play with birds.  
  
You crept behind cover like you wouldn’t be seen.  
They kept you a bush away,  
close enough to keep you chasing.  
So you did.  
  
In that moment I saw you for you.  
Before I knew your depths.  
That morning I knew I would love you.  
  
**Salt Flat – February 23**  
  
We drove all day,  
but it felt like an instant.  
We talked about everything—nothing.  
Subtle glances,  
grazing touches.  
Our comfort told us we were onto something.  
Neither of us had to say it.  
  
When we got to our camp the sky was on fire.  
We knew it was performing.  
Mirroring what it saw in us  
like we put it there ourselves.  
We hadn’t said it yet  
but our eyes knew the words.  
  
**Santa Rosa Beach – May 4**  
  
Handshakes and smiles.  
Talking about my job.  
Four generations together.  
My first time meeting most of them.  
My time to shine.  
  
But really,  
seeing your role, your peace, your glow.  
Daughter, sister, mother, rock.  
Watching your smile fill the room.  
Your warmth filled my heart.  
  
The three of us shared a room that night.  
We made love while >!NAME\*!< slept.  
Silent, but on fire.  
I held you so tight.  
You always fit like you were made for me.  
You surrendered.  
  
It made us stronger.  
  
**Gila Hot Springs – May 26**  
  
Who gets this far away just to run and look at stars with someone they love?  
  
What do we see here that we don’t see at home?  
  
I see you.  
At peace. Decompressed.  
Curious. Soft.  
Your touches, your words,  
I’m in awe of your poise.  
  
Are we finding our stride?  
Is this comfort safe?  
  
We share the same love,  
for each other, in life.  
We don’t take it for granted.  
Like air or a date circled on the calendar,  
we don’t have to talk about it,  
but we know it’s there.  
  
In this moment we are eternal.  
  
**Cuchara – July 4**  
  
Our first two bedroom cabin.  
Our first family trip.  
  
Taking turns.  
Building trust.  
  
Walkie talkies, shoulder rides, and bears.  
Stomach born laughter.  
  
She was perfect.  
And you were happy.  
  
Our corner of heaven,  
It was all we needed.  
  
**Crestone – October 12**  
  
Fall in Colorado feels different.  
The sun never makes it all the way up in the sky,  
and the cold from the night before never really burns off.  
  
We read all about Crestone before we made it there.  
A strange town with its own energy,  
but I think we brought this one with us.  
A subtle shift.  
Not worth talking about,  
but something that can’t go without noticing.  
  
It’s not to say that the empire is falling,  
or that we’re at some point of no return,  
but a peace is missing.  
Your voice used to be higher when you talked to me,  
and you used to tell me sweet things that would just trail off  
like you weren’t sure if you should keep going or if you’d already said enough.  
  
You came back to me at night,  
but I felt your distance during the day.  
  
I know I’m reacting to this.  
You used to always touch me when you walked by;  
your hand on my neck,  
a kiss on my head.  
  
Now I long for it,  
but I’m left waiting.  
I feel a change.  
  
**Jemez Springs – February 14**  
  
We ran through the mountains together.  
Not for the first time,  
but I never would have guessed it would be our last.  
  
7,000’.  
It was snowing, we didn’t hesitate.  
We never did when it came to running.  
  
Later I asked for your hand,  
and told you I’d give you my life  
if you just said yes.  
  
(I thought) the answer came easy.  
Things always did if we didn’t fight it.  
“It shouldn’t be this hard.”  
  
Now I look back at this trip,  
and I can’t remember the details.  
Am I protecting myself or are you already a fading memory?  
  
**Home Depot Parking Lot – May 20**  
  
I was five minutes early.  
You were ten minutes late.  
  
You used to tell me I overthink things,  
but I know it means something this time.  
  
We both had our notes ready.  
This is cordial. We’re adults.  
  
Yours was polished and folded neatly.  
You always focused on the small details.  
  
I know mine was messy.  
Why does my writing always get worse at the bottom of the page?  
  
Before I left my house that morning I read the one where you wrote that I was the love of your life.  
Are you still breathing?  
  
It’s hard being the one that’s left behind.  
Am I supposed to feel like a child?  
  
I almost ran back to my car after you gave me the ring.  
Didn’t it fit right? Didn’t you like the way it shined?  
  
You were supposed to wear it forever.  
We were supposed to last forever.",1,1748377610.0,OCPoetry,1,1.0,False
1kwxux4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1kwxux4/which_of_these_items_are_generally_expected_to_be/,"which of these items are generally expected to be included in a kitchen with ""cooking basics"" ? [USA]","hello all! we travel a lot and have been experiencing a lot of inconsistency with what is included in a kitchen with ""cooking basics."" Are our expectations out of line to expect the following?

dishwashing liquid

dish scrubber

dish towels

can opener

ice cube tray (or working ice dispenser)

tea pot or tea kettle

filters to fit whatever coffee maker is in the unit

at least two complete sets of silverware (spoon, fork, knife)

at least two complete place settings (dinner plate, bowl for salad or pasta, smaller dish, glass for water or juice or whatever)

at least two coffee mugs

dish drying rack

dishwasher detergent (if there is a dishwasher)

I feel like these are all cooking basics and that it's reasonable to expect an ice tray in a freezer but perhaps my expectations are out of line. We recently returned from a trip where each kitchen was missing one or more of the items, but never the same item. So we bought a can opener and then the next place had one. Or we bought an ice cube tray and took it with us but then the next place had an ice cube tray.

In the future I'll ask more questions of hosts but maybe my expectations are just out of whack to think that these are expected in the first place?

Summer’s coming, and the world’s still shouting about “hot girl summers” and “main character energy.” Meanwhile, I’m here, reheating leftovers and wondering when “adulting” starts feeling less like a simulation.

If you’re also:  
- Secretly proud of your “adulting” wins (e.g., remembering to water a plant *twice*) 
- Secretly wondering if *anyone* actually has their life together    
- Stuck in the post-Covid “time warp” (*Is it 2020? 2023? Who knows*)  
- Tired of performative hustle culture but still want to *grow*, not just survive  
- Secretly proud of tiny wins (*“I remembered to hydrate today!”*) 

Maybe we'd get along

**Why this isn’t a sadboy manifesto:**  
If you…  
- Believe “connection” can start with shared confusion and moments like ""is this normal?""  
- Want to rebuild *something* habits, hobbies, or maybe (hopefully) a slow-burn connection
- Think “wholesome” means laughing at burnt cookies together, not performative Pinterest vibes  

Let’s exchange ideas:  
- Strategies for reading books again  
- Ways to adult without selling your soul to hustle culture  
- Secretly hopeful ideas for dating in a world obsessed with swiping

**The quiet ask:**  
Maybe we’ll start a two-person book club that becomes a “why is this pizza so good?” diary. Maybe we’ll trauma-bond over the absurdity of LinkedIn influencers and 5 years working experience required to land your first job **Or if the stars align we’ll find something warm and real**, like that scene in *Before Sunrise* where they just… talk. 

*Bonus points if:*
- Your love language is “sending a song that explains your soul at 2am”  
- You still believe in slow, sincere connection (but also won’t judge my *Trash Reality TV* shame-watch)",2,1748377572.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

yes i know science says nicotine is an addictive chemical and its true. But  ritual and smoke puff feeling is much more important. Saying vaping or smoking is barely nicotine addiction is like sayig, obesity is result of peperoni pizza. Yes it has an impact but not that big i guess. 

 I think this is all about dopamine check- points created in our brain. Arrived at work? Coffee and vape. First toilet of day ?  Puff at Office toilet. Off the metro? Sit down and puff. Since i ve quit, biggest lack i felt is ; feeling of time feeling disorientation. Vape was the small puff, a carrot i bite, as a horse keeps on the trail. Yet, i still remember this very Clear, when i vaped, i still was not satisfied enough. Is like joussance, a french philosophers introuction suggesting we crave for pleasure, that we can't exactly grap. I missed vaping most when i vaped the most. İronic right? 
 
So as i said, we feel ""out"" when we quit vaping because we lost concept of time and small prize moments. Our brains are looking for an origin line in infinite Plane. Thats why hardest part is midnight when we go sleep, our mind feels like hey , we are missng out on something, day can't finish like this ? Can it. Hardest part for me was also fall asleep and count into a New day as clean ☺️

Sorry for my eat hurting gramer guys. I am not a native and i wanted share my insights With you guys. Im still struggling about this Challenge. As most of you guys. We are not alone. Sometimes i find joy in these crazy cravings also 😁☺️ i try to turn whole thing into a game.

Yes, the view is amazing – but the sun will cook you alive. Go early in the morning or near sunset. Trust us.

Don’t eat at the first restaurant in the Old Town.
The cute ones by the gates often have tourist prices and meh food. Walk a bit deeper – better taste, better prices.

Don’t expect sandy beaches.
Kotor isn’t for laying in powdery sand – it’s about stone piers, clear water, and swimming with mountain views. Bring water shoes!

Don’t park in the center.
Unless you enjoy stress and parking tickets. Use paid lots or ask locals where it’s safe to leave your car.

Hi, there. 

I work in a 3-person IT department at a 350-user, 18 sites, big company. This is my first IT-job and i have been there for nearly 6 years now. I  happily go to work every morning, loving coming into work hoping to do some exciting stuff. I start out the day drinking coffee with my boss, which also became my friend. I started in this company with absolute zero experience, not even understanding the purpose of a server. I got hired because of my honesty at the job interview and my fresh and happy personality.  Which i am absolutely thankful for. We laugh together and cry  together. I call in sick - no questions asked and i literally could continue saying good things.

I also only have 3 minute drive to my work, and a great work-life balance. (Besides hotel stays for site-visits).

But now after these years i start to get some really good understandings of designing systems and networks, maintaining and cybersecurity. And now i am starting too understand how big of an amateur he is. It is really starting to get embarrased, and i know other ppl is talking about him on the ""it streets""...  
He all the time wants to keeps things simple. Because he dont want things to get complicated and he has the responsability for it. He is outsourcing everything in layer 3 because he dont understand it, even though i made it pretty clear that i do, and we could spare that expensive money. But he wont let me, and is hiring expensive consultants instead. Some weeks ago he really stated how redundancy just was a sales scam, because you wont see the slave die before both devices die.  (if you understand).  I told him that we obviously have to monitor our systems, and then he stated that ""That wouldnt work out, because then we should monitor everything"".  I also have very big concerns about our cybersecurity. He is trying to make it clear to me that our networks are safe, but i know that some of our equipment is running default passwords, and he says is dosent matter because ""they cant do any harm with a switch"".    
(BTW, he have 20 years of experience but in this same company).

And i cant take this unserious nonsense anymore, as i am myself becoming more professional and engaged with IT.  There will in a couple of years open a 120-Megawatt datacenter also only 5 minutes drive from my home, and i think it sounds sooo exciting. And maybe i should wait and  apply for it, but it could take years for them to start building this. 

I have wondered if i should stitch him to our CEO, because of the security reasons, but i still dont want to be that guy. Remember he also became a friend. 

So what would you do? - i really love my job, but i hate every statement in our IT department.   
I really wanna deep dive IT, and he doesnt.  
Or should i unplug myself from this, and apply for a whole another job? Maybe the new datacenter. But this could be a really long wait.

I want to get to a place where I can put some money away for 1. a house deposit (I have a good amount already) and 2. an emergency fund in case the contract isn't renewed. I don't spend a lot of money generally, so I think I would have the capacity to save quite a bit. Indulgences would be things like coffee, the odd meal out, a record here and there, a couple of trips a year. I also go to the UK to see my family a few times a year, but that's usually just the cost of a flight.

  
I've tried to make a budget a bunch of times over the years and have never been able to work one out. I've tried 50/30/20, envelope method, various spreadsheet templates, writing out each transaction in a notebook etc., and can't find one that sticks.

  
The main problem is that I'm bad with numbers, especially when it comes to money. I really struggle to process them. I find it difficult to work out things like how much I spend per month on food, for example, or what my share of a restaurant bill is. Numbers jumble up in my head and I lose track pretty fast. I guess I don't understand them. I know what my rent is, and fixed things like prescriptions and health insurance, but anything like food that changes month to month, or things that don't get debited the same date each month baffle me. I've had friends and family try and explain this stuff in different ways and nothing goes in.

  
That leaves me in a position where, for instance, my partner might ask what my budget is for a weekend away, and I have no idea. I don't know where to begin calculating something like that. As a result, even in my previous job where I was on good money, I was always stressed about finances and felt like I couldn't afford anything. I'd love to be one of these people who has money being put away for this and that, and having something in place that makes things more secure long-term, but I can't see that happening if I can't get a simple budget together.

  
So does anyone have any tips for extremely basic, small steps I can take to start to tackle this? Up to now I've felt like it's impossible but there must be a way to deal with this?!",5,1748376964.0,irishpersonalfinance,4,1.0,False

1kwxk47,https://www.reddit.com/r/exvegans/comments/1kwxk47/has_anyone_experienced_binge_eating_after/,Has anyone experienced binge eating after quitting veganism?,"I was vegan for roughly 7 years (I'm 27f), and after getting ovarian hyperstimulation during an IVF cycle, my doctor said a high-protein, high-sodium diet would help with the pain and swelling and bloating. So for the first time since college, I decided to eat a steak. It was delicious. Then that one steak turned into a lot of other things, and now it's like all bets are off. Cakes, cheese, anything that can be dipped in ranch dressing, chocolate, wings, prosciutto, frozen coffees... It's so bad and I'm wasting so much money on food. I have truly never struggled with anything like this before. When I was a teenager, I went through about a three-month phase where I got really depressed and anxious and lost a lot of weight because I lost my appetite quite badly... but that wasn't even intentional. I've never had any kind of ED or any issues with eating and now I just can't stop. It never feels like enough.

The weight gain is bad. I've gained almost 20 pounds since 2025 began. I know I need to give myself some grace because I also put myself through an IVF cycle (not pregnant yet, the plan is early 2026 for an embryo transfer) and I had a big complication with it, but its been a few months, I don't really have any reason to still be acting so weird about food anymore since my hormones should be back to normal. I'm getting married in August and the dress I bought and tried on last year, when I was under 150, certainly won't fit now when i go in for alterations... but these are depressing ramblings for my therapist, not this reddit thread.

Anyway, I came here just to ask if anyone has experienced this sort of ""all bets are off"" feeling with food after quitting veganism. I feel like a teenager who grew up in a strict household who goes away to a big state college and suddenly realizes ""oh! i'm free!"" and goes wild with partying. I'm not looking for advice, just curious if anyone else has had a similar experience.",12,1748376900.0,exvegans,2,0.94,False

1kwxi2f,https://www.reddit.com/r/GachaHusbandos/comments/1kwxi2f/benefits_of_a_truly_mixed_game/,Benefits of a Truly Mixed Game,"As we all know gacha games in general have not been kind to the release of male characters in favor of female ones. However, I feel like these players who only collect waifus may not see any benefits to more male characters only on a superficial level. There are literally guys out there that won't mind paying more for the game if it means to get rid of all husbando fans and only push companies to make female characters, which I find extreme. So what do you guys think about the benefits to a truly mixed audience game that is often overlooked?

I'll go first:

1) Mainstream Appeal: I think this is the biggest one for me. Sure, there are a lot of guys who don't mind sitting in their own echo chambers or bubbles isolated with other guys online that share the same interest, but boy it is awesome when you share the same hobby with people irl. It's fun to talk about Genshin with my coworkers, the local coffee shop owners, and even doctors in my area who play the game. I've made new friends this way, and I rather not only just rely on communicating about my interests online and only to random strangers online.

2) 'Fair' Pricing: This kinda goes in hand with the first point, but only may work with high production gacha games. Choosing to pander to a niche audience with a high production gacha might not do so hot in the long run as other games do the same thing when future releases come into the scene. If anything, I see powercreep and locking character kits to other character kits as with some games these days are the first steps to incentivize people into spending more to make up for the niche audience. These games are expensive to run and maintain over the years, and so if player retention is low with an already niche audience number, then I wouldn't be surprised if devs start coming up with gimmicks to push people to spend, while others like LADS having a monopoly on the female playerbase can get away with predatory gacha mechanics since there's no alternative to its genre.

If anything, I'm seeing a trend in high production gacha games doubling down on predatory practices anticipating new games coming onto the market and possibly stealing some of their users. For many, we draw a line to how much we're willing to take before jumping outside of gacha games as that is the reason some of us don't play LADS despite pandering to the female demographic. If anything, I know there are some of us out there already going back to games on Steam since these gachas are increasing incentivization to spend by arbitrarily inflating difficulty in endgame, locking character kits to others, or just having a monopoly over a demographic. I've seen waifu lovers already skipping out a few characters because of these practices too
