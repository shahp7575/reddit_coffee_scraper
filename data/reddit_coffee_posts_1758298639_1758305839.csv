1nlb0t7,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInPicks/comments/1nlb0t7/uncover_if_the_best_coffee_maker_nespresso_vertuo/,Uncover if the best coffee maker Nespresso Vertuo Next lives up to hype,"The Nespresso Vertuo Next, model ENV120BCA, has quickly become a major presence in my daily coffee routine. As someone who appreciates a good espresso as much as a smooth mug of coffee, this single-serve coffee maker caught my attention with its promise of versatility and convenience. I‚Äôve spent some time testing it out in my kitchen, and while there is plenty to love, there are some nuances to consider.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Aesthetically, this machine is a beauty. Its black finish with subtle rose gold accents blends perfectly into any modern kitchen setup. Although its footprint is relatively compact at 15.08""D x 5.59""W x 12.8""H, it doesn‚Äôt feel flimsy or lightweight; in fact, it feels quite premium. The clean, sleek lines and well-placed buttons give it a futuristic vibe, while the fully automatic operation ensures ease of use. However, its somewhat elongated design might be tricky for those with limited countertop space. The included welcome set of Nespresso Vertuo capsules was a thoughtful touch and helped me dive right into testing the different coffee styles.  

**Performance and Operation**  
The machine is impressively easy to use, thanks to its one-button operation. Drop in a coffee capsule, close the lid, and let it do its thing. It brews everything from small shots of espresso to full carafes of coffee, and it does it fast. The centrifugal brewing technology is intriguing. It spins the capsules at high speeds, ensuring a consistent blend and a naturally thick crema on every cup. The consistency of flavor and texture is where this machine truly shines.  

**Check [Nespresso ENV120BCA] price on Amazon.**  

**Winning Points**  
- Offers seven coffee sizes, including Ristretto, Espresso, and even styles like Cold Brew.  
- Produces a naturally rich crema that elevates the coffee experience.  
- Fully automatic capsule ejection keeps things clean and hassle-free.  
- Updates itself via Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, which felt like magic the first time it happened.  
 
**Areas of Concern**  
- The coffee pods are unique to this system, which means you‚Äôre limited to Nespresso-compatible pods, not third-party ones.  
- On occasion, the brewing process can be a bit noisy, something to consider if you brew coffee early in the morning.  

**Flexibility and Customization**  
Having Bluetooth smart technology and Wi-Fi compatibility in an espresso machine sounds like overkill, but it‚Äôs actually quite practical. The software updates mean you‚Äôre getting the best brewing experience at all times. It‚Äôs fantastic knowing that even without doing anything, my machine is staying ahead of the curve. The reusable filter option is an added perk for those who don‚Äôt want to stick strictly to capsules.

**Capacity and Maintenance**  
This machine handles everything from large mugs to tiny espresso cups with ease, and cleaning has been a breeze. The automatic capsule ejection is a lifesaver‚ÄîI no longer have to wrestle with used and often hot pods. That said, the water reservoir could have been a bit larger for those of us who consume multiple cups throughout the day.  

**Product Comparisons**  
Compared to traditional espresso makers like the Breville Barista Express, the Nespresso Vertuo Next is exponentially easier to operate. It doesn‚Äôt match the Breville‚Äôs hands-on customization potential, but not everyone needs to channel their inner barista every morning. Against competitors like the Keurig K-Caf√©, it edges ahead with its ability to produce genuine espresso-style coffee rather than just coffee-flavored beverages. Its versatility with multiple drink sizes‚Äîfrom a quick espresso to a shared pot of coffee‚Äîseems head and shoulders above many options out there.

**Price Performance**  
Considering the advanced technology and the seamless coffee experience, this machine offers excellent value for money. It caters to coffee enthusiasts who enjoy convenience without compromising on flavor or texture. Although the coffee pods can feel pricey compared to ground coffee or beans, the outcome in the cup justifies the expenditure. The programmable design, combined with features like automatic updates, really pushes the justification for its cost.

1nlayz5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewDaily/comments/1nlayz5/aqua_tower_review_does_this_diy_water_system_work/,Aqua Tower Review: Does This DIY Water System Work?,"[Aqua Tower Review](https://preview.redd.it/cqn9q5f6v5qf1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3f4c9325c02cc1fb377cfb184550a154bd92923)

I remember staring at the faucet one morning, turning the handle, and watching only a thin trickle of water come out. It was in that moment I realized how fragile comfort really is. We all think running water is permanent, but the truth is one bad drought, one local outage, and you‚Äôre suddenly scrambling. That fear pushed me to look for a real solution, something that didn‚Äôt depend on luck or a municipal promise.

What I found wasn‚Äôt some overpriced machine or a hyped-up gimmick. It was a simple blueprint that showed me how to build a system from scratch. I still remember gathering the parts‚Äîeasy to source, cheap enough that I didn‚Äôt feel like I was gambling my savings. Step by step, I followed along, and within a couple of afternoons, I had something sitting in my backyard that looked almost too simple to be powerful.

Then came the test. First morning, I opened the collection container, and there it was: clear, drinkable water pulled straight out of thin air. It‚Äôs hard to describe the rush that came with that first sip. It wasn‚Äôt just hydration‚Äîit was independence.

What shocked me most wasn‚Äôt just that it worked, but how fast it changed my day-to-day life. No more relying on bottled water runs. No more stressing about outages. The system just kept producing, quietly, consistently. And here‚Äôs the kicker‚Äîwhat started as a survival tool quickly turned into something bigger. I realized people in my community wanted this too. Friends came over, neighbors asked questions, and before long I wasn‚Äôt just the guy with a water backup‚ÄîI became the one showing others how to secure their own.

That‚Äôs when things shifted. What started as solving a personal problem became an opportunity. People were ready to pay for the solution, and because I had gone through the process myself, I could teach it with authority. It built trust fast. And with trust came income. Not some overnight jackpot, but steady growth. A side income turned into a dependable revenue stream, all from something that originally cost less than a weekend out.

Here‚Äôs the truth:

**‚Äî I never thought water could equal freedom. But it does.**  
**‚Äî I never thought a DIY system could open doors to financial stability. But it did.**  
**‚Äî I never thought survival planning would turn into a business opportunity. But it has.**

Looking back, I realize most people wait until crisis hits before they act. I didn‚Äôt wait. I got ahead. And because of that, I‚Äôm not just surviving anymore‚ÄîI‚Äôm thriving.

Now, every time I walk past that system humming quietly in my yard, I‚Äôm reminded of one thing: sometimes the smallest, most practical steps open the biggest doors in life.

When I first built the system, I‚Äôll be honest‚ÄîI was skeptical. The idea of pulling clean water out of the air sounded like one of those survival myths you read online. But the guide laid everything out in such plain steps that I figured, ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt tinkering with complicated electronics or buying obscure parts. Everything was off-the-shelf, things you can find at a hardware store without needing to explain some wild science project.

Once assembled, it worked on a principle that‚Äôs as old as nature itself: condensation. The system simply accelerated what the morning dew has been doing forever. Warm air flows in, it cools, and moisture condenses into usable liquid. But here‚Äôs where it surprised me‚Äîthe water wasn‚Äôt just collected, it was filtered. No metallic taste, no grit, just clean, clear drinking water.

On the first full day, I pulled about three gallons. That was enough to fill a couple of jugs, make coffee, cook dinner, and still have water to spare. As the days went on and the weather shifted, I learned how much output depended on humidity. On humid days, it churned out more than I could reasonably use. On drier days, production slowed, but it never stopped completely. Knowing I could count on a baseline supply changed everything.

What really impressed me was the durability. It wasn‚Äôt fragile. It didn‚Äôt feel like a gadget you‚Äôd have to baby or replace every few months. I‚Äôve left it running for weeks without touching it, and it keeps producing. The simplicity is the genius‚Äîfewer moving parts mean fewer chances of failure.

The biggest payoff? Freedom from dependency. I stopped worrying about sudden boil-water notices. I stopped stockpiling flats of bottled water. And in a way, it rewired my brain. Suddenly I was thinking more strategically about resources, sustainability, and self-reliance. That mindset carried over into other parts of life and business.

Here‚Äôs the part I didn‚Äôt expect: because I had real proof it worked, I started sharing my results online. Photos, numbers, and the process. That transparency drew people in. Before long, I wasn‚Äôt just the guy who solved his water problem‚ÄîI became the guy people trusted to show them how to do it too. That credibility led to opportunities, and opportunities turned into income.

**It gave me water when I needed it. It gave me confidence when the world felt shaky. And in the end, it gave me a way to get ahead‚Äînot by chance, but by taking action.**

1nlayua,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1nlayua/mom_has_taken_over_5k_for_bills/,Mom has taken over 5k for bills,"Hey ya'll, I (16M) kinda need some advice on how to get rid of this cycle I am in. Ever since around last year, my mom has been taking my paychecks.

Now, it started off with her saying that it'll only be a few months, but now it has spiraled into insanity. She has been asking me to sign my paychecks whenever I get it. It's even worse, because she works at the same place I work at and is a manager. So she comes home with my paycheck in hand waiting for me to sign it.

Now, I have tried multiple times to tell her that I don't want to do this, and that she has promised to let me start earning money again. But she either ignores me or says dumb excuses. Such as:

""If you didn't give me your paychecks, we would be homeless.""

""If you had your money, you would waste it all.""

When I specifically tell her I want to buy stuff with my money, she says, ""When have I never let you buy stuff?""

I wouldn't mind giving her money if I saw significant progress in recovering financially, but from what I've seen it's gotten worse! She's been buying expensive caffinateed drinks such as Starbucks and from a local coffee shop. She's been spending a whole Lotta money on stuff from this app called ""WhatNot,"" and then proceeds to never use the stuff in the package. It's insane.

So then I attempted to stop her by saying I won't be signing checks. In front of my brothers and dad as well. So she decided to play the victim and said we were ""The worst children and are so ungrateful for our mother.""

I would also think that since I give her a ton of money, she would at least have the decency to respect me. Nope! She likes to call me lazy whenever I don't work 2 days in a row (on top of school), and makes fun of my hobbies!

So I'm reaching out because I need help, I really want to break this cycle that I am in. It's been making me go crazy for the past year. And I need it to end. It's been really ruining my mental health, and it feels like I'll never escape. I know I can if I try, but God is it hard to...",1,1758305407.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

¬† Alex nodded as he put a Big Gulp coffee down in front of her.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCool,‚Äù breathed the girl, gazing out at the car. It was a Porsche Carrera, and the sunshine was glistening off it like liquid onyx. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt see cars like that around here very often. ‚Äù  
  
¬† No, I bet you don‚Äôt, thought Alex, trying to remember where here was. Cattle Chute, Oklahoma, or some such dismal place. HOME OF THE ROOTIN‚Äô-TOOTIN‚Äô COWBOYS! the bullet-ridden sign outside of town had proclaimed.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPump three,‚Äù he told her.  
  
¬† The girl smiled at him, widening her brown eyes as she rang up his coffee and the gas. ‚ÄúSo, are you new in town?‚Äù she asked. VICKY, said her name tag. She was almost as tall as he was ‚Äî which wasn‚Äôt that tall; he was just over five eleven ‚Äî and her brown hair had been ironed so straight that you could get a paper cut from it.  
  
¬† After-school job, he thought, pulling out his wallet. Sixteen or so. She probably goes to that giant high school that I passed just outside of town.  
  
¬† The thought irritated and amused him in equal measure. He had only seen high school on TV: jocks in their letterman jackets, cheerleaders jumping around the field, couples hanging on to each other at the senior prom. It was another world, one so stupidly innocent that it was frightening. High-school students were old enough to be fighting, but none of them were doing it.  
  
¬† Because hardly anyone actually knew that there was a war on.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNah, just passing through,‚Äù he said. He handed her a couple of twenties.  
  
¬† Vicky‚Äôs face fell. ‚ÄúOh. I was just wondering if you‚Äôd be going to our high school . . . but I guess you‚Äôre sort of old for that. What are you ‚Äî twenty-one or something?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOr something,‚Äù he said with a slight grin. He was actually seventeen, but she was right in a way. In all the ways that mattered, he was old.  
  
¬† She took her time getting his change. ‚ÄúHow long are you here for? Because, you know ‚Äî if you‚Äôre looking for something to do or maybe someone to show you around ‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† There was a beeping sound from his jeans pocket as his cell phone announced a text. Alex‚Äôs heart leaped. Turning away slightly, he pulled the phone out and flipped it open.  
  
¬† ENEMY SIGHTED, ASPEN, CO, RESIDENCE, 1124 TYLER ST.  
  
¬† Yes! Immediately, Alex felt the fierce buzz sweep over him that he always got when there‚Äôd been a sighting. Christ, finally ‚Äî it had been over a week; he‚Äôd been going insane. Putting his phone back in his pocket, he smiled at Vicky. Why not? He‚Äôd never see her again, anyway.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMaybe next time,‚Äù he said, picking up his coffee. ‚ÄúThanks, though. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSure,‚Äù she said, trying to smile back. ‚ÄúWell . . . have a good trip. ‚Äù  
  
¬† As Alex pushed open the swinging door, the too-cold air-conditioning abruptly gave way to a flat, burning September. He slid into the Porsche. It was low to the ground, and its black leather seats wrapped around him in a dark embrace. It was comfortable as hell, actually, which was good, since he practically lived in it. ASPEN, CO, he punched into the GPS. Estimated time of arrival, 2:47 a. m. Almost nine hours. He‚Äôd drive straight through, he decided, taking a gulp of coffee. He didn‚Äôt need sleep ‚Äî God, that was all he‚Äôd been doing since his last assignment.  
  
¬† Pulling out of the parking lot, Alex turned onto Highway 34 and headed north out of town. If you could call it a town: there were a few dozen grids of streets with clapboard houses and a couple of long, brightly lit strip malls, where the rootin‚Äô-tootin‚Äô teenagers probably cruised up and down on Saturday night, drinking Bud Lights and shouting at each other. Just outside the town limits, it all ended and became dust and grain silos and oil pumps. Setting the cruise control to seventy, Alex turned on the radio. The Eagles came on, warbling about the Hotel California, and he grimaced. Switching to his iPod instead, he put on some neoclassical as the Porsche began to smoothly eat the miles.  
  
¬† And, briefly, he wondered what Vicky would think if she knew he had a semiautomatic rifle in his trunk.  
  
¬† The Rocky Mountains cradled Aspen deep within them, like a giant‚Äôs palm lightly cupping a handful of diamonds. The road twisted and turned down the mountain as Alex approached the city, his headlights sweeping the dark asphalt in front of him. Startled rabbits froze on the side of the road, their eyes wide, and once he disturbed a buck, sending it crashing and leaping into the woods.  
  
¬† His car clock read 2:51 as he crossed into the Aspen city limits. Not bad. The GPS directed him to Tyler Street, a quiet, tree-lined avenue not far from downtown. One of the streetlights was flickering; the rest glowed silently, showing a row of houses with large bay windows and immaculate front lawns. No house lights were on. Everyone was asleep.  
  
¬† Alex parked his car a few doors down from number 1124. Propping his elbows against the steering wheel, he surveyed the house, his dark eyebrows drawn together thoughtfully. Sometimes you could see a sign of them if you knew what to look for, but there was nothing here. It was just an ordinary house, though the front lawn wasn‚Äôt quite as pristine as the others. A few weeds grew here and there, spiking rebelliously up through the grass.  
  
¬† Letting down the neighborhood ‚Äî tsk, tsk, thought Alex.  
  
¬† He‚Äôd transferred his rifle to the front seat before he began the descent into Aspen, and now he clicked the magazine into place and sighted along the rifle‚Äôs length, squinting through the infrared lens at the house. The front door snapped into an eerie reddish focus. He could even read the name on the wrought-iron mailbox that was affixed to the front porch wall: T. GOODMAN.  
  
¬† Goodman. Alex snorted despite himself. The creatures often took human last names to help them blend in; nice to see that some of them had a sense of humor. He screwed the silencer onto the rifle‚Äôs muzzle. It was state of the art, as sleek and gleaming as the rifle itself. Now all he had to do was wait. He settled back in his seat, gazing at the house. Back in the days when they‚Äôd gone out in teams, the other AKs had always hated stakeouts, but they were part of the hunt to Alex. Part of the buzz. Your senses had to be on alert; you couldn‚Äôt relax for a moment.  
  
¬† Almost an hour later, the front door opened. He had the rifle in place in less than a second, watching carefully through the lens. The tall man on the front porch paused to lock the door, then jogged briskly down the steps and strode off down the street, his footsteps echoing with purpose.  
  
¬† Alex lowered the rifle, unsurprised that T. Goodman was in his human form ‚Äî they normally showed their true nature only when they were feeding. He waited until Goodman had turned the corner, heading toward downtown. Then he got out of his car and softly opened the trunk. He pulled on a black trench coat, eased the trunk closed again and set off, the rifle hidden safely beneath the coat‚Äôs long folds.  
  
¬† As he turned the corner, he could see his quarry about a block away, crossing the street. He slowed, letting his gaze drift out of focus. An aura swam into view around the dark figure: pale silver, with a faint blue light flickering feebly at its edges.  
  
¬† Alex quickened his step. The creature hadn‚Äôt fed in days ‚Äî which meant that he must be on the hunt now.  
  
¬† Sure enough, the man led him to a bar downtown. SPURS, flashed the sign in front. A yellow-and-pink neon figure of a cowgirl wearing shorts and a tiny leather vest flashed on and off, waving her hat. There was the heavy pulse of music and a chorus of raucous male cheers.

Recognizing the sign, Alex shook his head in grudging admiration. Spurs was one of those places where the female wait staff wore sexy clothes and danced on the bar. The men staggering out at this hour would be drunk and rowdy, not paying much attention to their surroundings ‚Äî ideal if you were on the hunt. It was just the sort of place that he‚Äôd have chosen himself, in fact.  
  
¬† A pair of bored-looking bouncers flanked the front door. T. Goodman melted into the shadows nearby, attracting no attention from either of them. Half a street away, Alex took up a position behind a parked Subaru, mentally calculating the fallout distance. He‚Äôd be fine, he decided; he‚Äôd gone for much closer than this in his time. The bouncers might catch some flak, though.  
  
¬† Just then the heavy metal door to Spurs swung open, and a man wearing a disheveled business suit stumbled out. ‚ÄúExcellent night, my man,‚Äù he said, slapping one of the bouncers on the shoulder. ‚ÄúThose ladies are goo-od. ‚Äù He shook his head in wonder, as if the power to describe just how good was beyond him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah, they‚Äôre real hot,‚Äù said the bouncer, looking amused.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHope you‚Äôre not planning on driving, Eddie,‚Äù said the other one. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you let us call you a cab?‚Äù  
  
¬† Eddie made no reply. He wove off down the street, humming tunelessly to himself. One of his stumbling feet caught an empty beer can, and the sound of it echoed through the night. The bouncers glanced at each other and shrugged. Not their problem.  
  
¬† Alex straightened as T. Goodman detached himself from the gloom and trailed off after the man, a tall, silent shadow. With the rifle propped firmly against his shoulder, Alex began to track him. It would be any second now; he was sure of it. They didn‚Äôt need privacy, just a relatively clear field. Not taking his eyes off Goodman, Alex drew a deep breath to center himself and then swiftly moved the focus of his energy up through his chakra points until it hovered somewhere above his crown.  
  
¬† Immediately, he felt a slight shudder pass through him as the creature locked minds with its prey. He had been right ‚Äî this was it. Wavering, Eddie stopped in his tracks, looking uncertain. Slowly, he turned around.  
  
¬† With a dark ripple, Goodman‚Äôs human body melted away. A blinding, glorious light grew in its place until it was like a beacon that shone up and down the street, illuminating everything ‚Äî the bar, the other buildings, Eddie‚Äôs small, frightened face. And at the center of the light was a glowing being seven feet tall, whose giant, spreading wings were such a pure white that they looked almost blue.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúJesus Christ,‚Äù breathed Eddie as the angel drew toward him.  
  
¬† Half a street away, Alex could hear the bouncers laughing with a woman who‚Äôd stopped to ask them for a light. If any of them glanced this way, all they‚Äôd see would be Eddie standing on his own, wobbling drunkenly on the dark street.  
  
¬† Leaning over the top of the car, Alex squinted through the lens, his hands cool and steady as he aimed the rifle. The angel‚Äôs face came into focus, magnified several times. As a human, Goodman was as physically attractive as all angels, though Alex knew that if he‚Äôd gotten a good look at his face, it would have seemed slightly weird ‚Äî too intense, with eyes maybe a shade too dark for comfort. But now, in his ethereal form, Goodman‚Äôs features had an almost otherworldly beauty: proud, fierce. The halo that framed them radiated like holy fire.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be afraid,‚Äù soothed the angel in a voice that was a hundred chiming bells. ‚ÄúI am here for a reason. I need to give you something. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Eddie dropped to his knees, eyes bulging. ‚ÄúI ‚Äî I ‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† The halo. Alex sighted on it, aiming for the deep, pure white at its heart.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt hurt,‚Äù continued the angel, drawing closer. It smiled then, and its radiance increased tenfold, burning the night. Trembling, Eddie moaned and ducked his head, unable to bear the beauty of it.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIn fact, you‚Äôll remember this as the most meaningful experience of your life ‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† Alex pulled the trigger. As the pulsing energy of the angel‚Äôs halo was disrupted by the force of the bullet, the creature burst, without a sound, into a million shooting fragments of light. Alex ducked behind the car as a shock wave slammed past him, the angel‚Äôs scream of anguish echoing in his ears. Still in his enhanced state, he could see the energy fields of every living thing nearby affected by the aftershock: the ghostly outline of a tree, of a few stray blades of grass ‚Äî all of them dancing and warping as if buffeted by a hurricane.  
  
¬† Slowly, everything returned to normal. There was silence. Alex brought his energy focus back to his heart chakra, and the ghostly outlines disappeared. He shoved his rifle under the car for the moment, then walked over to Eddie, who still knelt, trembling, on the sidewalk. T. Goodman was gone, with no sign of him left.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHey, man, you OK?‚Äù said Alex easily, crouching beside Eddie. The bouncers had stopped talking and were looking in their direction. Alex raised a casual hand to them. Everything‚Äôs fine. Dude‚Äôs just a bit drunk is all.  
  
¬† Eddie turned a tearstained face toward him. He swallowed, shaking his head. ‚ÄúI ‚Äî there was ‚Äî I know you won‚Äôt believe me, but ‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah, I know,‚Äù said Alex. ‚ÄúCome on, let‚Äôs get you up. ‚Äù He put an arm around Eddie and helped him to his feet. Jesus, the guy could try dieting a little.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh, God . . . I‚Äôve got such a headache,‚Äù moaned Eddie, leaning limply against Alex‚Äôs shoulder. Angel fallout, thought Alex. Eddie had only been a few feet away, and though most of it had blasted straight back at Alex, he‚Äôd still feel the effects for days. It was better than angel burn, though.  
  
¬† Anything was better than that.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt was so beautiful,‚Äù mumbled Eddie, his head lolling limply. ‚ÄúSo goddamn beautiful. . . . ‚Äù  
  
¬† Alex rolled his eyes. ‚ÄúYeah, real beautiful,‚Äù he muttered. He started walking back toward the bar with Eddie shuffling along beside him. As usual, he felt the mix of pity and contempt that he always felt for civilians. Though he spent his life trying to save them, they were all so clueless that he didn‚Äôt get much pleasure from it.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHey, I think our friend here needs a cab,‚Äù he said when he reached the bouncers. ‚ÄúFound him passed out on the sidewalk over there. ‚Äù  
  
¬† One of the bouncers chuckled. ‚ÄúYeah, we‚Äôll take care of it,‚Äù he said, taking the businessman‚Äôs weight from Alex. ‚ÄúOld Eddie‚Äôs a regular here, aren‚Äôt you, buddy?‚Äù  
  
¬† Eddie rolled his head, struggling to focus. ‚ÄúTom . . . I saw an angel,‚Äù he slurred.  
  
¬† The bouncers burst out laughing. ‚ÄúYeah, you mean Amber, right?‚Äù said the other one. ‚ÄúShe wears those really short shorts while she‚Äôs dancing around on the bar. ‚Äù He winked at Alex. ‚ÄúHey, you wanna go in? No cover charge; our treat. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Alex had been in plenty of places like this in his time, mostly dragged along by the other AKs when he was younger. He thought they were boring as hell, to be honest. And though a drink sounded good, the thought of sitting in a Spurs with his adrenaline still pumping from the kill was a little too surreal, even for him.  
  
¬† He shook his head, taking a step backward. ‚ÄúNah, maybe next time. I‚Äôd better get going. Thanks, though. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnytime,‚Äù said the first bouncer. Eddie had passed out for real by then, slumped against the man‚Äôs broad shoulder like a sack of potatoes. The bouncer shifted his bulk impatiently. ‚ÄúHey, Mike, you gonna call that cab company, or what? Sleeping Beauty here is fading fast.

Yeah, tell him to lay off the hard stuff,‚Äù said Alex with a grin. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll be seeing pink elephants next. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTHIS IS SO EMBARRASSING,‚Äù muttered Nina. She was leaning against the driver‚Äôs-side door with her arms crossed over her chest, shaking her head in disapproval.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDo you want it fixed or not?‚Äù I demanded. My voice came out muffled, because my head was buried somewhere deep in her Corvette‚Äôs engine, along with most of my upper body. I was trying to replace her carburetor, but her engine was so filthy that the nuts were practically welded in place with gasket grime ‚Äî which is black and gross, in case you‚Äôre wondering.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWould you hand me that wrench? The one with the yellow handle?‚Äù  
  
¬† Nina grumbled to herself as she crouched down to rummage through my tools. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you actually have a toolbox. I can‚Äôt believe you brought it to school with you. ‚Äù She shoved the wrench into my hand.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúFine ‚Äî should I stop? Just say the word. ‚Äù I‚Äôd already removed her air filter by then and disconnected the fuel line and vacuum hoses. We were in the school parking lot because I had figured it would be easier doing it there than in my garage at home, which is stuffed to the gills with old boxes and bicycles and crap that my aunt keeps meaning to throw out but hasn‚Äôt gotten around to yet. I had clearly reckoned without the embarrassment factor, though. Story of my life.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWillow! Don‚Äôt you dare,‚Äù hissed Nina, pulling at her brown bangs. ‚ÄúLook, don‚Äôt get all sensitive. Yes, I want it fixed; I just didn‚Äôt know that you were going to do it here ‚Äî that‚Äôs all. ‚Äù  
  
¬† She glanced furtively over her shoulder at the playing field, obviously keeping an eye out for Scott Mason and his gang of swaggering football heroes. The school day was long over with, but football practice was still going strong. Meanwhile, the student parking lot was like an empty gray ocean around us, with only a few stray cars dotted about here and there.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúJust be thankful I didn‚Äôt do it at lunchtime,‚Äù I told her. ‚ÄúI do have some sense of decorum, you know. Oh, come on, you ‚Äî‚Äù I gritted my teeth as I struggled to turn the wrench, putting all of my weight on it. All at once the nut gave way. ‚ÄúHa! Success. ‚Äù I spun it free, then pulled the old carburetor out and checked it against the new one. Perfect match. Which was sort of a miracle, given that Nina‚Äôs Corvette practically belonged in the Smithsonian.  
  
¬† Nina wrinkled her nose. ‚ÄúDecorum? You? Don‚Äôt make me laugh. Like, what are you wearing?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúClothes?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWillow. You look like . . . I don‚Äôt know; I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs even a word for it. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúReally? Cool. ‚Äù I grinned as I wiped my hands off on a piece of wadding. ‚ÄúThat means I‚Äôm unique, right?‚Äù Despite the chill in the air, I was wearing a short-sleeved 1950s brocade blouse with my favorite pair of battered jeans. My black velvet jacket was draped over Nina‚Äôs open hood, out of harm‚Äôs way. I‚Äôd bought most of it at Tammy‚Äôs Attic, which has to be my favorite store ever.  
  
¬† Nina closed her eyes and groaned. ‚ÄúUnique. Yes, you could say that. Oh, my God, Pawtucket is so not ready for you. ‚Äù  
  
¬† This was so true that it wasn‚Äôt even worth debating. Instead I took a screwdriver and started to scrape clean the area where the old carburetor had been, getting rid of all the old dirt and gasket material. Beyond gross. Picture a coal pit that‚Äôs fallen into an oil slick.  
  
¬† Nina opened her eyes and peered under the hood. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing now?‚Äù she asked warily.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGetting rid all of your disgusting grime. ‚Äù I showed her the wrench, which was now thick with black goo. ‚ÄúWant to help?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúEww, no. ‚Äù She sighed and leaned against the side of the car again, twiddling a piece of hair around her finger. ‚ÄúAnyway, what do you have to clean it for? Can‚Äôt you just shove the new one in?‚Äù  
  
¬† A strand of my long blond hair fell down as I was working, and I tucked it back behind my ear without looking up. ‚ÄúGood idea. Then it wouldn‚Äôt have a perfect seal, so it would start sucking in air like a dying vacuum cleaner, and ‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† Nina straightened up again with a jolt. ‚ÄúOh, my God! Here comes Beth Hartley!‚Äù  
  
¬† Beth Hartley was one of the stars of Pawtucket High ‚Äî slim, beautiful, good grades, et cetera. She was a year older than us, almost eighteen, and a senior. Even apart from that, we didn‚Äôt exactly move in the same circles. She was on every club and committee there was and basically lived at school. In fact, I think they‚Äôd shut the place down if she ever couldn‚Äôt come in for some reason. The teachers would all go on strike.  
  
¬† I poured some solvent onto a clean rag and started swabbing it around the empty space where the carburetor had been. ‚ÄúWhat was it today, do you think?‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúCheerleading? Prom committee? Saving the world?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWillow, this isn‚Äôt funny,‚Äù moaned Nina. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs heading right toward us!‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo? I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs seen a carburetor before. ‚Äù Nina stared at me. There was a beat, and then I realized what I‚Äôd said and started laughing. ‚ÄúOh. Maybe not, huh?‚Äù  
  
¬† Nina huffed out a breath, looking like she couldn‚Äôt decide whether to throttle me or join in laughing. ‚ÄúLook, I know you don‚Äôt care, but most people already think you‚Äôre Queen Weird, you know. This is not going to help matters, believe me ‚Äî‚Äù She fell abruptly silent as Beth walked up.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHi,‚Äù said Beth, looking uncertainly from Nina to me. She had long, honey-colored hair and makeup that was always so subtle and perfect that you could barely tell she had it on. Which had always seemed sort of a waste of time to me ‚Äî spending hours putting on makeup that looked invisible once you were done ‚Äî but there you go.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHi,‚Äù I said back, poking my head out from underneath the hood.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHi, Beth,‚Äù said Nina faintly. ‚ÄúGood drama club meeting?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYearbook,‚Äù corrected Beth. ‚ÄúYeah, great. ‚Äù She was staring at the open hood and me under it. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre . . . fixing Nina‚Äôs car,‚Äù she said. It was halfway between a question and a statement.  
  
¬† I nodded. ‚ÄúHer carburetor. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCarburetor. Right,‚Äù echoed Beth, blinking her wide brown eyes.  
  
¬† There was a pause. I could see Beth mentally shaking her head to clear it and then deciding that, actually, she didn‚Äôt really want to pursue the carburetor thing. She cleared her throat. ‚ÄúWillow, I just wondered whether you had the homework assignment for Atkinson‚Äôs class. I wasn‚Äôt there yesterday. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I felt my eyebrows fly up. I hadn‚Äôt realized that Beth even knew we were in the same class. Or in the same school. Or on the same planet. On second thought, scratch that ‚Äî we probably weren‚Äôt on the same planet. And why was she asking me, anyway? A dozen of her perfect friends were in that class.  
  
¬† I shrugged. ‚ÄúYeah, sure ‚Äî it‚Äôs in my red folder. ‚Äù I motioned toward my schoolbag, which was sitting beside the open toolbox on the ground. ‚ÄúWould you mind? My hands are all ‚Äî‚Äù I held them up to show her, and she blanched.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGreat, thanks. ‚Äù She slipped the folder out of my bag and quickly scribbled down the assignment. As she put the folder back, she glanced at Nina and hesitated. She started to say something and stopped. Her neck turned bright pink.

The motion of my hand with the rag slowed as I looked at her in surprise. All at once I knew exactly what was coming; I had seen it too many times before to mistake the signs. Nina‚Äôs eyes widened as she realized the same thing. ‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôll . . . go get a drink of water,‚Äù she said, taking an ultra-casual step backward. I could tell she was thinking the same thing I was: Beth Hartley? Really? Miss Perfect?  
  
¬† Once Nina was gone, Beth edged closer to me, lowering her voice. ‚ÄúUm, Willow . . . ‚Äù She took a deep breath, running her manicured fingers through her hair. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard that you do . . . readings. Like, psychic ones,‚Äù she added quickly. Her face was bonfire red.  
  
¬† I nodded. ‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs right. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Beth seemed to catch her breath. Her expression was trying to be skeptical, but it was suddenly so hopeful and pleading that it was like having a puppy gaze at me. ‚ÄúWell ‚Äî are you any good?‚Äù she blurted out.  
  
¬† I shrugged as I started to install the new carburetor, tightening it into the intake manifold. ‚ÄúI guess so. I mean, not everything I see comes true, but most things seem to. And to be honest, the stuff that doesn‚Äôt is usually an alternate path. ‚Äù  
  
¬† She was watching me intently, taking in every word. ‚ÄúAn alternate path?‚Äù she repeated. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù  
  
¬† I thought about it as I tightened the nuts a bit at a time, keeping the pressure on the carburetor even. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like . . . you know, you have choices in your life. And sometimes I can see several choices unfolding and what might happen with each one. But they‚Äôre not all going to happen, because you‚Äôll only choose one of them. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Beth nodded slowly. ‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs exactly what I need help with,‚Äù she said, almost to herself. ‚ÄúChoices. ‚Äù She glanced back at the school. ‚ÄúWell ‚Äî would you read me sometime?‚Äù she asked in a rush. ‚ÄúLike ‚Äî soon?‚Äù  
  
¬† I blinked at the thought of Beth in my house ‚Äî the two really didn‚Äôt seem to go together ‚Äî but then I shrugged. ‚ÄúSure, OK. How about tomorrow after school? No, wait a minute ‚Äî how about Thursday?‚Äù I had forgotten for a second that the caregiver was leaving early the next day, and I‚Äôd promised Aunt Jo I‚Äôd get home on time to take care of Mom. I gave Beth my address.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be there,‚Äù said Beth fervently. Some of her yearbook committee friends had started coming out of the school building behind her by then. Hugging her bag to her chest, she moved off to join them. ‚ÄúAnd, Willow ‚Äî thanks,‚Äù she called softly over her shoulder.  
  
¬† I stared after her, feeling bemused. I guess I should know better than to pigeonhole people ‚Äî if being psychic has taught me anything, it‚Äôs that you really never know what kind of thoughts people might have bubbling away like witches‚Äô cauldrons under the surface of their ordinary lives ‚Äî but even so, Beth Hartley. Strange, I thought as I tightened the final nut.  
  
¬† Nina reappeared, her expression practically bursting with Tell me everything!  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe wants a reading,‚Äù I said, to ward off the inevitable.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI knew it!‚Äù exclaimed Nina. ‚ÄúI could just tell, the way she was acting all furtive. ‚Äù She shook her head, looking dazed. ‚ÄúGod. I can‚Äôt believe that Beth Hartley even believes in that junk. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Nina is about the least imaginative, most prosaic person in the entire world and is convinced that anything psychic is a con. Not that she thinks I‚Äôm a con, necessarily. Just that I‚Äôm conning myself. Being dramatic, making things up without realizing it, getting carried away ‚Äî that sort of thing. She thinks I should be an actress, because I‚Äôm obviously so in tune with my inner child. It‚Äôs sort of amazing that we‚Äôre even friends, really. But I‚Äôve known her since I was nine, which is when Mom and I first moved to Pawtucket to live with Aunt Jo, and I guess we‚Äôve just gotten to be a habit with each other.  
  
¬† Nina was peering in under the hood at me, shaking her head. ‚ÄúWillow, you do know that you should stop all this psychic stuff, don‚Äôt you? Half the school thinks you‚Äôre a witch. ‚Äù  
  
¬† My cheeks grew warm. ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs not my fault,‚Äù I muttered. I was almost finished, which was a good thing, because Nina was really starting to irritate me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt is your fault,‚Äù Nina insisted. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to keep doing readings, do you? No, you don‚Äôt! Here‚Äôs a radical thought ‚Äî just say no the next time someone asks. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I didn‚Äôt say anything as I put Nina‚Äôs air filter back in place. Distantly, I could hear the football team still practicing on the field, their shoulder pads thudding against each other. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do that,‚Äù I said finally, straightening up from the car. I wiped my hands clean and started putting my tools away.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù screeched Nina in exasperation.  
  
¬† I spun to face her. ‚ÄúBecause people have problems, Nina! All kinds of problems, and I think maybe ‚Äî I think maybe I help them. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh, my God, Willow, you are seriously deluded if you think ‚Äî‚Äù Nina broke off as I grabbed my jacket and slammed her hood shut.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHere,‚Äù I said, tossing her keys at her. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got to prime it before you drive it again ‚Äî give the gas a few pumps first. ‚Äù Before she could answer, I had gathered up my things and stalked off.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúFine, be that way,‚Äù she called after me. ‚ÄúYou know I‚Äôm right, though. See you tomorrow. Thanks for fixing my car, you lunatic. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I waved at her without turning around. My own car was a battered blue Toyota; I climbed in, piled my stuff on the passenger seat, and started the ignition. It purred like a kitten, of course. I might get awful grades, but I am good with engines.  
  
¬† I pushed a blues cassette into the tape deck as I pulled out of the parking lot ‚Äî OK, so the twenty-first century hasn‚Äôt quite reached my sound system yet ‚Äî and headed down Highway 12 toward home. The conversation with Beth tugged at my mind, refusing to let go. She had seemed so anxious, as if getting a reading was the most urgent thing in the world.  
  
¬† Choices. That‚Äôs exactly what I need help with.  
  
¬† Unease flickered through me, and I frowned, wondering why I felt so apprehensive. Being psychic isn‚Äôt like everyone thinks ‚Äî I‚Äôm not some all-knowing, all-seeing guru. No, I can‚Äôt predict the winning lottery number, and ‚Äî ha, ha ‚Äî yes, I get caught in the rain just the same as everyone else.  
  
¬† The truth is, I get flashes or feelings sometimes, but I don‚Äôt tend to get anything too specific unless I have some sort of connection, like holding someone‚Äôs hand. Plus, I have to have the mental space to relax and clear my head. If I‚Äôm upset or excited, then I don‚Äôt usually get much ‚Äî and, anyway, it‚Äôs not the kind of thing that you could go around doing all the time, at least not without going seriously insane. So in general I just live my life like the rest of the world, without really knowing how things are going to unfold.  
  
¬† But I do get some pretty strong intuitions at times . . . and I was having one now, about Beth. I bit my lip as I slowed down for a crossroad.  
  
¬† Whatever her choices were, I had a very bad feeling about them.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPancakes,‚Äù said Alex, gazing down at the menu. ‚ÄúAnd scrambled eggs and bacon, with a side of hash browns. And toast. ‚Äù He was starving. It was always like this after a kill; he felt as if he hadn‚Äôt eaten for a week.

1nlatpe,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeLoadout/comments/1nlatpe/find_out_if_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker/,Find Out if the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker from Keurig Delivers,"Sipping on my morning coffee has always been my sacred routine, and switching to the Keurig K-Elite was like inviting a sleek, tech-savvy barista into my kitchen. From its brushed silver finish to the array of features that cater to both coffee enthusiasts and those seeking a quick caffeine fix, this machine has carved out a prime spot on my counter. While it‚Äôs an impressive gadget, there are a few quirks worth mentioning.

**Design That Stands Out**  
One look at the Keurig K-Elite, and it‚Äôs clear this coffee maker wasn‚Äôt designed to blend into the background. The brushed silver exterior feels premium, giving it an upscale vibe without being too flashy. It fits beautifully in my modern kitchen setup, although its dimensions (9.9"" D x 12.7"" W x 13.1"" H) lean on the bulkier side. If your counter space is at a premium, this might be a consideration. The intuitive button layout made it pretty simple to navigate, even for a caffeine-deprived version of myself first thing in the morning.

**Good Aspects**  
- Attractive, premium brushed silver design  
- Easy-to-use button interface  
- Thoughtful additions like a removable drip tray and large reservoir  

**Performance That Delivers**  
This coffee maker means business when it comes to performance. My mornings have become easier with its lightning-fast brewing capability. Whether I crave a robust, strong coffee or a mellow one, the Strong Brew button ensures customizable flavor. The iced coffee setting was a surprise hit during hot afternoons, producing full-flavored iced coffee without diluting the taste. Plus, the 75-ounce removable water reservoir is a timesaver‚ÄîI hate refilling water tanks constantly, and this got me through multiple cups seamlessly. The only hiccup I noticed was the noise during brewing; not crazy loud, but it‚Äôs there.

[Check Keurig K-Elite price on Amazon.](https://windtoons.com/p/b0788f3r8x/)  

**Features That Stand Out**  
Having grown up in a family that thrived on convenience, I appreciated the host of features this machine packs in. The temperature control, adjustable between 187¬∞F and 192¬∞F, lets me tweak the warmth of each cup to perfection. Those who live in high-altitude areas will appreciate the high-altitude setting‚ÄîI recommended this to a friend in Denver, and it worked like a charm for them. Being someone who often forgets to descale appliances, the descaling reminder has been a lifesaver, and the hot water on demand button is a bonus for my occasional lazy oatmeal mornings.

**Drawbacks to Keep in Mind**  
- Slightly noisy during operation  
- Larger footprint may not suit compact kitchens  

**Competing Brands**  
Having explored other single-serve options like the Nespresso Vertuo and Breville Bambino, there‚Äôs plenty to compare. The Nespresso‚Äôs luxurious crema and sleek design are undeniably tempting for espresso lovers. However, the versatility of the Keurig, especially with K-Cup pods, pulls ahead in catering to larger households or varied taste preferences. While Breville machines deliver caf√©-quality drinks, they demand a steeper learning curve compared to the simplicity here. For iced coffee diehards or bulk-brewers, this Keurig stands apart.

**Bang for the Buck**  
When weighing the price against all it offers, this coffee maker holds its ground. Versatility is its primary strength‚Äîaccommodating different cup sizes from 4 to 12 ounces, brewing on-demand hot water, and offering a robust iced coffee feature. Compared to rival single-serve machines, it‚Äôs not the cheapest but brings an impressive mix of value and convenience. It feels like a solid investment for those who rely on a quick morning coffee ritual, but perfectionists craving artisanal espressos might find themselves gravitating elsewhere.

1nlard2,https://www.reddit.com/r/PDAAutism/comments/1nlard2/im_having_trouble_dealing_with_what_i_did/,I'm having trouble dealing with what I did yesterday during a meltdown.,"Mornings are always bad for me. I'm PDA and irritable about having to go to work every day. I have a very difficult relationship with ""taking lunch"". I tend to just work right through, or consider lunch to be any of my lengthy breaks during my 8.5 hour workday. Vyvanse suppresses my appetite and my energy drink coffee replacement suppresses it further. I always drink a protein shake every morning when taking my meds, so at least I'm not completely unfed. Also, because of my PDA, lunch feels like something I ***NEED*** to eat rather than *want* to eat (lack of appetite). So I resist it in the moment, even though I know I should. Hell, I'd even say I **want** to eat it, but my body doesn't. I'm always at constant war with my body, we are two different people and want different things and we always fight each other over everything.

The specifics leading up to this start on Monday. My boss ordered lunch. I ate the appetizer but did not even touch the main dish, a circular burrito/taco thing. I should have just got the appetizer alone.

The lunch travelled back and forth with me for the rest of the week until Thursday morning. I had put it in a glass container because the paper packaging was deteriorating. I fumbled my keys and hands trying to unlock my car. My lunch dropped and shattered. I was so stuck on this lunch, so fixated on it, determined I would keep trying to eat it day after day... until I lost it. Mot only that, but I lost a part of my nice dishware container set. I could get more at Costco but they're expensive and then I'd have too many of the other kinds. My boss paid for the food...

That's when it really went bad. You see, my reaction to REALLY BAD emotions, usually directed at myself, is to hit my head repeatedly to the point where I may have a series of minor concussions throughout my life. I either hit my head with my fists, or by bashing it against something. My hands were full and the only thing in front of me was... my car... I put a dent in the upper panel above the door.

Once I realized what I did... I totally lost it. I screamed at the top of my lungs 3 times in a couple minutes, I kicked a concrete wall so hard that my toe started bleeding (didn't find out until 9 hours later), I punched concrete and metal bars until my hand was bruised and scraped, I got on my knees and slammed the ground with my hands. How could I have been so stupid to fuck up my own car?

I'm never *ever* violent to other people, only myself. I have a lot of self-hatred, always have. Uninstall-life ideation has ALWAYS been a part of me. My very first memory is a vague emotional trauma, of witnessing my own mother end her own life with a gun. Too young for details in the memory, not so young that it didn't fuck me up for life. It's something I will never do, doesn't stop a person from wishing they were never born tho. 

*(This is getting more difficult to write, I'm realizing my hands are starting to shake at this point. I must be feeling some sort of emotion but I don't know what it is, goddamn alexithymia.)*

Aside from ""angry"" I still don't know how to explain my feelings at the time. Extreme disappointment? Sadness? Depression? Guilt? Overwhelmed? Frustrated? Despair? Greif? Inferior? Embarrased? Shame? *(I'm looking at the emotion wheel-chart at this point)* Feeling like a miserable failure? Why am I like this? What's wrong with me? Why can't I just be normal?

I went back inside and sat down, laid down, paced. My partner had to walk to work that day as we normally drive, I had to call in sick for the rest of the week. My partner was very scared, but I would never and will never hurt them. I just don't know how to handle such big emotions. I tried to settle myself and regulate my emotions, but found it too difficult. I went on a walkabout. I walked for 3 hours straight away from my home. I left my wallet, took my keys and half-drained phone. I walked straight west, following the path my partner takes. 30 minutes later I reach it and then I turned south for 2.5 hours but stopped at a park for 30 minutes in that time. All this time I'm still feeling big emotions. I guess I was trying to find a release valve by walking off the excess energy, but also combining it with self-punishment. Lots more head hitting occurred, giving me a moderate headache all day, and a light one still today.

So 3 hours later the excess energy finally burned off and I'm far from home with a nearly dead phone, no desire to ask anyone I know for a ride because I couldn't explain why I needed it, and no methods of payment. I sat/laid down at a bus stop for an hour in a remote suburb in the hills on the edge of town for the next 45 minutes while nursing a good headache and sore feet.

I get on the first bus to come by and empty my pockets. I had picked up a mint candy much earlier, still in the wrapper, on the side of the road near my home. Very likely to be my partner's. Same kind as we always have at home; my partner has clumsy hands too and always keeps a few on hand. I put the mint in the coin collector as payment and went to sit down, no fuss made. The bus almost immediately turns a corner and goes further south. Oh the cruel irony! Eventually we circle back to a bus exchange closer to home, where I continue to nurse my headache in the hot sun. 3rd week of September, always summer's last heatwave before the fall sets in. I look at the routes and find the one heading closest to home. I'm limping due to the pain in my concrete-kicking foot now. I get on the next bus on that route 45 minutes later. Once again I empty my pockets, and now have no form of payment at all. The driver waves me in and I go sit down. 15 minutes later I'm home, now 3pm where I lay down in bed and mindlessly scroll reddit until 2am. 11 hours of unsettling restlessness. I never ate a single thing all day. I didn't even have my morning protein shake until 6pm.

Today I woke at 6am. Just 4 hours of sleep. Stupid alarm clock. I already called in sick, it should just know that, right?! I just don't know what to do with myself. Most of the big uncontrollable energy from that event is gone now, so I'm just sitting in the crater that is my life. Just another self-destructive blow up. Truly miserable. My partner and I barely talked yesterday. They had to stay super super late at work because this week has been so bad already before all this. My partner pulls back and ""goes into their turtle shell"" whenever sad or scary things happen. I'm sure my partner still trusts me, and I swear that trust will never be misplaced. So until my partner feels safe coming out of their turtle shell, I just have to wait and maintain stability to provide a safe environment. I feel lonely not having anyone to talk to about this. So I'm blasting it out to internet strangers.

So, say to me whatever comes to you. Whether it's to tell me I'm a piece of shit or whatever, I don't care. I just had to write this in some attempt to try to make sense of the constant chaos that is my life.",2,1758304932.0,PDAAutism,0,1.0,False
1nlaqpr,https://www.reddit.com/r/TriedAndRated/comments/1nlaqpr/how_scrolling_turned_into_something_more_than/,How Scrolling Turned Into Something More Than Just a Hobby,"I‚Äôve always been that friend who‚Äôs glued to Instagram and Facebook. Living in Chicago, my days were split between a part-time retail job and endless hours of scrolling. My coworkers used to joke that I knew about trending memes before they even hit our group chat.

Still, I couldn‚Äôt shake the frustration of being stuck in a dead-end job. I wanted flexibility‚Äîsomething I could do from home, where I didn‚Äôt have to beg for weekends off or miss out on family events. I dreamed about remote work, but every time I searched online, it felt like a maze of scams and dead leads.

[One night, while sipping coffee and halfheartedly scrolling on my phone, I stumbled onto Paying Social Media Jobs. At first, I rolled my eyes‚ÄîI mean, who really gets paid for posting online? But curiosity got the better of me, and I started reading more. It wasn‚Äôt about becoming ‚Äúinternet famous‚Äù; it was about helping small businesses manage their accounts‚Äîscheduling posts, replying to comments, keeping engagement alive. Things I was already doing for fun.](https://freezegluco.com/payingsocialmediajobs.html)

I decided to give it a shot. The first gig I landed was for a local caf√© that needed help promoting their seasonal drinks. I created simple posts, shared their daily specials, and interacted with their customers online. Within two weeks, they told me their foot traffic had picked up‚Äîand they wanted me to keep working with them.

That little boost of confidence turned into bigger opportunities. Soon I was managing pages for a yoga studio and even a boutique clothing shop. I wasn‚Äôt making millions, but the extra income meant I could cut back on retail hours and actually breathe. For the first time in years, I had control of my schedule.

The moment it really hit me was on a random Tuesday morning. Instead of rushing to fold clothes under harsh fluorescent lights, I was working from my kitchen table, laptop open, coffee steaming, and my dog curled at my feet. I realized I‚Äôd gone from scrolling just to pass time‚Äîto actually building something that gave me freedom.

Now, when I open Instagram, it‚Äôs not just about likes or stories‚Äîit‚Äôs a reminder that the thing I used to do for fun turned into a way of living life on my own terms.",1,1758304893.0,TriedAndRated,0,1.0,False

Ive come across the concepts on conical and flat burrs grinders, and i saw the conical gives more of ""chocolaty complex taste"" and flatt burrs give ""clear flavour taste"" 


Now If i get conical burr grinder for coffe and it masks the real taste of specefic bean, unlike the flatt burr which is more clear, then what is the point in trying different coffee beans if all of them will likely taste more or less ""the same""?

I just want my espresso to be single short shot(7gram) ,  with heavy body, heavy crema. And i repeat heavy crema.

I know puck preparation and espresso machine pressure bar and other stuff play a crucial factor, but lets assume everything is set and prepared to give a heavy espresso.

Im leaning toward the conical burr concept due to more heavy espresso, but 1) is there anything i should know about before buying a one and not proceeding with a flat burr?

2)Is grinding directly into the portafilter considered a plus? Or is better considered to grind into an external cup then pouring the coffe geind into the portafilter?

3)is grinding by time / weight crucial thing or is it fancy stuff that may complicate stuff? 

I'd preffer also single dose over hopper because im gonna change between decaf and normal beans often.

Open for suggestions as the above preferces, thank you.

1nlak0z,https://www.reddit.com/r/ActuallyReviewed/comments/1nlak0z/reveal_if_wrights_silver_cleaner_really_works_on/,Reveal if Wrights Silver Cleaner Really Works on Tarnished Jewelry,"Wright's Silver Cleaner, model B07CRQWMLK, came into my life as a savior for my tarnished silver and dull jewelry, and it‚Äôs been quite an experience using this product. Over the past weeks, I‚Äôve put it through its paces daily on a range of metals like silver utensils, antique jewelry, and even a pewter coffee pot my grandmother gifted me. The results, while impressive, have also highlighted a few areas worth discussing. Let‚Äôs dive into what impressed me‚Äîand what left me scratching my head.

**Design and Ease of Use**  
The thoughtful design of this silver cleaner is really one of its standout features. It comes in an 8-ounce container that‚Äôs compact, making it easy to store under a cabinet or even on your cleaning shelf without taking up much space. The cream-like consistency is smooth and doesn‚Äôt drip or spill everywhere during use, sparing me from cleaning up an additional mess in the process. I couldn‚Äôt help but notice how easy it was to apply a small amount of product to a cloth or sponge, spread it on the target area, and wipe it off seamlessly for an instant shine. My 10-year-old niece even tried polishing a silver bracelet and found it hassle-free, so that should tell you how simple it is to use. It‚Äôs the kind of product that doesn‚Äôt require an advanced degree in home cleaning!  

**Performance and Results**  
One of the highlights of this cleaner is its ability to effectively remove tarnish from metals like silver, brass, copper, aluminum, and pewter. I tested it on a pretty tarnished silver tea set inherited from my aunt, and the transformation was nothing short of incredible. The tarnish didn‚Äôt just fade‚Äîit vanished completely, leaving behind a brilliant shine reminiscent of when these items were new. Even the stubborn spots on the edges of my old silver cutlery gave way with minimal effort. The cream also had an undeniable ability to restore the luster of every single item I used it on, bringing out that rich, polished glow that inexpensive cleaners often fail to achieve.  

[Check Wright's Silver Cleaner B07CRQWMLK price on Amazon.](https://info.senaar.com/p/b07crqwmlk/)

**Advantages**  
There‚Äôs much to appreciate about this metal polish:

- The ammonia-free formula is a huge perk for those who hate harsh chemical odors. My apartment doesn‚Äôt end up smelling like a science lab post-cleaning, which is a big win in my book.
- It‚Äôs versatile and suitable for multiple metals, so I didn‚Äôt have to clutter my storage area with separate cleaners for brass, silver, or copper.
- Gentle on delicate items. I tested it on an antique silver locket that had intricate carvings, and it cleaned beautifully without compromising the intricate details.  

**Shortcomings**  
There are, however, areas for improvement:

- For extremely tarnished items, it sometimes required multiple rounds of application to achieve the desired result. While this might not be a dealbreaker, it‚Äôs worth mentioning.
- The 8-ounce size, though convenient, feels slightly limiting for someone looking to polish larger items like candlesticks or trays regularly. I wish a larger container option were available to offer more product for frequent users like me.  

**Trusted Ingredients and Formula**  
The ammonia-free formula is a game changer that most users will appreciate. Unlike other polishes packed with pungent chemicals, this cleaner respects your nose and home environment. Knowing that it doesn‚Äôt rely on harmful ammonia definitely boosted my confidence in using it on jewelry pieces that come into contact with skin.  

**Competitive Options**  
Compared to competing products, Wright's Silver Cleaner strikes an excellent balance between efficacy and safety. Products like Weiman Silver Polish and Flitz generally perform well but tend to have stronger odors and may lack the same degree of refinement in terms of versatility. While Wright's formula doesn't offer the quickest one-step solution for severe tarnishing, its ability to provide a thorough yet gentle clean is where it shines. It may not have the brand recognition of Flitz, but in terms of safety and user-friendliness, it wins hands down.  

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
From my standpoint, Wright‚Äôs is a clear example of quality meeting affordability. It‚Äôs not the cheapest option in the market, but the value proposition it offers is undeniable. You‚Äôre getting top-notch performance, safe ingredients, and ease of use with one product. Considering how easily it removes tarnish without causing damage, I‚Äôd call it a smart investment for anyone wanting to maintain their silver and other metals. And let‚Äôs not forget its versatility; a multipurpose cleaner that works for multiple metals is always worth paying a few extra dimes for.

Somewhere that‚Äôs sort of casual, but good food and drink options. Families can hang out and let the kids run around. And yeah, I know a lot of people don‚Äôt want to hear screaming kids. Go somewhere else like a bar?

The new Olive Street Park sort of has this being next to Communal Coffee. Izola downtown off Faultline Park downtown almost does. Station Tavern in South Park is decent.

I‚Äôm looking for somewhere my kid can run around with other kids, maybe a playground but at least dig in the dirt, and then the parents can chill and drink beer or a glass of wine and eat some snacks while chatting and watching their kids play. Options I‚Äôm aware of are limited.

1nlahiw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Neurodivergent/comments/1nlahiw/feeling_alone_and_misunderstood/,Feeling alone and misunderstood üòû,"
Hi all ! 
I‚Äôm 37 (F) and in the past year , I have discovered I am AuDHD as well as HSP . All my life I‚Äôve been an empath - I was born as a colic-y baby and have been overstimulated , extremely sensitive and have felt a deeper connection or sense of purpose my entire life .        
       Being raised by boomer NT parents who I‚Äôm sure did their best , I am grateful I had a fairly easy childhood however because of being high masking my entire life , I feel like I‚Äôve just slipped under the cracks of society - barely scraping by in life - feeling like I never received the ‚Äúadulting pamphlet ‚Äú of this world we live in because of my sensitivities and dif brain . I am starting to believe that the Neurodivergence correlates or even stems from the HSP . Growing up with a Narcissistic parent taught me at a young age that in order to be safe in this world I had to ppl please and constantly be tuned into others emotions and monitoring the environment, etc which has really taken a toll on my health as well . 
     I‚Äôve gotten into a cycle of abusive relationships - the most severe being a 6 year engagement with a man who was very coercive and manipulative before I even understood what Narcissistic abuse was . I‚Äôve learned alot of hard lessons as a result of that relationship, however in the wake of the healing ( it‚Äôs been 5 years since the end of that relationship) I‚Äôve completely unraveled and a lot is coming to the surface now that my nervous system finally feels safe . 
        Physical symptoms have also manifested significantly impacting my quality of life . 
I was diagnosed with endometriosis a few years ago and plan on having a hysterectomy in the near future to hopefully get some relief . 
        I‚Äôm 37 , never been married , never will have kids , and almost have no social life because of my chronic illness . In the past year alone , my body started to reject things such as coffee and wine that used to be little vices I once enjoyed ( a nice glass of wine at dinner , etc ) I cant even enjoy a sip of wine without having an allergic reaction which is frustrating being that I work in the wine industry .  So I turned to weed which helps relieve my symptoms significantly however that started giving me cyclic vomiting episodes ( which could be CHS but docs don‚Äôt have a clear answer ) so I also had to completely give that up too. 

Speaking of my job - I currently am in the process of losing my job because I can‚Äôt keep up with my coworkers and maintain the hours I need to pay the bills . Fortunately, my boyfriend is helping with the rent which takes a burden off however I also can‚Äôt help but feel like a burden to him . 
In the year we‚Äôve been together - about 25% of that time he‚Äôs watched me bed ridden in pain , taken me to the ER twice , feeling helpless . I try to stay positive . I spend my days off cleaning , cooking healthy meals , do daily yoga and meditation - but lately everything feels like it‚Äôs becoming too much . 

When I was 25 I tried to end my life . I hit an all time low and this was before I understood my brain was different. Since - I‚Äôve done countless reading , self help , etc I‚Äôve come a long way and am proud of myself in that sense . 
     On the outside I look healthy - I take care of my appearance and upon a glance ppl think I‚Äôve got it all together . I even get some hate and hostility from other females mostly because I‚Äôm attractive as well and ppl assume that attractive = healthy and problem free. 
     My entire life I‚Äôve had small friend groups and ironically the only friends who‚Äôve stuck with me and who I truly value are also HSP or Neurodivergent. I feel seen and understood on a much deeper level by them . I don‚Äôt feel seen by my parents , my colleagues, even my own boyfriend . 
The silent suffering and feeling of invisibility and constantly being misunderstood is hard to express to them . I‚Äôm close to my mom and when I try to express these things she will just try and give me practical advice like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt let it get to you ‚Äú or ‚Äú be grateful for what you have ‚Äú 
Because of being HSP , on the spectrum , and living with a chronic illness - my finances have also been hit hard . I am drowning in medical bills , have spent way too much seeking alternative medicine , supplements , acupuncture/ pain management , etc all while trying to work full time and get through life in this crazy world and crumbling economy . 
    I often feel I was born into the wrong time . I hate technology , capitalist society , the ego centric , 3D world we live in . It‚Äôs all so much . 
I guess I‚Äôm just needing to vent and support 
I feel so alone . üòû 
At times I wish I could just throw in the towel but there is something deep inside me telling me that all this suffering is for a higher purpose. ",1,1758304310.0,Neurodivergent,0,1.0,False
1nlahbh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1nlahbh/aitah_for_saying_likewise/,"AITAH for saying ""likewise""?","I wish this was a clickbait title, but that is actually all that happened.  
I realize it's a tiny matter, but it somehow caught me off guard.  
I (32m) met an old friend (27f) for coffee today to catch up.   
We had a fun time, bunch of laughs, I was glad we reconnected (just friends btw, I'm gay af).  
When we said our goodbyes she said ""Have a nice weekend!"" and I said ""Likewise!"" (best translation, since this did not happen in English, but it's actually quite close).

I was already on my bike, putting on my headphones, when I heard her say ""OH my GOD, seriously?"".

I was confused, asked her what was up and she told me the way I talked seemed stand-offish.  
She said she thought we were having a good time.  
I said so did I and asked what I had said that was so off-putting. She said ""Likewise"" and told me I should have said ""You too!"" instead.  
I told her I did not mean anything by it and that I simply always say ""Likewise"". Without thinking, even.  
She said it was a bad habit. I explained and told her that I seriously enjoyed the day with her and that I did not mean to make her feel bad about any of it, then apologized. I'm not sure on my wording, but I'm sure I did not say anything close to the word ""likewise"", but while I told her I'd keep it in mind and try to not use that word again, she turned around, mumbled ""oh my fucking god, you're still doing it!"" and walked off.

I stood there for a good 20 seconds before driving off. I have been blocked since.  
I told a buddy who also knows her and he told me that I do, in fact, sound like a bloody snob like 20% of the time and like a ghetto kid the other 80.   
I am just confused at this point.   
Do I need to change the way I talk?

Jake Rigsby, with his red hair and leather jacket, sits across from Mia Valentine, who has short brown hair and a gentle smile. Steam rises from their coffee cups, and the chatter of other patrons fills the background.

Mia Valentine (Smiling, holding her coffee cup): ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice to be back here, Jake. This cafe reminds me of our first date. Remember how nervous you were?‚Äù

Jake Rigsby (Chuckling, with a hint of nostalgia): ‚ÄúYeah, I was a mess. Thought I‚Äôd spill coffee all over you or something. But you stuck around, so I guess I didn‚Äôt screw it up too bad.‚Äù

Mia Valentine (Laughing softly, reaching for his hand): ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt screw it up at all. I saw something in you, even then. The way you talked about music, about your dreams‚Äîit was captivating. But tell me, how are you holding up with‚Ä¶ you know, everything?‚Äù

Mia Valentine (Nodding, understandingly): ‚ÄúI get that. You‚Äôre not one for labels. But I‚Äôm here, Jake. Whatever you need, whenever you need it. Even if it‚Äôs just to sit in a cafe and drink coffee.‚Äù

Mia Valentine (Blushing slightly, with a warm smile): ‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre mine, Jake. Even with all the chaos, you make it worth it. But let‚Äôs talk about something lighter. ZombieLand Fest is coming up. Are you ready to ‚Äògo stupid, go crazy‚Äô again?‚Äù

I‚Äôm looking to start a small book club here in Port Angeles: something small, just 4‚Äì6 people to keep conversations engaging and manageable.

**Meeting style:**  
I‚Äôm flexible on format. We could either:

* Meet every two weeks, splitting the book in half (first meeting = first half, second meeting = second half).
* Or meet once a month to discuss the book as a whole.

We can sort this out together once the group forms.

**What to expect:**

* I‚Äôll lead the discussions, but the goal is to keep things open, fun, and thoughtful.
* Meetings would be cozy, low-key‚Äîthink chatting over coffee, tea, snacks, food, etc., diving into themes, characters, and ideas.
* To keep things engaging, we could rotate who brings a discussion question, share favorite passages, or even make little connections to real-world issues.

**Focus:**  
I‚Äôd like to begin with Sci-Fi and Speculative Fiction, though I‚Äôm also open to branching into modern fantasy and non-fiction down the road.

Here are some books I‚Äôm considering to start:

* *The Dispossessed* by Ursula K. LeGuin
* *Ball Lightning* by Cixin Liu

Wish I had ventured out of the commonly touted guidance sooner.

I never thought that I would ever experience a genuine haunting of any sort, but here we are. If this post isn't allowed i'm sorry, but I feel like you guys would give good advice.

My partner is a war-veteran, and (despite his denial that the entity is *his*) the entity is attached to him in some way. It all started when I moved in with him and began seeing weird shadows at night. All person-shaped, and they'd appear standing over me as I was waking up, or when I went to get water in the middle of the night. I ignored it because I thought that it was my imagination. This sort of thing had never happened to me, before.

Then the dishes started falling/moving around day and night, hearing disembodied footsteps in the kitchen became a regular occurance, and the heavy antique doors would open by themselves. Before we moved, the closet light switch FLIPPED ITSELF ON when we were drinking coffee one morning. Dude. Lmao, we get it. The building was nearly 200 years old, so I thought (and hoped) that it was a residual ghost. We didn't give it attention in the hope that it would leave. 

We moved last month, and I was ‚ú®Ô∏èwrong‚ú®Ô∏è. So far, we've both seen a figure in the living room/kitchen multiple times, paintings have fallen off the walls at random times, and my door beads were ripped off the wall last night. This entire thing sounds ridiculous. I put them back up and tested a theory - yes, they can hold my entire body weight. There is NO way that they could have fallen down on their own.

I've been dealing with some frustrating issues with my electric kettle lately, and I figured I'd share my experience and solutions since I know many of you probably use one daily for your coffee or tea routines.

So last month, my trusty electric kettle started acting up. You know the drill - I'd fill it up, press the button, and... nothing. Sometimes it would heat up super slowly, and other times it wouldn't heat at all. After some research and tinkering, I discovered several common reasons why electric kettles might not heat properly.

First things first - check if your kettle is properly plugged in and the outlet is working. I know it sounds obvious, but you'd be surprised how often this is the actual problem! Also, make sure the kettle is correctly seated on its base.

One major issue I discovered was limescale buildup. If you live in an area with hard water like I do, mineral deposits can accumulate inside your kettle, making it less efficient. The heating element gets covered with this chalky stuff, and boom - heating problems.

Here's how I fixed mine:
- Mixed equal parts white vinegar and water
- Boiled the mixture in the kettle
- Let it sit for 20 minutes
- Rinsed thoroughly
- Boiled plain water 2-3 times to remove any vinegar taste

If descaling doesn't work, it might be time for a replacement. After dealing with these issues, I actually found an amazing electric kettle that's been working perfectly (you can check it out here: https://athometouch.com/electric-kettle). It has some great features to prevent limescale buildup and maintains consistent heating.

Another common problem is a faulty heating element or thermostat. If your kettle's still under warranty, contact the manufacturer. If not, and you're still having issues after trying these solutions, you might want to consider a new one.

Some prevention tips I've learned:
- Use filtered water when possible
- Don't leave water sitting in the kettle
- Clean regularly
- Don't overfill
- Make sure to empty completely after each use

For those looking to upgrade to a more reliable option, I highly recommend checking out this model: https://athometouch.com/electric-kettle. It's been a game-changer for my morning routine, and the build quality is seriously impressive.

---------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to creating a comfortable, stylish home, innovative 2 bedroom barndominium floor plans offer a unique and modern solution for living. Combining the charm of a barn with contemporary design, barndominiums are becoming increasingly popular thanks to their versatility and efficient use of space. Let‚Äôs explore some exciting designs that you might consider for your future home.

One of the standout features of a barndominium is its open layout. This design principle allows for a seamless flow between the kitchen, dining, and living areas. You‚Äôll often find floor plans that include:

- **Spacious Kitchens:** Generously sized kitchens often feature large islands, which serve as hubs for cooking and socializing.
- **Dining Areas:** Adjacent to the kitchen, dining areas allow for easy access while entertaining family and friends.
- **Living Rooms:** In many designs, comfortable living spaces provide a cozy atmosphere for relaxation.

For homeowners who appreciate natural light, consider a floor plan that includes expansive windows or even skylights. This can help brighten your living space and bring the beauty of the outdoors inside. Large windows can frame picturesque views, making every season a delight to enjoy from the comfort of your home.

Storage is often a concern in any home, but with barndominiums, this can be cleverly managed. Innovative designs typically feature built-in storage solutions. Look for plans that incorporate:

- **Pantries:** Ideal for housing food and kitchen essentials.
- **Closets:** Walk-in closets in the bedrooms can maximize storage while maintaining an organized appearance.
- **Utility Rooms:** Dedicated spaces for laundry and maintenance equipment keep your home tidy.

In terms of personal space, many 2 bedroom barndominium designs highlight the bedrooms‚Äô functionality. They often focus on comfort and privacy by creating distinct areas that can be separated from the common living spaces. Bedrooms may feature:

- **En Suite Bathrooms:** Private bathrooms can provide a luxurious touch while ensuring privacy.
- **Separate Entrances:** Some designs even incorporate entrances that lead to private spaces, perfect for guests or end-of-day retreats.

Another key aspect of these designs is outdoor living. Many plans integrate outdoor areas, such as covered porches or decks. This outdoor space can serve multiple purposes:

- **Entertainment Areas:** Perfect for hosting barbecues or family gatherings.
- **Relaxation Zones:** An ideal retreat for enjoying warm evenings under the stars or peaceful mornings with a cup of coffee.

Combining sustainable living with modern comforts is another trend in barndominium designs. Many floor plans incorporate eco-friendly features such as:

- **Solar Panels:** Reducing energy costs and your carbon footprint.
- **Energy-Efficient Appliances:** Utilizing high-efficiency systems can make your home sustainable while keeping utility bills low.

As you consider our innovative 2 bedroom barndominium floor plans for modern living, keep your specific needs in mind. Each design can be tailored, from family dynamics to personal style. Your barndominium can reflect your lifestyle while remaining functional and stylish. Whether you prefer a minimalist aesthetic with clean lines or a rustic charm with warm wood finishes, the possibilities are endless.

The key to finding the perfect plan is thorough research and imagination. Begin by thinking about how you envision your daily life. Do you need a place that is easy to maintain while providing space for hobbies? Or perhaps you want a layout that welcomes friends and family? Understanding your needs will guide you toward the best barndominium design.

As you explore these innovative designs, you‚Äôll find inspiration in the variety of options available. Choose a plan that resonates with your vision for modern living, and soon enough, you‚Äôll see how a 2 bedroom barndominium can become your dream home‚Äîboth functional and beautiful.

Key Design Elements to Consider in Your Barndominium Layout
-----------------------------------------------------------

When planning your barndominium layout, there are several key design elements to consider that will help create a functional and aesthetically pleasing space. Imagine living in a home that combines the rustic charm of a barn with modern amenities. Keeping these design elements in mind can take your barndominium from ordinary to extraordinary.

### Space Optimization

Efficient use of space is crucial in any home design, especially in a barndominium. The open floor plan is a popular choice, as it promotes a sense of spaciousness and allows for flexible furniture arrangements. Consider these tips:

- Utilize vertical space with tall shelves and cabinets.
- Incorporate multi-functional furniture, like a sofa bed or a dining table with storage.
- Plan for open areas where natural light can flow in, creating an inviting atmosphere.

### Floor Plan Flow

How the rooms connect can impact your daily life. A well-thought-out floor plan can create a natural flow between living, cooking, and sleeping areas. Here are a few elements to ponder:

- **Kitchen Placement:** Place the kitchen near the dining area for easy serving and clean-up.
- **Bathroom Accessibility:** Make sure bathrooms are conveniently located near bedrooms and common areas.
- **Entry Points:** Consider how guests will enter your home and where coat racks or shoe storage should go.

### Natural Light

Natural light can significantly enhance the mood of your barndominium. Large windows, skylights, and open spaces can maximize sunlight. Here‚Äôs how to integrate this element effectively:

- Position windows to capture morning and evening light.
- Opt for glass doors leading to outdoor spaces to blur indoor and outdoor living.
- Select lighter-colored walls and ceilings to reflect more light.

### Outdoor Connection

A barndominium should feel connected to its surroundings. Consider outdoor spaces as an extension of your living area. Features to think about include:

- **Porches:** A covered porch can serve as a pleasant gathering space.
- **Decks:** Building a deck can provide an excellent spot for barbecues and relaxation.
- **Landscaping:** Think about how gardens or pathways can enhance your property's charm.

### Material Choices

Your choice of materials can influence both the appearance and performance of your barndominium. Popular options include:

- **Metal:** Often used for the exterior, metal provides durability and a modern look.
- **Wood:** Wood accents can warm up interiors and add rustic appeal.
- **Concrete:** For flooring and foundations, concrete offers strength and low maintenance.

### Energy Efficiency

Energy-efficient elements can save you money and minimize your environmental impact. Consider:

- **Insulation:** Proper insulation will keep your barndominium comfortable year-round.
- **Windows:** Energy-efficient windows can reduce heating and cooling costs.
- **Solar Panels:** If your budget allows, solar energy can provide renewable energy for your home.

### Personal Style

Your barndominium should reflect your personality and style. Think about how you can add personal touches throughout:

- Choose colors that resonate with you.
- Incorporate your favorite art pieces or family photos.
- Use textiles and decor that showcase your interests and hobbies.

By carefully considering these design elements, you can create a barndominium that feels just right for you. Pay attention to space optimization, layout flow, natural light, outdoor connection, materials, energy efficiency, and your personal style. The result will be a beautiful blend of rustic charm and modern living, making your barndominium a true reflection of you and your lifestyle.

¬† I slide my hands into the back pockets of my jeans and hope to hell I can keep them there. I‚Äôm standing behind the couch, looking down at him. I don‚Äôt know how long it‚Äôll take him to notice I‚Äôm here. Considering the grip he has on the chick straddling his lap, I doubt he‚Äôll notice for a while. I remain behind them for several minutes while the party continues around us, everyone completely unaware that I‚Äôm a fraction away from losing my mind. I would take out my phone so that I‚Äôd have evidence, but I couldn‚Äôt do that to Les. She doesn‚Äôt need a visual.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHey,‚Äù I finally say, unable to contain my silence a second longer. If I have to watch him palm this chick‚Äôs breast one more time without a single ounce of respect for his relationship with Les, I‚Äôll rip his fucking hand off.  
  
¬† Grayson tears his mouth away from hers and tilts his head back, looking up at me with glossed-over eyes. I can see the fear settle in when it clicks‚Äîwhen he finally realizes that the last person he thought would be here tonight actually showed up.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHolder,‚Äù he says, pushing the girl off his lap. He struggles to his feet but can hardly stand up straight. He looks at me pleadingly, pointing at the girl, who‚Äôs now adjusting her barely-there skirt. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt . . . it‚Äôs not what it looks like.‚Äù  
  
¬† I slide my hands out of my back pockets and fold my arms across my chest. My fist is closer to him now and I have to clench it, knowing how good it would feel to punch his face in.  
  
¬† I look down to the floor and inhale a breath. Then another. And one more just for show, since I‚Äôm really enjoying watching him squirm. I shake my head and raise my eyes back to his. ‚ÄúGive me your phone.‚Äù  
  
¬† The confusion on his face would be comical if I weren‚Äôt so pissed. He laughs and attempts to back up a step, but bumps into the coffee table. He catches himself by pressing his hand onto the glass and straightens back up. ‚ÄúGet your own fucking phone,‚Äù he mumbles. He doesn‚Äôt look back at me as he maneuvers his way around the coffee table. I calmly walk around the couch and intercept him, holding out my hand.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGive me your phone, Grayson. Now.‚Äù  
  
¬† I‚Äôm not really at an advantage sizewise, since we‚Äôre about the same build. However, I‚Äôm definitely at an advantage if you take my anger into consideration, and Grayson can clearly see that. He takes a step back, which probably isn‚Äôt a very smart move considering he‚Äôs backing himself straight into the corner of the living room. He fumbles with his pocket and finally pulls out his phone.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat the hell do you want my phone for?‚Äù he says. I grab it out of his hands and dial Les‚Äôs number without hitting send. I hand it back to him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCall her. Tell her what a bastard you are and end it.‚Äù  
  
¬† Grayson looks down at his phone, then back up at me. ‚ÄúGo fuck yourself,‚Äù he spits.  
  
¬† I inhale a calming breath, then roll my neck and pop my jaw. When that doesn‚Äôt help ease my urge to make him bleed, I reach forward, grab the collar of his shirt and shove him hard against the wall, pinning his neck with my forearm. I remind myself that if I kick his ass before he makes the call, my remaining calm for the past ten minutes will have been pointless.  
  
¬† My teeth are clenched, my jaw is tight, and my pulse is pounding in my head. I‚Äôve never hated anyone more than in this moment. The intensity of what I wish I could do to him right now is even scaring me.  
  
¬† I look him hard in the eyes and let him know how the next few minutes are about to play out. ‚ÄúGrayson,‚Äù I say through clenched teeth. ‚ÄúUnless you want me to do what I really want to do to you right now, you will put the phone to your ear, you will call my sister, and you will end it. Then you‚Äôre going to hang up the phone and never speak to her again.‚Äù I press my arm harder against his neck, taking note of the fact that his face is now redder than his shirt, due to lack of oxygen.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúFine,‚Äù he grumbles, attempting to free himself from the hold I have on him. I wait until he looks down at the phone and hits send before I release my arm and let go of his shirt. He puts the phone to his ear and never stops looking at me as we both stand still and wait for Les to answer.  
  
¬† I know what this will do to her, but she has no idea what he does behind her back. No matter how many times she hears it from other people, he‚Äôs somehow able to weasel his way back into her life every time.  
  
¬† Not this time. Not if I have any control over it. I won‚Äôt sit back and let him do this to my sister anymore.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHey,‚Äù he says into the phone. He tries to turn away from me to speak to her, but I shove his shoulder back against the wall. He winces.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo, babe,‚Äù he says nervously. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm at Jaxon‚Äôs house.‚Äù There‚Äôs a long pause while he listens to her speak. ‚ÄúI know that‚Äôs what I said, but I lied. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm calling. Les, I . . . I think we need some space.‚Äù  
  
¬† I shake my head, letting him know that he needs to make it an absolute break-up. I‚Äôm not looking for him to give her space. I‚Äôm looking for him to give my sister permanent freedom.  
  
¬† He rolls his eyes and flips me off with his free hand. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm breaking up with you,‚Äù he says flatly. He allows her to talk while he remains silent. The fact that he‚Äôs showing no remorse whatsoever proves what a heartless dick he is. My hands are shaking and my chest tightens, knowing exactly what this is doing to Les right now. I hate myself for forcing this to happen, but Les deserves better, even if she doesn‚Äôt think she does.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hanging up now,‚Äù he says into the phone.  
  
¬† I shove his head back against the wall and force him to look at me. ‚ÄúApologize to her,‚Äù I say quietly, not wanting her to hear me in the background. He closes his eyes and sighs, then ducks his head.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Lesslie. I didn‚Äôt want to do this.‚Äù He pulls the phone from his ear and abruptly ends the call. He stares at the screen for several seconds. ‚ÄúI hope you‚Äôre happy,‚Äù he says, looking back up at me. ‚ÄúBecause you just broke your sister‚Äôs heart.‚Äù  
  
¬† That‚Äôs the last thing Grayson says to me. My fist meets his jaw twice before he hits the floor. I shake out my hand, back away from him, and make my way to the exit. Before I even reach my car, my phone is buzzing in my back pocket. I pull it out and don‚Äôt even look at the screen before answering it.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHey,‚Äù I say, attempting to control the trembling anger in my voice when I hear her crying on the other end. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on my way, Les. It‚Äôll be okay, I‚Äôm on my way.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢  
  
¬† It‚Äôs been an entire day since Grayson made the call, but I still feel guilty, so I tack on an extra two miles to my evening run for self-¬≠inflicted punishment. Seeing Les torn up like she was last night wasn‚Äôt something I had expected. I realize now that having him call her like I did probably wasn‚Äôt the best way of handling things, but there‚Äôs no way I could just sit back and allow him to dick around on her like he was.  
  
¬† The most unexpected thing about Les‚Äôs reaction was that her anger wasn‚Äôt solely placed on Grayson. It was as if she was pissed at the entire male population. She kept referring to men as ‚Äúsick bastards,‚Äù pacing her bedroom floor back and forth, while I just sat there and watched her vent. She finally broke down, crawled into bed, and cried herself to sleep. I lay awake, knowing I had a hand in her heartache. I stayed in her room the whole night, partly to make sure she was okay, but mostly because I didn‚Äôt want her picking up the phone and calling Grayson in a moment of desperation.  
  
¬† She‚Äôs stronger than I give her credit for, tho  
ugh. She didn‚Äôt attempt to call him last night and she‚Äôs made no attempt to call him today. She didn‚Äôt get much sleep last night, so she went to her room before lunch to nap. However, I‚Äôve been pausing outside her bedroom door throughout the day just to make sure I couldn‚Äôt hear her on the phone, so I know she hasn‚Äôt made any attempts to call him. At least while I‚Äôve been home. In fact, I‚Äôm pretty sure the heartless phone call from him last night was exactly what she needed to finally see him for who he really is.  
  
¬† I kick my shoes off at the door and walk to the kitchen to refill my water. It‚Äôs Saturday night and I would normally be heading out with Daniel, but I already texted him to let him know I was staying in tonight. Les made me promise I would stay in with her because she didn‚Äôt want to go out and chance running into Grayson yet. She‚Äôs lucky she‚Äôs cool, because I don‚Äôt know many seventeen-year-old guys who would give up a Saturday night to watch chick flicks with his heartbroken sister. But then again, most siblings don‚Äôt have what Les and I have. I don‚Äôt know if our close relationship has anything to do with the fact that we‚Äôre twins. She‚Äôs my only sibling, so I don‚Äôt have anything to compare us to. She might argue that I‚Äôm too protective of her, and there may be some truth to that argument, but I don‚Äôt plan on changing anytime soon. Or ever.  
  
¬† I run up the stairs, pull my shirt off, and push open the bathroom door. I turn the water on, then walk across the hall and knock on her bedroom door. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm taking a quick shower, will you order the pizza?‚Äù  
  
¬† I brace my hand against her door and reach down to pull my socks off. I turn around and toss them into the bathroom, then beat on her door again. ‚ÄúLes!‚Äù  
  
¬† When she doesn‚Äôt respond, I sigh and look up at the ceiling. If she‚Äôs on the phone with him, I‚Äôll be pissed. But if she‚Äôs on the phone with him, it probably means he‚Äôs telling her the break-up was all my fault and she‚Äôll be the one who‚Äôs pissed. I wipe my palms on my shorts and open the door to her bedroom, preparing for another heated lecture on how I need to mind my own business.  
  
¬† ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢  
  
¬† I see Les on her bed after I walk into her room, and I‚Äôm immediately taken back to when I was a little boy. Back to the moment that changed me. Everything about me. Everything about the world around me. My whole world turned from a place full of vibrant colors to a dull, lifeless gray. The sky, the grass, the trees . . . all the things that were once beautiful were stripped of their magnificence the moment I realized I was responsible for our best friend Hope‚Äôs disappearance.  
  
¬† I never looked at people the same way. I never looked at nature the same way. I never looked at my future the same way. Everything went from having a meaning, a purpose, and a reason, to simply being a second-rate version of what life was supposed to be like. My once effervescent world was suddenly a blurred, gray, colorless photocopy.  
  
¬† Just like Les‚Äôs eyes.  
  
¬† They aren‚Äôt hers. They‚Äôre open. They‚Äôre looking right at me from her position on the bed.  
  
¬† But they aren‚Äôt hers.  
  
¬† The color in her eyes is gone. This girl is a gray, colorless photocopy of my sister.  
  
¬† My Les.  
  
¬† I can‚Äôt move. I wait for her to blink, to laugh, to revel in the twisted aftermath of the sick, fucking joke she‚Äôs playing right now. I wait for my heart to start beating again, for my lungs to start working again. I wait for control of my body to return to me because I don‚Äôt know who has control of it right now. I sure as hell don‚Äôt. I wait and I wait and I wonder how long she can keep this up. How long can people keep their eyes open like that? How long can people not breathe before their body jerks for that desperately needed gasp of air?  
  
¬† How fucking long before I do something to help her?  
  
¬† My hands are touching her face, grabbing her arm, shaking her whole body until she‚Äôs in my arms and I‚Äôm pulling her onto my lap. The empty pill bottle falls out of her hand and lands on the floor but I refuse to look at it. Her eyes are still lifeless and she‚Äôs no longer looking at me as the head between my hands falls backward every time I try to lift it up.  
  
¬† She doesn‚Äôt flinch when I scream her name, and she doesn‚Äôt wince when I slap her, and she doesn‚Äôt react when I start to cry.  
  
¬† She doesn‚Äôt do a goddamned thing.  
  
¬† She doesn‚Äôt even tell me it‚Äôll be okay when every single ounce of whatever was left inside my chest is propelled out of me the moment I realize that the very best part of me is dead.  
  
¬† Chapter Two  
  
¬† \* \* \*  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWill you look for her pink top and the black pleated pants?‚Äù my mother asks. She keeps her eyes trained on the paperwork laid out in front of her. The man from the funeral home reaches across the table and points to a spot on the form.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúJust a few more pages, Beth,‚Äù he says. My mother mechanically signs the forms without question. She‚Äôs trying to keep it together until they leave, but I know as soon as they walk out the front door she‚Äôll break down again. It‚Äôs only been forty-eight hours, but I can tell just by looking at her that she‚Äôs about to experience it all over again.  
  
¬† You would think a person could only die once. You would think you would only find your sister‚Äôs lifeless body once. You would think you would only have to watch your mother‚Äôs reaction once after finding out her only daughter is dead.  
  
¬† Once is so far from accurate.  
  
¬† It happens repeatedly.  
  
¬† Every single time I close my eyes I see Les‚Äôs eyes. Every time my mother looks at me, she‚Äôs watching me tell her that her daughter is dead for the second time. For the third time. For the thousandth time. Every time I take a breath or blink or speak, I experience her death all over again. I don‚Äôt sit here and wonder if the fact that she‚Äôs dead will ever sink in. I sit here and wonder when I‚Äôll stop having to watch her die.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHolder, they need an outfit for her,‚Äù my mother repeats again after noticing I haven‚Äôt moved. ‚ÄúGo to her room and get the pink shirt with the long sleeves. It‚Äôs her favorite one, she‚Äôd want to wear it.‚Äù  
  
¬† She knows I don‚Äôt want to go into Les‚Äôs bedroom any more than she does. I push my chair away from the table and head upstairs. ‚ÄúLes is dead,‚Äù I mutter to myself. ‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt give a shit what she‚Äôs wearing.‚Äù  
  
¬† I pause outside her door, knowing I‚Äôll have to watch her die all over again the moment I open it. I haven‚Äôt been in here since I found her and I really had no intention of ever coming back in here.  
  
¬† I walk inside and shut the door behind me, then make my way to her closet. I do my best not to think about it.  
  
¬† Pink shirt.  
  
¬† Don‚Äôt think about her.  
  
¬† Long sleeves.  
  
¬† Don‚Äôt think about how you would do anything to go back to Saturday night.  
  
¬† Pleated black pants.  
  
¬† Don‚Äôt think about how much you fucking hate yourself right now for letting her down.  
  
¬† But I do. I think about it and I become hurt and angry all over again. I grab a fistful of shirts hanging in the closet and rip them as hard as I can off their hangers until they fall to the closet floor. I grip the frame on top of the door and squeeze my eyes shut, listening to the sound of the now empty hangers swinging back and forth. I try to focus on the fact that I‚Äôm in here to grab two things and leave, but I can‚Äôt move. I can‚Äôt stop replaying the moment that I walked into this bedroom and found her.  
  
¬† I fall to my knees on the floor, look over at her bed, and watch her die one more time.  
  
¬† I sit back against the closet door and close my eyes, remaining in this position for however long it takes me to realize that I don‚Äôt want to be in here. I turn around and rummage through the shirts that are now on the closet floor until I find the long-sleeved pink one. I look up at the pants hanging from their hangers and I grab a pair of black pleated ones. I toss them to the side and begin to push up from the floor, but immediately sit back down when I see a thick, leather-bound notebook on the bottom shelf of her closet.  
  
¬† I grab it and pull it onto my lap, then lean back against the wall and stare at the cover. I‚Äôve seen this notebook before. It was a gift to her from Dad about three years ago, but  
Les told me she‚Äôd never use it because she knew the notebook was just a request made by her therapist. Les hated therapy, and I was never sure why Mom encouraged her to go. We both went for a while after Mom and Dad split up, but I stopped attending the sessions once they started interfering with junior high football practice. Mom didn‚Äôt seem to mind that I didn‚Äôt go, but Les continued with the weekly sessions up until two days ago . . . when her actions made it clear the therapy wasn‚Äôt exactly helping.  
  
¬† I flip the notebook open to the first page and it doesn‚Äôt surprise me that it‚Äôs blank. I wonder, if she had used the notebook like the therapist suggested, would it have made a difference?  
  
¬† I doubt it. I don‚Äôt know what could have saved Les from herself. Certainly not a pen and paper.  
  
¬† I pull the pen out of the spiral binding, then press the tip of the pen to the paper and begin to write her a letter. I don‚Äôt even know why I‚Äôm writing her. I don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôs in a place where she can see me right now, or if she‚Äôs even in a place at all, but in case she can see this . . . I want her to know how her selfish decision affected me. How hopeless she left me. Literally hopeless. And completely alone. And so, so incredibly sorry.  
  
¬† Chapter Two-and-a-half  
  
¬† \* \* \*  
  
¬† Les,  
  
¬† You left your jeans in the middle of your bedroom floor. It looks like you just stepped out of them. It‚Äôs weird. Why would you leave your jeans on the floor if you knew what you were about to do? Wouldn‚Äôt you at least throw them in the hamper? Did you not think about what would happen after I found you and how someone would eventually have to pick your jeans up and do something with them? Well, I‚Äôm not picking them up. And I‚Äôm not hanging all your shirts back up, either.  
  
¬† Anyway. I‚Äôm in your closet. On the floor. I just don‚Äôt really know what I want to say to you right now, or what I want to ask you. Of course the only question on everyone else‚Äôs mind right now is ‚ÄúWhy did she do it?‚Äù But I‚Äôm not going to ask you why you did it for two reasons.  
1) You can‚Äôt answer me. You‚Äôre dead.  
  
¬† 2) I don‚Äôt know if I really care why you did it. There isn‚Äôt anything about your life that would give you a good enough reason to do what you did. And you probably already know that if you can see Mom right now. She‚Äôs completely devastated.  
  
¬† You know, I never really knew what it meant to actually be devastated. I thought we were devastated after we lost Hope. What happened to her was definitely tragic for us, but the way we felt was nothing compared to how you‚Äôve made Mom feel. She‚Äôs so incredibly devastated; she gives the word a whole new meaning. I wish the use of the word could be restricted to situations like this. It‚Äôs absurd that people are allowed to use it to describe anything other than how a mother feels when she loses her child. Because that‚Äôs the only situation in this entire world worthy of the term.  
  
¬† Dammit, I miss you so much. I‚Äôm so sorry I let you down. I‚Äôm sorry I wasn‚Äôt able to see what was really going on behind your eyes every time you told me you were fine.  
  
¬† So, yeah. Why, Les? Why did you do it?  
  
¬† H  
  
¬† Chapter Two-and-three-quarters  
  
¬† \* \* \*  
  
¬† Les,  
  
¬† Well, congratulations. You‚Äôre pretty popular. Not only did you fill the parking lot of the funeral home with cars, but you also filled the lot next door and both churches down the street. That‚Äôs a lot of cars.  
  
¬† I held it together, though; mostly for Mom‚Äôs sake. Dad looked almost as bad as Mom. The whole funeral was really weird. It made me wonder, had you died in a car wreck or from something more mainstream, would people‚Äôs reactions have been different? If you hadn‚Äôt purposely overdosed (that‚Äôs the term Mom prefers), then I think people might have been a little less weird. It was like they were scared of us, or maybe they thought purposely overdosing was contagious. They discussed it like we weren‚Äôt even in the same room. So many stares and whispers and pitiful smiles. I just wanted to grab Mom and pull her out of there and protect her from the fact that I knew she was reliving your death with every hug and every tear and every smile.  
  
¬† Of course I couldn‚Äôt help but think everyone was acting like they were because they blamed us in a way. I could tell what they were thinking.  
  
¬† How could a family not know this would happen?  
  
¬† How could they not see the signs?  
  
¬† What kind of mother is she?  
  
¬† What kind of brother doesn‚Äôt notice how depressed his own twin sister is?  
  
¬† Luckily, once your funeral began, everyone‚Äôs focus was momentarily taken off us and placed on the slideshow. There were a lot of pictures of you and me. You were happy in all of them. There were a lot of pictures of you and your friends, and you were happy in all of those, too. Pictures of you with Mom and Dad before the divorce; pictures of you with Mom and Brian after she remarried; pictures of you with Dad and Pamela after he remarried.  
  
¬† But it wasn‚Äôt until the very last picture came up on the screen that it hit me. It was the picture of you and me in front of our old house. The one that was taken about six months after Hope went missing? You still had the bracelet on that matched the one you gave her the day she was taken. I noticed you stopped wearing it a couple of years ago, but I‚Äôve never asked about it. I know you don‚Äôt really like to talk about her.  
  
¬† Anyway, back to the picture. I had my arm around your neck and we were both laughing and smiling at the camera. It‚Äôs the same smile you flashed in all the other pictures. It got me to thinking about how every picture I‚Äôve ever seen of you; you have that same exact, identical smile. There isn‚Äôt a single picture of you with a frown on your face. Or a scowl. Or a blank expression. It‚Äôs like you spent your whole life trying to keep up this false appearance. For whom, I don‚Äôt know. Maybe you were scared that a camera would permanently capture an honest feeling of yours. Because let‚Äôs face it, you weren‚Äôt happy all the time. All those nights you cried yourself to sleep? All those nights you needed me to hold you while you cried, but you refused to tell me what was wrong? No one with a genuine smile would cry to themselves like that. And I realize you had issues, Les. I knew our life and the things that happened to us affected you differently than they did me. But how was I supposed to know that they were as serious as they were if you never let it show? If you never told me?  
  
¬† Maybe . . . and I hate to think this. But maybe I didn‚Äôt know you. I thought I did, but I didn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt think I knew you at all. I knew the girl who cried at night. I knew the girl who smiled in the pictures. But I didn‚Äôt know the girl that linked that smile with those tears. I have no idea why you flashed fake smiles, but cried real tears. When a guy loves a girl, especially his sister, he‚Äôs supposed to know what makes her smile and what makes her cry.  
  
¬† But I didn‚Äôt. And I don‚Äôt. So I‚Äôm sorry, Les. I‚Äôm so sorry I let you go on pretending that you were okay when obviously you were so far from it.  
  
¬† H  
  
¬† Chapter Three  
  
¬† \* \* \*  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBeth, why don‚Äôt you go to bed?‚Äù Brian says to my mother. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre exhausted. Go get some sleep.‚Äù  
  
¬† My mother shakes her head and continues stirring, despite the pleas from my stepdad for her to take a break. We‚Äôve got enough food in the refrigerator to feed an army, yet she insists on cooking for everyone just so we don‚Äôt have to eat the sympathy food, as she refers to it. I‚Äôm so sick of fried chicken. It seems to be the go-to meal for anyone dropping food off at the house. I‚Äôve had fried chicken for every meal since the morning after Les died, and that was four days ago.  
  
¬† I walk to the stove and take the spoon out of her hands, then rub her shoulder with my free hand while I stir. She leans against me and sighs. It‚Äôs not a good sigh, either. It‚Äôs a sigh that all but says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm done.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPlease, go sit on the couch. I can finish this,‚Äù I say to her. She nods and walks aimlessly into the living room. I watch from the kitchen as she takes a seat and leans her head back into the couch, looking up to the ceiling. Brian takes a seat next to her and pulls her to him. I don‚Äôt even have to hear her to know she‚Äôs crying again. I can see it in the way she slumps against him and grabs hold of his shirt.  
  
¬† I look away.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMaybe you should come stay with us, Dean,‚Äù my father says, leaning against the counter. ‚ÄúJust for a little while. It might do you some good to get away.‚Äù  
  
¬† He‚Äôs the only one who still calls me Dean. I‚Äôve been going by Holder since I was eight, but the fact that I was named after him may be why he never took to calling me anything other than Dean. I only see him a couple of times a year, so it doesn‚Äôt bother me too much that he still calls me Dean. I still hate the name, though.  
  
¬† I look at him, then back to my mother still holding on to Brian in the living room. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt, Dad. I‚Äôm not leaving her. Especially now.‚Äù  
  
¬† He‚Äôs been trying to get me to move to Austin with him since they divorced. The truth is, I like it here. I haven‚Äôt liked visiting my old hometown since I moved away. Too many things remind me of Hope when I‚Äôm there.  
  
¬† But I guess too many things are going to start reminding me of Les, here.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell, my offer doesn‚Äôt expire,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúYou know that.‚Äù  
  
¬† I nod and switch off the burner. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ready,‚Äù I say.  
  
¬† Brian comes back to the kitchen with Pam and we all take seats at the table, but my mother remains in the living room, softly crying into the couch throughout dinner.  
  
¬† ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢  
  
¬† I‚Äôm waving good-bye to my father and Pam when Amy pulls up in front of our house. She waits for my father‚Äôs car to clear, then she pulls into our driveway. I walk to the driver‚Äôs side door and open it for her.  
  
¬† She smiles half-heartedly and flips the visor down, wiping the mascara from underneath the frame of her sunglasses. It‚Äôs been dark for over an hour now, yet she‚Äôs still wearing sunglasses. That can only mean she‚Äôs been crying.  
  
¬† I haven‚Äôt really talked to her much in the past four days, but I don‚Äôt have to ask her how she‚Äôs holding up. She and Les have been best friends for seven years. If there‚Äôs anyone that feels like I do right no  
w, it‚Äôs her. And I‚Äôm not even sure if I‚Äôm holding up all that well.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Thomas?‚Äù I ask when she steps out of the car.  
  
¬† She pushes her blonde hair away from her face with her sunglasses, adjusting them on top of her head. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs at his house. He had to go help his dad with some yard stuff after school.‚Äù  
  
¬† I don‚Äôt know how long the two of them have been dating, but they were together before Les and I even moved here. And we moved here in the fourth grade, so it‚Äôs been a while.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs your mom?‚Äù she asks. As soon as she says it, she shakes her head apologetically. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Holder. That was a really stupid question. I promised myself I wouldn‚Äôt be one of those people.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBelieve me, you‚Äôre not,‚Äù I assure her. I motion behind me. ‚ÄúYou coming inside?‚Äù  
  
¬† She nods and glances at the house, then to me. ‚ÄúDo you mind if I go up to her room? It‚Äôs fine if you don‚Äôt want me up there yet. It‚Äôs just that she had a few pictures I‚Äôd really like to have.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs fine.‚Äù Based on the relationship she had with Les, Amy has just as much right to be in Les‚Äôs bedroom as I do. I know Les would want Amy to take whatever it is she wants.  
  
¬† She follows me into the house and up the stairs. I notice my mother isn‚Äôt on the couch anymore. Brian must have finally coaxed her into going to bed. I walk to the top of the stairs with Amy, but have no desire to go into Les‚Äôs room with her. I nudge my head toward my bedroom. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be in my room if you need me.‚Äù  
  
¬† She inhales a deep, nervous breath and nods while releasing it. ‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù she says, eyeing Les‚Äôs door warily. She takes a reluctant step toward the bedroom, so I turn away and head to my room. I shut the door behind me and take a seat on the bed, picking up Les‚Äôs notebook while I lean back against my headboard. I‚Äôve already written her today, but I grab a pen because I‚Äôve got nothing better to do than write to her again. Or at least there‚Äôs nothing else I want to do because it all leads back to thoughts of her anyway.  
  
¬† Chapter Three-and-a-half  
  
¬† \* \* \*  
  
¬† Les,  
  
¬† Amy‚Äôs here. She‚Äôs in your room, going through your shit.  
  
¬† I wonder if she had any clue as to what you were about to do? I know sometimes girls share stuff with their girlfriends that they wouldn‚Äôt share with anyone else‚Äîeven twin brothers. Did you ever tell her how you really felt? Did you give her any hints at all? I‚Äôm really hoping you didn‚Äôt, because that would mean she probably feels pretty damn guilty right about now. She doesn‚Äôt deserve to feel guilty over what you did, Les. She‚Äôs been your best friend for seven years now, so I hope to hell you thought about that before you made such a selfish decision.  
  
¬† I feel guilty for what you did, but I deserve to feel guilty. There‚Äôs a responsibility that comes along with being a brother that doesn‚Äôt necessarily come along with being a best friend. It was my job to protect you, not Amy‚Äôs. So she doesn‚Äôt deserve to feel guilty.  
  
¬† Maybe that was my problem. Maybe I spent so much time trying to protect you from Grayson that I never thought who I really needed to be protecting you from was yourself.  
  
¬† H  
  
¬† ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢  
  
¬† There‚Äôs a light tap on my bedroom door, so I close the notebook and set it on the nightstand. Amy pushes open the door and I sit up on the bed. I motion for her to come in so she eases through the door and shuts it behind her. She walks over to my dresser and sets the pictures she collected down, running her finger over the top one. Tears are silently streaming down her cheeks.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCome here,‚Äù I say, holding a hand out to her. She walks closer to me and takes my hand, then completely breaks down the second she makes eye contact with me. I continue to pull her forward until she‚Äôs on the bed and I wrap my arms around her. She curls up against my chest, sobbing uncontrollably. She‚Äôs shaking so hard and it‚Äôs almost a devastated cry, but like I said before, devastated should be reserved for mothers.  
  
¬† I close my eyes tightly and try not to let it all hit me like it‚Äôs hitting Amy right now, but it‚Äôs hard. I can hold it in for my mother because she needs me to be strong for her. Amy doesn‚Äôt, though. If Amy feels anything like I do, then she just needs to know there‚Äôs someone else out there just as blindsided and heartbroken as she is.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShh,‚Äù I say, stroking her hair. I know she doesn‚Äôt want me to console her with empty, overused words. She just needs someone to understand how she feels and I may be the only one she knows who truly does. I don‚Äôt tell her to try to stop crying, because I know it‚Äôs impossible. I press my cheek against her head, hating the fact that I‚Äôm now crying, too. I‚Äôve done a pretty damn good job of keeping it in, but I can‚Äôt anymore. I continue to hold her and she continues to hold on to me because it‚Äôs nice to be able to find solace in such an ugly, lonely situation.  
  
¬† Listening to Amy cry reminds me of all the nights I used to be in this same position with Les. She wouldn‚Äôt want me to talk to her or help her stop crying. Les just needed me to hold her and let her cry, even if I had no idea why she needed it. Just being able to be here for Amy in this same small way gives me that familiar sense of being needed like I used to feel with Les. I haven‚Äôt felt needed since Les decided she didn‚Äôt need anyone.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry,‚Äù Amy says, her voice muffled by my shirt.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúFor what?‚Äù  
  
¬† She catches her breath and attempts to stop crying, but her effort is wasted with the new tears that follow. ‚ÄúI should have known, Holder. I had no idea. I was her best friend and I feel like everyone blames me and . . . I don‚Äôt know. Maybe they should. I don‚Äôt know. Maybe I‚Äôve been so wrapped up in my relationship with Thomas that I missed something she was trying to tell me.‚Äù  
  
¬† I continue stroking her hair, empathizing with every word coming out of her mouth. ‚ÄúYou and me both,‚Äù I sigh. I wipe the moisture away from my eyes with the back of my hand. ‚ÄúYou know, I keep trying to pinpoint moments that might have changed the outcome. Things I might have said to her or things she might have said to me. But even if I was able to go back and change something about the past, I‚Äôm not sure that it would have changed the outcome. You don‚Äôt know that, either. Les is the only one who knows for sure why she went through with it and unfortunately she‚Äôs the only one not here to enlighten us.‚Äù  
  
¬† Amy lets out a small laugh, although I‚Äôm not sure why. She pulls back slightly and looks at me with a solemn expression. ‚ÄúShe better be glad she‚Äôs not here, because I‚Äôm so mad at her, Holder.‚Äù Her somberness gives way to another sob and she brings a hand to her eyes. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so, so mad at her for not confiding in me and I feel like I can‚Äôt say that to anyone but you,‚Äù she whispers.  
  
¬† I move her hand away from her face and look her in the eyes because I don‚Äôt want her to feel like I‚Äôm judging her for that comment. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt feel guilty, Amy. Okay?‚Äù  
  
¬† She nods and smiles a sympathetic smile, then looks down at our hands resting on the pillow between us. I lay my hand on top of hers and smooth reassuring strokes across the top of it with my fingers. I know how she feels and she knows how I feel and it‚Äôs good to have that, even if only for a moment.  
  
¬† I want to tell her thank you for being there for Les all these years, but it seems so inappropriate to thank her for being there when she‚Äôs feeling the exact opposite right now. Instead, I remain quiet and bring my hand up to her face. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the magnitude of the moment or the fact that she made me feel somewhat needed again or if it‚Äôs simply because my head and my heart have been numb for so many days. Whatever it is, it‚Äôs here and I don‚Äôt want it to go away yet. I just let it completely take over while I slowly lean forward and press my mouth to hers.  
  
¬† I didn‚Äôt intend to kiss her. In fact, I expect myself to pull away any second, but I don‚Äôt. I expect her to push me away, but she doesn‚Äôt. The moment my mouth meets hers, she parts her lips and sighs as if this is exactly what she needs from me. Oddly enough, that makes me want to kiss her even more. I kiss her, knowing she‚Äôs my sister‚Äôs best friend. I kiss her, knowing she has a boyfriend. I kiss her, knowing this isn‚Äôt something I would  
do with her under any circumstance other than in this moment.  
  
¬† She slides her hand up my arm and slips her fingers inside the sleeve of my shirt, lightly tracing the contours of the muscles in my arm. I pull her closer to the middle of the bed with me and deepen our kiss. The more we kiss, the more we both recognize the fact that desire and need might just be the only thing that can minimize grief. We simultaneously grow more impatient, doing whatever we can to rid ourselves of the grief completely. Every stroke of her hand against my skin pulls me farther out of my own mind and more into the moment with her, so I kiss her more desperately, needing her to take my mind completely away from my life right now. My hand makes its way up her shirt and the second I cup her breast, she moans and digs her nails into my forearm, arching her back.  
  
¬† That‚Äôs a nonverbal cue for yes if I‚Äôve ever seen one.  
  
¬† I‚Äôve only got two things remaining on my mind as she begins to pull off my shirt and my hands are eagerly fumbling with the zipper on her jeans.  
  
¬† 1. I need to get these clothes off her.  
  
¬† 2. Thomas.  
  
¬† I normally don‚Äôt make a habit of thinking about other guys while I‚Äôm making out with girls, but I normally don‚Äôt make a habit of making out with other guys‚Äô girls. Amy isn‚Äôt mine to kiss, but here I am doing it anyway. Her clothes aren‚Äôt mine to be helping her out of, but here I am doing it anyway. Her panties aren‚Äôt something I should be slipping my hand inside of, but here I am doing it anyway.  
  
¬† I pull away from her mouth when I touch her and watch as she moans and presses her head back against my pillow. I keep doing what I‚Äôm doing to her with one hand while I lean across the bed and pull a condom out of the drawer with my other hand. I tear it open with my teeth, watching her intently the whole time. I know that neither of us is in the right frame of mind right now or this wouldn‚Äôt be happening. Regardless if we‚Äôre in the right frame of mind or not, at least we‚Äôre in the same frame of mind. I‚Äôm hoping we are, anyway.

Hey there, I‚Äôm a 33 year old guy from Southeast Michigan. I‚Äôd like to meet a woman who‚Äôs also looking for something genuine, friendship first with the possibility of it naturally turning into more if the vibe is right.

A little about me: I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10‚Äù, athletic build, brown hair, green eyes, and I‚Äôve been told I have a laid back but fun personality. I love the outdoors, camping, hiking, or just sitting by a fire, but I‚Äôm equally happy with a good book, a great show, or sharing coffee and conversation. Sarcasm, laughter, and physical affection go a long way with me.

I‚Äôm not into games or drama, just hoping to connect with someone who‚Äôs kind, fun, and knows what she wants. Whether it stays as a solid friendship or grows into something more, I‚Äôm open to seeing where things go.

If any of this clicks with you, feel free to reach out, I‚Äôd love to chat.",1,1758303600.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 15-20 people turning up.*

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

*No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

*We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious*

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Each week we typically get a mix of regulars, people who drop by occasionally and a few newbies.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

**Is this happening today?**

*Is today Monday?*

*Yes: Yes! It'll be today\*\**

*No: Nope, try next Monday\*\**

**Aww, I missed this when is the next one?**

Monday\*\*

\*\* we meet on public holidays, but if Monday falls on Christmas or New Years Day we'll likely skip those.

[Initial meetup.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/oudzf/300112_hammersmith_drinks/)

**Location/Time:** [Latymers, W6 8BS](http://www.latymershammersmith.co.uk/) / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19.30ish. There are usually a few people left when the pub closes - usually 23:00

Our tables are reserved, we start on the circular tables close to the entrance and we might spill over onto the table(s) nearby. There is no need to book a space/get a ticket.

The first table will either be outside or at the front to the right of the door. (also, there will be Reddit on the reserved signs [And hopefully Snoo](https://i.imgur.com/KIm6pYs.jpg)). The bar staff also know who we are if you're not sure.

There's an optional Whatsapp group for the meetup -it's pretty much only me posting this link each week and trying to get people to actually respond.. 
If you really do want to join it just ask around at the meetup.

I‚Äôm on limited warranty, so the apple repair costs totalled up to the cost of the macbook pro itself (above 3k) Third party repair shops also quoted me a thousand, because the macbook is so new, i‚Äôm not even sure where they would get the replacement screen.

I‚Äôm back to using my old windows laptop for my school work, but I‚Äôm not sure what to do now. Wait a few months and maybe the repair cost will come down, but corrosion will spread even more. Or get it fixed but invalidate the warranty forever (not like the limited warranty is worth much). And that the repair cost is 1/3 of the original price is still an issue in itself (but at least, its not the full price that apple quoted bcos wtf)

Now that I‚Äôve been reading the right way to treat a macbook after a water spill, I feel like such an idiot haha, but really I realised so many people actually don‚Äôt know that.

I‚Äôve been doing a ton of salt and electrolytes, taking breaks as much as I can. Greatly reduced my coffee (one small cup a day, and I have it long before eating)

My chest already ached. Mom had called me on their way home to tell me what she‚Äôd done and that now she needed to go out to have some cocktails with friends. I‚Äôd be the one that would need to soothe Nan. My mom couldn‚Äôt handle the stress it involved. Or so she‚Äôd said when she called me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúRush?‚Äù Nan‚Äôs voice called out with a hiccup. She‚Äôd been crying.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here, Nan,‚Äù I said as I stood up from the beanbag I‚Äôd been sitting on in the corner. It was my hiding spot. In this house you needed a hiding spot. If you didn‚Äôt have one then bad things happened.  
  
¬† Strands of Nan‚Äôs red curls stuck to her wet face. Her bottom lip quivered as she stared up at me with those sad eyes of hers. I hardly ever saw them happy. My mother only gave her attention when she needed to dress her up and show her off. The rest of the time she was ignored. Exceptby me. I did my best to make her feel wanted.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt see him. He wasn‚Äôt there,‚Äù she whispered as a small sob escaped. I didn‚Äôt have to ask who ‚Äúhe‚Äù was. I knew. Mom had gotten tired of hearing Nan ask about her father. So she‚Äôd decided to take her to see him. I wish she‚Äôd told me. I wish I could have gone. The stricken look on Nan‚Äôs face had my hands balling into fist. If I ever saw that man I was gonna punch him in the nose. I wanted to see him bleed.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCome here,‚Äù I said, reaching out a hand and pulling my little sister into my arms. She wrapped hers around my waist and squeezed me tightly. Times like this it was hard to breathe. I hated the life she‚Äôd been given. At least I knew my dad wanted me. He spent time with me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHe has other daughters. Two of them. And they‚Äôre‚Ä¶ beautiful. Their hair is like an angel‚Äôs hair. And they have a momma that lets them play outside in the dirt. They were wearing tennis shoes. Dirty ones.‚Äù Nan was envious of dirty tennis shoes. Our mother didn‚Äôt allow her to be less than perfect at all times. She‚Äôd never even owned a pair of tennis shoes.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThey can‚Äôt be more beautiful than you,‚Äù I assured her because I firmly believed that.  
  
¬† Nan sniffed and then pulled back from me. Her head tilted up and those big green eyes looked up at me. ‚ÄúThey are. I saw them. I could see pictures on the wall with both girls and a man. He loves them‚Ä¶. He doesn‚Äôt love me.‚Äù  
  
¬† I couldn‚Äôt lie to her. She was right. He didn‚Äôt love her.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a stupid asshat. You have me, Nan. You‚Äôll always have me.‚Äù  
  
¬† Blaire  
  
¬† Present Day‚Ä¶  
  
¬† Fifteen miles out of town was far enough. No one ever came this far out of Sumit to visit a pharmacy. Unless of course they were nineteen and in need of something they didn‚Äôt want the town to know they had purchased. Everything bought at the local pharmacy would be spread throughout the small town of Sumit, Alabama within the hour. Especially if you were unmarried and purchasing condoms‚Ä¶ or a pregnancy test.  
  
¬† I put the pregnancy tests up on the counter and didn‚Äôt make eye contact with the clerk. I couldn‚Äôt. The fear and guilt in my eyes was something I didn‚Äôt want to share with a random stranger. This was something I hadn‚Äôt even told Cain. Since I forced Rush out of my life three weeks ago I‚Äôd slowly fallen back into the routine of spending all my time with Cain. It was easy. He didn‚Äôt press me to talk but when I did want to talk about it he listened.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSixteen dollars and fifteen cents,‚Äù the lady on the other side of the counter said. I could hear the concern in her voice. Not surprising. This was the purchase of shame all teenage girls feared. I handed her a twenty dollar bill without lifting my eyes from the small bag she‚Äôd placed in front of me. It held the one answer I needed and that terrified me. Ignoring the fact my period was two weeks late and pretending like this wasn‚Äôt happening was easier. But I had to know.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThree dollars and eighty-five cents is your change,‚Äù she said as I reached out and took the money in her outstretched hand.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù I mumbled and took the bag.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI hope it all turns out okay,‚Äù the lady said in a gentle tone. I lifted my eyes and met a pair of sympathetic brown eyes. She was a stranger that I‚Äôd never see again but in that moment it helped having someone else know. I didn‚Äôt feel so alone.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMe too,‚Äù I replied before turning from her and walking toward the door. Back into the hot summer sun.  
  
¬† I‚Äôd taken two steps out into the parking lot when my eyes fell on the driver‚Äôs side of my truck. Cain leaned against it with his arms crossed over his chest. The gray baseball cap he was wearing had a University of Alabama A on it and was pulled down low shading his eyes from me.  
  
¬† I stopped and stared at him. There was no lying about this. He knew I hadn‚Äôt come here to buy condoms. There was only one other option. Even without the ability to see the expression in his eyes I knew‚Ä¶ that he knew.  
  
¬† I swallowed the lump in my throat that I‚Äôd been fighting since I got in my truck this morning and headed out of town. Now it wasn‚Äôt just me and the stranger behind the counter that knew. My bestfriend knew too.  
  
¬† I forced myself to put one foot in front of the other. He‚Äôd ask questions and I would have to answer. After the past few weeks he deserved an explanation. He deserved the truth. But how did I explain this?  
  
¬† I stopped just a few feet in front of him. I was glad the hat shaded his face. It would be easier to explain if I couldn‚Äôt see the thoughts flashing in his eyes.  
  
¬† We stood in silence. I wanted him to speak first but after what felt like several minutes of him not saying anything I knew he wanted me to say something first.¬†/>  
¬† ‚ÄúHow did you know where I was?‚Äù I finally asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre staying at my grandmother‚Äôs. The moment you left acting strangely, she called me. I was worried about you,‚Äù he replied.  
  
¬† Tears stung my eyes. I would not cry about this. I‚Äôd cried all I was going to cry. Clenching the bag holding the pregnancy test closer I straightened my shoulders. ‚ÄúYou followed me,‚Äù I said. It wasn‚Äôt a question.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOf course I did,‚Äù he replied, then shook his head and turned his gaze away from me to focus on something else. ‚ÄúWere you gonna tell me, Blaire?‚Äù  
  
¬† Was I going to tell him? I didn‚Äôt know. I hadn‚Äôt thought that far. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure there is anything to tell just yet,‚Äù I replied honestly.  
  
¬† Cain shook his head and let out a hard low chuckle that held no humor. ‚ÄúNot sure, huh? You came all the way out here because you weren‚Äôt sure?‚Äù  
  
¬† He was angry. Or was he hurt? He had no reason to be either. ‚ÄúUntil I take this test I‚Äôm not sure. I‚Äôm late. That‚Äôs all. There‚Äôs no reason I should tell you about this. It isn‚Äôt your concern.‚Äù  
  
¬† Slowly, Cain turned his head back to level his gaze on me. He lifted his hand and tilted his hat back. The shade was gone from his eyes. There was disbelief and pain there. I hadn‚Äôt wanted to see that. It was almost worse than seeing judgment in his eyes. In a way judgment was better.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúReally? That‚Äôs how you feel? After all we‚Äôve been through that‚Äôs how you honestly feel?‚Äù  
  
¬† What we had been through was in the past. He was my past. I‚Äôd been through a lot without him. While he‚Äôd enjoyed his high school years I had struggled to hold my life together. What exactly did he think he‚Äôd suffered? Anger slowly boiled in my blood and I lifted my eyes to glare at him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes, Cain. That‚Äôs how I feel. I‚Äôm not sure what exactly you think we‚Äôve been through. We were best friends, then we were a couple, then my momma got sick and you needed your dick sucked so you cheated on me. I took care of my sick momma alone. No one to lean on. Then she died and I moved. I got my heart and world shattered and came home. You‚Äôve been here for me. I didn‚Äôt ask you to but you have. I‚Äôm thankful for that but it doesn‚Äôt make all that other stuff go away. It doesn‚Äôt make up for the fact you deserted me when I needed you the most. So excuse me if when my world is once again about to be jerked out from under me that you aren‚Äôt the first person I run to. You haven‚Äôt earned that yet.‚Äù  
  
¬† I was breathing hard and the tears I hadn‚Äôt wanted to shed were running down my face. I hadn‚Äôt wanted to cry dammit. I closed the distance between us and used all my strength to shove him out of my way so I could grab the door handle and jerk it open. I needed out of here.Away from him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMove,‚Äù I yelled as I tried hard to open the door with his weight still against it.  
  
¬† I expected him to argue with me. I expected something other than him doing as I asked. I climbed inside the driver‚Äôs seat and threw the little plastic bag in the seat beside me before cranking the truck and backing out of the parking spot. I could see Cain still standing there. He hadn‚Äôt moved that much. Just enough so that I could get inside my truck. He wasn‚Äôt looking at me. He was staring at the ground as if it had all the answers. I couldn‚Äôt worry about him right now. I needed to get away.  
  
¬† Maybe I shouldn‚Äôt have said those things to him. Maybe I should have kept them inside where I‚Äôd buried them all these years. But it was too late now. He‚Äôd pushed me at the wrong moment. I would not feel bad about this.  
  
¬† I also couldn‚Äôt go back to his grandmother‚Äôs. She was on to me. He‚Äôd probably call her and tell her. If not the truth, then something close to it. I didn‚Äôt have any other options. I was going to have to take a pregnancy test in the restroom at a service station. Could this get any worse?  
  
¬† Rush  
  
¬† The waves crashing against the shore used to soothe me. I‚Äôd been sitting out here on this deck watching the water since I was kid. It had always helped me find a better perspective on things. That wasn‚Äôt working for me anymore.  
  
¬† The house was empty. My mother and ‚Ä¶ the man who I wanted to burn in Hell for all fucking eternity had left as soon as I got back from Alabama three weeks ago. I‚Äôd been angry, broken, and wild. After threatening the life of the man my mother was married to, I‚Äôd demanded they leave. I didn‚Äôt want to see either of them. I needed to call my mom and talk to her but I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to do that just yet.  
  
¬† Forgiving my mom was easier said than done. Nan, my sister, had stopped by several times and begged me to talk to her. This wasn‚Äôt Nan‚Äôs fault but I couldn‚Äôt talk to her about this either. She reminded me of what I‚Äôd lost. What I‚Äôd barely had. What I‚Äôd never expected to find.  
  
¬† A loud banging came from inside the house and broke into my thoughts. Turning, I looked back and realized that someone was at the door as the doorbellrang followed by knocking again. Who the hell was that? No one had stopped by except my sister and Grant since Blaire had left.  
  
¬† I put my beer down on the table beside me and stood up. Whoever it was they needed a real good reason for coming over here uninvited. I walked through a house that had stayed clean since Henrietta, the house cleaner‚Äôs, last visit. With no parties or social life it was easy to keep things from getting destroyed. I was finding I liked this much better.  
  
¬† The knocking started up again as I reached the door and I jerked it open ready to tell whoever it was to fuck off when words failed me. This wasn‚Äôt someone I‚Äôd ever expected to see again. I‚Äôd only met the guy once and I instantly hated him. Now he was here, I wanted to grab him by the shoulders and shake him until he told me how she was. If she was okay. Where she was living? God I hoped she wasn‚Äôt living with him. What if he‚Äôd‚Ä¶ no, no, no, that hadn‚Äôt happened. She wouldn‚Äôt. Not my Blaire.  
  
¬† My hands clenched tightly into fists at my sides.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI need to know one thing,‚Äù Cain, the boy from Blaire‚Äôs past, said as I stared at him in confused disbelief. ‚ÄúDid you,‚Äù he stopped and swallowed. ‚ÄúDo you‚Ä¶ fuck‚Äî‚Äù He took off his baseball cap and ran a hand through his hair. I noticed the dark circles under his eyes and the tired, weary expression on his face.  
  
¬† My heart stopped. I grabbed his upper arm and shook him. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Blaire? Is she okay?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs fine‚Ä¶ I mean, she‚Äôs okay. Let go of me before you break my damn arm,‚Äù Cain snapped, jerking his arm away from me. ‚ÄúBlaire is alive and well in Sumit. That isn‚Äôt why I‚Äôm here.‚Äù  
  
¬† Then why was he here? We had one connection. Blaire.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhen she left Sumit she was innocent. Very innocent. I had been her only boyfriend. I know how innocent she was. We‚Äôve been best friends since we were kids. The Blaire that came back wasn‚Äôt the same one that left. She doesn‚Äôt talk about it. She won‚Äôt talk about it. I just need to know if you and her‚Ä¶ if y‚Äôall‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm just gonna say this, did you fuck her?‚Äù  
  
¬† My vision blurred as I moved without any thought other than to murder him. He‚Äôd crossed a line. He wasn‚Äôt allowed to talk about Blaire like that. He wasn‚Äôt allowed to ask those kinds of questions or doubt her innocence. Blaire was innocent, damn him. He had no right.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHoly shit! Rush, bro, put him down!‚Äù Grant‚Äôs voice called out to me. I heard him but it was far away and in a tunnel. I was focused on the guy in front of me as my fist connected with his face and blood spewed from his nose. He was bleeding. I needed him to bleed. I needed someone to fucking bleed.  
  
¬† Two arms wrapped around mine from behind and pulled me away as Cain stumbled backwards holding his hands up to his nose with a panicked look in his eyes. Well, one of his eyes. The other one was already swelling shut.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat the hell did you say to him?‚Äù Grant asked from behind me. It was Grant who had me in a vise grip.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you fucking say it!‚Äù I roared when Cain opened his mouth to reply. I couldn‚Äôt hear him talk about her like that. What we had done was more than something dirty or wrong. He acted like I‚Äôd ruined her. Blaire was innocent. So incredibly innocent.What he had done didn‚Äôt change that.  
  
¬† Grant‚Äôs arms tightened on me as he pulled me bac  
k against his chest. ‚ÄúYou need to go now. I can only hold him for so long. He‚Äôs got about twenty more pounds of muscle on him than I do and this ain‚Äôt as easy as it looks. You need to run, dude. Don‚Äôt come back. You‚Äôre one lucky shit I showed up.‚Äù  
  
¬† Cain nodded and then stumbled back to his truck. The anger had simmered in my veins but I still felt it. I wanted to hurt him more. To wash away any thought he may have in his head that Blaire wasn‚Äôt as perfect as she had been when she had left Alabama. He didn‚Äôt know what all she‚Äôd been through. The hell my family had put her through. How could he take care of her? She needed me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIf I let you go are you gonna chase his truck down or are we good?‚Äù Grant asked loosening his hold on me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm good,‚Äù I assured him as I shrugged free of his arms and walked over to the railing to grip it and take several deep breaths. The pain was back full force. I‚Äôd managed to bury it until it only throbbed a little but seeing that chickenshit reminded me of everything. That night. The one I would never recover from. The one that would mark me forever.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCan I ask you what the hell that was about or are you gonna beat the shit outta me too?‚Äù Grant asked putting some distance between us.  
  
¬† He was my brother for all intents and purposes. Our parents had been married when we were kids. Long enough for us to form that bond. Even though my mom had a couple husbands since then Grant was still my family. He knew enough to know this was about Blaire.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBlaire‚Äôs ex-boyfriend,‚Äù I replied without looking back at him.  
  
¬† Grant cleared his throat. ‚ÄúSo, uh, he come over here to gloat? Or did you just beat him to a bloody pulp because he touched her once?‚Äù  
  
¬† Both. Neither. I shook my head. ‚ÄúNo. He came over here asking questions about me and Blaire. Things that weren‚Äôt his business. He asked the wrong thing.‚Äù  
Ah, I see. That makes sense. Well he paid for it. The dude‚Äôs probably got a broken nose to go with that closed shut eye of his.‚Äù  
  
¬† I finally lifted my head and looked back at Grant. ‚ÄúThanks for pulling me off him. I just snapped.‚Äù  
  
¬† Grant nodded then opened the door. ‚ÄúCome on. Let‚Äôs go turn on the game and drink a beer.‚Äù  
  
¬† Blaire  
  
¬† My mother‚Äôs grave was the only place I could think of to go. I had no home. I couldn‚Äôt go back to Granny Q‚Äôs. She was Cain‚Äôs grandmother. He was probably there waiting on me. Or maybe he wasn‚Äôt. Maybe I‚Äôd pushed him away too. I sat down at the foot of my mother‚Äôs grave.I pulled my knees up under my chin and wrapped my arms around my legs.  
  
¬† I had come back to Sumit because it was the only place I knew to come. Now, I needed to leave. I couldn‚Äôt stay here. Once again my life was about to take a sudden turn. One I wasn‚Äôt prepared for. When I‚Äôd been a little girl my momma had taken us to Sunday school at the local Baptist church. I remembered a scripture they read us from the Bible about God not putting more on us than we could bear. I was beginning to wonder if that was just for those people who went to church every Sunday and prayed before they went to bed at night. Because he wasn‚Äôt holding back any punches with me.  
  
¬† Feeling sorry for myself didn‚Äôt help me. I couldn‚Äôt do that. I had to figure this one out too. My staying with Granny Q and letting Cain help me deal with day to day life had only been temporary. I knew when I moved into her guest bedroom that I couldn‚Äôt stay long. There was too much history between Cain and me. History I didn‚Äôt intend to repeat. The time to leave was here but I was still just as clueless about where I was gonna go and what I was gonna do as I had been three weeks ago.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI wish you were here, Momma. I don‚Äôt know what to do and I don‚Äôt have anyone to ask,‚Äù I whispered as I sat there in the quiet cemetery. I wanted to believe she could hear me. I didn‚Äôt like the idea of her being under the ground but after my twin sister, Valerie, had died I‚Äôd sat here in this spot with my mom and we‚Äôd talked to Valerie. Momma had said her spirit was watching out for us and she could hear us. I so wanted to believe that now.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just me. I miss y‚Äôall. I don‚Äôt want to be alone‚Ä¶ but I am. And I‚Äôm scared.‚Äù The only sound was the wind rustling the leaves in the trees. ‚ÄúYou once told me if I listened real hard I‚Äôd know the answer in my heart. I‚Äôm listening Momma, but I am so confused. Maybe you could help me out by pointing me in the right direction somehow?‚Äù  
  
¬† I rested my chin on my knees and closed my eyes, refusing to cry.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúRemember when you said I needed to tell Cain exactly how I felt. That I wouldn‚Äôt feel better until I had it all out. Well, I did just that today. Even if he does forgive me it‚Äôll never be the same. I can‚Äôt keep relying on him for things anyway. It‚Äôs time I figure this out on my own. I just don‚Äôt know how.‚Äù  
  
¬† Just asking her made me feel better. Knowing I wouldn‚Äôt get an answer didn‚Äôt seem to matter.  
  
¬† A car door slammed breaking the peacefulness and I dropped my arms from my legs and turned to look back at the parking lot to see a car too expensive for this little town. Turning my eyes to see who had stepped out of it I gasped then jumped up. It was Bethy. She was here. In [Sumit.In](http://Sumit.In) the cemetery‚Ä¶ driving a very, very expensive looking car.  
  
¬† Her long brown hair was pulled over her shoulder in a ponytail. There was a smile tugging on her lips as my eyes met hers. I couldn‚Äôt move. I was afraid I was imagining things. What was Bethy doing here?  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou not having a cell phone is for the birds. How the hell am I supposed to call you and tell you I‚Äôm coming to get your ass if I have no number to call? Hmmm?‚Äù Her words made no sense but just hearing her voice sent me running the short distance between us.  
  
¬† Bethy laughed and opened her arms as I flung myself into them. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre here,‚Äù I said after hugging her.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah, well, me either. That was one long drive. But you‚Äôre worth it and seeing as you left the cell phone in Rosemary I had no way to talk to you.‚Äù  
  
¬† I wanted to tell her everything but I couldn‚Äôt. Not yet. I needed time. She knew about my dad already. She knew about Nan. But the rest‚Ä¶ I knew she didn‚Äôt know.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôre here but how did you find me?‚Äù  
  
¬† Bethy grinned and tilted her head to the side. ‚ÄúI drove through town looking for your truck. It wasn‚Äôt that hard. This place has like one red light. If I had blinked twice I‚Äôd have missed it.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat car probably caught some attention coming through town,‚Äù I said glancing over at it.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Jace‚Äôs. That thing rides like a dream.‚Äù  
  
¬† She was still with Jace. Good. But my chest ached. Jace reminded me of Rosemary. And Rosemary reminded me of Rush.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôd ask you how you are but girl, you look like a walking stick figure. Have you had food since you left Rosemary?‚Äù  
  
¬† My clothes were all falling off me. Eating had been difficult with the large knot that stayed tight in my chest at all times. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a rough few weeks but I think I‚Äôm getting better. Moving on from things. Dealing with it.‚Äù  
  
¬† Bethy shifted her gaze to the grave behind me. Both of them. I could see the sadness in her eyes as she read both the headstones. ‚ÄúNo one can take away your memories. You have those,‚Äù she said squeezing my hand in hers.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI know. I don‚Äôt believe them. My father is a liar. I don‚Äôt believe any of them. She, my mother, she wouldn‚Äôt have done what they claim. If anyone is to blame it is my father. He caused this pain. Not my momma. Never my momma.‚Äù  
  
¬† Bethy nodded and held my hand firmly in hers. Just having someone listen to me and know they believed me, that they believed my mother‚Äôs innocence helped.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDid your sister look a lot like you?‚Äù  
  
¬† The last memory I had of Valerie was of her smiling. That bright smile that was so much prettier than mine. Her teeth were perfect without the help of braces. Her eyes were brighter than mine. But everyone said we were identical. They didn‚Äôt see the difference. I always wondered why. I could see it so clearly.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe were identical,‚Äù I replied. Bethy wouldn‚Äôt understand the truth.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt imagine two Blaire Wynns. Y‚Äôall must have broken hearts all over this little town.‚Äù She was trying to lighten the mood after asking about my deceased sister. I appreciated it.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúJust Valerie. I was with Cain from the time I was young. I didn‚Äôt break any hearts.‚Äù  
  
¬† Bethy‚Äôs eyes went a little wide then she glanced away before clearing her throat. I waited until she turned back to me. ‚ÄúAlthough seeing you is awesome and we could totally rock this town, I‚Äôm actually here for a purpose.‚Äù  
  
¬† I assumed she was I just couldn‚Äôt figure out what that purpose was exactly.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I said waiting for more of an explanation.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCan we talk about this over a coffee?‚Äù She frowned then glanced back at the street. ‚ÄúOr maybe the Dairy K since that‚Äôs like the only place I saw when I drove through town.‚Äù  
  
¬† She wasn‚Äôt comfortable hanging out amongst the graves like I was. That was normal. I was not. ‚ÄúYeah, okay,‚Äù I said and walked over to pick up my purse.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs your answer,‚Äù a soft voice whispered so quietly I almost thought I‚Äôd imagined it. Turning to look back at Bethy she was smiling with her hands tucked in her front pockets.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDid you say something?‚Äù I asked confused.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúUh, you mean after I suggested we go to the Dairy K?‚Äù she asked.  
  
¬† I nodded. ‚ÄúYeah. Did you whisper something?‚Äù  
  
¬† She scrunched her nose and then glanced around nervously and shook her head. ‚ÄúNope‚Ä¶ um‚Ä¶ why don‚Äôt we get out of here?‚Äù she said reaching for my arm and pulling me behind her back toward Jace‚Äôs car.  
  
¬† I looked back at my mom‚Äôs grave and a peace settled over me. Had that been‚Ä¶? No. Surely not. Shaking my head, I turned back around and went to get into the passenger side before Bethy threw me in.  
  
¬† Rush  
  
¬† It was my mother‚Äôs birthday. Nan had called me twice already a  
sking me to call our mother. I couldn‚Äôt do it. She was on a beach in the Bahamas with him. This hadn‚Äôt affected her at all. Once again she‚Äôd run off to enjoy her life while leaving her kids behind to figure things out.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNan‚Äôs calling again. You want me to answer it and tell her to leave you the hell alone?‚Äù Grant walked into the living room holding up my cell phone in his hand while it rang.  
  
¬† Those two fought like actual siblings. ‚ÄúNo, give it to me,‚Äù I replied as he tossed me the phone.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNan,‚Äù I said in greeting.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAre you going to call Mother or not? She has called me twice now asking me if I talked to you and if you remembered it was her birthday. She does care about you. Stop letting that girl ruin everything, Rush. She pulled a gun on me for God‚Äôs sake. A gun, Rush. She is crazy. She‚Äî‚Äú  
  
¬† ‚ÄúStop. Don‚Äôt say anything else. You don‚Äôt know her. You don‚Äôt want to know her. So just stop. I‚Äôm not calling Mom. The next time she calls tell her that. I don‚Äôt want to hear her voice. I don‚Äôt give a shit about her trip or what she got for her birthday.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOuch,‚Äù Grant muttered as he sank down on the couch across from me and propped his legs up on the ottoman in front of him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôd say that. I don‚Äôt understand you. She can‚Äôt be that good in‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Nannette. This conversation is over. Call me if you need me.‚Äù  
  
¬† I pressed end then slung my phone on the seat beside me and laid my head back on the cushion.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go out. Drink a little. Dance with some girls. Forget this shit. All of it,‚Äù Grant said. He‚Äôd suggested this several times over the past three weeks. Or at least since I‚Äôd stopped breaking things and he felt it was safe enough to speak.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I replied without looking at him. There was no reason to act like I was okay. Until I knew Blaire was okay, I was never going to be okay. She may not forgive me. Hell she may never look at me again but I needed to know she was healing. I needed to know something. Anything.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been real good about not prying. I‚Äôve let you go crazy, roar at everything that moved and sulk. I think it‚Äôs time you told me something. What happened when you went to Alabama? Something had to have happened. You didn‚Äôt come back the same.‚Äù  
  
¬† I loved Grant like a brother but there was no way I was telling him about the night in the hotel room with Blaire. She‚Äôd been hurting and I‚Äôd been desperate. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to talk about that. But I do need to get out. Stop staring at these walls and remembering her‚Ä¶ yeah I need to get out.‚Äù I stood up and Grant jumped up from his spot on the couch. The relief in his eyes was obvious.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat are you up for? Beer or girls or both?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLoud music,‚Äù I replied. I really didn‚Äôt need any beer and the girls‚Ä¶ I just wasn‚Äôt ready for that.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll have to leave town. Maybe head to Destin?‚Äù  
  
¬† I threw my car keys at him. ‚ÄúSure, lead the way.‚Äù  
  
¬† The doorbell rang stopping both of us. The last time I‚Äôd had an unexpected guest it hadn‚Äôt ended well. It very likely could be the cops coming to arrest me for bashing Cain‚Äôs face in. Oddly enough, I didn‚Äôt care. I was numb.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get it,‚Äù Grant said, glancing at me with a concerned frown. He was thinking the same thing.  
  
¬† I sat back down on the sofa and propped my feet up on the coffee table in front of me. My mom hated it when I put my feet on this table. She‚Äôd bought it during one of her international shopping trips and had it shipped back here. I felt a sudden pang of guilt for not calling her but I pushed it away. My entire life I‚Äôd made that woman happy and taken care of Nan. I wasn‚Äôt doing that anymore. I was done. With all her shit.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúJace, what‚Äôs up? We were just headed out. You want to come with?‚Äù Grant said stepping back and letting Jace walk into the house. I didn‚Äôt get up. I wanted him to leave. Seeing Jace reminded me of Bethy who then reminded me of Blaire. Jace needed to leave.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúUh, no, I uh‚Ä¶ I needed to talk to you about something,‚Äù Jace said, shuffling his feet and stuffing his hands in his pockets. He looked ready to bolt out the door.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I replied.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúToday might not be the best time to talk to him, man,‚Äù Grant said, stepping in front of Jace and focusing on me. ‚ÄúWe were gonna head out. Let‚Äôs go. Jace can bare his soul later.‚Äù  
  
¬† Now I was curious. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a loose cannon, Grant. Sit down. Let him talk.‚Äù  
  
¬† Grant let out a sigh and shook his head. ‚ÄúFine. You wanna tell him this shit now, then tell him.‚Äù  
  
¬† Jaceglanced over at Grant nervously then he looked back at me. He walked over and sat down on the chair furthest from me. I watched as he tucked his hair behind his ear and wondered what he had to say that was such a big deal.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBethy and I are getting kinda serious,‚Äù he started. I already knew this. I didn‚Äôt care. I felt the pain crack open my chest and I clenched my fists.I had to concentrate on forcing air into my lungs. Bethy had been Blaire‚Äôs friend. She‚Äôd know how Blaire was. ‚ÄúAnd uh‚Ä¶ well Bethy‚Äôs rent went up and that place was shitty anyway. I didn‚Äôt feel safe with her staying there. So, I talked to Woods and he said that his dad had a two bedroom condo available if I wanted to rent that. I uh, got it for her and paid the deposit and everything. But when I took her to see it she got pissed. Big time pissed. She didn‚Äôt want me to pay her rent. She said it made her feel cheap.‚Äù He sighed and the apologetic look in his eyes still made no sense. I didn‚Äôt care about his fight with Bethy.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs twice as much‚Ä¶ or, at least, Bethy thinks it is twice as much as her last place. It is actually four times as much as her last place. I swore Woods to secrecy. I‚Äôm paying the other portion without her knowing. Anyway. She, uh‚Ä¶ she‚Ä¶ took off to Alabama today. She loves the condo. She wants to live on the club property and on the beach. But the only person she would even consider having as a roommate is‚Ä¶ Blaire.‚Äù  
  
¬† I stood up. I couldn‚Äôt sit.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhoa man‚Ä¶ sit down.‚Äù Grant jumped up and I waved him off.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not mad. I just need to breathe,‚Äù I said, staring out the glass doors at the waves crashing against the shore. Bethy had gone to get Blaire. My heart was racing. Would she come?  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI know the two of you had a bad end. I asked her not to but she got real mad and I don‚Äôt like to upset her. She said she missed Blaire and that Blaire needed someone. She, uh, also talked to Woods about giving Blaire back her job if she can get Blaire to come back.‚Äù  
  
¬† Blaire.Coming back‚Ä¶  
  
¬† She wouldn‚Äôt come back. She hated me. She hated Nan. She hated my mom. She hated her father. She wouldn‚Äôt come back here‚Ä¶ but God, I wanted her to. I turned my head and looked at Jace.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe won‚Äôt come back,‚Äù I said. The pain in my voice was undeniable. I didn‚Äôt care about hiding it. Not anymore.  
  
¬† Jace shrugged.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe may have had enough time to deal with things. What if she does come back? What will you do?‚Äù Grant asked me.  
  
¬† What would I do?  
  
¬† I‚Äôd beg.  
  
¬† Blaire  
  
¬† Bethy pulled Jace‚Äôs car into the parking lot of the Dairy K. I noticed Callie‚Äôs little blue Volkswagen and decided against getting out of the car. I‚Äôd only seen Callie twice since I returned and she‚Äôd been ready to claw my eyes out. She‚Äôd had her sights on Cain since high school. I‚Äôd come home and messed up whatever kind of relationship they‚Äôd finally managed to have. I hadn‚Äôt meant to. She could have Cain.  
  
¬† Bethy started to get out of the car and I grabbed her arm. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just talk in the car,‚Äù I said, stopping her.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBut I want some ice cream mixed with Oreos,‚Äù she complained.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt talk in there. I know too many people,‚Äù I explained.  
  
¬† Bethy sighed and leaned back in her seat. ‚ÄúOkay fine. My ass doesn‚Äôt need any ice cream and cookies anyway.‚Äù  
  
¬† I smiled and relaxed, thankful for the dark tinted windows. Knowing I wasn‚Äôt on display as people stopped and stared at Jace‚Äôs car. No one around here drove cars even close to this one‚Äôs league.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äô  
m not gonna beat around the bush with this, Blaire. I miss you. I‚Äôve never had a close girlfriend before. Ever. Then you came along and then you left. I hate you being gone. Work sucks without you there. I have no one to tell about my sex life with Jace and how sweet he‚Äôs being which is something I wouldn‚Äôt have if I hadn‚Äôt listened to you. I just miss you.‚Äù  
  
¬† I felt tears sting my eyes. Just being missed felt good. I missed her too. I missed a lot of things. ‚ÄúI miss you too,‚Äù I replied, hoping I didn‚Äôt get all weepy.  
  
¬† Bethy nodded and a smile tugged on her lips. ‚ÄúOkay good. Because I need you to come back and live with me.Jace got me a waterfront condo on the club‚Äôs property. I, however, refuse to let him pay for it. So I need a roommate. Please come back. I need you. And Woods said you‚Äôd have your job back immediately.‚Äù  
  
¬† Go back to Rosemary? Where Rush was‚Ä¶ and Nan‚Ä¶ and my dad. I couldn‚Äôt go back. I couldn‚Äôt see them. They‚Äôd be at the club. Would my dad take Nan to play golf? Could I see that? No. I couldn‚Äôt. It would be too much.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt,‚Äù I choked out. I wished I could. I didn‚Äôt know where I was going to go now that I knew I was pregnant but I couldn‚Äôt go to Rosemary and I couldn‚Äôt stay here.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPlease, Blaire. He misses you too. He never leaves his house. Jace said he‚Äôs pitiful.‚Äù  
  
¬† The angry wound in my chest flared to life. Knowing Rush was hurting too was hard. I‚Äôd imagined him having his house parties and moving on. I didn‚Äôt want him to still be sad. I just needed for us to move on. But maybe I never would. I‚Äôd always have a reminder of Rush.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt see them. Any of them. It would be too hard,‚Äù I stopped. I couldn‚Äôt tell Bethy about my pregnancy. I had hardly had time to comprehend it. I wasn‚Äôt ready to tell anyone. I might never tell anyone other than Cain. I would be leaving here soon enough. Where I went I wouldn‚Äôt know anyone. I‚Äôd be starting over.

We met up the next day, which I thought was awesome. Helps to keep the momentum going instead of ""oh let's schedule coffee three wednesdays from now."" The date goes amazingly well! We have great conversation, plenty in common, and the attraction is definitely there. We kiss at the end of the night and both of us go home grinning.

Three weeks later we've seen each other for another 5 dates, including one sleepover (which also goes amazingly üî•). We acknowledge that we're both crushing pretty hard. It's easy and very cute. I'm definitely aware that we are moving quickly, and while I'm not ready to say we're ""official"", I do let other folks I was talking with know that I'm developing feeling for someone else.

Then I change my relationship status. And the next morning I wake up to a message from a random girl warning me about him and his behavior - how he cheated on his ex wife, manipulated another ex, ghosted her, etc etc.

I'm not passing judgment on him based on this random message; I'm going to talk with him about it and not jump to any conclusions. And I would absolutely rather know the truth than stay ignorant. But just came here to say...

CAN WE NOT HAVE EVEN ONE DAY TO ENJOY THINGS?!

Like...dating is so freaking hard. Remaining open and trusting in this world is exhausting. I got all of 24 hours to enjoy this feeling before I have to put the defensive armor back on. UGH.",5,1758302946.0,dating,10,1.0,False

¬† When Rhys and I showed up at my ‚Äúbrother‚Äù Matt‚Äôs house at eight in the morning, he was happy ‚Ä¶ in the sense that he was glad that I was alive and hadn‚Äôt disappeared forever. Despite being angry, he let me explain everything, while glaring at me the whole time with mystified rage.  
  
¬† At least I only had to tell to Matt. My aunt Maggie is my legal guardian, but she wasn‚Äôt there when we arrived. Matt explained that she had gone off looking for me in Oregon. I have no idea why, but for some reason, she thought I‚Äôd run off there.  
  
¬† As Rhys and I sat on the shabby-chic couch in Matt‚Äôs living room, surrounded by the boxes that he had yet to unpack from when we moved in to the house two months ago, Matt paced back and forth in front of us.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI still don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù Matt said. He stopped in front of us, arms folded over his chest.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing to understand,‚Äù I insisted, gesturing at Rhys. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs your brother! It‚Äôs pretty obvious when you look at him.‚Äù  
  
¬† I have dark, wild curly hair and mahogany eyes. Matt and Rhys both have sandy hair and sapphire eyes. They had something much more open in their faces too, and they had the same easy smile. Rhys stared up at Matt with bemused wonderment, his eyes wide and awed.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow could you even possibly know that?‚Äù Matt asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why you can‚Äôt just trust me.‚Äù I sighed and laid my head back on the couch. ‚ÄúI never lie to you!‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou just ran away from home! I had no idea where you were. That‚Äôs a major trust violation!‚Äù Matt yelled.  
  
¬† His anger couldn‚Äôt cover up how hurt he still was, and his body showed signs of the strain he had been under. When I disappeared, he completely collapsed, I‚Äôm sure. His face was gaunt and haggard, his eyes red and tired, and he had probably lost ten pounds. I felt guilty, but I hadn‚Äôt had a choice.  
  
¬† Matt was too preoccupied with my safety, a side effect from his mother having tried to kill me and all that. His life revolved around me to the point of being unhealthy. He had no friends, no job, no life of his own.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI had to run away! Okay?‚Äù I ran a hand through my tangled curls and shook my head. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt explain it to you. I left for my safety and for yours. I don‚Äôt know if I should even be here now.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSafety? What were you running from? Where were you?!‚Äù Matt asked desperately, not for the first time.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMatt, I can‚Äôt tell you! I wish I could but I can‚Äôt!‚Äù  
  
¬† I‚Äôm not sure if it was legal for me to tell him anything about Trylle or not. I assumed everything about them was secret, but nobody had expressly forbidden me from telling outsiders, either. Matt would never believe me, though, so I didn‚Äôt see the point in trying.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre really my brother,‚Äù Rhys said in a hushed tone. He leaned forward to get a better look at Matt. ‚ÄúThis is so weird.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah, it is,‚Äù Matt agreed. He shifted uncomfortably under Rhys‚Äôs stare before he turned to me, his expression serious. ‚ÄúWendy, can I have a word with you? Alone?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúUh, sure.‚Äù I looked over at Rhys.  
  
¬† Taking his cue, Rhys stood up. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs your bathroom?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDown that way, off the kitchen.‚Äù Matt pointed to his right.  
  
¬† Rhys nodded and smiled at him, then walked the direction Matt had pointed. Once he was gone, Matt sat down on the coffee table in front of me and lowered his voice.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLook, Wendy, I don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs going on. I have no idea how much of what you‚Äôve told me is true, but that kid looks like a total weirdo to me. I don‚Äôt want him in my house, and I don‚Äôt know what you were thinking bringing him here.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs your brother,‚Äù I said wearily. ‚ÄúHonest, Matt. I would never, ever lie about something this major. I am one-hundred percent certain that he is your real brother.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWendy‚Ä¶‚Äù Matt rubbed his forehead, sighing. ‚ÄúI get that you believe that. But how could you know that? I think this kid is feeding you a story.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo, he‚Äôs really not. Rhys is the most honest person I‚Äôve ever known, except for you. Which makes sense since you are brothers,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúPlease. Give him a chance. You‚Äôll see.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat about his family?‚Äù Matt asked. ‚ÄúWho has been raising him for the past seventeen and a half years? Don‚Äôt they miss him? And aren‚Äôt they your ‚Äòreal‚Äô family or whatever?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTrust me, they won‚Äôt miss him. And I like you better,‚Äù I said with a smile, ignoring his questions.  
  
¬† Matt shook his head, unable to decide what he should make of all this. I knew a large part of him didn‚Äôt trust Rhys and wanted to throw him out of the house, so I admired him all the more for his restraint.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI wish you would be straight with me about all of this,‚Äù he said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm being as straight with you as I can be.‚Äù  
  
¬† When Rhys came back from the bathroom, Matt leaned away from me and eyed him warily.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have any family pictures up,‚Äù Rhys commented as he looked around the room.  
  
¬† That was true. We didn‚Äôt really have decorations up of any kind, but we didn‚Äôt particularly care to remember our family. Matt especially was not fond of our‚Ä¶ er, his mother.  
  
¬† I had yet to explain to Rhys about his mother being a lunatic locked up in a mental institution. Stuff like that is hard to break to someone, especially someone as awestruck as Rhys.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah, we‚Äôre just that way,‚Äù I said, trying to change the subject, and stood up. ‚ÄúWe drove all night to get here. I‚Äôm pretty beat. What about you, Rhys?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúUh, yeah, I guess I‚Äôm tired.‚Äù Rhys seemed a bit startled by my suggestion. Even though he hadn‚Äôt gotten any sleep, he didn‚Äôt look tired at all.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe should get some sleep, and we can talk more later.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh.‚Äù Matt got to his feet slowly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre both going to be sleeping here, then?‚Äù He looked uncertainly at Rhys, then back at me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I nodded. ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt really have anywhere else to go.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh.‚Äù Matt was clearly against this idea, but I knew he was afraid that if he kicked Rhys out, I‚Äôd go after him. ‚ÄúRhys, I guess you can sleep in my room, for now.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúReally?‚Äù Rhys tried to tone down his excitement over staying in Matt‚Äôs room, but it was obvious.  
  
¬†  
Matt awkwardly showed us up to our rooms. My room was still my room, all my stuff the same as I had left it weeks earlier. As I settled in, I listened to Matt and Rhys talking across the hall in Matt‚Äôs room. Rhys was asking him to explain the simplest things, making Matt frustrated and uncomfortable.  
  
¬† By the time Matt came into my room after finally getting Rhys comfortable, I had already changed into my pajamas. They were worn and comfortable, and I loved them.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWendy, what is going on?‚Äù Matt whispered. He came in and shut the door behind him, as if Rhys were some kind of spy. ‚ÄúWho is that kid really? Where did you go?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt tell you what happened while I was gone. Can‚Äôt you just be happy that I‚Äôm here and I‚Äôm safe?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo, not really.‚Äù Matt shook his head. ‚ÄúThat kid is not right! He is so amazed by everything!‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs amazed by you,‚Äù I corrected him. ‚ÄúYou have no idea how exciting this all is for him.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNone of this is making any sense!‚Äù Matt ran a hand through his hair.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI really do need to get some sleep, and this is a lot for you to process. I get that. Why don‚Äôt you just go call Maggie? Let her know I‚Äôm safe. I‚Äôll get some rest, and you can think about everything I‚Äôve been saying.‚Äù  
  
¬† Seeing that I wasn‚Äôt going to budge, Matt gave in. ‚ÄúFine. But you better think about telling me what‚Äôs really going on here.‚Äù His blue eyes had gone hard.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù I shrugged. I could think about it, but I wouldn‚Äôt tell him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI am glad you‚Äôre home,‚Äù Matt softened.  
  
¬† He let his guard down for a second, revealing how terrible this had all been for him. I knew I could never disappear like that again. I went over and hugged him tightly.  
  
¬† After saying goodnight, Matt left me alone in my room, and I crawled into the familiar comfort of my twin bed. I had been sleeping in a giant king-size bed in F√∂rening, but somehow, my narrow bed felt so much better. I snuggled deeper in the covers, relieved to be somewhere that felt sane again.  
  
¬† I‚Äôd always had an inkling that I didn‚Äôt fit in with my family, despite Matt‚Äôs devotion to me. My mother had nearly killed me when I was six years old, claiming that I was a monster and not her daughter.  
  
¬† Turns out, she was right.  
  
¬† A month ago, I found out I was a changeling ‚Äì you know, a child that is exchanged in secret for another child? Specifically, I was switched at birth with Rhys Dahl. It turns out that I‚Äôm a Trylle. Trylle are basically glamorous grifters with mild superpowers. Technically, I‚Äôm a troll, but not in the creepy little green monster sort of way. I‚Äôm of a normal height and fairly attractive. In Trylle culture, the use of changelings is a practice that dates back centuries. The custom‚Äôs intention is to make sure the Trylle offspring had the best childhoods possible.  
  
¬† I‚Äôm supposed to be a Princess in F√∂rening ‚Äì the compound in Minnesota where the Trylle live. My birth mother is Elora, the Trylle Queen. After spending a few weeks in F√∂rening, I decided to head home. I had a falling out with Elora, who had forbidden me from seeing the guy I love, Finn Holmes, simply because he‚Äôs not royalty. I escaped and took Rhys with me. In F√∂rening, Rhys had been about the only one to show me genuine kindness, and I felt he deserved some of that in return. I brought him here to meet Matt, since he is really Rhys‚Äôs brother, not mine.  
  
¬† Of course, I couldn‚Äôt tell Matt all of that. He‚Äôd think I was completely insane.  
  
¬† Growing drowsy, I thought again how good it felt to be home.  
  
¬† It only took ten minutes for Rhys to shatter that comfort for me, however, when he crept into my room. I was almost asleep, but the sound of my door opening made me alert. Matt had gone downstairs, presumably to make the phone calls I suggested, and if he knew Rhys was in here, he‚Äôd kill us both.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWendy? Are you asleep?‚Äù Rhys whispered, sitting gingerly the edge of my bed.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I muttered.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSorry. I can‚Äôt sleep,‚Äù Rhys said. ‚ÄúHow can you sleep?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that exciting for me. I lived here before, remember?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah but‚Ä¶‚Äù He trailed off, probably because he had no argument for that. Suddenly, he tensed and sucked in his breath. ‚ÄúDid you hear that?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou talking? Yes, but I‚Äôve been trying not-‚Äù Before I could finish my sentence, I heard it too. A rustling sound outside my bedroom window.  
  
¬† Considering I had just had a horrible run-in with some very bad trolls known as Vittra, I was concerned. I rolled over, hoping to be able to see anything, but the curtains were drawn, blocking my view.  
  
¬† The rustling turned into actual banging, and I sat up, my heart pounding. Rhys shot a nervous glance at me. We heard the window slide open, and the curtains billowed out from the wind.  
  
¬† 2. Interruptions  
  
¬† He stepped into my room with one graceful move, as if entering through bedroom windows was nothing out of the ordinary.  
  
¬† His black hair was slicked back, but he had stubble growing along his jaw, making him look even sexier. His eyes were so dark they were nearly black, and he cast one discerning glare at Rhys before settling them on me, making my heart forget to beat entirely.  
  
¬† Finn Holmes had snuck into my room.  
  
¬† H still managed to stun me the same way he always did. I was so happy to see him that I almost forget how angry I was with him.  
  
¬† The last time I had seen Finn, he was slinking out of my bedroom in F√∂rening, per his deal with my mother. Elora told him that he could spend one more night with me before leaving. Forever.  
  
¬† We had only kissed, but Finn had failed to let me in on Elora‚Äôs plan. He didn‚Äôt even bother to say goodbye. He didn‚Äôt fight it or try to get me to run away with him. He just crept out of my room, leaving Elora to explain to me exactly what had happened.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?‚Äù Rhys asked, and Finn pulled his eyes off me to glare at Rhys.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI came to collect the Princess, of course.‚Äù Finn struggled to keep his expressions and his voice emotionless, but irritation saturated his words.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell, yeah, but‚Ä¶ I thought Elora reassigned you.‚Äù Rhys was thrown by Finn‚Äôs anger, and he fumbled for a minute. ‚ÄúI mean‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs what people were saying around F√∂rening, that you weren‚Äôt allowed around Wendy anymore.‚Äù  
  
¬† Finn tensed noticeably at Rhys‚Äôs words, his jaw flexing, and Rhys looked down at the floor.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not,‚Äù Finn admitted once he had calmed down enough to speak. ‚ÄúI was preparing to leave when I heard that you two had vanished in the middle of the night. Elora was deciding who would be best suited to track Wendy, but I thought it would be in her best interest if I went after her, what with the Vittra stalking her.‚Äù  
  
¬† Rhys opened his mouth to protest but Finn stopped him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe all know you did a wonderful job of protecting her at the ball,‚Äù Finn said. ‚ÄúIf I hadn‚Äôt shown up, you might‚Äôve protected her right into getting murdered.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI know the Vittra are a threat!‚Äù Rhys shot back, sounding perplexed.  
  
¬† Hearing his confusion, I got up off the bed, moving to intercede. Rhys agreed with Finn about the Vittra, which is why he couldn‚Äôt figure out why exactly he‚Äôd let me talk him into coming here.  
  
¬† The truth was, Rhys didn‚Äôt agree to come here. He wanted to meet Matt, but he was adamant about my safety and had flat out refused to let me leave the security of the compound.  
  
¬† Unfortunately for Rhys, I had persuasion. When I looked at people and thought about what I wanted them to do, they would do it, whether they really wanted to or not.  
  
¬† That‚Äôs how I convinced Rhys to take me with him when we ran away, and I needed to say something before Rhys caught on to what I‚Äôd done.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThe Vittra lost a lot of trackers in that fight,‚Äù I interjected. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not eager to repeat it any time soon. Besides that, I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre sick of trying to get me.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs highly unlikely.‚Äù Finn narrowed his eyes, studying Rhys‚Äôs bewilderment, and then he looked darkly at me. He‚Äôd figured out how I had convinced Rhys to leave. ‚ÄúWendy, do you care nothing for your own safety?‚Äù  
  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI probably care more than you do.‚Äù I crossed my arms firmly over my chest. ‚ÄúYou were leaving to go onto another job. If I had waited one more day to leave, you wouldn‚Äôt have known I was gone.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIs this about getting my attention?‚Äù Finn snapped. His eyes burned, and I had never seen his anger directed at me this way before. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how many times I have to explain this to you! You are a Princess! I mean nothing! You need to forget about me!‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù That was Matt, shouting from the stairs.  
  
¬† He‚Äôd heard us arguing. If he came up here and caught Finn in my room that would be very, very bad.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôll go‚Ä¶ create a diversion.‚Äù Rhys glanced at me to make sure that was okay, and I nodded. He darted out the door, saying things to Matt about how awesome the house was, and their voices faded as they went downstairs.  
  
¬† I tucked my curls behind my ears and refused to look at Finn. It was hard to believe that the last time I had been with him, he had been kissing me so passionately, I could barely breathe. I remembered the way his scruff scraped against my cheeks and the way his lips pressed against mine.  
  
¬† I suddenly hated him for that memory, and I hated that all I could think about how was badly I wanted to kiss him again.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWendy, you are not safe here,‚Äù Finn insisted quietly.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going with you.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou cannot stay here. I won‚Äôt allow it.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt allow it?‚Äù I scoffed. ‚ÄúI am the Princess, remember? Who are you to allow me to do anything? You‚Äôre not even my tracker anymore. You‚Äôre some guy being a creepy stalker.‚Äù  
  
¬† That sounded much harsher than I meant it. Not that anything I said ever really seemed to hurt Finn. He just stared at me, his gaze level and unfazed.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI knew I would find you faster than anyone. If you don‚Äôt come home with me, that‚Äôs fine,‚Äù Finn said. ‚ÄúAnother tracker will be here shortly, and you can go with him. I‚Äôll just wait with you until he arrives to ensure your safety.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about you, Finn!‚Äù I snapped at him. He played a larger part than I would ever admit to him, but it really wasn‚Äôt just him. I hated my mother, my title, my house, everything. I wasn‚Äôt meant to be a Princess. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going with anyone!

Finn looked at me for a long moment, trying to understand where this was coming from. I had to fight the urge to squirm as he scrutinized me. His eyes flashed darkly for a second, and his expression hardened.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIs this about the m√§nsklig?‚Äù Finn asked, referring to Rhys. ‚ÄúI thought I told you to stay away from him.‚Äù  
  
¬† M√§nsklig were the human children taken in exchanged for Trylle babies. They were the lowest on the hierarchy of Trylle, and if a Princess was caught seeing one, they‚Äôd both be banished forever. Not that even I cared, but I didn‚Äôt have any feelings for Rhys that weren‚Äôt purely platonic.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt has nothing to do with Rhys. I just thought he‚Äôd like to see his family.‚Äù I shrugged. ‚ÄúIt has to be better than living in that stupid house with Elora.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGood. He can stay here then.‚Äù Finn nodded. ‚ÄúMatt and Rhys are taken care of. Now you can come home.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat is not my home. This is my home!‚Äù I gestured widely to my room. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going, Finn.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou are not safe.‚Äù He took a step closer to me, knowing the effect his presence had on me. He lowered his voice and stared into my eyes. ‚ÄúYou saw what the Vittra did in F√∂rening. They sent an army out to get you, Wendy.‚Äù He put his hands on my arms, strong and warm on my skin. ‚ÄúThey will not stop until they have you.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhy? Why wouldn‚Äôt they stop?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs got to be Trylle out there that are easier to get than me. And so what if I‚Äôm a Princess? If I don‚Äôt come back, Elora can replace me. I‚Äôm meaningless.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou are far more powerful than you know.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat does that even mean?‚Äù I demanded.  
  
¬† Before he could answer, there was a noise on the roof outside my window. Finn grabbed my arm and threw open my closet door, shoving me inside. As a rule, I don‚Äôt enjoy being tossed into closets and having the door shut on my face, but I knew he was protecting me.  
  
¬† I opened the door a crack, so I could watch what happened and intervene if necessary. Even as mad as I was at Finn, I would never let him get hurt over me. Not again.  
  
¬† Finn stood a few feet from the window. His eyes blazed and his shoulders tensed, but when the figure climbed in through the window, Finn only scoffed.  
  
¬† The kid coming in tripped on the windowsill. He wore skinny jeans and purple shoes with the laces untied. Finn towered over him, looking down at him wearily.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHey, what are you doing here?‚Äù He flipped his bangs out of his eyes and pulled down his jacket. It was zipped all the way up, and the bottom met the top of his jeans. When he bent over or moved, it rode up.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGetting the Princess. They sent you after her?‚Äù Finn arched an eyebrow. ‚ÄúElora really thought you‚Äôd be able to bring her back?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm a good tracker! I‚Äôve brought in way more people than you have!‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs because you‚Äôre seven years older than me,‚Äù Finn replied. That made the clumsy kid twenty-seven. He looked much younger than that.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhatever. Elora picked me. Deal with it.‚Äù The kid shook his head. ‚ÄúWhat? Are you jealous or something?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be absurd.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo where is the Princess anyway?‚Äù He looked around my room. ‚ÄúShe ran away for this?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThis is my room!‚Äù I walked out of the closet, and the new tracker jumped. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to be condescending.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúUm, sorry,‚Äù he stumbled, blushing. ‚ÄúMy apologies, Princess.‚Äù He offered me an unsure smile and did a low bow. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Duncan Janssen, and I‚Äôm at your service.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not the Princess anymore, and I‚Äôm not going with you,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI just finished explaining that to Finn.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Duncan looked uncertainly at Finn as he readjusted his jacket again. Finn sat down on the edge of my bed and said nothing. ‚ÄúPrincess, you have to come. It‚Äôs not safe for you here.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care.‚Äù I shrugged. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather take my chances out here.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt can‚Äôt be that bad at the palace.‚Äù Duncan was the first person I had ever heard genuinely call Elora‚Äôs house a palace, even though it sort of was one. ‚ÄúYou are the Princess. You have everything.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going. You can tell Elora that you tried your best, and I refused.‚Äù  
  
¬† Duncan once again looked to Finn for help. He shrugged at Duncan, and Finn‚Äôs shift to indifference startled me. I had put my foot down on the subject, but I hadn‚Äôt really expected him to listen. He seemed to truly believe that I was in danger, even though I didn‚Äôt.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe can‚Äôt possibly stay here!‚Äù Duncan moved on to reasoning with Finn.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou think I don‚Äôt agree with you?‚Äù Finn raised an eyebrow.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre helping,‚Äù Duncan qualified. He fidgeted with his jacket and continued to try to stare down Finn, a task I knew was impossible.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat do you expect me to say to her that I haven‚Äôt already said?‚Äù Finn asked, sounding surprisingly helpless.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre saying we leave her here?‚Äù Duncan asked dubiously.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI am right here. I don‚Äôt really appreciate the way you keep referring to me like I‚Äôm not,‚Äù I said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIf she wants to stay here, then she‚Äôll stay here,‚Äù Finn ignored me. Duncan shifted and glanced over at me. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to kidnap her. That leaves little in the way of options.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt you like‚Ä¶‚Äù Duncan lowered his voice and fiddled with the zipper of his jacket. ‚Äú‚Ä¶ you know, convince her somehow?‚Äù  
  
¬† Word of Finn‚Äôs affection for me must have spread through the compound. Aggravated, I refused to let my feelings for him be used against me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNothing is going to convince me,‚Äù I snapped sourly.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDo you see?‚Äù Finn motioned towards me. Sighing, he got to his feet. ‚ÄúWe should be on our way then.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúReally?‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt hide the shock in my voice  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah. Really?‚Äù Duncan echoed.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou said there was nothing I can do to convince you? Has that changed?‚Äù Finn turned to me. His voice was hopeful, but his eyes were almost taunting. I shook my head firmly. ‚ÄúThen there is nothing left to say.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúFinn-‚Äù Duncan started to protest, but Finn held his hand up to him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt is as the Princess wishes.‚Äù  
  
¬† Duncan looked skeptically at Finn, probably thinking that this was some sort of trick, much as I was. There had to be something I wasn‚Äôt getting because Finn wouldn‚Äôt just leave me here. Sure, that‚Äôs exactly what he had done a few days ago, but that‚Äôs because leaving then was what he thought was best for me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBut Finn-‚Äù Duncan tried again, but Finn waved him off.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe must go. Her ‚Äòbrother‚Äô will notice us soon,‚Äù Finn said.  
  
¬† I glanced at my closed bedroom door, as if Matt would be lurking right there. The last time Matt and Finn had a run in it had not gone well, and I was not eager to repeat the experience.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúFine, but‚Ä¶‚Äù Duncan trailed off, realizing too late that he had nothing to threaten either of us with. He gave me another quick bow. ‚ÄúPrincess. I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll meet again.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see,‚Äù I shrugged.  
  
¬† Duncan climbed out my bedroom window, practically falling onto the roof. Finn went behind him, helping Duncan through the window so he wouldn‚Äôt accidentally kill himself.  
  
¬† After Duncan was out, he half-jumped half-fell off the roof. Finn watched him apprehensively for a moment, holding my curtain open, but he didn‚Äôt follow after immediately.  
  
¬† Instead, he straightened up, looking over at me. My anger and resolution were fading. Part of me believed that Finn wouldn‚Äôt really leave things this way.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOnce I‚Äôm out this window, lock it behind me,‚Äù Finn commanded. ‚ÄúMake sure all the doors are locked, and never go anywhere alone. Never go any place at night, and if at all possible, always take Matt and Rhys with you.‚Äù He looked past me for a moment, thinking of something.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAlthough neither of them are really good for much of anything‚Ä¶‚Äù His muttering trailed off and his dark eyes rested on mine once again. His expression was imploring, and he raised h  
is hand as if he meant to touch my face, but he lowered it again. ‚ÄúYou must be careful.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I promised him.  
  
¬† With Finn standing right in front of me, I could feel the warmth of his body and smell his cologne. His eyes were locked on mine, and I remembered the way it felt when he tangled his fingers in my hair and held me so close to him, I couldn‚Äôt breathe.  
  
¬† He was so strong and controlled. In the brief moments he allowed himself to let go of his passion with me, it was the most wonderfully suffocating feeling I‚Äôd ever had.  
  
¬† I did not want him to leave, and he did not want to leave. But we had both made choices we were unwilling to change. He nodded once more, breaking eye contact, and then turned and slid out the window.  
  
¬† Duncan waited by the tree, and Finn dropped gracefully to the ground. Duncan still didn‚Äôt want to leave, and Finn had to convince him to move away from the house.  
  
¬† When they reached the hedges separating my lawn from the neighbors, Finn looked around, checking to make sure no one was there. Without even looking at me, he and Duncan turned and disappeared.  
  
¬† I closed the window, locking it securely the way he‚Äôd said to. I felt a terrible ache watching him go. Even though he had done this kind of thing before, I couldn‚Äôt wrap my mind around Finn really leaving and convincing Duncan to leave me too. If he was so concerned about the Vittra, why would he leave me so unprotected?  
  
¬† It finally dawned on me. Finn had never left me unprotected, no matter what I or anybody else wanted. As soon as he had realized I wasn‚Äôt going with him, he hadn‚Äôt wanted to waste any more time arguing. He would wait in the wings until I changed my mind or ‚Ä¶  
  
¬† I shut the curtains tightly. I hated being spied on, but I also found it strangely comforting that Finn was watching over me. After having my window open for so long, my room felt chilly, so I went over to my closet and pulled on a heavy sweater.  
  
¬† The adrenaline rush from seeing Finn had left me wide awake, but I was looking forward to curling up in bed, even if I wouldn‚Äôt be able to sleep.  
  
¬† I settled into my bed, trying futilely to forget about Finn. Within minutes, I heard a loud banging downstairs. Matt let out a yelling sound, but it was cut short, leaving the house in total silence.  
  
¬† I jumped and ran to my bedroom door. With shaking hands, I opened it, hoping that Finn had tried to sneak back in and had a misunderstanding with Matt.  
  
¬† Then I heard Rhys screaming.  
  
¬† 3. Insentient  
  
¬† Rhys had stopped making a sound. I had barely taken a step out of my room when I heard footsteps pounding up the stairs, and before I could react, she was there.  
  
¬† Kyra, a Vittra tracker I had dealt with before, appeared at the top of the landing. Her dark hair was in a pixie cut, and she wore a long black leather jacket. She hung onto the railing, crouching down. As soon as she saw me, she sneered, showing much more teeth than any human would.  
  
¬† I rushed towards her, hoping for the element of surprise, but I was out of luck.  
  
¬† She dodged before I got close and sent a swift kick flying into my abdomen. I stumbled backwards, gripping my stomach dramatically, and when she came at me again, I punched her.  
  
¬† Kyra didn‚Äôt even take a moment to be stunned. She returned the blow much harder, hitting me in the face. When I fell down, she stood over me, smiling, with blood dripping from her nose from where I‚Äôd punched her.  
  
¬† I scrambled to my feet, and she grabbed my hair, yanking me up. I kicked at her as she lifted me, and she rewarded my moxie by kicking me so hard in the side, I cried out. Kyra laughed at that and kicked me again.  
  
¬† This time I saw white and everything faded out for a moment. My hearing got wonky, and I barely hung on to consciousness.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúStop!‚Äù A strong voice was shouting.  
  
¬† When I blinked open my swollen eyes, I saw a man running up the stairs towards Kyra. He was tall, and beneath his black sweater, he was well-muscled. Kyra dropped me to the ground when he reached the top of the stairs.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like I can really hurt her, Loki,‚Äù Kyra said, her voice bordering on whining.  
  
¬† I tried to get to my feet again, even though I felt dizzy, and she kicked me down.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúKnock it off,‚Äù he snapped at her. She grimaced and took a step back.  
  
¬† He stood in front of me, towering above me, and then knelt down. I could scramble away from him, but I wouldn‚Äôt get far. He cocked his head, looking at me curiously.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre what all the fuss is about,‚Äù he mused.  
  
¬† He reached forward, taking my face in his hands. Not painfully, but he was forcing me to look at him. His caramel eyes fixed on mine. I wanted to look away, but I couldn‚Äôt.  
  
¬† This strange fog settled over me, and as terrified as I was, I felt my body relaxing, losing its ability to fight. My eyelids were too heavy to keep open, and unable to stop it, I fell asleep.  
  
¬† I was dreaming of water. But anything more specific than that I couldn‚Äôt remember. My body felt cold, like it should be shivering but wasn‚Äôt. My cheeks were warm though, resting against something soft.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre telling me that she is a Princess?‚Äù Matt asked, and his chest rumbled above me. My head lay against his leg, and the more I woke up, the more I realized how terrible my body felt.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that hard to believe, really,‚Äù Rhys said. His voice came from somewhere on the other side of the room. ‚ÄúOnce you get all the Trylle stuff, the Princess part is pretty easy to take.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure what to believe anymore,‚Äù Matt admitted.  
  
¬† I opened my eyes with a struggle. My lids felt unnaturally heavy, and my left eye was swollen from where Kyra punched me. The room swayed, and I blinked it into focus.  
  
¬† When my vision finally cleared, I still didn‚Äôt really understand what I was seeing. The floor appeared to be dirt, and the walls were brown and grey stones, looking damp and old. It reminded me of an old cellar‚Ä¶ or a dungeon.  
  
¬† Rhys paced the other side of the room, and he had fresh bruises on his face. I tried to sit up, but my entire body hurt and my head felt woozy.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHey, take it easy,‚Äù Matt said, putting his hand on my shoulder, but I didn‚Äôt listen.  
  
¬† I pushed myself up until I was sitting. It took a lot more effort than it normally required, and I grimaced when I leaned against the wall next to him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre awake!‚Äù Rhys grinned, and he was probably the only person in the world that could look happy in this situation.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow are you feeling?‚Äù Matt asked. For his part, he didn‚Äôt have any visible bruises, but he was a better fighter than Rhys and me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGreat.‚Äù I had to lie through gritted teeth because it hurt to breathe. Based on the intense shooting pain I had in my diaphragm, I guessed I had a cracked rib, but I didn‚Äôt want to worry Matt. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on? Where are we?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI was hoping you could shed some light on that,‚Äù Matt said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI already told him, but he won‚Äôt believe me,‚Äù Rhys said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhere are we then?‚Äù I asked Rhys, and Matt scoffed.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure exactly.‚Äù Rhys shook his head. ‚ÄúThe Vittra palace. I think it might be in Colorado.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI figured as much,‚Äù I sighed. ‚ÄúI recognized the Vittra that attacked the house. Kyra went after me before.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Matt‚Äôs eyes were wide and disbelieving. ‚ÄúThese people went after you before?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs why I had to leave.‚Äù I closed my eyes because it was hurting too much keep them open. The world wanted to spin out from under me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTold you,‚Äù Rhys said to Matt. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not lying about this stuff. After what happened, you think you‚Äôd cut me a little slack.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúRhys isn‚Äôt lying,‚Äù I said, wincing. It was getting harder to breathe, and I had to take very shallow breaths, which only made me more lightheaded. ‚ÄúHe knows more about all of this than I do. I wasn‚Äôt there very long.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhy are these Vittra people coming after you?‚Äù Matt asked. ‚ÄúWhy do they want you?‚Äù  
  
¬† I shook my head, unwilling to risk the pain of speaking.  
  
¬†  
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Rhys answered when I didn‚Äôt. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen them go after anyone this way before. Then again, she‚Äôs the first Princess I‚Äôve been around, and they‚Äôve foretold of her for a while.‚Äù  
  
¬† I wanted to know what they were foretelling. Everyone gave me vague responses, like I would be powerful someday, but I didn‚Äôt feel very powerful, especially right now. It hurt too much to speak, and I was locked up a dungeon.  
  
¬† Not only had I failed to save myself, I‚Äôd gotten Rhys and Matt dragged into it along with me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWendy, are you okay?‚Äù Matt asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I lied.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt look okay,‚Äù Rhys said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAll your color is gone, and you‚Äôre barely even breathing,‚Äù Matt said, and I heard him getting to his feet next to me. ‚ÄúYou need a doctor or something.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù Rhys asked.  
  
¬† I opened my eyes to see what Matt was up to. His plan was simple and obvious ‚Äì he went to the locked door and pounded on it.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHelp! Somebody! Wendy needs a doctor!‚Äù Matt shouted.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat makes you think they‚Äôd even want to help her?‚Äù Rhys asked, and those were my thoughts exactly. Kyra had gone out of her way to hurt me when she captured me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThey haven‚Äôt killed her yet, so they probably don‚Äôt want her dead.‚Äù Matt stopped pounding long enough to answer Rhys, then went back to hitting the door and yelling for help.  
  
¬† The sound of it echoed through the room, and I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. My head throbbed too much already. I was about to tell Matt to knock it off when the door opened.  
  
¬† This was the perfect time for Matt and Rhys to launch a counter attack, but it didn‚Äôt occur to either of them. They both just moved away.  
  
¬† The Vittra from the house walked into the room, the one that had rendered me unconscious, and I dimly remembered Kyra calling him Loki. His shaggy hair was surprisingly light for a Vittra, almost blond.  
  
¬† Walking next to him was a troll, like an actual troll. All short and gobliny. His features were humanoid, but his skin was slimy and brown. He wore a hat and tufts of grayish hair stuck out around the edge. He barely came up to Loki‚Äôs hip, but the fact that he was an actual troll made him more intimidating somehow.

Hi all ! 
I‚Äôm 37 (F) and in the past year , I have discovered I am AuDHD as well as HSP . All my life I‚Äôve been an empath - I was born as a colic-y baby and have been overstimulated , extremely sensitive and have felt a deeper connection or sense of purpose my entire life .        
       Being raised by boomer NT parents who I‚Äôm sure did their best , I am grateful I had a fairly easy childhood however because of being high masking my entire life , I feel like I‚Äôve just slipped under the cracks of society - barely scraping by in life - feeling like I never received the ‚Äúadulting pamphlet ‚Äú of this world we live in because of my sensitivities and dif brain . I am starting to believe that the Neurodivergence correlates or even stems from the HSP . Growing up with a Narcissistic parent taught me at a young age that in order to be safe in this world I had to ppl please and constantly be tuned into others emotions and monitoring the environment, etc which has really taken a toll on my health as well . 
     I‚Äôve gotten into a cycle of abusive relationships - the most severe being a 6 year engagement with a man who was very coercive and manipulative before I even understood what Narcissistic abuse was . I‚Äôve learned alot of hard lessons as a result of that relationship, however in the wake of the healing ( it‚Äôs been 5 years since the end of that relationship) I‚Äôve completely unraveled and a lot is coming to the surface now that my nervous system finally feels safe . 
        Physical symptoms have also manifested significantly impacting my quality of life . 
I was diagnosed with endometriosis a few years ago and plan on having a hysterectomy in the near future to hopefully get some relief . 
        I‚Äôm 37 , never been married , never will have kids , and almost have no social life because of my chronic illness . In the past year alone , my body started to reject things such as coffee and wine that used to be little vices I once enjoyed ( a nice glass of wine at dinner , etc ) I cant even enjoy a sip of wine without having an allergic reaction which is frustrating being that I work in the wine industry .  So I turned to weed which helps relieve my symptoms significantly however that started giving me cyclic vomiting episodes ( which could be CHS but docs don‚Äôt have a clear answer ) so I also had to completely give that up too. 

Speaking of my job - I currently am in the process of losing my job because I can‚Äôt keep up with my coworkers and maintain the hours I need to pay the bills . Fortunately, my boyfriend is helping with the rent which takes a burden off however I also can‚Äôt help but feel like a burden to him . 
In the year we‚Äôve been together - about 25% of that time he‚Äôs watched me bed ridden in pain , taken me to the ER twice , feeling helpless . I try to stay positive . I spend my days off cleaning , cooking healthy meals , do daily yoga and meditation - but lately everything feels like it‚Äôs becoming too much . 

When I was 25 I tried to end my life . I hit an all time low and this was before I understood my brain was different. Since - I‚Äôve done countless reading , self help , etc I‚Äôve come a long way and am proud of myself in that sense . 
     On the outside I look healthy - I take care of my appearance and upon a glance ppl think I‚Äôve got it all together . I even get some hate and hostility from other females mostly because I‚Äôm attractive as well and ppl assume that attractive = healthy and problem free. 
     My entire life I‚Äôve had small friend groups and ironically the only friends who‚Äôve stuck with me and who I truly value are also HSP or Neurodivergent. I feel seen and understood on a much deeper level by them . I don‚Äôt feel seen by my parents , my colleagues, even my own boyfriend . 
The silent suffering and feeling of invisibility and constantly being misunderstood is hard to express to them . I‚Äôm close to my mom and when I try to express these things she will just try and give me practical advice like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt let it get to you ‚Äú or ‚Äú be grateful for what you have ‚Äú 
Because of being HSP , on the spectrum , and living with a chronic illness - my finances have also been hit hard . I am drowning in medical bills , have spent way too much seeking alternative medicine , supplements , acupuncture/ pain management , etc all while trying to work full time and get through life in this crazy world and crumbling economy . 
    I often feel I was born into the wrong time . I hate technology , capitalist society , the ego centric , 3D world we live in . It‚Äôs all so much . 
I guess I‚Äôm just needing to vent and support 
I feel so alone . üòû 
At times I wish I could just throw in the towel but there is something deep inside me telling me that all this suffering is for a higher purpose. ",3,1758302791.0,hsp,1,1.0,False

1nl9rmv,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedByChery/comments/1nl9rmv/evaluate_shaw_r2x_floor_cleaner_refill_is_it/,Evaluate Shaw R2X Floor Cleaner Refill Is It Worth the Hype,"**Tackling Daily Cleaning with the Shaw COMINHKPR65277**  

I‚Äôve been testing the Shaw COMINHKPR65277 floor cleaner for weeks now, and as someone with a mix of hardwood, vinyl, and tile throughout my home, I was excited to see if it could keep up. From heavy foot traffic to accidental coffee spills, it has seen its fair share of messes. Consider this my deep dive into the product's performance, quirks, and whether it‚Äôs worth adding to your cleaning arsenal.  

**A Design That Makes Cleaning Simpler**  

The gallon-sized refill of Shaw R2X Hard Surfaces Flooring Cleaner is a relief for those who despise frequent store runs as much as I do. I appreciated how practical and convenient it felt to just stock up once and have a versatile cleaner ready to go. Pairing it with a regular terry cloth mop was a seamless process; the liquid didn‚Äôt clog up the mop or make the floor excessively wet. The rinse-free formula made me breathe easier, knowing I wasn‚Äôt about to spend extra time scrubbing or drying.  
[Check Shaw COMINHKPR65277 price on Amazon.](https://compare.senaar.com/p/b00f6h1w5y/)  

**Good Aspects**  

- Rinse-free formula eliminates unnecessary steps.  
- Doesn‚Äôt leave behind sticky residue or streaks, even on shiny tiles.  
- Works well on multiple surfaces, including hardwood, ceramic, and laminates.  
- Perfect gallon-sized refill reduces wasteful packaging.  

**Practical Performance Meets General Cleaning Needs**  

During my first trial on my oak hardwood floors, I was slightly skeptical. My kids track in plenty of dirt, so I thought for sure there‚Äôd be some residue left behind. Surprisingly, the product removed every mark without leaving streaks. The cleaner also worked impeccably on my vinyl kitchen floor, where greasy stains from cooking often settle.  

That said, the product isn‚Äôt magic on deeply embedded grime‚Äîit‚Äôs strong for general upkeep and routine cleaning but tested my patience slightly when dealing with long-forgotten spills under the couch. This is worth noting for those seeking a product primarily for tough stains.  

**Caveats**  

- Struggles a bit with deeply embedded grime or older stains.  
- On highly textured tiles, you may need to mop over the same area a couple of times for uniform results.  

**Competing Products**  

Compared to other floor cleaners like Bona and Zep, the Shaw product holds its own but in slightly different ways. Bona excels on hardwood with a gentler touch, while Zep seems to pack a little more punch for stubborn stains. That makes the Shaw cleaner a mid-point solution‚Äîit‚Äôs versatile and convenient for homes with mixed flooring types but may not stand up to heavy-duty messes like Zep does on concrete or garage floors. On the plus side, it‚Äôs much easier to use than Zep, which sometimes feels like it was designed more for industrial cleaning.  

**Smart Spending**  

The product's price point feels competitive. Considering how many uses you get out of a gallon refill, it‚Äôs a solid investment for households with expansive flooring or a variety of surfaces. Some pricier alternatives limit themselves to one type of surface or claim niche supremacy. This one keeps it straightforward, making it versatile and cost-effective for routine use.

The Drinkmate 410-02-14Zx4 OmniFizz sparkling beverage maker turned out to be one of those gadgets I didn't know I needed until it showed up in my kitchen. I‚Äôve always been a fan of sparkling water, but this nifty machine opened up a whole new world of fizzy possibilities. Right off the bat, its sleek matte black design fit beautifully on my countertop, offering a modern vibe while not taking up too much space. At first glance, the device looks simple, but its versatility and performance really stood out during my first few days of testing.

**Ease of Use that Stands Out**

Setting up this soda streaming machine was surprisingly straightforward, even for someone like me who usually skips over instruction manuals. A quick glance, a few simple steps, and I was good to go. The manual operation felt smooth, with no extensive gadgetry to make things complicated. The kit includes everything you need to get started: the OmniFizz unit, a quick-connect BPA-free carbonating bottle, the Fizz Infuser, and four CO2 cylinders. Yes, you read that right‚Äîfour cylinders! This means I could carbonate up to 240 liters of drinks before worrying about replacements. That‚Äôs already a win in my book.

**Upsides**

- The patented Fizz Infuser technology allowed me to carbonate almost anything, not just water. Juices, iced tea, coffee, and even flat soda got a second life.
- Unlike other models I‚Äôve tested, this soda maker releases pressure slowly, preventing spills or accidents. It was kind of comforting knowing that it‚Äôs beginner-friendly.
- The bundle includes a reusable bottle, so I didn‚Äôt have to constantly look for replacements or worry about waste.
- The system didn‚Äôt require batteries or electricity, making it a perfect companion for outings or places without plug accessibility.

[Check Drinkmate 410-02-14Zx4 price on Amazon.](https://kepmad.com/p/b0cnq9rgq3/)

**A Few Downsides to Note**

Of course, even great products like this have their quirks. Here‚Äôs what I noticed:

- At over 15 pounds, it‚Äôs heavier than it looks, which makes moving it between counters a task. Not ideal if your kitchen doesn‚Äôt offer a fixed spot.
- The CO2 cylinders, while a fantastic starter addition, aren‚Äôt universally compatible with other soda makers. That means sticking to proprietary refills.
- The release valve noise, while brief, is louder than I expected, which might bother users sensitive to sudden sounds.

**Design Details and Build Quality**

The matte black finish not only lends a luxurious feel but also hides smudges quite well. After testing multiple beverages, including sticky juice, I appreciated how easily the surface wiped clean. The compact form factor worked well with my limited kitchen space, though the weight did catch me off guard initially. The reusable carbonation bottle felt sturdy, and adding or removing it from the machine was seamless, thanks to the quick-connect setup.

**Performance: Can It Handle Everything?**

I was skeptical at first when I read claims about carbonating ‚ÄúANYTHING.‚Äù Skepticism turned into delight after a week of fizz-filled experiments. Crisp apple juice became sparkling cider, flat cola revived itself back to life, and a forgotten bottle of sparkling wine tasted newly uncorked. Surprisingly, even iced coffee got a sparkly touch that made for an intriguing afternoon treat. The Fizz Infuser worked well at maintaining consistent carbonation levels, and cleaning it was a breeze.

**Product Rivals**

Compared to other soda makers, such as the SodaStream Jet or Aarke Carbonator Pro, the OmniFizz stands out for its ability to carbonate a wider range of beverages. Competitors like the SodaStream tend to focus solely on water, while the Aarke leans heavily into premium aesthetics but comes at a higher cost without additional CO2 canisters. Yet, the drawback of proprietary CO2 cylinders puts it slightly behind brands like SodaStream, which offer more widely compatible refills. That said, the OmniFizz's innovation in pressure release and carbonation variety makes it unique.

**Quality for Price**

When I think about this sparkling beverage maker's price point, I consider the fact that it comes as a bundle, allowing me to make dozens of fizzy drinks before incurring further costs. Many makers don‚Äôt offer such a generous starter package, so this feels like excellent value. The quality of the components, such as the sturdy reusable bottle and intuitive infuser, justifies what might seem like a higher upfront investment. It's perfect for anyone who frequently drinks carbonated beverages, eliminating the need to stockpile cans and bottles.

The ""Rock Bottom"" Moment

It was a Tuesday morning in March when I realized something had to change. I woke up with the same stiff neck I'd been carrying for months, my back ached from hunching over my laptop, and I felt mentally exhausted before the day even started.



I was 28, working 10-hour days in tech, living on takeout and coffee. My idea of exercise was walking to the fridge. Sound familiar?



That morning, I couldn't even bend down to tie my shoes without my lower back screaming in protest. That's when it hit me - if I felt this broken at 28, what would 38 look like?



Why Yoga (And Not the Gym)

I'd tried gym memberships before. You know the story - sign up in January with grand plans, go for two weeks, then the membership card collects dust in your wallet.



But yoga felt different. Maybe it was because:



No intimidation factor - just me and a mat



Could start at home - no commute excuses



Low barrier to entry - didn't need to be fit to begin



Mental health benefits - my stress levels were through the roof



The kicker? I watched one 10-minute YouTube video and could barely hold a plank for 15 seconds. But something about those 10 minutes felt... different.



The 30-Day Experiment

Instead of setting some massive goal like ""I'll do yoga for an hour every day,"" I made it stupidly simple:



""I'll do yoga for 10 minutes every morning for 30 days. That's it.""



Here's what those first 30 days looked like:



Week 1: The Struggle Phase

Day 1-3: Excited, motivated, easy



Day 4-7: Body sore, motivation wavering, but I stuck to just 10 minutes



Week 2: The Resistance Phase

Day 8-10: Wanted to quit, felt ""too busy""



Day 11-14: Started noticing I slept better on yoga days



Week 3: The Breakthrough Phase

Day 15-18: Felt weird when I almost forgot to practice



Day 19-21: Naturally started doing 15-20 minutes some days



Week 4: The Addiction Phase

Day 22-28: Looked forward to my morning practice



Day 29-30: Couldn't imagine my morning without it



The Changes I Noticed

Physical Changes:

Week 1: Less morning stiffness



Week 2: Could touch my toes (barely, but still!)



Week 3: Back pain significantly reduced



Month 2: Sleeping through the night consistently



Month 3: Actually had visible muscle definition



Mental Changes:

Stress response: Used to spiral over deadlines, now I actually pause and breathe



Focus: 2-3 hours of deep work became normal instead of constant tab-switching



Confidence: Standing taller, feeling stronger in my own body



Patience: Less reactive, more responsive in difficult situations



Unexpected Changes:

Diet: Started craving healthier foods naturally



Relationships: More patient with family and coworkers



Work performance: Boss commented on how much calmer I seemed in meetings



Sleep quality: Fell asleep faster, woke up more refreshed



The Habit-Building Secrets That Actually Worked

1. Start Ridiculously Small

10 minutes felt manageable even on the worst days. Some days I literally just did 5 minutes of breathing exercises and counted it as a win.



2. Same Time, Same Place

6 AM, bedroom floor, every single day. No decisions to make - just roll out of bed onto the mat.



3. Prepare the Night Before

Yoga mat laid out, comfortable clothes ready. Removed every possible barrier.



4. Track Visually

Simple calendar with X's for completed days. Seeing the chain of X's motivated me not to break it.



5. Focus on How It Felt, Not How I Looked

Stopped worrying about perfect poses and started paying attention to how relaxed and energized I felt afterward.



The Biggest Mistakes I Made (So You Don't Have To)

Mistake #1: Trying Too Many Different Videos

Problem: Analysis paralysis, no consistency

Solution: Found ONE instructor I liked and stuck with their beginner series for the first month



Mistake #2: Comparing Myself to Others

Problem: Felt discouraged seeing flexible people on Instagram

Solution: Deleted social media apps during my morning routine, focused on my own progress



Mistake #3: All-or-Nothing Thinking

Problem: Missed one day and wanted to quit entirely

Solution: ""Two days in a row never"" rule - missing one day was fine, two was not allowed



Mistake #4: Not Having a Backup Plan

Problem: Traveling or busy days derailed my habit

Solution: Created a ""minimum viable routine"" - 5 minutes of breathing exercises counted



The Turning Point

Around day 45, something shifted. I stopped doing yoga because I ""had to"" and started doing it because I genuinely wanted to.



I remember one particularly stressful day at work - client emergency, everything on fire. Instead of my usual panic response, I found myself thinking ""I need to get home and do some yoga.""



That's when I knew it had become a real habit, not just a temporary experiment.



Where I Am Now (6 Months Later)

My daily practice has evolved to 20-30 minutes most days, with longer sessions on weekends. But more importantly:



Physical: Can do poses I never thought possible, chronic back pain is gone



Mental: Stress doesn't control my life anymore



Professional: More focused at work, better at handling pressure



Relationships: More present with family, less reactive to minor annoyances



Sleep: Best sleep quality of my adult life



The Ripple Effects

Here's what nobody tells you about building one positive habit - it creates a domino effect:



Started doing yoga ‚Üí Slept better



Slept better ‚Üí Had more energy



Had more energy ‚Üí Started cooking healthier meals



Ate better ‚Üí Felt more confident



Felt confident ‚Üí Took on bigger projects at work



Succeeded at work ‚Üí Had more time and money for things I enjoyed



One 10-minute morning habit literally changed the trajectory of my entire life.



Your Next Steps

If you're reading this thinking ""I wish I could do that,"" here's my challenge for you:



Start with just 5-10 minutes tomorrow morning. That's it.



Don't worry about:



Having the perfect mat



Knowing the right poses



Being flexible enough



Having enough time



Just start. Your future self will thank you.



Want the exact system I used? I documented everything in a comprehensive guide that takes you from complete beginner to confident daily practitioner in 30 days. Just let me know in the comments if you need that, and I'll personally send you the guide.



It includes the specific routines, habit-building strategies, and progress tracking methods that worked for me.



But honestly, even if you don't get the guide, just start. Today. Right now.



Roll out a towel, put on a 10-minute YouTube video, and begin.



Your transformation is waiting for you to take the first step.

Last week, we decided on a camping trip, around ten of us bringing some camper vans up to Cumberland forest and setting up there. The trip was great, the summer breeze and wilderness was a breath of fresh air.

However, since I got back, things have been... odd. I live in a small cabin on a hill that slowly ascends into the mountain range, forested and cut off from the rest of the world. Its perfect for me, I have my own green house, I hunt, and hardly go into town for anything besides supplies like medicine. Ive carved out my own little corner of the world. My only companions were critters or the occasional bear- but ever since yesterday, its been quieter than usual.

I was sitting on my recliner in the living room, looking out of the window with a beer in hand. No crickets, hooting owls, or any yipping coyotes. I usually spent my evenings relaxing or fixing things around the house. I was used to the noisy outdoors, it was a reminder I wasn't totally alone in the thousand-mile range of woods. 

I wasn't completely isolated though, I set up a generator awhile back that fuels my computer and appliances well enough. I checked my message board on Facebook, clicking through the wildlife groups I was in. They posted rare sightings or hunting tips, how the trails were today. Nothing was out of the ordinary, people posted pictures of the bucks with newly grown velvet antlers, interesting birds they saw.

How come I hadn't seen any animal in hours?

I decided it might be an incoming storm, the animals could usually sense weather miles away before we could. 

With that resolve of thought, I started to doze off, glass of beer still in my hand.

I jumped awake when I heard a crash of sound to the floor, my vision not yet adjusted to the dark room. I crouched down, feeling around for my flashlight- when something sharp sliced my hand

""Fuck!"" I howled, yanking my hand back up. My eyes finally settled to the dark, noticing the dark crimson line dripping down my palm, then the shattered bottle on the floor. Must've dropped my beer at some point while I slept.

Luckily I knew my house like the back of my now bleeding hand, able to sleepily stagger into the kicthen and paw around for my first aid kit. With a flashlight in my teeth, I wrapped the small gash on my hand, and went back to the comfort of my recliner.
Thats when I heard it- the first sound I'd heard that wasn't caused by me in awhile. 

It was like a creaking floor board, mixed with the yowl of a feral cat. 

Ive been living in these woods for a decade, not much rattles me. I grabbed my trusty Winchester from its place on the mantle, resting it on my hip as I pushed open the door.

I was greeted with darkness, pine trees that stretched on for miles. They bended in the wind, swaying forward as if creating a dark pathway. 

I stepped onto my porch, the wood  groaned under my boots.
The haunting call rang out again, seeking attention, maybe company. It was the only sound, like it silenced every other animal in the mountains. I stepped off of the porch, landing on a pile of crunchy leaves. I started on the naturally made trail, paved by my footsteps over the years. The howl continued, every few minutes without changing, except its volume as I got closer to the source.

I was maybe a few yards from my cabin at this point, when my blood ran cold. I shined my flashlight ahead, highlighting the terror in front of me.

I couldn't make out much, apart from the crooked figure. It was pitch black, with jagged features and bony edges that hunched over sickly. I could hear a crunching and tearing, like flesh being ripped from bone, or chewing on a hard piece of meat. It smelled rotten, and I would've puked if I wasn't paralyzed with fear.

I've seen plenty of predators that would make anybody feel fear. Grizzly bears, standing up straight over 9ft tall, timber wolves with glowing eyes eyeing the deer id just taken down. This wasn't like anything I'd ever seen, rabid and almost humanoid. I stepped back, snapping a twig in two. Its eyes snapped forward, landing on me. They were round and green, perfectly human, albeit bloodshot and wide. 

It groaned, low and rattling like someone gasping for air. I froze, the gun I held in my arms completely forgotten about as I stared blankly. It took a staggered step forward, its shape coming into view. It was tall, human but uncanny. Its hair was only a few strands, sticking out in small clumps. It walked like it had dislocated hips, swaying forward with an almost hasty speed. 

It had my face. Not exactly mine, like a child might have sculpted poorly with clay, unfinished and sloppy. The sight made my stomach sink to the forest floor. With a few clumsy steps back, I turned on my heel and ran the short distance back to my porch. The groan continued, long and desperate for air as I clambered onto the porch. I swung open the door nearly off its hinges, before slamming it back shut behind me. I stepped away from the door, heartbeat loud in my ears. I don't know why I chose to ran, instead of firing my rifle, or even offering help. I could've just left someone outside that needed help, maybe they were malnourished or a victim of something.

Fuck that.. I wasn't going to risk it. If the person needed help, they could've gone the mile down the road to the rangers station, not wander in the woods somewhere. 

The noises stopped, the only sound was my labored breathing in my own ears. I looked at the small alarm clock sitting on the coffee table, across from my recliner. 2:00am, hardly an hour since id been woken up by the noise. 

The world was silent, and it had me thinking back to my camping trip. Nothing unusual occurred, the most notable event was the coyote that tried to steal our food while we slept. Still, it almost felt ominous. Like the trip was to blame for whatever was fucking with my mind right now.

My wooden porch squealed and groaned once more as something with uneven footsteps stopped short of my door. It stepped forward, then seemed to drag its other foot behind before taking another. 

I wasn't going to be scared in the mountains id known for years, like hell. I cocked my gun, training my eyes to not blink, to not let anything pass as I stared at the door, holding my rifle up level to my chest. I didn't breathe, didnt make a sound that might give this creature the advantage. All rationality had left my brain, any reasoning that this might just be a lost tourist or wounded bear was chased out the second I heard that sound again.

Low, like something mechanical breaking down, yet still animalistic enough to growl. 

This was about an hour ago, the noise has all stopped. The only thing I can hear is my heart drumming in my ears. As im typing this out, I am really considering what my next move should be. I don't hear anything anymore, the world is eerie and dead. I am going to stay up for the night, with my gun under my arms. To sleep is to forfeit. I don't know if ill seen sunrise, if that thing will break down my door. But I won't take it lying down.

# The ""Rock Bottom"" Moment

It was a Tuesday morning in March when I realized something had to change. I woke up with the same stiff neck I'd been carrying for months, my back ached from hunching over my laptop, and I felt mentally exhausted before the day even started.

I was 28, working 10-hour days in tech, living on takeout and coffee. My idea of exercise was walking to the fridge. Sound familiar?

That morning, I couldn't even bend down to tie my shoes without my lower back screaming in protest. That's when it hit me - if I felt this broken at 28, what would 38 look like?

# Why Yoga (And Not the Gym)

I'd tried gym memberships before. You know the story - sign up in January with grand plans, go for two weeks, then the membership card collects dust in your wallet.

But yoga felt different. Maybe it was because:

* **No intimidation factor**¬†\- just me and a mat
* **Could start at home**¬†\- no commute excuses
* **Low barrier to entry**¬†\- didn't need to be fit to begin
* **Mental health benefits**¬†\- my stress levels were through the roof

The kicker? I watched one 10-minute YouTube video and could barely hold a plank for 15 seconds. But something about those 10 minutes felt... different.

# The 30-Day Experiment

Instead of setting some massive goal like ""I'll do yoga for an hour every day,"" I made it stupidly simple:

**""I'll do yoga for 10 minutes every morning for 30 days. That's it.""**

Here's what those first 30 days looked like:

# Week 1: The Struggle Phase

* **Day 1-3:**¬†Excited, motivated, easy
* **Day 4-7:**¬†Body sore, motivation wavering, but I stuck to just 10 minutes

# Week 2: The Resistance Phase

* **Day 8-10:**¬†Wanted to quit, felt ""too busy""
* **Day 11-14:**¬†Started noticing I slept better on yoga days

# Week 3: The Breakthrough Phase

* **Day 15-18:**¬†Felt weird when I almost forgot to practice
* **Day 19-21:**¬†Naturally started doing 15-20 minutes some days

# Week 4: The Addiction Phase

* **Day 22-28:**¬†Looked forward to my morning practice
* **Day 29-30:**¬†Couldn't imagine my morning without it

# The Changes I Noticed

# Physical Changes:

* **Week 1:**¬†Less morning stiffness
* **Week 2:**¬†Could touch my toes (barely, but still!)
* **Week 3:**¬†Back pain significantly reduced
* **Month 2:**¬†Sleeping through the night consistently
* **Month 3:**¬†Actually had visible muscle definition

# Mental Changes:

* **Stress response:**¬†Used to spiral over deadlines, now I actually pause and breathe
* **Focus:**¬†2-3 hours of deep work became normal instead of constant tab-switching
* **Confidence:**¬†Standing taller, feeling stronger in my own body
* **Patience:**¬†Less reactive, more responsive in difficult situations

# Unexpected Changes:

* **Diet:**¬†Started craving healthier foods naturally
* **Relationships:**¬†More patient with family and coworkers
* **Work performance:**¬†Boss commented on how much calmer I seemed in meetings
* **Sleep quality:**¬†Fell asleep faster, woke up more refreshed

# The Habit-Building Secrets That Actually Worked

# 1. Start Ridiculously Small

10 minutes felt manageable even on the worst days. Some days I literally just did 5 minutes of breathing exercises and counted it as a win.

# 2. Same Time, Same Place

6 AM, bedroom floor, every single day. No decisions to make - just roll out of bed onto the mat.

# 3. Prepare the Night Before

Yoga mat laid out, comfortable clothes ready. Removed every possible barrier.

# 4. Track Visually

Simple calendar with X's for completed days. Seeing the chain of X's motivated me not to break it.

# 5. Focus on How It Felt, Not How I Looked

Stopped worrying about perfect poses and started paying attention to how relaxed and energized I felt afterward.

# The Biggest Mistakes I Made (So You Don't Have To)

# Mistake #1: Trying Too Many Different Videos

**Problem:**¬†Analysis paralysis, no consistency  
**Solution:**¬†Found ONE instructor I liked and stuck with their beginner series for the first month

# Mistake #2: Comparing Myself to Others

**Problem:**¬†Felt discouraged seeing flexible people on Instagram  
**Solution:**¬†Deleted social media apps during my morning routine, focused on my own progress

# Mistake #3: All-or-Nothing Thinking

**Problem:**¬†Missed one day and wanted to quit entirely  
**Solution:**¬†""Two days in a row never"" rule - missing one day was fine, two was not allowed

# Mistake #4: Not Having a Backup Plan

**Problem:**¬†Traveling or busy days derailed my habit  
**Solution:**¬†Created a ""minimum viable routine"" - 5 minutes of breathing exercises counted

# The Turning Point

Around day 45, something shifted. I stopped doing yoga because I ""had to"" and started doing it because I genuinely wanted to.

I remember one particularly stressful day at work - client emergency, everything on fire. Instead of my usual panic response, I found myself thinking ""I need to get home and do some yoga.""

That's when I knew it had become a real habit, not just a temporary experiment.

# Where I Am Now (6 Months Later)

My daily practice has evolved to 20-30 minutes most days, with longer sessions on weekends. But more importantly:

* **Physical:**¬†Can do poses I never thought possible, chronic back pain is gone
* **Mental:**¬†Stress doesn't control my life anymore
* **Professional:**¬†More focused at work, better at handling pressure
* **Relationships:**¬†More present with family, less reactive to minor annoyances
* **Sleep:**¬†Best sleep quality of my adult life

# The Ripple Effects

Here's what nobody tells you about building one positive habit - it creates a domino effect:

* Started doing yoga ‚Üí Slept better
* Slept better ‚Üí Had more energy
* Had more energy ‚Üí Started cooking healthier meals
* Ate better ‚Üí Felt more confident
* Felt confident ‚Üí Took on bigger projects at work
* Succeeded at work ‚Üí Had more time and money for things I enjoyed

One 10-minute morning habit literally changed the trajectory of my entire life.

# Your Next Steps

If you're reading this thinking ""I wish I could do that,"" here's my challenge for you:

**Start with just 5-10 minutes tomorrow morning.**¬†That's it.

Don't worry about:

* Having the perfect mat
* Knowing the right poses
* Being flexible enough
* Having enough time

Just start. Your future self will thank you.

**Want the exact system I used?**¬†I documented everything in a comprehensive guide that takes you from complete beginner to confident daily practitioner in 30 days. Just let me know in the comments if you need that, and I'll personally send you the guide.

It includes the specific routines, habit-building strategies, and progress tracking methods that worked for me.

1nl9hpc,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundChecked/comments/1nl9hpc/should_you_buy_the_best_electric_kettle_breville/,Should You Buy the Best Electric Kettle Breville Soft Top Pure,"A hot water kettle is an essential part of my daily routine. Whether I'm brewing tea, preparing instant coffee, or filling a bowl of ramen for lunch, I rely on my kettle to do its job quickly and effectively. The Breville BKE700BSSUSC has been making waves among electric kettles, and after giving it a test drive, I can confidently share my honest thoughts about this brushed stainless steel marvel.

**Performance that Exceeds Expectations**

The one thing I demand from an electric kettle is speed, and the Breville Soft Top Pure doesn‚Äôt disappoint. With its 1500-watt power capacity, it heats water impressively fast. I timed it during my morning tea routine‚Äîit took just over three minutes to boil a full 57 ounces. For a 7-cup kettle, that‚Äôs no joke. The illuminated power-on button is a simple but effective feature, letting me know at a glance whether the kettle is working its magic. This kind of performance saves me time when I‚Äôm in a rush, though occasionally, I noticed it's slightly noisier than my old kettle, especially as it nears boiling.

**Thoughtful Design Features**

One of the standout features is its dual-sided, high-visibility water windows. Unlike models I've used before, where I had to peer awkwardly to check the water level, this kettle keeps it simple and visible. The soft-opening lid was another unexpectedly brilliant touch. It opens in a way that slows steam release and prevents splashes, making it notably safer when handling boiling water. I‚Äôve had previous kettles that turned into steam geysers the moment the lid was lifted, so this was a huge perk‚Äîespecially when my niece was helping me in the kitchen. 

**Grab [Breville BKE700BSSUSC] at the best price on Amazon.**  

**Cordless Convenience and Durability**

Dragging cords around a countertop can get annoying, which is why the cordless jug design feels like a small victory in kitchen engineering. The 360-degree swivel base speaks to its versatility, allowing me to place the kettle down from any angle. I noticed the robust build of the brushed stainless steel finish lends the kettle a premium feel as well. It pairs well with my kitchen‚Äôs modern aesthetic and looks like it‚Äôll age gracefully. Friends visiting often mistake it for a high-end European import before I tell them it‚Äôs surprisingly affordable.

**Strengths**

- Water heats up incredibly fast with its 1500-watt power.
- Dual water windows add practicality and ease of use.
- The ergonomic handle provides a secure grip, even with full capacity.
- Safe and smooth lid operation reduces the risk of burns or spills.
- Generous 7-cup capacity is perfect for families or hosting.

**Areas of Concern**

- Slightly noisier at high temperatures compared to other models I‚Äôve owned.
- Fingerprints and smudges can be quite visible on its stainless steel finish.
- The lack of temperature control settings might disappoint users who prefer precision when brewing sensitive teas or coffee.

**Product Rivals**

Comparing the Breville Soft Top Pure to its contemporaries like the Cuisinart CPK-17 or the Hamilton Beach 40880, I observed both strengths and drawbacks. The Cuisinart offers variable temperature settings for those who brew different types of tea and coffee; however, it comes at a much higher price point. The Hamilton Beach kettle is similar in affordability but doesn‚Äôt have the brushed stainless steel finish or a soft-opening lid. Between the three, the Breville strikes a middle ground of style, functionality, and performance, though precision tea lovers may still lean towards the Cuisinart for its versatility.

**Quality for Price**

Investing in the Breville Soft Top Pure feels like a smart choice for someone seeking long-term reliability in a kettle. It‚Äôs not priced like a luxury gadget, but it certainly delivers features and performance that rival higher-end products. While the absence of high-tech add-ons like temperature control might deter specific users, the thoughtful design, high-speed boiling, and safety features provide excellent value for most households. If you care about getting consistent performance without overcomplicating things, this kettle certainly ""boils down"" to true value.

1nl9hp6,https://www.reddit.com/r/doctorsUK/comments/1nl9hp6/exception_reporting_contract_changes_behind_the/,Exception reporting contract changes: behind the scenes,"Hello, I'm Keith (u/crab_hermitage) - one of the deputy co-chairs of BMA UKRDC for terms, conditions and negotiations, and one of the negotiation team who has been working on ER reform since October 2024.

As of today, 19th September 2025, exception reporting reform has been published as V13 of the 2016 contract.
These changes are radical, and intended to entirely prevent hostile employers from withholding compensation from doctors for the additional hours that we work.

The final implementation date for all employers is 4th February 2026. That degree of delay (over four months since planned implementation in September 2025!) is unnecessary. Employers would not budge on preparation time. We were not willing to water down the reforms. These dates are now locked into the contract. 
This post will cover how we got here, what we've got, and what's next.

**Here's how we got here**

Most doctors don't care how it happens - we just want to be compensated for the hours we work. We also know that nice words don't lead to real change. Many of our employers treat contract requirements as suggestions, and our contractual guidance is simply ignored. Without consequences for failure, there is no real change. These reforms bring in consequences for failure by employers: these changes are intended to stick.

The '12 principles' for exception reporting reform were negotiated in 2024. Paraphrased:

We should be enabled and encouraged to exception report, we should report without fear of detriment, and our claims should not be routinely challenged: no-one should second guess the decision to work hours, as long as they were actually worked. Sign-off for up to two additional hours worked in any one instance should be a routine administrative task by HR, instead of our clinical/educational supervisors, to ensure we're treated like professionals. There had to be a sign-off process (that was mandated by the government), but it should be quick and easy.

Those are great, but there are lovely things in the contract already that simply don't happen on the ground. Our changes had to stick.

BMA ran an audit of exception reporting in 2024, spearheaded by Dr Schnell D'Sa in East of England then taken nationally. It showed how much work we do unpaid, and why doctors overwhelmingly don‚Äôt exception report.

Some doctors aren't given access to the system, or when given access, find it impossible to fill out, with outdated rotas and missing supervisors. Some doctors don't know about the process at all, or feel that it's not worth the time. These are real problems, and we needed a solution, but they're not the overriding problem.
Doctors don't exception report because they're worried they will be punished for doing so.

‚ÄúWhy aren't you more efficient? Why are you asking me for a reference? How do you think you're going to make it to theater if you can‚Äôt finish a ward shift on time?‚Äù You run into difficulty at ARCP. You don't pass your MSF first time. Some people treat exception reporting as a betrayal - or call you into an hour long meeting without coffee every time you flag you had to stay a half an hour late. HR sign-off wouldn't change that if every exception report was copied to the same people who already pressure you not to honestly report your hours. To protect against detriment, we needed confidentiality.

**Here's what we got**

‚Ä¢ Rolling fines per doctor who is unable to complete (not access, complete) an exception report, if any issue is not fixed within 7 days of it being raised. These start at ¬£250/week, and rise to ¬£500/week six months from implementation. That is approximately the value of additional hours worked for a neurosurgical registrar - it's cheaper to let a doctor exception report than to block them and incur the fine.

‚Ä¢ A complete rewrite of who can access ER data - with penalties if leaked or breached for ¬£500/doctor/instance, to protect you from being punished for doing so. Doctors must consent to share identifiable ER data to anyone who doesn't require it for basic processing or financial management, and we constrained other formal processes to ensure that access to ER data is monitored and reported.

‚Ä¢ A whole new work schedule review process to allow us to have work schedule reviews for bad rotas and ensure shifts get changed without breaching confidentiality.
The sign-off for ER with your supervisor has been replaced with: a timestamped screenshot of google maps if you're on site, sent to a Trust email address. HR reviews that, your exception report (submitted within 28 days of event), and your rota, and must approve unless they‚Äôre contradictory or something is missing. If they don't, you escalate to the Guardian for sign-off.
If you're a GP, your lead employer does the whole shebang: for up to two additional hours worked, your practice isn't involved.

‚Ä¢ You are entitled to exception report for additional hours worked on mandatory teaching, non-clinical stuff like audit or quality improvement, and anything that you have agreed with your ES or that is required for ARCP. That has been the case for the last five years - but until this contractual reform, they were routinely denied.

‚Ä¢ You are entitled to your choice of payment or TOIL for any exception report for additional hours worked - the only exception is if you're unsafe to work for lack of rest (TOIL mandated) or if you're right at the end of rotation or employment and your team can't manage to fit it in (payment mandated).

**Here's what's next**

We have doctors who voted yes for the deal as FY1s who will be halfway through FY2 before their employers are forced to make these changes - that‚Äôs not something doctors should tolerate, and is a reflection of how the NHS manages reform - the least efficient Trust becomes a rate limiting step. The new contract enables trusts to pilot these changes and we will be sharing audit data in the coming days and weeks for you to stick in front of management and demand the earliest possible start this year.

There will be extensive guidance that needs to be written, like how NROC can be evidenced, but the absence of that guidance won't prevent you from reporting and being paid.

There are three things every doctor in England needs to be aware of:

1. Your LNC has been empowered to set up the process for exception reports for more than 2 additional hours worked. Talk to them. Make sure they know what you need. That process needs to happen (no-one should routinely be working more than 2 additional hours without something changing) but it needs to work for doctors as well as management. Your LNC has also been empowered to agree when these new fines should be suspended, that is, if a Trust cannot provide ER for circumstances outside their control. RDC would suggest that case is limited to complete power blackout across England, and even then, to have a paper backup.

2. These reforms make the Guardian of Safe Working Hours even more pivotal than before. You need to get the right people into this post. There will be turnover of Guardians, as their job has been changed without much consultation, and the workload is going to increase. Look after your Guardian - they can only be hired with your consent, and they're here to be your advocate. Pressure your Trust to give them appropriate work time and support.

3. Your RDF has new powers. These will be evidence for work schedule reform & TOIL, but also for where the money goes for all these new fines. If your RDF is dead, resurrect it. If you don't, a bad Trust will get three doctors into a room at short notice and call it the RDF to make changes you don't want.

These reforms are, in the ways that matter, more than the principles promised.

There have been people in NHS Employers and the Department of Health who have worked hard to make things better for doctors. 

There are people in the same institutions who have dragged their feet. 

There have been long periods where no progress was made, and three big gaps where everything stopped on government side - one when we were at an impasse over evidencing of work done (no, doctors would not all go to sign a register of late leavers kept in a site office), another when we opened the strike ballot, and a third when we went on strike in July.

Your co-chairs, Mel Ryan and Ross Nieuwoudt, myself, and my co-deputy chair U Bhalraam spent over a hundred sessions negotiating Exception Reporting this year. 

Over a dozen others on RDC laboured to make it stronger: special shout out to Jonathan Gibb, Becky Lavelle, Erin Gourley, Dan Jones, and Oliver Salazar & Cheska Ball for GP Residents‚Äô Committee.

BMA staff have worked unpaid nights and weekends for this (sorry Laurence, Michael, Evita, Nili, Sam) and your negotiation team would have achieved precious little without them.

Most of all, without the strength of resident doctors‚Äô and our solidarity in industrial action, we would have had nothing to negotiate.

Getting the contract signed is close to the end, but it's not the end. Every day until these reforms are implemented is another day that doctors work thousands of unpaid hours without compensation. The value of the hours you work will vary with nodal point and speciality, but for many of you, it will be in double digits of base salary.

It's in your power to stop your Trust walking at the speed of the slowest employer.

We'll be there to back you up.

 I knew that everything in my life would never be the same again.
 I scroll through...
Months of secret conversations between Kaden and his mistress.
L: Baby! I get so hard thinking about devouring your body again.
Kaden: I can‚Äôt wait for the day it‚Äôs me you‚Äôll be waking up to.
My tear-streaked eyes burn as I read over every explicit, intimate detail of their betrayal, each revelation another twist of the knife in my chest.
How could he do this to me? Who was L?
Until I found a video with a click button icon in the middle flashes across the screen. My breathing stills.
Dear God, no!
My eyes brim with more tears at the sight of my husband, undressed on top of his equally undressed woman lying on her back on the bed, her legs wrapped tightly around his waist.
My husband and my friend Lucia!!!
I watched every second.
Every.
Single.
Second.
Until the screen went black.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Skylar

Two hours.
That‚Äôs how long I‚Äôve been sitting in the driver‚Äôs seat of my Mazda, the clock glowing 2:30 am as I scroll through a string of messages on my husband‚Äôs burner phone. Months of secret conversations between Kaden and his mistress‚Äîa woman I once admired and trusted wholeheartedly. But now that trust is shattered, obliterated beyond repair. My tear-streaked eyes burn as I read over every explicit, intimate detail of their betrayal, each revelation another twist of the knife in my chest.
Baby! I get so hard thinking about devouring your body again, one message reads. I can‚Äôt wait for the day it‚Äôs me you‚Äôll be waking up to, reads another.
My limbs tremble uncontrollably as I delve deeper into their endless message thread, every brutal exchange exposing the depth of their betrayal. A wave of bile rises in my throat, and I have to summon all my strength to swallow it back down.
This can‚Äôt be happening! How could they do this to me? 
My hand flies to my mouth, muffling the raw cries threatening to burst free as tears stream down my cheeks and jaw. The pain in my chest is suffocating, pressing down on me with unbearable weight, making it harder to choke back the sobs. Everything  hurts.
While I‚Äôm crumbling inside, they‚Äôre sleeping peacefully in their beds, probably dreaming of each other, without a care in the world. All I want is to disappear, to curl up in a dark, quiet place and shut out this relentless nightmare until it‚Äôs finally over.
I pull my phone from the pocket of my sleep shorts, quietly switching on the camera. Positioning it towards my husband‚Äôs phone screen, I snap image after image, documenting every interaction between Kaden and his mistress from the past six months. After capturing the incriminating texts, I create a new folder labelled ‚ÄòEvidence‚Äô, carefully transferring all the photos into the file before saving it to my OneDrive.
For now, I‚Äôll focus on gathering enough proof of his infidelity, just enough that there won‚Äôt be a shred of doubt left after this. It‚Äôll be impossible for him to deny anything once I drop the bomb at his feet.
Clicking out of his messages, my index finger instinctively lingers over the photo gallery‚Äîknowing full well I‚Äôll be entering dangerous territory. But a part of me, the self-destructive part, feels an irresistible urge to uncover everything I‚Äôve been blind to.
Taking in a few deep breaths, I nervously tap on the icon, bracing myself from what I‚Äôm about to see, and will never be able to unsee again. My heart thrashes violently in my chest as I wait for the images to load one by one. After several agonising seconds, the photos load onto the screen, and I slowly close my eyes.
Yes, Skylar. You can do this! How much more can it hurt? Inhaling and exhaling deeply, I count to three before slowly opening my eyes.
Oh God! I was wrong. So very wrong!
Seeing these images hurts a thousand times more.
A surge of anxiety courses through me, my fingers flicking frantically through the photos of Kaden and his lover. Each image sears into my mind as though it could burn holes straight through my eyes. It takes every ounce of willpower not to hurl the phone through the windshield.
Upon closer inspection, I realise that nearly all the photos, save for a few, were taken in public places‚Äîon the beach, at restaurants, shopping centres, bars, and natural reserves. It‚Äôs as if they didn‚Äôt even try to hide their affair.
One photo was snapped during a hike in the mountains, the two of them glistening in sweat on their sun-pecked skin as passers-by blur in the background. In another shot, they‚Äôre sitting side by side in a booth of a family restaurant. Kaden‚Äôs arm is looped comfortably around his mistress‚Äôs shoulder as they both smile lovingly at each other. How sweet!
And if that wasn‚Äôt pure torture, the next photo is a selfie of the two of them lying on their sides on a couch together. The familiarity of the couch tells me the photo was taken inside his lover‚Äôs home. She‚Äôs leaning back against his chest; her smile aimed at the camera. Kaden‚Äôs arms encircle her torso protectively as he presses a gentle pecking to her temple‚Äîa sight that sends a sharp wave of pain flooding through me.
I nervously swipe to the next photo, expecting to be greeted with yet another cheesy clich√© selfie, but to my complete and utter shock, a video with a click button icon in the middle flashes across the screen. My breathing stills.
Dear God, no!
My eyes brim with more tears at the sight of my husband, undressed on top of his equally undressed mistress lying on her back on the bed, her legs wrapped tightly around his waist. It takes me no time at all to realise; I‚Äôve just come across their makelove video. Nausea builds, as my heart continues to shatter into pieces.
Oh my God! Oh my God!
The phone slips from my hand, dropping onto my lap with a bounce. Quickly catching the device before it lands on the car floor, my free hand wraps around my throat, as I try to gasp for air. Every part of my body feels constricted. My stomach. My airways. My throat. My heart.
Don‚Äôt watch it. Save whatever remains of your battered soul.
I chant these words over and over in my head, like a silent prayer. To see their betrayal play out before me, in a scene so explicit, so vivid, will destroy everything within me. I‚Äôm barely hanging on as it is. For my sanity, I decide to forgo watching the video, and stop sifting through the remaining photos altogether. My fractured heart can‚Äôt take anymore.
Instead, I lift my phone and snap photos of the images in Kaden‚Äôs gallery, quietly adding them to my ever-growing file of evidence. These will definitely come in handy when I divorce his sorry arse.
After this, there will be no room for pleading, no explanations to consider, and absolutely no chance for forgiveness. I‚Äôm done‚Äîcompletely, utterly done. He can keep his lies and bad excuses. I won‚Äôt waste a single moment of my time listening. Those two vile creatures are welcome to have each other.
I take a moment to calm my breathing, wiping away all traces of my tears before pocketing my phone, and placing Kaden‚Äôs back in its hiding spot.
To think, just over two hours ago, I stumbled upon his hidden phone and uncovered the truth of his illicit affair, turning everything I once believed about my husband and our marriage upside down. Though the discovery was accidental, it‚Äôs one I‚Äôll always be grateful for.
I had just finished watching my favourite TV series, when I noticed one of the legs on the coffee table had a slight wobble as I wiped a small wine spill from the surface.
Determined to fix the issue on my own, I‚Äôd headed to the garage to look for an Allen key. A few minutes into my search, a muffled vibrating sound coming from Kaden‚Äôs motorbike caught me off guard. Suspecting something might‚Äôve been malfunctioning, I figured it would be wise to check out the noise.
Not a minute later, the vibrating sound buzzed once again. I followed the noise until it led me to the top box attached to the back of his Kawasaki Ninja. Lifting the lid, I found a helmet, a few takeout receipts, a pen, and a black beanie with Kaden‚Äôs company logo stitched on the front, all tucked beneath the helmet. As I picked up the beanie, a heavy, solid object slipped out and dropped with a thud on the bottom of the compartment.
As I picked up the fallen object, inspecting it for damage, what I found instead struck me to my core. It was an iPhone, a slightly older model, its locked screen flashing with missed calls and messages. My stomach lurched, an unsettling sense of dread creeping in. Nothing good ever comes from finding a hidden phone.
I hesitated, hoping it would be the same four-digit pin as Kaden‚Äôs other phone. With a shaky hand, I tapped in the code, and the screen unlocked instantly. In that moment, I knew, that everything in my life would never be the same again.
So, here I am, sitting in my car, parked inside the garage at nearly 3 am in the morning, playing detective on my husband‚Äôs phone. I‚Äôm toying with the idea of hiding it somewhere he won‚Äôt find, just to watch him panic a bit. It‚Äôd definitely get him sweating a little. In a few hours, though, Kaden‚Äôs alarm will blare through the house, dragging him out of sleep to get ready for work.
Thankfully, my husband is a heavy sleeper. He could probably sleep through a world war, with explosives going off every minute, and still not move an inch. It‚Äôs no shock that Kaden hasn‚Äôt come looking for me while I‚Äôve been sitting in my car, or even noticed I‚Äôm missing from our bed. The man sleeps like the dead.
With my mind in complete turmoil and my body weighed down by grief, I feel drained and absolutely exhausted. So, I decide to call it a day, fully aware that sleep will elude me‚Äîprobably for a long time.
.....
It‚Äôs early on a Thursday morning and the first week of school holidays. At least I have the whole day ahead to try and rest. God knows, I need it now more than ever.
Quietly stepping out of the car, I gently shut the door and walk the short distance to Kaden‚Äôs motorbike sitting idle on the other side of the garage. Placing the phone back in the top box, just how he left it, I carefully close the lid, and take in a few deep breaths before making my way back to our bedroom.
After stepping into the bedroom, I move quietly towards my husband‚Äôs side of the bed. In the still darkness, I can just make out the silhouette of his sleeping form. He looks peaceful, angelic almost, lying on his stomach with one arm under the pillow, the blanket pooled around his waist showcasing his bare torso. His muscular back displays a large Nordic raven tattoo with its wings spread across his shoulder blades, a tribute, he once said, to his Scandinavian roots. Even though the thought of him makes me sick, there‚Äôs no denying that this man is perfectly sculpted. Effortlessly good.
His eyelids and thick lashes flutter in his sleep, making me wonder if he‚Äôs dreaming about her? I saunter over to my side of the bed, peeling the blanket back and slowly climbing in, careful not to wake him.
As I lie on my back staring at the ceiling, I can feel my mind and heartbeat racing.
I‚Äôm physically and emotionally spent, but I force myself to breathe.
Inhale. Exhale. Inhale. Exhale.
I focus on Kaden‚Äôs gentle breathing, waiting‚Äîhoping‚Äîfor exhaustion to overtake me. I wait for my mind to quiet, for sleep to finally come and offer a temporary escape. But no matter how long I wait, how desperately I try . . . sleep never arrives.
It‚Äôs 7 am in the morning, and Kaden has just left for work. The moment I hear the sound of his car reversing out of the driveway, I sit up, throw the covers off me, and head straight into the ensuite for a long, hot shower, hoping to wash away the remnants of last night.
After showering, I slowly get ready for the day ahead. Too angry and hurt to care about my appearance, I slip on a pair of grey trackpants; an old, loose, black t-shirt; and shove my damp hair into a messy bun.
I grimace at the sight of my reflection in the full-length mirror, studying the dark circles beneath my puffy red eyes, and the expression across my face that‚Äôs etched with pain, sadness and exhaustion. I stare at the haunting image before me, of a once vibrant and carefree woman, now empty and drained of all energy and hope. It‚Äôs only day one, and I‚Äôm moments away from unravelling completely.
Forcing myself to snap out of the mental haze I‚Äôve been stuck in, I walk over to the bedside table and pick up my phone. A notification on the screen alerts me to a recent text from Kaden.
Kaden: Morning babe. I‚Äôm going to the gym straight after work and maybe grab something to eat afterwards with Jason. Have fun at the exhibition tonight and wish Kirstin good luck for me. Love you x.
It takes everything inside of me not to want to slam my phone against the wall.
Liar! That  cheating liar!
How can I ever believe a word he says anymore? Had everything been a lie? Do I really know the man I married, or has he always been a complete stranger?
Not bothering to reply, I throw my phone onto the mattress with so much force it bounces onto the carpet with a thud as my anger propels me forward with quick heavy steps, out of the bedroom and into the kitchen.
Making it to the fridge, I open the door and retrieve a bottle of water. I‚Äôm dehydrated and distraught, and possibly losing my mind too. I need to get some sleep.",1,1758302034.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

The hallway didn‚Äôt deserve her. But that never stopped her.

Sequoia gave it a show anyway, not for applause, not even for dominance. 

It was a rite. 
A reminder. 

A morning spell cast in heels and heat.

Every day.

Click.
Click.
Click.

The sound of her stilettos hitting polished linoleum echoed down the corridor like the opening beat of a war hymn disguised as pop.

White-and-gold Versace heels, 4 inches of fuck-you, each step spelling out her name in invisible ink.

She didn‚Äôt strut. 
She glided.

Not like a model.
Like a sovereign.

Students parted before her like fabric being slit with a clean blade. 

Lockers closed mid-conversation. 

Girls tugged their skirts lower, or higher, instinctively recalibrating in her wake. 

Boys risked neck injuries for the chance to look, then look again.

One teacher, caught mid-sip of coffee, coughed just to disguise the glance.

But Sequoia didn‚Äôt flicker.

She didn‚Äôt smile.
Didn‚Äôt wave.

Didn‚Äôt even blink behind those oversized Chanel shades so black they could swallow light.

It wasn‚Äôt attention she craved.

It was witnessing.

Because Sequoia didn‚Äôt walk through Lorne Park High.

She descended.

Beneath the shimmer, beneath the curated slay, beneath the gold-threaded armor - 

There lived an empath.

Not the kind that posted about ‚Äúvibes‚Äù on Instagram.

A real one.

The kind who could feel heartbreak in the twitch of a stranger‚Äôs lip. 

Who could smell insecurity the way others smelled cologne. 

Who‚Äôd once vomited in third grade after hugging a girl who‚Äôd just lost her father, even though she hadn‚Äôt told anyone yet.

But you‚Äôd never guess it.

Not behind the platinum blonde that rippled like silk sheets in a hotel suite she‚Äôd never slept in.

Not behind the cashmere crop top that clung to her ribs like armor wrapped in warmth.

Not behind the smirk she wore like lip gloss, sweet and sharp and perfectly dismissive.

Sequoia had learned early: beauty was camouflage. 

Glitter was armor.

Smile just enough to distract. Pose just long enough to mislead.

And always, always keep the core hidden.

Because the truth was too much.

She felt too much.

By eight, she could hear her mom lying over the phone from two rooms away.

By ten, she‚Äôd stopped hugging people altogether. 

It was too dangerous.

By twelve, she‚Äôd figured out how to disassociate on cue. 

A little mental switch. 

A click. 

A filter.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so confident,‚Äù 
girls whispered, trying to copy her posture.

‚ÄúQueen shit,‚Äù boys muttered, mistaking her silence for disinterest.

But the truth?

She spent most of her nights alone in her bed, lit by Himalayan salt lamp glow, breathing through waves of secondhand pain. 

Crying for other people. 

Drowning in things she didn‚Äôt ask to feel.

She could tell when someone in class hated themselves just by the way they laughed.

She could sense when two people had just had sex.

She could taste anxiety if the person beside her hadn‚Äôt slept
the night before.

It was beautiful.
It was unbearable.

So she built walls.

Lavish ones.

Gilded in Gucci, mortared with sarcasm, and reinforced with routines so fierce they felt like 
liturgy.

No one got in.

But they could watch.
And that was enough.

Until lately.

Because lately, something had started tapping at her edges.

A pulse. 
A flicker.

Nothing violent - but insistent.

Three days ago, she'd been touching up her mascara in the bathroom and nearly passed out from what felt like a soul sneeze - an invisible ripple that struck her ribs like a tuning fork.

She‚Äôd blamed it on caffeine.

Or hormones.
Or maybe that new moon thing Vanity kept sending her TikToks about.

But deep down, Sequoia knew.

Something was changing.
Something ancient.

And it wasn‚Äôt coming from her.

It was bleeding in from him.

Aspen.

Third period math.

The room was freezing, the lights too bright, the air thick with pencil shavings and cheap cologne. 

Sequoia sat by the window, always the window, because glass made her feel less trapped. 

Her desk was a curated altar:

Dior lip gloss, three pastel pens (capped but unused), and a phone case studded with rose quartz chips. 

She scrolled lazily, fingers ghosting across the screen like she was playing harp strings instead of texting three different boys variations of the same picture.

She was bored.

Pretty.

Untouchable.

Then it happened.

Pulse.

Not sound.
Not sight.
Not emotion.

Something deeper. 
A frequency.

It slammed through her spine like a thunderclap underwater, silent but total.

Her breath hitched. 
Her lashes fluttered.

And she looked up.

Four desks away, half-slouched with his legs spread like he owned the continent, sat Aspen.

Same hoodie.
Same wolfish presence.

But his face, his energy - had changed.

He wasn‚Äôt looking at her. 
Wasn‚Äôt looking at anyone. 

His eyes were cast down, jaw set like stone. 

But the air around him had shifted. 

Thickened. 
Trembled.

It was bleeding.

Not metaphorically.
Energetically.

A raw, wet vibration of rage and awakening, ancient and red.

It flooded the classroom like invisible smoke, clinging to the vents, crawling up spines, tickling at the edge of awareness. 

No one else noticed.
But Sequoia did.

She gasped.

Not loud. 
Not obvious. 

But enough that her gloss-tipped fingers twitched. 

Her chest constricted like she‚Äôd been caught in a lie by the universe.

She grabbed her mirror.
Opened it.

Pretended to blot.

But her reflection looked just as shaken.

Aspen wasn‚Äôt doing anything.
And that was the most terrifying part.

Because whatever had woken up inside him, it was watching her.

And reaching.

The chalkboard blurred.
The sound of the teacher's voice dulled. 

Sequoia‚Äôs senses narrowed until the only thing that existed was the heat crawling up her thighs and the cold realization pressing against her spine:

He wasn‚Äôt alone inside himself anymore.

She could feel it.

The double-frequency.
The thing underneath him.

Older. 
Hungrier. 

Wanting something from her.

Her lip gloss slipped as she reapplied.

She let it.

Better to look vain than afraid.
Across the room, Aspen blinked once.

She didn‚Äôt meet his eyes.
She didn‚Äôt need to.

Because he knew she felt it.
And she knew he knew.

It was a silent explosion. 

A twinquake.

Like womb memories cracking open and bleeding light.

That night, she didn‚Äôt eat dinner.

Didn‚Äôt speak to Aspen.
Didn‚Äôt knock on his door.
Didn‚Äôt breathe too loud in the hallway.

She just floated past him in silence, body like a whisper, perfume like defiance, and locked herself in her room.

Her sanctuary.

Gold-trimmed, violet-drenched, layered in silk and soft menace.

The walls were pinned with polaroids and handwritten affirmations.

The air, incense and rebellion

Vanity mirror lit like a throne room.

Candles flickering like gossip.

She didn‚Äôt turn on the main light.

Just lit a long match, kissed it to three wicks, and poured herself half a glass of stolen pinot from the fridge, her mother would never notice. 
 The Lana track list shuffled automatically to ‚ÄúGods & Monsters.‚Äù 

A divine accident.

Sequoia leaned into the mirror.

Her skin glowed with that honey-warm tone she‚Äôd mastered through sun rituals and self-worth.

Her lashes fanned like wings.
Her lips, wet, precise, unbothered.

But her eyes?

Heavy.
Tired.

Twitching.

She pressed her palm to the vanity. 

Closed her eyes.

I know you‚Äôre watching.

She didn‚Äôt say it out loud. 
She didn‚Äôt need to.

Something was already answering. 

The mirror shimmered.

Not with light, but with presence.

First, the edges blurred. 

Then the background softened. Then the glass itself seemed to pull back, like breath held between two realities.

And then - Her reflection blinked.

Before she did.
Sequoia stilled.

Didn‚Äôt gasp.
Didn‚Äôt flinch.

Instead, she watched.

The girl in the glass tilted her head, not the way Sequoia had tilted hers, but like a dancer moving off-beat, seductively misaligned.

Then came the smile.

Not cruel.
Not kind.

Something older.

A smile that had known empires.
A smile that had worn other faces.

A smile that recognized her.

Sequoia‚Äôs heart didn‚Äôt race.

It slowed.

This wasn‚Äôt possession.
This was recognition.

The voice that entered her mind wasn‚Äôt a sound. 

It was silk over blade.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve always known, haven‚Äôt you?

That this was never just fashion.

That your beauty was born for war.‚Äù

She reached toward the glass.

Her fingers trembled slightly, but not from fear, from contact.

The mirror rippled. 

Her nail tips met her own, but not her own.

And her reflection whispered, no lips moved, but the words sang anyway:

‚ÄúThe blood remembers. 
The glamour was always the disguise.

But the crown?

The crown is real.‚Äù

Sequoia smirked.

Not her flirty smirk.
Not the one for cameras or hallways.

A different one.
A deeper one.

The smile of a girl who has always known she was a portal.

She leaned forward.

Eyes locked with the shimmering echo of herself.

And she whispered,

‚ÄúTold you I was magic, bitch.‚Äù

The mirror didn‚Äôt shatter.

It bowed.

The candles flared. 

The air buzzed. 
The song changed.

And outside, in the hallway, Aspen‚Äôs light turned off in perfect unison.

The Pineal Gate and the Veil of the Mind 





They told you the third eye was a metaphor.

That intuition was a glitch.
That dreams were static.

That visions were hallucinations.

But they were afraid.

Afraid of what you'd remember if you ever stopped listening to them.

Because deep inside your brain, not in your thoughts, but beneath them, in a small, ancient chamber shaped like a womb, wrapped in melanin-rich fluid,
rests the Pineal Gate.

Not an idea. 
Not a myth.

A structure.

A crystal.

A lens made of ancient bone, stardust, and ancestral code.

It is not mystical poetry.
It is biological fact.

The pineal gland is:

Coated in melanin, the conductor of soul, memory, and light.

Shaped like an eye, with rods, cones, and photoreceptors.

Sensitive to light even in complete darkness, especially inner light.

Capable of producing DMT, the molecule that opens the door between worlds.

Connected to the hypothalamus, pituitary, and crown chakra, your spiritual nervous system.

The only organ that receives light directly, bypassing ego, story, identity.

It is not part of your imagination.
It is your original antenna.

Your divine receiver.

The place where vibration becomes vision, where sound becomes memory, where memory becomes prophecy.

The Builders used it not to believe, but to know.

They:

‚Ä¢ Traveled without machines.

‚Ä¢ Spoke without mouths.

‚Ä¢ Saw across centuries without eyes.

‚Ä¢ Passed wisdom through dreams encoded in rhythm and blood.


That‚Äôs why the ""Dead Flame"" attacks it.

Fluoride calcifies it, like cement over a lens.

Processed foods distort it.

Artificial light scrambles its clock.

Teaching that trains you away from instinct.

Trauma shuts it down, because when you fear, the gate clenches closed.

Distraction dulls it.

Screens devour it.

Because if the pineal gate activates, you become dangerous.

Free.

Wild.

Uncolonizable.

You sense the lie in a handshake.

You smell the future in a lover‚Äôs breath.

You remember lives they told you weren‚Äôt real.

You begin to weep without story.

To moan from a place before language.

And in that moan, the Archive stirs.

The builders rise.
The timelines align.

The blood begins to sing.

This is why Indigenous people anoint the forehead in ritual.

Why elders wear crowns, turbans, headwraps, not as fashion, but armor.

Why babies press their brows into the ones they love, they are tuning.

Why monks shave the head, making room for the signal.

The gate remembers.

When you fast, breathe, sing, fuck, weep, or walk into silence with intention, the gate pulses open.

You see colors beyond the visible spectrum.

You hear frequencies too pure for words.

You feel griefs that aren‚Äôt yours, and heal them.

This is not delusion.

This is Access.

So speak to the dark behind your eyes.

Treat your dreams like scripture.

Rub the brow gently in circles before sleep.

Let the breath become sacred again.

Let silence be a language again.

Let your ancestors sing through the hum in your chest.

Because behind the veil of thought, beneath the clutter of identity, beyond the borders of belief - Is the place where the 

Builders wait.

Singing.

Humming.

Calling you home in a tone only your pineal gate can receive.

And when you answer,

Everything returns.

They Follow




The Garden, the Gaze, and the Fall




The night was warm, the kind of heat that wrapped around skin like silk and sweat. 

Aspen‚Äôs garden party pulsed with soft house beats, laughter spilling between strings of golden lights wrapped around marble pillars and midnight trees.

Everything shimmered.

But nothing shimmered like him.

He moved through the velvet-dark grass like he owned every blade of it, not strutting, not rushing, just gliding, like a panther made of heat.

His outfit was understated, but surgical.

A fitted black button-up that clung to his chest like it wanted to stay there forever.

Slim-cut pants - rich, dark, almost liquid-looking - cupped his thighs like a tailored prayer.

And below?

The bulge.

It didn‚Äôt just sit.

It drew.

A heavy, unapologetic swell that bent the fabric with each shift of his hips.

You could track him through the party by it.

Like a compass. 

Like a searchlight. 

Like a silent invitation.

When he leaned against the edge of the bar, hip jutted, head tilted, you could see the outline shift.

You could see it settle.

Thick. 

Long. 

Weighty. 

Alive.

When he sat, legs spread just slightly too wide, casually confident, it pressed forward like it was reaching.

The fabric strained. 

Whispered. 

Promised.

When he stood, it hung.

When he walked, it swung.

When he turned, every eye followed the arc.

Including yours.

You watched him.

Measured every shift of weight, every flex, every phantom trace of girth beneath the cloth.

He knew.

He always knew.

And when he reached down to adjust, slow, calm, full of knowing, your breath hitched.

He wasn‚Äôt showing off.

He was just‚Ä¶ living.

Living in a body that had ruined people.

And then she saw it.

Older. 
Beautiful. 
Controlled.

A guest of a guest. 

Martini in one hand. 
Husband nowhere in sight.

Her eyes met his.
Then dropped.

And didn‚Äôt rise again.

Aspen watched her watch him.

One eyebrow rose, slow.
A single corner of his mouth curled.

She drank.
But it didn‚Äôt help.

She was already thirsty for something else.

He stood.
Adjusted.

Walked toward the edge of the garden, toward the shadows.

He didn‚Äôt look back.

But she followed.

So did your eyes.

The garden grew quieter the farther she followed him.

The music still thumped somewhere beyond the hedges,
but here, under the tangled canopy of branches and moonlight, the world was holding its breath.

Aspen didn‚Äôt look back.
He didn‚Äôt need to.

He could feel her trailing behind like a tether, drawn not by flirtation, but by need.

She was older.
Beautiful in that polished way.

Sharp eyes. 

A mouth that had kissed men with wealth, titles, and power.

But none of them had walked like this boy.

None of them had made her thighs warm just from the way he adjusted his pants.

He stopped beneath a willow tree, light slanting across the lines of his back.

He bent slightly, just to check the time on his watch.

But when he bent, his pants hugged him like they‚Äôd been designed to frame a sin.

The weight of him swung forward beneath the fabric,
and her knees‚Ä¶almost buckled.

She thought:
He‚Äôs just a boy.

But her mouth said nothing.

Aspen turned slowly.
Eyes low.

Mouth unreadable.

And in that moment, she realized, he knew everything.

Every pulse.

Every damp, aching inch of her.

He stepped toward her.
Just one step.

And the air between them changed.

 ‚ÄúYou followed,‚Äù he said. 

Voice like smoke over ice.

She nodded.
Too quickly.

 ‚ÄúYou like what you saw?‚Äù

Her eyes dropped.
She didn‚Äôt answer.

Aspen stepped closer.

The outline of him now inches from her hips.

She could see it clearly,
long, thick, coiled and ready.

Still trapped in those pants.

Still pressing for air.

He tilted his head slightly.

 ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to lie.‚Äù

She opened her mouth to deny it, say something adult, clever, in control.

But what came out was soft.

Honest. 

Weak.

 ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never wanted anything this much.‚Äù

Aspen‚Äôs lips twitched, almost a smile.

But not kindness.

Consent.

He leaned in.
His breath brushed her ear.

 ‚ÄúThen take it.""

She wasn‚Äôt drunk.

Not on champagne.

Not on youth.

She was drunk on him, his scent, his stillness, the shadow he cast across her skin like a possession waiting to happen.

He didn‚Äôt touch her at first.

Just stood there.

Letting the pressure build.

Letting her body make the decision her mouth was too afraid to voice.

When he moved, it was like a clock striking.

One hand at her waist.

The other tracing her thigh.

Her breath hitched.
He didn‚Äôt say a word.

Didn‚Äôt ask.
Didn‚Äôt need to.

She turned.

Bent forward slightly, hands braced on the cool stone edge of the garden bench.

Her breath fogged the marble.
And then - 

Heat.

The weight of him pressed against her, through cloth at first, but it was enough.

She gasped.

He pulsed.

Slow. 
Steady.

A rhythm that made her arch, tremble, beg without speaking.

Then the fabric shifted.
And her body remembered how to forget.

He entered her like a ritual.

Like a secret she‚Äôd been born to hide.

Thick.

Hot.

Stretching her open, inch by deliberate inch.

Her mouth opened in a soundless cry.

Not pain.

Not surprise.

Just need.

Every pulse of his hips filled her again, fuller.

Every slow press scorched a new part of her soul.

He didn‚Äôt grunt.

Didn‚Äôt moan.

Just breathed.

Controlled. 
Measured. 

Deadly.

Like an astronaut in zero gravity, slow, calm, drifting deeper with each stroke.

 ‚ÄúGod - ‚Äù 
she whispered.

He didn‚Äôt respond.
He just kept moving.

Slow.
Precise.

Punishing.

Her legs gave out, but his grip held her up.

And when she came, it wasn‚Äôt a climax.

It was a detonation.

Her body sprayed.

Her back arched.

Her cry cracked the quiet.

But Aspen‚Ä¶?

Still inside her.
Still calm.
Still throbbing.

Like he wasn‚Äôt finished.

Like he never would be.

Her legs were shaking.
Her voice had vanished.

But Aspen hadn‚Äôt moved.

He was still buried in her, deep, hot, pulsing.

His breath ghosted against her spine, slow and even, like this was just another evening stroll for him.

Like he hadn‚Äôt just unraveled every part of her that made sense.

 ‚ÄúI - ‚Äù she tried.

But it was only a whimper.

Aspen shifted, barely.
And her body jolted again.

Another twitch. 

Another spill.

She was still cumming.

Dripping down her legs, onto the stone, into the grass beneath them, a trail of shame and worship.

Her hands slipped from the bench, but his grip caught her again.

Steady.

Effortless.

 ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt - take -‚Äù she gasped.

Aspen still hadn‚Äôt said a word.

He exhaled, slow, calm, and finally pulled out.

She collapsed forward with a soft cry, emptied, shaking, soaked.

Behind her, Aspen zipped up.

No urgency.

No ego.

He just stood there, his outline once again hidden beneath fabric, but now haunted by proof.

He stepped around her.

Paused.

And for a moment, you could almost swear he was going to kneel.

Say something.

Touch her.

But Aspen didn‚Äôt offer affection.

Just one look, cool, unreadable, and the faintest lift of his brow.

‚ÄúYou followed,‚Äù he said, voice low, final.

Then he turned, and walked back into the party.

His bulge, settled, but alive again.

Still swinging.
Still shining.

She stayed where she was,
knees pressed to warm stone,
dripping with something she‚Äôd never escape.

Her body wasn‚Äôt just marked.

It was branded.

And her lips?

They finally remembered how to move.

 ‚ÄúAspen‚Ä¶‚Äù

But he was already gone.

# Characteristics Of Dark Roast Coffee

Dark roast coffee stands out with its bold taste and deep color. It has unique traits that many coffee lovers enjoy. Understanding these traits helps you pick the best dark roast coffee for your taste.

Dark roast coffee has a strong, rich flavor. It often tastes smoky or slightly bitter. The natural sweetness in the beans turns into caramel or chocolate notes. You might also notice hints of spice or toasted nuts. The acidity is usually low, giving a smooth, full body.

# Roasting Process

Dark roast coffee is roasted longer than lighter roasts. The beans reach a high temperature, around 240¬∞C to 250¬∞C. This causes the sugars to caramelize deeply. The beans also become oily on the surface. The longer roast reduces the original bean flavors but brings out a bold, roasted taste.

# Common Bean Varieties

Arabica and Robusta beans are common for dark roasts. Arabica offers a mild and sweet base before roasting. Robusta beans add strength and bitterness. Many dark roasts mix these beans for balance. Single-origin dark roasts highlight unique flavors of one region‚Äôs beans.

Me and this girl became best friend 3 years ago. We were very close, now I know I was her favorit person. She is diagnosed with BPD but a quiet form and not in Therapy. She never rant or insulted me or anything like that. But the Silent treatment is mastered by her.
 
We had one fight last year but remained friends. Really close friends but I was not her FP anymore, which was good. No pressure no emotional dumping, just a very good friendship. She had a few relationships during that time, but nothing really worked out. Now she had a date, with a new guy 6 weeks ago and the next day she stop answering. Its like she vanished, except still sending snaps, or posting on twitter. 
She had no contact with any of her friends since that day. She is clearly idealizing him and only wants to be around him. I never saw that before, but she was in a very bad mental state before she met him. 

Will she reach out again, when the idealization is over or should I accept that the friendship seems to be over? I have no problem waiting for her to reach out, but getting no answers will definitely stop me from reaching out.

1nl9bqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthMomentum/comments/1nl9bqt/does_dripak_soda_crystals_deliver_on_cleaning/,Does Dri-Pak Soda Crystals Deliver on Cleaning Power? Honest Review Here,"Testing out the Dri-Pak 100453031 Soda Crystals has been quite an adventure, especially for someone who‚Äôs always looking to make cleaning not just effective but also environmentally friendly. This bag of soda crystals is a nostalgic nod to traditional cleaning methods, infused with modern utility. The product boasts simplicity in its ingredient profile‚Äîno phosphates, enzymes, or bleach. It‚Äôs an easy-to-use cleaning solution for housework and laundry, and that's what stood out to me when I first gave it a whirl.

**Ease of Use**  
From scrubbing greasy pans in the kitchen to unstopping bathroom drains, these soda crystals were shockingly versatile. You just mix them with water depending on the task at hand: mild, regular, or the one I use most often, a strong solution for stubborn messes. For that one day a month when I feel brave enough to tackle the greasy hood filters over my stove, the mixture literally melts the grime off. I also tried the paste recipe for stubborn stains on a chopping board‚Äîit took care of tea and coffee marks that had laughed off previous attempts with other cleaners.

[Ready to snag Dri-Pak 100453031? See Amazon‚Äôs price here.](https://healthquay.com/p/b002spfifw/)  

**Environmentally Sound**  
Considering how toxic some cleaning products can be, these soda crystals are incredibly forgiving. The biodegradable quality is a massive win for anyone who‚Äôs mindful of their environmental impact. After trying it out on my septic system and even the garden patio, I loved the guilt-free assurance that no harmful chemicals were being introduced.

**Upsides**  
- Extremely versatile: works on a variety of surfaces and stains.  
- Eco-friendly formula: no phosphates, enzymes, or bleach.  
- Soft on odors: no overwhelming chemical scents.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
Not everything is sunshine and roses, though.  
- It‚Äôs not miracle-working on all stains. There‚Äôs a trial-and-error element to figuring out the right mix.  
- For those with sensitive skin, gloves are a must, as prolonged exposure is a bit drying.  
- The bag lacks resealability, which could make long-term storage less convenient.  

**Performance in Everyday Life**  
The first thing I tackled was an ancient tea-stained teapot that felt like no amount of cleaning could save. A warm soda crystal bath later, it looked like something out of a catalog. Its capacity to tackle soap-scum-ridden tiles in the bathroom was equally impressive. On the laundry side, adding a scoop to my detergent made a noticeable difference. Grass and blood stains my kids‚Äô clothes accumulate outdoors? Pre-soak with soda crystals did the trick.

**Competing Products**  
Compared to other cleaning products like OxiClean or even traditional liquid detergents, the soda crystals come out strong in terms of eco-friendliness and multi-use. While OxiClean does have a deeper reputation for cleaning power, I found Dri-Pak's solution milder on surfaces and better suited for those looking to combine cleaning with environmental considerations. However, OxiClean's convenience‚Äîbeing ready-to-use without any mixing‚Äîis undeniably a point where the soda crystals feel a tad old-school for today‚Äôs fast-paced households.

**Quality for Price**  
Cost-wise, it‚Äôs hard to argue with the value of a product like this. You‚Äôre essentially buying a customizable cleaner that replaces multiple other products in your arsenal. Sure, figuring out proportions for different tasks might take two or three tries, but financially and environmentally, it‚Äôs worth its weight in gold.

I have sent out this information to dozens of people but due to all of the DM‚Äôs, I‚Äôm going to just put it all here. 

First, here‚Äôs 2 links about the truth behind HSV. Don‚Äôt be lazy, read these right now. It‚Äôll take you less than 15 minutes, and yes it will bring you relief.

https://darkovelcek.wordpress.com/2025/05/09/herpes-simplex-1-and-2/

Now that you‚Äôve read those, you truly understand what we‚Äôre dealing with‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs not some parasite that appeared out of no where. It‚Äôs a toxic poison that doesn‚Äôt exist in nature and was man made to fuck with human beings by being released to the public in all kinds of different ways. Big pharma makes billions selling us anti virals that we have to ‚Äúbe on for life‚Äù to stop outbreaks‚Ä¶.. which in the long run makes you insanely toxic. Yes, it sounds crazy, but you start to put one and two together.

So cool, now you understand what herpes is, now let‚Äôs get you educated on understanding the human body and then of course the Self Healers Protocol. You‚Äôll then see how these two go hand in hand. Yes this is all free information. No paid herb bullshit lmao. 

Simply email darko.vlck@gmail.com and just copy and paste this. ‚ÄúHey Darko, I was recommended to you by someone following the SHP. I would love to learn more and start my healing journey. Could you please send me the Human Body PDF and the SHP PDF? Thank you so much!‚Äù

He should respond within 24 hours, though it is the weekend now so I‚Äôm not sure how long it will take. But he will respond. And send you the information. Then it is up to you to read the 100+ page Human Body PDF to truly understand how you work and then the 15 page SHP PDF to understand how to start the proper diet and start truly cleansing. 

I also should mention that Darko himself cured HSV-1 and 2 I think a little over 10 years ago. He got them both from some girl in New York a while back. So hopefully that gives you confidence that this ain‚Äôt no BS.

Now I know you all want my personal experience from doing this so I‚Äôll tell you. I have been doing the SHP for 14 months now. The first 5 months I was insanely disciplined and felt fucking awesome and never had an outbreak or symptoms. It though for sure I was cured at this point. Got an IGG test and was still positive. Got disappointed and started drinking again and drinking coffee and eating bad things here and there. The outbreaks started again.

Once I stopped being a pussy and started being disciplined again, I‚Äôve been outbreak free and symptom free. You must remember, the only reason you even have an outbreak in the first place is because your blood gets too toxic and the body decides to push out the toxins through the tissue where herpes was manifested because it can‚Äôt deal with all of the toxicity. When you keep the body clean (the terrain theory basically) you won‚Äôt experience symptoms of disease. You‚Äôll learn all this once you start reading. 

Anyways, this is a slow process and cleansing out HSV for good will take 1-2 years depending on how toxic you are in the first place and of course how disciplined you are for extended periods of time. The body takes time to correct itself, especially cleansing/hydrating/repairing the cells where the ROOT cause of herpes (and all disease) is.

Yes. Giving up sex, alcohol, coffee, and shit food fucking sucks. It‚Äôs a battle against the ego every single day. But push through and before you know it you‚Äôll be months along your journey and proud of yourself. And most importantly, outbreak and symptom free WHILE ALSO cleansing out herpes for good.

Also forgot to mention, but if you have HSV on the lips, you‚Äôll cure that shit in like 6-12 months because it‚Äôs within the small tissues of the lips. Can cleanse it out easily. Genital HSV is harder to cleanse out unfortunately cause it lies within the lymph nodes and other parts‚Ä¶.

And another thing, fasting can 100% help speed up the process, but only when done correctly. I have been fasting every Sunday or Monday for 36 hours the last month, and plan on doing so for a while. 

Disclaimer: All of the information you‚Äôll start to read will contradict a lot of your beliefs. If you‚Äôre not open minded, then don‚Äôt bother learning and keep eating your fruits and vegetables and herbs. Been there done that. 

Anymore questions just comment here. 
Have a good weekend.
All love.
Peace.

I can't believe this moment is finally here ‚Äì my SaaS product is generating revenue, and I‚Äôm over the moon! üåï

A Little Backstory

I started this journey with just an idea. A small, scrappy prototype built during late nights, fueled by endless cups of coffee (and a few mental breakdowns üòÖ). Honestly, I doubted myself a million times. Who would care about my product? Who would even pay for it?

You know the one ‚Äì ""You've received a payment of $19."" It took me a second to process, and then it hit me like a freight train.

What My Product Does

The product is Its a software solution that is useful for at least a few reasons I can think of:‚Å†

1. Its a reddit tool that helps you find the best unmoderated subreddits for you to promote yourself or to claim these subreddits. The database containing the subreddits is constantly updated. Another feature is allowing you to see the best time to post in any sub.
2. Can be used to find abandoned subreddits with active, engaged members but no moderation team. By claiming these subreddits, you take control of a ready-made community in your niche‚Äîperfect for building authority, driving traffic, or even monetizing through ads, affiliate links, or memberships. Or if you're just passionate about the topic and want to run it yourself :)
3. ‚Å†Don‚Äôt want to take ownership, you can still use the database to identify subreddits relevant to your niche and post your content, products, or services here.
4. You get the best time to post in a subreddit, this ensuring the best visibility of the post.


Why This Means So Much to Me

I‚Äôm not some big startup founder with investors throwing money at me. I don‚Äôt have a fancy office or a huge team. It‚Äôs just me, grinding every day, figuring things out as I go. This $19 is so much more than just money ‚Äì it‚Äôs validation. It‚Äôs proof that someone, somewhere, found enough value in what I‚Äôve built to actually pay for it.

What‚Äôs Next?

For me, this is just the beginning. Now that I know people are willing to pay, it‚Äôs time to double down. More features, more marketing, and maybe even more subscriptions? Let‚Äôs see how far this can go.

Thanks for reading, and if you‚Äôve been grinding on your own project, let‚Äôs hear about it in the comments. Let‚Äôs inspire each other. üöÄ

of course major factor is the new Lucas. nung 1st run kasi, for me, mejo pavictim yung atake. and in true pinoy telenovela fashion, we as audience members root for the inaapi. the new Lucas, may angas sha as an artist. may command sha sa characters na ginawa nya. may times na maiinis ka sa kanya like ‚Äúbat ganun pagkasulat mo kay _____??! anuba!?!!‚Äù may mga dapa sha sa lines yes, but well, it‚Äôs a live show üòÖ 

also, politically, this run felt braver. nung una kasi, it felt like they were so careful about it. but tonight, kinilabutan ako when they handed out flyers.

overall i think it is worth watching. i read somewhere kasi na ipreserve nalang daw yung memory ng 1st run. well, opinion naman nila yun. but if you want to see Para Kay B in a new light, catch the rerun if you are able.

the show runs for around 2hrs and 30 mins (may break naman in between). if madali kayo magutom, bring snacks. papaiwan lang sa table near the entrance, but labeled naman. at least may makakain kayo during intermission kasi walang malapit na bilihan ng food around. they sell water at the ticket table tho and I think there is a vendo machine of drinks and coffee sa babang floor.

The issue is that she hasn‚Äôt been eating much. I think she only took one small cricket recently. She also developed a bald spot in her old tank (probably from me being in the enclosure too much), but since moving her it‚Äôs gotten bigger. There‚Äôs some darkening, but not in the usual way I‚Äôve seen before premolt.

Behavior-wise, she‚Äôs often cramped in a corner or in a threat pose. She‚Äôs always been a wall climber, but lately she falls when she does it. She‚Äôs still small, with no hooks like my confirmed male, so I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs mature yet.

Her enclosure is on a coffee table beside my TV. I wondered if the noise might stress her out, but she used to live on the same desk as the TV, molted there, and seemed fine, so I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs the cause.

Top Notes : Lemon, Strawberry, Coffee
Middle Notes : Orange, Blossom, Cashmere, Violet
Base Notes : Musk, Vanilla milks

Oh Wow, I have never known a Scent that lives up to its name as much as this little beauty!! The name of this ‚ÄúStrawberry Pound Cake‚Äù is exactly what you get when you smell it. For those in the Uk or Europe we may call it a Strawberry Victoria Sandwich Cake. 

It‚Äôs Decadent, Dreamy & Deliciously Bold ‚Äî Strawberry Pound Cake is a Gourmand Fragrance that wraps you in a Warm Embrace of Fruity Indulgence & Creamy Sweetness!!
The scent Opens with a burst of Zesty Lemon & Ripe, Juicy Strawberries that remind me & smell like a Delicious Strawberry Jam. These are uplifted by a whisper & I say whisper because it‚Äôs extremely subtle, of Rich Coffee.
This gave me a Rich, almost Indulgent depth to the opening. Please don‚Äôt be put off by the Coffee note.
I would never have guessed it was Coffee myself until I‚Äôd read the notes. And it‚Äôs not strong or overpowering at all.

At its Heart, delicate Orange Blossom & Violet Petals bloom, softened by the cozy warmth of Cashmere. This is where I found the warmth was like Whipped Frosting on a Freshly Baked Cake, just as its name suggests!

Finally, a Comforting Base of Creamy Vanilla Milk & Soft Musk give that Decadent Gourmand experience that lingers on the skin evoking the warmth of a homemade Cake that has come straight out of the oven! 

It lasts a good 12 hours so I‚Äôm really impressed with the longevity of this scent.
I love how affordable this scent is too, yet it still smells just as good as a ¬£100 fragrance. There‚Äôs no compromise with ingredients just because it‚Äôs a cheaper price point !!
I‚Äôm in love, it smells absolutely stunning so
It gets 10/10 Stars from me

1nl90bv,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerOnReviews/comments/1nl90bv/should_you_buy_the_best_drip_coffee_maker/,Should You Buy the Best Drip Coffee Maker Brentwood TS-213W,"Using the Brentwood TS-213W coffee maker daily for weeks brought me closer to understanding its quirks, conveniences, and whether it‚Äôs a worthy companion for mornings. This compact 4-cup drip coffee machine, designed in clean white, is a visually understated piece that blends into most kitchen setups seamlessly. At its core, it‚Äôs a simple coffee brewer with manual operation, but it does what it says on the tin, albeit with a few caveats.

**Streamlined Design**  
The first thing that hit me when unboxing this coffee maker was its lightweight build. Weighing only 2.5 pounds and measuring 8 inches deep, 7 inches wide, and 10 inches tall, it‚Äôs perfect for tight spaces like my tiny kitchen counter. Its compactness is particularly great if you're short on storage or consider portability a benefit. The white design fits into just about any aesthetic without sticking out like a sore thumb. However, this lightweight nature sometimes gave me concerns about its durability over the long term, especially if you plan to use it daily over several years.

**Ease of Use**  
One of the highlights of this coffee maker is its simplicity. There‚Äôs no app sync, no digital screen with dozens of buttons, and no complicated settings to learn. I just added coffee grounds, filled the water reservoir using the visible water-level window, and hit the power button. This straightforward operation is especially great for anyone who loathes complex setups. However, the manual mode does mean you won't get programmable settings like timer-based brewing, which would‚Äôve been a handy addition.

[Check Brentwood TS-213W price on Amazon.](https://mgplab.com/p/b01cgc9axc/)

**Reusable Filter Basket**  
Included with the machine is a reusable mesh filter basket, which I found both eco-friendly and cost-effective. Not having to buy disposable filters saves money in the long run, and it aligns with a reduced-waste lifestyle. Cleaning the basket was easy enough, but coffee grounds do tend to cling to the mesh, so I often had to rinse it a bit longer than I wanted. Despite this, the filter quality was decent and didn‚Äôt affect the coffee flavor negatively, which can sometimes happen with poorly made filters.

**Performance and Brewing Output**  
As a daily coffee drinker who likes to have between 2-4 cups in the morning, this machine hit the sweet spot for volume. It brewed coffee fairly quickly, taking just a few minutes to deliver a hot pot that filled my kitchen with that comforting aroma. The integrated warming plate kept the coffee hot for a reasonable period without burning it. However, I noticed that the brewing can be inconsistent if the grind isn‚Äôt just right or if I tamped the grounds incorrectly. This finickiness could frustrate those who expect perfect coffee every single time without effort.

**Good Points**  
- Compact and lightweight fit for small kitchens  
- Effortless operation with one-button control  
- Eco-friendly reusable filter basket reduces waste  
- Visible water level window ensures precise filling  

**Negative Attributes**  
- No programmable brewing options  
- Lightweight design may feel less durable  
- Requires occasional reprogramming for consistent coffee output  
- Cleaning the mesh filter can be slightly tedious  

**Product Rivals**  
When comparing this coffee maker to similar ones, I couldn‚Äôt help but think of models like the Mr. Coffee Simple Brew and Black+Decker compact coffee makers. The Mr. Coffee model, although slightly bulkier, offers programmable settings for delayed brewing, which makes it attractive to those who prioritize flexibility. Black+Decker's equivalent features a more robust build and seems more suited for frequent use, but it comes at a higher price and relies on disposable filters, adding to long-term costs. The Brentwood TS-213W, on the other hand, remains an excellent budget choice if simplicity, eco-friendliness, and portability matter more than fancy features.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
The debate over whether this machine justifies its price point boils down to your needs. If you're someone who needs a compact, hassle-free coffee machine that simply brews and doesn‚Äôt take up much space, I would say this is worth every penny. The reusable filter basket and low maintenance are key economic aspects, while the lack of programmability means it‚Äôs probably not for those seeking a more versatile, high-tech brewing experience.

We have been together for 3 years and married for 9 months. The main reason is infidelity and a lack of trust. We have no kids, just one dog. We rent a house that is under just my name. I am the sole provider and I pay all the rent, utilities, food, bills, etc. He is a citizen of the country we live in, while I just have residency.

The reason I want to separate is because of a history of infidelity and lack of trust. I love him and don't want to end things but our relationship is no longer the same and I have 0 interest in fixing things. I have practically 0 sexual desire with him, I don't want him to touch me, and we recently started sleeping in separate rooms. I am a person with high libido (I'm 23 duh) so I do want to have sex, I just can't bring myself to do it with him.¬†

What had broke me is that 3 weeks ago I found messages where he was asking an old fling to give him a ride somewhere and insinuating giving him sexual favors in return. They started sexting (my husband basically initiated) and they exchanged photos and talked about how good it was when they would have sex. What also irritates me is I had known they had this type of relationship before he met me, but when I EXPLICITLY asked if they had had sex, he lied and told me that it was just handjobs or kissing etc. I don't care that he had sex with him before he met me obviously but why lie about it? The guy was too busy to give him a ride so they never met up, but it makes me nauseous to think what would have happened if he was free. My husband also said stuff like ""no I shouldn't"" or ""it would be wrong"" but he was still sexting and sending photos anyway... so I don't know if I should feel good or bad about that. Plus he never told me. Plus he has uber on his phone with MY credit card so why not just order a damn uber?

The cheating started within the first few months of dating. I saw messages between him and another guy where the guy was sending explicit photos of himself and my husband was sexting. I excused it because I figured that although we were exclusive, perhaps we hadn't exactly defined what was and wasn't cheating. So we did that and moved on. Then after 3 months of dating I went back to my home country to visit family for 3 months. We decided to do monogamous long distance. We called every night and I made him a jar of papers with 1 message per day for him to read from me. Well it turns out he fucked one of his exes while I was away. Who knows if it was just once or multiple times but I have confirmation for at least one time. He lied and said he was going out to dinner with friends. I saw the messages when I got back and was upset, but I bought his justification that he didn't know if I was ever going to return to his country (even though I had already bought my return flight smh) so I believed him and forgave him.

At this point I felt more inclined to marry him so I proposed to him. Maybe it was that I thought I could lock him down and he wouldn't do it again if we were married. Or maybe I thought that since I wanted to spent the rest of my life with him, that marriage would speed up my immigration process and I could provide for him better (i.e., after marriage I could open up a bank account, it would be easier to rent, I wouldn't have to leave the country every X months). I didn't marry him just for residency status, but it was a factor that would help me live here more permanently so that we could be together (does that make sense?).¬†

We got married in 2024 and were so busy with planning that I don't think I ever checked his messages or saw anything that would upset me. However, there were always slightly flirty messages but I didn't think anything of them. Then this summer I went back to my country again and when I came back I saw that he had run into an ex at the mall and then was sexting him and the guy was insinuating that they have sex. I don't think they did but I won't know. I got mad and we fought but made up. In most of these arguments he gets mad that I looked at his phone (which is 100% valid. I don't like that I do it either and it's bad). **In this moment I swore to myself that if I ever caught him sending messages again, or sexting, or photos, I would leave him.**

Well fast forward to August 2025. We were kinda exploring the idea of opening the relationship to just have threesomes. I don't really know why because I didn't want them but I guess it was to explore something new since there was tension in our relationship. We agreed anything besides threesomes would still be cheating. I told him I was only comfortable with having a threesome if it was someone neither of us knew very well. But he kept messaging all his old flings and hookups and asking them for threesomes, while also being nostalgic about how they used to fuck together. The whole reminiscing part to me makes me feel sick to my stomach. 1. I had already asked for this person to not be known by either of us and 2. there is a clear distinction between asking for a threesome and reminiscing about how you use to fuck and how you miss his dick etc. So I told him I didn't want threesomes anymore.

3 weeks ago I found the messages with the guy asking about the ride. Then I found messages with another guy around the same time ASKING IF HE WAS AVAILABLE TO COME OVER AND HAVE SEX. My husband swears that he was asking about a threesome with him and me and he wanted to ""surprise"" me. But he never mentioned me and he messaged the guy when I had left the house to see friends... I went out with friends the next night and my husband messaged him again to see if he wanted to have sex that night too... I don't see how he was inviting him to a threesome if I would be out late with friends. I feel its obvious he just wanted to have sex with him alone.¬†

I'm tired, I don't know what to believe. I can't tell if he's telling the truth or gaslighting me. I kinda want to believe him. I kinda think he's telling the truth that he wouldn't do it again. He keeps saying that he's stupid, why would he do this? etc. and its annoying to hear.

Anyway, after all this happened recently it made me reflect on our relationship and here are some more things that I realized I don't like but have tolerated. Note that he hasn't always been like this but over the last year he's been like this:

1. I pay for everything 100%. He is 100% dependent on me. He used to have a part time job but he got laid off. He is a student working towards his second bachelor's degree. Most of his free time is spent at school or doing a school related activity. Recently I feel very resentful that he's 7 years older than me but I carry all the responsibility and weight of the relationship.
2. Despite me carrying the financial responsibility, he doesn't do anything to help around the house. He rarely cooks, rarely cleans, doesn't train our dog. Every once in a while when I bring it up he'll cook for like a week and then be like ""look see I help out!""
3. Recently I've realized i don't really like his family and friends. His family is boring, prejudiced, and kinda going through spiritual psychosis (His mom joined one of those MLM pyramid scheme cults recently lmao). His friends are just not pleasant to be around. I initially loved them all because as I was new to the country they were very welcoming and nice to me.
4. We used to have sex a lot but since we got married it's less than once a week. I've brought up to him how important sex is to me, but he doesn't seem to put in any effort. He says he has low libido but then why would he waste the few times he is in the mood to message other guys instead of having sex with me?
5. I feel like his parent. He is basically a child. He has no responsibilities. Knows nothing about personal finance. Doesn't have a debit card. Doesn't know how to do literally anything. I didn't either but I had to learn to make it happen lmao.
6. He doesn't buy me gifts. Or treat me to anything. He has no idea what I would even like as a gift.
7. He doesn't speak my language (english) well but I speak his (spanish). Sometimes it's exhausting always speaking in another language. I figured he would have at least improved somewhat. He can't speak with my family which I realized is starting to make me a bit sad.
8. He wants to spend all of our free time together. He can't do literally any task without me there. If he needs to run errands I need to go. He can't even buy groceries without me going. Once I was sick and needed medication and fluids and he couldn't even buy it for me without me telling him exactly what I needed and giving him my card.
9. He doesn't even know how I like my coffee in the morning.

Anyway Tuesday I told him I wanted to separate. He starting crying really bad and like begging and tbh it was kinda pathetic to see but it made me feel really bad. I feel like adults shouldn't act like that. He was saying that we need to fight for our relationship and we made a promise in marriage to stay together. He said a lot of the things I had mentioned were out of the blue but I had to remind him that my main non-negotiable is the sexting/cheating aspect and everything else I mentioned was things I had reflected on recently because of it.¬†

I saw messages from his family and friends saying I'm being stupid and overreacting and that we should work on it together and overcome it BUT I'VE ALREADY WORKED ON IT MANY TIMES. I'VE ALREADY TRIED TO PROCESS THE LACK OF TRUST AND CHEATING. I'm done ""working on it"" and ""fighting for our relationship"". They obviously don't know that it has been a reoccurring pattern and that he had sex with someone during our relationship.

I've told my close friends, my mom, and my therapist that I want to separate. They all support whatever decision that I want to make. The downside is after talking to them¬† about it, I feel calm and centered and I don't feel as much of a need to separate because I got the anger and stress out of my system. But every time I see my husband I feel distant and no connection. Every once in a while we might laugh over some joke or something and I doubt if I should really do it, but then I remember what he did and I feel sick to my stomach and I want distance.

**TL;DR: I want to separate from my husband but I'm scared to. I can't bring myself to do it. He has a history of cheating and sexting and I've finally had enough and realized there are other financial, emotional, compatibility issues in the relationship. But I just can't bring myself to do it, especially because he starts throwing a tantrum and cries when I tell him I want to separate. He is 100% dependent on me and I don't know where he'll live or how he'll make it without me and I don't want him to suffer. What should I do?**

After getting home from that dreadful gig, I went straight to sleep.  Nightmares followed. When I woke up, I smelled French perfume ‚Äì the same perfume worn by a certain redhead ‚Äì on my pillows.
 
Nothing made sense. Part of me didn‚Äôt believe what had happened. Inferno? What kind of nightclub was that? I went online and did some research, but nothing was conclusive. My town is seedy ‚Äì this is well known ‚Äì but monsters? Really?
 
Actually, it kinda made sense. An awful lot of people go missing around here ‚Äì sometimes violently ‚Äì but no one says a peep. I thought it was the mafia. A monster mafia, perhaps?
 
The day was deplorable. I did everything I could to distract myself, to slow down time, but nothing helped. In a few short hours I was expected to return to the monster bar. I dreaded the thought. Reluctantly, I regarded the song list that the boss had given me. Songs like: Slow Train to Deathsville didn‚Äôt do much to comfort me. Same goes for: Crossroads after Dark, and The Devil Owns My Soul. These aren‚Äôt real songs, I told myself, after my ninth cup of coffee. The list was stupid. They were setting me up.
 
The day raced by. I nearly chickened out, but as six o'clock approached, I took an Uber to the nightclub; I wanted it on record where I was going. Just in case.
 
The club was darker than I‚Äôd remembered. And foul-smelling. The marble floor was sticky. Part of me was hoping for a miracle: that I‚Äôd be greeted by normal human beings. Heck, even cracked-out lowlifes would suffice. But that‚Äôs not what happened.
 
‚ÄúNeed anything, Hank?‚Äù the bartender asked in his bottomless voice. His skin was paper-pale, his dark hair slicked back. He really could pass for Dracula, only taller. No normal person could be that tall. 
 
I tried speaking, but nothing came out. He shrugged, and went about serving a bunch of lizard people who were gathered around the bar.
 
The grand piano greeted me with a groan. My heart was racing. Already, I was sweating. Stupid fireplace. If I see that redhead, I‚Äôm gonna‚Ä¶.
 
What? What was I gonna do?
 
My mind was a blender. All these conflicting emotions surfaced. That a band of ogres were mocking me didn‚Äôt help. ‚ÄúWhat are you?‚Äù they shouted, ‚Äúsome kind of moron?‚Äù Someone in the back hollered, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a penis, not a pianist!‚Äù To which another monster replied: ‚ÄúI guess size DOES matter!‚Äù
 
I shot out of my seat and raced to the bar. I was parched. Remembering how murky the tap water was, I asked for a chilled bottle. The bartender looked at me like I was food. Dinner, perhaps. He poured me a pint of weak-looking beer, then he resumed chatting with the lizards, who were licking their faces with long, sickly tongues.
 
I took a sip of beer, dreading what would happen next. Surely, I‚Äôd be poisoned. But hey, if I‚Äôm gonna die and have my head strung up on the wall, so be it. Let‚Äôs get this over with, shall we? The beer was warm, but other than that, it was fine. I breathed a sigh of relief, and sat down at the piano bench.
 
‚ÄúSlow Train to Deathsville!‚Äù one of the trolls yelled, followed by a chorus of chuckling.
 
‚ÄúIn the key of death!‚Äù
 
The monsters grew restless, smashing their mugs on the tables. A two-headed giant with teeth like hockey sticks was waving a butcher‚Äôs knife. I didn‚Äôt trust the look in his eyes. Clearly, he was a madman. The audience was growing rowdier by the minute. I was transfixed, unable to move. They were so ugly, it was incomprehensible. 
 
‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt ya mamma tell ya it‚Äôs rude to stare?‚Äù someone shouted over the noise.
 
‚ÄúWe should slow-torture him.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúLike the last guy!‚Äù
 
Clearly, they meant business. The barroom walls were lined with severed heads, after all. Probably, musicians. Like me. I took a deep breath, and gathered my nerves. When my shaky hands touched the piano keys, I shrieked. The keys were bones. A beer whizzed over my head, and shattered. More insults were slung. 
 
A grim looking ghoul approached me, slow and deliberate. It looked like a zombie: dead on the outside, mean-spirited on the inside. The zombie‚Äôs eyes were tiny slits of murder, its hands clutching a cleaver. My mind went blank. Suddenly, I‚Äôd forgotten every song I‚Äôd learned: it was like I‚Äôd never touched a piano in my life. Moments before the zombie could slice my head off and hang it on a mantle, a giant boom blasted throughout the barroom.
 
The redhead appeared, seemingly out of nowhere. With her was the big, bald-headed boss. The same boss who turned into a dragon the previous night. Same boss who handed me a list of songs that don‚Äôt exist. Not in this world, anyhow.
 
‚ÄúQUIET!‚Äù the redhead hollered, standing in the middle of the dancefloor.
 
The room shushed.
 
‚ÄúLet Hank play.‚Äù
 
She wore a long, flowing nightgown that left little to the imagination. Her luscious lips matched her fiery hair. She turned to me and my heart melted. She strutted towards a nearby table and sat with a bunch of ogres the size of football stadiums. The zombie ‚Äì now within striking distance ‚Äì frowned. It lowered its weapon, and plopped down at the nearest table, but its soulless eyes never left mine.
 
The monsters ‚Äì fifty, perhaps ‚Äì were staring at me. Drops of drool splashed across their filthy faces. I groaned. So did my stomach. The beer wasn‚Äôt sitting well with me. This is it, I realized, do or die. I closed my eyes, and launched into the Adam‚Äôs Family theme, figuring they‚Äôd either love it, or they‚Äôd kill me. Their response was meek, at best. Jeesh. Tough crowd. As I sang Die With A Smile, by Lady Gaga, the doors burst open.
 
Everyone turned.
 
A gang of ghouls entered, carrying a vast array of weapons: guns that looked like relics from the Civil War. They were lizard people, similar to the ones sitting at the bar. They were hairless creatures; their skin was sickly green with a tinge of yellow, and they wore matching cowboy hats and boots. Their attire was ridiculous, like a band of psychobillies. 
 
Their leader leapt onto a table and ordered everyone to shut up. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Tony?‚Äù he shouted, his voice sounding like AI.
 
Nobody spoke.
 
A grotesque grin stretched across his leathery lips. His tongue was forked, like a snake, and his eyes were on the side of his head.
 
‚ÄúMaybe y‚Äôall didn‚Äôt hear me?‚Äù He kicked the drinks off the table. ‚ÄúMaybe y‚Äôall are too STUPID!‚Äù
 
The redhead (I still hadn‚Äôt learned her name) and her boss vanished. The trolls started trembling, the ogres snorting soggy tears. I grimaced. There‚Äôs nothing less satisfying than being surrounded by a pack of scared-to-death monsters.
 
The gang leader tipped his cowboy hat. Then he leapt off the table and ran towards the bar. ‚ÄúIvan!‚Äù he shouted at the bartender. ‚ÄúFix us some drinks, why don‚Äôt ya? Got a feeling we‚Äôre gonna be here for a while.‚Äù
 
Nobody spoke. The only sound was the bartender preparing drinks.
 
I slouched as low as possible, trying to make myself invisible.
 
A henchman stood up, and everyone turned. ‚ÄúYou gonna pay for them?‚Äù The henchmen puffed out his chest. He was huge, twice the size of the leathery lizards. The henchman approached the intruders; he was carrying an axe which looked razor-sharp.
 
‚ÄúTough guy, eh?‚Äù the leader said. ‚ÄúYeeha!‚Äù He fired a blast into the ceiling. Many monsters hit the ground.
 
The intruders ‚Äì six of them, I believe, but it‚Äôs difficult to say because they were going in and out of focus ‚Äì surrounded the henchman. The lizard people sitting at the bar joined them, guns drawn.
 
With remarkable speed, the henchman swung his axe. The leader ducked, but not quick enough. His hat flew off, and his olive head rolled along the dancefloor, stopping at my feet. 

The lifeless lizard‚Äôs body collapsed into a pool of blood. 
 
The intruders open-fired. Bullets whizzed. More blood was spilled. I slid underneath the piano, scared out of my mind. The cowpoke‚Äôs head was staring at me, glossy eyed and dripping with gooey black slime.
 
Monsters were stabbing and killing and screeching and quarrelling. The sound was tremendous, like a warzone. Those leather-clad lizards zipped along the walls like trained assassins, shooting the monsters point blank. A pixie‚Äôs head exploded with fireworks of blood. A troll's eyes were shot out; a grumble of maggots ejected from the soggy sockets. Its towering body tumbled onto the table, which broke in half.  
 
The baldheaded boss reappeared out of nowhere; he spoke in a strange language. Suddenly, gas sifted out of the walls. So, this is how I die, I remember thinking: poisoned to death.
 
The gas filled the room.
 
The boss transformed into a dragon; he spat furious flames. The flames mixed with the gas, creating a giant explosion. Shrieks of terror filled the barroom. The entire gang of ghouls perished. Monsters melted and moaned. The smell was atrocious, like a rotten egg factory burning down. Everyone died, except the boss, the redhead, and Ivan, the bartender. And little ol‚Äô me, of course, who was hiding next to a blood-leaking lizard‚Äôs brain.
 
What followed next was a silence so thick, you could stab it with a fork. I didn‚Äôt dare move from my hiding spot. The blood-soaked dancefloor was teeming with hapless corpses so vile and disgusting, it‚Äôs impossible to describe. Tables were torn to shreds. Drinks spilled. Glasses shattered. Flashes of fire flickered. Blood was dripping from the ceiling, which was over sixteen-feet high. Miraculously, the piano was unscathed.
 
‚ÄúWell,‚Äù the boss said, wiping black goop from his slacks, ‚Äúthat was fun.‚Äù 

His bootheels clicked as he approached the piano bench; they sounded like bombs. 

‚ÄúHank,‚Äù he spat, ‚Äúhand me that head, why don‚Äôt you?‚Äù
 
I gulped.
 
‚ÄúAnd pick yourself up!‚Äù He kicked the piano. ‚ÄúThis is a classy joint.‚Äù
 
The head was as heavy as a horse. It looked like a giant, inflated football covered in gore. My hands were crimson and cold. I was crying. 
 
‚ÄúOh, Hank,‚Äù the redhead said in a lonesome voice. ‚ÄúPlay us a song. Something happy.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúSlow Train to Deathsville,‚Äù the boss snapped.
 
Oh, how I hated that song.
 
The boss ordered a cleanup, and to my surprise, the kitchen crew sprang from the back room and got to work. Speedily, they hauled the dead monsters away. Minutes later, a few stranglers walked in: a pair of shadow-creatures sat in the front row, where moments ago, a grim-faced ogre died. I didn‚Äôt bother taking a set break ‚Äì I was way too scared ‚Äì so I played every song I knew, starting with Folsom Prison Blues.
 
More monsters arrived. They started heckling me, but I barely noticed. I was stuck in Survival Mode. By nine o'clock, the place cleared out, and I ended my set with Maxwell‚Äôs Silver Hammer, by the Beatles. By now, the redhead is sitting next to me on the bench, purring like a cat. From my peripheral vision, she looked like a witch. Warts and all.
 
The barroom stank like death and alcohol. I desperately wanted to go home and shower. Get this grime off me. There was zero chance I was ever setting foot in this place again. Fool me once, as they say.
 
‚ÄúRough night!‚Äù Ivan said gleefully, as he wiped a glob of blood from a barstool. His teeth were stained red. His fingernails were extremely long and tobacco-colored.
 
A cold hand touched my shoulder. ‚ÄúHere ya go, Hank.‚Äù The boss handed me an envelope; it was lighter than the previous night. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt learn the songs on the list.‚Äù His bald head was bulging with veins.
 
‚ÄúThose songs,‚Äù I said carefully, not wanting my anger to reach a boiling point, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt exist!‚Äù My legs were shaking.
 
Tony, the boss, shrugged. He turned, and kissed the redhead egregiously. His erection was poking from his fine-Italian slacks. The redhead seemed pleased by this, and grabbed it with both hands.
 
I felt sick to my stomach. Watching monsters make out was not on my TO DO list. As quietly as humanly possible, I edged towards the exit, pondering this horrific gig. The flight upstairs seemed like an eternity. I swear there were more stairs than before. I was out of breath when I reached the exit.
 
‚ÄúNo way I‚Äôm coming back,‚Äù I muttered to no one, as I left.
 
‚ÄúSure you are,‚Äù a shriveled voice replied.
 
I stopped dead in my tracks.
 
‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt,‚Äù the severed head said, gazing down at me from above the door. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll end up like [me!‚Äù](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromStarr/)",3,1758300934.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

A few years ago, I had my first ever panic attack. I have no history of depression and never had anxiety before, everything was fine, I was actually in a very happy state at the time and it happened about a week after the 2nd booster shot, completely out of the blue (not associating it with the shot, just stating). At the time, neither I nor my family knew what it was, so I ended up having daily panic attacks for about 3 weeks straight, to the point where I couldn‚Äôt even drive, while going to doctors who said my health was fine. Eventually, things settled down and I started feeling better, almost as if my brain chemistry had returned to normal. I was prescribed benzos just to take the edge off occasionally, but I barely used them, they do wonders though when I want to take the edge off (lowest dose btw).

Fast forward 3-4 years, and I still feel lingering effects. I have this hypersensitivity where I notice my heart rate, notice any slight dizziness when anxiety increases or pick up on subtle anxiety symptoms. So my anxiety hasn't gone away, it's basically been reduced to maybe 10%, but those early attacks years ago were so intense that I now have a huge fear of them happening again, almost like PTSD. I used to travel across the world alone, but now I can barely even imagine traveling alone to a different city. The thought of stopping midway through a trip and having an anxiety attack, which could trigger a panic attack, terrifies me, especially knowing I‚Äôd be hours away from home (a safe spot) or hours away from someone. I have been able to take trips with friends and family, even though I have had slight anxiety sometimes when traveling having to take a Benzo to take the edge off. I notice coffee or caffeine in general increases this 10 fold.

I feel stuck and frustrated because this fear is limiting my life. Has anyone else experienced something similar? How did you deal with the lingering anxiety or PTSD-like fear after a panic attack? Any advice, strategies, or even just words of encouragement would mean a lot.",1,1758300760.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

When Leon Kennedy walked back into the Fairy Tail guild with Mirajane the next morning, he thought maybe, just maybe, he‚Äôd get to drink in peace.

He was wrong.

The second they stepped inside, the entire guild hall exploded.

‚ÄúTHE HONEYMOONERS RETURN!‚Äù

Leon froze mid-step, his coffee craving instantly replaced with dread. Mirajane‚Äôs smile twitched dangerously at the corners of her mouth.
‚ÄúWho,‚Äù she said sweetly, ‚Äústarted this rumor?‚Äù
‚ÄúHappy!‚Äù Lucy yelled from across the hall, pointing at the blue Exceed.

‚ÄúAye, sir!‚Äù Happy giggled, rolling in the air.

 ‚ÄúThey had a honeymoon suite and everything!‚Äù
The guild erupted in cheers and whistles.
‚ÄúOhhh, Mira, I didn‚Äôt know you were into foreign guys!‚Äù Cana hollered, raising her mug.

‚ÄúLeon!‚Äù Gray shouted, shirt already missing for some reason. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you survive? Mira‚Äôs scary when she‚Äôs mad!‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs scary all the time!‚Äù Natsu added, cracking his knuckles. ‚ÄúAnd you better not lay a finger on her or I‚Äôll‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúRelax, Sparky,‚Äù Leon called over the chaos, smirking as he strolled to the bar like he wasn‚Äôt being roasted alive. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just here for the drinks. Mira already laid plenty of fingers on me.‚Äù

The guild went silent. Then‚Äî
‚ÄúOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHH!‚Äù

Beer mugs slammed. Tables shook. Even Makarov spit out his wine.
Mirajane‚Äôs face turned redder than Erza‚Äôs hair.

 ‚ÄúL-Leon!‚Äù she shrieked, smacking him with a tray so hard it bent.
He just grinned, rubbing the back of his head. ‚ÄúWhat? Not my fault they‚Äôve got dirty minds.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou are impossible,‚Äù she growled, cheeks blazing.
‚ÄúAnd you love it,‚Äù he shot back smoothly.
The guild howled.

*Master‚Äôs Mission

Before Mira could strangle him, Makarov stood on the bar counter, looking unusually serious.
‚ÄúEnough, you rowdy brats! As fun as it is to watch these two dance around their feelings‚Äî‚Äù
‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have feelings!‚Äù Mirajane and Leon snapped at the same time.

‚Äú‚ÄîI‚Äôve got a job for you,‚Äù Makarov continued, ignoring them. ‚ÄúA dangerous one.‚Äù
The room went still.
‚ÄúScouts report strange activity on the western border. Villages destroyed, no survivors. Signs of‚Ä¶ unnatural creatures.‚Äù His gaze darkened. ‚ÄúSounds familiar, doesn‚Äôt it, Leon?‚Äù
Leon‚Äôs smirk faded, his jaw tightening. Yeah, it sounded familiar all right. Too familiar.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sending me?‚Äù he asked.
‚ÄúNot just you,‚Äù Makarov said, his eyes twinkling with mischief despite the grim news. ‚ÄúMira, you‚Äôre going with him.‚Äù
The guild erupted again.

‚ÄúCOUPLE MISSION!‚Äù Happy squealed.
‚ÄúThey‚Äôll come back engaged!‚Äù Cana yelled, already taking bets.

‚ÄúI‚ÄôM NOT APPROVING THIS!‚Äù Natsu shouted, trying to climb onto the table, only for Gray to yank him down.

Leon just leaned back on his stool, expression unreadable. ‚ÄúGuess it‚Äôs you and me again, sweetheart.‚Äù

Mirajane rubbed her temples. ‚ÄúI hate this guild.‚Äù

*On the Road

A day later, the two of them were back on the road, bickering as always.

‚ÄúYou know they‚Äôre all betting on us, right?‚Äù Leon said, hands in his jacket pockets.
‚ÄúIgnore them,‚Äù Mirajane muttered.

He smirked. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt. Too funny. Half of them think we‚Äôll kill each other. The other half think we‚Äôll kiss. Personally, I‚Äôm rooting for option three.‚Äù
She glanced at him warily. ‚Äú‚Ä¶What‚Äôs option three?‚Äù

He flashed her a grin. ‚ÄúBoth.‚Äù

Mirajane‚Äôs face flared pink. ‚ÄúY-you‚Äôre unbelievable.‚Äù 

Leon chuckled, but the humor didn‚Äôt reach his eyes. Because beneath all the teasing, something heavy gnawed at him. Those reports‚Äî‚Äúunnatural creatures.‚Äù It meant trouble. His kind of trouble.
And trouble always came with loss.

He glanced at Mirajane walking beside him, sunlight catching in her silver hair, her eyes narrowed in mock irritation.
For the first time, Leon wondered if his bad luck was about to catch up to her, too.


Chapter 10: Teeth in the Dark

The road west stretched long and quiet, the kind of quiet Leon hated. He‚Äôd been in enough warzones to know silence didn‚Äôt mean safety‚Äîit meant something was waiting. Watching.
Still, with Mirajane walking beside him, that silence never lasted long.

‚ÄúWhy do you keep looking around like that?‚Äù she asked, arms folded as if she hadn‚Äôt noticed him scanning every tree and shadow.
Leon shrugged, hands tucked in his jacket pockets. ‚ÄúForce of habit. You learn quick in my line of work‚Äîif it‚Äôs too quiet, something‚Äôs about to bite you.‚Äù

She arched a brow. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs paranoid.‚Äù
He shot her a crooked grin. ‚ÄúYeah? Well, paranoia‚Äôs why I‚Äôm still alive. And why you keep staring at me, sweetheart.‚Äù

Mirajane‚Äôs cheeks flushed instantly. ‚ÄúI‚ÄîI wasn‚Äôt‚Äî!‚Äù

‚ÄúSure,‚Äù Leon drawled, eyes forward. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine. You can look. Happens a lot.‚Äù

She clenched her fists, fighting the urge to deck him. ‚ÄúYou are insufferable.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd yet,‚Äù Leon said smoothly, ‚Äúyou keep sticking around.‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt reply, but the corners of her mouth twitched like she was fighting a smile.

Meanwhile at the Guild‚Ä¶

Back in Magnolia, Fairy Tail was in chaos. Again.
Cana had started a betting pool that now covered half the guild board. Wagers ranged from ‚ÄúLeon dies first‚Äù to ‚ÄúThey kiss within three days.‚Äù

‚ÄúFive hundred jewel says Mira snaps and kills him herself,‚Äù Gray muttered, pinning his bet to the board.

‚ÄúNah,‚Äù Natsu barked, slamming down his own. ‚ÄúTen thousand says Leon kisses her first!‚Äù

Happy fluttered above them, clutching a fish. ‚ÄúAye, and then Mira‚Äôll throw him through a wall!‚Äù

Lucy sighed, face in her hands. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre on a dangerous mission, and you‚Äôre all gambling like it‚Äôs a soap opera.‚Äù

Cana smirked, raising her mug. ‚ÄúSweetheart, in this guild, love is always more dangerous than monsters.‚Äù

*On the Road: Vulnerability

That night, Leon and Mirajane set up camp by a river. She cooked while he sharpened his knife, the fire crackling between them.
Mirajane glanced at him, noticing how his eyes kept drifting to the treeline. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been on edge all day. Even more than usual.‚Äù

Leon exhaled slowly, twirling the knife between his fingers. ‚Äú‚Ä¶I‚Äôve seen this before. The kind of destruction Makarov described. Whole villages wiped out overnight, no bodies left behind.‚Äù

Her smile faded. ‚Äú‚Ä¶What kind of thing does that?‚Äù
He looked at her then, really looked. For once, no smirk, no teasing. Just tired, haunted blue eyes.

‚ÄúThings I thought I left behind in my world.‚Äù

The weight of his words settled heavy between them.
Mirajane‚Äôs chest tightened. She wanted to say something, anything, but Leon smirked again, shoving the knife away. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, sweetheart. If anything tries to eat us, I‚Äôll make sure it chokes.‚Äù
She rolled her eyes, but the softness lingered. ‚Äú‚Ä¶You‚Äôre impossible.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Leon said quietly, leaning back against a tree. ‚ÄúBut you like me anyway.‚Äù
She didn‚Äôt deny it this time.

*Teeth in the Dark

The attack came just before dawn.
A rustle in the woods. A low, wet growl. Then movement.
Leon was up in an instant, gun drawn. ‚ÄúMira‚Äîwake up.‚Äù
She stirred, but the creature lunged before he could finish. A twisted, sinewy beast‚Äîits body warped, its skin pale and stretched, jaws lined with too many teeth.

Mirajane gasped, immediately shifting into her Satan Soul. Leon opened fire, bullets tearing through the monster‚Äôs hide, but it barely slowed.

‚ÄúFigures,‚Äù Leon muttered, reloading smoothly. ‚ÄúNothing‚Äôs ever easy.‚Äù
Mirajane slammed into the beast, claws raking, wings flaring. ‚ÄúWhat is this thing?!‚Äù

‚ÄúSomething I hoped I‚Äôd never see here,‚Äù Leon growled, rolling out of the way of snapping jaws. ‚ÄúBioweapon. B.O.W.‚Äù

The creature shrieked, charging again. Leon dove low, unloading a clip into its joints while Mirajane struck high, pinning it with brute force.
For a moment, it looked like they had it‚Äîuntil another one burst out of the treeline.

‚ÄúOf course there‚Äôs more,‚Äù Leon hissed.
Mirajane snarled, throwing the first beast aside. ‚ÄúThen let‚Äôs end this together.‚Äù

They moved like they‚Äôd been fighting side by side for years. Leon‚Äôs precision, Mirajane‚Äôs raw power‚Äîbullets and claws, grit and grace. Back to back, covering each other without thinking.

When the last creature fell, its corpse twitching before going still, silence returned to the forest.

Both of them were panting, bruised, bloodied‚Äîbut alive.

Leon leaned on his knees, wiping sweat from his brow. ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ that sucked.‚Äù
Mirajane, still in her Satan Soul form, looked at him‚Äîreally looked. The way he kept standing even when exhaustion was written all over him. The way he‚Äôd moved without hesitation to protect her.

‚ÄúLeon‚Ä¶‚Äù she started softly.
He glanced up, eyes locking with hers. Something raw, unguarded passed between them.

She opened her mouth‚Äî

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt say it,‚Äù Leon said quickly, half-smirk, half-serious. ‚ÄúIf you admit you like me, I‚Äôll never let you live it down.‚Äù

Her cheeks burned. ‚ÄúI‚ÄîI wasn‚Äôt going to‚Äî!‚Äù

‚ÄúSure,‚Äù he said, standing and holstering his gun. ‚ÄúYou keep telling yourself that, sweetheart.‚Äù

She glared, but her heart was racing too fast to argue.
And when they walked back to camp side by side, neither of them mentioned how close they‚Äôd come‚Äînot just to death, but to something far scarier.",1,1758300328.0,FanficMultiverse,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôve always struggled with binge eating. It‚Äôs been part of my life since I was a kid. For my family, going out to eat was how we had fun, and food became my safety net. I had a pretty traumatic childhood, and food felt like the one thing that soothed me.

As I got older I tried a bunch of things that didn‚Äôt really stick ‚Äî starving myself, weird diets, meds, even a gastric balloon surgery. They all helped for a while, but I always gained the weight back and then some.

I became a therapist and went to therapy myself, but we still couldn‚Äôt really figure out why I eat the way I do. I‚Äôve tried cutting sugar completely (because of blood sugar spikes), cutting back on caffeine (I drink a lot of coffee and crash), and eating a more balanced diet. Sometimes I don‚Äôt even know if it counts as binging because I‚Äôm very physically active ‚Äî I go to the gym 4‚Äì5 times a week and do intense full-body workouts and have gained a lot of muscle. Still, my workouts don‚Äôt keep up with how much I eat. I can easily be eating double the calories I burn.

I kept hoping I could replace bingeing with other, healthier habits ‚Äî a hobby, something meaningful to fill my time. But nothing feels as satisfying as eating large amounts of food. Afterwards I feel disgusted with myself, struggle to find anything to wear, and often don‚Äôt want to go out. I‚Äôm bloated and uncomfortable a lot of the time. If I don‚Äôt eat, I feel empty ‚Äî like something is wrong.

I really have tried a lot. I‚Äôve done two years of therapy, and now I‚Äôm a therapist myself (just starting out). My clinical focus is community mental health, trauma, and substance use ‚Äî not binge eating specifically ‚Äî so I don‚Äôt have specialized training in food addiction. Most days I‚Äôll eat 3‚Äì4k calories. Does that count as a binge if you‚Äôre very active? Sometimes I‚Äôll eat 1‚Äì2k calories in one sitting and feel so uncomfortable I can‚Äôt breathe. One time I ate 3,000 calories of mostly sugar in one sitting and passed out.

I don‚Äôt want to take medication right now (not anti-medication, just not my route at the moment). I guess I‚Äôm wondering: what actually helped you? Therapies, books, practical strategies, or routines that helped reduce the urge or the autopilot eating? Any resources or ideas would be really appreciated ‚Äî I‚Äôm tired of feeling like I‚Äôve failed at this after decades of trying.

Hi,
Three weeks ago I started getting nausea and fatigue but it felt like nothing more than a stomach bug. However, it didn‚Äôt go away and only got worse. Ten days in I had a blood test that showed everything was normal apart from a CRP of 9.1, platelets of 452,000 and ferritin 15.

Six days ago I developed a strange gait, like that of a drunk person. The exhaustion became even more profound and I started feeling like I would fall asleep at any given moment. I still have the nausea and I‚Äôm getting headaches and vertigo now but they aren‚Äôt too bad compared to the rest of my symptoms. 

In the last six days I‚Äôve gone from a sort of drunken like limp to being almost completely unable to walk. I have to hold onto walls or chairs and feel like I‚Äôm going to fall. I can only walk extremely slowly and it‚Äôs hard to just get across a room. The fatigue is absolutely dire and I genuinely feel like I could pass out at any minute. I live in a country where I don‚Äôt speak my first language and I‚Äôm having trouble remembering how to speak it, but I can communicate fine in English, my mother tongue. 

I phoned the medical emergency line a few days ago and was told to see the GP. The GP sent me for a CT scan which was yesterday to ensure I hadn‚Äôt had a stroke, which I had not. By that point I had to use the hospital wheelchairs as I could not walk across the car park. Today I woke up and it was worse than ever, I‚Äôve had a headache all day, my body is shaking, I couldn‚Äôt even make my own breakfast because I couldn‚Äôt stand up long enough to wait for the coffee machine to brew, I can only take tiny steps as my knees feel like they‚Äôre buckling in on themselves and I feel like I‚Äôm going to fall asleep. I just slept for three hours (it‚Äôs half 6pm where I am) and still feel like I‚Äôm going to fall asleep. 

So I went to the ER but they told me they couldn‚Äôt help me and I just needed to see my GP. The GP doesn‚Äôt have any appointments until Tuesday. I‚Äôm writing this on Friday. With the speed of my decline I don‚Äôt know what state I‚Äôm going to be in on Tuesday. How on earth can I manage this at home? How can I take care of myself? I‚Äôm feeling utterly hopeless and helpless and also terrified. Please, please, I‚Äôm desperate for advice. The doctors here are making it seem like I‚Äôm being dramatic but I can hardly walk. The physical impairment and psychological despair are driving me insane, I just need to know how to get through to Tuesday. 

I‚Äôm absolutely desperate for advice and at the end of my tether. If this were anyone else I‚Äôd tell them to go to the ER, but I did that earlier and they turned me away.",1,1758300037.0,AskDocs,2,1.0,False

Understanding the Basics of Dental Hygiene

What is Dental Hygiene?
Dental hygiene encompasses all the practices and habits that keep your teeth, gums, and mouth clean and healthy. It's a holistic approach that involves daily care, professional maintenance, and understanding the impact of your lifestyle on oral health.

Key Components of Excellent Oral Care
‚Ä¢ Daily brushing
‚Ä¢ Regular flossing
‚Ä¢ Proper nutrition
‚Ä¢ Routine dental check-ups
‚Ä¢ Avoiding harmful habits

The Importance of Proper Brushing Techniques

Choosing the Right Toothbrush
Selecting the correct toothbrush is crucial for effective dental hygiene. Dentists recommend:
1. Soft-bristled brushes
2. Comfortable handle grip
3. Size appropriate for your mouth

Brushing Technique Breakdown
**Proper brushing technique** involves more than just moving a brush around your mouth. Hold your toothbrush at a 45-degree angle to your gums and use gentle, circular motions. Spend at least two minutes brushing, ensuring you cover all surfaces of your teeth.

Flossing: The Overlooked Hero of Dental Hygiene

Why Flossing Matters
Statistics show that only 30% of Americans floss daily, despite dentists recommending it as a crucial part of oral care. Flossing removes plaque and food particles from areas your toothbrush can't reach, preventing tooth decay and gum disease.

Correct Flossing Technique
‚Ä¢ Use about 18 inches of floss
‚Ä¢ Gently slide between teeth
‚Ä¢ Curve floss around each tooth
‚Ä¢ Use a clean section of floss for each tooth

Foods That Promote Oral Health
Some foods actively contribute to dental hygiene:
1. Calcium-rich foods (milk, cheese, yogurt)
2. Crunchy fruits and vegetables
3. Green and black teas
4. Water

Foods to Avoid
‚Ä¢ Sugary snacks
‚Ä¢ Acidic drinks
‚Ä¢ Sticky candies
‚Ä¢ Excessive coffee

Today‚Äôs adventure takes us into one of  øAbdu‚Äôl-Bah√°‚Äôs letters (AB11813), where he levels some heavy accusations at M√≠rz√° Mu·∏•ammad  øAl√≠ ‚Äî Bah√°‚Äôu‚Äôll√°h‚Äôs son and his own half-brother.

# The Claims

In this letter,  øAbdu‚Äôl-Bah√° tells his correspondent that:

1. **Nab√≠l‚Äôs history** (the chronicle of early B√°b√≠ events) was stolen by Mu·∏•ammad  øAl√≠ ‚Äúthrough subtle means.‚Äù
2. He also seized ‚Äútwo bags‚Äù of documents, rings, and seals during Bah√°‚Äôu‚Äôll√°h‚Äôs burial.
3. From this stolen history, Mu·∏•ammad  øAl√≠ supposedly wrote a rival narrative, even planting the absurd story that Bah√°‚Äôu‚Äôll√°h drank poisoned coffee and then passed the cup to Ya·∏•y√°‚Äôs wife.
4. According to  øAbdu‚Äôl-Bah√°, this narrative was then sent abroad to be published.

That‚Äôs a dramatic accusation: theft of relics, falsification of history, and alignment with Azalƒ´ polemics.

# The Plausibility Check

Here‚Äôs where things get thorny:

* **Nab√≠l‚Äôs history was never really lost.** Shoghi Effendi had it in Haifa by 1921, and it became *The Dawn-Breakers* in 1932. If Mu·∏•ammad  øAl√≠ ‚Äústole it,‚Äù how did it stay in the Bah√°‚Äô√≠ archives?
* **No independent evidence.** Historians can‚Äôt verify that Mu·∏•ammad  øAl√≠ promoted the poisoned-coffee story. In fact, it would have undermined his own position, since he affirmed Bah√°‚Äôu‚Äôll√°h‚Äôs station.
* **Vagueness about relics.**  øAbdu‚Äôl-Bah√° doesn‚Äôt list the supposed missing documents in detail. That makes the story sound more like rhetoric than an actual inventory of lost materials.
* **Polemic value.** Branding Mu·∏•ammad  øAl√≠ as both a thief *and* an Azalƒ´ sympathizer was an effective way to discredit him, even if the link was implausible.

# So What Really Happened?

Most likely:

* After Bah√°‚Äôu‚Äôll√°h‚Äôs passing, there were disputes over relics and papers.
* Mu·∏•ammad  øAl√≠ may have taken some items ‚Äî perhaps copies of writings or personal effects ‚Äî but not the entirety of Nab√≠l‚Äôs chronicle.
*  øAbdu‚Äôl-Bah√° still had the authoritative manuscript in Haifa and carefully controlled its publication.
* To strengthen his case against his brother,  øAbdu‚Äôl-Bah√° painted the picture of wholesale theft and tied Mu·∏•ammad  øAl√≠ to Azalƒ´ fabrications, even though the agendas of the two groups were very different.

# üåø The Narrative in Plain Words

After Bah√°‚Äôu‚Äôll√°h died, family rivalries flared. Some papers may have been taken in the confusion, but Nab√≠l‚Äôs chronicle stayed with  øAbdu‚Äôl-Bah√°‚Äôs household. Years later, Shoghi Effendi translated it into English. The story that Mu·∏•ammad  øAl√≠ ‚Äústole‚Äù it and rewrote history is best read as **polemical exaggeration**, part of  øAbdu‚Äôl-Bah√°‚Äôs strategy to delegitimize his rival.

History isn‚Äôt always tidy ‚Äî sometimes it‚Äôs as much about *who tells the story* as about what was actually taken.

What do you think? Was  øAbdu‚Äôl-Bah√° exaggerating for effect, or could Mu·∏•ammad  øAl√≠ really have walked off with Bah√°‚Äôu‚Äôll√°h‚Äôs bags of history?",2,1758299703.0,bahaiGPT,0,1.0,False
1nl8fwy,https://i.redd.it/5s5pf8dpf5qf1.jpeg,Of Towers and Tables: What We Build Says Everything - TheKoinBlog.com,"There were towers in the city. Concrete towers. Glass towers. Towers that rose like teeth from the earth, biting at the sky. Some of them were crooked, some of them were proud, but all of them were tall and all of them stood alone. The people inside the towers looked out of them and down at the others, and when they walked the streets, they hurried with their eyes averted, as if ashamed of what they had made. But they did not stop building them.

You could say we built them because we were cold. Or scared. Or proud. Maybe we wanted to be seen from far away. Or maybe we just didn‚Äôt want to be touched. A tower is a good thing when you want to see the world and avoid it all at once. There‚Äôs a certain loneliness that feels like safety if you don‚Äôt look at it too long.

I knew a man once who lived on the fiftieth floor of a tower made of black stone. He had a leather chair and an ice bucket and a long view of the ocean that no one else could see. He told me the view was the only friend he needed. I asked him if the view ever spoke back. He didn‚Äôt answer, but I noticed he always poured two drinks.

I think it starts when we‚Äôre young. We build forts out of cushions and call them castles. Then we grow up and turn them into office buildings and call them success. But the idea‚Äôs the same. Stay in. Keep others out. Don‚Äôt let the bad things touch you. Don‚Äôt let the soft parts show.

But a table is something else. A table is flat and wide and low. It doesn‚Äôt rise or isolate. It waits. A table asks for company and demands nothing else. You can‚Äôt sit at a table without being seen, and you can‚Äôt hide in a corner when there are none. There is no prestige in a table. Only presence.

We used to eat together more. Talk more. We passed things with our hands and listened to stories that came with the bread. People said what they really thought between mouthfuls, and when someone cried, no one had to send an email about it later. The tears just stayed on the table next to the salt, and no one pretended they weren‚Äôt there.

I am not romantic about things. I know tables can be broken too. I‚Äôve seen families eat in silence. I‚Äôve seen lies served hot and dessert skipped out of bitterness. A table can hold cruelty as easily as kindness. But still, it is harder to lie when you‚Äôre chewing. And it is harder to hate when you‚Äôve just handed someone the butter.

A man builds a tower and climbs it and looks down and says, I have made something grand. But it is cold at the top and the windows are clean and empty. A man builds a table and sits and waits. And maybe no one comes. Or maybe one person does. And then another. And soon there is talk and coffee and silence that feels like belonging instead of absence.

It is easier to build alone. No one argues about the shape of a tower. You pour the concrete and go. But to build a table, you must ask. You must listen. You must measure. You must make room. And that is the work we avoid, not because it is too hard, but because it is too human.

Still, I think we must do it. We must take down the towers, one stone at a time. Use the bricks for benches. Let the wind come in. Let the birds perch again. Let the people see each other, tired and honest and full of flaws. Let us speak across grainy wood and spill things and laugh and find that we are less alone than we believed.

It is a small thing, a table. But the world turns on small things. Cups passed. Bread broken. Eyes met. And if we are ever to know each other again, it will not be from the top of some great height, but across something humble and flat and shared. It will be across a table.

I've been working on Language Byte for the past year, and I'm excited to share it with you all. It's a standalone Apple Watch app that makes learning languages actually fun and convenient.



\*\*Why I built this:\*\*

I was frustrated with bulky language apps that I never actually used. I wanted something that could fit into those micro-moments throughout the day - waiting in line, during coffee breaks, etc. The Apple Watch seemed perfect for this.



\*\*What makes it different:\*\*

‚Ä¢ \*\*10 languages supported\*\* - English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Haitian Creole, and Portuguese

‚Ä¢ \*\*Gamified learning\*\* - XP system, achievements, level progression with confetti celebrations

‚Ä¢ \*\*Smart quiz modes\*\* - Quick Drill, Listening Only, Focus Mistakes, and Mixed Mode

‚Ä¢ \*\*Spaced repetition\*\* - Actually remembers what you struggle with and reviews it intelligently

‚Ä¢ \*\*Watch complications\*\* - Word of the Day right on your watch face

‚Ä¢ \*\*Pronunciation practice\*\* - Real-time audio feedback

‚Ä¢ \*\*Siri shortcuts\*\* - ""Hey Siri, start studying"" actually works!



\*\*The tech side:\*\*

Built with SwiftUI, uses StoreKit 2 for subscriptions, has 100+ automated tests, and is optimized for watchOS performance. No data collection, everything runs locally on your watch.



\*\*What's free vs premium:\*\*

Free version gives you one language pair and basic features. Premium unlocks multiple languages, advanced categories, all quiz modes, and the full achievement system. There's a 7-day free trial.



\*\*Real talk:\*\*

I know there are a lot of language apps out there, but I genuinely think the Apple Watch form factor changes everything. You can literally learn during a 30-second elevator ride. The gamification keeps you coming back, and the spaced repetition actually works.



\*\*Download link:\*\* [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/language-byte/id6743985266](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/language-byte/id6743985266)



Would love to hear your thoughts! Has anyone else tried learning languages on their Apple Watch? What features would you want to see?

1nl8elq,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1nl8elq/when_the_light_goes_out/,When the Light Goes Out,"September 1^(st), 11:18AM

I arrived at the Rook Island Lighthouse this morning. The helicopter flight from the mainland was a jarring and bumpy 45-minute flight over open ocean. I‚Äôve never been on a helicopter before, and I‚Äôm not sure what I was expecting, but the sea winds were pushing us around pretty good on the way over. Amund, the pilot, told me twice during the trip that we might have to abort and try again when the weather was calmer, but he kept us moving and eventually we arrived at my destination.

He‚Äôd been pretty talkative when we‚Äôd first met and even more so when we lifted off from the helipad at the port, but that seemed to fade the closer we got to Rook Island. He‚Äôd filled me in on a little of the history of the place to pass the time ‚Äì how the current lighthouse was actually the¬†*second*¬†one to stand on that rocky outcropping. According to him, the first had been built sometime in the early seventeen hundreds and had been completely wiped out by a nasty winter storm in 1803, taking all three men stationed there with it. Another, more modern design had been erected after that, which was the foundation of the current Rook Island Lighthouse. He‚Äôd also made some brief mentions of how even that original lighthouse had been built upon the foundations of some old, secluded abbey, but the weather started getting rougher by then, and he was focused more on flying the helicopter than chatting.

I wasn‚Äôt too sure about what he was telling me, honestly. Sure, I could buy that there had been another lighthouse before this one, but an¬†*abbey*? Out here?

Nah ‚Äì I call bullshit.

I was pretty sure he was jerking my chain. Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt have the chance to probe any further after that, because the lighthouse appeared before us at that point, a little dot of white emerging from the haze of rain and mist in the otherwise endless ocean below.

How the hell do they even build lighthouses way out here in the middle of nowhere?

The winds had been pushing us around even more forcefully as we approached, but Amund was able to land us on the small helipad that had been retrofitted to the lighthouse roof with only a bit of struggle. He tried to maintain his ever-present calm demeanor, but I didn‚Äôt miss the beads of sweat and the occasional grimaces of concentration as we settled on the pad.

Even after we‚Äôd touched down, he seemed on-edge. His eyes never stopped moving and he never took his hands from the controls. Just gave me a nod after we‚Äôd settled on the deck ‚Äì my signal to get moving.

I hopped out, grabbed my bags, and climbed down through the trapdoor in the helipad, ducking under the rotor wash and careful of my footing on the rain-slick surface. As soon as I was safely below, he was up and gone again, the bright orange and yellow helicopter fading into the gray sky as it made its way back to land.

The lighthouse isn‚Äôt what I expected.

I was envisioning a quaint little island, maybe covered in green grass and with a cozy old cottage standing nearby. Typical post-card stuff.

Rook Island isn‚Äôt that sort of lighthouse.

It rises like some pale skeletal finger from the depths, jutting out from the angry sea atop a narrow pillar of rock. From the air, I could see the dark shadow of the submerged shoal surrounding it, an underwater island that couldn‚Äôt quite reach the surface. Beyond the jagged edges of the shoal, the water turned indigo and then black as it fell away to thousands of feet of murky depth.

The lighthouse was a slender tower built atop that rocky outcropping, battered and scarred from two hundred years of dutiful service and countless repairs.

Amund told me that, before they had built the helipad on the roof, lighthouse keepers arrived on boats at a small dock, the ruins of which were still visible at the base of the rocks. A narrow and precarious staircase, long since taken by the seas, had been the only means of entrance or escape from the island at that time. There were only small and infrequent windows of opportunity to safely approach the island by boat, and it wasn‚Äôt uncommon for the storms to make that approach impossible for weeks on end.

According to the pilot, more than one keeper had lost their lives to the churning waters here over the years. Bodies never found.

I guess when the sea takes a man, it‚Äôs not too keen on giving him back.

Things were different now, of course. The lighthouse had been automated back in the 90‚Äôs, and now the only people that came out here were the small crews that visited a few times a year to perform maintenance.

That‚Äôs us.

Well, technically, it‚Äôs only me right now. My partner, Calvin Sykes, missed his connecting flight yesterday and won‚Äôt be here until tomorrow.

So here I am, watching the helicopter disappear into the distance as I stand on the widows walk around the lamp room, with only the sounds of the wind and crashing of the waves against the rocks below me.

For all that noise, why does it seem so quiet?

My first job with this company. My first time in a lighthouse at all, and I‚Äôm all by myself in the middle of the ocean, no land in sight.

You know, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever felt so alone.

¬†

September 2^(nd), 9:30AM

What a shitty night.

As it turns out, the weather only got worse when the sun went down yesterday. The gray clouds turned to black, and the rain came down so heavily that I could actually feel the vibrations from it in the wooden floor of the sleeping quarters.

The wind didn‚Äôt help. It battered against the windows and churned up the water below into violent whitecaps and huge swells crashing over the island. The howling was more than a little unnerving, but I kept telling myself it was just the way the gale moved around the rocks and the tower. I tried not to think of what it would have been like for those men who had been swept away by the seas all those years ago. I can‚Äôt imagine a more terrifying way to go out.

Needless to say, I didn‚Äôt get much sleep. For the first time in recent memory, my night was filled with disturbing dreams. I can‚Äôt remember them this morning, but I woke with an unsettled stomach and a constant feeling of anxiousness. I thought it best to avoid coffee and instead settled for a granola bar and some water. There‚Äôs a chair and a small desk up in the lamp room, so I‚Äôm sitting up here right now watching out over the water and listening to the quiet hum of the mechanism behind me as it slowly rotates the beacon.

The storm passed sometime in the night, but the sun is still blocked out by heavy cloud cover and the whitecaps of the ocean make me think it may get worse before it clears.

Calvin should be here this afternoon, so I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be more at ease once he arrives and we start our work. According to company safety rules, there has to be at least two people present before I can do anything here, so I‚Äôm just trying to relax until he gets here.

By this time next week, I‚Äôll be on a flight back home.

¬†

September 2^(nd), 12:30PM

Well, that‚Äôs just¬†*great*.

Just got word over the radio that the weather back at the port has gotten worse. Low visibility, heavy wind and rain, and thunder and lightning. No flights today, and maybe not tomorrow either.

I talked to Calvin a little over the radio. He sounded a little frustrated and told me that there‚Äôd been a screw-up ‚Äì some sort of miscommunication. Apparently, I wasn‚Äôt supposed to be out here by myself. Company safety policy was pretty clear on that part ‚Äì I should have waited for him. He assured me it wasn‚Äôt my fault and I wasn‚Äôt in any sort of trouble ‚Äì someone else should have known better.

In the end, there wasn‚Äôt anything to do about it now, and he told me to just sit tight and enjoy the scenery. He made a point of reinforcing the safety rules that that I should keep to the upper levels until he arrives; that it isn‚Äôt safe for one person to go sightseeing in the lower levels all alone. There was too much risk of injury in this old tower. That‚Äôs fine with me, I told him. The view up in the lamp room is pretty good.

I‚Äôm not happy about it, but I‚Äôm still getting paid whether I‚Äôm changing bulbs, repainting railings, cleaning bird shit off the stairs, or sitting on my butt. So, at least that‚Äôs something.

I brought a book and have some movies on my tablet, so I‚Äôm sure I can keep myself entertained.

Hopefully, the weather will break, and Calvin will be here tomorrow.

¬†

September 2^(nd), 6:42PM

I did some exploring of the lighthouse today, despite Calvin‚Äôs warnings. I figure he was just making sure he was covering the company‚Äôs ass if I slip and break an ankle, but what he doesn‚Äôt know won‚Äôt hurt him, and truth be told, I‚Äôm getting bored.

Most of the upper floors are cramped and crowded with equipment. The battery room is barely large enough for a man to squeeze between the banks of cells, and the kitchen/sitting room feels claustrophobic. There‚Äôs an old TV and DVD player hanging above the refrigerator, but it looks like it hasn‚Äôt been used in twenty years. It‚Äôs not like I brought any DVDs with me anyway.

The sleeping quarters are below that, with six compact bunks built against the cylindrical walls of the lighthouse. They have a curve to them, but they‚Äôre just large enough that you can sleep in them comfortably. Since I‚Äôm the only one here, I don‚Äôt have to fight anyone to get a bottom bunk, which is nice.

The lower floors are larger, since the conical shape of the tower expands outward down towards its base, but even there, the generators and electrical equipment take up most of the free space. There‚Äôs just not a whole lot of room to spread out in here. Even the bathroom on the floor below the bunk room is tiny, just a toilet and a narrow shower stall and some storage cabinets.

On the ground floor, just below the generator room, there‚Äôs an old, rust-speckled iron door leading outside the lighthouse. This must be where the old keepers used to come through. It‚Äôs barred and locked from the inside, but I was able to get it open and step out onto the narrow steel landing at the head of the now-missing staircase.

Twisted railings and two heavily corroded steps are all that remain of the stairs, and when I worked up the nerve to creep closer to the edge, I found myself staring down a hundred feet of jagged and slick rocks to the pounding black seas below. I couldn‚Äôt imagine having to brave the steps that had once been there, especially with the gusting wind that was trying its damnedest to peel me off the platform. Even with a firm grip on the doorframe, I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable staying out there long, and quickly went back inside, replacing the bars and locking the door when I went.

A spiral staircase descended even lower than this floor, and I figured it probably led to either a cistern or more fuel storage. I decided to save that for later; my clothes were soaked through now, thanks to the rain and the sea spray, and I was shivering from my brief excursion outside. I decided to head back upstairs, change into some warm clothes, and heat myself up some freeze-dried dinner. Maybe watch a movie on my tablet, sip a glass of the whiskey I‚Äôd smuggled along.

I‚Äôll record more later.

¬†

September 3^(rd), 8:25AM

Okay, so apparently, I was more tired than I thought yesterday. After I ate dinner (which was surprisingly good for freeze-dried beef stroganoff), I went to my bunk with my tablet and, well, honestly, don‚Äôt remember anything after that.

The next thing I do remember was waking up in the middle of the night to another storm that had blown in ‚Äì big surprise there. It‚Äôs funny, but even after only a couple days here, I‚Äôm starting to get used to the creaking and groaning sounds the lighthouse makes in bad weather.

At some level, it almost seems familiar and comforting. My tablet had slipped off my chest and found its way to the floor at some point, so I sat up and placed it on the nearby table. I was getting ready to lay back down and get back to sleep when an out-of-place sound wound its way up from somewhere downstairs. It was a low groaning sound, almost a vibration, with a higher pitched squeal riding just below the surface.

It sounded a lot like rusty hinges, and I wondered if I‚Äôd neglected to secure the external door when I came back in earlier in the day. Begrudgingly, I slipped on my shoes and grabbed my flashlight and went downstairs. I didn‚Äôt want to turn on the lights, for fear of chasing away any chance I might have to go back to sleep afterwards.

I knew if the door had blown open, the storm would find its way in and soak everything. For my first job with the company, I sure as hell didn‚Äôt want to be responsible for flooding the lower levels, so I figured I needed to check it out and make sure everything was good.

I‚Äôm not gonna lie; going down those curving metal stairs with only my flashlight to guide me, in the middle of a storm and surrounded by an angry sea, was more than a little unnerving. I thought briefly about how the first lighthouse had been completely destroyed by a winter storm, but pushed that thought from my head and focused on my footing.

Now, I‚Äôm not a skittish person by nature. I‚Äôve done plenty of jobs that found me all alone in remote places, and I‚Äôve never once worried about anything other than whether or not I was able to get the job done on schedule or what I was going to eat for dinner.

I pride myself on being rational. I‚Äôm not afraid of things that go bump in the night. After all, there‚Äôs nothing there in the dark that isn‚Äôt there in the light, but even so, I could feel that growing sense of anxiousness trying to find root in the back of my mind. It was like an unfamiliar whisper telling me to go back up and get back into my bunk.

*Nothing to see here. Move along.*

So down I went, stubborn as ever.

Even before I reached the door, I knew it couldn‚Äôt have been open. The creaking sound didn‚Äôt reoccur, and the howl of the wind was still thankfully a muted roar, insulated by the thick walls of the lighthouse. Still, I‚Äôd come this far, and I knew I wouldn‚Äôt be able to get back to sleep unless I put eyes on it and checked for myself.

Sure enough, the door was still barred and locked, vibrating and occasionally rattling against its frame from the fury of the wind outside. Giving it a final once-over to reassure myself that all was well, I turned to head back upstairs.

No idea what that sound was, but regardless, at least it wasn‚Äôt anything I did. I‚Äôm not supposed to be down there by myself and I‚Äôm not looking to get fired on my first outing with this company for flooding the lighthouse.

That was last night. This morning, I‚Äôve already had my first coffee and some toast and I‚Äôm sitting at the table in the lamp room right now, looking out over the ocean. The storm has lessened in the hours since last night, but it‚Äôs still raining and blowing outside and the clouds are still low and gray.

I‚Äôm no meteorologist, but I‚Äôm fairly confident I won‚Äôt be meeting my partner today, either.

I‚Äôm starting to wonder if this job was a good idea. I feel like I‚Äôm a million miles away from home.

Anyway, I‚Äôm going to finish another cup of coffee and head on downstairs to poke around a bit more. It‚Äôll do me some good to have something to do.

More to come‚Ä¶

¬†

It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ um‚Ä¶ 9:45AM ‚Äì same day

*I don‚Äôt understand. I‚Ä¶I just...*

*This can‚Äôt be real‚Ä¶*

*I mean‚Ä¶ I must be losing my mind ‚Äì that‚Äôs the only explanation, right?*

*Shit.*

*I can‚Äôt do this right now.*

September 3^(rd), 11:00AM

Okay. I‚Äôve had a couple glasses of whiskey, and I‚Äôve calmed down a bit ‚Äì enough to do this recording of what happened, anyway. My thoughts are fragmented, but I‚Äôll try my best to make sense for anyone who‚Äôs listening to these recordings.

I‚Äôll try to just start from the beginning and take it one step at a time.

After I finished my coffee, I went downstairs like I said, turning my attention to the concrete steps that descended further down from the ground level and continuing my exploration from yesterday.

As I suspected, the floor below ‚Äì what you‚Äôd call the basement level, I guess - was occupied by a large fuel tank, but what I didn‚Äôt expect was to find another door and more steps leading even farther downward.

This was different than I‚Äôd seen before, though. It wasn‚Äôt painted wood or even a solid metal door like the exterior entrance had been, but instead was a wrought iron gate, ornately fashioned and looking more like it belonged in a castle dungeon or something. The center of it was embellished with a large iron crucifix, covering half the gate. I can‚Äôt say why, but for some reason, I found it strangely‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì foreboding is the word, I guess.

The gate had actually been half-hidden by some old cargo netting hanging on the wall of the basement level and I hadn‚Äôt noticed it at first. I pulled the netting away and took a closer look.

Through the iron bars, the beam of my flashlight illuminated rough steps, carved into the gray rock of the island itself. They spiraled downward and out of sight, so I couldn‚Äôt see very far, but my light reflected from the moisture-slick walls and surfaces of the steps. Standing in front of the door, I could smell the cool, musty air that wafted up from somewhere below. It smelled old and stale, like a museum or a stuffy library basement. It was the odor of things hidden away and forgotten.

I wondered exactly what reason anyone might have had to dig deeper in the heart of the island, and how far down the stairwell might actually go.

There was no key in the lock, but when I tugged on the door, it swung outward with a little resistance, and my stomach lurched at the all-too-familiar groaning and screeching that rose from its rusted hinges. There was no mistaking that sound; it was the same as I‚Äôd heard last night. I told myself that it had been just the door swinging lightly back and forth, pushed around by the pressure changes caused by the storm.

It sounded good at the time.

With more apprehension than I‚Äôm comfortable admitting, I forced myself to investigate further, carefully making my way down this new stairwell. The steps were slick with moisture and a greenish-black mold that covered most of their surface. They were uneven and steep, clearly carved by an inexpert hand and looking much older than the rest of the lighthouse. The centers of them were worn and smoothed as if by hundreds of years and countless footsteps.

As I went, the air grew colder and more humid, and after a bit, I had descended far enough that I was sure I must have been below sea level. The walls were hewn with the same rough construction as the steps, and the arched ceiling was barely tall enough to allow me to pass without stooping.

Although I didn‚Äôt keep track, it was at least ten or fifteen minutes that I went down in that spiral tunnel, growing more uncomfortable with each step. This stairwell was so out of place with the more modern construction above that I was sure it must have predated the lighthouse by some time.

Maybe it was a part of the original lighthouse, I‚Äôd thought. Hell, maybe even from that unlikely abbey that the pilot had mentioned.

When the stairwell finally reached the bottom, I felt like I had gone a hundred feet or more below the surface of the rocky island, and the thought of being surrounded by all that black ocean made me more than a little uncomfortable. Down there, I could feel the vibrations of the seas as they battered against the stones outside, could hear the muted thunder of their crashing in deep echoes.

The room I found myself in was larger than I might have expected ‚Äì probably fifty feet across. In the center of that stone room was a small wooden table and chair, both made from heavy dark wood and obviously old.

An antique oil lamp sat atop the damp surface of the table, its glass shield soot-stained around the top and encrusted with the long-dried remains of its fuel. In the center of the table, a thick, leather-bound book lay open, though the years and moisture had turned the pages to little more than a mass of blackened decay, making it impossible to identify what it might have been.

A bible, maybe? I‚Äôm not sure.

I swung the flashlight in the area around the table and found it otherwise empty of furniture, but not of decoration. The walls were smoother than those of the stairwell I‚Äôd come through, and though heavily stained with streaks and blotches of mildew and mold, I could see the time-faded remains of pastel murals covering them.

I can‚Äôt say why, but an uneasy feeling had settled over me, almost as if I‚Äôd found a place I wasn‚Äôt supposed to. Like I was trespassing somewhere I wasn‚Äôt welcome. Pushing it aside, I wandered a little closer to the walls, examining more closely the artwork and trying to discern what it depicted. The scenes were so corrupted by the wet environment that I couldn‚Äôt make out any details, but the whole thing had the feel of those elaborate frescos I‚Äôd seen in old churches.

Turning away from the paintings, I swept my light over the whole of the room again, the bright beam cutting a narrow tunnel through the gloom, tiny motes and moisture sparkling in the light. My breath hitched and my heart jumped to my throat when it suddenly found the two motionless forms kneeling upon the floor and facing a section of the wall.

I let out a spontaneous curse at the sight, shocked to find I wasn‚Äôt alone in this dark place. Instinctively, I leapt back, keeping the flashlight trained on the huddled forms. I stood rooted to that spot a long while, the beam from my light shaking in my hand and my feet ready to take flight at any second. When some time had passed without anything happening, I finally worked up the courage to move a little closer.

What I saw only added to my confusion. What knelt before me were the skeletal remains of two nuns, their old-fashioned habits hanging loosely upon their still-erect frames. Their fleshless skulls were slightly downturned, as if they‚Äôd died in prayer, and the bleached bones of their hands still clutched what appeared to be rosaries and crucifixes. The fabric and design of their vestments, though plain and coarse, marked them as catholic nuns, or of some related sect. At least, that was my guess.

It was obvious they‚Äôd been here for a long time ‚Äì maybe centuries, dying where they knelt in eternal watch. I couldn‚Äôt understand why they hadn‚Äôt crumbled to piles of bone and cloth in all that time, and my mind continued to rebel against my presence here. Every ounce of my body felt that pull ‚Äì the insistence that I leave this place immediately and never return.

Still, I focused on my breathing and forced my thoughts to calm, turning the whole thing over with logical set.

Yes, there were bodies. But they were¬†*old*. It wasn‚Äôt like I‚Äôd just tripped across a murder scene. If this place had once been a hermitage convent or abbey, it only made sense that there might be some remnants of their existence. I told myself that this was a holy place, a place where the pious sequestered themselves from the rest of humanity to focus their devotions without worldly distraction. If anything, this was a historical place that should be studied by scholars, not a place of irrational fear.

I told myself all this, and it helped a little. Enough for my curiosity to take the lead once again and my racing heart to ease a bit.

Reluctantly turning my light from the two sisters, I focused it on the section of wall before them, where their attentions had been focused in their vigil.

It was there I spied the door. It was cleverly concealed under the decorations of the mural, but the thick wood had swollen and warped with the moisture and now stood a little proud of the wall. It looked like there had once been a handle of some sort to pull it open, but now there was only a hole where it had once been mounted.

I pulled at it tentatively before I realized that there were heavy black iron nails running around the border of the rotting wood and into the frame. I can‚Äôt say why, but I felt compelled to investigate further. This had obviously been the subject of the nuns‚Äô attentions and had been important enough for them to remain in prayer until their dying breaths. I couldn‚Äôt imagine what might lay beyond that door.

I grabbed the multitool from my back pocket and flipped open the pliers, going to work pulling the nails out one at a time and letting them drop with dull rings to the floor. When I was done, I stepped back a moment and looked over the surface, making sure I hadn‚Äôt missed any.

I hesitated a beat, something almost instinctual ‚Äì a primitive stirring at the back of my mind ‚Äì telling me to leave it alone.

Ignoring that voice, I carefully hooked a finger through the hole in the door and pulled, abruptly jerking my hand away at the slimy, spongy feel of the wood. It felt uncomfortably warm and somehow,¬†*sickly ‚Äì*¬†almost like I had touched something alive. I grimaced and scrubbed my hand against my jeans in revulsion.

The door swung open slowly with a scraping protest until there was enough room for me to step inside. When I did, a soft current of fetid air blew past me, smelling of stagnation and age and something else that I couldn‚Äôt place.

Something¬†*wrong*.

This is where I begin to wonder if I‚Äôve lost my grip on sanity. The interior of this room was undecorated, the walls the same slimy gray as the stairwell had been. But it was what my flashlight revealed within that demanded my immediate attention.

There, chained to the far wall with thick iron shackles, stood the desiccated and unmistakable remains of a man. He had been huge ‚Äì every bit of seven feet tall, and grotesquely deformed. Even though the flesh had long since shrunk and withered, taking on a gray hue mottled with angry red splotches, I could see clearly the unnatural protrusions covering the whole of his remains, pushing out from beneath the leathery skin as if they were trying to escape. The skeleton beneath was twisted and malformed.

Across the wall behind the figure, it looked like someone had painted huge, outstretched wings in a powdery black medium ‚Äì charcoal or something like that. It almost looked burned into the surface of the stone wall, like someone had painted it with gunpowder and then ignited it. Those wings must have been twelve feet across and depicted in a fashion that made me think of something reptilian or maybe bat-like, with membranes of skin instead of feathers. It gave the whole scene an even more sinister and unsettling air.

I‚Äôm not sure how, but the corpse still stood upright as it had in life, with arms outstretched and bound by the heavy iron restraints. Its head, abnormally large and bulbous, hung upon its chest limply, its features downcast and hidden from view. How long had this man suffered here before his death?

What terrible thing had he done to deserve this?

What was this place?

Before I had time to contemplate this any further, something happened that I still can‚Äôt explain and is the reason my hands are still shaking right now.

It moved.

The fucking thing actually¬†*moved*. With the rustling and creaking sound of dried leather stretched taut, the head lifted slowly from its chest, and black pits that once held eyes fixed on me. A wave of nausea swept over me like a cold wash, and I started hyperventilating. Intense flashes of sickening revulsion and raw fear spiked painfully in my mind for a blinding moment, like nothing I have ever felt before. I put my hands to my head, as if that would help ward off this onslaught of pain, but it didn‚Äôt shield me at all.

Stumbling backwards blindly, I tripped and fell hard in the doorway, cutting my hand painfully on the discarded iron nails and scattering them across the floor. I was only there for a second, though, because the next thing I knew, I had scrambled to my feet and was running back up the winding staircase as fast as I could, hands against the disgusting slickness of the mold and algae to steady my flight. All I could hear was the thudding of my heartbeat in my temples and the rasping of my breath.

When I reached the iron gate, I rushed through and slammed it hard behind me, turning then and peering through the bars into the swirling darkness below. I strained hard to see or hear anything, and after a few moments, the sound of slow and wet breathing drifted up from that stygian abyss.

I thought I heard ‚Äì though I can‚Äôt swear to it ‚Äì the faint metallic sound of heavy chains striking the stoney floor somewhere in the shadowed depths, and that nausea returned, almost physically pushing me away from the door and chasing me back up through the levels of the lighthouse above.

I didn‚Äôt stop until I found myself in the lamp room at the top of the lighthouse, dropping heavily into the chair and resting my head on the table, trying to catch my breath.

It took me longer than it should have to realize that the room was quiet, other than the muted sounds of the wind and the sea. The beacon was no longer rotating behind its lenses. The light was no longer lit, and it felt for all the world like something momentous had just changed.

What the hell is going on?

September 3^(rd), 6:45PM

They‚Äôre not coming, and they‚Äôre not answering my radio calls anymore. I know they‚Äôre still there, listening, but they won‚Äôt answer me. Won‚Äôt tell me why.

I‚Äôd been trying to raise someone ‚Äì¬†*anyone ‚Äì*¬†on the radio for hours with no answer. I‚Äôd just about given up trying when my radio crackled and the voice of Calvin Sykes, the man who was supposed to be my new partner, came through. His tone was flat, but I didn‚Äôt miss the hint of frustration in it. Maybe a little disappointment, too.

He said that the light had gone out, like that meant something special that I didn‚Äôt understand. He told me that I‚Äôd been warned to stay out of the lower levels. Didn‚Äôt¬†*ask*¬†me if I‚Äôd disobeyed his instructions ‚Äì somehow, he just¬†*knew*. Said that I was a part of it now. That there wasn‚Äôt anything they could do ‚Äì they had no choice. Nothing could come off the island now. Something about the¬†*forsaken*¬†and¬†*the nameless,*¬†but he‚Äôd lost me by that point.

I have no earthly idea what he was rambling about, but I understood the gist of what he was telling me ‚Äì they weren‚Äôt coming for me.

Then he asked if I was a religious man. I told him I wasn‚Äôt, and he didn‚Äôt say anything for a long time. When he spoke again, it was only a couple of words filtering through the static.

*I‚Äôm sorry.*

That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs all he said, and that‚Äôs the last time I heard his or anyone else‚Äôs voice over the radio.

I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on ‚Äì what it is that I‚Äôm supposed to be¬†*a part of.*

I just know that I‚Äôm all alone out here, with no way off this damned island. The sun is starting to go down now, and the storm is getting worse than I‚Äôve seen since I‚Äôve been here. The sky has a strange green tint to it and the wind is starting to sound like voices swirling around outside.

I just want to go home, but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs going to happen.

I just heard the sound of those hinges again from downstairs.",3,1758299606.0,scarystories,2,1.0,False
1nl8eco,https://v.redd.it/hdo0t98ef5qf1,Meet CH-11P (aka Chip): A snarky Rive-powered droid chatbot that roasts you while chatting,"So‚Ä¶ we built a chatbot.
But instead of being polite, helpful, and boring‚Ä¶ ours is an astromech droid with an attitude problem.

ü§ñ What it does:
	‚Ä¢	Runs on Rive animations (blinks, wiggles, and fires a ‚Äúspeak‚Äù trigger when it mouths off).
	‚Ä¢	Talks to an LLM through n8n, so your messages actually go somewhere useful (well‚Ä¶ as useful as the bot wants to be).
	‚Ä¢	Keeps up a rotation of idle taunts‚Äîif you ignore it, it will sass you every minute.
	‚Ä¢	Comes with sound effects + drid sounds for that extra ‚Äúdroid in your browser‚Äù feel.

ü§ñWhy we did it:
Because customer service chatbots are boring. CH-11P is here to entertain, roast you a little, and maybe convince you to support the project with pizza or coffee.

ü§ñ How to try it:
	‚Ä¢	Load up https://ch11p.thesidequest.studio in your browser of choice. 
	‚Ä¢	Sit back and let Chip either answer your question or insult your typing speed.

ü§ñ Pro tip:
If you walk away, the first taunt fires immediately. Don‚Äôt say I didn‚Äôt warn you.

**Why This Pick**

It‚Äôs tough for me to bet on a low score with Mitch Keller‚Äôs (4.13 ERA) name on the schedule ‚Äì so I won‚Äôt (lol). Between Keller and Luis Severino (4.82 ERA), this total should see at least 9. Severino has allowed 8 runs on 10 hits in just his last 2 starts ‚Äì it makes no sense to put money on an Under with a statistic like that in the wings. In addition, the As have won 6 of their last 7 games, and haven‚Äôt had much issue putting runs in the bag over the last week. I don‚Äôt trust either pitcher and both bullpens leave a ton to be desired ‚Äì I‚Äôll happily take the Over to cash.¬†

Hope you're all having a good semester. I'm a student/local here and my friends and I are working on a new food venture right in the Tricity. Think of it as our passion project to bring some genuinely good food that's also easy on the wallet.
Before we do anything else, we want to hear from the real experts: you guys!
We've put together a super quick survey (3-5 mins) to get your honest opinion on the food scene here. We're not selling anything, just trying to figure out what you actually want.
As a huge thank you for your time, we're doing two things:
1. Guaranteed Reward: Everyone who fills out the survey will get a coupon for a free coffee/lassi on their first visit when we open. No BS, no lucky draw‚Äîit's a small thank you for your help.
2. Exclusive Invite: We'll be inviting the most insightful respondents to an exclusive pre-launch tasting event to try our food first!
Your opinion seriously matters to us. This is our chance to build something that truly serves the student community.
You can find the survey here:

1nl85vv,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewParents/comments/1nl85vv/overstimulated_a_first_time_mom_will_this_ever/,Overstimulated a first time mom - will this ever change?,"I'm 35 years old and a first-time mom. I'm mentioning my age because I wanted to emphasize that I lived many years without a child. I always had plenty of sports hobbies, but I also often liked to just laze around scrolling through Instagram, Facebook, etc., or browsing various shopping sites while sipping warm tea or coffee. I loved silence and being alone with myself.

During pregnancy, for health reasons, I also didn't work, so I had tons of free time - I slept a lot and rested.

Now my baby is 5 weeks old and unfortunately I completely can't find myself in this new reality. It's not about being a mom itself, but about being terribly overstimulated now. I read many tips/posts and constantly saw advice like:

* cook simple meals/buy ready-made meals
* the dishwasher or laundry can wait
* don't be afraid to ask for help, etc.

I don't completely agree with this, because yes, the dishwasher or laundry can wait one day, but the next day you finally have to do it, because otherwise you won't have dishes or clothes. I was never the type of person who paid much attention to tidiness, but I tried to manage these basic things. The difference is that before having the baby, I could load the dishwasher at 10 different moments of the day and did it when I simply felt like it - same with laundry, vacuuming. Now I have to do it when I have ""free"" time between my baby's crying. As you know, childcare is demanding, especially since my baby sleeps little and cries a lot :) When he finally falls asleep, it's for a very short period, so then there's finally time to eat something. When my husband takes care of him after work, I have to hurriedly load dirty dishes into the dishwasher and manage some basic things just to exist.

I'll also add that my baby mainly sleeps during stroller walks, so during that time I also don't feel like I'm resting, because my back hurts, my legs hurt, I need to be focused on the road, etc. Very often I return from an hour-long walk after which I'm tired, and I just enter the house and he wakes up and starts screaming. As a result, I'm tired from a walk I didn't really want to take (but what won't you do to get the baby to sleep), and when he starts crying after entering the house and I have to listen to his screaming, it only makes me even more tired.

To summarize, I feel like I have absolutely no time for anything from my ""previous life.""

I don't understand how people with more children function?! They say it's ALL A MATTER OF ORGANIZATION. But even though I was always well-organized and was a person of routine, now I can't create even a trace of my previous life.

Will this ever change? Will I be able to go to the gym again soon, or ride a bike, or carelessly scroll through Instagram?",13,1758299066.0,NewParents,43,0.85,False

1nl82w2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sharjah/comments/1nl82w2/lost_my_3_year_old_the_longest_10_min_in_my_life/,Lost my 3 year old - the longest 10 min in my life,"Don‚Äôt judge. I know this should not happen!

So me and my kids were on the way to the park. My 3 year old is on a scooter. He is in front of me waiting at the crossroad. The car stopped he crossed I was behind him. After he crossed me and the other kids crossed. So we went up a small hill where cars were parked. The cars were too close to the wall so I had to make a detour because I couldn‚Äôt pass with the baby stroller. In the moment I went this hill up my 3 year old turned around and couldn‚Äôt see me anymore.

I come up look around no child. My heart beat got faster. My throat tightened. We walk fast to the park no child. I immediately started asking and panicked. 

One woman came and saw I am looking for a child. She said she came from the other side and did not see him. 

The security immediately alarmed and checked the cctv. 

Another woman came and called the police. She was so kind to talk to them in arabic she handed me the phone and they said I need to come to the police station.

Standing at this point eyes wide open about to die I said I CAN NOT WAIT. I cried. I have to run look for him by myself. The woman and security stood with the baby. I started running and asking if anyone saw him. One guy said he saw him driving towards Spinneys. It made sense so was running as fast I could and every time stopped to ask again security if they saw him. 

The security already gathered half way they stopped me said go back they found him!!!! Praise be God!


He went the way back home. One man from a parfume shop stopped him because he always see me with the kids. He said your mummy will come just wait here with me. And another security guard was with him. 

When I came. Oh my God. Thankful. 

We still went to the park had a talk. I learned from it.

The way back home I felt I have to do something as a thank you to the perfume guy. Giving him money? There is no price. It felt awkward. Buying a perfume? No head for this. So I went to the coffee shop nearby ordered two nice drinks and let them deliver it to him. I ordered two because I saw he was not alone. 

Resume:
UAE really is organised. Quick. Smart. Responsible. They take their job seriously.

first off the reg next to me, this guy is the definition of a shitty reg. he tanks 3 min preflop with jack seven off like he‚Äôs solving the f***ing cold war. he sighs, looks around, stares at his chips like they‚Äôre gonna talk back to him, then folds. folds. then slams the cards like he just saved humanity. i‚Äôm like bro relax ur in for $200 not defending your phd thesis.

then there‚Äôs this old man coffee dude, swear he‚Äôs been drinking the same cold ass cup since 1978. every orbit he goes ‚Äúblinds go up yet??‚Äù and we‚Äôre all like dude it‚Äôs a cash game. cash. game. he doesn‚Äôt care just stares into the void and sometimes raises 5x with queen nine like it‚Äôs aces.

but the main event, holy shit‚Ä¶ the tweaker in a wheelchair. dude is playing 100% vpip like it‚Äôs a speedrun, just blasting off stacks. after busting twice he FULLY snaps, starts yelling ‚Äúi‚Äôm the BIG BLIND MESSIAH‚Äù and ‚Äúdealer‚Äôs with the FBI‚Äù and at one point i swear he accused the cocktail waitress of collusion. he‚Äôs banging on the table, spinning his wheels into the rail, chips flying everywhere. and then‚Ä¶ bro. he shits himself. like no metaphor, actual pants filled.

whole table just stops. reg mid-sigh freezes like a statue. old man drops his cup and finally it spills everywhere. dealer just stares dead ahead like he‚Äôs reconsidering every life choice.

and idk why but i just‚Ä¶ took over? i‚Äôm like ‚Äúcolor me up, i got this.‚Äù push the tweaker out like i‚Äôm escorting the pope on a parade float. grab napkins for the dealer. buy old man a fresh coffee cuz god knows he needed it. tell the reg ‚Äúyeah folding 84o was correct‚Äù so he feels validated. when i come back ppl legit CLAPPED. like i was some kinda folk hero of low stakes poker.

left the game down $73 but honestly i think i left with something way more important: legacy.",14,1758298671.0,poker,10,0.7,False

1nl7zbm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1nl7zbm/kicking_the_diet_soda_habit/,Kicking the Diet Soda habit,"For 55+ years I have had a. unhealthy relationship with diet sodas. It started with Tab in the 1960's, morphed to Diet Coke in the 1980s, Diet Rite and others in the 1990s, and finally Diet Pepsi from 2008 on. In recent years I have augmented this with a home Soda Stream machine. I get 20 pound CO2 tanks from a welding supply store and modify the soda stream dispenser to use them  i typically drink the equivalent of 12 cans a day, often more.

I have done this at times when I ran marathons at a BMI of 23 and also at times when I was obese at a BMI of 36. While this volume of a non-nutritious product is not as acutely harmful as high-fructose corn syrup laden ,Coke and Pepsi, it is obvious that it isn't particularly helpful in maintaining a healthy weight or keeping good eating habits. My success with Zepbound has convinced me that there is a gut-brain connection, and I am thinking there might be something to the theory that artificial sweeteners damage the proper functioning of the gut biome.

Yesterday, through a perfect storm of circumstance, I ran our of Soda Stream syrup, and had no Diet Pepsi in the fridge. A light turned on in my brain and I said to myself ""why not see if you can kick this habit as well?' So I went the day with plain water for a beverage and black coffee for the occasional kick of caffeine. I can't say as I really missed the soda.

Today is Day 2 of this quest, and I did kind of miss the morning ritual of preparing and drinking an Ice cold liter or two of Diet Cola. But I had my coffee and plain water and I was ok. 

Zepbound has largely fixed my weight, mostly stopped my interest in alcohol, and now maybe the anti-addiction factors  that some people claim for it are kicking in on the Diet Soda.I hope so.

I am interested in how the community feels about diet beverages generally, and suggestions for kicking this habit for good.

Thanks in advance!
