1hrouac,https://www.reddit.com/r/phinvest/comments/1hrouac/advise_on_buying_a_piece_of_land_and_turning_it/,Advise on buying a piece of land and turning it to a home for 4/commercial space,"Hi guys! 2024 has been a fruitful year for me. Last year January I managed to pay all my debts and got my emergency funds lined up. I also got my first car last year and I have enough to maintain it and splurge on a little bit more on the side. Before last year ends, I have been contemplating on making bold moves in both investing and securing our future. My biggest reason is I that sitting money is practical but being conservative won't let me secure the goals I have for myself and my future family. I kept on asking myself last year ""If not now when?"" so I wanted to make bold moves this year and take a leap of faith if you will. Below are some of my early conceptualization, so please help me critique + advise:



* Year 2023, the house beside us got demolished, initially planned to be a parking space but in the end naging tambakan siya but I wanted to ask neighbours namin if they wanted to sell it (I believe they have plans for it). If they do, it's a 4x7 meters piece of land. I know it's small but I can make something out of it. Plan is parking below, 2nd floor will be a cafe and 3rd floor will be our small home (me, fiance and our moms)
* Payment terms would be a loan in PAG-IBIG. I have 150k in savings whilst my fiance has 400k. We earn about 85k monthly combined (not including bonuses and so on). In terms of construction, I am a small time contractor and Jr. Architect with a small team of Architects who could help me out. I am estimating a loan of 1M for the land and 2M for the construction of the 3 storey mixed type structure.
* Why a business and why cafe? I have been contemplating about whether getting a home first to secure our peace or a business to hopefully secure a little bit of our future. As land price rises, the more I wait, the less ecstatic I become in investing. I've been contemplating in having a business kasi I think it's the only way for most people to succeed. I do not want to be a corporate worker my whole life, and wanted to feel how to be my own boss for once. Why cafe? Besides it a booming business at the moment (it is oversaturated to be precise) it's also one of the best markets in our residence (assuming I get the land). One block away from us is one of the big three schools, one tricycle away's a hospital and a walk from our street is the residential palengke. At the moment, there are 4 cafes near our area. One is a big franchise cafe but nilalangaw siya because most of the time kulang kulang menu nila, and the pricing is the same as SB and yet fails to deliver good tasting coffee. The other two are small cafes na parang Big Brew whilst the other one will be our biggest competitor but is 1 tricycle away from the main hub, so I believe we have a chance on beating them. Lastly, I've been a big fan of cafes since 2019 and probably was able to visit about 70+ cafes now both abroad and local. I wanted to make a unique concept na bago sa panlasang pinoy and I believe I have the means to do so.
* Why also incorporate our home? My current home is decaying. Hindi rin siya sa amin so I can't say anything about it. I wanted peace, gusto ko pag gising ko magandang ambience ang makikita ko and magkaroon ng sariling kwarto. Gusto ko si mama at ako, makapagluto as right now, our kitchen is almost unusuable and I do not want to repair it with my own money dahil sisirain lang din ng mga taong nakatira dito. Ayokong magising na merong poop ng aso sa ground floor na hindi nililinis, or may ihi ng aso na sinipsip na ng tiles sa sobrang tagal bago linisin. I want me, my fiance, our two mothers and my dog to get a well-deserved rest after work.
* I am now 30, and I believe walang mangyayari talaga if I do not attempt a leap of faith. 

I know this is a big decision so I've been contemplating on this for a few months now. If anyone can give me a sound advise if I should pursue or not this concept/idea of mine please do not hesitate to comment. THANK YOU IN ADVANCE! and HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONE!",1,1735804768.0,phinvest,0,0.67,False

1hropcv,https://www.reddit.com/r/KCL_Detention_center/comments/1hropcv/oh_she_watched_it_all_rightand_hello_all/,"Oh, she watched it all right...and Hello All!","Hi there. This is my very first reddit post since I created an acct in 2020!

I found the KCL DC about a week ago. And let me tell you a lot of my questions, concerns, confusions and gut feelings are validated.

I fell into the true crime world on YT when Charlie Adelson was testifying in his trial. I couldn't turn away! And somehow last spring, KCL was in my feed. I really thought good things. And, gosh, if Ruth Markel thought so highly of her, she must be covering the Markel case for all the right reasons, right? True North and all.

Things seemed copascetic though whoever that FF association was confounded me a bit. Arrogant, mean, thinks she cornered the Markel market. So I avoided that chic like the plague.

Then Donna's trial. Then the ""if you feel you want to help pay for my so-called working trip to Tally"" post? Egads...a grift. By an allegedly very well off lady. I didn't contribute.

Then the drive to Tally. So many hotel upgrade points! Wow. And the Alina reservations. I was happy for her having all her good luck. When I learned about the ridiculous ""for people who aren't wealthy to feel like the are wealthy by giving their money away"" Alina I was real glad I didn't support the ""working"" trial trip!

Then there was running into Dugan at the seafood place. (Or did KCL stalk Dugan?) 

And then KCL started to become breathlessly more manic between every new live stream in 25 min increments and by day 2 Tally, it became a comedic horror show that was never going to end well for KCL. I couldn't turn away.

And then I knew she was losing her mind when she went on this angry bent against Rashbaum. Unhinged and irrational. Rashy isn't my fav but I seething about him to the extent she did is nuts.

Oh trial postponed. The eerie insinuations about the necklace. A hurricane. The evil air bnb lady. The..""omg"" 2 hr drive east. 

I forget where the detention center rant fell into the above schedule but not being in the inner circle I wasn't sure what I missed. Something happened. People were being disloyal..something about PP, Mentour lawyer.

Woke up to an eff em post that was off the rails and the nutty laughing posts.

The drinking amped up as did the mania in Jacksonville. It was jville, right?

Then I unsubscribed bc her channel should have been named KatieCrazyLady.

In recent months I looked her up..and found the out loud version about the time she posted that she was going to step away for her mental health and then proceeded to post multiple videos daily. Yup, still nuts. I didn't subscribe but looked her up now and again just to see if she might be getting help.

Fast forward to last week...I heard loud and clear over and over that that KCL was routinely tuning into her detractors with poorly masked jabs at them. I googled, and look what I found on reddit! 

Let me tell you...I feel so validated!! I wasn't inner circle like I said but during a Tally live I mentioned something about something and KCL looked right into her camera and sneared and said, ""No! You're just weird!"" To me! Someone who had cheered her on, supported her, who was genuinely excited that she was having such a fortuitous social Fla trip. I can recall my feelings being seriously hurt. It was just shocking. It was mean..it was like her mask slipped off suddenly. Pretty sure that's when I unsubscribed. Pretty sure.

I DID contribute to the coffee money surprise $20 bc I really thought it was going to something for Ruth. I want that $ back and wondered why she didn't return everyone's money when the trial was axed.

Back to today..oh boy, I watched Patty's NYE  live on replay. Holy f#ck! So after I watched today's KCL ""uplifting"" post. Ladies and gents, she absolutely watched it. Undeniable. The blinking, the side eyes, the barely getting words out with the fast shallow breaths!

Ole lady is gonna blow! Today was her attempt at ""I'm going to take the high road like a guru.""

Take cover.

(Btw, to Max and all, Crazy Lady isn't suing anyone. She doesn't have an atty. She asked a friend who knows an atty...hey..can we sue ff9r X. That's it. ""We are looking into our options"" means ""the attorney wants a $10,000 retainer to jump into this bs."" The not really wealthy lady ain't parting with that and no atty would touch such literal bullsh#t if there wasn't $50k in billable hours and other future legit legal work in the the pipe, i.e., an atty wouldn't do bs ugly work if there weren't a big payday. Just sayin')

Sorry for this long post. My jaw has been down to my knees this past week afyer finding this subreddit. Thank you to Max and Megan for providing the foundation for all of this.

 I wonder how many more ""not inner circle"" ppl like me are flies on the wall in this whack situation.

Achieving a brighter, more radiant smile is a goal for many people seeking to boost their confidence and appearance. Teeth whitening strips have become increasingly popular as an accessible and convenient method for dental cosmetic enhancement. However, one of the most common questions people have after using these strips is about dietary restrictions and potential impacts on the whitening process. Understanding what you can and cannot eat after using teeth whitening strips is crucial for maintaining your results and protecting your newly brightened smile.

What Happens During Teeth Whitening?

When you use teeth whitening strips, the active ingredients work to remove surface stains and penetrate tooth enamel. This process temporarily makes your teeth more sensitive and porous, which means your dietary choices become critically important immediately after treatment.

Key Considerations Immediately After Teeth Whitening

1. Temporary Tooth Sensitivity
2. Increased Enamel Porosity
3. Higher Risk of Staining
4. Potential Discomfort with Extreme Temperatures

Click here to learn more: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com

The Immediate Post-Whitening Eating Guidelines

Right after using teeth whitening strips, you'll want to follow a **white diet** for at least 24-48 hours. This approach helps maintain your whitening results and prevents potential staining or sensitivity issues.

Foods and Drinks to Avoid

• Dark-colored beverages (coffee, red wine, tea)
• Colored sauces
• Berries and dark fruits
• Tomato-based products
• Chocolate
• Colored condiments

Safe Foods to Consume

After teeth whitening, focus on consuming:
• Plain white rice
• Chicken
• Fish
• Egg whites
• Clear soups
• Water
• Milk
• Vanilla pudding

Understanding Tooth Sensitivity After Whitening

Tooth sensitivity is a common side effect of teeth whitening treatments. Your teeth become more porous and vulnerable immediately after using whitening strips, which can cause temporary discomfort when consuming hot or cold foods.

Tips for Managing Sensitivity

• Use a desensitizing toothpaste
• Avoid extreme temperature foods
• Choose soft, mild-temperature foods
• Wait at least 30 minutes after whitening before eating

Hydration and Oral Care Post-Whitening

Drinking water is essential after teeth whitening. Water helps rinse away potential staining agents and keeps your mouth clean. **Avoid colored or sugary drinks** that might compromise your whitening results.

Long-Term Dietary Recommendations

While the first 48 hours are crucial, maintaining your white smile requires ongoing dietary mindfulness. Consider these long-term strategies:

1. Rinse mouth after consuming staining foods
2. Use a straw for potentially staining beverages
3. Maintain good oral hygiene
4. Regular dental check-ups

Professional Recommendations

Dental professionals typically recommend waiting at least 30 minutes to an hour after teeth whitening before consuming any food. This waiting period allows the whitening agents to complete their initial treatment and reduces the risk of staining or sensitivity.

Common Mistakes to Avoid

• Eating immediately after whitening
• Consuming dark or colored foods
• Ignoring tooth sensitivity
• Skipping oral hygiene routines

When to Seek Professional Advice

If you experience prolonged sensitivity or unusual discomfort after teeth whitening, consult your dentist. Some individuals might have unique dental conditions requiring specialized care.

Final Thoughts on Eating After Teeth Whitening

Protecting your newly whitened smile requires careful attention to your diet and oral care routine. By following these guidelines and being mindful of what you consume, you can maximize the effectiveness of your teeth whitening treatment and enjoy a brighter, more confident smile for weeks and months to come.

Remember, everyone's teeth and sensitivity levels are different, so pay attention to your body's signals and adjust your approach accordingly. A beautiful, white smile is within reach with the right care and precautions.",1,1735803918.0,Teethgumhealth,0,1.0,False

Instead I chugged a large black coffee/espresso mix hoping to push out the stomach ache.

In the car (not driving) I took a few of the beta blockers I was prescribed for anxiety as I didn’t want my anxiety about feeling ill to ruin anyone else’s night. Once the medication settled in my stomach I immediately felt dizzy and nauseous. I began to throw up in the bathroom, my friend took me outside to get some air and I was feeling fine when all of a sudden another wave of nausea hit and I knew that due to the crowd I wouldn’t be able to make it to a stall, but it was going to come out one way or the other. My only option if I didn’t want to puke inside was to lean over the patio railing and release it. A group near me began to ask if I was okay, I told them I was fine. My favorite security guard approached me looking very concerned. My friends told me they had to take me home and they helped me through the bar and outside along with a different security guard. I explained to him the situation and promised him I wasn’t drunk and that I respected the owner and his business too much to do that at his establishment. I feel like an ass and am worried that I will be in trouble next time I go. I still have a stomach bug and I can’t take my anti anxiety because I’m afraid I’ll throw up again. I think I will be California sober until at least my 21st birthday because I am so embarrassed and traumatized from puking up straight alcohol. I don’t want to be thought of as the girl with X’s on her hands who got wasted and threw up at the club, especially because I know that the alcohol itself wasn’t the reason I threw up but rather the albeit still irresponsible circumstances I was drinking in.

Because of my severe executive dysfunction I have incredibly low energy and I'm laying down in my bed or on the couch more than 90% of the day, the other 9% is just sitting up in a chair when eating (even sitting up is tiring to me) and only 1% of the day I'm standing up.

Whenever I stand up, blood rushes to my head and it feels like an exhaustive headache standing for more than a minute, but another thing I notice is that I sweat incredibly easily while standing. Things like waiting in a line for more than a minute or just standing while cooking or making coffee causes me to start sweating a lot.

This is a relatively new symptom that started in 2022 but has gotten worse. I'm not overweight, but I am obviously incredibly sedentary (likely because of the low energy itself as a negative cycle). 


Any advice on what causes this incredibly low energy and how to fix it? Has anybody else have or had this issue?

I've tried exercise but it doesn't seem to make it work and it's been getting harder to exercise because I have less and less energy and I have never been consistent with anything in my life.

Could low sunlight exposure from a nocturnal sleep cycle cause this? But why the excessive sweating?

Denture wearers often wonder about maintaining a bright, radiant smile. Dental aesthetics play a crucial role in boosting confidence and making a lasting impression. While natural teeth can be easily whitened, denture teeth present a unique challenge that many people struggle to understand. Dentures are made from specialized materials that respond differently to traditional whitening methods, requiring specific care and attention. This comprehensive guide will explore the possibilities, limitations, and best practices for keeping your denture teeth looking clean, fresh, and as white as possible. Click here to learn more: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com

Understanding Denture Materials and Whitening Challenges

Dentures are typically made from acrylic resin or porcelain, materials that do not respond to traditional whitening treatments like natural teeth. Unlike tooth enamel, these materials have a non-porous surface that prevents standard bleaching agents from penetrating and changing their color. This fundamental difference means that conventional whitening methods used for natural teeth simply won't work on dentures.

Key Challenges for Denture Whitening:
- Non-porous surface material
- Inability to absorb traditional bleaching agents
- Risk of damaging denture structure with harsh chemicals
- Potential for discoloration over time

Click here to learn more: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com

Professional Cleaning vs. At-Home Whitening Methods

While traditional whitening isn't possible, denture wearers have several options to maintain a bright appearance. Professional dental cleaning remains the most effective method for keeping dentures looking their best. Dental professionals use specialized cleaning techniques and tools that can safely remove stubborn stains and restore the denture's original brightness.

At-home methods can complement professional cleaning:
1. Ultrasonic denture cleaners
2. Specialized denture cleaning solutions
3. Gentle brushing with non-abrasive cleaners
4. Soaking in approved denture-whitening solutions

Preventing Discoloration: Proactive Maintenance Strategies

Prevention is always better than cure when it comes to denture maintenance. Certain lifestyle choices and daily habits can significantly impact the appearance of your dentures. **Avoiding staining substances** like coffee, red wine, and tobacco can help maintain their original color.

Effective Prevention Techniques:
- Rinse dentures after eating
- Clean dentures daily
- Use a soft-bristled brush
- Avoid hot water, which can warp dentures
- Store dentures properly when not in use

Click here to learn more: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com

Common Mistakes to Avoid

Many denture wearers inadvertently damage their dental appliances while attempting to whiten them. Harsh chemicals, abrasive materials, and incorrect cleaning techniques can cause permanent damage. Bleach, household cleaners, and whitening toothpaste should never be used on dentures.

Potential Risks of Improper Cleaning:
- Surface scratches
- Material degradation
- Weakened denture structure
- Increased bacterial growth
- Potential health hazards

Professional Recommendations and Expert Advice

Dental professionals consistently recommend a tailored approach to denture care. Regular check-ups, professional cleanings, and personalized maintenance plans can help preserve the appearance and functionality of your dentures. **Consult your dentist** for specific guidance tailored to your unique dental needs.

Emerging Technologies and Future Solutions

The dental industry continues to evolve, with ongoing research into advanced denture materials and cleaning technologies. Future innovations may provide more effective whitening solutions specifically designed for denture wearers. Staying informed about these developments can help you maintain optimal dental aesthetics.

Conclusion

Whitening denture teeth requires a nuanced approach that prioritizes gentle, professional care over aggressive treatments. While traditional whitening methods won't work, a combination of professional cleaning, proper maintenance, and preventative strategies can keep your dentures looking bright and clean. By understanding the unique characteristics of denture materials and following expert recommendations, you can maintain a confident, radiant smile that looks and feels natural.",1,1735803550.0,Teethgumhealth,0,1.0,False

Interesting!  And a little bit embarrassing...  some of my spending did not reflect my values of being frugal and a good steward of the resources I have.  

So for 2025…

I will not spend $1384 on fast food (that’s an average of >7 hamburger meals a month!). 😬

I will watch my subscription “creep” which is $23/month more than 2023 and I will take a Netflix break when the weather gets better.

I will be more mindful of my coffee out purchases which totalled $520 last year.

And lastly, I’ll make sure I use my VISA at least every 90 days as that saves me $48/year in bank fees with a “multi product fee credit”.  I could have saved this just by shifting my spending pattern a teensy bit. 🙄

Anyone else have some low hanging fruit savings they are implementing for 2025?  

Happy New Year!🎉

I'm planning on getting the DF54 as my first coffee grinder, but a few posts and youtube videos I've seen show coffee grains going all over the place (is that static?) which is quite unacceptable to me because cleaning the place would be a nightmare.

Yet, some people say that it's not an issue, there's no static (and no mess) if you clean the grinder weekly.

So wanted feedback from the owners, how bad is it? does weekly cleaning fix it?

I want to share my own take on a hypothetical ending.

  
Never Have I Ever: The Hypothetical Ending

It has been four years since the ending of season four. Ben and Devi has recently gone through a very emotional split after the realizations that their relationship is not going to work out coupled with the stress of college and their careers getting to them. To cope with the breakup, Devi tries drugs to cope with the emotions of the breakup, but she unfortunately overdoses and ends up in the hospital.

Devi wakes up in her hospital bed. Bored, she decides to take a walk around the hospital. Suddenly, she hears a very familiar voice. It is Paxton. The two haven't seen each other in ages, and they catch up on each other's lives. Paxton has recently moved to New Jersey, after he received the offer to become a teacher of a prestigious private high school. He is here to visit one of his friends who has become a doctor.

Outside of the hospital, Ben parks his car and paces towards the building. He has very conflicting feeling about going in, and feels responsible for Devi’s issues, because he thinks if they had not broken up, Devi would not have gotten into drugs. He could not bear the embarrassment of seeing her. He bumps into Nalini, Eleanor and Fabiola, who are exiting the hospital after paying Devi a visit. Ben talks about his guilt, and Devi's mom and two best friends convinces him to face Devi.

Ben is ready to make up to Devi. As he waits in line at the cafe to buy Devi a sandwich and a coffee, he sees her and Paxton chatting at a table. His heart sinks once again as he watches from a distance, thinking that Devi has slipped away from him once again into Paxton. On the drive home, he hopes and wishes that Paxton can heal Devi from everything she has gone through and be the one to her.

Ben, left broken, begins to spiral in all aspects of life in the following months, social-wise, and career-wise. He is dropped from college, loses all his friends, and parties all the time to take his mind off of everything. Eventually, he can no longer recognize himself from the Ben he once was. This life has haunted him so much, he decides to move to a small, remote town far away to escape from his pain.

Devi, on the other hand, remains weak for months as she enters drug rehab. However, Paxton becomes her mental anchor throughout this difficult time. Devi realizes that Paxton, who has found his purpose in life, and become happy, successful, and more mature than ever, essentially represented what Ben was. Paxton and Devi rekindles their relationship, and they eventually marry in a ceremony years later. However, as the years go by, Devi never truly loves Paxton for who he is, only for the ghost of Ben she sees in him.

It has been decades, and no one has ever heard of Ben. His family has cut all contact with him after his downward spiral that ruined his career. In the small town he has been living in for the past years, the winds blows by on the fall night, and the streets remains only illuminated by signs. An elderly Ben visited the usual convenience store he goes to, purchased two bottles of whiskey, travels to a rooftop, and opens a bottle. Suddenly, another elderly man appears beside him, and they talk about life. For the first time in decades, Ben opens up about his past and how much he regrets not being there for Devi when he needed to. Tears well from his eyes.

Dutch Bros smoothies present a complex nutritional profile that requires careful consideration. While they can be a tasty treat, they shouldn't be viewed as a health food.

Context: 

Argument #1 : This morning, 9AM, inaya ko sya sa isang local coffee shop para makapag usap kami with privacy. Wala talaga syang idea. Una ko inopen up yung nangyari nung Dec 27 na binilhan sya ng present ng manang ko to which she replied ""hindi naman ako nagpapabili"" defended my manang telling na yung actions nya ay genuine dahil aside from her, ganun naman sya sa lahat ng tao. Sabi ko sa 2 yrs namin na relasyon, minahal sya ng manang ko dahil pamilya na ang turing sa kanya. 

Her response #1 : Hindi sya nasanay na may ganung kabait na tao at feeling nya lahat ng kabutihang pinapakita sa kanya ay may kapalit, and besides, hindi nya daw need pakisamahan ang manang ko dahil hindi sya ang karelasyon. 

Argument #2 : Sinabi ko na bakit hindi? E pamilya ko sila. I would accept her xplanation kung pangit ang trato sa kanya kaso hindi naman. Also, hindi nya need ""makisama"". Maging mabuti lang dapat syang tao dahil yun naman talaga dapat. At may mga tao na likas na mabuti. 

Her response #2: Meron daw syang survival skills. Isa na dun ang pakikiramdam kung may hidden agenda ang isang tao. 

Argument #3: Sabi ko, survival saan? Hindi naman survival grounds ang pamilya namin. I understand na you don't have to let your guard down kahit saan, pero pucha, ilugar mo naman ang survival skills mo. (this is funny by the way)

At iniisa isa ko sa kanya yung mga ginagawa ng manang ko sa kanya. Kahit yung mama ko. 

I am trying to be patient, love this person for 2 yrs at normal na umasa ako na baka may redeeming factor. Pero this statement of hers is where I lost it. ""Manang mo na lang asawahin mo"" I was super disaappointed, betrayed, and hurt. 

Nagpaalam na ako sa kanya and bid my goodbye. Ayoko na. Obviously, it did not end well. I offered na ihatid ko sya pauwi pero mag bbook na lang daw sya ng angkas. 

On my way home, I realized na tama yung desisyon ko just basing sa mga replies nya. I understand the trauma pero hindi pwedeng ibang tao ang mag suffer nun para sa kanya. Trauma can really change a person and I hope she heals from it. 

2pm, I received a chat from her to which she said, she'd try to change the way she looks at my manang. Nag reply ako na ""hindi ko aasawahin si manang pero mag aasawa ako ng katulad nya"". 

She blocked me. 

Thank you so much po sa mga insights nyo. I'd talk to my manang tomorrow and tell her break na kami ni gf because our values doesn't allign with each other. HNY!",76,1735802265.0,adviceph,21,1.0,False

1hro34x,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_KaylorTing/comments/1hro34x/weekly_blog_9_treatment_preparation/,Weekly Blog 9: Treatment Preparation,"What’s up guys! We’re back with another blog where I dive into a topic to increase awareness, educate, and open discussion about common topics of integration and ketamine therapy. This week’s topic is on the importance of treatment preparation. 

This is the beginning of your healing journey. A time to put on a pair of headphones and an eye mask to dive into your own world and sit with your thoughts. Can you think of the last time you did that? Probably never! The invitation is to: increase self awareness, to build the best relationship you’ll ever have (the one with yourself), and to step into one of your greatest superpowers (the ability to heal yourself). 

First things first, do your research on ketamine and what it does to the brain. Understand the science so you can better trust what’s going into your body. Next, I highly recommend having a program to follow along with, whether it’s a built in curriculum, or some other therapy like traditional talk therapy, EMDR, or TMS. Integration is also crucial so be sure to schedule an appointment around your 3rd full dose session. This will help you set the waypoint as to where you want to go.

Music: Once you’ve gotten familiar with ketamine and what it does, next you’ll want to download Spotify and have music playlists to listen to. Anywhere Clinic has a bunch of great playlists to explore (https://open.spotify.com/user/31udfbv5ahbd67wkwfgzf37xrbfe?si=9f0633c785af4b10v). Remember, music is the architect of your journey so be sure to listen to something calm, inspiring, or peaceful. You’ll also want to sign up for premium so you don’t get a random Geico or Crest commercial mid session. Not fun. Don’t worry, Spotify will give you a free trial for 90 days so you won’t have to worry about paying anything upfront. Use it for the duration of your sessions and just cancel it after. Boom. Lastly, be sure to turn on crossfade so that your transitions between songs are seamless. Sometimes the pause or break can throw us out of the zone so crossfade can help to keep us in the flow. You can find that under the playback tab in settings. 

Safety Protocols: On the day of your session be sure to fast at least 3-4 hours before your session and avoid liquids about an hour or 2 before as well. This will increase the absorption rate, decrease the chances of nausea, and keep you from having to use the restroom mid session. Keep in mind the BIGGEST concern with at- home ketamine is falling so staying put until your session is over is muy importante. 🤌🏽

A few things you’ll want to note is that alcohol, marijuana, stimulants, and benzos can counteract the medicine significantly. So just be mindful of use day of. I, however, hate taking coffee from people so if you’re going to have it, do it in the morning and have your session at night, you’ll be just fine.

Materials: So as far as materials go here’s the checklist:

	•	Headphones (Noise-canceling are obviously the best)
	•	Eye mask
	•	Journal/Pen
	•	Cup - If spitting. *** Note: ingesting will increase the chances of nausea significantly, increase the duration of the session and intensify the psychedelic experience.
	•	Peer monitor - they don’t have to be in the room with you. Just the vicinity in case you need help/support, or need to get to the restroom. Btw there’s no shame in crawling.
	•	Option: Zofran nausea medication- take 30 minutes before.

Dose and Frequency:

So your provider may have mentioned to start low and go slow. The first 2 sessions are usually an acclimation dose to get your feet wet. Don’t blast off immediately into the ketaverse. Most likely they mentioned to start at 100mg or half of a troche and increase by half until you get to 2 full troches. But note that if you find yourself getting great results before then, there’s no need to push it to the “full dose”. Everyone is different. Don’t be discouraged if you don’t have a psychedelic experience right away. It’s not directly related to the efficacy. The real results will usually show up days following so you’ll want to notice things like your responses to triggers and self-talk. Those are two key indicators that ketamine is doing its job. Also note that it can take anywhere from 6-8 sessions, sometimes longer to get a full neurobiological level reset. So be patient and remain consistent at least one to two times a week. Remember if you’re doing a session twice a week you’ll want to have at least 3-4 days in between so you’re not building a tolerance too quickly and you’re giving the medicine a chance to do its job.

The absorption phase:
    Last but not least we’ve reached the fun part; absorption. Set and setting is very important. Mindset and the space you create around you can determine the energy of your journey. So if you had a tough day it’s ok to postpone your session till later. When it comes to setting, have comfortable pillows, furry blankets or whatever you can use to create a safe space to surrender and let go. I don’t recommend lighting candles. I’d like to prevent panic attacks mid-session… Speaking from experience btw. But if you want aroma therapy, try essential oils in a diffuser. When you’re ready, take the troches, put them in your mouth while sitting upright, set your timer for no longer than 15-20 minutes. You’ll then start to chew the troches with the front teeth until they liquify. Swish it around for the remainder of the time, but DO NOT SWALLOW. You’re going to look like a chipmunk by the end of this. And look, I get it, not the greatest taste but we don’t take medicine because it tastes good. Plus your bitter receptors numb after 2-3 minutes so you won’t notice it. Distract yourself by journaling, SETTING YOUR INTENTION, and listen to something relaxing. I personally like to watch nature videos on YouTube (https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7f6qA8zt9de2zEzFta52OU8v26PyAckM&si=HRUzu1d0Uf3nPVS8). Once the timer is up you’ll either spit or swallow, put your headphones in, start your playlist, eye mask on, lay back flat and take your journey. Remember to breathe, trust the experience, let go/surrender/observe, and be open to whatever comes up. Safe travels everyone and I wish for you a wonderful healing journey! ❤️‍🩹✨

I do plan to get a zp6 for clear light roasts as well.

I currently have a stock encore and a hario switch. I usually  like to order a light and a medium roast from black and white, onyx, etc. I don't care too much about espresso at all.  My budget is around maybe 200usd and have been considering a k6 or a k plus.

But since stopping those last meds I’ve been finding it impossible to get up. Idk if it’s related, the timing is the same but equally things don’t just change like *that* as it’s still in my body and whatnot after I stop taking them. Hm. Anyway. 

It’s nice waking up at mum and dads, I get greeted in such a welcoming way every single morning. I get pups leaping at me and wanting to play and cuddle and then I walk out into the living room and say “good morning” and I get mum with a big *heeeeelllloooooo!” and dad with the “morning darling” and idk, it’s just quite nice. I also like being called darling and sweetheart and all of that, I can’t wait til Andy will call me lil pet names and things, I think I underestimate how much I love being called affectionate terms. 

I feel like I am once again seeing ‘ins & outs’ for 2025 on here and in brand emails? Like why? I’m guessing it’s a trend on social media, I think that’s a fairly obvious guess. Anyway I wanna do some of my own. 

**Ins:**
- Consistency, perhaps think of it more as devotion than discipline 
- Patience with my goals and outcomes 
- Being outside every day
- Being creative! Painting, clay, drawing, piano, writing, cooking etc. 
- Solo dates to get out & about more as well as do things I want to do eg go to the library, go to an exhibition, go for brunch, go shopping whatever
- Being informed
- Gardening 
- Taking my vitamins! Every day! 
- Curiosity - eg if a question comes to mind, which they always do, look it up! Read further! 
- Flossing daily 
- Daily breaks to focus on my breathing and to destress
- Reading more varied genres
- Cuddles with puppy 
- Financial literacy, stop being such a moron and learn

**Outs:**
- Putting pressure on myself 
- Sachet coffee 
- Low self esteem/depression driven shopping 
- Over applying lip balm 
- Cluttered inboxes / notes app etc 
- Not taking my affirmations seriously 
- Feeling & looking unkempt 
- Being totally tech illiterate 
- Being tired 
- Wearing the same makeup & perfume all the time, I have an f tonne of both so play with them! 
- Indecisiveness 
- Letting work stress affect me so much
- Greasy feeling moisturiser
- Complaining

Okay that’ll do. I should probably write them somewhere I’ll remember/see them, no? Maybe I can write them on some pretty paper and stick them to my mirror :) 

Yay I have a brow appointment booked for tomorrow :) No lashes, I decided against them as I don’t want to harm my lashes and I feel like they’re a bit iffy since my allergickyness - maybe the moisturiser I was putting on them? Idk but I want to nourish and care for them for awhile before doing anything like a lash lift. I have my serum! I haven’t used my lash or brow serum yet, basically because I’ve been allergicky, but my antihistamines are helping lotssssss so I shall continue with them. Anyway so mum and I will go in the morning and I’m going to hoooopefully get her to take me to the garden centre and we can plant some plants in some pots! Fun! Maybe! I want some plants. I’m excited to see how my lavender is doing, I’m willing to bet one trillion dollars that the weeds have taken over but mum can help me tomorrow, I even have my new weeding tool I got for Christmas. I think in my pots I would like to plant some cosmos, I thought the one I got at Christmas looked so pretty. Hm. 

I love that photo of my honey on Christmas Day so much. I just love *him* so much. Babyyyyyy. 

I’ve really not done a lot today. Made a frittata, took pups for a walk, did some bits around the house for my parents, read a bit and looked at stuff online. This summer isn’t as productive as I planned but oh well.

1hrnw9n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hrnw9n/lab_partner_harassing_me_after_quarter_has_ended/,Lab partner harassing me after quarter has ended ,"I’ve been recently getting inappropriate texts from my physics lab partner. I met him this fall quarter at my school, and he’s been mostly pleasant towards me. Sometimes he can be a little erratic and get upset easily, so I try to be kind to him. 

An example of this was when we were choosing lab partners the first day, and he assumed I would be his lab partner since I was sitting next to him. I wanted to ask the guy behind me since I knew him from previous courses. He looked at me really upset and told the professor that he has no lab partner because I left him and agreed to be partners with someone else. After various back and forth conversations, I ended up being his lab partner the rest of the quarter.

There were other times where he would get upset very simple things such as spilling things. I would clean this up because it was really no big deal and they were minor spills. He would also be upset if I didn’t understand a step in the lab procedures and would continuously belittle me a majority of the lab period. 

Towards the end of the quarter, he was extremely upset about his grades, and I felt bad because I scored higher on the lab exam. I told him I can help him talk to our professor if he wants and he agreed. He explained to me that he was having a lot of difficulty adjusting to a new country and also working long hours that he couldn’t focus much on his studies. I told him that it’s ok and that maybe next quarter will be a lot better because there’s only so much he can do. 

I thought the conversation would end but sometime later he invited me to get coffee at his new job he was working at, but I declined. He insisted I at least come to get a desert there. I explained to my partner the situation and how it put me in a difficult situation considering how much this guy has gone through and how he left his old job not too long ago. My partner and I ended up going to the bakery and grabbing a desert there. 

Afterwards he texted me that he hoped I liked the desert, and I said thank you. I thought the conversation would end there and we would just have a professional relationship with the occasional greetings if we pass by each other.

However, it began to escalate a lot. He started to ask me how I was doing and personal questions. I told my partner this was making me anxious, and he understood and comforted me. I started to reply dryly to the guy. He has begun to flirt with me and ask inappropriate questions. He even has asked me if I’m married. My partner and I are high school sweethearts, but not engaged since we’re still young. I told the guy no I was not and that this was really weird and uncomfortable for me that he asked this. I showed my partner these texts and he told me he could talk to the guy because I was starting to feel anxious and panicked that this guy is harassing me.

I reassured my partner that I can handle this. I thought it would end there after the guy saw how uncomfortable I was, but he told me that he thought I was married because he saw my ring and thought it was cute. He doesn’t know my partner got this for me, but he has seen my partner and I together. I mentioned my partner during class as well when I’m having small talk.

I’m not sure what to do about this and how to respond to this inappropriate text about my ring anymore because he doesn’t seem to be backing off. I’m scared he might get provoked and retaliate against me. 

A lot of those close to me have faced domestic violence, harassment, and etc. I also had an ex in the past try to hit me. He was emotionally abusive, and whenever I angered him he would threaten me. He would tell me things like “don’t let this happen again” or “why don’t you ever listen”. Luckily my current partner is caring and compassionate and the total opposite of this person. I try to be cautious around men because of this, and I’m really scared I might provoke this guy and he might retaliate against me at school.",2,1735800737.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

So I got a coffee machine like this for chrismas, and I'm really liking it (before that I only drank soluble coffee, so yeah, better coffee is life changing), and there is a cappuccino/latte option, where it sucks some milk into the machine to steam it, but you can also just ask milk, and you'll have a full mug of steamed milk.

I used that to make hot chocolate for my wife, but when I stir to mix the chocolate powder, all the beautiful milk foam ""disappears"", so I was wondering if anyone know if I can safely put chocolate powder in the milk tank, or if this will damage the part that steams the milk.

# Personal Experience (Through Jackie’s Eyes)

Jackie, my neighbor’s mom, has always been the go-to person for natural health advice in our community. 

When I mentioned I was researching [Gluco Extend](https://theworldhealth.org/gluco-extend-official), she lit up and told me she had been using it for a few months. Curious to hear her thoughts, I asked her to share her experience.

Jackie explained that after struggling with fluctuating blood sugar levels and constant fatigue, she decided to give **Gluco Extend** a try.

Within a couple of weeks, she noticed a marked improvement in her energy and found herself reaching for fewer sugary snacks—a win-win for both her health and her pantry budget.

She also appreciated the simplicity of the supplement: just a couple of capsules with her morning coffee, and she was good to go.

However, she did mention one small hiccup. The first few days brought a bit of stomach upset, but this faded quickly as her body adjusted.

Overall, she was thrilled with the results and even recommended it to a few of her friends at her weekly yoga class. Hearing her story firsthand only reinforced my belief in the product’s effectiveness.

Are there any features that make one better than the other?

How do they perform in practice? If anyone has experience with either or both models, I’d love to hear your thoughts.

1hrnin3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1hrnin3/my_cousin_falls_asleep_at_the_dinner_table_almost/,My cousin falls asleep at the dinner table almost every night,"My cousin (65F) lives alone with her two dogs. For years now, she falls asleep almost every night at the dinner table. The obvious reasons for this are her chronic sleep deprivation (her typical sleep schedule is 3am to 11am but the dogs always wake her up at 8am to have breakfast and then she goes back to sleep), the fact that she eats dinner around midnight, and the cup of chocolate milk that she has with dinner doesn’t help. She falls asleep once she’e eaten the majority of her meal. I know sleepiness after eating is common. 

The reason I am posting here, is because sometimes she will hit her forehead on the table as she is falling asleep or when she falls asleep. Shouldn’t that wake her up? She says she will sometimes get bruises on her forehead. Once when I was staying at her house, I woke up at 3am and walked into the dining room to see her sitting in front of her empty dinner plate, asleep, forehead on the table right in front of her plate, arms dangling at her sides. She had a red mark on her forehead when I woke her up, but it didn’t bruise. But why isn’t hitting her head when she falls asleep waking her up? Is there something else at play here besides the obvious answer that she is tired after eating dinner at midnight?

Sometimes she will just be slumped over to one side of the chair (knees to the side so kinda leaning against the back of the chair), and other times she’ll be sitting normally in the chair and slumped over with her head dangling, but she doesn’t hit the table. 

She takes medication at night, after dinner. So she falls asleep right before she is suppose to take her meds. Not sure what they are all for. I know one is an antidepressant. I’m not sure what health issues she has besides depression. She used to be pre-diabetic but isn’t anymore after eating a healthier diet (but yes, the chocolate milk every night has remained and she refuses to give it up). She doesn’t drink soda, coffee, or alcohol. She is slightly overweight, I’m guessing 160lbs and 5’9”. ",24,1735799189.0,AskDocs,2,1.0,False
