This morning I met him with coffee in a flask, a hot sandwich and food for later in the day for his night shift. He ate this, and I had nothing, we spent 3 hours together at the beach. I had only water which I packed myself, so he basically took care of nothing. We later went to get groceries for his place. He bought what he wanted for his place. He did not offer me a drink, nothing at all but actually got himself a sweet. I am worried he is too selfish as he is accustomed to me bringing him food for all our dates at the beach.

My hubby and I (37) recently moved to Merville from our hometown, Nanaimo, and I‚Äôm hoping to meet a few rad gals to hang out with! I‚Äôd love some company for hikes with my dog, Finnagan, and to explore more of the northern part of the Island since it‚Äôs still pretty new to me.

I‚Äôm into camping, fishing, dirt biking, swimming‚Äîpretty much anything outdoors. I also love chasing sunsets, coffee dates, and good food (whether cooking at home or going out for dinner).

I have been doing a deep dive on manual lever espresso setups for the past couple weeks and I think I would like to move forward and purchase something. I‚Äôm not sure if I can afford brand new gear, so I was hoping to find a good place to pick up a secondhand kit. 

My research says that for the most traditional Italian espresso (sweet, creamy, full body) I would need to get a flare 58x with a Kinu M47 grinder. 

My one and only goal is to get the most traditional Italian style espresso shot. So my gear can be lacking in other departments.  I‚Äôm not worried about filter coffee, or light roasts. Just looking for creamy med-dark roast sweet espresso shots. 

I have 3 main questions:
1)Are my research results accurate? 
2)Is there a place where I can by second hand gear such as a flair 58 and kinu m47 grinder?
3)Can I achieve similar results with other presses or grinders that may be more affordable? 

Thanks for the advise!

So, after months of lurking (and a handful of half-written posts), I'm finally taking the plunge and giving this a shot. I know they say the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, but in my case, it begins with a second post. So, here goes nothing, right? Haha.

**What am I looking for?**

In a nutshell‚Äîauthentic, meaningful conversation. A while ago, a few other faculty members and I met up for an evening out to celebrate the start of the semester. A few of us stayed pretty late, pontificating about life, talking about the most random topics, and basically just enjoying each other's company. I don't know about you, but in today's world (where so many of us are glued to Zoom screens and remote work), we need more of that sort of dynamic‚Äîjust genuine, authentic, long-form discourse. I like to believe with the right sort of person (and the right sort of conversational skills), you can cultivate that sort of vibe in online conversation.

For example, when I think back to the past, one of my favorite memories was a lengthy conversation I had with a random stranger at a cozy little coffee shop in a small town in Upstate New York. We talked about everything from philosophy to the best type of coffee beans. That's the sort of conversation I crave!

**A bit about me:**

* I'm 34, male, and teach in higher education.
* I finished my doctorate a few years ago (Finally! I can now add ""doctor"" to my name without having to prescribe anything or perform surgery, haha ‚Äî although that dissertation was brutal, just sayin').
* I love the outdoors and often take local day trips to explore new trails and scenic spots.
* I have a passion for photography, always trying to capture that perfect shot.
* Journaling and poetry are my ways of reflecting and expressing my thoughts, even if my poems often end up sounding like Dr. Seuss after too much coffee.
* Long hikes are my therapy. Nature has a way of putting things into perspective.
* I have a knack for making terrible puns. Consider yourself warned.
* I like to pretend I'm a trivia night enthusiast, though my knowledge of obscure 90s cartoons is more impressive than practical.
* I'm convinced that breakfast foods are acceptable at any time of the day. Pancakes for dinner, anyone?
* I‚Äôve been known to binge-watch documentaries about anything from space exploration to ancient civilizations.
* I‚Äôm a coffee enthusiast and love experimenting with different brewing methods and beans.
* I‚Äôm secretly training for the ‚ÄúOlympics of Procrastination,‚Äù and I‚Äôm a gold medal contender.
* I pride myself on my ability to parallel park in one go ‚Äì a skill I wish I could add to my r√©sum√©.
* My superpower is finding the perfect GIF for any situation.

**So basically...**

I'm hoping to find thoughtful interactions with folks who genuinely want to discuss all that life has to offer. I'm drawn to people with a natural zest and curiosity for life, who embrace a growth mindset, and who value emotional intelligence and strong communication skills.

**I feel like I'm really oblivious to some hints.**

He invited me to go to the gym with him, and I incited him out to go see an orchard which he said ""Honestly I would really like that,"" and we both talked about getting coffee together sometime.

We chat almost daily and he calls me bestie so idk if he's just being friendly even though he reacts to my messages with sparkling hearts or a face with hearts sometimes. And he'll send me pictures of stuff when he's out and about.

Opt info:  
I can be pretty oblivious most of the time and we mainly talk online, although when we're together we usually end up brushing against eachother with how close he gets whether it be sitting or walking. He's also been mentioning his taste in women more even though he only used to express that about other men.  
We're currently matching pfps on a platform we talk on, and while the two characters are rivals and he claimed he didn't know they were a ship the art is ship art that we're using.  
We talk about ships quite a bit and ones we like. On a game I matched my character with a character that is sometimes shipped with his despite being rivals, an randomly he mentioned how he liked those characters shipped.  
He once sent me a video with really sexual audio but when you see what's going on it's not, so idk if friends normally send that kind of stuff.

1muw6gg,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakingPoints/comments/1muw6gg/musks_favorability_now_is_below_netenyahus_gallup/,"Musk's favorability now is below Netenyahu's (Gallup); Tesla sunk further in Europe (-60%) despite EV being up. The Cybertruck is now outsold by both Hummer & Ford EV trucks in the US. However, Trump's bill is about to hit Tesla harder than we know.","Yes, waiting for the revamped Y model wasn't after all what caused customers to withhold from buying Teslas in Europe last year, the collapse in sales (-60%) continues with BYD soaring to new records in the continent. The Cybertruck, officially a flop at this point, is outsold by two EV trucks in the US, the same truck that supposedly had a million presales at one point. 

You can chalk all that up to brand damage and normal market forces before what Musk paid $300M for takes effect. Biden's EV subsidies subside this September, these applied to 85% of Tesla sales. As is the case in every market where these subsidies were withdrawn, EV demand is expected to collapse in the US after September furthering Tesla's woes; but expect an exceptional upcoming quarter due to a last-time customer rush to seize EVs at subsidized prices and expect a boom in the EV used car market afterwards. 

Trump's bill also withdraws the 30% credit on residential solar panels also dominated by Tesla in addition to other forms of governmental support that extend to Tesla's energy storage business. 

However, what's really going to devastate Tesla almost immediately is the carbon credits. These were free money, pure profits pouring into Tesla's coffers. How signficant? consider this; if Tesla had no carbon credits revenue during Q1 of this year, it would have reported a loss of $190M. These carbon credits were propping up Tesla's quarterly profits. Keep in mind almost 90% of those Carbon credits come from the US where they're expected to be slashed; Tesla stands to lose 30% of its profits in one go. 

So, what happened? why did Musk pay $300M for this? the answer is clear to me, he's an impulsive idiot who doesn't think nor study things through. He did the same with Twitter, he clearly had no idea what he was buying. Same happened here. 

Just like with Twitter, those in the know came in panic to Musk to relay how dire the bill is to Tesla's businesses. Musk, like on Twitter, had a 180-flip on Trump and his bill overnight. 

Trump being an irascible child, got back at Musk by adding subsidies to the already-heavily-subsidized oil industry ""Tesla's industrial rival"" and taxed wind and solar. Like streaming replacing cable and smart phones replacing regular phones, the clean energy market is an eventuality at this point, it is the rational customer choice, and Trump kneecapped it further over a personal gripe ceding so much ground to China in the race to secure a dominant share in the future market. After all, this is the man to whom you can offer a golden tribute to alter foreign policy, the man because of whom every American is paying much more for coffee cause Brazil is being mean to his buddy. 

Impulsive jejune egoes clash, American markets lose edge, the working-class suffers, but at least egomaniac gripes are soothed I guess. This is not an oligarchy, it's not malicious fascism either, it's unadulterated idiocracy. ",3,1755640045.0,BreakingPoints,0,0.8,False

[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/1s5UDTLoi9)

Hi again ‚Äî I originally posted about the long-standing tension with my mom, her hurtful comments toward my husband, and my struggle with whether to let her visit. Here‚Äôs the latest.

Quick recap for context:

‚Ä¢	My husband (28M) and I (27F) started dating in 2021, engaged in Dec 2023, married Oct 2024.

‚Ä¢	My relationship with my mom (61F) has been complicated for years due to her alcoholism, volatility, and lack of accountability.

‚Ä¢	She was minimally supportive during our wedding planning and made choices that hurt me.

‚Ä¢	At my twin sister‚Äôs destination wedding this year, my mom made multiple passive-aggressive comments ‚Äî including telling my sister that her wedding was ‚Äúso much better‚Äù than mine. My husband heard it, I didn‚Äôt.

‚Ä¢	After the trip, my husband and I agreed she would no longer be welcome to stay in our home. Since April, we‚Äôve had very limited contact.

The recent conversation:

I finally called my mom to talk about it. She immediately denied saying anything hurtful and essentially called my husband a liar. We went back and forth, and she eventually agreed to call and apologize to him directly. She asked for his work schedule, I gave it to her, and she said she‚Äôd call.

Then, instead of following through, she texted saying she wanted a three-way call instead ‚Äî reframing the situation as a ‚Äúmisunderstanding‚Äù or ‚Äúrelay of communication.‚Äù I told her clearly this wasn‚Äôt about miscommunication ‚Äî it was about words that were said and how they made us feel. What we needed first was ownership and an apology.

Her reply was that she‚Äôs ‚Äúbeen accused of speaking without thinking‚Äù and now wants to talk with her sister (my aunt) before speaking with us again. She said she‚Äôll let us know when she‚Äôs ready.

The unexpected twist:

The day after my mom said she wanted to talk with my aunt before speaking to us again, my aunt texted me out of the blue:

‚ÄúCall me when you have a minute to talk. No one knows I am reaching out to you so please don‚Äôt mention it.‚Äù

I called her, and we had an incredibly validating conversation. She‚Äôs been through almost the exact same dynamic with their mom and with my mom ‚Äî constant comparisons, disapproval of her spouse, judgment about her life choices. She told me my mom has never taken genuine accountability or given a real apology, and likely never will. She encouraged me to stop chasing approval, keep my focus on my marriage, and keep any interactions with my mom surface-level and drama-free.

Later in the call, I told her that my mom had said she wanted to speak with her before reaching out to us again. The very next morning, my aunt texted me:

‚ÄúYour mom talked to me when we were having coffee this morning. I will call you later today to let you know what we discussed. I didn‚Äôt tell her that you and I talked yesterday nor did I start the conversation ‚Äî she did.‚Äù

When she called later, she gave my husband the lowdown on what we‚Äôd discussed the day before and shared what my mom had said. At one point, my mom apparently asked my aunt if she should apologize to us ‚Äî and my aunt told her no, because she believed it wouldn‚Äôt be genuine anyway.

Where Things Stand Now:

Despite my aunt‚Äôs advice, my mom still texted both my husband and me in a group chat asking when my husband had time this week to talk‚Äîafter putting us off with excuses multiple times. At that point, my husband (28M) was fully done. He doesn‚Äôt want to keep going in circles, and I don‚Äôt blame him.

For me, it‚Äôs sad to accept that my mom may never be the type to take real accountability or give a genuine apology. I know it‚Äôs going to take me some time to heal and move forward, but I also know that low contact (at least for now) is best for my mental health and for my marriage.

I‚Äôll be focusing on my life with my husband, keeping boundaries in place, and leaning on my aunt and of course my husband for support when I need it. If anything changes, I‚Äôll update again.

Thanks to everyone who encouraged me through this‚Äîit‚Äôs been hard, but I finally feel like I‚Äôm putting us first.",5,1755639916.0,raisedbynarcissists,3,1.0,False

Short intro: male, 30 y/o, 175cm, 60kg

I had only one symptom: **itching**. Some of you probably know how crazy it feels‚Ä¶ **whole body itching, from top to bottom, for 15‚Äì30 minutes, up to 4 times a day.** My triggers were anything that made my body **warm** \- workout, sex, stress, even cleaning the house or warm weather. Basically, anything that **sped up blood circulation.** So my social life was completely broken.

It was honestly **hell.**

How I healed (it was a complex approach):

1. **Diet** ‚Äì for 2 years, I ate only **fresh** food, freshly prepared. I eliminated: fermented foods (cheese, dry meats/fruits, etc.); all seafood (I live far from the ocean); tomatoes, nuts, bananas, strawberries, some others veggies/berries; chocolate, sweets with trans fats, sauces, eggs, alcohol (beer, wine, scotch), tea and coffee; basically i was on a strict diet.
2. **DAO supplements** ‚Äì this was huge support. started with 30k HDU DaoHead - worked for \~3 months, but then the itch came back; switched to NaturDAO 1M HDU - 8 months, lowered frequency + intensity; then NaturDAO 1.5M HDU + vitamins/minerals (B-vitamins, zinc, vitamin C, etc.) - 7 months, much better results
3. **Gut healing** ‚Äì this made the biggest difference. Prebiotics for 6 months (to prepare the gut); then probiotics for \~9 months (to rebuild microbiome).
4. (Bonus) **stress reduction** \- last 6 months, I found a job I enjoy, lowered overall stress

**My take:** I think HIT started because my gut microbiome + immune system were **weak after years of antibiotics** for chronic sinusitis

Also, i think:  
from prebiotics + probiotics I had the best impact  
DAO was a great support for managing symptoms  
diet was important for giving my body a break

Now I feel normal again \^\_\^

PS> To anyone suffering: I know your pain. It‚Äôs hard, but it‚Äôs not forever. With time and the right approach, your body will heal. Don‚Äôt give up.",8,1755639899.0,HistamineIntolerance,4,1.0,False

Hi all,

Longtime lurker, first-time poster‚Äîback from our honeymoon and finally here to deliver the full report. We traveled through Southern Africa with¬†&Beyond, staying at four of their properties. 

TL;DR: the entire experience was very well executed, beautiful, and worth every dollar.

Here‚Äôs the breakdown.

* **Days 1‚Äì5:**¬†&Beyond Benguerra Island, Mozambique
* **Days 6‚Äì7:**¬†&Beyond Nxabega Okavango Tented Camp, Botswana
* **Days 8‚Äì10:**¬†&Beyond Sandibe Okavango Safari Lodge, Botswana
* **Days 11‚Äì13:**¬†&Beyond Sossusvlei Desert Lodge, Namibia

This was booked as a custom itinerary through &Beyond‚Äôs travel team, including bush flights, transfers, and all internal logistics. Seamless from start to finish.

***Benguerra Island***

Our trip began with five nights on Benguerra Island ‚Äî and honestly, we could have stayed forever. In fact, we‚Äôve already decided to return next year. The highlight of our stay was undoubtedly our butler, Helder. I can‚Äôt say enough about him, he truly made the entire experience exceptional.

We arrived by helicopter after flying into Villanculos. There were six of us in the chopper, with one couple dropped off at another resort (possibly Kisawa or Anantara). The aerial arrival was a spectacular way to kick off our stay.

**Accommodation:**  
We stayed in a Cabana, though our travel agent had originally booked us in a Casinha. We ultimately felt the upgrade wasn‚Äôt necessary ‚Äî both options seem wonderful, and I don‚Äôt think choosing one over the other would significantly impact your experience. My husband had specifically wanted a private plunge pool, but in the end, we didn‚Äôt use it once. What really stood out was the direct beach access from our room. The ocean was the perfect temperature this time of year, and we spent hours relaxing on the deck ‚Äî the outdoor furniture was exceptionally comfortable.

**Service & Activities:**  
Helder was simply top-notch, thoughtful, kind, funny, and attentive. We got to know him quite well, and he even taught us how to play¬†*Mbao*, a traditional local game. Each room has a game board, and I¬†*highly*¬†recommend learning how to play it‚Äôs so fun, we bought two carved wood boards to bring home.

Beyond Helder, the entire staff was warm, gracious, and professional. Each evening at dinner, the activities coordinator would come by our table to help us plan the next day. Here‚Äôs what we did:

* **Island Tour & Dune Walk:**¬†There are two versions ‚Äî a short tour and a more in-depth one. We did the full version, which provided great insight into the island and the investments being made by the company. The massive dune walk on the far side of the island was a highlight, with views of a freshwater lake home to flamingos and even crocodiles. Very cool.
* **Snorkeling:**¬†My Australian husband, who has snorkeled extensively across the Pacific, said it was the best he‚Äôs ever experienced.
* **Swimming with Horses:**¬†You can choose between a short and long version. We opted for the short one, which involved walking along the beach with the horses. It was lovely. The woman running the horse program was knowledgeable and clearly passionate. The long version covers more of their property of the island, it's more of a tour on horseback.
* **Massage:**¬†Irene (the masseuse) was absolutely phenomenal, easily a 15/10. One of the best massages I‚Äôve ever had.
* **Castaway Picnic:**¬†We took a 25-minute boat ride out to a remote sandbar where they had arranged a beautifully presented 3-course meal, complete with our favorite wines from the week ‚Äî a thoughtful touch. We spent a few hours there; it was magical.

**Food:**  
The food was outstanding, the best of the four properties we visited on this trip. Helder would ask where we‚Äôd like to eat each day and arranged everything, whether it was poolside, on the beach, or on our private deck. Each setup was beautifully done. The cuisine was familiar yet refined, not overly fancy, but every dish was prepared to perfection. The wine selection (all African) was impressive, with something for everyone.

***Nxabega Tented Camp***

We arrived at Nxabega via a short 30-minute flight from Maun, with one stop along the way to pick up guests and staff from another camp. When we landed, we disembarked alongside another couple who ended up becoming our fast friends, they were absolutely lovely!

One thing to note about &Beyond: you‚Äôre typically grouped for game drives with the guests you arrive with. Luckily for us, we really hit it off with our pair. By coincidence, they were doing the inverse of our itinerary ‚Äî three nights at Nxabega and two at Sandibe ‚Äî so we were able to reconnect at Sandibe later on. We asked to be paired with them again, and the team accommodated our request without hesitation. A small detail, but such a meaningful one.

**Accommodation:**  
The tents at Nxabega are stunning. While someone did mention they could use a light refresh, it in no way detracted from the beauty or comfort of the space. The beds were¬†incredibly¬†comfortable, and each night we returned to find a hot water bottle tucked in, such a thoughtful and cozy touch.

**Service & Activities:**  
The service at Nxabega is personal and warm, less polished than Benguerra, but in a way that felt right for a safari camp. Our butler, Kay, was friendly and attentive. It‚Äôs worth noting that the butlers here don't serve in quite the same hands-on role as they do at Benguerra, a distinction they explain upon arrival.

Even the transfer from the airstrip to the lodge felt like a mini game drive, a perfect introduction to Botswana. We arrived around 3:30 PM, had a quick tea, and by 4 PM were out on our first drive.

Our guide, LK, and our tracker, Ellie, were phenomenal, full of personality, fun banter, and deep knowledge. They had all the answers to all the questions. They made every drive feel like an adventure with friends. Nxabega is one of the few camps in the area with water deep enough for aquatic activities, which set it apart from Sandibe.

We opted for the¬†Mokoro¬†(traditional dugout canoe) experience, and it was beautifully serene until we ran into a young elephant bull who wanted to make sure we knew he was tough. It gave me quite the fright, but our Mekoro captain was so unphased. Upon returning to shore, the staff surprised us with a full gin bar (six varieties!) and snacks, knowing we were gin & tonic fans. It was such a thoughtful, customized touch.

The game drives themselves were everything we hoped for. I won‚Äôt wax poetic about the Okavango Delta ‚Äî if you‚Äôre considering it, you likely already know how magical it is. But just to give a sense of the rhythm:

* Wake-up call at 5:30 AM
* Coffee delivered to your tent at 6 (you pre-order your preferences the night before)
* Breakfast at 6:30
* Game drive begins at 7
* Mid-morning coffee/snack break around 11 (don‚Äôt skip the Amarula in your coffee! it's the African version of Bailey's)
* Return to camp for lunch at 12
* Afternoon tea at 3
* Second drive begins at 4
* Sundowner stop with cocktails and snacks
* Dinner served after returning to camp
* Then, off to bed

The schedule strikes a perfect balance between activity and rest, but can be grueling.

**Food:**  
Our first night featured a lively outdoor cookout with all the guests, a mix of local dishes and grilled favorites. It was a wonderful setting, though I found some dishes weren‚Äôt as hot as I‚Äôd prefer, likely a side effect of everyone socializing before sitting down.

Overall, the food at Nxabega was a bit hit or miss for me. The¬†lunches¬†were consistently excellent, always fresh, flavorful, and well-executed.¬†Dinners, on the other hand, sometimes fell a little flat.That said, our second night dinner, a private meal arranged by the pool for just the four of us (as we were the only remaining guests that night) ‚Äî was more about the company than the cuisine. The food wasn‚Äôt great, but the conversation and atmosphere made it a wonderful evening.

***Sandibe Safari Lodge***

After 2 nights we transferred from Nxabega to Sandibe. Sandibe is the preview Okavango Delta camp and when you arrive you can see why. Architecturally in the shape of a pangolin (which we did not get to stop while on our drives), it is very well done. Ultra-luxe but still down-to-earth. It‚Äôs hard to describe how next-level this place feels‚Äîit walks the line between modern design and immersive nature perfectly. As we were there, the region was starting to get water. Each day there was more and more water. It was amazing! I will say, I preferred the tented camp feel to the luxe lodge, but I still loved it!

The drive to the camp from the airstrip is much much longer at Nxabega (15 mins) than Sandibe where it is about 40 minutes. On this drive we saw many things we didn't get to see at Nxabega. It was amazing!

**Accommodation:**

The rooms are spectacular. So well constructed. Great attention to detail. I need not say anything else. It's all so beautiful.

**Service and Activities:**

Our guide, Bob and tracker, LK were amazing men. We invited them to dine with us on the second night and we we learned so much about them, and Botswana. The staff here has the most amazing working relationship. There were so many moments where I wanted to be included in the fun and jokes! It made me happy to see everyone enjoying themselves at work. Naomi our butler served in the same capacity as our butler, Kay, did at Nxabega. She was so beautiful in and out. I could not get enough of her. The schedule for drives is the same at Sandibe as at Nxabega.

**Food**:

I enjoyed the food here. Sandibe has an interactive kitchen so on the second day we were able to make customized pizzas which was a fun little touch. Dinners were tasty, despite being on the smaller size. I often found that I wanted more food. I wasn't starving at the end, but I could hav eaten more.

***Sossusvlei Desert Lodge***

We ended our trip with three nights at¬†Sossusvlei Desert Lodge, a surreal, almost otherworldly retreat deep in the Namibian desert. It truly felt like an oasis in the middle of nowhere.

After leaving Botswana, we flew into Namibia and spent one night in Windhoek at a charming hotel. For dinner, we walked across the street to a steakhouse, unbelievably affordable and¬†shockingly¬†good. The next morning, we took a short one-hour flight out to the lodge.

The lodge is truly remote. We arrived with another couple who, unfortunately, weren‚Äôt our cup of tea. It was a bit of a letdown, especially after the great connection we had with the couple from our previous stop. That said, we didn‚Äôt let it affect our experience, and we certainly don‚Äôt hold &Beyond responsible for guest pairings.

On our final day, we were scheduled to transfer to Walvis Bay for a quad-bike tour to see where the Atlantic Ocean meets the towering sand dunes ‚Äî something we‚Äôd been very excited about, it was also where we were needing to grab a flight from to the back to Johannesburg to get home. But nature had other plans: a torrential downpour grounded all flights. Instead, we endured a very bumpy five-hour ground transfer. Sadly, we missed the tour and didn‚Äôt get to see much of Walvis Bay.

Ironically, the rain cleared later that day, and it turned into the most breathtaking afternoon. Still, by then, all transfers had already been rerouted to ground travel, even for guests arriving that evening. It was a logistical hiccup, but unavoidable.

**Accommodation:**  
The rooms here are¬†absolutely spectacular, each one an architectural masterpiece, designed with impeccable taste and no expense spared. While the main lodge area is elegant and beautifully designed, the private suites are truly next-level. Ours was the furthest from the main lodge, which we actually appreciated for the added privacy. It became clear to us that the true luxury you're paying for at Sossusvlei is the¬†space, design, and setting.

**Service & Activities:**  
Our favorite part of the lodge experience was¬†Doreen, the manager. She was warm, professional, and HILARIOUS ‚Äî one of the best we encountered on the entire trip. I could rave about her for days.

That said, there was one off-putting moment: after Doreen‚Äôs lovely check-in, we sat down with the activities coordinator ‚Äî and the vibe shifted. She was¬†very¬†salesy, pushing extra-cost activities in a way that felt awkward and out of place. She even made multiple jokes about upselling, which didn‚Äôt land well. When you‚Äôre staying at a property of this caliber, you don‚Äôt expect to feel like you‚Äôre being pitched ‚Äî it cheapened the moment and didn‚Äôt reflect the rest of the experience.

Here are the activities we did:

* Game Drive near the Dunes:¬†A scenic and relaxing drive capped with sundowners and snacks ‚Äî very enjoyable.
* Big Daddy Dune Hike:¬†My husband tackled the massive dune while I opted out (it‚Äôs a 90-minute drive each way). The dune sits inside a busy national park, so expect lots of tourists, but he said the experience was well worth it ‚Äî challenging, but rewarding according to him
* ATV Dune Ride:¬†SO. MUCH. FUN. Easily one of the highlights of our time at the lodge.
* Spa Experience:¬†We did a full-body scrub and massage in a shared treatment room. I‚Äôd give mine an 8/10; my husband rated his a 5/10, seems like I lucked out with the better therapist.
* Stargazing with the In-House Astronomer:¬†A nice experience overall. The astronomer was knowledgeable and pleasant, but we both felt his delivery was a bit too technical right off the bat. We'd have preferred a more engaging, beginner-friendly approach | someone with a Bill Nye or Steve Irwin energy to make it more accessible and exciting.

Our guide,¬†KK, was great, warm, funny, and full of energy. He added a lot to the overall experience.

If you're on the fence about &Beyond or considering a multi-lodge African itinerary, I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate. They nailed every aspect.

[original post] https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/1s5UDTLoi9

Hi again. I originally posted about the long-standing tension with my mom, her hurtful comments toward my husband, and my struggle with whether to let her visit. Here‚Äôs the latest.

Quick recap for context:

‚Ä¢	My husband (28M) and I (27F) started dating in 2021, engaged in Dec 2023, married Oct 2024.

‚Ä¢	My relationship with my mom (61F) has been complicated for years due to her alcoholism, volatility, and lack of accountability.

‚Ä¢	She was minimally supportive during our wedding planning and made choices that hurt me.

‚Ä¢	At my twin sister‚Äôs destination wedding this year, my mom made multiple passive-aggressive comments ‚Äî including telling my sister that her wedding was ‚Äúso much better‚Äù than mine. My husband heard it, I didn‚Äôt.

‚Ä¢	After the trip, my husband and I agreed she would no longer be welcome to stay in our home. Since April, we‚Äôve had very limited contact.

The recent conversation:

I finally called my mom to talk about it. She immediately denied saying anything hurtful and essentially called my husband a liar. We went back and forth, and she eventually agreed to call and apologize to him directly. She asked for his work schedule, I gave it to her, and she said she‚Äôd call.

Then, instead of following through, she texted saying she wanted a three-way call instead ‚Äî reframing the situation as a ‚Äúmisunderstanding‚Äù or ‚Äúrelay of communication.‚Äù I told her clearly this wasn‚Äôt about miscommunication ‚Äî it was about words that were said and how they made us feel. What we needed first was ownership and an apology.

Her reply was that she‚Äôs ‚Äúbeen accused of speaking without thinking‚Äù and now wants to talk with her sister (my aunt) before speaking with us again. She said she‚Äôll let us know when she‚Äôs ready.

The unexpected twist:

The day after my mom said she wanted to talk with my aunt before speaking to us again, my aunt texted me out of the blue:

‚ÄúCall me when you have a minute to talk. No one knows I am reaching out to you so please don‚Äôt mention it.‚Äù

I called her, and we had an incredibly validating conversation. She‚Äôs been through almost the exact same dynamic with their mom and with my mom ‚Äî constant comparisons, disapproval of her spouse, judgment about her life choices. She told me my mom has never taken genuine accountability or given a real apology, and likely never will. She encouraged me to stop chasing approval, keep my focus on my marriage, and keep any interactions with my mom surface-level and drama-free.

Later in the call, I told her that my mom had said she wanted to speak with her before reaching out to us again. The very next morning, my aunt texted me:

‚ÄúYour mom talked to me when we were having coffee this morning. I will call you later today to let you know what we discussed. I didn‚Äôt tell her that you and I talked yesterday nor did I start the conversation ‚Äî she did.‚Äù

When she called later, she gave my husband the lowdown on what we‚Äôd discussed the day before and shared what my mom had said. At one point, my mom apparently asked my aunt if she should apologize to us ‚Äî and my aunt told her no, because she believed it wouldn‚Äôt be genuine anyway.

Where Things Stand Now:

Despite my aunt‚Äôs advice, my mom still texted both my husband and me in a group chat asking when my husband had time this week to talk‚Äîafter putting us off with excuses multiple times. At that point, my husband (28M) was fully done. He doesn‚Äôt want to keep going in circles, and I don‚Äôt blame him.

For me, it‚Äôs sad to accept that my mom may never be the type to take real accountability or give a genuine apology. I know it‚Äôs going to take me some time to heal and move forward, but I also know that low contact (at least for now) is best for my mental health and for my marriage.

I‚Äôll be focusing on my life with my husband, keeping boundaries in place, and leaning on my aunt and of course my husband for support when I need it. If anything changes, I‚Äôll update again.

Thanks to everyone who encouraged me through this‚Äîit‚Äôs been hard, but I finally feel like I‚Äôm putting us first.


TL;DR: I confronted my mom about her behavior, but she didn‚Äôt apologize and likely never will (confirmed by my aunt). My mom then tried to involve my husband again, but he‚Äôs done engaging. I‚Äôve decided to go low contact for my mental health, and while it‚Äôs sad, I know it‚Äôs what‚Äôs best.",13,1755639858.0,relationships,0,1.0,False
1muw1xu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Separation/comments/1muw1xu/some_potential_encouragement_for_you_guys_about/,Some potential encouragement for you guys about reconciliation,"For those of us who have hurt our spouses whether through infidelity or abuse and yet they still are willing to reconcile, I know that waiting on them to heal and trust you is a painful process.

I‚Äôm over 3 months into my separation with my wife. We have a 15 month old son and it‚Äôs excruciatingly slow as I have not seen my wife since May 14th. 

But a little encouragement that I got my therapist. Often times, the initial healing process/foundation of your relationship that includes emotional connection and trust takes time to build after trauma and hurt.

But once that has been built, your reconciliation can potentially accelerate from there. So maybe you and your spouse haven‚Äôt talked in like 6 months. But day he/she feels ready and reaches out and you guys get dinner or coffee and then begin to reconnect and then before you know it, maybe even 1-2 months later you guys are moving back in with each other. 

Now this is not a formula nor is it true for everyone but I did want to potentially offer some encouragement I got from my therapist. ",1,1755639756.0,Separation,0,1.0,False
1muw1on,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1muw1on/i_applied_burton_malkiels_investment_principles/,I applied Burton Malkiel's investment principles to AI prompting and now I make decisions like an economist,"I've been obsessed with ""A Random Walk Down Wall Street"" and realized Malkiel's market wisdom translates perfectly to AI prompts. 

It's like having a legendary economist analyze every life decision:

**1. ""What's the expected value versus the risk I'm taking here?""**

Pure Malkiel risk-return thinking. AI does the math on your choices.

> ""I'm considering leaving my job for a startup. What's the expected value versus the risk I'm taking here?"" 

Quantifies your gut feelings.

**2. ""What biases am I bringing to this decision?""**

Malkiel was obsessed with behavioral economics. AI spots your blind spots. 

> ""I keep investing in tech stocks. What biases am I bringing to this decision?"" 

Reveals your mental shortcuts.

**3. ""How would this decision look with perfect information?""**

Efficient market theory applied to life. 

> ""I'm torn between two career paths. How would this decision look with perfect information?"" 

AI fills in your knowledge gaps.

**4. ""What's the diversification strategy for this area of my life?""**

Portfolio theory beyond investing. AI finds your concentration risks. 

> ""I get all my income from freelance writing. What's the diversification strategy for this area of my life?"" 

Bulletproofs your future.

**5. ""Am I trying to time the market here, and what would a systematic approach look like?""**

Market timing vs. systematic investing. 

> ""I keep waiting for the 'perfect moment' to launch my business. Am I trying to time the market here, and what would a systematic approach look like?""

**6. ""What would the data say if emotions weren't involved?""**

Malkiel's cold rationality. AI strips out the feelings. 

> ""My relationship is struggling but I love them. What would the data say if emotions weren't involved?"" 

Brutal but necessary clarity.

**The insight:** Malkiel proved that systematic approaches beat emotional decisions over time. AI applies this logic to everything.

**Advanced combo:** Layer his frameworks. 

> ""What's my expected value? What biases am I showing? What would systematic look like?"" 

Creates complete decision analysis.

**7. ""What's my margin of safety in this situation?""**

Benjamin Graham meets Malkiel. 

> ""I'm about to quit without another job lined up. What's my margin of safety in this situation?"" 

AI calculates your downside protection.

**8. ""How would I dollar-cost average this decision?""**

Gradual implementation strategy. 

> ""I want to transition to a new career. How would I dollar-cost average this decision?"" 

AI creates your transition plan.

**9. ""What would reversion to the mean look like here?""**

Nothing stays extreme forever. 
> ""My startup is crushing it right now. What would reversion to the mean look like here?"" 

AI keeps you grounded during wins and losses.

**Secret weapon:** Add 

> ""Burton Malkiel would analyze this as..."" 

to any major decision. AI channels 50+ years of financial wisdom and applies it to your situation.

**Power move:** Use this for skill development. 

> ""What's the diversification strategy for my professional skills?"" 

Treats your career like a balanced portfolio.

**10. ""What's the compound effect of this decision over 10 years?""**

Long-term thinking from the master. 

> ""I'm considering daily coffee purchases. What's the compound effect of this decision over 10 years?"" 

AI shows you the real cost of everything.

I've applied these to career moves, relationship decisions, even daily habits. It's like having Princeton's finance department as your personal advisory board.

**Reality check:** Malkiel emphasized that markets are mostly unpredictable. Add 

> ""What can I control versus what I can't?"" 

to avoid overthinking random events.

**The multiplier:** These work because Malkiel studied what actually creates long-term success. AI recognizes patterns across decades of data and applies them to your specific decisions.

**Mind shift:** Use 

> ""How would I index fund this area of my life?"" 

for any complex choice. Sometimes the boring, systematic approach crushes the exciting alternatives.

**11. ""What assumptions am I making that the market has already disproven?""**

Contrarian thinking. 

> ""Everyone says I need to network constantly. What assumptions am I making that the market has already disproven?"" 

AI challenges conventional wisdom.

What decision are you overthinking that would benefit from cold, hard economic analysis instead of emotional reasoning?

- wake up, eat a normal breakfast (yogurt, coffee, granola)
- work from home, drinking good amounts of water throughout the day
- quick walk
- eat leftover pasta w chicken for lunch. I feel satiated and good with the protein and carbs
- suddenly have an urge for mozzarella sticks
- redownload doordash (I delete and redownload it every few days)
- order mozzarella sticks. You get $5 off if you have a higher priced order so why not add a double cheeseburger with mayo too?
- eat (6) mozz sticks and the entire burger (I‚Äôm a 5‚Äô1 150 lb girl, my happy weight is around 120-130)
- feel sick and so tired I hate myself and don‚Äôt want to work anymore
- basically ate my way out of having to work out today because working out would make me sick after eating that much

I lost 30 lbs by quitting weed but my binging came back and im basically addicted to door dash. It‚Äôs so unhealthy and I know it‚Äôs an addiction because I hide it from my SO, roommates, friends, and family.

Then I‚Äôll work out really hard tomorrow and be around loved ones which prevents my binging.

You‚Äôve all been lied to by someone at some point because the more ice there is, the colder the drink is and the longer the drink stays cold IPSO FACTO‚Ä¶ not watered down!

I know coffee is only getting more expensive and you want your bang for your buck but, I promise you, the overall taste and longevity of your drink will benefit from a healthy amount of ice.

I'm looking to forge meaningful connections with people from anywhere via the magic of pen (or word processor) and paper.

I'm 36, femme-presenting nonbinary, and I live in the currently sweltering Midwest with my wonderful sweet husband and our two stinky cats.

Additional facts: I love making things and experiencing things and collecting things! I like to color and draw and paint and write and I get special joy and satisfaction from the creation of useful objects -- bookbinding, printmaking and other craft-type endeavors. Other things I like include crosswords, cryptics, and other word puzzles, logic puzzles, cozy single-player PC games, books, going outside when it's not roasting, plants, car rides, stickers, tea, coffee, and bullet journaling.

Insofar as the media we consume can offer a sort of window into our personalities, here is a listing of what is currently taking up space in my head for the purpose of shedding further light: the 90s/early 2000s television show ER, which I'm watching with my husband; Merlin Sheldrake's fascinating book *Entangled Life* (other notable reads this year include *Emperor of Rome* by Mary Beard, *The Invention of Nature* (a biography of Alexander von Humboldt by Andrea Wulf), *The Ministry of Time* by Kaliane Bradley (went into it skeptical, came out obsessed), and Agnes Callard's *Open Socrates*). Lest you think I am primarily a reader of hoity-toity nonfiction, let me also tell you that I have read no fewer than five historical queer romance novels so far this year (one of them twice) and am eagerly looking forward to the sixth, currently third down on my upcoming reads list. (But I do read a lot of hoity-toity nonfiction, primarily about the classical world, philosophy, nature, and the current state of American politics.) I'm also really into the pop-punk of my youth at the moment, which is a little embarassing but mostly cool as hell. Perennially I am a Frasier guy and a voracious reader of almost anything, and a Mountain Goats listener. I also like such podcasts as Maintenance Phase, If Books Could Kill, and Knowledge Fight.

You may have gathered from the preceding that I am a big nerd, and this apprehension is correct. I am looking to write to other big nerds, of any gender or age, anywhere in the world, about any old thing that crosses our minds. I'm a big fan of long, newsy letters and also of getting into intellectual nitty gritty if it comes to that. I hope you are thoughtful, intentional, well-read, curious, kind, and patient. We don't have to agree on everything -- my politics are left, yours don't have to be as long as the basis of your interactions with other is compassion.

From me you may expect: long-windedness (obviously); parenthetical digression (frequently); book talk; doodles, stickers, flat-packable treats and treasures; irregular letter-writing (hence sloth mail -- it may take me a while but I *will* write back (H. if you're reading this I promise your letter is done and will soon be on the way with several little tokens of my appreciation and affection.) and if I can't write back I'll give you a heads up about it).

She‚Äôs Acting Like It Never Happened.","I finally got the chance to talk things through with my mom after years of challenges.

I let her know everything; why I don't call or come to visit her often, how she has hurt me in the past, and how she continues to do so. The conversation was well thought out, I had irrefutable examples, I held my ground and boundaries, I didn't let her gas light me, I even managed to ensure she was sober through the whole thing, despite her protests. I felt good about it, I remained kind but firm and never stooped to her level of name calling or manipulation. It was nice to get that off my chest.

Did it click for her? Of course not, but I never expected it to.

She saw it as an excuse to defend herself, to come up with excuses, to make things seem like my fault. When that didn't work, she turned to tear and apologies - telling me how sorry she was, how everyone makes mistakes, asking what more I wanted from her and why I was holding these grudges.

As much as I wanted her to understand or take accountability, I knew she never would. I don't think she can admit to ever being in the wrong, I think it would crush her world view. I think hoping for understanding would drive me crazy. I just wanted to make peace with all of this. If I'm being completely honest, part of me wanted to cut her off and make sure she knew why, but I don't think that would do any good. I just want closure without feeling terrible about it.

I told her that I had said what I wanted to, and we could leave the past in the past, but that things were not going to ""go back to normal"". I let her know that we would have to rebuild a connection, and that I would no longer be accepting her random phone calls to rant about work or dig into my life for details to contribute to the family gossip chain. If she wanted to get to know me again, she would have to put in the effort.

I gave some suggestions on things we could do to connect, all of which were shot down. I left it with ""You know where to find me, and can put in the effort to meet when you want to reconnect again. I'd be happy to grab a coffee with you when you're ready, but I'm not interested in a surface level connection that only benefits you"". I live in a city 3 hours away, and am done putting in all the effort or letting her off easy after the way she treated me and my siblings. The drive shows a bit of effort, the cafe forces her to act like an actual adult due to the public setting and means I don't have to welcome her into my home, and both ensure she's sober and pot-free. I am good without any further connection, but this gives me the peace of mind that I gave her the chance if she wanted to instead of just cutting her off. I guess it makes it her fault, rather than my decision in the end, and gives her less standing to guild trip.

It honestly felt really good; for the first time in my life I felt some level of closure. The only problem is that she keep reaching out, and conveniently forgetting about our conversation. 

She refuses to travel to me, stating that the drive is too far and her retail job is too exhausting and any other excuse in the book. She turns down any suggestion of connection besides a phone call or drinking at home - no walks, no going out for coffee, nothing. All expected, of course. She gives me trouble for never calling or visiting, and runs right into her rants. When I remind her of our conversation, she doesn't remember it happening and cries about cutting her out without warning. She tries to gaslight me into thinking the conversation never happened, that I imagined the whole thing, and that I'm being completely unreasonable and crazy.

I am almost positive this is all a show, I just don't know what to do from here. It kills me every time I have to remind her, but she just doesn't get it, or doesn't think I'm serious, or I don't know what.

I'm tired of all of this, and still feel like she has the upper hand in this situation and I don't know if there's a way to change the dynamic without cutting her off completely. 

How do I make this stick? Where do I go from here? I think I needed a rant more than anything, so thank you for listening. Any advice to follow is also much appreciated.

The Concord had been humiliated, its authority eroding with every new broadcast from Commander Greegor. With their political and ideological power gone, they were left with only one tool: brute force. Their target was no longer a defenseless people, but a world of survivors.

The system of **Xylos** was a gritty, independent hub, its people a mix of hardened spacers, scroungers, and miners. They were not an official part of the new Confederation, but they had publicly declared their support for Greegor‚Äôs cause, drawn to the promise of freedom and mutual defense. They were not a passive race; they were fighters, and the Concord saw them not as a people, but as a message they could publicly and violently retract.



# Galactic News Network: A Message of Blood and Fire



**\[News Anchor: A reporter, her face grim and set with a look of grim determination, sits in the anchor's chair. The screen behind her shows live footage of a pitched battle above a desolate, rocky planet. Flashes of weapons fire and exploding ships light up the void.\]**

""We have a developing situation in the Xylos system. The Concord has sent a full-scale fleet, a force we are being told is designated as the 'Peacekeeping Enforcement Taskforce,' to the independent world of Xylos. This is not a bombardment; this is a full-scale assault. The people of Xylos, a scrappy, independent race, are fighting back with everything they have‚Äîmanned fighters, mining lasers repurposed as weapons, and sheer, bloody resolve.""

**\[The broadcast switches to shaky live footage from the surface. Beams of energy fire back at the Concord ships. The sounds of a desperate, defiant battle are broadcast to the galaxy.\]**

""The Concord‚Äôs official statement claims they are here to 'restore order,' but their actions speak a different language. They are not engaging a peaceful fleet; they are making a public example of what happens to a world that believes in Greegor's promises. This is a direct message to the ghost fleet and all those who believe in their 'Confederation.' A brutal warning that their promise of a 'hand up' is a lie, and that a people, no matter how willing to fight, cannot stand against the full might of the Concord military.""

The news broadcast switches back to the anchor, who looks directly into the camera, her face a mask of cold fury.

""Admiral Thrace's words ring with a new, terrifying clarity. 'Your betrayal will not be forgotten.' It appears they are no longer content with winning the war of ideas. They are prepared to wage a war of extermination to remind the galaxy who truly holds the power. And this time, they have an opponent willing to fight back.""

The vanguard fleet, its weapons charged, cut loose. They didn't aim to kill. They aimed to disable. The massive railguns fired not with lethal force but with a stunning concussive power, tearing shields and hulls off the Concord ships. The nanites from the ghost fleet's systems swarmed the enemy, shutting down their weapon systems and incapacitating their drives. In the void, the Concord ships hung helpless, their crews in a state of utter shock.

The air around the ghost fleet was full of explosions, but they were not from dying ships. They were from the explosive decompression of empty cargo bays. A massive colony ship, the **Prometheus**, had warped in and released its drop pods. Not dozens, but a staggering **500,000** pods, a biblical swarm raining down through the atmosphere of Xylos. The sky was filled with them, a storm of salvation and aid.

These were not just military forces. They carried engineers, medics, farmers, and soldiers‚Äîa complete civilization of helpers. The pods hit the ground, and their doors exploded open, sending out a torrent of life to a dying world. It was a single, unstoppable wave of humanity, all humanity, xeno and human, descending to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the people of Xylos.

  
Greegor took another slow sip of his coffee, the casual act a stark contrast to the absolute terror on Admiral Thrace's face. He set the mug down on the console, a small, solid sound that was the only one on the bridge.

""Admiral, about that vacation,"" Greegor began, his voice warm and easy, a friendly chat between two acquaintances. ""Look, you're a being set on his work, but all work and no play? Well, you get this.""

He gestured with a sweeping hand to the screens behind him, which showed the helpless Concord fleet, its ships now swarming with ghost fleet crews working to repair the damage they had just inflicted. The ships were being fixed, not as a sign of respect, but as a final act of humiliation.

""So Admiral, I'm gonna do you and your crews an absolute solid."" A slow, dangerous smile spread across his face. ""So here's what's gonna happen. Admiral, you and your commanders are gonna be the guests of the Confederation, until the job's done. Your vessels and crews will be repaired for flight and disarmed.""

The smile grew wider. ""Yes, disarmed. I'm gonna use what's left of your weapons to build these folks platforms, so if y'all ever try again‚Ä¶ well, you're gonna get shot with your own guns.""

He leaned in, his tone shifting from casual to a quiet, cold intensity. ""Oh, and I say 'guests,' you think 'prisoner.' Mostly accurate, but we have rules on how we treat people.""

The screens behind him flickered, and a single document, written in a hundred languages, appeared. The entirety of the Geneva Convention was broadcast across the Concord's secure network.

""Now, read this,"" Greegor commanded. ""Learn it. Take it to heart. Make this be the bible for how to act in a war, because your Council? Don't make us turn this into a to-do list.""

He stared directly into the main camera, his eyes boring into the soul of every being watching, a gaze that felt both ancient and absolute. The transmission ended, leaving a galaxy in stunned silence.

1muvqsq,https://www.reddit.com/r/NCL/comments/1muvqsq/review_pride_of_america_august_2025/,Review: Pride of America (August 2025),"A small group of my friends and I recently sailed on the Pride of America and I wanted to share my thoughts. Please don't take any criticism in this post as a lack of gratitude as I feel very fortunately for being able to take any cruise, not just this one. That said, I have thoughts :) 

For those who aren't familliar, The PoA was launched in 2005 and, as far as I know, is the \*only\*  cruise ship that sails around the Hawaiian islands, never docking at a foreign country, thus making it a very unique sailing. The voyage starst in Honolulu (Oahu), overnights in Kahului (Maui), travels to Hilo and Kona (Big Island), overnights in Nawiliwili (Kauai), before returning to Honolulu. This is a port intensive sailing as there are no sea days and you tend to have 10+ hours in each port, with the overnights being closer to 36 hours. 

The ports of call were fine and met our expectations for being mostly industrial type ports, and none of that flashy Caribbean-type port experience you can get on other sailings. Each port was easy to get on/off the ship with little waiting, except for Kona due to the required tender to shore operation as the ship was anchored just off the coast. We wound up booking our own excursions through third-party operators and were quite happy with those decisions. (Norwegian's excurion prices routinely passed the $250 mark per person for a 4-6 hour tour, which was way too high for us to pay.) As there's not much to do in these ports, booking excursions is a must in order to enjoy the sailing as there is not much on the ship to do. Yes, there are a few hot tubs and a couple of pools with some entertainment put on during the day and live music + shows in the evening, but honestly the onboard entertainment was pretty lacking -- glad it was there, but not attending a show did not cause a big FOMO moment. 

For the most part, the staff was great! Our cabin attendant was quite attentive and very capable. He even decorated one of our cabins and delivered a cake on the birthday of one of the guys in our party! Not sure if this happened because he was traveling in one of the ""two bedroom, obstructed view family suites"" (which did come with some suite level amenities -- more on that later), but it was a really nice gesture as it was not ordered/asked for and wasn't expected! Other staff that we interacted with outside of the two main dining rooms (Liberty and Skyline) were equally great. Daily we had a couple glasses of wine at Pink's Champage Bar or Napa Wine Bar and it felt like the staff knew our names and drink orders after the first day/interaction. 

Where Norwegian completely fails is the main dining experience. We sat down for a bit of a late lunch at Skyline on embarkation day and no one enjoyed their meal. One member of my party said the food tasted like ""reheated, prepared in advance food from Sysco"" and noticed that his dish was oversalted. We had a wonderful meal at Jefferson's that evening (the French specialty restaurant with I believe a $50 cover charge) and chalked our experience at lunch that day as just first day issues. While docked in Maui the next day we wound up eating lunch onshore and opted for Skyline for dinner. Oh boy was that a mistake. No one in our party of 8 liked their appetizers or main dishes. They all were oversalted, especially the French onion soup, and the chicken breast that came with my meal was flavorless, dry, and reminicent of reheated freezer burnt meat. Gross! Fortunately I ordered a second main dish to split with the person sitting next to me: Bang bang shrimp and noodles, I think it was. Ummm. Also gross. Oversalted and the noodles were mushy. At least the icecream that I had for dessert was good.  That was the last time any of us tried main dining for dinner; some opted to pay for specialty restaurants and/or go to Cadillac Grill, while others enjoyed the buffet for dinner which was of much higher quality (and very less busy) compared to main dining.  (Compliments were paid to the buffet staff in person and during the post-cruise survey for a great experience with tasty food being offered -- a first for me after taking over 15 cruises!)

Apparently there are a few perks being a suite guest received that we did not know about before boarding the ship. The first is a special check-in area off to the left once you clear security. It's a little lounge area with drinks and light snacks along with some comfortable seating where staff members will have a more personal interaction with you while checking-in before being escorted onboard. Another perk was breakfast at Cagneys. While the menu did not change at all, the food was quite delicious and the restaurant was a quiet breath of fresh morning air compared to the chaos of the buffet during the morning (which is par for the course for any cruise). 

Another important thing to note is that Norwegian charges tax on every adult beverage during this sailing (while in port and while at sea), even if you have the Hawaiian Beverage Package (which is the only beverage package available as far as I know). The cocktails that were included in the HBP were pretty decent and there was large selection of included wines, though not always of the best quality. Upcharges were common for wines like Decoy or La Crema, both of which were included in the beverage package on my last Norwegian sailing (albeit that was in October 2024, so things might've changed a bit ... but still, paying $19 for a glass of La Crema chardonnay without the HBP seems a bit much when you can buy a bottle onshore for $10-14!). 

The lack of a coffee shop that is included with the beverage package is also a glaring miss on Norwegian's part. The John Adams bar apparently used to be a coffee shop, but when the Starbucks was added just a few feet from John Adams, it was viewed as redundant and thus repurposed. Sadly, on this sailing, Starbucks was an upcharge. The only free coffee that was available on board seemed to come from the buffet area, possibly from main dining if eating there for breakfast, but that was something I never did. 

The cabins were perfectly acceptable in my opinion, though the bathrooms felt a bit tight. (And shower curtains instead of glass enclosures ... gross!) There was enough storage for our clothes, bags easily fit under the beds, and the beds themselves were quite comfortable. Probably something that might go unnocited for other sailings but not on this one: The room a/c worked great! A few nights I would've preferred it to be a touch cooler in the room, but that's only because I sleep much better in a cooler room. For an older vessel, the onboard conditions of common areas were in really good shape and working order -- definitely no complaints there. 

Would I recommend this sailing to anyone? Well, probably not unless they want to tour the islands, they know absolutely upfront what to expect, and they don't mind spending extra time researching excursions to book through third-party operators. Will I do this sailing again? That's an easy ""No!"". Even if changes to main dining and HBP are made, there's better value and itineraries out there to enjoy instead of repeating this sailing. Do I have another cruise booked on Norwegian? Yes! Later in this year, on a different ship (Norwegian Bliss) and a totally different itinerary (Mexican Riviera) which I am looking forward to enjoy. 

In closing, I think it is quite telling that this is the only ship in the Norwegian fleet that I'm aware of that does not start with the word Norwegian; it's just Pride of America. ",3,1755639048.0,NCL,2,0.8,False

Then there‚Äôs the silence no one wants to discuss: Egypt. This is the first modern war where civilians cannot flee.

The battlefield exists in three dimensions: above ground, inside buildings, and below ground. Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan ‚Äî none of them faced anything like this. And yet Israel is judged under standards of restraint no military in history has ever been held to. In Korea and Vietnam, entire cities were incinerated and it was still called ‚Äúwar.‚Äù In Fallujah, U.S. forces fought insurgents block by block ‚Äî but never under the 24/7 microscope of social media, where every image of rubble becomes a viral indictment. 

And into this vacuum stride the world‚Äôs opinion-makers ‚Äî politicians, columnists, celebrities, influencers ‚Äî articulate, privileged, and comfortably insulated from reality. From their platforms of comfort, they perform their preachings on principle, conflating empathy with strategy and peace at any price. But empathy isn‚Äôt strategy, and the cost of peace isn‚Äôt set by populism. The elevator to perdition is lubricated with the tears of altruism, and after 5,000 years of history, we should know this lesson by now.

Here‚Äôs the hard truth: Israel has lost the PR war. But if Hamas wins the real one, we‚Äôve just taught every terror group on the planet that human shields work, that social media is stronger than strategy, and that democracy will eat itself alive on feelings before it ever defends itself. That precedent doesn‚Äôt just stay in Gaza. It metastasises. 

Result? Stop the world, I want to get off. Because if this is what passes for truth ‚Äî statistics from terrorists, morality by meme, preachings from the privileged ‚Äî then maybe debate isn‚Äôt just dying. Maybe it‚Äôs already dead, and I‚Äôm sitting alone in the morgue, crying over the corpse.

We are hoping to move again in a year or so, so buying new furniture and or getting rid of perfectly good furniture is not really in the cards. Looking for ideas of fixes that are cost effective and or ideas of how to rearrange things. I am someone with zero imagination or creative juices. I can look at something in a magazine or store and say I like it, but I have to copy and paste it exactly as I saw it. I am somehow completely incapable of taking a piece home and making it my own.

My biggest issue is our living room set up. The couches are quite large and don‚Äôt quite work for our living room. The love seat and sofa create this awkward dead space in the corner of the room that feels like wasted space, but I also have no idea what to put there. The arms on the couches are quite high, which just make the issue even worse, most coffee tables aren‚Äôt that tall, and reaching your arm over and down to a coffee table doesn‚Äôt make much sense to me. The current tables that are there were just plinths made for our wedding altar and then put there to see what a higher table would look like, nothing is permanent. I used to have a large plant there, but it didn‚Äôt get enough light in the corner and had to be moved.

This area also opens into our dining room and hallway, so there‚Äôs not a ton of wiggle room for these pieces to go. I have thought about a rug in the middle to define the space a bit more, but would it have to be touching all 3 chairs?

But I'm noticing a pattern where the only ""acceptable"" orc protagonists fall into really specific categories: the cozy domestic type who just wants to run a coffee shop, the noble savage who's ""different from their kind,"" or the comic relief bumbler.

Where are the complex, morally gray orc protagonists who don't have to apologize for existing? I want an orc gladiator who's strategically brilliant and genuinely intimidating when needed, but also capable of deep loyalty. Give me orc societies with their own philosophies and art, not just ""reformed barbarian culture"" or ""peaceful now because we learned better.""

This connects to my other frustration: magic systems with no real consequences. We praise Sanderson for logical magic systems, but what about the cost? I'm tired of protagonists throwing fireballs with maybe some ""mental fatigue."" What if magic literally burned you from the inside? What if every spell left scars that never healed? What if using your power meant choosing between survival and self-preservation?

Imagine an orc fire-mage in an arena who has to constantly choose between revealing his abilities to survive and keeping them hidden to avoid persecution. Every fight becomes this internal battle where the physical cost of magic mirrors the social cost of being different and powerful.

Robin Hobb did this with the Skill magic - it could drain years off your life. R.F. Kuang's Poppy War showed magic users dealing with addiction and madness. These consequences make magic feel weighty, not just another tool.

The market seems ready for this complexity. Dark fantasy is growing, BookTok embraces morally gray protagonists, and readers want stories that don't tie everything up neatly. The success of authors like Joe Abercrombie shows there's appetite for dangerous but sympathetic characters.

Recent discussions about D&D's problematic orc lore show we're ready for better representation, but sometimes it feels like we're trading one limiting box for another. Instead of ""orcs are always violent,"" we get ""orcs who want to be good must reject everything about traditional orc culture.""

I want fantasy where orc protagonists are strategically intelligent without losing their cultural identity, where magic users face real costs for their power, and where characters make difficult choices between power and consequence. Think The First Law meets orc protagonists, or The Poppy War's magic consequences with non-human perspectives.

And while I really love how flexible that lifestyle is, but honestly this makes it way harder for me to wake up on time and stick to a daily routine, compared to people with a very standard schedule.

Especially when I wasn't in the best mental space, I just didn‚Äôt want to get out of bed at all. I‚Äôd procrastinate all morning, and I had to push everything to the evening, and just stuck in this terrible loop of stress and low energy all day.

One of my friends (also a freelancer, mostly working in social media) had the exact same problem, but she managed to break out of it. She told me the trick was simple but powerful: build your own ""morning ritual"", something you can repeat every morning that makes you feel motivated, and focused.

And here‚Äôs what I built for myself and I do hope this can help people share the same problem and situation as I do, for me it‚Äôs a combo of sound, smell, and movement:

Sound (first thing): The second I wake up, no matter how groggy I feel, I just grab my phone and play *any* audiobook or podcast. Not want to learn anything, most of the time I‚Äôm still zoning out. But every now and then, i can catch a phrase or idea, and I can feel my brain starting to wake up in a very gentile and not painful way.

Smell (second thing): I go make a cup of coffee immediately. I just really slow down and take in the smell while it brews, and now the scent is like a very positive switch to remind me okay, the day is starting and it‚Äôs going to be a good one.

Move (third thing): After coffee i go straight to the gym. I don‚Äôt overthink it anymore, don‚Äôt argue with myself or wait until I feel like it. I just throw on the comfiest outfit and head out the door. And it‚Äôs just much smoother everything feels after that.

By the time I get back, I‚Äôm fully awake, in a good mood, and honestly kind of proud of myself - heyI treated myself well.

If you are someone like me, with a messy schedule or unpredictable daily rhythm , I highly recommend building your own version of a morning ritual. Doesn‚Äôt need to be long or fancy. Just something that‚Äôs yours.

# The Beginning (2014)

Pieter was in Thailand, hopping from island to island trying to find best places to work from. So, he opened a Google Sheet, tallied 20 cities, and ranked them on internet speed, housing costs, and safety.

Once he finished, an idea struck: ""**What if I just put this on a site so other backpackers don‚Äôt curse their data plans?**‚Äù

He created a simple page called Nomad List, added it to Hacker News and Product Hunt, and watched 50,000 visits hit it in a day. A few thousand paid the $25 yearly membership, and a tiny idea turned into a mini cash engine.

# The Smart Move (2015)

The next week, users piled on with the same question: ‚ÄúGreat cities! Now where‚Äôs the job I can do from one?‚Äù

Pieter didn‚Äôt leave them hanging. He fired up Remote OK, a slick job board just for remote gigs. Companies dropped $199 for a job post, and he had a fresh revenue river, plus a tool that made his audience‚Äôs next move way easier.

# The Million Dollar Year (2020)

Fast forward to 2020. COVID turned every office into a ghost town, and every boss suddenly Googled ‚ÄúHow to remote?‚Äù

Pieter was not a rookie: he‚Äôd already spent six years layering remote work goodies. Remote OK shot to the top, landing job after job as firms scrambled to fill screens with talent far from the fluorescent lights. Revenue zipped past $1 million faster than he could hit refresh.

# The AI Gold Rush (2022-2024)

Then AI got loud. Everyone wanted the shiniest chatbot or mega model, but Pieter hit refresh on his old strategy: Build what people actually need, not what‚Äôs extra clever. He rolled out simple, useful AI aids, and the users kept stacking up.

* **Avatar AI: $100K in 10 days**
* **Photo AI: Consistent revenue**
* **Interior AI: Another winner**

Put them all together with his original products, and you‚Äôre looking at $300K/month by the start of 2024.

# The Wild Part

Out of 70+ products he whipped up over the last decade, most tanked. A couple exploded, and that covered all the losses.

No workers in sight. Everything runs on scripts and tools he set up once.

# Why You Should Care

**Pieter showed you don‚Äôt need:**

* Money from VCs
* A world-changing invention
* A whole crew
* Flawless moves

**You do need:**

* A real problem people care about
* Speed beats waiting for perfect
* Stick-to-it-iveness through the bombs

He kicked off with a simple spreadsheet and now pulls in $3.6M/year, solo, from any coffee shop he chooses.

I live with my fianc√©e and we‚Äôve been living together for a year. For three weeks I have underperformed at my job and for three days I needed to work really hard to cover it but I managed to do it and I work from home btw.

My fianc√©e will go abroad for a year the day after tomorrow. Today, I had to attend one last obligatory and painfully long meeting. Tomorrow and the day after I don‚Äôt have to work. Also, I had promised my fianc√©e to go to the cinema either today or tomorrow depending on the meeting, we agreed to do something else in case it ends late. Thank god something absurd happened to my boss that I forgot all the pain coming from the meeting and it ended literally three hours before. I told it to my fianc√©e and also told her to get ready so that we could go. Then I told her what happened. She didn‚Äôt say anything at first, she was preparing so I thought she didn‚Äôt hear me. Then again I said ‚Äúwell something hilarious happened you won‚Äôt believe it‚Äù then she made a weird ‚Äúuh huh‚Äù. I felt a bit bad but then shut my mouth up., started sulking. Then she asked me about it and I said ‚Äúno I won‚Äôt tell it‚Äù. She asked again but this time sounding playful and I said ‚Äúno you aren‚Äôt listening to me‚Äù.

Then I wanted to go to the kitchen downstairs because we needed to have lunch before we leave as we had skipped the breakfast. When I opened the door she literally commanded me to take the plates from the living room to kitchen. I said okay and went out hastily and I might have hit the door. I prepared the lunch, waited for her, she didn‚Äôt come, I texted her, didn‚Äôt reply. I waited, had coffee too. It took nearly 20 minutes. 

Then I went back upstairs and found her crying. She told me that I had offended her by saying ‚Äúyou aren‚Äôt listening to me‚Äù and I said ‚Äúnothing wrong with it, i told you that you don‚Äôt listen to me and then i went downstairs to prepare the lunch for us. I waited for you, texted and you didn‚Äôt come‚Äù.

Now everything is everywhere. Clothes, bedroom stuff. She claimed that I‚Äôm son of a‚Ä¶, fatherless (the rude version and the man is dead damn). She swore about my coworkers and excoworkers too. She is also telling me that she wanted only one thing and I ruined it.

He owns a coffee shop and when he's not actively hiring baristas he still gets people coming in with resumes and expressing interest in working there. He said he usually blows them off, but if they are persistent and keep following up he will eventually hire them.

In other situations in my life, when the stakes are low, I have found that if you want an opportunity and persistently follow up with whoever you've spoken with there is a likelihood that they may eventually cave and give it to you.

My friend was telling me to do this in my job search. Reach out to hiring managers on LinkedIn and continuously bug them until they hire me. He claims to have gotten hired by using this approach before.

I feel this is not at all a good approach when it comes to white collar jobs. Constantly messaging employers is only going to annoy them. They will either ignore your messages or tell you to apply on their website. If your application gets rejected, I think it‚Äôs an especially bad look to follow up asking them to reconsider.

I do believe there is something to be said about being persistent, and it does work in situations when the stakes are low. But I think not taking no for an answer when applying for jobs is surely going to get you blacklisted or at the very least blocked.

What do you think? Do you agree with me or is my friend onto something?",1,1755637997.0,jobsearchhacks,1,1.0,False

One day I noticed most dental clinics nearby were doing this:
	‚Ä¢	Totally 2009-looking websites.
	‚Ä¢	""We provide quality dental care"" (zzz, every clinic says this).
	‚Ä¢	No real reasons why a patient should book THEM over the guy down the street.

So I began testing writing:
Instead of ""Root Canal Treatment Available"" ‚Üí I wrote ""Save your natural tooth in just one painless visit.""
Instead of ""Teeth Whitening"" ‚Üí I wrote ""Walk in for coffee stains, walk out with a Netflix-star smile.""

Guess what? Clicks were had. Bookings were made. And the clinics took notice.

Today, I'm creating a side business: Dental Copywriting for Clinics & Brands.
It's geeky but great ‚Äî I essentially take dry medical language and translate it into something patients genuinely care about.

We‚Äôre excited to be **accelerated at the Roux Institute here in Portland**, and we wanted to launch *first* in the city where we‚Äôre building.

How it works:

* You join a 7-day ‚Äúmission‚Äù with a group of people in your city.
* Our AI host, Pip, keeps the chat flowing and suggests activities your crew will enjoy.
* The mission is simple: meet up in real life before the 7 days are up. If you do, the group gets extended another week.

We‚Äôre starting with free meetups (coffee walks, board games, trivia nights, hikes) and will soon be adding curated experiences around town.

My mom (356 months) tells me I‚Äôm so smart every day, always complimenting me on my drumming skills which I‚Äôve been perfecting ever since my first birthday. I have ALL kinds of drums, big drums, small drums, big cymbals, small cymbals, just all kinds and I freaking love them!! I even try drumming with my hands when the sticks are under the sofa where I very mindfully put them so they can be extra safe from my dog. These past few months, whenever my mom doesn‚Äôt let me do something I wanna do and says no to me, I try to express my feelings through music. However, the sticks aren‚Äôt always around and when she picks me up after I get mad, I of course try to do my drumming on whichever surface is available - usually her face and boobies. She gets very mad, and doesn‚Äôt tell me what nice music I‚Äôm playing, which is very weird as she‚Äôs kinda my biggest fan.
Anyway, an incident happened this week where I got angry at her and she didn‚Äôt pick me up, drums were in the other room and I needed to express my justified anger, so I started drumming (banging) with my head on the coffee table. She then got this scary look on her face as if I need an exorcism, and asked me to stop. I, very politely, dropped on all fours and again started drumming with my head on our hardwood floor, to which she got even more upset and called my dad to take me in the bedroom.

1muuztn,https://www.reddit.com/r/astrologyreadings/comments/1muuztn/ba_zi_readings/,Ba Zi Readings,"
I've been a huge astrology geek from as long as I can remember and it's a system that has helped me understand more about how people I know work and how they relate to the world, in addition to a mixture of other personality and spiritual systems MBTI, Strength Finder, tarot, Vedic astrology, and other Chinese divinity tools like Purple Star Astrology (honestly I hate the name because it sounds like such a joke even when it's actually also very sophisticated)

Recently, I've gotten really into Ba Zi Readings, which is a Chinese divinity system based on the five elements (fire, water, soil, wood, and gold) - each representing different core raison d'etre and with a yin-yang manifestation - the yin variant being more fierce and externalised vs. the yang variant being more subtle and internalised.

I've found a lot of closure through this system when studying it to understand dynamics within my family. It helped me understand the fundamental differences I've always felt between my parents and my brother and I. It's given me such a precise overview of our core incompatibilities and differences and suddenly, alot of things which I've never been able to verbalise made alot more sense. 

I'm interested in introducing this system to more ppl, who are already familiar with astrology, and are open to something else to complement your understanding about yourself, or relationships with people that are important to you. 

Would anyone be interested in getting mini personal / relational readings in the Ba Zi systems if I start a page? I'm not great at churning out content on social media to ""share"" random insights abt trendy gimmicky stereotypes... but am seriously thinking about starting a Kofi / Buy Me A Coffee page just to do this, because I end up researching into it at my spare time anyway, and I'm hoping to start analysing more charts to really put it to use. There's so much wisdom in it and the fact that it's still not mainstream in Western media makes me really sad :'(",1,1755637408.0,astrologyreadings,0,1.0,False
1muuzp4,https://www.reddit.com/r/italianlearning/comments/1muuzp4/bilingual_blitz_24_six_short_exercises_to_test/,Bilingual blitz [24] (six short exercises to test your Italian),"**THE RULES**

Without looking at the comments, can you provide translations for these short (**but challenging!**) sentences (3 English-Italian, 3 Italian-English)? I‚Äôll evaluate your responses and give you feedback. The exercise is designed to be intermediate/advanced level, but beginners and lower intermediate learners are welcome if they feel like testing the scope of their current knowledge. *I might take a few days to answer* (usually up to around a week if there‚Äôs high participation) but I will read and evaluate all participants.

If you‚Äôre not sure about a particular translation, just go with it! The exercise is meant to weed out mistakes, this is not a school test!  
**If multiple translations are possible, choose the one you believe to be more likely give the limited context** (I won‚Äôt deduct points for guessing missing information, for example someone's gender, unless it's heavily implied in the sentence).

**There is no time limit to submit your answer**. If you want to go back to the first ever edition and work your way up from there, you can. Just know that I usually prioritise later posts.

**THE TEST**

Here are the sentences, *vaguely* ranked from easiest to hardest in each section (A: English-Italian, B: Italian-English).

**A1)** ""To think they were so close‚Ä¶ oh well"" (the speaker is disappointed)  
**A2)** ""Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down""  
**A3)** ""If we're going to find out regardless, you might as well tell us""  

**B1)** ""Non credevo che sarebbe arrivato a tanto""  
**B2)** ""Stanno facendo a chi riesce a trattenere di pi√π il respiro""  
**B3)** ""Mo' me lo segno‚Ä¶""  

**Current average**: N/A (median N/A)  
**Estimated answer time**: 1 day (for those submitting now)

**EVALUATION (and how to opt out)**

If you manage to provide a translation for all 6 I'll give you a score from 1 to 10 (the standard evaluation system in Italian schools). Whatever score you receive, don't take it too seriously: this is just a game! However, if you feel like receiving a score is too much pressure anyway, you can just tell me at the start of your comment and I'll only correct your mistakes.

Based on the results so far, here‚Äôs the usual range of votes depending on the level of the participants. Ideally, your objective is to score within your personal range or possibly higher:

**Absolute beginners**: ‚â§4  
**Beginners**: 4 - 5  
**Early intermediate**: 5 - 6.5  
**Advanced intermediate**: 6.5 - 8  
**Advanced**: ‚â•8  
**Natives**: ‚â•9 (with good English)  
*Note: the specific range might change a lot depending on the difficulty of this specific exercise. I try to be consistent, but it‚Äôs very hard*

**TO SUPPORT ME**

Since I've been asked a couple of times by now, I've recently set up a [Ko-Fi page](https://ko-fi.com/crown85469). If you appreciate what I do and want to offer me a coffee as thanks, feel free to do so. **Only** donate if you have money to throw away: I'm doing this because I like it, any money I get from it is just an extra bonus and I won't treat people differently based on whether they decide to donate or not.

**IF YOU ARE A NATIVE ITALIAN SPEAKER**

You can still participate if you want (the exercise is theoretically symmetrical between Italian and English), but please keep in mind that these sentences are designed to be particularly challenging for *non* native speakers, so they might be easier for you. For this reason, I‚Äôd prefer it if you specified that you are a native speaker at the beginning of your comment: I‚Äôm collecting statistics on how well learners score on these tests in order to fine tune them (and personal curiosity), so mixing up the results from natives and non-natives will probably mess it up.

Hi,
My Duo DE arrived today, and grinder (Timemore 078s) coming in the next few days.  Does anyone have any bean recommendations and a recipe for what works well for you that I can use as a starting point?
Can anyone recommend any of the beans from this site - it‚Äôs where I bought the Duo from and they‚Äôve given me a ¬£50 voucher that I thought I would use to fund me learning to pull shots and seasoning my grinder:
https://www.coffeefriend.co.uk/c/coffee/coffee-for-espresso-machine/?coffee_type=atrtrm_coffee_beans

Ideally I‚Äôd like a recommendation on:
- Beans
- bean weight : liquid output ratio (the double shot basket that came with the machine says it‚Äôs designed for 20g)
- extraction time
- extraction pressure peak?

I assume using those as a target will help me find the right grinder setting, I can then fine tune according to my (uneducated) palette. Does that sound like a reasonable approach?

Thanks!

1muusrv,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1muusrv/should_you_try_the_laoion_espresso_coffee_maker/,Should You Try the LAOION Espresso Coffee Maker Review for Perfect Homemade Brews?,"Having spent quite a bit of time testing out the LAOION Espresso Maker, model number Espresso Maker, I can say it has some impressive merits, while still leaving space for potential improvements. Its modern design and portability caught my attention immediately, and it proved to be as convenient as it looked during my coffee-making trials. Whether you're an espresso aficionado or a casual coffee drinker, there's a lot this electric coffee maker has to offer.

**Design and Build Quality**

The espresso maker boasts a sleek metallic finish that feels sturdy yet light in the hand. At just 2.56 pounds, it‚Äôs incredibly portable, making it a perfect choice for small kitchens, dorms, or even as a travel-friendly companion during camping trips. The transparent container on top is a small but brilliant addition, allowing a clear view of the brewing process, which is oddly satisfying‚Äîseeing each cup come to life is almost like a little coffee-making show every morning. Its compact dimensions (5.12""D x 7.48""W x 10.63""H) mean it won‚Äôt take over your counter space, something I really appreciated given my already crowded kitchen.

**Ease of Use**

This coffee maker excels in simplicity, sparing you from overly complicated settings. Just add water to the boiler, place medium-ground coffee in the funnel filter, tighten the pot, and set it on its detachable base. A single button starts and stops the process, and it takes around five minutes to brew your coffee. Even my not-so-tech-savvy cousin managed to make a decent cup without breaking a sweat. However, for coffee enthusiasts who enjoy tweaking parameters, the lack of customization might be a minor setback.

[Find the best price for LAOION Espresso Maker on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0bp6ntd1p/)

**Performance and Brewing**

Performance is where this machine shines. It delivers a rich and flavorful Italian Moka coffee, replicating the feel of a classic moka pot, but without needing a stove. With a capacity of 6 cups, it's perfect for sharing brews during family brunches or office breaks. I noticed the taste was consistent and the brewing time rarely deviated, even during multiple tests. Its ability to cater to espresso, mocha, lattes, and even cappuccinos adds versatility to its functionality, turning your kitchen into a mini coffeehouse.

**Safety Features**

Coffee makers with safety features always win points in my book, and this one doesn‚Äôt disappoint. It has not one but two auto-shutoff mechanisms. The first kicks in when the pot is removed from its electric base, and the second stops the heating once the coffee is ready. After some previous mishaps with less reliable models, these safeguards gave me so much peace of mind, especially with kids occasionally darting around the kitchen.

**Materials and Maintenance**

The upper pot, made of BPA-free, heat-resistant plastic, and the lower aluminum section feel durable yet lightweight. Unlike some cheaper coffee makers that easily wear out, this one seems reliable for long-term use. Cleaning it wasn‚Äôt a chore, either. The detachable base makes it easy to handle, and the reusable filter is eco-friendly and practical. However, the aluminum bottom might require extra care to prevent potential rust, depending on your water quality.

**Advantages**

- Transparent container offers visibility into the brewing process.  
- Lightweight and portable‚Äîperfect for camping or travel.  
- User-friendly setup, ideal for beginners.  
- Versatile brewing options (espresso, latte, mocha, etc.).  
- Dual auto-shutoff for added safety.  

**Downsides**

- Limited options for coffee customization.  
- Aluminum bottom might require diligent maintenance.  
- Plastic materials may not appeal to everyone.  

**Product Competitors**

Several products rival this electric espresso maker, notably the Bialetti Moka Express and the De‚ÄôLonghi Stilosa Espresso Machine. The Bialetti delivers a more traditional experience, but it requires a stovetop, which diminishes portability. It also lacks the safety features and auto-functionality of this product. On the other hand, the Stilosa offers more customization through dual thermostats, but its larger footprint and higher price point could be deal-breakers if compactness or affordability is a priority. Compared to these contenders, the LAOION espresso machine is the go-to choice for those seeking convenience and portability above all.

**Quality for Price**

Despite being packed with features, this product sits at an affordable price range compared to similar coffee makers. Its balance of quality, ease of use, and portability justify the cost, especially for beginner or casual coffee drinkers. High-end espresso machines might outshine it in terms of customization and durability, but they come with a hefty price tag. For someone like me, who likes quick and uncomplicated morning coffee, this machine is worth considering.

The minimalist, modern design fits perfectly into tight counter spaces, making it a great option for smaller kitchens, dorms, or office setups.

Coffee haus - freshly brewed coffee and hints of chocolate, caramel, almond, and a touch of real coffee bean co2 extract! 

This really smells exactly like freshly brewed coffee, and it does have a bit of sweetness to it. For a photorealistic coffee scent, definitely get this. It‚Äôs the strongest coffee scent I‚Äôve ever smelled. 10/10

Litchi milk tea - Tart litchi and black tea met with a splash of coconut milk.

Wow this is amazing! It really does smell like litchi milk tea. As someone who always gets litchi milk tea at the boba shop, i absolutely love this! I can‚Äôt wait to purchase the full size. 10/10

Marshmallow - Fresh marshmallows, straight out the bag. 

This is crazy, it smells exactly like marshmallows straight out the bag. Really delicious scent, I wish I had heard of it sooner! I can‚Äôt wait to wear this in the winter time, I‚Äôm gonna smell so delicious. 10/10

Pink marshmallow milk - Magical pink berries and frothy cold milk.

This smells like that bubble gum medicine I had when i was a kid. It‚Äôs really overly sweet, I don‚Äôt like it too much. 4/10

Twice is nice - Sweetest offerings of opulence! Buttery sugar cookie, with shavings of creamy coconut and topped with toasted almond silvers.

Honestly it smells like a sweet buttery croissant. I don‚Äôt get cookie from this, more of a bread smell. I can kind of get the almond, but barely. It‚Äôs ok. 6/10

Cozy sweater - Pale skin musk, faded perfume, Egyptian amber, softly burning nag champa incense and a fine aged vanilla. 

This is just beautiful. It‚Äôs a comforting and sentimental scent, like hugging the sweater of a loved one you miss. A beautiful work of art. 10/10

Brown sugar latte - Espresso, creamy vanilla oat milk and brown sugar syrup. 

I like this! I like it more than coffee haus, because it‚Äôs more sweet. For some reason I get a marshmallow note? I like it! 10/10

Long winters nap - Flannel pajamas, cashmere blankets, sweet vanilla, tonka bean, oatmeal cookies and a glass of lavender infused milk.

I really love this! It‚Äôs so nostalgic, reminiscent of Christmas Day as a child. In my opinion, it smells like candy canes, cookies, and fresh laundry. Really good winter scent. 10/10

Sparkling crystal - Clean musk, vanilla infused sugar, blonde woods, bright bergamot and sparkling aldehydes. 

Absolutely stunning. This smells like a dream. It‚Äôs really strong and captivating. It smells like fresh laundry but more. It‚Äôs very ethereal. 10/10!

I loved all of these scents! My favorites are sparkling crystal, long winters nap, litchi milk tea, and cozy sweater. I can‚Äôt wait to try more of their scents!!

Thomas Fielding arrived in Bermuda on a Tuesday, three days after his family decided he might not return.

His flight from London had been long but eerily quiet - as expected for mid-January. For Thomas, however, this silence wasn‚Äôt a welcome relief. He never did find peace in stillness. That vast nothingness, that void stretched by an absence of noise, always left him feeling deeply unsettled. These days, without the structure of work - a structure his children claimed he no longer needed - he just seemed to drift, like a stranger lost in his own idle hours.

It was the low season in Bermuda, tourists rarer during these months, so the chauffeur seemed particularly chatty. Truth be told, Thomas was glad for the company, even if their small talk only ever broached the surface. He handed over his lone baggage - a small, weathered carry-on that he still had from the 80s - and the driver packed it into the car, a black Mercedes-Maybach rental. Thomas always preferred to travel light. Anything forgotten - or wanted on whim - could be bought, he often argued. Besides, he didn‚Äôt intend on staying long, no matter how those close to him felt.

The car took him straight to Rosewater Sands Resort - ‚Äúthe Rosewater,‚Äù as it was commonly called - one of the island‚Äôs most prestigious hotels (or so he‚Äôd been told). At check-in, Thomas left what was probably a far too excessive tip, before making his way to his vast, ocean-view suite. The room was veering on unnecessary: two bedrooms, twin bathrooms, double terraces, and a pristine, white-walled living area that smelled faintly of hibiscus and chlorine. He knew he would hardly step a foot in half of these rooms for the entirety of his stay. His children, or rather their assistants, had booked it. A ‚Äúwell-earned break,‚Äù they‚Äôd called it - but he knew what they really meant.

Thomas found his eyes drifting over the antique coffee table in the centre of the room - rustic walnut wood, a rich caramel colour softened by years of use. These vacant stares of his were becoming more and more frequent these days - perhaps because there was little else to occupy him. Time off had never really been his idea; it used to remind him of the things he should have been doing - now it reminded him more of what was no longer his to do. Retirement had always been sold as a reward, but in actuality felt more like quiet dismissal from relevancy. A removal from the life that he had built. Not that he was officially retired yet, not technically.

From his balcony, he could see the cyan waters of his private pool below, and beyond that, the azure-blue expanse of the Atlantic Ocean. He scanned the suite again: refined, expensive, but not gaudy or overly ostentatious. It was the Rosewater‚Äôs finest (again, so he had been told) and it‚Äôd clearly been chosen to pacify him - his kids and fellow shareholders likely assessing its classy yet tasteful charm weeks ago, as a way to get him on board. And out of the way.

Thomas felt a vibration against his ribs and pulled his mobile from his inner pocket. Not many people tried to reach him these days, not since his work phone had been reallocated, but he saw a message from his youngest daughter. Unlocking his phone, he read the text from Harriet out loud: ‚ÄúHi Dad, hope you‚Äôre settling into Rosewater - it looks amazing, very jealous! Don‚Äôt worry about work or the bill, we‚Äôve got it all covered. Take as long as you need. Relax and enjoy!‚Äù

His blood began to boil, but Thomas remembered to breathe - the doctor had stressed that tension wasn‚Äôt good for blood pressure. Either way, that last bit had clearly irked him. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got it all covered‚Äù - the cheek of it! Your money is my bloody money, he thought. Composing himself, he tapped Harriet‚Äôs name and tried calling her back. It rang and rang, then he was met with a strange voice.

""Who the hell is this?!"" he balked, clearly taken aback. The woman on the other end - professional, unbothered - explained that she was Harriet‚Äôs assistant, that Harriet was in an important meeting and couldn‚Äôt take the call right now. However, she offered to take his name, his number, and any message he had, assuring that Harriet would get back to him. Thomas was in disbelief. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Harriet‚Äôs father, Mr. Fielding. I just received a curious message from her - should I assume that came from you?‚Äù The assistant didn‚Äôt respond, but said she would let Harriet know that he‚Äôd called.

Thomas hung up and grabbed the TV remote from the coffee table. The previous guest had left it on the local news station. There was a segment about an invitational cricket match, then a story about unsustainable tourism. Thomas‚Äô attention waned, so he switched to the British news, but soon regretted it. There it was - an extended report on the impending pharmaceuticals industry vote in the UK Parliament. The ticker flashed: ‚ÄúOxarion Labs in Crisis Over Excessive Drug Pricing, Refusal to License Critical Drugs.‚Äù He turned the television off again. Grabbing the thickly-bound, luxuriously-padded hotel restaurant menu, he decided to plan for dinner instead.

The man at the concierge desk met him with an uncanny, almost vacant smile when Thomas asked where he could find the ma√Ætre d'. ‚ÄúOur restaurant is truly charming, Mr. Fielding. I‚Äôm certain you'll enjoy it. The service here is simply impeccable,‚Äù he said in a smooth, unctuous manner - before pausing as if preparing to deliver bad news. ‚ÄúOur ma√Ætre d' can be found in his office. However, I must stress that he's only been with us for a few weeks.‚Äù

The concierge then turned to the receptionist, who was hanging key cards on the pine-panelled wall. ‚ÄúMs. Lopes, what name does our new ma√Ætre d' prefer again?‚Äù The question was odd, and the young receptionist looked unsure - her mouth somewhat agape, like she didn‚Äôt quite know how to reply. But before she could, the man answered himself. ‚ÄúAh yes - Brent.‚Äù Thomas noticed a faint smirk on the man‚Äôs face but couldn‚Äôt quite grasp the reason. ‚ÄúThe office next to the grand dining room.‚Äù

1muuol4,https://www.reddit.com/r/SurpriseAZ/comments/1muuol4/safe_ship_bad_experience_contracted_no_borders/,SAFE SHIP BAD Experience - Contracted No Borders Moving AZ - SCAMMED,"My experience with this moving company was appalling‚Äîmarked by hidden fees, overcharges, missing items, and property damage. They operate with coercive tactics and zero accountability.

We moved our family from OR to AZ -¬† Safe Ship just takes your¬† money and arranges for other carriers to deal with your things. During this move they assigned the job to No Borders Moving and Storage which has a VERY bad reputation. Then we dealt with another company in AZ called seventh generation moving and storage.¬†

They repeatedly told me we could revise our cubic feet during the process and then after it was done told me NO way it‚Äôs already delivered.

1. Unauthorized $2,000 ‚ÄúDelay‚Äù Fee On July 14, I was told delivery would occur Wednesday. I confirmed with their team that Monday, July 21 at 11 a.m. was acceptable. On July 17, I was told my goods would arrive over the weekend; again, I confirmed Monday delivery. No delivery was attempted Saturday or Sunday. Then, at 10 a.m. Monday, I was told I must pay $2,000 ($500/day per truck) to release my property.

This fee was never disclosed in advance and was applied under duress‚Äîessentially holding my belongings hostage until I paid. To make matters worse, they charged me for two trucks, even though the second carried only a handful of items.

2. Overcharges for Truck Space and Cubic Feet I originally contracted for 2,100 cubic feet after a detailed walkthrough of my home. The company later increased this to 2,800 cubic feet. To reduce costs, I sold significant furniture and items before pickup (outdoor equipment, dining room, a full bedroom set, foosball and shuffleboard tables) and called ahead to notify them. I was repeatedly told cubic footage would be adjusted during the move process. Everytime I called they said it would be done at the receipt.¬† Then I submitted a claim after receipt with details and pictures. Then a manager told me they WILL NOT revise it as it was already delivered - even after I got an email from customer support they would adjust it.¬†

At delivery, I confirmed that only \~1,700 cubic feet was actually used by measuring the trucks

* White truck: \~1,464 cf capacity, completely filled.
* Yellow truck: \~1,656 cf capacity but only 100‚Äì200 cf loaded.

Despite this, I was billed as though full capacity was used plus an additional truck. This is blatant overbilling. I demand a refund for the difference between the contracted and actual cubic footage.

3. Missing and Damaged Property Several items never arrived, including:

* Two kitchen boxes (containers, plates, bowls).
* One box of TV equipment (cables, chargers, Roku).

Damaged items included:

* Coffee table (unrepairable).
* Stand-up desk and sideboard.
* Multiple broken dishes (despite careful packing).
* Tonal gym equipment, which was transported upright instead of flat.

Additionally, the movers caused significant wall damage in my brand-new home (documented during walkthroughs).

4. Outsourcing to Disreputable CompaniesTo add insult, No Borders Moving and Storage (their subcontractor) does not handle claims through the party claims process. I was told to contact them directly‚Äîa company with a horrible reputation that predictably ignores claims.

This company engaged in breach of contract, deception, coercive billing, and negligence. I was overcharged, forced to pay hidden fees, lost property, and suffered damages.

If you value your money, property, and peace of mind, stay far away from this mover. They should be reported to the FMCSA and the state attorney general for their predatory practices.

I‚Äôve been researching espresso machines for a while and I‚Äôm ready to make a purchase, but I‚Äôd love some advice from people with hands-on experience. My budget is around ‚Çπ50K‚Äì60K.

Machines I‚Äôve shortlisted so far:

Lelit Anna PID

Gaggia Classic Pro

Costar Cosmos / Master 5S (local brand, steel build)

HiBREW H10 / G5 (budget-friendly newer Chinese brand)

Blue Tokai branded machine (rebranded model, limited info)


What I‚Äôm looking for:

Solid steel build (not plasticky)

Consistency + decent steaming for cappuccinos/lattes

Ideally with PID for temperature stability

Something that could last a few years without me regretting the choice

Support in India (Hyderabad in particular would be great)


Use case:

I‚Äôm a beginner but really into coffee‚Äîwant to learn proper espresso.

Daily use for myself.

Might eventually serve 20‚Äì30 cups/day if I set up a small caf√© concept.



Question:
Out of the above machines, which would you recommend for my use case? Anything I should absolutely avoid (bad service, build issues, poor steaming power)?

Any experiences from people here with service/parts would also be super helpful. üôè

Thanks in advance!

I was one of them. but I managed to get myself a good group of friends, and I think alot need to hear this, not some cheesy tactics but real advice, from a guy that did this.

most of these guys that dont have many friends and feel lonely, sits mostly at home and play video games all day or just lay in bed. that is the worst thing to do when you want new friends.

I just have 2 advice, but those are the only 2 advice you need!

number 1: BE SOCIAL! that doesn't mean to hang out with you imaginary friends, but to be out there, do stuff where other people are. join a soccer team, take a class in art or music or something your interested in, go to the gym or even get a job. Start doing stuff you want to do that outside your room. that is literally the best place to meet new people. I took my parachute license all alone, I was afraid and anxious, but there I met one of my today best friends. what im trying to tell you, is that the more you are out doing stuff where there are other people, the bigger your chance are to make new friends. there is one thing thats guaranteed and that is if your just sitting at home all day, you will never meet new people. Be open to talk to new people, dont be that guy that stand in the corner and looks down at the floor, go out of your comfort zone and talk, it can just be a ""hi, how are you doing?"".

  
number 2: take action! if you just met a guy you think was cool and you want to get to know him more, send him a message then, ask him if he want to meet and do something, grab a drink or coffee, go for a hike, whatever, just make the first move and make contact. you dont build friendships by meeting them one time and expect them to contact you. you have to contact them, show them you want to get to know them. Dont be afraid, the worst thing that can happen is they say no. BE BRAVE! 

But the most important thing is to get out of your bed and make some changes, be out there in society, do stuff. then you are guaranteed to at least meet new people. 

Hope this can help someone to get out there and live their life, and not waste it at home being lonely and depressed.

1muuafu,https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/1muuafu/an_amateur_wedding_photog_experience/,An amateur wedding photog experience,"I'm a hobby photographer. Friends and family seem to like my pictures. I was asked to photograph a wedding a month ago. For free. For my only sister's only child. I figured I could do it. I'd taken a few pictures while attending a wedding a decade and a half ago.

Of course this is all before reading the ""How to take pictures at a wedding"" responses at [https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/1mqwwj3/how\_to\_take\_pictures\_at\_a\_wedding/](https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/1mqwwj3/how_to_take_pictures_at_a_wedding/) ...The commentary there all strikes me as real, true, valid and seems like reasonable advice for that poster. I figured I'd offer my own post-wedding experience summary here:

I did the wedding solo with 3 cameras: One digital camera with kit lens (niece lives in another country, no good rental lens option) since it's what I have, I wouldn't have time to swap lenses during, and I needed both wide and zoom abilities. One forty year old 35mm camera with a nice little fixed prime, but which hasn't been advancing consistently since I recently discovered film still exists and pulled this camera out of a multi-decade storage. One nearly hundred year old Kodak medium-format camera, which I guess is also has a fixed prime lens, albeit mounted on a camera where the combo goes for about $5 on eBay.

I scoped out Pinterest for wedding photography ideas. I searched the web a bit for how weddings go in the target country and what the culture there expects of wedding photographs. YOLO?

Leading up to and day of I definitely was nervous. Day of, I mis-loaded the Kodak and got to hand re-spool the film in a mostly dark kitchen then electrical taped the outer seals to make sure I didn't get additional light leakage. I wasn't quite sure if the 35mm was fully caught on the advancing reel or if the reel was skipping. It became clear the venues were complicated spaces and lighting and weather were not going to do me any favors.

But you know...there were a tonne of cell phones present. It's not like there wouldn't be ANY memories recorded and shareable. Worst case the wedding couple is pretty chill and you get what you pay for, right? And bonus: A friend of the wedding party showed up a nice camera/lens, was poking around the edges and things, and I could hope they'd would have some worthwhile shots.

The morning after I was still nervous, but once I got the SD card onto the computer and saw some good pictures I started to relax. About 10%+ of my 1k digital pictures across a 14 hour day came out ""usable"". Many captures were duds, including ones which I knew were special, unique moments and I had hoped I might have caught with sufficient sharpness but hadn't quite. Still some I'd consider as being great, definitely print worthy. Certainly enough for a little coffee table gift book of memories. The bride's happy with what I edited/shared.

Two weeks later and I got the first film scans today. About 15% of those \~40 exposures look ""usable"". And a few are pretty close to great also.

Here's the thing though:

The old Kodak camera belonged to the bride's great grandfather. For one of the good shots from this roll (color positive) I will build a custom frame with a little battery/LED backlight, so the couple will have some literal captured photons and physics/chemistry, captured by family, on a family heirloom, which can hang on their wall as a little 6x9cm multi-layer memory of the special day.

I wouldn't do this for just anybody and probably for the vast majority of asks would simply say no for a weddings for all the reasons you folks kindly remind posters.

But getting that one slide was worth taking the chance. I'd encourage other hobbyists to chase those moments!",6,1755635834.0,photography,4,0.75,False

I am trying to make myself feel more ‚Äúlevel‚Äù , sometimes I wake up in a bad mood and I don‚Äôt know why, nothing is even wrong. 

I have great difficulty focusing on mundane tasks, I misplace my phone and keys on a daily basis - good old scatter brain in action. I really struggle at work to stay focused for 40 hours a week doing things I don‚Äôt want to do. 

Everyone else seems to be relatively happy and oblivious to life‚Äôs obstacles, sometimes it feels like my brain is going 1000 miles an hour with multiple thought streams going on. 

Here is a list of things I‚Äôve tried that have no effect on me what so ever. 

Modafinil - makes me feel slightly more awake for 2 hours then a horrible crash with severe fatigue for the rest of the day 

Caffeine - I can quite easily consume up to 600mg a day with no effects. I can drink a strong coffee and go to sleep 5 minutes later 

Ashgawanda KSM66 - 600mg a day for a month, no effects

Agmatine sulfate - varying doses from 200mg - 2000mg. No effects 

Phenethylamine - Up to 1500mg in one dose, no effects. I am aware it is broken down rapidly but hesitant to pair with a MAO-B inhibitor such as selegiline due to risk of hypertension. 

Pseudoephedrine - for motivation / concentration purposes. First time I ever tried it I took 120mg and felt like a veil had been lifted, I felt focused, at ease and content. Subsequent doses of up to 240mg spread throughout the day seemingly have no effects, apart from making me sweat and feel hot. 

Creatine - for its reported cognitive effects. No effects at doses of up to 20g a day spread out. But excellent for my weight training.

Nicotine - in gum form as I despise smoking. Did nothing for concentration, just gave me a nicotine addiction instead which I relapse from on and off. Can go months without any then one day I fancy some and buy it, even though it doesn‚Äôt do anything to me. 

Magnesium - in various forms - no effects 

L-Theanine - on its own and paired with caffeine up to 500mg. No effects 

Can anyone shed light what the hell is going on here. How can I be immune to all supplements when others report they work, is it just the placebo effect in action ? 

Are there any supplements you recommend I try to treat said symptoms. I just want to be able to get through a working day without it being a battle to stay focused on the task at hand

When Ramadan comes insha Allah, they may face the challenge of hiding their fast. I saw someone asking for help with this, so I wanted to share some ideas that can help people who might face such challenges.

Remember to use **as many of these ideas as possible** and not just one or two so that your behavior seems ""normal."" Also, **don't wait until Ramadan begins**. Start using these tips a few weeks beforehand so your family doesn't notice a sudden change in your habits, become suspicious, or link your behavior to fasting. Here are a few ideas to get you started.

1. Walk around the house with a bottle of water or a cup of tea, even if it's empty.
2. Come home with an almost empty box of pizza for example so it looks like you ""ate"" outside.
3. Say you've already eaten, for example, with friends or at work.
4. Order takeout to your home, receive it in front of your family, and then take it to your room to ""eat"" it later.
5. Try to have dinner with your family so they don't suspect you're purposely avoiding meals. Remember to avoid alcohol, pork, and non-halal meat.
6. Pretend to be snacking or drinking. Also, if you chew a special gum that does **not contain any substances** that will dissolve and enter the stomach, your fast is still valid. You can use such gum **just when needed** to prevent your family from becoming suspicious. Here is the [**reference**](https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/81437/chewing-gum-while-fasting).

First time posting on my new account! Looking for some advice, if anyone is willing.

  
I am reaching out to see if anyone with documentary producing / line producing experience (in the LA area) would be available to hop on zoom with me for a few minutes. Happy to Venmo you a cup of coffee!

I am preparing to produce / direct my first documentary short. I have a solid through-line, emotional arc and timeline of events to follow, as well as a professional relationship with the main subject I'll be filming.

I have experience in the industry as a writer, actor and some crew roles (AP, sound, PA) from 10 years ago. What I'm looking for specifically is to create a line budget for the short to present to funders.

My main questions are regarding the cost per day of absolute bare bones crew-- mostly one-on-one interviews with the same subject recurring over many months. I'm assuming I can pull off these shoots with super crew members in these roles:

1. camera

2. assistant camera / AD / PA (multiple hats)

3. sound / boom

(Am I overlooking something obvious? Is this doable?)

If that is indeed sufficient, I am looking for standard professional day rates for these positions. (Again, I'm putting together a budget at this stage.)

Any and all insight from you who have been through these steps is much appreciated! I'm passionate about this project so even if your advice is curt, I don't mind. 

Have a great day, cheers.

Start using these tips a few weeks beforehand so your family doesn't notice a sudden change in your habits, become suspicious, or link your behavior to fasting. Here are a few ideas to get you started.

1. Walk around the house with a bottle of water or a cup of tea, even if it's empty.
2. Come home with an almost empty box of pizza for example so it looks like you ""ate"" outside.
3. Say you've already eaten, for example, with friends or at work.
4. Order takeout to your home, receive it in front of your family, and then take it to your room to ""eat"" it later.
5. Try to have dinner with your family so they don't suspect you're purposely avoiding meals. Remember to avoid alcohol, pork, and non-halal meat.
6. Pretend to be snacking or drinking. Also, if you chew a special gum that does **not contain any substances** that will dissolve and enter the stomach, your fast is still valid.

Early in our relationship I guess him and my gf were FWB or something. They were together only twice AFAIk. We had a fight about him early in our relationship. At the time met me, she was sending him a postcard for his birthday and clearly had feelings for him. We were only going out a few weeks and weren‚Äôt fully exclusive so then I let it go.

We had a small fight and I asked her when we were exclusive to stop talking with him. Thats where I thought it was finished. Flash forward a nearly one year later and I use her laptop and I see on facebook messenger they are still friends and even talking. He asked for a coffee. Shes non committal and not exactly shutting it down.

We‚Äôve a big fight were we nearly break up and she then promises to stop talking to him.

Flash forward 5-6 years later. We start talking about spicing up the relationship. Not exactly opening it but maybe go to a sex club and explore boundaries. She mentions off hand she still considers some people in her past as good people. This specific guy comes up. And she said nothing.

Then a few days ago I get a feeling and check her phone. She wished him happy birthday and initiated a conversation. I can see he is married now and she discusses me and mentions we are building a life etc.

Cue another big argument. Shes hurt I don‚Äôt trust her and she said she didn‚Äôt do anything wrong and that she would never cheat on me. She wants to have kids with me. Make a life. That the guy was ugly and meant nothing. He‚Äôs bald and had a belly and used to fuck everything that moved when they were together, that she was just curious. 

I‚Äôm like curious about what? Like what the hell does an ex person mean from a long time ago? That if she wanted to cheat she wouldn‚Äôt trust me with her phone and wouldn‚Äôt leave it all open to see. She kind of implied I was a little controlling or jealous but I don‚Äôt care if she has platonic friendships but a guy she used to be with that I‚Äôve had repeated problems with?

I just feel so betrayed. Like I don‚Äôt get why she keeps this specific guy. This is like the 3rd or 4th we‚Äôve had a fight about him. Now she‚Äôs terrified in going to leave and acting all extra sexual and trying to initiate more.

# Hi everyone, I'm fairly new here. In fact I created this account to pose this question.

I recently obtained my MBA, and was a teacher for several years prior. I am looking to break into customer success as my first post grad role. I had an internship last year at an Ed Tech company where I worked in this capacity. I refuse to adopt to the doom and gloom mentality about the job market but I also want too be realistic about what is. My ideal career trek is to start in customer success, and eventually pivot into Wealth Management or Project Management.

I've been networking on LinkedIn and have had coffee chat's with the responsive alumni in my network. I spoke with one recently that is a CSM at a major firm and asked if I needed any additional licensure or certification. He said no, and that the object of the game is to let the company pay for it for you.

I'm at a bit of a loss and would appreciate any experienced CSM's input.

I‚Äôve just joined this community and finally feel I can truly get some understanding about how awful this condition is. 
I had a severe ulcer bleed in 2020 and ever since then I have been unable to swallow properly. I am under a specialisat and on strong PPIs, anti sickness and pain medication and nothing seems to be helping. I‚Äôve had 7 days endoscopies this year alone and i get flare ups that are so incredibly painful I have to attend emergency care for morphine. They say at least 75% of my oesophagus is ulcerated and inflamed. I choke on pretty mum anything, sometimes even swallowing wrong will trigger such a spasm of pain it takes my breath away. 
I‚Äôve cut out all triggers (vaping, spice food, coffee, onion, garlic, alcohol) and anything I find hard to eat. 
My specialist is now speaking with another about a type of surgery but at the moment I truly feel my life is not worth living. Between the pain, the exhaustion, the embarrassment of choking, I really feel I will be like this forever and I honestly cant face the future like this. 
Has anyone else been in this same position and has gotten better? I desperately need some hope.

In our eleven years of friendship a lot has changed between us WS. For example, you became a popular kid and I stayed a loser but we stayed friends. I matured but you kept that that same middle school attitude and humor.

I tried again and again and again to help you move past this 'phase' of yours. You were hurting people around you, sticking close to those people who used you for your money, drugs, and alcohol. I've been to you parties, I know what they're like, and I know what you're like. It broke my heart to hear that what people were saying about you were true. 

You were always such a nice kid and my best friend but I couldn't defend you so I distanced myself. You hardly never noticed. 

I had a dream about you last night, WS. We were kids again, sitting on the red slide at our playground and talking about what to play today at recess. Then we were at graduation, laughing and chatting like normal. We sat and watched the sunset and we talked some more. 

It hurts WS. It kills me. I'm grieving someone that's still alive. 

It feels like my heart's in my stomach, there's acid in my throat, and there's a traffic jam in my head. I loved you. I've always loved you more than a friend. But this? This isn't you and God I wish you could see it too.

Tunnel vision is so odd, isn't it?

I hope quantum immortality is a real thing because I wish someday there's a universe we're still hanging out everyday. I wish there is a universe that has the real you.

She had sat down for coffee with her mom when she suddenly said that she was going to go check the mail, and she'd be right back... she never returned. She was only wearing slippers when she left the house, and had plans to go shopping with her mother later that day.

She left her cancer meds, her phone, her glasses, her wallet, and her beloved dog at home. Police have thoroughly searched the property she disappeared from and the surrounding area - they are convinced she's no longer in the vicinity of her home. They cleared the property using drones and canines.

Something alarming happened before she went missing. Her brother said that a man ""posing as a woodcutter"" had been talking to her outside after she left the house, so he seems to be the last person to see her alive. I have no idea what ""posing as a woodcutter"" truly means - was this man a woodcutter or not?? I cannot find any further information on this guy, if he was interviewed, ruled out, came forward, was never found, etc. Apparently a Ring camera captured her leaving her home, but I cannot find any info on if this man was seen on camera too.

Police initially viewed Nicole's exboyfriend as a person of interest in her disappearance. I think this is because he had a prior criminal record so they made assumptions. Four days after her disappearance, his home and property were searched and they found no trace of Nicole and no signs of foul play. He's now been ruled out as a suspect in the case.

Just last month, the Dakota County Sheriff's office has pleaded for anyone with information to come forward. There is a $50,000 reward for any information that helps them solve the case. Nikki is described as 5-foot-6, 135 pounds with blonde hair and brown eyes. She was last seen wearing a long camo/grey sweater/shirt, dark pants and slipper sandals.

1mutnst,https://i.redd.it/1yyqf0xka1kf1.jpeg,Well it finally happened... again,"So a few weeks back, I accidentally tried to take off without removing my brake disc lock from the front wheel. First time it ever happened to me. Luckily I was able to keep the bike upright, and the bike was completely unharmed. Told myself I was getting a lanyard, and would use it every time. 

Fast forward to today, I'm out on a big long spin, and I stop off for a coffee at a garage. I put the lock on, and tell myself ""I'm only going in for 2mins, I don't need the lanyard"". I come out 15mins later, finish chatting to some friends on the phone, get my gear on and get ready to take off. Excited about the final leg of today's spin. I go to take off and suddenly feel the forks dump, bit of a bang, and the brake lever comes straight back to the throttle. Immediately realise I've made the same mistake twice. I kept the bike upright again, but when I look down I see the disc is bent this time. 

I really can't tell if it's just the disc, or if the calipers damaged as well. It doesn't look visually damaged, but the lever doesn't feel right. I'll have to wait to see what it's going to cost when the bike gets towed to the mechanic tomorrow. 

Feeling as embarrassed as I am annoyed.

I will NEVER ever not use the lanyard again ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. ",9,1755634447.0,motorcycles,23,0.74,False

1mutnnn,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1mutnnn/find_out_if_jura_ena_4_super_automatic_espresso/,Find Out If Jura ENA 4 Super Automatic Espresso Machine Lives Up To Reviews,"The Jura 15519 ENA 4, often seen in dazzling Nordic White, quickly became a staple in my daily routine. As someone who's borderline obsessed with coffee, the lure of an automatic coffee machine with promises of caf√©-quality drinks right at home was too good to ignore. After weeks of putting it through its paces‚Äîincluding supplying it with hefty bags of fresh beans and experimenting early-morning pre-coffee grogginess‚ÄîI‚Äôve formed some pretty solid opinions about it. From the features I couldn‚Äôt imagine living without to the quirks that could use a little polish, here‚Äôs my detailed take on this machine.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Right out of the box, the sleek design of this compact espresso maker caught my eye. It doesn‚Äôt scream for attention‚Äîits modern elegance with the Nordic White finish blends effortlessly into my kitchen. Measuring 17.5""D x 10.7""W x 12.7""H, it‚Äôs surprisingly slim, which is a boon for homes with limited counter space. I liked how it took its place snugly between the blender and toaster without hogging all the prime real estate. The buttons, intuitive and neatly arranged, are a bonus for someone like me who despises overly complicated interfaces. But‚Äîand here's a tiny gripe‚Äîa minor complaint is the weight. At 21 pounds, it isn‚Äôt exactly portable, so you'd better commit to its placement. 

**Strengths**  
- Compact size ideal for small kitchens.  
- Intuitive symbol display that simplifies navigation.  
- Professional Aroma Grinder ensures fresh, aromatic brews.  
- Sleek, minimalist design complements modern aesthetics.  
- Durable construction designed to last.

**User Experience: Effortless Simplicity**  
The fully automatic operation is a revelation, especially for someone who‚Äôs used to the slightly messy, hands-on process of a manual espresso machine. With the programmable coffee strength and volume settings, I could fine-tune my drinks to suit not just me but also my partner, who insists on weaker coffee for reasons I still don‚Äôt understand. I‚Äôve particularly enjoyed the option of using either pre-ground coffee or freshly ground beans depending on my mood or how much time I have in the morning. The Jura ENA 4 is not picky‚Äîit‚Äôs a coffee machine for the indecisive and the perfectionists alike.

**The Pulse Extraction Process (P.E.P.) Magic**  
As a coffee enthusiast, I couldn‚Äôt ignore the unique technologies packed into this coffee maker. The Pulse Extraction Process (P.E.P.) blew me away. It optimizes the extraction time for short specialty coffees, which translates to espressos that are punchy, aromatic, and full of flavor. That‚Äôs a fancy way of saying it knows how to make a killer shot of espresso. But here‚Äôs where I felt the pinch‚Äîthe process does take a teensy bit longer. It‚Äôs not a dealbreaker, but patience isn‚Äôt my strong suit. 

**Negatives**  
- Slightly noisy during the grinding and brewing stages.  
- Fixed milk frothing limitations, requiring a separate frother.  
- Extraction process may demand a little extra time.  

**Target Audience**  
This espresso machine feels tailor-made for espresso nerds and casual coffee drinkers alike. If you‚Äôve got a small-to-medium kitchen space and crave barista-grade coffee without leaving your home, this machine has you covered. However, if lattes and cappuccinos are your daily go-to and you need consistent milk frothing, you may want to consider pairing it with a dedicated frother. It‚Äôs clear this product aims primarily at those seeking quality black coffee drinks over elaborate milk-based brews.  

**Competing Products**  
The luxury coffee machine market has stiff competition, and I‚Äôd be remiss not to mention the likes of the Nespresso Vertuo Plus and the Breville Barista Express. Compared side by side, the Jura ENA 4 easily wins on versatility and bean-to-cup freshness thanks to its Professional Aroma Grinder. The Breville machines might edge it out on milk steaming options integrated into the system (a department where this Jura machine falls short). Meanwhile, Nespresso sacrifices freshness in favor of capsule-based convenience. None of these options bring the same sleekness and space-saving design to the table.  

**Quality for Price**  
Given its premium features, this unit‚Äôs pricing sits well in line with its feature set and direct competitors. That said, it‚Äôs not the cheapest of its kind, and you are paying for the brand's engineering reliability and cutting-edge brewing method. Whether the investment is ‚Äúworth it‚Äù largely depends on how much weight you assign to convenience, compact size, and technological shot-making prowess. All things considered, for anyone tired of inconsistent manual brews or pricier coffee shop runs, it‚Äôs a compelling buy.

Well, this is also a post to cheers myself to a better glutamate-free life. I cut down caffeine from 2 cups of coffee to 2 cups of tea and finally down to just one cup of black or green tea a day.
