100 days seemed like sooo long. I knew I wouldn‚Äôt waver; but DAMN if I wanted to some days. Damn if I‚Äôm tempted to try to moderate now. 

100 consecutive days + Dry January = I‚Äôve been sober for most of the year. It hasn‚Äôt been a panacea like so many people have claimed. 

I still struggle with my mental health. 

I have continued to lose weight, but it wasn‚Äôt like it melted off over night. Most of it I lost while still drinking. 

I‚Äôm more productive, but still don‚Äôt have tons of energy. I‚Äôm drinking coffee daily now. 

I feel like I register others‚Äô problems more and their energy weighs heavier on me than before. 

I miss the buzz. I miss the taste of alcohol. 

BUT

I‚Äôm relieved not to add hangovers to the mix of my existential dread. üòÖ

My liver enzymes dropped more than half. üôÄ Totally in the healthy range now. 

I‚Äôm not wasting money every weekend.

1lw26kp,https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/1lw26kp/gone_to_colorado_a_short_story_of_a_modern_day/,"Gone to Colorado, a short story of a modern day romantic tragedy","The day we met, I was split in two.

Before her, my only real love was nature. The balance, beauty and chaos of life. The middle of the woods has always been my temple; quiet to the sounds of man, but loud with the sounds of birds, bugs, and frogs. After so many dates and relationships that felt.. empty, like something was missing. Honestly, I had given up on the whole idea of love. I quit my job in the city, trying to save the environment (and us) from climate change from a D.C. office had proven futile, and with the impending doom of the incoming administration‚Äôs war against nature, I needed fresh air. I needed to clear my head, rethink my life, and pivot into something that actually fulfilled me spiritually.¬†

And then I met her. I was leaning up against a planter outside the coffee shop next to her apartment building and she was coming down to meet me. The air was electric, my heart was racing, but I was trying as hard as I could to act casual. It wasn‚Äôt more than a few minutes waiting for her to come down the elevator, but it felt like ages. Then, there she was. Everything went silent, like when you‚Äôre driving up a mountain and your ears are about to pop. A few paces forward and as we met, I lifted her and her legs wrapped around me. She was weightless; I was weightless. Our faces came a few millimeters apart and we didn‚Äôt say a word. Just breathed. That breath was the start of my life. The first¬†*actual*¬†breath I ever took. Every cell in my body was vibrating. Not an alarmed vibration, but a deep, calm hum. I was home. We just stayed like that. We didn‚Äôt kiss. I don‚Äôt know if we even said, ‚Äúhi.‚Äù I don‚Äôt know how long it was. Maybe a minute, just breathing and giggling. We had never met before, in this life, but everything felt as if I had known her forever. When I finally put her down, it was like stepping out of the house in the Wizard of Oz. Everything was different, as if I was just seeing color for the first time.¬†

Then I felt myself split right in half. I had just signed a lease in Colorado. We had a month. She knew it. Actually, it's the only reason she finally decided to meet me. As she was too busy in her professional career to entertain my consistent texts like a puppy who needs a walk. I didn‚Äôt blame her. I was crazy about her from the first message. That first breath, though. The moment I looked into her eyes, I knew this was different. Did she feel it too? My whole world turned upside down. I played it cool and walked on the ceiling. I drove upside down all the way home. It still hasn‚Äôt flipped back the right way.

I was lost. I was lost before, getting ready to pack up my life and move across the country, but now.. She was everything. Everything I was leaving this city to go find. The wonder, the complexity and the mystery of mother nature in her entirety; All in the eyes of this little girl. She is a foot shorter than me, but has the gravity of the moon. Enough to make entire oceans swell with the tides. I could swear that her mood controls the weather. It rained that entire month. Maybe she did feel it too.

We pretended like everything was okay, we laughed and swooned the whole month long. Then it got down to the last week. She asked me not to go. She almost begged for a moment. I felt myself tear farther apart. It killed me. I didn‚Äôt want to go any more. I had to. Partly for that half of myself that was pulling that way, and partly because I had already made the commitments to the lease, my roommate. I was lost. She was home, and I was leaving.¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a year, we can keep this flame alive.‚Äù I begged her, ‚ÄúI will come back to you.‚Äù

I meant it with every bone in my body. For a little while she believed me.¬†

We made it almost two weeks before she said it was too difficult. Really I didn‚Äôt blame her, but it was devastating all the same. I was naive for thinking she would stick around for a guy like me. I‚Äôm 30, with my head in the clouds. I‚Äôm a broke philosopher with dreams, who moved across the country with no job. I‚Äôve got a degree, a good attitude and work ethic, I know I‚Äôll find my way. Who knows, if I find a good enough job and get myself a career fast enough, maybe I‚Äôll get her back and this story will continue.

Walking around with a pit in my stomach like a part of me is missing, but I don‚Äôt want that piece back. I gave it to her willingly. If she never comes back to me, I‚Äôm happy to have the reminder that she is out there somewhere existing, even if it hurts. Life is funny that way, I suppose.",1,1752116762.0,love,1,1.0,False

I was sober for a few years before that tho.  I couldn't walk and was stuck in bed in a ball crying. I am a live in care giver and had to call my clients parents to get him ready cause i couldnt stand.  I threw up but only a few times and had chills but those happen frequently. 

I kept getting close to going to the e.r but decided i would rather be in my bed suffering then a hospital. They probably wouldnt give me pain meds anyway and fluids and stuff i can do on my own. The next day it still hurt to walk, eating made it worse , it hurt to breath but I was able to function enough to talk and walk around or do daily activities. I did throw up again but I think its cause I made poor decisions like drink coffee.
I spent the day in my bed not even wanting to be on my phone, miserable but fine. I did call and they said I could stay home. 

The whole time tho I did have an appetite, and stuff. But eating and drinking even water made it hurt a lot. I started fasting today  and drinking water and feel almost fine.  My back hurts Hella but I started my period and it always hurts on my period. 

I am nervous because In the past I was a extremly heavy drinker but for a very short amount of time.  I also abused nyquil and would drink a whole bottle some times. I also had suicide attempts where I took 100 sleeping pills with nyquil. Or having a deadly blood alcohol level. After each hospitalization everything was checked and was fine. Everyone always said im really lucky which i agree. I have a Dr's appointment and now that im fine im kinda embarrassed to go for being dramatic. Especially after reading post like annoyed about people being dramatic over their stomach problems makes me feel like i am. I always just feel really dramatic. i just am embarrassed to tell my doctor about drinking and taking the nyquil. I have done 1000 hours of treatment and am just done with it. I am doing extremely well and happy besides this incident. And I read if its acute your levels go back to normal so is there even a point in going and getting it checked?

I want peace but I feel trapped,"There‚Äôs a girl in my office I‚Äôve liked for a long time. Over time we got close  casual hangouts, coffee, sometimes even shopping. I confessed my feelings to her. She politely rejected me, and I respected that by stepping back.

But after some time, we somehow fell back into the same pattern. She got comfortable again. We‚Äôd talk about life, her problems, everything. I tried to stay casual, but deep down I knew I was getting emotionally attached again.

I started noticing another guy in her life  someone she clearly prioritizes. That triggered jealousy, anxiety, and honestly, a lot of pain. So I tried to step back once more.

But here‚Äôs the truth: I feel stuck in this loop. My mind replays everything. I overthink, I overanalyze, and every time I try to detach, something pulls me back. Maybe it's the hope, maybe it's the bond I don't even know anymore.

Im angry at you. I miss you.
I've cried. Some days I couldn't even get out of bed. 
I feel like such a fool for letting myself get so attached. For not being more careful when I didn't know where you stood. But I wanted to be hopeful. I wanted to believe it was real. Because it felt so good to be with you. You made me feel safe and special. I thought if I tried hard enough I could keep it alive.
Look where that's gotten me now.
If only you had figured it out earlier, maybe I would have been spared some of the pain.
At least it didn't go on longer I guess.
I'm not going to tell you all this because it's not all your fault. I still think you're kind and mean well. I am young and naive and thought everything was perfect because I've never experienced anything like that before. I knew you were older and more experienced than me, but your confidence and kindness allowed me to feel safe and be vulnerable with you.
I'd never been cuddled to sleep. I'd never woken up next to someone and they've made me coffee. I'd never cuddled while watching tv with someone. I'd never showered with someone. I did all those things with you. I thought you liked me. I still think you did, but that wasn't enough. 
I wish we could have communicated better. I wish we told eachother all our worries and doubts and made everything more clear. I would hope that we would have worked it out that way, maybe we wouldn't have, but at least then I wouldn't have felt so blindsided by you.

I don‚Äôt get hungover anymore. But I do forget things. I miss work meetings sometimes, and other times attend them and have no recollection of what I said. That scares me. Being a ‚Äúhigh-functioning alcoholic‚Äù means my tolerance level has reached a record high.

I drink out of habit and I think need. It‚Äôs an urge I need to fulfill. I want to stop but feel I lack the agency to do so.

I‚Äôm irritable and angry sometimes after I drink and am completely self-aware of this every time. It‚Äôs affecting my family.

I did a work health screening this week and my glucose and non-HDL cholesterol levels were alarming. They weren‚Äôt as high last year.

Any advice? I really appreciate everyone out here sharing great stories of recovery.

Also: I 99% have undiagnosed ADHD and alcohol is for sure a coping mechanism and I‚Äôm worried about losing it as a support tool.",1,1752115959.0,stopdrinking,0,1.0,False

Now title is ‚Äúdiscussion about health‚Äù,"Yesterday I made Paneer cheesy maggie with caramelised onions and half boiled egg after a long time, it‚Äôs been a while since I last cooked/baked(apart from making dosas, idly, coffee, etc..,)

I love cooking but lately this intense heat makes me to procrastinate it. Nanbargale, just think about your parents/partners withstanding the heat and preparing everything for you, please do not take it for granted; try to appreciate them regularly.

Now coming to the point:

Yesterday I was able to make this dish and enjoyed while watching ‚ÄúDinner With Sathyeah‚Äù, I have been putting off watching that video for days just because I wanted to pair it while eating this dish.

That video was very relatable for me, I used to make those dishes and pretend like I invented it; I encourage everyone who doesn‚Äôt cook to try cooking/ baking it‚Äôs fun, therapeutic, you can experiment and invent new recipes.

Past few days were worse for me, I literally had a breakdown in public but somehow managed to marachufy (hide) it from others, but today I had a good time, had a good meal, watched a wholesome video

I thank Sathyeah for that video, I request you to please continue this series. I wish I could ride my bicycle to somewhere like you mentioned, but there is no such place nearby.

Now a note to JK, I am so sorry that you are going through this, I can understand how hard it must be, I am glad that you got to unburden. 

I hate when people do this, like constantly pressuring others, talking shit about them just because they are famous. Like who gave these assholes right to abuse anyone, I know this is how internet works but abusing people is unfair and unacceptable!

I was devastated to hear you were a S* victim, I am sorry for what you had went through, I hope everything goes well for you, keep doing what you like; it‚Äôs okay if you need to take a break, I hope people will understand it

Guys your health is more important than anything else, so please take care of yourself, keep thriving, sometimes things will be bitter but everything will eventually heal it just takes time, please do not take any harmful decisions

Anyone can reach out to me if you need someone rant/vent out or talk to.

Or if you don‚Äôt feel like sharing things with strangers, you can reach out to Chatgpt, trust me when I say this, gpt supports you exceptionally and it is way better than any other ai(P.S.: this is not a sponsored content or something, I use gpt for years now, from the time Open AI released it)

TL;DR:

Try to appreciate your parents/partners for their efforts

Encouraging people to try cooking/baking

Appreciated Sathyeah for his post

A note to JK about recent issue

Requesting everyone to take care of their health (both mentally and physically), things will change overtime, so keep thriving until then

Bupropion is a dogshit med along with SSRI‚Äôs.I have been diagnosed with ADHD, depression, anxiety and whatnot. Mostly against my will when I was underage. The only diagnosis I sought out was ADHD because I recognized that it impeded with my ability to do well in school. I also struggle with SUD. I mostly believe that ADHD coupled with SUD has caused me to develop depressive and anxious symptoms. Due to some inconveniences I have had to join a mental health program and they first prescribed me some Lexapro but I decided to switch to bupropion since I had heard it helped with attention. I have been and to some extent still am very much against taking antidepressants, especially SSRI‚Äôs due to their side effects and dependance liability. I don‚Äôt want to become dependent on a drug that makes me a shell of my former self, makes me fat, numb and doesn‚Äôt even make me feel good, that‚Äôs why Ive self medicated through drugs,and alcohol. I‚Äôve found that in my experience I have felt depressed when my life sucked. I believe that depression in my case has been entirely circumstantial. So a pharmaceutical drug might help to give me that push but the rest is entirely up to me. I have been reading reports of bupropion increasing suicidal thoughts and behaviors in both pediatric and adult populations, which is very concerning to me. I have actually been struggling with these thoughts as of recently which is lines up with this research. This drug also seems to lead to cognitive decline‚Äî it is an acetylcholine antagonist, which is why it is effective in smoking cessation (it essentially mitigates the reward you get from nicotine) and this can lead to difficulty in cognition, memory, and attention. So a drug that increases dopamine and adrenaline, but decreases the binding of acetylcholine being used for ADHD is just really stupid to me. When I go without adderall, I just use copious amounts of caffeine and nicotine to function at 100%. Something like bupropion reduces the efficacy of nicotine, and makes my heart pound when I drink coffee, and I have experienced little to no benefits to focus or depression‚Ä¶ This drug is trash for me and I would not like to continue its use as it is potentially harmful to cognition with no benefits and high potential of terrible downsides. I will stick to low dose adderall, working out, cigarettes and coffee.

I am open to healthy discussion and criticism

TLDR- I believe depression is more circumstantial than mental or an issue of neurotransmission, I dislike most psychiatric drugs other than Adderall and other true stimulants. Bupropion has had no effects on me and is potentially harmful to cognition. I will stick to caffeine and nicotine and will continue to cycle on and off of adderall.",1,1752115854.0,Wellbutrin_Bupropion,0,0.67,False

That Sunday, 6/22, was blacked out but I still wanted to travel somewhere, so I decided to take the first flight from MCO to Buffalo and the last flight back.

Hope this inspires/helps anyone who might want to take a trip like this, and I'd be happy to answer any questions though I feel like it's pretty clear haha. It was cheap too, regular GoWild fare of $30.62 roundtrip and the bus fare was $5 for the full day. Everything else such as souvenirs and food was optional so you could bring your own meals and easily make it a very budget friendly trip. Frontier also gave everyone a digital $15 meal voucher due to the delay, and a $50 flight voucher only to be used on airfare, which is not very useful for GW unfortunately but it's something at least.

I swallowed, forcing myself to think clearly. I needed to end this dinner.

Would he?

Every muscle in my body went rigid, my heart plummeting to my stomach. I didn‚Äôt need to turn around to know who it was.

----------------------------
AMARA
Being Alexander Hayes‚Äô little secret was worth every sacrifice, every moment of hiding, and every challenge. He had given me everything I never thought I could have. He helped me escape the crushing debt left by my late parents, pulled me from the gutters, and offered me a life of luxury I never dreamed possible.
For the past three years, I‚Äôve been living in the shadows, keeping our relationship a secret. But it never bothered me. I didn‚Äôt care about being unseen, as long as I had his undivided attention when it mattered most. As long as he made time for me, remembered my birthday, didn‚Äôt forget the little things either‚Äîlike knowing when my monthly cycle arrived, sending me chocolates, and showing me how much he cared in his own way.
He made sure I had the best of everything‚Äîmy wardrobe always stocked with the latest trends, and my collection of diamonds and gold growing with each passing month. I didn‚Äôt need to ask for any of it. He just made sure I had everything I could ever want.
And at the end of every day, I went to sleep knowing one simple thing: he was mine. That was all that mattered.
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, Xander never actually said he loved me‚Äîthose words never crossed his lips. But in the way he showed up for me, in the little gestures, I knew he cared. 
The few times I crossed paths with his family, or perhaps I should say the few times his family just so happened to run into me while I was at his place, it was always awkward. They never liked me, and I could see it in their eyes, the way they looked down on me. But Xander never let that bother him. He never once hesitated to stand up for me, even if they didn‚Äôt understand why.
My thoughts were interrupted by the sudden chime of my phone beside me. A smile immediately spread across my face, and without hesitation, I set the bottle of oil down, the one I was using to massage into my skin, and grabbed the phone. I knew exactly who it was‚ÄîXander, of course.
I had no friends, and I wasn‚Äôt the type to mingle with others. The few people I interacted with, aside from him, were mostly just distant acquaintances. 
The message popped up, and I couldn‚Äôt help but grin as I read it:
‚ÄúI‚ÄôM ON MY WAY HOME. YOU WANT ME TO GET YOU ANYTHING WHILE STOPPING BY YOUR PLACE?‚Äù
Xander had been away for a month on a business trip, and I‚Äôd missed him terribly.
I quickly typed back, ‚ÄúYOU DON‚ÄôT HAVE TO GET ME ANYTHING, I‚ÄôM NOT HOME.‚Äù
My lips couldn‚Äôt help but stretch into an uncontrollable grin. The thought of surprising him, of him walking into his apartment and finding me waiting for him in his tub, covered in oil‚Äîwell, it thrilled me. 
The phone buzzed again, pulling me out of my daydream. His message flashed across the screen:
‚ÄúWHERE ARE YOU AMARA? I KNOW YOU HAVE NO FRIENDS.‚Äù
It was almost funny how well he knew me. I couldn‚Äôt hide anything from him, not even the smallest detail. It felt like he had a way of seeing right through me.
‚ÄúI AM OUT OF TOWN TO HAVE A BIT OF GOOD TIME ALONE, AND MAYBE HOPEFULLY MAKE FRIENDS.‚Äù
Biting my lower lip, I stared at the screen, waiting for his response.
‚ÄúI HOPE YOU MAKE FRIENDS TOO. CALL ME WHEN YOU GET BACK SO I CAN SEND SOMEONE TO PICK YOU UP.‚Äù
The words made me smile again. 
Who wouldn‚Äôt want that kind of attention? Who would want to leave with this kind of gesture?
‚ÄúTHANK YOU,‚Äù I typed quickly before putting the phone down.
I picked up my wine glass and took a sip, but before it could get down my throat, I heard the doorbell. 
I frowned, puzzled. 
It couldn‚Äôt be Xander‚Äîhe won‚Äôt ring the doorbell in his own house.
‚ÄúThat had better not be his mother,‚Äù I muttered under my breath as I reluctantly pulled myself from the warm water. 
Reaching for my robe, I wrapped it around myself and quickly tied the sash before making my way downstairs.
I reached the bottom of the stairs just as I heard a female voice echo through the hallway. ‚ÄúIs Xander home?‚Äù
Grace, the housekeeper, responded in her usual calm tone. ‚ÄúNo, not yet. He hasn‚Äôt been home in a month.‚Äù
Why was Grace giving out so much information? 
Frowning, I rounded the hallway to stop at the first-floor landing. From there, I leaned against the railing, my gaze fixed on the woman in the living room below.
I‚Äôd never forget this woman. She was Xander‚Äôs first love, the one who came before me. The one who, if I were honest, haunted me in the back of my mind. Xander had just broken up with her when we started seeing each other, and he had made it clear from the start that I was nothing more than a rebound. I didn‚Äôt care back then‚Äîbut now‚Ä¶ now, I cared. More than I wanted to admit.
Maybe I had convinced myself that Isabelle was gone for good‚Äîthat she was a part of Xander‚Äôs past that would never resurface. Maybe that was why I never really felt threatened by her before. But standing at the top of the stairs, watching her in the living room, l felt uneasy.
I took a deep breath and straightened my back before walking down the stairs to confront her. I didn‚Äôt care who she was anymore; I wasn‚Äôt going to let her waltz back into Xander‚Äôs life without making it clear that I wasn‚Äôt backing down.
‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù I demanded, playing the part of someone who had no idea who this woman was. ‚ÄúAnd what are you doing here?‚Äù
Isabelle slowly turned her head towards me, her gaze meeting mine with a calm, almost amused expression. 
There was something about her‚Äîsomething that told me she wasn‚Äôt just a blast from Xander‚Äôs past, but someone who still had a place in his life. She looked me up and down with a soft, stoic expression on her face. ‚ÄúYou must be Amara.‚Äù
I raised an eyebrow. How the hll did she know my name?
As if she had read my mind, Isabelle smiled, a slow, knowing smile that made my stomach twist. She stood up from the couch and started walking towards me. She made her way up the stairs, closing the distance between us. ‚ÄúXander told me a lot about you.‚Äù
My face twisted in confusion and irritation. ‚ÄúI beg your pardon?‚Äù
Isabelle stopped right in front of me, her eyes trailing slowly over my body. I felt her gaze starting from my oiled-up legs and moving upward, lingering for a moment longer than I was comfortable with. She paused at my face, her lips curving into a small, amused smile. ‚ÄúXander mentioned you a few times,‚Äù she mused. ‚ÄúI guess the rebound sx between you both was really great for him to have mentioned you a few times when we were having a conversation.‚Äù
I was left speechless, my mind racing as I tried to process the words she had just thrown at me. How was I supposed to react when I found out that the man I had been sleeping with‚Äîand, perhaps foolishly, starting to care about‚Äîhad been discussing our private moments with his ex?
Isabelle smiled, clearly enjoying the discomfort she was causing. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look so surprised, love,‚Äù she taunted, her voice dripping with sarcasm. ‚ÄúYou aren‚Äôt the first rebound relationship he‚Äôs had since we broke up. However, you are going to be his last‚Äîespecially since he‚Äôs been hinting at marriage and kids.‚Äù
What. The. Fk. Was. Happening?
Xander had been talking about marriage and kids with her? How was I supposed to take that?
I crossed my arms in front of me, trying to appear stronger than I felt. ‚ÄúXander isn‚Äôt home right now, so I think you should come back later.‚Äù
Isabelle‚Äôs eyes locked onto mine. ‚ÄúI know he‚Äôs on his way from the airport.‚Äù She deadpanned, her voice even, unbothered. ‚ÄúAfter all, we‚Äôve been communicating.‚Äù
I had never heard Xander speak to her, not once. 
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt believe me?‚Äù Isabelle asked with a mocking chuckle, clearly enjoying the way she was getting under my skin. ‚ÄúHow did you think I got to know about your affair with him? Something the public doesn‚Äôt know?‚Äù
I hated myself for even beginning to doubt my own understanding of the situation. Slowly, her words began to take root in my mind.
I forced myself to stay calm. ‚ÄúLike I said, Xander isn‚Äôt ho‚Äî‚Äù
‚ÄúHe hinted at getting married and having babies, then told me to come home.‚Äù Her voice dropped lower, raspier, as she took a step forward, closing the small space between us. ‚ÄúWhat do you think that implies?‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to have to ask you to leave,‚Äù I gritted out.
Isabelle chuckled again while nodding, stepping back as if she had accomplished exactly what she‚Äôd set out to do. ‚ÄúI came here today to give you some advice, and I think I‚Äôve done just that. If you want to remain with him and get hurt, then please, be my guest.‚Äù
With that, she turned on her heel and sashayed out of the house, leaving me standing there, seething in her wake.
And just like that, everything that had been building up in me‚Äîthe excitement of seeing Xander, the plans I‚Äôd been making‚Äîwas ruined. The mood for tonight was completely destroyed.
AMARA
Yes, I did not wait at home for Xander to come back that day.
Yes, I know I might be sulking right now, but honestly, I don‚Äôt care. Not even a little. Not only did I leave Xander‚Äôs house that day, but I‚Äôve been avoiding him ever since. I‚Äôve even lied to him, telling him that I‚Äôm not in the city while, in reality, I‚Äôm holed up in a hotel just a few miles away from his place, trying to sort through my feelings and clear my head.
It took one final phone call from him earlier today to make me realize how badly I was handling this.
I was letting my jealousy and insecurities get the best of me. I was overreacting, letting the words of some woman‚Äîa woman whose version of things might not even be true‚Äîdictate my actions.
How could I let her make me question everything I had with Xander? He‚Äôs always been there for me. He‚Äôs been supportive, caring, and consistent. If he wanted to move on, if he was serious about being with someone else, I was sure he would have enough respect to tell me about it.
Right?
Pulling into the parking lot of a random restaurant, I made up my mind. I was going to surprise Xander tonight. I didn‚Äôt tell him I would be coming over, but I thought it would be a nice gesture to surprise him and dinner.
I turned off the engine, stepped out of the car, and walked inside, placing an order for take-out. Afterward, I sat down, waiting for my food to be prepared.
As I tried to relax, scanning the room and letting the hum of the restaurant calm me, my gaze landed on a familiar face. Isabelle. I recognized her instantly.
But she wasn‚Äôt alone.
Xander sat across from her, looking completely at ease. His shoulders were relaxed, a sign that they were having an easy, comfortable conversation‚Äîone that made me feel like an intruder just by witnessing it. Isabelle laughed at something he said, and without hesitation, reached out to touch Xander‚Äôs hand. He didn‚Äôt pull away. He let her.
My chest tightened with hurt, jealousy, and maybe even a little anger. Why was she still so close to him? Why was he letting her touch him like that?
I felt my hands ball into fists at my sides, but I stayed rooted to the spot, not moving. I couldn‚Äôt approach them. I couldn‚Äôt let him see me in this state. Xander had always made it clear that we were supposed to keep things private and not make us public.
That was the only rule Xander had ever given me, and as much as I wanted to ignore it, I knew I had to respect it. I couldn‚Äôt break that boundary, no matter how much it stung.
Taking a deep breath, I reached for my purse, my fingers trembling slightly as I fished out my phone. With my eyes never leaving Isabelle and Xander, I dialed his number, hoping for a response. 
The seconds dragged on like hours as the phone vibrated in my ear, and I saw Xander reach into his chest pocket, pulling out his own phone. He glanced at the screen, said something quietly to Isabelle, and then abruptly disconnected the call.
My chest tightened. Xander never ignored my calls unless he was in an important meeting. 
I dialed his number again, desperately hoping for an answer, but once again, he disconnected the call before it could even ring properly.
I scoffed, the sound bitter and full of pain.
‚ÄúMa‚Äôam,‚Äù a voice called out, his tone polite, ‚Äúyour order is ready.‚Äù
I blinked rapidly, forcing myself to tear my gaze away from Xander and his‚Ä¶ date? Or whatever she was. Forcing a smile, I gave a tight nod. ‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù I muttered, barely managing to get the words out.
I took the order quickly and turned quickly, trying to escape before they could see the pain etched on my face. I needed to leave before I got caught, before I allowed myself to break.
***************
Seated in the dining room, a champagne flute in my hand, nearly filled to the brim, I stared blankly at the dinner in front of me. My appetite had completely disappeared, replaced by a gnawing emptiness in my chest that I couldn‚Äôt shake off.
The sudden sound of the door beeped, pulling me from my thoughts. I blinked, slowly turning my gaze toward the sound, and heard Xander‚Äôs familiar voice call out, ‚ÄúAmara?‚Äù
I looked up just as he appeared in the hallway, his tall frame standing in the doorway. He walked toward me, his usual warmth radiating from him. ‚ÄúHow are you home?‚Äù he asked, his voice gentle as he came over to kiss my cheek. ‚ÄúYou should have told me, so my driver could pick you up.‚Äù
I forced a smile, not wanting to ruin the moment, though it felt hollow. Xander never offered me love‚Äînot the kind I wanted. I had no right to be upset. None.
‚ÄúI did call you, but you didn‚Äôt answer,‚Äù I replied as I stared at his face, searching for any sign of guilt or acknowledgment.
Xander pulled his phone from his pocket and scrolled through it for a moment, his brow furrowing slightly before he slipped it back into his pocket. ‚ÄúI was in an important meeting.‚Äù
With Isabelle, I thought bitterly.
I couldn‚Äôt stop myself. ‚ÄúYou usually text whenever you‚Äôre in an important meeting,‚Äù I pointed out softly.
Xander pulled out a seat beside me and sat down, casting a quick glance at the food on the table before letting out a soft chuckle. ‚ÄúPlease tell me you didn‚Äôt make this.‚Äù
I followed his gaze, unable to hold back a small laugh myself. ‚ÄúOf course I didn‚Äôt,‚Äù I replied dryly. I had spent so much time trying to take care of myself from a young age that I‚Äôd never bothered to learn how to cook. Cooking just wasn‚Äôt in my skill set.
‚ÄúI‚Äôll quickly take my shower and come down,‚Äù he said, completely ignoring my earlier remark. He gave me a gentle kiss on the temple before standing up and heading toward the stairs.
I stayed seated for a moment, but curiosity gnawed at me. Instead of waiting for him to come back, I stood up and followed him upstairs. Maybe it was just the need to fill the silence, maybe I was just looking for answers to questions I hadn‚Äôt yet asked.
As I walked into the room, I quietly made my way to the closet, reached for the jacket he just wore out, picked it up and slipped my hand into the pocket.
The crinkling of paper caught my attention, and I pulled out an invoice from JK Jewelry. My heart skipped a beat as I read the details: Necklace ‚Äì Paid in full.
He bought a necklace. For whom? Was it for me?
Brows furrowing, I quickly searched through his pants, but when I didn‚Äôt find the necklace, I grew even more uneasy. My steps took me to the drawers next. Part of me still didn‚Äôt want to believe that Xander could have bought it for Isabelle, but deep down, I knew it was starting to make sense. 
When I didn‚Äôt find the necklace anywhere in the room, that sinking feeling in my gut told me what I didn‚Äôt want to admit‚ÄîI might have been right.
He might have actually bought the necklace for Isabelle.
I placed the invoice back in his jacket pocket, trying to shake off the ache in my chest. Almost out of the closet, I froze as I heard his phone chime from the bedside table. I didn‚Äôt touch it‚Äîthere was no need to. The message was visible on the screen, clearly readable without unlocking it.
It was from Isabelle.
‚ÄúTHANK YOU FOR TODAY, AND THANK YOU FOR THE GIFT, I REALLY LOVE IT AND I LIKE THE FACT THAT YOU REMEMBERED WHAT TODAY WAS. I WON‚ÄôT FORGET NEXT WEEK, IT IS A DATE.‚Äù
Next week? What on e–∞rth was happening next week? What was she referring to? 
I heard the sound of the bathroom door creaking open, and in a panic, I quickly turned off the phone screen and rushed back to my side of the closet, trying to steady my breath. 
I heard his footsteps shuffling, and then they abruptly stopped. ‚ÄúAmara?‚Äù He sounded surprised to find me there. ‚ÄúI thought you‚Äôd be waiting in the dining room.‚Äù
I grabbed a sweater off the shelf, waving it in his direction. ‚ÄúI was feeling a bit cold,‚Äù I lied.
‚ÄúCold?‚Äù His hand touched my shoulder, and I stiffened slightly at the unexpected warmth. ‚ÄúI can warm you up.‚Äù
Not tonight. Not after everything I had learned. ‚ÄúHow about we get through dinner first?‚Äù
He kissed my hair softly, a gesture that used to melt me but now felt hollow. ‚ÄúSure.‚Äù
Pulling out of his hold, I walked briskly out of the closet, hoping that by the time he joined me, I could bury this sudden heaviness and convince myself it didn‚Äôt matter.
XANDER
I never really imagined myself getting married. It wasn‚Äôt something that ever crossed my mind as a priority in my life. But now, in this moment, with everything happening around me‚Äîmy parents pressuring me, the board constantly breathing down my neck‚Äîsuddenly, the thought of it doesn‚Äôt seem all that bad. Maybe marriage is the answer, or at least the solution they all want me to find. They expect it, and I‚Äôm starting to feel like I have no choice but to follow through, no matter how foreign the idea feels to me.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a good thing you didn‚Äôt bring that blonde gold-digger with you tonight,‚Äù my sister, Laura, said, her voice tight with irritation. She forced her lips into a smile, but her eyes betrayed her frustration. 
She was careful, making sure her expression remained neutral, fully aware that the cameras were always watching, ready to capture anything that could be twisted or misinterpreted. ‚ÄúI still don‚Äôt understand what you see in her.‚Äù
My face remained as cold and unreadable as it had been since the moment I walked through the door. ‚ÄúIf you want me to avoid you the entire night, then keep talking,‚Äù I said flatly.
Laura, not at all impressed by my stoic response, muttered under her breath, though I caught every word. ‚ÄúAnd of course, you always defend her,‚Äù she spat out, clearly annoyed.
She paused, the bitterness in her voice growing more evident. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a good thing you don‚Äôt let her show her face in public. You know as well as I do how much damage her identity could do to your reputation if seen together in public.
I ignored Laura completely, directing my attention to Isabelle, who was engaged in an interview with the press on the opposite side of the hall. Her eyes met mine, and she smiled warmly, which I returned with a genuine smile of my own.
‚ÄúA child of a p'imp will always remain one.‚Äù Laura emphasised in a low tone and my brow immediately furrowed in disbelief.
I spun around to face her, my patience snapping. ‚ÄúShut your fcking mouth if you have nothing reasonable to say,‚Äù I snapped. ‚ÄúYour husband fks every woman he can get his hands on. Shouldn‚Äôt you be more worried about that and the damage it would do to your reputation?‚Äù
That was it. I was done with her for the night. Without waiting for a response, I grabbed a glass of champagne from a passing waiter and made my way toward the other end of the hall, where Isabelle was still talking to the press.
As I neared her, I noticed a slight tension in her posture. She kept rubbing the pendant of the necklace I had bought her the last time we were together. She was nervous, perhaps unsure about something.
‚ÄúYou keep rubbing that pendant,‚Äù the interviewer remarked, noticing Isabelle‚Äôs repeated gesture. ‚ÄúIs there a special sentiment attached to it?‚Äù
For a brief moment, Isabelle‚Äôs eyes flicked to mine, but she quickly averted them, her smile never faltering. ‚ÄúYes, this necklace holds significant meaning to me. It was a gift from someone very important,‚Äù she said, her voice soft.
I couldn‚Äôt tear my eyes away from her, the glass in my hand now a mere distraction as I absently twirled the champagne inside.
The interviewer shifted the topic. ‚ÄúAre you planning on staying in New York after the launch of your new product, or will you be returning to Mexico?‚Äù
Isabelle‚Äôs smile widened, and I noticed the subtle change in her demeanor as she answered. ‚ÄúThe original plan was to go back to Mexico after the launch, but things have changed,‚Äù she said, her tone slightly more serious. ‚ÄúNow, I intend to stay here for a very, very long time.‚Äù
The interviewer raised an eyebrow, intrigued. ‚ÄúWhat changed?‚Äù she pressed.
Before Isabelle could respond, I heard my mother‚Äôs voice beside me. ‚ÄúThat had better be you,‚Äù she mused, her voice full of approval as she glanced between Isabelle and me. ‚ÄúIsabelle is the ideal daughter-in-law for this family.‚Äù
‚ÄúI know what‚Äôs best for myself and for this family,‚Äù I stated, finally bringing the glass of champagne to my lips but just as I was about to enjoy the drink, my phone vibrated in my pocket.
I pulled it out, my eyes briefly scanning the name flashing on the screen‚ÄîAmara, saved in my contacts as ‚ÄòA.‚Äô With no hesitance, I reached to swipe the answer button, but before my finger could make contact, my mother‚Äôs hand landed on mine with surprising force.
‚ÄúIs she the one calling?‚Äù she asked, her voice deceptively calm.
I shot her a sharp glare, irritated beyond measure. ‚ÄúStay out of my fking business, will you?‚Äù I hissed. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it better to have one woman in my life than to be fkn my way through New York?‚Äù
The silence settled between us for a moment before my mother‚Äôs voice softened, taking on an almost honeyed tone. ‚ÄúSenator?‚Äù she called out with the widest smile. ‚ÄúYour daughter has done a marvelous job with the new oil launch.‚Äù
I bit my tongue, forcing myself not to snap back. Isabelle‚Äôs father, Mr. Zealot Joe, was one of the most respected businessmen in the country, and despite my frustration with my mother‚Äôs intrusion, I knew better than to disrespect him.
‚ÄúCongratulations on a successful launch,‚Äù I said, extending my hand for a handshake. Mr. Zealot Joe accepted it firmly, a small but appreciative smile playing on his lips.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice to have you here, Alexander,‚Äù he said, his voice welcoming. As we exchanged pleasantries, our attention was drawn to his daughter, Isabelle, who had now taken the stage to speak to the gathered guests. She stood tall and poised, ready to say a few words. ‚ÄúShe told me you two are getting along well,‚Äù he added, nodding toward her.
I nodded back, my gaze briefly meeting Isabelle‚Äôs before returning to her father. ‚ÄúYes, we are. It was about time.‚Äù
Mr. Zealot Joe nodded in agreement, tapping my shoulder lightly with a gesture of approval. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm having a birthday dinner for my wife next week. Be sure to show your face.‚Äù
‚ÄúIsabelle already sent an invite, so I‚Äôll be there for sure,‚Äù I assured him, and he seemed satisfied with my response.
With a final nod, he excused himself, turning to walk away. I stood there for a moment, processing the conversation when my mother‚Äôs voice interrupted my thoughts.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you took my advice,‚Äù she chimed in from beside me, and I hadn‚Äôt even realized she was still standing there.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad Zealot is being friendly toward our family again,‚Äù she continued, her tone hinting at some sort of satisfaction, as if everything were falling into place the way she always expected it to.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you have friends to greet?‚Äù I asked through clenched teeth, barely hiding my irritation. I wasn‚Äôt in the mood for her company, especially not now.
She didn‚Äôt seem fazed by my tone. ‚ÄúAre you doing it anytime soon?‚Äù she shot back.
I glanced at her briefly from the corner of my eyes, wondering what she was talking about. ‚ÄúDoing what anytime soon?‚Äù
‚ÄúYou know exactly what I‚Äôm talking about,‚Äù she said, clearing her throat, the cryptic nature of her words only making me more frustrated. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt play dumb with me, son.‚Äù
‚ÄúHow about you don‚Äôt be so cryptic with me?‚Äù I snapped.
She sighed dramatically, a smirk tugging at her lips. ‚ÄúThe engagement,‚Äù she deadpanned, looking me square in the eyes. ‚ÄúAre you proposing anytime soon? We need that union to happen soon.‚Äù
I let out a long, controlled breath before responding. ‚ÄúYes, I will propose,‚Äù I said, stressing the words. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs up to me to decide when.‚Äù
She groaned in frustration. ‚ÄúXander, now is not the time to be stubborn. Having a union between the Jeos and our family is going to benefit both parties.‚Äù
I met her gaze, my expression flat. ‚ÄúI believe it will benefit them more than it benefits us,‚Äù I remarked.
‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt matter,‚Äù Mum argued, her tone persistent. ‚ÄúAt the end of the day, we‚Äôre still getting the benefits.‚Äù
Already feeling the headache creep in, I sighed and placed my half-empty glass on the tray of a passing server. ‚ÄúI believe I‚Äôm done here tonight,‚Äù I said, my voice curt as I turned away from her.
She frowned, clearly not pleased with my decision. ‚ÄúThe party just got started,‚Äù she remarked, trying to draw me back into the fray.
I didn‚Äôt even look at her as I replied, my patience completely worn thin. ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs over for me.‚Äù Without another word, I turned on my heels and walked towards the entrance.
The moment I stepped out of the building, I took in a very deep breath, feeling the headache calm already.
It wasn‚Äôt until I got in the car did I remember Amara called me earlier. Since I was already heading home, I decided not to return the call and meet her in person instead.
However, the ride home took longer than expected because of an accident which caused a road block.
AMARA
‚ÄúAre you sure there isn‚Äôt a relative or a friend you can call to pick you up?‚Äù the nurse asked me for what felt like the hundredth time, her brows furrowing with concern.
I glanced down at my phone, the screen still displaying my unanswered calls to Xander. A tired sigh escaped my lips as I shook my head. ‚ÄúNo, there‚Äôs no one. But I‚Äôm fine, really.‚Äù I have been in worst state in the past and I survived.
The truth was, I had almost been hit by a drunk driver while walking down my street to get some ice cream. It had all happened so fast‚Äîa screech of tires, the blinding headlights, my body frozen for a split second before I stumbled backward just in time. But in the end, nothing truly terrible had happened. No broken bones, no serious injuries‚Äîjust a shaken-up version of myself sitting in the emergency room, convincing a nurse that I could manage on my own.
She didn‚Äôt seem convinced. I could see it in the way her brows pinched together, the slight hesitation in her posture. She probably thought I was too rattled to be left alone, that I might unknowingly walk into another moving vehicle.
‚ÄúThank you for everything,‚Äù I said, pushing myself up from the chair and reaching for my jacket. My fingers trembled slightly, but I ignored it. ‚ÄúYou made all of this a little easier to deal with.‚Äù
The nurse offered me a kind smile, the kind that held warmth but also a hint of worry. ‚ÄúI was just doing my job,‚Äù she said softly.
I nodded and turned toward the exit, my steps slow as I made my way out of the hospital. 
Should I go to Xander‚Äôs place or just head back to my apartment?
After much contemplation, I realized I didn‚Äôt want to be alone tonight. The silence of my apartment would only magnify the unease in my chest, and I so much need a company right now, so I hailed a cab and headed to Xander‚Äôs house instead.
***************
When I arrived, the house was quiet‚Äîtoo quiet. Xander wasn‚Äôt home.
With a sigh, I made my way to the kitchen, brewed myself –∞ cup of warm tea, letting the steam rise to my face in an attempt to calm my nerves. But the unanswered calls still bothered me.
I hate that subconscious self that keeps telling me that he is with Isabelle.
After taking a few sips, I decided to find out where he was. Stepping outside, I approached one of the security guards stationed near the entrance.
‚ÄúYou know where your boss is?‚Äù I asked, hoping he won‚Äôt blow me of off with responses like‚Ä¶he isn‚Äôt supposed to report his boss‚Äôs whereabouts to me.
The man gave me a curt bow before responding. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs at the launch event for Wember Oils.‚Äù
Wember Oils.
The name alone made my stomach twist. The company belonged to Zealot Leo‚ÄîIsabelle‚Äôs father. And where he was, she was bound to be as well.
That is a fact, judging from the Isabelle I met a few weeks ago.
So that was why Xander wasn‚Äôt answering my calls. He was with Isabelle.
I swallowed down the bitter feeling creeping up my throat and forced a tight smile. ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù
Turning away, I walked back inside, setting my half-empty tea on the coffee table before sinking into the plush sofa. A long breath escaped me as I pulled out my phone, scrolling through the internet in an attempt to distract myself.
But no matter how hard I tried, my mind kept circling back to one thought‚Äîhe ignored me for her.
As if the universe itself wanted to mock me, my media feed was flooded with videos of Isabelle.
I hesitated for a moment before clicking on one. The screen came to life, showing her standing under the bright event lights, poised and elegant as always. A journalist held a microphone to her lips, and with a dazzling smile, she announced, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here to stay for good.‚Äù
My stomach tightened.
But what really caught my attention wasn‚Äôt her words‚Äîit was the way her fingers kept grazing the pendant of her necklace. A necklace I knew all too well.
I didn‚Äôt need anyone to tell me it was the one Xander had given her. The confirmation came when she glanced at the camera, her smile turning almost coy as she murmured, ‚ÄúIt was a gift from someone very important to me.‚Äù
A scoff slipped past my lips before I even realized it.
Exhaling sharply, I turned off my phone, flipping it face down on the sofa as if that could block out the thoughts racing in my head. 
A quick glance at the clock told me that I‚Äôd be spending the night alone‚Äîsomething I had wanted to avoid in the first place.
*************
The soft creak of the bedroom door stirred me from sleep. The quiet shuffle of footsteps followed, moving closer until a familiar scent wrapped around me.
Then, a cold pair of lips brushed against my temple.
I kept my breathing steady, feigning sleep. Not because I was tired, but because I couldn‚Äôt bear to let him see how much his behavior with Isabelle was affecting me.
Because if he saw‚Äîif he knew‚ÄîI wasn‚Äôt sure I‚Äôd be able to handle his response.
‚ÄúMum?‚Äù
His voice, sharp with irritation, pulled me from my thoughts. Peeking one eye open, I saw him standing by the window, his phone pressed tightly against his ear.
‚ÄúI already told you‚ÄîI‚Äôll be proposing to her soon.‚Äù
Proposing?
My breath caught in my throat.
‚ÄúI know you like Isabelle, Mum, but you‚Äôre seriously getting on my nerves with these constant reminders,‚Äù he snapped before abruptly ending the call. With a frustrated sigh, he tossed his phone onto the sofa.
I barely had time to shut my eyes before he turned around.
I listened as he walked into the closet, rustling through his belongings. A few minutes later, he emerged, heading straight into the bathroom. Moments later, the sound of running water filled the silence.
I remained still, my mind racing.
He‚Äôs proposing to Isabelle?
A dull ache settled in my chest, but I pushed past it as I slowly sat up. My gaze flickered toward the closet.
I had never been the type to snoop. Never felt the need to dig for answers that weren‚Äôt freely given.
But after what I‚Äôd just heard, I needed to know‚Äîwas I wasting my time? Was I holding onto something that was never mine to begin with?
With careful steps, I walked into the closet, reaching for his jacket. My fingers trembled slightly as I searched through the pockets, bracing myself for whatever truth I was about to uncover.
I pulled his wallet from the closet, my heart pounding as I rushed to the door, checking quickly to make sure he wasn‚Äôt coming back yet. I opened the wallet with trembling hands, scanning through it until my fingers brushed against a crumpled receipt tucked away at the back.
Curiosity gnawed at me, and with a deep breath, I unfolded it.
The words on the paper made my breath catch in my throat. A receipt for a ring.
A sob lodged in my chest, and I quickly pressed my hand to my mouth to stifle the cry threatening to escape.
He was planning an engagement with Isabelle. After all the times he told me that he would never get married, after all the promises he made to me‚Ä¶ He was out there making plans with her. And here I was, sitting on his bed like an idiot, waiting for him to return.
Like some‚Ä¶ some bimbo.
My vision blurred, but I wiped my tears away quickly, forcing myself to focus. I slid the receipt back into his wallet, but in my haste, the wallet slipped from my hand.
It hit the floor with a soft thud.
I sniffed, my heart still heavy in my chest as I bent to pick it up. That‚Äôs when I saw it‚Äîa picture, partially hidden beneath the wallet.
Curious, I reached for it, my fingers shaking as I turned it over.
My fingers trembled as I picked up the photograph, flipping it over. My eyes scanned the image, and my heart sank as I froze in place.
It was an ultrasound image.
A freaking ultrasound image!
And right above it, in bold letters, were the words Isabelle Leo.
She was carrying his child.
How could he hide something like this from me? Was he ever going to tell me about it? 
This was the reason they were getting married. It wasn‚Äôt just about love‚Äîit was about a future they were building together.
They were already building a family together. Without needing to be told, I knew. It was over for me.
The sound of the shower turned off, snapping me back to the present.
Panicking, I quickly placed the photograph back where I had found it, stuffing it into the wallet before hurriedly placing it back into the jacket. My heart was pounding in my ears as I rushed back to the bed, lying down and closing my eyes. I forced myself to keep my breathing steady, pretending to be asleep just as Xander entered the room.
He climbed into bed beside me, his body warm as he pulled me close against his chest.
And for the first time since I met him, his arms didn‚Äôt feel safe anymore.

The sound it makes when grinding beans is very ethereal, or hollow, quite unique, and highly recognizable.

However, it always feels like squeezing facial cleanser that gets stuck halfway through. You have to turn it upside down or tap it a bit. It constantly stutters while grinding; the number of stutters per grind seems to depend on the beans, but almost all beans cause some hesitation. Towards the end, there are always half a bean or a few half-beans rattling around in the bean hopper, requiring me to shake and change positions to finally get all the powder out.

Once the grinding is finally done, when pouring the grounds, I don't know what's wrong with that glass powder jar, but there's always coffee powder clinging to the threads and edges. It invariably reminds me of how the nozzle of a facial cleanser tube always gets a small ring of residue after squeezing.

I even started to wonder if my C40 was a fake, though I'm sure the seller would pull out their authorization papers and sue me if I actually said that.

# ZP6

Its reputation isn't nearly as widespread as the C40's, but it's truly reliable at getting the job done. It feels very solid to crank, not overly strenuous, but a bit heavier and faster than the C40. It rarely stutters; this is also bean-dependent, but only a very few beans will cause occasional stutters.

Pouring the powder is also very clean, with no sticking to the outer wall.

Additionally, ZP6's external adjustment dial is much more convenient, and its body is slimmer than the C40's, making it easier to grip for people with smaller hands.

\-------

However, all the beans I use are medium-light roasts.

As for the coffee brewed from the grounds of both, I've compared them carefully several times. My ZP6 at 51 clicks is roughly equivalent to C40 at 18 clicks. I used a V60 Switch for brewing to minimize significant interference from inconsistent technique. The flavor is indeed very different from C40. ZP6's flavor is concentrated; the ""Bear Estate Geisha Washed"" tasted full of sweetness with a clear tea-like aftertaste, reminding me of a cylinder. C40, on the other hand, was like a flat disc, broader but more subdued. If I had to choose which one I prefer, for this specific bean I compared, I would choose the concentrated flavor of the ZP6.

However, if I wasn't brewing simultaneously and comparing side-by-side, I might struggle to define what a bean ""should"" taste like, or whether C40 or ZP6 performed better; I could only say they were different.",0,1752115647.0,1zpresso,0,0.5,False

After that I stepped back out of respect for her and to protect myself. But after a few weeks we somehow slipped back into that same dynamic again. The chats started the hangouts returned and I found myself back where I didn‚Äôt want to be.

The Quiet Test

**Leo**

I don‚Äôt like being seen.

Not in the fake, dramatic, teen-movie kind of way. I mean it literally. I‚Äôve gone whole school years without teachers remembering my name. Sometimes they mark me absent when I‚Äôm sitting right there. I‚Äôve waved. Spoken. Nothing.

People forget me.

I used to think it was just how I looked ‚Äî boring, pale, forgettable. Or maybe how I sounded ‚Äî soft, like I didn‚Äôt believe in my own voice.

But now‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not so sure.

Because this morning?

People looked.

Tasha glanced at me like I was solid. Gabe bumped into me and actually apologized. Even Danny, who usually stares at the floor like it holds all life‚Äôs answers, met my eyes for half a second.

It shook me.

Like falling upward.

I don‚Äôt like being seen.

‚∏ª

My uncle didn‚Äôt even see me.

Not really.

He shouted something about eggs as I slipped out the door. He wasn‚Äôt making them ‚Äî just shouting the word. Again. For the fourth time this week. The man drinks vinegar like it‚Äôs wine and calls the microwave ‚ÄúThe Orb.‚Äù

He‚Äôs all I have.

No parents. No siblings. Just a great-uncle who probably thinks I‚Äôm a hallucination from a dream he had in 1974.

And maybe I am.

Maybe that‚Äôs why I feel‚Ä¶ blurry.

Like the world draws itself clearly for everyone else, but smudges around me.

Or maybe I just need sleep.

‚∏ª

When I got to school, everything felt louder.

Brighter.

Wrong.

I stepped into the classroom, expecting the usual ‚Äî no greetings, no glances, just my seat in the back and a sea of people looking through me.

But something was different.

The second I walked in, the air shifted.

Gabe dropped a coin mid-flip.

Tasha blinked and sparked.

Danny rubbed his nose again, like he felt a storm coming.

Even the teacher‚Ä¶ paused. Just slightly.

Like someone unplugged a thought mid-sentence.

I kept walking.

Sat in the back.

No one looked.

No one said anything.

But they felt me.

And I felt them feel me.

And that was worse than being invisible.

That was dangerous.

‚∏ª
**The Teacher** 

She showed up ten minutes early.

Of course she did.

Director Reyna always arrives early ‚Äî not because she‚Äôs efficient, but because she likes people to know she‚Äôs efficient.

‚ÄúZenos,‚Äù she said, her voice syrupy and sharp, like a compliment dipped in lemon juice. ‚ÄúYou look‚Ä¶ conscious. Excellent.‚Äù

‚ÄúReyna,‚Äù I replied, resisting the urge to fake a seizure.

She fluttered in like a pastel moth, clipboard in hand, hair sprayed to hell, smile tighter than my last paycheck. ‚ÄúThe Council will be joining us shortly. I trust your little group is‚Ä¶ presentable?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre students. Not puppies.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, no.‚Äù

I sighed‚Ä¶

She leaned closer, lowering her voice. ‚ÄúZenos, this is important. You‚Äôve been making waves. Some positive. Some‚Ä¶ less so. Today is your chance to prove this Class F experiment wasn‚Äôt just a glorified detention hall.‚Äù

I took a long, painful sip of my coffee.

She smiled wider. ‚ÄúThey just need to be competent. Not impressive. Barely functional will suffice.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs our specialty.‚Äù

‚∏ª

The Council arrived in silence.

Three of them. Always three.

James. Joseph. Russell.

You don‚Äôt forget those names once you hear them. You don‚Äôt forget them once you see them.

They‚Äôre not just top-ranked heroes. They run the damn Academy. The kind of presence that makes security guards stand straighter and weather change direction.

James wore black. Always. Silent. Cold. More stone than man.
Joseph had the look of a surgeon who knew everyone in the room was already dying.
Russell smiled like he was trying it out for the first time and wasn‚Äôt sure if it fit.

They said nothing.

Just nodded once.

And that was enough to make my hands sweat.

‚∏ª

I ushered the kids into the simulation room.

Some shuffled. Some bounced. Some looked like they were walking into a dentist‚Äôs office with a fire alarm going off.

Most of them had powers only their mothers could love.

Bea had ‚Äúsugar clairvoyance.‚Äù She claims she can taste danger in gummies.
Trent builds static when anxious, which means he‚Äôs a lightning rod 24/7.
Mina can make plants grow by sneezing. Not helpful.
Clint can unbuckle seatbelts with his mind. That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs the power.

This is what I work with.

Except for a few ‚Äî the ones I‚Äôm starting to believe in:

Tasha, Gabe, Danny, Livia‚Ä¶ and Leo.

Especially Leo‚Ä¶

Because nothing about that boy makes sense.
And today, I‚Äôm going to find out why.

‚∏ª

**Zenos The Teacher**

The room lit up in blue.

Turrets hissed open with lazy timing. Platforms shifted. Drones hovered at safe-but-annoying altitude.

I‚Äôd kept it simple: a five-minute challenge meant to test reflexes, teamwork, and maybe ‚Äî just maybe ‚Äî not get anyone concussed in front of the Council.

Reasonable, right?

Not even fifteen seconds in‚Ä¶

Gabe flinched too early. Fired a shockwave straight into the nearest wall. Tasha yelped, sparks flicking out from her palms like angry fireflies. Clint tripped on the floor tile he swore had ‚Äúmoved,‚Äù which it hadn‚Äôt.

Trent tried to generate static, forgot to ground himself, and promptly zapped his own ankle. Again‚Ä¶

Danny managed to dodge a drone, but then overcorrected and headbutted a padded wall. Which shouldn‚Äôt have bled. But did.

And Leo?

Leo just walked‚Ä¶

That‚Äôs all.

Just a few steps across the field.

And suddenly, the whole room felt wrong.

I blinked and forgot which turret I‚Äôd programmed to fire next.

Joseph narrowed his eyes, already scribbling something down.

Russell smiled wider.

James‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt move. But somehow, his lack of motion felt louder than all of it.

Then came the second wave of dysfunction.

Bea screamed because she ‚Äúhad a vision of cereal raining from the ceiling‚Äù and panicked. Nico flickered in and out like a corrupted gif. Mina sneezed ‚Äî and a weed sprouted from the wall panel beside her.

I muttered through gritted teeth: ‚ÄúSo much for controlled variables.‚Äù

Livia, bless her, was sketching mid-motion like it would help the others navigate. Tasha backed into her on accident, knocking the sketchpad flying. Danny reached to grab it midair ‚Äî and for one second, his blood followed.

Like a red thread arcing across the chaos.

James leaned forward.

I didn‚Äôt breathe.

Then Leo blinked‚Ä¶

Just blinked.

And the lights dimmed for half a second. Everyone froze like someone hit pause on reality.

Even the Council looked‚Ä¶ unsettled.

Just for a blink.

And then it was gone.

‚∏ª

**Zenos The Teacher**

I hit the shutdown button before someone accidentally invented nuclear sneeze propulsion.

The lights flickered back to steady. The turrets retracted. The walls stopped shifting. A low, merciful hum of deactivation filled the room.

And silence followed.

Not relief.

Not triumph.

Just‚Ä¶ silence‚Ä¶

The kind you hear at funerals. Or just before a suspension letter hits your inbox.

I looked at the Council.

James didn‚Äôt blink.
Joseph kept writing.
Russell clapped. Once.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got spirit,‚Äù he said.

I wanted to punch him and throw up at the same time.

Behind me, the kids started relaxing. Laughter bubbled. They thought it was over. That they‚Äôd passed. That it went okay.

They had no idea.

No idea that Gabe nearly tore a wall down.
That Danny almost weaponized his blood mid-panic.
That Leo glitched a room just by being there.

I turned toward them.

‚ÄúAlright. Not bad. Better than yesterday. Go hydrate. Don‚Äôt touch anything. Especially yourself.‚Äù

They laughed.

They laughed.

Gods help me.

The Council didn‚Äôt say a word as they left.

James passed by me like I was air.
Joseph nodded ‚Äî surgical.
Russell leaned in. Voice low.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got something here, Zenos. Something ugly. Something raw. Don‚Äôt polish it too soon.‚Äù

Then he was gone.

The room dropped ten degrees.

Behind me, the kids were arguing about who nearly died most impressively.
Leo sat in the corner.
Staring at the wall.

And I?

I rubbed my eyes and said nothing‚Ä¶

Because I wasn‚Äôt ready to ask the real question yet:
What the hell is happening to my class?

1lw1s6n,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lw1s6n/my_bosss_husband_is_a_cop_who_arrested_my_mum_dad/,My boss‚Äôs husband is a cop‚Ä¶ who arrested my mum & dad.,"So, low-key trauma dump but I need to get this off my chest.

I work in a corporate setting and I have massive imposter syndrome I always feel out of place, especially considering i have GAD/CPTSD and depression.

My upbringing was‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs just say, not ideal. My parents were delinquents. They were constantly was a lot of trouble with the police, particularly cause they were into drugs. 

Anyway, here‚Äôs the funny (and slightly horrifying) part.

My manager? She‚Äôs amazing. Genuinely the best manager I‚Äôve ever had ‚Äî kind, supportive, just a total gem. We bonded on our first day over the fact that we both live in the same town. We went out for coffee on my first day at this job which and got to know eachother. Then she casually mentioned that her husband is a local cop.

And I just froze.Because my first thought was
‚ÄúOh my god. He has definitely been to my house before.‚Äù

Fast-forward a few days, after I had told my mum about the situation and prying for information, describing him to my mum she was able to confirm she has ‚Äúinteracted‚Äù with him. Aka he‚Äôs been around during one of the many times the police were called out for their nuisance. 

So now I‚Äôm working under a manager whose husband literally arrested my family.

I mean‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs funny, and it‚Äôs tragic. Like a full-circle trauma sitcom

I don‚Äôt live that in that environment anymore, I‚Äôve worked really hard to move away from all of it, to not be like my parents and to realise that some of my childhood experiences were not normal. But omg this does hang over my head lol. I haven‚Äôt told my boss, and every now and then I think ‚ÄúGod, I hope my they haven‚Äôt brought my family name up at  the dinner table lol ‚Äú  cause I can only imagine that conversation.
It‚Äôs definitely likely lol considering her son & my brother also know eachother too and she‚Äôs told me how they have talked about that. 
But tbh she is a gem and I don‚Äôt think she would hold my upbringing , especially considering I am not  my parents actions, so they wouldn‚Äôt reflect on me. I try to remind myself lol. 
But anyways. That‚Äôs been sitting on my chest. Her husband‚Äôs definitely arrested my parents.

Have been sleeping with a girl for the past week.

After I pulled out, sperm was leaking out of her. We were surprised, but I didn‚Äôt think she could get pregnant because the condom was still on and there was no force to push the sperm inside (she was on her back).

Yesterday she told me she‚Äôs had increased urination for 2 days, almost every hour or so.

The year was 1983. The congregation had 38 publishers, a patch of donated land, and not a cent to spare. But they had something stronger than money: conviction.

Brother Ernest gave the land, an old farmer with cracked hands and a soft heart. He couldn‚Äôt quote many scriptures, but he always said, ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs for Jehovah, you give him your best.‚Äù When he handed over the deed, he cried. Not out of loss, but out of joy.

Every weekend, Wally and the brothers worked from sunup to sundown. Young guys slept on the floor to guard the tools. Sisters brought food in foil pans, balancing rice and beans in their arms like sacred offerings. Kids ran around, dodging wheelbarrows and pretending to be on construction crews. They laughed. They prayed. They believed they were building something holy.

When a storm ripped half the roof off one night, Wally stood in the mud, soaked to the bone, trying to save what he could. He sobbed quietly. Then he got back to work.

They finished in 11 months.

The hall wasn‚Äôt much to look at; cinderblock walls, modest chairs, a small bathroom that always smelled faintly of bleach; but it was theirs. It was sacred. They called it Jehovah‚Äôs house.

Wally proposed to Janet in the parking lot. He baptized both his sons in that tiny blue pool. He gave talks with sweaty palms, painted the walls every spring, and helped fix every broken mic wire. His life happened in that building.

Until one day, decades later, a letter came.

No explanation. No thanks.

‚ÄúThe Kingdom Hall will be sold. Your congregation will merge with another. Additional details to come""

No meeting. No elders‚Äô visit. Just a cold letter from Brooklyn.

Wally was 62. He sat in the same back row where he‚Äôd cried the day his mother died. No one spoke. No one knew what to say.

They sold it for $350,000.

Today, it‚Äôs an acupuncture clinic. The sign says ‚ÄúBalance & Energy Wellness Center.‚Äù

No acknowledgment of the sweat, the prayers, the history.

Just gone. That was his last day on that Hall.

Wally didn‚Äôt say much after that, but he was never the same. Just once, over coffee, to his son, he whispered:

**‚ÄúI once built a house for God. Now I don‚Äôt know who lives there.‚Äù**",24,1752114463.0,exjw,6,0.96,False

this bed feels so empty without you‚Äî
not just the cotton stretch of linen gone cold,
but the hollow in the silence
where your breath used to fold into mine
like waves cradling the moon.
the mattress remembers you,
how you turned the night
into something more than darkness‚Äî
into warmth, into home,
into a hush that meant everything‚Äôs okay.

without you,
mornings feel like false dawns‚Äî
the sun rises,
but nothing truly wakes.
coffee grows bitter without your laugh
to stir sugar into it.
i sip alone and watch steam rise
like your ghost
dancing in kitchen light.

the world spins just the same
but without gravity.
your absence is a sky with no stars‚Äî
technically infinite,
but aching for something to guide me.

i walk streets that once knew our shadows
and they seem foreign now,
as if even the sidewalks refuse
to remember me without you.
the bench in the park
where you once leaned your head
on my shoulder
now holds only wind and
my aching spine of memory.

even music stumbles in your absence.
songs we once shared
now sound like strangers
knocking on the door
of a house that‚Äôs been emptied.
my heart listens for your harmony
and hears only
the echo of you not being there.

your touch was punctuation‚Äî
a hand on mine like a period,
settling all my chaos
and your voice, the comma,
making space for breath
in all my tangled thoughts
but without you,
my sentences run on
and on
into longing.

when you‚Äôre here‚Äî
time remembers its rhythm.
even the stars lean closer,
jealous of the way
you light my skin with your gaze.
i am not a half or a fraction or a question.
i am whole.
i am the answer.
i am the earth
with its moon returned.

but when you go‚Äî
i unravel.
i count the hours
like scars.
i write your name in steam
on bathroom mirrors,
just to see it fade
again
and again.

this bed feels so empty without you‚Äî
not because it lacks a body,
but because it lacks you,
the soul of my every moment.
i am a house without its fire.
a sky missing its blue.
i am longing,
and you are the only thing
i have ever truly
hoped to hold.

It‚Äôd be somewhere relatively close to Denver, and I can always arrange transport if not drive us myself, if that‚Äôs a limitation!

If you have all of your own stuff that‚Äôs great, otherwise I have basically a whole setup for an extra person minus a backpack, if we don‚Äôt mind sharing a tent.

But the last thing I‚Äôd want is to have either of us stuck on a 1-2 day wilderness trip without knowing each other lol so I think if anyone is interested sharing some info about your background helps as well as a meetup or two for coffee or something might be helpful!

For me, I work in tech, I like to run, hike, play w/ my dogs (who would be staying @ home), travel, like to learn and naturally curious, I don‚Äôt drink much but don‚Äôt mind it, and mostly a go with the flow/laid-back kind of guy.

Whether you're looking to date, make friends, or just avoid feeling stuck in your own head, moving to a new city gives you a rare and powerful reset. Here‚Äôs how to make the most of it‚Äîwithout falling into the isolation trap that snags so many people in their 20s and 30s.


---

üß≠ Step 1: Your First 30 Days ‚Äì Build the Foundation

üîπ Explore Intentionally (Week 1)

Walk or bike through 2‚Äì3 neighborhoods known for their energy ‚Äî think cafes, bookstores, parks, gyms, or music venues.

Say yes to events even if they feel ‚Äúmeh‚Äù at first. You‚Äôre laying the groundwork.

Ask people about the city: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your favorite underrated spot?‚Äù It‚Äôs disarming and instantly social.


üîπ Join Activities With Built-in Social Energy

Pick 2‚Äì3 recurring activities that naturally mix people:

Group workouts (e.g., yoga, boxing, climbing)

Co-ed sports leagues or creative classes

Hobby clubs, volunteering, language exchanges


The point isn‚Äôt to meet ‚ÄúThe One‚Äù ‚Äî it‚Äôs to build momentum, familiarity, and community.



---

üß† Step 2: Mindset ‚Äì Avoid Isolation, Build Energy

üö´ The Isolation Trap:

Moving to a new place without a plan leads a lot of people straight into passive loneliness:

You default to Netflix, doomscrolling, Reddit, DoorDash, and calling the same 2 people from your old life.

You rationalize: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired tonight‚Äù or ‚ÄúNext weekend I‚Äôll go out.‚Äù Weeks pass.


Flip that script.
Isolation kills social momentum. The longer you go without real interaction, the more awkward it feels to restart.

‚úÖ Replace Passive Habits With Social Habits:

Passive Habit	Social Alternative

Netflix binge	Go to a local film night or indie theater
Scrolling Instagram	Join a photography or storytelling class
Gaming alone	Try a casual game night or bar trivia
Eating alone nightly	Sit at the bar, not a table ‚Äì talk to people
Calling old friends	Invite coworkers or acquaintances out


Even one small interaction per day (chatting with a barista, complimenting someone‚Äôs book) builds emotional momentum.


---

üí¨ Step 3: Social & Dating Strategy

üì± Dating Apps (Support Role, Not the Core)

Set up your profile with warmth and local curiosity:
‚ÄúNew to the city ‚Äî looking for people who love food and weird art galleries.‚Äù

Use apps for 1‚Äì2 casual dates per week if you‚Äôd like, but don't let them be your only strategy.


üßç In-Person (Primary Energy Builder)

Attend events alone ‚Äî it makes you more open and magnetic.

Ask light, open-ended questions: ‚ÄúIs this your first time at one of these?‚Äù or ‚ÄúHow did you find out about this place?‚Äù

Don‚Äôt overthink it ‚Äî everyone‚Äôs more open to connection than it seems.



---

üõ†Ô∏è Step 4: Level Up Where You Are

Move your body: Join a gym or class that builds consistency and confidence.

Upgrade your wardrobe: Dress intentionally ‚Äî not fancy, just expressive and fitted.

Refine your vibe: Be someone who listens, smiles, and makes others feel seen. People remember how you make them feel.



---

‚è±Ô∏è Step 5: 60-Day Action Plan

Week	Focus

1‚Äì2	Walk the city, join 2 recurring activities, set up your social toolkit
3‚Äì4	Commit to 3 new social interactions/week, attend 1 event solo
5‚Äì6	Revisit favorite spots, deepen 1‚Äì2 new friendships
7‚Äì8	Host something casual: a coffee walk, park hangout, or cooking night


You don't need 30 new friends. You just need a few meaningful connections and a couple familiar faces to start feeling at home.


---

‚ö†Ô∏è Final Notes: Guard Against Drift

Isolation doesn‚Äôt hit suddenly ‚Äî it creeps in when you skip one event, then another.

Create a simple social routine: 2 scheduled events + 1 unstructured ‚Äújust explore‚Äù window per week.

The key isn‚Äôt charisma ‚Äî it‚Äôs presence and consistency.



---

üí¨ One-Liner to Remember

 Momentum > motivation. You don‚Äôt need to feel ready ‚Äî you just need to show up.

I have an interview coming up for a part time at a cute coffee shop. I‚Äôve done interviews before in academic settings, but I have little to none in food service.

Here are some of my options
1. Cute t shirt?

2. Long sleeve

- no clue how to describe and I have no pics (sorryüò≠) but i think it looks professional, but my main reservation against it is its baggy. It looks like ‚Ä¶ bunch around my stomach? I don‚Äôt feel like that‚Äôs a good look

My son is 10 months and is still contact napping and bedsharing. I can‚Äôt remember the last time I had a good night‚Äôs rest, and I‚Äôm really trying to get him to be able to sleep on his own. He falls asleep quickly and easily, but he doesn‚Äôt tolerate being put in his crib. 

We were admittedly terrible about a consistent bedtime routine until about three weeks ago (neither of us wanted to be stuck in bed with him after 7pm, so we were all going to sleep around 10pm, and my son would wake up between 9-10am). I started reading Precious Little Sleep after a two failed Ferber attempts (he was screaming at the top of his lungs and gasping for air and I couldn‚Äôt handle it), and we now have a consistent bedtime routine: boob, bath, books, bed. We sleep with our Hatch on at bedtime and for naps and use a sleep sack as an additional sleep association. He also uses a pacifier. He dropped his third nap a couple of weeks ago and usually takes a 1.5-2 hour nap in the morning and a 2 hour nap in the afternoon.

At this age, what gentle sleep training methods should I explore? I have a really hard time with his level of crying in his crib, and in the few days after each failed Ferber attempt, he would start screaming if we even walked by the crib while holding him. I just don‚Äôt know how to get him to sleep on his own, I‚Äôve been running on coffee for the past 10 months, and I just want to be able to sleep through the night in a comfortable position ‚Äî even if it‚Äôs just a couple of nights a week.

You need: 

1. Get the Ninja Creme if it is your budget for the best consistency. Cheapest at Costco. 

2. Use a bullet or a blender with very little liquid (water/coconut water/ whipping cream/ half and half/plant based milk) so the ingredients blend thick. 

3. Freeze in popsicle moulds and serve.

NOTE: All ingredients should be combined and frozen ahead of time. Also, need to meet your fat intake quota, add mct oil when blending to serve. 

Tastey keto flavours:

- Coffee, whipping cream, monkfruit sugar. 

Option: grated high quality dark chocolate for popsicle molds or stirred in just before serving.

- avocado, monkfruit sugar (Many parts of the world eat avo sweetened in shakes and desserts. This combo with a little ice, cream/almond milk, and a mct oil makes a killer milkshake in a regular blender.)

- make an easy stovetop recipe for egg custard. (Cream/eggs/monkfruit sugar, vanilla).
Eg. [https://thebigmansworld.com/keto-custard/](https://thebigmansworld.com/keto-custard/)

Option: add grated high quality dark chocolate  or minced berries to the mixture above  for  popsicle moulds or stir in just before serving for milkshake or soft serve.

- frozen berries ( or any keto friendly fruit) , a TBSP of lemon, monkfruit sugar and a dash of salt = sorbet

Options: a. add cottage cheese or cream cheese with the berries for a cheesecake flavour or added protien. b.  mix berries 50/50 with whipped cream or yogurt or kefir or canned coconut milk
c. alternated layers of the berry and cream base mixtures in popsicle moulds or blend separately once frozen and serve in layers. 

- frozen cucumber or celery, lemon or lime juice, mint, coconut water, monk fruit sugar 

- mix whipped cream or canned coconut milk or cream cheese (or any combo of) and a package of sugar free jello = ambrosia flavour 

Option:   add finely chopped berries after mixing the above ingredients for popsicle molds or stir in just before for milkshakes or soft serve.

- blend whipped cream, peanut butter powder, and monkfruit sugar then  freeze. Then make the berry sorbet above.  Freeze layered in moulds or blend separately once frozen and  serve layered for pbj.

- canned coconut milk flavour with chai spice or cinnamon or cardamon or pie spices, monk fruit sugar, pinch of salt.

- make a strong batch of chai. Mix with  whipping cream or canned coconut milk or plant based milk and monk fruit sugar. ( I am a fan of combining whipping cream and unsweetened vanilla almond milk.)


Bonus option if you are feeling really ambitious: ""Ice cream cake/bars"":

Mix powder chopped almonds or almont flour with ghee/butter/mct oil alone are a mix of, monkfruit sugar and a punch or salt. Press into the base of a bake and freezer friendly tin/ or pyrex. Bake  your ""shortbreadcrust/ cheese base"" for 10 mins in a preheated oven (325 ish). When done and cooled pour any of the above mixtures onto it no deeper than about 3 inches/ 6 cms ('ish).Put in freezer till 80% frozen and serve or take out 30 mins before serving for it to soften a little. Top with fresh fruit, dark chocolate grates flakes,  a spice dust, or toasted almonds or toasted unsweetened coconut flakes.

The lab used to be clean. Absolutely never dusty. Every day, there would be someone to sit down in the two chairs that sat in their respectful places. The chair with the big T on it stood still, and stood tall. But the rolling chair was smaller, practically crouching, and rolling around the floor, as a busy man drove it with his legs. 

But now the chairs still wait to be sat in. Cobwebs form on the chair with the T. The wheels of the rolling chair collect dust. 

The chalk on the board is fading, the board waiting to be written on again. The chalk has been replaced with bright, colorful graffiti. 

The copper ceiling now has holes in it, giant chunks stolen from their respected places. 

The desks once organized now dragged halfway across the room. 

The wasp‚Äôs nest forming in the corner of the room. The wasps must have made it in through the broken windows that haven‚Äôt been fixed in ages. 

And the silence of the room is uncanny, compared to the chuckling and the conversations that once went on in it. 

The leftover cocoon that made the herald is brown and rotted. 

Dust bunnies eat the room alive. Dust, dirt, and dead air are all present. The only sounds that are made in the room are from intruders, breaking in. 

The coffee in the coffee pot had dried out into stains, waiting to be washed and filled with more coffee. Mold starting to form. 

The room was filled with leftover research and machinery, but somehow it was so empty at the same time. 

It‚Äôs almost as if the room feels something. A loneliness. 

The lab waits for her favorite two scientists to come back. To come back and clean the place up, to write on the chalkboard, to make coffee and to talk about things. 

The lab doesn‚Äôt know it, but it‚Äôs already been years. The last conversation she heard was the two scientists having an argument. 

The lab can‚Äôt read English, so she‚Äôll never be able to read the stylized handwriting spray painted on the floor in the middle of the room.

Hell was not what most people expected. 

It wasn't a lake of fire or a pit of screaming souls. It was, more accurately, a vast bureaucracy with excellent central heating and remarkably poor ventilation. The corridors stretched endlessly, lined with filing cabinets that contained the accumulated sins of humanity, cross referenced by date, magnitude, and creative originality. The lighting was fluorescent and flickered just enough to give everyone a permanent headache.

Monsieur Virel sat behind an obsidian desk in what might charitably be called an office, though it more closely resembled a theatrical dressing room that had been crossed with a library and then struck by lightning. Mirrors lined one wall, each reflecting a different version of himself, sometimes younger, sometimes older, occasionally sporting different colored eyes or historical costumes. Books floated near the ceiling like sedated birds, their pages occasionally fluttering open to reveal passages that rewrote themselves as he watched.

He was reading a report when Selapin padded in, his silver collar gleaming in the strange light.

""The M√ºller file is complete,"" the dog announced, settling beside the desk with his characteristic dignity. ""Forty three years of nightmares, recurring dreams of dancing with dead children, and a final deathbed confession that lasted six hours. He died weeping.""

""Satisfactory,"" Virel murmured, not looking up from his papers. ""And the others?""

""The colonel became a pacifist and spent his remaining years working with refugee children. The general drank himself to death by 1947. The lieutenant joined a monastery and took a vow of silence that he never broke.""

Virel smiled faintly. ""Humans are wonderfully unpredictable. Even I'm sometimes surprised by their capacity for redemption.""

He set down the report and leaned back in his chair, which adjusted itself to accommodate his posture with the fluid grace of liquid mercury.

""Speaking of surprises,"" he continued, ""I've been monitoring something interesting in Paris. The city has... changed since our last visit.""

Selapin tilted his head. ""Changed how?""

""The 1980s, my dear friend, are a fascinating decade. The city pulses with new energy‚Äîart, cinema, music, rebellion. But also with new forms of despair. The soul of Paris is being photographed, filmed, packaged, and sold. The question is: what happens to a city's spirit when it becomes a commodity?""

Virel stood and walked to the window, which offered a view not of the traditional flames and brimstone, but of a sprawling cityscape that might have been any major metropolis, if major metropolises were lit by the aurora borealis and occasionally featured buildings that existed in seventeen dimensions simultaneously.

""There's a film director there,"" he continued. ""Jean-Luc Moreau. Brilliant, troubled, obsessed with capturing the authentic human experience on celluloid. He's been trying to make a film about the Resistance, about the night we intervened in 1942. But something is blocking him. Every time he gets close to the truth, his funding disappears, his actors quit, his equipment breaks down.""

""Interference?"" Selapin asked.

""Of a sort. There are forces at work, not supernatural, but bureaucratic. Corporate. The kind of evil that wears suits and signs contracts. They don't want certain stories told. They prefer their history sanitized, their heroes uncomplicated, their truth... digestible.""

Virel turned from the window, his mismatched eyes gleaming with something that might have been anticipation.

""I believe it's time for another visit to Paris. But this time, we're not just fighting Nazis. We're fighting something far more insidious‚Äù.

Chapter 2: The Director's Cut

The rain drummed against the windows of Studio Victorine in Montmartre with the same persistence it had shown forty years earlier, though the Paris beyond had transformed beyond recognition. The cobblestone streets now gleamed with neon reflections, and the sound of automobiles mixed with the distant thrum of electronic music from the clubs that had sprouted like mushrooms after the cultural revolution of the '60s.

Jean-Luc Moreau sat in the editing room, his fingers stained with coffee and cigarette smoke, surrounded by strips of film that hung like prayer flags from every available surface. At fifty-two, he was already being called a master of the Nouvelle Vague, though he privately considered himself a student of life who happened to own a camera.

The film he was working on, ‚ÄúLes Fant√¥mes de la R√©sistance* had been his obsession for three years. It was meant to be his masterpiece, a meditation on the thin line between heroism and survival, between myth and truth. But every time he approached the heart of the story, something went wrong.

The financing from the Ministry of Culture had been mysteriously withdrawn. His lead actor, celebrated for his ability to convey moral complexity, had been offered a Hollywood contract he couldn't refuse. The film stock he'd ordered from Kodak had arrived corrupted, as if it had been deliberately sabotaged.

But it was the interviews that haunted him most.

He'd spent months tracking down survivors of the Resistance, men and women now in their seventies and eighties, their memories fragile as tissue paper. They would begin to tell him their stories, their eyes bright with the fever of recollection. And then, just as they reached the most crucial moments, the night when the Gestapo raids had mysteriously failed, when Nazi officers had been found weeping in the streets, when the impossible had briefly become possible, their voices would fade.

""I'm sorry,"" they would say, looking confused. ""I don't remember. Perhaps it was just a dream.""

Jean-Luc lit another cigarette and stared at the footage he'd managed to salvage. The black and white images flickered past: elderly faces, wrinkled hands, eyes that had seen too much. Somewhere in these fragments lay the truth, but it slipped away like smoke every time he tried to grasp it.

A knock at the door interrupted his brooding. He called out for whoever it was to enter, expecting his assistant or perhaps one of the production investors with more bad news.

Instead, a tall man in an immaculate dark suit stepped into the room, followed by an enormous black dog wearing a silver collar.

Jean-Luc blinked. The man's presence seemed to fill the space in a way that had nothing to do with physical dimensions. One of his eyes was green as fresh leaves; the other was black as a moonless night.

""Monsieur Moreau,"" the stranger said, his voice carrying the weight of centuries. ""I understand you've been having difficulties with your film.""

""Who are you?"" Jean-Luc asked, though something in his chest already knew the answer.

""You may call me Virel. I'm something of a film enthusiast myself. I've been watching your work with great interest.""

The dog padded over to the editing equipment and sat down, its golden eyes studying the strips of film with what appeared to be professional interest.

""This is about the story you're trying to tell,"" Virel continued, settling into a chair that Jean-Luc was certain hadn't been there moments before. ""The night in 1942 when Paris danced with its ghosts.""

Jean-Luc's cigarette trembled between his fingers. ""You know about that?""

""I was there,"" Virel said simply. ""In fact, I was the host.""

The silence stretched between them like a held breath. Outside, the rain continued its eternal conversation with the city's windows.

""You're him,"" Jean-Luc whispered. ""The Devil.""

""Among other things,"" Virel acknowledged. ""But tonight, I'm here as a producer. Your film is important, Monsieur Moreau. There are those who would prefer it never be completed. Corporate interests, political powers, bureaucrats who have discovered that controlling narrative is more effective than controlling armies.""

He gestured to the scattered film strips. ""They've been very successful in their campaign of erasure. Memory is fragile, you see. Stories die when no one tells them. Truth becomes myth, myth becomes legend, legend becomes... nothing.""

Jean-Luc stubbed out his cigarette with shaking hands. ""What do you want from me?""

""I want to make you an offer,"" Virel said. ""Complete funding for your film. Access to the real survivors‚Äîthose who remember everything. Equipment that will never break down, stock that will never corrupt. In exchange...""

""My soul?"" Jean-Luc asked, though he tried to keep the fear from his voice.

Virel laughed, a sound like wine poured over silk. ""God, no. I want something far more valuable. I want you to tell the truth. Not the sanitized version, not the politically convenient version, but the actual truth. The night when the impossible happened. The night when love proved stronger than hate, when ordinary people chose to be extraordinary.""

He leaned forward, his mismatched eyes gleaming. ""But I warn you‚Äîthere will be consequences. The same forces that have been sabotaging your work will escalate their efforts. They'll try to destroy not just your film, but your reputation, your career, perhaps even your sanity.""

""And if I refuse?""

""Then the story dies with you. And the world becomes a little darker, a little more willing to believe that miracles don't happen, that evil always wins, that there's no point in hoping.""

Jean-Luc looked at the dog, who was now wearing what appeared to be a beret at a jaunty angle.

""Does he always come with you on business meetings?""

""Selapin is my collaborator,"" Virel replied. ""He has excellent instincts for character development.""

The dog nodded gravely.

Jean-Luc stood and walked to the window, watching the neon-washed streets of Montmartre. Paris had survived the war, survived the occupation, survived the slow erosion of memory and the systematic rewriting of history. But it had also survived because people had been willing to risk everything to tell the truth.

""What makes you think I'm brave enough for this?"" he asked.

""Because,"" Virel said, rising to join him at the window, ""you've been trying to tell this story for three years despite every obstacle placed in your path. Because you've interviewed dozens of people who've forgotten the most important night of their lives, and you've refused to give up. Because you're standing here, in a room with the Devil and his dog, and you're not running.""

Jean-Luc turned to face him. ""All right. I'll do it. But I have one condition.""

""Name it.""

""I want to see it. The real version. Not the memories, not the fragments, but the actual events. I want to witness the night when Paris danced with its ghosts.""

Virel smiled, and for a moment, his face seemed to flicker‚Äîyoung, old, human, something else entirely.

""That,"" he said, ""can be arranged.""

Chapter 3: The Screening Room of Souls

The screening room existed in the space between spaces, in the fold of reality where time bent back on itself like a filmstrip spliced into a loop. Jean-Luc found himself sitting in a plush velvet chair that seemed to adjust itself to his every movement, facing a screen that stretched beyond the edges of vision.

Beside him, Virel sat with the composure of a man who had attended every premiere since the invention of moving pictures. Selapin lay at their feet, his silver collar gleaming in the dim light that seemed to emanate from the screen itself.

""This is going to be difficult to watch,"" Virel warned. ""Not because of the content‚Äîthough there will be moments of profound darkness‚Äîbut because you're about to witness truth without the filter of human perception. No narrative convenience, no dramatic shortcuts, no comforting lies.""

""I've been making films for twenty years,"" Jean-Luc replied, though his voice carried less confidence than his words. ""I think I can handle the truth.""

""We shall see,"" Virel murmured, and the screen flickered to life.

What Jean-Luc saw was not a film in any conventional sense. It was reality itself, unfolding with the terrible beauty of absolute authenticity. He watched as Professor Marcel Dubois sat in the Caf√© de Flore, his hands trembling as he wrote in his notebook. He saw Marguerite Beaumont working by candlelight, her needle dancing through fabric with the precision of prayer.

But he also saw what the human participants couldn't‚Äîthe invisible threads that connected every action, every choice, every moment of courage or cowardice. He saw how a single act of kindness rippled outward like stones thrown into still water, how a moment of cruelty created shadows that stretched across decades.

""The night at the opera house,"" Jean-Luc whispered as the scene unfolded before him. ""It really happened.""

""Every word. Every gesture. Every impossible thing,"" Virel confirmed. ""But watch carefully. Do you see what your survivors couldn't tell you?""

Jean-Luc leaned forward, studying the images with the intensity of a scholar deciphering an ancient text. And then he saw it‚Äîthe moment when the supernatural guests entered the German officers' ball, he could see the faces of the Nazis not just in the grip of supernatural terror, but in the grip of recognition. They were seeing their own actions reflected back at them, experiencing the fear and helplessness they had inflicted on others.

""They weren't being punished,"" he breathed. ""They were being taught.""

""Precisely,"" Virel said. ""The purpose was never vengeance. It was education. Some learned. Others... didn't.""

The screen showed the aftermath‚Äîthe chaos in the German administration, the miraculous escapes, the documents that appeared as if from nowhere. But it also showed the bureaucrats and corporate interests, even in 1942, already working to control the narrative, to reduce the extraordinary to the explicable.

""They've been at it for forty years,"" Jean-Luc realized. ""Slowly, systematically erasing the memory of that night.""

""They've been very successful,"" Virel agreed. ""But they've made one crucial error. They've forgotten that truth has a way of surfacing, especially when it's told by someone who understands the power of story.""

The screening continued, showing not just the events of that night, but their repercussions through the decades. Jean-Luc watched as Marcel's book was published, classified as fiction, its truth dismissed as metaphor. He saw Marguerite continuing her work after the war, helping refugees and displaced persons, never speaking of the night that changed everything.

And he saw the slow, creeping amnesia that had settled over the city, the way miraculous events were reduced to coincidence, the way people convinced themselves that they had imagined the impossible.

""Why show me this?"" Jean-Luc asked as the final images faded. ""Why now?""

""Because,"" Virel said, rising from his chair, ""history is about to repeat itself. Not with Nazis this time, but with something more insidious. The systematic destruction of human creativity, the reduction of art to commodity, the transformation of stories into products.""

He gestured, and the screen showed contemporary Paris‚Äîthe corporate offices, the media conglomerates, the endless cycle of manufactured entertainment designed to distract rather than inspire.

""Your film is more than just a movie, Monsieur Moreau. It's a weapon against forgetting. But to wield it effectively, you'll need help.""

""What kind of help?""

Virel smiled, and for a moment, Jean-Luc could see the reflection of every person who had ever made a bargain with the Devil‚Äîand survived to tell the tale.

""The same kind I offered forty years ago. The chance to collaborate with the impossible.""

Chapter 4: The New Resistance

The basement of the abandoned theater in Belleville had been transformed into a production studio that defied every law of physics, economics, and common sense. Film equipment from various decades coexisted in harmonious impossibility‚Äîa 1940s Bolex camera sat next to a state-of-the-art Panaflex, while editing equipment that wouldn't be invented for another decade hummed quietly in the corner.

Jean-Luc stood in the center of this technological miracle, watching as his crew worked with the quiet intensity of people who understood they were part of something larger than themselves. The crew itself was... unusual.

Marguerite Beaumont, now in her seventies but with hands still steady as a surgeon's, worked at a costume station where she was creating period-accurate clothing that somehow managed to look more authentic than the originals. Her hair was silver now, but her eyes held the same fierce intelligence that had once saved lives with nothing but needle and thread.

Marcel Dubois, aged but unbroken, sat at a typewriter that clicked out dialogue with the rhythm of a jazz musician finding his groove. His manuscript had been published, dismissed as fiction, but the truth of it burned in every word he wrote for the screenplay.

And scattered throughout the space were others‚Äîsurvivors of the Resistance who had been ""reminded"" of their memories, young filmmakers who had been drawn to the project by dreams they couldn't explain, technicians who found that their equipment worked better in this space than it ever had anywhere else.

Selapin moved through the chaos with the dignity of a cathedral bishop, occasionally offering opinions on lighting angles or the emotional truth of a particular scene. He wore a small pair of spectacles that Jean-Luc was reasonably certain were purely decorative.

""The key,"" Virel explained as he watched the organized chaos, ""is authenticity. Not just historical accuracy, but emotional truth. The audience must believe, even if they can't explain why they believe.""

Jean-Luc nodded, though part of him still felt like he was dreaming. ""And our opposition? The corporate interests you mentioned?""

""They're already mobilizing,"" Virel said. ""Legal challenges, financial pressure, media campaigns designed to discredit the project before it's even complete. They've learned that direct confrontation is less effective than systematic undermining.""

As if summoned by his words, Marguerite looked up from her work. ""There was a man here earlier. Well-dressed, expensive suit. He offered to buy the costumes for ten times what they're worth.""

""Did he give a name?"" Jean-Luc asked.

""Laurent Dubois,"" she replied. ""No relation to our Marcel, I checked. He claimed to represent a consortium of investors interested in 'historical preservation.'""

Virel's expression darkened. ""Dubois. I should have expected they'd send him.""

""You know him?""

""We have a history. He's what you might call a freelance eraser‚Äîsomeone who specializes in making inconvenient truths disappear. Very effective, very expensive, very thorough.""

Jean-Luc felt a chill that had nothing to do with the basement's temperature. ""What does he want?""

""To stop your film from being completed. Or if that proves impossible, to ensure that it's seen by as few people as possible. He's very good at finding legal loopholes, financial irregularities, technical problems that can shut down a production.""

""Then we work faster,"" Jean-Luc said, though he wasn't sure where the confidence in his voice came from.

""We work smarter,"" Virel corrected. ""Dubois operates within the system, using its rules against itself. But we... we operate outside the system entirely.""

He gestured to the impossible equipment, the dedicated crew, the basement that seemed larger inside than outside.

""They can't stop what they can't understand. And they can't understand what they refuse to believe.""

The work continued through the night. Jean-Luc filmed scenes that seemed to direct themselves, captured performances that revealed depths of emotion he hadn't known existed. Marcel's dialogue crackled with the electricity of lived experience, while Marguerite's costumes transformed actors into the very people they were portraying.

But it was the footage itself that provided the greatest miracle.

As Jean-Luc watched the daily rushes, he saw that the cameras had captured more than just the planned scenes. In the background of shots, in the spaces between dialogue, in the reflection of windows and mirrors, other images appeared‚Äîglimpses of the actual events from 1942, as if the past were bleeding through into the present.

""Is this really happening?"" he asked Virel during a break in filming.

""Reality is more fluid than most people realize,"" Virel replied. ""Especially when you're telling a story that needs to be told. The truth has a way of asserting itself, even when it's inconvenient.""

Jean-Luc stared at the screen, watching as a scene of actors portraying Resistance members gradually revealed the faces of the real people they were playing‚Äînot replacing them, but existing simultaneously, past and present occupying the same frame.

""We're not just making a film,"" he realized. ""We're creating a bridge between what was and what is.""

""Now you begin to understand,"" Virel said with satisfaction. ""This is why they're afraid of your work. It's not just entertainment‚Äîit's resurrection.""

Chapter 5: The Devil's Premiere

The premiere of *Les Fant√¥mes de la R√©sistance* was held not in a traditional theater, but in the grand ballroom of the H√¥tel des Invalides‚Äîthe same type of venue where the supernatural intervention had taken place forty years earlier. The invitation list was deliberately small: critics, historians, survivors, and a carefully selected group of people who had been touched by the events of 1942, whether they remembered it or not.

Laurent Dubois stood at the back of the room, his expensive suit and calculating eyes marking him as an outsider among the gathering of artists and intellectuals. He had spent weeks trying to prevent this screening‚Äîlegal injunctions, financial pressure, even anonymous threats. But every obstacle he had placed in the path of the production had been mysteriously overcome.

Now he watched with growing unease as the lights dimmed and the screen flickered to life.

Jean-Luc sat in the front row, his hands clenched in his lap. Beside him, Marguerite and Marcel watched with the intensity of people witnessing their own lives transformed into art. Throughout the audience, elderly faces reflected the glow of the screen, their eyes filled with the slow recognition of half-remembered truths.

The film began quietly, with images of wartime Paris that seemed to breathe with authentic life. The black and white cinematography had a quality that transcended mere technical skill‚Äîit captured not just the appearance of the past, but its emotional weight, its moral complexity, its terrible beauty.

But as the story progressed, something extraordinary began to happen.

The screen seemed to expand, drawing the audience into its depths. The boundaries between performance and reality blurred as the actors seemed to become the very people they were portraying. The dialogue carried the weight of actual conversation, the conflicts felt immediate and urgent.

And then came the supernatural elements.

When Virel made his first appearance on screen, played by an actor who had been cast for his resemblance to the mysterious stranger, something shifted in the theater. The temperature seemed to drop. The air itself seemed to thicken with possibility.

Laurent Dubois felt a familiar chill, a recognition that went deeper than conscious memory. He had been in Paris in 1942, though he had spent decades convincing himself that what he remembered was impossible. He had been a young officer in the Vichy government, present at the German officers' ball that had descended into supernatural chaos.

Now, as the film recreated that night with impossible accuracy, he felt the same terror he had experienced four decades earlier. The screen showed the ghostly dancers, the confrontation between the living and the dead, the moment when reality itself had seemed to crack open and reveal the moral weight of every choice.

But it was the audience's reaction that truly unsettled him.

The elderly survivors were weeping openly, their hands pressed to their mouths as if trying to hold back words that had been locked away for decades. Their eyes were bright with the fever of recollection, and Dubois could see them remembering‚Äînot just the events of the film, but the actual night, the real experience of witnessing the impossible.

""It's true,"" whispered an old woman in the third row, her voice carrying clearly through the hushed theater. ""My God, it's all true.""

Others began to nod, to whisper their own confirmations. The film was not just entertainment‚Äîit was testimony, evidence, proof of a night when the rules of reality had been suspended in service of a greater truth.

Dubois felt panic rising in his chest. This was what he had been hired to prevent‚Äînot just the completion of the film, but its ability to restore suppressed memories, to make the impossible believable once again.

He reached for his phone, intending to call for backup, for legal intervention, for anything that might stop the screening. But his hands wouldn't move. His body seemed frozen, held in place by a force he couldn't name.

On screen, the film reached its climax. The supernatural ball unfolded with devastating authenticity, showing not just the terror of the Nazi officers, but their recognition, their moment of horrified understanding. The ghostly dancers moved with ethereal grace, their faces reflecting the pain of every life that had been lost, every dream that had been shattered.

And then, as the chaos reached its peak, the camera found a figure standing in the balcony above the ballroom‚Äîa tall man with mismatched eyes, raising a goblet in a toast to the mystery of human nature.

The actor on screen turned to face the audience, and for a moment, Dubois could have sworn he was looking directly at him. The green and black eyes seemed to see straight through to his soul, to catalog every compromise, every betrayal, every moment when he had chosen convenience over conscience.

The film ended with the aftermath‚Äîthe rescued families, the transformed city, the quiet heroes who had made the impossible possible. But it also showed the slow erosion of memory, the systematic campaign to reduce miracle to myth, truth to fiction.

As the credits rolled, the theater remained silent. Then, slowly, the applause began. Not the polite acknowledgment of a job well done, but the deep, grateful recognition of a truth finally told.

Jean-Luc stood and turned to face the audience, his eyes bright with tears. ""This film exists because of the courage of those who lived these events,"" he said. ""And it exists despite the efforts of those who would prefer that such stories remain untold.""

His gaze found Dubois in the back of the room, and for a moment, the two men stared at each other across the space‚Äîthe artist and the eraser, the teller of truths and the guardian of lies.

""But some truths,"" Jean-Luc continued, ""are too important to be erased. They have a way of surfacing, of finding their way into the light, no matter how deep they've been buried.""

Dubois felt the weight of every gaze in the room, felt the judgment of history itself settling on his shoulders. He turned and fled, pushing through the doors and into the night, leaving behind the warmth of the theater and the dangerous light of revealed truth.

Behind him, the applause continued, rising like a wave, carrying with it the restored memories of a night when Paris had danced with its ghosts‚Äîand had emerged victorious.

Chapter 6: The Devil's Final Cut

Six months after the premiere, *Les Fant√¥mes de la R√©sistance* had achieved something unprecedented in the history of cinema. It had not just been seen‚Äîit had been experienced, remembered, integrated into the collective consciousness of a city that had spent forty years trying to forget.

The film had been screened in theaters across Paris, each showing creating what critics called ""the phenomenon""‚Äîaudiences who entered as individuals and emerged as a community, connected by the shared recognition of a truth that transcended mere entertainment.

Jean-Luc sat in his editing room, now expanded to accommodate the steady stream of visitors who came seeking his guidance on other ""impossible"" projects. The room itself had settled into a more conventional configuration, though certain pieces of equipment still defied easy explanation.

Marguerite continued her work, though now she designed costumes for films that told other suppressed stories‚Äîthe women who had hidden children during the war, the priests who had forged documents, the ordinary citizens who had chosen heroism over safety.

Marcel had begun a new book, a sequel to his original manuscript, chronicling the making of the film and its aftermath. His typewriter, he claimed, sometimes wrote sentences he hadn't intended, as if the story were telling itself.

And Virel?

He appeared less frequently now, though his influence could be felt in the quality of the work, in the authenticity of the performances, in the way truth seemed to assert itself even in the most fictionalized moments.

""You've done something remarkable,"" he told Jean-Luc during one of his visits. ""You've created a work of art that functions as an act of resistance.""

""Against what?"" Jean-Luc asked, though he thought he knew the answer.

""Against forgetting. Against the systematic reduction of human experience to market-friendly narratives. Against the forces that would prefer a world where miracles don't happen and ordinary people never become heroes.""

Jean-Luc looked at the newest project taking shape on his editing table‚Äîa documentary about the film's impact, featuring interviews with survivors whose memories had been restored, historians who had begun to reconsider the official record, and audience members who had been transformed by the experience of witnessing impossible truth.

""What happens now?"" he asked.

""Now,"" Virel said, ""the work continues. There are other stories to tell, other truths to reveal. And there are others like you‚Äîartists, writers, filmmakers who understand that their work is not just entertainment, but a form of warfare against the forces of amnesia.""

He gestured to the window, where Paris spread out below them like a vast canvas waiting to be painted.

""The Devil's work is never finished,"" he said with a smile. ""But then again, neither is the work of those who oppose him. The difference is that some of us understand that the best way to fight darkness is not with more darkness, but with the light of truth, however inconvenient it might be.""

Selapin padded into the room, his silver collar gleaming. He had taken to wearing a small filmmaker's cap, tilted at a jaunty angle.

""The car is ready,"" he announced. ""We have another appointment.""

""Another film?"" Jean-Luc asked.

""Another story,"" Virel corrected. ""A young woman in Lyon who's been trying to document the disappearance of her grandmother during the war. She's been having some difficulties with... institutional resistance.""

Jean-Luc nodded, understanding. The work continued, as it always had, as it always would. One story at a time, one truth at a time, one moment of recognition that the impossible was not only possible, but necessary.

As Virel and Selapin prepared to leave, the Devil paused at the door.

""By the way,"" he said, his mismatched eyes gleaming with something that might have been pride, ""Laurent Dubois has had a change of heart. He's written a memoir about his experiences during the war‚Äîthe real experiences, not the sanitized version he's been telling for forty years.""

""What changed his mind?""

""The same thing that changed Marcel's mind, and Marguerite's, and yours,"" Virel replied. ""He realized that some truths are too important to be buried, even when telling them costs everything.""

He tipped his hat‚Äîwhen had he acquired a hat?‚Äîand disappeared into the corridors of the building, leaving behind only the faint scent of tobacco, violets, and the indefinable perfume of stories waiting to be told.

Jean-Luc returned to his work, his hands steady as he spliced truth into fiction, fiction into truth, until the distinction no longer mattered. Outside, Paris hummed with the endless rhythm of life‚Äîartists and bureaucrats, dreamers and realists, heroes and cowards, all playing their parts in the great theater of human experience.

And sometimes, late at night, when the city was quiet and the moon was full, visitors to the old theaters and caf√©s might glimpse familiar figures in the shadows‚Äîa tall man with mismatched eyes, a large dog with an improbable collar, a woman with silver hair and knowing eyes, all of them guardians of the stories that must not be forgotten.

The needle and the pen, the camera and the truth, the Devil and the divine, all part of the same endless story that writes itself across the heart of every city, every generation, every soul brave enough to believe in the impossible.

*Fin*

Epilogue: The Eternal Screening

Years later, when Jean-Luc Moreau had become a legend in his own right, when *Les Fant√¥mes de la R√©sistance* had inspired a generation of filmmakers to seek truth in the impossible, when the restored memories of 1942 had become part of the official history of Paris, visitors to the Cin√©math√®que Fran√ßaise might occasionally witness something extraordinary.

In the smallest screening room, late at night, a private showing would sometimes take place. The audience would be limited to a handful of people, survivors, artists, the occasional skeptic who had stumbled upon more than they bargained for. The projectionist would be a large black dog with improbable dignity, operating equipment that seemed to exist in multiple dimensions simultaneously.

The film would always be different, sometimes showing the events of 1942, sometimes the making of Jean-Luc's movie, sometimes stories that had not yet been told but desperately needed to be. The audience would leave transformed, carrying with them the unshakeable knowledge that the impossible was not only possible, but necessary.

And in the back row, barely visible in the darkness, two figures would watch with the satisfaction of work well done‚Äîa tall man with mismatched eyes and a woman with silver hair, their faces reflecting the light of stories that refused to be forgotten.

For in the end, that is what the Devil's work truly was: not the corruption of souls, but the preservation of truth, the protection of memory, the insistence that some things, love, courage, the willingness to risk everything for what is right must never be allowed to fade into darkness.

athletic- literally the same diet almost 99% of the time for last 13 years (zero exaggeration ) - a small uptick in stress ... i would say - but not all the time (morning black coffee drinker )

but about 6-12 months ago .. an incremental shift (shit if you will ) to :

a. notorious constant liquid bowels
b. the feeling of needing to go
c. fecal incontinence (lucky can run fast) started happening 3-4 weeks ago
d. periodic bright blood - when wiping - especially after a day of battle ...

then might be ok for a day or 2... but definitely progressed worse.

then 3 days ago i started IBgard and it was 90% better almost immediately 

i still have the c*ncer fear.. is IBgard just masking a problem -- or is it revealing that it's confirming IBS

Me and my BFF (both 39F) have been best friends since we were 13. We've travelled together, were in each other's wedding parties, have matching tattoos, the whole shebang. Our lives did take different paths; she got divorced, I had two kids but we remained close and my kids even call her Auntie. 
However, in the last couple of years I have felt her pulling away.  I blamed myself as a busy working mom of two so I suggested we have more frequent phone dates (she lives in a different city) to remain in each other's lives. I could feel it getting worse though as when she was in town she'd maybe have time for a quick coffee with me, if she had time at all. But her friends back home got all her time. 
It came to a head this week. I had messaged her a couple weeks ago about a concert we were supposed to see together. She bailed, and I asked if we could do something else instead. A week and a half later of not hearing from her I texted her again to see if she was ok. Two days later she texted me that she doesn't have the ""capacity"" right now for the sort of connection I'm looking for. 
I am genuinely confused. I don't hound her daily, looking for constant communication.  So, AITA for checking in on her? Oh, and it's my birthday on Sunday. So, happy birthday to me?

1lw0wak,https://i.redd.it/4zuegst3fybf1.jpeg,thief at terra 28th,"hi. i just want to post this for awareness, and also to get this off my chest na. i'm not expecting for anything to be returned to me. i just want to warn everyone who will read this, who is as 'kampante' as me na bgc is the safest place. (TwT)

so it happened last night, around 9:30 pm to 10:00 pm. i was out for my mandatory jog, and 
 bitbit ko lang yung body bag ko (pic is attached) and my tumbler for my iced coffee. kampante akong iniwan yung bag ko sa mga table-like pedestals(?) doon, which is such a careless act from me, i know (TwT). it was the third time i'm leaving my bag so i thought, nothing will happen as usual. plus there's a security guard and lots of police in the area helping with traffic, so i thought, one will be fearful enough not to steal.

after my third ikot, dun ko na napansin na wala sa usual place yung bag ko. the only thing left was my tumbler, which i am grateful cause the tumbler was a gift from my baby sister. buti may conscience pa yung kumuha to leave something, haha. in a panic, i tried seeing anyone unusual near my area. nanginginig pa ako. i approached the person nearest to me, a japanese woman, and tried asking her but she don't speak english or tagalog. she was also filming that time so i felt sorry for disturbing her. then, i went to the police guiding the traffic and explained what happened. he just explained to me that terra is an open area and they can't really do something about it. dun na ako nanlumo. he said i can file a blotter but i thought wala din namang mangyayari if i do, so i just let it be. hindi ko na natapos yung run ko and i just called my baby sister to inform her on what happened. (and rn i'm realizing na hindi din ako naka cooldown stretches TwT)

as i'm writing this, i realize the contents of my bag are not really much.
- umbrella (this one is the most important since it's been raining a lot here in bgc)
- retro cam (it's a sony cybershot. i've only used it once. my sister gave it to me as a gift since i helped her bought her olympus cam na. i take pictures as a hobby, so i'll have to settle with my phone camera for now. the contents of that camera are mostly of my tita's selfies and the most recent ones are just bgc scenes and some cats so i can live without it)
- my apartment keys (i can easily duplicate them so no worries)
- my lippies (i'm crying TwT why did i put my lipstick, lip gloss and lip balm there when the plan is to iust jog, now i look sick at work TwT)
- my cutesy heart mirror (TwT)
- comb (TwT)
- my empty earbuds charging case (which i think is a sign for me to buy a new pair, since i already lost my left earbuds and i'm just waiting  for something to happen to buy a new pair TwT)
- and the whole body bag itself (cause it's functional and comfy, and it's my work bag! TwT i have to find a better one na. i will really miss that TwT)

i don't want anything to stress me out. i kept on chanting the serenity prayer pagkauwi haha. i can only pray for the things that i lost, and to pray for the person who stole my bag. i hope they can find their purpose in life and just be happy and contented. i can't imagine being so low that the only thing i can do is to stole someone else's properties. the contents of my bag are not that much but i hope they can use it for their needs.

and i felt frustrated too, scared and sad last night. and i'm feeling sorry for my sister cause she entrusted me with her cam. she already said it's fine na, and the important thing is that i am safe. i can only think positively now, see the good side of what happened. this is a learning experience for me. and paalala to everyone else.

be aware and keep safe everyone.

I've been a general manager at a coffee shop for a little under a year now and I seriously don't understand how anyone does this job and remains sane. I adore being a barista, but oh my lord I don't know how to handle my job anymore. There are so many things wrong with the shop which i take responsibility for but also I feel like I dont have the time to take care of certain thing when I am so busy doing literally everything else. I deal with lots of call ins. I dont know if I'm doing something wrong that makes people call in so much or if they're genuinely sick or whatever but it's insane how often it happens. I know it's supposed to be the managers job to cover for someone who can't make it in, but usually I'm at work all day already. We dont really have any way to call anyone else in unless I get really lucky and someone actually responds to my desperate pleas. I end up working by myself a lot (or with a very short staff) because people call in. I feel terrible for the people who end up suffering because we end up being short staffed. We tend to be very busy. we have a front bar, a full kitchen, and a drive thru bar, and when we are operating with 2-3 people it's almost impossible to keep up with everything. Also people are always quitting. I know that's the nature of coffee shops, people tend to come in go but it seems excessive. We dont get paid extremely well so I'm sure that's a factor for many people who leave but its still insane to me. 3 people quit just this week. I dont know what I'm doing wrong. I am appreciative of my staff and I let them know it. They are amazing individuals and I see a lot of them as friends which makes it difficult when someone leaves. I dont know if I am doing something wrong or if its just my lack of experience. I feel tired and burnt out. I feel like I can't enjoy a day off without the impending fear that someone is going to call in. And scheduling is a nightmare, I dont know how anyone does it. üò≠ I think I'm just not cut out for this life but the guilt of quitting would ruin me. I dont like leaving jobs on a bad foot but if I quit now I would feel so bad. I am the only full time employee, if I left there would be no one to work most days lol. And dont get me wrong I do love my job some days. I love the people, I love coffee, and food. It is enjoyable for the most part ive definitely worked worse jobs but omg is it draining. I just need to find a healthy balance or set some boundaries. But honestly I really dont know what to do. I just needed to get this off my chest if nobody reads this that's ok.

Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt have enough balls and when I finally got more balls, he was gone. lol but I‚Äôm still happy to have my one Snorlax I just wanted to know is that a coincidence or is that normal to find him in the same place?

My mom was diagnosed with Crohn's around 2005 and went through absolute hell with it. She eventually passed from it plus complications from her medicine.  I've always been extremely paranoid about Crohn's.  

I've always had stomach issues, but the last few years I've actually been able to eat mainly anything. I still get daily (mild to moderate) stomach pain, but not bad. I started eating spicy food 2 years ago and haven't had a problem. I've had nausea daily after coffee for 6+ years. Lower back pain daily. Random abdominal pain, etc. 

Three weeks ago, I thought I had food poisoning. Violent vomitting, diarrhea, was getting full way faster. It didn't feel like my stomach was digesting properly (I could feel it burning and sitting in my stomach,) severe indigestion and gas for several days. It was rough, but seems to be easing up. 

I ate light and started taking prilosec, but I accidently ate Wasabi two days ago and the exact same thing happened. I felt dizzy, lethargic, and couldn't keep water down. 

My doctor Tuesday put me on the brat diet and called in pantoprazole. I have a follow up in a week and she suggested an endoscopy if symptoms are still there. 

Should I mention Crohns to her? Does this even sound like Crohn's disease? My mom had so many complications with her Crohns while i took care of her that I'm terrified I'll go through the same thing. ",2,1752112063.0,CrohnsDisease,5,1.0,False

1lw0kqw,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuitVaping/comments/1lw0kqw/to_anyone_thinking_they_should_quit_but_havent/,To anyone thinking they should quit but haven't yet...read The Easy Ways!,"As the title says, if you've been thinking about quitting but think 'im just not ready', or  'I enjoy it too much right now' or anything else like that....my best advice is to read: The Easy Way to quit vaping/smoking by Allan Carr (or better yet, listen to the audio book) 

I was a 20 yr smoker (several of those years I was a secret smoker) and 4 years a vaper (most of those years a secret vaper) 
And I too thought, oh but I enjoy it so much, or it gives me pleasure. Like we all believe, I thought it was the thing that helped me relax, the thing that helped me de-stress, the thing that I used when I was depressed, happy, angry, sad, etc etc... and my favorite vaping times were: on a warm summer day, while I was cooking, while I was driving, after a big meal, with coffee, while drinking, at a concert.... you get the picture...any time was my 'favorite time' to vape.

Plus, I believed that I wasn't ready to quit because I thought I didn't have the willpower. I tried countless times to cut down or quit cold turkey, but it was too hard and never stuck. One night out, or a sunny afternoon, or a stressful day at work and I was back at it. 
I've told myself every lie and excuse in the book to feel better about failing to quit like: 'i dont do it that much anyways' or 'well at least I'm not smoking anymore'. Anything to trick myself into thinking it was ok to keep going. 

Anyways, I had heard about the book from so many people and thought there is no way a book can really help if I'm not ready and don't have willpower. We've all heard the saying that a smoker or vaper has to want to quit on their own, and no one can make them quit. But I think that's the hardest part..... to convince yourself that you want to quit and then find the willpower to do it. 

Well, I'm here to tell you, you don't need any willpower!! It's all a trick. A lie. Brainwashing, that has made us believe we need some super power strength to stop.....we don't!
We just need to un-brainwash ourselves and this book does exactly that. 

I started listening to it occasionally in the car on my way to work (while hitting my vape), then little by little some little fact would stick in my mind. So I'd restart the chapter again and really pay attention. 
It took months to get through the book, but once I really gave it a fair shot and truly listened to the words, everything became so clear.
 
I'm 40 days nicotine free today, cold turkey, no willpower needed. 

Yes the first few days of withdrawal to get the nicotine out of my system were a bit uncomfortable, but nothing that I couldn't handle... Seriously! 
Once you understand you are not depriving yourself of anything, the withdrawal becomes totally manageable, and then after that initial period it becomes easier and easier. This is what the book does for you. 

Lastly, I can say with 100% certainty that most of the things that I thought vaping was helping me with (anxiety, stress, depression, sadness, anger, etc) most, if not all of it was made worse or even caused by the vaping. Since stopping my mood is better, my anxiety is down, and I feel like I'm just more present in life and not just fixated on when I'm gonna hit my vape next and planning my entire day around it. I thought I was gonna be miserable after I quit, but it's the exact opposite!

This coming from a 20+ year smoker/vaper who genuinely believed she LOVED it. 
Trust me, you don't love it, you don't need it, and you don't need willpower to stop either. It really can be that easy

Hope this helps someone out there, because I never believed a book would help me. But what have you got to lose? ",1,1752111914.0,QuitVaping,0,1.0,False

I work Monday - Friday, 6am - 12:30 (usually 1:30pm) every week. It‚Äôs a cafe and art gallery, small business family owned. 

I am the only main employee there, literally only me everyday (not that it‚Äôs busy enough where I need an extra person, but has its moments). I‚Äôm expected to run the cafe myself, as well as the art gallery too. Everything from making coffees, to planning exhibitions, to social media‚Äôs, etc etc. I am the sole manager essentially. 

The work itself isn‚Äôt hard, it‚Äôs just tedious sometimes. It comes naturally to me tbh it‚Äôs nothing crazy. 

Now here is my question, the owner wants me to work Saturdays because he has had bad luck with Saturday workers lately. I usually do 1 Saturday a month as it is, but he wants me to move to every other Saturday or every Saturday except 1 a month. Simply put, I do not want to. 

For one, my pay would not increase by much, let alone I‚Äôm not happy with how my pay is atm. Second, I value my work life balance greatly and my weekends are my time. I have tons of personal things I plan and do, and I can‚Äôt ask for time off anyways, so I don‚Äôt want to give up one of the only days a week I have off. This job is not my life, so I don‚Äôt want to treat it like it is you know? 

I have a pretty twisted sense of what‚Äôs acceptable and not at the moment due to hearing multiple different sides so I‚Äôd like some other views. Am I just being tough and should suck it up and do it?",2,1752111894.0,work,20,0.67,False

I tried to brew the first actual pot of coffee today, and it ran fine for a minute or two, but then suddenly stopped boiling water. I read a few posts that mentioned the float valve getting stuck due to scale buildup or ""airlocked"" by a bubble in the loop, so I emptied the reservoir and both blew and sucked the residual water out of the central spout, as well as completely inverted the machine over the sink to try and get all water out of the loop.
 I heard the flapper move freely when I emptied the reservoir into my sink, but it could still be getting stuck for some reason. As I said, this is a brand new machine, so scale isn't an issue, unless I got bamboozled by Scamazon with a returned unit. 
The support line is closed at the time of writing this, so I'll have to call tomorrow, but does anyone here have any suggestions to try and salvage the situation in time for morning coffee tomorrow?",2,1752111841.0,Moccamaster,1,1.0,False

I stayed in a highly rated Airbnb close to Acropolis. On our last day, my boyfriend and I went out for morning coffee, came back briefly, and then left for the day. When we returned about 10 hours later, we found the apartment had been robbed.

What‚Äôs disturbing is there was no sign of forced entry‚Ä¶the windows were locked, the door wasn‚Äôt broken, and it uses one of those high security keys. My wallet, an iPad, cash, and some credit cards were stolen and the cards were used that same day, while we were still out. Thankfully, our passports weren‚Äôt taken and I had my ID on me.

The police came, and the host showed up. He kept repeating that he‚Äôs the only one with the spare key so it‚Äôs unclear what happened. It felt like whoever did this knew exactly when we left and the card activity lined up with the time we went out.

The area near the Acropolis felt really safe and everyone in Athens was kind, so this came as a total shock. Just sharing this to urge people to be extra cautious. opt for keycode access if you can, and don‚Äôt assume a 5 star rating guarantees security.

If you do visit this area, make sure to hide your valuables before heading out for the day‚Äîjust to be safe. Better to be overcautious than sorry.

That‚Äôs a bigger subject. 

Onto this: when the city sold the 58 River St parcel downtown and subsequently approved Metro Star‚Äôs development, one of the key factors that Mayor Blake pushed for was a grocery store. Makes sense, as downtown could really use one for better livability. 

Fast forward to now. I‚Äôve heard from sources that a grocer was going in but fell through. And now businesses are moving into the space that are duplicative of existing businesses downtown (including another coffee shop!). 

What is up with this? When the city sold the land, was there nothing in writing? Was this just a handshake agreement? Is the city not enforcing the agreement properly? 

Similarly the Metro Star development on the green was sold in partly because they promised a restaurant in the old funeral home. When the restaurant backed out, the developer instead moved the lawyer office next door into it so they could tear down that building and build more apartments. I‚Äôm not opposed to more apartments, but I am opposed to a bait and switch and a prime property on the green being wasted as an office.

I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pok√©mon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf üôÉ

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

Its hands moved steadily, as if to reassure the occupant that time had not stopped. The curtains were drawn tightly, casting long shadows across the floor. In the corner, a figure sat hunched over, the faint blue glow of a computer screen illuminating their face. Their eyes, once vibrant, were now bloodshot and tired. This was Mark, a man whose world had grown smaller with each passing day.



Mark had been a devoted gamer since his childhood. His apartment was a testament to his obsession, filled with shelves of video games, posters of digital worlds, and a collection of figurines that had started as a casual hobby and evolved into a small army. His friends had long ago given up on inviting him out; they knew where he would be - right here, in front of his console, navigating the latest adventure. Tonight was different, though. Tonight, he was about to unwrap a game that had consumed his thoughts for weeks: Five Nights at Freddy's Security Breach for the PS4.



With trembling hands, he peeled back the plastic wrapping and slid the disc into the tray. The console hummed to life, the familiar whirring of the fan melding with the mechanical clank of the game's intro. As the title screen loaded, Mark couldn't help but feel a peculiar sense of anticipation. He had read the reviews, watched the trailers, and even studied the game's lore in preparation for this moment. Yet, as the game began, he realized that none of it had prepared him for the reality of what was to come.



The game's protagonist, a young boy named Gregory, stumbled through the darkened hallways of Freddy Fazbear's Mega Pizzaplex. The place was eerily quiet, almost too quiet. The neon lights flickered, casting an eerie glow on the lifeless animatronics that stood sentinel in the shadows. Mark felt a knot form in his stomach, an unusual sensation for a seasoned horror gamer. As he took control of the character, the atmosphere grew increasingly oppressive. It wasn't just the game's graphics or the chilling score; something about this game was off, and he couldn't quite put his finger on it.



He navigated the game's tutorial, learning the ropes of the new security system. Each button press and camera switch was met with a cold precision that seemed to echo through the room. The instructions were clear, but something in their digital voice was... off-putting. It was too lifelike, too personal. The game was designed to be immersive, but Mark felt like he was being watched, as if the game itself was a sentient being observing his every move.



As the night progressed, the tension grew palpable. The animatronics grew restless, their movements becoming more erratic and unpredictable. Mark's heart raced as he tried to stay one step ahead, his eyes darting between the game's screens and the darkened corridors of his own apartment. It was then that he heard it: the soft, metallic patter of footsteps outside his door. He paused the game, his breath held in suspense. The sound grew louder, more deliberate. He told himself it was just the old building, creaking under the weight of the years.



With trembling hands, he reached for the doorknob. The cold metal sent a shiver down his spine. He took a deep breath and opened the door, expecting to find nothing but the empty hallway outside. Instead, he was met with the sight of a robotic Freddy Fazbear staring back at him, its LED eyes piercing through the darkness. Mark stumbled backward, his chair scraping against the floor. The figure didn't move, just stared. Then, the screen of his TV flickered, and the game continued as if nothing had happened.



Confusion swirled through Mark's mind. Was he hallucinating from sleep deprivation? He rubbed his eyes and looked back at the doorway, but the terrifying figure was gone. He convinced himself it was just his imagination playing tricks on him and tried to refocus on the game. Yet, as he played on, the lines between reality and the game grew increasingly blurred. The sounds of the game bled into his apartment, making him jump at every creak and groan of his ancient floorboards.



The game's plot grew more intense, with the animatronics becoming more aggressive and the stakes higher with each passing minute. Mark's apartment felt less like a sanctuary and more like an extension of the game's haunting world. The air grew thick with a sense of dread, as if the very fabric of his reality was being unraveled by the digital nightmare unfolding before him.



He played through the night, the game's grip on him tightening with every passing hour. He could feel the animatronics closing in, their breath hot on his neck. His heart pounded in his chest, the game's tension mirrored in his own life. By the time the first light of dawn seeped through the cracks in the curtains, Mark was a wreck, his nerves frayed and his eyes glazed over.



But the game wasn't finished with him yet. As the final credits rolled, a chilling message scrawled itself across the screen: ""Thank you for your dedication. Your shift is never over."" The screen went black, and the room fell silent. Mark sat there, the controller slipping from his hands, wondering if he had just played a game or if the game had played him. He glanced around his apartment, the shadows seemingly alive with menace. Had he just survived a digital horror, or had he invited something far more sinister into his world?



The faint sound of mechanical footsteps grew louder, now unmistakable in the stillness of the early morning. His heart hammered in his chest, and his palms grew slick with sweat. He told himself it was just the aftermath of the intense game, his mind playing tricks on him, but the doubt remained. The footsteps grew closer, a rhythmic tattoo that sent a cold shiver down his spine. Then, with a suddenness that made him jump, the door to his apartment shuddered under an unseen force.



The wood splintered, and the door burst open, revealing the terrifying figure of an animatronic Freddy Fazbear standing in the doorway. The creature's eyes glowed with a malicious intent that seemed to fill the room. Mark's vision swam, and he stumbled backward, knocking over a chair in his haste to get away. The Freddy animatronic stepped into the room, its movements fluid yet jerky, as if it were a puppet controlled by an invisible hand. The game had come to life, and Mark was no longer a spectator but a participant in a game with very real consequences.



Panic surged through him, and he scrambled to his feet, his mind racing. He had read about glitches, about players finding hidden secrets and Easter eggs, but this was something else entirely. The Mega Pizzaplex was supposed to be confined to the screen, a digital playground of horrors that could be turned off at any moment. Now, it seemed the monsters had broken free of their pixelated prison, and he was in their world. The animatronic advanced, its grin never wavering, and Mark realized with a sinking feeling that he had no idea what to do next. The rules of the game had changed, and he was utterly unprepared for the nightmare that now surrounded him.



Just when he thought escape was impossible, he spotted a flicker of movement in the corner of his eye. Chica, Monty, and Roxy emerged from the shadows, flanked by an eerie army of endoskeletons. The sight of them should have sent him spiraling into a deeper pit of fear, but instead, he felt a spark of hope. If they had made it out of the game, perhaps there was a way to fight back. He took off running, his feet pounding against the floorboards as the metallic thuds of the endos grew closer. The animatronics didn't pursue him immediately, but he knew they were there, waiting for their chance to pounce.



In a stroke of luck, Mark found himself face to face with an elevator. He punched the button frantically, the doors sliding open with a ding that seemed to mock the urgency of his situation. He dove inside, the endos hot on his heels. The doors closed just as their cold, bony fingers brushed the metal, and the elevator began to ascend. His heart thudded against his ribcage, the air thick with anticipation as the numbers ticked away. When the elevator finally opened, it revealed a sight that was both unexpected and oddly comforting: the neon lights of the West Arcade, where the DJ Music Man presided over his dance floor.



The DJ looked up, his digital eyes meeting Mark's terrified gaze. ""Want to dance?"" he asked, his voice echoing through the speakers with a cheery tone that seemed to clash with the horror that had just unfolded. Mark's mind reeled, trying to process the absurdity of the situation. Was this a hallucination? A final, desperate bid by his brain to make sense of the madness? Or was there a method to the game's twisted narrative?



Taking a deep breath, he gathered his thoughts and approached the DJ, his voice shaking. ""Everything... everything is out of control,"" he managed to say. The DJ nodded, his smile never faltering. ""I know, I know,"" he said, his hands dancing over the turntable. ""But fear not, for I am on your side. Tell me your tale, and I shall see what can be done."" Mark recounted his experience, the strange blurring of the lines between game and reality, and the ominous message that had sealed his fate. As the words spilled out, the DJ nodded sagely, his expression thoughtful. ""Ah, Freddy,"" he murmured. ""Always up to his old tricks. But we'll show him, won't we?""



The DJ's offer of help was a lifeline in the storm of chaos, and Mark clung to it with desperation. He knew he could trust Freddy Fazbear's word - it was the very reason he had chosen to play the game. The animatronics had personalities, albeit twisted ones, and if DJ Music Man was willing to assist him, then perhaps there was a way to beat the game at its own twisted rules. He took a moment to compose himself, the thumping bass of the arcade's music a strange backdrop to the horror he had just faced. Then, with a newfound determination, he turned back to the DJ. ""Okay,"" he said. ""Let's do this.""



The DJ's eyes gleamed, and his hands flew over the controls. The music grew louder, the beat pounding in Mark's chest in time with his racing heart. ""First things first,"" he said, the volume of the speakers rising to a crescendo. ""We need to send a message to Freddy. Let him know we're not playing by his rules anymore."" The arcade lights flickered in sync with the music, and the endos surrounding the elevator froze in place, their eyes dimming. A plan was forming in Mark's mind, one that was as outlandish as the situation itself, but he knew it was his only chance.



Together, Mark and DJ Music Man devised a strategy that would take them deeper into the game's twisted world, using the very mechanics that had been designed to terrify him against the animatronics. It was a risky gamble, one that could either see him free of the game's clutches or dragged further into the abyss. But as the music blared and the lights danced, Mark felt a strange exhilaration. For the first time since the game had started, he felt like he had some semblance of control.



They ventured through the pizzeria, dodging Freddy and his cohorts, using the arcade's games as cover. Each machine they passed, Mark could feel the animatronics' eyes on him, watching his every move. The DJ provided a distraction, playing his tunes loud enough to mask their footsteps but not so loud that it would draw unnecessary attention. They moved swiftly, weaving in and out of the shadows, their hearts beating in tandem with the pulse of the game's world.



As they approached the control room, the music grew more intense. Mark could feel his adrenaline spiking, his senses heightened. He knew what he had to do. The DJ handed him a USB drive, a digital key to the kingdom. ""This will reset the game,"" he said, his voice barely audible over the din. ""But beware, it will not be easy. Freddy will not go quietly into the night.""



Mark took the USB drive with a trembling hand. This was it, the moment of truth. He plugged it into the computer, and the screen flickered. The music stuttered, the lights dimmed, and the animatronics froze. For a brief second, the pizzeria was silent, a tableau of horror suspended in time. And then, the chaos erupted.



Freddy roared to life, his eyes blazing red with fury. The other animatronics snapped out of their trance, converging on the control room with a ferocity that sent Mark's heart racing. The DJ sprang into action, spinning tracks that sent the endos into a frenzied dance, buying Mark precious seconds to execute his plan.



The screen flashed, and the game world around them began to distort. The walls of the pizzeria warped and stretched, the very fabric of the game bending to Mark's will. He could feel the power of the USB drive pulsing in his hand, a digital beacon of hope. He slammed it into the computer, and the world went dark.



When the lights came back up, he was back in his apartment, the game's grip on reality released. The TV screen flickered to life, displaying a message: ""Thank you for playing. Your efforts have not gone unnoticed. The pizzeria has been shut down. Goodbye, Mark."" A sense of relief washed over him, and he sank into his chair, the controller slipping from his hand. The nightmare was over.



But as the sun rose, casting a warm glow over the room, Mark couldn't shake the feeling that something was still off. The game's influence lingered, a specter at the edge of his vision. The USB drive lay on the floor, a silent testament to his victory, yet he couldn't help but wonder if it was truly the end. He looked around his apartment, the shadows seemingly darker, the silence heavier. The game had changed him, left a mark that he wasn't sure would ever truly fade.



And as the day grew louder with the sounds of the city, he found himself questioning the very nature of reality. Was it all just a game? A series of pixels and code that could be manipulated and reset at will? Or had he glimpsed something more, a world where the lines between digital and physical were not as clear as he had once believed?



The phone on the coffee table rang, jolting him out of his thoughts. He picked it up, expecting to hear a telemarketer or a wrong number. Instead, it was a child's voice, faint and distant. ""Hello? Are you still there?"" it asked. Mark's blood ran cold, and he realized with a start that it was the voice of a missing child, one that had been haunting the game's lore for years. The voice grew closer, more insistent. ""You can't just leave me here,"" it whispered, the line crackling with static.



Mark's heart skipped a beat as he realized that the game had left one final piece of itself behind. He looked around his apartment, the shelves of games and figurines seeming to watch him with a newfound malice. The USB drive lay forgotten on the floor, a symbol of his temporary victory. But as he stared into the void of his now empty TV screen, he understood that the game had never been about winning or losing. It was about surviving.",0,1752111596.0,creepypasta,0,0.5,False

I remembered how he offered his condo in manila just because I left home.

( we never had a chance to meet in person) 

this was his message afterward. surprisingly, he still has my number, and he knows that I got married this year and wished me and my hubby well. anyway, I am literally his greatest love and he's still single up until now haha.

This year, we're doing it in the Low Pass area, where we have three NICE gravel pits to shoot at!



These three gravel pits are ideal for target shooting, as they are well away from other recreational activity, are safe places to shoot, and are places you'll want your grandchildren to shoot at.

I (27 F) started working at a big corporate firm a few months ago and developed a crush on a guy (probs like 33 M) in a different division. But basically since I started he‚Äôs been giving me pretty intense and charged eye contact and I thought he was cute so I gave it back. After a few weeks of that, and about one awkward small talk conversation in the break room, I decided to approach him and introduce myself when he was walking by one day. He was very sweet and I was shaking and nervous but he asked me a follow up question and just about what my position is basically.

A couple weeks later I decided to message him on a work message platform asking if he ever wanted to take a break and grab coffee I‚Äôm down. He responded and said yes and we planned a time to put on the calendar. About two weeks ago we had our coffee during work at a cafe in our building and I thought it went well! He was very attentive, asking questions, paying for my coffee, giving me the better seat. Anyways to make a long short, after coffee it‚Äôs been kind of awkward again. He still stares at me and I smile and wave and he smiles en waves back and sometimes says hi to me in the hallway. The same day we had coffee I had messaged him ‚Äúthanks for the coffee lmk if you need another break again!‚Äù And he said ‚Äúno problem and will do!‚Äù.

I (27 F) started working at a big corporate firm a few months ago and developed a crush on a guy (probs like 33 M) in a different division. But basically since I started he‚Äôs been giving me pretty intense and charged eye contact and I thought he was cute so I gave it back. After a few weeks of that, and about one awkward small talk conversation in the break room, I decided to approach him and introduce myself when he was walking by one day. He was very sweet and I was shaking and nervous but he asked me a follow up question and just about what my position is basically. 

A couple weeks later I decided to message him on a work message platform asking if he ever wanted to take a break and grab coffee I‚Äôm down. He responded and said yes and we planned a time to put on the calendar. About two weeks ago we had our coffee during work at a cafe in our building and I thought it went well! He was very attentive, asking questions, paying for my coffee, giving me the better seat. Anyways to make a long short, after coffee it‚Äôs been kind of awkward again. He still stares at me and I smile and wave and he smiles en waves back and sometimes says hi to me in the hallway. The same day we had coffee I had messaged him ‚Äúthanks for the coffee lmk if you need another break again!‚Äù And he said ‚Äúno problem and will do!‚Äù. 

So I just can‚Äôt tell if I should assume he‚Äôs not interested or if he‚Äôs shy and cautious because we are at work. Need advice!! ",1,1752110729.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False
1lw05k5,https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/1lw05k5/pharmacies_and_this_europeans_sad_plight/,Pharmacies and this European's sad plight,"Let me preface by saying I had a fabulous time in Boston. Those brick houses, university area, American diner with free coffee refill...yes, experiences I definitely will remember.

I am not sure if you all consider Walgreens/CVS as pharmacies, but my goodness...why is everything behind bars? Even in big malls? Boston felt extremely safe...

But I guess what annoyed me is that I was on a lookout for compression stockings - the ones you were on plane to prevent getting blood clots. And I found one at a reasonable price at this CVS at Prudential Tower(?). Paid and went back to my European country because I wanted to give it to my grandma - and what you know - there was nothing in it. The box was EMPTY. 

Oh my goodness. 

Really - do people steal compression stocking too? Should these have been behind the lock and key like many other products were? 

I am pretty annoyed and just wanted to rant this part out. 

So psa, especially for travellers, open all your goods in stores (even if they are gifts) to ensure that things are actually in the box. ",35,1752110682.0,boston,23,0.74,False

I've never seen this happen. I'm curious if a coffee influencer made a video recommending them or something?

Anyways, I'd love some recommendations for roasters around the same price point. I brew with a v60 if that matters.

My go-to coffees are light roast naturals. Though after trying their lychee coferment, it easily took the spot for my favorite coffee. I'm also a fan of variety so I usually order a few bags of interesting sounding beans of various styles.

It seems like many tourists on reddit all go to the same places and I think you miss some great  experiences and I'd like to highlight a few from my most recent trip.  I strongly recommend walking or driving around and just finding places that look interesting.

Caye Caftans: This business opened in Nov and makes beautiful silk blouses, shirts and caftans.  You can try on and buy items right from the workshop where the seamstresses work.  This is a beautiful and elegant souvenir and the ladies were so delighted to help me pick one.

The Alibi: Joe, the owner and bartender makes the best drinks in Belize (literally) and is a fascinating conversationalist.  Best rum punch I've ever tasted.  But don't oder something specific, just let him create a custom drink for you.  Joe has won many national titles for his drinks and gotten accolades at international competitions too.  Also, the food is excellent!  All four people in our group ordered something different and, when we returned, we all ordered our same meals again because they were so tasty.  Joe's vision is to serve the kind of scrumptious Belizean fare his mom made.

Charmaigne's: we visited for dessert several times, but they serve breakfast and coffee drinks too.  We liked to eat at a restaurant in town then go to Charmaigne's for an awesome dessert.  The chocolate caramel cake is to die for.  The carrot cake was also great.  Serving sizes are large.

Honorable mention to Churro O Clock

None of these businesses were ones I had visited before this 5th trip, which is why I want to encourage visitors to take the time to always explore and not just visit the same old stops as all the other tourists mention here on reddit.

Enjoy!

EDIT: I should have also mentioned Patz Deli (right near the yacht club).  Nice mix of Belizean and American options and tasty food.  Pat is an American expat.  Nice vibe.  My kids loved being able to order choc chip pancakes, but they also had fry Jack's and other Belizean staples",7,1752110363.0,Belize,4,1.0,False
1lw01ff,https://www.reddit.com/r/homechemistry/comments/1lw01ff/easy_simple_and_otc_clomethiazole_and/,Easy Simple and otc Clomethiazole and Bromethiazole synthesis,"For Bromethiazole:
 
Same steps you replace Con hcl with Hydrobromic acid in first step



Clomethiazole HCL Synthesis:

Sulfurol ( 4-me-5-thiazole-ethanol ), Con hcl, Alcohol (iso,ethyl,methyl) , PTFE (Teflon), Distilled water, and a Heavy-walled borosilicate pressure vessel 

In a sturdy heavy-walled borosilicate pressure vessel, carefully add 125 mL concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl) and 10 g sulfurol (2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-ylmethanol). Make sure the vessel is dry before adding chemicals. Seal the vessel tightly using a PTFE (Teflon) threaded stopper, then wrap the threads with PTFE tape to ensure a leak-proof seal. This prevents any corrosive fumes or liquid from escaping during heating. Place the sealed vessel into an oil bath preheated to 150¬∞C. Maintain this temperature for 3 hours, allowing the reaction to proceed under pressure. The high temperature promotes the formation of clomethiazole hydrochloride by substitution. 

After 3 hours, carefully remove the vessel from the oil bath and let it cool briefly before opening. Pour the reaction mixture into a round-bottom flask. Using a rotary evaporator or vacuum setup, remove the excess hydrochloric acid under reduced pressure at a temperature below 50¬∞C. This avoids decomposition and leaves behind a dark, semi-solid sticky residue containing the crude product. Gradually add isopropanol (isopropyl alcohol) to the residue with continuous stirring. Keep the mixture heated gently just below the boiling point of isopropanol (80¬∞C) to fully dissolve the residue. This ensures a homogeneous solution for better crystallization. Allow the solution to cool down slowly to room temperature, then place the flask in a freezer at around 20¬∞C for about 3 hours. This cold environment helps the clomethiazole hydrochloride crystallize out of solution. 

Filter the formed white crystalline solid using vacuum or gravity filtration through filter paper or a coffee filter. Rinse the crystals once with a small amount (10 mL) of cold isopropanol to wash off impurities. Dry the collected crystals gently, either by air drying in a low humidity environment or using mild heat (below 50¬∞C) on a hot plate or drying oven to avoid melting or degradation. The final yield is typically around 8.2 g (60%) of white clomethiazole hydrochloride crystals, which should have a pungent odor characteristic of the compound.
