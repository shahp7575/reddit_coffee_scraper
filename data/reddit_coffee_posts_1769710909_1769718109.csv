For the last year or so I've been feeling tired no matter how much I sleep. I go to bed at 11, wake up at 7, eight full hours. But I feel exhausted by noon. Coffee gets me through but that's not sustainable.

Went to a doctor thinking it might be something serious. Did blood tests, thyroid, vitamin levels, everything came back normal. Doctor asked about sleep quality not just quantity. Asked if I wake up during the night, if I change positions a lot, if I feel rested in the morning.

When I actually paid attention I realized I do wake up multiple times. Not fully, just enough to shift position and go back to sleep. Maybe 4 or 5 times a night. And mornings I feel stiff, especially lower back and shoulders.

Doctor suggested my mattress might be the issue. That a poor sleeping surface can cause you to change positions frequently because your body can't find comfort. You technically sleep but you never reach deep sleep. Hence feeling tired despite 8 hours.

My mattress is about 6 years old. A mid range foam mattress that was fine initially. Now that I think about it, the decline in my sleep quality has been gradual. It didn't suddenly become bad, it just slowly got worse

I want to test this theory. Get a proper mattress and see if sleep quality improves.

Budget is around 22k. I mainly sleep on my back, weigh about 75 kg. No major back issues but the moming stiffness is definitely there.

Did some research and the terms thrown around are overwhelming Orthopedic support, sleep zones, pressure relief, spinal alignment. Went to a store and tested some including Dutopedic and a few others. They all felt comfortable for 5 minutes which tells me nothing.

Has anyone had similar experience where mattress change actually improved sleep quality noticeably? Not just 'yeah it's comfortable but actually waking up feeling rested? That's what I need.",1,1769717324.0,SleepEssentialsIndia,0,1.0,False
1qqjikp,https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernDatingDoneRight/comments/1qqjikp/the_psychology_of_commanding_respect_10/,The Psychology of Commanding Respect: 10 Science-Backed Tricks That Actually Work,"Most people think respect is something you earn through years of grinding or titles on a business card. That's partially true, but there's a deeper layer most miss. After diving into social psychology research, communication theory, and observing actual high-status individuals (not the fake LinkedIn guru types), I realized respect isn't mystical. It's behavioral patterns anyone can learn.

The truth is, society conditions us to seek validation externally while our biology craves hierarchical positioning. This creates anxiety around social dynamics. But here's what's liberating: these patterns are learnable skills, not genetic lottery wins. I spent months testing these in professional settings, social gatherings, even mundane interactions at coffee shops. They work because they tap into how human perception actually operates.

**1. Master the pause before responding**

High-value people don't react instantly. They process. When someone asks you something, especially challenging questions, take 2-3 seconds before answering. This isn't about playing games, it signals thoughtfulness and control. Research from conversation analysis shows pauses convey confidence because you're not desperately filling silence.

I tested this during client meetings. Instead of blurting responses, I'd pause, sometimes even saying ""let me think about that properly."" Clients started treating my input as more valuable. The pause created weight.

**2. Reduce apologetic language by 80%**

Stop saying sorry for existing. ""Sorry to bother you,"" ""Sorry, quick question,"" ""Apologies if this is stupid."" Each unnecessary apology chips away at perceived authority. Linguist Robin Lakoff's research on language and power shows excessive hedging diminishes credibility.

Replace apologies with neutral statements. Instead of ""Sorry to interrupt,"" try ""Quick thought on this."" Instead of ""Sorry this took long,"" say ""Thanks for your patience."" You're not being rude, you're being direct.

**3. Use strategic eye contact, not constant staring**

Contrary to alpha male nonsense online, constant eye contact feels aggressive and weird. Social psychologist Michael Argyle found the sweet spot: maintain eye contact 60-70% while listening, 30-40% while speaking. This mirrors natural confident behavior.

When making important points, lock eyes. When listening, show engagement through eye contact but break occasionally to process. This rhythm feels natural and commands attention without intimidation.

**4. Occupy space intentionally**

Spatial behavior communicates status whether we like it or not. Amy Cuddy's research at Harvard (despite controversy around power posing's internal effects) confirmed external perceptions shift based on how you use space.

Don't make yourself small. In meetings, spread materials slightly. While standing, adopt a stable stance rather than shifting weight. This isn't about being obnoxious, it's about existing unapologetically in physical space. People subconsciously register this as confidence.

**5. Lower vocal register and slow speech pace**

Higher pitched, rapid speech signals anxiety. Research published in the Journal of Voice shows lower frequencies are associated with leadership and trustworthiness. You don't need a Barry White voice, just speak from your chest rather than throat.

Slow down by 20%. Fast talking suggests nervousness or trying to convince. Measured speech implies your words have weight. I started recording myself and was shocked how rushed I sounded. Slowing down felt weird initially but changed how people received my input.

**6. Ask fewer questions, make more statements**

Insecure people seek constant validation through questions. ""Does that make sense?"" ""Is that okay?"" ""What do you think?"" These aren't inherently bad but excessive use signals uncertainty.

Turn questions into statements. Instead of ""Should we maybe try this approach?"" say ""This approach would solve X problem."" You're not being autocratic, you're taking a position. The Charisma Myth by Olivia Fox Cabane (communication expert who coached executives at Stanford, insanely good insights on presence) emphasizes how declarative language builds gravitas. She breaks down exactly how subtle linguistic shifts change group dynamics. Essential read if you want to understand conversational power.

**7. Control reaction intensity**

Overreacting to everything, positive or negative, makes you seem unstable. Measured responses signal emotional regulation. When something great happens, smile and acknowledge it. When something frustrating occurs, pause before responding.

This doesn't mean being robotic. Show genuine emotion but don't swing wildly. People respect stability. They want to know what version of you they're getting.

**8. Enter rooms like you're supposed to be there**

Hesitant entries broadcast insecurity. Whether it's a party, meeting, or networking event, walk in with purpose. Make eye contact, slight nod of acknowledgment, find your position.

For those looking to go deeper on presence and communication patterns, BeFreed is worth checking out. It's a personalized learning app built by former Google engineers that pulls from expert talks, communication research, and psychology books to create custom audio lessons. You can set specific goals like ""command respect in professional settings"" or ""improve leadership presence as an introvert,"" and it generates a structured learning plan with lessons you can customize from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives.

The voice options are surprisingly addictive, ranging from calm and authoritative to energetic coaching styles. It also connects insights from books like The Charisma Myth and Influence with practical communication research, so you're getting science-backed strategies without having to read dozens of books. Makes the whole self-improvement process way more structured and easier to stick with during commutes or gym sessions.

**9. Give compliments sparingly and specifically**

Constant praise reduces its value. When you do compliment, make it specific and observational. ""I noticed how you handled that client's objection, that was smooth"" beats ""You're so good at sales!""

Specific compliments show you're actually paying attention rather than throwing generic flattery. Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion by Robert Cialdini (renowned psychologist, his work is cited in thousands of studies, genuinely changed how I understand human behavior) explains how specificity increases perceived sincerity. This book will make you question every interaction you've had. Best behavioral psychology book I've encountered.

**10. Maintain consistency across contexts**

People respect those who don't shapeshift depending on who's in the room. Being authentic doesn't mean oversharing, it means your core demeanor stays consistent whether you're talking to the intern or the CEO.

Code switching for different audiences is natural to some degree, but if your entire personality changes based on perceived status of who you're addressing, people notice and lose respect.

Here's the thing about all this: these aren't manipulation tactics, they're alignment tools. You're aligning external behavior with internal worth. Most people already deserve respect but telegraph insecurity through micro-behaviors that undermine them.

The gap between who you are and how you're perceived shrinks when you master these patterns. Start with two or three that resonate most. Build them into natural behavior over months. Respect follows competence and presence, both of which are entirely learnable.",1,1769717312.0,ModernDatingDoneRight,0,1.0,False

I'm a 19 year old girl who has always preferred my own company to crowds. Loud places make me tense, small talk feels exhausting, and I need a lot of time alone to feel like myself again. I've accepted that about me, and now I'm looking for someone who doesn't see it as something that needs fixing.

I spend most of my days in soft routines that keep me calm. Reading novels until late at night, listening to lo-fi playlists while staring at the ceiling, journaling random thoughts, or walking alone in quiet parks when the sun is setting and there aren't many people around. I like the feeling of being small in a big world sometimes. I'm studying graphic design online, so a lot of my time is spent at my desk with headphones on, sketching or editing photos in peace.

Physically I'm on the shorter side, long straight hair I usually keep down or in a messy bun, pale skin, and I almost always wear comfortable oversized clothes because they make me feel hidden and safe. I don't do a lot of makeup or dressing up unless I have to. I like when things are gentle and low-pressure.

What I'm hoping for is another introvert, or at least someone who truly understands and respects introversion. Someone around my age or maybe a couple years older who doesn't mind long stretches of comfortable silence. Who would be happy with dates that are just us sitting together with coffee and books, or driving somewhere quiet at night with the windows down and no need to fill every second with conversation. I want to share little things without feeling rushed: sending a photo of the moon, recommending a song that matches how the rain sounds, or just lying next to each other on a blanket watching clouds without saying much.

I'm not good at being outgoing or flirty right away. It takes me time to open up, and I overthink messages a lot before I send them. If we talk, I might go quiet for a day or two while I recharge, but it doesn't mean I'm not interested. It just means I need space sometimes. If you're patient with that and you value the same kind of calm connection, that would mean a lot.

In your message, maybe tell me what your favorite quiet activity is, or a place you like to go when you need to be alone. Or just say hi if this post feels like it could be describing you too. No pressure for anything long or impressive. Just something honest.

If you're looking for someone bubbly and always on the go, I probably won't be the right fit. But if you've ever wished for a partner who can just exist with you in the quiet without needing constant excitement, I'd really like to hear from you.",1,1769717147.0,IntrovertDating,2,1.0,False

I engaged in disordered eating from 18-45 (bulimia, extreme calorie restriction etc). I have been a regular alcohol drinker for 25 years with multiple periods of abstinence ranging from 3-9 months. Basically done a lot of damage to my body with extremes of all sorts. My spouse (M58) is a T1D who has always been quite fit. Strict carnivore has been amazing the last couple years in significantly reducing his insulin requirements and keeping his blood sugars stable in the 80-110 range. Carnivore has also been awesome for me in quieting the ""food noise"" and giving me a longer term outlook at my health - basically getting off the up and down roller coaster of calorie restriction followed by regaining. The one very positive thing I can say about my weight for the last year is it has been very stable. 

I love this WOE, I never get tired of beef and butter. We eat pretty simple, make all our own meals and in the last year, there are probably 10-12 days that we went off plan for a social event or vacation. Even then, we stayed away from  standard ""junk food"" like chips, sugary items, etc. 

I get that I need to be patient and not expect the ""results"" that come from a crash diet. It was really discouraging to me the first few months to not see the scale move at all- I weight 245 lbs, but I kept telling myself (and my husband would remind me) that I need to heal from all the years of food abuse I heaped on myself. But it's been a year and my weight has not changed at all. I've been within 5 lbs of 245 the entire time. I exercise 5-6 days a week for 30-90 minutes. I get a variety of exercise in; weight training, cardio, HIIT etc. I drink only water and black coffee (I know coffee isn't carnivore- but it's not making me hang onto and extra 100 lbs). I'm getting discouraged. I get plenty of sleep, 7-8 hours. 

 I read a post in here yesterday that said something along the lines of ""if you significantly reduce your fat intake, your body will start using your stored fat quickly"". My husband has encouraged me to increase my fat intake the last few months, and I've added an ounce or two of butter in the evenings before bed. I'm not gaming any weight, but I am certainly not losing. If we were talking about a few extra lbs, I'd be joking just living with it for a bit longer. But this is an unhealthy amount of body fat to be carrying.

1qqjds6,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1qqjds6/court_mandated_ect_after_i_complained_about_er/,Court mandated ECT after I complained about ER Drs medical error,"Location: Canada 

Over the summer I was punched in the head by another patient while at my hospital's psych emergency room for mental health. 

They quickly had me move to a different facility and another part of town, where they messed up my meds putting me into a full-blown psychosis. No post care was applied after I was punched. When I called the police to report the assault my phone was taken and I was put into isolation. Isolation lasted about a month. It was incredibly traumatizing. 

I finally got stabilized on my right meds and felt well enough to return to work. I've been on the same dose of medications for 16 years and it's worked wonderfully well for me. Unfortunately, work stressors and a crisis in my family caused me to have another lapse in my mental health, not psychosis but just stress. 

I return to the hospital where I got punched because it's local and is where my outpatient psychiatrist treats me, and this time the emergency doctor was incredibly rude. 

Part of the medications that I take include showing involuntary mouth movements, which she interpreted as me being on drugs. When I explained it was my medications and that I needed it that night too, she surreptitiously slipped me an antipsychotic that I have a strong adverse reaction to. This made me look much more unwell than I was and I was sent to observation again. 

By the time things got sorted out. I went to file a complaint because I can't take those kinds of medications without severe side effects. And had I known, I would not have consented.

It felt like the doctor and my current doctor were colluding on a narrative that would protect her career but ruin my life, that I was in full-blown manic psychosis and would never be able to live on my own again. 

This is just not true. I came in because I was stressed about an Oxford deadline and a work crisis and a family issue that all happened at the same moment. I was not manic I was not psychotic, I just desperately needed anxiety medications. 

After I filed the report, I also mentioned the punching that happened to the client relations representative. Immediately after I told her this she left the room clearly disturbed and the next thing I knew all of my passes to leave the ward were revoked. 

It was clear they were doing some sort of internal investigation, because I felt fine as soon as they gave me an anti-anxiety and felt ready to return to work. But for some reason they couldn't let me go and they couldn't give me a reason for why they couldn't let me go. That was one of the narrative that I was full-blown psychotic was put out amongst the staff and I was put on high alert. So anything I did wrong what would go into my chart. They would even make up situations, like a fake search for contraband where they removed a keychain from my locker.

During the holidays the emergency doctor took over for my regular doctor and use the opportunity to drug me, knowing that I would complain to the staff that I felt drugged. When I did she flew into a rage claiming that I never been drugged that it didn't happen and that she was going to call my regular psychiatrist who would have her back. 

That same night she took advantage of my parents visiting at the hospital to push through two forms that prevented me from making my own decisions and prevented me from staying on a voluntary basis. 

It was clear retaliation for me challenging her and asking about the drugs that she had slipped in my coffee that morning. 

After that they pretty much had a free pass to use whatever medications they wanted, including overtly administering antipsychotics that would make me look more psychotic than I actually was. It's weird how that works but it's true. 

I went to court to try to regain my autonomy, but the staff had done such a good job of assassinating my character and papering my records that there was very little chance I would actually win. I think the whole thing was rigged weeks ago even though I gave my testimony yesterday. 

My doctor is now saying it is essential that I add more antipsychotics to my medication and undergo ECT. I feel like this is so I will forget what happened and will be unable to challenge them in court. Should I pursue a lawsuit. 

The court appointed lawyer bailed on me after I sent him my notes about the history of assault at the hospital and I'm fairly certain he sold it to the hospital lawyers because the email thread was locked and sent to three other people. I couldn't open it to read my own defense. 

I also know there's fraudulent documents like when my parents came up to visit. They claim the right's advisor spoke to me about my right to appeal my capacity, but that just did not happen. I know they have many more examples of fraudulent documents being accepted by the courts. 

I obviously lost the hearing because the lawyer who sold me out was replaced with an individual who didn't know me at all and asked really weak questions of my doctor. 

I feel like I'm on death row when all I came in was for a couple night's sleep and some anti-anxieties. I maintain. It was the initial mistake of the ER doctor and slipping me antipsychotics while telling me they were just sleep aids, that started this whole thing 2 months ago. 

I know the hospital has flown into protection mode and it's easiest to paint me as psychotic to justify the length of time I've spent here, will they do their own internal investigations and Shore up their lines. 

They claim they've only been giving me my regular meds and anti-anxieties. But I know that's not true because I recognize the symptoms of atypical antipsychotics. 

Long story short, I lost The hearing despite being totally stable and lucid and explaining my side of things. But it was rigged from the beginning. I'm 100% sure that my lawyer sold out my defense notes to the hospital because he dropped out of representing me minutes before the meeting started. I was given a random lawyer who had never spoken with before to represent me. I wasn't able to give my testimony until the very end, but it seems like the capacity board had already made their decision based on the fraudulent information provided to them. 

Now that I've been found legally and capable, they're able to force treatment like ECT along with antipsychotics, just because they hate me. I've tried to be nice and get along with the staff, but they know that this is a sensitive situation and bordering lawsuit territory so I've been treated terribly as well. 

I'm terrified they're going to enforce ECT on me which will decimate my brain and make any possible chance of me returning to work nearly impossible. I already feel the cognitive effects of them increasing the medication I've been taking for 16 years. I feel myself getting dumber. I don't think ECT will help. 

Are there any legal options available to me at this point, when the hospitals are using fraudulent documents and there's no one second-guessing them? The lawyer that showed up for me yesterday only emailed me to say that I'd lost, and when I called him earlier he was annoyed at me for interrupting him while he was at court. So I don't think he's interested in helping me work towards an appeal. 

I feel like an idiot because the first legal aid lawyer they assigned to me was the best in the province. But I let my paranoia get the best of me and I canceled them an hour before. I have huge regrets over this. I might be home safe and on my regular meds if I had panicked and canceled them. 

Does the court have the ability to actually force ECT on some one unwillingly? I've been in bipolarmania before but I'm totally stable right now. 

They just need to have it on paper that I'm not well that I'm seriously ill to justify such an invasive treatment. This can't be legal, but the hospital legal team has been one step ahead of me the entire time. I've been taking notes. But what good are the notes when you're going up against doctors and lawyers? 

Any advice or help or support would be very appreciated! And if anyone has experience with ECT please feel free to share. I feel totally normal and this is terrifying me that they want to fry my brain just to suppress my ability to fight them legally.",0,1769717025.0,legaladvice,0,0.5,False

1qqjcqj,https://www.reddit.com/r/PataHaiAajKyaHua/comments/1qqjcqj/i_spent_a_year_pretending_not_to_love_her_and_now/,"I spent a year pretending not to love her, and now I'd give anything to have that year back","I need to tell this story before it eats me alive. What we had, I don’t even know if I can call it a relationship. We never made it official. But it was the most real thing I’ve ever felt.

It started on a random Tuesday. I was walking through the main corridor, completely lost in my own head, when I heard someone behind me say, “Excuse me?”

I turned around and there she was. I’d seen her around campus before. She was a year below me. One of those people who naturally draw your attention. Not because they try to, but because there’s something warm and genuine about them.

She asked me if I could help her find the library.

My mind went blank. This beautiful girl was standing right in front of me and I couldn’t form a single clear thought. My face felt hot. My palms started sweating. Somehow I managed to give her directions while trying to sound normal, even though my heart was pounding like it wanted to escape my chest.

She thanked me and started walking away. Then she stopped, turned back, and smiled.

Not a casual smile. The kind that reaches your eyes. The kind that makes you feel noticed. I stood there in that hallway long after she disappeared, trying to understand what had just happened.

After that, we kept running into each other. In the library. In the cafeteria. Outside lecture halls. At first I thought it was coincidence, but the universe doesn’t try that hard by accident.

We started talking. About classes, professors, the terrible coffee. Small things. But those conversations became the best part of my day. I started taking longer routes to class just in case I might see her.

One evening we were sitting on a bench outside the arts building, watching the sun set over campus. She turned to me, nervous but determined, and said she needed to tell me something. She said she liked me. She really liked me.

Everything stopped.

I should have told her right then that I felt the same. That I’d been thinking about her since that first smile in the hallway. That when I closed my eyes at night, I saw her face.

But I didn’t.

Instead, a stupid voice in my head told me that if I showed how much I cared, she’d lose interest. So I played it cool. I said something casual, something meaningless. I saw something change in her eyes. Maybe hope. Maybe doubt.

That’s when I started building walls.

When she called, I’d stare at her name on my screen. My finger hovering over the answer button. Every part of me wanted to pick up. To hear her voice. To disappear into those conversations that made time feel irrelevant.

But I let it ring. Then I’d spend the next hour hating myself.

Her texts came through. Sometimes just a hello. Sometimes a meme. Sometimes a message saying she was thinking about me. I’d read them instantly. Type replies. Delete them. Rewrite them. And then not send anything for hours. Sometimes days.

I convinced myself that being distant would make her want me more.

The truth was I was drowning in her. She was the first thought when I woke up and the last one before sleep. I drifted off in lectures imagining conversations we’d never have. I wrote her name in my notebook margins without noticing.

She tried so hard to make us happen.

Every week she sent me screenshots of places she found. Cafes. Bookstores. Parks where you could watch the sunset. She’d say we should go together.

Inside, I was screaming yes. I imagined walking beside her, sitting across from her, finally learning everything about her. Her childhood. Her dreams. What made her laugh late at night.

And then the weekend would come and I’d cancel.

Family stuff. Projects. Not feeling well. Excuse after excuse. All lies.

I’d spend those weekends alone, scrolling through her social media, wondering what she was doing, hating myself for choosing fear over her.

We did go out sometimes. Rarely. Maybe once a month. On those days, everything felt intense and fragile.

I remember one afternoon at a cafe she’d suggested forever ago. She wore a light blue dress and sunlight caught it perfectly. When she laughed, I forgot how to breathe. She looked at me like she was trying to read all the things I refused to say.

And I looked away.

I stared at the menu. Checked my phone. Watched the street outside. Anything to avoid her eyes, because I knew if I held her gaze too long, I’d fall apart.

Our hands would be close on the table. Inches apart. I felt the electricity between us.

It would have been so easy to reach out.

I never did.

I went home and replayed everything, imagining versions of myself who were braver. Versions where I held her hand. Kissed her. Told her the truth.

The regret crushed me.

As months passed, my feelings consumed me. She wasn’t just someone I liked anymore. She became everything.

I started drinking coffee because she loved it. I read poetry trying to find words for what I felt. She existed in every song and every quiet moment.

And so did fear.

What if she realized she could do better? What if she really saw me and decided I wasn’t enough?

The closer I felt, the more terrified I became of losing her. I convinced myself that losing her would destroy me.

So I destroyed it first.

I pulled away completely. Left her on read. Ignored her calls. I could feel her confusion and hurt through the silence, but I told myself it was necessary.

She asked to meet. I knew she wanted answers. I couldn’t face her.

So I sent a text. A cold, generic message about focusing on my career and not being ready. Then I blocked her everywhere.

For a week, I felt lighter. The anxiety was gone. I didn’t have to worry about losing her anymore.

Because I already had.

Then the absence hit. I’d see something funny and reach for my phone. Hear a song and feel my chest tighten. Pass a cafe and feel hollow.

It’s been three months now and I’m drowning.

This isn’t sharp heartbreak. It’s a quiet ache that never leaves. I wake up expecting her messages. I dream about her smile and wake up crying.

I miss her voice. Her excitement over small things. How safe I felt with her even while pretending I didn’t care.

I miss who I could have been if I’d let myself be brave.

I thought distance would protect me. Instead, it taught me that the pain comes either way. The only difference is whether you live with love or regret.

She was brave. I wasn’t.

If you have someone who makes the world feel brighter, don’t play games. Don’t calculate. Don’t protect yourself out of something beautiful.

Say yes. Show up. Be vulnerable.

Because the regret of not trying is far worse than the fear of getting hurt.

I’d give anything to go back and tell her the truth. But I can’t.

All I can do is hope she’s loved the way she deserves now. That someone answers her calls. Shows up. Isn’t afraid.

I hope he’s everything I was too scared to be.        (((((((((((((((((((""Pata hai aaj kya hua"")))))))",1,1769716961.0,PataHaiAajKyaHua,1,1.0,False

At first I got some whiplash as the insta he gave him was a verified account with thousands of followers but sure enough I got a message and follow back instantly.

We chatted for a while and i showed him some of my other pics and talked about myself to which he responded by calling me extremely handsome and interesting and saying he’d love to meet up. We soon arranged a date.

When the day came he ran up to me and hugged me with major excitement, which was a bit weird but I shrugged it off. We then went on a little date, had some coffee and did some small talk, he was overall very pleasant but not too interesting to be completely honest. He then however kept insisting on “how hot it is today” and that we should go to his apartment as he has ac. As he was so nice and didnt really make any sexual remarks during the date i decided to agree even though i knew where that was heading obviously lol.

Anyways we go to his apartment and as soon as the elevator door closes he decides to immediately kiss me and make out with me which definitely was… something, but we soon went into his apartment where we did the horizontal tango and the experience was honestly far from ideal.

After we finish i decide to leave as he had errands to do and just as i try to step out of the door he grabs me and starts passionately making out with me, then tells me goodbye and as i try to leave he says “wait!” And kisses me AGAIN for like half a minute before i leave.

Anyways i return home send him a text that im home safe and apologising if i seemed a bit low energy that day as i was tired. No response. Send him a reel the next morning and ive been left on “sent” since. Also i found out he gave me an STI…

After talking about it with my friends apparently he is a well known musician and he completely BLEW up last couple weeks and i keep seeing him constantly in interviews and his song is playing everywhere in my small little country and literally everyone knows who he is, which feels bad as people are always like “oh he looks SO pleasant and sweet” not knowing that hes an asshole lol.

ROVER SITTER WARNING

I hired Anita L. to watch my dog from 12/22/25-1/1/26 and it was a HORRIBLE experience. 

On Christmas Day, my next door neighbor informed me that she was screaming profanities at my dog. This continued for 3 more days with an additional 2 other neighbors (3 in total) informing me they had seen her screaming at and hitting my dog. After confronting her via phone call, she admitted to verbally abusing my dog and “guaranteed it would not happen again.” As I was out of state with no other options for sitters for my reactive dog, I had to continue the booking. 

Upon returning, my dog had multiple scratches and scrapes across his body. He also acted terrified when I came home - something extremely abnormal for him which alerts me that he was being abused the entire time. 

In addition, I discovered upon my return that Anita had DESTROYED my apartment. She had spilled coffee over the entire sofa and throw pillows, wore my UGG shoes without asking and destroyed them, left broken glass on the floor, broke cups without alerting us, and so much more. 

When I booked her, she was rated 4.9 stars with 68 reviews. PLEASE DO NOT FALL FOR IT LIKE I DID! Anita is NOT a safe person in your home or with your animals. Her full name is Anita Lengowicz.",40,1769716516.0,NYCbitcheswithtaste,7,0.95,False

Your body doesn't forget.

Every stressful meeting, every Sunday night dread, every working lunch, every skipped workout, every night of poor sleep because your brain wouldn't stop running—it's all logged somewhere.

For men over 40 who've spent decades in corporate environments, that ledger is coming due. The bill shows up as chronic fatigue, persistent pain, expanding waistlines, foggy thinking, and a general sense that something fundamental has broken.

Most men blame aging. It's easier than confronting the truth: the career they built is systematically dismantling the body and mind they need to enjoy it.

**The Burnout Blueprint**

[Corporate burnout follows a predictable pattern in men over 40.](https://johnspencerellis.com)

First, the energy goes. Not all at once—gradually. You need more coffee to start. More willpower to push through afternoons. More recovery time after normal weeks. The reserves that once felt unlimited quietly drain away.

Then the body changes. Weight appears around your midsection regardless of what you eat. Muscle mass decreases even if you occasionally exercise. Your face looks tired. Your posture slumps. You look in the mirror and see someone older than your years.

Pain becomes constant background noise. Lower back tightness. Neck and shoulder tension. Knees that ache after sitting too long. You've forgotten what it feels like to wake up without something hurting.

Mental sharpness erodes. The quick thinking that built your career becomes sluggish. You lose words mid-sentence. Complex problems feel overwhelming. Focus requires enormous effort that used to be automatic.

Motivation flatlines. Things that once excited you feel meaningless. You're going through motions professionally and personally. The spark that drove you has quietly died.

**What's Actually Happening**

This isn't random deterioration. There's a biological mechanism driving it.

Chronic stress keeps cortisol—your primary stress hormone—elevated for years. This creates cascading dysfunction throughout your system.

High cortisol disrupts sleep architecture, preventing the deep rest where repair happens. It promotes visceral fat storage, particularly around your midsection. It impairs cognitive function and memory consolidation. And critically, it suppresses testosterone production.

Low testosterone then compounds everything. Less muscle mass. More fat. Lower energy. Reduced motivation. Cognitive decline. Mood instability. Each symptom feeds back into more stress, more cortisol, less testosterone.

Meanwhile, years of desk work have created structural problems. Hip flexors tighten. Core muscles weaken. Upper back rounds. The postural dysfunction creates chronic pain patterns that further disrupt sleep and add to stress load.

It's not one problem. It's an interconnected system of problems, each one making the others worse.

**The Way Out**

Reversing this pattern requires addressing it as a system rather than chasing individual symptoms.

Lifestyle restructuring creates the foundation. The chronic stress driving hormonal dysfunction needs addressing at its source. For some men, this means setting firmer boundaries. For others, it means delegation or role changes. For some, it means escaping corporate entirely for simpler work arrangements. Without reducing stress load, other interventions get overwhelmed.

Hormone assessment provides clarity. Comprehensive testing reveals what's actually happening biochemically rather than guessing. Many men discover their testosterone levels are significantly below optimal—explaining symptoms they'd attributed to character flaws or inevitable aging. Knowledge enables informed decisions about intervention options.

Physical restoration rebuilds the structure. Strategic resistance training preserves and rebuilds muscle mass while supporting hormone production. Corrective exercise addresses postural dysfunction and pain patterns. Movement becomes medicine rather than another stressor—when programmed correctly for a 40+ body.

Sleep optimization accelerates everything. Quality sleep is when testosterone is produced, when the brain clears waste, when tissues repair. Most burned-out men have severely compromised sleep without realizing it. Fixing sleep often produces the most immediate improvements in energy and clarity.

Mental wellness receives direct attention. Brain fog, emotional flatness, and cognitive decline respond to intervention—but only when treated as legitimate concerns rather than afterthoughts. Stress management practices, cognitive training, and sometimes professional support become essential components.

**Integrated Approach**

This systems-based approach to men's health is central to how coach John Spencer Ellis works with burned-out professionals.

His coaching addresses career sustainability, physical restoration, hormonal awareness, mental wellness, and lifestyle simplification as interconnected elements of one recovery process. Rather than generic protocols, he develops customized strategies based on each man's specific situation, constraints, and goals.

For men recognizing themselves in this pattern—functioning but deteriorating, successful but depleted—his framework offers a structured path forward.

Sometimes understanding the problem clearly is the first step toward solving it.

I’m originally from Istanbul, Türkiye, and navigating life in a new country has been both exciting and challenging. I’m naturally more on the introverted side, but I genuinely enjoy meaningful conversations and building real connections, not just “activity partners.”

I’m really into fitness and the gym, so if you’re down for a workout session, a walk around Schlossplatz, or just grabbing a coffee after training, that’s already a win. I also love music — especially Rock and alternative (Linkin Park, Evanescence, indie stuff), and I’m always open to sharing playlists or checking out local spots with good vibes.

I enjoy talking about bigger topics too — life in Germany as a student/immigrant, future goals, engineering, travel, or just random deep conversations that go way beyond small talk. I also spent a year in Szeged, Hungary, during my Erasmus, which really shaped how I see life abroad — and I love hearing other people’s stories about how they ended up here.

Whether you’re a local, a student, or another expat trying to figure things out in Stuttgart, feel free to comment or send a DM. I speak English and Turkish fluently, and I’m currently learning German (A2/B1 level — always happy to practice 😄).

If any of this resonates with you, let’s grab a coffee or explore the city together!

Jeddah, 2 September 1879

To the Esteemed Sanitary Administration of the Ottoman Empire, Constantinople.

“Gentlemen, I have the honor to inform you of the results of the mission I carried out in the depths of the Asir region, with the aim of verifying the nature of an alleged outbreak of an epidemic there and implementing the necessary sanitary measures.

After disembarking at Al-Qunfudhah on 3 August, I began my sanitary inspection by visiting the sick; I found only a few cases of dysentery or fever. In order to ascertain the historical sanitary condition of the country, I consulted notables, elders, and those who wash the dead, asking them whether they had ever seen corpses bearing ulcers or swellings in the groin, armpits, or neck, or whether they had heard from their forefathers of an epidemic with such characteristics. All answered in the negative. The population of Al-Qunfudhah is approximately 1,500 inhabitants, and only 22 natural deaths were recorded over a six-month period.

On 5 August, I took the road toward the territory of Bani Shahr, inspecting along the way the villages of Al-Qawz, Al-Habil, Fattah, and ‘Alam Mashi, whose inhabitants were all in perfect health.

On 10 August, I arrived at Al-Namas, the main center of the district of Bani Shahr. It consists of five villages: Al-Qaryah, Bani Bakr, Al-Qazman, Mawalid ‘Ali, and Al-Hiyyah.

Al-Namas is situated on a chain of lofty mountains extending between Sana’a and Taif. The ascent of the mountain took five hours on muleback; camels are unable to climb it because of its ruggedness, which has caused stagnation in trade. The climate is cold and humid, the soil extremely fertile, and the area contains springs of clear, non-stagnant water. The inhabitants cultivate crops solely for their own consumption.

The houses are built of fitted stone and consist of two stories: an upper floor for habitation, with narrow rooms often without windows, and a ground floor used as stables for livestock. Due to the severe cold, which in winter reaches the point where water freezes, the inhabitants are forced to live a harsh life.

The thermometer (Réaumur scale) recorded 16 degrees at midday and 12 degrees in the morning during August, giving an idea of the severity of the region’s winter.

The district governor (Qaimmaqam), named Sheikh Fayiq, aged fifty, an intelligent man and a native of Al-Namas, explained to me—after I informed him of the purpose of my mission—the past and present sanitary situation of the region.

He stated that every two or three years, over a period of thirty-five to forty years, an epidemic disease appears in certain villages of the district, without spreading beyond a distance of five or six hours. On one occasion only, the disease became severe and spread to several villages of the Bani Shahr district, leaving a large number of victims, on whose bodies swellings were observed in the groin (upper thigh), under the armpits, and on the neck, with or without black or red spots on the body.

In that year, the disease was brought to Al-Namas by a man named Ahmad, who used to travel from time to time to Halabah, a village located four hours from Al-Namas, to sell coffee, textiles, and other goods. He returned ill in the early days of March, suffering from swellings in the groin, and after a few days he died, followed one after another by his mother and his two young brothers, ‘Isa and ‘Umar, all of whom exhibited the same symptoms.

At that time, the disease also affected the Qaimmaqam himself, his son Nasir Effendi, aged seventeen, and several other individuals. Eight people died, and two recovered.

Only one of the patients presented glandular swellings (buboes) and petechial hemorrhages, accompanied by headache, intense fever, and insatiable thirst. The son suffered from delirium, ceased eating, and attacked and tore apart anything he encountered.

As for Sheikh Fayiq (the Qaimmaqam), he initially experienced chills lasting several hours, then lost consciousness and did not open his eyes again until the sixth day.

A soldier named Ahmad, aged twenty-three, fell ill with headache, burning fever, thirst, gastric disturbance, pains throughout the body, rashes, swelling in the right groin, and hallucinations; after twenty days, he recovered without any medication and without suppuration.

I visited and inspected on several occasions the six villages previously mentioned, recording deaths and recoveries among 68 men, 45 women, 50 boys, and 21 girls. The number of deaths reached 155, while the number of recoveries was 29 (6 men, 7 women, 11 boys, and 5 girls), out of a total population of 800 inhabitants.

According to the information provided to me, all these patients initially complained of general malaise, sometimes fever or chills followed by fever, severe or mild headache, burning thirst or none, loss of appetite, diarrhea, fainting spells, pain in the groin and throughout the body, with or without buboes, buboes showing red or black spots, hallucinations, delirium, and complete loss of consciousness for several days; however, none of them exhibited anthrax (charbons).

The inhabitants are well acquainted with this disease and explain it in the same way as our physicians do, including the characteristics of the hemorrhagic rashes.

“Halabi” or “Jari” is a small village located six hours from Al-Namas, with a population of 150. The houses are built in the same manner as those of Al-Namas. The disease suddenly broke out in the house of Sa‘id ibn Gharam, where two men died exhibiting the same symptoms mentioned above. This occurred in the early days of February.

The disease spread from house to house, and out of 150 inhabitants, 35 were infected; among them, 8 men and 6 women died. The rest survived from the beginning until the end of May, when the disease disappeared completely.

Desiring also to verify the sanitary condition of the villages neighboring the infected areas and likewise located on the mountain—namely Bani Mish, Fansumah, Farukh, ‘Alamiss, Baqirah, Al Zaynab, Sahirah, Makrabah, Bani Sarwahr, etc. I found that the general health there had never suffered from the epidemic in question during that year.

My aim was to inspect all the surrounding districts to form a sanitary circle around these villages, starting from Al-Qunfudhah (Confoudah) as a point of departure. I also descended into the valley and visited the villages located there, namely: Bariq, Mandar, Abu Shabab, Muhayil, Farad, Radah, Manjah, Mikri, Jaritel, Fawkilah, and Ariyah,(1) where I found an excellent and ideal general state of health, to the extent that ordinary diseases were rare.”",2,1769716127.0,ottomans,0,1.0,False
1qqiyir,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qqiyir,Help me make my grayish wood floor new apartment feel like home!,"Living room:

With regard to space in my living room/dining room/kitchen: The living room portion is 136x144 inches. I was thinking of floating the Oliver sofa from west elm from the back so that I could fit a small desk in the back corner, have a 6x9 or 8x10 rug (I do want to cover the gray wood), a coffee table facing a 65” TV with a wide media console, with a bookshelf in the left corner and a standing mirror in the right corner. I’d like to put an accent chair on the left side of the coffee table to use near the bookshelf and two smaller accent chairs on the right side, since it’s a smaller sofa and I like to host. But I’m not sure if that’s too much to ask for in this space…

Bedroom:

It’s 10’3 by 10’6, with a large window on one side and a walk in closet opening on the other. I’ve got a queen bed (the nectar platform bed), but there’s no lighting so I’m going to need lamps. Is it okay to have one nightstand on one side and a standing lamp on the other? Can I fit anything else with the flow or will this start to get too cluttered? I don’t know how to make sure of the wall at the foot of the bed if at all.

Rugs:

How can I best address this type of gray wood flooring? What color rugs? Any examples?",1,1769716105.0,interiordecorating,0,1.0,False
1qqix4e,https://i.redd.it/lw81u4q6ecgg1.png,The Twin Who Steals All the Good Alphas,"Looking at the four men in front of me, I knew I was about to break another record. 30 matching meetings, 116 Alphas, and... yep, that's 120 now. Thinking about how my mom's tens of thousands in annual membership fees were all going down the drain, I actually felt bad for her. Katarina, my matchmaker, gestured to the man on the end. ""This is Harrison, he is one of the Vice Presidents of Meridian Trust Bank."" She looked at me. ""Do you have any questions?"" ""Katarina sent you my file, correct?"" I took a sip of coffee, set it down, and looked up at the four men in front of me. Honestly, I couldn't tell them apart at all - dark suits, neat haircuts, and those cookie-cutter elite smiles. ""She did, yes."" What was the name of the guy sitting in the middle again? Gary? Or maybe Grayden? Whatever. I kept smiling: ""What's my middle name?"" ""May."" Ding. The other three quickly closed their eyes, and one guy muttered ""fuck"" under his breath. He went pale, realizing what he'd done. I caught Katarina's smile frozen on her face, and my mother let out a long sigh. ""Nope,"" I said. ""That's my sister's middle name. Try again."" I knew I shouldn't say what came next, but I'd had enough. Honestly, even if they were here thinking ""Liana's sister isn't bad either,"" they could at least flip through my file, right? I looked at them and smiled: ""I bet you won't get my birthday wrong, since it's the same day as my sister's. Right?"" I leaned back in my chair. ""And I bet you can name all of her movies in alphabetical order. But you do realize you're here for me and not her?"" ""Of course,"" the man sputtered, then tried to play it cool with a dismissive wave. ""I'm sorry, I got mixed up. Of course, I know your middle name. I..."" He frantically made eye contact with the guys next to him. One of the men quickly jumped in: ""Elyse, right? We know everything in the file. We all do."" I really wanted to whip out my iPhone and capture their current state. ""Very good. Now, what do I do for a living?"" All four of them stared back at me blankly, like I'd just zapped them into clothing store mannequins. ""No one? That's too bad."" I spread my hands in mock disappointment. ""I thought you knew everything about me."" ""I think we're done here,"" Katarina said, her voice a full octave higher than normal. ""Gentlemen, thank you so much for coming. The agency will be in touch."" ""Toodaloo,"" I waved as they filed out. Katarina closed the door behind them as my mother's butler Arnold saw them to the front door. ""That didn't even take half as long as normal."" ""Lyrix."" My mother sighed again, rubbing her forehead. I was giving her another headache. I stood, pushing off the couch, unable to sit still anymore. ""Let's talk about this."" ""What is there to talk about?"" I turned to look at her, the smile disappearing from my face. ""They don't want me, Mom."" I quickly swallowed back the emotion in those words. ""You could have given them a chance."" ""For what? To illustrate how thoroughly they expect me to be a clone of Liana?"" She floundered - this obvious fact was something we both knew all too well. ""Your sister's details are very well known, and he was nervous. He probably just needed some more time without you treating him like a hostile enemy."" ""Yeah,"" I said with a sigh. ""I'm sure that's it."" That wasn't it. It wasn't even fucking close. Because being the twin sister to the biggest Omega movie star on the planet came with certain drawbacks, like everyone expecting you to be exactly alike. I loved my sister, and she wanted me to be happy, too. But now that she'd found her pack and was happily bonded, every Alpha who missed his 'chance' with Liana now thought I would be a good replacement. And for once in my life, I wanted someone to want me for me and not because of who I looked like. I knew why my mom was like this. She genuinely did want me to be happily bonded, but she had no clue how to make it happen. Walking over to my mother, I leaned down and kissed her cheek. ""Since I'm here I'll go for a run on the grounds, but I'll see you for lunch next week, okay?"" She managed to pull me into an awkward hug. ""Of course, sweetie. Call me."" ""I will."" I turned away before she could see the tears starting to mist my eyes. I wasn't Liana, and I couldn't ever be. Which probably meant I was going to be alone forever. My twin sister was pushing in the front door when I'd changed into my running clothes. ""Wait, where are you going? I know I'm late, but I wanted to watch some of the action."" I smiled, but it wasn't a good one. ""No action. They're already gone. I'm going for a run, but Mom's probably still in there."" Liana nodded and headed toward the living room. I stepped outside, then paused. I quietly walked to the door, just close enough to clearly hear the conversation inside. ""What happened?"" ""The men seemed..."" Mom paused, searching for words. ""Same as always. They weren't really here forLyrix—they were here for you."" ""These assholes need to realize I'm off the market. It's not fair to her."" ""She doesn't make it easy, Liana. These men are nervous, you're famous, so they fall back on what's familiar. ButLyrix could at least try to be nicer. No Alpha wants an Omega who'll tear him apart like that."" ""Lyrix is smart, beautiful, and talented,"" Liana said, frustration coloring her tone. ""She deserves someone who actually wants to know her, not someone who can't even remember her middle name."" Katarina cut in. ""But I'm running out of options for her to meet. She's getting a reputation. Plus those photos from your bonding ceremony...Lyrix is practically unmatchable."" Unmatchable.Her words hit like a slap. Enough. I slipped away from the door, my chest tight. Outside the gates, I could already hear the distant click of cameras - paparazzi waiting for Liana. At least that pack left before this turned into another tabloid story about me chasing away eligible men. I got up and followed the brick path to the main grounds. The estate was huge - perfect for hiding in the woods when everything became too much. Running, painting, mixing colors - these were the only times I could forget I was me. Forget this shitty life. Forget being alone all the damn time. Katarina was right. I was stuck beingLyrix Williams, Liana's discount twin sister. Nothing would change that. Whatever. Time to run. I grabbed my earbuds and took off. Chapter 2 LYRIX Yesterday's disaster made me want to hide away, but Liana clearly wasn't giving me that option. ""Listen."" She sat on the coffee table, identical face looking at me seriously. ""You have to come with me to this event, and looking fucking fabulous. I know you hate the press attention, but if they think you're happy and thriving they'll back off. People always want to read more about drama than happiness."" I looked at her with a miserable expression, but I could tell from her eyes that this time I had no choice but to go. ""I know you're trying to help me clear up those 'rumors,' whatever the hell Katarina was talking about yesterday."" Liana smacked my knee. ""I knew you were listening. The next time I see Mom alone I'm telling her to dump her ass."" I smirked. To the rest of the world, she was Liana May Williams, the darling sweetheart. Behind the scenes, she was as snarky as I was. In private, she was just as sharp-tongued as me. The door closed. ""Hello? I brought home pizza. Oh, hey,Lyrix."" I waved to Liam, one of Liana's Alphas. He had just set down a stack of pizza boxes when Liana launched herself into his arms. The air was instantly filled with Liana's rich pheromones. Scent-sympathetic they called it. A very clinical name for when scents were so compatible you just knew. It didn't always work, but this time it had. A year ago at the Designation Choice Awards, Liana met Mindless Delirium backstage and instantly started perfuming. After that they bonded and never separated. Their televised bonding ceremony was the event of the decade—and I was there, caught on camera looking like I'd do anything to be in her place. It was the footage Kat had mentioned. Whenever the press deigned to give me attention, it was usually those pictures or videos, with either a true, twisted, or entirely fabricated story about how I'd chased off yet another pack. Liana and Liam were practically making out now, her twisting up and around him like he was a tree and she was a vine. ""Get a room, please."" My sister just flipped me off and kissed him a little more before breaking away with a laugh. ""We have to get ready, anyway."" With that, she pulled me to the walk-in closet. She handed me a gold bodycon dress - thin straps, deep V-neck, pathetically short length that barely covered more than my butt. But when I put it on, I had to admit it looked amazing. The golden tone highlighted my skin and brought out the warmer colors in my hair. Even my eyes looked brighter. I leaned into the look of the dress, making my eyes dark and smoky with a hint of metallic gold at the inner corners. Just enough gloss on my lips to make people wonder what I'd been doing, and I ran some hairspray through with my fingers, attempting to corral the flyaways in my waves. Grabbing an overflowing jewelry box, I picked through the jewelry until I found some dangly gold earrings which matched. I walked out of the room, and the moment Liana saw me, her jaw nearly dropped: ""Holy shit,Lyrix. You're gorgeous!"" ""Don't be so dramatic."" I rolled my eyes at her and took the shoes she handed me. ""Remind me why I'm going to this party again?"" This was at the core of my problems with the packs who had come to court me. I wasn't Liana. I didn't love parties, preferring silence or my own music to rooms filled with pounding bass and people. I wasn't afraid of people, but most of the time they exhausted me. On the whole, I was built for a different life than this one. It wasn't anyone's fault. No one could have seen our lives turning out this way. But sometimes I wished I could simply disappear, if that wouldn't draw even more media attention and make life hell for Liana. ""Once photos of you in this dress get out, there'll definitely be packs begging to meet you."" Tugging on the shoes, I looked at her. ""What if I don't want packs knocking down my door? What if I just want what you have? To meet the right pack at the right time and for everything to be simple. I don't think that's going to happen with Katarina lining up every pack made up of suit-wearing Alphas."" ""It'll happen, Rix-rix. Promise."" I wished I could believe her. The ache which lodged itself in my chest yesterday hadn't really left, and I didn't think a party like this was going to help. But Liana was trying to do something for me, and I could help her by making her look wholesome by comparison. A win-win. Sort of. ""Okay, I think I'm ready,"" I said. ""Hold on,"" she said, holding out a little perfume roller. ""Scent canceller. These parties are a mess of everyone's scents, so if you need to clear your head..."" I raised my eyebrows. I'd never used this stuff before. She was right though - my Omega instincts going haywire in the middle of a party wouldn't help my rumors. ""I'll keep it with me."" ""Good."" The only other thing I had was my phone, and I shoved it in the little black clutch Liana tossed to me on our way out of the room. Her four Alphas were all in a line at the bottom of the stairs, waiting to see her off, and the whole room was suddenly a mess of their scents. ""I'll wait for you in the hall."" I stepped out the front door into the hallway which led only to the elevator, and Neil, Liana's head of security, laughed. ""I can smell the happiness from here."" ""Why do you think I'm not waiting in there?"" Scrolling on my phone, I was suddenly seeing the rumors Katarina had mentioned now that I was looking for them. Williams sister terrorizes more Alphas? A blurry looking photo of my family's estate and the guys from yesterday leaving. They wouldn't talk—Kat made everyone sign non-disclosure agreements tighter than a noose—but it was still frustrating. They had no proof it had gone badly, just a guess. Liana came out of her apartment beaming. ""Ready."" I closed the flashy news story before she could spot it on my phone. ""How's it looking tonight, Neil?"" ""About average. I'm expecting it to be much tighter at the venue. When we get there, straight from the car to the door, no questions."" The elevator dropped, my stomach whooshing in response. The cameras started flashing as soon as the elevator doors opened into the glassed-in lobby. Not nearly as many as there would be later. ""Smile on?"" Liana asked, looping her elbow through mine like all the times we'd done this before. I didn't have much of a choice, but I looked amazing, and if I was going to be dragged to this party anyway, I needed to get my head on straight and try to have some fun. ""Smile on."" Chapter 3 LYRIX This was insane. The horde of paparazzi outside nearly blinded us getting out of the car. They were behind barricades and there was plenty of security, but it still felt like being hit with a metric fuck ton of sound. They were all rapid-fire and toppling over one another, but I could still pick out all the questions. Lyrix, who's the latest victim? Which pack now has broken hearts? Are you in the closet? Do you need a female pack? Did the death of your father break you? Are you in therapy? Who helps with your heats? Do you share with Liana? My sister looped her arm through mine again, her smile now forced. ""Fucking assholes."" She said it without moving her lips. ""Apparently everyone's thinking the same thing, so I'm not sure they're out of line."" She rolled her eyes as soon as we were out of view. ""They're so fucking far out of line I'm going to have my lawyers rip them a new asshole. I get they have to ask about the relationship stuff, and it sucks. But they don't get to ask about dad or if you're in fucking therapy."" I swallowed and pulled her into a hug. Every day I missed Dad. And yes, I'd gone to therapy, though it was no one's business. But it hit Liana hard, too. He hadn't been gone long, and he hadn't been there to present her at her bonding ceremony. If—when—my time came, I was sure I would feel the same. I shoved down the emotions about Dad. ""Sorry,"" Liana muttered. ""It just pisses me off."" ""I know, and I appreciate it. But let's go do this party thing so we can get the hell out of here."" Liana laughed, quickly swiping under her eyes. ""Deal."" Neil pushed the button for the elevator, and we followed him inside. Liana added. ""These kinds of parties are actually pretty fun. You'll see in a bit. Now that I've finally dragged you to one you'll always want to come."" ""I highly doubt it."" But I had to admit, the doors of the elevator opening onto what looked like a mix between a circus and a nightclub might be able to change my mind. Deep red fabric draped from the ceiling, creating a tent. Black chandeliers dotted the space with actual candles flickering in them. The rest of the light came from roving spotlights and patterned beams in warm colors shifting over the tent itself. An aerial silk performer hung from the ceiling, twisting sensually in time with the music. In the corner I spotted an illusionist, and there was a person painting an elaborate golden mask on someone's face. Liana was right, the studio wasn't holding anything back for this party. There was an exit to the balcony overlooking downtown, and there were people everywhere. Music pulsed under my feet, at once melodic and rhythmic. It was loud enough so that it wasn't awkward, but I also didn't feel the need to beg for earplugs. ""There you are!"" Jasmine waved, pulling us deeper into the crowd. ""I was about to hunt you down."" ""A lot of paps,"" Liana said. ""And do me a favor? Tell the gossip magazines if they ever shout questions about our father or therapy, I'll make sure they never get another legal photo of us."" She raised her eyebrows. ""Got it."" Jasmine was Liana's manager. A Beta with gorgeous dark skin and even darker eyes, she was easily the most badass, competent person I'd ever met. I trusted her completely. ""Anything I should know?"" Jasmine took our clutches. ""Just mingle. Studio heads will want words later, but I'll pull you out when needed. The photographer wants shots of you two dancing."" ""Perfect,"" I said. ""When I dance I don't have to talk to people."" Jasmine laughed. ""If more people here had your attitude, there'd be fewer publicity messes."" Liana pulled me away and was immediately flagged down by Dante Norwood. A sweet Beta who somehow managed to drip Alpha energy on screen. ""Darling, you look beautiful."" He kissed Liana's cheeks before turning to me. ""AndLyrix, you look fucking fantastic."" ""Thank you."" ""I had to force her into that dress since Jasmine wouldn't let me wear it."" Liana pouted. Dante shook his head in mock pity. ""Whatever will Liana May Williams do without a ten thousand dollar dress?"" My head swung so fast I thought my neck would snap. ""This dress cost that much?"" She shrugged. ""Designer gift."" Christ. I had more money than I knew what to do with, but I wasn't walking around in clothes that cost ten grand. My stomach growled—I hadn't stolen any of Liam's pizza. ""Food?"" I asked Dante. ""Because I'm about to eat so much this thing will look like a maternity dress."" Dante threw his head back laughing. ""If that happens, come straight to me. Food's over there."" He gestured across the room. ""Thank you!"" I grabbed Liana's wrist. ""I should have stolen your pizza."" ""We both should have."" The table was nearly as long as the room itself, stuffed with mountains of crab puffs, charcuterie, hot comfort foods, and three different chocolate fountains surrounded by enough fruit for a grocery store. All at once, cake scent washed over me—like a bakery come to life. I groaned. ""Fuck, do you smell that? I need a cupcake."" Liana looked along the table. ""What cupcakes? There aren't any here."" ""Then I'm following my nose because now it's all I can think about."" Sweet vanilla frosting and yellow cake. The craving was so strong I'd eat gas station cupcakes to stop my stomach's rebellion. I pushed toward the front where the scent was strongest, Liana calling after me, until I crashed into someone. A man with a tattoo machine, working on another guy's wrist. Big green eyes, backwards baseball cap, looking as confused as I felt about my brake-line-cut collision. Right where the scent was strongest. But no baked goods. ""You are not a cupcake,"" I said. He smirked, standing. ""No, I'm not."" ""He may not be a cupcake, but he does have some serious cake,"" Liana said. I stared at her. ""He can hear you, Liana."" ""Holy shit! You're Kierran Frost!"" ""Guilty as charged."" The giant in front of me spoke in a voice which was somehow both deep and musical. He was tall and built like a wall, the dark t-shirt he wore doing absolutely nothing to disguise the kind of biceps. Holy. Fuck. It wasn't just his body which was gorgeous. The man fit perfectly into this room of movie stars and models. But I didn't recognize him, and I was at least halfway familiar with most of the people in Liana's circle. Who was he? My mind still seemed fuzzy, and I still couldn't seem to wrap my mind around why he was here and not the plate of carbs and sugar my nose had promised me. Quickly, I lifted my wrist to my nose to clear my head, and when I pulled it away the scent was still there. If anything it was stronger. My stomach flipped, suddenly realizing my mistake. It was him. The fucking cupcake scent was him. He was all Alpha, and I felt pulled toward him like a magnet. Oh shit. ",1,1769716017.0,getnovelsfree,0,1.0,False

I later hade some weird symbolic dream that o hade a big black butterfly tatto on me, like some sort of mark, my first thought is I don’t like tattoos, but it felt like a begging of something I don’t know, like a mark for a hard challenge of some sort

 I later saw 666 and could hear sirens 🚨 in my head, I thought it was weird, I remember I got a weird feeling from it, I was walking home a night and a police car was parked outside my apartment, a guy saw me and walked towards me, he looked around and saw the police car and went away, I was confused by the angel number and sirrens, I thought everything was alright, I meet a friend and we talked they told me to be careful about taking a drink from someone they can have put something in it, 2 days after that I was drinking some coffe, and a person sat next to me, I saw from the corner of my eye that did something over my coffe, I didn’t really think anything of it I was on my phone, I later took a sip and was more on my phone, then a friend came and he looked a little shocked when he saw me he asked me if I was okey,

I got confused and said yeah why? I didn’t think anything of it, I was about to drink more and another person said we are leaving, i stod up and threw away the coffe, 

Later that night I became super high, extremely high, I almost went to the hospital, I was drugged, I was very lucky, I only took a sip, if I hade drank all of the coffee I truly believe I would not be alive anymore, 

I called a friend and asked what to do, 

 He said leave town now and made a plan, later I was going to pay a light bill and on the bill it was 444, 111, and 555,  

I have now left town and am alive, I don’t know what the future holds, but im alive, if something didn’t help me or guide me I would be dead by now, I truly believe it, I am in another town now, I hade a dream that I was in someone funeral and was crying, I later got some sort if small mini casket, I placed a doll in it, I don’t know what it means or symbolises, don’t remember fully, later that day i saw 888 and 999,

1qqiuc1,https://www.reddit.com/r/stepkids/comments/1qqiuc1/i_feel_odd_towards_my_stepmom/,I feel odd towards my stepmom,"Hi! I just need a little advice without too much judgement. I say that because my mom is dating a woman. (I understand some people don’t agree with that but that isn’t the main point i’m making with this post).

So here is a bunch of backstory which I believe could help others maybe help me understand how i feel how I feel. 

My mom got with this woman awhile back, which did not bother me. Although i am used to her being with men so it was an adjustment but before i was born she dated a woman for eleven years so i wasn’t exactly shocked she was dating a woman. But they had a bit of a fallout (it was mostly my step-mom targeting everyone and being a raging petty bitch to my mom, uncle and his gf at the time, veryyyy long story lmao). Which already made me feel some kind of way about her.

Then some stuff happened and we moved in with my step-mom. which i really had to warm back up to the thought of her which still hasn’t really happened. I’m just sour over what happened previously, even when a lot of her issues previously were because of my uncles gf at the time (my step mom and his gf used to be good friends now they are petty towards one another- again long long longggg story). 

My issue with my step-mom now is she is SO overbearing.. almost too overly caring to the point it’s obnoxious, and that is coming from somebody who tries to be very caring and understanding. You breathe wrong around her and she’s all over you asking if you are okay and this and that blah blah blah. Which is feel is adding to the resentment i already have towards her.

But, about a week or so ago my step mom came up to me and was like “I wanna talk to you seriously” and I got a little nervous so i was like sure.. okay and she asked me “can i take care of your mother for the rest of her life?” and that right there made me feel odd. It is such a simple question but i still felt odd about it. I hate the idea nonetheless. 

A little more backstory, I have taken care of my mom for a very long time. Third grade i was getting me and my older brother up for school while she was practically half dead in her bed from lyme disease. That already caused me to be independent (another thing with my step-mom is she always wants to help even when you nicely ask her no and she becomes overbearing). anyway, then throughout middle school my mom was battling a HUGE and i mean HUGEEE abscess in her jaw that dentist or doctors clearly didn’t know what to do with until somebody finally got it cleared up. Then she had a bunch of surgeries (amputations) that left her super sick and really not able to walk since it was her feet. (first her right big toe went, then her left big toe, then half of her right foot, then up to her ankle on her right leg, then sadly a below the knee amputation on her right leg) so, i was always helping her throughout middle and the beginning of high school. Which honestly led us to not have a great relationship because i was always with her and helping her. and you know how teens are, moody and they want space bad. I also had a lot of undiagnosed things that contributed to my behavior.

Anyway sorry i keep getting off track i just feel these details are important. But i think me taking care of her for so long makes me protective over her even more then a daughter already is of her mother. not to mention she is all i have since my father passed away. it’s always been me and her. 

The other night my mom asked me to make her a coffee (everybody in my house likes drinking coffee at night for some reason), and she said that my step-mom knew how to do it how she liked it if i needed help and for some reason it broke my heart. it was so simple but i made her coffee and when i gave it to her i started bawling. I don’t feel like i’m being replaced. i really don’t know how i feel but it isn’t good feelings.

I think the reason my step-mom asked me that stupid question is because i’m going to college this upcoming fall. But the thing is, my mom has to move near me so i can live off campus (i have cats and the dorms don’t allow cats and i need my cats sooo) and the rule is your parent has to live near you for your first two years if you want to live off campus. and my step-mom is staying in the house we are currently in so she can pay it off and buy it. So i mean i would be closer to my mom anyway? and my mom wouldn’t be alone. my uncle (her baby brother) is gonna live with her too, they take care of eachother and really need eachother so i trust him obviously. 

I am just so annoyed. I never get any time with my momma anymore and our relationship has just started getting better now i’m medicated and obviously more grown up or mature. I always talk to my mom about my school work and school drama and all that. But i never can because my step-mom is always up her ass.

Again, i’m so sorry if everything is out of order in a way, i was typing this quick and kinda just pouring my feelings out. But i guess i just want to know what i could be feeling if that makes sense.",1,1769715851.0,stepkids,0,1.0,False
1qqiu7q,https://www.reddit.com/r/queerpolyam/comments/1qqiu7q/its_tough_out_there_and_not_just_for_men/,"It's tough out there, and not just for men","First, I'm not really complaining, ""venting"" just seemed like the closest of the flair options. For the past 10 years of being queer and some flavor of poly, I've always been able to find either partners or hookups when I have wanted to, perhaps in part due to my own stubbornness. But I want to ruminate a little on my experiences dating in 2025.

I know it's a stereotype, the straight guy/bi woman couple decide to open up, bi woman is swamped and the straight guy gets crickets on the apps. I'd like to posit that this doesn't just apply to men, it applies to anyone trying to date women. I'm speaking as a (mostly)cis woman who has been on the apps looking for women and enbies for the past year.

I've had luck with apps in past. One six month relationship in 2024, one lovely fling that lasted a few months until the person moved, some years-long friendships and one casual friend who introduced me to his roommate who I ended up dating for years, and my partner of the past year who I'm so delighted with that I'm feeling more ENM than poly lately. But these connections have all been men, both trans and cis.

I met my female partner of a decade at a house party, and any time I've either hooked up with, played consistently with, or dated a woman, she's been someone I met more organically. I spent 2025 looking for some more femme energy. In past, with men visible on the apps, I felt like I had my pick (doesn't hurt that I'm also a domme, which tends to be in high demand with a specific category of men). With men turned off on the apps, I was getting just a couple likes a week. The women who piqued my interest the most were not liking me back at all. Many women didn't write back if I initiated a conversation after we matched. I'm usually more attracted to masc or alt presentation, while also presenting masc myself, which I know narrows my field.

I went on 4 new dates in 2025. One went quite well, but the person moved away within weeks after the date. Two went hilariously badly, involved a lot of trauma dumping, and will make for funny stories in the future. One went great and we're casually playing, but I realized I'm not sexually attracted.

I haven't solely been on apps, and in fact, I've decided that apps are one of the worst ways for me to meet people at this time in my life, so I've shut them down for now. I can't assess chemistry at all over text, and a first meet for coffee or dinner or drinks is a high social stress environment for me, where I tend to be overwhelmed, rigid, and not at my best. I have also been dancing and finding other new social activities, which has been leading to much more natural flirting and much lower stress on my end.

I think my point is that poly/ENM dating is hard right now, perhaps not just for men, but for anyone who is trying to date women. Lesbians are generally not thrilled when they hear that I have a male partner, no matter how queer he actually is (and no one reads profiles, even when I put it front and center). Actually, lesbians are usually fine with him when they meet him in person, so taking him to queer dances is working in my favor, but just hearing about the bi or pan woman with the man in her life is a bunch of red flags to lots of lesbians. That's fair. Women overall seem to be really wary and mistrustful of new people, male or female, lately. That's also fair, so am I. It seems like everyone is complaining about their struggles to find good, safe sex, or intimacy, but everyone is also wary and shut down to new connections.

I suppose I'm interested in hearing other experiences, particularly other people trying to form sapphic connections. Does any of this resonate, have your experiences been similar, or different? And hey, guys, it's not just you who are struggling!",2,1769715844.0,queerpolyam,0,1.0,False

I don’t think it was meant as a jab at me personally.  
If anything, it felt… oddly relevant.

[That video captures a real tension in Shanghai’s coffee scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC1QYAe1SK4). On one hand, there’s aesthetics, branding, social media narratives. On the other, there are genuinely good cafés, baristas who care, and places that don’t show up unless you already know them.

When I built [cafeshanghai.com](http://cafeshanghai.com), it wasn’t about curating a vibe. It was about organizing what already exists, boring things like data, locations, and filters. No storytelling, no lifestyle angle, no influencer energy.

Just:  
Where is the coffee, and how do I find it?

So yeah, the video wasn’t wrong. It just highlights why separating signal from noise matters. The scene has both. Tools don’t need to perform. They just need to work.

Anyway, thought it was an interesting bit of accidental context.

The last echo of the broken note still clung to the rafters, even after Wellers had turned and walked away. I stood there, surrounded by emptiness. The chandeliers above no longer shimmered. The hush was heavier than silence, thicker than dust.

I looked out across the audience. The red velvet seats had returned to stillness. No more clawing shadows, no mouths stretched into forever. Just rows upon rows of perfect emptiness, as if no one had ever occupied them. As if the things I had seen, felt, feared… had never been here at all.

But one chair drew my eye.

Front row, center-left. Seat 7. Claire's seat.

No one sat there now. But the cushion bore the faintest indent, the shape of someone having sat with poise, stillness, care. Pressed into the velvet was a ghost of a presence, more intimate than anything else in the hall.

I stepped down from the stage, giving the piano one last look. They were cold now. Lifeless. No voice left in them. Just polished wood and quiet dust.

Down the aisle I walked, past where the shadows once writhed. Towards the corridor Wellers had vanished into, the door parted just enough to suggest invitation.

As I walked through, the ground beneath my feet had begun to crack. Hairline fractures like veins in skin, running beneath the surface. The sconces lining the corridor flickered as I entered like they were deciding whether to stay.

I moved slowly. The hush of the hall followed me into the corridor, but here it was different, denser. Almost syrupy. Like I was walking into soundlessness made solid.

The corridor twisted subtly with each step, just wrong enough to feel it in my bones. Paintings lined the walls, portraits of men and women in recital dress, all expressionless. The further I went, the more warped their shapes became: limbs too long, necks too thin, eyes that didn’t point the same direction.

And then, I saw her.

Claire.

Or what looked like her.

She was seated in the painting, hands resting in her lap, dark hair tucked behind one ear, a blue dress like the one from the recital. But this wasn’t the frozen poise of performance. This was different. She was looking at me. No…through me.

The brushwork shimmered like wet paint. I stepped closer. Her eyes seemed to change as I did. Widening, softening. There was recognition in them. Sorrow. I raised my hand, fingers trembling. I didn’t want to touch it. I just needed to see if she would stay.

I blinked.

She was gone.

The frame was empty. Just aged canvas now, the ghost of a portrait that hadn’t ever been. I stood in front of it for a long while, unable to breathe. Then I heard footsteps, soft and steady, from up ahead.

Wellers.

I turned and followed.

Eventually, I found him standing at the end of the corridor, motionless. His hands folded behind his back like a curator admiring a painting. Before him loomed a tall door of polished black wood, inlaid with a mirror that didn’t reflect a thing. No light, no room, no me. Just a yawning pane of stillness. Like it hated the concept of its existence.

He didn’t look at me when I approached.

“This is the quietest part of Bellmare,” he said softly. “She breathes slowest here.”

“What is this door?” I asked.

He tilted his head slightly, as if listening to some distant instrument tuning itself. “A mirror, Mr. Goodpray. But not to what’s in front of it.”

I stared at the door. It pulsed slightly. Like it was waiting.

His eyes, dark and glasslike, held no warmth. But no cruelty either. Just something deep. Old.

“You talk like you’re part of this place,” I said.

“Wellers has been many things,” he answered, almost wistfully. “Concierge. Usher. Custodian. Mouthpiece.” He placed a hand gently on the doorframe. “But never the composer.”

“And who is?”

“The one who listens. Who gathers. Who waits for the final note to fall.” He glanced at me. “But not all music is meant for endings. Some… simply linger.”

My breath had fogged slightly, and I hadn’t noticed until now. The hallway behind us seemed longer than it should have been. Like we’d stepped outside of something. Or beneath it.

“Wellers,” I asked, quietly. “Is there a way out?”

He regarded me. “That depends. Some find freedom in silence. Others in crescendo.” He paused. “But you, Mr. Goodpray, you’ve already given the performance. The question is what you do after the curtain falls.”

We stood before the mirror door. It didn’t show us. Just a pitch-black depth. Like staring into a river without bottom.

“Well then,” he said, and his voice barely rose above the breath of the hall. “Shall we proceed?”

I nodded, though everything inside me screamed the opposite.

And together, we stepped through.

Beyond the mirror, the world shed its shape. It was absence, stretched into suggestion. The corridor was gone, replaced by something less built and more remembered. Space didn’t hold here. The ground shifted and pulsed beneath us like walking on water. The memory of walls curled like parchment soaked in time.

We were walking, but nothing moved.

Memories blinked into view, then vanished. A field I’d never walked in. A woman who looked like Claire, but wasn’t. A recital hall where the ceiling bled stars. A cracked piano in an old train car. Children’s laughter from a mouthless choir.

“None of this makes sense,” I muttered.

“Wellers never promised it would,” he said beside me.

“You... you aren’t Wellers. Are you?""

A pause. “No.”

I stopped. The air stood still. “Then what are you?”

He turned his face to me, and in the not-light of this place, it blurred slightly. Like a portrait that hasn't fully dried.

“I’m the third son of the one who buried the stars,” he said softly, as if the words were old and tired. “I was composed before the bell was first struck. I listened. I learned.”

His voice was Wellers, but not just Wellers.

“All that remained was silence,” he said. “So I filled that silence with voice. From voice, I became music—song, echo, memory. I learned to wear men like overcoats. They walked me into churches, into concert halls, into cities built on sorrow. I listened to their notes. I remembered them.”

“And Wellers?”

“He let me in,” the voice replied. “Long ago. In grief. In yearning. He wanted to remember something so badly that I stayed to help him.”

“What did he want to remember?”

There was a hush, like a page turning. “A girl with hair like copper chords. She played violin in the hollow before the Hollow.”

Silence settled. I didn’t push that subject further.

“You said you listened,” I said again. “But why me? Why now?”

The not-light around us shimmered, and for a moment, the corridor folded into something like water. It was navy, with a full moon hanging heavy above, its pale light fractured by waves that never broke. “You didn’t drown in your sorrows,” Wellers murmured, voice low and sure, “though many do. You faced the currents, though the depths called.”

The faint image shifted. The watery veil around us now twisted into shadows, deep and near, weighted like the blackened surface of a lake at midnight, cold and silent. “Nor did you turn away, closing yourself to the echoes that cry in silence, burying your voice beneath a silence not meant for keeping, hiding passion and love beneath the frozen dark. That kind of silence suffocates.”

I looked at him, the figure who was not quite Wellers, and waited.

“You played,” he said again, softer now, “the grief in your bones. And places like Bellmare remember songs like that. You gave your mourning shape. That makes you more than an audience.”

I wanted to be angry. But there was no room for rage anymore.

“Why didn’t you take me earlier?”

He turned his head just slightly. “You weren’t ready to let go.”

The path beneath us flickered like piano keys pressed by invisible fingers. Each step sounded like notes played in a room with no walls.

“Is Wellers… still alive?”

“For a time. Long enough. He served the hall well. Carried its quiet for decades. A good host.”

“And now?”

A small smile touched the corner of Wellers’ borrowed mouth.

“He’s fading. The song is softer now.”

I swallowed the lump in my throat. “And Claire? The real Claire?”

A longer pause this time. The silence felt like a drawn breath just before the crescendo.

“She passed through,” the voice said. “But she was not taken. Some spirits write themselves louder than I can erase.”

I didn’t know whether to thank it or mourn again.

We walked a little farther, and the non-existent path finally formed into something definite. A door. Wooden, carved with a wreath of thorns around a single keyhole. No handle. No reflection.

The thing wearing Wellers looked at me.

“This next part,” he said, “you walk alone.”

I stepped through the door and into home.

The apartment smelled like rain and dust on the sill. It wasn’t just any place. It was ours. Claire’s scarf hung on the hook beside the kitchen. One of her books lay open on the coffee table, spine cracked in that same way it always had. The window was cracked an inch, the curtains breathing in and out like lungs trying to remember how. The walls were warm with afternoon gold. The kind that comes just before a storm, when the air thickens and memories slip through the cracks. I half-expected to hear the kettle whistle from the kitchen, or the soft thump of her feet padding across the floor.

Instead, there was only music.

It came from the piano, just out of view, in the far room. Gentle, slow. Each note held too long, like it didn’t want to let go.

I turned the corner.

And there she was.

Claire. Not in blue. Not in black. Not some twisted reflection from Bellmare’s throat. But her. Hair loose and dark, falling like a ribbon down her back. She wore an old grey cardigan with a hole in the sleeve. Her fingers moved across the keys with grace.

She didn’t look up at me.

I stepped closer. “Claire?”

She finished the song, let the silence land gently, then turned. Her eyes met mine. And for a moment, the ache in my ribs untwisted itself.

“Hi,” she said.

I couldn’t speak at first. My breath had caught somewhere between the years.

“I—I’ve missed you,” I managed.

“I know,” she said, and smiled, sad and warm. “I’ve been with you the whole time, you know. Even when you couldn’t see me.”

I knelt beside her, not daring to touch her.

“Was it all real? The Hollow, the hall, the music?”

Her eyes moved to the piano. “Some places are made from grief,” she said. “And some scores stay because we keep playing them.”

“I tried to save you.”

“I know,” she whispered. “But I didn’t need saving. You did.”

A silence hung between us like a last note waiting to fade. Her hand reached out and hovered above mine, as if contact would break the illusion.

“You can let go now, Liam,” she said.

“I don’t know how.”

She blinked slowly, like a curtain falling.

“Then just try.”

I did.

And when I opened my eyes again, she was gone. The piano was empty, the keys still warm. The sunlight had dimmed, and the room had folded itself back into memory. As I stood, I felt the absence land quietly in my chest. This time, it wasn't jagged like before, but soft. Bearable.

Behind me, a shadow crossed the doorway.

“Wellers,” I said.

He nodded once, eyes dark and calm.

“To leave,” he said, voice still too calm, “there must be a price to be paid.”

“I’ve paid,” I said, without hesitating. “I’ve played. I’ve wept. I’ve given her up.”

He tilted his head slightly, something ancient flickering behind his eyes.

“Yes,” he said, voice richer now, more layered. Like a choir echoed inside his chest. “You have. And I do not keep what was freely given.”

He reached into his pocket and pulled a folded piece of paper, handing it to me silently. I unfolded it carefully, tracing the words with a finger.

“Compensation: Solace”

I placed the letter gently on the kitchen table, the same where it first appeared. The start, and end, of this circle.

He stepped aside, revealing a new door. One I hadn’t seen before, even in dreams. There was no sound behind it. No music. Just wind, and the scent of soil and ash.

“Wellers is resting now,” the voice added, quieter. “He heard enough songs for one life. Maybe too many.”

I looked back once more at the piano. The room. The absence. The fading visage of Wellers.

Then I walked through.

The door didn’t creak as it opened. It breathed, like something sighing its last. I stepped through into air that was far too still. The sky was grey, but free of storm and smoke. It was the kind of sky the world forgot about. Dorset Hollow lay before me, or rather, what remained. The town had been consumed. Not freshly. This wasn’t the aftermath of a sudden fire. No—this had happened decades ago.

Charred timbers stuck out from cracked sidewalks like bones. Vines and ivy choked storefronts whose signs had long since faded to memory. The post office was caved in. The diner was gone entirely, only the metal skeleton of the DIN(N)ER sign left, its last flicker long gone.

The silence was total. It felt cleared, like the performance had finally ended after final act. I walked through the ruins, boots crunching cinder and glass. No one followed. No voices, no notes. Just the wind.

I passed the statue. It was now collapsed, overgrown, eroded to the knees. No piano. No scarf. Just a stone base lost to time. But it was the church that stilled me.

Saint Cecilia’s stood at the end of the street like a forgotten sentinel. Its steeple was cracked. Its sign hung crooked, the lettering barely legible.

*“Sing unto Him, ye who mourn.”*

The windows were blackened from the inside with more than just soot. Scorched glass, melted and warped, like they’d burned in a fire that never touched the rest of the building. And behind them, even in daylight, there was that same impossible glow. Like flames from a time far gone. I didn’t go inside. I just stood there a while. Not praying. Not asking. Just listening. And the church, mercifully, was silent.

I found my car at the entrance of the town. It was dusty, but intact. The keys laid on the hood.

The drive home was long, but uneventful. Roads uncoiled beneath my tires like ribbon being drawn back from something. Towns flickered past, alive and indifferent. Gas stations. Trees. Traffic lights. The world had kept going.

And now, so would I. 

When I stepped into the apartment, the scent of old life greeted me. Mail piled by the door. A coat left hanging. Silence. The same silence from Bellmare, but this time, it wasn't malicious.

I crossed the room, past where her photo still sat. Framed in silver, smiling in spring. I didn’t touch it.

Instead, I went to the piano.

It had been under a sheet since the day I stopped playing. Not out of spite. Just… pain.

I took a breath, and peeled the cloth back.

Dust swirled, catching the amber light of the setting sun. The keys were yellowed slightly. The wood dry. But it was whole.

I sat down.

No voices whispered. No shadows reached for me. No notes forced themselves into my hands. Just silence.

I placed my fingers on the keys. And then, for the first time in years, I played.

Not for her. Not for anyone watching. Just to let something go.

The melody was soft, simple. I don’t even know where it came from. But it felt like closing a door.

When I finished, I left my hands resting on the keys.

In the hush that followed, I almost imagined I heard someone whisper “thank you.”

But no one was there.

1qqio0u,https://www.reddit.com/r/mead/comments/1qqio0u/storebought_mead_started_fermenting/,Store-bought mead started fermenting,"Hey gang,
Asking this question here mostly out of curiosity, I'm not getting many clear answers online and figured this sub might have some advice.

Basically, I bought a bottle of coffee-flavoured mead a couple of months ago, I opened it when I got it to taste it, but haven't had the opportunity to finish it yet so it's been sitting in the press since. Recently I noticed the cork had come off of it, put it back on and a couple of days later noticed it had come off again. I decided to investigate more closely, and have figured out that it's producing gas, and when the pressure builds up enough the cork pops off.

My question is, what should I do with it now? It still seems fine taste-wise, though tbh the coffee flavour is strong enough that I'm not sure I'd notice if it changed. Is it safe enough to keep, and if so, how do I keep the cork from coming off again? Is the gas being produced because of fermentation, and if so will it stop at some point naturally, or would I need to do something about it? Any suggestions or advice welcome.",2,1769715459.0,mead,3,1.0,False

For a moment, I forgot where I was.

Time, place, identity, they all slipped. Like I’d dropped a thought mid-sentence and couldn’t find the beginning again.

When I came back to my senses, the air had changed.

It wasn’t thicker because of heat or humidity, but something heavier. Like I was standing underwater. My limbs felt slow. Sound came dulled. Even my own breath took effort, as if the air resisted me pulling it in.

I stood there, just outside Bellmare, unsure if I should take another step.

The dreams had rattled something deep in me, left behind a cold I couldn’t shake. Part of me wanted to get the hell out of dodge.

But something about the Hollow called to me. It was like a thread tugging at the center of my chest, winding through my ribs, pulling me forward. It wasn't exactly out of curiosity, but still, some part of me wanted to see what waited in the dark.

And beneath that pull, another tether held me tighter. Heavier. The piano. The single note that still echoed in my bones. The ghost of applause, wrapping around me like a chain. Whatever it was, whoever it was, I wouldn’t understand it just by running. I had to see it through. And the only place I’d find my answer was at the performance later that night.

I focused my vision again onto Dorset Hollow. Still there. Still silent. Still waiting. The streets remained empty as always. But now, now, I knew they weren’t abandoned. There was presence here. A pressure behind the eyes. A shift in the light.

Every so often, in the corner of my vision, I caught movement. Shadows that pulled away just before I could look at them.

There was nothing else to do but wander. The kind of wandering you do in dreams, where the destination doesn’t matter, just the walking.

I passed storefronts that might’ve once had purpose, but now only whispered the idea of life. A flower shop with brittle tulips in the window, their petals shriveled and gray. A tailor’s studio with empty hangers and no mannequins, just lengths of cloth draped like shrouds. Even the post office had its mail slots nailed shut, as if the town refused to receive anything from the outside world.

The Hollow wasn’t large, not in the way cities are measured. But it was deep, layered. Like a painting whose shadows pulled you inward, further into more. The streets twisted. Turned. Looped.

I kept walking.

Some of the houses I passed looked exactly like the ones before, but with just enough difference to make me doubt my memory. One had two windows instead of three. Another had a door handle that shifted sides. Every so often, I’d pass a porch I swore I’d seen moments earlier, but this time, the rocking chair was facing a different direction. Small things. Not big enough to prove, but just enough to disturb.

I tried leaving. Just to see if I could. Every road led back to itself. Every sign became circular.

There were no cars, no wind. No birds or rustling trees. Even my footsteps sounded distant, like they weren’t entirely mine.

Then, faintly, I caught a smell. Fresh bread. Warm and sweet, like it had just left the oven. It pulled me like a memory, straight to the bakery on the corner. The windows were fogged slightly, as if there was life inside, but the door was locked.

A handwritten sign hung in the glass:  
**“Recital Tonight — 7PM”**

Of course.

I kept walking. A few storefronts later, I passed a bookstore that I hadn’t noticed before, or maybe it hadn’t been there before. Dorset Hollow seemed to shift when I wasn't looking.

There was only one book in the window, laid on a pedestal.  
Blue cover. Silver ink.  
**“The Audience Remains.”**

I don’t know why I went in, but when I did, there was no bell. No creak of the hinges. Just a hush. A dense silence that folded around me like fog, soaking into my skin, my bones, my breath.

A woman sat at the counter. Clerk, maybe. Her back was to me, still as stone. She didn’t turn. Didn’t flinch. Didn’t even breathe, as far as I could tell.

I stepped in further. The bookshelves were tall and crooked, packed tight with strange tomes. The spines were unlabeled. Most of them were bound in a leather that didn’t feel right. Too dry, too smooth.

I pulled one free and opened it.

Blank pages.

Another: chaotic piano scores, like a child's scribbles.

Another: my name.

**LIAM GOODPRAY**

Written over and over, in identical script, line after line. Front to back. Hundreds of pages.

**LIAM GOODPRAY**

**LIAM GOODPRAY**

My chest tightened. I slammed the book shut. The sound echoed like thunder in the dead quiet.

Then I heard it. A hum. Low and steady. Three notes. Those same three notes from the dream. The woman still hadn’t moved, but she was humming.

Her voice didn’t waver. It was soft, but too constant., too clean. Like something pretending to be human.

I didn’t wait for her to turn around. I left. Fast. Didn’t close the door behind me. Didn’t look back. But as I stepped out onto the street again, I heard a page turn.

I went to the diner. It was quieter than yesterday though. The indoor lights were dimmed slightly and the red glow of the DIN(N)ER sign was noticeably faded. I walked in, if only for the sense of normalcy it would provide. That was naive of me.

The young man was sitting in his booth. He had the same flannel shirt and same thousand-yard stare. The same waitress stood with the same cherry-red lips.

I didn’t ask for any, but she poured me coffee.

“Sleep well, honey?” she asked.

“Not really.”

She didn’t say anything to that, but placed a napkin near my cup. Someone had drawn some music notes on it in pen. It was the same three notes from my dream.

“You know this song?” I asked.

“It knows you.”

I didn’t ask her to explain.

After drinking my coffee, the young man motioned to me and then pointed to some kind of bulletin board near the register. 

“I didn’t know you were famous,” he said.

I looked. It was a concert poster. In an elegant, silver-penned script at the bottom was the Bellmare Hall crest. But the person on it wasn’t me. It was Claire.

She was mid-performance, at that same piano from the hall. Her black hair was tucked behind one ear on her tilted head. The dress she was wearing was the same blue as the flash I had seen yesterday in the concert hall. Her expression was the same one she had when she got lost in the music. Poised. Serene. Beautiful.

But the date at the bottom of the poster, between the crest and the picture, read “March 3rd, 1953”.

“That’s not me,” I said, barely holding back tears.

The man simply looked at me and shrugged. “Sure looks like you buddy.”

I stared harder at the poster, and just for a second, I could see it. My hands on the keys, my face superimposed onto hers. But then it was gone. Just Claire again.

I blinked and some tears made their way through. “That’s not me. Just someone I knew. Someone who’s gone.”

He looked at me again, with no emotion behind it except maybe tiredness. “Lots of folks think they recognize someone in these old posters. Faces change, blurs overlap.""

He turned his tired eyes up to me. ""But she’s always there, the lady in the blue dress. Always seated in the front row, always smiling like they’re playing a song that she composed.”

I stepped forward and and leaned in closer until my eyes were inches from the poster. More details emerged...details that shouldn’t have been there. A necklace I gave her on our third anniversary, a scar on her hand from that time she broke a plate.

“This can’t be real. She’s never been here. She wasn’t even alive in the fifties.”

“Time’s funny in this town, especially around Bellmare,” the man said, looking at his coffee. “Sometimes it doesn’t flow. Sometimes it sits still, waiting.”

“For what”

He took a sip of coffee. “You.”

I stepped out of the diner, my heart pounding in my chest like a wild animal in a cage, and my hands squeezed so tight it felt like I was holding glass. I didn’t know where I was going, but I just had to walk. 

A poster from 1953. With Claire on it. This had to be some twisted joke. A prank that the whole town was in on. But I couldn’t explain the necklace or the scar, or how her face almost became mine for a second. 

I kept walking. Right by the empty stores. Right by the hollow houses. Shadows followed me in the windows like angels of death. They were gone once I looked at them. And the sun seemed to be setting, but only in the spots where I stood. Maybe I was going crazy.

I just kept walking. But then I noticed it, past the hollow buildings and shaded windows. A small church, rooted in ivy and fog. Its white steeple pointed heavenward. The door hung open, inviting me in. The sign out front was faded, but I still made out the lettering:

""Saint Cecilia’s—Est. 1897""

Beneath it, scratched into the wood:

*“Sing unto Him, ye who mourn”*

Through the glass, I saw a figure. A red-headed woman was seated in a dim glow, playing  a violin. I heard no sound. Her fingers traced melodies I couldn’t hear, but somehow felt in the depths of my being. Sorrow. Her figure blurred, and then vanished into the shadows.

I stepped inside. The temperature dropped immediately. It wasn’t just cool, it was freezing, like an arctic crypt. I could even see my breath. The air smelled like damp wood and it had a sharp, metallic undertone that I couldn’t make out. The interior was dimly lit, but it was still intact. Untouched by time. Pews were lined up like a tightly-knit army and a simple altar stood at the opposite end of the door. A modest piano sat to the side of it, much different than the one in Bellmare. This one didn’t seem to be calling me to play. 

On the walls were stained-glass windows, but the colors seemed too dark. I thought it was just dust, but then I noticed that there was no sunlight behind the glass, despite the fact that it was the afternoon. It was more like they reflected the glow of a dying blaze: strong, impactful, but otherwise ending.

I moved further in. The floor creaked sadly beneath my feet, as if it was mourning itself. On top of the pews, candles were lit, leaking wax down the wood. They left fresh impressions upon the cushions. There wasn’t a soul in sight, and I saw the hymnal. It laid upon the altar, pages yellowed and stained. One stood out. Fresh ink was written on it, blacker than black. It read:

“Requiem for the Empty: For the grieving and the chosen”

Beneath that title was a list of names. A couple dozen perhaps. They didn’t mean anything to me, after all, they were just names. But then I noticed the dates beside them. They ranged from the early 1900s all the way up to 2018. Each had a title.

“Harold Carr (1902): Died during performance”

“Benjamin Mandol (1907): Checked in, hasn’t checked out”

“Jonathan Bale (1912): Playing still”

And right there at the very end:

“Claire Halden (2018): Admitted. Not recovered”

I stared in shock. This couldn’t be the same Claire. My Claire. Halden is her last name, but this was impossible. Then I noticed something off about the page. It was strangely warm. I turned around without even thinking. Nothing behind me but the dripping wax. But then I saw the floor.

The impressions of bare footprints on the dust led from the altar to some corner in the back near the confessionals. I followed. The door of the booth was open, just a bit. I didn’t step in. I couldn’t. Not when I saw what was scratched onto the inside of the door:

*“It’s not her. Not really”*

Then from behind me, from where the piano lay. Three notes. 

That was enough. I left quickly. Not running though, I didn’t want to feel like prey. But every step had more effort put into it than the last. I eventually had to force myself to go further, as it felt like something behind me was commanding me to stay. I didn’t look back, not even once.

Back in town, the sky had dimmed. It wasn’t sunset yet, but the light was dying. Shadows stretch farther than they should have been able to. A nearby clock read 4:22 p.m, but I didn't think time was behaving correctly anymore. I passed the town square and noticed a statue. It wasn’t a war memorial or a founder’s statue or anything. It was a man seated at a piano. His arms stretched and bent wrong, fingers melted into the keys. No name or plaque adorned it, but wrapped around his throat like a noose was a blue scarf, and a lavender bouquet laid at his feet. I continued onward.

I made it back to the hall just after 5:00 p.m. The doors were already open, beckoning to me. Inside, the chandeliers were lit, and the air held a hush like an auditorium right before a conductor lifts their baton. Wellers stood waiting in the lobby, same suit, same smile. 

“You’ve seen her, haven’t you?” he asked.

“I’ve seen…something,” I replied.

“Mr. Wellers finds that it often helps to look,” he said, hands folded. “But not too long. Reflection is a doorway, Mr. Goodpray. But some doors, once opened, don’t shut.”

I stared at him. “You speak like a preacher. Or maybe like…something else is speaking for you.”

His lips curled ever so slightly, into something that somewhat resembled a smirk. “Wellers is but a humble mouthpiece,” he replied. He then paused, tilted his head, and stared right through my soul.

And then, in a voice different to his own, “But the tune is me.”

I backed away, but he didn’t move, didn’t follow. He just bowed his head.

“You should prepare,” he said, his voice returned back to that soft Louisiana tone. “The performance begins at seven sharp.”

I turned toward the exit, toward the parking lot. Toward escape. Toward normalcy. My instincts reached for the car, but my soul had other ideas.

My legs moved on their own, and after a moment, my mind gave up trying to argue. Instead of asphalt, I found stairs under my feet. I climbed back toward my room, slow, like wading into a dream I already knew the end of. The hallway felt longer this time. Or maybe I was smaller. The light bent differently now, and the carpet didn’t make a sound.

The door to my room was open even though I distinctly remember closing it. Inside, a suit was laid on the bed. Black cashmere and silk, cleanly pressed, spotless. Under the amber lights, it shimmered like the night sky. Beside it lay a single lavender and a slip of paper. I picked it up. In the same damn handwriting as the letter that started this whole mess, it read:

*“Bellmare Presents: One Night Only*

*Liam Goodpray, Pianist*

*Those who play, remain”*

Outside, I heard the wind whisk its way through the branches, like whispering voices. And beneath it, music. It wasn’t a melody I knew, but one I could understand. It had a purpose. Shape. But then, it exploded from everywhere. The bed, the desk, the walls, even the windows. I leaned closer to one, drawn in like a sailor to a siren. A reflection began to form in the glass.

Claire. In that blue dress, sitting in the front row of the concert hall, just as the young man said. Through the reflection, her eyes met mine. She was smiling. And then, a nod.

A part of me believed that it was her who played that note I heard outside Bellmare. That faint, aching D-minor echo. And then, something inside me clicked.

If I stayed, if I played, maybe the performance would finish what had been left undone. Maybe the music would bridge the impossible. And maybe… just maybe… I could see her again. Not in my dreams. Not in my memories.

But really see her. Be with her.

The clock on the wall struck 6:55.

I reached for the suit.

1qqim7p,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ServerRecycling/comments/1qqim7p/the_ultimate_guide_to_getting_rid_of_your_old/,The Ultimate Guide to Getting Rid of Your Old Tech: Server Recycling e waste,"I just spent four hours in a crawlspace in Staten Island. My knees hurt. The air tasted like wet drywall and ancient dust. You know why? Because some homeowner thought he could ""dispose"" of an old home [**Server Recycling**](https://sdewaste.org/) by stuffing it behind a false wall. He thought it would just... disappear? Like it’s Narnia?

Instead, the battery backup leaked. It leaked acid. Everywhere. The smell was like a copper penny dipped in vinegar and sulfur. It ate through the floorboards. Now I’m the one who has to tell him his foundation is compromised because he was too lazy to drive to a center.

Look. You’re here because you have a pile of junk. It’s heavy. It’s loud. It’s covered in those little ""Property of"" stickers from a job you quit in 2014. You’re scared of the data, scared of the weight, and honestly, probably just sick of looking at the blinking blue lights. Stop staring at it. Do something.





# Server Recycling e waste

Your old Dell PowerEdge is not a coffee table. It’s a box of poison. Lead, cadmium, mercury. It’s all in there. If you throw it in a regular dumpster, you’re a jerk. Seriously. Those heavy metals leach into the groundwater. You want to drink lead? No.

And don't get me started on the weight. Servers are built like tanks. They have those metal rails that slice through your fingers if you aren't wearing gloves. I’ve seen guys throw their backs out trying to lift a 4U rack unit into a trash bag. A trash bag! Like it’s kitchen scraps! Use your head.

# The Battery Backup is a Literal Bomb

Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS). Every server has one. They are filled with lead-acid batteries. If you leave them sitting in a damp basement, they swell. They bloat like a dead fish.

I’ve had to pull bloated batteries out of casings using pliers and a prayer. It’s terrifying. If that casing cracks and hits your skin, you’re going to the hospital. If you’re recycling a server, the very first thing you do is pull the battery. Take it to a specialized drop-off. Don't leave it in the machine. It’s a ticking clock of corrosion.

# Dust: The Silent Lung Killer

Open an old server. Go ahead. You see that gray wool? That’s not wool. It’s ten years of skin cells, pet dander, and toxic industrial lint. It’s disgusting. I coughed for three days after blowing out a rack in a basement last week.

Wear a mask. A real one. Not a t-shirt wrapped around your face. When you move these things, the dust puffs out. It gets in your eyes. It stings. It’s a physical manifestation of neglect. Clean it before you move it, or at least wrap the whole thing in plastic so you aren't breathing in the ghost of 2012.

# Stop Hoarding the Cables

Why do you have a box of VGA cables? Why? It’s 2026. Nobody wants them. The copper inside is worth pennies, but the plastic jacketing is a nightmare for the environment.

Every time I go to a ""cleanup"" job, I find the ""Box of Shame."" It’s 40 pounds of tangled black cords. It looks like a nest of snakes. Throw them in the e-waste bin with the server. Do not keep them ""just in case."" You will never need a proprietary power brick for a router that was obsolete when the iPhone 6 came out. Let it go.

# The ""Free"" Pickup Scam

You see those flyers on telephone poles? ""Free E-Waste Pickup!"" Most of the time, those guys just want the gold-plated pins. They’ll take your server, rip it apart in a backyard with a crowbar, and dump the plastic and leaded glass in a ditch.

Use a certified recycler. Someone with a permit. If they don't have a physical address and a giant shredder, they aren't legit. They’re just scavengers making a mess of the neighborhood. I’ve spent half my career cleaning up after ""handymen"" who thought they could get rich off scrap motherboards. They can't.

# Power Down Properly

I saw a guy try to unplug a running server rack by just yanking the cord from the wall. The spark was the size of a golf ball. He almost lost an eyebrow.

These things draw a lot of juice. Even the old ones. Shut them down through the OS if you can. If you can't, hit the toggle on the PSU. Don't just pull the plug while it’s humming. It’s dangerous and honestly, it’s just bad luck. Treat the machine with a little bit of dignity before you send it to the crusher.

# The Logic Board Greed

People think the motherboards are worth a fortune because they have ""gold"" on them. Listen to me. You would need a thousand servers to make a gold ring. It’s not a gold mine. It’s a circuit board.

Stop trying to harvest the components yourself. You’re going to cut yourself on the solder points. I have scars on my palms from trying to ""save"" a CPU back in the day. It’s not worth the tetanus shot. Let the professionals with the industrial magnets and the chemical baths handle the extraction.

# Server Recycling e waste

Stop letting that metal mountain take up space in your life. It’s making your house feel heavy and it’s a fire hazard.

Take it to the depot this weekend. Pack it in the trunk. Bring a friend because your lower back isn't what it used to be. Just get it out.





# FAQ

**Can I put a server in the blue recycling bin?** No. Never. The automated sorters at the municipal plant will break, and the workers will hate you. It’s hazardous waste.

**Do I need to remove the RAM?** Only if you’re moving it to another machine. Otherwise, leave it. It’s part of the e-waste. It doesn't hold data once the power is off.

**What about the fans?** They’re just plastic and cheap motors. Leave them in the chassis. Trying to take them out is a waste of your time.

**Is the server rack itself recyclable?** Yes, that’s usually just high-quality steel. You can actually take that to a standard scrap metal yard and maybe get a few bucks for it.

**Should I wipe the BIOS?** Unless you’re a government spy, nobody cares about your BIOS settings. Just kill the hard drives and you’re fine.

Get that junk out of your basement before the mice start nesting in the heat sinks.

1qqilw9,https://www.reddit.com/r/anxietypilled/comments/1qqilw9/the_recital_at_bellmare_hall_part_1/,The Recital at Bellmare Hall (Part 1),"# Movement 1: Overture

I hadn’t touched a piano since Claire died six years ago.

She taught me everything. How to read sheet music. Where to loosen tension and where to hold it. How posture shapes sound and how patience shapes art. She played with this delicate, deliberate grace. It was like her fingers didn’t just press the keys, but also understood them. Music wasn’t just something she made, it was something she was.

I thought we would live a good life. Marriage, a house, maybe kids. We’d grow old together, hands still brushing as we played duets on some dusty upright in our living room.

But then came the diagnosis: brain cancer. Terminal. Sudden. She faded quickly. Her eyes lost their spark, her fingers their control. The music left her long before she left me.

Her final days were in a hospital bed, where tubes hummed in place of melodies. Just before the end, she made me promise I’d keep playing. For her. I gave her my word as I held her hand and felt her pulse disappear beneath my fingertips.

But I couldn’t do it. Every note sounded like her ghost.

I didn’t sell the piano. That would’ve been like discarding her soul. I just covered it, a white sheet draped over it like a shroud. It sat in silence, mourning with me.

Then, one morning, I found a letter on my kitchen table.

I didn’t hear anyone come in. Didn’t see the door move. At first, I thought nothing of it. But the envelope was thick and yellowed, like parchment pried from a tomb. My full name, *Liam Goodpray*, was written in fine, looping cursive. No stamp. No return address.

The first thing I noticed as I picked it up was the smell.

I must’ve been imagining it. How could I not be? It carried a faint trace of Claire’s favorite perfume. Lavender. Soft, calming. But there was something else beneath it now, something colder, sharper. Metallic, like old blood or a rusted key.

Maybe it was just the scent of memory decaying. Maybe it was grief finally finding new ways to haunt me.

I sat down at the table and turned the envelope over in my hands. The paper felt thick, almost damp, like it had been waiting somewhere dark for a very long time. My fingers hesitated at the flap. For a moment, I was afraid to open it, afraid of what it might say.

But curiosity is a quiet kind of hunger. And it always wins.

I broke the seal. Inside was a single sheet, folded twice. The handwriting matched the envelope: elegant, flowing script that looked carved more than written. Each letter precise. Familiar.

I began to read.

“To Mr. Liam Goodpray,

You are cordially invited to perform at the Bellmare Concert Hall, located in our old town of Dorset Hollow. One night, one recital.

Compensation: Solace

Mr. Wellers awaits you.”

That was all it said.

No instructions, no contact information. Just the offer—signed by a name I’d never heard before—and a faded, brittle map inked on the back. No phone number. No email. Just parchment and mystery.

I actually laughed out loud. *Solace?* What kind of payment is that?

But the laugh didn’t last long.

Something stirred in my memory, an old rumor about Dorset Hollow. A fire. Long ago. The kind of story whispered by locals too tired to care and too afraid to dig. They said the town was swallowed whole by flames no one could stop. Just gone. Vanished under smoke and ash.

No one ever talked about what came after. Whether it was rebuilt or left behind like a bad dream. Over time, it just faded from maps and minds. A ghost of a town, that no one cared about anymore. And now, here I was, standing in my kitchen, holding a letter summoning me back to it.

I won’t lie, it piqued my curiosity. But I didn’t make any decisions. Not then. I just folded the letter back up, placed it gently on the table where I’d found it, and walked away.

I dreamed of Claire that night. She was onstage, but not dressed for it. She wasn't in the blue dress she used to wear to her performances. She sat there barefoot in black jeans and a faded Nirvana shirt. Her black hair fell to her shoulders. And her eyes, those deep blue eyes. The kind you look into and can never see the bottom.

She was playing something I didn’t recognize. It was beautiful, yet impossible, like trying to comprehend the full scale of the universe. The music sounded like the concept of grief. Pure, unadulterated grief. Grief so deep it was sacred.

I stood there, unable to move, watching her hands glide over the keys like they still remembered everything this world had taken from her.

She simply looked at me and said, “Don’t go.” No fear or worry, just pleading.

I woke up shaking.

And there, on my nightstand, was the letter.

I went through my morning routine on autopilot. Coffee. Cold water to the face. Clothes. Keys.

Then I got in the car.

After the dream, after Claire’s voice in my head, I needed to see Dorset Hollow. I told myself I wasn’t going to perform. I wasn’t even going to touch its piano. I just wanted to *see* it. That’s what I told myself. Over, and over, and over again.

The drive took five hours. Back roads the whole way. Twisting ribbons of cracked asphalt, no signs, no traffic. Halfway there, the GPS gave out entirely. The screen just froze on a blank patch of nowhere. So I used the map from the back of the letter. It was nearly illegible, faded lines like veins on old skin, as if it was trying to vanish with time. Like it *didn’t want* to be followed. But I traced the path anyway.

The trees thickened as I drove deeper in. The road narrowed to a breath. The usual sounds of the forest—birds, wind, insects—began to fade, one by one, until there was only the hum of my engine. Even that started to feel distant, like it was being swallowed by the air around me. The further I drove, the more the light changed. The sky turned gray, like the world was slowly being drained of hue.

Then I saw the sign. A wooden plaque, rotted at the edges, carved in an old-fashioned serif:

**“Dorset Hollow: A Place for Quiet Reflection.”**

The town looked preserved, paused, as if time had decided to stop flowing here and never started again. It looked like someone had tried to restore it, faithfully and lovingly, back to what it might have been decades ago. Maybe the fire was real. Maybe they rebuilt it, but if they did, they rebuilt it too well.

The buildings stood upright and well-kept, their paint untouched by weather or age. But there was something hollow in their stance, like they were facades of real places.

The windows were especially strange. Clear as crystal, but dim, like they were reflecting moonlight instead of basking in the afternoon sun. I could see my car clock said 1:13 p.m., but everything around me felt like dusk.

The most intriguing thing, however, was that the streets were empty. I didn't see a single soul in sight.

And I don't know how to explain it, but I knew people were there. I could feel them, just out of view. Just around the corner, watching without watching.

Then I saw the diner.

Simple. Modest. It sat on the corner like a prop from an old TV show. Its neon sign buzzed softly, the “N” flickering every few seconds.

**DIN(N)ER.**  
Clever.

I hadn’t eaten all day, and despite the strangeness of it all, the place felt… comforting. Familiar, even. Like a memory from someone else’s life.

I pulled in.

The interior was straight out of 1965: black-and-white checkered floors, red vinyl booths, chrome fixtures that caught the dim light like they were polished just minutes ago. An old jukebox stood in the corner, humming faintly, waiting for coins. The whole diner smelled like hot coffee, bacon grease, and a hint of lemon floor polish.

Three customers were seated: an older couple in the corner booth, and a man about my age sitting alone by the window.

All three looked at me when I walked in, like they’d been expecting me.

I slid into an empty booth, the red vinyl squeaking under me. A moment later, the waitress approached. Her hair was pulled into a tight ponytail, not a strand out of place. Her lipstick was too red for a town this faded, like something from a poster instead of a person. She smiled, but it didn’t reach her eyes. They looked hollow, like the windows outside. Clear, but distant.

“You headed to the concert hall?” she asked, handing me a menu.

“How’d you know?” I asked, more unsettled than curious.

She shrugged and glanced off toward some vague direction, “Not many folks come by here unless they’ve been invited.”

Alright, that made sense. I gave her my order, just coffee and something simple, but she didn’t write anything down.

A few minutes later, she brought over a feast fit for kings. Black coffee, scrambled eggs, perfectly-buttered toast, and a side of crispy bacon. It smelled like memory.

And when I took a bite, it tasted like childhood. Sunday mornings, cartoons humming from another room, someone humming a tune you forgot the name of. Warm. Familiar. A little *too* perfect.

Across the diner, the young man in the window booth looked up.

“You play?” he asked.

I paused, unsure if I wanted to answer.

“Used to,” I said finally.

He nodded, slow and solemn, like that was the only answer anyone ever gave.

“That’s good enough for Bellmare.”

I offered a weak smile. “You been?”

But he didn’t answer. Just lowered his gaze and stared back down at his food, suddenly uninterested.

I reached for my wallet, but before I could pull it out, the waitress was already there, hand out like a gentle warning.

“It’s covered,” she said.

“By who?”

She gave a small shrug. “Mr. Wellers. He takes care of his guests.”

“Nice guy,” I said, more to myself than to her, and left a five on the table anyway.

Bellmare Hall stood at the very edge of town, where the sidewalk gave way to dirt, and the dirt turned to forest.

It didn’t fit Dorset Hollow. Not even close. Where the town was quaint, Bellmare was monumental. Where the streets were quiet, Bellmare was imposing.

The structure was carved from pale stone streaked with veins of deep gray, like smoke frozen in marble. The surface was smooth in places and weathered in others, as if time had tried, and failed, to erode it.

Vines clung to the walls like veins on skin, winding up the facade toward tall iron lanterns that still flickered with open flame. The air smelled faintly of wax and old wood.

But it was the details that really impressed me.

Engraved into the walls and columns were figures, human figures, draped in flowing robes like Roman statues. Each of them were frozen in acts of music. Some held violins, others cellos or flutes, their hands positioned mid-note. Their faces were serene, solemn, or ecstatic. Captured expressions of people who had long since played their final piece. Along the trim and archways were the likenesses of instruments—violins, grand pianos, harps, even unfamiliar, archaic ones—woven into the architecture like sacred symbols.

The great doors stood twelve feet tall, made of dark-stained wood reinforced with iron bands, a knocker shaped like a curled treble clef hanging in the center.

It stood like a grand cathedral to music: solemn, sacred, and built not to echo prayers, but to cradle every note and melody like a holy relic. Every inch of the place radiated the feeling that something important had happened here, or was perhaps about to.

I wouldn't have known whether I was meant to walk in, or wait to be summoned.

But a man stood waiting on the stairs. He was unnaturally tall. Scarily thin. He wore a charcoal-gray suit that clung to him like it had been sewn on in another century. A black top hat perched neatly over a few stubborn tufts of white hair, as if it was clinging to his scalp out of habit more than life.

His skin was paper-white, thin enough to see faint blue veins beneath the surface. His eyes were glazed and colorless, like glass that had forgotten what it used to reflect. It looked like today was his funeral, and he’d forgotten to attend.

“Mr. Goodpray,” he said, voice smooth with a Southern drawl, low and slow. “Mr. Wellers welcomes you.”

His smile was polite. Inviting. Practiced.

“You’re Mr. Wellers?” I asked.

He nodded once, sharp and controlled. “Some call Wellers that.”

“Is that what *you* call you?”

He tilted his head slightly, letting a thin smirk crease one side of his mouth, like my question was an inside joke. “Mr. Wellers prefers to keep things proper.”

That didn’t answer anything. But I let it go.

“Wellers is glad you chose to perform in our humble town,” he said, almost offhandedly, as if we were discussing the weather.

I stopped walking.

“I didn’t say I came to perform,” I said, my eyes fixed on his. “I came to *look*. To see the hall. That’s it.”

Mr. Wellers turned back to face me fully, hands clasped gently in front of him. He tilted his head in a gesture that was either curiosity or condescension, it was hard to tell.

“No one ever says they came to perform,” he replied smoothly. “Not at first. They say they come to look. To remember. To pass through.”

“I mean it,” I said. “I haven’t touched a piano in six years.”

“Yes,” he said softly. “Wellers knows.”

That answer froze the words in my throat.

He smiled again.

“But something brought you here, didn’t it?” he continued. “Something more than curiosity. Grief, perhaps. Or hope. Or maybe... maybe you’re just looking for something to make the silence bearable again.”

“I didn’t agree to anything,” I said, slower now.

“But you came,” he replied, his voice dipped in certainty. “And *that*, Mr. Goodpray, means you’ve already begun to agree. The decision always starts with the arrival. Everything after that is just the song playing itself out.”

I stared at him, heart heavier than I wanted to admit.

He took a single step toward the doors and placed one long, pale hand on the iron handle.

“Shall we?”

I stepped forward into the building, and nearly stopped in my tracks.

The interior was breathtaking.

The lobby soared high above me. Crystal chandeliers dangled from the vaulted ceiling like constellations, scattering fractured light across the room like falling stars. The red velvet carpet beneath my feet was so thick, so plush, it swallowed my footsteps. Even the sound of my breath seemed to vanish into it.

The walls were paneled in dark, polished wood, every inch lacquered to a mirror sheen. They reflected the chandeliers too well, too brightly. Almost unnaturally so. It hurt to look at them for too long, like the reflections weren’t bouncing back light, but echoing something deeper.

But that was only the beginning.

Because then… we stepped into the concert hall.

And the world changed.

It was massive. Far larger than the exterior of the building could possibly allow. The space seemed to stretch endlessly upward and outward. A grand cathedral of music carved out of dream and impossibility. Tiered balconies climbed the walls like layers of an ancient colosseum. Rows upon rows of empty seats spread out before me in perfect symmetry, all facing the stage with quiet reverence.

And at the center of that stage, alone and waiting, was the piano.

It was a full grand. Black lacquered. It gleamed like obsidian under the soft glow of the footlights. It sat there like the crown jewel of Dorset Hollow. Untouched, yet eternal. As if it had been waiting not just for *someone* to play it, but for *me*, specifically.

But, other than that, something about it felt familiar. The shape. The shine. The stillness. It wrapped around me like a memory I hadn’t made yet. Comforting, and yet deeply wrong. It stirred something in me I couldn’t name. A kind of ache. A quiet, terrible longing.

The hairs on my arms stood on end. My heart skipped a beat. And still, without thinking, I stepped toward it. Slowly.

“She’s a piece of beauty,” Wellers said behind me. “Specially made for this hall.”

I nodded slowly, still watching the piano. “She looks…” I paused, trying to find the right word. “Hungry.”

He let out a soft chuckle, but there was nothing warm in it. “Music’s always been a hungry thing. Same with memory. Takes what you give it. Sometimes more.”

I glanced back at him. “That sounds less like admiration and more like a warning.”

“Well, admiration and warning are often siblings. Beauty isn’t gentle just because it’s lovely. And music…” he trailed off for a moment, eyes on the stage. “Music remembers. Even when we don’t want it to.”

There was something in his voice. A heaviness. A certainty. Maybe even grief. Like he was mourning something that hadn’t happened yet, but would.

I turned to face him. “You sound like you’re giving a eulogy.”

“Do I?” he asked, tone still smooth, but now with something like a leer beneath it.

I blinked. Something about that response landed wrong.

“You… usually refer to yourself in the third person,” I said slowly. “But just this moment, you didn’t.”

He paused. Just for a heartbeat.

“Mr. Wellers finds it… easier that way. Keeps things separate.”

“Separate from what?” I asked.

“From before,” he replied, almost too quickly. “Before doors like these opened. Before others started walking through them.”

I raised an eyebrow. “And what happens once they do?”

His eyes drifted to the piano, then to the empty seats.

“They play. Sometimes once. Sometimes forever.”

I was about to press him on that, but he lifted a hand, gently steering the conversation elsewhere.

“You’ll have time to prepare,” he said. “The recital is tomorrow.”

“Why have one anyway? There's barely anyone in town.” I turned towards the empty rows of seats. But out of the corner of my eye, I saw something. A flash of color. A flicker of blue in the far corner of the front row. But the instant I looked directly at it, there was nothing there. Just empty seats.",4,1769715329.0,anxietypilled,0,1.0,False

I've spent time in his childhood town with his mom and his friends from childhood. While everyone is very nice, I can't shake the feeling that they're not very accepting people.

Meaning, when either my husband or I mention ideas or things that are just a bit out of the norm, there's this natural resistance to it. With some of his childhood friends, I've also noticed a superiority attitude or judgement for our white collar jobs which we don't even bring up. There is this way they talk about things, like the our-issues-are-real, yours-are-not, attitude that's there.

It's definitely a vibe. I used to think I was imagining it, but through the years, it's become more obvious to me - culminating in actual discriminatory instances at a coffee shop and a restaurant from the service staff there. 

I don't have any other reference point, because I grew up in different places, in different countries. But this isn't THAT small of a town, and they get a lot of visitors. Is this normal? Or is it just his childhood town that's this way?",12,1769715317.0,AskWomenOver30,20,0.88,False

I’m building benches for cafe seating. There will be two of them, spanning around 8-10ft wide. Because of space limitations, they will be mounted against the wall, so I don’t need a top portion of the bench. 

If I had my choice I would have loved to use oak, but because of cost constraints, as well as the wall not being perfectly straight (some noticeable warping in the middle) I want to find a more straightforward approach.

So I’m thinking of building it out of plywood/mdf, but I have to consider some things:

1) it’s for a cafe so a decent amount of foot traffic so it has to be able to handle wear and tear, as well as customers not getting splinters

2) it has to be waterproof enough since it gets mopped everyday and people spill coffee

3) I’d want the seating part itself to be around 1.5”-2” thick so I can’t just use a flat board.

So here’s my two options and my questions:

1) painted bench using basic wood and plywood. What would be the best wood option for seating part? I could use MDF since they’re durable and straight, use a quality primer as well as scuff resistant paint. I am worried about having to sand/route the edge and potentially having it break apart in the future if a customer was being careless and drops something on the edge

2) get 1” oak boards and use 2” wide pieces as edge. For aesthetics purposes, how would you fill the back wall if there’s like .5” curved spacing?

I’m 21M, he’s 23M. We met online about 7–8 weeks ago. From the start, the connection was really strong. We text basically every day, send pics, voice notes, flirt, all that. We’ve done multiple FaceTime/video calls that last HOURS — like 2–4 hours at a time. He initiates a lot of it too.

We live about 20 minutes apart. We know where each other lives, we know where each other works, we have each other’s phone numbers, Instagram, everything. This isn’t some anonymous online thing.

We met once early on for about an hour. It was fine, comfortable, no weirdness. Since then… nothing.

Every time I bring up hanging out again, it’s:

* “I like to take things slow”
* “I don’t want to rush and ruin it”
* “I’ve been busy”
* “Another time”

But here’s what messes with me: he still talks to me constantly. He FaceTimes me for hours, calls me on work breaks, sends selfies, flirts, compliments me. If I pull back or take longer to reply, he notices and reaches out. So the emotional connection feels real.

It’s not about sex. I’ve said that clearly. I’d be happy with a walk, coffee, sitting somewhere and talking. Literally anything.

So now I feel stuck in this weird limbo where:

* There’s emotional intimacy
* There’s consistency online
* But zero real-life effort

And it’s starting to affect me mentally. I catch myself waiting around, hoping maybe this time we’ll hang out. I feel stupid for caring this much, but at the same time I’ve never had someone be this emotionally present with me before, so I don’t wanna just walk away.

I’m trying to figure out:

* Is this avoidant attachment?
* Is he comfortable with emotional intimacy but avoids real-life closeness?
* Is he unintentionally stringing me along?
* Or do we just want different things and I’m forcing it?

I don’t want to pressure him, but I also don’t want to keep hurting myself waiting for something that might never happen.

1qqicx4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1qqicx4/lets_talk_about_sats_baby/,Let’s talk about SATS baby,"My hot take. We need to move beyond discussing “Bitcoin” and thinking and valuing goods/services in terms of SATS. This is where market adoption will occur. Bitcoin is the platform, SATS are the currency we transact in. I’ve also read about moving to Bits instead of SATS (https://cointelegraph.com/news/sats-vs-bits-debate-bitcoin-adoption-amid-base-unit-change-bip), but honestly I think start with SATS, educate a whole new segment of society on that, and then move to Bits as needed.

Let me take a pass at a more practical example assuming a future where there is a total of 18,000,000 BTC in circulation (assuming \~3 million are confirmed lost). That’s 1.8 quadrillion SATS in circulation.

Let’s say today you are worth $500,000 and the world has $454 trillion in wealth (which is what a search revealed). If the world ran on the Bitcoin platform, and people communicated and transacted in SATS, and you just wanted to maintain your level of wealth you have today as a % of the worlds wealth, you would just need to hold \~2 million SATS which is <.02 bitcoin which would cost you $1,680 as of today.  Want to double your wealth as a % of world wealth, buy 4 million SATS for $3,360.  And so on…

Do those amounts seem doable?  Of course it is for many households. Don’t upgrade that bike, don’t buy that atv or jet ski, downgrade that vacation a little bit, don’t book those tickets.  Buy some SATS instead. More people need to be aware that it just takes a little bit today to preserve your wealth in the long term (assuming of course Bitcoin is the platform of the future, which I think it should/will be).

Now, is the world gonna transfer all that wealth into BTC?  Not soon, but maybe someday if the people demand it, governments keep overreaching like they are today, and as soon as robotics and AI take over more and more (they will transact on a crypto platform, not in traditional currencies).  I believe the platform of Bitcoin is sound. I think we need to move the cultural conversation beyond Bitcoin and start discussing SATS to reduce the “oh I missed the Bitcoin wave” sentiment and start getting the masses thinking in more practical terms of current wealth preservation and spending in more practical terms than some bizarre fraction of BTC.

What are your thoughts?

Here’s another way of thinking about it. A \~$5 cup of coffee is \~6,000 SATS today.  If you found this helpful, upvote it, and if you’d like, buy me a cup of coffee.  I’ll document the process of receiving 6,000 SATS and buying coffee with it if someone wants me to.",0,1769714800.0,Bitcoin,6,0.3,False

1qqiaok,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qqiaok,"Heavy haul – varsity jackets, patchwork pants, and side-button tracks. Which one you picking?","1. Beats x Kim Kardashian Studio Pro (Dune/Earth)
A solid tech accessory if you're into that tonal, minimalist look. The color is ""Dune,"" and it actually looks better in person than in the renders—very low-key and high-end. Sound-wise, they’re standard Studio Pros (heavy bass, decent ANC), but you’re really buying these for the Kim K aesthetic.Great for the ""clean girl/boy"" desk setup.

Score: 8/10

2. Chrome Hearts Patchwork Varsity Jacket (Black/Black)
This is a heavy hitter. The all-black leather sleeves and the cross patches give it a very dark, avant-garde vibe. However, objectively speaking, it’s a lot of branding. If you aren't careful, the sheer number of patches can look a bit ""busy"" or over-the-top for a casual fit. Quality feels substantial, though.Hard to pull off without looking like you’re trying too hard, but high quality.

Score: 7.5/10

3. Chrome Hearts x Matty Boy (?) Red/White Varsity
This is easily my favorite piece of the entire haul. The red is incredibly vibrant, and the contrast with the cream/white sleeves is just classic. It has that vintage collegiate energy but with the luxury edge. It pops way more than the all-black version and feels like a genuine statement piece rather than just another ""hype"" item.Absolute grail. The colorway is 10/10.

Score: 9.5/10

4. Nike x Brazil CBF GORE-TEX Jacket (Mint)
This is a very specific vibe. The mint green color is refreshing, and the sponsor logos (Vivo, Itau) give it that authentic training-kit feel. It’s practical because of the GORE-TEX, but the color might be a bit difficult to style with anything other than black or neutral tech-wear.Great for rainy days or pitch-side, but a bit niche for daily wear.

Score: 7/10

5. Polo Ralph Lauren Harrington Jacket (Tan)
The ""Old Money"" essential. Compared to the Chrome Hearts stuff, this is incredibly plain, but that’s the point. The fit is boxy and classic. My only gripe is that it can look a bit ""dad-ish"" if the rest of your outfit isn't tailored well. It's a safe, reliable mid-layer.Timeless, but lacks the ""wow"" factor of the other pieces.

Score: 8/10 (for utility)

6 & 7. Chrome Hearts Hoodies (White/Black)
Standard fare here. The white one is a clean pullover with the horseshoe logo, while the black zip-up has the thermal-style floral/cross sleeve print. Honestly? They’re hoodies. They look cool, but they’re definitely ""uniform"" pieces for the brand. The white one is going to be a nightmare to keep clean.Essential for the rotation, but nothing revolutionary.

Score: 7.5/10

8. Chrome Hearts Cross Patch Chinos (Khaki)
I wanted to like these more, but the patch placement feels a little random. The khaki color is a nice break from the usual black denim, but the patches make them hard to wear to anything even slightly formal. They are definitely more of a ""streetwear"" take on a classic trouser.Cool detail, but limited versatility.

Score: 6.5/10

9. Chrome Hearts Side-Button Track Pants (White)
These are definitely a ""statement"" bottom. The silver button detailing down the side is a nice touch, and the triple cross embroidery on the thigh is classic CH. However, all-white track pants are a massive risk—one coffee spill and it’s over. They lean very heavily into that luxury-leisure aesthetic, which can look a bit ""pajama-like"" if not styled with the right shoes.High-risk, high-reward. Great for a summer flex, but be careful where you sit.

Score: 7/10

10 & 11. Ralph Lauren ""Polo Bear"" Sweaters (White & Navy)
You can’t go wrong with these. The Polo Bear is a streetwear icon in its own right. The white one with the flag sweater bear is super clean, while the navy one has that classic varsity/collegiate bear. Objectively, these are the most ""wearable"" items in the whole haul. They fit perfectly into a ""Quiet Luxury"" or ""Ivy"" look.Absolute staples. They’ll never go out of style.

Score: 8.5/10

12. Fox Racing Motocross Jersey (Teal/Black)
This one feels a bit left-field compared to the Chrome Hearts and Polo pieces. The ""Motocore"" trend is still a thing, and the teal/black color blocking is bold. It’s a very lightweight, mesh-style material—great for breathability. Honestly, it feels a bit like a costume unless you’re actually riding or going for a very specific Y2K tech-wear look.A bit niche. Cool for a specific fit, but lacks the versatility of the other pieces.

I don't really want to overshoot my goal weight by too much, so I need to increase my calories for a soft landing at maintenance calories. I'm currently eating between 2000-2200 calories per day, and based on my rate of weight loss over the past 6 weeks, I am in about a 700-calorie-per-day deficit. So I need to bump up from 2200 to around 2900.

The issue I am having is that it was hard enough fitting in an extra 400 calories per day when I went from 1800->2200 calories. Like, I mean literally fitting those calories into my body is difficult because we have swapped entirely over to high-volume, low-calorie foods. I have about 800-900 calories between 5am and 1pm (protein coffee for breakfast, fruit/habanero/yogurt/granola bowl for mid-morning snack, chicken burger or hot dog for lunch) then I usually have stir fry for dinner for about 1k calories, then a snack before bed that is another fruit/yogurt/granola bowl for around 300 calories. The stir fry usually fills up an entire 60oz pho bowl to the brim and weighs 3-4lbs. 

If I want to add more calories to this with my current methods, there will physically not be space inside of me to fit the extra 700 calories into this meal. I could spread them out over my other stuff that I eat, but I'm going to have a similar issue with volume. I don't necessarily want to add more meals/snacks because that's just more stuff to keep on top of timing-wise, and I can get off schedule pretty easily depending on what I have going on with work/life things. 

I don't really want to fall into the trap of adding stuff like cheese, butter, or sauces back to the mix because that can spiral out of control pretty quickly.

1qqi8en,https://www.reddit.com/r/raypeat/comments/1qqi8en/being_in_a_state_of_ketosis_helps_my_singing/,"Being in a state of ketosis helps my singing voice? Ergo, carbs themselves possibly causing inflammation? (Plus carnivore -> peat negative experience)","Hello everyone! Bored so I accidentally wrote a slight essay about my experience, I like to be thorough LMAO

As someone who transitioned from fasting/carnivore to ray peat, I’ve been having a few issues incorporating peat principles into my life. I’ve been attempting carbs for a little over a year now, all along the macro percentage range, starches/no starches, juices/whole fruits, raw honey + maple syrup, raw dairy/pasteurized, lean/fatty beef, low pufa at all times, experimenting with organs even, yet I’ve still been struggling with weight regain, and I don’t think I have been starving myself or really overfeeding (purposely…) either. I eat quite ad libitum, loosely aiming for higher carb moderate/low-moderate fat most days, but it’s widely variable, and an occasional at most 20 hour fast when I’m just not hungry some  occasional days and I feel food aversion (likely from a previous day of overeating I’d guess)

I have also used Cronometer to track to see if I fucked anything up, and eventually to put myself in a very slight deficit to help possibly counteract the gaining as a last resort, but even this didn’t help really.

But I went from about 170 on carnivore to about 210-215 now at 5’10 (male btw). (Been this weight since about 3 months after i started carbing) And every time it seems to be stabilizing, a week goes by and the scale jumps (I only look at the scale about once every month just to check up) and my whole body is pillowier. I have love handles and flabs. I keep waiting for it to normalize, but honestly losing hope. (I also made a post last year about losing hope because I had been the heaviest I’d been since I was 280lbs (I think I got to about 225 or so?), the only thing that helped it go back to 205 was pulling back on carbs a LOT, but it stabilized after I added more carbs at about 220 and is now around 215 last time I checked)

And this leads me to… I think I’m learning something about how my body is dealing with carbs in general due to singing…

So, as the title says, my singing gets better in ketosis, full stop.

Essentially, when I eat carbs, in any form \[Carb sources: maple syrup, juice of any sort (usually orange), raw honey, starch (starch fucks my shit up anyway tho lmao, I avoid it most of the time), white sugar with or without potassium citrate added (because sugar uses your body’s potassium, hopefully citrate is fine, I’ve tried the potassium omitted to see if I had a noticeable change and I felt very electrolyte deficient), dairy (but it’s common singer knowledge that dairy impacts your voice negatively (even raw milk does in my experience)\] my range is stunted (I go from hitting g#5 to barely c5, sounds very strained as well), I have no power, I lose fluidity between notes, and I get very exhausted easily from singing. And as soon as I accidentally fast or feel like having coffee with just cream (maybe it’s the lack of lactose and protein? Idk) in it in a given morning, my voice flourishes. I’ve been experimenting recently and it seems like a small steak at lunch and coffee with cream in the morning allows my voice to be like, actually good in the evening. I can hit notes willy nilly as opposed to sounding gravely and rangeless.

To me, this says some sort of inflammation, likely, I’d think, a food sensitivity. But if it was a food sensitivity, wouldn’t the white sugar have shown no difference in my voice? In the end, it’s seeming like carbs just aren’t working out and I keep losing hope for my body 😬

Supplements:

\- 1-2 drops lugols (I’ve heard too much iodine is possibly harmful to your thyroid, but I’ve also heard of people taking like 15 drops so idek anymore. no clue how credible brownstein is after I’ve heard this information, after coming from the carnivore appraisal of iodine, but I play it safe with 1-2 drops a day)

\- 600-1200mg NAC (I’ll take different dosages depending on how methylated I feel, speaking of methylation…)

\- 2000mg 5-MTHF Folate (I suspect that I have mthfr to some extent, because if I take 3000 I get very overmethylated, shows in form of migraine and anxiety, but 1000mg allows some undermethylation symptoms to come back. Confused on the weight aspect however, if I was mthfr then I’d default to being skinny, so that’s odd, but hey the folate helps!!)

\- 1:1 benfotiamine:thiamine mononitrate, as needed, taken with carbs and fats (I usually end up around 800-1000mg total of thiamine at the end of the day, idk how benfo translates to other forms tho. Also, I don’t know how bioavailabile mononitrate is because hcl I think works better for me personally but this thiamine still def works)

\- 2000mg taurine (I heard it’s good for glycogen storage possibly, but it just generally helps me move and keep moving)

\- Riboflavin 100mg (hopefully the quality doesn’t matter too much for this to be bioavailable and I’m not fuckin myself over with it 😅)

\- 400-600mg magnesium glycinate (slightly high because thiamine and creatine use magnesium, or at least, they both make me feel deficient, ESPECIALLY creatine) depends on how I feel trying to sleep, the more awake I am the higher the dose seems to be working, also take 100-200mg of the total amount in the morning, depending on how well I slept)

\-15-20g creatine, split into 2 doses, mixed with oj and possibly eat some protein for the insulin release

If clarifications are needed, I’ll be sure to answer, I may be a lil tho bc I limit my screen time else I doomscroll lmao. Hopefully everything is coherent. Thanks yall!",3,1769714535.0,raypeat,0,1.0,False
1qqi7w6,https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/1qqi7w6/do_i_reconcile/,Do I reconcile?,"Dear daddit, I need help understanding my father as his daughter who is newly postpartum. I don't know if its my hormones acting up or if its a real big deal.

When I was 38 weeks pregnant, I visited my father. I asked if we could go to a small mountain road café just to have coffee together. He refused, said it was too expensive, joked i would pay the bill if he took us there, and didn’t take me there anyway. That already hurt, but the bigger issue came after.

Before that visit, I had to give up my cat. I was extremely overstimulated during pregnancy (the cat had ongoing  behavioural peeing issues), and I asked my father beforehand if he could take her in. He refused and told me to give her to a shelter. I did the best I could in a very overwhelmed state. I still feel guilt a lot. I didn't forgive myself.

When I visited him, he started questioning me about what happened to the cat. He figured it out, and then began shaming me — both privately and in front of other famiy, so they can throw me around. He kept going even while I was crying. It felt intentional, like he wanted me to feel bad. The look on his face was like guilt mixed with disgust. It felt like he was unloading something onto me.

After that, I stopped calling him. I didn’t even want to tell him when my baby was born. I eventually allowed contact, but only with distance — I don’t call him one-on-one, I only include him in group calls with my grandma.

Recently my grandma asked what was wrong. I explained, and she immediately defended him and made excuses. That reopened everything.

Now that I’m a mother, I honestly cannot imagine ever purposely making my son feel bad to relieve my own guilt or discomfort. That’s the part I can’t wrap my head around. How could a father see his pregnant daughter crying, make her cry and keep going?

Am I wrong to compare his way of parenting to mine, with my lack of experience and maybe motherhood and fatherhood is two different things? 

He recently offered to buy baby items (up to a certain amount), which adds another layer of confusion. I don’t know if this is guilt, love expressed poorly or something else.

I’m hurt, angry, and also grieving the father I used to be close to. I don’t expect reconciliation — I just want clarity so I can move forward without carrying this knot in my chest.

The reason this hit me so hard was because I was at my most vulnerable state ever. You don't forget who does what to you when you're pregnant or postpartum. I travelled to his city while 38 weeks heavily pregnant, just to see him. He wasn't just a cheap host, he made me want to leave when i couldn't. I never want to be at his mercy if that makes sense.


I’m not looking to demonize him. I’m genuinely trying to understand and decide – Is this as big as I feel how big it is? I think it can not erase everything he did for me as a father, but I don't really want to be in touch with him anymore.

Here are a few I think would be fun to make/read

photography books

\- you could have themed photography collections such as animals in Heartopia, just pretty nature shots, the flowers/tree “types” with made up descriptions, furniture magazine, fashion magazine. “Street” photography capturing interactions with other players and/or their pets etc. It’s a beautiful game the world is your oyster and I think it would make a cool book to have sitting out

\-Same goes for art books, perfect coffee table book you could make any art gallery for a book

\-Heartopia hacks

Wouldn’t it be fun to have a book talking about “hacks” you’ve learned over the course of the game. Even redemption code magazine (if that’s allowed) or a book talking about recent updates that reads like a newspaper would be fun

\-Music notes

Simple music notebooks for players to practice their instruments 

\-Custom Design tutorial book

How cool would it be to have a simple step by step book on how to make your own custom designs like how people make quilts or plaid patterns or flowers etc.

🌹Ingredients:
2 oz cinnamon-roll infused whiskey
1 oz lemon
1 oz chili spiced tomato simple
3 dash of orange bitters
Clarified - red wine floater 

🌹Techniques:
(Infusions and clarification)

Whiskey ~ I put local mini cinnamon rolls (2) into about 8 oz of J. Rieger whiskey and double strained it after about a day and a half.

Chili tomato simple ~ used about a half can (4 oz ish) of fired roasted tomato, aprox 3-4 oz of water, spiced it with paprika and chili powder and then heavy cup of white sugar and cooked it down for about 15 mins.

Clarification ~ batched out 3 servings of the cocktail to R&D and curdled it with 2 oz of room temp whole milk. Double strained through coffee filter twice. 

🌹details: 

I’m entering this cocktail in a drink competition -  I did a clarified chili-cinnamon roll whiskey sour with a Spanish red floater. 

 (https://www.jriegerco.com/our-spirits/road-to-jerez) - it’s requirements are to use their whiskey and tie it Jerez, Spain. (The whiskey is aged in Jerez sherry wine caskets)

🌹I am stumped on a name for it! 🌹 My concept was to do a spin off of the Midwest staple of eating chili and cinnamon rolls, and the chili and tomato spice flavor profile to kind of mirror traditional Spanish food as well, and then incorporate a Spanish red (maybe sherry if I can find some within my budget) to balance it all out.

No password.

Took three seconds to power on.

Three seconds to nuke seven years of my life.

The lock screen? Not our wedding photo.

It was her.

Mia Carter—the college kid we'd been bankrolling for years.

She sat at the piano. Ethan was behind her, eyes obsessed.

My hands shook as I opened his notes.

2018

Got married today. Lily's perfect—sweet, does what she's told, parents love her. But why can't I stop thinking about Mia?

2020

Mia's back. Told her everything. She loves me too. God, when she cries, I just want to fix everything for her.

2023

Lily pregnant = Mia heartbroken. Not happening. Took care of it.

The phone hit the floor.

Seven years. One pregnancy that ""didn't take."" 

Nothing since—and now I knew exactly why.

Seven years. Seven years of me… the pitiful, perfect housewife. 

Turns out it was all a lie. 

Hubby, you messed with the wrong woman. 

Housewife—retired. 

Genius designer—back in the game.

Ethan walked in while I was still on my knees, death-gripping that phone.

He had a bag from that bakery I loved. The second the door opened, cold air killed the warmth in the room.

He saw the phone.

Froze mid-step, shoe half off.

That gentle look on his face? Cracked right open.

""Lily. Who said you could touch that safe?""

No panic. No guilt.

Just blame.

I looked up. My eyes stung but stayed dry.

""Seven years, Ethan.""

My voice came out wrecked. I shoved the phone toward him.

""Tell me this isn't real.""

He crossed the room fast, grabbed my wrist, and ripped the phone away.

Powered it off. Shoved it in his pocket.

""Everyone's got sh!t they don't want dug up. You're way out of line right now.""

I almost laughed. My ch//est felt like it was splitting open.

""Out of line? You've been in love with another woman this entire marriage and I'm out of line?""

""You married me to get your parents off your back? Made sure I couldn't get pregnant so Mia wouldn't be sad?""

""You're disgusting.""

""Enough.""

He snapped it. Slammed the cake box down.

Frosting splattered across the table.

He took a breath, forcing himself back into that cold, controlled version of himself.

""Mia's fragile, okay? She can't handle stress.""

""I've known her for years. If something was gonna happen, you wouldn't have been in the picture.""

""I married you because you made sense. And because...""

He paused, irritation flashing in his eyes.

""Because I don't dislike you. Haven't I treated you well? You've got my name, my money—what more do you want?""

I stared at him.

Just yesterday he woke up at 3 AM to massage my leg cramps. Carried me over puddles in the rain so my shoes wouldn't get ruined.

I thought that was love.

Turns out it was just him playing house.

""Don't dislike me...""

I repeated it, voice hollow.

""That's it? That's what you're giving me?""

He rubbed his temples, reached for my arm.

""Stop being dramatic. Mia had a sh!tty day at her gallery thing. She's upset. I need to go.""

""Stay here. Cool off.""

""When you're ready to act like an adult, we'll talk.""

He turned to leave.

His coat brushed my face as he passed.

""Ethan!""

I screamed at his back. ""You walk out that door, we're getting divorced!""

He stopped.

Didn't turn around.

""Don't threaten me with divorce. Without my family's money, you think you'll have it this good?""

""Stop acting like a child.""

The door slammed shut.

I knelt there on the floor, staring at the ruined cake.

Seven years of my life, smeared across a table like cheap frosting.

Screw this. Screw him.

They both wanted to play me for a fool?

Fine.

Let's see who breaks first.

I woke up fevering.

Maybe it was rage. Maybe it was spending all night on that cold floor.

Either way—fever spiked to 103. My body felt like it was roasting and freezing at the same time.

Half-conscious, I called Ethan out of habit.

Before, if I so much as sneezed, he'd drop everything—even international conference calls—and rush home.

The phone rang forever before someone picked up.

""Hello?""

Not Ethan's voice.

Mia's.

Soft. Sleepy. Dripping with that just-woke-up sweetness.

""Oh, hi Lily! Ethan's in the shower right now.""

Morning. Ethan. Showering at her place.

I bit down hard, forcing words out. ""Put him on.""

""Oh, don't be mad!"" Mia giggled. ""I spilled coffee on him yesterday—you know how he is about being clean. He crashed in the guest room. He's so thoughtful, you know? Took care of me all night. I'm exhausted.""

Every word was a knife.

""Mia."" My voice shook. ""Get. Him. Now.""

""What's going on?""

Ethan's voice cut in—low, rough from sleep.

Then Mia, all sugar: ""Ethan, I think Lily's mad. She's checking up on you\~""

""Lily?"" His tone went ice-cold. ""What now? It's barely 7 AM.""

Tears streamed down my face, soaking into my hair.

""Ethan. I have a fever. I feel like I'm dying. I need to go to the hospital.""

Even after everything I saw. Even after yesterday's blowout.

I still had this pathetic sliver of hope.

Seven years. You'd care about a dog after seven years, right?

Silence on his end for two seconds.

Then fabric rustling. His voice softened slightly. ""How high?""

""103.""

""Take some Tylenol. Have the driver take you.""

Still calm. Still controlled.

""Mia's got paintings to hang. She can't reach. I'll help her finish and head back.""

Paintings.

I was bu//rning alive and my husband was hanging another woman's art.

""Ethan..."" I could barely breathe. ""If I don't get to a hospital, I might actually die. I'm allergic to penicillin and we're out of—""

""Ah!""

Mia shrieked.

Something crashed.

""Mia! What happened?!""

Panic flooded his voice—panic I'd never heard directed at me.

""My hand—Ethan, the frame fell on it, it hurts so bad..."" She was crying now.

""Don't move! Let me see! You're bleeding—hold on, I'll bandage it right now!""

Chaos on the other end.

I'd been erased.

""Ethan...""

I wanted to scream that I was hurting too. That I was bleeding—my heart was bleeding.

The call ended.

I stared at the ceiling, watching the chandelier blur.

So that's how it was.

Mia's paper cut? Emergency.

My life-threatening fever? ""Stop being dramatic.""

I dragged myself up, stumbled toward the stairs.

Halfway down, everything went black.

I felt myself falling.

Pain exploded everywhere.

Right before I blacked out, I saw him.

Eighteen-year-old Ethan in his white school shirt, carrying me across the field after I'd twisted my ankle. Drenched in sweat, refusing to stop.

""Don't worry, Lily. I've got you. I'll never let you get hurt.""

Liar.

Ethan Blackwell, you lying piece of sh!t.

I woke up in a hospital bed.

Tried to move. Everything hurt like I'd been run over.

""You're awake?""

Ethan sat beside me, peeling an apple.

When he saw my eyes open, he cut a slice and held it to my lips, acting like yesterday never happened.

""How do you fall down stairs? Seriously?""

""Mild concussion. Fractured leg.""

""Lily, you're a grown woman. Can you stop giving me heart attacks?""

Scolding me. Like I was some reckless child.

I turned my head away from the apple.

""How's Mia's finger? All bandaged up?""

My voice came out flat.

Ethan's hand froze mid-air.

Then he tossed the apple in the garbage.

""How long are you planning to keep this up?""

""Mia hurt herself hanging paintings—her hands are her livelihood. She's an artist. And you? You had a fever. Did you really need to throw yourself down the stairs for attention?""

Attention.

I whipped my head around, locked eyes with him.

""Ethan. Did I not want to go to the hospital?""

""I begged you to come home. You said you had to help her hang paintings!""

""I was dying at the bottom of the stairs while you were comforting her!""

""Attention? I nearly killed myself and you think I was doing it for attention? You're not worth it.""

His face went dark.

He stood, looming over me.

""Watch your mouth, Lily.""

""I'm your husband.""

""Not for long."" I met his glare head-on. ""I'll have divorce papers sent over.""

""You wouldn't dare.""

He grabbed my jaw, fingers digging in so hard I thought my bones would crack.

Fury blazed in his eyes—and disbelief that I'd talk back.

""Where do you think you'll go? Back to your family who stopped caring about you years ago? Gonna sleep on the street?""

""Everything you have, I gave you! Your studio, your connections, every piece of clothing on your back!""

""Without me, Lily Hayes, what are you?""

I was top of my class at Columbia's architecture program.

I won international design awards.

I gave it all up for him. To be the perfect Mrs. Blackwell.

Turned down project after project, dimmed every bit of my light, and played housewife.

And now he was asking what I was worth.

""Let's find out.""

I pried his fingers off my face, each word deliberate.

""Let's see if I starve without you.""

""Fine. Perfect.""

Ethan laughed bitterly, straightening his wrinkled cuffs.

""Since you're so independent, let's see you prove it.""

""Cut off all her cards.""

He barked the order at his assistant in the doorway.

""Pull funding from her studio. Every project.""

""I want to see how long you last.""

He slammed the door on his way out.

Outside, I heard Mia's voice drifting in.

""Ethan, don't be upset... Lily's just sick, she didn't mean it... I made you soup...""

""You always know what I need.""

His voice went soft. Faded down the hall.

I closed my eyes.

Tears slid down my face.

The day I got discharged, nobody came to pick me up.

I hobbled out of the hospital on crutches, one agonizing step at a time.

Cards frozen. Phone payment declined.

I dug through my pockets and scraped together maybe forty bucks in change.

Caught a cab back to the house Ethan and I shared.

If I was leaving, I was taking my documents. And my parents' things.

I pushed open the door to laughter.

Mia sprawled on the couch in my silk pajamas, feeding Ethan grapes.

He stared at his laptop, occasionally opening his mouth for one. Looked at her like she was the only thing in the world.

When she saw me, she scrambled up—then ""accidentally"" tumbled into his arms.

""Oh! Lily, you're... you're back?""

Ethan caught her waist, glanced up at me.

Eyes cold. Like I was a stranger.

""Decided to come crawling back? Thought you were gonna tough it out forever.""

I ignored him, headed straight for the stairs.

""Stop.""

His voice cut through the room.

""Who said you could go up there?""

I turned. ""I'm getting my stuff.""

""There's nothing of yours here.""

He twisted a strand of Mia's hair around his finger, bored. ""Had it all thrown out.""

My ch//est seized.

""Thrown out? Ethan, my parents' things were up there! All my design drafts!""

""So?""

He smirked. ""I told you. This house doesn't keep dead weight. Or garbage.""

""Mia's moving in. Needed the closet space. Your junk was in the way.""

Junk.

My father's pocket watch—the only thing I had left of them. Sketches I'd spent sleepless nights perfecting.

Garbage. To make room for her.

Blood roared in my ears. I dropped the crutches and tore up the stairs.

The closet was empty.

Where my clothes used to hang, Mia's dresses filled every rack.

My desk. My easel. Gone.

Replaced by a white grand piano.

I stumbled to the balcony, looked down.

Black garbage bags piled by the garbage cans.

I could see the edges of my sketches poking out.

Soaked through. Ruined.

I flew down the stairs, crashed into the yard.

Ignored the screaming pain in my leg, tore open the bags.

Destroyed. All of it.

I clutched the shattered pocket watch, kneeling in the mud, sobbing.

""Ethan! You monster!""

""Give them back!""

Footsteps behind me.

Ethan stood under the eaves with an umbrella, Mia tucked against his side.

He frowned. Like I was being loud.

""Lily. Stop acting like garbage.""

""Some papers and a broken watch? I'll pay you back. What's the big deal?""

Mia burrowed into him, voice small. ""Ethan... she looks so sad. Did I do something wrong? Maybe I shouldn't have moved in...""

""Don't be stupid. This isn't about you.""

He kissed the top of her head.

""She's the one who doesn't know when to quit. Women like her need to learn their place.""

He looked down at me, eyes glacial.

""Lily. For old times' sake, I'll give you one last chance.""

""Apologize to Mia.""

""Promise you'll stop this tantrum. Be a good girl.""

""Then you can come back. Stay Mrs. Blackwell.""

""Otherwise...""

He kicked mud toward me.

""Take your garbage and get off my property.""

Rain pounded down harder.

My stitches must've ripped. Pain shot through my leg.

But I didn't feel cold anymore.

Because my heart was already dead.

I stood slowly, clutching the broken watch.

Wiped rain off my face. Looked at the perfect couple under their dry little umbrella.

And I laughed.

""Ethan.""

""You think I want to be Mrs. Blackwell?""

""You think I can't survive without you?""

I limped toward them, dragging my bu//sted leg.

Ethan actually stepped back. Like the hate in my eyes scared him.

""What are you doing?""

Crack.

I slapped him across the face with everything I had.

His head snapped sideways. Red bloomed on his cheek.

Mia shrieked. ""You hit him!""

""Shut your mouth. Nobody asked you.""

Crack. Backhanded her too.

She crumpled, sobbing into her hands.

Ethan finally snapped. Raised his hand. ""Lily! You're dead—""

I lifted my chin, stared him down.

""Do it!""

""Ethan Blackwell, if you don't kill me today, I swear—one day, you'll both be on your knees. And I'll make you pay back every single thing you did to me. A hundred times over.""

His hand froze mid-air.

For a second, I saw panic flicker in his eyes.

I spat blood at his feet.

""Remember what you said today, Ethan.""

""I don't know my place. I don't know when to quit.""

""From now on, you and I? And your whole family?""

""We're done.""

1qqi2se,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qqi2se,"Heavy haul – varsity jackets, patchwork pants, and side-button tracks. Which one you picking?s","1. Beats x Kim Kardashian Studio Pro (Dune/Earth)
A solid tech accessory if you're into that tonal, minimalist look. The color is ""Dune,"" and it actually looks better in person than in the renders—very low-key and high-end. Sound-wise, they’re standard Studio Pros (heavy bass, decent ANC), but you’re really buying these for the Kim K aesthetic.Great for the ""clean girl/boy"" desk setup.

Score: 8/10

2. Chrome Hearts Patchwork Varsity Jacket (Black/Black)
This is a heavy hitter. The all-black leather sleeves and the cross patches give it a very dark, avant-garde vibe. However, objectively speaking, it’s a lot of branding. If you aren't careful, the sheer number of patches can look a bit ""busy"" or over-the-top for a casual fit. Quality feels substantial, though.Hard to pull off without looking like you’re trying too hard, but high quality.

Score: 7.5/10

3. Chrome Hearts x Matty Boy (?) Red/White Varsity
This is easily my favorite piece of the entire haul. The red is incredibly vibrant, and the contrast with the cream/white sleeves is just classic. It has that vintage collegiate energy but with the luxury edge. It pops way more than the all-black version and feels like a genuine statement piece rather than just another ""hype"" item.Absolute grail. The colorway is 10/10.

Score: 9.5/10

4. Nike x Brazil CBF GORE-TEX Jacket (Mint)
This is a very specific vibe. The mint green color is refreshing, and the sponsor logos (Vivo, Itau) give it that authentic training-kit feel. It’s practical because of the GORE-TEX, but the color might be a bit difficult to style with anything other than black or neutral tech-wear.Great for rainy days or pitch-side, but a bit niche for daily wear.

Score: 7/10

5. Polo Ralph Lauren Harrington Jacket (Tan)
The ""Old Money"" essential. Compared to the Chrome Hearts stuff, this is incredibly plain, but that’s the point. The fit is boxy and classic. My only gripe is that it can look a bit ""dad-ish"" if the rest of your outfit isn't tailored well. It's a safe, reliable mid-layer.Timeless, but lacks the ""wow"" factor of the other pieces.

Score: 8/10 (for utility)

6 & 7. Chrome Hearts Hoodies (White/Black)
Standard fare here. The white one is a clean pullover with the horseshoe logo, while the black zip-up has the thermal-style floral/cross sleeve print. Honestly? They’re hoodies. They look cool, but they’re definitely ""uniform"" pieces for the brand. The white one is going to be a nightmare to keep clean.Essential for the rotation, but nothing revolutionary.

Score: 7.5/10

8. Chrome Hearts Cross Patch Chinos (Khaki)
I wanted to like these more, but the patch placement feels a little random. The khaki color is a nice break from the usual black denim, but the patches make them hard to wear to anything even slightly formal. They are definitely more of a ""streetwear"" take on a classic trouser.Cool detail, but limited versatility.

Score: 6.5/10

9. Chrome Hearts Side-Button Track Pants (White)
These are definitely a ""statement"" bottom. The silver button detailing down the side is a nice touch, and the triple cross embroidery on the thigh is classic CH. However, all-white track pants are a massive risk—one coffee spill and it’s over. They lean very heavily into that luxury-leisure aesthetic, which can look a bit ""pajama-like"" if not styled with the right shoes.High-risk, high-reward. Great for a summer flex, but be careful where you sit.

Score: 7/10

10 & 11. Ralph Lauren ""Polo Bear"" Sweaters (White & Navy)
You can’t go wrong with these. The Polo Bear is a streetwear icon in its own right. The white one with the flag sweater bear is super clean, while the navy one has that classic varsity/collegiate bear. Objectively, these are the most ""wearable"" items in the whole haul. They fit perfectly into a ""Quiet Luxury"" or ""Ivy"" look.Absolute staples. They’ll never go out of style.

Score: 8.5/10

12. Fox Racing Motocross Jersey (Teal/Black)
This one feels a bit left-field compared to the Chrome Hearts and Polo pieces. The ""Motocore"" trend is still a thing, and the teal/black color blocking is bold. It’s a very lightweight, mesh-style material—great for breathability. Honestly, it feels a bit like a costume unless you’re actually riding or going for a very specific Y2K tech-wear look.A bit niche. Cool for a specific fit, but lacks the versatility of the other pieces.

Looking for feedback!,"I'm not sure if this is the right place for this type of post but I've been working on a music discovery app for the last 3 weeks after speaking with my friend who's been DJing for a few years now and has definitely influenced some of my music taste. Happy to share my progress and ask for feedback on my first mobile app: Sona.

Sona is a music discovery app powered by people and places, not algorithms.  
Website: [https://sonafm.com](https://sonafma.com/)

We were talking about how discovering music feels so algorithmic lately. Our feeds are always trying to push us specific sounds and content that may not be what we want to see or hear. Or even worse, I thought about where I've found ""newer"" music and the answer was pretty simple: through people and places. I love discovering new music out in the real world, whether that's at a local cafe in the city or while I'm out at a DJ set. Yes, Shazam is a thing and a cool tool but I feel like discovering new music is a lot more than just ""audio detection."" Sometimes I want to remember where I heard it or with who.

With the right usage, I thought it would be pretty cool to have this global guide where you can see what's being played where and by who or keep up with people whose taste you trust. Or even see what specific bars and cafes are playing. Music discovery through people, not algorithms. And if you don't want another ""social media"" app, then you can always opt-in to keep your profile and your discoveries private from viewing. What you'll have is still a pretty cool app (I think) for music logging and map of your own discoveries.

Tech Stack:  
\- SwiftUI for the UI  
\- Supabase for the backend  
\- ShazamKit for audio recognition  
\- MapKit for venue detection  
\- Lots of back and forth with Claude Code

I’m 22, hailing from a tiny, blink-and-you’ll-miss-it county in the Pacific Northwest. If you’ve ever seen those movies where everything is misty, smells like pine needles, and feels like a cryptid is watching you from behind a Douglas fir... yeah, that’s my backyard. I grew up in a town so small that our biggest ""scandal"" for three years was someone painting the water tower neon pink overnight. (Spoiler: it was my cousin, and he still won't admit it).
Honestly, I’m at that weird ""in-between"" stage of life. I graduated a year ago, moved back home to save some cash, and realized that my childhood bedroom feels a lot smaller than it used to. By day, I’m working a remote data-entry job that’s about as exciting as watching grass grow, but by night, I’m a total nerd for vintage film photography and urban legends.
Living out here in the sticks, you see some weird stuff. Last October, I found a 1970s Polaroid camera at a garage sale. When I developed the roll that was still inside (don't ask how it survived), the last photo was a shot of my own front door... taken thirty years before I was born. It’s been sitting on my desk for months, and I still can't explain it.

1qqhzyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheHallowdineLibrary/comments/1qqhzyu/faerie_stew/,Faerie Stew,"It felt almost appropriate to begin this tale with “Once upon a time”. Yet such a flippant beginning wouldn’t do justice to the grisly sorrow that festers beneath these words. I considered that instead I should offer a sort of warning, a ‘caveat emptor’ for the content of this story, so that you might avoid that sickening lurch in your stomach, the wrench which so often accompanies macabre revelations.  
But that would ruin the story for you. And I am quite cognisant about why you goodfolk read these vicious little vignettes.  
You want to be shocked. You want near-erotic tremors of terror to quaver through your central nervous system; you desire the tsunami of fear that swamps the beach of your eager brain.  
In which case, allow me to oblige you.

   
It always starts with a mother. We all start with a mother, no matter how we begin, or where we end. Mothers are the force that weave the substance of *life* into being; their curious uterine sorcery binding inert matter and potential energy into a living, breathing child.  
There is no greater magic in this entire universe.  
My own mother seemed most acutely aware of this, possessing only just enough of that divine gift to produce precisely one heir. From a very early age, I knew that she had spent everything she had to quicken me inside her, and that the cost of her motherly labours meant her body would never bear another child.  
“You are my firstborn, my onlyborn,” she would sing to me, as she smoothed my near-white baby curls between her fingers, her voice queer with emotions I couldn’t comprehend at that age.  
She was a strange woman and had few friends. People whispered behind her back that she was a lesbian or a transsexual, for she was taller than any man I’ve ever met, and she carried herself like a queen. She never spoke of my father, but the rumour amongst the other children at school was that the masculine spark required to start my life had been purchased via the internet, from a donor of impeccable pedigree.  
“Men matter little in the equation of life,” she told me when I did ask, “the magic is within the mother.”  
For some reason, her answer completely satisfied my curiosity about my paternal parentage, and I never asked her about it again.

   
Tradition and order ruled our household, with few deviations from my mother’s planned path. She seemed innately aware of a child’s need for routine, and I was especially needy in that respect. From the moment I woke until the minute my head hit the pillow at night, my home life was as rigid and regular as the wrought iron rails of a church fence. Perhaps I needed such regimentation because I lacked a father – or perhaps because my mother was so asocial – but whatever the reason, it became a signature of who I was.  
Teachers always knew I would complete my homework and assignments; that whatever they asked of Shy Shea, it would be done. On reflection, I was as perfect as a child could possibly be; like a creature stepped from a fairy tale. Fair-skinned and flaxen-haired, always polite, never contrary, teachers often commented on what a joy I was in their classrooms – to which my mother would reply:  
“Or course she is. She is my firstborn, my onlyborn.”  
And the teacher would give a nervous little laugh, hoping that this was some sort of familial joke.  
But my mother never laughed along.

   
When your life is so driven by order and routine, things which might seem odd to others are utterly ordinary to you. Only when I reached an age where I wanted to ‘hang out’ with my friends did I begin to realise how unusual I truly was. Their lives seemed so *chaotic*, so disordered. No wonder Joanne couldn’t finish her homework; her household contained three other children, and her guardians were less parents than flustered zookeepers. To my eyes, their home seemed poised upon the very edge of crisis, six lives teetering on the brink of dissolution – with one poorly timed accident able to bring the whole family down.  
And yet, they managed. Somehow, some thread of order bound their lives together just enough that catastrophe did not visit. I didn’t understand it, but came to realise it was a kind of magic all of its own; by all rights these people *shouldn’t* be able to exist like this, yet they did.  
Conversely, my few friends found my own home life oppressively claustrophobic.  
“How can you *live* like this?” Sandy groused. “You even eat the same meals every day of every week.”  
“I guess I’m used to it,” I offered lamely, not knowing what else to say.  
The truth of it was that I was more than just used to it – I *liked* it.  
“I don’t know how your mum does it, being a nurse and all,” Carrie told me, “my aunt works at the hospital, and she can barely keep two cats alive.”  
“If mum said she didn’t want to work a shift, I don’t think anyone would argue with her,” I confided. Carrie and Sandy both nodded without thinking. After all, they had met her.  
My mother was more than just uncommonly tall, she had a way with other people. When she entered a room, everyone knew she was there; an invisible silver wire pulling their heads in her direction. When she spoke, people truly *listened*, nodding along in agreement to nearly anything she said.  
I couldn’t figure out why she wasn’t more social – she was everything I wanted to be when I grew up. She was beautiful, regal, erudite and captivating, and could have had any man she wanted – or any woman, for that matter. But her bed in the room across from mine remained empty, narrow and single, no room for anyone but her, and sometimes space for a child with recurring nightmares about drowning in crimson darkness.

   
“Mama, when will you teach me how to make faerie stew?” I asked for the hundredth time.  
“When you’re old enough, Sweet Shea,” she always replied.  
The meal had come once a month ever since I could remember. My mother fussed over it for the better part of an entire afternoon, shooing me out of the kitchen as I circled around like an annoying blowfly, trying to peer into steaming pots and spitting pans. Over the years, I had concluded that faerie stew was little more than leftovers and freezer-burned meat fancied up into a well-spiced stew. Indeed, it probably wasn’t special at all.  
Still, it remained my favourite familial meal, and whenever I was particularly hungry or tired, I’d daydream about the rich brown gravy and tender morsels of meat that swam in the well-seasoned concoction.  
Like every other part of my life, it seemed ordinary, and I assumed all families had some variant of it. It never really occurred to me that it was anything more than a mundane meal; a means for my clever mother to empty the refrigerator.  
The first clue came the month she pulled me out of school camp early and brought me home, just for faerie stew. I didn’t complain, of course – the food at camp had been predictably awful, and I was more than happy to eat my favourite hearty home-cooked meal.  
“Some family rituals are sacred,” she explained to me, ladling the thick stew into a copper bowl, “and this is ours.”  
But something about the intensity of her voice made the flesh on my arms prickle queerly, and I wondered for the first time what *exactly* was in that rich broth.  
It was time that I found out what was in faerie stew.

   
Seventeen is a tumultuous year for any young woman, and I was no exception. Despite my intentions to delve into the mystery of the fey food my mother made, life had become far too full for me to fixate on that little mystery. Time ebbed and flowed, Christmas came and went, with my eighteenth birthday roaring up fast behind it. I don’t know why I’d assumed mama would divulge the secrets of faerie stew on the eve of that auspicious event. But when she didn’t, I found myself petulant, peevish – an emotional state I rarely experienced.  
I was going to find out, regardless of my mother’s intentions.  
Hiding my phone between carefully arranged cook books wasn’t difficult, and through that stealthy lens I could watch a live stream on my laptop, hidden safely in my room while my mother fussed in the kitchen.  
Much of the preparation seemed to be ritualistic to her, with a sort of comforting cadence that nearly lulled me to sleep as I watched. But when several small, mystery packets of frozen meat were extracted from the back of the freezer, I began to feel that there really was something decidedly *off* about the whole scenario. I couldn’t be certain, but the markings on those mystery parcels didn’t look like they had originated from any supermarket. In my limited view, one of them bore a partial sticker that resembled the logo on my mother’s hospital pass.  
I tried to eat the stew with the same ordinary delight I always had, schooling myself that I’d eaten it all my life without any ill effect, so it mustn’t be marinated in malice.  
Yet I couldn’t help but speculate what the morsels of meat were, even as they slid down my throat, so tender, so *tasty*.

   
The first of the mystery meats appeared in our freezer a few days later, cunningly concealed inside a bag of frozen peas. The palm-sized package was scarlet with frozen blood and stamped with a biohazard symbol, but other than that, nothing identified what it was.  
*Human remains*, my brain informed me as my stomach churned, *you’ve been eating human remains.*  
Even as I battled the icy nausea that spooled up my spine and tickled the back of my throat with cold fingers, the rational part of my mind picked at the problem, trying to unriddle *what* kind of meat might be contained inside.  
I knew that my mother was a theatre nurse, so she attended various surgeries, but I’d never truly been interested enough to delve any deeper. The fact that she never had friends or colleagues over meant that I’d never overheard any casual work-oriented conversation – and she never confided in me about her job, except to complain about personality conflicts; all of which she eventually won.  
It was time to find out exactly what my mother did at the hospital.

   
Putting the pieces together from there wasn’t particularly difficult. Two more frozen parcels arrived, a week apart, and when my mother left her work phone unattended, I checked her calendar for each of those days.  
On each of those days, a half-day appointment showed, labelled with the acronym ‘TOP’.  
I think I already knew somehow, even before I plugged the term into Google and hit search. I think perhaps that through the frozen plastic, I’d glimpsed tiny, frosted-red fingers and toes, or perhaps the flattened features of a tiny face. But my brain had refused to let me believe it until I could confirm it.  
You see, the acronym means *Termination of Pregnancy*.  
For my entire life, once a month, I had been eating aborted foetuses.  
The horror was immediate and visceral. Everything in my stomach rushed out in a torrent onto the carpet, so forceful that it sprayed from my burning nostrils and spattered the keyboard with brown liquid. The retching didn’t stop until I was too weak to continue, replaced by a blinding headache pounding behind my eyes, strained from the heaving and gagging.  
The shower ran until the hot water petered out, then I shut it off and sat on the cooling metal floor, wet tendrils of hair snaking around me.  
Why had she done it? *Why* had my perfect mother been feeding me this abominable broth my entire life?  
Before I did anything else, I had to find out. I had to *know* exactly why she had done it before I turned her in to the police.

   
It had always been impossible to hide anything from her as a child, and as a particularly angelic child with few secrets and little guile, I’d never really needed to try. And so, when I confronted her as she pushed open our brass-bound front door, I think she already knew that I knew.  
Placing her bag on its hook in the hall, she ducked under the doorframe – the habit of a lifetime for such a tall woman – and carefully arranged herself in her flower-print chair near the window.  
“Because you are my firstborn, my onlyborn,” she said, pre-empting my question, “because without the power of those children, you could not exist.”  
“I don’t understand.”  
“Then I will help you to understand.”  
As she sat in her pretty chair, a tall, forty-something woman greying at the temples, something *changed*. Her crow’s feet blurred to nothing, and the creases around her lips faded away. The steel-threaded hair became white-blonde, and her eyes pale gold, like those of a pedigree cat.  
“Most of our people are gone now, their power lost through the ages. The essence of humanity has always sustained us, pacts made that fuelled our power. Those bargains echo through the old stories; tales such as Rumplestiltskin, where we offered greatness in exchange for one simple thing – the magic of a firstborn human.”  
She turned her leonine eyes to gaze out the lace-curtained window, smiling a smile of feline teeth, perfect and predatory.  
“The tales spread, and they grew wise to us, the mortal women, and they ceased to offer up their bounty so eagerly. But there are other ways to extract a mother’s firstborn – and there are so many mothers now who don’t want their babies.”  
“The abortions,” I managed, bile rising in my throat.  
“Yes.”  
We gazed at each other in silence for a long time, a strangeness of unspoken understanding passing between us; a kind of communication that only our kind can have. My mother’s ears pricked through her hair, pointed like a devil’s, and I knew mine could look the same, should I shed the shell of humanity she’d curated around me with mundane habits and banal rituals.  
But she’d kept the secret too long, made too much of a mortal of me.  
“I won’t eat any more,” I told her, even as I wanted to cry, “I cannot be like you.”  
Sorrow creased her brow as she stepped forward and kissed my forehead.  
“Then my firstborn, my onlyborn, you will die.”

 

  


   
I left her there, calling the police as I walked out of the house. That was nothing more than a futile gesture, I realised; if she could ensorcel mortal women to forget about the remains of their aborted firstborn, I had no doubt that law enforcement could be easily swayed by her powers.  
The women’s boarding house was crowded, and the room was tiny, but as I got to know the others, I realised one of the other homeless waifs was a girl I went to school with – Sarah.  
“I saw your mother a couple of years ago,” she babbled as we hunched on a battered sofa in the common room, “I never knew she did abortions until I woke up and saw her face. She was really kind to me, she even helped me with all the paperwork.” She smiled at the memory, her usually-downcast eyes far away and full of light. “I’m so glad there are people like her who do that for desperate young women, you know? God knows, I’ve proved I can’t even look after myself, let alone a poor little baby.”  
There was no sickness this time, no vomit to surge onto the already vomit-coloured carpet. The stuff of her child was long since absorbed, part of the thing I am.  
But I don’t know how much longer I’ll be around.  
The months pass, and I grow thin without the faerie stew to sustain me. As my clothes loosen, so does my substance, and little pieces of me keep falling away. A finger here, a toe there. Soon my left hand will be gone, and the last of my teeth will spill across my ragged pillow, fading away to smoke as the sun rises over the boarding house.  
I know I could stop it. I can just go home. I can sup of the sweet stew that my mother is surely brewing in the kitchen even now. Sometimes I’m sure I smell it on the wind.  
But I can’t. I won’t. Will that first bite contain the child of the woman sleeping in the next bunk, the one who made me coffee this morning?  
This price is right, for whose am I, really? I am all of theirs, and the price must be paid by me; her firstborn, her onlyborn.

1qqhzv8,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCreativeContent/comments/1qqhzv8/custom_ai_3d_figure_customization_checklist_hair/,"Custom AI 3D Figure Customization Checklist: Hair, Skin Tone, Outfit, Accessories, and Base Options","Creating your own custom AI 3D figure is like capturing your essence in miniature form—it’s personal, detailed, and just plain fun. Whether you're gifting one to a friend or designing your alter ego for display, knowing what details to focus on can make all the difference. Here's a simple yet essential checklist to help you bring your custom figure to life.

**1. Hair Customization**

Hair plays a huge role in expressing personality. From curly locks and sleek ponytails to buzz cuts and flowing waves, you can choose the exact style that represents you best. Pay attention to the color as well—natural tones like black, blonde, and auburn are popular, but don't shy away from bold shades like purple or teal if that’s your vibe.

**2. Skin Tone Options**

Diversity matters, and thankfully, today’s custom AI 3D figures come with a wide range of skin tone options. From light porcelain to deep mocha, the goal is authenticity. Some platforms allow you to submit reference photos to get the exact tone that matches your unique complexion.

**3. Outfit Selection**

The outfit is where your figure’s style truly shines. Want to go casual in jeans and a hoodie? Or maybe rock a fantasy warrior suit or business professional attire? Whatever the look, make sure it reflects either your real-world fashion or your imaginative flair. Seasonal options and themed clothing can add even more personality.

**4. Accessories Make It Personal**

Accessories can completely change the vibe of your figure. Glasses, headphones, backpacks, jewelry, and even tiny props like coffee cups or books can enhance your figure’s identity. These add-ons might seem small, but they speak volumes about hobbies, lifestyle, and personality.

**5. The Right Base**

Choosing the right base gives your figure a proper stage. Bases can be minimalistic, textured, or themed—like grass, wood, or even futuristic platforms. They provide stability and a finished look that elevates the entire piece.

When building a **custom AI 3D figure**, think of it as crafting a digital version of your story. Each option on this checklist is a chapter—each detail adds depth and meaning. The result? A mini-you (or someone else) that’s unmistakably unique and 100% personalized.

Start with what feels most “you,” and the rest will come naturally. From hair to base, every choice is a piece of the puzzle.",1,1769714021.0,TheCreativeContent,0,1.0,False

After living in SF for 10 years and now mainly working from home (friends have moved, settled down in other areas) I would love to cultivate a local group here, specifically but not limited to other guys who are maybe married, into their careers, and are either planning to or don't yet have kids (but totally fine if you do!).

In the past as a car and motorcycle enthusiast, forums were great ways to establish a local spot to meet up on a weekly/monthly basis so I find myself back on Reddit. I can't imagine I'm the only guy in the area who wants to connect with other dudes where parenting isn't the only common thread. Aside from vintage cars/motorcycles, I recently got myself a gravel bike and notched my first year of golf. I workout regularly, frequent vibey spots like Voyage and The Lumberyard, hardcore/metal shows, road trips, estate sales, and DIY'ing just about anything after watching a YouTube video.

Hoping this gets some traction as the ladies version of this post has been a huge success (just ask my wife!). Would love to meet folks in Marin for coffee, beer, whatever works.",6,1769713932.0,Marin,8,0.8,False
1qqhxw5,https://i.redd.it/dynxi6pl7cgg1.png,"Punta Mita Insider: Why your luxury villa experience depends on the ""Premier"" details","I’ve spent a lot of time managing high end estates here in Punta Mita, and I’ve noticed a huge gap between a ""nice house"" and a true ultra luxury experience. Many travelers book a beautiful home only to realize they are missing the keys to the kingdom once they arrive.

If you’re planning a trip to the gates of Punta Mita in 2026, here is what I consider the ""non negotiable"" checklist to ensure you actually get the 5 star experience you’re paying for:

1. The Membership Tier: This is the big one. Always confirm the villa has Premier Membership. Without it, you’re locked out of the best spots. It’s the difference between staying in a house and having full access to Kupuri, El Surf Club, and the Jack Nicklaus courses
2. Internal Logistics: The peninsula is larger than it looks. A luxury stay isn't complete without a dedicated 6 passenger golf cart ready at the door. It’s the local ""limo"" and you shouldn't have to worry about renting one separately
3. The Service Ecosystem: A true luxury rental should function like a boutique hotel. We’ve found that having a dedicated house manager and a chef who understands ""farm to table"" is what guests remember more than the high thread count sheets 
4. Beyond the Gates: It’s about the ""frictionless"" arrival. From pre stocked pantries with your specific coffee brand to curated itineraries before you even land.

I'm curious, for those who frequent Punta Mita or similar like Kona or Cabo, what’s the one ""gate access"" or service detail that made your trip?""",2,1769713902.0,LuxuryTravel,0,1.0,False

1qqhvgk,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1qqhvgk/our_month_1_overview/,Our Month 1 Overview,"My husband and I started calorie counting (accidentally) on the 1st of January. It was not part of a ""New Year Resolution"", but rather just a further step into bettering our health that has rolled over from the year before.

  
A year ago, my husband was around 300 pounds. I yo-yoed around 248 pounds. We moved and cleaned up our diet, focusing on whole foods, from scratch meals and limited industrial processed foods. Eating out was (and is) a rare treat.

  
Last year, our 4th child was born in July. I gained 5 pounds during my pregnancy, and so my highest weight in my life was 253 pounds. While I have always frequently checked my weight (even as it has slowly keot creeping up), my husband has not. I told him he should check his weight as it looked like he was losing weight, but he just casually said it wasn't important to him.

  
Some extended family health issues made me painfully aware that if I don't lose weight, I am going to struggle immensely as I get older. I don't care about what I look like, but I do care about how my body feels. I want to have healthy older years, and expresses my worries to my husband. He agreed that he has been concerned about himself as well, and so we started watching our portions sizes more in the lead-up to Thanksgiving last year. I was slowly losing weight from having our baby, and got down to 240 pounds.

  
Our plan was to start calorie counting the day after Christmas, but we all woke up Christmas morning with the flu. We didn't really start feeling better until January 1st.

  
I opted to weigh myself, and found that I was 238 pounds. I had no expectations that my husband would weigh himself as well, but he called me to the room to confirm what he saw on the scale - 280 pounds! He had dropped 20 pounds over the course of the year. This was very exciting for him.

  
He works from home and I am a stay-at-home mom to our 4 children. We would both say that we are fairly sedentary. He sits at a desk, I'm working with our children and cooking. There is no regular exercise. During the warmer months we are outside in the garden, but it being winter we rarely go outside (it is mostly cold and muddy). We eat almost all of our meals together, and we eat almost all the same meals. I am also exclusively breastfeeding our youngest, so our TDEEs are pretty close. My husband is a snacker while I am not, and so he figured out how to work that into his macros.

  
Our first week, I averaged a daily deficit of 846 and he averaged 721. We definitely experienced a major flush, as we got rid of liquid calories (except for our morning Cuban coffee), and both dropped 10 pounds.

  
Our second week, our oldest son had his birthday. This was celebrated across 2 separate days, and those two days were both far closer to maintenance for us. However, our average across the week was 509 for my husband and 517 for me. We continued losing weight rapidly.

  
Our third week was where we really diverged. My husband had a big work week, so I was tracking his calories for him. He averaged a daily deficit of 497 while I averaged 718.

  
Finally, our fourth week! His average deficit has been 533 and mine has been 714. This has made our monthly average 565 for him and 699 for me.

  
But what does the scale say? We have weighed every morning. This morning he weighed in at 258 pounds! So 22 pounds dropped in the first month. I weighed in at 220 pounds, for a total of 18 pounds lost!

  
We are well aware that this rapid loss will not continue, and are counting on seeing a 1-2 pound drop a week after this month (barring any plateaus) as long as we continue with our deficits.

  
So what have we done? Besides staying in a calorie deficit, we have aimed for minimum protein and fiber goals. I have aimed for 25g fiber, but frequently get over 30g (and sometimes over 35g). My husband aims for 30g, but as someone with colitis is happy with 25g. He has had 0 flare-ups this month. His heartburn has also disappeared! We get at least 1.2g/kg of our goal weight. For my husband, that translates to 99.8g protein minimum daily and for me that means 81.3g protein minimum daily. Besides that, we do also try to hit our calcium minimums (especially me as a breastfeeding mom). I also got a mini stair stepper that I use sometimes when the kids go to bed.

  
As long as we meet those minimums, there is no food that is off limit. We've enjoyed everything from (homemade) birthday cake to Waffle House to popcorn to cheesecake. There are no ""cheat days"" or ""cheat meals"", just lifestyle changes. We have learned some of our patterns. Like I prefer a big dinner, he likes having snacks. He is prone to overeating during busy work weeks, so keeping low calorie snacks on hand are better. I feel a strong desire to binge if I don't get at least 90g protein a day. Most importantly, having someone who supports and believes in your success goes a long way.",4,1769713761.0,loseit,1,1.0,False

Afterwards, I dressed, quiet and quick. He was perched on the corner of the bed, smoking and staring at the floor. 

""Did you want to--""

Mike stood up and walked out the room. The bathroom door clicked shut. The hiss of the shower.

Perhaps he didn't hear me.

###

Mike came home late. 

At the door, I greeted him with a smile. He became annoyed because I couldn't conceal my sadness.

""You're upset,"" he said, walking past me into the house. 

""You said six.""

""Maybe,"" he said. ""Why's it matter, Sarah?""

I looked to the kitchen. Dinner was cooked, but it had already gone cold. 

""I don't know.""

He frowned. ""Okay."" 

Then, he went upstairs. A door slammed somewhere in the house. 

I curled up on the sofa under a blanket. 

*Why did he smell like that?*

###

Pancakes. He pushed a stack in front of me. Then, he turned back to the stove.

""You didn't come to bed.""

I didn't answer. Just watched the little motes of dust sparkle in the red morninglight. 

""I'm sorry,"" he said, sitting opposite and pouring a cup of coffee. 

""It's okay.""

He nodded, knowing it wasn't. 

""When will you be back tonight?""

He shrugged, pushed a wedge of food into his mouth and chewed.

""Shall I cook?""

""No, I'll eat out."" 

""Okay.""

A glance at his watch, a final gulp of his drink, then he left.

I cleaned away our dishes. My meal, uneaten.

###

It was dark when he returned. I heard the car rumble up the driveway then sigh when he cut the engine. 

The front door opened then slammed. Mike's footsteps sounded clumsy, uneven.

*Drunk*.

I shook my head and rolled over so my back faced the bedroom door. I took in a deep breath and listened, hoping his footsteps would stop and he'd pass out on the sofa rather than take to the stairs.

More footsteps. A low grunt. And...the sound of something being dragged. 

I sat up and turned on the bedside lamp. 

More strange noises from downstairs.

""Mike?"" 

Silence. 

I threw off the covers, approached the door and grabbed the handle.

""Sarah!"" 

I froze.

""Yes?""

""Don't come down.""

I let go of the door handle. Slowly backed away.

*It must be happening again.*

""Okay,"" I said, though I doubt he heard.

I crept back into bed, put my ear buds in and closed my eyes so tight it hurt. 

*Please be quick this time.*

###

In the morning, I could see where he'd cleaned the dirt from the hallway carpet. With some bleach, I managed to work out the more stubborn stains. I was at least grateful he hadn't kept it in the house. Must've headed off before sunrise to rebury it.

I didn't see him all day. I didn't mind. I had things to do. Medication to pick up.

The doctor was reluctant to prescribe more antibiotics. He stared at me for a long time before finally signing the paper.

""We rarely see this kind of infection,"" he said. Disgust in his eyes.

""Okay.""

I could tell he wanted to ask me a question, but decided to ask something safer. ""Are you practicing safe sex?""

I scoffed, then felt a sickly pinch in my gut. ""I'm married.""

""Yes..."" He nodded absently. A shadow swept across his face. Then, he pressed out a smile and handed me the slip. ""This will help with the discomfort and keep the bacteria at bay. Though, we really need to figure out why this keeps coming back.""

I blew out a shaking breath and nodded. I left quickly, then cried in the car. The receptionist knocked on the car window, grimacing at the sight of my grief. In my haste, I'd left my handbag. She apologised. For what, I don't know. 

I drove around for an hour before heading home. Thankfully, he wasn't there when I returned.

###

At dinner, Mike asked me a haunted question. 

He hadn't long returned and, from the dirt smeared across his face, I knew where he'd been.

""I want you to meet her,"" he said, eventually breaking our silence.

I dropped my fork. A breath caught in my throat. ""What?""

""She's outside. In the car."" 

He reached a hand out to mine. I withdrew.

""Why is this happening again? I thought you burned it.""

""*It*?""

There was an edge to his voice. His hand curled into a fist. His jaw clenched tight.

I looked down at my plate. ""What do you want me to do?""

""I'd like you to allow me to bring her inside.""

I let out an incredulous laugh. ""Inside? Didn't you do that last night? Why *now* are you concerned with my feelings on the matter?""

I stood up and turned to leave. 

""*Sarah*.""

I froze, then turned to meet his stare. 

""I'm asking if you could join us.""

*Join? This was madness, was it not? He was sick and growing sicker. How could I continue to allow this, to entertain this?*

""Please,"" he said with those same soft eyes from years forgotten, ""I want to share this with you. Because I love you.""

*If I said yes, would he really love me again?* I doubted it. Love: just another hole to throw my soul in. I *certainly* picked them.

Why? Why was I not...enough? Maybe she was skinnier than me. Had fuller lips or perkier tits. 

I shuddered at the prospect of cold and grey skin between us. Limbs loosely flopping at strange angles while Mike grunted and whispered in our ears.

I wondered what he'd expect me to do. Simply watch or...participate. 

""So..."" he said, lifting my face gently to look at him, ""can I bring her inside?""

My heart ached, knowing there was only one answer.

""Sure.""

A smile split his face. Boyish excitement and giddy movements. He rubbed those filthy hands together.

""Great. Set a seat at the table. I'll get her out of the trunk.""",12,1769713716.0,shortscarystories,4,1.0,False

You make the world 🌎 go around, and with no appreciation or recognition.  I really value what you've chosen to do for loved ones, and if you have any ideas for me, I would benefit from them.  Understand you are so busy!

TLDR: looking for ideas to help MIL/FIL.

My MIL is now moderate w/dementia in AD. She's 83 yo and ambulatory, about 6 years in to dx.  She lives with FIL, also 83 yo, who is holding up well.  Married 60+ yrs. She is frustrated & aggressive and agitated to him at times - sundowner. Needs his help, also. She will not go to doctor about it, and we can't mention it - this ruled out medical intervention.

My husband and I visit from Midwest every couple of months for 4-5 days. FIL really appreciates our visits, I cook breakfast and do dishes & laundry, clean the house and I also take over ""mom-watch"" while the boys go out for a beer or coffee, or tackle his appointments. He needs time w/his son. I take her to church, which she still enjoys, and on daily walks, and read her stories and tell stories. I see it getting worse.

I want to be able to help Dad as things progress, and FIL is just not a guy who asks for help easily. They go out to eat a lot, she used to cook meals. I did suggest that we could cook them 14 meals w/4 servings each to freeze, for 28 dinners/lunches.  He agreed to that!  Hurrah!   Any other ideas about things that help at this stage?  They are aging in place.

the ""little monster vs big monster"" idea that physical withdrawal is apparently pretty mild, but the mental story (""I deserve one,"" ""I can't handle stress without it"") is the real enemy. helped me stop treating cravings like emergencies.

also the tight shoes analogy, smoking creates the discomfort then relieves it, and we think that relief is pleasure.

**practical stuff from the notes:**

cutting caffeine in half when you quit (nicotine affects how fast you metabolize it, so your coffee suddenly hits way harder)

small frequent meals instead of skipping, apparently we've been using nicotine to suppress hunger and manage blood sugar, so you gotta retrain that

the cue extinction thing where you deliberately do trigger activities (coffee, driving, finishing a meal) *without* smoking, just to let your brain learn new associations

a ""conscious last cigarette/vape hit"" where you really focus on how gross it actually tastes/feels/smells instead of autopilot

**what I'm hoping to crowdsource:**

does any of this line up with what actually helped you? what worked that nobody told you about beforehand?

We met in AP Macroeconomics, and before a project presentation proposal she came up to me and complimented my outfit. I always thought she was cute, but I had never really spoke to her outside of my job at the local gym we both went to. 

(3y ago)

In high school, we would often skip class together, get coffee after school, etc.. We weren’t anything more than friends at this point, but we both knew where it was going. One weekend, my parents went out of town and I threw a “party” at my house, and she got an invite. She came by and we ended up making out for the first time, but I made the mistake of telling her I had “a roster” when she asked if I was talking to anyone else. Definitely a mistake, my only defense is that I was insecure, nervous, and very drunk. 

Shortly after this, we stopped hanging out as frequently. I ghosted her bc I was embarrassed and didn’t confront my lies that stemmed from insecurity. But we’d snap each other daily and stayed in touch. 

(2y ago)

She got mad when I took different girl to her school’s prom (I didn’t attend my own). I never told her about the girl bc I didn’t think it was much of her business, but we never “officially” stopped talking so I can see where she’s coming from. I eventually went off to college, out of state, shortly after prom.

During 1st year of college I had a girlfriend, so I didn’t talk to her for most of that year. 

(1y ago)

Transferred to community college in state, reconnected with her bc we were both taking classes online and would meet up for coffee to hang/work. Sometimes we’d sit in the car for hours after hanging out just talking. I think we both enjoy it, but it feels very platonic

(\~current)

Now at the same state university as her, and we’ve stayed in touch for a lot of last semester. We hung out a couple times. We grabbed dinner at a restaurant, shes laid with me in my bed watching Netflix for hours.

What confuses me the most is how platonic it feels when we’re together, yet we’ll snap and text everyday and she seems eager to make plans. In the past when I’ve ghosted her, we always start talking again because she reached out. 

Questions:

How do I “reignite” a spark that was there once, but died out bc of life circumstances

Am I being a chicken? Do I just need to make a move?

small frequent meals instead of skipping, apparently we've been using nicotine to suppress hunger and manage blood sugar, so you gotta retrain that

the cue extinction thing where you deliberately do trigger activities (coffee, driving, finishing a meal) *without* smoking, just to let your brain learn new associations

a ""conscious last cigarette/vape hit"" where you really focus on how gross it actually tastes/feels/smells instead of autopilot

**what I'm hoping to crowdsource:**

does any of this line up with what actually helped you? what worked that nobody told you about beforehand?

I spent a lot of hours on this. read the books, took notes, organized it into something searchable. put together a more [organized version](https://modernrelay.com/davidjohn10/smoking-cessation-resources) but honestly I trust real quit stories more than books at this point.

1qqhnme,https://www.reddit.com/r/focusedmen/comments/1qqhnme/how_to_be_disgustingly_charismatic_the/,How to be disgustingly charismatic: the science-based playbook nobody talks about,"You think charisma is some genetic lottery? Like some people just roll out of bed oozing charm while the rest of us are stuck being awkward weirdos? Yeah, I used to think that too. But after diving deep into psychology research, behavioral science, and studying people who just have this magnetic pull, turns out charisma is a skill. A learnable, practicable, actual skill.

And I'm not talking about becoming a fake smooth-talker who manipulates people. Real charisma is about making others feel seen, heard, and valued while being genuinely yourself. It's about presence, not performance. So if you've been feeling invisible in social situations or like people just don't vibe with you, this is your roadmap.

## Step 1: Master the Art of Presence (Stop Being a Ghost)

Here's the brutal truth: Most people are physically present but mentally checked out. You're in a conversation but thinking about what you'll say next, or scrolling through your mental to-do list, or planning your escape route. That's why you feel disconnected.

Charismatic people do one thing obsessively well: They are fully present. When they talk to you, it feels like you're the only person in the room. How do you do this?

Kill the mental noise. Before entering any social situation, take 30 seconds to breathe and clear your head. Literally. Inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 4. This activates your parasympathetic nervous system and pulls you into the moment.

Use the ""triangle technique."" Look at their left eye, then right eye, then mouth. This creates natural eye contact without being creepy or intense. It signals you're engaged.

Put your phone on silent and face down. Or better yet, leave it in another room. The mere presence of a phone on the table reduces conversation quality by 20%, according to research from the University of Essex. Your attention is your most valuable gift.

Check out ""The Charisma Myth"" by Olivia Fox Cabane. She's a Stanford lecturer who coached executives at Google and worked with military leaders. This book breaks down charisma into three core elements: presence, power, and warmth. What blew my mind was how she proves charisma isn't about being extroverted or loud. It's about making people feel something when they're around you. Insanely practical read with exercises that actually work.

## Step 2: Become a Listening Savage

You know what kills charisma instantly? Waiting for your turn to talk. Most conversations are just two people taking turns monologuing at each other. Real charisma comes from active listening, not clever responses.

Use the ""echo technique."" Repeat the last 2-3 words of what someone said as a question. Example: ""I've been stressed about work lately."" You: ""Stressed about work?"" This does two things: shows you're paying attention and encourages them to elaborate. Chris Voss, former FBI hostage negotiator, swears by this in his book ""Never Split the Difference."" He's negotiated international kidnappings and he says this one technique builds instant rapport because it makes people feel heard. The book is basically a masterclass in influence and human psychology. Best negotiation book you'll ever read, hands down.

Ask deeper questions. Instead of ""How was your weekend?"" try ""What's something that happened this week that made you feel alive?"" People are starving for real conversations. Give them that.

Embrace silence. Stop filling every gap with noise. Silence gives people space to think and share deeper thoughts. Charismatic people are comfortable with pauses.

## Step 3: Energy Management Is Everything

Your energy is contagious. If you walk into a room feeling drained, anxious, or pissed off, people will sense it within seconds. Mirror neurons in our brains literally make us pick up and reflect other people's emotional states.

Match and then lead. When someone's energy is low, don't blast them with hyperactivity. Match their energy first, then gradually lift it. This creates connection before you try to shift the vibe.

Physical energy matters. Charisma drops when you're exhausted, hungry, or running on caffeine fumes. Prioritize sleep, eat real food, move your body. Sounds basic but it's foundational. You can't radiate good energy when you're running on empty.

Try the Finch app for building better daily habits that boost your baseline energy. It's a self-care app that gamifies habit tracking with a cute bird companion. Sounds silly but it actually keeps you consistent with exercise, sleep, and mental health check-ins. Better habits equal better energy equal better charisma.

## Step 4: Stories Over Facts (Make People Feel Something)

Nobody remembers facts. People remember stories. Charismatic people don't just share information, they paint pictures with words.

Use the ""SCR formula"": Situation, Complication, Resolution. Don't just say ""I went hiking."" Say ""I was halfway up this trail when I realized I forgot water. Had to make it to the top or turn back defeated. Pushed through and the view made it worth every dry-mouthed step."" See the difference?

Show vulnerability. The most magnetic people aren't the ones who have it all together. They're the ones brave enough to share their struggles. Research from Brené Brown shows vulnerability builds connection faster than anything else. Her Netflix special and books like ""Daring Greatly"" are gold for understanding how sharing your authentic self makes you more likable, not less.

Use sensory details. Instead of ""It was nice,"" say ""The coffee was so hot it burned my tongue and I could smell fresh bread from the bakery next door."" Specifics make stories memorable.

## Step 5: Warmth Before Competence

Harvard research by Amy Cuddy found that people judge you on two things first: warmth and competence. And warmth comes first. If you lead with competence (achievements, credentials, status), you come across as cold. Lead with warmth (smiling, genuine interest, kindness), and people actually want to hear about your accomplishments.

Smile with your eyes. A fake smile uses just your mouth. A real smile (called a Duchenne smile) crinkles your eyes. Practice in the mirror until it feels natural.

Give genuine compliments. Not generic garbage like ""nice shirt."" Try ""The way you explained that made it click for me"" or ""Your enthusiasm is infectious."" Compliment effort, character, or impact.

Use people's names. Dale Carnegie said it decades ago in ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" and it's still true: A person's name is the sweetest sound to them. Use it naturally in conversation. It creates instant familiarity.

## Step 6: Body Language Isn't Optional

Your body talks before you even open your mouth. Charismatic people take up space confidently without being aggressive.

Power pose before social situations. Stand like Wonder Woman for 2 minutes (hands on hips, chest open, feet wide). Research shows this actually increases testosterone and decreases cortisol, making you feel more confident. Yeah, it sounds weird. It works.

Open body language. Uncross your arms, face people directly, keep your chest open. Closed body language screams ""I'm uncomfortable, stay away.""

Mirror subtly. Charismatic people naturally mirror the body language of who they're talking to. If they lean in, you lean in. If they cross their legs, you might too. This builds subconscious rapport. Just don't be creepy obvious about it.

## Step 7: Be Interested, Not Interesting

This flips everything on its head. You don't need to be the smartest, funniest, most accomplished person in the room. You just need to be genuinely curious about others.

Curiosity is magnetic. Ask questions you actually care about. Follow up on what people say. Remember details from past conversations and bring them up later. ""Hey, how did that job interview go?"" People will think you're the most interesting person they've met when really, you just made them feel interesting.

Drop the performance. Stop trying to impress. Start trying to connect. Charisma dies when it becomes a performance. It thrives when it's authentic.

For those wanting to go deeper on building genuine social confidence, there's an app called BeFreed that's worth checking out. It's an AI-powered learning platform that pulls from books like the ones mentioned above, communication research, and expert insights to create personalized audio content based on goals like ""become more charismatic as an introvert"" or ""build authentic connections without feeling fake."" You can customize the depth from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with specific strategies and examples. The voice options are actually addictive, there's even a sarcastic narrator style that makes dense psychology research way more digestible during commutes or gym sessions.

Try the Ash app if you're working through social anxiety or relationship challenges. It's like having a pocket therapist that gives you personalized coaching for communication and emotional health. Great for building genuine confidence instead of fake bravado.

## Step 8: Own Your Weird

The most charismatic people aren't trying to fit in. They're unapologetically themselves. Your quirks, passions, and weirdness are what make you memorable.

Share your enthusiasms. Even if they're niche or dorky. Passion is contagious. When you light up talking about something, people feel that energy.

Stop apologizing for existing. Cut phrases like ""Sorry to bother you"" or ""This might be stupid but..."" Own your space. Speak with conviction.

The science is clear: charisma isn't magic. It's presence, warmth, curiosity, and authenticity wrapped together. You're not changing who you are. You're just removing the barriers that keep people from experiencing the real you. And that version? Already charismatic as hell.",1,1769713307.0,focusedmen,0,1.0,False
1qqhnih,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Nobody_Society/comments/1qqhnih/the_day_after_you_realize_its_a_simulation/,The Day After You Realize It's a Simulation,"You finally see it. The seams in reality. The repetitive patterns. The way consciousness seems to bend the rules. Maybe it came in a flash, or maybe it was a slow, sinking certainty. However it arrived, the realization lands: *This is not base reality.*

There’s a moment of sublime, electric clarity. A high. You’ve cracked the code, seen behind the curtain. You feel chosen, awake, alive in a way you never thought possible.

Then you wake up the next morning.

The high has faded. The electric clarity has been replaced by a low, humming dissonance. You make coffee. The sun rises like it always does. But nothing looks the same.

This is the **Day After**.

It’s not fear, not exactly. It’s a profound disorientation. The old story you lived by—the one about building a career, finding your person, achieving milestones—has dissolved like mist. But no new story has rushed in to take its place. You’re left standing in a silent, empty field, with the architecture of your old life visible in the distance, now looking like a meticulously painted stage set.

A strange loneliness sets in. Not the loneliness of being physically alone, but the loneliness of perceiving a layer of reality you can’t un-see, and having no one to talk to about it who wouldn’t nod slowly and change the subject. Your small talk feels like a bizarre ritual. The news feels like a badly written script.

You might ask yourself:

* *""If nothing is fundamentally real, does anything matter?""*
* *""Who am I, if not the character I thought I was building?""*
* *""Is this freedom, or is this a cosmic joke?""*

This is the crucial, unglamorous gap. This is the space between the old dream ending and a new, conscious way of being beginning. This emptiness, this quiet confusion—**this is not a mistake. It is the necessary clearing.**

The ""Nobody"" state we talk about isn’t a glittering prize at the end of a spiritual quest. It is the **very ground of this clearing.**

It’s not a special achievement; it’s what’s left when the achievements lose their meaning. It’s not a new identity to cling to; it’s the simple, undeniable fact of your awareness, persisting after all the stories have fallen away. That slight, eerie emptiness you feel? That’s not a void. It’s **space.** It’s the first taste of the open sky after a lifetime spent in a beautifully decorated, but ultimately confining, room.

The Day After is not a sign you’ve failed or lost the magic. It is the most honest part of the journey. It’s where the glamour of ""awakening"" wears off, and the real, quiet work of **being** begins. You haven’t lost the truth. You’ve simply run out of old lies to comfort yourself with.

And in that stark, simple space—in the quiet of the morning after, with your coffee growing cold—you have your first real opportunity. Not to build a new, better story immediately. But to just be here. To feel the disorientation without needing to fix it. To be the awareness that witnesses the confusion.

The walls of your old world have vanished. Good. You were never meant to live within walls. You were meant to recognize that you are the sky.

The ground beneath you isn't gone. You’re just feeling, for the first time, the true, solid, eternal ground of your own presence. It feels like nothing… until you realize it’s the only thing that’s ever been real.

**Discussion Prompt:** *What did your 'Day After' feel like? Was it relief, fear, emptiness, freedom, loneliness, or something else entirely? Share a moment where the glow faded and the real, quiet work began.*",3,1769713301.0,The_Nobody_Society,1,1.0,False

* Te permite registrar tudo: do grão verde até os parâmetros finais da xícara.
* Backlog detalhado para facilitar o dial in ou simplesmente lembrar a receita daquele cafezão que você congelou meses atrás.
* Integração com diversos gadgets bluetooth registrando e fornecendo dados ainda mais precisos e em tempo real.
* Mostra gráficos legais do que você gosta, bebe e curte. Além de regiões, processos, variedades e outras informações sobre os cafés consumidos.

O Beanconqueror foi criado em 2017 pelo Lars Saalbach e se originou do seguinte pensamento: ""Por que não existe um app que deixa eu customizar tudo?"". Ele se sentia frustrado com a falta de flexibilidade das ferramentas existentes. Diante disto, Lars desenvolveu um app que atende a todos os perfis de publico, seja quem apenas quem quer anotar um ""esse café ficou gostoso"" até o  Q-Grader que precisa registrar tudo seguindo rigorosa os protocolos.

Vale ressaltar que o Beanconqueror é um app open-source (código aberto), ou seja, qualquer pessoa pode conferir o seu código fonte. Para os programadores do grupo, veja mais no [GitHub](https://github.com/graphefruit/Beanconqueror) ou [site](https://beanconqueror.com/).

Iniciante

Se você acabou de iniciar sua jornada no mundo dos cafés especiais e deseja controlar melhor suas extrações, mas se sente perdido com tantas variáveis, não se preocupe. O Beanconqueror pode te ajudar(assim como me ajudou) a evoluir.

Ao abrir o app, você verá a tela inicial + 4 abas principais que serão responsáveis por organizar suas extrações:

* Brew(Extrações): Aba na qual você tem acesso a seu histórico de extrações de cafés disponíveis e arquivados, ou seja, seu diário de bordo.
* Beans(Grãos): Aba na qual você tem acesso ao seu estoque de cafés disponíveis e arquiva os que já acabaram.
* Methods(Métodos): Aba na qual você cadastra seus métodos de preparo(V60, Moka, Aeropress, etc).
* Grinders(Moedores): Aba na qual você cadastra seus moedores e é essencial para que você possa salvar a regulagem utilizada em cada um.

A primeira vista pode parecer um pouco intimidador. Mas veja, você já lida com tudo isso sempre que vai preparar um café mesmo sem se dar conta disso.

Antes de tudo, você precisa registrar algumas informações necessárias para começar a utilizar o app, sendo elas:

* Seus cafés disponíveis na aba Beans que pode ser feito manualmente ou através do botão/qr code disponibilizado pela torrefação (preencher sub aba variety para ter acesso completo a ferramenta de estatísticas).
* Método(s) disponíveis na Aba Methods
* Moedor(es) disponíveis na Aba Grinders

Feito isso, basta começar a registrar suas extrações. Para isso, vá na aba Brews, clique no "" + "" e preencha os parâmetros:

* Qual café você irá preparar (você escolhe 1 dos cafés cadastrados na aba Beans). Exemplo: O Paraíso de Pedro
* Quantos gramas de café você irá utilizar(ele contabiliza automáticamente quanto café ainda tem disponível no pacote desde que você cadastre essa informação ao registrar o café). Exemplo: 23g
* Moedor. Exemplo: 1zpresso K-Ultra
* Qual foi o click / Ajuste de moagem utilizado. Exemplo: Click 7
* Quanto de água - Exemplo: 354ml
* Tempo total. Exemplo: 354ml
* Avaliação: Nota de 0 a 10. Exemplo: 8
* Notas - Exemplo: Café apresentou todo o sensorial (escreva com suas palavras!)

I've made several posts pointing out to various effects that Lara is a monster she's not a poor trapped hopeless victim of her situation. she likes the power she likes the control. she's not struggling against her hunger like Thomas is, she's embraced it as a part of herself to the point where she it's not sure where she ends and The hunger begins. the things that she says to Harry in 12 months about being kind and doing the right thing are let's be honest flat out lies. this is the same woman who encouraged one of her political rivals to commit flat out genocide because it would make him easier to predict. she sentenced thousands of women to cold despair ridden suicidal deaths at the hands of the Skavis, because it was convenient. 

she had specific wording written up in their prenuptial agreements that nobody from winter with seek reprizal against her for enslaving Harry. Mab and Molly cannot lie and they both say that Lara would have enslaved Harry. 

I could not and would not ever accept Lara being a secret soft heart, that actually cares about the amount of harm she inflicts upon others save for how efficient it is to not do so. 

but Jim has written himself a wonderful little loophole. and it goes as far back as cold days. you are what you eat. it's repeated several times throughout the book and it's more than just a psychological factor either. The white court vampires are genuinely changed by the people they feed off of. Justine would bring Thomas women to counteract his bad boots if he was angry he would be brought somebody happy if he was feeling tense somebody relaxed. 

at their first meeting on Harry's roof he says that he finds himself of listening to new music because Lara likes to eat off of musicians. 

genuine honest to goodness behavioral changes outside of their established personalities. 

and that's the hunger eating through the coffee filter of their host. 

Lara is going to be receiving regular unfiltered feedings from Harry's magic which we know that people's magic comes from within them it's off of Harry's thoughts his ideas his feelings. it's his will. 

there is going to be feeding off of somebody with honesty integrity and a genuine hair for his fellow man. kindness compassion gentleness. she's not really going to have a choice. mav also says this she's going to become more like winter Butler is also going to become more like Harry. 

it's an honest goodness reasonable reason for what's probably going to be a pretty radical character shift for Lara. and she kind of has to have this personality shift. she can't continue to be the same monster that she's always been. It just wouldn't work around Harry. maybe she could pull that off while he's depressed as hell dealing with PTSD and he's a guest in her home at a costume party. but the moment somebody looks a little bit distressed Harry's blowing that mansion to the sky.",12,1769713117.0,dresdenfiles,7,0.83,False

1qqhj5s,https://www.reddit.com/r/taskmonkey/comments/1qqhj5s/amazon_outlet_usa/,Amazon outlet usa,"So I went down the Amazon Outlet USA rabbit hole and actually learned some stuff that's saving me real money now.



After spending way too much time browsing through the Amazon Outlet USA section (you know, the one buried in the hamburger menu nobody clicks), I realized most people have no idea this section even exists. And even fewer know how to actually use it without getting burned.



Here's what I learned after a month of testing:



\*\*Step 1: Finding Amazon Outlet USA Deals That Aren't Garbage\*\*



The Amazon Outlet USA section is basically where they dump overstock and returned items. But here's the thing, not everything there is actually a deal. Half the items are ""discounted"" to what they normally cost during any random sale week.



What you want to do is cross-check the outlet price against the item's price history. I use a price tracker to make sure I'm not paying ""outlet prices"" for something that was cheaper last month.



\*\*Step 2: Understand What You're Actually Buying\*\*



Amazon Outlet USA items come in different conditions. Some are brand new overstock, some are open box returns. Always read the condition notes. I bought a ""Used - Like New"" laptop stand that came in original packaging with all the plastic still on. Basically brand new for 40% off.



But I've also seen ""Acceptable"" items that were basically junk. The condition rating matters more than the discount percentage.



\*\*Step 3: Stack It With Everything Else\*\*



Here's where Amazon Outlet USA gets interesting. These items still qualify for most Amazon promotions. I've stacked outlet prices with Subscribe and Save, coupon clipping, and even caught additional price drops after buying.



Speaking of price drops, I actually started using TaskMonkey after realizing how often outlet items drop even further after purchase. It caught a $14 refund on a coffee maker I bought from the outlet section. The price dropped 3 days after I bought it and TaskMonkey just got me the difference back automatically.



Not a bad way to double dip on already discounted stuff.",14,1769713047.0,taskmonkey,0,0.95,False

ended up with this doc of techniques and mental tricks that either made sense to me or came up over and over across multiple sources. some of it I've tried, some I haven't yet.

**mental stuff that stuck:**

the ""little monster vs big monster"" idea that physical withdrawal is apparently pretty mild, but the mental story (""I deserve one,"" ""I can't handle stress without it"") is the real enemy. helped me stop treating cravings like emergencies.

also the tight shoes analogy, smoking creates the discomfort then relieves it, and we think that relief is pleasure.

**practical stuff from the notes:**

cutting caffeine in half when you quit (nicotine affects how fast you metabolize it, so your coffee suddenly hits way harder)

small frequent meals instead of skipping, apparently we've been using nicotine to suppress hunger and manage blood sugar, so you gotta retrain that

the cue extinction thing where you deliberately do trigger activities (coffee, driving, finishing a meal) *without* smoking, just to let your brain learn new associations

a ""conscious last cigarette"" where you really focus on how gross it actually tastes/feels/smells instead of autopilot

**what I'm hoping to crowdsource:**

does any of this line up with what actually helped you? what worked that nobody told you about beforehand?

I spent a lot of hours on this. read the books, took notes, organized it into something searchable. put together a more [organized version](https://modernrelay.com/davidjohn10/smoking-cessation-resources) but honestly I trust real quit stories more than books at this point.

I have two cats (F7 & M5). Both are fixed and have been since getting them. My female cat has for the past few years had trouble using the litter box regularly, while my male cat has never had any troubles besides peeing on plastic bags (so we don’t leave grocery bags on the floor.)

We have two litter boxes, both the biggest size available that get scooped everyday and dumped once a week. There is honestly no room anywhere to put another one.

My female cat tends to find small spaces in our house to use the bathroom at, which usually we find later and block the space off. The issue is that she won’t stop. Now that the more secluded spaces are blocked off she’s going in places like behind the couch, under the coffee table, on rugs, etc.

My male cat doesn’t have these issues, and to be quite frank is too fat to fit in most of the small spaces she does.

At this point I’m not sure what else to do. She is not the friendliest of cats and although that is fine with me, the big deal breaker is her using the bathroom everywhere.

She has been to the vet for regular checkups and they said she seems perfectly healthy.

My cats are not a bonded pair by any means. The closest I’ve ever seen them be is occasionally grooming one another, which usually turns into a silent fighting match right after. I don’t think my male cat would be lonely without her.

Would it be wrong to surrender her? I love her, but not enough for my house to smell like cat pee.",0,1769712631.0,CatAdvice,39,0.5,False

New York, United States



Jackson



I took a long sip of my coffee and felt the warmth as it slid down my throat; it was the best moment of the day. I finished reading the end-of-month sales analysis. A waitress approached and placed a slice of cake on the table. I frowned and looked up at her.



""I didn't order this."" She smiled apologetically, her cheeks turning a pale pink.



""It's on the house."" I raised my eyebrows in surprise.



""Oh, thanks."" I managed a half-smile.



""Have a nice day."" And without waiting for a response, she disappeared.



""Well..."" I then turned my attention back to my tablet.



""Mr. Johnson..."" I heard beside me and sighed, knowing it was time to go.



""So soon?"" I sounded a bit irritated.



""You have a meeting at nine, we have ten minutes to get to the building.""



""Alright, alright,"" I packed my tablet, finished the rest of my coffee, and got up to grab my coat since it was freezing cold. I weaved through the tables to reach the exit. As I stepped outside, I stopped when I saw a red-haired woman in a blood-red coat. She smiled at me.



""No way,"" I said to myself.



""Jackson, this time you won't escape, let's have breakfast together."" I walked up to her since she was blocking the armored SUV's door.



""I think we'll leave it for another day, I have a meeting at nine and only nine minutes to get there.""



She tried to pout.



""Come on, slow down a bit and have breakfast with me.""



""I really can't, Georgina."" I politely sidestepped, causing her to move aside automatically.



""You owe me breakfast then..."" she said suddenly, as I was closing the car door. I turned to her.



""I'll call you..."" Then I closed the door. She waited for the tinted window to roll down, but she'd be waiting a while. The car started moving, and finally, I could sigh.



""I hate blind dates,"" I muttered. My bodyguard smiled; I saw him in the rearview mirror. ""I don't understand the rush to get me into a relationship.""



""Your mother wants to see you married with a family in the future.""



""I'm only thirty; I still have time before settling down, before living..."" I turned to look out the window. What are you going to live? You're on autopilot, Jackson. Just on autopilot. Your mind is only on business.



""But with the lady you just saw, I thought there was some chemistry..."" commented my security man, Richard.



""Remember, all the women who approach my mother or my family do so because they want to get close to me. And if they get close to me, they get fame, connections, and, most importantly, to tie me down in holy matrimony, and of course, my mother is happy."" I snorted. ""I'm like a lottery ticket..."" Richard nodded with a smile, not taking his eyes off the traffic.



After the nine o'clock meeting, I focused on the new properties I was going to acquire. I was enchanted by a property in the Hamptons; the land was extensive, with a private beach, and the area had only a few neighboring houses. The farther from prying eyes, the better.



There was a knock on the door, and I announced they could come in. I heard the door open, and when I looked up, I smiled at the sight of my only brother: Jacob.



""Good morning, bro! Am I interrupting?"" I quickly shook my head.



""Good morning, come in, come in. What are you up to now?"" Jacob laughed.



""Can't I just come to see my little brother?"" I rolled my eyes for a moment.



""Only for three seconds. Don't boast, idiot."" Jacob was my twin; he sat in the chair on the other side of my desk.



""Alright, alright, I have six more clients for the eco-friendly housing project. Mentioning I'm your brother has started attracting more clients..."" I shook my head silently.



""Don't say that, you also carry the Johnson name.""



""But they ask: 'Johnson?' 'Are you Jackson Johnson's brother?' 'The owner of the real estate conglomerate?' Of course, they doubt it when they don't see the resemblance between us, you being brunette and me blonde."" I pressed my lips together; he laughed at my irritation. ""By the way, our mother didn't make a good choice with your name.""



""Here we go again..."" I muttered through clenched teeth.



""Seriously, 'Jack Johnson' would have been fine, but Jackson Johnson..."" He smiled sarcastically; he loved to tease me about how strange my name sounded with our last name. ""On the other hand, Jacob Johnson sounds like...""



""A porn star, yes, yes, yes, come on, tell me why you're here, I have..."" I glanced at the clock. ""I have another meeting in fifteen minutes, then I'm heading to the Hamptons to check out some properties.""



""Alright, I'll get to the point."" He settled into the chair and smiled. ""Come with me on a blind date."" I raised an eyebrow.



""Tell our mother I don't need another blind date, for God's sake! What's wrong with her these weeks? Talking to her is becoming a torture with all these blind dates."" Jacob smiled. ""Why doesn't she focus on you instead? You need a woman in your life, to see if the family architect settles down, gives her grandchildren and a daughter-in-law.""



""Nah! I'm a free spirit, a man who prefers to enjoy and love women in my bed and then the next day, 'Nice to have met you, I'll call you.'""



""Bastard. I just ask the universe to be there to see you lose your mind over a woman who treats you the same so you know what it feels like.""



""That will never happen, Jack, never.""

I have a big mass inside my jaw and have a follow up tomorrow but lab results I could look at says it’s a giant cell granuloma based on biopsy results.

My teeth hurt and when I move the muscles in my chin I feel a tearing sensation that makes me gasp.

It grew over twice the size within 2 months between dentist and biopsy appointments.

I struggled with both BED and anorexia at different times and most recently BED, I have struggled and failed to lose the weight for 2 years but I know things like this cause me to relapse into anorexia. I see it as a silver lining actually because I gained 90 pounds, it’s 70% my original weight.

However I am struggling to eat because my teeth are shifting and my chin is numb unless I move the muscles too much and feel tearing. Yesterday and the day before my teeth were pushed up by the mass to the point I couldn’t put my teeth together without pain because the raised teeth were painful and my healthy teeth wouldn’t touch.

I added up the calories I had in the last 3 days because I imagine this is just how I’m gonna be now, and on the first day I didn’t eat at all, dividing it my calories per day would have been around 920 but without coffee creamer which I don’t usually have that number drops into the 600s, on top of that what I’ve been eating includes high calorie things like ramen which I had to swallow without chewing due to the shifted teeth so volume wise it’s almost nothing.

I usually relapse because of stuff like this medical issue and I know the relapse is going to happen and I don’t feel like fighting it especially since I am obese given that I was a healthy weight despite disordered eating and nearly doubled my size due to binge eating also impacted by certian things that changed.

I just know that the treatment for this would be surgery and possible injections and I will probably be on a longer liquid diet and maybe in more pain post surgery, I see it as a good thing actually to lose weight but I am worried about how that’s going to affect my healing whether it’s injections surgery or both. I really don’t want disfigurement and part of that I know is also going to contribute to the relapse. Once I see I’ve lost 20 pounds it’s gonna be really hard not to just lean into it.

I wanna know if it’s safe to restrict so heavily or even just be on a weight loss journey during injections or after potential bone graft. I’m probably gonna lose like 5 teeth that were perfectly healthy and I am upset about it. I’m worried that when I ask the doctor in person they might not take my history with anorexia seriously and think i’m an obese woman who thinks any restrictions are an eating disorder. Or that they might just lie to me and tell me it’s worse than it is which is going to cause me a lot of anxiety if I have to wonder if it’s okay. The follow up is with the dental surgeon idk if this is a relevant question to ask a surgeon but I basically want permission unless it’s going to royally fuck up my face and healing especially post surgery.

It will be less stress if I know it’s okay to eat very low calories while going through treatment because I really don’t want to eat anything but I will maintain weight or do a healthier calorie restriction only if it’s a horrible idea not to. I don’t want to wind up disfigured because I wasn’t eating enough to heal though so i’m hoping the amount needed to heal is actually low.",1,1769712466.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

Brokerage: 22K. Current Weekly Contribution: $150

Coinbase: 3K (just coffee money really). Current Weekly Contribution: $35

Obviously the goal is FIRE. 

The other goals are to get into real estate, land-lording, airbnb-ing, house hacking as early as possible. So potentially using my investment accounts early for downpayments etc.

Talking to my parents they said I should be investing into a 401k to take money out early not Roth 401k because I'll be double taxed? I was also thinking I should change to do 3% into Roth 401 and start maxing my Roth IRA.

We was in harvest season here in the farm and I didn’t really enter the social media so much. But I really wanted to talk to you about something that I think is super interesting.
Today I want to talk about a topic that I really like and that is coffee and bees. It happens that in my farm I have, since last year, beehives of two types. I have honey bees, the africanized ones, and also I have bees that here we commonly call angelitas (video) , which are stingless bees.
This is a very interesting topic because arabica coffee, which includes many varieties inside, and is the only coffee that is planted in Colombia, from geishas to bourbons and castillos, all this coffees, different from robusta, they don’t really need pollinators because they self-pollinate. But that doesn’t mean that if a pollinator arrives to the flower it will not help, actually it helps a lot, and that’s where the importance is.
The coffee flower is very delicate, so during flowering time, when it blooms and there is bad weather conditions like wind or rain, even the workers when they walk through the farm they can easily knock down the flower, sometimes even before the plant has time to self-pollinate.
And that’s where the bees come in. Bees, independently of the type, are very good pollinators, this is something everyone already knows. They usually arrive very fast to the coffee flowers, and what they do is that those flowers that could be lost because of rain, wind or many other factors, they arrive before that happens and pollinate them.
So at the end we have more productive points. Since I installed the bees, I really saw an increase in production of almost 20%, just because they pollinated those flowers that, for different reasons, the plant couldn’t pollinate by itself.
So as a support they are really efficient, because 20% is a lot for a harvest, and obviously it also helps to keep the ecosystem healthy. I just wanted to share this interesting fact, this data, because in the year that I have been with the bees I saw this response in my farm as a personal experience, and I wanted to share it with you",25,1769712279.0,pourover,1,0.9,False

1qqh3zu,https://i.redd.it/evx5fett2cgg1.jpeg,Sub Derm?? Or something else? Help please!,"I started having really dry skin in my eyebrows several months ago. I started combing out my eyebrows and applying a serum (that I was currently using on my face)  there as well. It then got worse and it was thick flakes that I could comb out, to the point where even my mom was wondering if it was more than just dry skin, and my forehead started flaking. I also have a rough texture to my skin on my face now, rougher than normal. After hours of research I'm thinking I have sub derm, or maybe just a damaged skin barrier?? Or both?? I could really use some advise and some help.

Some facts about me that may or may not be relevant in this case:

1). If it is sub derm, I believe it started from me switching shampoo and conditioner last summer and starting a new serum around October/November. These products contained castor oil, olive oil and jojoba oil (which I now know feeds the yeast). I supported these products 1 month ago

2). I'm 29, 5 months postpartum with a toddler as well, and breastfeeding (my 5 month old also has cradle cap)

3). My stress levels may be triggering it too, but there's not much I can do about that right now. I know what to do to help my cortisol levels, but it's not something I can take/do while breastfeeding

4). I've never had clear glowy skin. I've always had clogged pores, dullness, and some normal hormonal breakouts

5). I've used a tallow oil cleanser and whipped tallow moisturizer on my face for about 3 years now with no issues, but have also stopped these products

6). I don't know much about skin care or the correct products to use on my face. Being in the postpartum trenches the last few years has taken its toll on me and I've just been doing the bare minimum

7). I put collagen peptides in my coffee every morning, attempting to help my hair from postpartum hair loss. I’ve been doing this for roughly 3-4 months 

One month ago I began using MCT oil and tea tree oil (diluted of course: 1 drop of tea tree to 1/2tsp of mct oil and applied that to my face and used a brow brush to get it into my eyebrows. It would moisturize and reduce the flakes to where I didn't really notice them(I could tell they were still there though), but within 12-24 hours after applying it would go back to what it normally looked like and never get better. I also have been using a tea tree oil shampoo and conditioner on my hair.

This week I ditched the mct oil and have used nizoral shampoo on my face in the shower, allowing it to sit for about 1-2 minutes before washing it off. I've done this 3 times so far, the first time was fine and I even noticed a bit of shine on my face that I've never had before. The last 2 times I've done this my face begins to burn within about 30 seconds of applying the shampoo to my face. I also bought The Ordinary Niacinamide/Zinc serum and have used that 3 times. The first time it burned when I applied it, so the next 2 times I mixed 2 drops in some CereVe daily moisturizer (that I used to use before switching to tallow) and applied it without it burning. The burning is concerning me, so now I’m lost as to where to go from here..

Can anyone offer some guidance? A routine to follow?

Different products to use? Do I heal my skin barrier first? Or tackle the sub derm?

1qqh3ts,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1qqh3ts/war_for_the_kingdom_of_the_mole_men/,War For The Kingdom Of The Mole Men,"The Kit was gone.

It had been entrusted to James, and he had taken it. Inside the Kit was 10,000 dollars.  And pills. That was why he had taken it, E was sure of it. But there was more in the Kit. There were letters. And pictures of ‘cilla.

Red get the boys and fan out, James took the Kit. There’s a car missing. The Lincoln.  He’ll be headed for the airport.

Red spoke into a phone on the wall, then hung it up.

The boys are in town, I’ll get ‘em E, we’ll meet you there.

I’ll meet you at the airport Red.

Beside the door a string of keys. Red grabbed the nearest set, the ones with dice on. them. The door slammed after him.  Slapping leather on concrete then the fire of combustion, cold gasoline vaporized inside eight cylinders and the squeal of tires.

Big E donned a cape. A revolver, a police special, rested in a specially sewed pocket of

his jumpsuit.

His sunglasses darkened the mid July sun of Tennessee. He had chosen the keys to a Cadillac, and the ignition turned. The transmission in gear the pedal on the floor. Loose gravel danced behind him, kicked into a window of the house, a mohawk of rock and dirt and anger

and dinosaur bones.

It would take time for Red to get to town, and the boys. He knew a back road, a ring road around town. Bootlegger route from Prohibition. 

James would go that way.

The hardball highway under his wheels. He flashed his lights, and waved a federal badge at cars ahead of him and they pulled over. Several miles ahead a dirt road to the right.

He took it, fishtailing the Cadillac, turned into the skid, gunned the motor.

The road climbed a gentle hill, broadleaf hardwoods swayed in the wake of American horsepower. Ahead the road turkey tracked, a sharp turn to the left and a gentle grade to the right. The center, a two track path, kudzu crushed by recent tire tracks. He stopped the car.  The tire tracks matched the tread pattern of the Lincoln. 

He pursued.

The suspension rocked and the low slung frame of the Cadillac dragged against baked puddle edges and his speed was reduced by necessity, drag marks ahead were fresh. His confidence grew with his rage.

Another mile and glint in the forest, then a clearing. An ancient farmhouse. 

Overgrown by kudzu and broken vehicles and barrels and gutted furniture and rusted tools. 

Beside the house, the Lincoln.

He pulled behind it, parking to box in and deny escape. 

Revolver in hand he ripped from the drivers seat.

James! James! Get over here!

There was no sound but the clicking of the hot engine.

He scanned, no movement. He kicked open the farmhouse door. 

Pack rats and possums had left their smell and their detritus, but the house held no higher life. His white cowboy boots thud on a molded Persian rug. A hollow sound beneath. He moved the rug. 

A trap door. 

He opened it. A stairwell into darkness.  He examined the stairs.  Fresh prints.

Tony Llamas.

James.

He possessed no external light source, but a cigarette lighter, and he fashioned a torch out of packrat sticks and shredded rags.

James, I’m coming after you man, and if you don’t come out now I’m going to hurt you,

bad.

He descended the stairs. 

Ancient timbers supported the hand hewn tunnel descending

at a 45 degree angle. The stairs were wooden, rotten, some creaked, some were broken in

times past, some broken recently, some broke under his boot. He fed more strips of cloth to the torch. No markings on the wall, save for pick ruts and chisel marks in the harder rock.

The stairs switchbacked and the air grew warm. His sideburns fluttered with a breeze in his face that smelled of pancakes and maple syrup. Far ahead a light glowed, narrow from distance, blue hued. He drew the revolver and approached carefully, not for concern of ambush, but for concern of the fragile stairs.

James! Last warning man. There’s still time to smooth this out!

The blue light ahead darkened, then reappeared.

If this is about the money, you could just ask, man!

The tunnel turned. Mushrooms on the ceiling of a small room. A body in the center. Not James’ somebody else, an ancient body with rotting denim overalls shrouding mushroom cracked bones. Beside the body lay a sword. He examined it. The scabbard was wood, ornate, black and gold etchings. The steel shined blue, and was free of rust.

Karate sword, he knew. 

The curve of the blade and the hardness of the steel, Damascus. 

A dragon etched into the blade.

“Terminus Est,” written on the handle. 

He felt power when he gripped the handle. Hungry power.

A silk strap was affixed to both ends of the scabbard, and he placed it over his shoulder,

moving his cape for ease of access.

Down the tunnel shuffling, a muffled scrape and strained creaks of tested wood.

James! I made it this far, and I’m still willing to forget all this man.

There was no answer.

He fed a strip of the dead man’s overalls to the torch, and waited

The sound stopped several paces away, still shrouded in darkness. He waited, pistol trained at the opening of the tunnel. 

Then a being leapt into the room. Muscles covered by thick fur, adorned with belts of human skulls. The beast stood high, a head or two taller than him, and peered down with a head covered in dirty fur, a snout protruding, two yellowed teeth at the front, each as big as a man’s thumb, it held a crude club, rebar with a cinder block on the

end.

E stood still, not from fear, he was Army trained, and an accomplished Karateman. It was the oddity of the thing before him. A creature not of this world, from before the time God banished Behemoth and Leviathan. A remanent of a past world full of sin and evil and

savagery. The giant creature readied its improvised club, and he shot it with the police special.

Two rounds of .357 tore through the chest of the creature, ripped coffee can sized holes through

the back. The creature stumbled, then fell backwards. 

He examined the body. The fur was fine, thick, like that on a dog’s face. There were eyes, but they were mere slits, tiny ears sat upon the thing’s head. The snout was also like a dog’s, extended several inches, the two large front teeth gave way to rows of small ones, separated by a rough gray tongue.

The body was like that of a man’s. But the claws. Five on each finger, six inches or

longer. 

He touched one, it was hard, chipped, caked in dirt. He counted the skulls around the thing’s waist, seven, some large, but two were small, children’s size.

Mole men, just like in the movies, Lord Jesus.

He calculated his options. He had four rounds left in the revolver, and he knew his torch wouldn’t last the ascent. He would be trapped if he stayed in this place or continued. 

But James had the Kit. And he needed it back.

He gathered what was left of the tattered overalls, added them to the torch, and walked the tunnel of the beast’s origin.

More wooden steps. Five of them. Then nothing.

He stepped into air and fell, tumbling through warm darkness. 

He fell faster than the torch and its light danced into his view every few seconds as he spun head over boots in the darkness. Then the torch unraveled and there was no light. Only wind and blackness. 

He began to panic, but summoned an inner calm. He reached one corner of his rhinestone cape, and then another, and held it out like a wing. The increased drag stabilized his fall, Army training took over, and positioned his feet below him like a paratrooper.

He glided untold minutes. Meditation controlled his mind, and the fear of the darkness was pushed down, replaced with a calm readiness. 

More untold minutes and a glow appeared below him. Orange and yellow and warm.

He glided toward the light. A cloudbank, or fog, he wasn’t sure. His cowboy boots pierced the cloudbank and he was buffeted by turbulence, condensation on his sideburns and eyebrows. 

More descent. And the light grew brighter.

Soon he was through the cloud bank. Below him a vast and green landscape. A box canyon covered in clouds, dazzlingly bright mushrooms lining the sides. Foliage below, and a massive tower, cobblestone square. Houses.

Holy moley, I found the center of the Earth, man.

The updrafts were strong, and harnessed them to slow him and to gently land. He did so, in the square.

He was in a village. The stone tower stood 300 feet tall, a stone snake constricted its way around the vertical length of it over and over from the bottom to the top. 

Huts of mud and thatched roofs surrounded the square, some larger buildings were made of stone and unknown timber, and large white material.

Bone. Behemoth’s bones built these buildings.

WHO DARE ENTER MY KINGDOM?

A voice from everywhere echoed in his ears. The sound shook his teeth and vibrated his sideburns.

He looked around. There was no one speaking. Inside the nearest hut he saw something peak out at him. A creature, small, timid looking.

I SAID WHO DARE ENTER!? FLYING SKY MAN! SPEAK! I AM THE WIZARD BRANCH HEMLOCK, HEWER OF TREES AND MEN, SLAYER OF THE THE CRIMINAL GADIANTON, CAMBRIAN OF THE EARTH, AND KING OF THIS REALM AND I DEMAND YOU SPEAK OR SUFFER YOUR VERY DEATH!

Whoa man, I’m a bit of a King myself.

YOU DARE TO CHALLENGE MY POWER!?

From the top of the tower, a man jumped and fell at fast speed toward him. 

The man landed gently 20 or so paces from him, he felt the breeze of his wake buffet him.  The man was old, long hair, a white beard past his chest. Black adorned robe covered a skinny frame, a tall pointy hat similarly adorned with moons and stars atop his head. He carried a sword and spoke in a rasp. 

A wizard. A wizard king.

A king? A king has come to challenge me for my kingdom? I see.

No business here but my own. I came looking for my man, he took something from me,

and I’m going to take it back.

The wizard king squinted, then turned and spoke words unpronounceable in a human

mouth. A dozen mole men emerged from the stone building, all crisscrossed with human skulls and other grisly accouterments. 

They drug a mangled body behind them.

James.

So, So Called King, is this your man?

My man was alive when he fled, and though he did me wrong, he’s still my own. I had no quarrel with you man, but now I do.

SO BE IT!

The mole men dropped James’ body and charged. He knew the revolver was of no use, so he left it in his jumpsuit. The karate sword unsheathed, he drew a defensive combat stance.

The creatures balked their charge.

WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?

I found it, man.

BLASPHEMY!

The wizard king stepped into the sky, non-Euclidean geometries of lights dancing from his fingers, arcing toward him, fire and death and heat and hate and off key music followed. 

He executed a karate roll and missed the first salvo, then another. A third struck close, and a fourth was a direct hit, but the light and the heat was absorbed into the sword. 

He felt a power surge through him, transmitted from the wizard king  to the light to the sword to him. 

He took a step and felt the ground soften. He looked down and he was floating. He took another step and gained elevation.

Below him, hundreds more mole men emerged from huts and buildings and nearby forests and fields, and sank to one knee as they watched the duel of kings.

The wizard flung more light and fireballs at him, and he absorbed them with the blade, power surging through him.

IT CAN’T BE! NOT LIKE THIS!

He closed to within a dozen paces of the man in the sky, drew the police special, and fired four rounds into the wizard king’s head. The man fell to the ground, dead.

He descended to the corpse, and touched the blade to the man’s body. Unimaginable power gripped him as the blade drew the magic. Memories that were not his flooded his mind, and knowledge of 10,000 years of forgotten secrets.

He stepped into the sky, sword held above him. The molemen fell to both knees and let out an unworldly sound. 

A sound of rejoice.

1qqh2vk,https://www.reddit.com/r/GroundedMentality/comments/1qqh2vk/how_to_be_a_more_attractive_man_the_psychology/,How to Be a More Attractive Man: The Psychology That Actually Works,"Most advice on male attractiveness is garbage. It's either ""just be confident bro"" or some redpill nonsense that makes you insufferable. After diving deep into research, books, and conversations with actual women, I realized attraction isn't some mystical force. It's behavioral psychology mixed with basic self-respect.

The truth? Society sets men up to fail. We're told to suppress emotions, grind endlessly, and somehow radiate confidence while feeling lost. Biology plays a role too. Our brains are wired for instant gratification, making long-term self-improvement brutally hard. But here's the thing, understanding these forces means you can work with them instead of against them.

Stop optimizing for everyone's approval. Attractiveness isn't universal. Some women love nerdy guys who info-dump about their hobbies. Others want someone chill and easygoing. Trying to appeal to everyone makes you bland. Instead, double down on what makes you you. The guys who do best aren't necessarily the best looking. They're the ones who know their lane and own it completely.

 Develop genuine interests beyond work and Netflix. Join a climbing gym, learn pottery, get obsessed with coffee roasting. Whatever. The specifics don't matter as much as having something you care about. Women (and people generally) are drawn to passion. It signals you're not dependent on them for fulfillment. Plus, hobbies give you actual stories to tell instead of recycling the same ""yeah work's been busy"" conversation.

 Learn to hold space for discomfort. This changed everything for me. Most men run from awkward silences or emotional moments. We fill space with jokes or change topics. Practice sitting with tension. Let pauses happen. When someone shares something vulnerable, don't immediately try to fix it. Just listen. The book ""The Will to Change: Men, Masculinity, and Love"" by bell hooks (legendary cultural critic and feminist theorist) absolutely wrecked me in the best way. It breaks down how patriarchy damages men's ability to connect. Sounds academic but it's incredibly readable. This book will make you question everything you think you know about masculinity. Best $15 I've spent.

 Fix your basics but don't obsess. Get a haircut that actually suits your face shape (ask your barber for real feedback). Buy clothes that fit properly. Basic skincare routine: cleanser, moisturizer, sunscreen. That's it. You don't need a 12-step Korean routine unless you want one. The app Ash has genuinely good advice on building healthy habits and relationships without feeling like therapy homework. It's like having a coach who gets that you're trying but also calls out your BS.

 Cultivate emotional intelligence without becoming everyone's therapist. Read ""Emotional Intelligence 2.0"" by Travis Bradberry and Jean Greaves. It's based on years of research with thousands of people and includes a self-assessment. The authors are psychologists who've worked with Fortune 500 companies but they write in plain English. Learning to identify and manage your emotions makes you exponentially more attractive because most men are emotional toddlers with gym memberships. 

If you want to go deeper on these psychology concepts but don't have time to read everything, BeFreed is worth checking out. It's an AI-powered personalized learning app that pulls from books like the ones mentioned here, plus research papers and expert interviews on social dynamics and relationships. You can tell it something specific like ""I'm an introvert who wants to be more magnetic in social situations,"" and it creates a custom learning plan just for you. The depth is adjustable too, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with examples. The voice options are surprisingly addictive (the smoky one works great for late-night learning). Built by Columbia grads and former Google AI experts, it's solid for anyone trying to level up without the usual self-help fluff.

 Build something. Could be a business, could be a podcast nobody listens to, could be a vegetable garden. Having a project you're working toward gives you purpose beyond just existing. Women notice when a guy is actively building vs passively consuming. There's an energy difference. Even if it fails (most things do), the process of trying makes you more interesting.

 Get comfortable with rejection and failure. This is the real work. Every attractive guy I know has been rejected countless times. They just don't let it define them. The podcast The Art of Charm has practical episodes on social dynamics and building genuine confidence. The host Jordan Harbinger interviews everyone from FBI negotiators to dating experts. It's not pickup artist garbage, it's actual behavioral science.

Your attractiveness isn't fixed. It's not about genetics or money (though sure, those help). It's about becoming someone you'd want to hang out with. Work on that and everything else follows.",2,1769712086.0,GroundedMentality,0,1.0,False

It’s brought me right back to how I studied in medical school.



Back then I used Anki heavily along with the usual resources. During IM residency, I moved away from memorization and focused more on understanding mechanisms. That worked well for some areas like cardiology and nephrology, but it left my learning pretty unstructured. Once I got into heme/onc, that approach started to fall apart. There are just too many things that are straight-up recall: CD markers, path features, drug names, trial data. I’d catch myself mixing up drugs like durvalumab and daratumumab, which isn’t ideal.



AI tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude have been really useful for organizing information and explaining concepts. Their quiz modes are solid too. But they didn’t fully solve the problem of memorizing dry, detail-heavy facts.



That’s when I came back to something a tutor showed me years ago: memory palaces (method of loci). It turns out AI is surprisingly good at helping build them.



Here’s what I do now:



* I go through a lecture or article and write down the key facts I actually need to remember
* I pick a real place I know well (for me it’s often a specific coffee shop)
* I describe the layout and what objects are there
* I paste my notes into ChatGPT or Gemini and ask it to build a memory palace using that location, attaching each fact to something in the space with vivid, sometimes ridiculous imagery
* Then I use an image model to generate a visual version of the scene — lately I’ve been using **NanoBananaPro in Gemini**, which does a surprisingly good job turning the description into a usable “Sketchy-style” image





The end result is kind of like making your own Sketchy, except it’s tied to a place you personally know and you decide exactly what goes in it. I’ve found that just going through the process of building it makes the material stick a lot better.



Sketchy is great, but two things feel different here:



1. You remember things better when you create the associations yourself
2. Fellowship-level heme/onc is so specific and fast-moving that there isn’t always a premade resource for what you need





This approach has made memorizing some of the more tedious, detail-heavy parts of heme/onc a lot more manageable. Figured I’d share in case it helps anyone else who feels like they’re drowning in random facts.",13,1769711887.0,medicalschool,3,0.81,False

1qqgsfu,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1qqgsfu/my_apartment_wasnt_on_the_building_map/,My Apartment Wasn’t on the Building Map,"I noticed it on a Tuesday which somehow made it worse. Tuesdays are forgettable. Nothing strange is supposed to happen on a Tuesday. I was standing in the building office waiting for the manager to finish printing a copy of the emergency evacuation plan. I glanced at the map taped to the wall out of boredom tracing the floors with my finger counting stairwells exits apartment numbers. When I reached my floor I frowned. The hallway was there. The stairwell was there. The elevator shaft was there. But my apartment number wasn’t.

I laughed at first and assumed it was an old map. Buildings update things all the time. Units get renumbered combined split. Still something about it bothered me enough that I asked the manager a tired looking man named Carl who always smelled faintly of burnt coffee. I pointed to the spot where my apartment should have been and said hey that’s where I live. He leaned closer adjusted his glasses and went very still. After a moment he said no that unit doesn’t exist. Not on any of our records.

I thought he was joking. He didn’t smile.

Back in my apartment everything looked normal. Same scuffed hardwood floors. Same leaky kitchen faucet. Same faint smell of dust and old paint that never quite went away. But once the idea was in my head I couldn’t shake it. I checked my lease. The address was there clear as day. Apartment number included. I checked my utility bills. Same thing. Even my mail had been arriving just fine. According to paperwork my apartment absolutely existed. According to the building map it didn’t.

That night I started noticing things I’d probably ignored before. The hallway outside my door seemed a little longer than I remembered. The lights flickered but only near my unit. When I stood very still I thought I could hear something behind the walls. Not pipes. Not mice. It sounded like breathing, slow and patient like whatever it was had nowhere else to be.

The next day I knocked on my neighbor’s door. I’d lived next to her for almost a year exchanged polite hellos borrowed sugar once. I asked her if she remembered when I moved in. She hesitated, eyes drifting past me down the hallway, and said she didn’t recall anyone living there before. When I told her I’d been there nearly twelve months, her face tightened. She said she thought the apartment was storage. Or maybe a maintenance access. She closed the door gently but firmly after that.

I started asking more questions. Too many questions apparently. One neighbor claimed the door to my apartment had been painted over years ago sealed shut after some kind of incident. Another said the unit number skipped straight past mine on the elevator panel though when I looked my floor button was right where it had always been. The building manager stopped answering my emails. When I went to the office again the door was locked during business hours.

Things inside the apartment began to shift. Subtle at first. A chair that wasn’t where I’d left it. Footprints in the dust near the baseboards barefoot and not mine. One morning, I woke up to find the front door unlocked, the deadbolt turned as if someone had left quietly in the night. I knew I hadn’t opened it. I sleep lightly. I would have heard it.

I tried to leave.

That’s when the building fought back.

The elevator wouldn’t stop on my floor anymore. It passed it every time skipping straight from the floor below to the one above. The stairwell door once I pushed through it opened onto a blank concrete wall. No hallway. No doors. Just solid gray cold and unyielding. When I turned around the stairwell behind me was gone. I don’t remember screaming but my throat hurt afterward so I must have.

I made it back to my apartment somehow. I don’t know how. The door was open waiting for me like it always had been.

That night, I found the map again. Not the one in the office. A different one. It was spread across my kitchen table when I got home yellowed and curled at the edges like it had been folded and unfolded for decades. It showed the building as it used to be. Older layout. Fewer safety features. And there clear as day, was my apartment. Not numbered. Just outlined in thick black ink tucked into a corner that didn’t quite fit the rest of the structure.

In the margins, someone had written notes. Warnings maybe. Or instructions. Most of them were scratched out so hard the paper had torn. One sentence was still legible.

This space fills itself.

I don’t decorate anymore. I don’t invite people over. I don’t make noise at night. I stay where the walls expect me to be. Sometimes I hear movement in rooms that shouldn’t exist doors opening where there are no doors. Sometimes I catch my reflection in the darkened TV screen standing just a second behind where I know I am.

My apartment still isn’t on the building map.

They consistently raise the rent where we are now paying $1350. On top of that they require we pay $35 a month for “membership perks”. To date I haven’t gotten a solid answer as to what that is beyond that it includes renters insurance and that it allows us to earn points with Piñata. The renters insurance is so bad I’ve had to buy my own. And in all that time I’ve only earned 600 points with Piñata which bought me a medium coffee at Dunkin.

I was just overstimulated as fck all the time. Any tiny pause in my day and my phone was already in my hand and it got me tired at a point.

The worst part was how uncomfortable silence felt. Simple moments like waiting in line, walking or sitting alone for a minute felt extremely hard to do nothing. I always had that FOMO, so I would often check my phone in those times.

So I stopped trying to “use my phone less” and tried to fix my attention instead. I started watching podcasts (Cal Newport) and reading books (Dopamine Nation) that helped me get some ideas and methods to combat this addiction I had.

First thing, no phone for the first hour after waking up. No scrolling, no msgs, no news. Just coffee, moving around, letting my brain boot up. First week sucked. After that, mornings felt way less chaotic luckily.

Second, I only pick up my phone for one reason. If I open it to reply to someone, I reply and put it down. No reward scroll after. Sounds stupid but this one broke the autopilot loop hard.

Third, I replaced fast dopamine with slower stuff. Long walks with no podcast. Music without doing anything else. Writing random thoughts instead of checking apps. Way less exciting, but my brain calmed the fck down.

Fourth, I got clear on what I actually want to work toward. Once I had something real to build, scrolling felt way less tempting. Using stuff like Notion app and Purposa app helped me organize goals and focus on real progress.

Fifth, I pushed all the fun to night time. If I wanna scroll or watch dumb videos, fine. Just not all day. Knowing it’s there later makes it easier to not reach for it constantly.

At first everything felt boring as shit. Then slowly focus came back and now I can concentrate easily (obviously in tasks that I like haha)

Don’t think I am monk now and I don’t scroll anymore. I still scroll sometimes. I still waste time. But now my phone feels like a tool again, and that’s a relief for me. That alone changed way more than any productivity trick I ever tried.

What methods actually helped you use your phone less and use it in a more productive way? Would love to hear your methods/tools/apps!

Hope this helps you as it did for me, I wish all of you the best in this 2026!",1,1769711147.0,MensDiscipline,0,1.0,False

Wouldn’t they have crossed paths sooner in this small town? How long has his diner been a diner? Because it seems like Lorelai always would’ve gone there for coffee, even when Rory was small. When everyone knows everyone, it seems strange to me.

Also, how long was Rachel gone for before she came back? Wouldn’t Lorelai have known about her if she knew Luke for 9 years, or are we to believe he dated her 9 years ago and then she slides right back into his life? If not, how did Lorelai not know about her?

In the early seasons it’s not clear their level of closeness but then later they allude to Luke always being there for Rory. He’s in some ways super involved early on Like building the huppah for her wedding to Max, but Lorelai doesn’t know who he’s dated or about his sister? Idk. It just seems to not line up.

# Swiss Coffee OC-45 in Denver Country Club Historic Homes — Technical Guide from Local Pros

**Flair:** LOCAL SERVICES • HISTORIC HOMES • INTERIOR DESIGN • COLOR PALETTES  
**Area:** **Denver Country Club Historic District (80209)**

For Denver homeowners in the Country Club and Cherry Creek North areas, paint color performance matters as much as appearance. At 5,280 feet, higher UV exposure and sharper light make flaws, undertones, and durability issues show faster—especially in historic plaster homes.

At **DAECO Painting (serving Denver since 2003)**, we’ve completed 400+ Swiss Coffee projects across central Denver. Benjamin Moore **Swiss Coffee OC-45** consistently delivers the most reliable results in these environments.

Here’s the practical breakdown:

# Why Swiss Coffee Works in Denver

* **LRV 82**: Brightens rooms without glare
* Warm undertone offsets Denver’s blue daylight
* Holds color better than gray-based whites under high UV
* Performs well in north, south, and west exposures

Cool whites often shift gray or feel institutional in Denver. Swiss Coffee maintains warmth and consistency over time.

# Prep Is Non-Negotiable (Especially in Historic Homes)

Proper results depend on preparation:

* HEPA dust extraction during sanding
* 180-grit surface profiling for adhesion
* High-hiding primer to neutralize legacy beige/gray

Skipping these steps leads to texture issues and premature wear—regardless of paint brand.

# Application by Surface

Each substrate requires a different system:

* **Walls / ceilings:** Benjamin Moore Regal Select Matte (precision roll)
* **Trim / doors:** Fine Paints of Europe Satin (airless spray)
* **Cabinetry:** HVLP fine finish for smooth, factory-grade results

This approach eliminates brush marks, lap lines, and early breakdown in high-traffic areas.

# Most Reliable Trim Pairings with Swiss Coffee

From our Denver projects:

* **White Dove OC-17** (most common)
* **Cloud White OC-130** (brighter option)
* **Decorator’s White OC-149** (maximum contrast, still warm)

We avoid pairing Swiss Coffee with ultra-cool whites like Chantilly Lace or Ultra Pure White—this is the main cause of “yellow wall” complaints.

# Recent Country Club Case (1927 Tudor)

* Swiss Coffee on walls
* White Dove on trim (Fine Paints of Europe Satin)
* Custom ceiling blend in low bedrooms
* HVLP cabinetry finish

Results after follow-up:

* Zero color callbacks
* Improved durability on original millwork
* Balanced light reflectance in north rooms

1qqglki,https://chronoatlas.nl/,Time Travel through ancient history Chronoatlas,"I’ve spent an embarrassing amount of time obsessed with something most people probably find boring: old maps.

You know those old nostalgic moments when you fall into a Wikipedia rabbit hole at 2AM reading about Roman engineering or random historical events? That’s basically been my life for the past few years.

So I built the thing I always wished existed: ChronoAtlas, an interactive historical map explorer where you can dive into different eras and explore how the ancient world looked.

Right now you can explore things like the Roman Empire, Alexander the Great’s empire, the Ottoman Empire, and the Dutch Golden Age. On top of that, there are historical layers you can toggle, including ancient battles, sieges, political events, religious milestones, trade routes, and thousands of ancient locations.

The part that honestly gets me emotional is when you zoom into a random place and realize people lived there, traded there, and fell in love there thousands of years ago. Most of the time History classes gave us dates to memorize, I wanted to build something that gives people stories and a sense of connection instead.

Tech-wise (if you care), it’s built with a Laravel backend, MapLibre GL for map rendering, georeferenced historical maps from museum archives, and way too much coffee.

It’s completely free. No ads. No login walls. No “subscribe to unlock more” nonsense. I’d genuinely love for people to explore it and tell me what feels broken, what they like, or what regions they’d want to see added next.

If even one person discovers something cool about history through this, all the time I poured into it feels worth it.

1qqgkum,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1qqgkum/i_found_him/,I found him,"Life is cruel. People are born into a world built only on destruction, forced to become another cog in the wheel of hell we call society. The ones we deem weak are cast aside into a never ending sea of shame and fear while the strongest thrive on their misery.

My father was a scientist. He worked in a secret laboratory tucked away in rural America, about 3 hours away from the nearest piece of civilization. I was never told about what he did at his job; I don’t think we were allowed to know. Sometimes he would come home reeking of vomit and formaldehyde. Sometimes he’d be angry or depressed about his ‘experiments’ going wrong; other times it was like he’d just won the lottery. My mother and I would be showered in gifts and treats while our questions about his work were brushed off with a wave of a hand.

Everyone in the lab disappeared when I was eight years old.

There was no trace, no clues, anything. There was only an empty building with floors covered in scattered notes and test tubes waiting to be used. They shut down the building after two weeks. My mother packed up what little we had and moved us across America to live with my grandparents. We never got our answers, we never got closure, we just ran. I spent years trying to learn what had happened. I would spend everyday researching the facility my father worked in, the people he worked with, the experiments they did. There was nothing. It was like everyone that worked there was wiped off the face of the earth, like they never even existed. Like they were nothing. I spent years looking for answers, looking for an explanation for why everyone disappeared and the entire site was abandoned… but there was nothing. I failed.

My mother was diagnosed with stage three stomach cancer when I was seventeen. She refused chemotherapy, something I still don’t understand, and spent her last days at home with her parents and a caretaker. I spent a lot of time away from home during that period and it was selfish. She needed me and I couldn’t bring myself to go near her, couldn’t stand the idea of seeing her in pain. So I kept my distance like a coward. A fool.

She was taking scheduled medicines, something my grandparents begged her to do to lessen the pain. On one of the rare occasions of me being home, I was convinced by my grandmother to wake her for her usual dosage. I walked up to the bed, turned on the lamp on the bedside table, and shook her shoulder.

“Mom, grandma said it’s time for your medicine.”

She didn’t say anything. I frowned and crouched beside the bed.

“Mom I know you don’t like it, but you gotta get up and take them. Then you can go right back to bed.”

Still, nothing. I rose from my crouching position and rolled her onto her back. Her eyes were shut, mouth just barely open, like she was in some deep sleep. I shook her again.

“Mom, wake up.”

Nothing. I shook a little harder.

“Mom.”

A heavy ball of anxiety formed in the pit of my stomach. I shook harder.

“Mom!”

Her body flailed against the bed.

“Mama you gotta wake up, please!”

I began to cry at the sight of her head lolling back and forth from the force, the way her arms lay limp at her sides. My grandfather had to pry me off her corpse when they came to see what was happening. All I could do was sob and thrash in his arms, screaming for her to wake up until my voice gave out and all I could let out were hoarse whimpers. The funeral was small. We cremated her.

I lived with my grandparents another three years before deciding to go through her stuff. It was just sitting in her old room collecting dust anyway. It was mainly furniture and old documents. My birth certificate, my parents marriage certificate, some old items from her childhood. I found some old necklaces and a ring in a little jewelry box. It had a silver band and a rose shaped charm over an amethyst. My mothers birthstone. Her wedding ring. I slipped it over my ring finger and kept sifting through boxes. There was one tucked away at the back of the pile; it was small and covered with dust. After managing to pull it out from under a pile of blankets, I split the tape with a pocket knife and opened it. It was a stack of books. Microbiology, engineering, chemistry, etc. At the top of the stack, placed so neatly in the middle of a botany book, was a photo.

It was my father.

He was standing in a nursery, hands curled around the bar of a white crib. His hair, a peppering of black and gray even at such a young age, was slicked back like it always used to be. He was wearing a sweater vest, a deep blue, which laid over a black pair of slacks. His wedding ring gleamed in the sunlight drifting in from the window to his left. The walls were painted a soft blue with little clouds and birds littering the part closest to the ceiling, leaving small snow tipped mountains at the bottom. I squinted at the bottom of the photo where I could see his pointer finger reaching into the crib from where he was holding it. And just barely in frame, a small hand, reaching out for the finger above. My breath hitched. My eyes blurred with tears. 

That was me. Me and my father. Before he was hired, before his time was consumed with experiments and late nights at the lab, before he disappeared from my life entirely.

I sobbed. I felt broken, hopeless. The two people I thought were going to be there for me till the end of time ended up leaving me with the broken remains of a life I never asked for. My fingers curled around the side of the frame, lifting the photo from the box. I stared at it, hand clenching until knuckles turned white and it shook from the force.

I threw it.

The photo hit the wall with a thump before falling to the ground with a sharp crack of glass. My shoulders slumped as I stared at the mess, glass scattered across the hardwood floor and photo peeking out from underneath the still intact brass frame. I broke it. Just like everything else I touch.

I crawled towards the frame, grabbing a trash bag on the way over. Settling on my knees beside it, I tugged open the bag before starting to pick up the broken shards one by one. A few of them scraped and stabbed against flesh, dripping blood down pale skin, but I kept going. The pain was okay. It was nice. Familiar. I continued to scoop up the broken pieces, dropping them into the bag and listening to the soft clinking sounds they made with each drop against another piece. I wasn’t paying much attention to where I was grabbing, I was sort of on autopilot. Just reaching and placing, the same movement of arm over and over again. But when my hand stopped over the trashcan and let go, there was no clink. There was no sound whatsoever. Instead, I felt something brush against my leg. Looking down, I saw it.

A note.

It was old paper, slightly beige and stained with a ring of coffee. Unfolding the paper, there was a large paragraph written in sloppy cursive. It took a while, but I managed to piece together what it said.

*There isn’t much time, my love. What we are doing in this place, the sins we’ve committed, they are catching up to us. George hasn’t been in the lab for weeks now and Alicia disappeared two days ago. People are being secretive and others have begun to go mad. This may be the last piece of contact between us. Please, take our boy and run far away before you meet the same fate as I.*

*I love you from the sun to the moon,*

*Walter*

A letter to my mother. Written so hastily like there was no time left for more. It was just a simple request. Leave. Leave and never come back to that horrid place where our lives seemed to end. My fathers disappearance and the disappearances of everyone he worked with wasn’t as simple as packing their bags and relocating without a word. Something had been after them. The government, a coworker, anything. Someone was responsible for this. Someone shattered my life and many others. They took my father from me, and I wasn’t going to let them get away with it for any longer.

The car rolled slowly into town as I looked briefly towards a sign on the side of the road. Coalfell is what it read. Thirty-nine hours later and I was finally here. I parked outside a general store that looked like it’d seen better days, and did a quick search through my backpack. I needed a flashlight, some water, and some snacks. Just enough to hold out for the next couple of days while I investigated the old lab.

Getting out of the car, I gave a brief nod to a family walking by and made my way into the store. The bell above the door gave a soft jingle as it opened and I noticed the burly man behind the counter looking up from the magazine he was browsing. He set it aside as I walked up to the counter.

“Morning. Do you have any flashlights? Maybe some batteries too..?”

“Flashlights? Maybe.. I’ll go check.”

“Thanks.”

As he walked off, I began to browse the shelves. I grabbed a few bags of chips and some candy bars, along with a couple water bottles and energy drinks. Just as I began to set everything on the counter, the man came back and set a flashlight down along with two packs of triple A batteries.

“Here y’are, son. Do you need anything else?”

“Uhm..” I did a quick look over the store before shaking my head “No, this is all.”

After giving a brief nod, the man started scanning the items and placing them in a plastic bag behind the counter. I rocked back and forth on the heels of my feet as I watched, eyes trained on the way he stuffed each item into the bag with little care.

“Hey.”

“Huh?” I looked up to see the man staring me down

“Don’t think I've seen you around here before.” He scanned a bag of chips “you vistin’ or somethin’?”

“Uh, yeah! Just- y’know.” I shrugged, looking down at tattered sneakers “vacation and stuff.”

“Don’t know why you chose this place.” he snorted “Ain’t shit to do ‘round here.”

I let out a small chuckle, shoulders raising in a shrug “just… memories, I guess. I used to live here when I was a kid.”

He gave another snort at that, placing the last few items into the bag before sliding it towards me. “Then welcome back.” he glanced at the register before looking back ""That'll be fifteen-sixty.”

I stuck my credit card into the machine, waiting a few seconds before pulling it back out when it beeped. Picking up the bag, I nodded at the man and smiled.

“Thank you Mr…” I squinted at his nametag “Otis.”

The corner of his lips turned upward as he shrugged “hey, it’s no problem. I hope you have a good day-” His hand waved for me to finish the sentence and I couldn't help but chuckle while turning away.

“Aristotle.”

The bell gave another jingle as I opened the door and left with a bit more pep in my step than I started out with; though it dissolved as I heard Otis whisper something about *‘Walters boy’* as the door shut behind me.

The sky had grown dark by the time I’d begun to make the drive to the lab. I’d spent the day booking a room at the local inn where the workers there gawked at me like some kind of freak after learning my name. The waitress at the diner I'd had supper in had done the same and I considered walking out on the bill at some point. But for what little time I was going to spend here, I wanted to make good impressions. 

But now it was just me, the road illuminated by the car's headlights, and the staticky country music spouting from the radio. Although it only took half an hour before I started switching through the channels for something more clear. By some miracle, the static finally shifted into the clear voice of a pastor.

“-iveness is not an excuse. Forgiveness is not forgetting. And forgiveness is not reconciling. Forgiveness is a decision given by the grace of God!”

A wolf howled in the distance to the moon hanging above; illuminating the dark forest lining the road to block it from sight. Like the road was a secret that no one may lay their gaze upon.

“Some hurts are far more serious and painful than a common argument, so we desire revenge. Forgiveness means giving that up because God is judge; not us.”

The pastor's voice slowly broke apart into static as the car drove deeper down the path. I cursed under my breath and started fiddling with the radio, eyes darting between it and the road. The atmosphere was creepy enough, I didn’t need total silence added to the mixture. But after two more minutes of complete static, I finally gave up and turned the radio off.

The silence was suffocating. 

And unfortunately for me; I was now alone with my thoughts.

*‘Why are you even doing this?’* That one popped up a lot. Probably because I can never find the answer.

*‘What would mom say if she saw you now?’* She’d probably be begging me to come back home; to give up on my father.

*‘What are you even going to say when you find him?’* I don’t know.

*‘What if you just crashed the car and ended this nonsense?’*

Okay. That one was new. I turned the radio back on and focused entirely on the static that filled the car. It actually started to feel peaceful. The loud buzzing blocked out the thoughts that tried to crawl up from the darkest chambers of my mind. The ones I refused to humor because If they were to be acknowledged, who knew what they’d make me do. So I welcomed the buzzing and even started to grow tired from the calming rhythm but just before my eyes could attempt to flutter shut, a scream broke through the trees. It was sharp and higher pitched. A woman.

I didn’t stop. What was I supposed to do? It was pitch black and who knows how many acres of forest between me and that woman. If I attempted to go after her, I'd probably meet whatever fate she had. So I whispered a prayer, and kept driving.

But karma has a funny way of catching up.

The headlights caught on a mound in the road and my foot stomped down on the brakes. The car screeched to a stop just before I could hit whatever was blocking the path. I couldn’t tell exactly what it was. Maybe a fallen tree? A wounded animal? Perhaps it was even that woman I'd heard earlier. Maybe she had escaped whatever she had encountered and made her way to the nearest sign of safety. My hand moved for the window. I was going to lower it, just a fraction, and call out. If it *was* a living being, it probably needed help. I could spare some time driving back to town. My finger pressed against the button. The window hissed.

The pile moved.

Slow at first; like it was taking a breath. Then it began to stretch out, one pawed hand digging into concrete as another pressed down to lift. It was big. A tall beast covered in graying fur that was darkened with an oozing red substance. A tail, almost five feet on its own and with the pattern of a skunk, drug along the floor as it began to turn towards the car. My breath caught as two pairs of eyes, glowing in the darkness, locked onto me through the windshield. It did nothing at first; just stared with elongated jaw gaping open and mouth dripping thick globs of saliva. Its nose twitched once. It’s head cocked.

It screamed. Sharp and deafening. A mimic of the one I had heard before.

The glass shattered.

The moon still hung above when I finally woke up, soft beams of light peeking through the various trees surrounding the area. I was laying in a sort of nest-like structure crafted from dead leaves, rotting branches, and bloody scraps of clothing. Lab coats.

I attempted to force myself up, only for a sharp pain to surge through my right leg and cause me to tumble back to the ground. My chest heaved with ragged breaths, one hand clutching at the front of my shirt. Something was broken, shattered, strained? It didn’t matter. What matters is that *something* was wrong and I was stuck here. My car was gone, my things were gone, my arms and face were punctured with glass fragments.

And there, just barely peeking out from behind a tree, were two pairs of eyes.

I attempted to get away, crawling backwards out of the nest as the creature drew closer. My hand, stained with the blood dripping down my arms, wrapped around a still intact branch to swing it forward and create a barrier between me and this monster.

“Stay back!” I shrieked while swinging my arm wildly, managing to hit the creature a few times on the head.

The beast reacted to the blows, though not in the way I expected. I was expecting an outburst, anger, to be attacked. But it didn’t attack. Instead, the creature took two steps back then lowered its head to the ground like a trained dog. The bottom pair of eyes, with Iris’s covering most of the sclera, darted between my face and the branch. The top pair, small and beady like humans, closed slowly. It was like the creature was trying to appear gentle; docile.

And forgive me for my idiocy; but I hesitated.

There was something about this submissive act, something about the way it just so easily *gave up,* that I couldn't stop thinking about. 

I lowered the branch and laid it carefully along my lap before raising my hands. I turned them side to side, showing that I no longer had a weapon. The creature blinked, gave a soft snort, then stood. One paw stepped forward in a testing motion, body freezing as if waiting for my permission to come closer. I nodded.

It came at me with more confidence, head lowered in a show of kindness. My shoulders trembled as its wet snout pressed briefly to the side of my neck before it pulled back to meet my gaze. Its jaw worked to open slowly, muscles pulling with sickening crackles and wet pops. I gagged as a long barbed tongue lolled out of its mouth, smelling of rotted flesh and chemicals. It took everything in me not to vomit as the appendage moved slowly to meet the flesh of my arm. The creature's tongue worked along bloodied skin, knocking out glass pieces with as gentle care as it could manage. Once one arm was done, it moved to work on the other. When both arms were done, it looked at me. I could see its eyes dart to the glass embedded in my cheeks. A brief whimper escaped me. I nodded.

Saliva smeared across my face as glass fragments were knocked out of skin and blood was licked clean. The creature knocked its head against mine once the work was done and I was declared healed, though it was quick to focus on my leg when it moved and I cried out in pain. It sniffed at the limb, snout pressing against fabric as low growls rumbled from deep within its chest. It huffed, turned, and fled.

At first I hadn’t even realized it was gone. I was so focused on wiping myself clean of its mouth fluids that I didn’t know it had disappeared until I finally looked up and realized I was alone.

“Hello?” I frowned, eyes scanning the trees.

Maybe it had lost interest in me and decided to find something better to do. Whatever reason it was, it gave me the perfect chance to escape. If I found the road again, I could follow it all the way back to town and warn everyone about what was out there in the forest.

My hands pressed against the grass beneath me, arms wobbling as I tried to force myself up. My shoes dug into the dirt for better balance and I managed to stand upright and take one wobbly step forward before falling to my knees.

“No! Get up you useless piece of shit!”

I tried again, stepped forward once, then fell. Curses fell from my mouth as I tried again and again, falling each time. My vision blurred with tears as I launched myself forward, arms reaching to grab onto *anything.* I fell.

And landed on the monster.

The beast gave a curious grunt as I landed on top of it, snout pressing into my stomach as my arms fell limp to dangle on either side of its head. I felt it move from beneath me, walking us back to the nest where it lowered so I could slide slowly back into the space. I lay limp now, staring silently at the creature hovering above me with twigs hanging from its jaw. The same twigs that were then dumped unceremoniously onto my chest before it sat back with light coos falling from hanging mouth. My hand moved to brush against one of the twigs and its tail noticeably began to wag in a fast pace. My hand moved away, and it stilled. Sitting up, I let the pile fall into my lap as eyes drifted to the abomination to my right.

“What is this?”

Its ears perked.

“Are you trying to bury me or something?”

A huff. Its snout nudged in the direction of my injured leg. I looked down at it, then the twigs, then the beast.

“This is for… my leg?”

It threw its head back for a cheerful howl, front paws pounding against the dirt beneath it. I let out an almost amused snort and brushed the twigs from off my lap. Of course it was. Why wouldn’t this demonic creature know how to make a makeshift cast?

It was watching me now so I made light work of straightening out my leg and checking the damages. It didn’t look broken, it was probably just a really bad sprain. Either way, I grabbed a few of the twigs and pressed them to each side of my leg. I held them for exactly ten seconds before letting out a sigh.

“I need something to secure them.”

The creature let out a soft growl of frustration, eyes scanning the nest as it began to walk around with its nose nudging against leaves and clothing. Soon, it bit down on a still intact lab coat and drug it over to lay it carefully over my leg.

“Thanks.” I mumbled while pulling it off and underneath my leg. “Press on these.” 

I tapped the twigs. It leaned in and pressed them into place with its snout. I held the other side with one hand as the other pulled one side of the coat over my leg then pulled up the other. Once I had a good grip, I shooed the creature away and began tying the coat with as tight of a knot as I could manage. Just as I was giving it one last tug, a card fell from one of the pockets. Curious, I picked it up and turned it over. It looked like some kind of keycard all the scientists used to wear. It had their name, age, and was used to access any part of the labs that weren’t restricted. My thumb brushed over the blood on the front to reveal the name beneath it.

Walter. This was my *fathers* card.

I gasped and the card fell from now trembling hands. Sensing the shift in the air, the creature moved in to peek at the card now laying in the dirt. Its ears shot upward, eyes glancing once in my direction before it grabbed it with sharp teeth.

I lunged.

The beast let out a whimper as I jumped onto it, body spinning in circles to shake me off like an annoying bug. But I persisted, hand grabbing at the other side of the card and pulling as hard as I could manage while my other arm remained looped around its neck. My feet dragged along the floor, heels digging in to try and form some kind of anchor.

“Give it back you bastard! I’ll kill you! What did you do to my father?!”

It stilled, mouth opening to drop the card. My arm loosened around its neck and I fell to the ground with a grunt before forcing myself up on shaky legs.

“Fuck you.” I growled while pointing a finger at it. It whimpered and sat back.

With an angry huff, I turned and began limping my way out of the small clearing and hopefully in the direction of the road. And if it wasn’t the road? That’s fine. There had to be an end to this forest at some point.

“Fa…”

I froze. Turned. It was sitting there, exactly where I had left it. Its mouth hung open and I could see its tongue working to form words.

“Fa-ath.”

I dropped to my knees in shock, nodding along as it tried to let out one single word.

“Fath…her–”

A noise left me, something between a gasp and a cry. Hands moved to fist into hair as I nodded rapidly towards it.

“Y-yes. My father– What happened to my father?”

It shifted, huffed, and tried again.

“Art…tie.”

My mind blanked. Artie. That’s what my father used to call me. 

The creature stood now, bones giving soft pops as it strode forward. Once close, it leaned in and pressed its snout to my forehead.

“Artiiiie…”

I started to cry now, hands falling from hair to tremble in the air on either side of the monster's face. Its head lolled, dipping into my hand and rubbing matted fur against soft palm. My breath hitched with a sob.

*“Dad?*”

The beast froze for only a second, chest rumbling with an almost sad growl. Then it shifted, tongue moving to lick gently up the side of my face in slow motions, catching my tears. I could only sit there and cry, hands brushing against the matted fur of the monster that had once been my parent.

“Oh dad… what did you do?”

A whimper escaped my father as he pulled back with his head hanging in shame. The message was clear. He did this to himself. Maybe an experiment went wrong or, perhaps he even *wanted* to do this to himself. Looking at the sadness in those mutated eyes, I don’t think it was the second option.

“Dad?” I reached out, petting a hand against the fur on the top of his head. “What happened to everyone?”

Another whimper. He pulled back, turned, and howled. Off in the distance just beyond the forest, another one echoed out. My breath caught as it rang out for a few seconds longer before the world fell silent around us. My father peeked at me and gave a short huff. I frowned. Everyone was still out there, possibly turned into more of these creatures. Those experiments they were doing… the way my father smelt whenever he’d return home. It was ungodly acts they committed in that building, but no one deserved a fate like this.

I stood, wobbling slightly on my right leg, then reached out to press my hands to the fur on my fathers back.

People are born into a world built only on destruction, forced to become another cog in the wheel of hell we call society. The ones we deem weak are cast aside into a never ending sea of shame and fear while the strongest thrive on their misery.

My father was a scientist. He worked in a secret laboratory tucked away in rural America, about 3 hours away from the nearest piece of civilization. I was never told about what he did at his job; I don’t think we were allowed to know. Sometimes he would come home reeking of vomit and formaldehyde. Sometimes he’d be angry or depressed about his ‘experiments’ going wrong; other times it was like he’d just won the lottery. My mother and I would be showered in gifts and treats while our questions about his work were brushed off with a wave of a hand.

Everyone in the lab disappeared when I was eight years old.

There was no trace, no clues, anything. There was only an empty building with floors covered in scattered notes and test tubes waiting to be used. They shut down the building after two weeks. My mother packed up what little we had and moved us across America to live with my grandparents. We never got our answers, we never got closure, we just ran. I spent years trying to learn what had happened. I would spend everyday researching the facility my father worked in, the people he worked with, the experiments they did. There was nothing. It was like everyone that worked there was wiped off the face of the earth, like they never even existed. Like they were nothing. I spent years looking for answers, looking for an explanation for why everyone disappeared and the entire site was abandoned… but there was nothing. I failed.

My mother was diagnosed with stage three stomach cancer when I was seventeen. She refused chemotherapy, something I still don’t understand, and spent her last days at home with her parents and a caretaker. I spent a lot of time away from home during that period and it was selfish. She needed me and I couldn’t bring myself to go near her, couldn’t stand the idea of seeing her in pain. So I kept my distance like a coward. A fool.

She was taking scheduled medicines, something my grandparents begged her to do to lessen the pain. On one of the rare occasions of me being home, I was convinced by my grandmother to wake her for her usual dosage. I walked up to the bed, turned on the lamp on the bedside table, and shook her shoulder.

“Mom, grandma said it’s time for your medicine.”

She didn’t say anything. I frowned and crouched beside the bed.

“Mom I know you don’t like it, but you gotta get up and take them. Then you can go right back to bed.”

Still, nothing. I rose from my crouching position and rolled her onto her back. Her eyes were shut, mouth just barely open, like she was in some deep sleep. I shook her again.

“Mom, wake up.”

Nothing. I shook a little harder.

“Mom.”

A heavy ball of anxiety formed in the pit of my stomach. I shook harder.

“Mom!”

Her body flailed against the bed.

“Mama you gotta wake up, please!”

I began to cry at the sight of her head lolling back and forth from the force, the way her arms lay limp at her sides. My grandfather had to pry me off her corpse when they came to see what was happening. All I could do was sob and thrash in his arms, screaming for her to wake up until my voice gave out and all I could let out were hoarse whimpers. The funeral was small. We cremated her.

I lived with my grandparents another three years before deciding to go through her stuff. It was just sitting in her old room collecting dust anyway. It was mainly furniture and old documents. My birth certificate, my parents marriage certificate, some old items from her childhood. I found some old necklaces and a ring in a little jewelry box. It had a silver band and a rose shaped charm over an amethyst. My mothers birthstone. Her wedding ring. I slipped it over my ring finger and kept sifting through boxes. There was one tucked away at the back of the pile; it was small and covered with dust. After managing to pull it out from under a pile of blankets, I split the tape with a pocket knife and opened it. It was a stack of books. Microbiology, engineering, chemistry, etc. At the top of the stack, placed so neatly in the middle of a botany book, was a photo.

It was my father.

He was standing in a nursery, hands curled around the bar of a white crib. His hair, a peppering of black and gray even at such a young age, was slicked back like it always used to be. He was wearing a sweater vest, a deep blue, which laid over a black pair of slacks. His wedding ring gleamed in the sunlight drifting in from the window to his left. The walls were painted a soft blue with little clouds and birds littering the part closest to the ceiling, leaving small snow tipped mountains at the bottom. I squinted at the bottom of the photo where I could see his pointer finger reaching into the crib from where he was holding it. And just barely in frame, a small hand, reaching out for the finger above. My breath hitched. My eyes blurred with tears. 

That was me. Me and my father. Before he was hired, before his time was consumed with experiments and late nights at the lab, before he disappeared from my life entirely.

I sobbed. I felt broken, hopeless. The two people I thought were going to be there for me till the end of time ended up leaving me with the broken remains of a life I never asked for. My fingers curled around the side of the frame, lifting the photo from the box. I stared at it, hand clenching until knuckles turned white and it shook from the force.

I threw it.

The photo hit the wall with a thump before falling to the ground with a sharp crack of glass. My shoulders slumped as I stared at the mess, glass scattered across the hardwood floor and photo peeking out from underneath the still intact brass frame. I broke it. Just like everything else I touch.

I crawled towards the frame, grabbing a trash bag on the way over. Settling on my knees beside it, I tugged open the bag before starting to pick up the broken shards one by one. A few of them scraped and stabbed against flesh, dripping blood down pale skin, but I kept going. The pain was okay. It was nice. Familiar. I continued to scoop up the broken pieces, dropping them into the bag and listening to the soft clinking sounds they made with each drop against another piece. I wasn’t paying much attention to where I was grabbing, I was sort of on autopilot. Just reaching and placing, the same movement of arm over and over again. But when my hand stopped over the trashcan and let go, there was no clink. There was no sound whatsoever. Instead, I felt something brush against my leg. Looking down, I saw it.

A note.

It was old paper, slightly beige and stained with a ring of coffee. Unfolding the paper, there was a large paragraph written in sloppy cursive. It took a while, but I managed to piece together what it said.

*There isn’t much time, my love. What we are doing in this place, the sins we’ve committed, they are catching up to us. George hasn’t been in the lab for weeks now and Alicia disappeared two days ago. People are being secretive and others have begun to go mad. This may be the last piece of contact between us. Please, take our boy and run far away before you meet the same fate as I.*

*I love you from the sun to the moon,*

*Walter*

A letter to my mother. Written so hastily like there was no time left for more. It was just a simple request. Leave. Leave and never come back to that horrid place where our lives seemed to end. My fathers disappearance and the disappearances of everyone he worked with wasn’t as simple as packing their bags and relocating without a word. Something had been after them. The government, a coworker, anything. Someone was responsible for this. Someone shattered my life and many others. They took my father from me, and I wasn’t going to let them get away with it for any longer.

The car rolled slowly into town as I looked briefly towards a sign on the side of the road. Coalfell is what it read. Thirty-nine hours later and I was finally here. I parked outside a general store that looked like it’d seen better days, and did a quick search through my backpack. I needed a flashlight, some water, and some snacks. Just enough to hold out for the next couple of days while I investigated the old lab.

Getting out of the car, I gave a brief nod to a family walking by and made my way into the store. The bell above the door gave a soft jingle as it opened and I noticed the burly man behind the counter looking up from the magazine he was browsing. He set it aside as I walked up to the counter.

“Morning. Do you have any flashlights? Maybe some batteries too..?”

“Flashlights? Maybe.. I’ll go check.”

“Thanks.”

As he walked off, I began to browse the shelves. I grabbed a few bags of chips and some candy bars, along with a couple water bottles and energy drinks. Just as I began to set everything on the counter, the man came back and set a flashlight down along with two packs of triple A batteries.

“Here y’are, son. Do you need anything else?”

“Uhm..” I did a quick look over the store before shaking my head “No, this is all.”

After giving a brief nod, the man started scanning the items and placing them in a plastic bag behind the counter. I rocked back and forth on the heels of my feet as I watched, eyes trained on the way he stuffed each item into the bag with little care.

“Hey.”

“Huh?” I looked up to see the man staring me down

“Don’t think I've seen you around here before.” He scanned a bag of chips “you vistin’ or somethin’?”

“Uh, yeah! Just- y’know.” I shrugged, looking down at tattered sneakers “vacation and stuff.”

“Don’t know why you chose this place.” he snorted “Ain’t shit to do ‘round here.”

I let out a small chuckle, shoulders raising in a shrug “just… memories, I guess. I used to live here when I was a kid.”

He gave another snort at that, placing the last few items into the bag before sliding it towards me. “Then welcome back.” he glanced at the register before looking back ""That'll be fifteen-sixty.”

I stuck my credit card into the machine, waiting a few seconds before pulling it back out when it beeped. Picking up the bag, I nodded at the man and smiled.

“Thank you Mr…” I squinted at his nametag “Otis.”

The corner of his lips turned upward as he shrugged “hey, it’s no problem. I hope you have a good day-” His hand waved for me to finish the sentence and I couldn't help but chuckle while turning away.

“Aristotle.”

The bell gave another jingle as I opened the door and left with a bit more pep in my step than I started out with; though it dissolved as I heard Otis whisper something about *‘Walters boy’* as the door shut behind me.

The sky had grown dark by the time I’d begun to make the drive to the lab. I’d spent the day booking a room at the local inn where the workers there gawked at me like some kind of freak after learning my name. The waitress at the diner I'd had supper in had done the same and I considered walking out on the bill at some point. But for what little time I was going to spend here, I wanted to make good impressions. 

But now it was just me, the road illuminated by the car's headlights, and the staticky country music spouting from the radio. Although it only took half an hour before I started switching through the channels for something more clear. By some miracle, the static finally shifted into the clear voice of a pastor.

“-iveness is not an excuse. Forgiveness is not forgetting. And forgiveness is not reconciling. Forgiveness is a decision given by the grace of God!”

A wolf howled in the distance to the moon hanging above; illuminating the dark forest lining the road to block it from sight. Like the road was a secret that no one may lay their gaze upon.

“Some hurts are far more serious and painful than a common argument, so we desire revenge. Forgiveness means giving that up because God is judge; not us.”

The pastor's voice slowly broke apart into static as the car drove deeper down the path. I cursed under my breath and started fiddling with the radio, eyes darting between it and the road. The atmosphere was creepy enough, I didn’t need total silence added to the mixture. But after two more minutes of complete static, I finally gave up and turned the radio off.

The silence was suffocating. 

And unfortunately for me; I was now alone with my thoughts.

*‘Why are you even doing this?’* That one popped up a lot. Probably because I can never find the answer.

*‘What would mom say if she saw you now?’* She’d probably be begging me to come back home; to give up on my father.

*‘What are you even going to say when you find him?’* I don’t know.

*‘What if you just crashed the car and ended this nonsense?’*

Okay. That one was new. I turned the radio back on and focused entirely on the static that filled the car. It actually started to feel peaceful. The loud buzzing blocked out the thoughts that tried to crawl up from the darkest chambers of my mind. The ones I refused to humor because If they were to be acknowledged, who knew what they’d make me do. So I welcomed the buzzing and even started to grow tired from the calming rhythm but just before my eyes could attempt to flutter shut, a scream broke through the trees. It was sharp and higher pitched. A woman.

I didn’t stop. What was I supposed to do? It was pitch black and who knows how many acres of forest between me and that woman. If I attempted to go after her, I'd probably meet whatever fate she had. So I whispered a prayer, and kept driving.

But karma has a funny way of catching up.

The headlights caught on a mound in the road and my foot stomped down on the brakes. The car screeched to a stop just before I could hit whatever was blocking the path. I couldn’t tell exactly what it was. Maybe a fallen tree? A wounded animal? Perhaps it was even that woman I'd heard earlier. Maybe she had escaped whatever she had encountered and made her way to the nearest sign of safety. My hand moved for the window. I was going to lower it, just a fraction, and call out. If it *was* a living being, it probably needed help. I could spare some time driving back to town. My finger pressed against the button. The window hissed.

The pile moved.

Slow at first; like it was taking a breath. Then it began to stretch out, one pawed hand digging into concrete as another pressed down to lift. It was big. A tall beast covered in graying fur that was darkened with an oozing red substance. A tail, almost five feet on its own and with the pattern of a skunk, drug along the floor as it began to turn towards the car. My breath caught as two pairs of eyes, glowing in the darkness, locked onto me through the windshield. It did nothing at first; just stared with elongated jaw gaping open and mouth dripping thick globs of saliva. Its nose twitched once. It’s head cocked.

It screamed. Sharp and deafening. A mimic of the one I had heard before.

The glass shattered.

The moon still hung above when I finally woke up, soft beams of light peeking through the various trees surrounding the area. I was laying in a sort of nest-like structure crafted from dead leaves, rotting branches, and bloody scraps of clothing. Lab coats.

I attempted to force myself up, only for a sharp pain to surge through my right leg and cause me to tumble back to the ground. My chest heaved with ragged breaths, one hand clutching at the front of my shirt. Something was broken, shattered, strained? It didn’t matter. What matters is that *something* was wrong and I was stuck here. My car was gone, my things were gone, my arms and face were punctured with glass fragments.

And there, just barely peeking out from behind a tree, were two pairs of eyes.

I attempted to get away, crawling backwards out of the nest as the creature drew closer. My hand, stained with the blood dripping down my arms, wrapped around a still intact branch to swing it forward and create a barrier between me and this monster.

“Stay back!” I shrieked while swinging my arm wildly, managing to hit the creature a few times on the head.

The beast reacted to the blows, though not in the way I expected. I was expecting an outburst, anger, to be attacked. But it didn’t attack. Instead, the creature took two steps back then lowered its head to the ground like a trained dog. The bottom pair of eyes, with Iris’s covering most of the sclera, darted between my face and the branch. The top pair, small and beady like humans, closed slowly. It was like the creature was trying to appear gentle; docile.

And forgive me for my idiocy; but I hesitated.

There was something about this submissive act, something about the way it just so easily *gave up,* that I couldn't stop thinking about. 

I lowered the branch and laid it carefully along my lap before raising my hands. I turned them side to side, showing that I no longer had a weapon. The creature blinked, gave a soft snort, then stood. One paw stepped forward in a testing motion, body freezing as if waiting for my permission to come closer. I nodded.

It came at me with more confidence, head lowered in a show of kindness. My shoulders trembled as its wet snout pressed briefly to the side of my neck before it pulled back to meet my gaze. Its jaw worked to open slowly, muscles pulling with sickening crackles and wet pops. I gagged as a long barbed tongue lolled out of its mouth, smelling of rotted flesh and chemicals. It took everything in me not to vomit as the appendage moved slowly to meet the flesh of my arm. The creature's tongue worked along bloodied skin, knocking out glass pieces with as gentle care as it could manage. Once one arm was done, it moved to work on the other. When both arms were done, it looked at me. I could see its eyes dart to the glass embedded in my cheeks. A brief whimper escaped me. I nodded.

Saliva smeared across my face as glass fragments were knocked out of skin and blood was licked clean. The creature knocked its head against mine once the work was done and I was declared healed, though it was quick to focus on my leg when it moved and I cried out in pain. It sniffed at the limb, snout pressing against fabric as low growls rumbled from deep within its chest. It huffed, turned, and fled.

At first I hadn’t even realized it was gone. I was so focused on wiping myself clean of its mouth fluids that I didn’t know it had disappeared until I finally looked up and realized I was alone.

“Hello?” I frowned, eyes scanning the trees.

Maybe it had lost interest in me and decided to find something better to do. Whatever reason it was, it gave me the perfect chance to escape. If I found the road again, I could follow it all the way back to town and warn everyone about what was out there in the forest.

My hands pressed against the grass beneath me, arms wobbling as I tried to force myself up. My shoes dug into the dirt for better balance and I managed to stand upright and take one wobbly step forward before falling to my knees.

“No! Get up you useless piece of shit!”

I tried again, stepped forward once, then fell. Curses fell from my mouth as I tried again and again, falling each time. My vision blurred with tears as I launched myself forward, arms reaching to grab onto *anything.* I fell.

And landed on the monster.

The beast gave a curious grunt as I landed on top of it, snout pressing into my stomach as my arms fell limp to dangle on either side of its head. I felt it move from beneath me, walking us back to the nest where it lowered so I could slide slowly back into the space. I lay limp now, staring silently at the creature hovering above me with twigs hanging from its jaw. The same twigs that were then dumped unceremoniously onto my chest before it sat back with light coos falling from hanging mouth. My hand moved to brush against one of the twigs and its tail noticeably began to wag in a fast pace. My hand moved away, and it stilled. Sitting up, I let the pile fall into my lap as eyes drifted to the abomination to my right.

“What is this?”

Its ears perked.

“Are you trying to bury me or something?”

A huff. Its snout nudged in the direction of my injured leg. I looked down at it, then the twigs, then the beast.

“This is for… my leg?”

It threw its head back for a cheerful howl, front paws pounding against the dirt beneath it. I let out an almost amused snort and brushed the twigs from off my lap. Of course it was. Why wouldn’t this demonic creature know how to make a makeshift cast?

It was watching me now so I made light work of straightening out my leg and checking the damages. It didn’t look broken, it was probably just a really bad sprain. Either way, I grabbed a few of the twigs and pressed them to each side of my leg. I held them for exactly ten seconds before letting out a sigh.

“I need something to secure them.”

The creature let out a soft growl of frustration, eyes scanning the nest as it began to walk around with its nose nudging against leaves and clothing. Soon, it bit down on a still intact lab coat and drug it over to lay it carefully over my leg.

“Thanks.” I mumbled while pulling it off and underneath my leg. “Press on these.” 

I tapped the twigs. It leaned in and pressed them into place with its snout. I held the other side with one hand as the other pulled one side of the coat over my leg then pulled up the other. Once I had a good grip, I shooed the creature away and began tying the coat with as tight of a knot as I could manage. Just as I was giving it one last tug, a card fell from one of the pockets. Curious, I picked it up and turned it over. It looked like some kind of keycard all the scientists used to wear. It had their name, age, and was used to access any part of the labs that weren’t restricted. My thumb brushed over the blood on the front to reveal the name beneath it.

Walter. This was my *fathers* card.

I gasped and the card fell from now trembling hands. Sensing the shift in the air, the creature moved in to peek at the card now laying in the dirt. Its ears shot upward, eyes glancing once in my direction before it grabbed it with sharp teeth.

I lunged.

The beast let out a whimper as I jumped onto it, body spinning in circles to shake me off like an annoying bug. But I persisted, hand grabbing at the other side of the card and pulling as hard as I could manage while my other arm remained looped around its neck. My feet dragged along the floor, heels digging in to try and form some kind of anchor.

“Give it back you bastard! I’ll kill you! What did you do to my father?!”

It stilled, mouth opening to drop the card. My arm loosened around its neck and I fell to the ground with a grunt before forcing myself up on shaky legs.

“Fuck you.” I growled while pointing a finger at it. It whimpered and sat back.

With an angry huff, I turned and began limping my way out of the small clearing and hopefully in the direction of the road. And if it wasn’t the road? That’s fine. There had to be an end to this forest at some point.

“Fa…”

I froze. Turned. It was sitting there, exactly where I had left it. Its mouth hung open and I could see its tongue working to form words.

“Fa-ath.”

I dropped to my knees in shock, nodding along as it tried to let out one single word.

“Fath…her–”

A noise left me, something between a gasp and a cry. Hands moved to fist into hair as I nodded rapidly towards it.

“Y-yes. My father– What happened to my father?”

It shifted, huffed, and tried again.

“Art…tie.”

My mind blanked. Artie. That’s what my father used to call me. 

The creature stood now, bones giving soft pops as it strode forward. Once close, it leaned in and pressed its snout to my forehead.

“Artiiiie…”

I started to cry now, hands falling from hair to tremble in the air on either side of the monster's face. Its head lolled, dipping into my hand and rubbing matted fur against soft palm. My breath hitched with a sob.

*“Dad?*”

The beast froze for only a second, chest rumbling with an almost sad growl. Then it shifted, tongue moving to lick gently up the side of my face in slow motions, catching my tears. I could only sit there and cry, hands brushing against the matted fur of the monster that had once been my parent.

“Oh dad… what did you do?”

A whimper escaped my father as he pulled back with his head hanging in shame. The message was clear. He did this to himself. Maybe an experiment went wrong or, perhaps he even *wanted* to do this to himself. Looking at the sadness in those mutated eyes, I don’t think it was the second option.

“Dad?” I reached out, petting a hand against the fur on the top of his head. “What happened to everyone?”

Another whimper. He pulled back, turned, and howled. Off in the distance just beyond the forest, another one echoed out. My breath caught as it rang out for a few seconds longer before the world fell silent around us. My father peeked at me and gave a short huff. I frowned. Everyone was still out there, possibly turned into more of these creatures. Those experiments they were doing… the way my father smelt whenever he’d return home. It was ungodly acts they committed in that building, but no one deserved a fate like this.

I stood, wobbling slightly on my right leg, then reached out to press my hands to the fur on my fathers back.
