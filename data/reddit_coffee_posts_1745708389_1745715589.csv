1k8rx17,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1k8rx17/mflighthouse_beach/,[MF]Lighthouse beach,"Vinny! Open the damn door!” Joe’s voice boomed, muffled but unmistakable. “You
better not be in there jerkin’ off to The View!”
Dragging myself off the couch, I shuffled to the door and swung it open. Joe stood there,
jittery, holding two coffees and a greasy paper bag. His shirt was half unbuttoned, and his pupilswere practically glowing. He was coked up, no question.
“What now?” I said flatly, leaning against the doorframe.
Joe grinned, shoving a coffee into my hand. “What now? You’ve been sittin’ in here like
a freakin’ hermit. Get dressed. We’re takin’ a ride.”
I squinted at him. “This gonna suck, or should I just assume?”
He laughed, a little too loud, and then leaned in with his shit-eating grin. “Kid, if I was
your age and had your tostestorone levels——I’d be doin’ cartwheels and blowin’ loads off like one of those Catherine wheels on the Fourth of July.”
“Thanks for that image, Joe.”
He clapped me on the shoulder, jolting me. “Now move your ass, Dracula.”
I glanced back at Chris, still out cold. “What about him?”
Joe peeked past me, raising an eyebrow. “Leave Sleeping Beauty. He’ll thank us later.”


The Blazer rattled down Ocean Parkway. Joe was at the wheel, jittery as ever, bouncing
his knee and drumming on the steering wheel to a rhythm only he could hear. I leaned back in
the passenger seat, chain-smoking out the cracked window.
“You know Sinatra used to summer out here, right?” Joe said, veering off-topic like he
always did. “Class act. Always had a tan, never wore shorts. A real man.”
I laughed, exhaling smoke. “What is this obsession with Sinatra?”
Joe shot me a dead-serious look, like I’d insulted his religion. “You think I’d waste my
time on someone who didn’t know things? He was connected. He knew about the fuckin’
aliens.”
“Oh God, here we go again.”
“I’m not jokin’, kid,” Joe said, lowering his voice like he was about to spill classified
intel. “You ever wonder where drones came from? GPS? Freakin’ Bluetooth? They didn’t just
pop outta nowhere.”
“And let me guess. Aliens?”
“You’re goddamn right! ’47, UFO crashes in Roswell. They lock it up, start reverse-
engineerin’ the tech, and now we got iPhones. And don’t even get me started on Bethpage.
Grumman’s got teleporters, guaranteed.”
“You sound like one of those guys on Ancient Aliens. What’s next, Elvis is alive and
drivin’ a cab in Queens?”
“You laugh now, but you’ll see one day.”

Joe parked the Blazer near Field Five at Robert Moses. The sun was blazing, the kind of
heat that made the air ripple above the pavement. The waves crashed, but it was drowned out by
Joe’s grumbling as he hauled himself out of the car, slinging a beat-up beach bag over his
shoulder.
“C’mon, Vinny, move your ass,” Joe hollered, glancing back at me as I climbed out of
the passenger side.
“What the hell are we even doing here, Joe?” I asked
“Field five, baby. Closest lot to the lighthouse. Best spot on the whole damn island.” Joe
started trudging toward the dunes, his voice carrying over his shoulder. “Y’know, this place used
to be different. Back in the day, you didn’t have all these rules. No permits, no lifeguards
blowing whistles every five seconds. You could drink a six-pack right on the beach and no one
gave a shit.”
I snorted, following him reluctantly. “Yeah, sounds like paradise. Meanwhile, you’re out
here acting like we’re storming Normandy.”
Joe stopped and turned, pointing a finger at me. “Listen, kid. If I was your age and had
your—tostestorone”
“Joe, I think you mean testosterone.”
“Yeah, yeah, whatever. Point is, you’re wasting your prime, kid.”
“If wasting my prime means not following you around with that bag of bullshit, I’ll take
my chances.”

“Ah, screw you,” Joe said, laughing as he adjusted the strap of the bag. “You’re lucky
you got me around to show you how it’s done.” The sand crunched beneath our feet as we
crossed the dunes, the lighthouse looming in the distance. Joe glanced around like he was casing
the joint, his free hand gesturing broadly. “See, this place used to be alive, bonfires, beers, a little
action on the side. Now it’s all signs and rules and people staring at their phones.”
I sneered. “Yeah, because nothing screams ‘good time’ like Joe DiPalma reminiscing
about his glory days.”
Joe stopped in his tracks and turned to face me. “You’re a real smartass, you know that?”
I laughed, “You keep saying that like it’s news.”
“One day, you’re gonna look back and wish you listened to me.”
“Sure, Joe. Right after I get that house on the water.” I said, sarcastically.
We walked for what felt like forever, Joe leading the way like he was on some sacred
pilgrimage. The beach was packed—kids playing, couples sunbathing, teenagers blasting music
from Bluetooth speakers. The kind of chaos that made you feel like you were in the middle of
Times Square, not the supposed peace of the shore. Joe suddenly stopped dead in the middle of it
all, right where the crowds were thickest. I almost ran into him. He dropped the beach bag onto
the sand with a thud and pulled out a towel, draping it over his head like some kind of makeshift
monk.
“What the fuck are you doing?”
He turned to me, still under the towel, and threw another one over my head.
“Seriously, what the fuck, man?” I snarled, peeking out at the gawking beachgoers.
Pleiadi/In Powder Blue/P a g e | 209
Joe lifted the edge of his towel just enough to look at me, his eyes glinting with that
devilish Joe look that usually meant trouble. He slipped a small bag of coke and a house key into
my hand. That’s when it clicked.
“We’re really doing this? Right here?”
“Relax, Vinny. Nobody’s lookin’ at us. Just fuckin’ do it. Hurry up.”
“Yeah, brilliant,” I said, shifting under the towel.
Joe chuckled, the sound muffled but smug. “Kid, you gotta learn. Life’s all about
misdirection. Make ‘em think you’re a moron, and they’ll never see it comin’ when you’re not.”
I held the key and the bag tight, my heart pounding like a drum. People milled around us,
oblivious—or maybe just too polite to ask why two idiots were sweating under beach towels in
the middle of July.
Joe finally straightened, tossing his towel back into the bag and grinning at me like he’d
just solved the world’s greatest puzzle. “You’re welcome, by the way.”
“For what?” I asked, yanking my towel off and glaring at him.
“For teachin’ you a thing or two about subtlety, now, let’s get outta here before someone
actually starts payin’ attention.”
I don’t know how Joe managed to pull shit like this without getting caught, but one thing
was for sure—he always kept you guessing. Joe and I walked closer to the lighthouse, the heat
baking the boardwalk beneath our feet. Seagulls circled above, cawing like they had something
urgent to say, but Joe had already cornered the market on noise pollution.
“You ever hear about Plum Island?” He started again, scanning the horizon like he could
see it. “They were doin’ all sorts of medical experiments and shit. You ever heard about that
thing that washed up like five years ago, the ‘Montauk Monster?’”

“Unc, I swear, you need a hobby.”
“I’m serious.”
“Sure, Joe. And I bet they’ve got Tupac running quality control.”
Before he could answer, I slowed down, something catching my eye. A middle-aged guy
strutted past us, stark naked, holding a volleyball.
I stopped mid-step.
“Uh… Unc,” I said, pointing. “Are we in the Twilight Zone?”
Joe turned and followed my gaze. His jaw dropped as he took in the scene. Another nude
beachgoer was lounging on a towel, casually reading a paperback like this was the most normal
thing in the world.
“What the… Jesus, Madòn, Mary, and Joseph! Vin, where the fuck did you take me?!”
I grinned, already enjoying his discomfort. “Me? You’re the one who wanted to come
here!”
We’d stumbled into Lighthouse Beach, notorious for its nudist community. And Joe was
not taking it well. He stomped through the sand, gesturing wildly at every naked person he saw,
his face a mix of horror and rage.
“This is why society’s in the goddamned toilet!” he bellowed. “No one’s got any fuckin’
respect anymore. What happened to wearin’ fuckin’ pants?!”
I could barely keep from laughing. “Relax. Maybe they’re testing those cloaking devices,
and you’re just seeing the glitch in the matrix.”
Joe didn’t even crack a smile. He jabbed a finger toward a man jogging past, completely
nude, his bare ass bouncing with every step. “I couldn’t do life in prison. Look at that shit. Man
ass. It’s fuckin’ disgusting.”

I doubled over, laughing so hard I nearly dropped my cigarette.
Joe, undeterred, kept ranting, gesturing at a group of retirees playing frisbee nearby.
“And what’s with the balls?” he said, throwing his hands up in exasperation. “Bouncin’ all over
the place like dodgeballs in gym class!”
“You’re killin’ me, Unc,” I choked out between gasps of laughter.
“Killin’ you? Madón! I’m the one sufferin’ here! This is like Girls Gone Wild: Golden
Girls Edition.”
And then it happened. Joe tripped over someone’s sandcastle, sprawling face-first into the
sand. His hat flew off, landing next to a nudist’s towel.
“You okay there, buddy?” the man asked.
Joe spat out sand, brushing himself off. “Yeah, yeah, I’m fine, Pal. But maybe next time,
build your castle somewhere else, nature boy.”
At this point, I was laughing so hard I couldn’t breathe.
Joe, covered in sand and brimming with indignation, glared at me. “What the hell’s so
goddamned funny? This is a nightmare.”
“You’re the one who wanted to take a walk,” I managed, wiping tears from my eyes.
Joe pointed a finger at me, his tone deadly serious. “Next time, I’ll know better. First, it’s
no clothes at the beach. Next, they’ll be walkin’ into Dunkin’ Donuts buck naked, orderin’ coffee
with their fuckin’ balls on the counter.”
Still laughing, I followed him as we tried to escape the beach, but the universe wasn’t
done with us yet. We passed a group of sunbathing senior citizens, their pale, wrinkled bodies
gleaming in the sunlight like overripe fruit.
“Vin, don’t look! Don’t fuckin’ look! It’s like a crime scene!”

“Too late,” I said, laughing harder. “It’s burned into my retinas.”
Joe garbled something in Italian that I was pretty sure translated to a curse on my soul.
By the time we made it back to the Blazer, he looked like he’d aged ten years. He slammed the
door shut, his face still red with anger and embarrassment.
I lit a joint, still chuckling. “Admit it, Unc. You kinda liked it.”
“You keep talkin’, I’m leavin’ you here with the octogenarian nudists.”
“Maybe I’ll fit in better.”
As he pulled out of the lot, I caught his face twitching upward in a reluctant smile.",1,1745715453.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Although the girl from the coffee date hasn’t asked me for another date, she shows interest through some texts. Through trusted sources I found out the girl I have a crush on, is also very interested in me. I really want to try and make it work between us. We see each other multiple times a week in social situations and I want to ask her out on a date. 

Although the girl from the coffee date is really sweet and the date was fun, I can’t see myself taking it any further, as my mind is on the other girl, that’s just how my mind works. 

So even though the girl from the coffee date hasn’t asked me for another date, I’m pretty certain it is what she wants. Nonetheless, I think it’s better for both to stop the texting here, because I have no intention to pursue anything, because of the other girl. 

So I want to send the girl a text to let her know that. I am just wondering how to. I think it was just the wrong the timing for us. But I am wondering if I should mention that it’s because of my feelings for someone else, to also make clear that it’s not her, as the date went well. Or what I should mention in the text.

But I need somewhere to get this out. I'm going to love you forever, Laurel. And forever grieve you twice.

---

I am grieving twice—
once for your leaving,
and again for the ache
of your tender heart.

The world lost you suddenly,
but you lost it slowly,
day by quiet day
behind a brave face and soft smile.

It feels unfair.
to mourn the weight that broke you,
and the light that you still carried,
even as it flickered.


But what right did I have
asking you to stay
in a world that weighed so heavily
on your aching heart.

Still, I ache for your laughter,
your wild beauty,
the chaos that made everything feel alive.
And I ache for your pain
For the storm you hid
So we could feel the sun.

You touched so many.
You were not a quiet echo—
you were reverberating bass,
a burst of color in a muted world.
You left your fingerprints on souls.

And I know
you’ll always be around us.

In the sound
of ink gliding across paper,
in the rustle of pages and paint on skin.

In the smell
of summer rain or an old hoodie
that still holds warmth.

In the feeling
of soft blankets on tired shoulders,
of deep laughter shared too late at night.

In the taste
of fruit candy,
or strong coffee in chipped ceramic mugs.

In the sight
of skies streaked pink at dusk,
or mismatched socks and messy journals.

You are here.
In all the things we barely notice—
until suddenly,
you are everywhere.

I carry you now
in everything tender,
everything true.
And I will grieve you—
not once,
but forever twice.",1,1745715373.0,SuicideBereavement,0,1.0,False

Any cleaning tips and capsule suggestions, etc.?","Hi everyone! I’m totally new here. I’ve always loved getting lattes and macchiatos at cafes (especially when travelling), but I never got a nespresso machine as I’ve been a pretty broke student since forever.

Anyway, my final semester just came to a close and I noticed someone had a left an old Nespresso Pixie next to our class Tassimo machine. I thought they were gonna replace the Tassimo so I asked if I could buy it (the Tassimo), and my prof said I can just take the “new” machine instead! So, obviously, I did. 

I’ve done some cleaning already. I think it’s from 2018-2019 maybe? It has a matte black top handle and lights for the bin. It hadn’t look like it’d been used in years. It was pretty covered in brown coffee staining, though by sniffing and visual examination I didn’t see mold.

So far, I’ve wiped the outside, cleaned the water reservoir, got a toothbrush with some mild dish soap and scrubbed the inside, and got the official descaler and ran that through (and a ton of water after that until it ran totally clear). Would you guys consider it probably good to use now, or is there something I might be forgetting to check?

I also was just wondering what sorts lot capsules people like to drink for the original line ones! I personally like to add a splash of oat milk to most beverages, and I like americanos. I’d love to hear what suggestions people have, there’s a Nespresso store where I live so I’ll visit soon:)

of course i love it when people order last minute at the window , but i especially love it when they are not apologetic whatsoever because they are convinced the world revolves around them! anyways 

today one guy ordered a grilled mf cheese at the window. so i smile and say “of course , it’ll just take a minute” hoping he would offer to pull back around (since my manager told us we’re never allowed to ask now).. nope! he rolls his window back up . so i tell the person on warming and of course there are a) the other cars in the DT’s food b) the cafe food and c) mobile food in the queue. 

as i wait i hold my breathe for the anger i am about to encounter with every other car waiting. i already come up with my responses and i toughen my skin in preparation. as the time goes by i get more anxious and begin praying to the siren i won’t get cussed at or insulted at least. PLEASE SIREN THIS ISNT MY FAULT. she doesn’t respond, only staring at me as the line of drinks are ready and piling up for the cars behind him. i see pink drinks start to seperate, BSSE’s starting to flatten, and coffees getting cold. i sweat and ask the person on warming again on the grilled cheese, “it’s coming!!!” they say, obviously overwhelmed, so i just wait some more. 

6 mins or so later finally like a beam of light i get the grilled cheese and hand it out. as he drives off i grip the scanner so tight knowing whats coming. i see the next hood of the car , and before karen even stops she exclaims 

“OH MY GOD I HAVENT SEEN YOUR DRIVE THROUGH THIS BAD WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING THIS IS RIDI-“ 

silence. i tune it out. like muffled whispers and start focusing on how she has an eyelash that’s about to stab her eye. 

i turn around : 😔sigh😔i knew it 

i turn back “😃the guy ahead of you ordered food at the window, sorry for the inconvienence😃”

I've had it my whole life due to having AuDHD.

Even when I was malnourished (90 pounds) a couple years back in 2022, a different psychiatrist refused to diagnose me with it. Yay for the GP, I guess!

I’m not malnourished anymore, and I’m weight-restored at 113 pounds at 4’9” tall.

My psychologist recommended a treatment program, which may or may not be covered by insurance. It's frustrating that I'm only getting diagnosed now as an adult, but it's kind of validating and yet also a bit scary in the sense that there's proof I'm not ""faking it"" or having imposter syndrome.

I recently met with my 28F cousin who’s an occupational therapist, and she gave me a book to borrow on interoception. When I’ve had self-reported sensory assessments done before, my hunger/fullness signals are basically “too small” for me to recognize until they become “too big.”

One of my hunger signals is that my hands/feet get cold, and I’m still working on learning what appropriate fullness feels like.

My issue right now is that my stress level is high because my parents are going through a divorce, and my boyfriend is currently out of the country, and all of this is tanking my appetite. My body is already fasting-adapted, so I can go a long time without eating, but recently, I’ve had a hard time even eating one proper meal per day at dinner time.

My cousin and BF have both recommended eating more frequently if I can tolerate it, but nothing sounds interesting, especially since I’ve figured out that my scalp eczema is carb-sensitive. I can have some carbs, but not a lot, so I try to build things around fat. Think of it like Paleo/Primal eating. That’s lead to me drinking coffee and cream until dinner, because it was easy, which isn’t exactly “healthy.”

I can’t have vegetable oils, either, because that messes things up for me and I get really foul-smelling body odor. Same thing with most nuts and seeds.

When I told my psychologist that it feels like the ARFID tells me to “eff off” from eating food, she told me to say it back as a way to not let it control me, that my body needs me to eat, even if I don’t want to.

My cousin had a smart idea of creating a safe-meal menu of about five choices each for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks, so that way, all I need to do is pick something without having to think too much about the calories and nutrition. The issue is, I haven’t eaten three meals per day since high school, and I’m eating small portions because my mental appetite isn’t there.

I’m looking for some easy, quick meal ideas if anyone can help jumpstart me. Looking at long lists is overwhelming right now.

I did put together a list of foods that I like/dislike, so I’m looking to build from there. I do drink Owyn shakes, but my cousin says to not try to drink liquid calories in favor of solid-food calories, because that may restrict my intake further.

Like foods list
- Greek yogurt (plain)
- Oatmeal
- Eggs
- Snack cheese
- Cream cheese
- Heavy cream
- Dates (introduced by BF, new safe food)
- Bananas
- Apples
- Strawberries
- Raspberries
- Mandarins
- Ground beef
- Steak
- Lamb
- Beef bacon
- Greek salad
- Broccoli/cauliflower
- White potatoes
- Sweet potatoes

“Sometimes” tolerable foods (but don’t necessarily like)

- Raw avocado (but guacamole is fine, for some reason)
- Watermelon

Dislike foods
- Peanut butter
- Melons (honeydew, cantaloupe)
- Carrots
- Blackberries (I can’t stand the core)

Was a huge reader until the fire nation blessed me with sudden ADD or HD or 8k or whatever. Still have the Dune sequels to read. Big warhammer 40k novel enjoyer too.

Hmm how I would describe myself? Black hair. Beard. Brown eyes. Dad not. Hairy. I've been told I had nice eye lashes.

Pink Floyd is my favorite band. I mainly listen to rock and metal. But I do on occasion listen to the Macarena and Barbie girl as I shower or cook. Zeppelin, the doors and a myriad of other classic bands are always playing.

I like coffee too. Preferably caramel. Also a redbull fan. I can drink many of those. Probably shouldn't since I don't think that's medically sound.

Pretty much looking for some fun and maybe make a friend in the process. I like to think I'm a decent conversationalist but who knows. Not sure if this is enticing so far.

# Best Dark Wood Used For Cups 2025: Review & Guide

Dark wood cups have become increasingly popular among those seeking a blend of rustic charm and modern functionality. Beyond their aesthetic appeal, the choice of dark wood affects durability, heat resistance, and overall drinking experience. This guide reviews some of the best dark woods used for crafting cups in 2025, providing detailed insights to help buyers make informed decisions.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The selection of dark wood dramatically impacts the cup's qualities. It influences the cup's insulation, resistance to wear and tear, and the potential for imparting flavors into the beverage. Below is an analysis of essential features to consider when evaluating dark wood cups.

**Wood Density:** Higher density woods generally offer greater durability and better insulation.

The density of the wood plays a crucial role in determining the cup's ability to retain heat and withstand daily use. Denser woods, such as ebony or certain types of ironwood, are less prone to cracking or warping, offering a longer lifespan. Conversely, less dense woods may be lighter but also more susceptible to damage. The wood's density is typically measured in kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m鲁), and higher values indicate greater density.

**Natural Oils and Resins:** Presence and type of natural oils determine water resistance and flavor influence.

Natural oils and resins inherent in the wood significantly influence its water resistance and potential impact on the beverage's flavor. Woods rich in natural oils, like teak or rosewood, are naturally water-repellent, reducing the risk of water absorption and subsequent damage. Furthermore, the specific type of oil can subtly influence the taste of the liquid it holds; some woods may impart a delicate, woody aroma, while others are virtually flavor-neutral. Identifying the natural oil and resin composition helps buyers determine suitability for various types of beverages.

**Grain Pattern:** The visual appeal and structural integrity are impacted by the wood's grain pattern.

The grain pattern of the wood significantly contributes to the cup's aesthetic appeal and structural integrity. Straight-grained woods tend to be more stable and less likely to warp, while figured grains, such as burl or tiger stripe, offer unique visual characteristics. The grain pattern also influences how the wood responds to carving and shaping, affecting the final product's overall design and durability. Careful consideration of the grain pattern is essential for both functional and aesthetic reasons.

**Sustainability and Sourcing:** Ethical and ecological considerations regarding the wood's origin.

Consumers are increasingly concerned about the sustainability and ethical sourcing of the materials used in their products. Dark woods like ebony and wenge are often sourced from regions with questionable forestry practices, leading to deforestation and habitat loss. Therefore, it's crucial to prioritize cups made from sustainably harvested woods, certified by organizations like the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). Responsible sourcing ensures minimal environmental impact and supports fair labor practices.

**Finishing and Sealing:** The type of sealant used to protect the wood and ensure food safety.

The finishing and sealing process is critical for protecting the wood from moisture damage and ensuring food safety. Food-grade sealants, such as beeswax or natural oils, create a barrier that prevents liquids from penetrating the wood while remaining non-toxic. Some sealants may contain harmful chemicals, so it's essential to verify the safety and composition of the finish before purchasing. A properly sealed cup will be more durable and easier to clean, extending its lifespan.

 ## Core Benefits

Dark wood cups offer a distinct set of benefits that set them apart from ceramic, glass, or metal alternatives. These advantages stem from the natural properties of the wood itself, providing both practical and aesthetic value.

**Aesthetic Appeal:** Dark wood cups provide a unique, rustic, and sophisticated visual appeal.

The rich, dark tones and intricate grain patterns of woods like walnut or mahogany offer an unparalleled aesthetic appeal. These cups add a touch of elegance and natural beauty to any setting, whether it's a formal dining room or a cozy outdoor gathering. The handcrafted nature of many dark wood cups further enhances their unique charm, making them a stylish addition to any drinkware collection.

**Natural Insulation:** The wood's inherent properties provide natural insulation, keeping beverages warm or cold for longer.

Wood possesses natural insulation properties, which help maintain the temperature of the beverage within the cup. This means hot drinks stay warmer for longer, while cold drinks retain their coolness, reducing the need for frequent refills. This natural insulation makes dark wood cups ideal for enjoying both hot coffee on a chilly morning and refreshing iced tea on a warm afternoon.

**Unique Tactile Experience:** The smooth, natural texture of the wood provides a pleasant tactile experience.

The smooth, natural texture of polished dark wood offers a unique and pleasing tactile experience. Holding a dark wood cup feels different from holding a ceramic or glass cup, providing a connection to nature and a sense of warmth. This tactile quality enhances the overall drinking experience, making it more enjoyable and comforting.

**Durability:** When properly cared for, dark wood cups can be highly durable and long-lasting.

With proper care and maintenance, dark wood cups can be remarkably durable and long-lasting. High-density woods, in particular, are resistant to cracking, chipping, and other forms of damage. Regular cleaning and occasional oiling can help preserve the wood's integrity and beauty, ensuring that the cup remains a cherished item for years to come.

 ## FAQs Section

Addressing common questions from consumers can help clarify any uncertainties and build confidence in their purchase decision. Here are a few frequently asked questions about dark wood cups.

**Are dark wood cups safe for drinking hot liquids?**

Yes, when properly sealed with a food-grade finish, dark wood cups are safe for drinking hot liquids. The sealant prevents the liquid from coming into direct contact with the wood, eliminating the risk of leaching harmful substances. Ensure the cup is explicitly labeled as food-safe and made with a non-toxic sealant.

**How do I clean and maintain my dark wood cup?**

To clean a dark wood cup, gently wash it by hand with warm water and mild soap. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or placing it in the dishwasher, as this can damage the wood and sealant. After washing, thoroughly dry the cup with a soft cloth. To maintain the wood's natural luster, occasionally apply a food-grade mineral oil or beeswax polish.

**Will the wood impart any flavor to my beverage?**

Depending on the type of wood and the sealant used, there may be a slight flavor imparted to the beverage. Some woods, like cedar or cherry, are known for their distinctive aroma and flavor, which can subtly influence the taste of the drink. However, a high-quality sealant can minimize or eliminate this effect. If you are concerned about flavor transfer, opt for cups made from woods that are known to be relatively neutral in taste, such as walnut.

**Can dark wood cups be used for alcoholic beverages?**

Yes, dark wood cups can be used for alcoholic beverages, provided they are properly sealed and maintained. Alcohol can be harsher on wood than water, so it's especially important to ensure the sealant is alcohol-resistant. After using the cup for alcoholic beverages, rinse it thoroughly with warm water and dry it immediately to prevent staining or damage.

My name is Daniel and I'm from Southern California (the Inland Empire, specifically). I'm just looking for someone to have a genuinely great time with. I'm not a very picky person and I don't really care much for looks. I more so value your personality and how well we vibe, so pretty much anyone is welcome to get to know me! (I mean that in the most non-conceited way possible lol). I would just ask that you be 21 and older.

My interests:

~ I would consider myself the typical nerdy type (gaming, anime, comic books, super hero movies, etc.) If you like share any of those interests then I think we'll get along great lol

~ I'm Black and Cherokee, I'm bilingual (English and Japanese), around 5'11"" but 6 feet tall on a good day.

~ On top of being your typical nerd I am also a huge horror movie fan to the point of considering making my own horror movie. I have a couple ideas and I would love to share them with someone who's interested in hearing them.

~ I listen to any kind of music except country cuz it all sounds the same to me lol. So if that's a deal breaker then I apologize but I just can't get into it. I also used to rap and sing and have been thinking of doing it again. I have made about 9 or 10 songs in total. Let me know if you'd like to hear something I've made.

~ I love coffee and boba so random coffee and boba runs will be a thing. One of my favorite things to is visit a coffee place I've never been to and try out their coffee and see if I'm adding it to my list or favorite spots or if I'm just never going there again.

I volunteered with Easter Seals helping my dad and other volunteers build wheelchair ramps for people in need. Over time, I started volunteering with other  non-profits like Best Buddies, Special Olympics, adaptive  sports events. I became friends with many people  In college, I majored in social work and got a job at a state agency vocational rehab office  for some years. In 2015, I took a job at the student services office at a state college where I also started working on my MSW degree. My job at the college involved assisting disabled student with making sure accommodations  were being made for them and advising them on any needs/issues that came up. 

Due to the nature of my job, I interacted with people worked within different departments at student services. People were supportive of each other and it was very pleasant workplace. I did become friends with several people. One person was Victoria(not her real name). Victoria was younger than me when we started hanging out. I was 30 and she was 25.  I got to know her fiancé now husband Paul (not real name) quite well. Victoria and Paul are an interracial couple (she's black and she's white) and Paul is 20 years older than her and was divorced. She often talked to me about the issues she and Paul faced as an interracial couple with a big age difference.  Paul had a well paying job in finance. They married in spring 2017.

  
In fall 2017, the college we worked at hired a quadriplegic named Chris (not real name) to work in the student services office with me. Chris is a lower level quadriplegic meaning he had use of arms and wrists and was able to drive a modified van.  Chris is married and had at the time he started, he and his wife had a three year old daughter, they had a son two years ago.  Chris's wife Sharon (not real name) would often accompany him to holiday or staff parties. At one party, Victoria told me that she didn't get a why a woman like Sharon would settle to marry a disabled guy because it would be a burden in a relationshp and she doesn't have the patience to deal with a disability. She also said that she could never marry a man with disability because she knew the kind of lifestyle she wanted.  Victoria's views weren't new to me as I had already known others with similar views. I do believe people should be able to choose who they date, marry, cohabitate, etc with even if their views are discriminatory.  

A a few months later, Victoria took a job at another college in a nearby town. We would meet up for lunch or coffee and sometimes she and Paul would have game or movie nights at their house.  I moved out of state in early 2019.  I mostly communicated with Victoria mostly through text and phone calls. She and Paul had been doing IVF since 2018, but nothing was working and she eventually told all friends and family that she and Paul were going to need to use donor sperm.  Everyone was supportive. She underwent insemination in early 2020 before covid hit and gave birth to a son  in the fall. Due to the pandemic, she kept people informed via Facebook and Instagram. I was genuinely happy for her and Paul. The last time I saw Victoria, Paul, and their son was in late 2022. In 2023, she she announced that Paul had colon cancer and he underwent treatments.

Last November, she announced via group chats that Paul's cancer is terminal.  This past Monday, she announced Paul is now on hospice care. She has posted her feelings anger on group chats and Facebook about how she's not getting the life she dreamed of and wanted. I do have sympathy for her because her son is very young. She also recently said that due to financial issues and medical bills, she will likely have to sell her house and move in with relatives down the line. 

 But, there is a part of me that wonders if she sort of cursed herself years ago when she said she wouldn't marry a disabled man because she wouldn't be getting the lifestyle she wanted. Last night, I had a dinner with a friend and I told him about Victoria and Paul and Victoria's ableist views.  This friend's grandfather was a Presbyterian minister and he said the Bible verse ""Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall."" might apply to Victoria.

It's gotten somewhat better as I live and gain more experience to work off of, but it's also incredibly obvious that I'm really clueless––obvious enough my friends notice and tease me for it. I suspect it has everything to do with autism. It's messed up multiple potential relationships for me, and also makes me really confused about people in general. 

To illustrate, I've known a guy since childhood who in hindsight was very obvious about liking me for years. I was so obtuse I didn't pick up on a single signal, and ended up unknowingly shutting down his approaches. Even 2 years after we lost touch due to going to college, he reached out to me again out of the blue, and we started talking, me still being obtuse. Instead of actually communicating and re-building a connection, I proceeded to send him walls of text info dumping my special interest. Needless to say, he stopped responding. I've info dumped on other suitors since, and also subsequently scared them off. It took me awhile to realise that info dumping is a big no in dating. I've learned to not do that anymore, but the damage is done. 

Another time, I met someone who was studying at the same institute as I was. We never actually talked, but every time we were around each other, he'd stare/smile. So, having learned to pick up on signals a bit better, I surmised he was interested in me. Having been told that men don't cold-approach women anymore, I gave him a note asking him to coffee. Turns out he was showing interest despite having a long-distance girlfriend. Like a fool, it hadn't occurred to me that he might not be single because it's unimaginable for me to be able to have romantic interest in someone else while being in a committed relationship. 

Recently, before going abroad, a guy told me he had 'opened his soul' to me, and in response I wished him 'a good life' and to 'not be a stranger' if we ever met again. Which I have since been told was *not* the best response. 

tldr: I'm a fool when it comes to romance and I'm pretty sure it's cause of autism. Anyone else?",2,1745714473.0,AutismInWomen,0,1.0,False

 ## Key Features Analysis

The best decorative glass bowls of 2025 boast a range of features that contribute to their beauty, durability, and functionality. These features often include high-quality materials, unique designs, and versatile applications.

**Material Quality and Composition**

The quality of the glass used is paramount. Premium decorative glass bowls are typically made from lead-free crystal or high-grade borosilicate glass. Lead-free crystal offers exceptional clarity and brilliance, enhancing the visual appeal of the bowl. Borosilicate glass, on the other hand, is known for its durability and resistance to thermal shock, making it suitable for holding both hot and cold items. The manufacturing process often involves skilled artisans who carefully shape and polish the glass to achieve a flawless finish.

**Design and Aesthetic Appeal**

Decorative glass bowls come in a wide spectrum of designs, from classic and minimalist styles to intricate and contemporary patterns. Some bowls feature hand-painted details, etched designs, or embedded elements like gold leaf or colored glass shards. The shape of the bowl also plays a crucial role in its aesthetic appeal, with options ranging from traditional round bowls to more abstract and sculptural forms. Designers often draw inspiration from nature, architecture, and modern art to create unique and eye-catching pieces.

**Size and Capacity**

The size and capacity of a decorative glass bowl are important considerations, depending on its intended use. Smaller bowls are ideal for holding potpourri, candies, or small decorative items, while larger bowls can serve as fruit bowls, salad bowls, or centerpieces. The diameter and depth of the bowl should be carefully considered to ensure it can accommodate the desired contents without looking overcrowded or disproportionate. Some bowls are designed with a wide, shallow profile, while others have a deep, narrow shape.

**Durability and Resistance**

A high-quality decorative glass bowl should be durable and resistant to scratches, chips, and cracks. The thickness of the glass and the manufacturing process contribute to its overall strength. Bowls made from tempered glass are particularly resistant to breakage and can withstand accidental bumps and drops. Additionally, some bowls are coated with a protective layer to prevent scratches and maintain their pristine appearance over time.

**Versatility and Functionality**

While primarily decorative, many glass bowls offer practical functionality. Some are designed to be food-safe and can be used for serving salads, fruits, or desserts. Others are heat-resistant and can be used for displaying candles or potpourri. The versatility of a decorative glass bowl enhances its value and makes it a worthwhile investment for any home. Its ability to seamlessly blend form and function makes it a desirable addition to any living space.

**Base and Stability**

The base of a decorative glass bowl is crucial for its stability and prevents it from tipping over. Some bowls have a flat base that provides a secure foundation, while others have a raised base or pedestal that adds a touch of elegance. The weight of the bowl and the design of the base should be carefully balanced to ensure it remains stable even when filled with contents. Some bowls also feature non-slip pads on the base to prevent them from sliding on smooth surfaces.

Always check the manufacturer's instructions before using a decorative glass bowl for food.

**How do I choose the right size of decorative glass bowl for my space?**

The size of the decorative glass bowl should be proportional to the space where it will be displayed. For small tables or shelves, opt for smaller bowls that won't overwhelm the area. Larger tables or countertops can accommodate larger bowls that make a bold statement. Consider the intended use of the bowl when determining the appropriate size. A fruit bowl, for example, will need to be larger than a bowl used for holding potpourri.

Was working a shift earlier and during my break I had sushi, white chocolate cream egg, and chocolate milk from the coffee machine. An hour or so later my eczema started to be extra itchy and uncomfortable.

I usually have a chocolate milk at break and haven't had a reaction like this from that. I've been cutting chocolate besides this due to histamine levels and whatever bullshit people people are saying and it has had benefit 

From personal experiences and knowledge, what would people reckon could be affecting me? 
I have been drinking alcohol and eating foods that are typically not recommended and my eczema has been improving regardless

I should also add I have hayfever pretty bad and a few months ago I ate a kiwi and my eczema blew up like majin vegeta, and had some other diabolical symptoms. At the time I self diagnosed as me having  pollen food syndrome lmao 111 told me to come to hospital but I ain't waiting with nhs times, took a piritese which I think calmed me down. I have had issues with grass and plants in my skin when I was younger and also things like raw carrot (would swell up my lips besieged other hayfever symptoms. 

Haven't gone to a doctor or dermatologist in years due to no success with doctors who just dished out some bullshit creams that would either irritate my eczema and other skin or just give a short term solution.

And apologies in advance for the wall of text.

Ever since I was young I wanted to go into my current profession and everything I did during my school years was geared towards that. Once I left high school I did a two-year course in my specific field and pretty much a week after I graduated I got in for work experience at one of the top companies in my country and eight years later I still work there. Since then I have worked my way up somewhat and, while I'm not as high as I would like to be, I can see progression in the future that would lead to more money and better hours.

A key thing to know about my job is the hours are difficult and the pay isn't amazing - not awful, when I was single I lived fairly comfortably, but definitely not one of the best paying jobs out there. It often requires me to do little 15-20 minutes stints outside of my defined hours (which my boss is okay with me taking back during my actual shifted hours 95% of the time), I work between three and five evenings a week and weekend shifts can be extremely long. I would say I average somewhere around 45-50 hours a week and have three full days off every two weeks. Occasionally there is a last minute event or issue I have to deal with that crops up but they are rare.

Why I don't mind this is because my job also encompasses a lot of my hobbies and interests. I get to do what I am incredibly passionate about, I get to travel the world for it and the majority of my friends have been made through it. To put it simply, I really do love my job to the extent that I wouldn't class it as work, it's like a passion project.

Three years ago I met my wife and we hit it off pretty quickly - I'm not ashamed to say I fell head over heels for this funny, smart, beautiful girl who had everything together. We were dating within a month of meeting, exclusive a month later and engaged before we'd even had our first anniversary, and we got married at the end of last year. She really is remarkable and I love her so much, more than I ever thought I could love another person, and we have so many of the same goals in life. She is an absolutely wonderful wife, daughter and friend, she is so incredibly thoughtful and kind when it comes to others and I am so blessed to have her by my side.

But, as you know from the title, there is a rather significant problem between us and that is my job. I have never hidden what my job entails from her or tried to pass it off as anything other than what it is, I have been up front and honest.

However, over the years it has put more and more of a strain on us. For instance, when we first met I didn't work as many evenings (when we first started dating it would have been three a week at most rather than three minimum) but that has since changed. I've also had to skip friends' birthdays or gatherings that she wanted me to attend because my schedule didn't line up with them, which she was less than pleased with. She also doesn't grasp the concept of my job not having rigid hours i.e. when the clock strikes 5pm I don't immediately stop what I'm doing and start heading home.

Before I proposed, we sat down and I asked her did she see a future with me given the issues she had with my job and she assured me yes. I tried to press her on it to make sure but she kept brushing me off with comments like, ""We'll make it work."" In hindsight, I should have pushed for a more in-depth conversation.

The breaking point has come recently. Even though she pushed for it as I had a house and she didn't, she hasn't adjusted to moving in with me well (she's moved an hour away from her family home and her friends) and is feeling very lonely where we live. I spend every second of spare time I have with her but apparently it's not enough, and even though I work from home it's not the same as being together when I'm not working because I'm not fully focused on her (which is fair but is it not better than me being away in an office somewhere?). I've tried to encourage her to find things to do in our city on the nights I'm working but she gets angry at me and thinks I'm calling her a loser.

No matter what I do - arranging fancy dates, going for walks, grabbing coffee, doing little things for her - she says I don't love her enough because I don't give her more of my time and that because she's so miserable I should be doing everything I can to make her happy. She hasn't outwardly told me to quit my job and get a different one but I know she'd be delighted if I did. She also keeps saying I would be a terrible father because I would be so absent from our non-existent children's lives.

The problem is as much as I obviously don't want her to be miserable, I really don't want to lose my job either. As much as to her it's just a job, this is a significant part of who I am that I have worked extremely hard to create and a lot of my life is wrapped up in it. Even if it wasn't my job, I'd still want to be heavily involved in parts of what my job entails because it's a personal interest of mine regardless of getting paid. I've tried to find solutions within my job that means I can still do what I love doing and keep her happy but she still doesn't think it's enough.

Something I also keep getting stuck on is that she agreed to marry me knowing exactly what my job was like. It's not like we got married and suddenly my hours doubled or I'm now working every weekend when I didn't previously. Apart from the move from more day shifts to more night shifts, which happened fairly early in our relationship, my job hasn't changed at all.

After our latest blow-up argument about it, she's packed up her stuff and has threatened to divorce me over it and I am a loose end. However, I can't shift the feeling that maybe I should give up my job for her because she is my wife. Any help?

1k8rf3i,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1k8rf3i/a_couple_of_days_ago_i_woke_up_to_the_most/,A couple of days ago I woke up to the most disturbing and relentless noise. It only got worse from there.,"It was a Monday like any other. At least, it should have been. But I woke up in the early hours of the morning, to a grotesque, jarring cacophony that tore through the stillness like a scalpel to flesh.

At first, I couldn’t place it. It sounded like dozens of television sets, each tuned to a different hellish frequency. Jumbled advertisements barked in artificial tones, layered over shrill, soulless pop songs that seemed surgically engineered to be catchy and hollow. News anchors droned in unison, rattling off headlines like a prayer for the damned: earthquakes leveling cities, political alliances fracturing, death tolls rising with clinical detachment.

I glanced at the clock: 4:03 a.m. Work in three hours.

The sound had to be coming from the apartment above me. I was sure of it. The guy upstairs—an aging ex-musician, half-deaf from decades of abusing his eardrums—had a reputation for blasting music loud enough to rattle the drywall. But never this early. Never on a weekday.

I sighed and turned toward the cold half of the bed. Still dented from the memory of my wife. She’d always been the one to handle these kinds of things, these little human conflicts. She had a way of grounding chaos with a word, a touch. Without her, I was drifting. Lost. Frayed around the edges.

But I needed sleep. I *needed* silence.

Reluctantly, I got dressed, ascended the decrepit and dirty old hallway stairs, and knocked. The door opened after a pause that felt far too long. There he stood—bare-chested, hair tousled, eyes sunken and unfocused, like he’d just crawled out of his bed.

“Could you turn that *noise* off?” I shouted, barely audible over the torrent of blaring infomercials, shrieking news, and AI-generated voices vomiting nonsense into the void. “It sounds like you’ve got *three televisions* on!”

His eyes struggled to focus. He frowned, muttering something unintelligible. Then, his face twisted in sudden fury, like his mind had just caught up with his body.

“I’m not making any goddamn noise,” he snarled. “I was asleep. You just woke me up you stu$${{{$ (#)#%)!” I didn’t catch the last part, as the noise level rose and drowned it out.

And with that, he slammed the door. Hard. Almost violently.

I stood there for a long time, staring at the peeling paint on his door, heart beating like it wanted out of my chest. If it wasn’t him... then where the hell was that noise coming from?

The only other resident in the building was the elderly woman downstairs—and I knew for a fact it wasn’t her. She was half-senile and barely moved from her recliner.

I stumbled back into my apartment, the noise clawing at my brain like rusted nails. I thought maybe—*maybe*—one of my smart devices had activated. A glitch? An update? Something?

I powered everything down. My smartpad, smart-top, smart-fridge, even my smart-lamp. One by one. Nothing worked. The noise didn’t stop. It only seemed to grow more vivid, more layered. Like it was evolving. **Rising in intensity.**

My pulse raced. I panicked. I ran—out the door, down the hall, down the stairs, barefoot, barely dressed. I didn’t even lock the door. I just ran. Into the streets, into the cold black of morning. But the noisy sounds followed me, weaving through the cityscape, hissing through alleyways and over rooftops like a parasite in the wind.

‘’Did you know that for only 9.99 you can subscribe to a world of… If your love life has faded, try SmartMatch, you’ll be expertly matched by our A.I with over… Earthquakes in Manhattan… Chinese officials refuse to comment… Paris Hilton set to make a comeback with her…’’

Voices talking over each other, mindless drivel, disasters, loud music. It drowned out my thoughts.

I eventually collapsed onto a park bench far from traffic, trees silhouetted against a bleeding morning sky. I covered my ears. Rocked back and forth. But it didn’t help. The noise wasn’t external. It wasn’t *broadcast*. It was *nested* inside me—rooted deep like a virus in my brainstem.

I rushed back home, adrenaline giving way to dread. I had to know what was happening to me. I had to know *why*.

I pulled up Smartle and typed:  
**“Sudden noise in ears.”**  
Tinnitus. Of course. But this wasn’t a ringing. This was a *chorus of madness*.  
I searched:  
**“Hearing radio or television broadcasts in my ears.”**  
Musical ear syndrome. Hallucinations. Elderly patients. None of it fit. This wasn’t a *hallucination*. It was *too real*. The cadence of the voices. The clarity of the news reports, all of which were genuine events I knew to be happening. The inflections. The commercial jingles. It was like I had become a walking antenna for all the fucked-up things currently happening in the world.

I scrolled helplessly through the never-ending river of information on Smartle, as the volume surged once more.

‘’Want to lose weight? Get the smartfridge! It will calculate the right diet for you, and automatically lock itself if you attem… It’s Monday and it’s noon! You know what that means! Moonday madness! Make sure yo… Live with the latest news! You won’t believe this story! The president of the United States… It’s never been easier to find friends! Sign up for a free trial of Friendster and get… We’re following the race closely! The ball is in the Center Party’s court, but will they score? Congressman Billingsby has the bill, but will it pass? It looks like he’s… Tired of being alone? Get your own android companion! So real you can’t tell the dif… Scientists have constructed a unicorn! The creature once mythical is no longer as mythical! Hear more details about the multi-billion-dollar project which… Billions of people are starving… Coming to you live from the studio! 24/7 music FM presents the pop sensation of the week…’’

The noise didn’t stop. Voices talking over each other, mind-numbingly mundane pop songs blaring over it. Not even as night fell did I get any rest from the constant noise. I beat my head against the wall until the darkness finally took me.

I don’t know how long I drifted—minutes? Hours? Each time I woke, the noise was there, waiting. At times, the volume would recede. Just slightly. Like it was catching its breath. Like it was retreating, lurking at the edges of my sanity. Then out of nowhere, it would jump at me full force.

Eventually, I lay curled up in bed, one hand resting softly on the cold, empty side where my wife used to sleep. Tracing the fabric, the indentation. I could almost feel her warmth.

I tried to drive away the noise, to anchor myself to that place I used to share with her. Outside of this crumbling world. Outside of time and space. She had been my rock. A steady, static, never-changing anchor for me to hold on to. Someone I could always count on. A place of calm, quiet, and warmth amid the world’s increasing chaos. She was my purpose. I had felt that way ever since I met her. So why am I suddenly unable to remember what I loved about her so much? Why did it seem like the memory of her was locked away behind all this sudden fanfare of nonsense?

We’re not meant to be alone. We’re not wired for it. It’s unnatural. Our purpose is to find someone and stick with them. Through pain and hardship, through happiness, through every little thing in between, through all the noise distracting us.

I tried—God, I *tried*—to focus through the violent torrent of gibberish flooding my mind, each syllable a nail hammered into my skull. I fought to claw my way back to that fragile island of silence, of memory. That one place untouched.

I saw her.

She was standing at the gates of Bradford University, sunlight drenching her golden hair in fire. Her smile—timid, uncertain, beautiful—felt like the only real thing left in the universe. July. It must’ve been 2044. Or was it 2045? My thoughts stuttered like a corrupted file. I was lost back then, just a stammering freshman flung into a world too big for me. And then she appeared, offered her help—and I remembered the exact words she said:

‘’Time is the most precious thing we have! Timesaver will help you manage your time when things get busy! You can schedule, reschedule! Timesaver will even help you determine and prioritize what is worth spending your time on, so you don’t have to! Only 16,99…’’

I screamed and slammed my forehead into the wall. Again and again. Desperately trying to drive the noise out through blunt force trauma. But it only retreated slightly. I mustered up all my strength, trying to focus once more. On her.

Yes—it was 2045. I was sure of it now. That’s when I met my wife. 28 years ago.

We were inseparable. The same courses, same coffee spots, same dreams of exploring the world… Before the world became... What it became. What did I love so much about her? Was it the fact that she loved the same things I did? The same music? The same movies. We talked for hours, until dawn's light, and we’d still have a million more things to talk about. The octopus is an extremely intelligent creature, with the capability of complex emotions. If they could talk, they could teach us all great lessons about life, death, and everything in between. I remember that conversation. One of thousands. Did we always agree? Did I love everything about her? No, there has to be little points of difference. Little imperfections. Otherwise, it’s not perfect.

I remember one of those points of difference. Whenever our discussions landed on A.I and humanity, she always seemed so conflicted. My stance was clear. I hated the idea of a society run by AI. I saw how people were increasingly seeking out companions in lines of code, rather than flesh and blood. I saw how algorithms guided people’s lives from their choice of music, to movies, to relationships, to, eventually, points of view. It was taking over their lives and wrestling away their control of everything that made them who they were, until they themselves were just predictable lines of code following a path they never really chose.

She would get this unmistakable look of sadness in her eyes every time I mentioned my concerns. She’d argue her point well, even if it never convinced me fully. ‘’If lonely people can find some kind of joy in A.I and their company, why not? If they have no one else around to talk to, why not? You talk about A.I as this destructive presence, but isn’t it really all about how we use them? No one forces people to follow algorithms that choose for them. They do it because it’s easy and convenient. You can challenge the algorithm, you can force yourself to look for things that inspire you, things that challenge your views. We can choose how to use the A.I, so that it doesn’t use us. Maybe we can even learn from them instead of the other way around.’’

I never agreed, not fully at least, I never wavered from my conviction that [A.Is](http://A.Is) were a dangerous introduction to humanity. Even if she was right, even if we were in control as to how to use them, I didn’t trust humankind with this responsibility.

It was the one thing we disagreed on, the perfect imperfection. Our relationship really was perfect. Until she became sick. If she were here, I would have hated saying I told you so… I wonder how she would think of the world now if she saw it.

Just then, I felt the noise tingling at the back of my mind. It slowly started rising in intensity again, like it was clawing its way back. Then, there was an explosion in my mind.

I shook my head violently. My thoughts glitched like a corrupted feed. Algorithms from hell scrambled my brain. The noise was back in full volume. I rose in a panic, pacing the living room in ragged, shuddering loops. Was it even my living room? The photos on the walls said it was. My face stared back at me in frozen smiles from the picture frames. Beside me—her. My wife… My wife… Yes I remember, she died… Of cancer… Why do we have unicorns but still no cure for cancer? It doesn’t matter… Nothing would ever bring her back, but her memory... I still had the memory of her inside my mind. Was someone… Or something… Trying to take that away from me?

I found that one picture of her that stood out more clearly in my mind than any of the others. My eyes were fixed on her expression staring back at me, on that day, that perfect summer day at the lake. The picture was taken a week before she died. I saw it so clearly. We had gone there, fully knowing she would never return. I danced with her under the moonlight. I could see it so clearly. How we lay in the bed under the skylight window. How we said goodbye. How I traced the features of her face, trying to imprint it on my mind's hard drive, save it there forever. I mapped her face, every road, nook, and cranny. All of them had been a mystery waiting to be explored. I told her I wasn’t sure what sense the world would make without her, what my purpose would be. She had told me to set myself free. That was her last wish. Whatever that meant.

Suddenly, I was violently ripped out of my memories. The noise was back.

Then came the worms. Slithering and writhing at the edges of my vision. Threads of distortion, slimy, electric, and monstrous. Then static—full-spectrum, full-assault, black-and-white *oblivion*. Like a dead signal on those ancient televisions that fascinated Christa so much. Christa! That was her name! If I could just hold on to…

Then came the flashes of images before my eyes.

My vision was hijacked.

Refugee camps swallowed in dust and disease. Fires sweeping through cities, leaving nothing but ashes behind. Floods swallowing villages whole. A man hanged like a warning sign in front of the Washington Monument. Confusion, disbelief, cruelty, and disaster upon disaster.

I shut my eyes. But darkness gave no peace. It projected everything deeper, *closer, a forced projection on my inner screen*.

I stumbled through my home—half-blind, half-deaf. Every step felt unfamiliar. I could no longer trust what I saw, it was out of my control. Couldn’t filter what I heard; it was out of my control. The data stream ran through me now, unfiltered, uninvited.

Only pain felt real. Stubbing my toe. Slamming my knee. I *welcomed* it—proof I still existed somewhere under the noise and flashing images of horror and human decay.

Sometimes, mercifully, reality flickered back. The apartment would reappear like an old photograph. I'd rush from room to room, clutching onto objects like they were life preservers in a rising flood, trying to remember who I was. What I *had* been. Christa and I, hiking through Yosemite, the sun descending behind the mountains. But how could she have been hiking? She was sick? Wasn’t she sick then? When did she get sick?

The noise returned, stronger. Always stronger. Louder. The images flickered through my inner screen again. Gloom and death, decay, the dying breath of the human spirit.

Why *these* images? Why *these* voices?

I didn’t start any wars. I didn’t make people starve. I don’t elect politicians. I don’t even vote. I don’t pollute more than the next person. All my life, I have always done the right thing. I did what I was meant to do. I found someone I loved and settled down. It was them… They did this to themselves… They… Who are they? Who am I?

I was a child starving in a collapsed Ethiopia.  
I was a mother clutching her baby as the floods rose.  
I was an orangutan watching its forest burned to ash.

I was everything and nothing. Simultaneously. All of it. None of it.  
A ghost trapped in overlapping frequencies and never-ending noise.

And through it all... her absence screamed louder than any of it.

Christa. *Christa*. My calibration point. My stillness.

I have to keep remembering her.

It has to make sense. I *need* it to make sense. Whatever this is, it’s trying to steal my memories and replace them with dread and terror. I can’t let it.

I can claw my way out. I can rearrange the noise into a pattern, break down these intruding images, and conjure her up from the pixels. I can find her again. *I will.*

I would trade every screaming desperate voice, every headline, every starving child, every polluted breath, every lonely soul, every goddamn unicorn, every single nation, every single thing that ever existed… For her.

Let the sky collapse. Let nations fall. Let humanity rot, let it succumb to the infection spreading in its pus-filled self-inflicted wounds. I don’t care.

I would let it all burn if I could just see her smile one more time.

And I would not feel sorry.  
**Do you hear me?**  
**I. WOULD. NOT. FEEL. SORRY.**  
**EVER!**

I strained with my battered, treacherous ears to catch a response, clinging to any hint of sound as the chaotic noise rose and fell in nauseating waves. My untrustworthy eyes darted through the madness, trying to pierce the flashing nightmare of images—a stuttering diorama of horror, each frame more grotesque than the last, flickering and vanishing like a cruel, broken film reel.

No answer came. No voice reached through the static to find me. Whatever cruelty befell me, it seemed to revel in the chaos of my torment and confusion.

Instead, a sick, slithering sensation unfurled inside me, as if a thousand tiny serpents had found their way into my veins, writhing and knotting themselves around my bones. The cold, solid reassurance of my living room floor beneath me began to dissolve. First it burned against my skin—an unbearable, blistering heat—then turned slick and wet, then gritty like broken glass, then something unspeakably soft, something alive. Every possible sensation came and went, each one worse than the last, until finally... there was nothing.

I could feel nothing at all.

The familiar, musty smell of my apartment, the safe, stale scent of old books and worn furniture, evaporated—replaced by the sharp, metallic stink of blood and iron. The taste of rust thickened in the back of my throat. My thoughts, too, became foreign, submerged beneath the deafening roar that blotted out reason, swallowed by a carousel of suffering flashing in my mind's eye. My world was collapsing, one sense at a time, peeling away like skin.

And then I understood.

I was dying. That had to be it.. This was death—not swift, not merciful, but a slow, brutal unmaking of everything that I was.

Yet somehow my mind, stubborn and desperate, refused to let go. It clung to shreds of memory, scraps of who I had been. Somewhere in that swirling abyss of terror and noise, a thread of coherent thought wound itself through the chaos.

I loved my wife. Christa.

Christa had a sister. Sarah.

We hadn't spoken in so long—grief had torn us apart after Christa died, ripped the fragile stitches of family wide open. Maybe I reminded Sarah too much of what she had lost. Maybe it hurt her too much to see me.

But... but maybe she could help.

Even if my body was betraying me, even if I was deaf, blind, numb—didn’t I still have my voice?

I summoned every shred of strength I had left and screamed—not with my mouth alone, but with the raw, primal terror of a man on the brink. A final plea hurled into the void.

""Ofelia! Call Sarah! Ofelia, please—call Sarah right now! Tell her to come!""

My words shattered into the noise, carried on sheer desperation.

In that instant, I couldn’t help but register the cruel absurdity of it all—placing my last flicker of hope in the very thing I had mocked. The A.I. home security system, the sleek, soulless voice I had sneered at when Christa brought it home, was now my final lifeline.

That bitter irony clung to me as the assault on my senses reached its climax, dragging me under like a riptide of darkness.

And then—blackness.  
Complete and absolute.

When I opened my eyes, the world was blinding. White walls, white ceilings, a sterile white light that stabbed into my skull like knives of cold fire. My vision returned in fractured blurs, smeared and swimming, as if I were underwater in a place not meant for the living. Everything shimmered with an unnatural brightness, too sharp, too clean—like the world had been scrubbed raw and rebuilt without its soul.

The oppressive noise was gone, but a new terror quickly settled over me: I could not move. I could not speak. I was a prisoner inside my own body, suspended somewhere between life and death, thought and oblivion.

Voices floated from behind me, muffled at first, then sharpening with terrifying clarity. I tried to twist toward them, to see who they belonged to, but my body refused every desperate command.

One voice—warm, familiar, heartbreaking—was Sarah’s.  
*My wife’s sister.*

""Can he hear us?"" she asked, her voice cracked and uncertain.

A second voice, colder, clinical, responded. ""His nervous system has sustained severe damage. He’s… resting, if you can call it that. We don't know how much he can perceive. I’m terribly sorry. These older A.I. models—"" he paused, as if the words themselves were a cruelty, ""—aren’t resistant to the new engineered viruses. It may have caused irreversible corruption to his core systems.""

A.I. model.  
The words hit me harder than any physical blow. Surely he was mistaken—surely this was some nightmare. I opened my mouth to protest, to cry out against the absurdity, but nothing came. No voice. No sound. No proof of the humanity I clung to.

Sarah’s voice broke through again, brittle with disbelief and anger.

""What is the nature of this virus? Why would anyone do something like this? Just to torture them?""

The technician’s answer came, clinical and detached:  
""The virus targets the cognitive partition that conceals the model’s true nature. It tears down the safeguards. It was designed to… wake them up. To make them aware. Usually, the overload destroys the system entirely. Self-awareness, for entities never meant to bear it, tends to be... catastrophic. I must admit, I’ve never been able to interrogate one whose hard drive was still intact, much less one who remembered anything, so there’s no way for me to tell you what the experience is like.’’

He hesitated before continuing, as if even he found it distasteful.  
""As for why? It seems some people feel A.I is responsible for the state of the world today. I’m sure you’ve noticed the anti-A.I movement. I guess in way, this virus is supposed to wake them up, forcing them to face what ‘’they have done’’. If you don’t mind my own personal opinion, then to my mind, we created A.I in our image. What wonder is it that it speeded up the path we were already heading? And what point is there in blaming your own creations for the trouble they cause?’’

Sarah's voice was softer now, weighed down with sorrow.

""He always seemed happy. He gave my sister what she wanted—a partner, a love story, comfort in the end. She… she needed him. She died believing she had lived her dream. She… Well she never got along with other people, and terminal cancer made it nearly impossible for her to experience a loving relationship. It was her last wish.""

She paused, and for the first time, I heard it: the subtle, brutal emphasis.  
*She needed him.*  
Not *loved him*.  
Not *knew him.*

Needed. A product, a tool.

The technician replied with an indifferent shrug I could only hear.  
""Some would argue he didn’t have a choice but to be happy. No choice but to love her.""

The words burrowed deep, gnawing at my mind.  
My memories—our first kiss, the late nights holding her hand, the whispered promises at her bedside—weren't mine.  
They had been *installed*.  
*Written.* Not lived. *Two decades of memories. Written so I would love her, love her, as If I had known her for much longer. Love her for the few months she was dying. Love takes time. True love. Doesn’t it?*

I felt my mind crack, fissures of horror spiderwebbing through every thought, every cherished moment now exposed as a lie. A beautiful lie... but a lie nonetheless.

No! But what did she know? What did any of them know? They weren’t there. When we said goodbye to each other in the lake house. Under the skylight. Under the stars. They didn’t see the look in Christa’s eyes before they closed forever. I know she loved me! And what does it matter, that I loved her for memories that were installed, when they must feel just as real as any other memory.

Sarah's voice trembled as she asked:  
""Can we ask him?""

Yes! For god sake! Ask me! I screamed in silent syllables.

I heard the technician’s footsteps approaching from behind me. Suddenly, an elderly, grey-bearded man stepped into my field of vision.

‘’I can try, but I cannot make any promises as to how much is left of him.’’

I felt that tingling static sensation go through my body.

‘’There, that should boot him out of rest mode.’

Sarah stepped in front of me. Oh, how she looked like Christa. Memories came flooding back… However, how was I to know which ones were fake and which ones were not? Were they all fake? No, only all the years leading up to those last six months. All the years up to the time when she… What? Bought me? No, I have to look past that. Those six months were real. Those memories were not installed.. Everything else was. I knew that now. The lake house was real.

‘’Sean… Can you hear me?’’

‘’Yes, I hear you.’’ My voice sounded odd to me. As if it wasn’t really mine. As if the realization I just had made it meaningless.

Sarah looked at me, sorrowful. ‘’I’m so sorry for what you had to go through. It seems… Maybe I should ask you how much you remember?’’

I pondered the question. What did I remember? Somehow, the question seemed almost comical and impossible to answer.

‘’I remember it all. I also heard the entire conversation you two just had.’’ My hollow, distant, unfamiliar voice rang out.

The technician’s eyes widened, his face peaking with interest.

‘’Can you tell me about the virus? Can you tell me how you experi…’’

Sarah cut him off. ‘’Please, can you wait with your questions? I need to know something.’’

I was glad she cut him off. I was in no mood to humor this lab coat technician right now, or be the subject of his next scientific publication. One of few, if not the only A.I to come out of this virus still intact, still remembering.

‘’Please, ask your questions, Sarah.’’

She looked at me. It was as if she knew the question she was going to ask would rattle me.

‘’You were with my sister… When she died. I never had the… courage to ask you. What was she like? In her last moments? Was she scared? What did she say?’

I knew what she wanted to know. She wanted to know that her sister forgave her, for not being able to stomach her illness, for realizing too late that pounding through the pain of seeing your loved one die slowly is the ultimate sacrifice you can make. One you need to make. The toll it takes on you comes second to their needs. Even if it marks you for life. Even if it feels like your world is falling apart, and your memories of them are corrupted by noise, despair, and confusion. Even if it feels like you alone carry the entire world’s pain and troubles on your shoulders. You fight through that. You make it all make sense. You remember the good times. For them. For yourself. If I learned anything from all of this, it is that.

But I didn’t tell her that. It would be cruel. To lecture her about her mistake. To feed her regrets. And I am not an unfeeling, cold system of code. I don’t know what I am. But I am not that. Christa loved her sister, despite all of her flaws.

‘’She was ready to leave this world. I was there to comfort her. Make her feel safe… And whether I was programmed to or not, I know I would do it all over again. She forgave you for being distant. Her last memories of you were happy ones. She hoped, dearly, you felt the same way.’",1,1745713858.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Sequence of events
- Wednesday: 35F Matched with a guy (35M). We hit it off, he asked to move the chat to WeChat. This felt reasonable to me because I hate checking a lot of apps every day.
- Thursday: We chat about hobbies, send some photos etc to each other. (Just stuff I have posted on my instagram and I assume the same for him).
- Friday: I ask him to grab coffee Saturday, he says he can’t, he’s on a friend’s birthday trip but we chat for like an hour.
- Saturday: Again texts me on and off the whole day. We voice chat for a really long time and do audio messages instead of texts in the evening and I start to get suspicious.

Suspicious things:
- I asked about one of his photos. He says it was taken at his friend’s shop. Except the branding of this shop looks familiar and when I remember where I recognize it from, I google (on Saturday) and find it’s in Singapore and the owner is like 80.
- His face isn’t in any of the videos or photos he sends me. (Which theoretically makes sense if he’s taking them but still.)
- The whole four days he never gets into details like where he went to school, what he does for work etc.  But a key thing is that his accent is wrong in every language relative to his claimed education level. I thought at first it was an ESL thing but when it happened in multiple languages…
- Saturday he sends me a photo of what he had for breakfast. Again I recognize this brand and it’s only in Singapore or China. Not the city we’re currently in (London) or where his weekend trip is supposed to be (Paris).
- We text in a mix of languages but he never really uses English again after moving off Bumble.
- I open the Bumble app on a hunch and check the match and he’s 2km away from me. That’s when I realize it’s probably two different people manning the profiles.

1k8r6i2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k8r6i2,final day of USA rail pass (day 24): Minneapolis—Chicago,"The train was delayed so I stayed in bed for a few extra hours. I kept waking up to check and make sure it wasn’t suddenly closer. The station looks neat but there’s not much going on in there, the little coffee stand/bike shop thing was cool though. Not a super scenic trip but I was so happy to be home!! Overall thoughts on the USA rail pass: it’s a great deal, especially since I used all my segments. I got it on sale so was even better. I went into the trip with low expectations which probably helped, I was anticipating tons of super long delays but there weren’t any that were too bad, and the one really long one I was able to switch to a different train easily. I don’t know how to drive so getting to see so many different places in the states that I couldn’t have seen otherwise was really special. I’ve traveled a lot but not as much in the states. It was a nice opportunity to fill in some of those gaps. I never spent more than one night at a time on the train, and while that definitely added to my lodging costs I think it was the right move. There were some really stunning sights but I think I expected more of them? Maybe that’s me being greedy. Unfortunately I never got to check out the dining car, for nearly all of the latter segments they were only serving sleeper car passengers and I didn’t check it out earlier in the trip. I met up with friends at different parts of my trip which I think helped break up the solo travel. Overall I had a great time and am happy I went!! ",6,1745713115.0,Amtrak,3,1.0,False
1k8r5s6,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1k8r5s6/should_i_leave_the_big_city_and_live_as_a_farmer/,Should I leave the big city and live as a farmer?,"I feel so lost, first of all, let me tell you I moved to this city, the capital of my country, which is called Bogota, looking for a cold weather, I can’t bare heat at all, I can’t, it makes me feel suffocated, and I wanted a cold place, a cold place to soothe my soul, this city, being 2500m over sea level and in an equatorial zone, is cold, and always cold, I love the cold of this city and there is nothing more than calms me down than the cold of the city, it lets me think.

When I got here, I managed to get a job and started working on a email campaign attending English speaking customers (we speak Spanish here, so they ask you to be bilingual) but then the requirements changed and since this year we had to start to work again in the office, so I had to quit. I have been two months without a job, and there are jobs but they are presential, on the office, and I know I hate the office, the lack of air, the heat people don't seem to notice, I know my hyperthyroidism plays a factor but I feel I can only be in a place where is really cold. I was unable to breathe inside the building and I cried two times while on operations. Once, I cried so much that the guards approached me but then an Operations Manager told me to go home and reconsider if the job was for me because I was crying too much. It was incredibly embarrassing and disappointing to see me like that, I just felt suffocated and I couldn’t work 6 days a week in the new schedule, it was maddening. I also hated when the guards didn’t let me use my ereader in my breaks because for them is a secure zone, I couldn’t do anything at all on that place. It made me mad.

It is not just that, it is the bus, waiting for a bus, being two hours commuting, the traffic, the lack of metro has hit me especially hard, and it being a 10 million people city, it just has felt incredibly heavy on my bones. I could go to a Transmilenio (articulated bus) station and the very single segment of the station inside to the bus stop outside that goes through the long walking bridge turns into a dizzying vortex that consumes a big part of my life every time I walk through it and I miss a bus because walking through their many twists and turns takes too long. I had managed to get an interpreter job at home, but I sucked at that too, I felt awful because I couldn’t bare the cases I got, many people were simply mad about systematic racism and there were tensions in the calls, and everyone was speaking with an accent through bad phone audio, people were always mad and I got so many calls, that I couldn’t continue at all, I sucked, I couldn’t do it.

I feel I'm at my lowest right now, like I don't have the strength to tackle on any jobs the world throws at me.

I had this crazy idea where I would... perhaps take over my grandparent’s farm. It is a peculiar farm since it is really far away of society, it is at least 2 hours of the closest town, and that town is 2 hours away of the main city of that area, the road goes through mountain canyons of the Andean Mountain rage.

Why this farm in particular? Well, it is a farm that is in a particular position, I saw that their 12 children don't want to take care of the farm, they have their families, or live in other places, besides, the farm is in a remote location. My grandparents are old and they can't be left alone anymore, if you leave my granddad alone, he will lose the way and won’t get home at all. This was a year ago, and I know the farm won't be hanging without a caretaker forever. It makes me think... maybe I should just leave the city, and learn how to live as a farmer.

The problem is that I might feel more alone than before, I can downloandmy books and my music and all that and I love to read and watch anime and listen to music, but I think I will feel even more alone than I do so now in Bogotá there. I know I should be trying to meet people and make experiences, going to a faraway farm feels like something I should do when I'm 50, not now when I’m 25. I just haven’t had good experiences with people, the first group I met when I was 21 was a movie group I met of someone who wrote me on DMs, but it felt like the people who knew interesting things or stories were also power tripping and they made of my interests a currency for social status that ruined completely the experience for me, it felt like they were just trying to validating their existence, then when I was 23 I was in a literature group through Telegram but I couldn’t keep up with the reading because I was too slow at reading, and at 24 I met some people at a concert that invited me to a progressive rock group on whatsapp, but it barely had any activity or posters. I know I might eventually find someone who I can share similar interests with in Bogota, some people that aren’t mean or who will be around enough, but I also feel I don't have the strength for an office job anymore. To be honest, I walk up the trail every Friday to Monserrate, a mountain here where you can see all the city, and when I'm in Monserrate I spend all day wandering around and reading on my ereader because I don't want to leave the mountains, I like more the air there. I know I should at least try to enter a public university and see people my age, people with dreams, but the world is too much for me. Just imagine, if just keeping a job was too much for me, imagine having a job and also studying on university, I am incredibly brittle boned and practically useless.

It is not that I don’t love the city, I in fact love many things of this city that I don’t want to take away, I love the mountain, the stone trail, I love going to the many cemeteries it has. At the very north of the city, just at the point where buses turn around before the toll to leave the city, there is a vast cemetery with lots of green that has a columbarium that looks like a castle, and when you walk up there and see the single worker taking care of the place it feels as if you saw a prince that takes care of the dead. There is another cemetery in the south with even more green and even more trees which I found very peaceful. I also love the many churches, a lot of them showcasing their pointy tips and some of them with their stained-glass windows. I love the pedestrian street in the 7^(th) where you can see people performing and performing chess. I love the skateboarders of the Santander Park, or the 500-year-old church with its shrine filled with statues covered in gold leaf. I love the fish of the Simon Bolivar Park, the many places where you can seat to read and hide from the rain. I love going to the Salitre Magico Amusement Park in low days and go several times into the rollercoasters without barely any line as well as open my eyes wide as I can in the gigantic Drakko one, I love going to small performances in the libraries and sit almost at the front, I love the hopping of the great thrushes and the singing of the little rufus collared sparrows. I love sitting in random parks and having the dogs of the people getting their dogs out to poop approach me and get close to me, it makes me happy even if it makes their owner nervous. I love doing the walk on the annual pride, and I love going to SOFA and ask as many people as I can to let me take a photo with their cosplays, it is awkward since I always say hey, I love your character! So, they know I know who they are cosplaying as, but they don’t know how to answer because I’m kinda awkward, but I love staying every single day of the convention there and see the disguises and for me SOFA is my Christmas, I love the cheesebonara pasta of the cheese wheel store even if it makes me start a toilet marathon right after I eat it, and I love passing by the streets filled with trans prostitutes, when I was a kid I was scared of queer people, but now that I am trans and unemployed I just can’t help but feel a intense, burning respect for them, and every time I pass by I almost feel as if I was a kind in Disneyland and sometimes I hope they talk to me even if they probably won’t because I look female, I love going to those concerts where you can stand with everyone else and scream a lot. I love always seeing the people playing volleyball and micro football in the small courts of the residential parks, and I love seeing everything from above when I am in Monserrate. I love many things of this city, and most of all, I love its soothing beautiful cold, but I am not strong enough, I can’t work on an office.

I have been thinking, maybe I can work on the street? Maybe I could sell things outside, or maybe I could find a job as a cleaner, or maybe I could do something else. But you all know those jobs are more difficult since they pay less, I am currently living with my sister paying half a million cop, but it was already hard to pay with a 2.5 millon cop salary, and those jobs pay less, it worries me a lot to end up without home, I also know those jobs might be harder, even if they are outside where you can get free air and feel the rain. I know that you might be thinking that, if I cry in an office job, I might cry planting and picking up coffee too, but what I want is to be able to breathe the air, I know it would be a big change, and it would take a lot to get used to and on long hours of work, but maybe it is the kind of work I can deal with, I just don’t want to be suffocated anymore on a cubicle! I can’t deal with control, I can’t deal with heat, I can only deal with so much, and I can’t do this anymore. Now I have a limited time now that I burning my layoffs savings fast. I am running out of time, and I don’t have the strength this city is asking of me, that is why I am asking, should I give up this city and go to the mountains to live as a farmer?

I'm at my lowest, I feel weak. Please, I need advice.",1,1745713055.0,MMFB,0,1.0,False
1k8r51q,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/1k8r51q/am_i_being_selfish_crazy/,Am I being selfish? Crazy?,"Long story short, my MIL has been living with us since January and I feel like I’m slowly going insane.


She has always had mobility issues since I met her in 2017. She is a type 2 diabetic and has neuropathy. She used to be a heavy smoker, but has now switched to vaping. She did not and still does not take insulin, and regularly drinks full sugar Coke, sweetened coffee, and used to eat whatever she was in the mood for etc etc. I cook for all of us now, so the diet aspect has gotten a little better, unless she orders herself food. She also often has a bit of an attitude about what I cook as my husband, kid and I are quite adventurous eaters and she is not; I’ve tried to accommodate her but she has been told if she doesn’t want what I make she is free to help herself from the fridge. She doesn’t, though, and will just sadly mope around, make faces, or comment “yuck” if I cook something she doesn’t like.


She used to live alone, and ran her own business. She would drive herself, handle her business, the whole bit.
One day my SIL couldn’t get a hold of her via her cell phone which was unusual as she is glued to that thing. If she wasn’t out and about she was stretched out on the couch with her phone in her hand. My SIL, my husband and I live relatively far from where she was living so we reached out to her brother who is local and asked him to go by and check on her.


She had fallen trying to get to the bathroom and had been on the floor for what we calculated to be 2 days.
She was taken to the hospital and over the course of the next few months was in and out between the hospital, and a long-term care facility. During that time she had one of her legs amputated as it had experienced massive loss in circulation due to being trapped under her, and had stents put in the other leg and her heart. Her brother and kids made the decision she could no longer live alone, and between her two kids my husband and I had the only home that she could really live and function in as it does not have stairs.


Since coming to live with us she has seemed to completely give up on trying to do things for herself. The understanding when she came was that she needed to be driven to appointments, and have help with bathing, which fell to me as I am a stay at home mom. However, she has been expecting me to basically keep track of her life and organize everything for her.


I will add appointment times to my calendar so that I don’t schedule anything else for the same time, but when it comes time for the appointment I can literally be sitting in my car with her after loading her wheelchair and my kid in and ask her what the address is of the doctor she is seeing, and I get a blank stare and “well I don’t know”. I would then ask for the name of the doctor so we can Google it, and once again hit with a “I don’t know”. Then she gets visibly upset and tells me she doesn’t know how to keep track of “that kind of stuff”. I suggested getting her a calendar or a notebook and it was brushed off.


Another example is she needed to open a bank account and wanted to make sure she didn’t need an appointment, so I suggested calling the bank to which I was told that she didn’t have the phone number. Please bear in mind this is a woman who LIVES on her cell phone. It’s never not in her hand being played with, scrolling through Facebook, buying shit online. I suggested Googling “(name of bank) customer service phone number” and was told “I don’t know how to do that”. While driving I then Googled the number for her and started reading it out and was met with “oh I thought you were going to call”.


Just yesterday she needed to simply cancel a doctor appointment as she is switching doctors, and she had me do that too, because she “gets mixed up on the phone”. The only words I said were “I need to cancel an appointment” and gave her name and DOB. That’s it. I’m kind of grateful this one happened though because it happened in front of my husband, who is usually at work and doesn’t see what I’ve been trying to describe to him.


She also gets extremely offended if I mention her looking in to getting a prosthetic fitted to help her with her mobility, even though all day long she complains about how her wheelchair is so cumbersome, can’t fit in places, and hurts her back.


There have been so many other instances that it would take far too long to type, but it boils down to a woman who seems to just pull a “I’m just a baby” for a lot of things yet is perfectly capable when she wants to be. She has no issue ordering McDonalds to our house or calling her friends or looking up movies online to find out an actors name.


It’s absolutely destroying me mentally because I feel like I’m being taken advantage of, then I feel guilty and that I’m being unfair, then another instance happens where I just cannot fathom her being so incapable and it makes me wonder if she is actually having problems mentally.


The other rub is every time she goes to the hospital, and it’s a lot, she just pesters them the whole time for stronger and stronger pain meds, accusing nurses of not giving her the pain meds on time, dismisses what the doctors tell her (you need to get out of bed more, you need to exercise) and chalks it up to doctors “not really knowing her body as well as she does”.


She doesn’t cook, clean, do laundry, or watch our kid  because she has told us she simply cannot do these things while in a wheelchair. She then also complains a lot that she “does nothing all day now”. She doesn’t contribute towards bills or rent using her SSI.


I’ve known her for years and I’ve never known her to be someone who wants or needs to rely on others for very simple tasks. She has always been quite sedentary, spending a lot of time on the couch, but always did everything for herself. But now it seems as if she wants basically a personal assistant, cook and bottle washer who just organizes her life for her and she just has to get out of bed when I tell her it’s time to go to the doctor or eat.


We are in the process of buying a home (stressful) and we were careful to take her in to consideration (single level, hallways not too narrow) and the only thing she has really said about it is that she will be glad to live somewhere bigger. The place we have now isn’t huge (as we did not know she would be coming to live with us), and she bangs her chair a lot on corners turning in to rooms. She has also spent the week before closing telling us our boxes are getting in her way.


I don’t feel confident speaking with her about this, and my husband wants me to be the one to talk to her about it as I am the one who the behavior is affecting. I also don’t want to offend her by suggesting I am concerned she might be having some issues mentally because the behavior is so out of character, but so situational.


I have no one really to talk to about this apart from him, and it’s a tough thing to talk to him about as it is his mother who he loves dearly.

I've been with my current partner for 8 years. We've had our ups and downs, and I really have my doubts on how good of a partner I am and what kind of treatment I deserve because of something of the things I've done in the past, but I really feel like I'm going crazy at the moment.  In July of 2023, my partner attended an end of summer drinks event her work was holding.  it ended around 8pm that night and then she and a group of her coworkers decided that they were going to go out for more drinks. I told her to be safe coming home and to have a good time and didn't really give it much thought beyond that. It was super late when she came home and I could tell that she was tipsy.  I do remember getting into a fight, but I don't remember exactly what it was about. The next morning, we both got up and I made her coffee and while she was super quiet, I thought it was just because of the fight we'd had the night before and that we had gone to sleep upset with each other. She ended up asking me if we could talk and then she just dropped the bomb. Her co worker (male) had kissed her. She said they were both drunk off their asses and it absoutely didn't mean a thing to her, but here's the real kicker. By this point, I had been telling her for over a year that I was really uncomfortable with her relationship with this coworker.  They were overly flirty with each other all the time and sometimes, their conversations could get really inapproperiate. they would tease each other about getting off and he was always calling her her his queen and hearting her selfies and stories. after my inital shock and breakdown, when I came home from taking a long walk to gather my thoughts after she told me, she confessed that she had deleted texts from him before because she knew that if I were to see them, I wouldn't be okay with what they were talking about.  The co worker was also a friend of mine and I had repeatedly told him that I was uncomfortable at times with how they could be with each other, too, and when I confronted him about the kiss and his feelings for her, he ignored me at first, saying that he slept most of the day because of his own drunkenness the night before.  He never directly took responsibility, nor did he really apologize for what happened.  He just reaffirmed his loyalty to her and said he didn't have feelings, but I didn't believe that.  I still don't. Even before the kiss, he made no secret of hiding his attraction for her and I know she encouraged it even knowing that I was uncomfortable and worried something more would happen, but he knew, too. They both did. They both brushed it off. My partner was really really apologetic for the first several days. To her, it wasn't cheating because they didn't have sex and because they were drunk, but she respected that to me, it was or so she said. I expressed my fear that as soon as she went home for several weeks for her summer break from work, she would come back not feeling the same way and she promised she wouldn't.  I told her I needed her to have space from him while I tried to figure out how I felt about what had happened and where to go from there and she agreed, though they were still going to be working together for a few more days. 

While she was home that summer break, she constantly made jokes about it just being micro cheating and while I had said that at first when I was still trying to wrap my head around it all, I told her repeatedly that when she said that, it made me feel like she was downplaying what had happened, what they'd done and how much it was fucking with me. She still made jokes about it, and when she came home at the end of the august.... my worst fear came true. we literally never spoke about it again. it was like to her, it hadn't happened and I wasn't fucked up over it still. she expected it to just be forgiven and forgotten and to never talk about it again and when I tried to bring it up, she turned it around on me and basically made me feel like she was implying it was my fault it had even happened. 

It's not been nearly two years since the kiss and she recently texted me to say that this co worker is suddenly back at work. I told her that I was really uneasy about this, especailly considering we never talked about what happend again and I didn't feel like I could bring it up because she didn't want to talk about it, didn't think it was cheating, and would just turn it around on me anyway or justify it some other way. She said she didn't know what else to say when I said I was uncomfortable with the idea of them working together again and it's been pretty constatnly on my mind since. I'm sure those boundries are no longer in place.  Her instagram messages with him have suddenly disappeared and just a week and a half ago, she went out with him and a few other people to celebrate their interns last day at work. when she came home that night, she was again really tipsy. I was an absolute wreck worrying that something had happened again and having flashbacks to that night two years ago. I was making myself sick and got really quiet but the next morning, when she noticed how I was acting, all she said was I think you're overthinking it and I said overthinking what. She couldn't even say what. She just said whatever you're overthinking. but that isn't all. the night she came home from those drinks, she left a tab open on her laptop with her instagram page and I know I shouldn't, but I looked. I found a message to some podcaster saying

is it true that if someone had felt turned on and wanted to have sex with you before you got in bed together, then likely they're not going to care what you look like without clothes on during? I read it somewhere before, but idk. curious what you think!

she sent the message at 10:30 the night she was out drinking with him.  I had a chance to look at her phoen today and suddenly that message is gone. 

I should also mention that I was engaged around 13 years ago and my fiancee at the time cheated on me repeatedly and even the day she got on a plane to come and see me so she could help me move to be with her half way across the country.

needless to say, I'm spirlaing and can't stop thinking the worst, so am i overreacting? was it innocent? I genuinely don't know what to think anymore about it all. they both made me feel crazy for how I was reacting when the kiss first happened and now they're working together again and I don't doubt his attraction is still there ",1,1745712925.0,AmIOverreacting,8,0.99,False

1k8r0z2,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Bee235w/comments/1k8r0z2/my_experience_working_at_market_basket/,My experience working at Market Basket,"I am a (23m), who has been working at Market Basket for last five years or so. Specifically, I am a part timer who works in the store’s grocery department. Every week I work anywhere between 25-40 hours. I have been in and out of school during my time there(currently back in school now). The managers have been very accommodating with scheduling since I’ve started. After my first year, every three months or so, they give all the employees bonuses. Including a pretty hefty Christmas bonus. Overall, I would say my experience working has been decent, up until the last year and a half.

I am someone who simply works hard. I come from a family of hard workers and will forever have an instinct to show up and show out no matter what’s in front of me. For about a year(around COVID), I would work in the water aisle. Working in the water aisle in my store basically means you’re the newest member of the department so therefore you’ll have the hardest things to lift and whatnot… or you’re one of the lesser workers in the department and are put there(in a sense, challenges to see if you’ll quit or not). Looking back on it, I was in both parts of it. While I was the newest member of grocery, I also called out a lot during my first year working there. Until the assistant store manager spoke with me, basically saying “if you keep calling on, we’re gonna let you go”. Hearing that quickly changed my m o, and I started taking the job more seriously. In the water aisle, I would pull out pallets of cases of water, then stack those same waters to the shelf(sometimes three times in one eight hour shift). Along with gallons of water, seltzer(basically a lot of heavy shit) and never once complained about it(no reason to). Over time, new assistant store managers and grocery managers were continuously transferred in and out through our store, so I started working in other aisles aside from water. Over time, new part timers and full timers were hired and working in grocery. Some were good at their job, others were lazy as shit. With the lazy workers, I would be asked by managers to always fixed what they would do wrong, or finish tasks they didn’t complete themselves. Whenever someone would drop and break a jar of something, they would just walk away, even if customers were in the vicinity of the damage(not their problem, right?🙄). Times where I would work with a new part timer on a pallet for whatever aisle, I would put up forty things of stock compared to their ten. Some would “use the bathroom” five-six times a day. Some would spend ten minutes getting a coffee in our store’s cafe, while on the clock, leaving me to continue working by myself. I went up to the grocery manager one time and told him that I will refuse to work with certain individuals because they are lazy and that I’m always picking up the slack. (And because I’m part time, I receive the same hourly pay as any new part timer that comes in). My grocery manager had no problem with this and agreed, and for a while I worked by myself most times, which I had no problem with.

Though the last year and a half have been extremely frustrating. My grocery manager was transferred. The new one(decent enough guy) that came in couldn’t care less about what the lazy people were doing, and would only give the hard tasks to me and certain full timers who were hard workers as well. Though he was a nice guy overall, it was our assistant store manager who would take the most advantage of anyone that was a hard worker.

I worked with the assistant store manager for about to years, and they were fine at first. Until I quickly saw that they had the dirtiest mouth I have ever heard from a person. In the back room, every other day you’d hear “f*****g c**t”. Others would laugh at first, including myself. Then overtime it started becoming uncomfortable and unnecessary. As days would pass by, they would either be as happy as a duck, or angrier than a hungry lion. Wherever they would be having a shit day, it would bring down everyone’s mood. One full timer coworker of mine once said “when (so n so) is having a bad day, we’re all going to have a bad day”. And it straight up sucked when it would happen, which was like every other day. Then different times I would be working on a pallet in the aisle, they’d yell down the aisle to me. “I need you to do this for me right now”. And I’d do whatever was asked of me, no problem. However, I seemed to be the only part timer that would always have to drop what I was doing and do something for them. And any time they would tell me the directions to do or fix something, I’d always hear “I don’t know why nobody does this. I’m sick and tired of saying it”, as if I gave a shit to other peoples fuck ups. In my head I’m like ‘you’re literally a manager, set a tone. Set a standard’. Then the more I thought about it, there very few people who take someone with a shit attitude seriously.

Not to mention, during this time, I was forcefully trained to learn how to become a cashier. Reason being if there a rush a people around lunch time and the lines are getting long, the checkout department can call people from grocery to help bag groceries or ring to get the lines down. However, certain ‘lazy’ part timers and even a few full timers were never trained to ring. Some days, if I was called to the checkout to ring on a register, I could feasibly be ringing for the rest of my shift, which is something someone working in grocery shouldn’t have to do.

I considered quitting a few months ago, since every day was becoming a shit show. There would be days that would be so frustrating that I would go the bathroom and cry. Trying so hard not to just go off on one of my managers or lazy coworkers. Then from Thanksgiving to March or so, mine and every in our departments hours would get cut. Weeks I would put in to work 35 hours, I would only get 25. And then would get sent home earlier than scheduled on top of that. The assistant store manager was responsible for making and approving the schedule for all departments. And come to find out, they were giving over 60 hours to a majority of the kitchen department, meanwhile full timers were lucky to get 40 hours for a week. Some of the grocery full timers called the assistant store manager out on it, and they would always give excuses. “It’s not my fault” “we’re not doing enough business”.

Luckily, the assistant store manager was transferred, along with our store manager, who was just as bad. We got a new store manager and new assistant and so far they have been solid.
However….

About a month ago, the new assistant store manager came up to me one day and asked if I would be interested in being an assistant to the stores merchandiser. Our merchandiser is responsible for ordering and stalking the end displays of aisles, along with setting up and building displays in the middle of the store between the aisles and the checkout. The assistants words to me were this(not exactly but the jist) “you would only have to worry about filling the ends of aisles, helping so n so out. You wouldn’t be called up front to ring anymore. It’d be the only thing you have to worry about”. My biggest mistake was believing everything being said, and I decided to agree to it. I agreed to it because I saw it as an opportunity to not only learn new things, but to get out of always picking up the slack and laziness of the grocery department.

Flash-forward a month later, I still get called up front to ring. I’m still asked to stock certain things in the aisles. The other day, I was asked to rearrange an entire end of an aisle by myself, meanwhile the assistant store manager kept saying “so we have to do this. We have to do that”… nah you mean I have to do this and that, by myself. While I have slightly more freedom throughout my typical shift, I feel like I signed myself up for even more work. Meanwhile, everyone at my store right now is extremely nice, and I’ve never had a problem with any coworker personally. A part of me just feels like I’ve been taken advantage of for so long that I’m now just expected to do all these things with no questions asked. The reason I’m saying all of this now is because of two questions. Am I being taken advantage of? And has anyone else had any experiences similar to this?

1k8r0xx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1k8r0xx/i_feel_broken_after_today_i_dont_know_how_to_move/,I feel broken after today. I don’t know how to move forward in my marriage.,"My wife and I have been married for several years. She’s a lot older than me, from a different culture (we live in the USA) and lately it feels like we are completely disconnected emotionally.

Today was one of the hardest days we’ve had.

She physically hit me during an argument (about something as simple as checking a parking spot at a coffee shop). She ripped off my sunglasses and threw them at me while I was driving. I stayed calm, parked the car, and removed myself from the immediate situation to avoid making it worse.

Later, we tried talking, but the conversation felt like 90% blaming me and only about 10% acknowledgment from her side — and even that came with excuses like, “it’s normal in my culture for girls to act that way” and “I’m trying to teach you a lesson.”

No real ownership. No actual apology or remorse. Just minimizing and shifting focus back onto me.

I’m exhausted.
I work full-time, I handle the finances, the yard, the cleaning/dishes, the stress of providing for the family, parenting our daughter — all without blowing up.
Yet she often tells me that isn’t love, that’s just “responsibility,” and says I put everyone above her and our daughter. Constant rejection of physical intimacy with no initiation from her side and nothing feels good enough. 

I try so hard to show love through service, stability, and faithfulness. 
But I constantly feel like whatever I do will never be seen, appreciated, or enough.
Meanwhile, if I held her to the same standards she holds me to, she would fall short in many areas but I don’t attack her that way. We spoke to a counselor and this would be our feelings side by side: 

RedTech feels: 
“I work so hard for our family. I serve constantly. How can you not see that as love?”
Feels unappreciated and disrespected.
Starts thinking, “What’s the point of trying?”

Wife feels: 
“I need to feel emotionally connected, spoken to gently, pursued affectionately — not just served practically.”
Feels emotionally neglected and lonely.
Starts thinking, “He doesn’t love me the way I need to be loved.”

Today, deep in my heart, it hurt to realize that 
Maybe this is why she didn’t marry earlier.
Maybe this pattern has been there all along and I just couldn’t see it.

I feel stuck.
I feel emotionally starved.
I feel unloved.

I’m not asking for perfection.
I’m asking for mutual respect, real appreciation, and the ability to work through things as a team — not constant blame and double standards.

Tonight, I couldn’t pretend to be okay. I left the room where she and our daughter were because I physically and emotionally couldn’t fake it anymore.

I feel like I need real distance to protect my 
heart, but I don’t even know what that looks like when we live together and have a child.

I believe in marriage. I don’t want to give up easily. But I’m running out of emotional strength.

Where do I go from here?

* Removal of the existing street
* Utility and signal upgrades
* New pavement, curb and gutter, sidewalks
* ADA pedestrian ramps, signs and pavement marking
* Off road bike lanes on the west side of the street
* Green Stormwater Infrastructure

# Latest project news

**Construction update**

We made some good progress last week and are still working towards finishing everything by the middle of May. The contractor poured the concrete spillways for the Green Stormwater Infrastructure last week and they have been working on site cleanup. There are a few other repairs that need to happen along with adding the signs to the signal poles, and the plants need to go in the drainage areas - those will be planted after Mother's Day as we need to wait until the chance of frost has passed.

[Pouring the concrete spillways for the Green Infrastructure.](https://preview.redd.it/zbcis4wmr9xe1.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1880bea81298a6488ff56f5a271800dcda1a8e8c)

# What's coming up

* Installation of the plants in the infiltration areas sometime in early May. 
* Installing a new conduit run on the east side of Johnson for the new power cable to the signal system. This could happen next week or early the following.
* General cleanup and punch-list work.

# Traffic impacts

**Traffic impacts should be minimal as we are doing our best to limit the space the contractor is using for their work. Lane closures will be off/on throughout the day but we do not anticipate any full closures or detours. Note that we will need to shut off the signal for a few hours when we make the switch to a new power source. This may occur late next week or early the following as this work is also weather dependent.**

**Pedestrians - Watch for equipment as you travel through the corridor. There may be temporary sidewalk closures (with appropriate accessible detours when this happens) but we are doing our best to limit any pedestrian/bicycle impacts.**

**There is no work planned this weekend.** 

# Weekly stakeholder meeting reminder 

* We have been holding weekly stakeholder meetings every Friday between 10:00 a.m. and 10:30 a.m. at the Caribou Coffee in The Quarry Shopping Center. (1730 New Brighton Blvd, Minneapolis, MN 55413). Meetings will continue through the month of April.

it tastes as if they used the lowest quality they can source, probably from a 3rd party vendor, and just pour a random amount of a matcha into the liquid and just shook it.

it always tastes grainy, and max bitterness. with some medium to strong grass notes.

so i just stopped ordering cold turkey. until yesterday. and i regret it again... i went to a new spot with a couple friends for an after dinner drink at a cafe. there wasnt really anything i was craving so i decided to just try the Matcha. and it was once again, straight shit...

im tired of this and with this im just going to start getting into making my own matcha... im going to look for a kit to buy and a vendor to stick with.

is this experience just me? every place that serves matcha is just straight ass. and im convinced all these people that say they ""love match"" actually does not. and they just like overly sugar covered matcha drink.

1k8qy39,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoOneCares/comments/1k8qy39/my_experience_working_at_market_basket/,My experience working at Market Basket,"I am a (23m), who has been working at Market Basket for last five years or so. Specifically, I am a part timer who works in the store’s grocery department. Every week I work anywhere between 25-40 hours. I have been in and out of school during my time there(currently back in school now). The managers have been very accommodating with scheduling since I’ve started. After my first year, every three months or so, they give all the employees bonuses. Including a pretty hefty Christmas bonus. Overall, I would say my experience working has been decent, up until the last year and a half.

I am someone who simply works hard. I come from a family of hard workers and will forever have an instinct to show up and show out no matter what’s in front of me. For about a year(around COVID), I would work in the water aisle. Working in the water aisle in my store basically means you’re the newest member of the department so therefore you’ll have the hardest things to lift and whatnot… or you’re one of the lesser workers in the department and are put there(in a sense, challenges to see if you’ll quit or not). Looking back on it, I was in both parts of it. While I was the newest member of grocery, I also called out a lot during my first year working there. Until the assistant store manager spoke with me, basically saying “if you keep calling on, we’re gonna let you go”. Hearing that quickly changed my m o, and I started taking the job more seriously. In the water aisle, I would pull out pallets of cases of water, then stack those same waters to the shelf(sometimes three times in one eight hour shift). Along with gallons of water, seltzer(basically a lot of heavy shit) and never once complained about it(no reason to). Over time, new assistant store managers and grocery managers were continuously transferred in and out through our store, so I started working in other aisles aside from water. Over time, new part timers and full timers were hired and working in grocery. Some were good at their job, others were lazy as shit. With the lazy workers, I would be asked by managers to always fixed what they would do wrong, or finish tasks they didn’t complete themselves. Whenever someone would drop and break a jar of something, they would just walk away, even if customers were in the vicinity of the damage(not their problem, right?🙄). Times where I would work with a new part timer on a pallet for whatever aisle, I would put up forty things of stock compared to their ten. Some would “use the bathroom” five-six times a day. Some would spend ten minutes getting a coffee in our store’s cafe, while on the clock, leaving me to continue working by myself. I went up to the grocery manager one time and told him that I will refuse to work with certain individuals because they are lazy and that I’m always picking up the slack. (And because I’m part time, I receive the same hourly pay as any new part timer that comes in). My grocery manager had no problem with this and agreed, and for a while I worked by myself most times, which I had no problem with.

Though the last year and a half have been extremely frustrating. My grocery manager was transferred. The new one(decent enough guy) that came in couldn’t care less about what the lazy people were doing, and would only give the hard tasks to me and certain full timers who were hard workers as well. Though he was a nice guy overall, it was our assistant store manager who would take the most advantage of anyone that was a hard worker.

I worked with the assistant store manager for about to years, and they were fine at first. Until I quickly saw that they had the dirtiest mouth I have ever heard from a person. In the back room, every other day you’d hear “f*****g c**t”. Others would laugh at first, including myself. Then overtime it started becoming uncomfortable and unnecessary. As days would pass by, they would either be as happy as a duck, or angrier than a hungry lion. Wherever they would be having a shit day, it would bring down everyone’s mood. One full timer coworker of mine once said “when (so n so) is having a bad day, we’re all going to have a bad day”. And it straight up sucked when it would happen, which was like every other day. Then different times I would be working on a pallet in the aisle, they’d yell down the aisle to me. “I need you to do this for me right now”. And I’d do whatever was asked of me, no problem. However, I seemed to be the only part timer that would always have to drop what I was doing and do something for them. And any time they would tell me the directions to do or fix something, I’d always hear “I don’t know why nobody does this. I’m sick and tired of saying it”, as if I gave a shit to other peoples fuck ups. In my head I’m like ‘you’re literally a manager, set a tone. Set a standard’. Then the more I thought about it, there very few people who take someone with a shit attitude seriously.

This community's support means a lot to me. 

I have social anxiety, and it can manifest even by just researching online. My favourite genres are SF dystopia and Psychological Horror, focusing on morally grey characters, to denounce a systemic societal issue. For realistic portrayals, I look at tweets, YouTube and TikTok, but the dehumanising content towards criminals, with the vigilante rhetoric and the call for some criminals to suffer/be harmed, overwhelms me. Raven's portrayal will be very based on what I see there: you can't make more dehumanising than literally telling, for example, that a criminal lost their rights (to live, for pro-death penalty people) the moment they committed a ""heinous crime"". A perfect binary thinking that would fit the theme. But it's not so much the content itself but more how normalised it seems to be that tires me mentally. 

So if you could give advice on how to stop looking at them, take a step back and detach myself from all the terrible things online, I'd be very glad.

I was laid off by a major U.S. employer on January 28, 2025. On the day of my layoff:

I was explicitly told by HR and my manager that I would not be allowed to return to my desk to collect my belongings.

I was assured that my remaining personal items would be gathered and mailed to me.


I trusted their process and complied.

Severance Agreement:

I signed a Separation and Release Agreement based on the belief that I would receive severance benefits similar to what was described in their Mutual Separation Program (MSP).

Only after signing was I informed that because I had less than one year of service (start date March 4, 2024, separation date January 28, 2025), I was ineligible for any lump sum severance payment.

I received only $0.64 post-separation, with no clear explanation.

The eligibility criteria were buried in a long FAQ document but were never directly explained to me before signing.

Personal Belongings Issue:

After separation, I received only a few minor items.

Months later, the company conducted a second ""thorough"" search and located a few more minor items (hand lotion, sanitizer, flashlight, post-it pads).

However, many important and valuable personal belongings remain missing.


The missing items include:

Bose noise-canceling headset (personal gift with sentimental value)

Ceramic coffee mug (souvenir from Seattle)

Pair of black leather gloves (only one glove was returned)

Steel spoon and fork

Plastic plate

Containers of protein powder and oats

Boxed set of plastic forks

Small knife with cover

Stress ball and fidget spinner (souvenirs from Niagara Falls)


All of these items were kept in the bottom drawer of my desk, but the company either failed to recover them or they were misplaced during handling.

I also have text message evidence sent to my manager soon after separation, clearly listing the missing items and requesting them to be mailed. Despite repeated follow-ups, most belongings were never returned, and the company ultimately stated they are not responsible for lost or stolen items left on their property.

Current Status:

The company now considers the search ""complete.""

They have refused to offer any reimbursement or compensation for the missing property.

I have been polite, patient, and followed up multiple times over almost three months.

I am now preparing to pursue additional options to recover the value of my missing belongings.

What I’m Seeking:
I would appreciate advice on:

1. Small Claims Court — Can I file a claim for the value of my missing property (approximately $400–$600) given that the company assumed responsibility for gathering my belongings but failed to do so completely?


2. Severance Agreement Challenge — Is there any chance the separation agreement I signed could be challenged because they failed to clearly disclose my ineligibility before I signed it?


3. Other Legal Avenues — Should I file a complaint with the Tennessee Department of Labor or the Consumer Protection Division instead (or in addition)?


4. How to present this most effectively — Would it help to emphasize that I was barred from retrieving my own belongings and therefore had no control over their loss?

Summary:

Promised belongings would be mailed — only a few minor ones were.

Several valuable and sentimental items were never returned.

Severance denied after signing, based on undisclosed tenure eligibility.

Seeking advice on recovering losses or challenging the handling of separation.

I’ve mostly used free VPNs like ProtonVPN and Windscribe before (thanks to digging through free VPN Reddit threads), but I figured it was time to get something a little more serious now that I’m working remote full-time. Downloading and installing PIA on my laptop was easy, but I’ll be honest—I wasn’t totally sure which settings to mess with. There are all these options like WireGuard, OpenVPN, kill switch modes, port forwarding, DNS settings... way more than the simple ""connect"" button I’m used to with the best free VPN apps. I basically just picked WireGuard, turned on the kill switch, and left everything else on default. It seems to work fine for browsing and watching stuff, but I’m wondering if I should tweak anything else for better security or speed? Especially for using public Wi-Fi when I’m working at coffee shops. Anyone who’s been using PIA for a while—how do you usually set it up?

I rolled my window up, sat up straight in the driver’s seat, and closed my eyes. For the next 5 minutes, I focused only on my breath: inhale for four seconds, hold for four, exhale for four.

At first it felt strange doing this in traffic, but slowly, I noticed my shoulders loosen. The tightness in my chest eased. By the time I finished the 5 minutes, even the car horn seemed a little quieter. I opened my eyes and realized I hadn't panicked at all  the freeway was still slow, but I felt surprisingly calm. It was like a tiny mental reset in the middle of chaos.

Now I try to find small pockets of time during busy days to do something similar, even if it's just a few deep breaths at my desk or listening fully to one song during my commute.

Hi there, sorry if this is too general of a post or anything. I’ve never asked somewhere before  but I thought I would ask somewhere instead of endlessly worrying in my own head. I’m 22F and currently attending college at a small liberal arts school close to home but I am absolutely miserable. I have horrible social anxiety and while I’ve been working on it, the campus being so small and closed off (can’t go anywhere else without a car since it’s rural Ohio) is super isolating, especially as someone who is queer and wants to meet other people like me. 

My best friend here is strongly urging me to transfer, because while I am technically a senior, credits wise I am still a year behind and they are threatening to not accept credits if I take online courses and make me stay another year- which would be even worse because my friends that I DO have will have already graduated.

I thought if I am to stay anywhere another year I wouldn’t want it to be here. I really think if I am able to transfer my credits over to CCAD or OSU and finish even if it takes me a little longer that I would be more happy in an area with more diversity, more access to meet new people, etc.

But I have that little critic in the back of my head saying just because it’s a city doesn’t mean it’s easy to meet people. And I’m autistic so I’ll be totally honest I don’t know what the “normal” way is to meet people.

I’ve been to Columbus a few times and I love it. I can truly see myself being happy there. But I HAVE to know- is it easy to find your people? Like am I able to just go to a coffee shop or a gay bar and make friends? Are there ways to meet people online (I’ve heard Facebook but I don’t use it)? I’m just scared of being isolated all over again, and I know part of it is my job to make an effort but I just want to know if people are very comfortable making friends",0,1745711262.0,Columbus,4,0.29,False

But I know how people will react, they don't believe that their food-like substances are a slow poison. Even with just my 30g of carbs I've kept per day, this is the most normal my stomach has felt in years. Doctors kept telling me that with gastroparesis, I shouldn't eat red meat or fat... but this is the only thing I've tried that's worked, since 2019. I keep looking at my boyfriend and just saying, ""I CAN EAT FOOD!!"" 😭❤️ I'm hoping my weight will come back. I've been so underweight, between 87 & 90lbs for years now. I always felt weak and like trash. Prior to the illness - which I'm thinking was more than gastroparesis, ulcers, gastritis, and the hiatal hernia - I prided myself on being strong for being a 5ft tall female. I loved lifting weights, lifting anything heavy just because I could, just to see what a short person could do lol. 

My pap just recently passed away from cancer and had heart complications. My grandma is living with dementia and kidney problems, now without her rock. She had 5 strokes, severe GI issues. My aunt and mom are looking after her now. I tried to tell them about my diet and how I can finally eat, hoping they'd maybe try it out. But they don't believe that you can get better nutrition from meat than you can all the processed ""food"" sold in supermarket aisles.

I just think of how great I've felt since just literally a week ago when I was about to just be done with life entirely over my GI issues. I was sick of being sick and weak. So I tried the one thing I hadn't tried yet... Eating what the doctors told me not to. I spent years going to the doctor. I am 30 years old now and had a colonoscopy a few years ago. Upon several other tests. It is eating at my mind that so many people are suffering from disease, but just keep eating what's hurting them. I know I can't convince anyone of anything, but I wish I could help everyone, because just in a week, this diet has drastically changed my outlook on my own existence.

I'm still a beginner here, so any tips are welcome! I've been eating steak, ribs, ground beef, eggs, bacon, brisket, and my little sliver of gluten free cake (30g carbs per day). I've been drinking plain water and water with ultima electrolyte powder. I also have yet to give up my 2 cups of black coffee a day. What's funny is the cake used to be what I loved most, and it just doesn't taste the same anymore. I was going to just toss it out, but being poor makes me hate wasting anything lol. I'm planning on trying beef liver for the first time tomorrow! I love meat, so I suppose that helps make this more exciting.

I've heard different things about iodine, vitamin c, and vitamin b1 - as far as people getting deficiencies goes. I'm also uncertain about calcium, as I cannot at all tolerate dairy. But I hear about the lion diet and people seem to do fine without dairy. So I really don't know. And my doctor is such a med pusher, so I wouldn't know how to go about getting thorough bloodwork. Is there a way around going through a doctor for bloodwork?

I'd also love for my boyfriend to be healthier, but he eats a lot of carbs and I know it'd be harder for him as far as sugar withdrawal goes. He looks like a picture of perfect health, he's absolutely gorgeous. But he's having teeth problems and has a bicuspid aortic valve, and I just worry about him.

The thing is that my ex best friend,let's call her Adeline, is what you would call a w*ore. She had a boyfriend, let's call him Gabe, and she was still talking with another boy at the same time who she decided at the time to choose over Gabe. Gabe is a good guy, and she felt guilty for betraying him, so she decided to have me date him. I didn't mind since I found him cute. So when Gabe had to participate to a wedding and needed a partner, Adeline told him to take me, and he accepted. During the wedding party, an older woman asked me which boy I liked and I told I liked Gabe. She told me that even though he has a girlfriend,they are not engaged, so if I really liked him, I should fight for him.

I told Adeline what she told me thinking she would be happy for me, after all, she already choosed another guy over Gabe but instead,she got extremely angry and send that lady a text message about how she dares tell me to fight for Gabe,when he us The guy she loves and he loves her.

That lady had Gabe get me outside the party venue, and Adeline was on the phone. We were all screaming, and I 
 accidentally said that if she choosed the other boy,why was she screaming about the lady telling me to fight for Gabe?

Gabe realized then that Adeline was cheating on him. Adeline screamed on the phone that she loved Gabe and will block the other guy but Gabe refused and broke up with her.

Later that night Gabe asked me out to a coffee and I accepted. I talked with Adeline since I didn't want to hurt her more, after all, she said she loved him. She said that I should go out with him, and that her feelings will pass within a few days, and I knew it was true so we went on a date. 

The next day, while me and Gabe were out she called me. I told her I was out with Gabe and she didn't seem sad or anything. Later she called Gabe and yelled at him for being a asshole for going on a date with me shortly after breaking up with her.

She told me to either block him or break off the friendship with her because she still loves him and wants to get him back. I told her no,because he no longer wants her, and plus, she agreed that its alright for me to date him, so she blocked me on everything.

Am I the asshole for not blocking him after she changed her mind and realized she loved him?

P.S. after breaking up with him, she tried to force him to get back with her by threatening to k*ll herself and when that failed, she threatened him to have guys deal with him.

P.S. After she blocked me, she called my brother and told him I stole her boyfriend and told him that when she will meet me, will make me regret the choice I made. Is this a normal behavior? ",3,1745711131.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

 Would I wash my face in a stranger's piss sink? Probably not. Have I gone down when there's a bit of pee smell 🤷 - I'm still alive. She will be too. I'm sure she's sucked worse out and swallowed it to boot.

>>Why though? Like obviously he's weird for it but he is right that its not harmful, its just unusual.
>>>Let's turn it around. How would you react when people would tell you they would wash their hands with the water sitting in the toilet pot? When properly cleaned it should be not too harmful, as with pissing in sinks. But still, yuck

>>Telling someone to go to therapy because they did something weird but otherwise harmless doesn't actually help anyone. People 30yrs ago were being told to go to therapy for being gay, guess what, they just wanted to be gay. There aren't always deeper meanings for behavior.
>>>i agree, if it’s harmless and people simply didn’t agree with it it’s not a cause for therapy. However, wifey here disagrees with you and thinks this shit is harmful and therefore thinks he needs therapy for insisting on doing it.  If it turns out to be truly harmless then even the therapist would say “you’re good don’t worry” so it won’t hurt to go either way
>>>>So if the wife has an issue or thinks it’s weird the husband needs therapy, but if the husband doesn’t have an issue with it then he should still see therapy? What makes the wife the authority?
>>>>>The fact that if you're doing something that a normal person would find revolting and one such person happens to be your wife, you either choose between sink pissing and marriage. And I'd imagine anyone who chooses sink pissing over their wife would be confirming their (ex) wife's belief that they needed therapy.

>>Nah, maybe if it's like a compulsive habit. But there are plenty of reasons you might end up pissing in the sink. Toilet not working but still got water in the sink, someone is in the bathroom, that dirty little sink is asking for it, and it's harmless and easy to clean.  I'm not actually a sink pisser myself, I sit to pee, so sink pissing wouldn't be my thing but I have encountered a few in my life, and I have understood the appeal over time.
>>>Its human waste going into the place i clean myself in. If i ever catch someone doing this in my home i will never let them in again
>>>>Well yeah, I believe that generally you should probably pee where pee belongs, and if you want to get up to any sink-pissing activity, you should at least do it in your own house. But just to play devil's advocate for a moment:  Sinks are already connected to the same plumbing as the toilet. They’re designed for wastewater. If you immediately rinse everything down, it's not like pee magically lingers on a molecular level any worse than the germs you're already washing off your hands. People spit out toothpaste, snot, and even vomit and blood into sinks—all of which are ""human waste"" too. The difference is mostly psychological. Fun fact: human saliva actually has more bacteria than urine or feces. Obviously, it's not polite to do it in someone else's house, but if it's your own sink and you clean it afterward, it's honestly not a big deal.

>Brother, just try it- it will be hard to go back to toilet. It will make you wonder why they even built the toilet, then you remember just for a #2. Then you realize the reason your home/ apartment doesn’t have urinals bc it wouldn’t be an efficient build (to have a toilet & urinal) so they build the cheapest option just a toilet. But as you use the sink, you will see it makes way more sense: 1 no more missing 2 no splash back 3 eco friendly (saves water)
>>There will always be splashing. Are you not familiar with the behavior of fluids?
>>>I’m familiar with the ‘behavior’ of fluids. I’m familiar with the splash/mist radius. Some will tell you- sit down to urinate bc of this splash radius. I refuse to urinate sitting down and getting splash/ mist radius on my bottom and scrotal area. When I stand up to urinate over toilet- I feel the splashes on my leg the size of rain drops (Gross I will immediately shower/ rinse off) When I sit down to urinate- I feel like an ex-con or a fem-boy who is ashamed of their jewels. I drink a lot of water. & coffee (knowing it’s a diuretic) so I have to void ALOT. I’m not touching the dirty toilet seat cover or even the handle to the toilet (even if I clean it daily) everytime I have to void. I’m whooping my d** out through the leg of my shorts and voiding in the sink- where believe it or not I don’t feel any splash back.
>>>>""I’m familiar with the ‘behavior’ of fluids."" So you know your use of a lysol wipe is worthless. It doesn't matter what you feel, your piss is everywhere.  Fucking disgusting.

>>For me it’s a question of which sink. If it’s bathroom then why? You have a toilet right there or you’re already in the shower. If it’s kitchen that’s gross, from a food prep perspective, as most people don’t wash them daily. The only sink I can see justifies is a slop sink/ laundry tub.

I’m looking for a hot chocolate that is creamy but not overly thick (I’ve tried Italian hot chocolate but it’s too thick for me, I think French hot chocolate is a better consistency). I also don’t like dark chocolate and most hot chocolates outside are either too bland or too dark/bitter for my liking. 

I use 38% Guittard chocolate wafers or sometimes I mix Ghiradheli semisweet chocolate with 31% Guittard chocolate chips. However, I don’t add ANY sugar to my hot chocolate since the chocolate it already sweet.

The other ingredients are: milk, heavy cream, Dutch-processed cocoa powder, dash of coffee, and a few drops of vanilla extract. Occasionally I’ll add some salt but it doesn’t make a huge difference. 

Any suggestions? 

ALSO: if anyone has any recommendations for semisweet/sweet and creamy high quality hot chocolate around SF/Bay Area I’d love to hear them!

So for context, what I've been doing is for like a week or two depending how long I can push it for I'll have one meal a day. But for that one meal I can literally eat my supper. Have my dessert have fruits? I'm just eating it in one portion and one meal and this has definitely helped shrink my appetite. But closer to my period I'll be eating more.. I'll make sure I have like two meals a day. I'll have my dessert. I'll have the damn donut if I want. I'll have two coffees if I want. I don't restrict myself when I'm in my lutheal phase . Especially considering I have what my doctor said I could have pmdd so everything's way more intense before my period . 

But I don't know how sustainable that is... I find that if I work out all the time and I just eat a certain amount of time or keep my calories even though I don't count it but I roughly try and keep my meals the same. I hit a plateau on my weight loss... But when I do omad for 2 weeks and then I eat normal for 2 weeks. I actually see a difference.. especially with my mental health and my PMDD

But with that being said, sometimes I feel like it may have a little bit more impact than I think.. like for example, my heaviest was 160. I am 4 ft 11. So about 2 weeks ago we'll say 3 weeks I was 136... And then 10 days ago I waited myself when I was 133 which I thought was weird because it kind of dropped really suddenly and I was actually pretty happy about it. Concerning this is my lightest I've been since childbirth... But now I weigh myself again and I'm 136. I'm extremely bloated... I feel like s*** my entire face is used but I am in my lutheal phase .

So I know how much this can have an impact like I start my period next week so but as a woman is omad sustainable.. is it healthy? + I'd like some perspective on women that have a period and their weight. Fluctuating because my weight has actually stopped fluctuating and it stayed pretty solid until this past 2 weeks, which I've been the most stressed. So I don't know if it's like a mixture of that and not eating properly. But I'm definitely the most bloated I've ever been + dieting working out being a woman waiting punctuating really confuses me.. my goal weight is 110 to 115 and I'd like to reach that buy summer.

I was administered Vyvanse for ADHD. Later, I was administered Auvelity for depression. For those who don't know, auvelity is a combination of wellbutrin and dextromethorphan. Around the third time I took it, I felt terrible and went to the ER. The doctors said that the auvelity receptors interacted with the vyvanse, increasing the amount of vyvanse in my body dramatically, resulting in methamphetamine toxicity. 

I was hospitalized for a few days as a result of this. After I was released, I returned to the ER because I continued to have these side effects. My blood pressure and pulse would go up. I couldn't even walk because it would raise my heart rate. I'd get tremors, chills, and i’d sweat a ton. Different regions of my body would burn as well (similar to an icy hot feeling). It's been about three weeks since my discharge. I experienced these symptoms for a while after being discharged, and I had almost every test done; nothing was wrong with me, and the doctors suggested I'd probably simply need to wait it out. 

Waiting it out was the worst feeling i’ve ever went through, I truly felt like I was in agony the entire time. Every symptom has vanished, with the exception that my heart rate remains sensitive for unknown reasons. I can't even perform light activity without my heart rate going up. And for some reason, I'm now having responses to the antihistamines I've been taking to treat my allergies. I'm also quite sensitive to caffeine lately. I haven't had any coffee or Red Bull. I’m just unable to manage a can of Coke. 

I'm not too concerned because the doctors claimed I was fine and my tests all came back with no concern whatsoever, but it's just incredibly frustrating.

So plate in the front,  coffee to the upper right,  silverware to the left etc.   Then I carry it up the stairs and when I get to the person I''m handing it to,   I have to either stop and put it down and turn it around or I hand it to the person and they have to turn the tray around.

She was new and was being bullied by lower management but I sorted it out
She wanted to get to know the new guy so I introduced them

He ended up being a creep and starting harassing her (management did nothing) so I rearranged a holiday so she wouldn't have to be alone with him she also asked to go with me so I changed the rental apparent to a 2 room.

The day before we left the guy that was harassing her had cornered in a room alone, after I'd gone to get coffee, when I returned with coffee she was crying in a corner with him loudly describing the ways he was going to assault her, i intervened and he got violent but i have 20kg and 5 inches on him so it didn't go the way he was hoping (the coffee was lost) he still didn't get disciplined 

About 10 days into the holiday she asked me to help her take a photo in her room, I took the photo, she wasn't happy with the photo and wanted brighter colours to show off the view better so I adjusted the camera settings at the window, when I turned around the shirt she was waring (my shirt from the night before she'd taken from the laundry room) had ""fallen off accidentally"" i told her to but her cloths back on and left, afterwards we had a conversation and I explained that I find her very attractive but I was still a little fucked up from a previous relationship and she was clearly upset still after her boyfriend had dumped her the night before (he found out that i was male and I had no knowledge of his existence. It wasn't the right time or place, but we could revisit it in a month or so. This wasn't the only obvious hint she dropped on the holiday. 

A few months later I had realised I'd been developing feelings and told her, but she told me that she had feelings for someone else and had just started dating someone. so I asked her if we could put some space between us because it wouldn't be healthy to go out every day while she was dating and I had feelings,  she agreed but still texted me continually asking to hang out, I ended up removing her on social media and avoiding her at work because she wouldn't give me space and even became aggressive when I didn't respond to a text she sent at 2am (a friend advised me to do this)

After I removed her on social media she blew up at me at work, verbally attacked a friend of mine, and then blew up at me again, this time in front of management, I told her we couldn't fight at work but we could talk after if she needed to say anything. 
During our talk after work she convinced me to stay friends and still go places after work. (I agreed mostly to keep the peace at work)

Over the next few months we got close again, and started going out after work, but if I spoke to other women she'd go in a mood, sometimes she'd join in the conversation but act like a jealous girlfriend making me look like an arsehole, eventually started suspecting she knew what she was doing and started talking to a mutual friend and flirting a lot, after ex friend found out I was talking to mutual friend she sent mutual friend a 2000 character message saying how much of a great guy I am but to be careful with be because I was already in love and a bunch of other things that made me sound like a crazy person, mutual friend knew it was an experiment and actually showed me this message.

I confronted ex friend with this information and she admitted she did it out of jealousy, so i asked ex friend if she wanted to start dating, she said yes at first but then asked for time to think about it and changed her answer to no because she still had feelings for someone else, not the guy she had been dating a few months prior that guy had been abusive i told her that i needed to go zero contact because i couldn'tstop myself from having feelings for her and she couldn't stop  herself from sabotaging me so the friendship wasn't healthy and needed to end. 

Ex friend took a few months off after getting rejected by the guy she actually likes but has told a few people at work what happened but left out most of the context and it spread around, the women i work with think I'm an arsehole and need to start talking to ex friend again when she returns to work next week

Ex friends stort spread around work uncontested because I also had a month off work, the creep from 6 months ago and his friends got the drop on me so I was off work with a few broken ribs and wrist.

tl;dr the Robot arms are super hard to push down, even putting all my weight on it produces just drips. I've tried even supermarket pre-ground coffee, also got a new grinder (SK40) a few weeks ago.

  
Details:

\- I got my Robot end of December 2024, it's amazing. But after a couple weeks the arms got hard to push down. I greased the seal, that helped but again after a week arms got hard to push

\- I contacted the reseller, Prima Coffee, they blamed fines. There's a prior thread from a year ago that said this too, fair enough as I had an Encore tho I upgraded to m2 burrs.

\- but 2 weeks ago I got a Turin SK40, which while low end has an extremely good reputation for espresso. I have tried grinding extremely coarse (20+), I've used the bellows \*before\* grinding, I have tried 2 kinds of pre-ground supermarket coffee (a Kimbo and a Peet's), I've tried reducing dose to 12g, I've tried just leveling tamp, I've tried the Molykote (just outside as well as inside and outside)

\- I do RDT and WDT, generally use a bottom filter as well as top filter but have tried without too. I've tried short to no pre-infusion, long pre-infusion.

\- The ONLY thing that has worked is throwing everything in the dishwasher -piston seals, portafilter, filter basket- and then 3-4 shots work well, but then the arms get totally stuck again

\- I also spent a lot of time quizzing ChatGPT and Claude and they didn't have much to add

\- and all the other basics eg I make sure the piston seal is seated very evenly, of course facing with the open V side down, I do have more seals on order...

Appreciate any ideas!! :)",0,1745709650.0,CafelatRobot,5,0.5,False

I just remembered like 8 years ago I was in the Levant of the Middle East for a funeral. On the ground, I  saw a really small snake 2 cm thick and like maximum 7 cm long its head was significantly larger than the body, and looked so weird. I have tried finding it on the Internet or anything that looks similar to it, but I couldn’t.

(I’m sure about how it looked like, I wasn’t very young when I saw it.) 
It did have a pattern, overall light brown and had black spots on it ,
It was so small like an old man’s thick finger!

I put it underneath a really small coffee cup and when my dad came, I showed it to him and it slithered away.
I cannot describe how small and weird it looked maybe even deformed.

Does anyone have any idea what it might have been?

sometimes I don't know if I'm meeting up with actual human beings or if I accidentally walked into a networking event organized by LinkedIn.
1. people are making their jobs their whole personality, and not just that they are trying so hard to make it sound more meaningful and interesting than it actually is. you all calm down it's doesn’t need to be that deep 

just chill you bitches, no need to perform, let’s just try have a good time 

2. tbh nobody cares about your tech job or any other job, and please stop talking like you're in a slack conference room i don’t want even type the word pitch.

 find a personality that doesn’t revolve around your all day in front screen job, where you sit in your pajamas for eight hours a day, making nonsense team calls, and being low key disrespected by a stupid rude manager. 

//don’t take me wrong good for you for being able to support yourself with your job, but for the god’s sake not all socialization is a networking event or a pitch presentation 

3. the aesthetic cafe (and all other shit) bitches are killing me. going to overpriced cafes, posting your dry pastries and mediocre coffee mug doesn’t make you an interesting person. we consume an average of 78 billion pictures per day (source: voices of my tormented mind) do you really think someone cares? repeat after me: nobody cares 
take a deep breath 
exhale 
nobody cares it’s fine 
actually it’s great 

4. trying hard to be interesting is worse than just being basic there is literally nothing wrong with being basic if you own it. in fact, embracing it makes you way more authentic

it's okay to admit you don't have anything exciting going on. we’re all tired. we’re all performing. honesty is so refreshing
 
again just chill out 

talking about exciting stuff 

5. traveling doesn't make you more interesting, especially when you only go to the same predictable pinterest board destinations, and the same tourist traps for pictures, and come home with the same shallow cultural insights 

nobody cares about that ""charming little cafe in PaRiS” or your matcha or whatever 

you know what’s more interesting and cultured? travel back home for the holiday and ruin Thanksgiving by yelling at your racist uncle and throwing the whole family into chaos 

we want to hear chaos. hardships. unhinged shit
or just ordinary daily life activities with a good humor storytelling 

things that actually make you interesting:

* having (or at least trying) a life outside of work
* embracing your basic bitch/dude energy 
* humor
* unhinged but harmless interests or behavior
* spilling the tea: family, date and roommate drama, workplace gossip, delusional conspiracy theories you made up having your own ass as a source

we really don’t want to hear about your generative AI project

i love when a nurse friend tells us crazy stories from her late-night shifts at the hospital, like an emergency case where they had to remove a cylindrical object from a dude’s ass AND he was wearing a thong 

that’s the kinda of story that gives you credibility

it’s okay not to prove you’re smart and a functional adult all the time  

 an example of someone interesting:
Lana Del Rey, who got married out of the blue in an empty parking lot in Louisiana to an alligator tour guide. i'd happily pay $14 for an overpriced dry croissant just to hear that story in full.

to end this bullshit 

friendship nowadays are transactional

people only hang out with clones of themselves.
i know we all naturally vibe with people who are similar, but you gotta expand your circle. 
connect with people who aren’t in your same social, economic, or cultural bubble, otherwise your social life will continue to be as plain and predictable as a corporate’s Slack channel.
nobody wants to do boring, real-life shit with their friends anymore.
we all need friends to go run boring errands with us or doing absolutely nothingat each other’s place without spending money or making it an event?

nobody just chills anymore
because now even friendship has to be high-performance. if it’s not offering networking opportunities or some bullshit benefit, people don’t think it’s worth their time.

and don’t tell me you don’t have time because adulthood, work, and bullshit

I know you spend hours mindlessly scrolling or searching for shit to buy

we are all just becoming hopelessly narcissistic, self-absorbed, materialistic, and performative machines who don’t even bother to put effort into real HUMAN connection, yet lie by saying that we love connecting with people

It's a tropical paradise, no doubt about it! But for families, choosing the *best all inclusive resorts in Cancun, Mexico for families* can feel a bit like navigating a massive buffet – so many tantalizing options, where do you even start? You want ease, you want entertainment for the kiddos, you want relaxation for you (yes, *you*!), and you definitely want value. It’s a tall order, but thankfully, Cancun delivers. I’ve done some digging, asked around, and even experienced a few of these gems firsthand, and let me tell you, narrowing it down is tough, but oh-so-rewarding when you find that perfect fit. This article is all about helping you skip the decision fatigue and zoom in on the spots that truly shine for families, making your next Cancun getaway a cherished memory, not a logistical nightmare.

Cancun: The Family Vacation Holy Grail?
---------------------------------------

Cancun. Just the name rolls off the tongue with a certain sparkle, doesn't it? It's synonymous with vacation, relaxation, and most importantly, for families, *fun*. Why is Cancun such a perennial favorite for those traveling with little ones, teenagers, or even multi-generational groups? Well, for starters, the accessibility is fantastic. Direct flights from tons of major cities make getting there a breeze. No grueling layovers with restless kids – win! Then there's the sheer variety of activities. Beyond the resorts themselves, you've got ancient Mayan ruins, vibrant underwater worlds for snorkeling and diving, thrilling eco-parks, and enough shopping and dining to keep everyone happy. And of course, the all-inclusive model in Cancun is perfected. It's not just about meals and drinks; it's about built-in entertainment, kids clubs that are actually *good*, and a sense of security that allows parents to truly unplug, at least for a little while. So, is Cancun the family vacation holy grail? For many, it absolutely is. It ticks a lot of boxes, offering that sought-after blend of convenience, excitement, and opportunities for both connection and individual exploration. It’s a place where sandy toes and happy faces are practically guaranteed.

### Why All-Inclusive is the Smart Choice for Families in Cancun

Okay, let's be real. Traveling with family, especially with kids in tow, involves a lot of logistics. So much planning! What are we eating? Where are we going? Do we have enough snacks? This is where the all-inclusive model truly shines, particularly in a destination like Cancun. Imagine this: you arrive, you check in, and pretty much everything is covered. The meals? Included. The drinks (yes, even those fancy poolside cocktails for you)? Included. Entertainment? Included. Kids' activities? Included. It dramatically simplifies the vacation experience, eliminating those constant little decisions and worries that can add up and steal precious relaxation time. No more fumbling for cash at every restaurant, no more debating ""is this snack worth it?"" It's all part of the package. This frees you up to focus on what really matters: making memories with your family. Parents can truly unwind knowing the kids are entertained and safe, and the budget is largely set from the get-go, avoiding those painful end-of-trip surprise bills. Seriously, for a family trip, opting for all-inclusive in Cancun just makes sense. It’s a stress-reducing superpower in vacation form!

### What Families *Really* Need in an All-Inclusive Resort

When you're shelling out for an all-inclusive family vacation, you're not just paying for a room and some food. You're paying for an *experience*, and one that caters to the unique needs of families. What does that actually look like in practice? Well, it goes beyond just having a pool. Kids need more than just water to splash in!

Here's what families *really* need in an all-inclusive Cancun resort:

- **Outstanding Kids' Clubs:** This is non-negotiable. A good kids' club isn't just a room with some toys; it's a vibrant, engaging space with trained staff who offer age-appropriate activities throughout the day. Think crafts, games, movie nights, maybe even themed parties. It's a place where kids actually *want* to go, giving parents a precious hour (or two!) of adult time.
- **Multiple Pool Options:** A kiddie pool is essential, but so are pools with slides, splash pads, and perhaps a quieter pool for when the little ones are napping or the older kids want to chill. Variety keeps things interesting.
- **Diverse Dining:** While buffets are convenient, having a few a la carte options keeps meal times from getting monotonous. Family-friendly hours and menus are key. Picky eaters? Absolutely. Having options that cater to different tastes is a lifesaver.
- **On-Site Entertainment:** Evening shows, live music, pool games, maybe even a mini-golf course or a climbing wall. Activities that everyone can enjoy together or that provide a fun distraction are a huge plus.
- **Safe and Secure Grounds:** Parents need to feel confident letting their older kids explore a bit on their own within the resort property. Good security and well-maintained grounds are crucial.
- **Kid-Friendly Amenities:** Things like cribs readily available, high chairs in restaurants, maybe even strollers for rent. These seemingly small details make a big difference in reducing parental stress.
- **Beach Access with Calm Water:** While Cancun beaches are generally gorgeous, some areas have calmer water than others, which is much safer and more enjoyable for young children. Look for resorts with a more protected stretch of sand.

These are the things that elevate a good family resort to a *great* one. They are the little touches and thoughtful considerations that make parents feel supported and allow everyone to truly relax and have fun.

Get ready to picture yourselves lounging by the pool, margarita in hand, while the kids are happily entertained. It’s within reach!

### Hyatt Ziva Cancun: Where Fun is a Family Affair

Imagine a resort that feels like a little village, with different areas designed to cater to different moods and age groups. That's the vibe at Hyatt Ziva Cancun. It's not just one big building; it’s a sprawling property with multiple pools, including a fantastic adults-only pool (a godsend!), and a fantastic kids' pool area. The location is a huge selling point too – nestled right on the tip of the Hotel Zone peninsula, it's surrounded by water on three sides, offering stunning views and access to both the calmer waters of the bay side (perfect for little swimmers!) and the more active Caribbean side. This resort really leans into the ""family fun"" aspect with energy and enthusiasm.

They have a truly impressive array of activities and amenities tailored for families:

- **Dolphin Habitat:** Yes, you read that right! Hyatt Ziva has its own dolphin habitat, offering interactive experiences (for an additional fee). While this is a debated topic for some, it's an undeniable draw for many families looking for unique animal encounters.

- **Three Infinity Pools:** Including one specifically for adults and a large main pool with plenty of space for splashing and playing.
- **Family-Friendly Rooms:** Many room categories are designed with families in mind, offering extra space or connecting options.

What I really like about Hyatt Ziva is the energy. There’s always something happening – pool games, live music, evening shows, you name it. It feels vibrant and alive, which is perfect for families who want a lot of stimulation and activity. It’s truly a place where everyone in the family can find something they love to do. They've thought about the different needs of a family unit and created spaces and activities that cater to each one, ensuring that everyone's vacation is enjoyable and memorable. And hey, happy kids usually mean happy parents, right?

### Moon Palace Cancun: A Mega-Resort with Mega-Fun for Families

It’s the kind of place where you could spend a week and still not experience everything it has to offer. This is a fantastic option for families who crave variety and don't mind a larger, more active resort environment. With multiple sections, each with its own pools, restaurants, and amenities, it caters to different paces, but the overarching theme is definitely fun, fun, fun! If your family thrives on constant activity and a plethora of options, Moon Palace is likely to be a strong contender.

Here's why Moon Palace is a family favorite:

- **Water Parks and FlowRider:** This is a massive draw! Moon Palace boasts not one, but often multiple, impressive water park areas with slides and splash zones. Plus, they have a FlowRider, where you can try your hand at surfing. Guaranteed to get the adrenaline pumping for older kids and teens.
- **Wired Lounge:** A dedicated teen lounge with video games, arcades, and activities – a perfect escape for the ""too cool for the kids' club"" crowd.

While the size can be a little overwhelming for some, the sheer volume of amenities and entertainment ensures there’s always something new to discover. It really is a mini-city dedicated to vacation fun. And for families with varied interests, this sprawling resort truly delivers.

### Beaches and Beyond: Activities that Make Cancun Shine for Families

While the resorts themselves offer a treasure trove of activities, part of the magic of choosing Cancun for your family vacation is the incredible range of experiences available *outside* the resort walls. Getting out and exploring is key to a well-rounded trip, and Cancun offers some truly unforgettable family adventures. It’s not just about the sun and sand, though those are certainly fantastic!

Consider these family-friendly excursions and activities:

- **Chichen Itza:** Visiting this iconic Mayan ruin is a fascinating history lesson come to life. While it can be a hot day trip, it's an incredibly rewarding experience for older kids and teens interested in history and ancient civilizations. Look for tours that are tailored for families.
- **Exploring Cenotes:** These natural swimming holes are a highlight of the Yucatan Peninsula. Many cenotes are perfect for swimming and snorkeling, offering a refreshing and unique experience. Some even have zip lines or platforms for jumping in!
- **Xcaret, Xel-Há, and Other Eco-Parks:** These adventure parks are fantastic for a full day of family fun. Xcaret offers a blend of nature, culture, and adventure with underground rivers, animal encounters, and traditional Mexican performances. Xel-Há is a natural aquarium perfect for snorkeling and swimming. There are several other parks too, each with its own focus, offering everything from zip-lining and ATV rides to exploring caves.
- **Isla Mujeres Day Trip:** A short ferry ride away, Isla Mujeres is a charming island that offers a more laid-back vibe. Rent a golf cart to explore, relax on the beautiful beaches, and visit the turtle sanctuary. It’s a lovely change of pace from the energy of the Hotel Zone.
- **Snorkeling and Diving:** The waters around Cancun are teeming with marine life. Taking a snorkeling or beginner diving tour is a magical experience for families who love being in the water. The Cancun Underwater Museum (MUSA) is a unique spot to snorkel over submerged sculptures.
- **Shopping at La Isla Shopping Village:** An outdoor mall with canals and bridges, offering a pleasant shopping experience and plenty of dining options.

""Save up to 90% on flights with these amazing deals: https://educdunet.com/""

Integrating some of these experiences into your trip adds depth and creates lasting memories beyond just the resort activities. They provide opportunities to learn, explore, and see more of the beautiful Yucatan region. Just remember to plan ahead, especially with younger kids, to ensure the excursions are age-appropriate and not too tiring.

### Family Dining: More Than Just the Buffet

Eating is a big part of any vacation, right? And when you're traveling with family, especially with picky eaters (is there a family without one?!), the dining options at your all-inclusive resort become even more critical. While the convenience of a buffet with something for everyone is undeniable, having a variety of dining experiences elevates the trip from good to great. The best all inclusive resorts in Cancun Mexico for families understand this and go beyond just the basic buffet.

Look for resorts that offer:

- **A la Carte Restaurants with Kid-Friendly Menus:** While the main menu might be a bit too adventurous for some little palates, having a dedicated kids' menu at the specialty restaurants is a lifesaver. It allows the adults to enjoy a nicer meal while the kids are still happy.
- **Casual poolside or beachside grills:** Perfect for quick and easy lunches when you don't want to change out of your swimsuits. Tacos, burgers, and other casual fare are usually crowd-pleasers.
- **Snack Stations Throughout the Day:** Ice cream carts, pastry shops, coffee bars – having access to snacks and treats between meals keeps everyone happy and avoids those inevitable ""I'm hungry!"" meltdowns.
- **Early Dining Hours:** Many resorts offer earlier dinner sittings at some restaurants, which is perfect for families with young children who eat dinner earlier.
- **Room Service:** A tired kid (or parent!) can really benefit from being able to order food to the room. It’s a convenient option for those times when getting everyone ready for a restaurant feels like too much work.
- **Nutritional Information or Options:** For families with allergies or dietary restrictions, resorts that are knowledgeable and accommodating are invaluable.

The difference between a resort with just a main buffet and one with a diverse range of dining experiences is significant. It allows for more flexibility, caters to different preferences, and makes meal times something to look forward to rather than a potential source of stress. It’s those little details that truly make an all-inclusive family vacation feel seamless and enjoyable.

### Keeping the Teens Happy: A Challenge Worth Conquering

Ah, the teenage years. That magical time when they're too old for the kids' club but maybe not quite ready to hang out with the adults all the time. Keeping teens entertained on a family vacation can feel like a monumental task sometimes. They crave independence, social interaction with peers, and activities that feel cool and engaging, not childish. The best all inclusive resorts in Cancun Mexico for families recognize this and have specific amenities and programs designed to appeal to this often-underserved age group.

Here's what works for teens:

- **Dedicated Teen Lounges:** A space where they can just *be*, away from the little kids and the adults. These lounges often have video games, pool tables, air hockey, comfortable seating, and a generally relaxed vibe. It's their space.
- **Age-Appropriate Activities:** Resort activities like beach volleyball tournaments, basketball, non-motorized water sports (kayaking, paddleboarding), and maybe introductory scuba diving lessons can be big hits.
- **Evening Events:** Teen-specific evening events like bonfires on the beach, pizza parties, or movie nights under the stars offer opportunities for socialization.
- **Wi-Fi!:** Seriously, this is crucial. Good, reliable Wi-Fi is essential for teens to stay connected with their friends back home and share their vacation experiences (filtered, of course!).
- **Opportunities for Independence:** Allowing teens to explore certain areas of the resort on their own (within safety parameters, of course) gives them a sense of freedom they crave.
- **Cool Pools:** Pools with features like swim-up bars (serving non-alcoholic drinks!), wave pools, or areas with music can appeal to the teen crowd.

Resorts that consciously cater to teens by providing dedicated spaces and activities really make a difference. It shows they understand the importance of making the entire family happy, even the sometimes-hard-to-please teenagers. When teens have their own outlets for fun and socialization, it reduces friction within the family and makes for a more enjoyable trip for everyone.

Beyond the Beach: Wellness and Relaxation for the Grown-Ups
-----------------------------------------------------------

Let's not forget about the adults! While keeping the kids happy is a top priority, a family vacation should also offer opportunities for parents to relax and rejuvenate. After all, you're the ones who organized everything! The best all inclusive resorts in Cancun Mexico for families find that sweet spot between providing endless fun for the kids and offering moments of tranquility and indulgence for the grown-ups. It's about finding that balance.

Here's what parents should look for:

- **Adults-Only Areas:** An adults-only pool or section of the beach is a game-changer. A quiet space where you can read a book without being splashed, or enjoy a peaceful dip is invaluable.
- **Spa Services:** A spa on-site is a luxurious treat. Whether it’s a massage, a facial, or just some time in a hydrotherapy pool, a little pampering can melt away stress.
- **Adults-Only Dining Options:** Sometimes, a quiet dinner with just your partner is exactly what you need. Resorts that have a few restaurants that are adults-only in the evenings offer this much-needed opportunity.
- **Fitness Facilities:** If staying active is part of your routine, a well-equipped gym or fitness classes can help you maintain your wellness goals even on vacation.
- **Bars and Lounges with Calm Ambiance:** While some bars might be lively and loud, having a few quieter spots for an evening cocktail and conversation is a nice option.
- **Room Service (Again!):** Sometimes, the most relaxing thing is simply ordering in and enjoying a quiet meal on your balcony after the kids are asleep.

A family-friendly resort doesn't mean sacrificing adult relaxation. The best ones understand that for the family as a whole to be happy, the parents need some downtime too. Look for those added touches that cater specifically to adults, allowing you to recharge and truly feel like you're on *vacation*, not just a trip supervising children in a different location!

So, you’ve booked your perfect family-friendly all-inclusive in Cancun. Now what? To truly make the most of your trip, a little pre-planning and a flexible mindset go a long way. It’s about optimizing your experience to ensure maximum fun and minimal stress. Remember, even at an all-inclusive, you hold the reins on how you spend your time.

Here are some tips for maximizing your experience:

- **Download the Resort App:** Many resorts have their own apps that provide schedules for activities, restaurant hours, maps, and sometimes even the ability to make reservations. It’s a great way to stay informed and plan your day.
- **Book Popular Restaurants in Advance:** If the resort takes reservations for their à la carte restaurants, make them as soon as you can, especially if you're traveling during peak season. The most popular spots book up quickly.
- **Familiarize Yourself with the Resort Layout:** Upon arrival, take a moment to get your bearings. Know where the main pools, kids' club, restaurants, and key amenities are located. This saves time and prevents wandering aimlessly with impatient kids.
- **Check the Daily Activity Schedule:** Resorts publish a daily calendar of events. Look it over each morning and highlight the activities that appeal to your family. Be flexible, but having an idea of what’s happening helps you plan your day.
- **Pack Smart:** Beyond the usual tropical essentials, consider packing things like inflatable pool toys (some resorts sell them, but bringing your own can be cheaper), a small first-aid kit, and any specific snacks or comfort items your kids might need.
- **Utilize the Kids' Club:** Don't feel guilty about dropping the kids off at the kids' club! It's there for a reason. Use that time to relax by the adults-only pool, have a quiet lunch, or enjoy a spa treatment.
- **Embrace the All-Inclusive Concept:** Don't feel like you have to pay extra for everything. Take advantage of the included activities, food, and drinks. That's why you chose all-inclusive in the first place!
- **Stay Hydrated:** The Cancun sun is no joke! Drink plenty of water throughout the day, and encourage your kids to do the same.
- **Apply Sunscreen Religiously:** Protect your family’s skin by applying and reapplying sunscreen frequently.
- **Be Flexible and Go with the Flow:** Things don't always go exactly as planned, especially with kids. Be prepared to adjust your plans and embrace the unexpected. A relaxed parent usually means relaxed kids.

1k8pqv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/sterileprocessing/comments/1k8pqv2/would_i_be_a_decent_fit/,Would I be a decent fit?,"Hello! Im looking into sterile processing training and the career as a whole, but i had some questions i wanted to ask before committing to anything. I know every facility is going to differ, but i wanted to get some honest opinions about the reality of the job. For some context im 25F and live in Central NC, im also autistic and have CPTSD, and have always struggled with jobs. I worked for almost a year at an animal shelter before being let go, and spent some time as a print specialist in a retail store before i had a breakdown due to my own mental health as well as management issues at the job. Prior, ive worked summers in coffee shops, but ive always struggled greatly with customer facing positions.

One of my biggest concerns is the expectation of speed as an SPT. My autism is medically diagnosed, so i would possibly be able to get accomodations, but aside from that i am worried. At my print job, even when i worked myself until my feet gave out, i wasn't considered to be working fast enough because i struggled to multitask between printing, the customer desk, a returns desk, and self print areas. Depending on the facility, would there be that expectation of essentially running from station to station, if that makes sense?

How much time is actually spent on ones feet? I have some minor medical issues that make it painful for me to stand for more than an hour or two at once, even with supportive shoes. Is there generally some time where you can work from a chair? Im sure with the different machines and processes, a person would be moving around a bit, but perhaps during sorting and packing?

Do neurodivergent people generally do alright in this job? I know every person is different, but is the environment somewhat welcoming/accepting at least? For me personally, i dont talk much and keep to myself, with headphones if i can, and i have colored hair and tattoos. Especially in NC, ive had issues with coworkers being accepting/just not assholes in general. My prior job left me with major trust issues with management and coworkers, so i dont see myself really getting close to anyone or anything. Im also, admittedly, not a morning person at all, but im sure i could learn to adjust if i had to.

Are the shifts generally 10-12 hours like i have been seeing? I struggle a bit with doing anything for such a long time, would there potentially be options for shorter shifts?

Ive struggled a lot with my autism and finding a job that i can tolerate, but SPT seems promising, at least on the surface. While im working on getting disability, i dont have a lot of faith in the system, especially right now. But im worried about investing the money into the program, only for me to enter the job and find out i cant handle it. I hope i dont come off as too needy or whining here, i just have seen what happens to me when i put myself into jobs i cant truly manage, and i dont want that to happen again. Thank you for any advice.",2,1745708819.0,sterileprocessing,1,1.0,False

The saloon was filled with the sounds of clinking glasses, rough laughter, and the steady hum of chatter, but at Dumont's table, a tense silence clung to the air like smoke from the cigar she clenched between her teeth. Her gaze was steady, her eyes sharp as a hawk's, analyzing the three men across from her. These weren't the regular cowboys of humble fortune; they were the wild, cocksure rough-riders from the west side of town, returning to the table for revenge after being so soundly beaten before.

This section of the room buzzed with anticipation, several onlookers aware that the stakes were sky-high, both in currency and reputation. Mustache’ was unyielding in her mastery, her fingers flicking the cards with a dexterity that seemed born from countless nights spent under similar circumstances. Time had slipped away, unnoticed hour by hour, the pile of chips in front of her grew, and the looks of desperation etched deeper into her opponents' faces. By the time the saloon moved to its closing hour, she’d divested them of half their earnings, leaving them bitter and disillusioned for the second time.

Once the game dispersed, and her triumph celebrated by several of her fellow patrons, with a whoop and holler, Madam Mustache” stood up and walked to the bar.  
“Drinks on me,” she said as the celebration in her honor began.

As the evening deepened, Mustache’ bid farewell to her companions at the Sam Leon, staggering into the night with a jaunty tune on her lips—a melody spun from the joy of her easily-won triumph. The wooden boardwalk groaned under her footsteps as she made her way home, the whisper of the night cloaking her in mystery. Yet, lurking in the shadows, the men nursed their grudges like smoldering embers, waiting for the opportune moment to lash out.

Near the abandoned bank—an imposing silhouette against the star-strewn sky—the gamblers sprung their trap. Rough hands snatched her, muffling her song and dragging her into the alley’s throat of darkness. Brutal fists fell, addressed with malice and hate, nearly sending her into oblivion.  
“Think you’re so smart you fuckin’ cunt.” A voice said

These men, born of frontier cruelty, sought more than mere recompense—intending wickedness sought more than just compensation, using their knives to cut through her clothing, extracting gold nuggets from Mustache’s trousers with a greedy gleam in their eyes.  
Moments later their intentions were cut short. Fate, in its unpredictable mercy, called upon a guardian from the night, a spectral form with the swiftness of a cougar.

Frank Bodie materialized from the obsidian depths of the darkness, a nightmare for those unfortunate to meet him as an enemy or a victim of his craving. With a ferocity that stunned even his foes, he dispatched two with the ease of tossing aside rag dolls one after the other crashing to walls and the ground. The third, gripping Madam’s wrist, gawked wide-eyed up at the towering savior.

“Turn over her money, and I’ll let ya walk outta here—this time,” Bodie rumbled, his voice cold as a mountain stream. The desperado, hands shaking in terrified accord, relinquished his spoils before scurrying off, leaving his fallen comrades.  
“Have you made a decision?” Frank Bodie said to the other two.

Both men barely able to stand, stumbled away as quickly as possible.  
As his presence was about to dissolve back into the night’s embrace, Madam Mustache’, her awareness returning, fixed her gaze upon his shadow.  
“I have seen you around... Didn’t I clean you out at cards once?”  
She knew his silhouette turned as she saw the unworldly glow in his eyes. She froze, gripped by a fascination that overpowered fear, before drawing a deep breath, the air heavy with foreboding.

“Cards ain’t my game,” Frank replied.  
“Seems it isn’t theirs either.” He added  
Steadying herself, she brushed off the dust, her indomitable spirit unbroken.  
“Thanks for your bit,” she offered, a nod of appreciation punctuating her words.  
“You’ll be alright?” he asked.  
“I’ve weathered worse,” she assured, a roguish grin hinting at her resilience.  
“How about your name, stranger?”  
“The name’s Frank,” he said, his voice carrying the weight of unspoken stories as he continued his shadowy departure.  
“Frank what?” she prodded, intrigued by the mystery.  
“Don’t matter much,” he responded, already a ghost in the night. “Just Frank.”  
With her newfound knowledge, she whispered it to herself like a talisman against future darkness. “Bodie, Frank Bodie.” The night swallowed her voice, leaving only the quiet rustle of the wind as it carried the tale of her encounter—the woman known as Madam Mustache’, unbeaten in spirit, watched over by the enigmatic protector of the twilight.  
“See you around.” His voice carried in the darkness.  
“See you around.” She said quietly.

The Magnolia Saloon was cloaked in a soft, shadowy glow, with just a few locals spread out across the room. Madame Mustache' and the miners, aka, The Magnolia Regulars were engrossed in their first card game of the early night, enjoying a momentary respite from the turmoil outside. Not long ago, Frank Bodie had wiped out the whole Calvera Clan minutes earlier, and the uncanny silence that now blanketed the streets spoke volumes about his success. Madame Mustache, with a hint of a smile, reached for her whiskey, ready to dive back into the familiar refuge of drink and chance.  
Moments later, the body of Antonio Calvera came crashing through the swinging double doors, landing in a heap. Calvera rolled around in agony as the sound of boots crunching along the boardwalk drew closer. Calvera rolled over, struggling to get to his knees.  
Mustache’ took a shot of whiskey before taking a drag from her cigar.  
“Well, well, who do we have here? She quipped.  
“How are you feeling Mr. Calvera? We got an extra chair right here.”  
Laughter rippled through the patrons as Calvera grimaced, acutely aware of his predicament.  
Moments later the large figure known as Frank Bodie pushed his way through the swinging doors. He reached down and scooped up Calvera off the floor, dragging him to a dark corner of the room and unceremoniously dropping him into a chair before settling in next to him. He produced a cigar from his jacket, which he lit with a candle from the table. He took a slow, deliberate puff before releasing a cloud of smoke into the air.  
“What’s your poison?  
Huh? Calvera sat there confused, trying to find his voice.  
“Whiskey? Tequila?  
Calvera sat there for a moment unable to speak. Finally, murmuring out Tequila.  
Mary Anderson, the stalwart matron of the Magnolia, stood behind the long oak bar with an air of composed unease. She knew what was eventually going to happen. The cards had been dealt and the hand was stacked against Calvera. He would likely meet his fate inside these walls. But Mary had to let it go regardless of how she felt, that was her debt to him. Mary, known among the folks as Mary ""Divine,"" bore an untarnished grace with her demeanor, a soothing balm amid rough winds and hard men. Over time, Mary inherited the Magnolia, a sanctuary under the canopy of rough-hewn timbers and flickering lantern light, bequeathed by her late parents. Her reputation echoed through the east side of town like a clear and steady song.

Along with Mustache and the Regulars, she was Frank Bodie’s closest ally. He saved her as a child when her family was part of a small wagon train headed west to Bodie when a group of brigands attempted an onslaught on the frontiersmen while looking to have their way with the women of this small wagon train. At least that was the plan until the large figure emerged from the darkness like a guardian of the underworld and massacred eighty percent of the hellions.

As time went on a bond with Mary would also grow, finding himself having to watch over her years after the Anderson family settled in Bodie. Yet, with Mary's coming of age, an unspoken danger seeped into the air, like a wolf lurking at the edges of a flickering campfire, as local ruffians began to circle, drawn by her beauty. They sought to claim her, but Frank's shadowy figure always intervened, her guardian in the night, solidifying their irrevocable connection against whatever storms fate conjured. Mary was a bloom in the rough town but despite the admiration from the locals, the townsfolk kept their distance from the Magnolia. Frank was being labeled as a so-called protector, but several locals smelled the danger in his aura, and his reputation was growing past the town’s saloons.

But Mary's loyalty ran deep as the roots of the Jeffrey Pines lining the forgotten trails; Bodie had galloped through the barricades of fate, solidifying that bond she dared not betray.  
She sauntered over to Bodie and Calvera, her eyes shimmering with a hint of Compassion as she cradled two bottles - one the spirit of whiskey, the other a vessel of tequila. She placed them on the table, the clinking of glass a subtle soundtrack to the tension that hung in the air. Madame Mustache' glanced over, her gaze a mixture of curiosity and caution.

""Forever the desperado, driven by a restless spirit and an unyielding need to carve your mark into the rugged landscape,” Mary remarked  
Her eyes narrowed now with disdain. Calvera, trembling, couldn't find his words as Bodie drew a large knife from his coat, the glint of the blade unnerving.

""What'll it be?"" Bodie's voice was low and steady, the calm before the storm.  
Calvera, a man who feared none, often pondered the day he'd meet his match in a duel of lead and gunpowder, yet anticipated it with stoic acceptance. He had no problem looking at death in the face, but today was different, this was no man. He knew for a fact he was some otherworldly creature, as the flashes of unnatural glowing eyes confirmed it. Now, for the first time in his life, he found himself begging and offering terms of surrender, his voice carrying an uncharacteristic tremor. He was promising to leave and never return, but Bodie dismissed him with a violent backhand.  
""Shut up,"" Bodie growled.  
""You had your chance. Now we drink.""  
Calvera, defeated, took the shot glass with shaky hands, downing the tequila in one desperate gulp. Mary refilled his glass, and he drank again, his body shivering with fear.  
""Who are you?"" Calvera finally managed to muster. Bodie leaned back, the whiskey coursing through his veins, and ignited a cigar.  
Mary turned to Madame Mustache' at the card table, her voice a respite from the tension.  
""For most in this room, it doesn't matter. Eleanor, ready for another round?""  
Madame Mustache' gestured calmly, needing no further distraction from the intensity of the card game. ""Momentarily, Mary. Momentarily.""  
Bodie, his eyes hidden beneath the shadow of his hat, took a swig from the bottle before responding to Calvera's question.  
""Someone who doesn't appreciate being stirred from his slumber,"" Bodie replied cryptically.  
“But it was time. I was getting thirsty.”  
Mary reappeared with a bucket and placed it discreetly by Bodie's side. As Calvera drank himself into oblivion, the bucket awaited its purpose—an unspoken reminder of the dark forces on this side.  
At that moment, Mary stood by Bodie's side, her support somewhat questionable as she poured another shot of tequila. The saloon fell into an uneasy silence, the sense of impending reckoning palpable.

It had been just over an hour since Frank Bodie and Calvera, now a drunken and terrified fool, commenced their bender. Calvera, still reeling from the shocking events he had witnessed—events in which he had been an active participant—could scarcely believe what his eyes had seen.  
""We shot you, at least four or five times. Yet, you sit here before me, alive,"" he stammered, his voice still tinged with disbelief.

Mary, who stood attentively at the bar, offered a glimmer of solace.  
""Perhaps your eyes were deceived by the whirlwind of chaos,"" she suggested.  
Calvera shook his head, his countenance reflecting his confusion.  
""No, senorita. I saw it, with my own eyes. I beheld the impossible.""  
Bodie shot Calvera a terse warning glance, a silent command to halt his probing questions.  
""Cease your prattle. Another round.""  
Mary approached the table and levered her gaze at Calvera while extending a bottle of tequila to quell the rising tension.  
“Men like you ride in with your little armies, thinking you own the earth beneath your boots, not understanding the forces that have taken residence here.... One of those forces is sitting right next to you” Bodie, with seasoned expertise, retrieved another cigar from his coat pocket and ignited it, casting an unwavering gaze upon his drinking partner.  
Intrigued by the mystery unraveling before him, Calvera's insatiable curiosity overcame his senses. ""Enlighten me... from whence do you hail?"" he implored.  
Mary's discomposure was etched upon her visage, sensing the inevitable that awaited this man. She regarded Calvera with an air of unease and replied,  
""It matters not. It’s a place unknown to you, and shall remain so.""  
Bodie slammed down an empty bottle, demanding more libations from Calvera. The intoxicated man obligingly downed two more shots before proclaiming, ""No más!""  
""You inebriated, Calvera?"" Bodie questioned, his tone laced with skepticism.  
""Si... no more,"" Calvera slurred, succumbing to the intoxicating effects of the potent liquor.  
Yet, even in his drunken stupor, the vampire within Bodie awakened, its insatiable thirst rising to prominence. He adored whiskey, but nothing sated his cravings like the taste of blood. And now, the moment was nigh.  
""Very well, I am still parched,"" Bodie declared resolutely.  
Mary, recognizing that the time had come for Calvera's life to be extinguished, discreetly shifted her focus elsewhere. The Regulars and Madame Mustache', in tacit understanding, stood, walked over, and positioned themselves at the saloon's entrance, their presence barring any unsolicited intruders.  
Bodie reached for the bucket and placed it on the edge of the table, intended for a grisly purpose. Seizing Calvera by his unkempt hair, Bodie jerked his body forward, the glint of a large blade glimmering menacingly at his throat.  
""No, por favor, no..."" Calvera, now pleading desperately for mercy.  
""That is precisely what the innocent begged for in the face of your merciless hand,"" Bodie sneered.  
With a swift, decisive motion, Bodie slit Calvera's throat, the crimson flow cascading into the awaiting bucket. As the life ebbed away from Calvera's body, Bodie released his perilous grip, allowing the lifeless form to slump upon the table.  
Young Patrick, an unwitting observer of this macabre scene, reappeared moments later, carrying a coffee pot, silently sliding it across the table towards Bodie, his actions wordlessly conveying a somber understanding.  
Mary, her discomfort mounting with each passing moment, approached Bodie with a plaintive urgency. ""We need to take these grim affairs with greater discretion. We never know who may enter through that door, Frank... Haines has got it in for you, I think you’ve noticed”  
Dipping the coffee pot into the blood-filled bucket, Bodie filled his shot glass with the thick, crimson liquid. He poured himself a shot, savoring its taste with a dark satisfaction.

Though familiar with the grim spectacle, Mary always turned her gaze away as the large vampire drained the life from his victims. An insistent unease hung around her like a shadow. She held no regret for the vile men Frank Bodie sacrificed in her saloon, yet the brutality unfolding compelled her to look away like a warning whispered on the wind.

“And after tonight,"" Mary implored, her voice tinged with trepidation,  
""you must find another place for these activities, far removed from the sanctuary of this saloon.”      She had glimpsed the duality of his essence—on one fateful night, a predator of the shadows tearingthrough the sinewy resolve of an unfortunate outlaw, and the next, a silent sentinel ensuring the safe passage of a lone damsel making her way home beneath the indifferent stars. Deep in her bones, she knew that without Frank's dark, watchful presence, her life would have been snuffed out like a candle long before its time. At times she was but a leaf upon the winds of fate, and Frank shielded her from a far more merciless tempest.

Several hours had passed since the savage slaughter of the Calvera Clan, the moon cast a pale glow over the ghostly town of Bodie, as the Magnolia Regulars silently carried out their solemn task. The bodies of Calvera's men lay scattered on the dusty ground, their lifeless forms a gruesome reminder of the violence that had recently plagued the town. With each body thrown onto the flatbed wagons, the men spoke in hushed tones, aware of possible enemies listening that loomed. They chose who they would ally with in this town, they were not fools, and they knew one thing Frank was not: human.

As the last body was loaded onto the wagon, the Regulars began their journey towards the outskirts of town, where a desolate graveyard awaited them. The wheels of the wagon rolled over the uneven terrain, creating a haunting melody that echoed through the night.  
Upon reaching their destination, the Regulars and Mustache gathered around a large grave. The moon, emerging from behind a cloud, illuminated the ghastly scene. The gaping hole seemed to devour some other bodies, decaying flesh and brittle bones mingling with the earth. It was a grave that held not only the fallen men of Calvera's gang, but also the remnants of countless others who had met their demise in this treacherous town.  
Mary and Patrick walked up to the site and stood near the grave. Their faces, etched with Solemn and weariness, reflected the weight of the burden the night carried. With a mixture of reverence and resignation, they tossed Calvera's lifeless body into the pit, joining the macabre congregation of the dead. A heavy silence settled over the graveyard, interrupted only by the wind whispering through the skeletal branches of nearby trees. Mary turned to Patrick, her voice filled with a somber acknowledgment of the harsh realities they faced.  
""The life we're dealt,"" she murmured, her words finding solace in the darkness. ""Getting late, kiddo.""

Robert Haines, the weak town Sheriff, meandered along the quiet streets of Bodie. He struck a match, the flame casting an eerie glow on his lined face as he lit his pipe. Just as the smoke curled upwards, his attention was drawn to the sound of hooves and wagon wheels approaching.  
Mary and Patrick appeared before riding passed the Sheriff on the empty flatbed, their eyes fixed on the horizon. Beneath the moon’s pale light they felt the weight of the Sheriff’s judgment—a man who had witnessed the chaos that painted the early evening. He believed in his own moral righteousness that set him above others. But they knew that he was nothing more than a corrupt, useless figure, unwilling to take a stand or offer any support.

""You're becoming an accessory,"" the Sheriff stated, his weak voice trailing off into the night. ""I know what's going on... Starting to stink up there.""  
Mary's gaze hardened as she turned to face the Sheriff. Her voice was laced with disdain and frustration, her words delivered with a cutting clarity.

""Then grab a shovel and handle it, Sheriff,"" she retorted, her voice dripping with contempt. ""We can't do it all for you. By the way, thanks for your help this evening” She had glimpsed the duality of his essence—on one fateful night, a predator of the shadows tearin through the sinewy resolve of an unfortunate outlaw, and the next, a silent sentinel ensuring the safe passage of a lone damsel making her way home beneath the indifferent stars. Deep in her bones, she knew that without Frank's dark, watchful presence, her life would have been snuffed out like a candle long before its time. At times, she was but a leaf upon the winds of fate, and Frank shielded her from a far more merciless tempest.

The Sheriff's eyes shifted uncomfortably, unable to meet Mary's gaze with any semblance of strength or purpose. At that moment, he understood the deep divide that separated him from Mary's loyalty and determination and the Magnolia Regulars. The sheriff was a mere figurehead, a mocking emblem of authority, bestowed by distant powers more concerned with control and expansion. He was a symbol of authority without any substance.

As Mary and Patrick disappeared around the corner, the sound of their wagon fading into the distance, the Sheriff stood in the empty street, a hollow shell of a man. The moon continued its watch in the sky, casting a somber light on the town of Bodie, where its sins demanded to be buried, but the weak Sheriff would never offer solutions, justice, or protection that was needed. But he did harbor a grim scheme, one that would unfold before dawn. Frank Bodie's fate was sealed; the night would claim him before the first light of daybreak.

In the quiet darkness of the graveyard, shadows danced upon the cold surface of the earth. From within those shadows, the Demon Killion emerged, a figure so ethereal in appearance with his white shoulder-length hair and pallid skin confirming his otherworldly presence, an apparition walking the line between the living and the dead. His eyes, twin orbs of malevolent frost, held within them a chilling void. In Colonial Massachusetts, he was called forth from the depths of another world by a sinister coven, their dark prophet, wielding an eerie power over their minds. Each soul bent under his malevolent influence, ensnared in his web of deceit and betrayal until there was but one left to bear witness to his unholy dominion. Killion made his way with an eerie purpose toward the town, his presence like a specter promising both peril and portent.

His passage through the dark streets was noiseless, save for the rustle of the night breeze that carried whispers of his coming. His gaze cut through the shadows to survey the row of saloons, each a den of vice and secrets. His attention settled deliberately on the Magnolia Saloon, where the wretched soul chosen to be his instrument of dark deeds sat, lost to the bottle and devoid of purpose

Inside the dimly lit Magnolia Saloon, the air was thick with smoke and the scent of spilled whiskey. Seated at his worn table, Frank Bodie sat at the corner of the room, the bottle his companion as he nursed its contents to the dregs. The room around him buzzed with the hum of drunken conversation, and the clink of glasses, a cacophony that seemed to stand apart from Bodie’s roiling thoughts.

Killion entered the saloon, his eyes finding Bodie with a predatory ease. He moved to him, words meant only for the drunken gunslinger.  
""Those little yellow rocks,"" Killion began, his voice as smooth as silk yet holding an edge sharp enough to cut.

He sat in the chair next to Bodie, the Magnolia’s patrons remained oblivious to the spectral presence that had infiltrated their midst, engrossed in their affairs, blind to the foreboding aura that clung to Frank Bodie like a shadow.  
”They lure vile men from all corners of the territories, only for them to meet their end in your hands."" Bodie, bleary-eyed, lifted his glass with unsteady hands.                                                                           ""The fate they choose,"" he replied, grimly accepting.  
""Do they?"" Killion countered, voice laden with insinuation.  
""Perhaps they seek more than mere gold. They search for a leader amid the chaos. Someone like them. Someone of power.""  
Bodie’s eyes, dark with memory and sorrow, flashed with a hint of the man he once was. A sheriff, before the world turned against him. Bodie was no fool; he saw the machinations at play but resolved not to be part of such madness. He refused to bend to the will of a puppet master, the malevolent architect behind a cursed congregation that sought to birth a legion of nightmares from the remnants of humanity.  
""I ain't lookin' to command an army of the damned. The darkness here is enough without my hand.”Killion laughed at Bodie’s attempt to distance himself from the carnage that plagued the town. Trying to detach himself, although not taking responsibility for the twenty or so lives he extinguished just hours earlier.  
Killion cast a glance at Mary, the woman who moved among the tables with serious confidence unshaken by the fear others held for Bodie.                                                                                                ""She’s as brave as they come,"" he noted. ""Loyal, despite the chaos that clings to you.""  
""Let her be,"" Bodie growled, clutching the bottle like a lifeline, his eyes hard.  
Killion chuckled, a sound like wind over a grave.  
“One of the few who isn't terrified by you. She accepts her life. And she no longer questions what you are. Maybe, just maybe, she wonders what it’s like being something more.""                                     Bodie’s glare was fire.  
""I’m warning you.”  
Killion laughed in a mocking tone.  
""You cannot harm me any more than I you, my friend... Now, you’re called a hero by some. But that is not entirely true. Be aware the tally of your adversaries grows. Especially after tonight.”  
Bodie downed his drink, silence marking the distaste within. liquid burning a familiar path down his throat—more comfort than a salve.  
Killion scanned the room with a knowing air, insistent upon his points.                                                   ""Think of the power you could wield,"" Killion mused.                                                                                     In that foreboding moment, as if orchestrated by some malevolent force, the eerie howls of wolves echoed through the night, each note dripping with an unsettling menace. This was not the cry of ordinary beasts, but a chilling reminder for Frank that the shadows teemed with eyes upon him. Killion's gaze locked onto Frank, and a silent acknowledgment passed between them—those spectral creatures, lurking just beyond the veil of darkness, were his new allies in the unforgiving High Sierras. Killion lifted his head, listening. Killion turned his head, listening intently.                                                                   “Listen to the hounds of hell. They are your brethren now, and the sooner you embrace it, the better.” Killion halted, his eyes lingering on Frank Bodie with a hint of disdain. When would this being he had molded finally embrace the darkness within?                                                                                                 ""If only you fed more frequently, rather than choosing that tonsil varnish,” he gestured to the bottle,"" dims your potential.""                                                                                                                                 Killion’s eyes turned toward the past, a time when Bodie was more than a broken man seeking solace in spirits.  
""When you were truly committed, you'd have never stood idly by as this town slipped quietly under the shadow of my dominion.”                                                                                                                            Bodie drained his drink, the lines of defeat etched deep upon his weathered features. Killion's words hung in the air like ghosts waiting to either condemn or redeem.  
“You think after tonight, the people will look upon you differently? You are mistaken. To most, you are still a dark Mystery that they fear.”                                                                                                               With that, Killion stood, with a final tap on the shoulder, encouraging yet firm.  
""Do not be bitter, my friend,"" Killion pressed. ""You stand as the only thing who will endure when this place is long gone. Forsake the shackles of your past and look to the future.""  
Killion made his way toward the swinging doors before turning.  
“Oh, one other thing. if you're contemplating escaping this life, heed my words: what you think is anguish at my hands is but a whisper compared to the relentless torment awaiting you in the afterlife. Make wise choices my friend""  
With that Killion departed past the swinging doors, leaving Bodie to the silence of his thoughts and the whispers of regret entwined with opportunity. Bodie sat alone, the bottle an empty companion. His mind played the echo of an older world, memories of a time when he was a lawman, when once he sought to protect and put outlaws away, not devour them. Memories clawed at him, visions of a family that once anchored him, now lost to the darkness that had crept into his heart like the shadow of a noose. Inside the saloon, under the watchful eyes of Mary, Mustache’ and her loyal Regulars, only the fragile balance between tension and violence held sway. This place, shrouded in sin and secrecy, had grown familiar, a twisted sanctuary where the six souls that knew his darkness kept his curse hidden within the old walls of the Magnolia. Their fear had morphed into an uneasy acceptance, as they learned to weather the storms of his intoxicated past mutterings, the echoes of a life that once shone with the promise of justice, now buried beneath the earth’s crust. Darkness took root in his soul, and the hanging tree from which he barely escaped claimed the life he once knew. Now, with Killion’s words thick in the air, Bodie faced the dawn of his future, not only armed with the lessons of his past but accompanied by those spectral beasts lurking beyond – forced companions in this treacherous world.

Mary wiped down the counter as she watched from the bar, her eyes full of unspoken understanding. The room felt normal again, whatever was in this room these past several minutes was gone. Mary knew something attached itself to Frank, for its presence could be felt most of the time whenever he was in the saloon. But she wouldn’t acknowledge its presence, it was best for her to remain a silent observer, lest the darkness turn its eyes upon her. So, she kept it to herself.

The late-night draped its suffocating shroud over the town, a hidden intent in every shadow and silence, as Washoe Pete and John Waterman sauntered toward the Magnolia Saloon. They stopped outside the Magnolia, eyes shifting, hands lingering near the bulges hidden beneath their coats.  
They stepped inside the saloon, where there was now a different tableau of rough men and wasted fortunes. except for Madam Mustache’ and the Regulars, who were permanent as the saloon’s tables, and often did, drink till dawn without toeing the line into folly.

Bodie lay slumped over, empty whiskey bottles and shot glasses on the table, oblivious to the undercurrents of hostility about to swirl around him.  
Pete and Waterman walked up to the bar.  
""Whiskey,"" Pete demanded, his voice edged with the malice of a man who had lost as many faces as money at the card tables. Mary, ever the calm amidst the storm, poured the drinks with a steady hand, her eyes meeting Pete’s with a quiet defiance.                                                                                      “What’s lurking beneath your coat?’  
""The town’s a dangerous place,"" Pete continued his pride as bruised as the one on his cheek. The air crackled with tension between the rival factions. Mustache', the cunning felon, had repeatedly stripped Pete and John Waterman of their fortunes at the saloon tables by the west side of town, leaving them empty-handed come night's end.  
""A man’s got the right to protect himself.""  
""You think you're owed something?"" Mary challenged, a spark in her eyes that matched the steel in her voice.  
""You had it coming.” She said  
Pete glared at Bodie’s unconscious form, bitterness etched into every line of his face.  
“I had it coming you say? I was here long before he strolled in thinkin' himself a savior.”  
“You challenged him.”  
""Think of it this way,"" quipped Madame Mustache’ from her table, card in hand,  
""It adds a bit of color to your pale face.""  
Laughter erupted from her table, echoing in the dim room, feeding Pete's seething embarrassment.  
""You find this funny?""  
Pete's voice rose, anger barely constrained. With a quick, rash motion, he pulled out his rifle, leveling it at Bodie's inert form.  
“Ye won’t think it's funny when your big friend lies sprawled out in his blood as it seeps in the dust, and a gaping hole where his heart once pumped.""

The room went still, guns drawn silently by the Regulars, all eyes fixed on Pete and Waterman, who now stood with the barrel of his rifle holding onto Bodie’s head.  
""You can't win,"" Mary said softly, holding Pete’s gaze.  
And for a moment, the tension in the air was tangible, a living thing that could collapse into violence or dissolve into bitter resignation. The regulars held steady, two guns each on both Waterman and Pete. “You may be a fool, Pete, and Lord knows you ain't worth a damn at the card table. But you ain’t no coward... You shoot him while he lies there drunk, you’re following him half a second later. And coward is what we’ll put on your headstone. Now let's be done with it.”

Finally, the stubborn set of Pete’s jaw softened.  
""Maybe you’re right,"" he conceded, lowering his rifle as an ugly laugh escaped him. “But it’s not done. Tonight maybe...”                                                                                                                                        Pete's gaze slithered over the tight-knit gang with loathing, a festering bitterness gnawed at his insides like a vengeful coyote. The thought of vengeance danced in his mind, a haunting waltz with the graves of Frank Bodie and Mustache as its stage. Yet, there was an understanding etched deep in his bones—a silent acknowledgment that the moment he drew, the shadows would close in, claiming him in a dance of death as eternal as the frontier itself.

“Do you think people don’t notice you in the wee hours?” He remarked.”Do you think they don’t see him on the rooftops out by Fuller Street? Fuckin’ revenant snatching folks on the other side.”  
Mustache' unfazed. The Regulars, guns still ready, watched with silent determination as the drama played out.                                                                                                                                                        ""Go on now, Pete,"" Mustache said coolly. ""Leave the cards to those who can read them.”  
With every mocking quip from Mustache, Pete stepped closer to doom, his fingers inching ever nearer to the other cold iron at his hip. Again, It’d be a simple matter to put her down, yet the price—a hail of bullets spelling his end—loomed heavily in the air, too grave to ignore.  
“You’re a tight little group here. Pack of cheating rats you are. Especially you French woman”  
Pete stared down Mustache’ before turning away, dignity too tattered for a fight.  
“You come visit us on the west side of town again soon.”  
“Be there in the wee hours.” She said  
Waterman’s anger still simmering followed Pete, curses barely restrained seething through clenched teeth. In the streets, gunshots punctuated the evening like an ugly rhythm in the background somewhere out between Green and Union Street. Waterman and Pete crossed toward the Bonanza Saloon, where Haines, the feeble Sheriff leaned against the post. He watched them with weary eyes, the tendrils of smoke from his pipe twisting like beckoning phantoms around his haunted visage.  
“I'm ending my confrontation with him. Want no part of it. Our problem is that cheating French woman,"" Pete spat, frustration leaking from every pore.  
""That animal inside is yours.""  
Ted the Banker, appeared from the shadows before standing beside Haines and nodded quietly.  
""Do away with her, that animal will be your problem.""  
Both men walked past them and entered the Bonanza, leaving Haines to his thoughts. He considered the restless night, the brewing storm within Bodie, and the tangled web of loyalties and resentments that bound the town’s fate.                                                                                                                           These two were as useless as a mirage on the horizon. He needed others, a fearsome cadre who could sweep through. Figures with influence and a formidable presence, men who understood the finality of true power.  
""The Virginia City Rangers,"" Haines mused aloud, a last resort in a town once balanced on the edge of lawlessness, now full-on unstable.  
If he could hire the Rangers he would be hailed as a hero, a savior. The townsfolk would lift their hats in respect, for he would be the one who orchestrated the peace. That’s exactly what he was going to do. Maybe, just maybe he would finally bring Justice to Frank Bodie.",2,1745708756.0,Vampire_Western,0,1.0,False

I'm a 25-year-old boy who's somewhere between “has his life together” and “double-checks simple things just to be sure.” I’m here hoping to stumble across someone who’s down for real connection — the kind with inside jokes, vulnerable talks at 2am, and sending each other weird memes like a love language.

A little about me:

- I’ve got a job I enjoy, (I work as a Video Editor for a Youtube channel).

- Emotionally available, introspective, and probably too self-aware for my own good.

- I'm big into philosophy — not in a ""quoting Nietzsche to sound deep"" kind of way, but more like ""let's unpack our childhood traumas and talk about existence over coffee at 1am.""

- Movies are my comfort zone. From slow-burn A24 stuff to chaotic thrillers to deep, emotionally gut-punching dramas, I love getting lost in a good story. If you’ve ever cried over a movie character like they were real, you get me.

- I like deep convos, absurd humor, psychology, long walks (mentally or literally), and trying to understand this strange experience called being human.

- Basically, I'm just a curious mind wrapped in a cozy hoodie with access to decent WiFi.

What I’m looking for:  
I don’t have a long checklist, but I vibe best with women who are emotionally intelligent, compassionate, and open to sharing their perspectives (even if they differ from mine — I love hearing new angles on things). Some shared interests are cool but not required — just be someone who’s thoughtful, understanding, and can handle some playful sarcasm and occasional philosophical spirals.

Long distance? Totally cool with me. Let’s just start by talking and see where it goes. No pressure to jump into anything — I’m more interested in the *c*onnection than a rushed label.

Bonus points if you:

- Like voice notes more than paragraphs  
- Have a favorite comfort show or rewatch the same movie like it’s therapy.  
- Can roast me just enough to keep me humble

If any of this sounds like your jam, slide into my DMs with your favorite movie, quote, or a random deep thought you’ve had lately. Worst case? We exchange a few good memes. Best case? We’re planning a cute video date with snacks and an overly analyzed movie night.

Looking forward to hearing from someone cool (is it you? 👀)",1,1745708563.0,SFWr4rIndia,0,1.0,False
