1ihtzev,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/1ihtzev/grieving/,Grieving,"For context, I’m 22f and my dad was diagnosed in July 2023 with glioblastoma (brain cancer). He died 3 weeks ago on January 12th.

It’s been hard without him and I just wish that I could talk to him and spend some time with him again, even something as simple as going out for a coffee or listening to music together like we used to.

Last week was difficult. It was my birthday last Wednesday and it was the first birthday I’ve had where he hasn’t been around. We made the most of it but I still wish he had of been there. The day before, my mum and I went to a holy shop to buy some decor for the grave. I kind of cried for a minute and that was the first time I’d actually cried from the funeral.

My dad was 59 and I honestly just feel robbed. I feel like I should have had at least another 10 years with him. It sucks too because my dad was such a lovely man, really funny and just overall genuinely kind. I don’t understand why he had to get Cancer.

I’ve been kind of feeling envious of other people. Like there are people in my family who are older than me, in their 30’s and they still have both of their parents. I do feel lucky to still have my mum but it’s hard not to feel jealous of other people who have both of their parents.

I just want to say that I am sorry to anyone who’s going through a similar situation. Remember that there is light at the end of the tunnel. Eventually, hopefully, things will get better.",1,1738706829.0,CancerFamilySupport,0,1.0,False

Hi everyone,

I’m looking to buy second-hand hospitality equipment in the Netherlands (ovens, counters, coffee machines, etc.). I know about Troostwijk, but in my experience, it’s nearly impossible to win an auction at a reasonable price because bids get inflated too much.

Does anyone know other websites or places where I can buy this kind of equipment at a good price? Any recommendations are welcome.

1ihtxvx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1ihtxvx/problem_with_vit_d/,Problem with Vit D,"Hey all,
I've got a few issues with Vit D, which I know from experience to be.. Well somewhat of a wonderdrug. At least in my own personal life. 

I started taking it about 5 years ago. It was a period of some high (mega?) doses. Starting with 30.000 IU/day for 2 months and then took 10-15.000/day after for 4-6 months. And eventually lowered to 6-8000/day.
And at the time it completely changed my life. I felt like I suddenly had energy all day every day for months to years. And like I could see more clearly/crisp. And mentally more clear, less stressed and overall more positive. Achieved a lot during that time. 

After a long time, ~2 years, I started getting some problems sleeping and I stopped all supplementation. After a while I found out it was the Vit D that caused (on some days MASSIVE) insomnia. Like you're mentally tired but your brain is absolute FIRED UP. Like it's full of electricity and sleep is impossible. 

So I stopped for a long time. Then started taking low doses (100-500iu)as part of a multivitamin or other mixes. Which works fine but I don't get the hard to deny insane benefits. 
The last 1-2 years I try it so now and then (like these last days) and take a higher dose again (3500iu). And it's mixed results. 

Some days 30m-2hrs after taking Vit D I yawn and am sort of sleepy without being tired. But then it ""triggers"" quite late on the day and am super ""on"" /wired just before heading to bed. 

Some days it activates perfectly and I feel super zen, ""in the zone"", the best version of myself. Just waaaaay less prone to stress, calmer, feel ""more myself, more comfortable in my skin, more emotionally stable, more energised. All of the benefits together get to msy favourite point which is that my general motivation is way higher which just brings me to do the things I want to do for myself much easier and know are good for me. Like working out, working on projects, taking on confrontations or checking off things I've neglected. And above all else a sort of clarity and excitement to try new things. 

There's also some clear physical benefits such as my body temperature regulation is just at peak balance. Never cold, never too warm. (in Norway, where the winters are pretty cold and inside is dry hot due to heaters). 
And training is more ""smooth"". 


It seems that one problem could be is the vit D somehow triggers late in my body and activates 6-7hrs later. 

Some things to mention:
- I don't change up anything else when monitoring this + sleep is more or less stable (at least until I get those insomnia days, which can be tough to keep the amount of sleep the same, when you still have work in the morning) 
- I always take Vit D 12.00 midday at the latest, with my first meal of the day. (if I take it later than that I know from experience years ago.. There will be absolutely no sleep and it's pure nightmare) 
- I always take it in combination with 200ug K2


All this just to ask, does anyone else have similar experiences they feel like sharing. 
Or does anyone have any ideas? 

I just feel so much more ""myself"" when the high doses work. Not like coffee (which I quit mostly) or similar drinks that make your body go in overdrive and cross your body's borders. When things went well with Vit D I had this sense as if it just simply strengthened my body from ""within"", letting the body just do it's own work a little better.
I wish I could get the benefits of Vit D without the side effects. 
Perhaps there are some ideas or theories about this? 

Sorry for the very long message. Hope it makes sense.

I’ve seen this on a few builds, where a slab, usually wooden, is attached where the machine usually ends at the bottom. It theoretically improves stability, allowing pulls to be more fluid, mechanically, with an unmoving machine that doesn’t need a second hand to stabilize it.

If you have this mod, are you glad you have it? And for all the others without the extra base, are you confident with how the machine behaves mechanically when you are bearing down with a lot of force during a pull?",1,1738706679.0,LaPavoniLovers,0,1.0,False

1ihtvu6,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1ihtvu6/day_3/,Day 3,"Well it is day 3 with no caffeine. I have been consuming some form of caffeine since I was a young kid. Soda around the age of 6 or 7 I guess, followed by coffee and energy drinks in high school/college, preworkout, caffeine pills, you name it... I try to stop consuming caffeine by 2 or 3 PM most days, but still sometimes have trouble sleeping. I have quit once or twice in the past, but it never really stuck.

I just recently kicked my nicotine habit, and figured caffeine would be easier after that... In some ways it is but in other ways it isn't. I feel like for me, caffeine withdrawal has more of a physical hinderance vs. the psychological pull that nicotine had on me. The folks on the r/QuittingZyn community have been so super helpful and I'm glad to have found this one too. 

First 2 days there was a pretty killer headache. I drank a few beers at night which didn't really help (alcohol is up next on my quit list). I feel like the worst part is the sheer amount of lethargy I feel combined with my ever-growing to do list both at home and at work. My brain is screaming at me to just consume some caffeine so I can be more productive, but I know that won't really help in the long run. I have learned that *feeling* productive isn't the same as *being* productive. Currently struggling with the concept of drudging through the days ahead without knowing how many they might be, and asking myself if I can keep my job and support my family if it goes on like this.

I have recently added a few supplements in to my routine to see if it would help with the energy and focus (L-Tyrosine, NAC, Multi, Magnesium, Fish Oil, B vitamin complex, etc) and maybe they are helping a bit but I just get these waves of tired especially in the afternoon, and I don't feel like I accomplished much good yesterday and today.

Really hoping this starts to improve towards the end of the week, because I have some big commitments to fulfill both at home and at work. I have read a lot of other posts on here about people with longer or shorter timelines before they feel energetic and productive again and I'm hoping in my case it is on the shorter side.

Anyways making this post in part for accountability, and also to solicit any form of advice or encouragement any of you might have.

1ihtve9,https://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/1ihtve9/cherry_pie_coffeethe_light_and_the_dark/,Cherry Pie & Coffee/The Light and The Dark,"Something I was thinking about today is the possible symbolism surrounding what are arguably Agent Cooper’s favorite snacks — cherry pie & coffee.

Cherry pie, with its sweetness could be a metaphor for the good things in life, the sweetness, the times, people and places that give our lives meaning and joy. The literal sweetness of life.

Conversely, black coffee, which can be anywhere from rich to sharp to bitter could be a metaphor for darkness and the uncertainty of existence.  I wouldn’t go so far as to say evil necessarily, but rather that the coffee is the yang to cherry pie’s ying. 

Just as BOB feeds on suffering, Agent Cooper ingests darkness (coffee), but they are on opposite sides of the good/evil spectrum. They both want to stop (end) the other.

1ihtqp3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ihtqp3,A Greek in the field of reeds,"Brick was quick to notice the slight sluggishness in First movements. To outsiders it would appear as there wasn't any change at all but to someone who had fought with her from the moment they left the academy it stood out like a nail that hadn't been hammered in all the way. It was ok he had just the thing.  

Brick wandered over to his rucksack and after a quick ruffling you found what he was looking for a cheesy omelette MRE, a human sized one that had been sent to him by mistake. He was going to save for a snack later. Opening it was a bit difficult for his large fingers but after the third try he was able to get it open stuffing the instant coffee packet into the palm of his hand and grabbing a cup from one of the spares and filling it with water from his canteen. 

“Thought you needed to pick me up” he said, handing her the coffee packet and water.

“Thanks Brick” 

Black Iron instant coffee packets had a special enchantment on them when they were torn and poured into water. It would heat the water on its own. First emptied the packet into the water cup and stirred it with her finger. First preferred her coffee a little bit hotter and then the safe temperature that the packets enchantment provided.  With a bit of pyromancy she radiated heat into the metal cup being extra careful not to melt it. 

The ride to their destination was surprisingly uneventful, the barracuda only occasionally shuttering in what little bits of turbulence impeded them on the journey to the holy Kingdom of Grazan.

“This is black Iron barracuda 1A we're the mercs you ordered looking for a place to put the bird down.”

Straightman spoke through the Orb link built in the barracudas console

“This is Court mage Priscilla of the Holy Court of the Pontius. I will send one of my disciples, follow the beam of holy light. Paladine bless you”

The barracuda touches down in a Serene courtyard and brick feels the shutter from The landing. The barracuda's rear door opens and brick like always is  the first to step out. He noticed them instantly the stares of the silver armored soldiers and white robed priests. Not ones of fascination and curiosity but gazes of muted disgust. 

Brick was no psychic but he could tell what they were thinking. His kind was not welcome here. But the looks they gave First were worse. It seemed like every face that saw her had their jaws tighten and brows crease as the inner parts of their eyebrows were cast downwards it looks of pure hate. Some of their soldiers' hands drifted towards their weapon while priests angrily whispered amongst each other. 

Unfortunately both of them were very use to It now. They proceeded to the pontus's Palace doing their best to ignore the discontent of those around them. When they finally arrived at the entrance they were stopped by a battalion's worth of soldiers.

“You will go no further hell spawn” 

One of the soldiers who wore a red plumed helmet said First rolled her eyes. 

“Look your boss already signed the contract if you wanted someone different he should have paid extra for that service. Now move and let us do our f****** job”

The guard nearly reached for their sword out of reflex. 

“You will restrain your tongue infernal or-”

“Let's them in!”

Court mage Priscilla shouting as she sneered squad D from above .

“But-”

“I will hear no arguments”

With that the soldiers parted. The inside Palace of the Pontius was a lavishly decorated white marble estate estate it's walls covered in murals depicting various scenes of great victories of metallic dragons Paladine blessings mortals with divine light. A scene depicting holy paladins and metallic dragons casting various infernal and abyssal creatures as well as chromatic dragons into a pit.  All likely scenes from their scripture. 

“Black Iron has some audacity to send a hellspawn to taint my court with its presence” the meeting with the Pontius was already going about as well as Bick expected it to.

“Look f-”

Brick cleared his throat loudly to interrupt First. 

“My apologies sir,just so you know in the future you can request for specific teams to meet your *tactical*challenges for a reasonable fee.”

“Ah someone who knows how to address their superiors” the Pontius replied Brick suspected he didn't just mean employers. 

“Yes well all that aside were are to solve your draconic issue” 

The Pontius ordered all the people besides Priscilla him and squad D to leave the chamber. 

“It is not just a problem, it's a disaster, a holy metallic rampaging through our lands like the spawn of the seven headed Harlot. A being of such Noble nature would never do such a thing unless something was corrupting it surely your Draconid kin understands this”

He whispers to Priscilla for a few moments before speaking again. 

“we have not seen one with your particular features and are curious which lineage do you hail from”

Jez having seen the pit mural, decides to employ a secret negotiation tactic known as lying. 

“I am a child of bahamut” Jez answered. 

“I am confused why your Holiness would keep such…ignoble company but I will not question your design. Nonetheless your job is to find the source of the corruption and Purge it and if you cannot guide the dragon to paladines embrace”

“Gotcha, give us the location of the most recent attack and will work from there” Brick said. 


The flight to the site of the most recent dragon attack was significantly more tense. The barracuda was a remarkably tough aircraft and could take a lot of punishment but it was not designed for air to air combat especially against a dragon.  But they arrived without issue and begin the process of tracking the dragon down by following its path of destruction. Unlike the people in the capital the rural folk were surprisingly hospitable even feeding them and housing them through the night free of charge. Brick tired not to burden even forcing himself to eat the lentils they had provided despite being an obligate carnivore. 

It took squad D only only a scant few days traveling on foot to find the most recent dragon attack. Brick could see the footprints, the destroyed houses. He could see and smell the bodies. He like the rest of his squad kept his head on a swivel as the half-over casted wards on himself and his squad mates. But the one thing that threw him off was the buzzing of the insects. 

“How close is it” First asked

“Close” Jez said while swatting another wasp away. 

“I can sense its presence, it feels… wrong, forgive me my lord” Jez reflexively apologized to the dragon they were about to fight. 

“Wait!” Jez signaled for the rest of the squad  to stop.

“Help…me…” the voice called out distant but growing closer the squad could hear the thudding footsteps of a adult dragon. 

“Please…help…me” the call for help trailed off into a buzzing sound as the dragon's charge met it's crescendo and it crashed through a nearby building. 

Brick wasn't quite sure what he saw it was supposed to be a copper dragon. He could see a large wasp nest sprouting from its back and stomach, its scales having taken on a tarnished green color and its left eye was missing. In its absence wasps crawled in and out of the opening. 

The Hive dragon let out a feral roar 
 before summoning a barrage of acidic missiles to assault them. Squad D scatters in response moving to avoid the dragons most dangerous area it's front. 

Straightman and brick open fire from the left side particle shot and heavy autocannon fire slamming into the dragon's wards as the rest of squad D opens fire with ice Spikes and a wall of flames as Jez readys is an RPG rocket 

“It's warded focus fire!”

First yell as her and brick charged the creatures flanks. The swarm prioritizes spreading over defense and the hive dragon vomits out of stream of stinging wasps that changed directions and a charged towards Jez the stinging insects could fly straight through Bricks wards and Brick is forced to divert his charge to throw up a barrier to interrupt the stream as he watches in horror as the leading insects fly straight through firsts wall of fire. This gives Jez the precious few seconds he needs to get airborne but leaves first uncovered. 

“It hurts…please” 

The Hive dragon lets out a burst of electrical energy that sends her flying. Brick grits his teeth in anger. 

“Pin it down!” he yelled as he sprinted towards the thing. Milk does exactly that, taking advantage of his liquid form to slither between the hive dragon's legs and lock its left forelimb into place with ice before slithering away. Brick presses his auto cannon directly onto the dragon's Ward and opens fire the stream of 25 mm tungsten cored ammunition focused in a singular spot causing the ward to fail. 

The swarm decides that brick should die first. The Hive dragon snaps off its own left four limb to strike Brick with its right.  The claw strike carves a severe gash  from Bricks right shoulder to his left hip. A swarm of insects emerge from the freshly severed limb and dive into the wound biting and stinging. 

First frees herself from the rubble only to see brick fall over bleeding. She was horrified it was like watching a nightmare play out in the waking world but that horror quickly gave way to something else…rage.  There is a violent explosion of heat as first combusts flame envelops her form as her horns regrow to their full length and less than a fraction of a second. 

“TAKE THAT THING DOWN NOW!”

The Hive dragon attempts to take the skies only to have its right wing blown off with an RPG it falls so the ground as ice spikes pin its left wing and particle shot tears holes in its body and head. Despite taking multiple headshots, The Hive dragon is somehow still alive.  

Brick on the ground during this prioritizes healing himself casting greater cure wounds and swatting away the insects the deep of gash begins to close as his intestines stuff themselves back inside his body but then he notices something wrong the wound isn't closing fully despite how much healing magic he's putting into it and there is a burning sensation beginning to emanate from the wound and spread throughout his veins. 

Jez summons a powerful downburst of wind the force the wasps trying to escape into joining their host in Oblivion as first propels herself with explosive force and delivers a destruction magic infused dropkick to the creature's head. The Hive dragon violently explodes in a blast of Gore fire and destruction leaving First standing in a crater where the dragon's torso used to be. First and the rest of squad D Sans Milk rushes to Brick as he attempts to stand he is only partially able to do so getting himself upright for the briefest of seconds before falling onto his knee.

“Brick what's happening can't you cast cure poison.” First voice has a frantic tone to it. His skin is beginning to turn purple around his neck and arms.

Brick goes to do exactly that only to find the spell failing. 

“Its…. Not working”

“Shit-shit-shit” First mumbles in a panic 

“Jez portal to the Palace now!”

Jez works on exactly that as first uses her pyromancy to cauterize the wound to at least stop the bleeding. Milk, the only one concerned with getting paid at this point, slithers up to The Hive dragon's remaining right forelimb and blasts off one of its claws with his particle pistol before taking it and rushing through the portal as it closes. 

“So did you deal with the dragon problem”

The Pontius asked. 

Milk tosses the claw at his feet. 

“Never mind that, take us to your clerics!” 
First shouted. 

Brick condition had worsened, The burning sensation increased and the purple coloring of his skin had spread to his lower jaw and hands. He could not stand on his own using his autocannon as a crutch.

“I am under no obligation to help you you have fulfilled your contract, take your mongrel half-breed pet to die somewhere besides my floors.”

First steps forward to murder the man with her bare hands but brick despite his broken right shoulder reaches out and grabs first by the shoulder he knows black Iron would hunt her down if she murdered a client despite her reasons for doing so. 

First attention returns to more pressing matters. As brick falls to his knee once again. 

“It's ok brick I will get you help” it was as much of a reassurance to her as it was to Brick. 

“Jez where's the nearest specialist get a portal to the barracuda”

Jez was already drawing the portal sigil. 

“R&A it to far away…” Jez looked at Brick

“I don't think he will make it”

“The closest potential specialist I could think of would be the bizlands”

“Then we go there!” First says as the dragged brick through the portal. He could only make it inside the barracuda before collapsing as paralysis took hold of him.

It was such a strange experience as the barracuda flew towards the bizlands he could see first and his squad preside over him. He could see them apply a variety of medicine to his wound in an attempt to stabilize him to slow or stop the poison's progression. His vision begins to blur. He can hear First say something to him but he can't make out what it was. He wants to reach out and comfort her and tell her it was going to be alright. But he knew he couldn't move his arms. He knew he couldn't move his lips. But most of all he knew he was beginning to die.

At first he feels his fingers go numb then he feels his toes do the same he feels the cold numbness creep its way up his arms to the core of his being. He sees his blurred vision begin to be swallowed by blackness. It was as if each of his life functions was shutting down one by one as soul was decoupled from his body. One by one his life threads were cut, the darkness that swallowed his vision grew until eventually his heart stopped. Brick's soul leaves his body bound to it by a single thread. He drifts through the etheric realm of souls that have no afterlife guided past the wandering soul eaters by the last decree of Gobul-el-Shub. Straight to the next God the Dead deities follower was closest to his soul floats upwards not towards the heavens but towards space towards the celestial Union towards its underworld towards Acheron.

Any way to salvage this?,"I have had my best friend for 15 years. We were very close. We went to school together. We graduated high school and college together. We would text nonstop. When we weren’t texting, we were hanging out. We have always been each other’s go-to through life. She began acting “off” over the last few months. She was always on social media and developed online friends. She gained a lot of weight even though we went to the gym every other day. She started giving up on fitness and told me “I’m only going for you, you know”. So I started going on my own. When we would go get coffee she would make snide remarks about my work outfits or my hair and take very bad photos of me to laugh. She’d ask me “why is your hair doing that today?” Just little things to pick on me. She set my contact photo as a horrible distorted picture of me. I saw her other friends’ contact photos and they are all flattering. Except mine. She would be detached from our convos and would be messaging her online friends in front of me, although she would never tell me about them. They knew about me though - I saw a text to one mentioning my name. 

We would go on trips together. Last September we went to the Bahamas and she acted like she didn’t enjoy it at all. She never talked about our trip after that. Fast forward to last week. I found one of her Twitter accounts. It was not officially under her name, but it had tons of recent activity. On there, she was retweeting racist and problematic political bs. Stuff that directly went against me and my beliefs - we never talked politics together, but the stuff she was sharing felt like a personal attack. She was on there tweeting with her online friends as well. There would be days where she would ignore me and/or my messages all day and never reply, but apparently she was screenshotting my messages to her and posting them on Twitter. Tmi ones too. One has the caption “one thing about me is I’m not too tmi 😭”. Yet she’d never message me back. That’s where I finally snapped. Instead of confronting her about her trash posts online, I blocked her on everything I could think of. If she wants to reach me she’ll have to message me on eBay. 

I think she knew that I found out something was going on, because she tweeted yesterday “I need to change my username so irl friends can’t find me omfg…”

She’s really turned into a shitty friend. She never directly insulted me but to be openly racist and homophobic online, ignore me for days on end, and talk about me to her online friends? That’s enough.  She has been my only friend for the last few years. She has multiple friends irl and online though, so I guess maybe this whole time I’ve been on the back burner. I know it’s time for us to grow up though. Is it even worth telling her how I feel? I feel like she already knows. I don’t want to talk to her for a while. Is it worth even salvaging?",0,1738706096.0,relationship_advice,3,0.33,False

⭐ = Top reccomendation

---

### **Off to Be the Wizard**  
*Author:* Scott Meyer  
*Narrator:* Luke Daniels  
**Summary:** A hacker discovers life is a computer program and escapes to live life in the Middle Ages as a wizard.   
**Review:** I enjoyed this. It's a fun idea that has been written well with some interesting ideas and moments that genuinely made me laugh. Luke Daniels did a great job.   

---

### **Mogworld**  
*Author:* Yahtzee Croshaw  
*Narrator:* Yahtzee Croshaw  
**Summary:** In a world full to bursting with would-be heroes, Jim couldn't be less interested in saving the day. His fireballs fizzle. He's awfully grumpy. Plus, he's been dead for about sixty years. When a renegade necromancer wrenches him from eternal slumber and into a world gone terribly, bizarrely wrong, all Jim wants is to find a way to die properly, once and for all.  
**Review:** Excellent British humour and a hilarious story. My personal gripe with the audiobook is the author is also the narrator, and I feel he's not that great at it. Also, I swear I hear a bin lorry in the background at one point...  
Anyway, still a great story to listen to, and it's not too long. Definitely worth a try.

---

### **Hard Luck Hank (Series)**  
*Author:* Steven Campbell  
*Narrator:* Liam Owen  
**Summary:** Hank is a thug. He knows he's a thug. He has no problem with that realisation. In his view, the galaxy has given him a gift: a mutation that allows him to withstand great deals of physical trauma. He puts his abilities to the best use possible, and that isn't by being a scientist.  
**Review:** This is a good 3/5. The story is fun and has laugh-out-loud moments but can get a bit repetitive after a while. There are 11 books so far, and I haven't read all of them yet.

---

### **⭐⭐ Space Team (Series)**  
*Author:* Barry J. Hutchison  
*Narrator:* Various  
**Summary:** Whisked across the galaxy, Cal is thrown into a team of some of the sector's most notorious villains and scumbags. Their mission should be simple enough, but as one screw-up leads to another, they find themselves in a frantic battle to save an entire alien civilisation—and its god—from total annihilation.   
**Review:** My review is of the GraphicAudio production, BUT PLEASE DON'T SKIP IT! I know full-cast audio gets (somewhat justified) hate, but this series is so. Fucking. Funny. The actor for Cal is perfect, and the comedy timing is superb. The only letdown is one actress for a main character, but it's so worth pushing through. There have been moments where I laughed out loud in public, laughed hard to the point of stomach cramps, and at one point, I had to sit down when doing the washing up because I couldn't stop giggling. 11/10, my favourite series of all time.

---

### **⭐ Brute Force**  
*Author:* Scott Meyer  
*Narrator:* Luke Daniels  
**Summary:** A peaceful organisation of civilised planets is faced with a threat to their very existence. Desperate to save themselves, they turn for help to the most brutal, backward, violent species in the known galaxy: humans.  
**Review:** Found this when I was searching for something similar to *Space Team*, and it definitely scratched the itch! Absolutely hilarious and will forever make you giggle at threats of being stabbed. Luke Daniels does a fantastic job with this, and I think it's his best work.

---

### **Renegade Star (Series)**  
*Author:* J.N. Chaney  
*Narrator:* Luke Daniels  
**Summary:** They say Earth is a myth, humanity's lost homeworld—just a bedtime story. But when Captain Jace Hughes meets a nun with a mysterious cargo and a shocking secret, he learns everything he believed is wrong. Board *The Renegade Star*, gather a crew, follow the clues, uncover the truth, and fight to survive.  
**Review:** My first intro to Luke Daniels. This isn't a comedy but has plenty of moments that will make you laugh. I consider it a popcorn adventure series that doesn't take itself seriously.

---

### **⭐ Legends & Lattes**  
*Author:* Travis Baldree  
*Narrator:* Travis Baldree  
**Summary:** After a life of bounties and bloodshed, Viv, a battle-weary orc, retires her sword to open Thune's first coffee shop. But with rivals, ignorance about coffee, and challenges ahead, she can’t do it alone. Along the way, she finds unexpected allies, forged by magic, pastries, and coffee, who become more than she ever imagined—partners, family, and something deeper.  
**Review:** Travis is a narrator who released his first book. It's a light-hearted story with funny moments that will cheer you up. Fun idea well executed.

---

### **Honourable Mention:**  
#### **Expeditionary Force (Series)**  
*Author:* Craig Alanson  
*Narrator:* R.C. Bray  
**Summary:** The series follows a ragtag group of humans, led by soldier Joe Bishop and aided by a snarky, ancient AI named Skippy, as they navigate a galaxy filled with warring alien species. After Earth is dragged into an interstellar conflict, Joe and his team must outwit powerful aliens, uncover ancient secrets, and pull off impossible missions to save humanity—all while relying on Skippy’s brilliance and questionable sense of humour. It’s a mix of military sci-fi, humour, and high-stakes adventure.  
**Review:** Great character development in this series; however, the stories tend to get a bit repetitive, but it's actually worth it for the hilarious quips of Skippy. R.C. Bray does an amazing job on this with the amount of different characters.",4,1738706018.0,audiobooks,2,1.0,False
1ihtnpo,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1ihtnpo/threatened_on_train/,Threatened on Train,"I recently had a meltdown on a long distance night train. I was traveling alone to meet my family. I started having a panic attack. Normally I just take medication and am fine. Because the cafe car was closed, I asked the train manager if there was a way to purchase water. They sometimes sell coffee in the train car in the morning when there is no cafe car. I didn‘t think it was a big deal.

He yelled at me saying it was my own fault I needed water, that I should have brought it with me or not be on the train. I already couldn’t breathe. I called him an asshole, and he responded by telling me he would throw me off the train in a remote area.

Normally if I have a meltdown, I‘m at home. I work a lot from home and can normally manage meltdowns with medication, and I do some math and it calms me down. This is the first time in seven years since I had one in public. I started stimming. I was embarrassed. I had trouble moving but was able to trigger the emergency function on the phone and call the police. They met me at the next station with an ambulance. The train manager said I was insane and threatening him. He filed a police report against me.

I filed a complaint to the train company and my own police report because of the threats to abandon me by the tracks. But, I‘m still really upset. Maybe someone has a similar story that might help me feel less alone?

If you are considering building a barndominium, the layout is essential for maximizing comfort and functionality. Here are some innovative floor plans that you can explore.

- Bright, airy spaces enhanced by large windows.
- Cohesive design that encourages social interactions.
- Easy maintenance and visibility across the living space.

### Dedicated Bedrooms and Bathrooms

- Two to three bedrooms, depending on your needs.
- Two full bathrooms to accommodate family and guests.
- A master suite with an en-suite bathroom for added privacy.

### Home Office Space

With the rise in remote work, having a dedicated home office is becoming essential. The 30x60 barndominium can easily accommodate a separate office space. Consider the following:

- Position the office away from the main living areas for concentration.
- Incorporate built-in shelves to maximize productivity.
- Ensure good lighting, preferably natural light from windows.

### Utility and Storage Solutions

In a barndominium, efficient use of space translates to convenience. A well-planned utility room can offer you storage options and organization. Here are some elements to consider:

- Laundry area separate from the main living space.
- Pantry connected to the kitchen for easy access to supplies.
- Garage space that can double as a workshop or storage area.

### Outdoor Living Spaces

- Covered porches or patios for year-round enjoyment.
- Integrating sliding glass doors to enhance indoor/outdoor flow.
- A space for outdoor cooking and entertaining.

### Eco-friendly Features

- Choosing your preferred color scheme and materials for the exterior.
- Designing custom cabinetry to meet your storage needs.
- Adding personal touches with unique lighting fixtures or hardware.

Innovative 30x60 barndominium floor plans offer modern conveniences while retaining a rustic charm. By considering aspects like open living, outdoor spaces, and eco-friendly features, you can create a comfortable and stylish home suited to your lifestyle. Whether you’re building a barndominium for a family, as a vacation retreat, or as a single living space, the flexibility and creativity these plans offer are boundless.

Key Considerations When Designing Your 30x60 Barndominium Layout
----------------------------------------------------------------

Designing a 30x60 barndominium layout offers an exciting opportunity to create a space that suits your lifestyle and preferences. With its flexible open floor plan, adopting a thoughtful approach can greatly enhance the overall functionality and aesthetic appeal of your home. Here are some key considerations to keep in mind as you plan your dream barndominium.

### Understanding Your Needs

Before you start drafting your layout, take a moment to evaluate your needs. Ask yourself the following questions:

- How many bedrooms do you need?
- Will you require a home office or workspace?
- What are your family dynamics? (pets, children, frequent guests)
- Do you entertain often? How much space will that require?

Understanding your lifestyle will allow you to design a layout that meets your specific requirements while ensuring comfort and convenience.

### Flow and Accessibility

Another important aspect to consider is the flow of the space. A well-planned layout eliminates congestion and promotes movement throughout the home. Keep the following points in mind:

- Create clear pathways between rooms—ensure doors and furniture don't obstruct movement.
- Position major living areas (living room, kitchen) close to each other, facilitating easy access.
- Consider placing bathrooms near bedrooms and common areas for convenience.

Good flow not only enhances your living experience but also makes your home more functional for guests and family.

### Maximizing Space

The 30x60 barndominium layout provides a generous amount of space, but that doesn’t mean clutter should take over. Here are ways to maximize your space:

- Opt for an open floor plan, which creates an airy feel and allows for versatile arrangements.
- Use multifunctional furniture—for example, consider a coffee table that doubles as storage.
- Incorporate built-in shelves or cabinets to keep surfaces clear.

With these strategies, you’ll make the most of your space while maintaining an organized and inviting environment.

### Natural Light and Ventilation

Natural light plays a crucial role in creating a warm and welcoming atmosphere. When designing your layout, think about how to incorporate windows and ventilation:

- Position windows to capture sunlight throughout the day, enhancing mood and reducing energy costs.
- Add skylights if possible, especially in areas where windows aren’t viable.
- Ensure adequate ventilation to promote airflow—this is key in areas like the kitchen and bathroom.

By prioritizing natural light and ventilation, you'll create a healthy and pleasant living space.

### Comfort and Functionality

While aesthetics are important, comfort and functionality should be at the forefront of your design. Consider these elements to ensure your layout meets these needs:

- Incorporate enough seating in living areas for both daily use and entertaining.
- Ensure your kitchen is designed for meal prep, with sufficient counter space and storage for appliances.
- Plan for noise control by placing bedrooms away from living spaces whenever possible.

These touches will lead you towards a warm and inviting barndominium that feels like home.

### Future Needs

When designing your 30x60 barndominium layout, think about future needs. Life changes, and you may need to adapt your space later on. Questions to ponder include:

- Will your family grow?
- Are you planning to work from home?
- Do you desire room for hobbies or activities?

By considering these possibilities now, you can create a space that evolves with you and your family.

Ultimately, designing your 30x60 barndominium layout is a personalized journey. By keeping factors like needs, flow, space management, light, comfort, and future plans at the forefront, you'll be well on your way to crafting a unique and functional home. Embrace the process and enjoy creating a space that reflects your lifestyle and individuality.

### Conclusion

As you explore the potential of 30x60 barndominium floor plans, it’s clear that these innovative designs offer a perfect blend of style, functionality, and modern living. Embracing the versatility of barndominiums allows you to create a space tailored to your specific needs, whether for family living, a home office, or a hobby workshop. The expansive floor area provides the freedom to customize layouts that reflect your lifestyle.

When designing your 30x60 barndominium, it’s crucial to consider key factors like flow, natural light, and your future needs. Think about how you move through the spaces, and prioritize areas that promote interaction and accessibility. Integrating thoughtful elements such as open-concept designs can enhance the feeling of spaciousness, while dedicated zones for privacy (like bedrooms away from common areas) ensure comfort for everyone.

Additionally, don’t overlook the potential for energy efficiency and sustainability in your design. Choosing quality materials and energy-efficient features can lead to long-term savings and a reduced carbon footprint. By marrying innovative design with practical considerations, you can create a barndominium that’s not only beautiful but also functional and sustainable.

Ultimately, the charm of a 30x60 barndominium lies in its adaptability to your preferences. Whether you envision a traditional rustic look or a sleek modern aesthetic, the flexibility of these floor plans empowers you to create a home that truly represents your personal style.

1ihtjqx,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1ihtjqx/hypomania_coming_up_again/,"Hypomania, coming up again","Posting this here to a community that will understand, rather than going on Instagram and blasting my episode to my followers.

Today was the first time in a few months that I felt hypomania coming on. I’m not sure what triggered it but it came on very fast. I didn’t sleep very well the last two nights and today I had double the amount of caffeine (matcha) I’ve had in the last two weeks, after quitting coffee. So that might be why I’m feeling this way. 

I’m feeling impulsive and have racing thoughts. I can feel the mania behind my eyes. It feels like tunnel vision, but at the same time I can’t focus on any one thing. I keep jumping around to different activities, reading things, posting things on social media, I’ll listen to half a song, then open a random YouTube video and watch a minute of it, then randomly text a friend some nonsensical joke. I need to get out and touch grass (in a safe way) and use my self soothing techniques.

I’ve had quite a bit of stability the last few months, and relief from cycling, so after feeling pretty stable for a while it’s scary to feel hypomanic again. It feels so familiar and so foreign at the same time. It feels like an old friend coming back… I’m a little scared of myself right now. Just need to keep myself safe until this passes.

Side note: I’ve been on lamictal for about four weeks titrating slowly,  I know lamictal doesn’t have much impact on mania, but I’m hoping it starts improving my depressive symptoms.",3,1738705743.0,bipolar2,2,1.0,False

I grew up and went to high school in killeen so it very homey to me but recently i’ve been visiting to get used to being here and something feels off. I left killeen during covid and going back I can tell a lot has changed. I feel like there used to be life into the city and now driving around feels like a barren wasteland. Can someone explain to me what’s going on? Businesses are gone that used to be super popular and now there’s nothing besides car washes and vacant buildings. Also I noticed there are way more real estate agents here now and as far as i’m aware the area isn’t growing at the rate it should be and the industry has been slowing down. The lack of third spaces is also sad I remember there was a late night coffee shop that was insanely cool but because part of the building burned down the owners never fixed it. 
Killeen has so much potential to be a cool city to be but it feels like local officials aren’t moving it in a different direction.

Note: I understand covid took a toll on everyone especially small towns were affected but we’re about 5 years post covid and I feel like the city hasn’t bounced back.

Now that it's started I wanted to give it a kickstart. I don't have anything going on today so I took two tablespoons of MCT oil. When I'm in keto I can handle one tablespoon at a time easily, not so much when I'm not in keto. I've never taken two before. I can feel the gut party getting started.

We have always been very close and have always been there for each other at every moment of our lives. However, as life went on, she had two children and went to live with the children's father (whom I always loved as if they were my family). Every month I would visit to spend some time with her and the boys and my boyfriend would start to question why she never found time to come to my house and I would always make ""excuses"" saying that since I was a mother her life was different etc. I must say that her house was about 10 minutes away from mine.

However, after complications at home, she had to move and went to her mother's house to live with her boyfriend and children. For some time now I had noticed that my friend (best friend) never called or texted me unless she needed me for something, either to vent about her problems or asking to go to her house because she felt lonely, but I tried to get through to her. far away.

On my last visit she mentioned that she had even gone for coffee with some coworkers and I tried not to pay attention to what she had told me. The truth is that on my birthday she was at home and I also practically asked her please to come and see me because I would like to spend a little bit of my day with her, and since she was going to pass by these parts to I went to pick up my mother and I thought I could come a little earlier, even if it was just 5 minutes!!!

This unique gift can be revisited over the years, reminding both of you of the love you share.

How to Choose the Perfect Valentine Gift Based on Her Personality
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Choosing the perfect Valentine gift for your girlfriend can sometimes feel overwhelming. You want to find something that not only pleases her but also shows how much you care about her personality and interests. Knowing her personality traits will help you select a gift that resonates with her. Here’s a helpful guide to help you choose thoughtfully based on different personality types.

### Understanding Her Interests

Before you select a gift, think about her hobbies and interests. Is she into arts and crafts, technology, or perhaps fashion? Tailoring your gift to her passion can make it all the more special. Here are some examples:

- **Artistic Souls:** If she's creative, consider gifting her high-quality art supplies, a painting workshop experience, or a beautiful sketchbook.
- **Tech Lovers:** Gadgets are often a big hit. Think about wireless earbuds, a smartwatch, or a fun tech accessory.
- **Fashion Fans:** A stylish handbag or a piece of jewelry can delight those who love to express themselves through fashion.

### Determining Her Personality Type

Recognizing her personality type can guide your choice further. Here’s how you can categorize her and what gifts might fit each type:

#### 1. The Romantic

If she loves classic romance, consider gifts that evoke feelings and memories. Options could be:

- A heartfelt love letter or a poem.
- A personalized piece of jewelry.
- A romantic getaway or a picnic under the stars.

#### 2. The Adventurer

For the girlfriend who enjoys new experiences, select gifts that lead to adventure:

- A surprise weekend trip.
- Outdoor gear such as hiking poles or a personalized water bottle.
- Tickets for activities like skydiving or zip-lining.

#### 3. The Thoughtful One

If she tends to be more thoughtful and enjoys meaningful experiences, think about:

- A scrapbook of your memories together.
- A customized photo album from your time together.
- A charity donation made in her name.

### Consider Her Lifestyle

Her daily routine can also impact your gift choice. Here’s how to align your gift with her lifestyle:

#### 1. Busy Bee

If she has an on-the-go lifestyle, consider gifts that add convenience:

- A stylish planner to help keep her organized.
- A subscription service for meal kits.
- Quality skincare that’s simple to use.

#### 2. Homebody

For the one who loves staying cozy at home, lean towards gifts that enhance comfort:

- Soft blankets or luxurious pajamas.
- A fun board game or puzzle you can enjoy together.
- A set of her favorite teas or coffees.

### Thinking Outside the Box

Unique and personalized gifts can be quite memorable. Don't hesitate to venture outside conventional gift ideas. Consider the following:

- A customized star map showcasing the night sky on a special date.
- Personalized cooking classes, especially if she loves to cook.
- A handcrafted item from local artisans that reflects her taste.

### Final Touches

Sometimes, how you present the gift can be just as important as the gift itself. Make sure to:

- Wrap it beautifully or use an innovative packaging style.
- Include a personal note explaining why you chose the gift.
- Plan a special moment to give it to her, ensuring it aligns with the vibe.

Ultimately, the best Valentine gift for your girlfriend reflects her personality and your knowledge of her likes. With thoughtful consideration, you can choose something that she will cherish forever, making Valentine’s Day a celebration to remember.

### Conclusion

Finding the right Valentine gift for your girlfriend is about more than just the item itself; it’s a chance to show her how well you know her and how much you care. By exploring creative and unique gift ideas, you can surprise her with something that stands out. Whether it’s a personalized piece of art, a custom piece of jewelry, or an experience that you can share together, the goal is to make her feel cherished and understood.

Remember, choosing the perfect gift means considering her personality. Is she adventurous, or does she prefer cozy nights in? Does she love surprises, or is she more practical? Tailoring your choice to her interests not only shows that you are attentive but also that you value her unique traits. This thoughtful approach will help you select a gift that resonates with her, allowing the gesture to deeply connect with her feelings.

As you prepare for this Valentine’s Day, take the time to reflect on your girlfriend's likes and dislikes. Let your ideas flow freely and don’t shy away from being creative. The right gift, one that reflects her individuality and your relationship, can turn an ordinary day into an extraordinary memory. So, go ahead, make it a Valentine’s Day she'll never forget by giving a gift filled with love, consideration, and a touch of your unique flair.

DAY TRIP TO MATERUNI WATERFALL AND COFFEE TOUR
A tour to Materuni Village and Waterfalls is a great way to spend a day away from the bustle of town life. The walk to Materuni Waterfall offers a glimpse into the nature of Tanzania allowing you either to prepare your body for the forthcoming climb to Kilimanjaro or ease your muscles after the climb.

The tour starts with a walk to Materuni Waterfall. It is an opportunity to see how local fruit like avocados, mangos, lemons, and bananas grow, as well as learn some of the local history, traditions, village economy, agricultural and cultural life. When you get to the waterfall, you can refresh yourself in the natural pool, so swimsuits will come in handy!

The tour will continue with a visit to the local village lying in the coffee plantations. The villagers will demonstrate the process of coffee farming and guide you through the preparation of coffee from a bean to a cup. Sing and dance along with the Chaga people as they are grinding, roasting and boiling the beans. When the coffee is ready, villagers will serve lunch - a national Chagga meal.

I was provided with a token and was asked to wait until the token number was called. Coffee/Drinks was available. Waited for only 10minutes before token number was called. Provided all documents in the order VFS officials asked. Slight issue came up regarding my location proof, due my employee status. Bonafide certificate mentioned my working location as from Mumbai (which is where the HQ is located). However payslips helped, as it mentioned the correct work-location. After submission, was asked to wait for biometrics. Had to wait around 30-45mins before called up again and was done with the process.

I enquired if the sponsorship letter wasn't enough. They replied unless the sponsor is a resident of Germany, sponsor letter will not count.  Either I had to add additional amount in the block account or send the tuition fee to university. Until then, the visa application would be hold status.

Well...

We were customers making weekly buys!  
That should suffice. Period. 

It meant we were buying on a mandatory schedule *even if we wouldn't have purchased due to the BTC/ETH price.*

That doesn't make everyone a ""user"" taking advantage of SP as some bootlickers have written;  it makes us  _customers_  who *gave them our money, week after week.*
   

Further, *Maybe we like using our other credit cards*  for any combination of:

1. Better reward %
  
2. Easier accounting for BTC tax reasons

3. Prefer a physical card

And 

4. Maybe we travel and/or work remotely where there's no possibility of retail use for weeks at a time.

4 forces some to now buy online some GC at a minimum of $5-10 for something they may or may not have planned to spend. 

It's forced, manufactured spending to generate fees. 


Frankly, I'm concerned about SP's ability to stay solvent.
Why? 
  
Think about this:
  
They have:

1.  Cut SATS;
  
2.  The SATS reset is now way down at 21;
  
3.  The growth of SATS used to be 5 or 10 a day at least, now 1...3... once in a while 5;
  
4.  SATS rewards used to increase daily, but now they hover at the same amount for 2-3 days.

I've moved all crypto off SP, and I'm minimizing cash held to prevent *possible* losses. 

We're the frogs in the slowly boiling water. 

Finally, SP's official announcements and couple of replies here are consistently arrogant, top-down culture, tone-deaf blurbs.

Of course, many of us are soured on SP now.

1ihsr2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketingagency/comments/1ihsr2a/my_situation/,My Situation,"Grab a coffee because this is kind of a long one... lol. Two questions at the end.

I started my business as a side hustle, helping solopreneurs get up and running. I wasn't a master of anything specific, but I had background with a variety of areas of marketing (SEO, social media, influencers, email, website building, etc), and could do all of these things relatively effectively. These clients loved that I functioned this way because it was very affordable (had no idea what to price myself at at the time, so I charged $18/hr - yikes!) and they got someone who knew at least a little bit of different areas of marketing.

Anyway, my business has since grown and I'm starting to work with small businesses that make millions each year. I charge more than I did, but it's still just me at my little business and I am getting spread thin. I am someone who values down time and needs to recharge; ideally I wouldn't be working as much as I am, which is why I've had to turn down several large companies who wanted to work together. I know lots of successful people say work as hard as you can now and you'll be able to enjoy more free time later, but I do my best work when I have some time to think, and I do like when I am able to go to concert or book club every once in a while instead of working after dinner and weekends and such.

I'm getting very burnt out. I think some of the issue is that I have still been implementing the same ""generalist"" strategy, so I'm being pulled in a million directions by completely different industries all at once. Again, the clients I work with really seem to like this generalist approach.

But even my discovery calls are messy because they'll ask what I do and I have to kind of be like ""uhhh... everything?""

I would like to niche down to something like just SEO or just social media marketing, but I feel like my competitive advantage is that I do it all. Let's say I decide to become just an SEO agency, only three of my clients use my recurring SEO services. If I go with just email marketing, it would be another two. So I would lose a biiig chunk no matter what direction I go in. They all have a different combination of services.

I feel very stuck and am not sure where to go from here. I figured this was the place to ask it. I really do enjoy helping small businesses and want to continue with this, but I don't know how to proceed.

Option 1 - Pick a niche; become a specialist; be able to sell myself better, have better processes, training an employee would be easier, etc. BUT lose a chunk of clients and take a huge cut to monthly income for at least several months if I had to guess.

Option 2 - Continue with the 'generalist' approach, but bring someone else on who would also be able to be a generalist (I can't afford to hire multiple specialists at this time, so I'd need just one person) BUT it's hard to find good talent from my experience and I worry that I would stil be burnt out and overwhelmed being pulled in so many directions.

Option 3 - Provide more value so I can charge current clients more, reclaim my time, while staying a generalist BUT some clients wouldn't pay more and would drop me and/or I'd still be pulled in lots of places at once; would also need better tracking and reporting (see below)

If option 3, one thing I really really struggle with is tracking the data. I use GA4, Ahrefs, Metrics on Socials, etc. to get the clients the information they need. But I feel like I'm going in a million places to get various data, and sometimes the data doesn't line up with what another platform says. I have purchased Agency Analytics for clients, and while most are happy with it, there are several who want to know exactly how many people came from Google and filled out a contact form; how many people booked on Calendly from each FB ad, etc. I don't know how to use Google Tag Manager or any of that stuff.



OK that was complete jargon, but need to get this out so I can get back to work ;)

  
Thank you for reading this. This is my first business and lots of my friends and family are not on board with it and don't have faith, so their advice is to give up. I figured this is the place to ask.



The questions I have are essentially:

1. What direction should I take my business? Any advice from the trenches? Horror stories? Words of wisdom?

2. If anyone knows anything about tracking and/or presenting data, please message me. I've watched countless videos, but I can't wrap my head around setting up UTMs and such.",1,1738703781.0,marketingagency,0,0.67,False

That all changed soon after my first positive, and I haven't had a 'normal' bowel movement since. 

But I've never experienced anything like I did this morning. I was stranded on the toilet for 45 minutes, fighting for my life. To put it simply (and lightly) my body was in *go mode*, but my BM was in *hell no mode*. I tried again once I got to work after drinking my coffee and eating some raspberries and had to retreat again, because my entire body was shaking from the pain. Needless to say, it's all one big hemorrhoid down there right now.

I'm working on a feature piece (possibly a Day in the Life) about delivery drivers rights and safety. I'm hoping to explore personal identity and the hustle of food delivery in one of the busiest cities in the world. How has congestion pricing affected the number of orders you receive? Are customers more or less willing to tip as a result of the added cost? Why are you working as a delivery driver, and what does that work look like on a day to day basis? Do you have access to an up to date e bike model and batteries?

1ihsodb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ihsodb,"Need help with living room pillows, rugs, and overall cohesion","I am in the process of redesigning our living room, which is a small space. We are planning on keeping the existing couch and coffee table, but want to replace everything else. The two chairs in the mockup were ordered this week. 

The swivel chair isn't as white as it appears (nomad snow crypton fabric), and I would say the lounge chair is less vibrant in person (lush moss crypton fabric). The green chair will be positioned on the left side of the TV, and the offwhite swivel chair will be on the right side. We will clear out that right side entirely, and get rid of the pew. 

We want earthy tones (dark green, clay, dark gray, offwhite). However, I struggle with pulling everything together using the rug and pillows. I do web design for work, which is very different from interior design, I've found. 

The pillow arrangement on the couch (mock-up) is my first attempt incorporating the green velvet used on the chair, different textures, and patterns. It feels a little too ""matchy"", so I was hoping to get some ideas from the community. Playing around with different sizes, patterns, textures, shapes, and colors is something I'm stuff learning. I'm absolutely not attached to the rug or pillows. 

The chair fabrics are locked in, and we can have custom pillows made, utilizing those fabrics, if that is desirable. 

You can probably tell we're going with a mid century modern vibe, and want our rug and pillows to reflect that. May be worth mentioning that there will be some greenery added from plants",1,1738703594.0,DesignMyRoom,0,1.0,False

1ihsm5j,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ihsm5j/my_18f_mom_45f_is_obsessed_with_my_eating/,"My (18F) mom (45F) is obsessed with my eating disorder, how do I stop getting falsely accused?","I’m really not sure what else to do at this point so I’m here. This is very far out there but if anyone’s been in a similar position I need advice. I’m not sure if this is exactly a relationship issue but it’s making me resent my mom and I really don’t want to hate her.

I’m 18 and my parents are in their mid 40s. I’ve had pica my whole life, but it got serious when I turned 12. It used to be crayons or lego in elementary, then it became sweater sleeves and shirt collars as I got older. It wasn’t something to really pay attention to, I wouldn’t cause too much damage. But when I turned 12 I guess something changed mentally and I was actually eating stuff, and ripping things open to do so. Think pillow stuffing and fabrics. I’d cut stuff up and keep it in a hiding spot to eat later. I was almost insatiable at that point. This went on for years. When I turned 16 I started to manage my urges better, but to this day it’s difficult.

My mom has done so much to help me, she’s put me in therapy, found alternatives and bought me supplements. When she first found out what I was doing, she didn’t handle it in the best way (yelling and treating me like some kind of monster). Later on she softened up. I think because pica is so rare and so strange she panicked and thought the best thing to do was to shame me out of it. That just made me sneakier. As time went on, I matured and put in the effort to control my urges, which is the most I can do right now because I’m not in therapy anymore and medicine is expensive. It’s been working for the most part, but sometimes I’d slip up. I’d tell myself that recovery isn’t linear and all that, because it feels like an addiction more than anything and I’ve really been struggling. But if my mom sees evidence that I’ve gone back, she goes ballistic. She’ll yell, throw things and punish me. I never truly minded because the things I’d eat were things she bought (pillows, comforters, dish sponges) so it would make sense for her to be angry about her property getting destroyed. However, it’s really affected me mentally. I’m afraid to seek help, even as an adult and god forbid I open up to any friends or other family. 

Lately, my mom’s been obsessing over my pica. When it was at its worst, I understood the need for random room searches, frisking and watching my every move to make sure I didn’t ruin anything. But this is getting ridiculous. It started with the bath towels. There’d be random loose strings and strips of thread ripped which was odd but with the amount of laundry we do every week I assured my mom that it was probably that and definitely not me. She calmed down for a bit but every once in a while she’d find a loose thread and scold me. It was tiring, but towels made sense for me to eat, as they’re soft and easy to tear apart. I never touched them though, that was my main issue. She’d bring up new comforters she bought, TV remotes, and her own socks that went missing. Some of the things she’d blame me for didn’t make sense, like pots and pans. I know my habits better than anyone, but for her, if I could eat a dish sponge then I was capable of consuming anything non-edible, which isn’t how it works. I’ve tried explaining this, but she never listens to me. She always brings up the same example, “if a person is known to be a thief and something goes missing, it only makes sense to blame the thief”. This only made sense when I’d slip up. But this doesn’t happen anymore so the example only proves that my mom doesn’t believe in redemption which is so *so* annoying to deal with. I know it was a huge issue when I was younger but c’mon.

Anyway, right now, it’s the tables, chairs, door frames, and just anything made of wood that gets scratches. She genuinely believes that when no one’s home/everyone’s asleep, I sneak into the living room and drag my teeth across everything. Which to me is absolutely absurd. I’m just so tired of being blamed for natural occurrences and I want it to end. Yesterday, it happened again and I started going off on her. She was swearing on herself that it was me, which in my culture is very serious. That’s basically suicide if it turns out you’re lying. Obviously she won’t actually get struck by lightning but that just goes to show how much she believes it’s me doing all these things. I blew up at her and called her insane. She didn’t like that very much, so she told my dad and I got a stern talking to. 

I don’t believe this is fair at all. I’ve been trying for months to convince my mom that I’ve changed and that I’m innocent but it’s no use. We’ll have a heart to heart (or I guess heart to wall) conversation and she’ll say that she believes me and that she’ll stop and all is fine and dandy until she notices a new scratch on the coffee table or something. I don’t know what to do. I need to move out, as this is seriously affecting my mental health but I literally have no money and no job. I can get a job this summer in between classes but that’ll be months away, and who knows what my mom will be fixated on by then. I’m just so tired, everyone in my family is tired but my mom just won’t stop finding things to blame me for. This feels like a mental illness but I’m not going to diagnose her and she won’t seek therapy. 

So, is there anything left to do? Do I just tough it out? I’m at the end of my rope here. This disorder is so embarrassing but with my mom around I can never escape it. I just wanna be in peace.",1,1738703442.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

I usually associate coconut in coffee with added flavoring, so I was initially suspect of how it would come out. But in the brew it came through as a delicious piña colada taste. It almost felt creamy, much like a coconut dessert. I will definitely buy a bag.

My recipe for all the DAK beans was 85 clicks on a 1Zpresso K-Ultra, 202F in a V60, ratio of 1:15, with a total of four pours. I don't remember from where I got this recipe, but it hit all the tasting notes across the brews.

1ihsfq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ihsfq4/my_mom_is_obsessed_with_my_eating_disorder_how_do/,"My mom is obsessed with my eating disorder, how do I stop getting falsely accused?","I’m really not sure what else to do at this point so I’m here. This is very far out there but if anyone’s been in a similar position I need advice.

I’m 18 and my parents are in their mid 40s. I’ve had pica my whole life, but it got serious when I turned 12. It used to be crayons or lego in elementary, then it became sweater sleeves and shirt collars as I got older. It wasn’t something to really pay attention to, I wouldn’t cause too much damage. But when I turned 12 I guess something changed mentally and I was actually eating stuff, and ripping things open to do so. Think pillow stuffing and fabrics. I’d cut stuff up and keep it in a hiding spot to eat later. I was almost insatiable at that point. This went on for years. When I turned 16 I started to manage my urges better, but to this day it’s difficult.

My mom has done so much to help me, she’s put me in therapy, found alternatives and bought me supplements. When she first found out what I was doing, she didn’t handle it in the best way (yelling and treating me like some kind of monster). Later on she softened up. I think because pica is so rare and so strange she panicked and thought the best thing to do was to shame me out of it. That just made me sneakier. As time went on, I matured and put in the effort to control my urges, which is the most I can do right now because I’m not in therapy anymore and medicine is expensive. It’s been working for the most part, but sometimes I’d slip up. I’d tell myself that recovery isn’t linear and all that, because it feels like an addiction more than anything and I’ve really been struggling. But if my mom sees evidence that I’ve gone back, she goes ballistic. She’ll yell, throw things and punish me. I never truly minded because the things I’d eat were things she bought (pillows, comforters, dish sponges) so it would make sense for her to be angry about her property getting destroyed. However, it’s really affected me mentally. I’m afraid to seek help, even as an adult and god forbid I open up to any friends or other family. 

Lately, my mom’s been obsessing over my pica. When it was at its worst, I understood the need for random room searches, frisking and watching my every move to make sure I didn’t ruin anything. But this is getting ridiculous. It started with the bath towels. There’d be random loose strings and strips of thread ripped which was odd but with the amount of laundry we do every week I assured my mom that it was probably that and definitely not me. She calmed down for a bit but every once in a while she’d find a loose thread and scold me. It was tiring, but towels made sense for me to eat, as they’re soft and easy to tear apart. I never touched them though, that was my main issue. She’d bring up new comforters she bought, TV remotes, and her own socks that went missing. Some of the things she’d blame me for didn’t make sense, like pots and pans. I know my habits better than anyone, but for her, if I could eat a dish sponge then I was capable of consuming anything non-edible, which isn’t how it works. I’ve tried explaining this, but she never listens to me. She always brings up the same example, “if a person is known to be a thief and something goes missing, it only makes sense to blame the thief”. This only made sense when I’d slip up. But this doesn’t happen anymore so the example only proves that my mom doesn’t believe in redemption which is so *so* annoying to deal with. I know it was a huge issue when I was younger but c’mon.

Anyway, right now, it’s the tables, chairs, door frames, and just anything made of wood that gets scratches. She genuinely believes that when no one’s home/everyone’s asleep, I sneak into the living room and drag my teeth across everything. Which to me is absolutely absurd. I’m just so tired of being blamed for natural occurrences and I want it to end. Yesterday, it happened again and I started going off on her. She was swearing on herself that it was me, which in my culture is very serious. That’s basically suicide if it turns out you’re lying. Obviously she won’t actually get struck by lightning but that just goes to show how much she believes it’s me doing all these things. I blew up at her and called her insane. She didn’t like that very much, so she told my dad and I got a stern talking to. 

I don’t believe this is fair at all. I’ve been trying for months to convince my mom that I’ve changed and that I’m innocent but it’s no use. We’ll have a heart to heart (or I guess heart to wall) conversation and she’ll say that she believes me and that she’ll stop and all is fine and dandy until she notices a new scratch on the coffee table or something. I don’t know what to do. I need to move out, as this is seriously affecting my mental health but I literally have no money and no job. I can get a job this summer in between classes but that’ll be months away, and who knows what my mom will be fixated on by then. I’m just so tired, everyone in my family is tired but my mom just won’t stop finding things to blame me for. This feels like a mental illness but I’m not going to diagnose her and she won’t seek therapy. 

So, is there anything left to do? Do I just tough it out? I’m at the end of my rope here. This disorder is so embarrassing but with my mom around I can never escape it. I just wanna be in peace.",1,1738703007.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

- private bathroom that we share. there’s a bathtub, and sink outside.
- we have private rooms. a lot of BU apartment have really weird floor plans. with my floor plan, each person has their own room, so no living in the common space.

EDIT: To all the people who are saying that this is fictional, it's his job, etc. 
Yes, Mark has a PhD in machine learning techniques in bioimage analysis. I do a bit of image analysis in my research too, but I don't use ML techniques, which is why he thinks my analysis is flawed. It's not that he's wrong -- he's just complaining that I didn't analyze the data properly. I mean that's such a generic comment and telling people they need to use ML whether they require it or not is BS. He's just a postdoc in the lab I work in. My PI and committe members are required to provided advice. but I don't understand why he has to.


So, I just had the most infuriating experiance at work, and I need to vent.  I've been busting my butt on this research for what feels like forever.  I finally get to present my findings in a meeting, and guess who decides to mansplain me?  This postdoc Mark who thinks he knows everything.



I'm up there, trying to explain my work, and halfway through, he just jumps in with this condescending tone, like, ""You know, it's really important to consider the broader implications of your data.""  Like, excuse me?  I've literally spent months analyzing every single detail.  I wanted to roll my eyes so hard they'd get stuck.



After the meeting, I'm packing up my stuff, and he comes over with that smug look on his face.  He says, ""You did okay, but I think you could really benfit from my perspective.""  Ugh!  I mean, seriously?  I'm not some clueless undergrad who needs his ""expert"" advice.  I can't even with this guy.



He leans in way too close, and I can smell his coffee breath - gross.  He keeps going on about how I should let him help with my analysis because he has ""a lot of experiance.""  Like, dude, I'm the one with the PhD in progress here!  I felt like I was stuck in some bad sitcom where the guy just doesn't get it.



I walked away feeling so frustrated.  It's exausting dealing with this kind of crap.  I've worked so hard to get where I am, and here's this guy trying to belittle me just because he thinks he's superior.  I know my stuff, and I'm not going to let him or anyone else make me feel less than.  But man, it's just so disheartening to deal with this kind of harrasment in a professional setting.  Can't a girl catch a break?  Thanks for listening to me vent.

1ihsbhs,https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonSleep/comments/1ihsbhs/i_calculated_the_overall_efficiency_of_the_top/,I calculated the overall efficiency of the top recipes,"It's pretty easy to find a list of which recipes have the highest base strength, but just because they have high strength doesn't necessarily mean they are worth the time it takes to get the required ingredients. So I made a spreadsheet to calculate the overall efficiency of each dish by dividing the base strength by the overall time it would take to gather the ingredients. The spreadsheet can be found here  
[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H6P-866PQXeUNqWmJdgXBoYJsZsgHddI8EKM-uqZ5M8/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H6P-866PQXeUNqWmJdgXBoYJsZsgHddI8EKM-uqZ5M8/edit?usp=sharing)

The total ingredient time was calculated by dividing the required ingredients by the hourly production rate of the Pokemon that has the highest production rate of that ingredient (those numbers were found by using the level 60 values of this part of raenox here [https://pks.raenonx.cc/en/ingredient](https://pks.raenonx.cc/en/ingredient) )

Overall, it turns out that the recipes are pretty well balanced, but there are a few that stand out as being the most efficient. The winner for salads was Coffee Salad, desserts was Corn Scones, and Curries was Keema Curry, which was also the overall winner. (mono herb Dragonite is very good at farming herbs)

Of course I'm not trying to say that you should never make the lower rated dishes, I just thought it might be interesting to see the data. The actually efficiency of the dishes will vary greatly depending on your own Pokemon, and there are some imperfections with this spreadsheet. I only calculated things using the production rate for each individual ingredient, which is a bit unfair for ingredients like leeks since there is no mono leek farmer. That means dishes like Ninja Salad and Ninja Curry are ranked lower than they should be, because in practice you would be able to use both the Leeks and the Soybeans from Quaquaval to make the dish; instead of just the leeks like the spreadsheet is calculating.

My throat was incredibly sore and everything simply hurt. Now today, I have the fatigue, the slight sore throat, and gastrointestinal issues. 

I’ve not talked to my doctor about MCAS mostly because I just haven’t had the money/time to go, but is this potentially an MCAS flare?

I took Benadryl last night and it made me feel way better so I could finally sleep, and then I woke up in the middle of the night feeling bad again and took more Benadryl and was fine. This morning I felt better, not great, but now as the evening is rolling around i’m feeling ill again. I KNEWWWW better than to eat the foods I did. I knew. I know now too. But it’s been so hard to stay consistent and not have the things I enjoy. It just takes some folks a long time learning the hard way lol. 

Editing to add: I also incorporated about 40 min of exercise 5 days a week all of January, and some time factors have caused me to have to cut back on that the last week. When I went after skipping two days, I felt like I was going to pass out even with a fairly simple weight workout. That was Saturday and I haven’t been back to the gym since (it’s Tuesday now)",2,1738702737.0,MCAS,1,1.0,False

She is currently pursuing hers in the state of Utah. Our first date, i couldn't have imagined going better. We planned to just hang at a local bar and have drinks and chat. It turned into a 7 hour date that was incredible. I already knew right there, I was in love. We had so much fun, we drank, danced, talked about the world problems and more.... It already seemed destined to be. Fast forward, I am allegedly the best boyfriend she has ever had, even her wife cannot believe it(open). No guy has been this great, and sweet, and wonderful. I do/did my best. I enjoy being sweet to my partner(s). I have never had a woman have such a hold on my heart before. My heart still hurts months later. I am an advocate for human rights, trying to help the environment more, and fighting for those that can't always fight for themselves. I was sober for a month of our relationship, and we were so fucking good together. I was myself, jolly, silly, fun, and so supportive of everything. It sucks so bad. I thought I was good to drink again, I was not, I became so lonely and depressed and down spiraled. Our last ""date"" together... I was out with her and her wife thrifting. I thought it was all great! But then we got brunch and I fucked it all up. I paid for the bill, but I didnt order my own stuff, I thought we could all share, and I was not only doing mimosas, but shots too, at 11 am. The next day, I was invited to coffee, and a breakup. I lost it. I left, and drowned myself in alcohol. I didnt eat for 4 days. I lost 10 pounds(5%) of my body weight in that time. I have tried saving the relationship, and I am currently sober, I've overall lost 12 pounds since because of healthy diet and working out, I wanted to turn that negative into a positive. I've love this girl more than anything, I am sorry that alcohol won those past battles and will not ever again. 1 month strong in a life of sobriety off alcohol. To the person that said they were the queen of giving second chances..... who said I was by far the best, sweetest, amazing boyfriend they ever had. They never gave me an ultimatum, or a second chance. But here I am, fixing myself, being sober and being the best I can be. I really wish and hope the best for everyone in this thread. I like to think my heart will heal, but I do not think it ever will again. I'll do my best to help those in need and support groups that need it. People deserve a second chance, especially is they show it and work hard for it. Just so you know, someone loves you dearly, please hug them. <3",2,1738702597.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1ihs932,https://www.reddit.com/r/JustNotRight/comments/1ihs932/my_dog_smells_like_cigarettes_but_i_dont_smoke/,"My Dog Smells Like Cigarettes, But I Don’t Smoke","Chapter One: Moving In

The house wasn’t anything special. Two bedrooms, a laundry room that smelled like detergent and old wood, a backyard big enough for Ace to run around in. It was the kind of place you rented when you didn’t have the money for something better but still wanted a place to call your own. A fixer-upper, as the landlord had called it. But as far as I could tell, nothing really needed fixing.
Except the chimney.

""Previous owner sealed it up years ago,"" the landlord had mentioned offhandedly during the walk-through. 

""Best to just leave it alone.""

I barely registered the comment at the time. I didn’t care about the chimney. I wasn’t the kind of person who sat in front of a fire with a glass of whiskey, contemplating life. If anything, I liked that it was sealed up. Less maintenance.

Ace had taken to the place immediately. He ran through every room like he was cataloging them, sniffing every inch, claiming every corner. A mutt with a bruiser’s build—part pit, part shepherd, part Rottweiler—he was the kind of dog that looked like trouble but was more likely to curl up next to you than bite.

""Feels weird,"" 
my girlfriend had said when she first stepped inside, her arms crossed as she scanned the walls. 
""Like… I don’t know. Old.""

""It is old,"" I said. ""That’s kind of the point. Cheap rent.""

She made a face, but didn’t push it. She wasn’t the type to argue over things that didn’t really matter.
She didn’t move in with me, but she stayed over more often than not. I liked having her around. Even when she was quiet, there was something grounding about her presence. Like an anchor to reality, a reminder that even if I was alone in this place, I wasn’t actually alone.

That first night was restless. Not because anything happened, but because I couldn’t quite shake the feeling that I’d forgotten something. Like when you leave the house and feel like your keys aren’t in your pocket, even though they are.

Ace slept fine. I should’ve taken a lesson from him.

I didn’t think about the chimney again. I didn’t think about anything, really. It was just a house.

For now.

Chapter Two: The First Sign

It was a couple of days before I noticed the smell.

I was sitting on the couch, half-listening to a podcast while scrolling on my phone, when Ace climbed up next to me and flopped his head onto my lap. I scratched behind his ears absentmindedly, letting his weight settle against me. 
That’s when it hit me.

Cigarettes.

It was faint at first, subtle enough that I almost convinced myself I was imagining it. But the more I focused on it, the stronger it got—stale, acrid, like the inside of a car where someone had been chain-smoking for years.

I frowned, leaned in, and sniffed him properly. The smell was coming from his fur.

I pulled back, wrinkling my nose. ""Dude, what the hell?""

Ace thumped his tail against the couch, completely unbothered.

I scratched my head. He hadn’t been around anyone but me, and I didn’t smoke. Neither did my girlfriend. None of my friends did, either. The only people who came over vaped, and that didn’t leave a smell like this.

I ran my hands over his coat, checking for anything he might have rolled in. Nothing. Just the smell, clinging to him like a second skin.

""You roll around in someone’s ashtray outside?"" I muttered, rubbing at my jeans where the scent had transferred. 

I didn’t think much of it. Dogs got into weird shit all the time. Maybe someone had thrown a cigarette butt into the yard, and he’d brushed up against it.

Still, it bugged me.

That evening, my girlfriend came over. She had this habit of coming in without knocking, kicking off her shoes in the doorway like she’d lived here for years. I liked that about her. Made the place feel a little less empty.

Ace trotted up to greet her, and she crouched down to scratch under his chin. ""Hey, big guy. Miss me?""

I watched, waiting for her to react, to pull back from the smell. She didn’t.

""You smell that?"" I asked, standing up.

She glanced at me. ""Smell what?""

""He reeks like cigarettes.""

She frowned, leaning in to sniff him. Then she made a face. ""Ew. Gross.""

""Right?"" I said. ""I have no idea where he got it from.""
She wiped her hands on her jeans and stood up. 

""You should give him a bath.""

That was it. No questions. No curiosity. Just an offhanded suggestion before she walked into the kitchen to grab a drink. She didn’t even seem that bothered by it.

I hesitated, feeling weirdly disappointed by that. Like I was the only one who noticed something was off.

That night, I woke up feeling watched.
Not in a paranoid way. Not in the way where you jolt up, convinced someone’s in the room with you. This was different.

It was the kind of feeling where you’re sure someone’s looking at you, even if you can’t see them. Like an itch between your shoulders, a weight on your chest, something just outside your field of vision that refuses to reveal itself.

I turned over, and my eyes landed on Ace. He was asleep at the foot of my bed, breathing steady, chest rising and falling in deep, even rhythms. 

He wasn’t looking at me. But something else was.

I stared at the darkened corners of the room, half-expecting to see something staring back.

Nothing.

Just shadows. Just my own shitty imagination.

I rolled onto my back and forced my eyes shut, willing myself to ignore it.

It was just a feeling.

But it stayed with me long after I finally fell asleep.

Chapter Three: The Chimney Stirs

The cigarette smell was stronger the next morning.
I didn’t notice it right away, not until I was pouring my coffee and Ace brushed against my leg. It hit me then—sharp, stale, like old smoke trapped in fabric.

""Dude,"" I muttered, stepping back. ""It’s worse.""

Ace yawned like he couldn’t care less.

I crouched down and sniffed again, just to be sure. It was definitely stronger. Not overpowering, but noticeable. Like he’d spent the night in a chain-smoking competition and lost on a technicality.

I rubbed my face and stood up. 

""Guess it’s bath time.""

Ace groaned in protest but didn’t move. Lazy bastard.

I was getting towels from the laundry room when I heard it.

A whistle.

Not a melody, not an intentional tune—just a faint, breathy sound, like air squeezing through a narrow gap. Like someone pursing their lips but not quite blowing.
I froze. It came from inside the wall.

The laundry room was small, just enough space for the washer, dryer, and a few shelves. The chimney was in here, too—sealed up, forgotten. I barely ever thought about it.

But now, standing in front of it, I did.
I reached out and ran my fingers over the bricks. They felt wrong.

Not bad. Not cursed. Just... off.
Some spots were too smooth, like they had been worn down by years of touch. Others were rough, almost jagged. The texture wasn’t consistent, like the bricks hadn’t all come from the same place.
I pressed my palm flat against it.
For a second, nothing happened.

Then—

A soft click.

The kind of sound a lock makes when it shifts slightly, not unlocking but adjusting.
I pulled my hand back fast.
The laundry room was still. Too still.
The whistle didn’t come again.
Ace was waiting in the hallway when I stepped out, watching me.

I hesitated. ""You hear that?""
He blinked once. Then, slowly, he turned and walked away.

Not scared. Not spooked. Just... there.
Like he had already made peace with whatever it was.

Chapter Four: The First Transfer

It was late when I let Ace outside.
The air was thick and warm, clinging to my skin like an extra layer I didn’t ask for. Crickets hummed from the grass, distant, rhythmic, indifferent. Ace trotted onto the lawn, stretching once before shaking his fur, shedding the weight of the house like it had been pressing down on him.

The second he stepped out, I knew something was wrong.

The smell didn’t leave with him.
It should have. Every time before, Ace had been the one carrying it. But now, as I stood in the doorway, the smell of cigarettes was still here. Still around me.
Then the dread hit.

Not the kind of fear that spikes in your chest and fades. This was heavier. Suffocating. Like stepping into a room where the air was too thick to breathe. Like something was waiting. Watching. Pressing in from all sides.
The entire house smelled like it now. The furniture, the walls, the air itself—like I was inside the smell.
My hands clenched into fists. My legs locked up. Something was in here with me.
I forced myself to move, to shake off the feeling, but it stuck.

Then—Ace barked.
A single, sharp noise, cutting through the weight of it all. My head snapped up.
He was at the window, ears perked, staring at me. Not scared. Not panicked. Just focused.
Like he knew.

The second I unlocked the door, he bolted inside.
And just like that, the dread was gone.
Not faded. Not drained away.
Gone.

Like a switch flipped. Like it had never been there.
But the smell—the smell didn’t vanish instantly.
It weakened. Slowly. Like it was drifting, finding its way back to where it belonged.
Back to Ace.

I swallowed, staring at him as he trotted into the living room, circling once before lying down. Like nothing had happened.

But something had.

Something was wrong.

And for the first time, I looked at Ace a little longer than usual, my mind grasping for an explanation I didn’t want to find.

Chapter Five: The Unraveling

It started with small things.

Keys not where I left them. A cabinet door open when I knew I had closed it. A glass sitting in the sink when I hadn’t used one.

Little things. Things you could write off.
At first, I did.

Then it got weirder.

I came home one evening and found the TV on—playing static. The remote was on the coffee table, untouched. Ace was asleep on the couch, head on his paws.
I stood there for a long time, staring at the screen.
Ace didn’t move. Didn’t acknowledge it.
I shut the TV off.

The next night, I woke up to find my bedroom door open. I always slept with it closed.
Ace was on the floor, right where he always was. But the air in the room felt wrong.
Like I had just missed something.

Ace’s mood had changed, too. Not in a bad way, not in any way I could describe, really. He still acted like Ace. Still sat next to me when I watched TV, still greeted me at the door, still ran to the window every time he heard a car pass. But there was something behind his eyes.

A sharpness.

A knowing.

It made my stomach twist.
I tried to shake it off, but every time I looked at him, I felt like there was something I was ignoring to see.

I told my girlfriend everything that night. About the smell. The feeling. The whistle.
She didn’t brush me off. She sat next to me, pulled her knees up to her chest, and listened.
""I don’t know what to tell you,"" she said finally. ""I believe you. I just... I don’t know what to do about it.""
I exhaled. ""I don’t either.""
She reached for my hand. She didn’t have an answer, but at least she was here.

The whistle came again the next night.
Louder. Clearer.
Ace was in the living room with me when I heard it.

The chimney was empty.

But something was still inside.

Chapter Six: The Realization

It wasn’t Ace.

I don’t know when exactly I started to realize it. Maybe it had been sitting in the back of my head for a while, waiting for me to stop looking for the wrong answers. But once the thought surfaced, it refused to leave.

It wasn’t Ace.

The smell wasn’t on him. It was following him. Like a shadow, like something waiting for its turn to move.
The objects that had been shifting—they only moved when he was in the room. But not because of him. They moved when I wasn’t looking.

The whistle wasn’t tied to him, either. He had been in the living room with me when I heard it from the chimney.

And Ace? Ace had never been afraid. Not once.
Because whatever this was, he had always known it was there. He had been carrying it, living with it, taking it with him—until the night it stayed with me instead.
I watched him sleep that night. Not out of fear, not out of paranoia—but because I was waiting to feel that presence again.

It was different this time. The weight was on me now.
Ace slept peacefully, his breaths deep and steady. He didn’t feel it anymore.
Because I did.

I swallowed, shifting in bed. The air felt thick. Like the house was watching me.

I had spent days, maybe weeks, thinking the wrong thing. Thinking it was him. But he wasn’t the one changing.

It was.

The moment Ace had stepped outside that night, the entity had stayed with me. But when he came back in, he didn’t even hesitate for a second to take it back. It had let me feel everything Ace had been carrying this entire time. And I had blamed him for it.

I tensed my jaw and gritted me teeth, staring at the ceiling. It had never been Ace I needed to fear.

It had always been whatever was lingering around me now, shifting unseen through the space we shared.
And for the first time, I let myself see it for what it was.

Chapter Seven: The Breaking Point

I opened the door and let Ace out.

He hesitated for a moment, glancing back at me before stepping onto the grass. The moment he was outside, the air inside the house shifted.

The smell was suffocating.

Thick, clinging to my skin, sinking into my clothes. It wasn’t following Ace anymore. It had settled into me, like a new layer of existence, pressing against my ribs and weighing down my breath. It was inside the house now, inside me.

Ace stood outside now, staring at me through the open door. His ears twitched, but he didn’t move. He was willing to come back in—waiting for me to decide. He was giving me the choice.

I stepped forward, but my legs didn’t want to work. Every instinct screamed at me to stay, to let it consume me, to sink into it until I didn’t have to think anymore.
I forced myself to step forward, to push against the weight, against the thing clawing at my ribs. It fought me. But I fought harder.

The second I stepped outside, it was gone.
No smell. No weight. No presence.
The night air was cool against my skin, and for the first time in weeks, I felt like I could breathe.
I sucked in air, hands on my knees, staring at the ground. I was free.

Ace sat beside me, watching.
Then the thought hit me.

It didn’t leave.

My stomach twisted. It wasn’t gone—it was still inside.
And there was only one other person in there with it.
I turned back toward the house.
I lifted Ace over the fence first, placing him on the other side. He didn’t fight me. He just stared, waiting, watching.

I was supposed to run.

I almost did.

But I couldn’t leave her in there.

I pushed the door open. The second I stepped inside, the smell returned, punching the air from my lungs. The dread slithered back into my bones, wrapping itself around my spine.

She was sitting on the couch, one leg tucked under the other, scrolling through her phone like it was just another night. The glow from the screen lit up her face in soft blues and whites, casting shifting shadows that made her look like a memory I was already forgetting. For a split second, I wondered if she even knew I had walked back in. If she had felt the change in the air, the way the house had settled into something different. Or if she had been absorbed into it already, part of the emptiness.

""We have to go,"" I said, my voice hoarse. ""Now.""
She frowned. ""What?""

I couldn’t explain. I couldn’t make her understand. I just needed her to leave.

""I’m serious. I—"" I swallowed. ""I think we should break up.""

She blinked. ""Wait, what?""

""I need you to go. Now.""

Her expression twisted, hurt flashing across her face before hardening into something unreadable. I didn’t care. I just needed her to leave.

She grabbed her things without another word, shaking her head as she stormed toward the door.

I followed, watching, waiting—

The second she stepped through the threshold, Ace ran past me, bolting back inside.

I barely had time to register what was happening before she crossed the doorway.

And then—

The house exhaled.

Not a sound, not a movement, but something deeper, something felt in the marrow. Like the walls had been waiting for this exact moment. Like it had all been leading to this.

The air collapsed in on itself, folding, twisting, turning inside out. The space between seconds stretched and thinned, the room warping like light through heat. The doorway was no longer just a doorway. It was a threshold in the truest sense—a dividing line between what was real and what wasn’t.

My breath hitched. Something peeled away.
The walls bent. The floor trembled. Or maybe I did.
Ace was already inside, disappearing into the darkness as if he had never left at all. My girlfriend—she was still stepping through, her foot frozen midair like time had stuttered, like reality wasn’t sure how to let her leave.

And then it did.

She was gone.

And everything else went with her.

Chapter Eight: The Void

There was nothing.
No air, no walls, no ground beneath my feet. Just an absence so absolute that my body no longer felt like a body. I was here, but I wasn’t.

I tried to move, but there was nowhere to move to.
I tried to breathe, but there was nothing to breathe in.
There was only Ace.

He sat beside me—or maybe he didn’t. Maybe he was part of me now, or I was part of him. It didn’t matter. He was here. We were here.

I don’t know how long we stayed like that. A second? A thousand years? Time didn’t exist anymore, but we existed within it.

I held onto my name at first. My shape. My thoughts. But they were slipping, unraveling thread by thread, breaking down into something smaller, something quieter. Like I was dissolving into the nothing around me.

And Ace—he didn’t fight it.

Because he never had to.

He had always known. He had always accepted.
I think I laughed then, or maybe I cried. Or maybe I did neither. Maybe I just let go.

Ace shifted—or maybe I did. There was no difference anymore.

We weren’t separate. We weren’t anything.
We had always been here.

And somewhere, in the unraveling threads of my fading thoughts, I remembered thinking once—long ago, or maybe just a second ago—that the chimney wasn’t just a chimney.

Maybe you have too.

""Right?"" I said. ""I have no idea where he got it from.""
She wiped her hands on her jeans and stood up. 

""You should give him a bath.""

That was it. No questions. No curiosity. Just an offhanded suggestion before she walked into the kitchen to grab a drink. She didn’t even seem that bothered by it.

I hesitated, feeling weirdly disappointed by that. Like I was the only one who noticed something was off.

That night, I woke up feeling watched.
Not in a paranoid way. Not in the way where you jolt up, convinced someone’s in the room with you. This was different.

It was the kind of feeling where you’re sure someone’s looking at you, even if you can’t see them. Like an itch between your shoulders, a weight on your chest, something just outside your field of vision that refuses to reveal itself.

I turned over, and my eyes landed on Ace. He was asleep at the foot of my bed, breathing steady, chest rising and falling in deep, even rhythms. 

He wasn’t looking at me. But something else was.

I stared at the darkened corners of the room, half-expecting to see something staring back.

Nothing.

Just shadows. Just my own shitty imagination.

I rolled onto my back and forced my eyes shut, willing myself to ignore it.

It was just a feeling.

But it stayed with me long after I finally fell asleep.

Chapter Three: The Chimney Stirs

The cigarette smell was stronger the next morning.
I didn’t notice it right away, not until I was pouring my coffee and Ace brushed against my leg. It hit me then—sharp, stale, like old smoke trapped in fabric.

""Dude,"" I muttered, stepping back. ""It’s worse.""

Ace yawned like he couldn’t care less.

I crouched down and sniffed again, just to be sure. It was definitely stronger. Not overpowering, but noticeable. Like he’d spent the night in a chain-smoking competition and lost on a technicality.

I rubbed my face and stood up. 

""Guess it’s bath time.""

Ace groaned in protest but didn’t move. Lazy bastard.

I was getting towels from the laundry room when I heard it.

A whistle.

Not a melody, not an intentional tune—just a faint, breathy sound, like air squeezing through a narrow gap. Like someone pursing their lips but not quite blowing.
I froze. It came from inside the wall.

The laundry room was small, just enough space for the washer, dryer, and a few shelves. The chimney was in here, too—sealed up, forgotten. I barely ever thought about it.

But now, standing in front of it, I did.
I reached out and ran my fingers over the bricks. They felt wrong.

Not bad. Not cursed. Just... off.
Some spots were too smooth, like they had been worn down by years of touch. Others were rough, almost jagged. The texture wasn’t consistent, like the bricks hadn’t all come from the same place.
I pressed my palm flat against it.
For a second, nothing happened.

Then—

A soft click.

The kind of sound a lock makes when it shifts slightly, not unlocking but adjusting.
I pulled my hand back fast.
The laundry room was still. Too still.
The whistle didn’t come again.
Ace was waiting in the hallway when I stepped out, watching me.

I hesitated. ""You hear that?""
He blinked once. Then, slowly, he turned and walked away.

Not scared. Not spooked. Just... there.
Like he had already made peace with whatever it was.

Chapter Four: The First Transfer

It was late when I let Ace outside.
The air was thick and warm, clinging to my skin like an extra layer I didn’t ask for. Crickets hummed from the grass, distant, rhythmic, indifferent. Ace trotted onto the lawn, stretching once before shaking his fur, shedding the weight of the house like it had been pressing down on him.

The second he stepped out, I knew something was wrong.

The smell didn’t leave with him.
It should have. Every time before, Ace had been the one carrying it. But now, as I stood in the doorway, the smell of cigarettes was still here. Still around me.
Then the dread hit.

Not the kind of fear that spikes in your chest and fades. This was heavier. Suffocating. Like stepping into a room where the air was too thick to breathe. Like something was waiting. Watching. Pressing in from all sides.
The entire house smelled like it now. The furniture, the walls, the air itself—like I was inside the smell.
My hands clenched into fists. My legs locked up. Something was in here with me.
I forced myself to move, to shake off the feeling, but it stuck.

Then—Ace barked.
A single, sharp noise, cutting through the weight of it all. My head snapped up.
He was at the window, ears perked, staring at me. Not scared. Not panicked. Just focused.
Like he knew.

The second I unlocked the door, he bolted inside.
And just like that, the dread was gone.
Not faded. Not drained away.
Gone.

Like a switch flipped. Like it had never been there.
But the smell—the smell didn’t vanish instantly.
It weakened. Slowly. Like it was drifting, finding its way back to where it belonged.
Back to Ace.

I swallowed, staring at him as he trotted into the living room, circling once before lying down. Like nothing had happened.

But something had.

Something was wrong.

And for the first time, I looked at Ace a little longer than usual, my mind grasping for an explanation I didn’t want to find.

Chapter Five: The Unraveling

It started with small things.

Keys not where I left them. A cabinet door open when I knew I had closed it. A glass sitting in the sink when I hadn’t used one.

Little things. Things you could write off.
At first, I did.

Then it got weirder.

I came home one evening and found the TV on—playing static. The remote was on the coffee table, untouched. Ace was asleep on the couch, head on his paws.
I stood there for a long time, staring at the screen.
Ace didn’t move. Didn’t acknowledge it.
I shut the TV off.

The next night, I woke up to find my bedroom door open. I always slept with it closed.
Ace was on the floor, right where he always was. But the air in the room felt wrong.
Like I had just missed something.

Ace’s mood had changed, too. Not in a bad way, not in any way I could describe, really. He still acted like Ace. Still sat next to me when I watched TV, still greeted me at the door, still ran to the window every time he heard a car pass. But there was something behind his eyes.

A sharpness.

A knowing.

It made my stomach twist.
I tried to shake it off, but every time I looked at him, I felt like there was something I was ignoring to see.

I told my girlfriend everything that night. About the smell. The feeling. The whistle.
She didn’t brush me off. She sat next to me, pulled her knees up to her chest, and listened.
""I don’t know what to tell you,"" she said finally. ""I believe you. I just... I don’t know what to do about it.""
I exhaled. ""I don’t either.""
She reached for my hand. She didn’t have an answer, but at least she was here.

The whistle came again the next night.
Louder. Clearer.
Ace was in the living room with me when I heard it.

The chimney was empty.

But something was still inside.

Chapter Six: The Realization

It wasn’t Ace.

I don’t know when exactly I started to realize it. Maybe it had been sitting in the back of my head for a while, waiting for me to stop looking for the wrong answers. But once the thought surfaced, it refused to leave.

It wasn’t Ace.

The smell wasn’t on him. It was following him. Like a shadow, like something waiting for its turn to move.
The objects that had been shifting—they only moved when he was in the room. But not because of him. They moved when I wasn’t looking.

The whistle wasn’t tied to him, either. He had been in the living room with me when I heard it from the chimney.

And Ace? Ace had never been afraid. Not once.
Because whatever this was, he had always known it was there. He had been carrying it, living with it, taking it with him—until the night it stayed with me instead.
I watched him sleep that night. Not out of fear, not out of paranoia—but because I was waiting to feel that presence again.

It was different this time. The weight was on me now.
Ace slept peacefully, his breaths deep and steady. He didn’t feel it anymore.
Because I did.

I swallowed, shifting in bed. The air felt thick. Like the house was watching me.

I had spent days, maybe weeks, thinking the wrong thing. Thinking it was him. But he wasn’t the one changing.

It was.

The moment Ace had stepped outside that night, the entity had stayed with me. But when he came back in, he didn’t even hesitate for a second to take it back. It had let me feel everything Ace had been carrying this entire time. And I had blamed him for it.

I tensed my jaw and gritted me teeth, staring at the ceiling. It had never been Ace I needed to fear.

It had always been whatever was lingering around me now, shifting unseen through the space we shared.
And for the first time, I let myself see it for what it was.

Chapter Seven: The Breaking Point

I opened the door and let Ace out.

He hesitated for a moment, glancing back at me before stepping onto the grass. The moment he was outside, the air inside the house shifted.

The smell was suffocating.

Thick, clinging to my skin, sinking into my clothes. It wasn’t following Ace anymore. It had settled into me, like a new layer of existence, pressing against my ribs and weighing down my breath. It was inside the house now, inside me.

Ace stood outside now, staring at me through the open door. His ears twitched, but he didn’t move. He was willing to come back in—waiting for me to decide. He was giving me the choice.

I stepped forward, but my legs didn’t want to work. Every instinct screamed at me to stay, to let it consume me, to sink into it until I didn’t have to think anymore.
I forced myself to step forward, to push against the weight, against the thing clawing at my ribs. It fought me. But I fought harder.

The second I stepped outside, it was gone.
No smell. No weight. No presence.
The night air was cool against my skin, and for the first time in weeks, I felt like I could breathe.
I sucked in air, hands on my knees, staring at the ground. I was free.

Ace sat beside me, watching.
Then the thought hit me.

It didn’t leave.

My stomach twisted. It wasn’t gone—it was still inside.
And there was only one other person in there with it.
I turned back toward the house.
I lifted Ace over the fence first, placing him on the other side. He didn’t fight me. He just stared, waiting, watching.

I was supposed to run.

I almost did.

But I couldn’t leave her in there.

I pushed the door open. The second I stepped inside, the smell returned, punching the air from my lungs. The dread slithered back into my bones, wrapping itself around my spine.

She was sitting on the couch, one leg tucked under the other, scrolling through her phone like it was just another night. The glow from the screen lit up her face in soft blues and whites, casting shifting shadows that made her look like a memory I was already forgetting. For a split second, I wondered if she even knew I had walked back in. If she had felt the change in the air, the way the house had settled into something different. Or if she had been absorbed into it already, part of the emptiness.

""We have to go,"" I said, my voice hoarse. ""Now.""
She frowned. ""What?""

I couldn’t explain. I couldn’t make her understand. I just needed her to leave.

""I’m serious. I—"" I swallowed. ""I think we should break up.""

She blinked. ""Wait, what?""

""I need you to go. Now.""

Her expression twisted, hurt flashing across her face before hardening into something unreadable. I didn’t care. I just needed her to leave.

She grabbed her things without another word, shaking her head as she stormed toward the door.

I followed, watching, waiting—

The second she stepped through the threshold, Ace ran past me, bolting back inside.

I barely had time to register what was happening before she crossed the doorway.

And then—

The house exhaled.

Not a sound, not a movement, but something deeper, something felt in the marrow. Like the walls had been waiting for this exact moment. Like it had all been leading to this.

The air collapsed in on itself, folding, twisting, turning inside out. The space between seconds stretched and thinned, the room warping like light through heat. The doorway was no longer just a doorway. It was a threshold in the truest sense—a dividing line between what was real and what wasn’t.

My breath hitched. Something peeled away.
The walls bent. The floor trembled. Or maybe I did.
Ace was already inside, disappearing into the darkness as if he had never left at all. My girlfriend—she was still stepping through, her foot frozen midair like time had stuttered, like reality wasn’t sure how to let her leave.

And then it did.

She was gone.

And everything else went with her.

Chapter Eight: The Void

There was nothing.
No air, no walls, no ground beneath my feet. Just an absence so absolute that my body no longer felt like a body. I was here, but I wasn’t.

I tried to move, but there was nowhere to move to.
I tried to breathe, but there was nothing to breathe in.
There was only Ace.

He sat beside me—or maybe he didn’t. Maybe he was part of me now, or I was part of him. It didn’t matter. He was here. We were here.

I don’t know how long we stayed like that. A second? A thousand years? Time didn’t exist anymore, but we existed within it.

I held onto my name at first. My shape. My thoughts. But they were slipping, unraveling thread by thread, breaking down into something smaller, something quieter. Like I was dissolving into the nothing around me.

And Ace—he didn’t fight it.

Because he never had to.

He had always known. He had always accepted.
I think I laughed then, or maybe I cried. Or maybe I did neither. Maybe I just let go.

Ace shifted—or maybe I did. There was no difference anymore.

We weren’t separate. We weren’t anything.
We had always been here.

And somewhere, in the unraveling threads of my fading thoughts, I remembered thinking once—long ago, or maybe just a second ago—that the chimney wasn’t just a chimney.

Maybe you have too.

Can’t think of another way to describe this. But basically, what are some American cities that have remained very unique over the years? 

Have travelled to most states and large cities, and have found that while there certainly are very unique cities, many of them have the same flavor of trendy local coffee shops, sometimes regional foods, colorful murals, etc. I like all of these things but the differences between certain large cities can sometimes be minimal in terms of their non-geographic offerings. 

Detroit seems fairly unique in its history, architecture, and cultural institutions. A relatively smaller major city at around 600,000 people (though its metro population is large), but with the bones and museums of a city that was once the 4th largest in the country in the 1950s.

What Are the Ingredients in Gluco6?

Sukre

Sukre is a groundbreaking sugar substitute that enhances the sweetness of foods and plays a critical role in managing blood sugar levels. This innovative ingredient is derived from natural sources and designed to optimize glucose absorption in the body. By facilitating the movement of glucose out of the bloodstream and into the cells, Sukre helps to lower blood sugar spikes that occur after meals. This mechanism is especially beneficial for individuals with insulin resistance, as it aids in the effective utilization of sugar by the body.

In addition to its blood sugar-lowering properties, Sukre is also calorie-free, making it an ideal choice for those looking to reduce their caloric intake without sacrificing flavor. This dual benefit makes Sukre a valuable component of Gluco6, as it not only supports healthy blood sugar levels but also promotes a healthier weight loss journey.

TeaCrine

TeaCrine is a unique compound in certain teas and coffee known for its energy-boosting properties. What sets TeaCrine apart from traditional stimulants, like caffeine, is its ability to enhance cognitive function and improve mental clarity without causing jitters or crashes. In Gluco6, TeaCrine maintains stable energy levels throughout the day, which is particularly important for individuals managing blood sugar fluctuations.

This ingredient modulates the levels of specific neurotransmitters in the brain, leading to improved focus and mood enhancement. Gluco6 users can benefit from the clarity and concentration that TeaCrine provides, making it easier to stay motivated and engaged in their daily activities. Additionally, TeaCrine plays a vital role in overall metabolic health by supporting healthy blood glucose metabolism.

Gymnema

Gymnema Sylvestre, often referred to as the “sugar destroyer,” is a powerful herb traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine to lower sugar cravings and control blood sugar levels. The active compounds in Gymnema can block sugar receptors on the taste buds, making sweet foods less appealing. This effect helps to reduce the desire for sugary snacks, which can lead to improved dietary choices and better blood sugar control.

Moreover, Gymnema has been shown to enhance insulin sensitivity and facilitate glucose uptake in the cells, providing a comprehensive approach to blood sugar management. Its incorporation into Gluco6 means that users can expect not only reduced sugar cravings but also improved overall metabolic function, making weight management more achievable.

Chromium

Chromium is an essential trace mineral that plays a significant role in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. It enhances the action of insulin, which is crucial for regulating blood sugar levels. By improving insulin sensitivity, chromium helps to stabilize blood glucose levels after meals, reducing the risk of spikes and crashes that can lead to cravings and fatigue.

Also, chromium has been linked to weight loss, as it can help reduce body fat while preserving lean muscle mass. By including chromium in Gluco6, the product aids users in their weight loss journey and contributes to overall health improvements. Many users have reported feeling more balanced and energetic when using chromium as part of their blood sugar management routine.

Cinnamon

Cinnamon has long been celebrated for its numerous health benefits, particularly its role in supporting blood sugar control. Studies have shown that cinnamon can improve insulin sensitivity and lower fasting blood glucose levels, making it an essential ingredient in Gluco6. This potent spice increases glucose metabolism and reduces insulin resistance, providing a natural way to manage blood sugar levels.

Additionally, cinnamon is packed with antioxidants, which help combat oxidative stress within the body. This promotes better blood sugar management and supports overall health by reducing inflammation and enhancing cardiovascular health. With its sweet flavor, cinnamon is a pleasant addition to the Gluco6 formula, providing its users taste and health benefits.

Green Tea

Green tea is renowned for its health-promoting properties, particularly its rich antioxidant content. It contains catechins, powerful compounds known to improve glucose metabolism and enhance insulin sensitivity. Including green tea in Gluco6 contributes to better blood sugar regulation and promotes overall metabolic health.

Furthermore, green tea is associated with weight loss benefits due to its ability to increase fat oxidation and improve thermogenesis. By combining green tea with other ingredients in Gluco6, users can expect a synergistic effect that stabilizes blood sugar levels and aids in weight management. The refreshing taste of green tea also complements the other ingredients, making Gluco6 a palatable and healthful choice for those looking to improve their overall well-being.

Effective Weight Loss

The ingredients in Gluco6, such as Gymnema and chromium, specifically target cravings and promote healthier dietary choices, making it easier to adhere to a weight loss plan.

Ingredients like green tea and cinnamon work synergistically to increase thermogenesis and fat oxidation, aiding the body in burning stored fat more efficiently.

Additionally, the support for insulin sensitivity means that users are less likely to store excess fat, particularly around the abdominal area, which is often linked to insulin resistance. Overall, Gluco6 provides a comprehensive approach to weight loss that is sustainable and effective.

Reduced Sugar Cravings

One of the most challenging aspects of managing blood sugar is coping with intense sugar cravings. For many, these cravings can feel overwhelming and lead to unhealthy eating patterns. Gluco6 addresses this issue head-on by incorporating ingredients like Gymnema and Sukre, which are specifically designed to reduce the desire for sugary foods.

Gymnema works by blocking the sweet receptors on the taste buds, making it less appealing to indulge in sugary snacks. This natural craving suppression allows users to make more conscious choices about their diet, ultimately leading to healthier eating habits. Likewise, Sukre provides a sweetness without the calories, allowing users to enjoy flavors they love without the guilt.

By effectively managing sugar cravings, Gluco6 empowers individuals to break the cycle of unhealthy eating.

Enhanced Energy Levels

Maintaining stable energy levels throughout the day is crucial for productivity and overall quality of life. Many individuals struggling with blood sugar imbalances experience fatigue and lack of energy due to fluctuations in glucose levels. Gluco6 addresses this through its comprehensive formulation, which promotes steady energy release.

Its unique blend of ingredients, particularly TeaCrine and green tea, provides a natural energy boost without the jitters associated with more common stimulants like caffeine. Users have reported feeling more energetic and focused, allowing them to engage in physical activities and daily tasks more enthusiastically.

Gluco6 helps users avoid the energy crashes that often accompany sugar highs and lows by stabilizing blood sugar levels and improving metabolic function. This sustained energy not only aids in weight management—allowing for more physical activity—but also enhances mental clarity, making it easier to stay focused and productive throughout the day.

Antioxidant Support

Antioxidants play a vital role in protecting the body from oxidative stress and inflammation, both of which can negatively impact health and contribute to various chronic conditions. Gluco6 incorporates powerful antioxidant-rich ingredients like green tea and cinnamon, providing users with significant support in maintaining overall health.

Green tea, known for its high concentration of catechins, offers robust antioxidant effects that combat free radicals and reduce inflammation in the body. This, in turn, can lead to improved metabolic health and a lower risk of serious conditions, including heart disease and diabetes. Cinnamon also contributes to antioxidant support and has been shown to possess anti-inflammatory properties, further enhancing the health benefits of Gluco6.

By integrating these antioxidants into its formulation, Gluco6 supports blood sugar control and boosts overall health. Users can enjoy peace of mind knowing they are taking a supplement that contributes to long-term wellness and longevity.

Heart Health

Maintaining heart health is crucial, especially for individuals with blood sugar imbalances who may face an increased risk of cardiovascular issues. Gluco6 offers several ingredients that support heart health through various mechanisms. For instance, the antioxidant properties of green tea and cinnamon can help reduce cholesterol levels and improve circulation, contributing to a healthier cardiovascular system.

Chromium is another key ingredient that plays a role in heart health by improving insulin sensitivity and thereby reducing the risk of heart-related issues associated with diabetes. By stabilizing blood sugar levels, Gluco6 can help prevent the damage that fluctuating glucose levels can cause to blood vessels and the heart.

Using Gluco6, users take proactive steps toward safeguarding their heart health while managing their blood sugar. This dual benefit fosters a holistic approach to well-being, emphasizing how effective blood sugar management can positively impact various aspects of health.

1ihs566,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1ihs566/my_dog_smells_like_cigarettes_but_i_dont_smoke/,"My Dog Smells Like Cigarettes, But I Don’t Smoke","Chapter One: Moving In

The house wasn’t anything special. Two bedrooms, a laundry room that smelled like detergent and old wood, a backyard big enough for Ace to run around in. It was the kind of place you rented when you didn’t have the money for something better but still wanted a place to call your own. A fixer-upper, as the landlord had called it. But as far as I could tell, nothing really needed fixing.
Except the chimney.

""Previous owner sealed it up years ago,"" the landlord had mentioned offhandedly during the walk-through. 

""Best to just leave it alone.""

I barely registered the comment at the time. I didn’t care about the chimney. I wasn’t the kind of person who sat in front of a fire with a glass of whiskey, contemplating life. If anything, I liked that it was sealed up. Less maintenance.

Ace had taken to the place immediately. He ran through every room like he was cataloging them, sniffing every inch, claiming every corner. A mutt with a bruiser’s build—part pit, part shepherd, part Rottweiler—he was the kind of dog that looked like trouble but was more likely to curl up next to you than bite.

""Feels weird,"" 
my girlfriend had said when she first stepped inside, her arms crossed as she scanned the walls. 
""Like… I don’t know. Old.""

""It is old,"" I said. ""That’s kind of the point. Cheap rent.""

She made a face, but didn’t push it. She wasn’t the type to argue over things that didn’t really matter.
She didn’t move in with me, but she stayed over more often than not. I liked having her around. Even when she was quiet, there was something grounding about her presence. Like an anchor to reality, a reminder that even if I was alone in this place, I wasn’t actually alone.

That first night was restless. Not because anything happened, but because I couldn’t quite shake the feeling that I’d forgotten something. Like when you leave the house and feel like your keys aren’t in your pocket, even though they are.

Ace slept fine. I should’ve taken a lesson from him.

I didn’t think about the chimney again. I didn’t think about anything, really. It was just a house.

For now.

Chapter Two: The First Sign

It was a couple of days before I noticed the smell.

I was sitting on the couch, half-listening to a podcast while scrolling on my phone, when Ace climbed up next to me and flopped his head onto my lap. I scratched behind his ears absentmindedly, letting his weight settle against me. 
That’s when it hit me.

Cigarettes.

It was faint at first, subtle enough that I almost convinced myself I was imagining it. But the more I focused on it, the stronger it got—stale, acrid, like the inside of a car where someone had been chain-smoking for years.

I frowned, leaned in, and sniffed him properly. The smell was coming from his fur.

I pulled back, wrinkling my nose. ""Dude, what the hell?""

Ace thumped his tail against the couch, completely unbothered.

I scratched my head. He hadn’t been around anyone but me, and I didn’t smoke. Neither did my girlfriend. None of my friends did, either. The only people who came over vaped, and that didn’t leave a smell like this.

I ran my hands over his coat, checking for anything he might have rolled in. Nothing. Just the smell, clinging to him like a second skin.

""You roll around in someone’s ashtray outside?"" I muttered, rubbing at my jeans where the scent had transferred. 

I didn’t think much of it. Dogs got into weird shit all the time. Maybe someone had thrown a cigarette butt into the yard, and he’d brushed up against it.

Still, it bugged me.

That evening, my girlfriend came over. She had this habit of coming in without knocking, kicking off her shoes in the doorway like she’d lived here for years. I liked that about her. Made the place feel a little less empty.

Ace trotted up to greet her, and she crouched down to scratch under his chin. ""Hey, big guy. Miss me?""

I watched, waiting for her to react, to pull back from the smell. She didn’t.

""You smell that?"" I asked, standing up.

She glanced at me. ""Smell what?""

""He reeks like cigarettes.""

She frowned, leaning in to sniff him. Then she made a face. ""Ew. Gross.""

""Right?"" I said. ""I have no idea where he got it from.""
She wiped her hands on her jeans and stood up. 

""You should give him a bath.""

That was it. No questions. No curiosity. Just an offhanded suggestion before she walked into the kitchen to grab a drink. She didn’t even seem that bothered by it.

I hesitated, feeling weirdly disappointed by that. Like I was the only one who noticed something was off.

That night, I woke up feeling watched.
Not in a paranoid way. Not in the way where you jolt up, convinced someone’s in the room with you. This was different.

It was the kind of feeling where you’re sure someone’s looking at you, even if you can’t see them. Like an itch between your shoulders, a weight on your chest, something just outside your field of vision that refuses to reveal itself.

I turned over, and my eyes landed on Ace. He was asleep at the foot of my bed, breathing steady, chest rising and falling in deep, even rhythms. 

He wasn’t looking at me. But something else was.

I stared at the darkened corners of the room, half-expecting to see something staring back.

Nothing.

Just shadows. Just my own shitty imagination.

I rolled onto my back and forced my eyes shut, willing myself to ignore it.

It was just a feeling.

But it stayed with me long after I finally fell asleep.

Chapter Three: The Chimney Stirs

The cigarette smell was stronger the next morning.
I didn’t notice it right away, not until I was pouring my coffee and Ace brushed against my leg. It hit me then—sharp, stale, like old smoke trapped in fabric.

""Dude,"" I muttered, stepping back. ""It’s worse.""

Ace yawned like he couldn’t care less.

I crouched down and sniffed again, just to be sure. It was definitely stronger. Not overpowering, but noticeable. Like he’d spent the night in a chain-smoking competition and lost on a technicality.

I rubbed my face and stood up. 

""Guess it’s bath time.""

Ace groaned in protest but didn’t move. Lazy bastard.

I was getting towels from the laundry room when I heard it.

A whistle.

Not a melody, not an intentional tune—just a faint, breathy sound, like air squeezing through a narrow gap. Like someone pursing their lips but not quite blowing.
I froze. It came from inside the wall.

The laundry room was small, just enough space for the washer, dryer, and a few shelves. The chimney was in here, too—sealed up, forgotten. I barely ever thought about it.

But now, standing in front of it, I did.
I reached out and ran my fingers over the bricks. They felt wrong.

Not bad. Not cursed. Just... off.
Some spots were too smooth, like they had been worn down by years of touch. Others were rough, almost jagged. The texture wasn’t consistent, like the bricks hadn’t all come from the same place.
I pressed my palm flat against it.
For a second, nothing happened.

Then—

A soft click.

The kind of sound a lock makes when it shifts slightly, not unlocking but adjusting.
I pulled my hand back fast.
The laundry room was still. Too still.
The whistle didn’t come again.
Ace was waiting in the hallway when I stepped out, watching me.

I hesitated. ""You hear that?""
He blinked once. Then, slowly, he turned and walked away.

Not scared. Not spooked. Just... there.
Like he had already made peace with whatever it was.

Chapter Four: The First Transfer

It was late when I let Ace outside.
The air was thick and warm, clinging to my skin like an extra layer I didn’t ask for. Crickets hummed from the grass, distant, rhythmic, indifferent. Ace trotted onto the lawn, stretching once before shaking his fur, shedding the weight of the house like it had been pressing down on him.

The second he stepped out, I knew something was wrong.

The smell didn’t leave with him.
It should have. Every time before, Ace had been the one carrying it. But now, as I stood in the doorway, the smell of cigarettes was still here. Still around me.
Then the dread hit.

Not the kind of fear that spikes in your chest and fades. This was heavier. Suffocating. Like stepping into a room where the air was too thick to breathe. Like something was waiting. Watching. Pressing in from all sides.
The entire house smelled like it now. The furniture, the walls, the air itself—like I was inside the smell.
My hands clenched into fists. My legs locked up. Something was in here with me.
I forced myself to move, to shake off the feeling, but it stuck.

Then—Ace barked.
A single, sharp noise, cutting through the weight of it all. My head snapped up.
He was at the window, ears perked, staring at me. Not scared. Not panicked. Just focused.
Like he knew.

The second I unlocked the door, he bolted inside.
And just like that, the dread was gone.
Not faded. Not drained away.
Gone.

Like a switch flipped. Like it had never been there.
But the smell—the smell didn’t vanish instantly.
It weakened. Slowly. Like it was drifting, finding its way back to where it belonged.
Back to Ace.

I swallowed, staring at him as he trotted into the living room, circling once before lying down. Like nothing had happened.

But something had.

Something was wrong.

And for the first time, I looked at Ace a little longer than usual, my mind grasping for an explanation I didn’t want to find.

Chapter Five: The Unraveling

It started with small things.

Keys not where I left them. A cabinet door open when I knew I had closed it. A glass sitting in the sink when I hadn’t used one.

Little things. Things you could write off.
At first, I did.

Then it got weirder.

I came home one evening and found the TV on—playing static. The remote was on the coffee table, untouched. Ace was asleep on the couch, head on his paws.
I stood there for a long time, staring at the screen.
Ace didn’t move. Didn’t acknowledge it.
I shut the TV off.

The next night, I woke up to find my bedroom door open. I always slept with it closed.
Ace was on the floor, right where he always was. But the air in the room felt wrong.
Like I had just missed something.

Ace’s mood had changed, too. Not in a bad way, not in any way I could describe, really. He still acted like Ace. Still sat next to me when I watched TV, still greeted me at the door, still ran to the window every time he heard a car pass. But there was something behind his eyes.

A sharpness.

A knowing.

It made my stomach twist.
I tried to shake it off, but every time I looked at him, I felt like there was something I was ignoring to see.

I told my girlfriend everything that night. About the smell. The feeling. The whistle.
She didn’t brush me off. She sat next to me, pulled her knees up to her chest, and listened.
""I don’t know what to tell you,"" she said finally. ""I believe you. I just... I don’t know what to do about it.""
I exhaled. ""I don’t either.""
She reached for my hand. She didn’t have an answer, but at least she was here.

The whistle came again the next night.
Louder. Clearer.
Ace was in the living room with me when I heard it.

The chimney was empty.

But something was still inside.

Chapter Six: The Realization

It wasn’t Ace.

I don’t know when exactly I started to realize it. Maybe it had been sitting in the back of my head for a while, waiting for me to stop looking for the wrong answers. But once the thought surfaced, it refused to leave.

It wasn’t Ace.

The smell wasn’t on him. It was following him. Like a shadow, like something waiting for its turn to move.
The objects that had been shifting—they only moved when he was in the room. But not because of him. They moved when I wasn’t looking.

The whistle wasn’t tied to him, either. He had been in the living room with me when I heard it from the chimney.

And Ace? Ace had never been afraid. Not once.
Because whatever this was, he had always known it was there. He had been carrying it, living with it, taking it with him—until the night it stayed with me instead.
I watched him sleep that night. Not out of fear, not out of paranoia—but because I was waiting to feel that presence again.

It was different this time. The weight was on me now.
Ace slept peacefully, his breaths deep and steady. He didn’t feel it anymore.
Because I did.

I swallowed, shifting in bed. The air felt thick. Like the house was watching me.

I had spent days, maybe weeks, thinking the wrong thing. Thinking it was him. But he wasn’t the one changing.

It was.

The moment Ace had stepped outside that night, the entity had stayed with me. But when he came back in, he didn’t even hesitate for a second to take it back. It had let me feel everything Ace had been carrying this entire time. And I had blamed him for it.

I tensed my jaw and gritted me teeth, staring at the ceiling. It had never been Ace I needed to fear.

It had always been whatever was lingering around me now, shifting unseen through the space we shared.
And for the first time, I let myself see it for what it was.

Chapter Seven: The Breaking Point

I opened the door and let Ace out.

He hesitated for a moment, glancing back at me before stepping onto the grass. The moment he was outside, the air inside the house shifted.

The smell was suffocating.

Thick, clinging to my skin, sinking into my clothes. It wasn’t following Ace anymore. It had settled into me, like a new layer of existence, pressing against my ribs and weighing down my breath. It was inside the house now, inside me.

Ace stood outside now, staring at me through the open door. His ears twitched, but he didn’t move. He was willing to come back in—waiting for me to decide. He was giving me the choice.

I stepped forward, but my legs didn’t want to work. Every instinct screamed at me to stay, to let it consume me, to sink into it until I didn’t have to think anymore.
I forced myself to step forward, to push against the weight, against the thing clawing at my ribs. It fought me. But I fought harder.

The second I stepped outside, it was gone.
No smell. No weight. No presence.
The night air was cool against my skin, and for the first time in weeks, I felt like I could breathe.
I sucked in air, hands on my knees, staring at the ground. I was free.

Ace sat beside me, watching.
Then the thought hit me.

It didn’t leave.

My stomach twisted. It wasn’t gone—it was still inside.
And there was only one other person in there with it.
I turned back toward the house.
I lifted Ace over the fence first, placing him on the other side. He didn’t fight me. He just stared, waiting, watching.

I was supposed to run.

I almost did.

But I couldn’t leave her in there.

I pushed the door open. The second I stepped inside, the smell returned, punching the air from my lungs. The dread slithered back into my bones, wrapping itself around my spine.

She was sitting on the couch, one leg tucked under the other, scrolling through her phone like it was just another night. The glow from the screen lit up her face in soft blues and whites, casting shifting shadows that made her look like a memory I was already forgetting. For a split second, I wondered if she even knew I had walked back in. If she had felt the change in the air, the way the house had settled into something different. Or if she had been absorbed into it already, part of the emptiness.

""We have to go,"" I said, my voice hoarse. ""Now.""
She frowned. ""What?""

I couldn’t explain. I couldn’t make her understand. I just needed her to leave.

""I’m serious. I—"" I swallowed. ""I think we should break up.""

She blinked. ""Wait, what?""

""I need you to go. Now.""

Her expression twisted, hurt flashing across her face before hardening into something unreadable. I didn’t care. I just needed her to leave.

She grabbed her things without another word, shaking her head as she stormed toward the door.

I followed, watching, waiting—

The second she stepped through the threshold, Ace ran past me, bolting back inside.

I barely had time to register what was happening before she crossed the doorway.

And then—

The house exhaled.

Not a sound, not a movement, but something deeper, something felt in the marrow. Like the walls had been waiting for this exact moment. Like it had all been leading to this.

The air collapsed in on itself, folding, twisting, turning inside out. The space between seconds stretched and thinned, the room warping like light through heat. The doorway was no longer just a doorway. It was a threshold in the truest sense—a dividing line between what was real and what wasn’t.

My breath hitched. Something peeled away.
The walls bent. The floor trembled. Or maybe I did.
Ace was already inside, disappearing into the darkness as if he had never left at all. My girlfriend—she was still stepping through, her foot frozen midair like time had stuttered, like reality wasn’t sure how to let her leave.

And then it did.

She was gone.

And everything else went with her.

Chapter Eight: The Void

There was nothing.
No air, no walls, no ground beneath my feet. Just an absence so absolute that my body no longer felt like a body. I was here, but I wasn’t.

I tried to move, but there was nowhere to move to.
I tried to breathe, but there was nothing to breathe in.
There was only Ace.

He sat beside me—or maybe he didn’t. Maybe he was part of me now, or I was part of him. It didn’t matter. He was here. We were here.

I don’t know how long we stayed like that. A second? A thousand years? Time didn’t exist anymore, but we existed within it.

I held onto my name at first. My shape. My thoughts. But they were slipping, unraveling thread by thread, breaking down into something smaller, something quieter. Like I was dissolving into the nothing around me.

And Ace—he didn’t fight it.

Because he never had to.

He had always known. He had always accepted.
I think I laughed then, or maybe I cried. Or maybe I did neither. Maybe I just let go.

Ace shifted—or maybe I did. There was no difference anymore.

We weren’t separate. We weren’t anything.
We had always been here.

And somewhere, in the unraveling threads of my fading thoughts, I remembered thinking once—long ago, or maybe just a second ago—that the chimney wasn’t just a chimney.

Maybe you have too.

I have one or two contacts in the county, but rather than wander aimlessly on the street, I figured I’d check in here to see if anyone wants to be a part of the project or knows someone I should talk to.

The project involves photographing and interviewing everyday rural Kentuckians. As the gap between urban and rural Americans widens, I think it’s more important than ever to show the heart and soul of our rural communities.

In addition to the cultural preservation aspect, full disclosure, I  work for a federal agency that helps rural communities, so this work may also be used to remind the “powers that be” of the importance of investing in rural communities and the people who call rural Kentucky home.

It’s short notice, but I’m going to be in Lynch tomorrow, Feb. 5, if anyone wants to grab some coffee at Lamp House Coffee and chat. I'm also planning to make regular trips, so if you want to schedule something, feel free to msg me.

Who the heck am I? My name’s Greg Thomas, and I’m a retired military (Marine Corps) photojournalist. I’m based in Lexington and work for an agency under the USDA umbrella.

Reposting again - here's to optimism and not giving up.

I am a 35 year old single nerd (yes, very unique on reddit), both in personal and professional life. I am an expat living in the Netherlands but originally from India(oh dear, Indian, run away!! )

Still here?... well read on..

I have been away from home for more than 12 years, for both educational and professional reasons. Last 3 years were spent in the Netherlands. I am not sure where I will be tomorrow - perhaps back in Asia or US - life takes you places, but I am here for now and the loneliness is getting to me. It has been more than a year since I dated anyone and I am finally at a point where both mind and body desire some affection and intimacy. I am looking for a connection - be it just friendship with the possibility of something more, but a connection nonetheless.

More about me:

On a fitness journey. Trying to work out at least 4 days a week and eating healthy. I am getting stronger but there is much work to be done. The latter part has been harder as I absolutely love food - I think it is the single greatest pleasure of life. Would love to connect with someone who is also into fitness or at least seriously considering getting into it so we can encourage each other as opposed to enabling the bad habits.

I like the usual nerdy things - gaming, fantasy and sci-fiction, manga, and the occasional anime. Not a requirement that you be a nerd but it helps :)

I am a lifelong tourist, love traveling and enjoy road trips. Been to over 30 countries, always looking forward to my next vacation, and want to see the whole world!

Other details about me:

* Introvert
* Much more shy and socially awkward than I would like to be :p
* Politically liberal/left
* Don't smoke or drink alcohol, but coffee is my poison!
* Vegetarian
* Love touch and adore cuddles :)
* Non Vanilla, but that is for (much) later ;)

I am generally an easy going and an agreeable person, but strong religious inclinations and an anti-science mindset are absolute deal breakers. This is already too long so lastly, I am looking for something IRL and would prefer speaking to people who are in the Netherlands or within short distances.

If my post resonates with you, do reach out and please leave an introduction.

Stay safe,

Cheers!",2,1738702090.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False
1ihs209,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepsMcPasta/comments/1ihs209/my_wife_hasnt_blinked_in_three_days/,My Wife Hasn’t Blinked in Three Days,"Emily and I had been talking about leaving the city for years, but for a long time, it was just talk. The idea of it, the fantasy, was always easier than the reality. Work, schedules, expenses- there was always something keeping us in place.

But then Emily’s job went fully remote, and my company downsized, leaving me with a severance package and more free time than I knew what to do with. The noise of the city, the weight of routine, it all started feeling suffocating.

Emily was the one who found the listing.

“Look at this,” she had said one evening, laptop balanced on her knees. “It’s perfect.”

I leaned over her shoulder, expecting some overpriced cabin in the middle of nowhere. Instead, I saw an old, two-story house with deep green shutters and a wraparound porch, nestled right at the edge of a vast, untouched forest. The kind of place you’d see in an old postcard.

I laughed. “That looks like the beginning of a horror movie.”

She grinned. “Or the beginning of something good.”

Emily had always loved the woods. When she was a kid, she used to disappear into them for hours, coming back with twigs in her hair and stories about deer that let her get too close, birds that seemed to follow her. She always said there was something different about being deep in nature, something bigger than her but strangely familiar.

I had never really understood it, but I loved how much she loved it.

And maybe I needed a change too.

So we packed up, left behind the noise, and moved to the quietest place we could find.

Our new home was old, but it had character- solid wooden beams, a deep front porch, ivy climbing up the stone walls. It sat at the very edge of town, where the paved roads turned to dirt, where the streetlights thinned and finally disappeared.

It was the kind of place where time felt slower, where the days stretched long, where the forest pressed in on all sides like a living thing.

Emily loved it immediately.

She spent the first evening sitting on the porch, wrapped in an old sweater, watching the sun set over the tree line with a quiet sort of happiness I hadn’t seen in years.

But something about the house, the land around it, felt too still.

I couldn’t explain it.

And for the a moment, I wished we weren’t so alone out here.

It wasn’t the vastness of the trees that unsettled me. It was how quiet they were.

I grew up in the suburbs, but even I knew what the woods were supposed to sound like. The rustling of leaves in the wind, the occasional snap of a branch underfoot, birds calling to each other from the canopy.

But here?

Nothing.

Not even the buzz of insects.

The trees stood motionless, their leaves perfectly still in the heavy summer air. The sky was overcast, thick with the kind of clouds that seemed to press down on you, but there was no breeze. Not even the faintest shift of air.

I hadn’t realized how much I relied on background noise, until there was none.

I glanced at Emily, expecting her to notice it too. But she just smiled, stretching her legs out and sipping her tea like nothing was wrong.

“It’s perfect,” she murmured.

It didn’t feel perfect to me.

And I wasn’t the only one who thought so.

Murphy, our dog, had been exploring the yard when we arrived, sniffing at the porch steps, trotting through the long grass, but the moment he got close to the trees, he stopped.

His ears flattened.

His tail, which had been wagging all afternoon, slowly lowered between his legs.

Then he backed away.

Emily clicked her tongue, trying to coax him forward. “What’s wrong, buddy?”

Murphy whined low in his throat and turned, trotting back toward the house with his tail tucked tight against his body.

I let out a small laugh, shaking my head. “Maybe he’s just not used to all the space.”

But that wasn’t it.

I had never seen him act like that before.

Emily just sighed, shaking her head. “He’ll get used to it.”

Then she turned back to the forest.

And I swear, just for a second-

The trees shifted.

Not in the wind. There was no wind.

But something moved. Deep in the dark.

\-

Emily had always been independent, but something about the woods unsettled me.

We had been in the house for less than a week when she told me she wanted to explore the nearby trails.

""Are you sure you want to go there alone?"" I had said, watching her lace up her boots.

She smiled, adjusting the strap on her pack. ""It'll be fine. I just want to get a feel for the area first.""

That feeling in my gut twisted.

""Just don't go too far.""

She kissed my cheek and was gone before I could say anything else.

By early afternoon, I expected to hear her coming back.

By late afternoon, I checked my phone, scrolling absently through messages, waiting for a text that never came.

By early evening, I started to worry.

I stood on the porch, scanning the trees. The sun had already started dipping below the horizon, drenching the woods in a deep orange glow.

Still no sign of her.

I told myself she probably lost track of time. That she’d be fine. But that feeling, the one I had since we moved in- settled deeper into my chest.

And then, just as I reached for my car keys to go looking for her, I saw her. Coming out of the woods.

I knew immediately that something was wrong.

She moved too slowly, as if walking was an afterthought. Her skin looked pale, like she had been out in the cold for hours, but her forehead glistened with sweat. Her clothes were dirt-streaked, her sleeves damp and darkened, but there was no sign that she had fallen.

And her boots, her boots were wet.

It hadn’t rained in days.

I stepped forward, feeling my pulse pick up. ""Where the hell were you? I was about to go looking for you.""

Emily looked at me, like she had just registered I was there.

""I... I think I got turned around.""

She sounded dazed, like she had just woken from a dream.

I frowned. ""You got lost?""

A pause. Then, too slowly, she nodded. ""Yeah. I guess so.""

She stepped past me and onto the porch, heading inside without another word.

I hesitated before following.

Something was off.

She wasn’t acting scared, embarrassed, or frustrated, just blank. Like she wasn’t entirely there.

That night, Murphy refused to go near her.

I had been sitting on the couch when he suddenly stopped in the middle of the room, his ears flattening against his head.

His eyes locked on Emily, who was standing in the kitchen, refilling her water bottle.

Then he growled. A low, rumbling sound I had never heard from him before.

Emily glanced over, frowning. ""What's wrong with him?""

I opened my mouth to answer, but before I could, Murphy backed away.

Not ran. Not bolted in panic. Just... backed away. Slowly. Carefully. His entire body was rigid, tail tucked between his legs, ears pinned back like he had just encountered a predator.

Then he turned and darted into the hallway, disappearing under the couch.

Emily laughed, but something about it felt off.

""Maybe he just doesn’t recognize me in my hiking gear.""

But she wasn’t wearing her hiking gear anymore. And I had never seen Murphy afraid of anything before.

\-

It started as a whisper of unease, the kind that you feel in your gut before your brain can explain it.

Emily was the same, but... not. And maybe that’s why it unnerved me so much, because the changes were subtle enough to make me doubt myself, but noticeable enough that I couldn’t ignore them.

It was a morning like any other. I was making coffee, half-asleep, while Emily sat across from me at the kitchen table, eating a bowl of yogurt. She was scrolling through her phone, her spoon moving mechanically from bowl to mouth.

I don’t know what made me notice it, but as I took a sip of coffee, something felt wrong.

Emily’s eyes.

They were locked on her screen, unmoving. Too still.

I watched her between sips, waiting for her to blink.

She didn’t.

I shifted in my seat, my pulse kicking up a notch. Maybe I wasn’t paying close enough attention. Maybe I was imagining things.

So I leaned forward. Watched harder.

Nothing.

I felt my stomach twist. Thirty seconds. A full minute. Two. Still, her eyes stayed open, glassy, reflecting the blue glow of her phone screen.

“Did you sleep okay?” I asked, trying to keep my voice light.

She looked up at me, a slow, lazy smile curling at her lips. “Yeah. Why?”

I stared at her, my heartbeat thudding in my ears.

Still no blink.

I forced a chuckle, shaking my head. “No reason.”

She held my gaze a little too long before turning back to her phone.

The air felt heavy in my chest.

I waited again.

And still, she didn’t blink.

On top of this, Emily had always been graceful, the kind of person who moved without thinking, quick, fluid, comfortable in her own skin. But now, it was like she was... adjusting to herself.

I noticed it one night when she got into bed.

She lifted the covers, sliding beneath them, but then she stopped.

Her hand hovered in midair, fingers curled like she was about to grasp the blanket, but she just... froze.

Her breathing didn’t change. She didn’t react, didn’t flinch. She just stayed like that, mid-motion, as if she had forgotten the next step.

A second passed. Then two.

I was about to say something, to shake her, when she finally moved again.

Smooth. Slow. Like nothing had happened.

I didn’t sleep well that night.

The morning air was biting, crisp enough to see my breath in little white clouds as I stood on the porch, sipping my coffee. The ground was damp with frost, the sky overcast and heavy with low gray clouds.

Emily stepped outside, barefoot.

I winced as her foot hit the cold wooden boards.

She took a deep breath, stretching her arms above her head, staring out into the woods like she belonged to them.

I wrapped my flannel tighter around me. “Jesus, Em, aren’t you freezing?”

She let her arms fall back to her sides, tilting her head slightly, as if considering the question.

Then she smiled. “No.”

She turned back to the trees, the wind lifting her hair. I watched her arms, waiting for the telltale bumps of gooseflesh to rise on her skin.

They never did.

And as I watched, I realized something else.

Her breath.

The cold air should have made it visible. But there was nothing.

Murphy had stopped growling at Emily. But he still wouldn’t go near her. It wasn’t just fear anymore, it was avoidance.

At first, I thought he was skittish, acting out. But as the days passed, I started watching closer. And I realized something that sent a chill through me.

Murphy wouldn’t look at her.

Not once.

It wasn’t just that he stayed away, it was like he couldn’t see her at all.

One night, we were in the living room. Emily stood by the window, arms crossed over her chest, gazing out into the dark.

Murphy sat on the floor a few feet away, his ears relaxed, his eyes half-lidded with sleep. But he wasn’t looking at Emily.

He was looking past her.

No, not past her.

At the space next to her.

He stared at it, stared at nothing.

I felt a cold shiver creep up my spine.

“Murphy,” I called.

His head snapped toward me instantly, tail thumping against the floor. His ears perked up.

I glanced at Emily, expecting her to notice, but she hadn’t moved.

She was watching me.

The silence stretched between us.

I swallowed hard, my throat dry.

If Murphy doesn’t see her... then what does he see?

To get some fresh air, I went to the shops. I don’t know why, but I brought it up to the shopkeeper.

It was an impulse, something about the weight in my chest, the feeling I couldn’t shake. I guess I just couldn't keep it inside any longer.

I was standing at the counter, waiting for my change, when I said, “My wife went hiking a few days ago. I think she got turned around. She was out there a long time.”

The shopkeeper, a wiry old man with a permanent squint, froze.

He didn’t ask where she went. He didn’t ask if she was okay.

Instead, he reached for my bag and muttered, “You should be careful up there.”

Something in his tone made the hairs on my arms rise.

I forced a chuckle. “Why’s that?”

He hesitated, sliding the bag toward me. “Some things stay in the woods.”

My fingers curled around the paper handles.

I tried to laugh again, but it came out wrong. “What does that mean?”

He just shook his head. “Nothing. Just... be careful.”

His eyes flicked up, scanning the shop. Like someone else was listening. And suddenly, I didn’t want to press him anymore.

\-

At home, the oddities didn't stop. It happened the first time I touched her in days.

Emily had always run cold. She used to press her cold feet against me in bed just to hear me yelp. Used to complain when I turned the AC up too high, always pulling the blankets tighter around herself at night.

But now?

Now, her skin was cold. Not just cool. Not just the kind of chill you get after stepping outside on a brisk evening.

Cold like stone.

It was a casual touch, just my fingers brushing against her arm as I passed her in the hallway, but the moment I felt it, my stomach dropped.

I stopped. “Jesus, Em, you feel frozen.”

She turned her head toward me, slow and smooth. Too smooth. “Do I?”

I forced a chuckle. “Yeah. Are you feeling okay?”

She smiled, the way someone smiles when they’re trying to make you feel stupid for worrying. “I feel fine.”

I watched her for a second too long. Her pupils seemed darker than before, the irises like thin rings of gold around a deep, endless void. Red around her eyes, strain looking likeit was taking its toll.

And then turned away. Never blinking the whole time.

I told myself it was in my head. That maybe she had just been outside too long.

But later that night, I woke up to something worse.

I woke in the dark, my body heavy with sleep, my mind groggy. I rolled over instinctively, reaching for her.

Empty sheets.

My heart jumped, and I sat up, blinking into the darkness.

Emily was sitting on the edge of the bed.

Her back was to me, her shoulders rigid, her head slightly tilted toward the window.

She didn’t move. Didn’t shift. Didn’t acknowledge me.

I swallowed. “Em?”

No reaction. She just stared.

I swung my legs over the bed, pressing my bare feet to the floor, feeling the cool wood beneath my toes. My throat was dry.

Slowly, I reached out, gently touching her shoulder.

Her skin was even colder than before. Like she had been sitting outside in the frost all night.

That’s when I noticed something else.

She wasn’t breathing.

I froze.

My fingers curled slightly against her skin, waiting for the telltale rise and fall of her shoulders.

Nothing.

She wasn’t even trying to fake it.

I slowly moved my hand toward her mouth, hovering just over her lips, waiting to feel warmth, a soft exhale of air.

Nothing.

She just wasn’t breathing.

I yanked my hand back, and my pulse hammered so loudly in my ears that I almost didn’t hear her.

Almost.

“Go back to sleep.”

Her voice was soft. Almost too soft.

She still hadn’t moved. Hadn’t turned her head. Hadn’t blinked.

I swallowed hard. “Emily, what are you-”

She finally turned.

Slowly.

Her head tilted, just enough to look at me over her shoulder. The dim glow of the moon through the window caught her eyes at the perfect angle, so dark they reflected nothing back at me.

Her lips curled up at the corners.

“You should sleep,” she whispered. “I don’t want you tired.”

I didn’t move. Didn’t breathe myself.

Then, just as slowly as she had turned, she faced forward again. And continued staring out the window.

I didn’t sleep again.

I barely functioned the next morning, running on coffee and frayed nerves, feeling my body betray me with exhaustion. I needed answers.

So I went into town.

I don’t know what I was hoping for. Maybe just human contact, someone normal, someone who would pull me out of my own head. Maybe an excuse to get away from the house for a few hours.

But when I stepped out of the general store, he was waiting for me.

An old man, thin and wiry, with deep-set eyes and a face that looked like it had weathered decades of bad seasons. The old shopkeeper from before, on a break. He was sitting on the bench just outside the entrance, one leg crossed over the other, hands folded neatly in his lap.

I nearly walked past him, but then he said:

“You need to leave.”

I stopped in my tracks. Turned to look at him. His eyes were on me, sharp and certain. Not the words of a crazy old man, not a warning thrown at just anyone passing by.

He meant me.

I swallowed hard, forcing out a weak laugh. “Excuse me?”

He didn’t blink. “If she came back... she wasn’t supposed to.”

A cold sensation trickled down my spine. The weight of those words pressed into my ribs, settling into the space between my lungs.

I opened my mouth to demand an explanation, but the old man was already pushing himself to his feet.

I took a step closer. “What the hell does that mean?”

He shook his head, eyes darting briefly to the street, as if checking for someone. Then he leaned in slightly, lowering his voice:

“Don’t let her sleep.”

My mouth went dry.

Before I could say another word, he turned and walked away.

I watched him until he disappeared around the corner.

I didn’t go home right away. I sat in my car, gripping the steering wheel, staring at nothing, hearing his words repeat over and over again in my head.

She wasn’t supposed to come back.

Don’t let her sleep.

\-

I should have left.

That was the obvious answer. It had been for days.

If someone else told me this story, if a friend came to me, trembling, saying, “Something is wrong with my wife, she’s not acting like herself, I think she might not even be human”- I wouldn’t hesitate. I’d tell them to pack a bag, get in the car, and never look back.

But it’s different when it’s your wife.

It’s different when it’s someone you love.

I kept telling myself it was in my head. That maybe I was overreacting, that maybe she was just tired or sick, or that I was just adjusting to life in a new place, reading too much into things.

And then there was the other thought, the deeper one, the one I didn’t want to acknowledge:

What if she’s still in there?

What if she just needs help?

What if I leave her, and there was never anything wrong at all- except me?

So instead of running, I did the worst thing I could do.

I tried to understand.

I sat at my desk late into the night, the glow of my laptop screen the only light in the room, trawling through old town records, newspaper archives, anything that might tell me what the hell was happening to my wife.

I searched missing persons reports first.

And that’s when I found them.

Hikers. Campers. Locals.

All of them had gone missing near the woods by our house.

Most of them were never found.

But one case stood out.

The article was over thirty years old. Some news offshoot that covered conspiracies and urban legends. The kind of source you immediately dismiss as unreliable, yet it was the only thing that matched. The scanned newspaper clipping was grainy, the text barely legible, but the headline made my blood run cold.

LOCAL WOMAN RETURNS AFTER THREE MONTHS MISSING- ‘SHE WAS NEVER THE SAME’

I clicked on it, my pulse hammering as I skimmed through the details.

The woman, Margaret Delaney, 27 years old, had gone missing on a solo hiking trip in the very same forest where Emily had been. She vanished without a trace, presumed dead.

Then, one evening, she simply walked back into town.

No memory of where she had been. No signs of injury. Just... back.

There was a quote from her husband, who had spent months grieving her, convinced she was dead.

“At first, I thought it was a miracle. But... the longer she stayed, the more I realized it wasn’t her. Not really.”

The hairs on the back of my neck stood up. I scrolled further. The report ended abruptly, no follow-up, no conclusion, except for a single, ominous note at the bottom of the page:

“Vanished again. This time, for good.”

I stared at those words.

Vanished again.

I thought of Emily, standing at the window, unmoving. I thought of Murphy, refusing to acknowledge her. I thought of the way she felt beneath my hands, too cold.

And I realized something that should have been obvious from the start.

I wasn’t afraid of what had happened to her. I was afraid of what was waiting to happen next.

I shut the laptop.

My hands were shaking. I forced myself to breathe, steadying the panic rising in my chest.

Then I stood up and went to find my wife.

She was in the living room, sitting on the couch, her posture too straight, too still. She had been reading, or at least pretending to. Her book lay open on her lap, but her eyes weren’t moving.

She was just staring.

I cleared my throat. “Emily.”

Looked up at me. Smiled.

My mouth felt dry. “What happened in the woods?”

She tilted her head slightly, that small, distant smile still on her lips. “What do you mean?”

I took a step closer. “That day you got lost. What happened to you out there?”

Her expression didn’t change, but something about her felt different now. Lighter. Amused. Like I was asking the wrong questions. Like she was waiting for me to catch up.

“Why do you keep looking at me like that?” she asked.

My pulse stuttered. “Like what?”

She didn’t answer. She just kept smiling.

And suddenly, I felt like I wasn’t looking at my wife anymore.

Like something else was looking back.

I wasn't getting anything out of her, so I went back to trying to do more research.

\-

That night, I woke to a deep, suffocating stillness. Not just the silence of the house, not just the quiet of the woods outside. A stillness that felt wrong.

It was the kind of quiet that felt like it was waiting for something.

Instinctively, I reached for Emily, but the sheets beside me were cold.

I sat up, my heart hammering, already knowing where she was.

She was standing at the bedroom window. Her back was to me, her nightgown hanging loose over her frame, her arms limp at her sides.

She wasn’t moving. Wasn’t rocking on her feet, wasn’t shifting her weight. She stood like something propped upright, like if I touched her, she would tip over and shatter.

The moonlight poured in, outlining her in pale silver light. And for the first time, I realized how unnatural her stillness was.

I swallowed thickly, already swinging my legs over the bed. “Emily?”

She didn’t answer. She wasn’t even breathing again.

My fingers curled against the mattress. I forced myself to stand, step closer. I had spent so many nights ignoring this feeling, worried that doing something would make things worse.

But I couldn’t ignore it anymore. Not when she looked like this.

Her shoulders were trembling.

And then I saw it.

Her reflection in the glass.

She was crying.

Tears streaked down her face, catching the moonlight, slipping down her cheeks, but her expression didn’t change.

Her mouth didn’t quiver. Her brows didn’t furrow. Her face stayed eerily blank, her lips slightly parted, like her body had forgotten how to cry, like the tears were falling against her will.

A cold weight settled in my chest.

“Emily…” I stepped closer, my voice barely above a whisper.

Her shoulders twitched, the smallest movement I had seen from her in days.

Then, she spoke.

“I can’t blink,” she whispered.

The words didn’t make sense.

I swallowed, my hands curling into fists. “What do you mean?”

Slowly, she turned her head. The movement was painfully slow, like her body wasn’t used to moving this way anymore.

When her face finally turned to me, my breath hitched in my throat.

Her eyes.

They were too wide.

The skin beneath them was raw, darkened from exhaustion, but the whites of her eyes were dry, bloodshot.

How long had she been forcing herself to stay awake? How long had she been fighting this?

“If I blink...” she whispered.

The words caught in her throat, her lips trembling for the first time in days.

“... I’ll go back.”

I felt my pulse hammer against my ribs.

Her breath hitched, her body swaying slightly, her exhaustion pressing down on her like a weight.

She wasn’t going to last much longer. And then she looked at me.

Really looked at me.

And something deep inside her eyes was moving. A shadow behind the iris.

Something shifting, stretching, something waiting.

Her voice was barely a breath.

“I was never supposed to leave.”

Emily swayed on her feet, her breath coming in shallow gasps.

She was losing.

I could see it now, her body was failing. The exhaustion was finally catching up to her, wearing her down in ways that even she couldn’t fight anymore.

Her skin was too pale, her lips slightly parted as if breathing had become a conscious effort. Her muscles twitched involuntarily, tiny spasms rippling beneath her skin.

And for the first time, I realized this wasn’t Emily’s choice.

Whatever had happened in the woods, whatever she had become, it had been forced on her.

She didn’t want this. She was just trying to stay.

And she was losing.

“Emily, stay with me.”

I reached for her without thinking, my fingers brushing against her arm.

She flinched at the contact, her body tensing, but she didn’t pull away.

She just kept staring.

The tears still streamed down her face, silent, endless, like her body knew something she didn’t.

Or maybe... she did.

Maybe she had always known.

I swallowed hard. “You don’t have to do this alone.”

Her lips parted slightly, but no words came out. Her legs trembled.

She was about to fall.

I grabbed her shoulders, holding her up, my own body shaking now. “Just sit down, okay? You don’t have to-”

“I don’t want to go back.”

Her voice was hoarse, cracking under the weight of so much fear.

I tightened my grip. “Then you won’t.”

She shook her head weakly. “You don’t understand.”

Her fingers clutched at my shirt like she was trying to anchor herself to something real. Her body was burning through its last reserves, fighting the inevitable.

I had to keep her awake.

“Emily, look at me.”

She was looking at me. She had never stopped.

I ran my hands over her arms, trying to steady her. “Come on, just...  just sit down, drink some water, let’s figure this out, okay?”

She blinked.

No.

She almost blinked.

Her eyelids fluttered, just for a second, like a muscle spasm.

Her body was giving up.

Panic shot through me. “No, stay with me, stay with me-”

She sucked in a sharp, shuddering breath, fighting it. Her fingers dug into my skin, her grip weak but desperate.

“I can’t... I can’t...”

She swayed again, and I caught her, pulling her close, holding her upright.

“Just a little longer,” I pleaded. “Please, Emily.”

Her chest rose in one last, heavy breath.

Her fingers loosened.

Her eyelids fluttered.

And then she blinked.

I was still holding her.

Or at least, I thought I had been.

My arms were empty now, clutching at nothing but air.

No body. No weight.

She had been there just a second ago, warm and trembling against me. And now-

Gone.

I staggered back, my hands still hovering where she had been, my body refusing to understand what had just happened.

I looked around frantically. The room was empty.

No sign she had ever been there at all. No discarded clothes. No strands of hair on the pillow. No imprint in the bed where she had slept beside.

Just... absence.

The kind that felt permanent.

A soft breath of air stirred the curtains.

I turned slowly.

The window was open.

I knew for a fact it had been closed when I went to bed.

Outside, the trees stood still, their dark silhouettes waiting.

Watching.

The air felt thick, expectant. The woods were completely silent.

Not just still. Not just quiet.

Silent.

A sound broke the air, a small, familiar sound that felt somehow alien in this moment.

A tail thumping against the floor.

I turned my head, my stomach tightening. Murphy stood in the doorway, looking at me. And wagging his tail.

Not cautiously. Not hesitantly.

Just wagging.

For the first time in weeks, he stepped toward me.

Walked right up to me, pressed his nose against my hand.

Like everything was normal again. Like the house was whole again. Like she had never been here.

I sank onto the edge of the bed.

My hands were shaking. My head felt light, my vision narrowing, my thoughts refusing to make sense of what had just happened.

I swallowed hard, staring at the empty space beside me.

At the bed where she had slept.

Where we had laughed. Where we had lived.

I whispered, ""Emily?""

The word barely made a sound.

I already knew.

She somehow came back. A miracle in and of itself. Wanting to spend time together despite the conditions. But she was right, whatever happened to her out there, whatever she encountered, she was never supposed to leave. ",1,1738702085.0,CreepsMcPasta,0,1.0,False

Reposting again - here's to optimism and not giving up.

I am a 35 year old single nerd (yes, very unique on reddit), both in personal and professional life. I am an expat living in the Netherlands but originally from India(oh dear, Indian, run away!! )

Still here?... well read on..

I have been away from home for more than 12 years, for both educational and professional reasons. Last 3 years were spent in the Netherlands. I am not sure where I will be tomorrow - perhaps back in Asia or US - life takes you places, but I am here for now and the loneliness is getting to me. It has been more than a year since I dated anyone and I am finally at a point where both mind and body desire some affection and intimacy. I am looking for a connection - be it just friendship with the possibility of something more, but a connection nonetheless.

More about me:

On a fitness journey. Trying to work out at least 4 days a week and eating healthy. I am getting stronger but there is much work to be done. The latter part has been harder as I absolutely love food - I think it is the single greatest pleasure of life. Would love to connect with someone who is also into fitness or at least seriously considering getting into it so we can encourage each other as opposed to enabling the bad habits.

I like the usual nerdy things - gaming, fantasy and sci-fiction, manga, and the occasional anime. Not a requirement that you be a nerd but it helps :)

I am a lifelong tourist, love traveling and enjoy road trips. Been to over 30 countries, always looking forward to my next vacation, and want to see the whole world!

Other details about me:

* Introvert
* Much more shy and socially awkward than I would like to be :p
* Politically liberal/left
* Don't smoke or drink alcohol, but coffee is my poison!
* Vegetarian
* Love touch and adore cuddles :)
* Non Vanilla, but that is for (much) later ;)

I am generally an easy going and an agreeable person, but strong religious inclinations and an anti-science mindset are absolute deal breakers. This is already too long so lastly, I am looking for something IRL and would prefer speaking to people who are in the Netherlands or within short distances.

If my post resonates with you, do reach out and please leave an introduction.

Stay safe,

Cheers!",1,1738702054.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

I thought I’d take a moment to discuss TedsWoodworking Plans, which I have been using for the past few months. Being a great fan of woodworking and at the same time a sufferer of the scarcity of good plans, TedsWoodworking has been an incredibly useful website.

# [👉Click here to visit TedsWoodworking's Official website](https://82b49lclmcq82o8ou97ir-1o6w.hop.clickbank.net)

Getting Started

On my first visit to TedsWoodworking, I was so struck by the fact the site provided more than sixteen thousand different plans. The site boasted to have the ‘World’s Largest Collection of 16,000 Wood Plans. ’ Although I doubted it, given the statement, I thought I could give it a try since they have a 60-day money-back guarantee.

My First Project

Now one of the first activities that I tried on my own was a simple coffee table. When it came to the plans, these were well-laid out and clearly structured. Some of the projects were accompanied by guidelines and suggestions that were easy to follow to the next step. The specific dimension and parts list helped me with shopping and I was able to get all the materials in one go.

The diagrams were so useful. The instructions themselves were very instructive and I didn’t have any doubts in my woodworking skills. Another positive change was that the included CAD software tool could be customized to some extent.

Building a Dollhouse

Feeling inspired by the coffee table I created, I endeavored to construct a dollhouse for my daughter. The specific design plans demonstrated how the project would look like from this view or that angle. The materials list was correct and the instructions provided were clear. The dollhouse was done in the next two days and when my daughter saw my creation, she was so happy.

Additional Resources

The TedsWoodworking package also contains video lessons that provide visual examples of intricate methods. These tutorials were useful supplement and provided benefits in comprehending and completing these projects. It also provides a guide on how to start a woodworking business, which is quite interesting even if one does not intend to make business out of it.

Pros and Cons

Pros:

· Comprehensive Plans: The plans are for all levels of expertise, including the first time carpenter to the professional woodworker.

·  Detailed Instructions: Clear and comprehensive diagrams, and easy to follow visual instructions.

·  Additional Tools: It is beneficial to use the CAD software, as well as the set of video tutorials.

·  Community Support: There is an active community online, which contributes tips and valuable advice.

Cons:

· Overwhelming Volume: It makes the casual user overwhelmed by the number of plans that are available.

· Special Tools Needed: In some cases, tools or materials used in the plan may not be easily accessible in every household.

· It takes a long time to download resources.

Summary

In summary, TedsWoodworking has changed my woodworking experience in a positive way. The detailing of the plans, the extended range, and additional accessories make it a worthy investment regardless of one’s experience in woodworking. The bonuses of customer support and the possibility to communicate in the community increase the likeliness of approaching projects with more confidence and achieving the goals.

I must enlighten every woodworker out there to ensure that they do not miss out on TedsWoodworking plans. In general, people will always find some use in these plans whether they’re a newcomer or a veteran at the game.

The more difficult it is for artists to plan, budget, and deliver art to the playa, the less the event will have to offer new attendees, and the more ticket sales will be impacted in future years. This is both predictable and preventable.

**1. Decouple donations from ticket prices** 

It's great the Org is moving towards treating extra payments as tax-deductible donations. That's how it should be, these are charitable donations. Selling most tickets above cost is not a donation, it's a mandate. It's a tax. In the current lottery, it's a tax that hits artists indiscriminately and incentivizes gaming the system through low quality art installations and theme camps (""yes my LED-strip-on-a-stick really does need a 20-deep art support crew, promise"").

**2. Make it easier to fund artist initiatives directly** 

Want burners to fund burners via art grants? Invest in a platform to do so. Show individuals exactly where their donations are going, without fear of caveats related to world building or the Missionaria Protectiva or whatever this new evangelical corporate emphasis is. Partner with GoFundMe or someone else to create a burner-specific portal and hype the shit out of it. The current art grant program provides too little funding with so many burdensome requirements, it's often more trouble than it's worth, especially for small to mid-sized projects or new artists.

**3. Showcase regional burn artists and installations at the main event** 

Want to bring value from the culture crusades back home? Incentivize and enable more artists from across the globe to bring their work to the playa. Provide a pathway for the playa to experience what makes Kiwiburn or Afrikaburn distinct from BRC. If the main event is dying, infuse it with energy from where the Principles are growing and thriving. That's the kind of global mission I can get behind.

My energy levels were at rock bottom, and no matter how much coffee I drank, it felt like my brain was running on fumes. I couldn’t focus, couldn’t think clearly, and the fatigue wasn’t just physical—it was mental, emotional, and relentless.

That’s when I found what I now call my secret weapon.

At first, I was skeptical. I’d tried countless supplements promising to fix my low energy, sharpen my focus, or magically help me drop those stubborn pounds. Nothing ever lived up to the hype. But something about this product caught my attention. Maybe it was the science-backed ingredients. Maybe it was the glowing testimonials that felt like they were written by people who’d been exactly where I was. Or maybe it was just desperation. Either way, I decided to give it a shot.

Fast forward three months, and my life has completely transformed.

The first thing I noticed was the energy. Not the jittery, crash-prone energy you get from caffeine or sugary drinks. This was clean, sustained energy that powered me through the day like a finely tuned engine. I woke up feeling refreshed—something I hadn’t experienced in years—and stayed focused and productive from morning until night.

And the mental clarity? Let me tell you, it was like wiping a foggy window clean for the first time. I could think faster, remember details, and tackle complex problems without the overwhelming sense of mental fatigue that used to haunt me. For someone who lives and dies by their ability to perform, this was a game-changer.

Then came the physical changes.

I’d always struggled with weight, especially around my midsection. No matter how much I worked out or tried to eat clean, progress was always slow. But with this product, my metabolism felt like it shifted into high gear. Combined with my renewed energy, hitting the gym didn’t feel like a chore anymore.

Java Burn is a term used to refer to the potential weight loss benefits associated with consuming coffee or caffeine. In recent years, there has been growing interest in the relationship between coffee consumption and weight management. This article will explore whether Java Burn can indeed help with weight loss and discuss some important considerations.

# Java Burn and Metabolism:

One of the reasons Java Burn is believed to aid in weight loss is its potential impact on metabolism. Coffee contains caffeine, which is a natural stimulant that can increase metabolic rate. This means that consuming Java Burn may help your body burn more calories, even at rest. However, the effect of caffeine on metabolism varies among individuals, and the impact on weight loss may not be significant for everyone.

# Appetite Suppression:

Another potential benefit of Java Burn is its ability to suppress appetite. Caffeine can act as an appetite suppressant, making you feel less hungry and reducing the likelihood of overeating. This can indirectly contribute to weight loss by helping you maintain a calorie deficit.

# Energy Boost and Physical Performance:

Java Burn's caffeine content can also provide an energy boost, making it an appealing choice for those who engage in physical activities or exercise. Increased energy levels can lead to improved performance during workouts, potentially helping you burn more calories and fat. However, it's important to note that excessive caffeine consumption can have negative effects on sleep, hydration, and overall health. It's crucial to consume Java Burn in moderation and listen to your body's response.

# Considerations and Limitations:

While Java Burn may offer some potential benefits for weight loss, it's essential to consider certain factors and limitations. Firstly, the effects of caffeine can vary among individuals. Some people may experience increased heart rate, jitteriness, or digestive issues when consuming Java Burn. It's crucial to monitor your body's response and consult a healthcare professional if you have any concerns.

Additionally, Java Burn should not be seen as a magic solution for weight loss. It's important to adopt a holistic approach that includes a balanced diet, regular exercise, and overall healthy lifestyle habits. Relying solely on Java Burn without making other necessary changes may not yield significant weight loss results.

Ingredients in Java Burn:

1. Green Coffee Bean Extract: This ingredient is rich in chlorogenic acid, which is believed to have weight loss properties. It may help in boosting metabolism and reducing the absorption of carbohydrates.
2. Garcinia Cambogia: This tropical fruit extract contains hydroxycitric acid (HCA), which is believed to aid in weight loss by suppressing appetite and blocking the production of fat in the body.
3. Green Tea Extract: Known for its antioxidant properties, green tea extract may help in boosting metabolism and increasing fat oxidation. It also provides a natural source of caffeine, which can improve energy levels.
4. Raspberry Ketones: These natural compounds derived from raspberries may help in increasing the breakdown of fat cells and regulating metabolism.
5. Chromium Picolinate: This mineral is essential for normal insulin function and may help in regulating blood sugar levels. It may also have a positive impact on appetite control and weight management.
6. L-Theanine: Found in green tea, L-Theanine is an amino acid that promotes relaxation and reduces stress. It may also help in improving focus and concentration.

Please note that the specific formulation and concentration of these ingredients may vary depending on the brand of Java Burn.

What is Java Burn?﻿

Java Burn is a powdered supplement designed to be mixed into your coffee. Unlike traditional weight loss pills or shakes, Java Burn is unique because it dissolves seamlessly in your morning coffee without adding any taste. According to the manufacturers, Java Burn is formulated to enhance the fat-burning process by boosting your metabolism and improving your body’s ability to burn calories more efficiently. The supplement contains natural ingredients known to help in weight loss, all without any harmful stimulants or additives.

Ingredients of Java Burn

One of the key factors that people consider before using any supplement is its ingredients. What are the ingredients in Java Burn that make it effective? The product is made up of several natural compounds that are known to aid weight loss:

Green Tea Extract: Known for its antioxidant properties, green tea extract can boost metabolism and increase fat burning.

Chlorogenic Acid: This compound, found in coffee, reduces the absorption of carbohydrates in the digestive system, helping to prevent fat buildup.

L-Theanine: An amino acid that works to improve focus and reduce anxiety, making it an excellent complement to the caffeine in coffee.

Chromium: This mineral regulates blood sugar levels, helping to curb appetite and reduce cravings.

These ingredients work synergistically to deliver the promised benefits of increased fat burning and improved metabolism. Users have reported significant results, praising the supplement for helping them lose weight without the jitters or crashes often associated with caffeine-heavy products.",1,1738701470.0,KibbexKpop,3,1.0,False

My wife and I (25M, 25F) are rather heavily considering Portland as our next home. I like to think that we'd fit into the vibes of Portland rather well and would really appreciate the community & culture, walkability, artsy aspects of the city, and the surrounding nature quite a bit.

We are originally from Utah (but are not religious, I myself being Buddhist if anything). I have a remote job working as an engineer at an ISP, making \~65k pre-tax/year, but she will need to find a job in the area during or post-move, and typically we rake in \~80-95k per year pre-tax.

I personally have always dreamed of living in the PNW, as the rainforest climate really appeals to me -- I get weak in the knees for all sorts of trees (especially pines), fern, waterfalls, and moss, and have always found such kinds of climates truly beautiful and breathtaking. I am a pretty big metalhead & pothead, and love coffee, so the local concerts, legalized weed, and surplus of coffee shops are plusses for me 😄

We both think Portland is absolutely stunning, and I feel we'd mesh with the laid back, slow-life & hippie vibes of the city, and that it would be a really cool place to live. We love the ideas of visiting farmers markets, art galleries, museums, shopping for cool stuff at used-goods stores, the rain, the community/neighbourhoody aspects of the town, walking our dog in beautiful scenery, and especially want to explore the surrounding beaches, forests, mountains and nature.

We dont mind living a bit in the suburbs as we prefer a quiet and calm life, and can drive to the fun when we want, least until we get a better lay of the land and more settled in the area.

Our next move is between Portland or SLC and I'm really hoping Portland is a good pick because I'm already in love with the place and think it'd be way cooler than SLC! That said, we are have not lived in many large cities, I've lived in a few cities (Fresno, and Vegas for a time), but we have largely have stuck to medium-sized college towns for the most part, so Portland would certainly be our biggest city we've lived in, so we are curious to hear resident's experiences in terms of safety, crime, and CoL in the Portland area. What areas are recommended? Is living in the suburbs west of the river a good option for newcomers?

Really appreciate anyone's time in responding here, hoping that Portland works for us and that I can finally live my PNW wonderland dreams haha. Much love everyone ✌️",0,1738701465.0,askportland,51,0.47,False

I few weeks ago I matched with this guy on tinder. We started talking and we figured out we are studying the same thing at the same university. One day, I was going home and I accidentally bumped into him on the bus. He said he will company me, since we live at the same direction...at the end we realized, we are neighbours.
The connection started out pretty strong. Good messages, we had a lot of attraction but I told him I wouldn't want to have sex with him yet. I just moved to this new country and I am having health issues due to my autoimmune disease, sometimes it can cause problems during sex (I was misdiagnosed and treated bad at my home country as I found out just now). He seemed understanding and said he is willing to wait. However, since then his interest decreased a lot?

He still invites me to grab breakfast, or coffee, and sometimes asks if I am in the lab via text, but when I answer, he doesn't even reads the message. The next day same thing happens, asks if I am in the lab, I answer, and nothing. Also, I noticed when we talk in person about something (for example a trip to a place) he says: ""we should go"" but never follows through. During the weekend, I get either one text a day or no text which is ridiculous cause he is my neighbour.
Also, it did happen that I didn't see his ""are you in the lab"" message, and he called me on video chat. I declined and asked why he called, and his answer was ""just wanted to see you"". YOU ARE MY NEIGHBOUR, just knock on my door.

It is kinda hard, cause when I meet him accidentally at uni, he seems interested. Keeps the conversation going (even on socials, cause sometimes I just get annoyed and not answering to him. And then he asks how I am doing...), however, it kinda feels like he is playing with me or something.
So, is he gaslighting me, or just simply stupid? I think I need to hear the honest opinion about this.

I know he is a stoner btw. At least that is what he told me. Not sure if this information even adds anything to the context though.",2,1738701304.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

I'm compiling a list of some of the best places in the First State for a story to beat cabin fever this winter season for Delaware Online/The News Journal.

Feel free to comment here, DM me, or email me at [afries@delawareonline.com](mailto:afries@delawareonline.com) to share your preferred ""third places.""

1ihrm4u,https://www.reddit.com/r/redscarepod/comments/1ihrm4u/anyone_have_adhd_but_choose_not_to_take_meds/,Anyone have ADHD but choose not to take meds?,"Just thinking out loud really. Probably more of a rant than a question. I've seen some good ADHD takes here that aren't mindlessly echoing the psychiatric zeitgeist (and don't necessarily fall into dumb knee-jerk anti-psychiatry).

I'm diagnosed with ADHD and think I actually have it. I've second-guessed it a ton, I am quite convinced that it wouldn't exist if we didn't have to spend so much time doing tasks that are so abstract/convoluted/bureaucratic/unengaging. My view at the moment is that some people adapt better than others to these conditions, and those that really struggle need some chemical help.

I've been medicated before and the meds do help me get work done in a far more painless/frictionless way. It does bridge some sort of gap between my own neurobiology and the type of person modern life demands I am.

At the same time though, it doesn't feel good or authentic. They feel like worker bee pills that provide a robotic focus, make me feel less social and more uptight. I'm better adapted to work and similar stuff but I'm less myself.

Working and doing admin shit without them: I'm more myself but all this stuff is far, far more of a drag.

Part of me is tempted to get back on meds and try to lock in and pull myself into a decent career (currently languishing as a low-level IT guy). Even if this works, I don't actually have any interest in this stuff. And what happens when the next shortage hits, and I've gotten myself into a higher-up job but suddenly I can't focus on any of this dry technical stuff, or feign interest in any of the bullshit?

Also I live in the UK and earn under 30k, and the NHS fucked up my Right to Choose referral so I have to pay full private fees for all of the psychiatrist BS, medication costs, etc. I kind of resent paying this much for what are mostly ""work pills"" when I'm not even well compensated. 

Thing is though, if I stay unmedicated, I don't see myself staying the course doing these weird, fake, abstract but stressful white collar jobs. 

I also resent potentially becoming dependent on a chemical, having my dopamine receptors downregulated, probably feeling worse than baseline when off the meds, when the benefit is mostly just performing better at stupid jobs.

I could try and find a job in a quiet-ish pub or coffee shop. The money I'd take home on minimum wage isn't that different to what I'd make doing office or low-level IT shit if I deduct the cost of private ADHD treatment, so there's no actual financial argument unless I try to push myself into some kind of higher career. But that would still involve wasting precious moments on this earth studying shit I'm not interested in, and I'd probably burn out before anything comes of it. So maybe just drop out of the screen-based work thing?

I could take meds but only when I'm NOT at work? Just do the bare minimum in this bullshit economy and have the extra focus to learn skills and do projects (or just finally read Hegel properly or some other thing I've never stuck with)?

1ihrk8n,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ihrk8n,The First Tea That Really Got My Attention,"You could say that this was the one that started it all. 

I came across this Gyokuro Genmai after giving up coffee and exploring my local Asian Market for replacements. This would be the first of many teas which I would purchase there and serves as my guide into the vast world of Camellia sinensis. I came home, brewed a cup and found myself tumbling head over heels as I transitioned from one brew to another. 

Here are my tasting notes for this particular Gyokuro Genmaicha. 

Dry Aroma: Grassy yet floral with notes of nori and zucchini, strong matcha latte vibe.

Wet Aroma: Toasted rice and edamame. Very cozy. 

First Infusion: Very light green soup with great clarity. An herbaceous bright sip that wraps around your tongue and finishes with puffed rice nostalgia as it fades away a grassy vegetal note brings you home to your next sip. 

Second Infusion: A light jade soup, mostly clear with a bit of haze. A deeper vegetal sip, toasty but with a zucchini like finish and rather delicate nuances. Just a touch of astringency at the end. Reminds me of late spring. 

Third Infusion: A vibrant yellow chartreuse soup. All rice on the nose. Wilted greens up front and toasted grains in the back. Pumpkin notes are all that remain. 

I would definitely recommend this Gyokuro Genmai, it made it very easy for me to leave coffee behind and has encouraged me to continue pursuing the wide variety of tea which is available. I have enjoyed every second of this transition including and especially the incorporation of Gong fu style into the brewing process. 

Gyokuro is a shade grown Japanese green tea, Genmai is a green tea with toasted rice.  

“The name ""gyokuro"" translates to ""jewel dew"" or “jade dew.”[…] While most sencha is from the Yabukita (薮北) cultivar of Camellia sinensis, gyokuro is often made from a specialized variety such as Asahi, Okumidori, Yamakai, and Saemidori. Most gyokuro is grown in the Fukuoka, Kyoto, and Mie prefectures[…] The shading causes both the amino acid L-theanine and the alkaloid caffeine in the tea leaves to increase, and the catechins and tannins to decrease, which yields significant differences from the flavor of sencha[…] Gyokuro also has higher chlorophyll content, which accounts for the dark green color of the leaves. These chemical differences lead to unique flavor and aroma of the tea, giving it more umami, a savory sweetness, and less bitterness and astringency.”

The ""Summer Lady"" strawberry lemonade had such a lovely salmon color that I'm blown away by the ruby red of this one. Can't wait to see the final color after everything has been filtered and bottled. I bought blueberry cheese coffee cakes to enjoy with this week's batch, peeking out from behind the growler for those with keen eyes.

I'll be bottling this one tomorrow evening. I taste everything several times, so I always know pretty much what it will taste like after both ferments and once it's cold. This one is going to be a mildly sweet soda with bright raspberry notes. I hoped for more peach flavor, but I'll remedy that next time by designing a different, peach-specific recipe. I don't like to call anything a failure just because it didn't meet expectations - everything gets a name and goes in my recipe book unless it's inedible. This will be recipe #2.

I'll have more pics, a more detailed recipe, and my own critique to share once the bottles are cold! Hope to meet more of you in a few days.

__Recipe__
- 20oz (567g) peaches (peeled, pitted, and diced)
- 10oz (283g) raspberries (stems and leaves removed)
- 1 or 2 entire lemon peels, muddled well (optional, can use zest instead, brightens the flavors, gives aromatics)
- >100oz water (more if you remove the meat and pulp before fermenting, I leave it in)
- 3/4c (150g) cane sugar
- 1g (1/5th packet) Lalvin EC-1118 (champagne) yeast
- 1 gallon fermentation jug and burp valve
- 6 to 8 - 500ml / 3 to 4 - 1 litre grolsch bottles

I always prefer frozen ripe fruit, but you can choose whatever works best for you. Add the diced peaches with water until just covered to a pot and cook until very tender. The flavor is light, believe it or not, so cooking low and slow for a little while will really help perk up the flavor in the final soda. AFTER the peaches are cooked, add the raspberries, bring to just a boil, then remove from the heat.

Initial ferment in the larg jug with a burp valve for 24 hours at room temperature. Secondary fermentation for 12 hours in grolsh bottles at room temperature. My house averages 70F (21C) and everything does well. Burp bottles (VERY) carefully before refrigerating.

Can be pasteurized to 160-170F (70-77C) to prevent further fermentation, and allows for secondary bottling and longer-term storage at room temp, but this will kill beneficial organisms (helpful to understand, especially if using whey, preferments, or other probiotics).

I thought I would come on here and ask for some advice because I’m very confused about what’s going on with me and I’m starting to suspect hypoglycemia but I’m not totally sure. Anyways, a year ago I was over weight and ate nothing but junk food. In late March of 2024, I decided to change my diet and loose weight. I cut every junk food imaginable out of my diet and began counting my calories. I lost 40lbs and hit 112lbs in June!! I’ve been maintaining 112lbs ever since and have been continuing my healthy diet in order to stay slim and maintain my weight. However, beginning in August, I noticed almost that every single night I started having symptoms of low blood sugar. I feel tingly, dizzy, my heart palpitates, I get sweaty, shaky, and I even feel lethargic. I’ve been dealing with it ever since. This happens a lot when I fast (usually when I hit the 13 or 14 hour mark in my fast) but can also happen on days/nights that I’m not fasting. Now, if I eat a bowl of cereal or a protein bar or something like that when I’m experiencing symptoms of low blood sugar (typically late at night), I’ll feel fine for like 15 min and then BOOM, my blood sugar sky rockets and I feel like I’m on a crazy sugar high for like 45 min at the most. It almost feels like I drank 3 cups of coffee if I had to describe it. However, I only get this reaction from those types of foods (cereals, protein bars, rice cakes) if I eat them when I’m having a low blood sugar episode. Otherwise, if I eat them when I’m feeling fine, nothing happens as my blood sugar does not spike. It only spikes when I eat slightly sugary items whilst my sugar is low. I’m very confused as to what’s happening with me because i have no explanation for the cause of my low blood sugar and the intense reaction to slightly sugary foods when they are consumed during a low blood sugar episode ",2,1738700410.0,Hypoglycemia,0,1.0,False

1ihr98l,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1ihr98l/cuisinart_dgb400_grind_and_brew_coffeemaker/,Cuisinart DGB-400 Grind and Brew Coffeemaker review: Is it worth the hype?,"For someone who starts their day with a good, strong cup of coffee, the Cuisinart DGB-400 Automatic Grind and Brew 12-Cup Coffeemaker has been an intriguing addition to my kitchen. On paper, this machine promises everything. A built-in grinder, programmable options, and a sleek design make it seem like the ultimate coffee-lover's dream. But does it deliver? Here's my take, based on testing it daily for about three weeks.

**Design & Build Quality**  
This machine looks pretty slick sitting on my countertop. The black and stainless steel build gives it a modern, classy vibe, and it's compact enough to not hog too much space. At about 8 inches deep and 10 inches wide, it’s not a bulky beast, which I appreciate. However, the plastic parts feel a little less durable than I'd hoped. After a few accidental bumps while cleaning, I started to worry about their longevity. The included glass carafe is sturdy, though, and the lid closes tightly, preventing spills. One thing that stood out to me was the permanent gold-tone filter—it’s a nice touch for reducing waste, though you can still use paper filters if that’s your jam.

[Curious about Cuisinart DGB-400’s cost? Check it out on Amazon here.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/product-reviews/cuisinart-dgb-400-coffee-maker-review-b08dck4mpv/)

**Brewing Performance**  
The brewing process is fairly straightforward. The grinder kicks in as soon as you start it, and I’ll admit, it sounds like a small jet engine. It’s loud—like, wake-the-house-up loud—but it gets the job done. I tested both the full 12-cup capacity and the 1-4 cup setting. For someone brewing just two cups most mornings, the latter is a lifesaver. The coffee comes out piping hot if you use the 1-4 setting, but oddly, the full pot brew tends to be a tad less warm. Speed-wise, the machine is decent, taking about 8-10 minutes for a full pot. Not lightning-fast, but acceptable for fresh-ground coffee.

**Coffee Flavor**  
The taste? Oh, it’s good. The built-in grinder makes a noticeable difference in the flavor profile. Beans ground seconds before brewing provide a fresher, fuller-bodied cup of coffee. I experimented with different beans—medium roast, dark roast, even a decaf blend—and the results were consistently satisfying. The only downside was the grinder’s one-size-fits-all setting. It’s not adjustable, which might bother someone who prefers finer or coarser grinds for specific beans. Personally, I’d have liked a little more control here.

**Cleaning & Maintenance**  
Let’s talk about the not-so-fun part: cleaning. The Cuisinart DGB-400 has a self-clean feature, which sounds like a dream. In reality, while it helps with descaling, you still need to clean several components manually after each use. The grinder, in particular, requires regular attention because coffee grounds get stuck in crevices. Taking it apart and putting it back together can be a bit tedious. If you’re someone who wants a quick rinse-and-go cleanup experience, this might be a dealbreaker.

**Pros**

* Freshly ground coffee elevates the flavor.
* Compact and modern design fits most kitchens.
* Programmable features, like auto-start and 1-4 cup settings, are super convenient.
* Includes a reusable gold-tone filter, cutting down on waste.
* Keeps coffee warm for up to two hours with its auto-shutoff feature.

**Cons**

* Loud grinding noise might wake up the whole household.
* Non-adjustable grinder limits customization.
* Cleaning can be time-consuming due to multiple removable parts.
* Brew temperature varies slightly depending on the batch size.
* Plastic components don’t feel as durable as the rest of the build.

**Comparison to Competitors**  
Compared to similar models, like the Breville Grind Control or the Keurig K-Duo Plus, the Cuisinart DGB-400 stands out for its simplicity and affordability. The Breville offers adjustable grind sizes and a sleeker interface but comes at a significantly higher price point. Meanwhile, the Keurig K-Duo Plus sacrifices the fresh-ground experience for versatility, allowing you to use K-Cups or ground coffee. If fresh, flavorful coffee is your priority and you can live with a bit of noise, the Cuisinart punches above its weight. However, it slightly underperforms in grind customization and ease of maintenance.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**  
While I can’t put an exact price tag on it (prices fluctuate), the DGB-400 is positioned in the mid-range category. You’re getting a grinder and brewer in one, which saves both money and counter space. That said, if you’re a perfectionist about grind settings or hate cleaning multiple parts, you might feel the value falls short. For its price range, though, it's a solid contender for those who want convenience and good coffee without spending a fortune.

**Features & Settings**  
This machine is packed with features that coffee lovers will appreciate. The programmable timer ensures you wake up to a freshly brewed pot, and the Brew Pause function lets you sneak a cup mid-brew. I found the auto-shutoff feature practical, especially for someone who forgets to turn appliances off. The grind-off option is also great when using pre-ground coffee. However, the limited grinding capacity might annoy heavy coffee drinkers who prefer a full 12-cup batch. The water reservoir comes with a charcoal filter, which is a nice bonus for improving water quality.

&nbsp;

I'm primarily looking to trade for games from my **[wishlist](https://redd.it/zw7tvs/)**, otherwise I am also open to selling them. I am not interested in games I already have, only exception are some co-op games, and all games I'm getting for myself are activated on my own account. Other than that feel free to offer your list of Steam games and something I may not have and fulfills my criteria I could/would be willing to trade for it/them.

* To trade you must respond to this thread first, I will not respond or accept anyone outside of this thread, only exception are unless we've traded more than once before.
* Only interested in trading for games on Steam.
* I don't do Humble gifts whether receiving or giving, all my keys are in unrevealed form right after purchase.
* No interest in any keys from an unofficial retailer/source (aka grey market), curator/reviewer keys (aka beta/reviewer/beta-testing/etc.), keys for games that are already free on Steam itself, Steam profile-limited keys, although some interest in VR-titles and/or de-listed games (no banned games).
* Anything marked as wishlist/paypal, it's self-explanatory and I won't look through lists.
* All my keys are EU keys, if you are outside of EU, make sure you double check for any region locks for your country. For quite a few which I was aware of I already listed the region lock, however this is not my responsibility as I did specify the key's region.
* When buying, I only accept payments in Euro's. Minimum purchase of €1,00. Fees are on buyer.

If you're either trading or buying please state the game(s) you are interested in and your offer (game(s)/list/price).

1ihr7lt,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ihr7lt/second_hand_aguila_420_no_experience_with/,Second Hand Aguila 420 - No experience with espresso [No budget],"I've been on a coffee journey for a long time. But I never dabbled with an at home espresso machine. I'm fluent in speaking V60, Aeropress, French press, mokapot... So all kinds of brewing methods with the exclusion of espresso. Is it worth it if I have all those other things?

I have the possibility to buy a second hand Nespresso Aguila 420 from a coffee shop nearby where I'm a regular client. They told me they bought it for 12,500,- EUR (excl. VAT) in september 2020. Because of lockdowns they didn't start using it until mei 2021. So it has been in use for around 3 years and 8 months.

So my questions are:

What are your experiences with this machine and is worth it or overkill as a starting point for me? (note that I would buy it with my company, without going into too much details it just means I'll not have to pay it with my personal money, so the financial burden is way less a factor in my decision).

What price would you consider it be a decent offer for both the seller and myself?",1,1738700021.0,espresso,3,1.0,False
1ihr7eq,https://www.reddit.com/r/motherinlawsfromhell/comments/1ihr7eq/mil_saga_continues_helping_edition/,MIL saga continues (helping edition),"So I posted a few weeks ago maybe even last week about MIL asking if I was helping with said coffee van that my husband has got, as well as some other things.

Well on Saturday it was our first big event! We did super well. 

She came and posted it all over Facebook but only tagged my husband. I am apart of it, I helped set it up. I am supporting him and I told him to go ahead and do it. 

Anyways my husband pointed this out to her on her post which I think has aggravated her. Anyways I told her I felt upset with the way she was going on all the time. but wtf, she constantly was changing it into it upset her and that she no longer will ask us if we need help. 

She also said that we both don’t know how to run a business and we need all the help we can get. Etc in a huge paragraph.

I stopped her from going any futher as I put ‘all I wanted was a sorry I made you feel that way, it was a misunderstanding’

But once I say that she says ‘wow it works both ways’

So me being me says ‘sorry if I have upset you but you have still upset me’

She replys ‘same’

I’m kicking myself for saying sorry for something I haven’t done.

Am I right in thinking she’s an absolute narcissist or what? All I wanted was her to acknowledge how I felt and apologise not turn it into a paragraph of how me or husband doesn’t know how to run a buisness when we do… I caved and said sorry if I upset her which I shouldn’t have and she only said sorry 10 minutes later not straight away.

I am now at the point of cutting her off it’s gone so far now. She is so horrible man.  ",7,1738700008.0,motherinlawsfromhell,1,0.9,False

I think that's quite expensive compared to the previous version.

1ihr6oz,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/1ihr6oz/28m_lets_chat_about_anything_today/,28M Let's chat about anything today,"I'm looking to make some new friends on here. Work is usually slow during the weekdays, so I'm on here looking to chat. Usually, I am always able to chat most of the time or day. Looking for something long-term or can just be short-term. I'm down to share photos, too. 

I've been drinking a lot of tea lately, too. I'm trying to see what is the best stuff to out in tea for taste and for health. Just started growing some herbs to put in the tea. Coffee, I recently tried grinding beans, and it really does make a huge difference. So, I've been trying different coffee beans to see what's best.

I'm into all kinds of different hobbies. I'm really into houseplants and aquarium keeping. I have over 100 different houseplants. I just got a small greenhouse now, too. I'm in the process of setting up a fish tank room. I have 4 tortoises that also live in the fish tank room until I build them an outside enclosure. 

I'm into video games, too. I mainly play Marvel Rivals, Valorant, Overwatch, Fortnite, and CS2. I built a PC to play on a couple of years ago. I also have a switch that I play pokemon and mario games mainly on. Just got a steam deck, too, and been tinkering around with it. So, if you know any good emulators or anything for it, then let me know.

I haven’t experienced any major firmware or software issues for the most part, and I do love my Aiden so far. However, the carafe just does not keep coffee warm for longer than an hour or two. I’m disappointed in the length of time it keeps my coffee warm, especially considering what’s stated on the product page:

*A double-wall thermal carafe keeps coffee warm and tasting its best, avoiding burnt or bitter notes from hot plates. For maximum warmth, brew into the carafe when making large batches or into a mug for single serve.*

I’m hoping Fellow will address this for all of us who were expecting a carafe that keeps coffee warm for multiple hours. Otherwise, I absolutely love my Aiden!",3,1738699925.0,FellowProducts,5,0.72,False
1ihr53s,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ihr53s/prefer_stock_profitec_basket_to_vst_18g_ridgeless/,Prefer stock Profitec basket to VST 18g ridgeless [Profitec Jump and Eureka Mignon Libra],"I have a new Profitec Jump and Eureka Mignon Libra, bought at Christmas sale. It included a bottomless portafilter with a 21g basket, whereas the stock spouted portafilter has an 18g tapered basket.

I’m using a very medium roast from the local roaster across the street, and dialled the 18g basket in pretty well for my taste at right around an 18g in 36g out recipe. I decided to order two 18g ridgeless VST baskets to have consistency with the two portafilters as I use both of them. 

Well, after adjusting the grind one full number finer on the Mignon to match the recipe I’m really struggling to dial the VST in to my taste. It’s always very bitter even when going to a 90C brew temp, pulling short, grinding coarser, less dose, etc. I’m beginning to think it’s simply not appropriate for the coffee I have. I’m much preferring the shots I get out of the stock 18g basket. 

Anyone else? I’m looking at either just ordering another Profitec 18g basket or suffering the indignity of swapping them every time I need one or the other. I was also looking at the IMS E&B Lab Super Fine Filter Basket. Any experience with those?

This reminds me of fly fishing lines and trying to find the perfect one without dropping $100 each time, only to find that it’s not exactly what you want.

Video shows how the brew starts really slow but speeds up a bit towards the end and makes some foam (not really my goal).",15,1738699816.0,mokapot,1,1.0,False
