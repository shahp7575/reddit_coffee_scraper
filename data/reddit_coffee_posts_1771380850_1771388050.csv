The Black Hand was not a movement so much as a virus, a feverish dream. An underground brotherhood born from wounded nationalism, sworn in secrecy to reshape history through the only tactic its members respected, violence. These men craved violence like most desire food, drink, or women. Made up of officers, conspirators, and essentially any young man willing to die for an idea. Founded in 1911 in Serbia, the Black Hand emerged from the militant nationalism among the citizens after decades of Ottoman decline and Austro-Hungarian expansion. Its goal was simple - unite all Serbs by any means necessary regardless of international consequences. The Hand treated assassination as policy and martyrdom as a currency. The Black Hand did not think in terms of morality. They thought in terms of leverage. One empire, one symbol, one clean shot. When the group armed the boys of Sarajevo, they weren’t trying to start a World War. Instead, they were attempting to prove that power could be stolen from the greedy men who rule the world by common ones operating amongst the shadows. They succeeded, but not in any way they had imagined. After the group’s assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the rest of the world went to war. The Black Hand did not collapse upon a bonfire of its own ideology. Instead, it was strangled by the very state it claimed to serve. In 1917, the Serbian leader decided this group was too secretive, too uncontrollable. Its members were arrested on trumped up charges, tried in a show trial, and executed by firing squad.

It is the third of March, 2018 when Cade decides he is ready to leave. His family had fallen away over the years, the inevitable slow erosion of time that decimates all families. He circles his adopted town, Tucson, saying his few goodbyes. There is the mad scientist type he knows from the smoke shop who could talk for hours about glass work or holocaust deniers. They would discuss Proust and Kant, and though Cade didn’t know much about either writer, he would humor the man by listening attentively. Their conversations had grown personal to the point where he knew the man’s entire world view and the people that inhabit it. They never see one another outside the smoke shop, but there is a peculiar kind of closeness there.

Then there is the twenty-something gas station attendant who loved to discuss death metal. Cade had once asked the kid why he liked death metal so much. The kid peered at Cade as if the question was completely foreign and needless. The answer: It’s loud. Loud is enough of an answer.

There was the diminutive Thai woman who gave him a massage every few months. She would discuss her personal life while walking on his back. She never asked him any questions about his own life, nor did he volunteer any of these details, and yet Cade felt as if he knew her intimately.

It was strange, the way Cade had collected these people, never truly knowing them or letting them know him, but still there was a rapport, a connection. Cade can vanish from their lives without any emotional wreckage left behind, but he feels some need to close the loop with these people. As if vanishing without a word would leave a hole, something left undone in his life and maybe theirs.

There is no packing to be done really. He will leave it all for someone else to clean up. He has a few sets of clothes, a gray summer suit. He packs a handgun, though he isnt’t really sure why. He has all the materials he will need. Yet the heft of the gun in his duffel bag makes him feel safer in his plans. He maps out the trip on his phone, though he doesn’t have much need for a route. He is headed east, and as long as he keeps going in that direction, he will eventually find where he was headed.

A fog creeps through the mountain passes, snaking toward his vehicle in the distance. There is no hurry. He has no responsibilities toward anything living except himself. His dog, Harley, who he had loved the most in this world after his family wintered, had died a month ago. The loss had shattered him. He had not realized until she was gone just how central to his life she had become. He would talk to her about politics, movies, his deepest thoughts and feelings. When the veterinarian had told Cade the prognosis, he had been overcome by a purge of emotions long buried. He was tired of loss, tired of living through the ends of others. Better to be the one that leaves than the one left.

Gary Plauche’ was a father who decided that the justice system moved too slowly for the crime committed against his son. When the man who kidnapped, raped, and filmed Gary’s child was caught, Gary waited for the man’s extradition to Louisiana. Plauche’ waited in an airport hallway, calm and deliberate, stalking his prey, and shot the man on live television. Plauche’ left no manifesto, planned no escape, no denial, just a line he would not allow crossed. The court gave him probation, the public gave Plauche’ sympathy, and the story lingered because its implications sat in an uncomfortable space - where vengeance looked heroic, where murder appeared justified, and where that single moment forced everyone watching the TV to ask what they would have done if they were victims and the punishment did not seem to equal the crime.

I-10 is a long, monotonous highway connecting Tucson to El Paso. The highway runs the length of the country, but it is a straight, colorless drive. Its only personality is provided by the changing topography of the country itself. The world outside of Tucson still seems exotic to Cade after 25 years of living there. Endless stretches of burnt red Sonoran desert sand filled with ocotillo, prickly pear and creosote bush. The mountains give the landscape some shape but otherwise it is an inhospitable expanse of dirt and dust. Cade wonders how many bodies - buried or not – lay scattered out there. There are endless stories living out there in the desert, despite how untouched it all looks from the highway.

Cade’s Chevy Tahoe lumbers through the miles, chugging through gasoline in the heat. Cade opens his window and almost immediately begins to sweat. His chest opens from the dry desert air. He takes the route onto I-20 towards Dallas. The skyscrapers become visible well outside the city, and it rises like a mirage in his vision. He loops the city twice before checking into a Ritz Carlton hotel in Uptown Dallas. The building is a gaudy pink mauve rather than the usual sleek design of an upscale hotel. He feels strangely let down by the surroundings. His suite, however, with its cool gray lighting and stark white bedding are more in line with his expectations for a four star hotel. He draws a bath and soaks for a long time. It’s two hours before he hears the knock.

Her name is Melissa. She looks quietly put together in jeans and a white blouse, like how an actress meeting a journalist to discuss her new role might. She has a delicate, heart shaped face with a softly pointed chin, high prominent cheek bones giving her face a sculpted, elegant demeanor. Her lips are full, especially the bottom one, with almond shaped, distinctive hazel eyes. Her blond hair has the color of honey and is worn loose and wavy. She is petite at five foot three, with a delicate frame. She looks so much like his daughter that he is at a loss for words and stands awkwardly in the doorway of the room. This wasn’t the plan. He had wanted a high-end call girl, but he doesn’t wanted to be reminded of his daughter. She doesn’t resemble the pictures online. He’d been very careful in his selection of woman, but it’s obvious the service had sent over who they had available. Not that Melissa isn’t beautiful, but Cade did not want reminders of the past. The present is the only form of time in which he is comfortable. Finally he invites her in and offers her some champagne which she takes, faintly sipping the bubbles. She smiles at him, asking Cade his name. He walks to the bed and sits down, examining the woman closely. She appears uncomfortable in the silence. He mentions the resemblance to his daughter and she softens. She asks about his daughter, and before he knows it, the words are spilling from his mouth. He describes everything about his daughter, her life, her dreams, her faults. She listens without judgement. Maybe this is a common occurrence among her clients? Maybe lonely men order her services when they reallyy just want to talk, to lay their souls bare. Cade keeps talking. An hour passes. Melissa has barely said a word. She’s a good listener. Occasionally she sips her drink or takes a bite of chocolate from the platter on the nightstand.

Eventually Cade returns to the present. He asks her about her life, what it’s like. She reminds him of his daughter even in her truth. She’s from a tiny border town south of Dallas. She likes to travel. She has a wild streak that she keeps from her family, which is now only her sister and an estranged brother, in any case. She talks of her mom, who did her best despite the lack of money. Her dad, a wild sort himself, was never around for longer than six months at a stretch. He worked in sales, some kind of software that took him around the world. Melissa believes he had more than one family, and he never married her mother. He was terrible with money, alternating between grandiose generosity, showering them with gifts and buying them whatever they asked for, and complete poverty. There was no sense in it. Even as a girl Melissa could see that, but her father never did. He would blow his paychecks within a week or two, then skimp by until another payday came along. He rarely paid child support, but one year he bought Melissa a pony. Though there was nowhere for the pony to live, nor money to care for it, so somewhere along the way it was sold. Something about the banal sadness of Melissa’s childhood makes Cade cry – not bawling, but silent and wistful, like a movie that evokes a quiet sorrow.

Finally, Melissa returns to business. She tells him her fee, and he unfolds his wallet and lays the bills on the nightstand. She asks him what he likes, but the memories of his daughter keep flooding back to him. Cade asks her if she would just keep listening for a little while more. She nods. He begins to tell her what he wished he could have told his daughter before she died. The words have haunted him since her death, and now they come out like a torrential downpour. It is a confession, an apology, a contrition. At some point, Cade kisses her. Afterward, they look at each other awkwardly, as if some sort of unspoken line has been crossed. She hesitantly asks if he would like to get undressed, and he says no. The two remain quiet for a long time. She walks to the window and peers out at the view of the Dallas skyline. There is gray smog off in the distance, the sunset being strangled by haze. Cade feels a guilt creeping up inside of him, one that he can’t quite place, but it lurks there for the rest of the time he has with Melissa.

After she leaves, he masterbates. He orgasms after less than a minute. Sitting in the ropey mess he thinks about his family. With the release, he feels a wave of emotion as all the mistakes he made come flooding back to him in one twisted, black, haunted memory. As a young man, Cade had built a bridge. He got a job in South Carolina on a construction crew, and he spent a year grinding on that bridge, the deck, the substructure, the abutment, the girders, the beams. He lived it. Since its construction, millions of people had safely crossed it to go to work, to the houses of their friends and family, until the bridge’s refurbishment decades later. Cade had awoken many times during the process in the middle of the night worrying if he had secured that rivet, this bolt. Was the welding done correctly? Even since, he would still sometimes wake in the middle of the night in a panic. Should he call his old boss as he was sure, positive, he had not fitted the rivet correctly? It was an epic responsibility unlike any he had experienced before. Millions of lives crossing the same pavement hundreds of yards above the rushing water underneath with only his work and the engineering keeping them from plunging to their deaths. It was this same fear and panic he would have years later in the dark hours, but about his daughter. Was she safe? Who was she with? He didn’t’ understand how could a person create something they were so proud of and yet so terrified of at the same time.

Early the next morning, Cade heads to Houston, back to the I-10 all the way to New Orleans. The views shift more dramatically than any country Cade visited as a younger man, from harsh desert in Arizona to endless plains and rolling horse farms in Texas, to the bayous, swamps and dense forests of Louisiana. It’s peculiar how quickly the country contorts in front of one’s eyes. It feels more like a plane journey, where a person begins in one reality only to wake up hours later in another. He begins to feel the stirring memories of his childhood in Louisiana - hunting with the other boys, campouts where the night was filled with the deafening sound of thousands of crickets, and lightning bugs illuminating the muggy, choking air. The night at the apartment where he and his friends made frogs jump off the second floor balcony, a tortured memory from which he still feels guilt. The restaurants remind him of youth too. Small towns littered with barbecue joints on every corner and cheap seafood dives with names like Oh My Cod or Holy Mackerel displayed on rickety signs in strange fonts. He drives over seemingly endless bridges and into New Orleans proper. He finds another Ritz Carlton Hotel on Canal Street. This one standing tall in tasteful white and gray, lit up against the night beckoning travelers in with its air of comfort and privilege.

Music wafts into his room from the streets below. Cade follows the music to a dive bar selling crawfish and beer. He orders a plate with hushpuppies and cocktail sauce. The girl serving asks his name in a heavy Italian accent, and he talks with her for awhile about this and that. She buys Cade a drink under the condition that he doesn’t flirt with her. He agrees but after a pause says he can’t promise anything really. She smiles at him. She asks him if he is going to a museum. He tells her he remembers going to the Met as a child, and how unimpressed he was with the ancient artifacts collection at the time. Cade recounts that the guide, an older woman who disliked children, told them that the wooden spoon from thousands of years ago in Sumeria was the earliest example of a utensil in known history. Too much time passed to be enthusiastic about this find in Cade’s mind, too many magnificent inventions had come in between, making the spoon’s innovation seem inevitable and banal. Wouldn’t someone else eventually have invented the spoon, if it hadn’t been this old Sumerian? The waitress giggles, confessing that she had felt the same way as a child in Italy, when a tour guide had fawned over the intracacies of a clay doll from millennia ago. Don’t Get Me Wrong by The Pretenders plays over the PA in the restaurant as the two make eyes at one another. They linger on the patio with Spanish moss choking a massive live oak.

What do you like about New Orleans? Cade asks her.

I like that it’s haunted, she answers, grinning. I like that dead bodies are buried above ground. I like the voodoo. I like that everyone is high in one way or another here.

Cade nods his head. Yeah me too, he agrees.

Hours later, as her shift is ending, the woman, Rosalina, asks Cade to go have a drink somewhere quiet. He agrees in his buzzed, yeasty haze. She asks about his past, but Cade doesn’t want to discuss his family. Not tonight. Instead, he tells her a story from his early twenties. He and his friends would ‘steal’ golf carts on the Paramount film studio lot. They all worked at different production companies on the lot, and the carts were perks for the powerful Higher-Ups so that they wouldn’t have to break a sweat getting around the lot. As assistants or low-level executives, Cade and his buddies would often commandeer these vehicles to race in the middle of night, crashing them drunkenly into barriers set up so haphazardly throughout the backlots that it looked like a child had dreamed them up. The practice was frowned upon but nevertheless mostly chalked up to boys being boys.

Rosalina misunderstands the story, grinning dumbly as she calls him an outlaw, confusing childish pranks for grand theft auto. He chuckles sheepishly.

No no, he says. You’ve misunderstood. I’m no criminal…well maybe a little.

Her sly, sideways smile can’t disguise her attraction in the moment, and he kisses her in the bleached moonlight shining down into the patio of the little juke joint. She asks Cade what he does for a living, and after he admits to being a writer, she makes him laugh by asking if there has ever been a more annoyingly narcissistic profession. Probably not, he concedes. He asks about her life. All she’ll give up is to say that she has lived a loud life and a quiet one, and the quiet one is much better.

The pair end up in his room. She falls into the bed, collapsing into the thick, lush sheets with a satisfied sigh. As expected, they make love, but hurriedly, both wanting to get through it and just lie in each other’s arms. Cade tells her that he isn’t looking for a partner. He’s leaving. Rosalina laughs at the absurdity of the comment. I don’t care, she says languidly, taking a long draw from a vape. He tries to explain that he won’t be around, that it isn’t her, that he is heading to a place she won’t want to follow. She puts a finger to his lips to quiet him.

I said I don’t care, she says.

She plays the song Voices Carry by Aimee Mann on her phone. They lie next to each other on the bed, but they are heading in different directions. Keep it down now, voices carry.

The word Nakam sounds like someone clearing their throat of phlegm when spoken aloud. The word comes from the back of the esophagus like a feeling crawling out of one’s belly. It originates from the same place where the vengeance the group is synonymous with comes from - the gut. Nakam crawled through postwar Europe like ghosts who refuse death. The idea was simple. Six million for six million. The Germans owed the Jews a debt a six million corpses, and Nakam wanted to collect. Survivors with hollow eyes and numbers burned into their skin, they believed justice had failed them so thoroughly that only symmetry could answer it. While the world rebuilt and began to forget, Nakam planned in silence. Maps folded into coat pockets, names whispered, poisons measured with the calm of men who had already seen the death of humanity. Their dream was vast and horrific - to make Germans feel, if only for a moment, the scale of the Jewish nightmare. Even when that dream fractured under fear, betrayal and reality, the hunger for retribution never left those haunted men and women. Nakam was not a movement of hope, of our better angels. It was an aftershock of annihilation, the sound of history cracking after the howl of the holocaust.

I-10 turns into I-20, and David Bowie plays Cade into Atlanta and its heavy, oppressive heat. Smoke hangs over the buildings as he hunts for his hotel, the downtown gray Ritz Carlton in the heart of the city. Bowie’s androgynous wail makes the valet smile. Nice choice, he says as he collects Cade’s keys. He asks Cade if he knew Bowie had written Sinatra’s My Way.

No, says Cade. He wonders if this can possibly be true. He thinks maybe it could. Chocolates on the bed thank Cade for his continuing loyalty to the Ritz Carlton, carefully laid out to read We Appreciate You. Only You by Yazoo plays eerily on the hotel TV. There’s only one purpose to this visit to Atlanta. Cade wastes no time. He exits the hotel, following the obvious signs of social maladaptation toward Sweet Auburn Avenue. Homeless people in tattered rags struggle with their overloaded shopping carts, like zombies in a nightmare they can’t escape. When he reaches the market, a boy with a teardrop tattoo asks him what he wants.

Anything that will send me into oblivion, he says.

The boy winks and hands him a tiny package he pulls from underneath his tongue. Cade slips him a bill, and the boy, suddenly abrupt, tells him to get lost. Cade obeys, weaving through the skyscrapers and students from the university, and stops at a small restaurant in the market where he orders barbecue. Full from the brisket and collards, he strolls back to his hotel, stopping at the lone white oak tree amidst the concrete expanse. Haze rises from the asphalt as it releases the scorching heat from the day.

Cade unwraps the package and stares at the blue fentanyl pill inside. He can’t help but think of all the time he spent in pursuit of, imbibing, and recovering from this tiny little substance. He crushes the pill and snorts the powdery substance without hesitation. That calming, God’s-son-feeling that Lou Reed sang of washes over Cade like a familiar friend. He lies down and closes his eyes, expecting the lovely feeling of sedated euphoria to settle in, but he can’t shake the nagging thought of just how much of his life he wasted in and effort to achieve this state. His entire life, just about. Now, it feels hollow. Alcoholics say that once you’ve been through treatment you’ll never be able to enjoy the drunk again. Cade understands what they mean. That once-soothing feeling is instead accompanied by regret and emptiness. Guilt maybe. He doesn’t know. Why can’t anything just be anymore? He guesses maybe he can’t wait until South Carolina. Maybe that’s the nagging feeling he can’t shake. Soon enough, he tells himself. Soon enough.

The Cheka was not so much born as an institution but rose like a fever through Russia, rising out of revolution with the certainty that mercy was a counterrevolutionary crime during the early 20th Century. The group did not merely police the new Soviet state - it defined it. It drew its borders in blood between those who belonged to history and those who were to be erased by it. Its agents operated in the shadows and basements, armed less with evidence than with conviction. They believed that terror was not a regrettable tool but a necessary language, a way to speak directly to the future by silencing the present. Founded by Lenin, the purpose of the group was simple, protect the Bolsheviks at any cost after their bloody revolution. Arrests came under the cover of night, names dissolved into lists, and guilt assumed as a structural condition, embedded in class, ancestry, or doubt alone. The Cheka saw itself as the immune system of the revolution, purging infection wherever they found it. Of course, Cheka came to see contamination everywhere in Russian society. Fear became method and atmosphere, thick enough to breathe until their machinery of protection morphed into annihilation. They guarded their revolution so ferociously that it consumed the very society it claimed to protect. The Cheka never really relinquished the Soviet Union. It just rebranded as time passed.

I-20 gives way to 95 on the way to Charleston, South Carolina. Somewhere along the way, the pavement gets sandy from nearby beaches, the architecture changes to colonial-era plantation style homes. The barbecue changes as well, from the thick, molasses spiked sauces of Georgia to the tangy, thin, mustardy ones of the Carolinas. The air feels lighter with the salt breeze off the Atlantic, not the muggy, stagnant air of the bayous. The homes are light blue and white, with names rather than numbers to identify them, like Sea Grace and Pelican Point. The city feels old for America, but also alive. Pretty blond college girls wander the streets in groups under the shade of giant magnolia trees. Boys call out from Jeeps asking where they are headed, inviting them to keg parties. There’s hope here even as a hurricane blows in from the Caribbean. The lights will go out in Charleston tonight, but the party won’t end. They will drink beer from red cups until dawn, when they’ll disappear in pairs to bedrooms, or collapse on a couch in some stranger’s home. Gray smoke envelopes the city now. Its origins Cade cannot tell. It hangs over the city, foreboding, ominous.

Lieber Correctional Institution is located in Ridgeville, South Carolina. The facility is only thirty minutes from the charm of the beautiful brick homes of downtown Charleston, but the institution may as well be a million miles away with its bleak gray buildings and barbed wire fences. The campus sprawls across acres, seemingly designed to offer no hope or glimpse of a life outside its walls.

Cade drives past Lieber and stops at a gas station on the edge of town. He is calm, practiced. The McMillan TAC-50 sniper rifle is wrapped in two bath towels in the trunk of his Chevy. He thinks back to that day, how it turned his world upside down. He carefully cleans and inspects the weapon. He knows he only has one real chance. He assembles the stock and barrel, admiring the harsh beauty of the weapon. Da Vinci was a weapons maker. Not by choice exactly, but still he was. Its funny, he thinks, how the world inevitably pushes its best minds to kill one another - Oppenheimer, Edward Teller, even Archimedes. It seems like a waste of creativity, to use such men in this manner, when killing men is so easy. But the weapon is undeniably a brilliant feat of engineering, a work of art. There are so few parts, such simplicity, nothing wasted. Cade takes his time loading the clip. He removes a long hose from the trunk. The last item is a photo album. These items he transfers to his passenger seat. When he’s done, he buys a cup of coffee and a six pack from the gas station. He gets back into his car and drives the fifteen minutes back to the prison.

Cade sits motionless in his car. The parking lot is almost completely empty. The men who reside in this place have few visitors. He gulps down the beer and quickly empties the six pack. The sun is slowly beginning to set somewhere to the west, though he faces east. A few scattered employees exit the building, stress and exhaustion evident on their faces. Cade begins to wonder how long he will have to wait. He doesn’t want to lose his will, his edge. Hours creep by as he downs his coffee. Finally, a man accompanied by a uniformed guard exits the facility, a plastic belongings bag in his hand. Cade examines the man from where he sits. He is much older now. Prison hasn’t been easy for him. His hair, once unruly and jet black, has been cut short, thinned, and gray. He wears faded jeans and an old white t-shirt. He has a faint smile on his face. Freedom. The guard shakes the man’s hand, appears to give him a kind word of goodbye. Something about the interaction bothers Cade. Cade exits his vehicle. The man continues toward the parking lot, walking towards a car with a woman and two teenage boys. When she sees him, the woman jumps from the car and runs toward him, squealing and crying. She jumps up and wraps her legs around him. The teenage boys tentatively emerge from the car, greeting the man with awkward nods and handshakes. The man smiles broadly, kisses his wife, pulls his boys into a stiff embrace.

Cade knows there are only seconds remaining. He peers through the scope of the rifle, the crosshairs hover over the target as he walks towards the vehicle, his wife clutching his arm. Cade takes a breath, suspended in stillness. His finger squeezes the trigger. A single crack of gunfire pierces the air. Cade watches as the man crumples to the asphalt. Confused, the woman bends to help the man, not yet grasping what has happened. The boys seem to sense something is wrong. They run to their father, facedown now on the asphalt in a slowly expanding pool of red. The woman screams as the truth dawns on her. One of the boys looks up, eyes frantically scanning the area. His eyes fall on Cade in the distance.

Cade stares back at the boy for a long moment. The debt he just collected from the father, he knows he now owes to the boy. He nods slowly before turning away, calmly returning the weapon to the trunk of his vehicle. He slides into the driver’s seat, starts the engine, and drives away.

Cade reaches the forest area he had researched back in Tucson. It’s fifteen minutes from Lieber, more or less. He doesn’t waste time. He gets out of his vehicle. He attaches the hose to the tailpipe and feeds it into the car. He gets back in the car. He flips through the old family photo album. He lingers over a picture of his daughter when she was about twenty. The man in the photo next to her, smiling, with jet black hair. Cade slowly tears the photo in half, crumpling the man with black hair in his fist. He closes the photo album. He turns the car back on. The branches from the trees twist, choking the car and its occupant in a merciless embrace. Green foliage descends and encircles them until he can’t see out the windows. Dust swirls around him like a hurricane. The world turns and he accepts. As he falls into a deep slumber, he makes out flashing blue and red lights coming towards him in the distance through the trees.",1,1771387732.0,Darkshortstories,0,1.0,False
1r7svok,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1r7svok/long_rant_silent_treatment_for_a_month_after/,LONG RANT: Silent treatment for a month after first ever argument with father.. Was told that he wouldn't care if I died. I'm devastated.,"Hello, I have never posted on Reddit before, I just needed a place to speak because I'm beyond devastated and unsure what to really do. 

I (23f) recently got into an argument with my father (59m) almost a month ago. 

For some context, my father has never been the greatest guy. He's an egotistical, apathetic gambling addict that puts constantly neglects our family and has put my mother through hell for my entire life. Instead of treating my mother like a wife, he has done nothing but isolate her from friends and family, berate her, and treat her like his personal servant. He doesn't even get up on his own to grab stuff; he screams our names from across the house and expects to be served immediately, and if its not done exactly how he likes it or you're not fast enough he will insult you. My whole life it felt like I was walking eggshells around my father, he's an incredibly explosive person and to be entirely honest I'm afraid of him. However, as much as he upset me personally, I have never had a real argument with him.. until a month ago. 

For the first time in my life I fought with him. Never have I yelled at him, but I couldn't take it anymore. 

For some context, I was about to start a very physical new job in 2 days but I was experiencing back pain. I'm a chronically ill person that gets flare ups from any stress and strain on my body. It was snowing heavily here, and we have a very large driveway, so unfortunately that had to be shoveled. 

My mother asked my father to shovel the snow, and in response he scoffed and said **""why should I shovel? I have kids""**! So he immediately got on my brother and I's asses to do the chore for him. All I mentioned was that I have back pain and I'm unsure if I can handle it, and he immediately exploded. 

He started ranting about how useless I was, that he doesn't care that I'm ill. He then went on and on to my mother about how much he wants to kick me out and called me lazy, accused me of having an excuse just not to shovel. I simply just didn't want to injure myself more before I started working my new job. 

When I finally got dressed to shovel anyway, he pulled me into the kitchen just to continue to verbally degrade me. This was normal, I was able to handle it.. until he started dragging my mother into it as well. 

He began to talk about how much he suddenly **""feels sorry""** for my mother, because she wakes up at 5 am to make him breakfast and coffee, shower, get ready for work, work overtime, come home at 5 pm, cook dinner for him, clean the house, and how she's so exhausted she crashes in the living room at 10 pm. He tried to blame that all on my brother and I, I just couldn't take it anymore. She does all of this for HIM, HE'S the reason why she's always on her feet. Whenever she finally has the time to sit down, he finds a reason to ""keep her busy"". After her long shifts, he requests dinners that are labor intensive and take a while to cook. She serves him constantly, and my brother and I try our best to support her so it's not as rough for her. She's constantly stressed out over the tens of thousands of dollars he gambles at the casino yearly, we're always months behind on bills because of his negligence. She works overtime to compensate for that. Almost every single day I have to witness my mother sob over the stress my father puts her through.  

I finally shouted at my father and told him straight up that HE'S the reason why she's miserable. HE'S the reason why she's always so stressed and unable to relax, HE'S the reason why she cries every single day. I told him exactly why too, and he did not like it. 

My mother kept standing between us as we fought just to make sure my father wouldn't potentially hit me. 

He then immediately avoided the topic and went on to call me stupid and lazy over and over again. He then started to threaten to kick me out, said that I only have 3-4 months left in this house. Told me **to go prostitute myself**, he doesn't care that I got a new good job. 

He then tried to guilt trip me by telling me that he would die and do anything for me before, but not anymore. That I ""**lost something today""** and that he **""no longer loves me""**. He then started to brag about how unlike other people in the family, he doesn't hit his children (That literally should be the bare minimum), and that I should at least be grateful that he doesn't beat me. 

Somehow the argument spiraled into a conversation about how he never even attempted to get to know me, and that if anyone were to ask him about me he would not have a single thing to say about me. He then started blaming it on my brother and I's phones, claiming that he attempted to hangout with us before, but personally I call it bullshit. Growing up every single time I have attempted to talk to him, he shooed me away because I was disturbing his TV time. The few times he did hang out with us, it always ended in him verbally degrading us. 

**I told him that everyone is scared of him.** 

I am someone that naturally speaks with their hands, so I guess I was waving my hands in a way I didn't realize? Because **he began to** **accuse me of wanting to hit him.** Not once did the thought of hitting anyone cross my mind, I am not a violent person. I have always been meek and shy, too gentle for my own good. I felt incredibly sick and even offended by this accusation, once again this proved my point that he doesn't know me at all. 

But afterwards he went on and on accusing me of ""wanting to hit him"" and how if I stepped a little closer, he would've knocked me dead right there. He then began telling me in detail how the other day, while I was washing the dishes, he thought about slamming my head into the sink. 

It makes me sick that he accused me of being the violent one when he was the one who told me straight up that he wanted to knock me out. 

He then told me that **he wouldn't care if I died**. I'm dead to him. 

Later that day I approached him, and told him that he can believe whatever he wants, but I'm deeply offended that he would even think that I wanted to hit him, I am simply someone that just speaks with their hands. He then continued to degrade me and told me how much he doesn't care. 

I couldn't take it anymore and began to weep, and told him that I just wanted the family to be happy and that I didn't like how he treated my mother, and he told me that ""he was happy until today"". 

I told him that ""everyone is suffering"" and he screamed ""shut up"" to me before he slammed the door in my face, and left to go gambling. 

**""Shut up""** was the last thing he told me for the next month. Ever since that it has been nothing but silence. Every attempt to speak with him afterwards, no matter how small, has been met with him ignoring me. 

All I did was defend my mother and family, we're all very tired..

I don't know what to do. I know ideally its best to continue to live my life like normal after something like that, do not apologize to a narcissist, but god damn it still hurts so much. ",1,1771387688.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

1r7ssu5,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_DrPepperSign/comments/1r7ssu5/noticing_an_awesome_shift_in_the_valley_local/,"Noticing an awesome shift in the valley: Local businesses are stepping up and quietly declaring themselves ""Warrant Only"" zones","I was walking around Downtown and Wasena recently, trying to figure out what was going on this weekend, when I noticed a really encouraging shift in the air. We are used to the literal ice making things slick around here, but the local pushback regarding the *other* ICE and federal immigration enforcement has hit a totally new and incredibly positive level.

If you have been paying attention to local news or walking past our independent shops, you might have seen the ""All Neighbors Welcome"" signs popping up. It is way more than just a polite slogan right now. Following the massive protests across Virginia last month (covered by WSLS 10 and WVTF in January 2026), segments of the Roanoke business community are taking a brave stand and drawing some hard lines about federal access to their properties to protect our neighbors.

### The ""Warrant Only"" Movement

A lot of independent coffee shops, restaurants, and venues are doing the right thing by adopting a strict ""No Trespass"" stance for federal agents who show up without a judge's signature. I am seeing this protective vibe strongly at community hubs like **Little Green Hive** and **Ursula's Cafe**, where they have historically pushed a beautiful message of inclusivity. The prevailing rule among these business owners is exactly what it should be: if a judge did not sign it, federal agents do not get past the counter.

Staff at several spots are reportedly being trained to understand this exact legal difference so they can actively keep their spaces safe. And it is not just the coffee shops. Immigrant owned staples like **Cuban Island Restaurant** and **A1 Afghan Restaurant and Grocery** are being heavily supported by locals who want to fiercely protect the international footprint that makes the valley so great. Organizations like **Casa Latina** and the **Roanoke Diversity Center** are stepping up in a huge way by helping distribute ""Know Your Rights"" information to these local storefronts.

### State Cover and Local Representation

This local push is getting a well deserved boost from Richmond. On February 4, 2026, Governor Abigail Spanberger signed an executive directive to end the state's 287(g) agreements. This effectively removes the mandate for state law enforcement like the Virginia State Police to act as federal immigration deputies (reported by Cardinal News).

Our own Delegate Sam Rasoul has been incredibly vocal on this front too. He publicly called for the abolition of ICE, framing it as a necessary step to rebuild trust between law enforcement and diverse communities (according to WVTF on January 15, 2026). It is refreshing to see local leaders actually backing up the community.

### A Welcoming City

Roanoke is a bridge city. We actually received a ""Certified Welcoming"" designation from Welcoming America back in April 2024 for our commitment to immigrant inclusion (Cardinal News). Some local business owners correctly argue that when unfamiliar federal vehicles are spotted in residential neighborhoods, it rattles the whole community and destroys the sense of safety we have built.

These local spots are saying they want to prioritize their regulars and their neighborhood vibe over facilitating federal overreach. They are choosing to operate as true safe spaces first and marketplaces second, which is exactly the kind of local economy we should be supporting.

Have you noticed any other specific shops in your neighborhood stepping up and adopting these ""Warrant Only"" policies? What are your favorite spots that are doing the right thing right now?

1r7ssmk,https://www.reddit.com/r/vulvodynia/comments/1r7ssmk/my_journey_so_far_23f/,My journey so far (23f),"I am getting to the point where I need to find something positive in the seemingly impossible battle I've had over the last few years, so I figured finding community would be a good starting place. Here's my story — it's long, but I just need to write it all down.

At around 7 years old I started getting UTIs pretty frequently, and as I got older and went through puberty I would develop yeast infections probably 2–3 times a year. Hygiene was never an issue, they just happened. So my entire life I've been pretty prone to infections down there, but in August 2021 I got a yeast infection and it would not go away.

At first I didn’t think anything of it. I went to my OB, got a culture done, and she prescribed 2 doses of oral fluconazole. She told me to wait two weeks before having sex, and that’s exactly what I did. I’ve been with the same partner since 2018 — still going strong. But from August 2021 to April 2023, I probably went to my OB 30 times for infection-related issues. I’d get a yeast infection, take whatever they prescribed (oral fluconazole, creams, miconazole, terconazole), wait about a month before doing anything, and then boom — it was back. Sex, my period, swimming, new body wash — the tiniest thing would throw me off.

Eventually my OB gave me a list of things I could be doing wrong: sugar intake, dehydration, synthetic fabrics, coffee, pads, lubricant, laundry detergent, and more. I felt so hopeless, like this was somehow my fault. At the end of 2022, after being told she couldn’t do anything else for me, I left that practice.

In March 2023 I saw a new OBGYN. She recommended removing my IUD, starting the pill (Larin-fe), and trying Brexafemme. I took two 500mg doses of Brexafemme and felt SO sick — but my infections stopped coming back. I went 4 months without one, the longest since August 2021. But even without infections, sex still felt exactly like it did when I had one. Every culture came back normal. I was SO confused.

From March 2023 to July 2024 it was constant back-and-forth: thinking I had an infection, getting a culture, negative results, no relief. I tried low-dose fluconazole cream twice weekly for months — no change. Then estradiol cream twice weekly indefinitely — no change.

In July 2024 I saw a vulvar specialist. He did the q-tip test and diagnosed me with provoked vulvodynia. I was so angry that all it took was a simple poke to figure it out. He started me on Nortriptyline 25mg, increasing every two weeks. After two weeks I had PIV intercourse and it was the least painful it had been in years. Then I got a raging yeast infection afterwards.

At this point I was seeing both my OB and the specialist. I needed treatment before the weekend and went to see another provider at my regular OB’s practice. I waited two hours. I’m a music teacher and had a concert that day — I was in agony and hysterical. When the doctor came in, he bluntly said, “So what’s this vulvodynia thing?” I explained briefly. He asked, “Have you ever been r\*ped? You can only have that if you’ve been r\*ped.” I didn’t even know how to respond.

He said ""I'm gonna try something"" and then without warning pressed his fingers downward into my vagina. I screamed. He said I was “SO tense,” that I didn’t have vulvodynia, and that I needed pelvic floor therapy. This was while I had both vulvodynia and a yeast infection. The exam was excruciating. I’ve never felt so violated and disregarded in my life. Nothing ever came of my complaints. After that incident, my pain came back full force, and even at 75mg Nortriptyline it never really improved.

From July 2024 to May 2025 I was on the pill, 75mg Nortriptyline, and estradiol cream — no improvement. In May 2025 I stopped the pill and estradiol, got a Mirena IUD again, still no change. We discussed tapering Nortriptyline but waited for my body to adjust.

In February 2026 my pharmacy couldn’t refill my prescription for 6 days and I went cold turkey. By the time I got it, I was in full withdrawals. The nurse advised restarting at 25mg since I planned to taper anyway, so that’s what I’ve been doing.

At my appointment last week, the specialist repeated the q-tip test and the pain is worse than before. We discussed tapering off Nortriptyline and other options: Naltrexone, Gabapentin, nerve blocks, and surgery. At first I said I’d think about it, but after sitting with it, I’m leaning toward surgery.

I don’t want to spend years trying medications that might not work. At the same time, I’m terrified of surgery. I messaged the specialist about surgery and I’m anxiously waiting for a response. In the meantime I’ve been reading this subreddit — scaring myself half to death, but also feeling a little less alone.

I haven’t had sex since July 2024 out of fear. I know the fear is a whole other battle. I’m in therapy and looking into support groups. I’m so scared, frustrated, tired, and sad. Sometimes I feel hopeless, like I’m broken and did something to deserve this. I want to have sex with my partner again, but I can’t let myself go enough to let him even touch me.

So yeah, that’s my story. If you read this far, I appreciate you a lot. Hopefully things start looking up soon.",3,1771387448.0,vulvodynia,0,1.0,False

During the pre infusion process (first 11 seconds), the machine doesn't make its usual noise or pre-infusion drip.

The same issue occurs when there is ground coffee in the portafilter. After the pre infusion (12 seconds) the machine appears to work like normal (here water comes out, and with portafilter espresso, pressure gauge rises).  The hot water also doesn't seem to come out, or when it does it only drips.

We do regular cleanings, descaling's, filter changes, etc. I tried to trouble shoot this a little bit and I thought maybe the water pump is having an issue (although I've only had this a little over 2 years and seems unlikely ).

Tips?,"I (24F) am on my third day of running in the morning. My goal is general fitness, aiming for an 8 minute mile eventually so I’ve been just trying to run a mile and see my time. My problem is that after each one I’ve felt super nauseated. I take maybe 5-10 minutes on the toilet (generally comparable to coffee on an empty stomach aches and the consequential poo), then 20 laying down in recovery position for my stomach to settle. 

The first time was the worst because I also got very lightheaded. That’s what first made lying down part of my recovery because I read it helped blood flow back to my head. 

What I’m working on in hopes it helps is hydration. My usual is maybe around 60oz straight water which isn’t the best. Since the nausea began I’ve been aiming for 100oz. I prefer morning runs so I know dehydration might be a big factor. The other big one is sleep, which I know I’m lacking. I love waking up early but I use the nighttime to enjoy solitude and end up only sleeping 6hr on average.

More health background is that I’m working on body recomp and continuing weight loss with an attempted 300 below TDEE though I’ve been hungrier after runs and ate around maintenance since I’ve started running.

Has anyone also felt like this when starting? What did you do to help with nausea? Do you have any other tips to make runs and recovery easier?

Section 2.

The Stowaway

***(Twelve days ago.***

***Twelve?***

***Damn it, it’s supposed to be eleven.***

***Oh well… we’ll just have to catch up.)***

\~\~\~

Dellia, the great ring, should’ve hung in feathered clumps through Wade’s southern sky on a “fine” morning like this. Instead, the whole thing was smothered in blustery gray muck blowing sideways you could barely see through, maybe the last proper squall before Dellia’s shadow crept across the island kingdom.

Wade’s marina emptied out for the day, with everyone taking the storms as a personal, early invitation to the pubs for the Storms’ Passing festival.

Thing is, the festival was still two days away.

There were, of course, stubborn merchants pretending the market wouldn’t be affected. One bell in, though, and most of them headed in for shelter, warm cups, and local rumor tossing. At the far end of the wharf, where Tavern Street bent west toward the greater square, one refused to give in.

Esmeralda Rosalinda McGert.

She never missed a day.

The thought had crossed her mind to stay in. *Why risk being on the boat in this weather?* But she went out anyway.

And the catch was small.

The crowds? Nonexistent.

It was a bloody *rotten* day.

Neeson from the clothing stall across the way had been the only other one foolish enough to stay open for another bell, but the rain changed his mind too.

“Don’t forget this!” Esmeralda waved a wrapped redfish at him. “Someone ought to enjoy it. It’ll ruin overnight, and I’ve got more than enough.”

“Speakin’ of things sourin’...” Neeson skipped over the merging puddles and plopped three tins of paint down. “These’re goin’ bad. Grandson forgot ‘em on the upper shelf. They’re for the rubbish if you don’t want ‘em.”

Esme stole a glance at her stand. The whole thing was as tired as her captain’s coat. With a gleam in her eye, she reached over the counter and snatched Neeson by the shoulders, hauling him in for a quick kiss on the cheek. “I know *exactly* what to do!”

As Neeson, flushed, stumbled home, Esme flipped her sign to CLOSED and dumped her counter goods into an oversized basket. “You’ll be a fine feast!” she muttered, making her way to Beggar’s Corner. She found a father she’d seen there all week and pressed it into his hands. “Just make sure you lot finish these by tonight or they’ll spoil. Invite some of the others from the Corner over. There’s plenty to go round, and those blokes might be helpful in other ways. Just tell ’em this is from McGert and they’ll see to it you’re cared for.” She noticed how thin he and his wife were. The kids hovered back a few steps, watching.

“Say, why don’t *you* and yours come by my place anytime tomorrow, alright? I’ll have more.”

The father was having trouble keeping his emotions in check, but managed a nod.

“Aw now, donna’ ya worry. Things will pick up for ya. I know it.” She gave a wink, and pushed him back towards his family. “Just remember to come by. Now go on and have a nice night.” She spun on her heel, yelling over her shoulder as she sprinted away, “Stay warm, ya hear!”

Back at the booth, the rain finally broke as she whipped up some fish balls for trade. After a small snack for herself, she made her way to see Ole Tom, who had a proper goods shop on the other side of the market. After negotiations for the fish balls (*and an added kiss on the cheek for Tom*), she had what she needed- brushes! Esme raced to the booth, and immediately set upon painting the inside with the tin of egg blue. Once the storm had passed completely, she tied a brush to a stick for the exterior, splattering globs of red and white paint on the ground which, like the mud, still hadn’t fully dried.

It had an… eye-catching effect, with every other shingle a different color. Some would say it wasn’t even close to a good piece of art, but for Esmeralda it was a masterpiece.

Despite the storm, the rest of the day left her with a grin she couldn’t shake. It was there from ear-to-ear as she dropped crab pots and shrimp traps before dinner. It was there when she contemplated going out, but decided bed was the smart choice. It was still plastered on her face when she woke like clockwork and whipped up a proper breakfast: buttered biscuit, spiced eggs, salt pork, and a damn fine coffee that could raise the dead. She gave a generous pour of cream in a mug the size of her head and pinched sea salt into the grounds to cut the bitterness.

Her father’s trick.

She was in such a damn fine mood, she crowned her biscuit with a spoonful of Mople berry preserve.

Rare as mercy.

Not because you couldn’t get the fruit in Wade. You could find anything here if you knew who to ask and what to pay. Mople just wasn’t something you got anymore. Not in Wade. Not anywhere. These days you only heard about it in rumors, or in the few stubborn jars that had survived longer than they had any right to.

And those, were guarded like sin.

She savored the last bit of breakfast when a chime went off in her moss-green canvas jacket. Her hand dove into a pocket, past a gutting knife and some twine until it landed on the pomander pocket-clock. She pulled it out and flipped open the case. The inside face was marked in thirteen neat divisions, each one notched with a tiny bell, with the hand now pulling deep past the second bell.

Esme clicked her tongue and snapped the device shut. “Late. Damn.”

She dropped the pomander back in the pocket. Her father had traded favors, pride, and a handful of rings he didn’t have to spare to get it made by a Kaiin tinker before he died- he hated being late.

And now she was late.

Late by her standards. Still ahead of most of Wade.

In a burst of energy, she donned her formal gear: a lanolin black and yellow gansey, with matching sou’wester, woolen stockings, overalls, belt, and fresh dubbin boots. She didn’t bother to tidy before heading out, pulling on the proper waxed, highly patched, and fish-blood bullied slicker with a flourish. A quick pat confirmed all was where it was supposed to be. Ditty Bag, Fid, sheepsfoot rig knife, marlspike, whet stone. She pulled nippers from an inner pocket of the jacket and slid them over her hands. Locking the door behind her, she strode out into the morning-night where the docks were loud with slap of wet planks, rope creak, and a gull that hadn’t fallen asleep, yelling at nothing.

Jimmy the drunk wasn’t whistling his way home.

Ty and Ren, the morning guards, walked by already on shift.

“Runnin’ behind, Esme?” quipped Ty.

“Aye, but breakfast was worth it!”

“Had to be to keep you this long,” mused Ren.

They shared a passing laugh. She spun on one heel. “Oh! Swing by mah booth and have a gander! Let me know what you think later!” Then hustled on.

Damn, she *was* late. But, today was going to be a *damn* fine day. *Twas in da bones*.

Esme’s boat sat low in the water with lines led true to the bollards. Forty-three feet of carvel-built coast-crawler, gaff-rigged with a single mast her father had stepped himself.

She felt the moorline give an impatient tug against the wooden pillars as the flood began to push into the marina. Most wouldn’t notice the change. “Double damns. Slack’s already broke. Gotta be quick about this.” The captain heaved herself up the snubbed line and over a timber-head, boots slamming the boards past the nets stacked tidy to port.

She felt twelve again even thinking she heard her father*.*

*“A damns pirate would be proud.”*

Then, straight to the tiller.

Her father had replaced it twice, and the second time he’d used Tíbar ironwood that cost him a month’s wages.

“*Worth every damn coin*.”

From here, thanks to her father, she could run the whole operation herself.

*“Let no lubber take from ye wast ye can do yashelf.”*

The man’s handiwork was everywhere. A rigged tie-off and a double-pulley on the main halyard so she could raise sail without leaving the helm. A modified centerboard that came up and down on a lever. Narrow storage bins built into the gunwales to keep her gear dry. Even the keel, reshaped and sheathed in copper to cut drag, and that big leaf-shaped rudder he’d hung on the stern for tighter turns when the harbor got crowded.

The best trick lived right in the deck. A plain iron handle by the tiller.

Esme hooked her fingers under it and yanked, triggering mooring slip-lines.

Chain snapped taut through its guides

The free ends slipped out of the bitts.

The bights dropped clean off the bollards.

The lines came hissing back through angled fairleads, stacking in wet coils on deck.

Up forward, the anchor clapped hard into its chocks.

Esme gave a nearby handle a quick wrist-flick and along the gunwale, the pot-runner woke up. Crab pots and shrimp traps skated aft on little rollers, bumping one by one into a stop-rail right beside the helm. All close enough she could work them with one hand while the other stayed married to the boat.

Those were just *some* of the tricks he built into this tugger.

Sunk every dime into it. Even then, doing it all himself, her father died owing half the island. But, he’d left her “…*ah boot any shooul on Wade wo’ld envah*.”

Esme was still grinning as she leaned a hip into the till and hauled the halyard as the bow swung free, despite the flood.

It was, by all accounts, a good Wade-morning for fishing. Just enough breeze to let her hide in the ripples. Moonless, Iria setting early. Mild overcast to cut what was left in the sky.

Halfway into her daily rotation, she had more load than she really needed.

Tomorrow’s odds and ends were mostly done, already waiting in neat coils and quiet knots. The barnacled crab pots were reset with fresh twine. The longlines were already stowed. Fire-fishing was done; the lantern let low to a dim glow that she wasn’t going to bother to hood. She’d made her deepwater dive at Bilber Hallow first thing after the pots and, invigorating as it was, she wished she’d skipped it. The chill sticks with you.

The main catch already had been sorted, which meant only the drift nets were earnin’ a living at the moment. Anything else was tempting the sea to get clever, and she was fine being greedy with the quiet.

Esme enjoyed the boredom and thinning clouds as they drifted by, washing the moment down with a sip of Dead Horse Reserve. She heard her father’s voice as she traced the sky.

*“Now, wat do ya sees? Back east.”*

“Broken Crown chasin’ the silver road of Iria.”

*“West?”*

“Dellia.”

*“Nerth?”*

“The island.”

*“An’ in wintah?”*

“Perhaps light from Ten Towns on a very good night.”

*“Ye’ll be needin’ dis someday. C’mon now.”*

“Sundtí’s Velvet.”

*“O’erhead?”*

“Fisher’s Knot.”

*“South?”*

“The Drifters’ Union.”

*“Summah?”*

“Ghost Sun, with the frayed edge of the Great White Arch.”

*Here’s to you, Dad.*

Esme went to salute and noticed something off with the sky. An extra shimmer… moving. Coming in quick from the north. She fished a scope from her pocket and tried to catch it as it changed direction, now heading due east back towards Wade.

The ironwood tiller picked up a vibration which built to a painful buzz. She loosened her hand and let it hunt in the swell, trusting the boat for a breath while she glued her eye to the glass.

Bits of the familiar sky blinked out. Then returned. More blinks.

It was almost on top of her when she heard the familiar whisper of twin engines. Had it not been so still, she would have missed it.

“Well, hot damn. Ship 23. Looks like it’ll be a good time in the ol’ town tonight.”

The anomaly passed over, and the air dragged a sudden swirl across the water. Seconds later came a confused chop. Esme threw her weight back against the Tíbar ironwood to keep the bow from broaching.

“To hell with this!”

She snapped the scope shut and popped the pins on the drift-net winch. As soon as she could, she made way for port- partly hoping to catch a glimpse of Ship’s engineer, assuming Ship 23 landed in one piece. One never knows with that heap.

Esme was off-boat before the sky bothered with colors. Good she was back early, because offloading should’ve been easy. It wasn’t. Not because anything was broken.

Esme was... *distracted*.

She stretched time scraping the salt trays. Dragged the smoker into the lane instead of keeping it tucked out back. Sorted the fish. Twice. Anything she could do to have an excuse to stop every few minutes, make a little square with her fingers, and squint at her booth’s new paint job as if it might applaud her back.

Finally, she rolled out the surprise barrel from the day’s haul, a few sulking lobsters who’d been cheated out of a proper fight. She quickly plucked a rust-pike from the snapping mess. “Oh, you! *You* can get bent!” She marched it to the edge, and flung it back into the sea. “Go be crab food.”

On the way back she snatched up four large buckets of deepwater and brought them around front. “Oi, Neeson! What ya think of the new look!?!”

A voice from the empty-looking stall across the way answered back, “I knew if anyone could do something with that old paint, you could, darlin’!”

Esme chuckled. She’d hoped coming back early would mean he wasn’t there. Nothing malicious- she was his friend and all, but somehow the mangy coot beat her here every morning and she hadn’t the faintest clue how.

“I’m gonna beat you one of these days!”

“I hope you do!”

It would have been better if he had said something a bit more competitive. This just meant, or so Esme thought, he didn’t think she ever would.

Her mind drifted. She kept half a thought on beating Neeson, half on the white ventveil fronds from the buckets. She lightly squeezed the brine water from the plants, fingers white with cold that didn’t seem to bother her. Plant only worked if you handled it proper. Get ‘em smoothed out, let ‘em warm slightly and it would sweat a jelly that stayed cold on its own. Had to keep them a touch damp, because if they turned blue, they were done.

An academic regular once told her it was called “*Laminaria Profundis Ventivela*.” Sounded fancy, but most people she knew just called them deepwater cloth. Ventveil, deepwater cloth, ghost wave... Whatever folks wanted to call it- it did the trick, staying cool through the afternoon if you kept the sun off.

Ice cost a fortune in Wade, but deepwater cloths? Free for the taking if you didn’t mind the cold and knew where to dive without extra equipment.

*And to think, I nearly skipped grabbing these.*

Bilber Hallow was a perfect spot for divable deepwater, and one you kept to yourself. Good for a quick morning dip, but it went too thin near four bells. Miss it early and you were stuck running clear past Widow’s Reach for a **deeper drop**. It was just a choice of when you wanted to be cold, how deep you wanted to go, and how soon you wanted to be back.

*Hells. I’d just be pullin’ in from Widow’s Reach.*

Then it all *clicked*.

“Oh! Oh, that’s clever!” she said with a laugh.

“Who is?” Neeson was never there when you looked.

“I am, of course!”

“Course you are, dear!”

*That’s how I’ll beat him! Bilber Hallow. It’s not a bad idea really, if you could catch it before it was full shallow*.

She smoothed the cloths into a base bed for the booth then put up her ‘money-fish’. She staged the three best in a centerpiece: A good-sized Penny-fish Mutton and Grey-Bait-Stealer each flanking a Lead-Belly Landlord. She propped one up with a rolled strip of cloth, just enough tilt to make the scales throw back the morning that was just waking up.

*You could haul anchor early after the holiday tomorrow* *if you have another catch like today.*

To one side she coiled ribbonfish like silver belts, teeth smiling. Squid in a shallow wet-pan up front, smear of ink on the buyer’s side. Salt can and fish balls opposite.

*It could work.*

Everyday fish made up the rest. Sea-Darts on the left. Silver Plates near the front. Knucklers in a bruised pile. Glass-Rain in a shallow tray, Lantern-Fuel beside it, and Scribbles- still twitchy- laid out on the right. She kept a couple of Borrowshark center-back.

*Cut through the hallow on the return, right at Don’t-Get-Greedy Knife before the water turned too thin to float a cork.*

Crabs went into a lidded basket with a stone on top, because crabs had ideas when you let them. The bait shrimp stayed tucked under cloth in the shade, still twitching.

*Double quick back. Fifteen minutes to dock.*

Fish balls at the front. Salt in a tin with a scoop. Smoked redfish strips hanging like flags. Dead center front was some strange creature she accidentally hauled in that looked like melting butter. An eye-catcher for any passerby.

*That’ll shave me*\- she counted on her fingers, “Ten minutes!”

“What’s that?”

“Oh nothing, Neeson! Just chattin’ up these here fish.”

She smiled even larger now, grabbing another handful of the deepwater cloth. She was sure it was a good plan, especially since no fool had been out that way for weeks… not since those damn Qalupalik had shown up. Those merfolk were an absolute nuisance. Clip one and a whole damn swarm would be upon you faster than you can sneeze. Then what? Yer spendin’ the next few days cocooned up somewhere, living out your worst humiliations on a loop.

“Some for you,” she muttered, stuffing a few small strips around random tails. “And some for my poor ole feet.” She dropped a few strips into her water bucket. “And hopefully some for that family.” She took the final few strips and wrapped some of the blue muttons and kingfish she had set aside.

She tidied a few last bits, and stepped back into the lane, almost to Neeson’s booth, and took it all in.

The egg blue interior and the red-and-white checkerboard exterior made it look like an oversized children’s toy. It was stuffed with every fish you’d want in a day.

That grin crept back across her face.

She’d done that.

And it was perfect.

She stomped back over and flipped a hand-scrawled sign that read: **OPEN**.

“Alright, Neeson!” Esmeralda slapped both palms on her counter. “I know you’ve been lurkin’ over there pretendin’ you’re not starin’. Come on over and see the catch of the day! Fresher than a sea breeze at dawn. Got new sea salt ready too, just scraped it off the trays. And look here, Lamp-oil catch! Just like you love.” Esmeralda moved her upturned hands over the crown jewels of her booth. “Redfish smoked to perfection!”

Across the lane, a head rose slow over a stack of folded linen like a suspicious turtle. He moved around front, laying out a choice of exotic fabrics and expertly woven clothes.

“You could sell sand to a beach, Esmeralda.”

“And you could sell shame to a saint, but we don’t bring that up in public. Now really. Tell me what you think of the paint job and the way this is all laid out. Look at that presentation. This here is craft. That’s discipline. That’s...”

“…That’s a crime,” Neeson pointed towards the Butter-blob in the front.

“Oh, don’t you start with me,” Esme laughed. “That’s an eye-catcher. People see that and go, ‘What in Dellia’s tears is that?’ and then they’re already halfway to handin’ me coin.”

Neeson finally pushed off his stall and shuffled over, coat flapping, boots complaining. He leaned in, sniffed it once squinting hard.

“Well, what in the hells is it?”

“No clue. Just caught in the nets.”

“I’ve lived by the sea my entire life and I’m still surprised by what you fisher folk could conjure up. Alright then, let’s get a sample of smoked.”

“Sample?!? HA! If I didn’t love you, you old coot, I’d smack your knuckles with the marlspike for even thinkin’ that word.”

“Love’s a strong claim,” Neeson said, reaching anyway.

Esme swatted his hand, “You want a sample, you buy a strip. This ain’t charity lane.”

“That’s rich,” he muttered, glancing toward Beggar’s Corner. “Heard tale that the whole alley ate fine last night.”

Esme’s grin returned. “Well. It was just a Storms’ Passing gift. A little charity never hurts, ya know.”

“I reckon not. You got plans for feast tomorrow?”

“Dead Horse Inn!”

Neeson made a sound like he’d tasted something sour. “I don’ know why anybody ever goes there. Terrible. Specially on a holiday.”

“Well, I get one full day off a year and I plan to enjoy it. And speaking of time off, we both gotta get ready. So, what’s your- I can’t believe I’m saying this, *sample* gonna be?”

“I knew you were a class act, Esme.”

“I got ribbonfish, squid that’ll still argue with you, knucklers, scribbles, these twitchy little bastards here, an’ a Borrowshark I swear tried to bite me through the net. I’m tellin’ you, Neeson… I got a feelin’. Today’s got bones.”

“I hope so. I need to get some cloth and I can’t afford to go back to Armendale yet. So?”

“Whatever you like Neeson. Just don’ get greedy.”

Neeson looked over the catch as Esme’s eyes landed a glimpse of the uncloaked Ship 23 moored in air dock.

It was a marvelous wreck of a machine that should have been retired seven generations of McGerts ago. Patched and repaired more than her old coat, with twin balloons on adjustable rigging. A throwback to the Fleet’s original days when they were still figuring out which way was up.

Legends enough of the damn thing dropping parts, or people, from more than twenty roofs high. You might get lucky and it wouldn’t smack your boat or gear, but be damned if something like that wouldn’t ruin a few hours of work by spookin’ the fish. One of her too-many-greats-grandmothers called It *a “floatin’ coffin with delusions”* in the family log books, and that was one of the more kind descriptions.

Despite looking as bad up close as it did from a distance, in today’s dawn light the rust and imperfections melted, presenting the ship in all of its majestic glory. Perhaps this clouded reality came from a nostalgic childhood fancies for flying one of those beasties.

Or, perhaps, it was because she had a good view of Durin Boltbreaker.

Her engineer…

He was in deep discussion with Captain Marcus Wrekclaw over the cargo going on board, bending over a barrel to mark it with a black “X”.

*Ten years younger, and I’d have that Boltbreaker over this barrel instead of these damned lobsters!*

She bit her lower lip and sighed. Without turning back to Neeson, she asked, “Where were we?”

Neeson followed her gaze and made that sour sound again. “That heap’s bringin’ trouble again. Heard they’re gonna try to do somethin’ about the Qalupalik. But we’ll see. Bet they’ll just get drunk and burn down another bar.”

“That wasn’t their fault.”

“Says you.”

“And Excuse me? Heap? That’s Fleet. That’s history. That’s...”

“That’s a floating argument,” Neeson cut in. “An’ you’re starin’.”

She snapped around. “I am not!”

“Yes’n ya were.”

“I’m… checkin’... the weather.”

“Mmmm hmmm.” Neeson’s eyes flicked up to the sky. “Weather’s right there. Yer flushed as a rose,” then he tapped the butter-blobfish with one knuckle. “An’ this thing’s judgin’ me. I’ll sample some of the Lampers and since I’m so generous, I’ll buy a smoked.”

Esme laughed and hooked her thumb toward the smoked redfish strips. “Alright then, you miserable fabric goblin. This one here gave me a hell of a fight. I was thinkin’ I’d keep it for myself.”

Neeson leaned in, suddenly serious. “That’s not keepin’,” he said. “That’s braggin’!”",1,1771387390.0,FictionWriting,0,1.0,False

We are used to the literal ice making things slick around here, but the local pushback regarding the *other* ICE and federal immigration enforcement has hit a totally new and incredibly positive level.

If you have been paying attention to local news or walking past our independent shops, you might have seen the ""All Neighbors Welcome"" signs popping up. It is way more than just a polite slogan right now. Following the massive protests across Virginia last month (covered by WSLS 10 and WVTF in January 2026), segments of the Roanoke business community are taking a brave stand and drawing some hard lines about federal access to their properties to protect our neighbors.

### The ""Warrant Only"" Movement

A lot of independent coffee shops, restaurants, and venues are doing the right thing by adopting a strict ""No Trespass"" stance for federal agents who show up without a judge's signature. I am seeing this protective vibe strongly at community hubs like **Little Green Hive** and **Ursula's Cafe**, where they have historically pushed a beautiful message of inclusivity. The prevailing rule among these business owners is exactly what it should be: if a judge did not sign it, federal agents do not get past the counter.

Staff at several spots are reportedly being trained to understand this exact legal difference so they can actively keep their spaces safe. And it is not just the coffee shops. Immigrant owned staples like **Cuban Island Restaurant** and **A1 Afghan Restaurant and Grocery** are being heavily supported by locals who want to fiercely protect the international footprint that makes the valley so great. Organizations like **Casa Latina** and the **Roanoke Diversity Center** are stepping up in a huge way by helping distribute ""Know Your Rights"" information to these local storefronts.

### State Cover and Local Representation

This local push is getting a well deserved boost from Richmond. On February 4, 2026, Governor Abigail Spanberger signed an executive directive to end the state's 287(g) agreements. This effectively removes the mandate for state law enforcement like the Virginia State Police to act as federal immigration deputies (reported by Cardinal News).

Our own Delegate Sam Rasoul has been incredibly vocal on this front too. He publicly called for the abolition of ICE, framing it as a necessary step to rebuild trust between law enforcement and diverse communities (according to WVTF on January 15, 2026). It is refreshing to see local leaders actually backing up the community.

### A Welcoming City

Roanoke is a bridge city. We actually received a ""Certified Welcoming"" designation from Welcoming America back in April 2024 for our commitment to immigrant inclusion (Cardinal News). Some local business owners correctly argue that when unfamiliar federal vehicles are spotted in residential neighborhoods, it rattles the whole community and destroys the sense of safety we have built.

These local spots are saying they want to prioritize their regulars and their neighborhood vibe over facilitating federal overreach. They are choosing to operate as true safe spaces first and marketplaces second, which is exactly the kind of local economy we should be supporting.

Have you noticed any other specific shops in your neighborhood stepping up and adopting these ""Warrant Only"" policies? What are your favorite spots that are doing the right thing right now?

When I’m not talking to her or spending time with her, I feel an intense emotional ache and I swear sometimes it even feels physical.

I’ve started doing things for her that go beyond normal friendship: buying her coffee, cooking for her, giving her my things, drive her to places, rearranging my plans just to be available for her. It feels compulsive, like I can’t stop myself.

I can’t confess my feelings because she’s in a long-term, long-distance relationship, and I’m afraid I’ll lose the friendship entirely. At the same time, I can’t go no-contact. Even the smallest change in my behaviour, she notices and asks if I’m okay. If I pull away, I’m scared she’ll sense it and I’ll lose her anyway.

I feel stuck. Logically, I know distance might help me. But emotionally, every time she texts “you ok?”, my resolve melts.

I’m also an immigrant and don’t have many close friends here. The thought of losing her because of my own feelings feels devastating.

So I have overstayed my visit visa for about a year... 

A little back story.. 

Im 20 years old, came to Dubai from India on a tourist/visit visa, I came here in hopes of getting or finding a job. 

I was promised by someone i had spoken to ON FACEBOOK for a painters job, not my field ofcourse but I just needed to leave India as i was raised in Oman and dont know anything about India, my family isuin Oman but i have lost contact with them as they didnt wanttme to work, but while i was 16 I got a job and wanted to work and slowly started an artificial jewelry business that was doing great, due to my family's anger they cancelled my visa and told me to ""do everything on my own"" So I was deported to a country that I had never visited before ""india"" As my father is from India, mother fromiindonesia, I had savings of about 10,000 AED which i used to apply for a freelance 2 year visa to Dubai since I should be over 21+ if i wanted my own visa in Oman, I spent over 6500 AED for a freelance visa which later found out that i had been scammed and the person who took the money blocked me. 

He sent me a fake visa and with that i had already booked my ticket and was in the airport, too late to turn back whilst in the airport itself I applied for a 1 monthDubaiV urgent visa and postponed my flight to a day later as i was promised visa in 24 hour, i started researching all over facebook since Facebook groups is how i used to get jobs in oman, i connected with someone who promised me a painters job and he was Providing accommodation plus food, i agreed though salary was 900 AED and 12 hour work, but he said if i can learn the work fast he'd even give me the 2 year visa. 

After staying in the airport for 24 hours as before i was staying in a lodge or bedspace in mumbai which i had already checked out of I finally  got my visit visa approved, i flew the same day and landed in Abu Dhabi airport, from where i took a shuttle bus of etihad airways to Dubai, a whole new place for me, whole new experience and i had only 1250 AED to sustain myself for the month. 

I directly spoke with the painter job guy on whatsapp and he sent me a location to go to, apparently accomodation was there and he said work will start in 2 days, I went there and saw 16 PEOPLE in one room, it shocked me, people were smoking in the room, drinking in the room and what not, i was traumatized, but i have to stay becauss i dont have alot of money, i dont know about bedspace system or partition system, nothing. 

I stayed there for 3 days and during that time j used to go out in the morning and wander in the malls try to give out my CV here and there and come back in the evening to night to sleep because of the amount of people and cigarettes and all i couldnt bear it. 

The 4th day i was woken up by someone in the room and was forced to rush to a car with a few more guys and go for work, upon reaching the work i realized its not the same ""painting job"" I signed up for we were at the world trade center and we needed to pick up heavy bricks and basically clean up the event, i texted the guy who brought me to that room and me told me that its not his work but someone elses who is probably staying in my room and i should probably get paid 60-80 AED the same night. 

But after the work they told me that yes its not his work its their own like a daily basis job (diyadi) or something and that they would pay me, but they didnt pay, 2 days more of no painting job and the guy also stopped replying to me, again they made me go to another job, i refused as i wanted payment but they said if you dont go then pack your things and leave, i had no place to go to, thats why i stayed and went for the work, again as usual they didnt pay me, that night i was researching about mobile phones on dubizzle and figured i have 1000 AED something i should just buy and sell phones, i spoke with a seller and negotiated a good phone, to pick up the next day, I had gone to sleep and the next day i wake up and i couldnt find my wallet, i searched everywhere and finally found it near the toiler with NO MONEY. ALL STOLEN. I was so heartbroken i didnt know what to do as the room had 16 people and no camera, i tried to ask everyone but no one knew anything. 

Then the same evening the electricity went out and we all were forced to sit in a car for a job, but still no payment, we were brought to abu dhabi where we were forced to work for  23 hours straight picking up heavy wooden furniture and assisting in assembling them. 

After that when we came back there was nk electriciry still and the person in charge who was bringing us to jobs told us he will do somethinh about the electriciry but did nothing and we had to sleep without ac or anything. 

Then all of a sudden after getting just 3 hours of sleep at around 6-7 am in the morning we were forced to evacuate the room becauss they apparently hadnt paid rent. 

The one who was incharge had a cousin who always wanted to talk to me, this guy told me he knows another place where we will get job and theyll pay in evening, we went their this was in hor al anz, we worked for a week, but no payment, i was forced to work becauss if i didnt then i wouldnt be able to have an accomodation, after a week one night while i was trying to sleep this ""cousin"" Who brought me there started touching me inappropriately, as we had to sleep on on bed both of us because there was no space for 2, at night he started trying to touch me and rubbing his ehm against me. I stayed quiet and just stood up and went to toilet, after that i never slept at night only 1-2 hours while we're at some site for work. 

Apparently this cousin has an elder brother whos an alcoholic and plays betting every night, this brothee of his was eating our money, because he was older thus cousin allowed it also, i found this out from the management of that bedspace or labour accomodation who gives us work. 

Now i explain clearly to this cousin that im not here for games i have about 5-10 days until my visa expires i need to go back or get a visa, he promised me he'd either pay to extend my visa or he would find a job for me as he has got contacts. But a day or 2 later cousin has a fight with his brother and his brother slaps ME???? and tells both of us to leave, i kept quiet as i dont want any scene and left, he came with me as well, now im homeless and broke, but this cousin says no issues hes got someone who will give us a place, we go there and again only 1 bed, this was in bur dubai, no work just accomodation, he feeds me lies big dreams that he'll get me a job in hotel management and i can work in burj al arab with good salary etc because i know english, but then again he tried to ehm yk 'touch' me, thats when i had haf enough and asked him not to as im not like that and i need a job i had about 5 days pending, he promised me that theres a job with good pay per day lets go there from tomorrow, we went at 12am at NIGHT to the job and i find out that its 'selling alcohol' illegally, there was this whole operation for that, and i refused, im a muslim, i would never, he was a muslim as well but then...idk, anyways, he forced me and pushed me, he wasnt taking no for an answer, so finally i told him ill only do like standing far, he told me to take a cycle and use it to transport the bottles, i agreed but as soon as i got that cycle i cycled back to the accomodation, took my things and ditched the cycle there and ran back to hor al anz, spoke with the same guy who gave us work earlier and told him to ONLY pay me becauss i neeeded to make the money for my ticket. 

I work there for about a week, but the issue is is that the money i was getting 60 AED and 10 minus for the bedspace means 50 AED PER DAY, which i eventually went into overstay, then this cousin guy returned and he tried to get close to me again which i refused and set a boundary after that a new guy came for the same work but this guy knew english, ill name him A so A seemed like a good educated guy, family was in Dubai just going through a small downfall, i became friends with A my first actual friend in dubai, or.... I thought, until thus happened. 

One day A told me i had cash and wanted to check my wallet (as a friend) to go and eat out which I denied that i had cash as i save each and every penny for my visa, tho overstay seemed crazy to clear but not impossible, i had around 4-500 aed in savings, and it was in my bag with my passport and all, so he checked and found nothing, then he asked me to check his wallet which i refused but he insisted and there he had 1500 AED so i told him if he wanted to eat out then why not spend from his pocket since... He hasaalot, right? But he said hes only in dubai becauss he is here for giving driving lessons while earning a few bucks he actually stays in Sharjah, i was like okay, thats fine, fast forward a week or 5 days later i had a job interview in JBR, i didnt know how to get there but i have google maps right? So I go, this was 2nd december UAEs national day and i went there in the morning, after the interview i sort of just stayed because i read in the news that there were fireworks and i just wanted to be at some peace. 

Apparently after waiting for 8 hours or so the fireworks was cancelled, and everyone there was ledt in disappointment, i take the metro back at around 9-10 pm and accidentally fall asleep, waking up and last stop centerpoint and I realize its 1 am and no metro back, i didnt know how to get a taxi and saw that my phone js also dead, so i decided to follow the sign boards by walk on the main road that led to hor al anz, i was near the airport crossing the road when a police from the other side of the airport fence called me, i came to the fence and he asked me questions, why am i here at this time? Its illegal to cross the road that way, what am i doing so late at night like this? Where is my passport? Where js my visa? I explain that my passport is in my bag in my room and my visa is on my phone but its dead, i am on overtsay but im resolving my issues, during the time amnesty was going on but i wasnt eligible for amnesty as i came on october, so he called another police guy and they put me in the car and brought me to the police station in the airporr, got my phone charged and checked my passport and visa, then they let me go, they strictly told me to keep my passport with me at all times, so as soon as i reached my room i opened my bag only to find out that the lock is broken and my smaller bag is gone, which contained all my documents, passport and cash, i asked everyone in the morning but no one knew anything. 

No one admitted no one said anything, just we dont know, the guy A was getting close to the Cousin guy so we kind of drifted apart too so i didnt talk to him as much, i asked him as well byt he replied with dont accuse me. 

2 days later he claims that his 1500 AED is stolen, he checks with everyone but somehow he kept on telling me if i have it just give it back but i didnt have it, I didnt know myself who took it as i was at work for morning shift then night shift and both in sharjah and only after coming back he told me that his money was lost, a day or 2 passed and he had come on my bed to comb his hair as i only have a mirror, so as a joke i pushed him to the side to push him i pushed him from his waist which i felt passport type book feeling, i tried to check but he wouldnt budge, he kept saying its important document of his etc. I kept insisting but he just walked out quickly and i didnt know where he went and when he came back, that wasnt with him, the next morning i went to muraqqabat police station to file a complaint on him becauss i was sure he took it, maybe he suspected me, maybe it was cousin who told him to do so, so at the police station the police calls him and he lies to the police saying i took 5000 aed from him, to which the police told me to settle the matter with him. 

I was lost and made the decision to leave that accommodation, for the next 3 months or so i was homeless in the streets of deira, i was always around baniyas square, al rigga and union side, wandering around asking people for job, i didn't get a job, during the time i gave my luggage to a shopping center as ""baggage deposit"" Becauss i cant bring it with me everywhere and they refused to give it baack after 3 days and demanded 50 AED which i couldnt give, i slept on the streets in just one pair of clothes for about 3 months, i used to shower in the mosques and blew my entire visa savings on transport for interviews and food. 

After 3 months through Facebook after i shared my story someone said theyll help me figure out my visa, my passport and accommodation, and job, i was the happiest and thought that im the luckiest person alive. during the 3 months i tried to apply for a lost passport certificate again and again but it kept getting rejected due to ""techincal errors"" Or my passport detials wasnt found with immigration or something i tried through muraqqabat police station as well as online as well as qusais police. Nothing worked. Anyways that person comes and meets me, he spoke big things as if he was going to take over dubai, fed me with these big things, then told me that he has a canteen in sharjah al dhaid, told me to work there and he will do the visa and passport and he sells visas as well, at first when i got there there was no ac nothing, i worked and slept there jtself under the scorching sun but I wanted my visa and passport to be sorted so i struggled i had to make the sacrifice and its not like i wasnt homeless before. About 3- 4 months i worked there until the canteen was ready and AC was put and all but no sign of any earnings for me and no visa and no passport, i didnt care about the money i just wanted the passport and visa, but nothing? I spent 7 months or so in the same pair of clothes, and i couldn't do anything about it, after that through facebooo i again i was hired for a part time gig as a model for peets coffee in arabian ranches and theyd pay me 500 AED, i told this guy, let me name him N the guy who promised me visa and all, I told him about this and he said he'd drop me, this canteen was in a stadium 63 km from al nahda dubai, so i couldn't go myself of course now he comes and bring me to Dubai, where i had gone for the shoot, after the shoot i was to be paid 500 aed but through bank transfer and i didnt know anyone except this guy N so i requested him that if i receive the 500 through his bank can hw give me cash? He agreed to it, so i forwarded his bank details, for a month no cash was received and i didnt want to disturb him i didnt want him to think im doubting that he spent it or anything so i didnt ask, after a month i ask the sender and she says that she sent 2-3 days ago, i forward that message to him, and he was like ""oh that was yours? I thought it was from one of my client so i spent it, i dont have it now ill pay you when i get"" I was like just look after my passport and visa,its okay. 

Now after a few days the owner of that stadium comes to me and tells me that this guy N has been arrested due to ""fraud"" And im shook, no passport? No visa? And now hws arrested? And the owner kicks me out of there and tells me to take my things and leave as he's hiring someone else. I was so heartbroken but i had nothing to say. 

Next morning i was out and i again was homeless and broke in deira again as deira js the only place i knew, i spent my days just wandering here and there and trying to get a job, i became on absconding even, and was totally lost. 

Fast forward to 3-4 months ago, now I posted about my story again and someone offered me a bedspace, i stayed there for a month and during that time i saw a post where someone needed a model for content creation and i have been creating content in the past so i signed myself up for it and got it, it was a part time gig and they paid a little well, i was able to shift to al nahda sharjah as rent is cheaper here in bedspace and i even started mess food system with someone now i got 1-2 nore shoots after that and then yet again dry, people want to hire me but they want me to record myself and i didnt have an iphone anymore as i had to sell it while i was homeless, I had just a cheap android that camera doesnt work, i posted about this again on reddit seeing if maybe someone would help me out for any iphone so i can start getting gigs again, as many were waiting, someone finallu stepped forward and did they paid my pending rent of December and gave me an iphone 11, i started connecting with businesses again but yet again this wasnt going to sustain me, plus the new media license thing? Everyone asks about that, so i decide to look for jobs in contenr creation. Thats when finally i landed my first interview with a company, they liked me and my confidence and promised a job of content creator cum social media management in AD and that theyll test or train me for 3-4 days then theyll issue me the offer letter in which affer that theyll clear my fines and absconding as well.

This is like answered prayers and with a good company, plus they'll cut from my salary a percentage until they make all of their money back that they invested into me. 

Now the issue is:

1) I don't have money to go from al nahda to AD

2) i need to pay my pending rent. 

3) I need to pay for the mess pending payment as well. 

4) i was able to collect few things and clothes which i now need a suit case if im to take with me, which i dont have as well. 

What do i do? How do i resolve all of this? 

Im just lost and dont know what is to be done as this is my one and only chance of getting my visa status sorted and finally FINALLY having a job. 

P.s i received a call during my homeless time from the police and was told to come to muraqqabat police station to collect my passport so i have my passport but becauss of i was unable to pay for my bedspacr rent and mess i didnt want to lose it i gave my passport as collateral that ill collect it when i pay... And now i really need it and im just so lost... I need advice or like any charity place or somethinh idkkk im just so lost.. ",1,1771387245.0,UAE,0,1.0,False

Section 2.

The Stowaway

***(Twelve days ago.***

***Twelve?***

***Damn it, it’s supposed to be eleven.***

***Oh well… we’ll just have to catch up.)***

\~\~\~

Dellia, the great ring, should’ve hung in feathered clumps through Wade’s southern sky on a “fine” morning like this. Instead, the whole thing was smothered in blustery gray muck blowing sideways you could barely see through, maybe the last proper squall before Dellia’s shadow crept across the island kingdom.

Wade’s marina emptied out for the day, with everyone taking the storms as a personal, early invitation to the pubs for the Storms’ Passing festival.

Thing is, the festival was still two days away.

There were, of course, stubborn merchants pretending the market wouldn’t be affected. One bell in, though, and most of them headed in for shelter, warm cups, and local rumor tossing. At the far end of the wharf, where Tavern Street bent west toward the greater square, one refused to give in.

Esmeralda Rosalinda McGert.

She never missed a day.

The thought had crossed her mind to stay in. *Why risk being on the boat in this weather?* But she went out anyway.

And the catch was small.

The crowds? Nonexistent.

It was a bloody *rotten* day.

Neeson from the clothing stall across the way had been the only other one foolish enough to stay open for another bell, but the rain changed his mind too.

“Don’t forget this!” Esmeralda waved a wrapped redfish at him. “Someone ought to enjoy it. It’ll ruin overnight, and I’ve got more than enough.”

“Speakin’ of things sourin’...” Neeson skipped over the merging puddles and plopped three tins of paint down. “These’re goin’ bad. Grandson forgot ‘em on the upper shelf. They’re for the rubbish if you don’t want ‘em.”

Esme stole a glance at her stand. The whole thing was as tired as her captain’s coat. With a gleam in her eye, she reached over the counter and snatched Neeson by the shoulders, hauling him in for a quick kiss on the cheek. “I know *exactly* what to do!”

As Neeson, flushed, stumbled home, Esme flipped her sign to CLOSED and dumped her counter goods into an oversized basket. “You’ll be a fine feast!” she muttered, making her way to Beggar’s Corner. She found a father she’d seen there all week and pressed it into his hands. “Just make sure you lot finish these by tonight or they’ll spoil. Invite some of the others from the Corner over. There’s plenty to go round, and those blokes might be helpful in other ways. Just tell ’em this is from McGert and they’ll see to it you’re cared for.” She noticed how thin he and his wife were. The kids hovered back a few steps, watching.

“Say, why don’t *you* and yours come by my place anytime tomorrow, alright? I’ll have more.”

The father was having trouble keeping his emotions in check, but managed a nod.

“Aw now, donna’ ya worry. Things will pick up for ya. I know it.” She gave a wink, and pushed him back towards his family. “Just remember to come by. Now go on and have a nice night.” She spun on her heel, yelling over her shoulder as she sprinted away, “Stay warm, ya hear!”

Back at the booth, the rain finally broke as she whipped up some fish balls for trade. After a small snack for herself, she made her way to see Ole Tom, who had a proper goods shop on the other side of the market. After negotiations for the fish balls (*and an added kiss on the cheek for Tom*), she had what she needed- brushes! Esme raced to the booth, and immediately set upon painting the inside with the tin of egg blue. Once the storm had passed completely, she tied a brush to a stick for the exterior, splattering globs of red and white paint on the ground which, like the mud, still hadn’t fully dried.

It had an… eye-catching effect, with every other shingle a different color. Some would say it wasn’t even close to a good piece of art, but for Esmeralda it was a masterpiece.

Despite the storm, the rest of the day left her with a grin she couldn’t shake. It was there from ear-to-ear as she dropped crab pots and shrimp traps before dinner. It was there when she contemplated going out, but decided bed was the smart choice. It was still plastered on her face when she woke like clockwork and whipped up a proper breakfast: buttered biscuit, spiced eggs, salt pork, and a damn fine coffee that could raise the dead. She gave a generous pour of cream in a mug the size of her head and pinched sea salt into the grounds to cut the bitterness.

Her father’s trick.

She was in such a damn fine mood, she crowned her biscuit with a spoonful of Mople berry preserve.

Rare as mercy.

Not because you couldn’t get the fruit in Wade. You could find anything here if you knew who to ask and what to pay. Mople just wasn’t something you got anymore. Not in Wade. Not anywhere. These days you only heard about it in rumors, or in the few stubborn jars that had survived longer than they had any right to.

And those, were guarded like sin.

She savored the last bit of breakfast when a chime went off in her moss-green canvas jacket. Her hand dove into a pocket, past a gutting knife and some twine until it landed on the pomander pocket-clock. She pulled it out and flipped open the case. The inside face was marked in thirteen neat divisions, each one notched with a tiny bell, with the hand now pulling deep past the second bell.

Esme clicked her tongue and snapped the device shut. “Late. Damn.”

She dropped the pomander back in the pocket. Her father had traded favors, pride, and a handful of rings he didn’t have to spare to get it made by a Kaiin tinker before he died- he hated being late.

And now she was late.

Late by her standards. Still ahead of most of Wade.

In a burst of energy, she donned her formal gear: a lanolin black and yellow gansey, with matching sou’wester, woolen stockings, overalls, belt, and fresh dubbin boots. She didn’t bother to tidy before heading out, pulling on the proper waxed, highly patched, and fish-blood bullied slicker with a flourish. A quick pat confirmed all was where it was supposed to be. Ditty Bag, Fid, sheepsfoot rig knife, marlspike, whet stone. She pulled nippers from an inner pocket of the jacket and slid them over her hands. Locking the door behind her, she strode out into the morning-night where the docks were loud with slap of wet planks, rope creak, and a gull that hadn’t fallen asleep, yelling at nothing.

Jimmy the drunk wasn’t whistling his way home.

Ty and Ren, the morning guards, walked by already on shift.

“Runnin’ behind, Esme?” quipped Ty.

“Aye, but breakfast was worth it!”

“Had to be to keep you this long,” mused Ren.

They shared a passing laugh. She spun on one heel. “Oh! Swing by mah booth and have a gander! Let me know what you think later!” Then hustled on.

Damn, she *was* late. But, today was going to be a *damn* fine day. *Twas in da bones*.

Esme’s boat sat low in the water with lines led true to the bollards. Forty-three feet of carvel-built coast-crawler, gaff-rigged with a single mast her father had stepped himself.

She felt the moorline give an impatient tug against the wooden pillars as the flood began to push into the marina. Most wouldn’t notice the change. “Double damns. Slack’s already broke. Gotta be quick about this.” The captain heaved herself up the snubbed line and over a timber-head, boots slamming the boards past the nets stacked tidy to port.

She felt twelve again even thinking she heard her father\*.\*

*“A damns pirate would be proud.”*

Then, straight to the tiller.

Her father had replaced it twice, and the second time he’d used Tíbar ironwood that cost him a month’s wages.

“*Worth every damn coin*.”

From here, thanks to her father, she could run the whole operation herself.

*“Let no lubber take from ye wast ye can do yashelf.”*

The man’s handiwork was everywhere. A rigged tie-off and a double-pulley on the main halyard so she could raise sail without leaving the helm. A modified centerboard that came up and down on a lever. Narrow storage bins built into the gunwales to keep her gear dry. Even the keel, reshaped and sheathed in copper to cut drag, and that big leaf-shaped rudder he’d hung on the stern for tighter turns when the harbor got crowded.

The best trick lived right in the deck. A plain iron handle by the tiller.

Esme hooked her fingers under it and yanked, triggering mooring slip-lines.

Chain snapped taut through its guides

The free ends slipped out of the bitts.

The bights dropped clean off the bollards.

The lines came hissing back through angled fairleads, stacking in wet coils on deck.

Up forward, the anchor clapped hard into its chocks.

Esme gave a nearby handle a quick wrist-flick and along the gunwale, the pot-runner woke up. Crab pots and shrimp traps skated aft on little rollers, bumping one by one into a stop-rail right beside the helm. All close enough she could work them with one hand while the other stayed married to the boat.

Those were just *some* of the tricks he built into this tugger.

Sunk every dime into it. Even then, doing it all himself, her father died owing half the island. But, he’d left her “…*ah boot any shooul on Wade wo’ld envah*.”

Esme was still grinning as she leaned a hip into the till and hauled the halyard as the bow swung free, despite the flood.

It was, by all accounts, a good Wade-morning for fishing. Just enough breeze to let her hide in the ripples. Moonless, Iria setting early. Mild overcast to cut what was left in the sky.

Halfway into her daily rotation, she had more load than she really needed.

Tomorrow’s odds and ends were mostly done, already waiting in neat coils and quiet knots. The barnacled crab pots were reset with fresh twine. The longlines were already stowed. Fire-fishing was done; the lantern let low to a dim glow that she wasn’t going to bother to hood. She’d made her deepwater dive at Bilber Hallow first thing after the pots and, invigorating as it was, she wished she’d skipped it. The chill sticks with you.

The main catch already had been sorted, which meant only the drift nets were earnin’ a living at the moment. Anything else was tempting the sea to get clever, and she was fine being greedy with the quiet.

Esme enjoyed the boredom and thinning clouds as they drifted by, washing the moment down with a sip of Dead Horse Reserve. She heard her father’s voice as she traced the sky.

*“Now, wat do ya sees? Back east.”*

“Broken Crown chasin’ the silver road of Iria.”

*“West?”*

“Dellia.”

*“Nerth?”*

“The island.”

*“An’ in wintah?”*

“Perhaps light from Ten Towns on a very good night.”

*“Ye’ll be needin’ dis someday. C’mon now.”*

“Sundtí’s Velvet.”

*“O’erhead?”*

“Fisher’s Knot.”

*“South?”*

“The Drifters’ Union.”

*“Summah?”*

“Ghost Sun, with the frayed edge of the Great White Arch.”

*Here’s to you, Dad.*

Esme went to salute and noticed something off with the sky. An extra shimmer… moving. Coming in quick from the north. She fished a scope from her pocket and tried to catch it as it changed direction, now heading due east back towards Wade.

The ironwood tiller picked up a vibration which built to a painful buzz. She loosened her hand and let it hunt in the swell, trusting the boat for a breath while she glued her eye to the glass.

Bits of the familiar sky blinked out. Then returned. More blinks.

It was almost on top of her when she heard the familiar whisper of twin engines. Had it not been so still, she would have missed it.

“Well, hot damn. Ship 23. Looks like it’ll be a good time in the ol’ town tonight.”

The anomaly passed over, and the air dragged a sudden swirl across the water. Seconds later came a confused chop. Esme threw her weight back against the Tíbar ironwood to keep the bow from broaching.

“To hell with this!”

She snapped the scope shut and popped the pins on the drift-net winch. As soon as she could, she made way for port- partly hoping to catch a glimpse of Ship’s engineer, assuming Ship 23 landed in one piece. One never knows with that heap.

Esme was off-boat before the sky bothered with colors. Good she was back early, because offloading should’ve been easy. It wasn’t. Not because anything was broken.

Esme was... *distracted*.

She stretched time scraping the salt trays. Dragged the smoker into the lane instead of keeping it tucked out back. Sorted the fish. Twice. Anything she could do to have an excuse to stop every few minutes, make a little square with her fingers, and squint at her booth’s new paint job as if it might applaud her back.

Finally, she rolled out the surprise barrel from the day’s haul, a few sulking lobsters who’d been cheated out of a proper fight. She quickly plucked a rust-pike from the snapping mess. “Oh, you! *You* can get bent!” She marched it to the edge, and flung it back into the sea. “Go be crab food.”

On the way back she snatched up four large buckets of deepwater and brought them around front. “Oi, Neeson! What ya think of the new look!?!”

A voice from the empty-looking stall across the way answered back, “I knew if anyone could do something with that old paint, you could, darlin’!”

Esme chuckled. She’d hoped coming back early would mean he wasn’t there. Nothing malicious- she was his friend and all, but somehow the mangy coot beat her here every morning and she hadn’t the faintest clue how.

“I’m gonna beat you one of these days!”

“I hope you do!”

It would have been better if he had said something a bit more competitive. This just meant, or so Esme thought, he didn’t think she ever would.

Her mind drifted. She kept half a thought on beating Neeson, half on the white ventveil fronds from the buckets. She lightly squeezed the brine water from the plants, fingers white with cold that didn’t seem to bother her. Plant only worked if you handled it proper. Get ‘em smoothed out, let ‘em warm slightly and it would sweat a jelly that stayed cold on its own. Had to keep them a touch damp, because if they turned blue, they were done.

An academic regular once told her it was called “*Laminaria Profundis Ventivela*.” Sounded fancy, but most people she knew just called them deepwater cloth. Ventveil, deepwater cloth, ghost wave... Whatever folks wanted to call it- it did the trick, staying cool through the afternoon if you kept the sun off.

Ice cost a fortune in Wade, but deepwater cloths? Free for the taking if you didn’t mind the cold and knew where to dive without extra equipment.

*And to think, I nearly skipped grabbing these.*

Bilber Hallow was a perfect spot for divable deepwater, and one you kept to yourself. Good for a quick morning dip, but it went too thin near four bells. Miss it early and you were stuck running clear past Widow’s Reach for a **deeper drop**. It was just a choice of when you wanted to be cold, how deep you wanted to go, and how soon you wanted to be back.

*Hells. I’d just be pullin’ in from Widow’s Reach.*

Then it all *clicked*.

“Oh! Oh, that’s clever!” she said with a laugh.

“Who is?” Neeson was never there when you looked.

“I am, of course!”

“Course you are, dear!”

*That’s how I’ll beat him! Bilber Hallow. It’s not a bad idea really, if you could catch it before it was full shallow*.

She smoothed the cloths into a base bed for the booth then put up her ‘money-fish’. She staged the three best in a centerpiece: A good-sized Penny-fish Mutton and Grey-Bait-Stealer each flanking a Lead-Belly Landlord. She propped one up with a rolled strip of cloth, just enough tilt to make the scales throw back the morning that was just waking up.

*You could haul anchor early after the holiday tomorrow* *if you have another catch like today.*

To one side she coiled ribbonfish like silver belts, teeth smiling. Squid in a shallow wet-pan up front, smear of ink on the buyer’s side. Salt can and fish balls opposite.

*It could work.*

Everyday fish made up the rest. Sea-Darts on the left. Silver Plates near the front. Knucklers in a bruised pile. Glass-Rain in a shallow tray, Lantern-Fuel beside it, and Scribbles- still twitchy- laid out on the right. She kept a couple of Borrowshark center-back.

*Cut through the hallow on the return, right at Don’t-Get-Greedy Knife before the water turned too thin to float a cork.*

Crabs went into a lidded basket with a stone on top, because crabs had ideas when you let them. The bait shrimp stayed tucked under cloth in the shade, still twitching.

*Double quick back. Fifteen minutes to dock.*

Fish balls at the front. Salt in a tin with a scoop. Smoked redfish strips hanging like flags. Dead center front was some strange creature she accidentally hauled in that looked like melting butter. An eye-catcher for any passerby.

*That’ll shave me*\- she counted on her fingers, “Ten minutes!”

“What’s that?”

“Oh nothing, Neeson! Just chattin’ up these here fish.”

She smiled even larger now, grabbing another handful of the deepwater cloth. She was sure it was a good plan, especially since no fool had been out that way for weeks… not since those damn Qalupalik had shown up. Those merfolk were an absolute nuisance. Clip one and a whole damn swarm would be upon you faster than you can sneeze. Then what? Yer spendin’ the next few days cocooned up somewhere, living out your worst humiliations on a loop.

“Some for you,” she muttered, stuffing a few small strips around random tails. “And some for my poor ole feet.” She dropped a few strips into her water bucket. “And hopefully some for that family.” She took the final few strips and wrapped some of the blue muttons and kingfish she had set aside.

She tidied a few last bits, and stepped back into the lane, almost to Neeson’s booth, and took it all in.

The egg blue interior and the red-and-white checkerboard exterior made it look like an oversized children’s toy. It was stuffed with every fish you’d want in a day.

That grin crept back across her face.

She’d done that.

And it was perfect.

She stomped back over and flipped a hand-scrawled sign that read: **OPEN**.

“Alright, Neeson!” Esmeralda slapped both palms on her counter. “I know you’ve been lurkin’ over there pretendin’ you’re not starin’. Come on over and see the catch of the day! Fresher than a sea breeze at dawn. Got new sea salt ready too, just scraped it off the trays. And look here, Lamp-oil catch! Just like you love.” Esmeralda moved her upturned hands over the crown jewels of her booth. “Redfish smoked to perfection!”

Across the lane, a head rose slow over a stack of folded linen like a suspicious turtle. He moved around front, laying out a choice of exotic fabrics and expertly woven clothes.

“You could sell sand to a beach, Esmeralda.”

“And you could sell shame to a saint, but we don’t bring that up in public. Now really. Tell me what you think of the paint job and the way this is all laid out. Look at that presentation. This here is craft. That’s discipline. That’s...”

“…That’s a crime,” Neeson pointed towards the Butter-blob in the front.

“Oh, don’t you start with me,” Esme laughed. “That’s an eye-catcher. People see that and go, ‘What in Dellia’s tears is that?’ and then they’re already halfway to handin’ me coin.”

Neeson finally pushed off his stall and shuffled over, coat flapping, boots complaining. He leaned in, sniffed it once squinting hard.

“Well, what in the hells is it?”

“No clue. Just caught in the nets.”

“I’ve lived by the sea my entire life and I’m still surprised by what you fisher folk could conjure up. Alright then, let’s get a sample of smoked.”

“Sample?!? HA! If I didn’t love you, you old coot, I’d smack your knuckles with the marlspike for even thinkin’ that word.”

“Love’s a strong claim,” Neeson said, reaching anyway.

Esme swatted his hand, “You want a sample, you buy a strip. This ain’t charity lane.”

“That’s rich,” he muttered, glancing toward Beggar’s Corner. “Heard tale that the whole alley ate fine last night.”

Esme’s grin returned. “Well. It was just a Storms’ Passing gift. A little charity never hurts, ya know.”

“I reckon not. You got plans for feast tomorrow?”

“Dead Horse Inn!”

Neeson made a sound like he’d tasted something sour. “I don’ know why anybody ever goes there. Terrible. Specially on a holiday.”

“Well, I get one full day off a year and I plan to enjoy it. And speaking of time off, we both gotta get ready. So, what’s your- I can’t believe I’m saying this, *sample* gonna be?”

“I knew you were a class act, Esme.”

“I got ribbonfish, squid that’ll still argue with you, knucklers, scribbles, these twitchy little bastards here, an’ a Borrowshark I swear tried to bite me through the net. I’m tellin’ you, Neeson… I got a feelin’. Today’s got bones.”

“I hope so. I need to get some cloth and I can’t afford to go back to Armendale yet. So?”

“Whatever you like Neeson. Just don’ get greedy.”

Neeson looked over the catch as Esme’s eyes landed a glimpse of the uncloaked Ship 23 moored in air dock.

It was a marvelous wreck of a machine that should have been retired seven generations of McGerts ago. Patched and repaired more than her old coat, with twin balloons on adjustable rigging. A throwback to the Fleet’s original days when they were still figuring out which way was up.

Legends enough of the damn thing dropping parts, or people, from more than twenty roofs high. You might get lucky and it wouldn’t smack your boat or gear, but be damned if something like that wouldn’t ruin a few hours of work by spookin’ the fish. One of her too-many-greats-grandmothers called It *a “floatin’ coffin with delusions”* in the family log books, and that was one of the more kind descriptions.

Despite looking as bad up close as it did from a distance, in today’s dawn light the rust and imperfections melted, presenting the ship in all of its majestic glory. Perhaps this clouded reality came from a nostalgic childhood fancies for flying one of those beasties.

Or, perhaps, it was because she had a good view of Durin Boltbreaker.

Her engineer…

He was in deep discussion with Captain Marcus Wrekclaw over the cargo going on board, bending over a barrel to mark it with a black “X”.

*Ten years younger, and I’d have that Boltbreaker over this barrel instead of these damned lobsters!*

She bit her lower lip and sighed. Without turning back to Neeson, she asked, “Where were we?”

Neeson followed her gaze and made that sour sound again. “That heap’s bringin’ trouble again. Heard they’re gonna try to do somethin’ about the Qalupalik. But we’ll see. Bet they’ll just get drunk and burn down another bar.”

“That wasn’t their fault.”

“Says you.”

“And Excuse me? Heap? That’s Fleet. That’s history. That’s...”

“That’s a floating argument,” Neeson cut in. “An’ you’re starin’.”

She snapped around. “I am not!”

“Yes’n ya were.”

“I’m… checkin’... the weather.”

“Mmmm hmmm.” Neeson’s eyes flicked up to the sky. “Weather’s right there. Yer flushed as a rose,” then he tapped the butter-blobfish with one knuckle. “An’ this thing’s judgin’ me. I’ll sample some of the Lampers and since I’m so generous, I’ll buy a smoked.”

Esme laughed and hooked her thumb toward the smoked redfish strips. “Alright then, you miserable fabric goblin. This one here gave me a hell of a fight. I was thinkin’ I’d keep it for myself.”

Neeson leaned in, suddenly serious. “That’s not keepin’,” he said. “That’s braggin’!”",1,1771387185.0,fantasywriters,0,1.0,False

1. To the left of the building (south-oriented) was a coffee/tea shop of some kind
2. The place was extremely punk. A neon sign sat above the entrance to this place, and I envison it saying ""XXX"". Probably too on-the-nose but that's how I remembered it
3. Walkways everywhere. The upper floor had a catwalk in the middle of the warehouse, and I recall there being a way to the store's front where a restaurant/hangout space was situated.
4. Some of those other shops on the upper and lower floors included a plant shop, at least one restaurant, and some thrifting in the very back of the warehouse.

That's all I can recall, but if anyone knows what the hell I'm talking about, that'd be great! Thanks!

I’ve been searching for a personal finance app for weeks, but everything I find feels like a glorified ledger book. I don’t just want to see where my money went last month; I want to plan where it’s going for the next 20 years.
I’m looking for something very specific for my FIRE journey, and I’m wondering if anyone has found an app that does this:
Top-Down Savings Goals: Most apps focus on ""Spending Categories."" I want one that focuses on Savings Horizons—specifically bucketed into Emergency, Short-term, Medium-term, and Retirement/FIRE.
Built-in SIP/Goal Math: I need the app to tell me exactly what my monthly contribution should be to hit a target (factoring in interest/returns) without me having to use an external calculator every time.
The 50/30/20 Rule UI: I’m trying to stick to this framework, but I want an app that actually builds its dashboard around these ratios so I can see my ""Wants"" limit in real-time.
Manual Entry ONLY: This is the dealbreaker. I do not want bank-syncing or SMS scraping. I value my privacy, and more importantly, I want to feel the ""pain of spending"" by entering things manually to stay disciplined.
Multi-Currency: Since I deal with different currencies (INR/USD/MXN), I need it to handle that seamlessly.
Does such a thing even exist? Or am I stuck using a complex Excel sheet forever? I’ve tried the big ones (YNAB, Mint alternatives, etc.), but they all seem to push automation and ""reactive"" tracking.
Would appreciate any ""hidden gem"" suggestions that are more about planning a life than just tracking a coffee.",1,1771386578.0,personalfinanceindia,0,1.0,False

Although Tokyo has some outdoor cafés, terrace restaurants, and rooftop bars (especially at hotels or more upscale spots), it feels like there aren’t many casual, walk-in, everyday places where you can just grab a coffee or drink outside without needing a reservation or being seated at a formal table.

In a lot of other major cities I’ve been to, outdoor seating is pretty common and accessible. They’re places where you can casually hang out, maybe even mingle a bit, without it feeling like a special occasion or fine-dining experience.

Maybe I’m just not looking in the right neighborhoods? I know of a couple of Starbucks in Shibuya and Harajuku but those are the only ones that come to mind. 

Are there any more laid-back, easygoing spots in Tokyo with somewhat spacious outdoor seating or rooftop vibes that don’t require planning ahead? Would love recommendations for casual al fresco coffee or drinks.

1r7sgoi,https://archive.ph/YdROx,"Air Force One will sport Trump’s preferred paint job, after Air Force again reverses course | CNN","President Donald Trump’s preferred paint colors will be applied to the new planes which will serve as Air Force One, an Air Force official tells CNN.

The new heavily modified Boeing 747s, which the military designates VC-25B, will be painted red, white, gold and dark blue, a color scheme proposed during Trump’s first term in office but reversed by the Biden administration.

“Air Force One is going to be incredible,” Trump said in 2018. “It’s going to be the top of the line, the top in the world. And it’s going to be red, white and blue, which I think is appropriate.”

The planes which serve as Air Force One have been painted a baby blue and white livery since the Kennedy administration, and Trump’s proposed change sparked speculation that he intended to replicate the colors of his personal Boeing 757.

In 2022, during the Biden administration, the livery was rejected by the Air Force citing cost and technical reasons.

“Further analysis concluded darker colors, among other factors, on the underside of the VC-25B aircraft might contribute to temperatures exceeding the current qualification limits of a small number of components,” a spokesperson said at the time.

The military proposed new renderings in 2023 of a design selected by Biden which looked very similar to the baby blue livery in use for more than 60 years, with a slightly darker tint.

When Trump was reelected his Air Force One paint scheme was again front and center, displayed on the evening of his inauguration on top of a cake at the Commander In Chief Ball. Now, it is often seen in a model on the coffee table in the Oval Office. A Department of Homeland Security Boeing 737 also started flying with a similar paint job last year.

Now, the Air Force says the livery will be applied to two new Boeing 747s being modified by Boeing and a 747 donated to the military by Qatar, which Trump has ordered be retrofitted for use as Air Force One. The Qatari jet could be flying as early as this summer.

The colors will also be applied during scheduled maintenance to four of the smaller C-32 aircraft, a military version of the Boeing 757, currently in the fleet.

“The first C-32 has been painted and is expected to be delivered to the Air Force in the next few months,” an Air Force spokesperson confirmed to CNN.",1,1771386520.0,WhatTrumpHasDone,0,1.0,False

The Vortex 66PC is...not my cup of tea.

It feels pretty cheap, has no heft to it whatsoever, and the stock caps and switches (some variation of Cherry MX Whites), sounded like a toy cash register. Figured this was a good time to play around with some mods.

Simple tape mod on the bottom of the PCB, lined the inside of the case with some tungsten tape, and replaced the switches and keycaps (I'm honestly not sure what these caps are, I think they were an Amazon find, my wife grabbed them from the closet and said she thought they'd look nice, which turned out to be correct).

Is it a great keyboard now? Nope. But because it's wireless, I think it's going on the coffee table and it'll be used to enter the occasional password on my couch gaming PC. All good.

Section 2.

The Stowaway

***(Twelve days ago.***

***Twelve?***

***Damn it, it’s supposed to be eleven.***

***Oh well… we’ll just have to catch up.)***

\~\~\~

Dellia, the great ring, should’ve hung in feathered clumps through Wade’s southern sky on a “fine” morning like this. Instead, the whole thing was smothered in blustery gray muck blowing sideways you could barely see through, maybe the last proper squall before Dellia’s shadow crept across the island kingdom.

Wade’s marina emptied out for the day, with everyone taking the storms as a personal, early invitation to the pubs for the Storms’ Passing festival.

Thing is, the festival was still two days away.

There were, of course, stubborn merchants pretending the market wouldn’t be affected. One bell in, though, and most of them headed in for shelter, warm cups, and local rumor tossing. At the far end of the wharf, where Tavern Street bent west toward the greater square, one refused to give in.

Esmeralda Rosalinda McGert.

She never missed a day.

The thought had crossed her mind to stay in. *Why risk being on the boat in this weather?* But she went out anyway.

And the catch was small.

The crowds? Nonexistent.

It was a bloody *rotten* day.

Neeson from the clothing stall across the way had been the only other one foolish enough to stay open for another bell, but the rain changed his mind too.

“Don’t forget this!” Esmeralda waved a wrapped redfish at him. “Someone ought to enjoy it. It’ll ruin overnight, and I’ve got more than enough.”

“Speakin’ of things sourin’...” Neeson skipped over the merging puddles and plopped three tins of paint down. “These’re goin’ bad. Grandson forgot ‘em on the upper shelf. They’re for the rubbish if you don’t want ‘em.”

Esme stole a glance at her stand. The whole thing was as tired as her captain’s coat. With a gleam in her eye, she reached over the counter and snatched Neeson by the shoulders, hauling him in for a quick kiss on the cheek. “I know *exactly* what to do!”

As Neeson, flushed, stumbled home, Esme flipped her sign to CLOSED and dumped her counter goods into an oversized basket. “You’ll be a fine feast!” she muttered, making her way to Beggar’s Corner. She found a father she’d seen there all week and pressed it into his hands. “Just make sure you lot finish these by tonight or they’ll spoil. Invite some of the others from the Corner over. There’s plenty to go round, and those blokes might be helpful in other ways. Just tell ’em this is from McGert and they’ll see to it you’re cared for.” She noticed how thin he and his wife were. The kids hovered back a few steps, watching.

“Say, why don’t *you* and yours come by my place anytime tomorrow, alright? I’ll have more.”

The father was having trouble keeping his emotions in check, but managed a nod.

“Aw now, donna’ ya worry. Things will pick up for ya. I know it.” She gave a wink, and pushed him back towards his family. “Just remember to come by. Now go on and have a nice night.” She spun on her heel, yelling over her shoulder as she sprinted away, “Stay warm, ya hear!”

Back at the booth, the rain finally broke as she whipped up some fish balls for trade. After a small snack for herself, she made her way to see Ole Tom, who had a proper goods shop on the other side of the market. After negotiations for the fish balls (*and an added kiss on the cheek for Tom*), she had what she needed- brushes! Esme raced to the booth, and immediately set upon painting the inside with the tin of egg blue. Once the storm had passed completely, she tied a brush to a stick for the exterior, splattering globs of red and white paint on the ground which, like the mud, still hadn’t fully dried.

It had an… eye-catching effect, with every other shingle a different color. Some would say it wasn’t even close to a good piece of art, but for Esmeralda it was a masterpiece.

Despite the storm, the rest of the day left her with a grin she couldn’t shake. It was there from ear-to-ear as she dropped crab pots and shrimp traps before dinner. It was there when she contemplated going out, but decided bed was the smart choice. It was still plastered on her face when she woke like clockwork and whipped up a proper breakfast: buttered biscuit, spiced eggs, salt pork, and a damn fine coffee that could raise the dead. She gave a generous pour of cream in a mug the size of her head and pinched sea salt into the grounds to cut the bitterness.

Her father’s trick.

She was in such a damn fine mood, she crowned her biscuit with a spoonful of Mople berry preserve.

Rare as mercy.

Not because you couldn’t get the fruit in Wade. You could find anything here if you knew who to ask and what to pay. Mople just wasn’t something you got anymore. Not in Wade. Not anywhere. These days you only heard about it in rumors, or in the few stubborn jars that had survived longer than they had any right to.

And those, were guarded like sin.

She savored the last bit of breakfast when a chime went off in her moss-green canvas jacket. Her hand dove into a pocket, past a gutting knife and some twine until it landed on the pomander pocket-clock. She pulled it out and flipped open the case. The inside face was marked in thirteen neat divisions, each one notched with a tiny bell, with the hand now pulling deep past the second bell.

Esme clicked her tongue and snapped the device shut. “Late. Damn.”

She dropped the pomander back in the pocket. Her father had traded favors, pride, and a handful of rings he didn’t have to spare to get it made by a Kaiin tinker before he died- he hated being late.

And now she was late.

Late by her standards. Still ahead of most of Wade.

In a burst of energy, she donned her formal gear: a lanolin black and yellow gansey, with matching sou’wester, woolen stockings, overalls, belt, and fresh dubbin boots. She didn’t bother to tidy before heading out, pulling on the proper waxed, highly patched, and fish-blood bullied slicker with a flourish. A quick pat confirmed all was where it was supposed to be. Ditty Bag, Fid, sheepsfoot rig knife, marlspike, whet stone. She pulled nippers from an inner pocket of the jacket and slid them over her hands. Locking the door behind her, she strode out into the morning-night where the docks were loud with slap of wet planks, rope creak, and a gull that hadn’t fallen asleep, yelling at nothing.

Jimmy the drunk wasn’t whistling his way home.

Ty and Ren, the morning guards, walked by already on shift.

“Runnin’ behind, Esme?” quipped Ty.

“Aye, but breakfast was worth it!”

“Had to be to keep you this long,” mused Ren.

They shared a passing laugh. She spun on one heel. “Oh! Swing by mah booth and have a gander! Let me know what you think later!” Then hustled on.

Damn, she *was* late. But, today was going to be a *damn* fine day. *Twas in da bones*.

Esme’s boat sat low in the water with lines led true to the bollards. Forty-three feet of carvel-built coast-crawler, gaff-rigged with a single mast her father had stepped himself.

She felt the moorline give an impatient tug against the wooden pillars as the flood began to push into the marina. Most wouldn’t notice the change. “Double damns. Slack’s already broke. Gotta be quick about this.” The captain heaved herself up the snubbed line and over a timber-head, boots slamming the boards past the nets stacked tidy to port.

She felt twelve again even thinking she heard her father*.*

*“A damns pirate would be proud.”*

Then, straight to the tiller.

Her father had replaced it twice, and the second time he’d used Tíbar ironwood that cost him a month’s wages.

“*Worth every damn coin*.”

From here, thanks to her father, she could run the whole operation herself.

*“Let no lubber take from ye wast ye can do yashelf.”*

The man’s handiwork was everywhere. A rigged tie-off and a double-pulley on the main halyard so she could raise sail without leaving the helm. A modified centerboard that came up and down on a lever. Narrow storage bins built into the gunwales to keep her gear dry. Even the keel, reshaped and sheathed in copper to cut drag, and that big leaf-shaped rudder he’d hung on the stern for tighter turns when the harbor got crowded.

The best trick lived right in the deck. A plain iron handle by the tiller.

Esme hooked her fingers under it and yanked, triggering mooring slip-lines.

Chain snapped taut through its guides

The free ends slipped out of the bitts.

The bights dropped clean off the bollards.

The lines came hissing back through angled fairleads, stacking in wet coils on deck.

Up forward, the anchor clapped hard into its chocks.

Esme gave a nearby handle a quick wrist-flick and along the gunwale, the pot-runner woke up. Crab pots and shrimp traps skated aft on little rollers, bumping one by one into a stop-rail right beside the helm. All close enough she could work them with one hand while the other stayed married to the boat.

Those were just *some* of the tricks he built into this tugger.

Sunk every dime into it. Even then, doing it all himself, her father died owing half the island. But, he’d left her “…*ah boot any shooul on Wade wo’ld envah*.”

Esme was still grinning as she leaned a hip into the till and hauled the halyard as the bow swung free, despite the flood.

It was, by all accounts, a good Wade-morning for fishing. Just enough breeze to let her hide in the ripples. Moonless, Iria setting early. Mild overcast to cut what was left in the sky.

Halfway into her daily rotation, she had more load than she really needed.

Tomorrow’s odds and ends were mostly done, already waiting in neat coils and quiet knots. The barnacled crab pots were reset with fresh twine. The longlines were already stowed. Fire-fishing was done; the lantern let low to a dim glow that she wasn’t going to bother to hood. She’d made her deepwater dive at Bilber Hallow first thing after the pots and, invigorating as it was, she wished she’d skipped it. The chill sticks with you.

The main catch already had been sorted, which meant only the drift nets were earnin’ a living at the moment. Anything else was tempting the sea to get clever, and she was fine being greedy with the quiet.

Esme enjoyed the boredom and thinning clouds as they drifted by, washing the moment down with a sip of Dead Horse Reserve. She heard her father’s voice as she traced the sky.

*“Now, wat do ya sees? Back east.”*

“Broken Crown chasin’ the silver road of Iria.”

*“West?”*

“Dellia.”

*“Nerth?”*

“The island.”

*“An’ in wintah?”*

“Perhaps light from Ten Towns on a very good night.”

*“Ye’ll be needin’ dis someday. C’mon now.”*

“Sundtí’s Velvet.”

*“O’erhead?”*

“Fisher’s Knot.”

*“South?”*

“The Drifters’ Union.”

*“Summah?”*

“Ghost Sun, with the frayed edge of the Great White Arch.”

*Here’s to you, Dad.*

Esme went to salute and noticed something off with the sky. An extra shimmer… moving. Coming in quick from the north. She fished a scope from her pocket and tried to catch it as it changed direction, now heading due east back towards Wade.

The ironwood tiller picked up a vibration which built to a painful buzz. She loosened her hand and let it hunt in the swell, trusting the boat for a breath while she glued her eye to the glass.

Bits of the familiar sky blinked out. Then returned. More blinks.

It was almost on top of her when she heard the familiar whisper of twin engines. Had it not been so still, she would have missed it.

“Well, hot damn. Ship 23. Looks like it’ll be a good time in the ol’ town tonight.”

The anomaly passed over, and the air dragged a sudden swirl across the water. Seconds later came a confused chop. Esme threw her weight back against the Tíbar ironwood to keep the bow from broaching.

“To hell with this!”

She snapped the scope shut and popped the pins on the drift-net winch. As soon as she could, she made way for port- partly hoping to catch a glimpse of Ship’s engineer, assuming Ship 23 landed in one piece. One never knows with that heap.

Esme was off-boat before the sky bothered with colors. Good she was back early, because offloading should’ve been easy. It wasn’t. Not because anything was broken.

Esme was... *distracted*.

She stretched time scraping the salt trays. Dragged the smoker into the lane instead of keeping it tucked out back. Sorted the fish. Twice. Anything she could do to have an excuse to stop every few minutes, make a little square with her fingers, and squint at her booth’s new paint job as if it might applaud her back.

Finally, she rolled out the surprise barrel from the day’s haul, a few sulking lobsters who’d been cheated out of a proper fight. She quickly plucked a rust-pike from the snapping mess. “Oh, you! *You* can get bent!” She marched it to the edge, and flung it back into the sea. “Go be crab food.”

On the way back she snatched up four large buckets of deepwater and brought them around front. “Oi, Neeson! What ya think of the new look!?!”

A voice from the empty-looking stall across the way answered back, “I knew if anyone could do something with that old paint, you could, darlin’!”

Esme chuckled. She’d hoped coming back early would mean he wasn’t there. Nothing malicious- she was his friend and all, but somehow the mangy coot beat her here every morning and she hadn’t the faintest clue how.

“I’m gonna beat you one of these days!”

“I hope you do!”

It would have been better if he had said something a bit more competitive. This just meant, or so Esme thought, he didn’t think she ever would.

Her mind drifted. She kept half a thought on beating Neeson, half on the white ventveil fronds from the buckets. She lightly squeezed the brine water from the plants, fingers white with cold that didn’t seem to bother her. Plant only worked if you handled it proper. Get ‘em smoothed out, let ‘em warm slightly and it would sweat a jelly that stayed cold on its own. Had to keep them a touch damp, because if they turned blue, they were done.

An academic regular once told her it was called “*Laminaria Profundis Ventivela*.” Sounded fancy, but most people she knew just called them deepwater cloth. Ventveil, deepwater cloth, ghost wave... Whatever folks wanted to call it- it did the trick, staying cool through the afternoon if you kept the sun off.

Ice cost a fortune in Wade, but deepwater cloths? Free for the taking if you didn’t mind the cold and knew where to dive without extra equipment.

*And to think, I nearly skipped grabbing these.*

Bilber Hallow was a perfect spot for divable deepwater, and one you kept to yourself. Good for a quick morning dip, but it went too thin near four bells. Miss it early and you were stuck running clear past Widow’s Reach for a **deeper drop**. It was just a choice of when you wanted to be cold, how deep you wanted to go, and how soon you wanted to be back.

*Hells. I’d just be pullin’ in from Widow’s Reach.*

Then it all *clicked*.

“Oh! Oh, that’s clever!” she said with a laugh.

“Who is?” Neeson was never there when you looked.

“I am, of course!”

“Course you are, dear!”

*That’s how I’ll beat him! Bilber Hallow. It’s not a bad idea really, if you could catch it before it was full shallow*.

She smoothed the cloths into a base bed for the booth then put up her ‘money-fish’. She staged the three best in a centerpiece: A good-sized Penny-fish Mutton and Grey-Bait-Stealer each flanking a Lead-Belly Landlord. She propped one up with a rolled strip of cloth, just enough tilt to make the scales throw back the morning that was just waking up.

*You could haul anchor early after the holiday tomorrow* *if you have another catch like today.*

To one side she coiled ribbonfish like silver belts, teeth smiling. Squid in a shallow wet-pan up front, smear of ink on the buyer’s side. Salt can and fish balls opposite.

*It could work.*

Everyday fish made up the rest. Sea-Darts on the left. Silver Plates near the front. Knucklers in a bruised pile. Glass-Rain in a shallow tray, Lantern-Fuel beside it, and Scribbles- still twitchy- laid out on the right. She kept a couple of Borrowshark center-back.

*Cut through the hallow on the return, right at Don’t-Get-Greedy Knife before the water turned too thin to float a cork.*

Crabs went into a lidded basket with a stone on top, because crabs had ideas when you let them. The bait shrimp stayed tucked under cloth in the shade, still twitching.

*Double quick back. Fifteen minutes to dock.*

Fish balls at the front. Salt in a tin with a scoop. Smoked redfish strips hanging like flags. Dead center front was some strange creature she accidentally hauled in that looked like melting butter. An eye-catcher for any passerby.

*That’ll shave me*\- she counted on her fingers, “Ten minutes!”

“What’s that?”

“Oh nothing, Neeson! Just chattin’ up these here fish.”

She smiled even larger now, grabbing another handful of the deepwater cloth. She was sure it was a good plan, especially since no fool had been out that way for weeks… not since those damn Qalupalik had shown up. Those merfolk were an absolute nuisance. Clip one and a whole damn swarm would be upon you faster than you can sneeze. Then what? Yer spendin’ the next few days cocooned up somewhere, living out your worst humiliations on a loop.

“Some for you,” she muttered, stuffing a few small strips around random tails. “And some for my poor ole feet.” She dropped a few strips into her water bucket. “And hopefully some for that family.” She took the final few strips and wrapped some of the blue muttons and kingfish she had set aside.

She tidied a few last bits, and stepped back into the lane, almost to Neeson’s booth, and took it all in.

The egg blue interior and the red-and-white checkerboard exterior made it look like an oversized children’s toy. It was stuffed with every fish you’d want in a day.

That grin crept back across her face.

She’d done that.

And it was perfect.

She stomped back over and flipped a hand-scrawled sign that read: **OPEN**.

“Alright, Neeson!” Esmeralda slapped both palms on her counter. “I know you’ve been lurkin’ over there pretendin’ you’re not starin’. Come on over and see the catch of the day! Fresher than a sea breeze at dawn. Got new sea salt ready too, just scraped it off the trays. And look here, Lamp-oil catch! Just like you love.” Esmeralda moved her upturned hands over the crown jewels of her booth. “Redfish smoked to perfection!”

Across the lane, a head rose slow over a stack of folded linen like a suspicious turtle. He moved around front, laying out a choice of exotic fabrics and expertly woven clothes.

“You could sell sand to a beach, Esmeralda.”

“And you could sell shame to a saint, but we don’t bring that up in public. Now really. Tell me what you think of the paint job and the way this is all laid out. Look at that presentation. This here is craft. That’s discipline. That’s...”

“…That’s a crime,” Neeson pointed towards the Butter-blob in the front.

“Oh, don’t you start with me,” Esme laughed. “That’s an eye-catcher. People see that and go, ‘What in Dellia’s tears is that?’ and then they’re already halfway to handin’ me coin.”

Neeson finally pushed off his stall and shuffled over, coat flapping, boots complaining. He leaned in, sniffed it once squinting hard.

“Well, what in the hells is it?”

“No clue. Just caught in the nets.”

“I’ve lived by the sea my entire life and I’m still surprised by what you fisher folk could conjure up. Alright then, let’s get a sample of smoked.”

“Sample?!? HA! If I didn’t love you, you old coot, I’d smack your knuckles with the marlspike for even thinkin’ that word.”

“Love’s a strong claim,” Neeson said, reaching anyway.

Esme swatted his hand, “You want a sample, you buy a strip. This ain’t charity lane.”

“That’s rich,” he muttered, glancing toward Beggar’s Corner. “Heard tale that the whole alley ate fine last night.”

Esme’s grin returned. “Well. It was just a Storms’ Passing gift. A little charity never hurts, ya know.”

“I reckon not. You got plans for feast tomorrow?”

“Dead Horse Inn!”

Neeson made a sound like he’d tasted something sour. “I don’ know why anybody ever goes there. Terrible. Specially on a holiday.”

“Well, I get one full day off a year and I plan to enjoy it. And speaking of time off, we both gotta get ready. So, what’s your- I can’t believe I’m saying this, *sample* gonna be?”

“I knew you were a class act, Esme.”

“I got ribbonfish, squid that’ll still argue with you, knucklers, scribbles, these twitchy little bastards here, an’ a Borrowshark I swear tried to bite me through the net. I’m tellin’ you, Neeson… I got a feelin’. Today’s got bones.”

“I hope so. I need to get some cloth and I can’t afford to go back to Armendale yet. So?”

“Whatever you like Neeson. Just don’ get greedy.”

Neeson looked over the catch as Esme’s eyes landed a glimpse of the uncloaked Ship 23 moored in air dock.

It was a marvelous wreck of a machine that should have been retired seven generations of McGerts ago. Patched and repaired more than her old coat, with twin balloons on adjustable rigging. A throwback to the Fleet’s original days when they were still figuring out which way was up.

Legends enough of the damn thing dropping parts, or people, from more than twenty roofs high. You might get lucky and it wouldn’t smack your boat or gear, but be damned if something like that wouldn’t ruin a few hours of work by spookin’ the fish. One of her too-many-greats-grandmothers called It *a “floatin’ coffin with delusions”* in the family log books, and that was one of the more kind descriptions.

Despite looking as bad up close as it did from a distance, in today’s dawn light the rust and imperfections melted, presenting the ship in all of its majestic glory. Perhaps this clouded reality came from a nostalgic childhood fancies for flying one of those beasties.

Or, perhaps, it was because she had a good view of Durin Boltbreaker.

Her engineer…

He was in deep discussion with Captain Marcus Wrekclaw over the cargo going on board, bending over a barrel to mark it with a black “X”.

*Ten years younger, and I’d have that Boltbreaker over this barrel instead of these damned lobsters!*

She bit her lower lip and sighed. Without turning back to Neeson, she asked, “Where were we?”

Neeson followed her gaze and made that sour sound again. “That heap’s bringin’ trouble again. Heard they’re gonna try to do somethin’ about the Qalupalik. But we’ll see. Bet they’ll just get drunk and burn down another bar.”

“That wasn’t their fault.”

“Says you.”

“And Excuse me? Heap? That’s Fleet. That’s history. That’s...”

“That’s a floating argument,” Neeson cut in. “An’ you’re starin’.”

She snapped around. “I am not!”

“Yes’n ya were.”

“I’m… checkin’... the weather.”

“Mmmm hmmm.” Neeson’s eyes flicked up to the sky. “Weather’s right there. Yer flushed as a rose,” then he tapped the butter-blobfish with one knuckle. “An’ this thing’s judgin’ me. I’ll sample some of the Lampers and since I’m so generous, I’ll buy a smoked.”

Esme laughed and hooked her thumb toward the smoked redfish strips. “Alright then, you miserable fabric goblin. This one here gave me a hell of a fight. I was thinkin’ I’d keep it for myself.”

Neeson leaned in, suddenly serious. “That’s not keepin’,” he said. “That’s braggin’!”",1,1771386142.0,fantasywriting,0,1.0,False

We agreed early on to share basics like milk, coffee/grounds, toilet paper, etc., and take turns replacing them when they run out.
I drink coffee every morning for work (remote half the time), so I usually buy the good instant or grounds + milk. For months he's been finishing my stuff super fast. I'll buy a carton of milk on Sunday, it's gone by Wednesday, same with coffee. He never replaces it; just says ""I'll get it next time"" or ""I thought we were sharing.""
Last month I finally said something: ""Hey, can you pick up milk/coffee this week since you've used most of mine?"" He got defensive, said ""it's not that deep, we're roommates,"" and that I'm being cheap over $5-10 stuff when rent is already $1500+ each.
So I stopped buying shared stuff. Now I keep my coffee/milk in my room (mini fridge in there) and buy only for myself. He’s mad, says the kitchen looks empty, complains there's no milk for his cereal/tea, and told our mutual friend group I'm ""petty and not a team player.""
I feel like if it's shared, it should actually be shared (including replacement). But maybe I'm overreacting since it's cheap stuff and living together means some give-and-take?

Or if anyone has made the assumption that the attractive person you connected with already has enough friends so you never ended up inviting them to anything?

For context, 29M and attractive. There’s no doubt being attractive comes with a lot of advantages. The more attractive candidate is more likely to get the job after the interview, to get the promotion, etc. 

Me personally I think people are generally nicer to me, it’s easy to get a laugh out of them, they lighten up when I talk to them or approach them and I can clearly see that some, mostly girls, even get nervous. It’s the height and the eyes.. they’re strikingly blue. 

So it’s been 2.5 years since I’ve moved to a new city far from home. I’ve met some cool people and made a lot of acquaintances. Like if I ran into any of them somewhere it’d be a nice surprise and we’d catch up for 5 minutes and everything would be good. 

But I never get invited to the group hang or to catch up for a longer period of time over a drink or coffee.

So, yeah. I’m well aware it’s hard making friends these days, period. Especially for adults. 

I’m just curious if anyone’s experienced this even though they clearly connected with others and got on with them well. 

Just going to try and be super proactive moving forward. I know we’re all busy and have our own lives. Would just be nice getting a group together every now and then just to feel like kids again by going to shows or trivia night and stuff.

But I am a bit melancholy.  I really wanted things to work here but its been a disaster from almost day one. I was attracted to the area as a native Kansas girl from my childhood. Particularly on the Kansas side,  it was fairly polished. Good amenities and it lacked the grit of more urban places. Unfortunately, though, it was not enough and I see the errors of my way.

Here's a few random thoughts on things I have noticed.

1. Driving 
This place has more stoplights I've seen per capita than just about anywhere. No matter though. Because when you make a left hand turn, you'll have some clown close enough behind you that you can't see their headlights.  Or driving down Metcalf, why not race around someone so you can be the first at the stop lights mentioned above. Don't even get me started on the number of people who run yellow and yes, red lights. There is zero enforcement from what I have seen.

2. Job market
I knew this was not a financial mecca when I got here but to make zero progress on a job when you have a background in derivatives, option pricing, etc., is really disappointing. Analytical and deductive reasoning skills second to none and if I apply for a job that has a direct link to what I do now, the rejection comes the next day in most cases.

The market has deteriorated since I got here too.

3. Lgbtq life
Simply put, I don't feel welcome. In some places, I feel unsafe.  In an early coffee run when I got here, for example, something had been smeared on the cup where my mouth would go, along with some small hairs.

4. In conclusion 
If you are cis and probably white and are good with a 75k/yr job at the Aspiria campus, love Chiefs/Jayhawks, you're probably in the right spot.

So I'm aware that the title of this post could be any one of many things causing problems and isn't an informative symptom on its own, so I'll try to add some context

I went through my first PC upgrade a couple of months ago, moving from a 500W PSU, a Ryzen 3600, 16GB of RAM, and a Geforce 1660 to the spec list I have posted up above. Kind of my intent was to ride the AM4 platform off into the sunset and get a new mobo, CPU, and windows in the not-too-distant future.

I started off with everything but the GPU, and everything was fine for a month, did the flash BIOS update from ASrock to their newest release for CPU compatibility, etc. I wouldn't say I played anything particularly demanding in that time and I had no issues come up. Then I got the GPU, DDU'd the old drivers, installed the new ones, installed the card, and everything looked promising. I decided to take it for a test drive with that newer Indiana Jones game, which is very demanding. It ran like dog water until I went through the settings and turned off the ray tracing and preset everything to medium, then it ran nicely for a while. 

There comes a point in the beginning of the game where, in the middle of a narrative flashback, a cutscene ends and you retake control as you have to escape a crumbling temple. The PC hard crashed mere seconds into this sequence, complete power loss. Turned it on again, same crash at the exact same time. Turned it on again, reduced all settings to low, and it ran fine (gosh that game still looks beautiful on low settings, doesnt it?), I eventually just stopped playing after an hour or two without incident. I had the adrenaline software open to look for temperature or voltage spikes and couldn't see anything amiss, although I was obviously preoccupied by my need to play the game. In that time since, I've played a lot of enshrouded, stardew, Doom Eternal, and Dead Space Remake, which all ran without incident. the former two are nothing to run, Doom ran like a dream come true, 100% gpu utilization pulling consistent 240+ frames, Dead Space ran... quite warm, it always does, but no performance issues or crashes.  


Flash forward a couple of weeks, I turned on Darksiders Warmastered Edition. This is a fairly old, undemanding game that I have played for hours on my old build without incident. I paused it, made a cup of coffee, and came back five minutes later to see that it had crashed. Christ, really? I wanted to replace the AMD Wraith prism cooler anyway since it was cooking with Dead Space and I wanted to rule out cpu temperatures as the issue, so I ordered a peerless assassin 120 SE and did a swap. The stock AMD paste was a bit chalky and didn't seem to have great, albeit not strictly bad, coverage, so I did the repaste hoping that I would have better coverage. Tried Dead Space again, loyal, faultless Dead Space that never let me down, and I generally saw about a ten degree drop in temperatures at idle. Tried Darksiders again, and it crashed at idle after about an hour of gameplay. CPU temps would spike for a second going between in game levels, but GPU temps were always consistent at around 50 degrees.

At this point I'm fairly hesitant to try any other games because, jesus, this cant be good for my PC. I thought it was only occurring due to the strain of Indiana Jones, but freaking Darksiders? Are you kidding me? I'm ultimately wondering what the checklist would be for diagnosing it before I go running out buying a new PSU under the assumption that this one is faulty. Maybe rolling back to older graphics drivers would help? I'm at a loss, any help is appreciated.",2,1771385256.0,pcgamingtechsupport,2,1.0,False

**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3kcdcy/me_25m_and_my_friend_27m_of_fifteen_years_his_son/)**: September 9, 2015**

I will be calling my friend John, and his son James. I apologize in advance, as some of this will be deliberately vague, for the sake of anonymity.

I'm going to start by answering the question I'm sure you all have. Yes, James was sexually abused. I don't know a whole lot in the way of details, just that he was molested by his biological father when he was younger, over an extended period of time. The authorities stepped in, and John was eventually given custody of James, when James was 9.

I have been a close friend of John for many years, and have grown close to James as well, and even babysat a few times. He's a very kind-hearted, intelligent boy, and in all of our interactions has acted like a normal, happy, healthy young man.

However, this all changed a couple of months ago. James told John that he was gay (this came as no surprise to his father or I; He's not flamboyant, but he has some pretty obviously gay mannerisms). He lamented a lack of friends that he could talk to about this, so John mentioned that I was gay (which is fine, I'm open about it), and asked me if I would talk to James about it if he had any questions. I agreed, and James and I spoke about it at length. He had several questions for me, but none of them struck me as being overly sexual or age-inappropriate. He seemed satisfied with our conversation, and I kind of thought that was the end of it.

The thing is, since James found out that I was gay, his behavior towards me has started to change. I noticed him staring intently at me, only to look away when I looked over at him. He started sitting a little too close to me, but I dismissed this, as he has always been an affectionate kid. At one point, I was heading to the bathroom, which is down a short, narrow hallway that branches off from a larger hallway. He was leaving the bathroom, and as he passed me, he turned away from me, and pressed his butt up against my thighs as he passed. I was a little bit worried, but it is a narrow hallway, and I didn't want to assign sexual behavior to something that could have been completely innocent.

Yesterday, John hopped in the shower, and left James and I alone in the living room. We sat there watching TV and chatting a little, when all of a sudden he reached out and started rubbing my crotch. I jumped back and shouted ""Whoa!"", which I think scared him a little (he doesn't like men yelling). I apologized for scaring him, but told him that that was completely innapropriate behavior, that he should never touch anyone like that, and that it made me uncomfortable. He mumbled an apology, and we sat in silence for a moment before he left to his room. When John came into the living room I made an excuse to go home, and left (I know I should have talked to him then, I'll address that in a moment).

Now obviously I have to talk to his father about this ASAP, but I know that he is sensitive about what happened to his son. How do I approach this delicately? I'm also a little worried that he'll think I'm to blame. I think this is just my imagination running away with me, as John has always been a reasonable man, but I can't deny that the worry is there. Do you think that this will ruin our friendship? It would break my heart to cut ties with them, as John has always been a close friend, and I would miss James too. I like the little dude. They're like family to me, but I don't want to inhibit James's healing process. Should I cut ties regardless?

**To sexual abuse victims, or those who work with sexual abuse victims:** I would greatly appreciate some insight into the kid's mindset. Why is he doing this? Is there any likelihood that he is doing this to anyone else, like kids his own age? Does he know that what he's doing is wrong, or does he genuinely not understand that this behavior is inappropriate and uncomfortable? I'd like to talk to him about this at some point, but I'd really like to be able to understand more about what he's going through first, and to be honest, I have no clue how to relate to what happened to him.

**Final Note:** I know that some of you will be angry that I did not speak to John sooner about all of this. I understand. Your anger is justified. To be honest, I'm angry with myself. I should have gone to John immediately, instead of rationalizing James's behavior away. It wasn't until after he groped me that I realized this was an escalating pattern of inappropriate behavior, but I know that's no excuse. I saw the red flags but chose to ignore them, and in doing so I have done a disservice to James and his family. I take full responsibility for that. So to those of you who are angry with me, I'm sorry.

**tl;dr**: 11 year old boy groped me. How do I approach his father about this?

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

**Doughchild:** Does James have a therapist? Sexual abuse can have some terrible consequences. One is having a skewed idea of affection. You are likely someone James somewhat trusts and considers as a friend. And where others might try to impress with sports skills or showing off a great collection of interest, James might resort easier to showing affection by giving out sexual favors. He doesn't know better and boundaries are harder to figure out in that context. Which is why he needs therapy. \[...\]

You should talk to John. Explain you're worried. Be very clear you consider James a child and that this is abnormal and worrying behaviour. Do tell him you won't be able to babysit for a while, at least til James infatuation with you has passed. You're the adult, you have to take precautions. John might not like it, but this won't be the only incident of James doing something that might get him in trouble.

>**OOP:** I believe that James is seeing a therapist, or at least was seeing a therapist some time ago. I don't know if he still is, but I will be sure to bring this up to John. I'm sure that he will understand that I'm not comfortable being alone around his son for the time being, for both of our sakes.  
And yeah, you're right. James is definitely not the sporty type. He's a bookworm, and is pretty shy around strangers. I know he has some school friends, but I don't think he has any close friendships with his peers, at least AFAIK. He reminds me a little of myself at that age, which may explain why we bonded so easily.

**Thanmandrathor:** I doubt John can fault you for not bringing things up sooner, only now with the groping does the rest of the behavior gain a lot of context that puts it in the ""holy shit"" category. Nobody expects this from an 11 year old, so it wouldn't be the first thing you read into an odd brushing of limbs in a hallway or a lingering look.

>**OOP:** Thanks. It's reassuring to hear that I wasn't wrong to brush off his earlier behavior as being non-sexual, but I guess I've been trapped in my own little echo-chamber telling me that I should've realized something was wrong from the start.

**kamikaze\_goldfish:** Everyone else has good advice, I'd just like to say thank god the kid came on to you. He could easily have been taken advantage of by another pedophile, specially if that person was in a position of power, or someone he admired. \[...\]

>**OOP:** Wow, that's a good point. I never thought of that. That's terrifying to think.  
I will absolutely be speaking to John. Even without James's past history this behavior would be concerning.

*Doughchild left a longer, more nuanced comment* [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3kcdcy/comment/cuwuvqm/?context=3) *that OOP references in the update:*

>Wow, thank you. That's a really well thought out reply. It breaks my heart to think that that's how he sees himself, but what you're saying does make sense. He does seem to crave approval from me and his father, but I hadn't really considered that he might think so little of himself.

**eccentricgiraffe:** \[...\] When you talk to John, ask him to expand on how you said to never touch someone like that. Obviously, two consenting adults *do* want to touch each other like that. You want to head off the idea that sexual urges are bad and should never be acted on.

>**OOP:** That's a good point, and probably how I should have phrased it, I was just in a bit of a panic at the time. But yes, I'll explain that to him the next time I talk to him.

*To another, nuanced* [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3kcdcy/comment/cuxa0n8/?context=3):

>I think you may be onto something with this. Part of my confusion, now that I give it some thought, is the fact that he has never been flirtatious toward me. That would make sense, if he figured that he owed me sexual favors, but didn't particularly want to make good on it.  
Thanks for your input. It really helps to get feedback from people who have been through similar situations. For what it's worth, I'm sorry for what happened to you, and I hope you are doing well now.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3ktw49/update_me_25m_and_my_friend_27m_of_fifteen_years/)**: September 13, 2015 (4 days later)**

Thank you all for your comments, I really appreciate it.

I apologize if any of this seems rambling or disjointed, but I just got back, and I want to write all this down before I forget.

I called John today, and told him that I would like to talk to him alone. He invited me over, and we talked over coffee.

When I told him what had happened with his son, he seemed shocked, but he took it well. He said that he was surprised, as James had not been displaying anything in the way of sexually inappropriate behavior, though he did admit he had been told that James acting out sexually was a possibility, so it wasn't entirely unexpected.

He said that he wished I had come forward after the hallway incident, but that he understood why I had brushed it off, and didn't hold it against me. He's just glad that I came forward and told him the truth. I was visibly upset, so I'm sure he could tell how deeply this was affecting me. I asked him if he wanted me to cut ties with them, temporarily or permanently, but he said absolutely not. He believes that it's important for James to have a gay role model in his life, and felt that not having me around would come across as punitive and shaming to James, and would end up doing more harm than good. He confirmed to me that James is seeing a therapist, but that they were down to monthly visits, as James had seemed to be adjusting well. John said that he was going to go back to weekly visits in light of his behavior. He asked me to stick around until James got home.

When James arrived, John said that he wanted to talk to him about what had happened between James and I. James looked extremely guilty, and started tearing up. After John reiterated what had happened and asked if he had anything he'd like to say, James broke down crying and saying how sorry he was. We both reassured him that we weren't angry with him, and that he wasn't in any trouble, but that he needed to understand that this behavior was inappropriate, and why. As per the suggestion of several of the comments, I apologized for saying he should never touch anyone the way he did, and we discussed the issue of consent at length. John then asked him why he did what he did.

James talked a lot about it, but was rambling nervously. I get the feeling that he was sorting it out in his head as he was talking, so it was a little difficult to follow, but I'll paraphrase what he said, as I understand it.

He confirmed for us that he had not done this with anyone else. He has had a brief crush or two on other boys at school, but was self-aware enough to know that they were straight, and not interested in him romantically. He admitted that he did have a little bit of a crush on me as well, but assumed that I was straight.

However, when he found out that I was gay, he mistook my affection for him as attraction, and came to the conclusion that I was only friendly with him because I wanted him sexually. John asked him if he acted the way he had because he wanted to have sex with me. James said no, but that he thought that if he didn't repay my affection with sexual acts that I wouldn't want to be his friend anymore. He also expressed some concern that if he didn't initiate it I would, and that he'd rather do it on his terms. I told him that sex was never any part of my intentions, and that I was friends with him because he was nice, that I enjoyed talking to him and hanging out with him, that I like him because of who he is as a person. He asked if he was ugly. I said no, and explained that most people are attracted to people close to their own age. He admitted that if he were to have a boyfriend that he'd want a boyfriend his age.

We started wrapping things up, but I noticed James seemed dejected. I asked him what was wrong. He asked me if I hated him now. I admit I got a little choked up when he said that. I gave him a big hug and told him that I would never hate him, and that I would always be his friend. He asked if we would still get to hang out, and I said yes, but only when his father was home, and that I wouldn't be able to babysit for him for awhile. John made sure he understood that this was not a punishment, just a precaution. James seemed agreeable to it.

At this point, John said he had some things he wanted to discuss with James privately, so we said our goodbyes, and I left.

All in all I feel pretty good about it. I think we were able to explain things to James in a way that he understood. I hope I handled this the right way.

I'd like to wrap this up by thanking everyone for their comments, but especially [u/Doughchild](https://www.reddit.com/user/Doughchild/) for their heartbreaking, but very insightful comments in [this thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3kcdcy/me_25m_and_my_friend_27m_of_fifteen_years_his_son/cuwe8kq) I read it again just now, and started crying, because I was struck by how much of that I saw in James. Thank you for helping me understand.

**tl;dr**: The poor kid thought that if he didn't sleep with me, I wouldn't want to be his friend anymore. I think I helped him understand that that's not the case. Supervised visits, and no babysitting for the foreseeable future.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

**Sykeon:** (top comment) You guys need some type of award for how your handling this.

That boy is going to grow up to be SO well adjusted.

Thanks for the update and keep it up!

>**OOP:** Aw, thanks! I thought it went well, but it really helps to have some reassurance from someone who is removed from the situation.

**filconomics:** Reading where that kid's head was at is heartbreaking. How could someone take advantage of someone so vulnerable? He's really lucky to have you two as positive forces in his life.

>**OOP:** I'm just glad we can be there for him.  
I don't know how anyone could do that. Doing that to anyone is bad enough, but your own child? I can't even comprehend that level of depravity.

*To another commenter:*

>Thank you very much!  
I'm glad that I can be there to support James. I never had a gay role model growing up, so I was pretty repressed for most of my life. I'm glad he doesn't have to go through that.

*To another, longer* [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3ktw49/comment/cv0mhm7/?context=3) *of someone sharing their own story:*

>I'm tearing up just reading this. I'm so sorry for what happened to you.  
I know a little more about this now than when I started, but even then I never blamed him. I knew that he was only acting out like that because he was confused. He's dealing with things he's far too young to understand.  
I'm sorry that your parents didn't provide you the help and support that you needed. I'm no expert, and I can't offer much, but if you ever need someone to listen, you're welcome to PM me.

**cancer\_girl:** Out of curiosity - why is it that you guys decided, that you shouldn't babysit him anymore or be alone around him? Is it because you are feeling uncomfortable? Or are worried that your friend might doubt the nature of the interactions with the son?

>**OOP:** Thanks!  
It's not a permanent thing. He just wants to make sure that James is able to talk to a therapist first.  
I'm a little bit worried, but I doubt it's going to happen again.  
I think we're both more worried about James honestly, because doing it again would likely cause him to feel guilty and shameful all over again. John didn't actually say that, but I have a feeling we're on the same page in that regard.  
I was worried that John would hold me partially responsible, but he has made it clear that I've given him no reason not to trust me, so that's not an issue for us.

**Iamaredditlady:** I'm just curious, who was John to James before the custody?

>**OOP:** Unfortunately, I'm going to have to be a little vague on this, for the sake of anonymity, but I will say that John and James are related, but not immediate family. This is partly why John was able to adopt James, because, as I understand it, in our state there is a law requiring them to give adoption preferences to relatives. (I hope I worded that okay.)

Is this platonic or am I dense?,"I (M23) turned 23 this past Valentine's Day (Feb 14). I know I’m an adult, but I feel completely clueless right now. It has been 4 days since this happened and it is still bugging me, so I need an unbiased perspective.The photo shows the gifts my female friend gave me. She isn't my girlfriend - she is just a ""diamond-tier"" friend to me. I have never shown her any signs of romantic love (I care for her deeply, but I don't love her like that).
I grew up with only my mom and 3 sisters, so I am ""hardwired"" to be a caretaker. My way of showing care is what people call ""Princess Treatment"" whenever I’m with her, I make sure she is well-fed, hydrated, and comfortable. To me, that isn't flirting  it's just how you treat the people you value.
I invited her to Starbucks just to catch up because I had a free birthday coffee voucher. I showed up with a simple bouquet of white roses (with pink tints).She showed up with all of this
I didn't think her writing ""Cutie"" on the card was serious because I always call her 'Her Highness' and she calls me by whatever name was in her mind at that moment. But looking at the sheer effort and cost of these gifts, I am spiraling.
Is this just a platonic friend gesture?
Is it pity because I'm usually the one taking care of others?
Or does she actually like me ?
If she actually likes me it will be problematic cause i don't want to be in a relationship for now i want to build a solid career before even thinking about getting in a relationship and rejecting her will kill the friendship dynamics that we currently have. i don't want to hurt her i can't see her sad because of me and if I am overthinking it and it's indeed a friendly gesture then i don't want to look like a desperate idiot who misunderstood her kindness. I want to address her properly i don't want to make it awkward it's been already 4 days without any interaction with her.
I felt so indebted in that moment that I immediately bought her a midi dress just to balance the scales.

For sale, I have a Behmor 1600 home coffee roaster. It has been upgraded with the official AB Plus kit (new panel, board and motor), effectively upgrading the unit to the AB Plus model.

This roaster has served me well, but I haven’t had time to use it anymore, so I’m letting it go. Works as well as the day I got it (it’s a very reliable machine).

I removed the flap at the top of the chaff collector tray, because sometimes it would hit the drum, but I’ll include it if you want to add it back (although I found it doesn’t really help in any meaningful way). It’s in great shape and only has some minor cosmetic imperfections. I used a small wire to reattach one of the drum fins and works well, and as you can see in the photos (my cat got ahold of the power cord but it’s only cosmetic and didn’t puncture the wire).

Shoot me an offer. I have it on eBay for $350

I finally received my Biatelli Moka Express (3 cup variant) today and I’m planning to start brewing with it from tomorrow. I’ve only ever had instant coffee so far (Davidoff decaf mostly), so this is my first time using ground coffee / moka brewing.



I usually drink my coffee with a lot of milk (200 to 250 ml), and I prefer a chocolatey, smooth flavour rather than fruity or acidic profiles. After lurking around the sub for a while, I've decided to go with a Vienna Dark Roast from Third wave coffee for now. 



One important thing: I’m a GERD patient, so I generally stick to lower caffeine and lower acidity coffees. I can handle small amounts of regular-caffeinated coffee occasionally, but I’d still prefer gentler options if possible. I've always had coffee only for the taste, I never really feel the ""kick"" or caffeine rush after drinking regular coffee.



So, I wanted recommendations on:

• Good decaf coffees for moka pot available in India (Pune)  
• Chocolatey/nutty flavour profiles that work well with milk  
• Medium-dark to dark roast suggestions  
• Beginner-friendly picks (since I’m new to brewing)  
• And if there are decaf options with similar chocolatey / Vienna-style taste, please suggest those too

1r7ruk5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1r7ruk5/whats_your_experience_with_rejection_and/,What's your experience with rejection and experiencing avoidance afterwards ?,"I’m looking for honest advice because I feel like I might be getting traumatized from too much rejection.

Earlier this semester there was a girl I kept seeing at my university library. We studied on the same floor pretty often and sometimes sat near each other. After seeing her around for a while, I finally said hi and we had a short conversation. She smiled and seemed shy, but it wasn’t clearly flirty, so I wasn’t sure how to read it.

At one point I ended up talking to her friend when she stepped away. I admitted I wanted to ask her out and didn’t really know how to ask her out. The conversation felt calm and normal, and her friend mentioned she wasn’t seeing anyone.

About a month ago, feeling unsure what to do, I gave her friend a short note to pass along that basically said I’d love to take her out for coffee and to text me if she was interested. I know it probably would’ve been better to give it to her directly, but I froze in the moment. I never got a response.

After that, things started feeling different. When I saw the girl again, she avoided eye contact and stayed very close to her friends. At one point it even looked like she positioned herself behind her friend when I was nearby. I noticed quick glances away and what looked like nervous body language. Over time I started seeing her less and less in the library, and eventually I stopped seeing her there entirely.

Since then I’ve had a couple awkward moments running into her friend in the library where we made eye contact and I ended up walking the other direction because I didn’t want to make things more uncomfortable. Nothing dramatic happened, but I’ve felt embarrassed and self-conscious about it.

Now I don’t see the girl at the library at all anymore. I don’t know if she changed study spots, changed schedules, or if this is related to me. I’ve given space and haven’t tried to approach her again.

Does this sound like I made her uncomfortable, or is this just how shy or unsure people sometimes react when someone expresses interest? Was using the friend instead of asking her directly a bigger mistake than I realize? And am I overreacting by assuming her absence is about me?

I’m not trying to force anything or chase her. I just want to understand what I could have handled better so I don’t repeat the same mistakes in the future",2,1771384836.0,CPTSD,2,1.0,False

Me (31M) and my girlfriend (22F) have been in a relationship for coming up to 2 years now. Although the first 6 or so months were very rocky with some arguments and misunderstandings, we have adapted very well to each others communicatio style and now we communicate well when needed. As of recent we haven't had any big or small issues in the relationship and have been in a really good place.

  
About a month ago, she asked me if i remember her french friend to which i replied no. She had never mentioned any french friend to me not have i ever met any of her friends who is french ( we both live in south east asia). Anyway she told me that he had just arrived at the country we live in and had asked to meet up with her. She also mentioned that the guy has a GF who would be moving to live with him the following month to maybe put my mind at ease about them meeting each other. After asking me if i was okay with them meeting up I immediately told her that i'm not okay with that because I dont know who this person is and in 2 years you've never mentioned him to me. She told me that the guy was very much a platonic friend and they had met less than 5 times before but he's a ""good guy"". Again I told her that i'm not okay with that but it's up to you because I cant force you to do something. I was just hoping she would make the right decision and not see him but she told me she would think about it.

  
About a week ago she tells me that she would go and see the french guy on the sunday of that week at 3pm. Following that she sent me a screenshot of their conversation. In the conversation she asked if his GF would be joining them at the meeting to which he replied ""After a few complicated months i decided to stop the relationship. I would prefer to talk about it with you Sunday, not by text"". (How fucking convinient??). This is the 3rd time now where i tell her I'm not okay with it and I dont trust it for the following reasons: 

1. You don't talk often

2. You've never mentioned him. I dont even have a name or how you met 

3. He told you that his GF would be joining him in the country the following month but the weekend you're supposed to be meeting, all of a sudden he decided to stop the relationship.

  
She said she doubted him a little bit but maybe it could be true. Again i have to reiterate that i can't force her to do anything, she can make her own decisions but i've told her my boundary. I'm not okay with it but be careful. So her plans are confirmed to meet the guy. 

The day comes and she tells me that the plan is just to go to the park in the city and hangout, further telling me that because of this plan it's not that weird for them to be meeting up. She also told me on the day that she lowkey doesn;t want to go and meet him but she's a people pleaser so she has to go. She tells me she will send me pics. 

  
She meets him at a coffee shop first and takes a picture to confirm that she is there with him. A few hours later she tells me she is at the park with him. An hour later she texts me that we should go to the park the following week because it's ""really romantic"" which really pissed me off because why are you there with another guy? A few hours later she tells me she's gonna eat and go home. I'm trying to keep cool but i'm pretty annoyed because the way she phrased the meeting was like they were just going to hang at the park, but now there's all these extra plans.  But then an hour later she tells me she's gonna go to a jazz bar with him and she'll go home at midnight. At this point i'm pissed because now you're basically on a date with this guy. 

  
I'm told her to text me when she gets home so I know that she's safe to which she said okay. After not hearing from her at midnight, I tried calling her at 00:40 am beacuse at this point I dont know where she is or who she is with and i'm worried. 3 calls and 2 texts later I still couldn't reach her. I didn't get a reply from her until 01:15 am telling me her phone had died and that she just got back. 

  
I asked her if she was drunk but she told me she only had two beers and wasn't drunk. When asked why shes coming home so late, she said ""because he wanted to walk around after we left the bar"". Why didn't she just go home? Why didn't she just say no? She followed up with a lot of apologies but I wasn't ready to speak to her so I told her i'll speak to her the following day when i feel less annoyed. 

The following day she sends me a long apology message saying how she understands why I feel the way i feel. This was the followed by another message saying she thinks we should break up because she felt like she cheated and felt like she had some sort of feeling for him which they met.

I have not decided whether to wait for a double boiler a few more years or just get a single boiler machine. I usually drink around 1 or 2 filter coffees in the morning and around 2 milk drinks (cappuccino/flat white) in the afternoon.

The filter coffee might be changed into americanos when having an espresso machine.

I've been undecided for at least 2 years now. At the moment I've thinking of the Gaggia Classic Pro E24 since I know that it can be later on modified with Gaggiuino/Gaggimate which has everything I want.

There is no issue with modifying it but at the same time the more streamlined a machine without having to do it myself would be better.

I've seen the Quick Mill Pop Up (Lucca Tempo) as another option.

I believe both machines will work out well but I am concerned with the longevity of the Gaggia when modifying it. Also I have not seen many long-term reviews of the Quick Mill Pop Up (Lucca Tempo).

1r7rony,https://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/1r7rony/cartier_santos_dumont_first_luxury_watch/,[Cartier Santos Dumont] - First luxury watch,"Hey everyone,

I’m currently at a crossroads and could use some perspective. I’ve been on the ""list"" for a Datejust at my local AD for almost a year now. After another ""keep waiting"" check-in this week, I’m seriously considering pulling the plug on that dream and going in a completely different direction: the Cartier Santos Dumont (Large).

The Context:

I work at a big bank, and to say the environment is Rolex-heavy is an understatement. I see the Submariner in every meeting and at every coffee run. I personally don’t like the Sub aesthetic. I want something classic but with more elegance. The Santos Dumont feels much more refined for the office without being a total snooze-fest.

The Fitness Factor:

Here’s my main hesitation: I’m heavily into fitness and health tracking. I wear Apple Watch currently for the data. Since this would be my first luxury watch, I’m trying to figure out if it’s worth the jump if I’m still going to want my fitness stats.

A few questions for the owners:

1. The Apple Watch Dilemma: For those of you who love your fitness data, how do you handle adding a Cartier to the mix? Do you double-wrist or do you find yourself leaving the Cartier in the box more than you’d like?

2. The Size: I’m leaning toward the Large. For those with a similar wrist size (mine is 6 inches), how does the square case wear daily compared to the round watches I see everywhere at the bank?

3. Durability & Straps: Since this is a first luxury piece, am I going to regret the leather strap for daily wear compared to a bracelet, especially if I'm coming from the rubber/sport bands of an Apple Watch?

4. The Movement: The Large is high-autonomy quartz. Did you feel like you missed out not having a mechanical movement, or is the grab-and-go convenience actually a plus?

I’m really close to just heading to the Cartier boutique this weekend and ending the AD games. Is the Dumont a solid choice, or will the Apple Watch eventually win out?

We work together. For months it’s been flirty and physical. Light. Casual. Fun. Mostly hookups and tension. Nothing emotional.

Then we had a night that felt different. It wasn’t just sex. It was slow kissing, hand holding, cuddling. He seemed more nervous than usual. More gentle. More intentional. It felt softer.

The very next week at work he completely shifted.

He kept his distance. Way more serious. Less eye contact. He would look at me but with this serious expression and then look away. Very professional. No subtle touchy stuff when we were alone like before. It felt controlled. He was completely normal with all the other coworkers. The shift was only towards me. And it was obvious to everyone.

But here’s the confusing part, that same week we actually texted more than we usually do. He’s normally kind of dry over text, but he was more responsive than usual. He also still bought me coffee.

Now this week he’s back to being flirty at work like normal.

So what was that?

Was that a guy catching feelings and needing a second to process? Was that him thinking I caught feelings? Was he trying to create distance and then changed his mind? Or am I overanalyzing a normal mood fluctuation?

The shift happened immediately after that intimate night, which is why it feels connected. I’m not planning to confront him.

Googled Muncie warehousess and other weird stuff. Asked Alexa weather for five cities. Reran analysis at 3 AM. Score fell to 0.05. System labeled it predictable chaos matching old engagement farm protiles.

HR called me in this morning. They know about the anomaly ticket and side dashboard use. Asked if I shared proprietary patterns or client data externally. Said my Reddit account triggered internal keyword flags (anomaly, entropy, dwell time). VPN logs show me querying retail streams off hours.

NDA violation review starts tomorrow. Cant discuss specifics or show screenshots. They pulled my full access already. I am worried about my pay coming up today too. Rent due Friday.

Slipped into work early today. Main access locked since the anomaly ticket but side dashboard still works with basic dbt models and Snowflake queries. Anonymized my personal logs and ran same entropy checks, variance tests, session complexity from the retail audit. Coffee went cold waiting for output.

My patterns flagged low organic. Entropy score 0.08 (humans usually 0.23 plus). Scroll loops averaged two minutes across tabs. Reddit logins hit every fourteen minutes on average. Phone sessions clocked one minute twenty before sleep. YouTube stuck to three click paths. Basicly matched the ghost clusters. I also Tried forcing chaos last night. Wikipedia on random topics, cat videos, argued in dead threads. Googled Muncie warehousess and other weird stuff. Asked Alexa weather for five cities. Reran analysis at 3 AM. Score fell to 0.05. System labeled it predictable chaos matching old engagement farm profiles.

HR called me in this morning. They know about the anomaly ticket and side dashboard use. Asked if I shared proprietary patterns or client data externally. Said my Reddit account triggered internal keyword flags (anomaly, entropy, dwell time). VPN logs show me querying retail streams off hours.

We're all out here posting our ""morning routines,"" our gym selfies, our hustle culture quotes, but when it comes to actual results? Crickets. We're flexing before we've built anything real. And look, I get it. I've spent years researching productivity psychology, reading everything from Cal Newport to behavioural economics studies, and here's what I found: we're wired to crave validation now, not later. Social media turned us into performance artists instead of builders. But the people who actually win? They shut the hell up and build first.

Step 1: Understand the Validation Trap

Here's the science: When you tell people about your goals, your brain releases dopamine. The same chemical you'd get from actually achieving the goal. Studies from NYU's Psychology Department show that when you announce your intentions, your brain mistakes the talking for doing. You get a premature sense of accomplishment, which kills your motivation to actually follow through.

This is called social reality. The more you talk about what you're going to do, the less likely you are to actually do it. Your brain already got its reward. Game over.

The fix? Shut up about your goals. Seriously. Stop posting about the business you're ""about to start"" or the book you're ""going to write."" Just start building in silence. Let your results do the talking later.

Step 2: Delete the Audience from Your Process

Right now, you're probably creating for an audience instead of creating for results. Every decision you make is filtered through ""what will people think?"" instead of ""does this actually move me forward?""

This is productivity poison. When you're constantly performing, you're optimising for appearance rather than effectiveness. You choose the aesthetic workspace over the functional one. You spend 3 hours on a perfect Instagram story about your progress instead of actually progressing.

Try this: Treat the next 90 days like a blackout period. No posting about what you're working on. No sharing your journey. Just pure, unfiltered building. The people who need to know will find out when you're done.

Step 3: Embrace Ugly Progress

You want to know why most people never finish anything? Because they're waiting for it to be Instagram-ready before they move forward. They need the perfect setup, the perfect plan, the flawless execution. 

Newsflash: All real progress is ugly as hell at first.

The first draft of your book? Garbage. The beta version of your app? Buggy mess. Your first business attempt? Probably going to fail. And that's exactly how it should be. James Clear talks about this in Atomic Habits, which sold over 15 million copies and won him recognition as one of the world's leading experts on behaviour change. He breaks down how small, consistent actions compound into massive results. But here's the part everyone skips: those early actions look pathetic. They're embarrassing. They're not flex-worthy.

That's the point. You're not building to impress people in month one. You're building so that by month twelve, you have something undeniable.

Step 4: Track Private Wins

Just because you're not posting doesn't mean you're not tracking. Get yourself a system. Notion works great for tracking every single tiny win. Wrote 500 words today? Logged. Made one cold call that went nowhere? Logged. Learned one new skill? Logged.

These private wins are your fuel. They remind you that you're actually moving when it feels like nothing's happening. And here's the kicker: when you track privately, you're accountable to yourself, not your audience. That's real accountability.

Another solid option is Structured (formerly Day One), a habit tracking app that helps you build consistency without the social media circus. No likes, no comments, just you and your progress.

For those wanting deeper insights into productivity psychology without the fluff, there's BeFreed, an AI-powered learning app built by a team from Columbia and Google. Type in something specific like ""overcome procrastination as a perfectionist"", and it generates a personalised learning plan pulling from productivity books, behavioural science research, and expert insights. 

The depth customisation is clutch, you can toggle between a 10-minute overview or a 40-minute deep dive with examples when something really clicks. The voice options make it addictive, too; there's even a sarcastic narrator that makes dense psychology research way more digestible during commutes or gym sessions. Worth checking out if traditional reading feels like another chore on the to-do list.

Step 5: Steal from the Stoics

Marcus Aurelius, the Roman Emperor and Stoic philosopher, kept journals that became one of history's most influential texts, Meditations. You know what he wrote about? Not about impressing people. About doing the work regardless of recognition. About focusing on what you control and ignoring everything else.

He wrote: ""Waste no more time arguing what a good man should be. Be one.""

Translation? Stop performing goodness, success, productivity, whatever. Just be those things. In private. Without an audience.

Ryan Holiday's Ego is the Enemy breaks this down brilliantly. Holiday worked with everyone from Tim Ferriss to Robert Greene, and his book became a modern classic on why ego destroys potential. He shows how the most successful people in history did their best work in obscurity. They built empires before anyone knew their names. This book will kick your ass if you're addicted to validation. Insanely good read.

Step 6: Front-Load the Suffering

Here's brutal honesty: Building is boring. It's repetitive. It's unsexy. You're doing the same thing over and over, making tiny improvements, with no applause, no recognition, no external reward.

Most people can't handle this. They need the dopamine hits from likes and comments to keep going. But if you can front-load the suffering, if you can push through the boring building phase without any validation, you win.

The Boring Phase is Your Moat. It's what separates you from the 99% who quit because nobody's watching. Do the boring work. Embrace it. Love it. Because on the other side of boring is irreplaceable.

Step 7: Build Systems That Don't Need Motivation

Motivation is bullshit. It comes and goes. You can't build anything real on motivation alone. You need systems.

BJ Fogg's Tiny Habits revolutionised behaviour science. The Stanford professor spent 20 years researching behaviour change, and his book distils it into a simple formula: make it tiny, make it easy, celebrate immediately. This is how you build systems that run automatically, regardless of how you feel.

For example, don't rely on motivation to write every day. Instead, create a system: every morning, after your first coffee, you write for 10 minutes. That's it. The system doesn't care if you're motivated. It just happens.

Step 8: Delayed Gratification is Your Superpower

We live in an instant gratification world. Everyone wants results yesterday. But the most valuable things in life require delayed gratification. The ability to do the work now and get rewarded later.

This is the literal definition of building first, flexing later. You're trading short-term validation for long-term success. And the beautiful part? Most people can't do this. Which means if you can, you're already ahead.

Research from Walter Mischel's famous ""marshmallow test"" at Stanford showed that kids who could delay gratification ended up more successful as adults. The same principle applies here. The longer you can go without external validation, the bigger your eventual payoff.

Step 9: Let Results Speak

When you finally do finish building, when you finally have something real to show, you won't need to flex. People will notice automatically. Your results will do the marketing for you.

There's a famous quote: ""Work so hard that people think you're lucky."" That's the energy. You put in years of invisible work, and then suddenly you're an ""overnight success."" People don't see the building. They only see the flex at the end. And that's exactly how it should be.

Step 10: Remember Why You Started

At some point, you wanted to build something because it mattered to you. Not because of likes, followers, or validation. You had a vision. You wanted to create something meaningful.

Go back to that. Strip away the performance. Strip away the audience. Get back to the pure reason you started.

Build first. Flex later. Not because flexing is bad, but because premature flexing kills the build. Do the work in silence. Let your results make the noise.",1,1771383930.0,TheIronCouncil,0,1.0,False

I’ve been taking Adderall for over a decade. I’m going cold turkey. I’ve taken anywhere between 30mg to 15mg throughout those years. I’ve been feeling that Adderall doesn’t work the same for me anymore… 



I just feel like I’m out of body and not in tune with myself. Like I’m just surviving. I don’t enjoy doing anything. I don’t have very many hobbies at all. I have no personality when I’m on Adderall. Now that I’m off, I feel like my spark is coming back but with that NOW I’m seeing more negative side effects from the withdrawal. (Quite forgetful/ A bit harder to focus when being given instruction  overall a little all over the place, which I’ll take because I’d rather be myself than a robot) Little deppessed a bit anxious and a huge increase in appetite. i’ve also been drinking 2 to 3 cups of coffee a day to cope LOL. 

As someone who has been heavier and also had anorexia, an increase in appetite is extremely uncomfortable. I wouldn’t say eating an unhealthy amount, but my new eating habits aren’t very good. I’m just scared that this specific symptom won’t get any better… as I’m on about day 8. 

I seem that supplements can help with ADHD symptoms. i have supplements such as raw zinc, magnesium, glycinate, vitamin C, vitamin D3, vitamin K2, raw B complex, creatine. I stopped taking them consistently, especially magnesium because I’ve been told it interferes with Adderall.

I’m really just kind of all over the place with this post, but omg I just hope someone y’all can relate and share some similar struggles or advice that will be extremely helpful. Thank uuuu😅😰

Yet...something doesn't feel right for the gunslinger after meeting her for the first time.,"Basically, this was an idea I had for the parentage of Mei Hatsume in a different light. Instead of having some rich parents or somehow related to Power Loader (seen a couple of those fanfics and they are pretty good honestly) but I had a different idea.

When Mei went over to U.A., she hadn't expected to know anything about her past. Growing up in the orphanage meant that she had to work twice as hard to get the scholarships necessary to get that cool place where she could build anything!

However...I'm thinking that this is where canon will deviate, probably in the beginning of the story. Mei will be making stuff in the lab and modifies something that she's had since a kid. Some old pistol that the caretakers there never let her have for ""safety reasons."" Now that she has it, she's been modifying it to make it a new and improved baby.

That's when someone enters the support lab. One of the teachers here at U.A., Snipe. The cowboy is looking for Power Loader, needing to talk to him about some kind of lesson plan or another thing. He encounters the most troublesome student of this class, as Majima has vented to him over drinks from time to time. 

“Hey there partner…Hatsume right?”

“Huh? Oh! Snipe-Sensei! You’re just the guy I need!”

“Wha-” Before he can respond he’s dragged over to her little desk and where she's making stuff. Now Snipe doesn't quite understand all the logistics of what she’s talking about, but can see that she has a lot of passion as she goes over how she creates these things. But then he’s distracted by the gun on her desk. 

It was his.

Or…an older version of his pistol, that is. He hadn’t used those kinds for a long time now…but it WAS his, on this girl’s table, being taken apart and modified to look…more effective? If that was a good word for it? The regular barrel looked streamlined with some pieces of metal on it. SHe mentioned she added little bits of tech to make the gun TRULY silenced, and that it could double as a type of sniper-pistol for those needing a weapon. Impressive. 

That explanation led to him asking about it, interrupting her stream of words.  

“Oh the gun?” She moved her goggles out of her face. Her eyes…huh…kinda looked familiar…their green-yellow irises bringing back a small memory…nah he was just feeling weird today. That was all. Darn kids get his heart all mushy with their innocent eyes and all.

“Had it since I was a kid! Don’t know who gave it to me and all, but the caretakers at the orphanage told me it was with me when I was dropped off. Guess the last one that had me REALLY like America!” 

“...Could I see the back of that gun real quick, girlie?”

“Huh? Uh…sure. I haven’t removed the casing yet, was gonna, but of course you can look sensei! I’ll need your gun-crazy mind to see if its effective enough so far,”

So Snipe does. He looks over the gun, more so the parts Hatsume hadn’t modified yet. On the bottom of the handle, he found something he couldn't believe.

S ♥ N

He said nothing. Merely testing the gun when Hatsume asked. He noticed a few things then. Her muscles, the hard hands she had, the way she held a gun so perfectly, and her hair, braided and pink. Her quirk as well, Zoom. 

It had to be a weird coincidence right? But…the gun.

So from this point Snipe visits on some occasions, using the excuse of needing modifications on his guns or some gear. Majima, Power Loader, of course noticed. The explanation was…awkward to say the least.

============================= 

“I just don' t know how she got this shooter a’ mine Majima. It can’t be… ‘sides if its true then her momma could only be-”

“I think you're being a little dramatic Snipe, but I can see why you would be.” Majima said, taking a quick drink of his coffee.

“Honestly if she is, it would make some sense considering her…personality. But even if it isnt true, it couldn't hurt to have someone keeping her grounded, which thankfully, you kinda appear to be. Grounding her, I mean.”

“Well…maybe I’m just getting old too, eh? Like the old-”

“Like the old west. You say that every birthday man,” both of them laughed at that joke, but Snipe kept the idea in mind.

========================

Everything comes to a head during one of the arcs that doesn't involve Snipe or one of the main characters (maybe the Shie Hassaikai Arc or something, neither of them were there, though I’m sure Snipe wanted to be). 

Imagine that it's a normal lab accident, Hatsume causes an explosion and is sent to Recovery Girl (maybe she got knocked out this time). There, I am not sure how things would come together. They are both side characters so I can break canon a bit without dealing with fallout from the canon interfering. 

Regardless, I like to think if this lab incident happened, and some blood was drawn, Snipe might just ask if Recovery Girl could compare his sample with Hatsume, just as a small favor because of some weird coincidences. Recovery Girl obliges, its not like it'll ruin the sample to compare the genetics, and with their technology it'll be quick. Well, one thing leads to another and-

============================

“Well, color me surprised,” Recovery Girl swivelled around in her chair to face Snipe. The hero in question had his head in his hands. The heroine could only imagine the incredibly sober look underneath his little mask.

“It can’t be…I thought I was going senile is all…”

“I’m the one who jokes about that, not you youngster…well I guess I should say parent now,”

“I swear…I swear I never knew about her. I would have…” He slumped in his chair, his shoulders shuddering as thoughts and memories known only to himself flooded his head.

“I didn’t wanna be like my pa…good for nothin’ beatnik,” 

“...well, don’t let his failures define your future then. Since it’s true and all, you have a choice whether or not to tell her,” The heroine then got up from her seat and began to head out the door.

“Stay as long as you need and think it over, I’ve gotta get over to the hospital, the raid should be over by now.” She sighed heavily. 

“Lord knows Midoriya is going to need his bones reset. Hopefully Sasaki kept a good eye on him,”

“Knowing that weirdo, he probably did,” Snipe retorted, trying to keep his thoughts straight.

“Are you seriously still thinking of him as a pervert? The tickle machine is strange, but its not a fetish…I think.”

“Well, you can ask him when you see him…”

Neither would get to know the inner weirdness of Mirai Sasaki after that day. If anything, it told Snipe that he needed to decide quickly. Tell his daughter….oh god he has a kid. A daughter. A crazed, psychotic, beautiful, brilliant, energetic daughter.

For the rest of that night, he did not sleep. From anxiety, worry, and some anger.

Why did she tell him nothing? If Mei’s mother who he thought she was.

============================

From here I am not sure how the reveal would go. I imagine that Nezu definitely knew (being the little rodent of chaos he is) and probably tells Snipe that its up to him, but considering both their back stories (Mei in the orphanage and Snipe with parental issues, fanon stuff I know just work with me here) maybe he should tell her.

Also for some lore Snipe went to the states for some time before coming back and then met his partner who would have their kid (and then leave her at an orphanage). Just figured it make the gun make sense and all. Mei definitely used it once when intruders broke into the orphanage. Just imagine kid Mei so proud of herself and there’s some creep that broke in bleeding out on the floor (might have inspired her to make the gun silencer more effective)

I hope you all enjoyed this rambling and let me know how you would go about the reveal! I legit am not too sure how to end this with the father-daughter duo I had in mind. Definitely would be cool to have Hatsume and Snipe be the gunslingers of the school.

Also I had an idea for Mei’s mom, though I’m guessing some might suspect who I was thinking of.

Last week I tried something new. I started reading my own book on the couch after dinner. I didn't say anything to him about it. After a few days, he got curious and asked what I was reading. Now he sits with me sometimes and reads his own book. It's only been like 10 minutes at a time but it's better than before.

My mom said when I was a kid, she used to read the newspaper every morning with coffee and I would copy her. I didn't remember that until she told me.

\-Do you read with your kids or just near them?

\-What time of day works best?

\-Do you make it a rule or just let it happen naturally?

\-Should I turn off the TV during reading time?

My son likes books about animals and sports. He'll read those but not the books from school. I don't know if I should make him read the school books or just let him read whatever he wants.

My issue is that I have zero self control for sugar.  It’s my vice. My addiction.  I’ve never done any drug, I rarely drink alcohol, and only in tiny amounts.  Never smoked.  I do drink coffee.  But the sugar.  I get such a craving.  I’ve read it’s as addictive as cocaine. I have no idea if that’s true, but I can say that I have no self control to avoid it, or to avoid wanting it and eating something sweet.

His name is Baron von Elon. He works 24/7, never sleeps, never complains, has zero attitude, requires no benefits, no insurance, and doesn’t even try to talk to me about crypto. Total annual salary: $1,188. Honestly feels illegal.

My Model Y has about 3,500 miles on it, and the Baron has personally driven roughly 3,100 of those. I’d rate his driving a solid 9/10. He loses one point because he occasionally treats speed bumps like they insulted his ancestors. I’m not saying he has a speed bump fetish, but he hits them like a SpaceX booster re entering the atmosphere. My coffee now travels with emotional support.

Traffic used to ruin my day. Now I just sit there like minor royalty while the Baron handles the peasant labor. Long highway drives? Easy. Complex intersections? He already knows which lane to be in like he read the script ahead of time.

Unexpected side effect: my wife stopped driving at night years ago because of glare and reflections. Now she’s out running errands after dark like a teenager who just got her license back. Turns out confidence increases dramatically when your driver has perfect night vision and zero fear of mortality.

Downsides:

You will start judging other cars for not having their own Baron.

You will forget how stressful driving used to be.

Your beverages will develop trust issues around speed bumps.

My sibling has a 2-year-old, and in my opinion he is out of control. He doesn’t just have occasional tantrums, this is happening every single day, multiple times a day.

The second he’s told “no” or doesn’t get his way, it’s immediate rage. Not whining. Not pouting. Full escalation.

He:

	•Slaps his mom in the face

	•Bites

	•Pulls hair

	•Hits whoever is nearby

•Throws whatever is in reach (iPads, cups of water, toys)

	•Flips things over

	•Screams at the top of his lungs

	•Has even tried to flip a coffee table

HUMAN-READABLE REPORT

You are not supposed to notice half a second.

It is beneath human threshold for consequence.

The train was operating normally.

Four hundred and eighteen passengers. Mid-afternoon. Routine velocity: 312 miles per hour. The magnetic containment field experienced a minor fluctuation, the kind that occurs dozens of times per operational cycle.

The conductor pressed the override at 14:03:11.

In the stable sequence, the button depressed cleanly. The field recalibrated. The fluctuation corrected.

In the adjacent sequence, the button resisted.

The delay measured 2.3 seconds.

The system was engineered to tolerate 1.8.

Delta: +0.5 seconds.

At 14:03:18, containment instability began to propagate along the guideway.

At 14:03:22, oscillation amplitude exceeded safety margins.

At 14:03:27, structural compromise initiated.

The first passenger car detached seconds later.

The official investigation cited cascade failure.

That is accurate.

It is not the origin.

Twenty-one days earlier, at 03:17 in a maintenance bay, a paper cup tipped.

The liquid was sweetened.

The technician wiped what he could see.

He did not remove the housing panel.

Sugar dried beneath the lip of the casing, where the button’s return mechanism retracts.

The manufacturer allowed 1.8 seconds of mechanical tolerance.

With residue present, resistance increased by half a second.

Forty-three seconds after the spill, the technician’s phone vibrated.

The message read:

We need to talk.

He locked the screen.

He finished the visible cleaning.

He left the seam.

The conversation that followed is unrecorded.

It does not alter the sugar.

It alters the attention.

The seam remained contaminated for twenty-one days.

At 14:03:11, the conductor pressed the override.

Sixteen seconds later, the guideway began to fail.

The train did not derail because of speed.

It derailed because tolerance was exceeded.

Tolerance was exceeded because of residue.

Residue remained because a seam was not opened.

The seam was not opened because attention shifted.

No report will document it that way.

This one does.

She is an understanding girl who always tries to understand people. Kind. Affectionate. Cheerful—one of those who can brighten your day with the smallest things without even trying. Mature. Fun—there won’t be a single day with her where you feel bored. Attentive. If you want to cry, you can do it with her because she will never judge you. She is unconditional, and also trustworthy—you can tell her anything, and she will keep it a secret if you want her to.

Disadvantages... Does someone like Chisato have disadvantages as a girlfriend? Well, yes.

And that is…

You can’t trust her with a single meal, or tell her that something in the fridge is yours, because she will eat it without you noticing.

It’s not explicitly mentioned in the anime, but at several moments as well as in official art, it’s shown that Chisato loves to eat. When Takina visits the blonde’s apartment, her coffee table is full of junk food, including chocolate and chips.

In Lycoris Recoil Official Comic Anthology: Repeat (a manga that tells short stories from the series), Chisato mentions that she always has room for crepes, even if she’s recently eaten heavy foods like sweets. Similarly, in the same story, when she’s ordering food with Takina and places her order, Takina asks if it doesn’t have too many calories, to which Chisato defends herself, saying that having cravings is normal for any girl.

That’s not even mentioning that in the previously mentioned manga, she encourages Takina not to be too strict with her meals, but that she can also indulge if she wants—just not excessively.

1r7qxpy,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1r7qxpy/he_thinks_im_a_cheater/,He thinks i’m a cheater,"A random guy added me on snapchat. I don’t know him. It didn’t say how he added me, and google says that means they were already in my contacts or I gave my snap out personally. I swear I never did. I have never ever talked to anyone else or gave my social media out. I asked my bf if he knew the person, because I’d only accept a request if it was one of his friends, but he said no. He then thought I was cheating.

Then on sunday, I was at a family gathering with him. Afterwards I realized I had accidentally put my phone on airplane mode for two hours. I looked at the notifications I missed with him, and a guy I was acquaintances with in high school liked my instagram story saying happy bday/valentines day to my partner. This guy and I were always platonic and never close. Last time we ever talked was a year ago when I ordered coffee and he was working. He asked how life has been since high school, I said good and asked him back, and he said good. We have not talked since. But he insisted that there was no way he’s like my story if I wasn’t talking to him or wasn’t romantically or sexually involved with him in any way. I swear I never have been. I blocked the guy, but my bf still thinks I purposefully had my phone on airplane mode.

Then yesterday. We were about to shower, when he saw scratch marks on my back. They looked really, really bad. I’ve never left scratch marks that prominent on his back, and I have short finger nails, so I have no idea how those marks got there. Not to be gross, but I do have some anxiety/boredom habits (I have autism, ADHD, and anxiety for extra context). Especially when I’m anxious, I will scratch at my scalp, bite skin on my fingers, hit myself in the head (I try to not do this one but it can be difficult when I’m really panicked and mentally shutting down), etc. i know I’ve scratched at my back and picked at the acne/dry skin. I don’t remember doing this, but it has to be the only explanation. He accused me of bringing men to fuck in his apartment while he’s at work.

Mixed with past situations where I’ve missed social cues (not realizing a male employee was flirting with me, awkwardly laughing at his friend asking me out as a joke bc i didn’t hear him correctly, taking off my sweatshirt to reveal a crop top multiple times while his male teammates are around, i promise i was not doing it intentionally)…he very much believes i am cheating.

Tonight he came back home from work and talked about it a bit. He said if i’m cheating that sucks but he’ll just ignore what he doesn’t know and it’s not worth the emotional energy to have another fight. I was insistent that I’ve never cheated and never would. Then after the conversation, we started snacking and gaming for a little. He was playing Dark Souls 1. That game is very dated mechanically, he really enjoys the precision of Dark Souls 3 and Elden Ring, so we really aren’t enjoying this game. But he was really struggling with a boss fight and finally made a lot of progress on it. Afterwards I complained about how the trees got in the way (the camera angle was messed up and made it hard to see the fight), then said “i can tell you’re seeing it” (as in seeing the move set from the enemy more clearly than before).

He got upset at me and said “do you say anything authentically?” Then proceeded to say that i overthink everything i say and only say what i think he’d want to hear. I explained that I was speaking authentically, I was thinking about how he improved but just happened to mention the crappy camera angle first and I was sorry for how it came off. He then got upset that after I saw how much he improved, I didn’t say “damn” or “good job” or anything to show I cared. I mentioned that I brought up how he’s seeing the moves a lot more, and he said it came off as shallow. I said it wasn’t shallow and was just in shock.

He turned off the game and said I ruined it. Then said he was tired and going to his room. He has been in there for an hour.

I feel like everything I say is the wrong thing

But every time I try to say the right thing it also ends up being the wrong thing

He thinks i’m a cheater when I have never been unloyal in my life, but he also won’t break up with me. He said fighting takes too much emotional energy. We fought for the last time a week ago, to which I broke up with him because he was saying everything was my fault, I’ve hurt him so badly, I’m never there for him when he needs me, etc. i figured if I hurt him so much no matter how much I’m trying to just show my love and be peaceful and happy, breaking up means I wouldn’t be able to hurt him anymore. He got mad at me and threw my bag full of stuff to the other side of the room. Started screaming at me and told me to get the fuck out. Slapped my hand and pushed me. Slapped my hand again but it missed and he hit my side. Pushed me more. Called me names. Called me useless. Said some other really hurtful things.

I exploded one day and exposed things that were sensitive and private. Looking back, I realize it was a reaction to my own instability and anger but I also understand that my actions caused him pain and trauma.

  
It has been a long process of grief and also reflection. Sometimes, I see posts of him on socmeds (i was able to stalk him in my dummy account) doing things we used to dream about together like rides and coffee trips, and it hits me all over again. All the memories come rushing back and I realize I lost not just a friend but a part of my life and my identity that existed in that bond.

I still have dreams about us being okay again and sometimes I wonder how things could have been different. It hurts that it ended the way it did but I am trying to accept that he chose peace and I have to respect that.

Idk, losing someone I've known for so long is like a romantic breakup. The grief is complicated and messy and I think it will take time to fully process. But I am learning to carry the memories with me, and slowly find a way to move forward.",1,1771382240.0,lostafriend,0,1.0,False
1r7qw8s,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1r7qw8s/why_did_this_affect_me_so_much/,Why did this affect me so much?,"This story is too long to put on this subreddit; it's too long for most people, but if that doesn't bother you, then have a read. This is my story about my first love. I could've said so much more, but it would be too long. To me, this meant A LOT! To many, this isn't anything. And if you have any advice as to how I go about navigating my dating life in the future, or any general pieces of advice, please do not hesitate. That's partly why I wrote this, but also to let out some thoughts.

My lack of dating experience really showed itself once I got into my very first ""thing."" I've always been super unconfident for whatever reason, plus I'm naturally introverted and shy. I've never asked anyone out, never kissed, and am still a virgin. Just need to say this before going on to the story, I feel that it's relevant.

So, last year, I finally got my first exposure to dating/romance, and it came my way. That's the only reason I have even a tiny bit of experience now. Since I was 18, I've completely counted myself out of the dating market because basically, I felt inferior to everyone due to reasons like looks, intelligence, social skills, socioeconomic status, and so on. I'm not trying to sound pathetic; this is genuinely how I felt, and it's slightly better now.

I was at a very small restaurant that I had been to a handful of times - in this town I was new to, and I had been here six months at the time. The waitress was cute and looked my age, but I didn't think much of it. Her shift ended before my group even finished eating. I knew this because she stopped serving everyone and started getting ready to go out into the cold. Very unexpectedly, she quickly placed a note in front of me without a word and left. When I looked back at her, she was already out the door. So, I opened the note, ""I think you're super cute. If you're single, text me!"" She left her number, and I was in disbelief and so surprised! It instantly made me happy, and I still think of this moment as a pivotal shift in my timeline when I reflect on the last four years of my life. We didn't have any conversation other than ordering food. She was quiet and seemed kinda reserved.

Once I got home, I texted her and she responded very quickly. Now it felt more real; she was actually serious and responding. Despite counting myself out of the game most of my life, I craved romance very, very badly. My lack of experience really bothered me, and I would fantasize about eventually finding an affectionate person to be with. So, after texting a bit, I started to get excited about the whole thing. This was the first person I had ever texted who clearly had an interest in me. She was 20, I was 21. We didn't talk much over text; I wanted to have stuff to talk about in person. I asked her to get coffee or tea because I wanted to get to know her. We planned to go out the next day. I was super excited but also very nervous... it was my first date ever, and it was coming quickly!

Work felt so long, I was so joyful, excited, yet nervous! Once I got off work, I went downtown to meet her at a teahouse we settled on. I was super nervous, but still very much looking forward to it. The sun was setting, and it was pretty dark at this point. I saw her sitting outside the teahouse, we hugged, and formally introduced ourselves since we hadn't really met in person yet. She was also super nervous, which caught me off guard. In all honesty, our date went much better than I thought it would. The conversation kept flowing really well, and we were both clearly enjoying it. I was able to get a better look at her now that we were one-on-one, and I genuinely just thought she was so pretty! She really was beautiful, and I loved her personality. I was so surprised by how well it was going. We both felt comfortable enough to start getting slightly more personal near the end of our conversation. One big thing, though, near the end of our talk at the teahouse, she told me how she had drug problems. She was three months sober at this point, and this scared me a little bit, but I really admired the honesty to tell me that on the first date. To me, this wasn't at all a deal breaker. I'm willing to be with someone who's trying to improve their life, whatever point they're at. For the record, she abused ketamine and ecstasy, but mainly ketamine. And it really bothered her; that was obvious. I dropped her off at her house after, and that was it for the first date.

I felt on top of the world after the first date! I didn't care if it was going to work out or not; I was just so happy about the whole experience. I felt seen by someone for the first time in my life. We were texting often after the date. I felt like my energy levels were better, and life was more interesting! Everything just felt good. I felt like I finally found a life that wasn't miserable. I had just moved to a new town with my brother and friends, I found a good job instantly, and my coworkers were amazing. My week of work passed by, and finally, the weekend was here, and obviously, I wanted to see her. We planned to meet up again, go on a trail near my house, and smoke weed since we both liked to. So, Saturday night, we were going to meet up, but she ended up cancelling cause of the weather, which admittedly, the weather was shit. We were texting that whole night still. It wasn't like she flaked on me; it was honestly a bad time to do what we had planned, and she was still very responsive after cancelling. But stupid, inexperienced, and emotional me took this personally. My friends were out drinking that night, and I didn't go with them since I thought I'd be seeing her. I decided to join them after this, and I got fucking shitfaced!! This was not typical of me at all. I hardly ever drink. I wasn't in that bad of a mood, but the past week was one of the most emotional weeks of my life, and I guess I was coping this night. It was one of those nights where you throw up and magically respawn in your bed, albeit with a terrible hangover. Thankfully, I had friends who could get me back home who were sober.

I woke up to a bunch of texts from her, and she wanted to meet up today. I almost didn't go, but still ended up going. She came to my house, and I didn't have her come in; we just started walking to the trail. We sat on top of a boulder with a really good view and started smoking. We saw deer, we talked a bunch, we both got pretty personal, and opened up more. It got super cold as the sun was setting, so we rushed back to my house. I decided to go to a popular outlook point that looks over the town, so we did. This may have been my most awkward moment. Once we parked, I wanted to make some type of physical touch since things felt good enough. For some reason, out of nervousness, I went to put my arm around her, and as I did, I also asked what really made her want to write that note. I instantly noticed she didn't respond physically to this, so I quickly withdrew my arm and just felt pure shame. But she responded to my question, and she acted like that didn't just happen. She said she just thought I was cute and that she had never done anything like that before. She was on a path of improving her life mainly through sobriety, but this little act was also a new, bold step for her. Then, after that conversation, I told her how I just wanted to find a spot to chill, which was why I chose the outlook. She suggested we get ice cream and go back to her place, but she also said that she didn't want to do anything crazy. I felt bad because that wasn't at all my intent. I felt like I creeped her out earlier. I couldn't have even handled sex, to be completely honest. That would've been too much for me as well.

We got to her house, and she had a small twin-sized bed. We spent the rest of the night cuddling, watching a show, and listening to music. This was the first time I got to cuddle with a woman my age, and it was something I had needed for years. It was unreal, and I was so comfortable that I started to forget about what happened right before this. It was so cold outside, and we got to spend time just snuggling! It got pretty late, and she walked me out as I was leaving. She hugged me with her head turned to the side. I think she was scared I might try to kiss her, which was on my mind, but I don't even know how to do that. Left her house feeling kind of shitty but happy at the same time that I was making some progress.

I was surprised that after this date, she was texting me a lot, and we were texting daily at this point. So, I went to her house again, and we did the same thing as last time. When I left this time, as I hugged her, she was making eye contact, this time, and it felt intense. She seemed open to a kiss, but I couldn't do it.

That was the last time I saw her. We continued to text after this time as well for about another week and a half. She was sending me selfies, super responsive, and seemed interested. Then left town momentarily, and once that happened, everything changed. She was texting way less often, and there was just a noticeable shift ever since she got back into town. I don't know what caused this or what happened while she was gone. She may have been disinterested from the start, but entertained things for a short while. She might've had someone else in her life. Another thing I thought was that she might've relapsed while out of town. We talked a lot about her past with drugs, and while she was sober, it still seemed like she wasn't over it yet. So, now there was distance between us over text, and I couldn't take it. So, I told her I had feelings for her, which was overwhelmingly true. She didn't take that well; she was startled by it, but she wanted to keep talking still. Then, after some more days, she texted me saying she didn't feel the same way as me and we stopped talking. I texted her a few times after this out of desperation; sometimes she would respond. I wasn't taking it well at all. I finally started to feel better after a couple of months. Then even more time passed, and I definitely did not forget about her, quite the opposite, but I was somewhat unbothered by it. Then, suddenly out of the blue, she texted me. She wanted to see me, but didn't want to be in a relationship. I wasn't capable of doing that, but I acted like I was because even if there was a tiny chance at a relationship, that was enough for me. As we texted more, she made it seem like she just wanted to hookup. I couldn't do this. I was so emotionally invested that there was no way I could just have a casual relationship with her. This made me believe even more strongly that she might've been using drugs again because, from what I knew about her, this wasn't like her. That's still entirely a guess, and I don't want to make that sound like that's why she left me. So, we both stopped texting each other once again.

At this point, it's been almost exactly a year since we stopped seeing each other. I did just about everything wrong, and that's part of the reason I got so hurt. You'd be surprised by how often she pops into my mind still. I am over it at this point, but I still feel emotional when I think about it all. I still get those pleasant and joyful feelings when thinking about the beginning, and those same depressing, dreadful feelings when I think about the end. I remember the super cold winter we had when I met her. The songs I listened to. Driving by the cute little restaurant she used to work at, and being reminded about the whole thing. I was very hurt for six months or maybe slightly longer. When she texted me out of the blue, that reactivated everything and delayed my healing. I got really depressed, got very addicted to nicotine, and couldn't perform well at work. I felt so close to finally having love. I can't believe how short the whole experience was. I only saw her three times, and we talked daily for three weeks. IT WAS SO BRIEF!! And for how much it was in my mind, how it affected me, I can't believe it was only that long. Thank you so much for reading this, if you did... seriously!",0,1771382239.0,dating_advice,1,0.5,False

Last semester, two of the professors were put on leave while a Title IX investigation built up. One of my colleagues reported that they saw one of the professors bringing a cup of coffee he'd bought from Dutch Bros to a student for her birthday. This professor was also seen leading the student out to his car, alongside a friend, to give her another gift he purchased. We decided to ask the school's counselor about this behavior, as they worked closely with this student. We found that this person had withheld information about the student's feelings surrounding the professor's behavior (the student had concerns, but they weren't being reported). When we asked the student about this alongside the Title IX coordinator, she claimed that she had been uncomfortable with his behavior for months before this. She said that he always gave her special attention and gifts, and they would even email over the summer. However, she initiated most of the email interactions. They contained what appeared to be a close friendship, and he even called her his ""forever honorary daughter"". She kept track of certain interactions that made her uncomfortable via journal, but the interactions were never physical. She claimed that he once told her he loved her in front of the class, but this statement was never proven. She also went into detail about a ""secret society"" called The Hooper's Club, where he recruited girls who wore hoop earrings simply because he liked the jewelry. Anyway, you guys get the gist. When all was said and done, the professor was allowed to come back from leave and continue teaching. We made sure he understood what he had been put on leave for, and gave him a bulleted list of behavior he was not allowed to exhibit with students (egs; gift-giving, personal emailing, etc). The student retaliated by emailing myself, the school's principle, and our Title IX coordinator, angrily stating how we failed her and the professor should have been fired. After his return she attempted to give him a sticker as a thanks for writing her a letter of recommendation. When the student was asked about this, she said that he accepted the gift and she wanted to extend an ""olive branch"" to him?? However, he told me that he told her to take the gift back and even emailed her stating that he would no longer write her a letter of recommendation. She dropped his class shortly afterwards. 

I still don't understand what she expected us to do. There wasn't any proof of sexual misconduct and it didn't appear as if the professor did anything besides favor her. ",5,1771382230.0,Professors,4,0.69,False

My ADHD - Severe inattentive. 

Notes about severity:

- I have a diagnosis from a psychiatrist that says I have the worst case without comorbidity that he's seen in 26 years.

- I have a note on the same diagnosis that says my doctors should consider medical restrictions on driving for me if I fail to take medication, because my ADHD impacts my ability to drive very much. 

- I have never held a job longer than 8 months without medication

- On meds, I am currently on my longest streak of employment - 2.5 years.

- I have an extremely high sex drive and desire for pain that is distressing when I do not take medication. Adderall has helped severely reduce this when I take it. 

- On meds, I also cleared 40k of debt, did my taxes for the first time as an adult, and started saving for retirement. 

- While I have never tried an illegal substance in my life or abused my medication, prior to getting diagnosed with ADHD and being medication, I would self medicate with excessive caffeine (3 red bulls and 2 coffees a day) to compensate, and use alcohol for task completion and sleep. On adderall, the desire for these completely disappears - caffeine becomes an occasional treat, and I don't drink at all.


**Background Context**

I'll use the term ""ex"" to describe him.. We had an on again off again relationship from September 2024 to now. About 1.5 years. We dated, we were FWB, we were in a real relationship. It's messy and all over the place. We also had a BDSM relationship that remained a consistent way we related to each other throughout.

My reason for leaving typically involved perceived lack of romantic interest from him. It was also the first time I've had a FWB type relationship and I didn't like it and kept trying to leave. He treated me very well, so I tried to ignore the lack of commitment; eventually feelings of doubt I'd have would well up and I'd leave. But I'd often come back due to my lack of impulse control - I've got severe ADHD and hypersexuality as result. I also knew he was good for my ADHD in combination with kink. He was aware of all of the above listed issues.

He liked controlling and organizing and deciding, and I preferred submitting. Due to my severe ADHD, I suck at planning and organizing. So we fit together well. He added structure to my life that I benefited from A LOT, and he felt like he was given an opportunity to control he had never been allowed to enjoy before. It felt a lot like he was my caretaker from my perspective, and he was happy to play that part. 

**Recent Events**

We last broke up in November 2025. I thought it would be permanent. We didn't talk for 2 months. 

But in mid January, my ADHD medication suddenly stopped working. This was and is devastating. I'm still not back on track. I've been told by 3 professionals that I have one of the worst cases of ADHD they've seen in terms of it's impact - it's not just about distraction. Without medication, I've only been able to hold jobs for a max of 6 months. 

I tried to go to the doctor and was brushed aside - they implied I was probably trying to sell my medication to others, and they refused to make changes. 

When I got pulled aside at work and told things had to improve, I panicked. So, I called my ex, and asked him to go to the doctors with me and help me push the doctors to do something So I brought him with me to help advocate for me. He came. We went over some options. I wanted connection and comfort so we hooked up after. 

I had a conversation with him after about how I was struggling to keep my job and wanted his help keeping my life organized. I told him I wanted him to be actively involved if he was willing - I need structure to not lose my job and to figure out what was wrong with my meds. 

The main benefit was sleep and getting to work on time. He has much better sleep hygiene than I do, and when I follow his lead I feel 10x better rested, and I feel like I can take advantage of the medication better the next day. He also reminded me to take my meds, would get me ready for work to make sure I got there in time (huge problem for me). 

And the price to pay for all this was basically sex. It's not like either of us explicitly said it was that transactional, but it's just part of how we interact together; we couldn't have such an asymmetrical relationship sustained for long without it, and we're both highly sexual people, so it was fine. I knew I'd regret it later because of all the back and forth over the last year and a half, but to get me through a rough period where my meds didn't work, I decided it was fine to rob Peter to pay Paul; sacrifice some long term happiness to have my immediate needs met and get help keeping my job. 

We were explicit about my expectation of him helping me and taking on a kind of care taker roll. We didn't explicitly say it was in exchange for sex, but it was understood. We used terms like ""restart"" our dynamic. Verbatim ""if we're *restarting this,* I need you to be actively involved and more strict with me, particularly in relation to sleeping and getting to work on time... I need help with everything, I'm a disaster."" We agreed he'd take charge of everything when I stayed over, and would lend support less directly when I was at my place and not with him, which mostly took the form of reminders and venting and appointment planning, but it was fluid. 

I quickly started to feel used - something I frequently felt over the last year and a half without commitment. I wasn't comfortable with the knowledge that without sex, he wouldn't be helping me to that extent. But I was scared of losing my job, so I stayed. While I wasn't 100% sure I trusted him, I knew he never mistreated of me... maybe I felt conflicted about whether I was being taken advantage of, but I thought it might be worth it if it helped keep me employed.

This goes on for about a month. At this point, I'm planning to leave him on good terms as soon as I get a sleeping pill or different medication for ADHD - use our dynamic to bridge the gap until my appointment with a specialist towards the end of February.

**Thursday**

Then, Thursday happens. 

The cumulative effects of my medication not working start to add up and present themselves. Within the span of an evening, all of the following happened:

- I lost my $300 pair of headphones for the second time in a week. 

- I lost my $100 electric tooth brush.

- I lost keycard for work. 

- I realized too late that I missed 2 appointments that cost me $600 total.

- I realized I missed the window to return an item worth $180 that had been mailed to me damaged.

- My place was SO messy, I couldn't see the floor. This resulted in me stepping on a box cutter that was hidden under a sock. I stabbed myself in the foot, and my blood got all over some work documents which were also on the floor. 

This all happened in the span of 4 hours. It's now 11:59 pm on Thursday.

I was so so so full of frustration and rage at myself. I'm typically a happy person, with low anxiety, no depression, and high self esteem. But, I start having... we'll say, ""extreme depression thoughts"". 

This is not normal for me. 

But I work in a hospital and I know the drill. If you call 911 for ""extreme depression thoughts"", you are either referred to non emergency resources that don't provide immediate assistance OR, if they think you're ""extreme depression thoughts"" are too extreme, they send the ambulance or the police, you get taken to a ""psych ward"" for a mandatory period of time for observation. (I'm using imprecise language in quotes because using the exact words can lead to doxxing because of jargon between hospitals).

Because of the admin nature of my job, ALL of my coworkers would see the paperwork showing I had been admitted for that reason. And if you've ever worked at a hospital, YOU KNOW everyone talks. So, I didn't consider that a solution.

So, despite it literally being midnight, I reached out to my ex. He has a work from home job, and typically sleeps between 1:30 am and 9:30am. I knew he'd be up, and I had been texting him about random things throughout the evening. He usually games between 9pm and 1am. I knew he'd be awake, and he had agreed to help me with my mental health issues - so I reach out.

I say: 

***""You busy? I'm having a rough night""***

He responds in a minute.  

***""in game with my crew and im going to bed after - sorry""***

***""K""***

I text another friend. 

At the time, she didn't know that I had ADHD or that I had been struggling with a medication crisis. She assumes I witnessed something traumatizing working at the hospital. So, with very few details other than knowing it's unusual for me to ask for help at so late an hour, she drives from 2 cities away to make sure I'm okay, keeping me on the phone most of that time. 

I tell her everything - my diagnosis, my medication struggles, the accusations from the doctor that I had been selling my meds, the shitty evening I'd had, my ""severe depression thoughts"", and how I was reluctant to call 911 or go to the hospital because my coworkers would find out.

It's almost 4am after I'm done. She convinces me to come with her to her families cottage with her brother. They'll keep an on me over night, and if needed they can call 911 if my ""severe depression thoughts"" get worse or if they have concern they'll turn to action. And since the cottage is several cities away, there's 0 risk my colleagues will find out. 

I agree. I go with her. When we get to the cottage, I take some sleeping pills that belonged to her mom. I sleep almost 16 hours straight. 

We have a decent weekend. We watch movies. We play board games. We talk. We mostly keep it light until she needs to get back to the city on Sunday night. We agree I seem better and that the moment has passed, so I return to my normal life.

**Aftermath With Ex**

Throughout my entire stay with my friend, my ex didn't text me. I felt so uncared for. Here's our last few texts, with edits for privacy and brevity:

*~~~ Thursday night/early Friday ~~~*   
  
*12:00am: Me:* ***""You busy? I'm having a rough night""***

*12:01am: Ex:* ***""in game with my crew and im going to bed after - sorry""***

*12:01am: Me:* ***""K""***

*1:14am: Ex:* ***""I'm headed to bed. G'night.""***

*10:13am: Ex:* ***""Morning""***

*~~~ Sunday ~~~* 

*1:59pm: Me: 5 paragraph long rant about how he should have texted me or called to see what was wrong, expressing I did not feel cared for and he had agreed to help me. I accuse him of using me for sex, tell him he's never made me feel wanted or cared for, and I needed to permanently end seeing him. I tell him there's something wrong with him - for caring so little, for showing a consistent disregard for my feelings and not communicating. I tell him I'm going to block him and ask him to do the same just in case I ever forget how abandoned he makes me feel.*

*2pm: Ex:* ***""Holy shit, just from this?""*** *[*replies to text about being busy with gaming*]* 

*2pm: Ex:* ***""It was late and I was busy.""***

*2:01pm:* ***""This one thing overwrites all the good? That's brutal. I do not think there is something wrong with me, with all due respect. I do know you were hurt but silent treatment is not a game I will play either, hence why I did not message a third time after receiving no response""***

*He continues typing, but that's all he manages to enter before I block him.* 

**Did I overreacted?**

Points defending myself:

- I didn't swear  

- I didn't name call  

- I felt like I reached my limit with him and expressed that. I felt like he didn't even care to know if I was okay or what had been bothering me. He agreed to help me and he failed to do it at a critical moment. I saw no point in continuing things with him if I wasn't getting the help he promised - this wasn't about sex or romance for me - we had already tried that and we knew it didn't work. I was leaning on him for support, and if I wasn't getting that, I wanted out.  

- I didn't mention my ""severe depression thoughts"" - I thought that might look like a guilt trip, especially after I decided I didn't want to see him anymore.  

- While I could have done a better job at communicating, I was also going through a mental health crisis, I caught up on some much needed sleep after burn out and being given a sleeping pill, and then focused on the people who were helping me and spending time with me while I was a guest. I also didn't want to be sad speaking to him.   

- I wasn't giving him the silent treatment. Saturday was Valentine's - from my perspective, I was being generous to him about his lack of contact. I thought that perhaps his lack of contact was related to that. Either he didn't want to contact me to avoid signally anything romantic (totally in his character btw), OR perhaps he had been dating someone and didn't tell me, and was spending time with them. While our sexual relationship was monogamous, we have an understanding that we are not going to be together forever, so dating other people was acceptable - all we owed each other was the knowledge of sleeping with other people for STD risks. So, I considered it would look from his perspective if he were spending Valentine's Day with a date, and he got a call or text from a mentally ill ex girlfriend asking why he hadn't been in communication. The optics of that don't look great. So, despite being offended that he couldn't have spared 30 seconds to send a message saying ""Hey are you okay?"", I gave him the benefit of the doubt and decided not to be intrusive - I was in the care of friends anyway, so despite feeling hurt about his lack of communication, it was no longer an urgent situation.   

- By Sunday I felt confident that my Valentine's Day theory was wrong and he had deliberately decided not to contact me.

His perspective (or what I imagine his perspective is):

- He's very routine oriented, so I would have known he was busy gaming. 

- He quickly communicated he was gaming and apologized 

- He texted good night and good morning, which is routine for us.

- I hadn't communicated the extent of my mental health crisis that evening, including the ""severe depression thoughts""

- My text message was very harsh. I was critical of his ability to communicate, questioned whether he cared for me, accused him of using me, and related this all back to previous issues we'd had when dating. It was definitely a personal attack.

- And then his comment about ""the silent treatment""

**What's your opinion?**

I guess he thought I was playing a game, and I wasn't; I was struggling and scrambled to find help. He's offended because it seems like I'm over-reacting. I felt like he under reacted and offered no help when I needed it, and was more proud about who won an exchange via who texts who first instead of taking the initiative to see if I was okay.

We had a good conversation for about an hour until she had to leave. The conversation was warm and natural, and it has fairly well confirmed my interest. When she left she said, “we should do this again sometime.”

I would say it went well, but it is probably well within the category of friendship at this point. I’m still trying to figure out next steps because I want to be discerning and honor her in the process.

Some friends are telling me to try to meet up a couple more times over the next several weeks and see if things progress before taking the plunge and sharing my intentions. However, others are saying I should just ask her out since we are both in our 30s and more mature.  Either way I’m not sure what the best timing is and I don’t think it's wise to rush things until I find a little more clarity. I almost feel stuck in the middle.

I just want to take the wisest path since I have known her for about 13 years and I just recently found myself interested. I certainly don’t want things to linger and become ambiguous. I just want some input so I can do this in the most God honoring way.

couple questions / concerns i had were;

* i want to keep car rental days on the same day as possible. because parking at the HHV is $70/day. so we WONT be parking there. Is there an option where we can do a daily car rental? or an option that DOESNT charge us for parking? (i remember i saw a thread on reddit about it... but i cant find it anymore) how good of an option is Turo?

* on day 1, we first plan to start the day with the diamond head hike. we DONT have reef safe sunscreen. is it ok to use standard sunscreen if we WONT be going into the beach? (plan is to buy reef safe sunscreen and anything else we may need including boardshorts after the hike + Kapi’olani Park before heading back to hotel to wash up)

* any decent place to buy boardshorts we can use for snorkerling, beach activities, lounging at pool, etc?

* Day 4. i have a meeting i CANT miss no matter what that starts at 12:30pm and ends at around 3pm. whats something we can do before then, as well as after? should we move some other things around from other days to this day?

* for day 5, i think this is a tricky day? we plan on starting the day with the Ocean voyage thats on gocity pass. as early as possible (i think thats 8:40am) i heard good things about the UTV tour but my mom is not a fan. but also she has asthma and everyones saying its super dusty. i am also not a fan of the though of it being super dusty. nor it being very muddy. especially since its not going to be the end of our day. So instead, we're thinking of doing the Kualoa Secret Island beach half day thats on gocity. is this worth it?

* with day 5, will we have enough time to check out Hoomaluhia garden and byodin temple since they close at 4pm? (Either Ocean voyage tour + Haflday secret island tour. or Ocean voyage tour + 1hour UTV tour. the latter definitely seems possible. but not sure about the first option.)

* day 6 any recommendations on what to check out / do at Kapolei?

* based on this schedule, we still have 2 full days left. there are some things i left out on a list of things we looked up for hawaii. but wondering if we should just leave it blank? i assume some things will go out of whack and everything wont necessarily go according to plan. so having 2 days buffer seems fine?",2,1771381730.0,travel,5,1.0,False

1r7qjsc,https://i.redd.it/5afvk278y5kg1.jpeg,2580 calories/day 265 grams protein,"I am currently 355 lbs (down from 460) and oddly enough Ethan and I have the same targets. I typically aim for 2500 - 2900 calories a day and a minimum of 10k steps a day. I usually hit my steps well before my work day is done but if I’m in meetings all day etc, I hit the treadmill after weight lifting to catch up. My calorie range is wide just for the fact that on leg day and the day after I add in 2 extra scoops of protein (double scoop shakes) cause I be hungry after working the wheels but the other 5 days a week are at the 2580 calories. Protein for the days with the extra scoops is 314 grams and the rest is 264 grams. 

I am saying all of this because this puts me in a deficit to loose 2-3 lbs a week, which I see 2 lbs pretty reliably. Now I do lift to failure 5 days a week also (actually just hit 225 bench for 3 last week…. Shameless brag because my lady friend didn’t care lol). But anyways, yes it is that “easy” and calculated. And if Ethan is hitting his goals, at his weight he should be seeing 4-5 lb loss a week easily. 

I know most of us have either done this or are currently doing this and understand. I say easy because in theory it’s super easy.  Mentally this shit is hard because I love food and didn’t get to 460 lbs because I didn’t like to eat, but meal prepping has made this attainable. I don’t like having to weigh every gram of food but I need to or I will blow my calories way out. Protein pasta has become more available in Canada so I’ve been hard on the protein pastas for the past couple weeks but I will change things up on the next round of meal prepping.

He’s naturally a friendly and outgoing person, but when he’s taking to me, it just seems different. We sit near each other and he is always asking me questions about my personal life. And when I answer his questions he seems genuinely interested and is like “wow I didn’t know that about you” stuff like that. When he talks to me, he usually makes eye contact for a second and then kinda looks down.

I joined a new team at work last week, and he did a coffee order with his team and messaged me and said “it wasn’t the same without you”. We had a holiday party with the company two months ago. He complimented the bracelet I was wearing, but he didn’t talk to me much at the party. After, a few of us went to a bar. At the bar, he wouldn’t stop talking to me despite us being in a group.

She told me about his trip to Chiang Mai last November. Her name is Samiam, 60 years old, from Sweden. Her husband passed away in 2019, and her children are all grown up, so she traveled alone.

“First day at the sanctuary,” he said, “I didn’t take a single photo. I just sat under a tree and watched this old female elephant standing alone. She was staring into the distance. And I thought—God, she looks like me.” So she asked to volunteer, but not a one-day tour, five days.

Woke up at 5 AM, prepared milk for orphaned baby elephants, cleaned poop and chopped grass. Her hands trembled a little as she told me this, but her eyes—her eyes were bright. She said: "" There was this one little elephant, who kept poking me with her trunk, asking for milk. I held her, and she breathed softly against my ear. For the first time since my husband passed, I felt my heart beat again.”

She smiled: “ I didn't take a single picture of that elephant. Because no camera—no photo—could ever capture how it felt when she rested her head on my shoulder that late afternoon.” She shared with me that she was old now, so she didn't need to look back at the picture, just needed to remember.

I’m writing this and still chuckling at myself. Back then in Chiang Mai, I came home and proudly showed my friends my elephant-riding album, beautiful shots and fun moments. But I’ve never had an elephant rest her head on my shoulder.

Maybe that Swedish woman—60 years old, traveling alone—has figured out something I haven’t. She travels not to have more, but to be more. And I think that is the kind of trip can still remember forever.",1,1771381231.0,u_Lynae26,0,1.0,False

1r7qgwb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Relocating2miami/comments/1r7qgwb/relocating_to_miami_5_smart_questions_to_ask/,Relocating to Miami: 5 Smart Questions to Ask Before Choosing a Neighborhood,"Relocating to Miami? Read This Before You Start House Hunting

If you’re relocating to Miami from out of state, here’s the truth:

Miami is not one lifestyle. It’s multiple lifestyles packed into one city. The biggest mistake I see families make when relocating to Miami is choosing a property before choosing a lifestyle.

You can live on the beach in Miami Beach, walk everywhere in Brickell, enjoy tree-lined historic streets in Coral Gables, or settle into family-focused neighborhoods like Pinecrest with larger lots and top-rated schools.

**Before you start touring homes or signing a lease, ask yourself these 5 questions. This will save you time, money, and frustration.**

**1. What Kind of Daily Life Do We Want?**

Not just “Where do we want to live?”

Ask: What do we want our normal Tuesday to feel like?

• Morning walks by the ocean?

• Coffee shops and skyline views downstairs?

• Quiet streets and backyard BBQs?

• Golf, tennis, and country club life?

Your lifestyle determines your neighborhood more than your budget does when relocating to Miami.

**2. Do We Want Walkability — or Space?**

If you move to Brickell, you can take the MetroRail from the airport and live without a car. Restaurants, offices, nightlife — it’s all there.

If you choose Pinecrest or parts of Coral Gables, you’ll likely want a car, but you gain space, privacy, and a calmer environment.

There’s no right answer — only what fits your family rhythm.

**3. What Is Our True Monthly Budget in Miami?**

When people relocate to Miami, they often focus only on purchase price or rent.

But you need to calculate:

• Property taxes

• HOA fees (especially in condos)

• Homeowners insurance

• Flood insurance (in some areas)

• School tuition (if private)

• Commute and parking costs

Miami living can look glamorous — but smart planning keeps it sustainable.

**4. Are Schools a Top Priority?**

If you’re relocating with children, school zoning can immediately narrow your search.

Certain neighborhoods hold long-term value specifically because of strong school districts. If private school is your plan, you’ll have more flexibility when choosing where to live in Miami.

Make this decision early so you don’t waste time touring the wrong areas.

**5. Is This a Short-Term Move or a Long-Term Base?**

Are you testing Miami for 2–3 years?

Or building a 10+ year foundation?

Short-term? Focus on liquidity and rental potential.

Long-term? Think lot size, appreciation, expansion potential, and community stability.

Your timeline should shape your real estate strategy.

**Final Advice for Families Relocating to Miami**

The biggest mistake I see families make when relocating to Miami is choosing a property before choosing a lifestyle.

Miami Beach energy is different from Brickell’s financial buzz.

Coral Gables charm feels different from Pinecrest’s family focus.

Define how you want to live first. Then choose where.
