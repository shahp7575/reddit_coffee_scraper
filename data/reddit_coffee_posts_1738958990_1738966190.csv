1ik75zb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anticonsumption/comments/1ik75zb/overconsumption_and_self_reflection/,Overconsumption and self reflection,"I grew up in Colorado where the majority of my friends and the people around me were generally conscious of their consumption, like making an effort to recycle, using what they have, spending in their budget, thrifting etc. 

I moved to Georgia about 6 months ago and I am continually amazed and disheartened by the over consumption culture here. People look at you weirdly if you want to try to recycle something. I see people in my Appartment complex constantly throwing perfectly good furniture in the dumpster. People throwing their trash over fences and the trash bags piling up. People just generally throwing trash on the ground instead of looking for a trash can. People throwing trash out the window of their cars.

 I went to the grocery store the day after the hurricane and watched people stockpile resources that there extremely limited at that time. Everyone panicked about not having power for a few days, bought generators and were fighting for gas while people were literally dying and had their entire house destroyed. 

Not even to mentioned that every time I went to Walmart they would put like 2 things in a plastic bag and then double bag ""things that were too heavy"" like a single 1/2 gallon of milk. If I need something from there, I will now ask them to use my own bag and they always get mixed up in their checkout process and get confused.

And then there's my co workers. I try to distance myself from them but sometimes I do interact and watch what they do. First off, they all complain about being broke and not having enough money for their living expenses. Then, i watch them go to the cafeteria every single day for both breakfast and lunch to get food. Every meal from there is served in a large styrofoam to go container and they always get plastic silverware along with it. They all generally go out for dinner a few times a week as well. They make fun of me for bringing my own lunch and are shocked that I haven't been to ""the best restaurant in town"". They all have multiple Stanley cups that they bring around everywhere they go. Today I watched one of them pour water from a plastic water bottle into their Stanley cup! And then throw away the plastic water bottle. I was mortified. They all generally come in with a large iced to go coffee in a plastic container. The trash collectors come every day and take away full bins of trash from their food alone every day. 

One of them recently ordered a bunch of things from shein and was upset today about the possibility of it not arriving due to customs bans on Chinese imports. She then went on to talk about how she loves having tons of clothes to choose from but hates spending money on good products. She  said that when she's ready to move clothes out of her closet she doesn't feel as bad because it was super cheep and she can easily buy a new thing. 

Another one of them talked about when she cleaned out her house she threw away every cleaning product she had under the sink because she just didn't want to see it and she would buy everything again when she needed it. These kinds of things don't go bad!

They all are super excited to talk about all of the new seasonal gadgets that they are buying for their house and are always so excited to show other people for approval. I have a general sense of their income and know they can't afford all this life style so I keep thinking about how much debt they must have from constantly buying useless things and going out to eat. 

When they tell me about all the new things they buy I don't really say much and I don't know how to stand up to them! They are all generally much older than I am and are very set in their ways.

Needless to say my bubble has been popped!  I am mortified, I am repulsed, I can't believe how many people live this way.

 It seems like everyone here just wants the appearance that they are well off financially and have endless resources that are disposable to them. Everyone constantly jumping on every micro trend and buying things just because it's cheep or on sale. 

The whole reflection makes me have a crisis over my own consumption and the fact that pretty much every thing I've ever touched (outside of organic goods) is going to outlive me, everything I've ever owned or used is likely still around somewhere. It is such a black hole of guilt but the impact of large corporations is not even comparable to my own consumption.

Hi everyone! My husband and I are trying to create a bit of a ""parallel play"" desk area in our living room separate from our WFH offices. This is our current set up, which is kind of uncomfortable for the second desk (lopsided, back to the room, cramped). We both use two screens and drawing tablets/external keyboards, so having enough desk space and a chair in the middle is helpful.

We're renting, so the things that can't be moved are marked in red, and we can't really remove any furniture entirely. We don't use the TV stand for a TV and usually watch things on a second screen on our desks, so a bonus would be if a desk is in front of or facing the sofa so we can easily turn the screen to watch from the couch.

I’m not being dramatic when I say it is unbearable to use the restroom for my entire shift because the smell lingers, even after spraying the heavy duty bathroom cleaner all over the seat and bowl. I will go to the men’s restroom if it’s not preoccupied, but if any of the four men we have at the store are on shift, I don’t feel comfortable using it in case they walk in not knowing I’m in there. The women’s restroom is also stocked with tampons which I need sometimes and it sucks when I can’t breathe fresh air while being in the bathroom for a prolonged time. No one has said anything to her about this to my knowledge, but I am 100% positive they smell it too because they use the men’s restroom when she works as well.

**Brief description of your current position:** Development of creative tools at FAANG company

**Degrees (including student loans):** BA from Ivy League+ school. Non-technical degree

**Background**: I wanted to go into politics when I entered college, but ended up pursuing a business-adjacent degree, mostly because that's what everyone did who wanted to work in ""business"". My talents have always been languages and reading/writing. I had no idea what I wanted to do, so my junior year I got an internship at a prestigious consulting firm and then took a full time offer after graduation. I was definitely optimizing for brand/salary right out of college instead of trying to identify what I wanted to ""do with my life"" which I think was the right decision at the time.

Salary: $85K first year, up to $100K in 1.5 years

I worked here for 1.5 years after interning during my junior year of college. I initially liked the hustle and high pressure environment. I was travelling every week Monday-Thursday, and eventually that + a very toxic work culture really wore me down and I began to look for opportunities elsewhere.

Salary: £110K (I was placed at the very top of the band as UK salaries are soooo low but I was moving from the US and wouldn't accept anything less than what I was making before).

I moved to London and began working for a FAANG company. I went into Product Marketing as it was an easy transition from consulting and I knew I wanted to think about how to position products for users. I worked on a B2B product and really loved my time on that team and learned a lot!

**Sr. PMM,** \[same company\]**;** (2020-2022, London, U.K.)

Salary: £130K

I got promoted as a PMM and started informally supporting a product team as a product manager because they didn't have one. After about 1 year of doing this, I was formally sponsored by the Director of product to formally transition internally, which required me to formally interview and pass the same interviews as external candidates do. This was extremely hard and I didn't pass the first time around, causing me to have to wait 6 months to apply again. The second time around, I passed! Product is such a hard industry to pivot into, and my recommendation to anyone looking to do it is to pivot internally in a tech company.

**Product Manager (PM), hardware product** \[same company\]; (2022, Bay Area)

Salary: $190K base + 30K bonus + 60K RSUs = 220K cash + 60K RSUs

I moved to the Bay Area for personal reasons and got a 80% pay raise. The combination of low market rates and salaries in the UK and the substantial pay increase from PMM -> PM contributed to this. I really hated working on this team (I worked on a hardware team that never shipped anything) and I also REALLY hated living in the Bay Area. Probably the most unhappy time of my life! I missed London and wanted to move back there or to NYC.

**Product Manager, Consumer Product**; (2023-Present)

Salary: $380K: $210K (base) + $50K (bonus) + $20K (relocation) + $100K vested RSUs *(promoted and joined a new team)*

I got promoted and was able to move to a competitive team internally, now working on a creative, consumer facing product. I LOVE my current role and team and really thrive in my current environment. I also moved to NYC which is much, much better than the Bay Area IMO.

**Reflection**

I do come from a privileged background in terms of going to a Ivy+ university and not having student loans. I also worked for a prestigious consulting firm and I really believe that set me up for success in terms of having a credible name on my resume and a set of really solid skills that I learned during my time there.

HOWEVER, I am a lesbian woman AND tech has no roadmap. You can't buy your way into product management, and it's a really tough industry to pivot into. What's more, once you're a PM, you are really goaled on your ability to drive results, be creative, and lead and motivate teams. I really love where I've ended up in my career; when I compare myself to other high-achieving peers, I feel like I have the right combination of high income + WLB + creativity that is really, really difficult to find.

At times in the past I've debated starting my own company or joining a startup, and can get disillusioned with big tech from time to time, especially with the way the world is right now. But ultimately, my WLB is really important to me - I have a fulfilling relationship, friends, and am close to my family. And I want a family of my own someday. And if I can get to be a Director in this company, you could be making easily $2M a year, while being able to have the flexibility to work from home and be there for your kids. That's my goal.

I run the Pride ERG at my company and also regularly give talks and am always open to having coffee chats with anyone who reaches out to me on LinkedIn. I'm a big believer that tech is such a great industry to work in but there's still so much opaqueness about how to ""break in"". I'd love to change that.

This is becoming a bigger problem now that im set to graduate college in the Spring. I grew up never really knowing what I wanted to do with my life but felt discouraged being around peers who did. I’m not just referring to a career necessarily but just something that drives their life forward. 

I’m getting a degree in journalism but still don’t feel much passion for it. I’ve thought about maybe law in intellectual property or opening my own coffee shop (I’ve met too many other people who want to do this 😭). I feel like the suggested careers for INFJ are somewhat poorly suggested. For example, a career in psych would be bad because I can get too absorbed in the emotions/experiences of others. I’m quite certain this would lead to burn out or some other undesirable circumstance. I think this is common for other INFJs so I advise everyone to be careful. The one thing I do agree on is that we oftentimes need to feel like we’re pursuing something bigger than ourselves (which is why we’re pulled to humanitarian causes/advocacy). 

Aside from career troubles, I’m not sure if the typical life path has ever appealed to me either (finding a partner, settling down, children, what everyone else does idk) 😭 I could get into that but I feel like I’ve typed too much 💀 but wow I really just lowkey be existing 🧍‍♀️",2,1738964725.0,infj,0,1.0,False

---------------------------------------------------------

Adopting a zero-waste vegan lifestyle is an impactful way to care for both your health and the planet. This approach reduces your carbon footprint while promoting sustainability. Here are some practical tips to help you embark on this journey.

### 1. Embrace Plant-Based Foods

The essence of a vegan lifestyle is consuming plant-based foods. Fill your plate with fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and nuts. Not only do these foods support your health, but they also generate less waste compared to animal products. Choose seasonal and local produce to further reduce your footprint. By eating what's in season, you're supporting local farmers and minimizing transportation emissions.

### 2. Buy in Bulk

Buying in bulk is a fantastic way to reduce packaging waste. Seek stores that offer bulk bins where you can fill your own reusable containers. This practice not only saves money but also cuts down on excess plastic. Consider stocking up on grains, beans, nuts, and spices. Carry small containers or cloth bags when grocery shopping, so you're always prepared.

### 3. Reduce Food Waste at Home

Food waste is a big issue in the modern world. To minimize this, plan your meals ahead of time. Make a list before heading to the store to avoid impulse buys that could end up as leftovers. Here are a few additional tips:

- Store food properly to extend its shelf life.
- Use leftover veggies in soups or stir-fries.
- Freeze anything you won’t eat immediately, so it doesn't go to waste.

### 4. Composting

Composting is an eco-friendly method to handle organic waste. Instead of throwing vegetable scraps and peels in the trash, create a compost pile. Over time, these scraps turn into nutrient-rich soil for your garden. You can start with a small compost bin in your kitchen, where you add food scraps, coffee grounds, and eggshells. For outdoor composting, consider using a larger bin to accommodate garden waste as well.

### 5. Choose Eco-friendly Products

Switching to eco-friendly household products is vital in a zero-waste lifestyle. Opt for items with minimal or no packaging. Look for brands that emphasize sustainability and use materials that can be composted or recycled. Some simple swaps include:

- Use beeswax wraps instead of plastic wrap.
- Invest in a stainless-steel water bottle instead of single-use plastic bottles.
- Choose bar soap instead of liquid soap in plastic containers.

### 6. Grow Your Own Food

If you have space, growing your own fruits and vegetables is both rewarding and sustainable. Starting a small garden can significantly reduce the need for store-bought produce, cutting down on packaging and transportation waste. You don’t need a massive yard; even a few pots on your balcony can yield fresh herbs or vegetables. Growing food at home also ensures that you're consuming organic produce without plastic waste.

### 7. Educate and Advocate

Being part of a zero-waste vegan community can amplify your impact. Share your knowledge with friends and family. Encourage them to adopt sustainable practices by sharing tips and experiences. You can also advocate for local businesses that support eco-friendly practices or participate in community cleanups. The more people involved, the greater the collective change toward a sustainable future.

By incorporating these practical tips into your daily life, you can embrace a zero-waste vegan lifestyle that benefits not only yourself but also the planet. It's time to take small steps toward making a bigger difference. Remember, every effort counts!

The Environmental Impact of Veganism and Zero-Waste Practices
-------------------------------------------------------------

Adopting a vegan lifestyle paired with zero-waste practices can significantly reduce your environmental impact. The choices we make every day affect the planet, and understanding these effects can empower you to make changes that promote sustainability. Here are some insights into how veganism and zero-waste practices can work hand in hand to create a healthier environment for all.

-Get access to the Ultimate Vegan Cookbook package here--&gt; https://hownow101.com/vegan-recipes  
### The Carbon Footprint of Diet Choices

Diet plays a crucial role in determining our carbon footprint. Animal agriculture is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. By choosing a vegan diet, you help lower the demand for meat and dairy products, which in turn reduces CO2 emissions. According to studies, removing animal products from your diet can cut your personal greenhouse gas emissions by up to 73%.

### Water and Land Usage

Raising animals for food requires vast amounts of water and land. In contrast, plant-based foods generally require significantly fewer resources. For instance:

- Producing a pound of beef requires about 1,800 gallons of water.
- Conversely, producing a pound of vegetables needs only around 39 gallons.
- A vegan diet can conserve water by avoiding resource-intensive meat production.

Additionally, plant-based diets contribute to less land degradation because less land is needed for crops that feed livestock. This means that adopting a vegan diet not only helps in conserving forests but also fosters biodiversity.

### Waste Reduction through Conscious Consumption

Zero-waste practices emphasize the importance of reducing, reusing, and recycling materials. When combined with a vegan lifestyle, you can further diminish waste in the following ways:

-Get access to the Ultimate Vegan Cookbook package here--&gt; https://hownow101.com/vegan-recipes  
- **Buying in Bulk:** Purchase grains, nuts, and legumes from bulk bins to avoid excess packaging.
- **Using Reusable Containers:** Use glass jars and beeswax wraps for food storage instead of single-use plastics.
- **Composting:** Create compost from vegetable scraps and plant-based leftovers, enriching your soil while reducing landfill waste.

By being mindful of packaging and food waste, you can contribute to a circular economy that promotes sustainability.

### Supporting Local and Sustainable Producers

Many vegan options are available, but how they are produced matters. Opting for local plant-based foods can help cut down on transportation emissions and support your community. Here's how to choose wisely:

- **Know Your Farmers:** Visit farmers' markets to buy directly from local growers. This not only supports sustainable practices but also allows you to learn more about how the food is produced.
- **Choose Organic:** Organic farming avoids harmful pesticides and promotes biodiversity, which benefits the environment.
- **Grow Your Own Food:** Try starting a garden at home. Even a small herb garden can reduce dependence on store-bought produce that comes in plastic packaging.

### Seasonal Eating

Eating in season is another simple way to reduce your ecological footprint. Seasonal produce usually requires less energy to grow and transport. It’s also fresher and often more affordable. Here are some benefits of seasonal eating:

- **Lower Carbon Emissions:** Food grown in the right season doesn’t require energy-intensive hot houses or greenhouses.
- **Better Taste and Nutrition:** Seasonal fruits and vegetables tend to be more flavorful and nutrient-dense, as they ripen naturally.

### Community Engagement and Education

Engaging with your community and spreading awareness about veganism and zero-waste practices can amplify the impact of your efforts. Participate in local events or workshops, share recipes, or collaborate with others who are interested in sustainable living. This active involvement can create a larger network of people committed to reducing their environmental footprint.

-Get access to the Ultimate Vegan Cookbook package here--&gt; https://hownow101.com/vegan-recipes  
Ultimately, the combination of adopting a vegan diet and zero-waste principles can lead to significant environmental benefits. By being mindful of your choices and their impacts, you not only contribute to personal health but also foster a more sustainable planet for future generations. Every little action counts, and together, we can create a ripple effect of positive change.

### Conclusion

Adopting a zero-waste vegan lifestyle is a powerful way to contribute positively to our planet while promoting personal health and well-being. By implementing practical tips such as composting kitchen scraps, using reusable containers, and shopping in bulk, you can significantly reduce your environmental footprint. Each small change you make, like replacing plastic bags with cloth ones or choosing local produce, echoes a larger commitment to sustainability. This is not just about minimizing waste; it’s about fostering a deeper connection with the food you consume and the earth that supports you.

The combined impact of veganism and zero-waste practices cannot be overstated. Animal farming is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and water scarcity. Transitioning to a plant-based diet not only alleviates these issues but also empowers you to make choices that promote environmental stewardship. Pairing this diet with zero-waste habits ensures you are taking full advantage of the benefits while actively participating in the movement to protect our earth.

With each meal, you have the power to make a statement. Whether you’re choosing sustainable ingredients or reducing packaging waste, you are part of a growing community dedicated to making the world a cleaner, greener place. Embrace these tips and watch how your lifestyle changes not only benefit you but also inspire those around you. By incorporating these practices, you’re not just reducing your footprint—you’re paving the way for a healthier planet for future generations. Remember, every small action counts, and your commitment can lead to meaningful, lasting change.",1,1738964464.0,EasyVegan,0,1.0,False

I’m 23, living in Kent UK and feeling a bit lost in life. I’m not sure what direction to take and don’t really have anyone to ask for advice. I want to feel achieved, leave my mark on the world, and of course, earn a living. Here’s a bit about me:
	•	I graduated in 2022 with a degree in Industrial Design but haven’t done much design work since.
	•	My previous jobs include working in an acrylic-making factory, co-owning a coffee trailer, and waitressing, and in lockdown I started a 3D printing and Vinyl business for small accessories and personalised products. 
	•	I currently live at home with my family, which I’m happy with for now. My mum had a stroke just over a year ago, so I’ve been caring for her, and my parents have been financially supporting me (I’m super grateful for them).
	•	I’d love to own a business someday rather than work for someone else, but I don’t know what kind of business that should be. I’ve enjoyed the business ventures I’ve tried so far. 
	•	I enjoy design, but my drawing skills aren’t great. I do love working with tools like Fusion 360 and Adobe Illustrator. I feel like I’m “okay” at a lot of things but not excellent at any one thing.
	•	I love hands-on work like model-making and prototyping which is definitely in some of my hobbies like puzzles, Lego, and Rokr sets.
	•	I’m passionate about mental health. My final university project was a bench concept designed to encourage conversation without the pressure of eye contact—it’s still one of my proudest creations and the model still sits on my shelf. 
	•	I also enjoy cooking, being outdoors, hiking, and geocaching, it’d be great to merge some of my hobbies into a business. 

I’ve been considering starting a graphic design business, but I feel like I’d need to learn a lot more before feeling confident. I’ve done some logos and posters here and there, but I’m worried my creativity isn’t strong enough to stand out. I’ve also thought about selling digital products, but I want whatever I do to feel meaningful and empowering. But I’m definitely happy to do an online course, learn further, but I am worried I have massive creative block. Then I feel like it’s such a competitive market I want stand a chance!

Another idea I’ve had is creating my own cookbook. I love cooking and have always enjoyed the idea of designing a beautiful, creative cookbook. But, again, I feel like I’m not good enough—both in terms of recipes and design—to pull it off successfully.

Right now, I need to stay close to home to care for my mum, so that limits my options a bit. I’d really appreciate any advice, feedback, or ideas on what direction I could take—whether it’s starting a business, taking another course, or just figuring out my next steps.

Thanks so much for reading, I’m aware this definitely sounds like a lot of imposter syndrome. I just don’t have anyone to talk to for any sense of direction! Any help is hugely appreciated x",1,1738964296.0,careerguidance,0,1.0,False

We’ve been together for three years now. She loves me, and I love her. No issues there.

Now comes my childhood friend 20F—we’ll call her G. We’ve been good friends since childhood and became closer after 10th.

Recently, our school friends planned a trip to a waterpark. There were 5 boys and 7 girls, and G was one of them.

To get to the waterpark, we traveled by passenger train. Our seats weren’t together, so we got separated. There were two compartments—6 seats in each. In my compartment, there was a set of 2 seats at one end and 4 at the other.

I took one of the 2 seats and asked my friend (M) to sit next to me, but G said, “Nah, I’m sitting there.”

I said, “Okay,” and M was fine with it too.

She sat next to me and asked, “Do you have any movies on your phone?”

I said, “Yep.” Luckily, I had 500 Days of Summer downloaded, so we started watching it, sharing my earphones.

After some time, our friends called us to take photos. We followed them to the next compartment.

G said, “I’m feeling sleepy. I’m going back to our seat.”

I said, “Okay, I’ll come with you.” I thought I’d just give her company.

When we got back, she said, “I’m sleeping. Let’s watch the movie on the way back home.”

I said, “Okay.”

Then she hugged my arm and rested her head on my shoulder. I was shocked and uncomfortable, but I thought, “It’s not a big deal.” She’s a good friend, so I let it be.

She stayed like that for at least an hour.

When she woke up, we talked about random things and laughed a lot. After reaching the waterpark, she didn’t leave my side the entire time.

On the way back, our seats weren’t confirmed, so we stood for about 30 minutes before getting seats. They weren’t together, so I was sitting with another girl.

After some time, the girl checked her phone and said, “Ale, message me. I’ll be back in a minute.”

I said, “Okay.”

She went to G, who was sitting nearby, and exchanged seats with her.

G came back and sat beside me again. I asked, “What happened to her?”

G said, “Nothing. She just wanted the window seat.”

I said, “Okay.”

Later, an earring seller entered our compartment. I said to G, “Can you help me buy an earring for my girlfriend?”

She said, “Okay.” She helped me choose a pair, then said, “Only for her?” with a smirk.

I said, “Help me pick one more,” and gave it to her. It wasn’t expensive, and I thought, “Why not?”

She was happy. I told her to put both pairs in her bag and give them to me when we got off the train. She said, “Okay.”

We reached our station, and I forgot to take the earrings from her.

I messaged her, and she said, “I’ll give them to you when we meet next time.”

Two days later, she messaged me, “You busy?”

I said, “Bol na.”

She said, “Up for a date tomorrow?” Then quickly added, “Jk, jk. You want the earrings back, right?”

I said, “Yep.”

She said, “Sharp 9 at Nerul station.”

I said, “Okay.”

When we met, she said, “I forgot the earrings at home. Sorry.”

I said, “It’s okay. Now what?”

She said, “I know a place if you’re not busy.”

I thought, “Alright, shit happens,” and agreed.

She took me to a cafe. We had coffee and something to eat.

After that, she said, “I want to sit somewhere. Do you have time?”

I said, “Yep.”

She said, “Let’s go to Jewels.”

We went to Jewels, a famous couple hangout spot in Nerul, and sat there for about an hour.

I said, “Let’s go home.”

She said, “Okay, but you want the earrings, right?”

I said, “Yes.”

She said, “Let’s go to my house. I’ll give you the earrings, and then you can go.”

She added, “There’s no one at home.”

I said, “Okay.”

When we reached her building, I said, “Bring the earrings here. I’ll wait.”

She said, “Why? Let’s go upstairs na?”

I said, “It’s getting late, and I have things to do. I can’t.”

She said, “Okay.”

After that, she brought the earrings down and gave them to me.


---

After all that, I started ignoring her. She asked me to hang out 3–4 times, but I avoided her until today.

Yesterday, she messaged me saying she was bored and asked if I was up for hanging out. I said, “Okay.”

We met at 9 today. I didn’t realize it was Rose Day, and my girlfriend isn’t into Valentine’s Week stuff, so I didn’t think much of it.

When we met she gave me a rose.

I said, “What’s this?”

She said, “Don’t you know? Today is Rose Day. I don’t have anyone else to give a rose to, so I’m giving it to you.” She smiled.

I didn’t know what to say, so I accepted the rose and smiled back. She looked happy and practically hugged me.

We walked, talked for an hour, and then I told her, “I have to go.”

Now I’m home and can’t stop thinking about everything.


---

The issue is:

1. Is G into me?


2. I think I might like her too, but I also love my girlfriend.


3. What should I do? I don’t want to hurt anyone.


4. What if G confesses her feelings?

1ik6a8w,https://www.reddit.com/r/chubbytravel/comments/1ik6a8w/review_four_seasons_oahu_a_public_mea_culpa/,REVIEW: Four Seasons Oahu – A Public Mea Culpa,"First, a huge shoutout to Liz at SpringboardTravel.com

We booked the two lowest room categories (garden view and resort view) and both got upgraded to partial ocean view rooms. In reality, these are full ocean view rooms—just not overlooking the lagoon. I actually preferred our view, looking west toward the mountains, which felt more private and serene. Liz came through big time.

**Some context upfront:**

I’ve stayed at a fair number of Four Seasons, mostly city hotels. They’re usually very good, sometimes great, but I’ve never felt like they were worth the 2-3x premium over solid alternatives. Especially at resorts, where the prices are often eye-watering, I’ve always been skeptical of the hype—both here and on r/FATtravel.

I figured Four Seasons was just the default answer people gave when they didn’t know the real hidden gems in a destination.

So I gave u/alex_travels a lot of shit for the constant FS recs around here. Though all in good fun! 

Also, I should mention—we’re not really resort people. We tend to favor cities or more adventure-driven trips. This was actually our first true multi-day beach resort stay, so I don’t have a deep well of comparisons. Take that for what it’s worth.

We traveled as a family of five across two rooms: my wife and I with our 3-year-old, plus grandma and grandpa in the other room. 

**Service: Frictionless Perfection**

From the moment we arrived, everything was seamless. We’ve stayed at plenty of Ritz-Carltons, where service can sometimes feel a little stiff or overly performative. Here, it was relaxed but razor-sharp—attentive without being intrusive.

Requests through the app? Almost instant. In-room coffee order? Minutes. Poolside and beach service? Immediate. Housekeeping? Always perfectly timed. It felt effortless.

Over four days, we only had two minor service issues. At Mina’s Fish House, my cocktail took a few minutes longer than expected. The server apologized profusely and comped the drink. Another time, I ordered a double espresso from room service and got a single instead. I messaged in the app, and the proper double espresso arrived in **less than two minutes.** 

That level of responsiveness is pretty unreal.

**Rooms: Nothing Flashy, But Everything We Wanted**

The hard product is solid—not over-the-top, but comfortable, well-designed, and exactly what we needed. As always, the Four Seasons bed was perfection. Cozy, plush, just right.

The huge lanai with a lounger was the ideal morning coffee spot. Could always see humpbacks splashing in the distance. 

Bathrooms were spacious, spotless, and functional. 

And for families, the kids’ amenities were a thoughtful touch—sponge letters, bubble bath, and a little turtle stuffed animal. Small things, but they make big a difference.

**Food: Consistently Excellent**

Every meal was legitimately delicious. Poolside dining, the breakfast buffet, room service, and Mina’s—everything we had was well-executed and on point. No resort tax on quality here.

**Kid-Friendly Done Right**

One of the biggest surprises was how kid-friendly the resort is. It’s right next to Aulani, so you can do the Disney Luau or character breakfast next door and get a taste of Disney without actually staying at a Disney resort. 

The lagoon is perfect for kids—calm, no waves, and packed with floaties and toys. The family pool is also heated, which is a huge win for cooler evenings.

The kids club is awesome. Koi ponds all over. Lots of arts and crafts. Staff super friendly to the littles. 

Plus seals and turtles on the beach nearby. Humpbacks blowing in the distance. So fun!

**The Vibe: Empty Resort = Even Better Experience**

One factor that really elevated this experience? The resort was maybe half full. Early February, post-holiday lull—chairs everywhere, no crowds, often the only ones at the pool. See pic. It added this extra level of peace and exclusivity that made everything feel even more seamless.

**Final Take: Lesson Learned**

We stayed at Ritz-Carlton Mandapa in Bali last spring. Objectively, the hard product there is better—it’s a stunning property. But the service and overall experience at Four Seasons Oahu was better. And Mandapa is widely considered the pinnacle of the global Ritz-Carlton portfolio.

So yeah, I guess I’ve learned that even the “worst” Four Seasons in Hawaii is better than the best Ritz-Carlton in the world.

To my friend Alex—lesson learned. 

This is my public mea culpa. Lol.

It wasn’t well received. At all. She made a huge deal out of it and started going off about how Valentine’s gifts should be romantic. She called me cheap (even though it was a $130 value). I tried explaining my logic— a gift like flowers die, but TurboTax lasts a fiscal year- which she didn't seem to grasp.

I think a big problem was that it was a license code, so there was nothing to physically wrap. I think that made it feel even less like a “real” gift to her. I was also planning to surprise her with a cute coffee mug after, but she walked out before I even got the chance.

The games I know he will for sure play are Fortnite, Minecraft, farming simulator, and some gold mining game. 

I want to get something that he can play these on, but can also handle a few other games and I won’t have to buy a better one in the next couple years.  I definitely need to stay below $1000 but ideally, I would like to stay as close to the $500 mark as I can for just the tower since I have to buy the other stuff for it. However, I obviously know that money is a big factor in getting something that is actually worth it so just need some options.

Can anyone post some links of some pre built computers that would work for him? 


Also, I came across this local person who builds them and seems like the pricing is pretty good. Like I said, I’m flying blind here, so I was wondering if any of these are worth it or would work.

I hardly watch anything else. However the internet as of late has been a bit cursed and I want to be online less without having to cancel out enjoyment of this show's beautiful creations. 

What if there was a series by Kurzgesagt? Volumes of graphic print coffee-table books, like of different themes taken from their playlists? For example, the existential dread volume, the space volume, the creature and organism volume, the dino volume, the silly questions (elephant falling from building, planet turned to gold, etc) volume, the nuke volume (i.e. everything to do with nuclear bombs, what if we detonated a hundred nukes at once, etc), the health, body, immune system volume. I would fork over all of my money for those to have on my shelf.

I am growing anxious that we will lose access to informative media altogether due to the current state of our politics and how much control oligarchs have over our media now. We own less and less, we have to pay more and more to subscribe to things so we don't have to be inundated with ads, or even just to use the printer in some cases. I treasure books, because they belong to us and no one else once we have them. (Unless it's the library but you know what I mean).

Bonus brownie points for you, if you know where that's from!

To give you due warning, this advert is pretty long. I suggest getting a cup of tea or coffee, and to make yourself comfortable!

So, where to begin? Why don't I begin with some basic introductions! I am a 23 year old roleplayer hailing from the dark, mysterious lands, also known as Eastern Europe. To be more specific, I come from Poland, which at the moment situates me in the CET time zone. I have been doing this hobby for about half my life at this point, and while I have only made a switch to English a couple years back, I still consider myself decent! Other than writing, be it solo- or collaborative, I also love tea, j-RPGs, anime, fantasy novels, as well as anything that happens to be furry and walks on four legs!

A very important thing to know about me is that I love a good OOC connection, and on my end, it's pretty much requirement!

Yes, it does mean that I wish to, eventually, befriend my writing partners! It is not just that, though. The thing is that the whole OOC chatter around the story, the fan-girling, discussing the what-ifs, laughing about it, making memes, even mocking tense and sad story moments are what makes half of the fun of the hobby for me! If all of this sounds like grueling nonsense to you, I can say with certainty that the two of us will not work together very well. If what I've said however sounds amazing, then that's great, and we may be able to create some wonderful magic together!

So, that's it as far as introductions! Before I carry on further, I must get a few things out of the way, first!

1. Please be at least 20 years old of age, or older.
2. I require a reply rate of at least **once** per day, and the ability to regularly post more often is appreciated as well as preferred. Real life always comes first, but if you know that what I've just asked for is going to be a problem, then I am not the right writing partner for you.
3. I write exclusively on Discord. At the moment, I am not interested in trying alternative sites.
4. I refuse to use face claims of any kind. That said, reference images for objects, buildings, weapons and monsters are something I am much more agreeable to!
5. Explicit content, the way the term is typically understood, is unlikely. I much prefer fade-to-black. If you message me from a dedicated NFSW account, you will be rejected on the spot no matter what.

Okay, that would be all! Now, why don't I actually move to my preferences so far as the actual roleplay is concerned?

So, the most important thing about me about a roleplayer is that I always, in a manner of speaking, come empty-handed. Why? That's simple! I want to come up with everything within the story, be it the plot, the characters, the lore, the entire world they're in, and pretty much everything else **together** with my writing partner! The main exception to that rule are mainly monsters and some other fantastical creatures, that I may, or may not outright steal from mythology, video games, DnD or other sorts of fiction! This isn't a perfect approach, and definitely not an approach that would work for everyone. Still, I do not believe in perfect, and that is what works for me!

Which also means that, no, I will not be very interested if you already have an intricate plot or world of your own. If you do, I wish you the absolute best with it, but that's just not what I am looking for!

Now, I have mentioned that I want to write a story in an urban fantasy... but what *is* urban fantasy to me?

Simple! By that I mean a world, where the existence of magic, and any possible fantastical elements, is not something hidden from the 'muggles', where it isn't considered inherently separate from technology, and instead, for both to often be combined, as well as intertwined together! Pretty much, what I want could be summed up with this sentence: imagine your traditional medieval fantasy world, and then imagine it's gone through an industrial revolution. Now, *how* advanced our possible world is, that is very much up to discussion! As long as it's at least reached the steam engine, I am more than happy to brainstorm and discuss!

I should mention that at least at the moment, I *really* do not want to write a medieval fantasy.

That said, I still tend to utilize a great deal of storytelling tropes and plot devices you would see in a medieval fantasy story. I just often put a more modern spin on them! My ideal story would still feature a ragtag group of companions that travel together from to town, while braving through dungeons, undergoing quests, interacting with a whole ensemble cast, facing many dangerous antagonists, while a greater, terrifying threat looms from over the horizon! Just like in many medieval fantasy epics. The thing is, I just want all that to happen in a world that has working trains, electricity, cars, supermarkets, and quite possibly social media! The actual tone and dominant themes are something that I would like to discuss together, but over-all, I just love epic fantasy with major stakes!

(Though, at the moment, I will not consider military and/or police settings as the main backdrop for the story!)

A thing I may want devote yet another paragraph on is action. I absolutely love action, and it's pretty much a requirement that my writing partners feel the same! That said, my approach to it is neither realistic nor grounded. To put it like this... while most of my characters wouldn't be any more than just cannon fodder in the very overpowered universes (like the Invincible or Dragon Ball), they would still be considered OP by the standards of grounded, realistic settings. Things such as swordsmen cutting through modern armed soldiers by the dozens, dodging and parrying of actual bullets, and characters that fight on in spite of grievous injuries are all par of the course! So, before you consider reaching, make sure that what I've just said is up your alley!

Now, as for the characters! I have already mentioned my love for ensemble casts, and for this reason, the ability to create characters that differ by age\*, gender, romantic orientation, social background, moral alignment, and more, is absolutely essential! Is it a tall order? Perhaps, but I promise the same on my end! When it comes to my lead character in particular, we'll see. The only thing that's certain is that she'll be a woman, which I also require for your own character. I also, generally speaking, prefer to write characters from their late 20s to their mid 30s. While playing young adults isn't necessarily off the table, I cannot promise I can be convinced to go down that road!

\*That said, most of the cast should be at least 21+ of age, if not 25+ outright.

As for romance, while I have a hard requirement for FxF for the main pairing, I still prefer writing partners willing and able to write all three basic gender combinations. By that I mean, obviously, FxM, MxM, and of course, FxF! Why? That's simple! I love variety, and I don't find it particularly realistic, nor immersive, when it's just a single kind of pairing over and over!

That said, while I do not outright require that our lead characters have to be romantically involved, I really am not the partner for you if you dislike writing romance in general.

I would also like to list some things that I do not want in my roleplays:

Fandoms, overt/excessive fluff/grimdark, sanitized/whitewashed depictions of groups widely known to be immoral/violent/corrupt, romanticized abuse, enemies-to-lovers (for the main pair), slice-of-life (as the main plot), werewolf and vampire plots, standard fantasy races, isekai, romance as the main plot, toxic masculine characters, comedy as the main genre, settings based off the real world (like in Marvel, HP or Percy Jackson), arranged marriage, school settings, protagonists of the evil moral alignment

Do not hesitate to ask, if you would like some elaboration on any one of these!

In truth, there's very, *very* few storytelling tropes and conventions that I refuse to make use of no matter what. Such as, I do not dislike either vampires, or were-creatures. I do, however, dislike settings where vampires and werewolves are the *only* fantastical elements, much less the only fantastical creatures, or if there's little of those besides them. Now that said, the ones listed above are what I *usually* dislike in fiction, and I figured the list may be useful to save at least some of you some time!

Now, while I **do not** write in fandoms anymore, there is a fair amount of fiction I tend to draw quite a lot of inspiration from! Examples would include:

Final Fantasy series (in particular VI, VII, X and XV), Fullmetal Alchemist (this is a big one!). Inuyasha, the Witcher series, Avatar: The Last Airbender (as well as Legend of Korra!), Vinland Saga, the Mistborn series, and Monster (the odd one out here!),

The list is in a *somewhat* descending order of importance. Of course, this isn't by any means the full extent of the fiction that I like! Absolutely not! I have, however, noticed that those are the pieces of fiction I am most likely to draw inspiration from, either on purpose, or subconsciously! If you like more than three positions on the list, then I feel there's good chance that we may vibe together quite well! However, I should say that while it is just my very limited personal experience, it's never worked out for me with anyone who was completely unfamiliar with any of the fandoms listed above. Especially when it comes to the first half of the list. So, if that's the case with you, approach at your own peril!

So! In regards to my storytelling preferences, I feel all that this should about suffice!

As for the *actual* writing, allow me to put it this way: I definitely like to have a decent amount of meat around the bone. Still, neither I do not believe in word quotas, nor do I believe in padding to fill said quotas. I don't really believe in labels all that much either, but if I must use one, then it'd be **advanced literate**. Typically, my replies tend to average between 400 and 800 words (don't ask me how much is it in paragraphs, I don't speak paragraph), but depending on the scene's need and scale, they can get longer. A lot longer. As for the more beautiful, flowery sort of language, I believe it is a lot like salt when used in cooking. Absolutely amazing in moderation, but not so much if you dump a whole kilogram into the pot! Oh, and I write exclusively in third person and past tense, and I expect the same of my partners, too.

I will happily provide a writing sample upon request in direct messages!

So, this should probably it!

This whole advert is a looot longer than it could have been, so kudos to you, if you've actually read the whole thing!

On the flip side, if you only skimmed through it, I recommend that you go back and read it in full anyway. This whole thing is long as #@%\^&!, but it is such for a reason, as a lot of the things I've talked about are potential deal-breakers and compatibility issues. At the end of the day, would you rather waste ten minutes of your time, or a whole week, if not more? Do take your pick!

Now, when you message me, please remember it is not a race! I typically tend to take my time rather than answer the very first person that messages me. What I do want to know is how I may call you, what is your age, your pronouns, your timezone (as well as country, if you feel comfortable sharing!), any potential story triggers (or just tropes you really, REALLY prefer to avoid!) and most importantly of all, a starting pitch for a story! This advert doesn't provide anything concrete, so don't worry, I am not asking for much! All I really want is a starting point for us to start plotting! You may as well tell me about a particular storytelling trope that you enjoy, or a character dynamic you've been wanting to explore for a while! I should also mention that while I will want to move to Discord eventually, I do typically prefer to stay here, before actually moving on. Oh, and it doesn't really matter whether you use Reddit Chat or Reddit PMs! Either channel works just as fine!

Sooo... this is everything!

It's time to get rid of our oversized couch and redo our living room. I'm hoping this wonderful community can help us figure out some furniture and placement to maximize the space we have. We already plan to move the TV from above the mantel and aren't settled on where and what relation it should be to some couches and chairs.. some additional thoughts below. 

We have a great glass mid century coffee table stored that we hope to be  using again now that our youngest has outgrown the play area (which will also be removed). 

We have two more of the walnut bookshelves pictured that could be used. 

We plan on filling all the wall space with art that we have collected over the years. 

We have a few mismatched table lamps that could also be used. 

The fishtank can easily be removed or moved. 

Total budget is likely around 2500. Possibly a little more depending on suggestions.

I'm looking for an AO3 fic I read last Christmas (2023) but was probably posted before then.

Brief summary: Mycroft likes Greg but his job effectively forbids relationships so he takes him to an island to have sex and get him out of his system but they're interrupted, Greg agrees to go through the awful process of getting an official relationship (and it is a horrible, intrusive process) but then I think they're denied, Mycroft quits his job and they both go to Paris (?).

  
Longer, more detailed summary:

\- Mycroft is at the annual Christmas party, a little tipsy on Mrs Hudson's punch, and talks to Greg. Finding him more interesting than he had expected, and more attractive, there is mild flirting but M tries to stay unattached. G kisses him before he gets in his car to go home.

\- M can't stop thinking about him. Also it's January and everyone's miserable and cold. He thinks about how he can manage this. He knows it's rare that couples make it through the officiating process within his job, because the government has to screen everyone and they try to make it hard in order to dissuade people from attempting it in the first place. He comes up with a plan: Take G to an island and have sex with him for a week. He has so much holiday leave, and technically flings are allowed as long as they're not romantic, so even though he has romantic feelings for G, as long as he doesn't say that out loud, he's not technically breaking the rules.

  
\- He explains to G that this is the only way of them ever hooking up and Greg eventually agrees to go with him.

  
\- The island is glorious and they have a lot of sex. Some involving feeding each other fruit. Some tender moments on beaches and some celebrity invites them to his weird sex party. M is slightly jealous + it's cute. 

  
\- They're interrupted before their full stay is up. Someone punches G. The woman who oversees the relationship process has been spying on them. M, angry, tells her that he has no romantic feelings for G and just wanted to have some fun. He and G are now no longer allowed to see each other.

  
\- They meet in a coffee shop and M explains how the relationship process works. G agrees to it. It's awful. The woman has a recording of M saying he's not even into G and plays it to him but G is secure in M's feelings and it doesn't sway him. They get through the process but their application is denied. M is very angry and shouts a lot, resigning and taking G away. 

\- They're in a hotel room in Paris (I think it's Paris) and the credits roll.

I am considering adjusting my regular work day to start between 3 & 4 in the morning. I am curious.... Any other IT professional types find success in alternate working times managing their focus and mental organization? If applicable, do you prefer it in order to help to manage focus without the need of adhd medications?


Context - Optional:

Hello. I am not necessarily a programmer but this was the closest sub I could find  for people I can relate to. I am a 15+ year IT Professional, am currently salaried as a VDI Implementations Engineer and I work remotely from home... I do write scripts and work in cli frequently, so I'm not too far of an outcast in that respect.

Aside from reporting on time with expectations of billable productive hours worked in a week/month, showing positive results and attending needed meetings or responding during priorities while on call, they absolutely do not care that you stick to FIXED work hours every day but ask to stick to generic business day schedules between 7-5pm. But that's flexible as we can without question step away early or get on late if we have something that specifically needs to be done after hours, like patching, maintenence or major changes.

I personally have found in my current role that I'm able to better control my focus during the wee hours in the morning. I am 99% certain my ADHD gets out of my control due to constantly having lines of communication open during business hours and having to switch gears to read/react upon emails or internal chat messages. So when everyone else is still sleeping and I can hop on in silence, my ability to keep hold on my focus and succeed in completing my actual job tasks is drastically improved. I can definitely get more done in 4 hours than I can in 8 during daylight. I only do this occasionally but I am really starting to like it more, each time I do.

Plus... I'm kind of a night owl. And there's something peaceful about taking a 30 minute break right before first light and having a coffee/smoke as the sun comes up and listening to the birds report back to base, hoping that today is the day the empire conquers all. It reminds me to keep working on my doomsday preparations and bird attack defense procedures in my spare time.

Bonus brownie points for you, if you know where that's from!

To give you due warning, this advert is pretty long. I suggest getting a cup of tea or coffee, and to make yourself comfortable!

So, where to begin? Why don't I begin with some basic introductions! I am a 23 year old roleplayer hailing from the dark, mysterious lands, also known as Eastern Europe. To be more specific, I come from Poland, which at the moment situates me in the CET time zone. I have been doing this hobby for about half my life at this point, and while I have only made a switch to English a couple years back, I still consider myself decent! Other than writing, be it solo- or collaborative, I also love tea, j-RPGs, anime, fantasy novels, as well as anything that happens to be furry and walks on four legs!

A very important thing to know about me is that I love a good OOC connection, and on my end, it's pretty much requirement!

Yes, it does mean that I wish to, eventually, befriend my writing partners! It is not just that, though. The thing is that the whole OOC chatter around the story, the fan-girling, discussing the what-ifs, laughing about it, making memes, even mocking tense and sad story moments are what makes half of the fun of the hobby for me! If all of this sounds like grueling nonsense to you, I can say with certainty that the two of us will not work together very well. If what I've said however sounds amazing, then that's great, and we may be able to create some wonderful magic together!

So, that's it as far as introductions! Before I carry on further, I must get a few things out of the way, first!

1. Please be at least 20 years old of age, or older.
2. I require a reply rate of at least **once** per day, and the ability to regularly post more often is appreciated as well as preferred. Real life always comes first, but if you know that what I've just asked for is going to be a problem, then I am not the right writing partner for you.
3. I write exclusively on Discord. At the moment, I am not interested in trying alternative sites.
4. I refuse to use face claims of any kind. That said, reference images for objects, buildings, weapons and monsters are something I am much more agreeable to!
5. Explicit content, the way the term is typically understood, is unlikely. I much prefer fade-to-black. If you message me from a dedicated NFSW account, you will be rejected on the spot no matter what.

Okay, that would be all! Now, why don't I actually move to my preferences so far as the actual roleplay is concerned?

So, the most important thing about me about a roleplayer is that I always, in a manner of speaking, come empty-handed. Why? That's simple! I want to come up with everything within the story, be it the plot, the characters, the lore, the entire world they're in, and pretty much everything else **together** with my writing partner! The main exception to that rule are mainly monsters and some other fantastical creatures, that I may, or may not outright steal from mythology, video games, DnD or other sorts of fiction! This isn't a perfect approach, and definitely not an approach that would work for everyone. Still, I do not believe in perfect, and that is what works for me!

Which also means that, no, I will not be very interested if you already have an intricate plot or world of your own. If you do, I wish you the absolute best with it, but that's just not what I am looking for!

Now, I have mentioned that I want to write a story in an urban fantasy... but what *is* urban fantasy to me?

Simple! By that I mean a world, where the existence of magic, and any possible fantastical elements, is not something hidden from the 'muggles', where it isn't considered inherently separate from technology, and instead, for both to often be combined, as well as intertwined together! Pretty much, what I want could be summed up with this sentence: imagine your traditional medieval fantasy world, and then imagine it's gone through an industrial revolution. Now, *how* advanced our possible world is, that is very much up to discussion! As long as it's at least reached the steam engine, I am more than happy to brainstorm and discuss!

I should mention that at least at the moment, I *really* do not want to write a medieval fantasy.

That said, I still tend to utilize a great deal of storytelling tropes and plot devices you would see in a medieval fantasy story. I just often put a more modern spin on them! My ideal story would still feature a ragtag group of companions that travel together from to town, while braving through dungeons, undergoing quests, interacting with a whole ensemble cast, facing many dangerous antagonists, while a greater, terrifying threat looms from over the horizon! Just like in many medieval fantasy epics. The thing is, I just want all that to happen in a world that has working trains, electricity, cars, supermarkets, and quite possibly social media! The actual tone and dominant themes are something that I would like to discuss together, but over-all, I just love epic fantasy with major stakes!

(Though, at the moment, I will not consider military and/or police settings as the main backdrop for the story!)

A thing I may want devote yet another paragraph on is action. I absolutely love action, and it's pretty much a requirement that my writing partners feel the same! That said, my approach to it is neither realistic nor grounded. To put it like this... while most of my characters wouldn't be any more than just cannon fodder in the very overpowered universes (like the Invincible or Dragon Ball), they would still be considered OP by the standards of grounded, realistic settings. Things such as swordsmen cutting through modern armed soldiers by the dozens, dodging and parrying of actual bullets, and characters that fight on in spite of grievous injuries are all par of the course! So, before you consider reaching, make sure that what I've just said is up your alley!

Now, as for the characters! I have already mentioned my love for ensemble casts, and for this reason, the ability to create characters that differ by age\*, gender, romantic orientation, social background, moral alignment, and more, is absolutely essential! Is it a tall order? Perhaps, but I promise the same on my end! When it comes to my lead character in particular, we'll see. The only thing that's certain is that she'll be a woman, which I also require for your own character. I also, generally speaking, prefer to write characters from their late 20s to their mid 30s. While playing young adults isn't necessarily off the table, I cannot promise I can be convinced to go down that road!

\*That said, most of the cast should be at least 21+ of age, if not 25+ outright.

As for romance, while I have a hard requirement for FxF for the main pairing, I still prefer writing partners willing and able to write all three basic gender combinations. By that I mean, obviously, FxM, MxM, and of course, FxF! Why? That's simple! I love variety, and I don't find it particularly realistic, nor immersive, when it's just a single kind of pairing over and over!

That said, while I do not outright require that our lead characters have to be romantically involved, I really am not the partner for you if you dislike writing romance in general.

I would also like to list some things that I do not want in my roleplays:

Fandoms, overt/excessive fluff/grimdark, sanitized/whitewashed depictions of groups widely known to be immoral/violent/corrupt, romanticized abuse, enemies-to-lovers (for the main pair), slice-of-life (as the main plot), werewolf and vampire plots, standard fantasy races, isekai, romance as the main plot, toxic masculine characters, comedy as the main genre, settings based off the real world (like in Marvel, HP or Percy Jackson), arranged marriage, school settings, protagonists of the evil moral alignment

Do not hesitate to ask, if you would like some elaboration on any one of these!

In truth, there's very, *very* few storytelling tropes and conventions that I refuse to make use of no matter what. Such as, I do not dislike either vampires, or were-creatures. I do, however, dislike settings where vampires and werewolves are the *only* fantastical elements, much less the only fantastical creatures, or if there's little of those besides them. Now that said, the ones listed above are what I *usually* dislike in fiction, and I figured the list may be useful to save at least some of you some time!

Now, while I **do not** write in fandoms anymore, there is a fair amount of fiction I tend to draw quite a lot of inspiration from! Examples would include:

Final Fantasy series (in particular VI, VII, X and XV), Fullmetal Alchemist (this is a big one!). Inuyasha, the Witcher series, Avatar: The Last Airbender (as well as Legend of Korra!), Vinland Saga, the Mistborn series, and Monster (the odd one out here!),

The list is in a *somewhat* descending order of importance. Of course, this isn't by any means the full extent of the fiction that I like! Absolutely not! I have, however, noticed that those are the pieces of fiction I am most likely to draw inspiration from, either on purpose, or subconsciously! If you like more than three positions on the list, then I feel there's good chance that we may vibe together quite well! However, I should say that while it is just my very limited personal experience, it's never worked out for me with anyone who was completely unfamiliar with any of the fandoms listed above. Especially when it comes to the first half of the list. So, if that's the case with you, approach at your own peril!

So! In regards to my storytelling preferences, I feel all that this should about suffice!

As for the *actual* writing, allow me to put it this way: I definitely like to have a decent amount of meat around the bone. Still, neither I do not believe in word quotas, nor do I believe in padding to fill said quotas. I don't really believe in labels all that much either, but if I must use one, then it'd be **advanced literate**. Typically, my replies tend to average between 400 and 800 words (don't ask me how much is it in paragraphs, I don't speak paragraph), but depending on the scene's need and scale, they can get longer. A lot longer. As for the more beautiful, flowery sort of language, I believe it is a lot like salt when used in cooking. Absolutely amazing in moderation, but not so much if you dump a whole kilogram into the pot! Oh, and I write exclusively in third person and past tense, and I expect the same of my partners, too.

I will happily provide a writing sample upon request in direct messages!

So, this should probably it!

This whole advert is a looot longer than it could have been, so kudos to you, if you've actually read the whole thing!

On the flip side, if you only skimmed through it, I recommend that you go back and read it in full anyway. This whole thing is long as #@%\^&!, but it is such for a reason, as a lot of the things I've talked about are potential deal-breakers and compatibility issues. At the end of the day, would you rather waste ten minutes of your time, or a whole week, if not more? Do take your pick!

Now, when you message me, please remember it is not a race! I typically tend to take my time rather than answer the very first person that messages me. What I do want to know is how I may call you, what is your age, your pronouns, your timezone (as well as country, if you feel comfortable sharing!), any potential story triggers (or just tropes you really, REALLY prefer to avoid!) and most importantly of all, a starting pitch for a story! This advert doesn't provide anything concrete, so don't worry, I am not asking for much! All I really want is a starting point for us to start plotting! You may as well tell me about a particular storytelling trope that you enjoy, or a character dynamic you've been wanting to explore for a while! I should also mention that while I will want to move to Discord eventually, I do typically prefer to stay here, before actually moving on. Oh, and it doesn't really matter whether you use Reddit Chat or Reddit PMs! Either channel works just as fine!

Sooo... this is everything!

I’ve been roleplaying for well over ten years, so you can bet I know my way around a good story! In my *very* late twenties, I juggle my love for writing with a Monday-through-Friday morning schedule—so if I don’t reply right away, don’t sweat it. I’m super ditch-friendly, meaning there’s zero pressure to post. Take your time, and I’ll do the same.

A little about me? I run on coffee and pure gaming obsession. I love crafting immersive plots, engaging in deep character development, and doubling up on characters—I *love* doubling! I usually go for heterosexual pairings and play both male and female characters. If we’re plotting, be ready to contribute because I like brainstorming together. Quality and quantity matter to me, so I appreciate at least two well-structured paragraphs per reply.

💥 **Craving:** I’d love to do an **OC x Bakugo** roleplay in the My Hero Academia universe! I can play anyone in return! That said, I’m open to other plots as well, so feel free to pitch ideas. I also have a few of my own too!

**Requirements & Preferences:**

☕ I will write as least four paragraphs. I would like it if my partner could do the same.

☕ Although not a requirement, I would LOVE to OOC with my partner! Let’s be friends!

☕ I prefer writing with partners over the age of 21. I am a *seasoned* lady.

☕ I roleplay via Discord only!

If this sounds like your vibe, feel free to reach out. Let’s create something awesome together!

A lot longer. As for the more beautiful, flowery sort of language, I believe it is a lot like salt when used in cooking. Absolutely amazing in moderation, but not so much if you dump a whole kilogram into the pot! Oh, and I write exclusively in third person and past tense, and I expect the same of my partners, too.

I will happily provide a writing sample upon request in direct messages!

So, this should probably it!

This whole advert is a looot longer than it could have been, so kudos to you, if you've actually read the whole thing!

On the flip side, if you only skimmed through it, I recommend that you go back and read it in full anyway. This whole thing is long as #@%\^&!, but it is such for a reason, as a lot of the things I've talked about are potential deal-breakers and compatibility issues. At the end of the day, would you rather waste ten minutes of your time, or a whole week, if not more? Do take your pick!

Now, when you message me, please remember it is not a race! I typically tend to take my time rather than answer the very first person that messages me. What I do want to know is how I may call you, what is your age, your pronouns, your timezone (as well as country, if you feel comfortable sharing!), any potential story triggers (or just tropes you really, REALLY prefer to avoid!) and most importantly of all, a starting pitch for a story! This advert doesn't provide anything concrete, so don't worry, I am not asking for much! All I really want is a starting point for us to start plotting! You may as well tell me about a particular storytelling trope that you enjoy, or a character dynamic you've been wanting to explore for a while! I should also mention that while I will want to move to Discord eventually, I do typically prefer to stay here, before actually moving on. Oh, and it doesn't really matter whether you use Reddit Chat or Reddit PMs! Either channel works just as fine!

Sooo... this is everything!

I was think of doing 7 day in Vienna (including 1 day trip to Bratislava) and 5 (half day for transfer) day in Budapest. Considering we are not going to doing much on the day of landing and lost half a day on the transfer to Budapest, we would have 6 full days in Vienna and 5/4.5 day in Budapest.

Let’s call him Mr. Dena. Although we were evacuated for a few days, my house was not directly affected and fortunately we were able to return to our daily things. Now, his entire city was on fire. I (23F) live with my parents, my boyfriend, my brother (25M), and our 2 dogs. We knew that his family’s home wasn’t going to make it at the rate of winds and fire spreading. Fortunately when everything opened back up, Mr. Dena and his family went to look at the damage and their home was one of the only ones on their street that survived. His parents found housing for them and their animals a few hours away. Mr. Dena has been working in DTLA and I told my parents we had to let him stay with us for a little bit until he figured his situation out. He is my brothers friend, my boyfriend’s friend, and my friend. Mr. Dena has had problems in the past like in and out of rehab and as one of his “girl” friends, i’ve felt multiple times like i need to save him/help him always. So, let’s get into it. He doesn’t clean up after himself whatsoever. I was always taught if you’re in someone else’s home, CLEAN UP AFTER YOURSELF. Our garage is a pretty cool hang out spot in the house, we have a recycling and trash can: LABELED. He leaves his cans in the table, and trash on our couch out there. My brother was gone for the weekend, I told Mr. Dena, you have to clean up before he comes home because 1. it’s not my trash 2. i wasn’t out there with Mr. Dena while my brother was gone, because it’s way too cold out there. 3. i shouldn’t have to pick up after someone who is years older than me 4. i don’t smoke, nor does anyone in this house but there’s an ashtray. he leaves the ashtray to completely overflow because he’s a literal chain smoker.  Fast forward to today: He’s been staying with us for a month. I’ve been getting food for him from my work, so he doesn’t have to buy any. From pastries, to sandwiches, to coffee. I have brought it for him. But he doesn’t tell me when he doesn’t like something. So i waste a lot of the things I bring home, but then tells my boyfriend what he doesn’t like. I don’t get why he doesn’t tell me, the person who is getting him the food, when my work could be donating these kind of things to the homeless shelter. On top of that, all he left his house with was 2 small backpacks and the clothes on his back. On January 27, I thought it would be nice to get him so funny “gaming” socks because he enjoys that. When i gave it to him, he just threw them on a chair, never looked at them, never even opened them. It made me really sad. I’ve been CONSTANTLY going out of my way to feed him and care for him as a friend but he just is so seemingly ungrateful. I’m scared he never plans on leaving. I find myself getting more frustrated but I can’t just throw him on the streets. Idk how to not go off on him. He has resources, and I know that there’s great recourses in this area for fire victims. I’ve sent him places on Instagram he can go get free food. He doesn’t do anything to help himself and i am losing my mind. I am terrified he’s going to stay here so long and i will feel so guilty if i tell him to go somewhere else. Now, AIO?",2,1738961833.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False

I’m currently working on a floor plan idea for a new build in Australia. We are hoping this will be our home for at least 10–20 years, if not longer, so want to make it as functional and future proof as possible. 

I’d love any unique features that you’ve seen that made things super functional and clever. 

Some things already on my list (budget pending): 

- hidden closet for Christmas tree (we mostly have fake ones in Australia and I hate dismantling it every year. Love the idea of wheeling it away, then bringing it back out as needed) 

- larger laundry, in the style of American utility rooms (most Australian laundries are tiny and not functional. I want raised appliances with pull out shelves underneath, then bench space where you have enough room to fold / iron / do something)

- mudroom accessible from garage and yard (we will be building on an acre so I expect we’ll end up with a horse / some sort of animals, and mud, so want to minimise how much is traipsed through the house) 

- multi purpose room that will start as a playroom and grow with our child/ren (we have a toddler now who has toys everywhere, because there’s no set space for them. I envisage this room will become a hangout zone as he grows older and has friends over etc) m

- a “formal” lounge near the front door that (most importantly) has a window sufficient for a Christmas tree to be seen from the street (I love Christmas, and this has always been my dream since a child) 

- a door/window from the garage straight into the pantry to make unloading groceries easier 

- an extra wide garage because my biggest pain point in life is trying to get a toddler in/out of a car without banging the car doors on things 

- a coffee bar set up with a small sink, fridge, and space for mugs, as well as a Zip Tap (we drink a lot of sparkling water!) ",1,1738961760.0,floorplan,1,1.0,False

Recently I had a baby faced marine come in his dress blues, talking with his arm on my counter how he just got out of basic and was grabbing a coffee before his event he was on the way to. I asked for his ID. already knowing I couldn't serve him because he was under 21. Kid was barely 19. He sputtered. Immediately got offended and went through the usual excuses as to why I should sell him the coffee. ""I've bought coffee with my mom here before and nothing was wrong."" And my personal favorite ""we know the owner."" I just told him sorry my guy. I have to follow the law like everyone else. 

My husband, who's ex Navy and was conveniently sitting in the back of the shop watched the whole thing with arms crossed and eyebrow raised, came up later after the kid stormed out in a huff. 

I was decompressing with him, while I could definitely handle myself it's still irritating and got my blood pressure up because I don't like confrontation with men especially. He brought up how you don't just let another service member ruin their career like that. If anyone at his command would have seen him come out of the shop they would have said something immediately.  He also mentioned how if it was a case of underaged drinking, and they got busted by the cops, every other sailor who was present would still go to mast for it at a minimum. 

Our CBD products are full spectrum. While they won't get you zooted, they will definitely pop for THC. and you can kiss your career goodbye. 

Now if he was 21, same scenario.. would I be in the wrong if I said something? Active duty or veterans,  you have said something to them?

**Support LGBTQ+ Community**

**Drip Cafe 869 Santa Fe Dr Denver 80204**

Join the [Denver Communists](https://denvercommunists.org/) and [Bread & Roses Legal Center](https://www.breadandroseslaw.org/) for their monthly First Friday protest against hateful coffee shop Drip Cafe.  Drip Cafe is run by a fundamentalist church that is openly anti-LGBTQ+.

These protests can get a little spicy sometimes as there have been actual Nazis out there counterprotesting.  Please consider dressing in non-descript clothing eg all black and covering your face to prevent potential doxxing by Nazis.

**Saturday 2/8/25**

**10am**

**Join the Fight Against Violent and Racist Immigration Enforcement**

**Buckley ""Space Force"" Base, intersection of East Mississippi Ave and Aspen St in Aurora**

**Hosted by:** [Aurora Unidos CSO](https://linktr.ee/auroraunidoscso) 

This protest is in support of immigrant rights and in opposition to the Trump administration's deportations.  The government is using Buckley ""Space Force"" Base as an immigrant detention center, so this one is bringing the fight right to the source.  If you can only attend one of the two protests on Saturday, this is the one I would suggest because this is an immigrant-led effort.  The protest will likely include a lot of immigrants, and the cops are more likely to get violent at events led by Black, Indigenous, and People of Color.  Aurora PD is also notoriously terrible.  It would be great to get some white allies out there to put their bodies between cops and immigrants/POC, if that's your thing.  Of the two Saturday protests, this is the one more likely to get some police retaliation (in my opinion.)

**Saturday 2/8/25**

**2pm**

**CO Stands with Immigrants: No Mass Deportations Rally & March**

**State Capitol Building**

**Hosted by:** [Denver PSL](https://www.instagram.com/denverpsl/)

PSL is the Party for Socialism and Liberation.  They are the group that organizes the most protests in our city.  They collaborated with grassroots organizers on the successful action at the Capitol on 2/5/25.  Their events are generally well-organized and have safety marshals present.  This is a good protest for you if you are new to protesting and nervous.  (It's good for other people too, I just think PSL protests tend to be a bit milder these days and are therefore a good starting point for nervous newbies.)

**Every Day for the Next 2 Weeks!**

**7am-8pm**

**Your Local King Soopers**

**In support of:** [UCFW Local 7](https://www.ufcw7.org/) the King Soopers Union

Your local King Soopers workers are on strike for the next two weeks!  Please buy your groceries elsewhere and don't cross the picket line!  You can show your support any time by stopping by your local King Soopers to carry a sign in the picket line, drop off some doughnuts, coffee, pizza or other food, or simply to let them know you are a King Soopers customer who supports the workers.

[Denver DSA](https://www.denverdsa.org/) **will be at the King Soopers location at 9th and Corona St (aka Queen Soopers) starting at 9:30am on Saturday 2/8/25** if you want to join a larger group (and you can also learn more about DSA Denver if you're interested.)

Please note: if you need to pick up your prescription from the King Soopers pharmacy, they don't consider that crossing the picket line!  Just approach the workers at the picket and ask to speak the strike captain, then let them know you support the strike, are only going in to pick up your prescription, and you will not be buying groceries.

Please add your events, protests and actions in the replies and I will edit this post to add them to the list as I have time.

See you in the streets!

1. Baro

Pet Name: Baro

Pet Type: Capybara

Description: Baro the capybara is an aloof, clumsy but also somewhat curious companion. What's special about him is his ability to balance random objects on his head. Baro is unique to other Capybaras as he has long fringe bangs and pink cheeks. Some say he was even born with the fringe bangs, but regardless no one dares to cut his bangs as it may be the secret to his great balancing ability. Baro wanders around searching for things to balance on his head and occasionally returns to his owner with weird objects on his head to give as a gift. Although balancing is his primary gift, he is also a skilled digger and can dig up bait or rocks (and collect sticks/wood) for his owner as well to help out.

Backstory: Where did he come from? Where will he go? No one knows for sure... He has been traveling all over the globe for as long as he has been known to the people...Maybe if he found the perfect object to balance on his head he can stop his quest and finally choose a place to settle down and live out his life (it would be even better if that place had a hot spring he could hang out around )

2. Cali:

Pet Name:

Cali

Pet Type:

Capybara!

Description:

Cali is a chubby, cute and very, very chill capybara. She have a little leaf on her head that changes with the seasons! She's very friendly and will just fall to her side like a sack of potatoes if you start petting her, offering her belly. She also loves to swim and munch on grass. She also loves the outdoors!

Backstory (Optional):

No backstory! Cali is in this world to eat, sleep and get belly scratches. She's living life.

3. Tincho or Coffee

Pet Name:

Tincho (Alternatively, Coffee)

Pet Type:

Capybara

Description:

Tincho is a unique capybara. While most of his fur is brown, he was born with some yellow spots and markings that make him stand out from others. He also wears a red handkerchief with embroideries around his neck.

This capybara is pretty relaxed and seems to have no fear of any beasties or menacing humans. In fact, he likes to go nap around the town even when people are hanging around!

Backstory (Optional):

During construction of the new town, the capybara felt curious and drew ever closer to its bounds, taking a relaxed stance and having no fear of the humans the were popping in. Some of the new locals gave him a handkerchief to wear and named him Tincho, and now he hands around Evershine, napping or observing the humans in town

4. Sunny

Pet Name:

Pet Type:

Shrub Sloth

Description:

A cute lil' sloth with wildflowers and shrubbery growing from its fur.

Backstory (Optional):

I don't know if I have a backstory. I just really like sloths, haha. I think they're adorable. This lil sloth fell into a bush and never cleaned itself off. It became one with the foliage. Lazy sloth, lazy backstory. 😂

5. Porksha

Pet Name:

Porksha (similar to Portia)

Pet Type:

“Flying” Pig

Description:

Porksha is a mini pig with a variety of black to gray spots all over her. She is cute and mischievous and hates baths and is often very dirty because of this. She will do almost anything for a good apple. She is dressed in a very elaborate wing suit made of blue leather and golden feathers. The leather has small golden tassels and still has her 1st place blue ribbon attached. Porksha is an excellent sniffer and is great at finding small trinkets and goodies. She especially loves shiny things and truffles.

Backstory:

Porksha is a runaway mini pig from the Free Cities Fair, after winning first place she saw a chance at a good muddy life free of the constant cleanings to be a show pig. Through daring adventures she somehow ended up in Evershine and with the constant construction there is plenty of mud and dirt to go around.

Idea: I loved QQ so much in Portia and I’ve always wanted a pet pig. I thought it would be so fun and a good throw bag to the Flying Pigs to have a pig with a wing costume.

6. Yarn

Pet Name: Yarn

Pet Type: Horned Wool

Description: Its distinct feature are its large curved horns which takes a large portion of its body. Due to the physical trait, Horned Wools tend to be easily caught in vicious cycles (all they do is roll). They’re most valued for their luscious wool.)

Backstory (Optional): During an excursion, the player encounters one rolling around an empty field. Luckily the kind-hearted player aids the Horned Wool. Enchanted by the act of kindness, the Horned Wool continues to follow the player until it manages to trip and redo the cycle. The player decides to adopt the little fellow and ties ribbons on its horns.

7. Tangle

Pet Name:

Tangle

Pet Type:

Animal, Red River Otter

Description:

A bit larger than its ancestor, the Northern River Otter, the Red River Otter is known not just for its hue, but for its tendency to cause chaos in swamps and temperate rivers. Like a cat drawn to string, they have an affinity for wrapping themselves in aquatic plants. The plant life they target has learned to adapt, though -- in part, by growing air roots along the stems.

While further research is needed to understand the full picture, the relationship between plant and animal is believed to be mutual.

8. Spots

Pet Name:

Spots

Pet Type:

Animal, Mountain Weasel

Description:

Spots is a little mountain weasel with gray fur and distinctive white spots, which earned him his name. He also goes by other fitting nicknames: Pebble Paws, Cuddle Noodle or Spotted Thief, each describing his quirky personality perfectly. This kind of mountain weasel is known for collecting precious things (VERY precious, like stones and acorns) and gifting them to others. If you think you have something valuable (or not), well, you might not anymore as Spots has likely snatched it for his collection! He carries a little bag on his back to store his treasures. His knack for gathering stuff makes it easier to find valuables. Alongside being excellent little thief, he is also very affectionate. If you sit down, he’ll likely jump onto your lap, demanding a cuddles and pets.

Backstory:

Spots was born in the mountains, but after changes in his environment, he had to find a new place to live. During his journey, he spent some time in a city where food was scarce. Observing people trading items for necessities, he began collecting small, precious objects to try and exchange them for food. One day, he offered an acorn to a man with food, hoping for a trade. Instead, the man just laughed and gave him something to eat for free. Surprised by this kindness, Spots decided to make it his mission to bring joy to others, sometimes giving (and occasionally taking…) small treasures to make people happy. Eventually, he arrived at a small settlement full of friendly people. One of them even gave him a little bag to hold his collections, and Spots decided to stay, feeling truly at home.

Additional description:

He used to carry his bag on his back but when he found his forever home, he left it there (safe!) and started wearing a golden acorn given by his friend (but who?). Hollow tree stump is his favourite place to sleep - it's so nice and cozy! Spots changes his coat in spring and autumn. He also seems to make friends wherever he goes!

I don't know how pets would be designed in Evershine but if pets have skills, Spots would be great at finding valubales or while in party he would boost chance to find rare items. If accessories have effect then his bag would give additional inventory space or carrying capacity or he would have his own inventory. While his golden acorn is equipped he gives a boost to finding rare items.

I came with pink streaks in my hair and painted nails that would make my wudhu invalid anyway. I haven’t done wudhu in years.

She wore loose clothes that covered up every inch of skin apart from her face and hands.

I showed up in a sundress, showing off my arms and legs, with no shame or embarrassment.

She was a devout Muslim, genuinely seeing it as a way of life.

I was a freethinker and no longer chained by the shackles of blind faith.

She spent the early morning praying Fajr and writing faith-inspired poetry.

I peacefully woke up after sunrise cuddled up against my boyfriend. 

She was shocked and disappointed at the very sight of me - is this how her future turns out?! The lowest of the low: a disbeliever?!

I calmly tell her my story of why I left Islam.

She attempts to convince me to go back to being a Muslim, to try harder, to really read the Quran - a miraculous book. 

I tell her I’ve dissected the Quran many times and it is most definitely not the word of God.

She doesn’t believe me and refuses to see past the brainwashing, she starts tearing up, no longer unable to hide how upset she is.

I offer to give her a hug and soothing words.

She pushes me away. and she leaves the scene with a hurricane of emotions. Mostly fear of eternal hell. But she also leaves with the slightest bit of doubt over her lifelong faith and wonders if this truly could all be false.

I sigh, then shrug, with the peace of knowing that she will eventually wake up one day and become me. A wonderful woman who chose freedom over fear, love over hate, reason over fiction. ",17,1738961208.0,exmuslim,9,0.96,False

Hi! I’m Stephanie. I’m 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection, something close to a relationship. I’d like to find someone I can confide in, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older. Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don’t have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I am single, and would prefer that you are as well. I’m not looking to change my situation at this time, but do crave a relationship-like connection. I’m not interested in anything solely or immediately nsfw in nature, I prefer to know a person quite well before that. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/zUFNfnA)

That’s just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages.

The product is formulated with natural ingredients that work synergistically to boost your metabolism, increase energy levels, and support overall well-being. The unique aspect of Java Burn is its ability to blend seamlessly with coffee, leveraging the natural properties of caffeine to enhance its effectiveness. This combination makes Java Burn an innovative and easy-to-use supplement for those looking to improve their health and shed excess pounds. The Science Behind Java Burn Java Burn’s effectiveness is rooted in its blend of scientifically-backed ingredients. These ingredients are chosen for their ability to boost metabolism, enhance fat burning, and provide other health benefits. Here’s a closer look at the primary ingredients in Java Burn: Green Coffee Bean Extract: This ingredient is rich in chlorogenic acid, a compound that has been shown to reduce fat absorption and improve fat metabolism. Green coffee bean extract also provides antioxidants that protect the body from oxidative stress. Chromium: Chromium is an essential mineral that helps regulate blood sugar levels. By stabilizing blood sugar, chromium can reduce hunger and prevent overeating, making it easier to stick to a healthy diet. B Vitamins: Java Burn includes B12 and B6, which are crucial for energy metabolism. These vitamins help convert food into energy, supporting weight loss and overall vitality. L-Thiamine and L-Carnitine: These amino acids play important roles in the body.

L-Thiamine helps reduce anxiety and promote relaxation, while L-Carnitine supports fat metabolism and helps maintain muscle mass during weight loss. Caffeine: As a natural stimulant, caffeine boosts energy levels and enhances metabolic rate. In Java Burn, caffeine works alongside other ingredients to maximize fat burning and improve focus and alertness. EGCG: Found in green tea extract, EGCG is a powerful antioxidant that supports metabolism and reduces inflammation. It complements the effects of green coffee bean extract and caffeine. These ingredients work together to create a potent formula that supports weight loss, boosts energy, and improves overall well-being. Click here to secure the best offer How Java Burn Works Java Burn is designed to be mixed with your coffee, creating a powerful combination that enhances metabolism and promotes weight loss. Here’s how it works: Boosts Metabolism: The ingredients in Java Burn, such as caffeine and green coffee bean extract, work together to increase your metabolic rate. This means your body burns more calories, even at rest, making it easier to lose weight. Enhances Fat Burning: By improving fat metabolism, Java Burn helps your body use stored fat for energy. This leads to a reduction in body fat and a leaner physique. Reduces Appetite: Ingredients like chromium help stabilize blood sugar levels, reducing hunger and preventing overeating. This makes it easier to stick to a healthy diet and avoid unhealthy snacks.

One evening, while browsing the internet, Arif stumbled upon an article discussing a supplement called Java Burn. Marketed as a natural, tasteless powder to be mixed with coffee, Java Burn claimed to boost metabolism, suppress appetite, and enhance energy levels. Intrigued by the prospect of a simple addition to his morning routine, Arif delved deeper into user testimonials and reviews.

Many users reported positive experiences with Java Burn. For instance, John D. shared that he experienced a significant decrease in cravings for unhealthy snacks, which he found pivotal in his weight loss journey. Similarly, Sarah L. noted improved focus and sustained energy throughout the day, without the typical mid-afternoon slump. These accounts resonated with Arif, reflecting the challenges he faced.

However, Arif also encountered some cautionary tales. A few users mentioned experiencing mild side effects, such as headaches and digestive discomfort. Others felt that the weight loss results were slower than anticipated, emphasizing the importance of combining the supplement with a balanced diet and regular exercise.

Weighing the pros and cons, Arif decided to give Java Burn a try. He ordered a 30-day supply and began incorporating it into his morning coffee routine.

**Week 1:**

Initially, Arif didn't notice any significant changes. He enjoyed his coffee as usual, now with the addition of Java Burn, and went about his daily activities. By the end of the first week, he observed a subtle increase in his energy levels. The usual mid-afternoon fatigue seemed less pronounced, allowing him to remain more productive throughout the day.

**Week 2:**

As the second week progressed, Arif began to notice changes in his eating habits. He felt fuller for longer periods and his cravings for sugary snacks diminished. This newfound control over his appetite made it easier for him to make healthier food choices.

**Week 3:**

By the third week, Arif stepped onto the scale and was pleased to see a modest weight loss of about 2 kilograms. His clothes fit better, and he felt a renewed sense of confidence. Encouraged by these results, he decided to incorporate light exercise into his routine, taking evening walks around his neighborhood.

**Week 4:**

At the end of the month, Arif had lost a total of 4 kilograms. Beyond the weight loss, he felt more energetic and noticed an improvement in his overall mood. The combination of Java Burn, healthier eating, and regular walks had made a tangible difference in his life.

Reflecting on his journey, Arif acknowledged that while Java Burn played a supportive role, it wasn't a magic solution. The supplement helped suppress his appetite and provided an energy boost, but the real change came from his commitment to a healthier lifestyle. He realized the importance of consistency and the need to pair the supplement with balanced nutrition and physical activity.

Arif also remained mindful of the potential side effects. He monitored his body's responses and was prepared to discontinue use if he experienced any adverse reactions. Fortunately, apart from a slight initial headache—which he attributed to his body's adjustment—he didn't encounter any significant issues.

In conclusion, Arif's experience with Java Burn was largely positive. It served as a catalyst, helping him regain control over his health and well-being. His journey underscores the importance of a holistic approach to weight loss—one that combines supportive supplements with healthy lifestyle choices.

For those considering Java Burn, Arif's story offers valuable insights. It's essential to set realistic expectations, remain patient, and understand that supplements can aid the process but are most effective when complemented by a commitment to overall health. As always, consulting with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen is advisable to ensure it aligns with individual health needs.",1,1738961097.0,KibbexKpop,4,1.0,False

I've had a ton of matches and conversations but literally every single conversation I've had the very next day they ghost me. It almost feels like this app is riddled with bots. Idk..

I've really tried my best to find a real thing here but its simply not possible where im located. Im in lakeway close to Austin texas. Women will ask you what you do for a living only to ghost or judge you. If you reply too fast you get ghosted .. if you reply too late you get ghosted... If you have a great conversation and maybe snatched a # guess what... Ghosted! You get ignored very next day regardless how well, fun or joyful the moment was. Everything seems to move here where im located based off status , wealth and unfortunately lust. 

Im not in a rush to meet someone or anything like that however im genuinely curious what other stories are out there...

I had a girl insult and belittle me because i told her i dont take girls on rooftop restaurant dates as she wanted without knowing em. 
What happened to talking and connecting? 
Maybe a walk, coffee date , hike? Bumble seems like a scam filled with fake accounts to reel ya in and make ya spend money. What if half these girls that I've matched with are AI accounts... That would explain the ghosting after a good connection. The ones that i actually get on the phone seem to have the same personalities... Me me me.


Anyways im sure i can keep going and sharing more and more but I'd like to hear from everyone here :)

1ik55e2,https://www.reddit.com/r/directsupport/comments/1ik55e2/i_quit_today_im_sad_i_didnt_say_goodbye_to_my/,I quit today. I'm sad I didn't say goodbye to my members...,"My group home hasn't had a lead or a true supervisor for close to a year. We did the best we could, with the few staff we did have. I was there for almost three years, and despite working several group homes, the one I quit from felt like my ""home away from home"". I loved it there for a long time. 

Our bosses boss was our ""person of contact"" for now. She's the highest level of employee here in our cities part of the company. She has a lot on her plate. I get that. 

However, a supervisor isn't only there for the members/clients/consumers. They are literally in charge of leading their staff. And this is where she/they failed miserably. Her and typically anyone around her. They never last long. Or they would be one way by themselves and fake when she was around. 

I couldn't take the manipulation, the lies, the fakeness and mostly the micromanagement anymore. I couldn't take her making myself and my coworkers, who are AMAZING feel like idiots anymore. I couldn't take them expecting us to do a difficult and important job- without giving us the tools to do it- and then when we would ask for help, tell us to ""just do your job!"" 

It's just so fake and bad and the system is so lost. Or at least around here it is. The three companies in town are all very similar. We all end up working together here and there, so we know. 

Well... Unfortunately- I left in a heated moment, after my ladies were dropped off at their day program. And I feel terrible. For the members, not the company. 

I've worked at four of the five group homes, and had a really good relationship with all of the members and supervisors. 

I'm 42 and have been in this field since I was 19. I love it. I'm great at it. Caregiving is 2nd nature to me, and I'm often asked by parents, children and caregivers to work with their loved ones. 

This company and it's management style burnt me out. And as much as I feel relieved in a way, I am very sad... 

I have so much to say; in so many directions. But my main reason coming here is to tell others how I feel about not saying goodbye to the members. 

I used to always see their heartache when we lost staff suddenly and wish there was a way that they could say goodbye. Or even if the company would just talk to them about it! They just have people disappear from their world, and they get no closure. I would talk to them the best I could when they would cry or be angry. But there was nothing in place for them to help them grieve, you know? 

And I just added to it. 💔 

I do live in a smaller city, so I may see them around town. I just wish I would have known I was leaving today, and given them that last hug. I wish I could have let them know it's not them. 

Tell them that I'm sorry I won't be there to take them to church, make strong coffee and french toast, take them to drive thru prayer, and all the special things that only I would do with and for them. That I'm sorry we never made it to the concert or the zoo. Stuff like that. 

My thoughts are everywhere. I don't feel relief yet. I feel anger. But I mainly feel sad. 😕",11,1738960952.0,directsupport,2,1.0,False

Yesterday, I went to a coffee shop and indulged in a slice of coffee cake to celebrate! I'm a long-time sugar addict, so this was a big accomplishment. I had decided to eliminate added sugar as much as possible for one week to see if it would improve my seborrheic dermatitis, which is on my scalp and face and in my ears. I had always noticed improvements in the clarity of my skin whenever I generally ate cleaner. After one week, the clarify of my skin improved, but I still got a few breakouts towards the end of the week, and my seborrheic dermatitis is still there. However, a wonderful surprise was the confidence boost I got from successfully completing my goal! I noticed a stark contrast when I walked around in public. I normally feel gross because I think about all the unhealthy foods I consume, but this past week I've felt good about myself everywhere I go. I'm trying to go another week ""sugar free"" and make dessert a weekly celebration, because I don't want to eliminate it completely. I mean, imagine never eating ice cream again!!?? If you're questioning your ability to try sugar free, my suggestion is to give yourself a small but achievable goal (even just one day sugar free is better than 0).

My best friend has been having issues with his gf lately, and one day she got so mad at him she broke the TV remote control and poured beer on his head, he was shocked and long story short he left the apartment and told her he needs a break for at least a week so that he can think straight and decide what to do next.
 He told me what happened and since then we got closer than ever, idk why but he felt so comfortable sharing how he’s feeling about the whole thing with me and I, as a friend, was there for him, i made sure he’s not alone and I tried to keep his company to cheer up his mood while trying hard to not cross the boundaries with him because I genuinely love and respect him as a friend and i respect his gf.

Before i get into details its important for me to mention that he was also there for me when I had issues with some guy and he was very supportive and I felt like I needed to be there for him like he was there for me.

Anyway, he called me one night and asked if id be down for a beer because hes had a long day and he wanted to talk about it and I told him sure lets go out, he got so excited, i didn’t really think much of it, we went out had a beer it was fun till some annoying people joined our table so we decided to get up and leave, we didn’t wanna end the night  yet so we tried a different bar no luck, he then suggested that i come to his place, smoke chill and watch a funny show together, i said sure why not, i went to his place we had fun I slept at the floor that night and he was on his bed and he suggested(to be nice) that I can come to his bed if  im comfortable with it, i said no im good with the floor. We went to sleep, we got up in the morning, i had some coffee with him and went home.

He texted me that he appreciates what im doing for him and all, and I said i appreciate that he’s sharing it with me and that im ready to listen to him rant about it till things get better because i know what its like.

Two days later, we went out with friends to celebrate his bd. 
Before we went to the bar, his gf called and told him that she’s in the apartment rn as she wanted to get some stuff and leave. 
We were supposed to go to his place make some food and chill there for a while till it was time to go out ( for context we’re both uni students, and we headed to his place straight from the library when we finished studying as he lives next to uni, and i live in the other side of the city)
He got a little bit annoyed that she keeps breaking 
the no contact as it distracts him from thinking straight and figuring out how he feels.
So we decided to sit at some place to drink tea and talk. He started talking about his feelings about his gf and what’s actually bothering him about the whole thing, and I tried to help understand what he’s experiencing and just give him the emotional support he needs, again without crossing any lines.

We finally made it to the bar, we got so drunk there and he sat next to me had his arm behind my head and his head leaned on my shoulder and he was mumbling that he’s feeling amazing in this position and he asked if he can sleep on my shoulder and i told him sure, mind you the whole time i was drunk but also didn’t wanna be really close to him so it doesn’t look weird to our friends and it just didn’t feel right to me, he kept saying stuff like “ this feels nice, maybe a little too nice, i feel so comfortable when im with you, which is good, or maybe it isn’t?” Im not sure what exactly was he saying but he was drunk and full of emotions. 
Our friend offered to drive us back home and I didn’t wanna make him drive me all the way back go my apartment then drive my friend to his apartment so i said im gonna sleep at my best friends place, as ive already done this before and i didn’t want to be a burden on our mutual friend.
we got to his apartment, we both were super drunk to pull the mattress on the floor, he was already on bed and i asked if its ok to lay there on the side too (he has a big bed) so im laying there and he put his hand underneath my head and he’s talking about his feelings and how much he appreciates and loves me and that how he feels different and good and comfortable with me and how its been a while since the last time felt this way, he gets closer and i finally gave in as i was drunk and i got close too and i put my head on his chest, he asked what are you thinking i said idk but i feel like this is wrong i cant stop thinking about your gf and this isnt how friends act he said yeah but i want you to know that i meant everything i said i have feelings for you i told him ur probably confused he said he knows what he’s doing, it was dark but we both were close and we started making out, rest is history.
We didn’t go to sleep till it was 6am and when we walk up we also kissed but it was awkward.

I go back to my place he texted me that yesterday was amazing and he hopes i had fun too and that he didn’t complicate things more than they already are. I told him that i think we made a huge mistake and i need a step back he said i understand and I told him that his gf doesn’t deserve this, he said, dont blame yourself its not ur fault im the fucked up person here, and he thinks that the best thing is to pretend that it never happened and move on.

This is long as hell and there are some other small details that im too tired to write, and i doubt anyone would read this.
Either way, what do I do? Should I tell her? Im scared of her reaction and anger issues but i also feel guilty and weird.",1,1738960811.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

I have an OCD diagnosis and I do some stupid thing that I know is the wrong choice out of guilt, and I sabotage myself. It’s hard to do what i actually want to do. I feel like I don’t know what my true preferences are and I’m just kinda moving and acting so that I have something to do to fill my time outside of work. But I constantly feel outside of myself, and am aware of what I’m doing and it often feels contradictory to what I really want to do but also what I really want to do has downsides as well, and the emotional result of those downsides can be punishing. I guess I’m just describing what everyone will see as an obvious case of not living in line with my values, but I dare say this feels “more complicated” than that, like I will fixate on an inconsequential action and make the safe choice instead of my “true” choice, but often I will second guess the true choice as well.

I’m in a coffee shop right now and just feeling completely disgusted and embarrassed and aware of all the people around me who seem so true and real and some of them beautiful in their inception, and I can just feel food in my stomach rotting and I’m always aware of how food feels in my stomach and intestines and I fixate on it.

I hate living like this, and feeling like flesh, nerves, and machinery all the time. I want to feel real and human instead of monkey banana animal. But alas I will never be able to Be a Self so it doesn’t matter. Just operating off of stupid neuroticisms, like returning a uniform shirt out of anxiety that I probably won’t wear it, because I prefer my other shirts, and that it’s wasteful to order something I won’t wear, but my preferences might change, and I didn’t even purchase it myself so it’s not consequential but I guess I returned it to like.. make the decision and relieve myself from the indecision, so now I can’t go back I guess. Typing this out I’m aware of how insane it sounds, and I’m sad that there is this part of myself when I do feel I am a rather “sane” and “salient” person from the outside, or at least I am perceived as such.

I don’t care about what is wrong with me because I’ve thought about this for way too long, and it is all so nebulous and contingent and I don’t even know what all these psychological concepts (neurodivergency, autism, etc) “mean” anymore, what defines them (I mean outside of obvious DSM-5), and none of it seems really clear or useful to my life.

I was personally flattered by it but the girl is young enough to be my daughter and I already have a girlfriend so I wasn’t and never would be interested but I still offered to be a friend to her. 

She was cool with that and we would have lunch together sometimes and I would give her advice on things like college and the workforce.

So here is when the problem came in. A few hours ago, I came into work and made some coffee when one of my work friends who I’ll call Richard comes in. We talk a bit until he says “you know, I didn’t know you were into younger women but you learn something new everyday.” I froze, turned to him, and asked what in the hell is he talking about. He then says “Aren’t you and Joy together now?” I said no we are not, I already have a girlfriend and me and Joy are just friends. 

Richard turns to me confused and says, “But Joy has been telling everyone that you left your girlfriend and that you two are dating now.” With that, I left the lounge and went to go look for Joy. I found her talking to some other coworkers and it was there I heard her telling these people we are in a relationship. I walk over Joy and the others and ask her what the hell is she doing. She then tries to downplay it but I cut her off and tell her in front of everyone that I am in a happy relationship, she is literally the same age as my nephew, I only saw as her as a friend/little sibling, and I am not and would never be interested in her in that manner. 


Before she could say anything, I stormed out of the building and into my car. I drove down the street to a little coffee shop I frequent where I am writing this right now. I got a few texts from coworkers saying I could have been nicer about it or addressed the matter in private and honestly, I am feeling a little bad about yelling at her in public like that.

So, AITAH?

(Throwaway account because my family knows my original)

Me and my cousins sister (whom I will refer to from here onwards as my sister) have not always been super close but have kept in touch through college, work and married life. I had always thought of her as a spoiled child who did not care about the family and got things the way she wanted always. She moved out in her early 20’s to Germany to study and later started working there in corporate.

She had been inviting me to come visit her since years and I decided to go there in December. She usually goes with her friends and their families for a weekend to a house near the mountains that they all rent and since I would be with her then, she invited me to join her too. 

That entire weekend got me questioning my life. I was in the kitchen in the morning and I saw her husband make a cup of coffee to wake her up from bed. She led a yoga class with me and her other friends while all the husbands made breakfast for all of us. I cannot even fathom asking my husband to do this, especially in front of my in laws. My entire morning is filled with getting them ready and going to work, school (I am a housewife). During the day they were talking about their careers, promotions, what they wanted to buy etc. and I felt so left out. It must be nice to have money to buy what you want, especially with 2 people earning. I have to ask my husband even to buy a saree. 

Later in the evening we decided to watch a movie  ‘The great Indian kitchen’ and I hate it that I could not see initially what was wrong with the movie initially because it felt like the life of any woman. But they were talking about how they could never imagine to live like that and later I started seeing how much better their life actually was. And I felt happy that it was not their life. It was nice that they were living a different life.

The thing that I hate the most from the entire holiday was that that could have been me. I could be living a life like that. When we were young, she even fought with my parents to let me do an MBA. I hated her then because she was forcing me to start a career after I got my degree but that meant I had to move away from my parents which I thought was selfish. I was judging her for leaving her mother alone and moving abroad. I thought I was being a good daughter. But she now send money to her mother every month and even took her on vacation around Europe last year, while I have to ask my husband for money. My husband is nice. He has never hit me and loves me and my kids. He also sends money to my parents when his business is doing well. When not, then he supports only his parents. But I see how much of a regressive family I live in now. 

I wish I could live her life but there is nothing I am so now to change that. I just wanted tell this out to someone since nobody around me could understand how I feel now.",0,1738960374.0,AskWomenOver30,0,0.4,False

I'm retired and I go to Costco 3-5 days a week to just walk around. I buy stuff when it goes on sale and I know we'll use. I consider myself well-prepared for around 6 months, not only for my family but for my neighbors and friend as well.

So, I see the rhythm of my Costco and what people are buying. I used to go every morning and just stand outside and watch in the weeks before Covid hit, to watch people enter and run to the toilet paper and water area. It was amusing and affirming of the prepper ways.

So these past few weeks, there is an noticeable proportion of people buying the water, toilet paper, cleaning supplies and pantry items (rice, canned meat and veggies, cereal, coffee etc.).

This past week, there is an especially noticeable proportion of people masked (some even with face shields, masks and gloves).

I know flu is rampant. I think people are getting concerned about bird flu.

Eggs: my Costco has had eggs consistently this week. They have finally put a 3 unit limit on all eggs. $18.69 for the 60 pack.

There were lines this morning for the eggs and toilet paper.",219,1738960307.0,PrepperIntel,64,0.95,False

a little context— we were close friends for about 4 years. talked frequently, shared all the same interests/humor, could talk to each other most of the day, and regarded one another as one of the other's closest friends. I had a huge crush on her which she was aware of, but she was dating somebody at the time so I never made a move. Things went well for years until I started growing more awkward around her due to my crush, which I felt had gone on too long and this became reflected in me taking longer and longer to reply back to her. Then one day, mid-conversation, she just stopped replying. There was no read receipt and I felt it was a confirmation of her not caring about me anymore so I just never reached back out.

9 years later she reaches out with a random exclamation at 3am. I said what's up, was left on read for 4 days before asking if she got my message, then that was left on read for 3 more days, before she finally ignored the question and asked me how life had been going. This was the tone for the first few weeks of this reconnection.

I asked her out for coffee after 3 weeks of this confusion and she immediately opened up and we spent an hour sending instant replies. She gave me a week of availability to choose from and suddenly it felt like my friend was back; that we were talking like we used to all those years ago. I even had to try multiple times to end the conversation since I had friend coming over.

The meetup comes 2 days later and she no-shows. She gives me some confusing explanation about having gotten a flat and trauma surrounding totaling her car last year and having a mental spiral and ""not wanting to put that on me"", and then she turned her notifications off for the week. The next couple months were just continued attempts at trying to hang, which she'd agree to, but then would leave my suggested plans on read for days. I should also add I had very early on told her my feelings were returning and that she should know if she intended to keep talking to me, which she did not acknowledge but still continued to engage. 

I tried presenting more opportunities to turn me down by becoming more explicit with my feelings but she just always ignored them. At one point I told her that if she wasn't interested she actually just had to tell me, but she even left that on read for 5 days before telling me at 1am that our favorite band was on at the bar. I didn't reply to this, sent her a ""happy new year"" a day later, and she replied with ""happy new years. I'll send you some days to hang.""

The week passed and she sent nothing and it basically fell apart after that. I told her this wasn't good for me and she said that she shouldn't have reached out ""if she wasn't ready"" and then one thing led to another and I blocked her. But I'm an idiot and thought about it and considered if her sudden silence 9 years ago was her grappling with feelings for me and so I unblocked her, but I didn't know what to say and was terrified of losing her so I did the stupidest thing possible and confessed my complete feelings for her. Everybody tells me there was nothing wrong with me telling her I loved her at that point and that my message was well-written but I can't help but feel that I fucked everything up and caused her to shutdown. My confession has been on read 3 weeks and a follow up 2. I sent a final message last night saying I'd like to meet up and talk things over but if I don't hear back I have to move on. It's on read, but even that has me wondering why she still reads my messages instantly.

tl;dr: old crush reconnected out of the blue after 9 years, was confusedly avoidant from the beginning, ended up making me so anxious I confessed my feelings

1ik4trc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ik4trc,Spontaneous Upgrade,"Hey fellow espresso enthusiasts,


I just had to share this incredible deal I stumbled upon recently. I spontaneously upgraded my setup, and I’m still pinching myself over how good it was!


I managed to snag a 3-year-old Lelit Bianca V2 paired with a Eureka Mignon Specialita—both in great condition. But wait, it gets better! The seller threw in a ton of accessories, and I mean a ton. Here’s what was included:

- Normcore Tamper & Puck Screen

- WDT Tool  

- Motta Dosing Ring  

- Motta Leveler (two of them, lol)  

- ECM Tamping Stand  

- A whole bunch of VST and IMS baskets (seriously, so many)  

- ECM Brush  

- Milk Jugs

- Single Dosing Hopper for the Mignon 


All of this for just €1,200! I feel like I hit the jackpot.


But here’s the bittersweet part: When I went to pick it up, I couldn’t help but feel a little guilty. The poor guy had to sell his gear after moving to a new apartment because it was taking up too much space, and apparently, his wife didn’t want it around anymore. You could see it in his eyes—it really hurt him to let it go. We ended up exchanging numbers, and I'm planning to invite him over for coffee soon.


I’m still in shock and already love to dial in shots with this setup. Cheers to spontaneous upgrades and great finds—and to sharing the love of espresso with others!",30,1738960132.0,espresso,3,0.98,False
1ik4r9h,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConnectingDFW/comments/1ik4r9h/paper_or_plastic/,Paper or Plastic,"Chuck Lawson used to be the king of plastic straws. He wasn’t just selling them—he was moving them by the truckload. Every fast food joint, gas station, and convenience store within a hundred-mile radius knew his name. Life was good. He had a solid house, a reliable car, and even a weekend place by the lake.

Then came the crackdown.

The last administration waged war on plastic. “Paper straws are the future,” they said. Chuck had laughed at first, thinking nobody would actually tolerate those soggy, useless tubes of misery. But bans started rolling in. Cities turned against him. Even the little mom-and-pop diners stopped ordering. His suppliers dropped him like a hot potato.

Within a year, Chuck was out of business. His accounts dried up, his house went into foreclosure, and he had to trade in his beloved car for a 15-year-old sedan that smelled like stale coffee and broken dreams. He was one bounced check away from sleeping in it.

But then, hope.

Rumors swirled of a new administration rolling back the anti-plastic madness. Chuck wasn’t one for politics, but when he saw a press conference where a government official casually sipped from a real plastic straw, he nearly wept. It was happening. The comeback was on.

With his last bit of credit, he got on the phone. Old clients, new clients—anyone who would listen. “Plastics are back, baby!” he told them. And they were ready. Restaurants had been suffering under the tyranny of paper. Customers demanded a return to sanity. Orders flooded in.

Chuck was back in business.

Within six months, he was not only back on his feet—he was thriving. To celebrate, he walked into [Genesis of Mesquite](https://www.genesisofmesquite.com/), feeling like a new man. The salesman took one look at him and asked what brought him in.

“Straws,” Chuck said, grinning. “They’re back.”

And as he drove off the lot in his brand-new [Genesis G80](https://www.genesisofmesquite.com/new-vehicles/g80/), sipping a celebratory iced coffee through a proper plastic straw, he knew one thing for certain:

Hi everyone! 

I finished my first month of kit 1. I didn't lose anything until I started week 4. My major issue is nausea after I started taking 2 tablets of Naltrexone daily I didn't know I had to cut my caffeine intake! I just noticed I don't crave it as much but I'm so used to starting the day with Turkish coffee so I settled on one cup in the morning. Yesterday I had horrible nausea right after I had coffee and when I tried to have breakfast (half a croissant) it got worse. I skipped the meds altogether. Taking Zofran helped a lot if anyone is interested.

I want to take this more seriously, exercise, and add enough protein. My issue is the nausea part. Being dizzy and nauseous is not an option with a toddler! 

Are there any moms here who went through this? 

I just want to finish the 5 months course and not end up with unused expensive pills in my cabinet. Advice?

I know you get 4x on restaurants and grocery but...I can get 3x on restaurants, grocery, and airlines with Citi strata, and I linked the Citi custom cash so I'm getting 5x on gas.  All thru Citi.  I'll use venture X for 2x on everything else.  Thinking I can open double cash and get 20,000 extra points that way next year.  Eco system change!

I texted with an Amex customer service rep and they refused any sort of retention offer.  They were like, "" I didn't understand your proposal.""  I was pretty clear to them about wanting a retention offer!  I agree with other comments that their foreign customer service is ok but they don't really seem to care much.  Just like any other bank or credit card.  So what makes Amex so special anymore!?

I honestly think the main reason I like Amex gold is the shiny gold color of the physical card and the fact you get 1.6 aeromexico points per 1 MR point.  The first reason is just lame (gold color) and as far Aeromexico I usually go with Air France or Virgin Atlantic or move points around with the avíos currency (recently moved to British airways and then transferred to Aer Lingus for example).  And don't get me started on Delta sky miles.  The fact amex transfers to Delta is a con , not a pro.  (Sky pesos now known as sky bolivares)

Can anyone change my view and convince me why I should keep the amex gold card?  I'll keep it if it makes any real sense!  I have like a total of 12K of restaurant and grocery spend per year, according to the amex rep.  And yes I used the resy credits and a $20 TurboTax credit, but I'm tired of the coupon book game.  It's like oh yeah I better buy coffee at Dunkin this week otherwise I'll miss out:  boo hoo! Most of my Dunkin donuts credits never were used because I like Starbucks or my own coffee better than whatever Dunkin serves.  In short, Let me eat where I want to!

I'm missing a big poly in the setup and a bunch of pedals but can I always from record from home into the Deluge as a sample if I need.

Arranging the gear ergonimcally, picking apart the foam (excellent concept btw), and created all the adio, midi and power tunnels underneath the top layer of foam was the most challenging but also the most rewarding. The 1010 Bluebox was the last to arrive and it literally brings it all together being a mixer, efx, mastering and recording. 
While the Deluge is of course the heart of the rig with sequencer & sampler duties, the Tanzbar drum machine is my goat here, taking up 7 of the 12 channels so I can split them off and process and record thee individual hits is most important to me. Everything is has its place though and vital to each other.

I had a lot of fun making this project, and being able to take my studio to mates house, play live (one day) and to starbucks for coffee (jk lol, starbucks coffee is dirt).

They help me wake up less focused on yesterday and the past. 

I also believe that they help with dreams or nightmares. I tend not to have nightmares and am sorry that I have ever wished that on anyone. My dreams are usually pretty random and nonsensical. This time when I was dreaming, I was somewhere on the West coast.

Maintenance knocked on my door for ""pest control"". It's also something I had to have done when I was living in federal housing. I suppose it makes sense that they would do it here as well. I know that whatever they are spraying is toxic. From what I have always noticed, it doesn't seem to prevent pests. I have had roaches this whole stay. 

The pest control guy told me ""nobody's watching you."" Sometimes I love it when people give me hints and clues. He had an amazing smile, too. This place is crazy. Sometimes I feel like I'm in danger, sometimes I am just mind blown. So exciting. I am currently not in a rush to leave because I am mentally tired of trying to figure out my next step. I just want to feel good and have fun. I don't want to hurt anyone or get hurt. 

I've been thinking about celebrities. I cannot stand the idea of them using their status to take advantage of average citizens. They are so used to people drooling over them, it must be a thrill when they get rejected. For some of them, it's probably an insult. They'd be like, ""Do you know who I am???"" Celebrity status does not automatically make you a prize or desirable, or entitled to anyone's attention. 

I often encourage others to take celebrities off of a pedestal like I have been teaching myself how to do. A lot of them are energy vampires. A lot of them are shells of their former selves, their true essences floating around between different locations, vessels, dimensions, and times. A lot of them have to watch from afar as demons control their body and live their life. 

A lot of them are angry because they got tricked into selling themselves out. A lot of them want justice. A lot of them are trying to help others. A lot of them are blocked off from re-entering their vessel, but some of them are able to do so briefly. Some spirits were not intended to be out of their bodies for too long in this way, which is why this blocking isn't always fully successful. 

This phenomenon isn't only a thing for celebrities. I know people personally that have allowed themselves to be taken over. They have told me and shown me that they can leave their bodies and go wherever they want, wherever they can visualize. 

I don't want anyone watching me if they're a thief. I don't want celebrities or anyone trying to get ""inspiration"" from me without my permission, and without compensating me somehow. But I have to admit that I am highly impressed with their execution of my visions, ideas, and projects. They have the resources and money to create what I can't. Thank you for doing that. 

I am not ungrateful, but I do want better for myself. I hate the idea of being under anyone's control, but I also don't like the idea of being in a situation or environment that hinders my ability to get things done on my own. Its like someone was angry or challenged by the fact that I wanted to be  independent. 

I also don't like the fact that they are pressuring me to be creative. It doesn't work that way. You can't force songs or jokes or dance moves out of someone. I am not trying to be anybody's golden goose, battery, or puppet on a string.

I hate the idea of people hurting others for the sake of art... triggering them to bring out their talents. Some of these celebrities are not creative at all, therefore they have to get their energy and ideas from random people that they know will never get any attention. 

Some of these celebrities' parents are the ones that sold them out for money and fame. A lot of them were abused or traumatized from early childhood. A lot of them forcibly had demons conjured up into their vessels, demons that wanted to be worshipped by humans. 

I do not judge them for being demons or having demons. I am in the same boat, unfortunately. However, I believe that God has given me the awareness and the power to be able to resist a certain amount of my darkness. I try to use that to everyone's advantage vs. just being a f*ck-up. If I'm going to be chaotic and f*ck shit up, I want it to be in a good ways. 

I am standing outside of my room still... Sometimes I cannot handle the cold. This is not one of those times. The chill in the air is somehow comforting. It might partially be because of coffee and kratom, which definitely tend to raise my body temperature. It is also nice to be out in open space instead of cooped up in my room. Although, I absolutely love my solitude. 

I am angry that a stranger (or someone that appeared to be a stranger) invaded that the other day. I hate to even give the geezer any shine here, especially since he claimed to be a ""professional"". He touched me without permission, he lied to me, he wasted my time and money, he pretended to care about me, he kept calling me fragile, and continously spoke in detail about humiliating and traumatic memories, including a past s*xual assault that I had barely spoken to anyone about outloud. 

It's like he was taunting me for it. I have never knowingly taunted someone about anything like that, and can't understand how anyone would speak jokingly or lightly about such topics. I am sorry if anyone thinks I would do such a thing on purpose like others have done to me. If this whole thing is some sort of initiation, I don't want to be a part of it. You can't force that without consequences. 

He knew how I felt about having people in my space and did everything he could to get under my skin, just because I had told him to make himself comfortable. He laid in my bed without asking, more than once. He even exposed his private parts. I could (and probably should) have made him leave after that, but I felt bad for him because he was old. First he told me he was 52, then 57. Professional, huh?

He tried to play victim when I finally made him leave, then he tried to come back in after banging on my door and accusing me of stealing his ID. I told him that I would call the police because I knew things would escalate if he continued on harassing me. I told him to get the f*ck away from my door. He even came back the next day, having the nerve to ask me for a piece of paper. Again, I told him to get the f*ck away from my door. 

I hope I don't have to encounter anymore characters like that one. I hope he gets what he deserves for what he did to me, because I don't think I deserved it. I was just trying to help him. ",1,1738959375.0,Diary,0,1.0,False

I was looking at credit karma and saw my total credit card debt at 20k. I feel like I've barely bought anything and have been making higher than my monthly payments which is taking so much if my monthly income (about $2200 after tax). I also have 30k in student loans. 

I'm trying to find a debt consolidation company but I am having trouble trusting these places. And one I thought would be good apparently makes you default on your payments and I refuse to do that. My credit payment history is 100 percent and have never dipped. And a surgery next week with no pto. 

Any recommendations for debt consolidation or recommendations on decreasing debt? 

I think it'd be helpful for my bills and shit so that's below. 

Income $2400 
Rent 500
Phone 30
Gas 150
Student loans 200 (I got lucky here)
Credit cards 700 (minimum, I've been trying to pay closer to a grand)
Cat insurance 30
Cat food 85 (childhood cat had organ failure that could have related to cheap food, I won't risk that again)
Groceries 100-150 but this should drop because I'm not buying for the household anymore 
Car / life / bike / renters / insurance 215
I owe money to my mom 100
Going out / fast food / coffee 150-200  (I am working on limiting myself to once a week) 

I know I can cut down on going out and stuff and I am working on it. I barely got out and when I do, my bf pays 4 out of 5 times. I do get coffee or fast food, although I've been doing well on limiting that. 

I am planning on pulling my cards spending tracker thing to see but it's so hard to not feel hopeless.

Tldr: I'm 20k in debt, I feel like I've limited so much already and I don't know what to do. I don't want to file bankruptcy and the debt consolidation companies all look like scams or shitty options. I'm looking for advice or options or even just fellow people indebt.

However, I don’t think this journey is for me right now. I started this so that I can save money during a time when I am not making much but I quickly realized I do not have a shopping or spending problem. I have an income problem. I am not buying clothes or makeup or even more than a coffee or two per month (and only in social settings) but I find myself running low on cash every single month. I cannot afford anything from my red list in the first place, so I don’t need a challenge to prevent me from spending on these things anyway. I know this is temporary for me and I will hopefully find a job when I graduate this year, but I think the weight of having this challenge hang over me when it is already and unwillingly my lifestyle seems futile. I hope this makes sense and I apologize for the rant. I wish you all the best of luck on your journeys and I hope to check in with you soon when I am in a better place to do this.

Last week I had the 50g glucose test and felt fine, just a bit nauseous after I had the drink, but it was positive. This week I went back for the 75g one, and with the fasting, the higher glucose, etc, I was miserable during the test and felt lightheaded and nauseous. I ate a high protein snack, drank water, and had a coffee in the car before driving home hoping that would do the trick. Halfway through my 15 min drive home I started to get lightheaded again and almost passed out. The weather and visibility was very bad so I was in the position where pulling over was also very dangerous. 

I thankfully made it home fine but want to warn others that this can happen, everything I saw beforehand talked about how you would feel during the test and before eating. I am still pretty lightheaded and feel off several hours later and wouldn’t want to be driving, and my googling has told me this is a pretty typical experience.
