1hboo98,https://www.reddit.com/r/BusinessEnglishPro/comments/1hboo98/making_small_talk_with_new_connections/,Making small talk with new connections,"When you’re networking, small talk can help build rapport—but be careful how you approach it. 



**Keep It Neutral** 

Start with broad, safe topics like the event you’re at, the work environment, or industry news. Avoid anything too personal until you get a sense of the other person’s comfort level.

* ""How are you finding this event? Have you been to many conferences like this before?""
* ""I saw that our industry’s really evolving with AI lately—what are your thoughts on that?""



**Adjust Based on Personality** 

Pay attention to body language and tone of voice. Some people will open up more if you ask about their professional experiences, while others might appreciate something less formal.

* For someone more reserved, you might say: ""I noticed your team is doing some impressive work. How long have you been with the company?""
* For someone more outgoing, you could ask: ""I hear this city is great for food! Do you have any restaurant recommendations?""



**Avoid Assumptions** 

Remember that people from different cultures or backgrounds might have different comfort levels with small talk topics. Don’t assume everyone enjoys discussing the same things.

* **For colleagues from a direct communication culture** (like the US or Germany), they might appreciate you getting straight to the point after a little small talk.

Example: ""It was great chatting—should we get into the agenda for today’s meeting?""



* **For colleagues from indirect communication cultures** (like Japan or Mexico), they may prefer more time building the relationship before diving into business matters.

Example: ""Shall we have a coffee or tea before we start the meeting? I’d love to catch up with you.”



By keeping small talk neutral at first and paying attention to cultural and personal cues, you’ll be able to make stronger connections without overstepping boundaries.

Hi everyone! 

Recently got Lelit Anna and struggle to get the pressure to work properly. 

The pressure gauge goes up very slowly even on finer grind and seems to reach 3-4 bars only. I started with coarser setting and made it finer until the coffee barely dripped out. If I pull the shot for longer the pressure continues rising very slowly up to 8 bars sometimes but that happen at a 1 minute mark or later.

I also tried using the blind basket and the issue seems to persist (did it according to instructions, turning pump for 10s on, 10s off) 

Wanted this specific model for a while and ordered from abroad so the return process is going to be difficult. Also there doesn’t seem to be an official repair centre where the warranty would work in the city I’m at. 
So if it’s possible to repair it home I would rather try that, any advice on how to resolve it would be very appreciated!

**Standard V60 Brew Recipe:**

12g of coffee beans and 200ml of water.

1. Start by grinding your coffee beans to a medium-fine consistency. This is key to ensuring that your coffee will extract properly and taste delicious. Once you’ve ground your beans, it’s time to prepare your V60 dripper. Place the filter in the dripper and rinse it with hot water to remove any papery taste.
2. Next, add your ground coffee to the filter and give it a little shake to level out the grounds. Wet the coffee with a small amount of water, just enough to wet all the grounds. This helps to release the flavors and aromas of the coffee.
3. Allow the coffee to rest for 40 seconds to allow it to bloom or release carbon dioxide gas. This is an important step in the brewing process, as it helps to ensure that your coffee will extract evenly.
4. After 40 seconds, pour water over the coffee grounds until you reach 50% of the total water weight.
5. Allow the coffee to rest for an additional 30 seconds. This will allow the coffee to extract properly and ensure that you get the best flavor possible. After 30 seconds, pour the rest of the water over the coffee grounds.

Two months later, I got the news: Andrew and Bella were getting married because Bella was pregnant.

It didn’t take a genius to figure out what had happened. For all the years those two women sneered at my mother, their methods weren’t much better. Well, maybe a little better—at least Bella managed to secure the wedding ring.

Their wedding went ahead as planned, with half the company in attendance. The ceremony was held at a luxury five-star hotel owned by Crest, reportedly an extravagant and over-the-top affair.

I sat at my desk, flipping through the private investigator’s latest report. Amanda had already extorted millions from Delilah by this point.

The dense text on the page made my head throb, so I closed the file, took my coffee, and stood by the window, staring out at the cityscape.

Unbidden, my mind drifted to memories of Andrew—his clean, genuine smile and the way he used to say he loved me, again and again, like a promise.

It would be a lie to say I didn’t feel any regret. After all, we’d come so close to something real.

A knock on my office door pulled me from my thoughts. Turning, I saw Ezra standing there in a sharp suit, looking every bit the picture of composure. He should have been at the wedding, yet here he was.

His gaze was intense, making it impossible to hide.

Feeling a twinge of discomfort, I broke the silence. “Coffee?”

He nodded, stepping inside. “Let me guess—you didn’t bother researching me. I’m a certified coffee snob.”

I poured him a cup, handing it over without ceremony.

He took one sip and made a face. “What is this? Dishwater? Or something boiled in a fish pan?”

I rolled my eyes, making no effort to humor him. “Take it or leave it. Around here, coffee’s either black, with sugar, or with cream. Don’t expect anything fancy.”

“You’re not at the wedding,” I pointed out.

He set the cup down with a clink. “Andrew was set up by Bella.”

I couldn’t hold back a laugh. “So? If he really didn’t want this, he could’ve gone to the police for assault. Or he could at least still report her for coercion or extortion. Instead, he let her manipulate him with a pregnancy. So, yeah, maybe he’s a victim, but he’s far from innocent.”

Ezra smirked bitterly. “Do you always have to be so sharp, Alice? You leave no room for others—or yourself.”

“And what’s your plan?” I asked, cutting to the chase. “Defend your poor nephew? Drag me, the ex, to crash the wedding? Save your energy. Even without Bella pulling her stunts, Andrew and I were never going to be some fairy-tale couple who got back together and lived happily ever after.”

“It’s just frustrating,” he admitted, exhaling heavily. “We spent years raising someone like Andrew, only for him to get trapped by someone like her. You’d feel the same way if it were your family.”

“Frustrated? Please.” I scoffed. “Do you think I haven’t felt that way before? There are plenty of things in life I’ve had to swallow, even when they made me sick.”

The thought of Delilah and Bella basking in their victory at the wedding made my teeth clench. It wasn’t the wedding itself that got to me—it was the satisfaction on their faces.

“How about we shake things up a little?” Ezra suggested, leaning in with a mischievous glint in his eye.

I arched an eyebrow. “What exactly do you mean by that?”

His lips curved into a slow, devilish smile. “Wouldn’t you like to see how fun it is to cause them a little chaos?”

Catching on, I hooked my arm through his with a smirk. “Lead the way.”",7,1733902522.0,stories,5,1.0,False

This past weekend me and my boyfriend (20f, 19m) went to target and we were approached by another couple in their early to mid 30s, we were playing mario cart and they wanted to join in nothing weird, we started talking and they talked about their religion and how they just moved from new york to here; Florida. I had told them I was inbetween jobs and my boyfriend was in construction and they said they wanted to help our situation which we thought was weird because we didnt say anything about our situation and we exchanged numbers, I honestly thought they had no friends since they moved here and wanted other couple friends.

A couple days later my boyfriend got a call from them asking if we could meet today about an opportunity, we said yes and we went and they kept calling it a concept meeting, once again this was the second time we had met them.

When we met they were nice bought us coffee and told us their story.

They told us they were stuggling years ago and wanted to make money and move out and got introduced to another couple who asked them where they wanted to be in life and they invested money into them, they told us they never asked for money back but they had to listen and follow everything the couple told them to do in order to make this life they have now. They mentioned how they wanted to move in before getting married but the couple told them to get married before because thats what christians do. 

When they asked if we wanted to meet the couple we said we could set up a meeting but thats when they told us that it wasnt a for sure thing, they said over 30 couples are waiting to meet them and that we had to be chosen to be mentored and invested in and that it would cost us nothing but we had to be picked by the couple.

Im not sure if this is weird, I told others about this and they said it sounds like were about to be indoctrinated into a cult. Are these people just nice or should the sirens be blaring.",7,1733902404.0,cults,10,1.0,False

Second cup? Suddenly it’s getting cold halfway through. The light also isn’t the color I set it to anymore. I take the cup off the coaster and set it back down and now the cup is empty in the app? Do this a few times, force reset the app. Same thing. Reset the cup. Same thing. I look down a few minutes later and it’s working again and heating my half cup of coffee back to the temperature I had set. I go to take a sip and it’s cold even though the app just told me it has reached the temperature I had set. Now it’s room temperature. I revisit the coffee 10 minutes later and I can barely drink it because it’s super hot even though the temp was set to 135f. I just chugged the rest of the cup so I wouldn’t have to bother with it anymore. 

I don’t really know what to think about it now. I hope it was just a fluke but from what I’ve read here it seems to be just another complaint to toss on the enormous pile.

What to eat beforehand?,"I’m going to a dance class tonight (contemporary/modern). It’ll be the first time in a little over a year. I danced competitively as a child, and kept it up through my mid-twenties but then fell off a bit when I moved countries and started grad school. When I was 30, I started to go to classes again and while I mostly enjoyed it, I would frequently get nauseated or dizzy. I kind of stopped going after awhile (yet again).

I’m 32 now and ready to pick myself up and try again after I’ve lost 20 kgs, built some muscle, and got some health concerns under control.

But I’m worried about the nausea and dizziness. So I’m here to ask: what can I eat and drink (or what should I NOT eat) beforehand? 

Modern dance involves a bunch of rolling on the floor, turning quickly, and is generally just high intensity cardio. I know, for example, that drinking coffee too soon before the class tends to upset my stomach. So I’ll avoid that. The class starts at 7 pm so I’m thinking maybe a light “dinner” of oatmeal or something around 6? 

Maybe I should also mention that I’m actively still trying to lose weight and I’m currently in a slight calorie deficit, focusing a lot on getting enough protein and fiber, slightly low-carb (battling PCOS as well).

1hbo2us,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1hbo2us/quick_confession_about_physical_touch_feeling/,"Quick confession about physical touch feeling nice, turned rant about love life. ","I don't know how I can word this without sounding weird.

I was getting an x-ray done today, and they usually need to move you or the board a little to get it right, right. But instead of telling me how to move, she just moved me for me, I guess. Like she felt my back, than positioned my torso and waist (just by rotation on the z-axis) to be correct. 

I was NOT turned on or anything like that, it was more just, a warmth I suppose. 

It felt really weird but also really nice. I felt nearly like nostalgia but for nothing in the past. It felt like something I had missed for a while. 

But it also felt like something new. It felt like exactly what I'm looking for in a relationship. Just soft hands to hold and to hold me back. Nothing sexual, just something nice. 

The whole still just feels wrong though, because she was (I'm guessing) maybe late thirties early forties probably. And I'm still really young (an adult (at least by law) but still young). So I feel like I shouldn't have enjoyed it or treasured it I suppose in the way that I did. 

And now with how much everything is sexualized it becomes so hard to say anything without worrying about someone interpreting it as sexual. Like if I simply said ""she touched me"" then at the very least, some people would assume I meant in inappropriatly. 

I can't word shit. 

Each time I think about a relationship, I'm thinking of what I want as something where we both love and care for each other. A warm body to be next to. I'm not constantly obsessing and desiring sex as it seems so many other people are. And this women just lightly touching my side, sort of I guess made me see what it is that I know I'm missing. I guess it was a tender touch? I don't know that just sounds like a way someone could describe it but idk if it's correct. 

I just want someone in my life. But I also don't want to settle for someone because I simply just want anyone. I want the right person. Or at least someone feasible as the right person. And with college coming up in 7 or so months, I worry about starting anything right now.

(Now we're kind just transitioning to a romance vent. So buckle up.)

And it's not like I just haven't found anyone. I've found people, I'm just scared and I don't know if they would feel the same. But I'm not so much worried about rejection itself (I do still have rejection sensitivity though, we looove ADHD) but more so that everyone I know knows each other. So I don't want to ask someone out, get rejected, then end up being discussed. Furthermore, I don't want to then ask someone else I like out, because then I worry that would give me a horrible image by asking people out.

Of course I would space them out so they aren't right next to one another, but I still worry about people talking about me. 

And yes. I know I'm not the center of the universe. I know I think people think and talk about me more than they actually do. I know everyone is too focused on themselces to notice other people's mistakes. However, I have heard people talk. I heard some of my friends talk about a guy who asked someone to homecoming every year and got rejected each time. I don't want to be that person. Or at least talked about in a similar way. 

It doesn't help I worry so much about my appearance and everyone tells me not to. 

Oh. I just remembered. Relationships also could be worrisome for me as my parents were divorced. So now I think I constantly need reassurance because it was quickly cemented into my brain the possibility of false love. I only realized this today. 

So let's recap.

I want a relationship. The lady doing my xray positioned me and made me feel what I have been missing and now I miss it more. I can't be in a relationship because I can't ask anyone out for multiple reasons. Then I also need constant reassurance and think people don't like me despite being directly told otherwise by such person. I also feel a relationship could lower my anxiety as I would have someone I could hug and hold hands with and talk to. But my very little experience shows that relationships simply just stress for me because I need the reassurance and never believe the person. 

Alrighty, now let's talk about some of the people I like and my concerns. 

Also that I feel like a horrible pig as many people have stated about men due to the fact that nearly every girl I'm friends with, I think about asking out. Of course feelings are stronger for some more than others but still. They are my friends, not a list of possible choices. 

But anyway, whatever. 

So the girl I want to ask out more than anyone is disinterested in romantic relations, at least currently. But she is so fun, and I know she likes me (maybe not in that way, but I at least know she doesn't dislike me). She relieves so much of my stress just by being there. She makes me actually feel loved by the people around me because she helps me see it. But I can't ask her out. 

Then another girl. Best friends with the first girl, nearly inseparable. She is very similar and also very different to the first one. Over time I feel like I might have devolved more feelings for her now but I can't tell. I don't know if I am just stuck on certain ideas but not actually feel how I think. Anyway. This girl is just really cute, and she has the best outfits. I know it's a weird topic, but for some reason I always love what she's wearing, whether it be a homemade pirate costume (I got a thing for corsets) or a homecoming dress and everything in between. But her and I alight so much together. Not that we don't laugh similar amounts with other people, but at least for me it feels kind of different. We also both have ADHD so we can relate on many things and being around each other is just more fun because of it. However she is also disinterested in romance, at least currently. 

Now for the third! (I'm impressed if you've stayed this long. I talk a lot and add far too many unnecessary bits and pieces.) 
She's just such a nice person. She has a certain laugh that almost seems paired with blushing (can't tell) that's just really cute. I can't not smile when I hear it. And when I was in the hospital, she brought me a gift box with a (very well) hand painted card. Then once I got home from the hospital she brought me homemade cookies out of nowhere. Now, she IS just a rely nice person to begin with, but would she have done that for everyone? And I got coffee with her a little while back. A couple does later I asked her if she thought it was a date or not. She said something along the lines of ""I don't really know"" with some nervous laughter. If she thought it had the possibility of being a date, would she have gone if she wasn't interested in me? I don't know. The problem there though, is that she and her family are very Christian while I'm agnostic. I don't know if that would somehow pose a problem. I know for a fact neither her nor I would be disrespectful to the others beliefs, nor would we argue who's are correct. We do share our ideas and beliefs and it's interesting hearing the way another side sees things. 

Finally, last one. 
I don't really know all too much about her. I know that she is both cute and beautiful at the same time and she is good at art. I have insight on any but of her personality though. So my crush for her is based solely off of appearances and the fact that she is polite. We never talk to each other. We're in the same club so sometimes we might say something. But I've rarely ever spoken to her. When I got back from the hospital, on my first day back in school, I got plenty of greetings and a few hugs - - 1 from each of the first two girls as well as three others from teachers that like me (the only reason I count, is because after that, there were a total of seven times I've ever hugged someone not family. And those first two were also from the first girl. All this year, as well. After 18 years, I got seven total hugs all of which occurred in a single year. This girls greeting stood out to me though. Being that we had never talked, it surprised to begin with that she greeted me at all. Everyone else who greeted me was friends or teachers. But then she also asked how I was doing. She was the only one. Now I'm not wishing other people asked how I'm doing after two weeks in the hospital, I'm just shocked that the only one who did, was someone I never talk to. We had brief conversation after that; she approached a little closer (from like 4 feet away to 3 or 3.5) half way through the conversation. Now on one hand, she could have just been being nice. But it ws just so odd to me. It wasn't normal and it made me wk Der if she likes me. And lastly. The issue with asking her out is that I am unaware of her current status, and she's a junior while I'm a senior, which isn't a huge deal, but it still could be weird.",1,1733901358.0,confessions,1,1.0,False

1hbo1cs,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1hbo1cs/the_ultimate_guide_to_choosing_the_perfect_pouf/,The Ultimate Guide to Choosing the Perfect Pouf for Any Room,"Poufs are one of the most versatile and stylish additions to any [home decor](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/). Whether you're looking for extra seating, a cozy footrest, or a unique statement piece, a pouf can elevate the charm of your [house decor](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/). But with so many options available, how do you choose the perfect pouf for your living space? This ultimate guide will help you find the right [pouf seating](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/poufs) that suits your style and needs.

# 1. Define the Purpose of Your Pouf

The first step in choosing the perfect pouf is understanding its function in your space. Are you looking for:

* **Additional Seating:** A sturdy pouf can double as extra seating when you have guests.
* **A Footrest:** A softer, cushioned pouf works great as a footrest for your favorite chair or sofa.
* **Decorative Accent:** Add texture and color to your home decor with a pouf that complements your aesthetic.
* **Storage Solution:** Some poufs come with hidden compartments, offering a practical way to store small items.

# 2. Select the Right Material

The material of your pouf not only impacts its durability but also its visual appeal. Here are some popular options:

* **Leather:** Adds a sophisticated and timeless touch to your house decor. Perfect for a modern or industrial look.
* **Cotton or Fabric:** Offers a softer, more casual vibe, ideal for boho or farmhouse interiors.
* **Jute or Woven Textures:** Perfect for natural or rustic-themed spaces, adding an organic charm to your room.

# 3. Consider the Size and Shape

Poufs come in various sizes and shapes, so it’s important to choose one that fits well within your space.

* **For a Small Room:** Opt for a compact pouf that doesn’t overwhelm the space.
* **For a Living Room:** A larger [poufs for living room](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/poufs) can serve as a centerpiece or coffee table alternative.
* **Shapes:** Round poufs are versatile and blend well with most styles, while square or rectangular poufs work great for modern and minimalist designs.

# 4. Match Your Style

Your pouf should seamlessly blend with the rest of your home decor. Consider these tips:

* For a **bohemian look**, choose poufs with intricate patterns, tassels, or bright colors.
* For a **contemporary style**, go for clean lines and neutral tones like white, grey, or beige.
* For a **vintage vibe**, pick poufs with rich textures like velvet or embroidered designs.

# 5. Think About Placement

Where you place your pouf can impact its utility and visual appeal. Some ideas include:

* **Living Room:** Use a pouf as a cozy addition next to your sofa or as a unique coffee table.
* **Bedroom:** Place a pouf at the foot of your bed or in a reading corner.
* **Entryway:** Add a pouf near the doorway for a stylish and practical spot to sit while putting on shoes.
* **Kids’ Room:** Lightweight pouf seating is perfect for play areas or storytime.

# 6. Explore Multipurpose Poufs

For a functional and stylish touch, look for multipurpose poufs. Some poufs come with removable tops for hidden storage, while others can be transformed into side tables by adding a tray.

# 7. Budget Considerations

Poufs are available at various price points, so set a budget before you shop. Whether you want a budget-friendly option or a designer piece, there’s a pouf to fit every need.

# Final Thoughts

A pouf is more than just an accessory; it’s a multifunctional piece that can elevate your house decor. Whether you’re adding pouf seating to your living room or a decorative accent to a bedroom, the right pouf can transform any room into a cozy and stylish retreat.

Take your time to explore materials, sizes, and styles to find the perfect pouf for your space. Remember, the best pouf is the one that combines functionality with your personal taste, making it a statement piece in your home decor.",1,1733901172.0,u_homeandsoul,0,1.0,False

1hbnxza,https://www.reddit.com/r/DesiFragranceAddicts/comments/1hbnxza/my_first_fragrance_buy_story_details_davidoff/,My first fragrance buy Story + Details | Davidoff coolwater EDT,"A year ago me would have not imagined I'd be spending more than 500 on a perfume .

Few weeks ago I randomly went to shopper stops' fragrance aisle and there I tried like 20-25 designer fragrances , like Hugo boss , Lacoste , Calvin Klein , Versace , etc .  After me and my friend were on our way back , we saw a small billboard of a guy jumping into water which was an ad for Davidoff's coolwater lineup , So we jokingly tried it too and I don't know why I asked that sales person to spray a few on my wrist too . Due to trying out so many fragrances and coffee bean simultaneously I was nose blinded and didn't got any thing from that . When I was on my way home and smelled my wrist , I fell in love with the simple showery gel and clean aquatic vibe of it and in it's dry down state it changed it's smell into something a little different from previous state , which was new to me as I have been using deodorants and Wild stone and other affordable perfumes , which tends to be linear and doesn't change at all in any of it state .

After this , I searched this scent about a dozen time and learning more about it , getting to know about perfume community and resellers . At that time MOM Perfumes was bombarded on my feed and I was also hooked by their prices , but not rushing in , I looked up their reviews and the trust factor from their customer where I saw a thread on this subreddit and It was explaining how their customer services was non existing and their long waiting and delivery time . Worried by this I asked on this subreddit from you guys about any other trust worthy and legit seller , and thanks to you all I got to know about a lot of them and thanks to you all for helping out a newbie and by the response I was shocked as to how many of you came to help . From the overall pricing and experience I went with - Talib Musa Usman and It was pretty smooth and quick . I texted him and told him I'd like to place an order and he gave me the pricing and I ordered it . The bottle arrived on 5th day and the packaging was damn good , Double layered bubble wrap which was solid in place and firmly wrapped .

About Scent : Davidoff coolwater EDT , I am no perfumer so I'll tell you in simple word how it smells . In opening it smells like a burst of icy shower gel cum hair wax type freshness blast  , after settling down it smells even better giving off a salty and like a little fresh spicy sea water , and it's dry down is a treat for me - going towards that powdery feel while retaining it sea water characteristics and maybe a hint of something which reminded me of wet wood's smell .

Performance : Decent - 4 to 5 hours of pure performance and after that 6-7 hours of light and modest performance and it's one of the first which I could smell myself and my nose didn't completely went nose blind

Projection : 1.5 - 2hr hour for good one hand distance

Sillage - It's there around 2 feet of radius for the first 2 hour , like you'd not fill the room or choke anyone but people would notice your scent if they are within that radius

Pricing + Seller :  I got this for Rs.2600 which way less than what that retailer at shopper stop asked me for (Rs5100) . I bought it from Talib Musa Usman - 95825 64019 or website - The Fragrance Heaven , Nice and quick and got it within 5 days and as I have used the original in the mall and know what the original smells like , his products are original and authentic ( PS - I am not getting paid or anything to say any of this or promote anyone or anything , It's just because it was my first buy I wanted to share my journey with others who might need help in future )

1hbnxoy,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1hbnxoy/adhd_a_daily_adventure/,ADHD: A Daily Adventure ,"

So, here's a little story about living with ADHD. Picture this: You wake up determined to have a productive day. You grab your coffee, sit at your desk, open your laptop, and then... Oh wait, you forgot to put the laundry in the washer. Okay, no big deal, you’ll do that real quick. On the way to the laundry room, you notice the cat knocked over a plant. Now there’s dirt everywhere. You clean it up but—uh oh—the vacuum cleaner’s filter needs to be emptied. Thirty minutes later, you're scrolling through Reddit, holding the filter, with absolutely no memory of what you were supposed to be doing in the first place.

That’s ADHD in a nutshell. It's like your brain is a web browser with 37 tabs open, three of them playing music, and you have no idea where the sound is coming from. Some days, it’s frustrating. You feel like you’re constantly racing against your own thoughts. Other days, it’s almost funny how chaotic life gets.

But ADHD isn’t just about being distracted or hyper. It’s also creativity at 3 a.m., hyper-focusing on something you’re passionate about, or coming up with solutions no one else considered. It’s a mix of challenges and superpowers.

If you have ADHD—or suspect you might—just know you’re not alone. It’s okay to forget, to struggle, to have days where it feels like your brain is on fast-forward and rewind at the same time. Just take a breath, find what works for you, and keep going. Oh, and maybe write down what you were doing before the cat incident next time.

Anyone else got stories like this? I’d love to hear them!

I started proper fasting about 2 years ago when enough was enough I put on heaps of weight during COVID and needed to change I started with a 3 day, which was very hard and attempted a few more with not much success. I eventually settled on omad I would eat lunch at work whatever I wanted and that was it over a period of about 8 months I lost 15 kg, you could probably do it faster but I stumbled alot and my family get violently offended if I don't eat the food they offer. What I have learnt is this
*Consitancy is key
*Sometimes you have to eat and this is not the end of the world. (This is important to accept) Do not beat yourself up tommorrow is another day.
*Water and black coffee will get you through.
*You will be more productive in the morning on an empty stomach.
* I used to get chronic heartburn which has been cured. 
* Fasting completely changed how I think about food and I there are many opertunitys to learn what food your body does and doesn't like. ( You can easily experiment with elimination)
*It is easy to take it too far and your body will tell you please listen.
*Hydration hydration hydration.

Recently I have started going to the gym. I never would have thought I would step foot in one, I had preconceived Ideas about them and they were wrong. I advocate going to the gym and coupling it with fasting, fasting alone will lose weight but resistance training is key for the last push. Just start easy light weights and however many reps you can do, find instructions for a push, pull, legs regimen. If you like how much sharper you feel fasting, the gym will change your life. I was working 10 hours a day 7 days a week for the last 3 months and going to the gym 6 days, it was the antidote for my mental health in that work situation, previous jobs had me spiralling at the month mark but this 45 mins at the end of the day gave me so much more stamina physically and mentally.

I guess I just wanted to let people know who are starting out that it's not a quick fix it is hard and it takes a long time this journey has taken me 2 years I would say but I'm am really starting to love my body and myself and this is an amazing feeling that I want others to enjoy, te calorie deficit is king and you will get there if you stay consistent,

I am also a devout Christian and I feel like bringing up our religion and their experience in Masters of Theology is a good opportunity to build rapport and trust, and perhaps a nice break from your typical coffee chat structure of general and surface-level questions.

However, I'm also a bit concerned about bringing up religion in general and the power dynamics at play (me being in an entry-level position while they a senior manager). Nonetheless, I feel like bringing it up would make our coffee chat a bit more memorable and could help me stand out from the many other analysts in my position also asking them for a coffee chat.

1hbnrgf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hbnrgf/how_do_i_support_my_aunt_while_protecting_myself/,How Do I Support My Aunt While Protecting Myself?,"I (17F) need some advice on a complicated family situation. For context, I have an aunt who is just five years older than me. When I was younger, we got along well, but as we grew up, we started fighting more. We still have good moments occasionally, but things have become more strained, especially after her recent marriage and other events.

My aunt has struggled a lot with grief. All of her grandparents have passed away, the most recent being her grandfather on her father’s side, who died the day after her birthday. She’s deeply hurt by this and blames herself for his death, even though it wasn’t her fault. Everyone in the family has encouraged her to seek grief counseling, but she refuses, insisting she doesn’t need it.

About six months ago, she got married after knowing her husband for only seven months. I privately thought it was too soon but kept my opinions to myself and supported her. Leading up to the wedding, she often talked about canceling it because of frequent fights with her fiancé. Unfortunately, things didn’t improve after they got married. Their arguments continued, and they even joked about getting divorced. They lived in a small motel and fought about that too.

Then, my aunt found out she was pregnant. Despite actively trying for a baby, her pregnancy is very high-risk. My grandparents invited them to move in with them, hoping it would help. Around this time, I was staying with my grandparents too. While their arguments seemed to cool off slightly, one day everything boiled over.

On the day of my aunt’s husband’s friend’s wedding, they arrived at my grandparents’ house already fighting. My aunt was upset because her husband had gotten himself a hot coffee instead of the blended one she wanted, as the smell made her feel sick. I wasn’t paying much attention since I was playing video games on my grandpa’s computer with earbuds in to block out the yelling (fighting makes me anxious due to past trauma involving my mom’s abusive ex).

Then, my aunt threw her husband’s shoes at him, and they almost hit me. My grandparents managed to calm her down, but not before she said some really awful things about being pregnant that I don’t feel comfortable repeating. They left for the wedding but returned still fighting. This time, it was because her husband got drunk, even though she asked him not to. She wasn’t feeling well enough to drive, but he insisted he wasn’t drunk. It was obvious to all of us that he was.

Since my earbuds were dead, I couldn’t block out the yelling. My grandma brought up my childhood and said to my aunt’s husband, *“*You don't want your child to grow up like her, do you*?”* She was referring to how I grew up around my mom’s abusive ex, who was a drunk and caused a lot of harm. While I understand my grandma’s point, hearing that really hurt.

Afterward, my aunt refused to ride in the same car as her husband. I ended up driving her home while my grandma drove her husband separately. My grandma took him to the police to do a breathalyzer test, and it confirmed he was drunk.

Not long after that, I went home. My parents were upset about everything and decided to limit contact with my grandparents. Then, at Thanksgiving, my mom told me that my grandparents canceled Christmas celebrations because they don’t want my sister (12) and me around my aunt’s husband anymore. I later found out that my aunt’s husband had assaulted someone, though I don’t know all the details. Apparently, they even asked my dad about assault laws in our state.

Now, my aunt’s birthday is coming up, and she asked if I could spend one-on-one time with her to get our nails done. My mom said it’s my choice because I’m almost 18, but my younger sister isn’t allowed to go.

Here’s my dilemma I love my aunt and want to support her and her baby. Despite our fights, I care about her. But everything that’s happened with her husband has brought back a lot of painful memories for me. I’m not sure what to do. I’d really appreciate advice from anyone who doesn’t know me or my family.",1,1733900011.0,Advice,1,1.0,False
1hbnr8p,https://www.reddit.com/r/CSFLeaks/comments/1hbnr8p/rebound_pressure/,Rebound Pressure?,"Question: could this be rebound pressure/headache, if it started a few days after the patch?

Okay, starting this by explaining, because it makes a difference...please bear with me.

I never had traditional ""headaches."" I fell 4.5 year ago and smashed my face pretty well. Got discouraged with ENT, so just kind of...dealt with it. 

My face basically would get to varying levels of pressure, which I thought stemmed from my nose, because that's the center if it. Like, I can't wear glasses for more than maybe 30 minutes at a time for fear of it making it worse.

I finally got frustrated, and went to a new ENT. CT scan, MRI, and some nerve cream, and he recommends going to a neurologist since it's not bone driven.

Neurologist (thankfully the type of doctor who has a WE WILL FIGURE IT OUT attitude) thinks I likely have a CSF leak, based on what I explained, and the results in my MRI (stuff with my cerebellar tonsils and apparently mild brain sagging). 

Had the blood patch last Wednesday. Overall, mild headache, but more my normal headache headache, which is annoying but comes and goes, which went away. Nose had a few achy moments, but I was not feeling pressure...until Sunday night. I started feeling mild pressure like I had pre-blood patch.

I'm back to work, working remotely. My doctor who did the patch said caffeine was fine, even recommends it for headaches. I had some Saturday (like, 2/3 decaf coffee), didn't seem to have issues. So I had some Yesterday that was close to 1/2 decaf. 

Around mid-morning, my face starts aching more. It's on and off throughout the day. So I decide to try nixing the coffee, since other things said no.

Today...same thing. 

However, what I realized, is that it started getting noticeable after I would move to work in bed, which I had at about a 45 degree angle.  And I would get some, though not total, relief after being up for a while.

But in the mornings, it's not bad at all, after hours of being flat. Yet now, as I've been laying down for an hour or so, it's aching.

Don't even know if this was actually a leak, but if it was, could this possibly be what people would call a rebound headache? Or pressure, since that's what my issue was to begin with. 

Thanks in advance! I have a follow up with my original Neurologist Friday, but I'm going slightly nuts. Haha.

I generally use pre-grinded coffee because honestly in the past I just didn't have the time to grind the coffee beans and make it all at once. However, I am finally giving grinders a shot - I tried a manual grinder and I think it was either a bad product I received or I just didn't know how to use it? Anyway since my experience with manual grinder has been really bad - I wanted to just get a automatic grinder for all types of coffees. 

I like to switch things up every now and then and I keep experimenting with different roasts, and coffee types (I'm thinking of buying an espresso machine something also). So, I'm looking for a versatile grinder potentially with the ability to set the grind size level. I cannot seem to find any in India (I have a feeling I just don't know where to look), but because I'm new to India's coffee market, I'm honestly not sure which sites are legit and which are not. 

Any suggestion on what kind of grinders are available? Preferably under INR 18k, if you have suggestions above that please feel free to suggest them. If you know it's better to get it from outside of India, let me know about those as well.

Some are worth it, while others make you work a little harder than I’d like. But hey, if you like gaming, it’s another way to earn while having fun. 🎮🕹️

**Weekly Raffles: Win Up to 1,000 Points! 🎁**  
If you’re consistent and do at least one survey every day for seven days, you get entered into a raffle. Last time, I won 500 points (roughly $5), which covered my coffee costs for the week! ☕ Not a bad deal, so I try to keep up with the streak.

**Leveling Up: Unlock Extra Perks 📈**  
There’s a level system too, which makes it feel a bit like a game. Each time you level up, you unlock features and earn extra points. Maybe one day I’ll hit level 99 and be the ""Survey King""! 👑😂

**Quick Bonus: Use My Link for an Extra +10% on Surveys 🎉**  
If you use my link, you’ll get a 10% bonus on surveys for your first 24 hours, which means you can boost your points right from the start! It’s a win-win for both of us. 🎉

**Leaderboard System: Serious Effort Needed 😅**  
There’s also a leaderboard, but I’ll be honest—it’s a bit intense. I haven’t made it up there yet because you need to fill out a ton of surveys to stay on top. Maybe one day I’ll reach ""survey warrior"" status!

**Create Virtual Credit Cards with Your Points 💳**  
One of the coolest features: you can actually create virtual credit cards with your points. I made one for Amazon, and it worked perfectly. It’s a fun way to treat yourself with what you’ve earned!

If you’re looking to make a little extra in your free time, Prime Opinion is worth a shot. I’ve been using it while commuting or waiting around, and those points start adding up.

REALLY.","During today's hearing, Agent Robert Wheeler Jr., Assistant Director of the Critical Incident Response Group for the FBI, testified that the FBI's entire counter-drone budget is ""about $500,000"" 

That's half a million dollars that the FBI has allocated (out of a budget of around 10 billion) to counter one of the most significant domestic security threats to our infrastructure today (according to other witnesses who testified today and in previous hearings) and one of the fastest-changing technological platforms for delivery of deadly force or kinetic payload. 

Making some very rough assumptions, I believe that the FBI actually (not ironically and not an exaggeration) spends more on coffee than on counter-drone activity and platforms: 

Assume the taxpayers are funding some basic Folgers grinds agency-wide: 

One tub that makes about 240 cups is around 24 bucks if ordered through [ULine](https://www.uline.com/Product/Detail/S-24892/Coffee-and-Coffee-Supplies/Folgers-Regular-Classic-Roast-Coffee?pricode=WB0861&gadtype=pla&id=S-24892&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiA6t-6BhA3EiwAltRFGHsOqSr9iNIxFbMBWiH6jV5GLLV-lSQdej6MDTsX_GpRZXXy8jGurBoC7hMQAvD_BwE)

So that's about 10 cents a (small 6 oz) cup. 

Assume half of the FBI's 35,000 person workforce are coffee drinkers, and on average they drink 2 cups (12 oz) per day. 

That's 17,500 times 20 cents per day, or $3,500 per day (give or take). Let's say I'm overestimating and we'll round down to $3,000 per day. 

Assume that each agent works about 250 days per year (they get weekends and holidays and vacation, right?) 

So that's 250 x $3,000 = $750,000 per year. 

Maybe I'm overestimating. Maybe they get a government high-volume discount. Maybe it's only $700,000. 

That's still, very likely, in a very real world, hundreds of thousands more than they are spending on counter-drone technology and strategy. 

For real. 

I want a bigger tax refund. And I demand the FBI start buying the crappy generic coffee too. 

This is maddening, right?

Autumn comes around, it was time for Andrew’s father, Joseph Williams, to celebrate his 55th birthday.

The banquet was held at Calivor Pavilion, a beautiful garden-style hotel. The guest list was small—just family and close friends. Even Ezra had flown back from abroad for the occasion.

My father brought me along, and I knew exactly why. He was growing impatient; after all, Andrew and I had been dating for quite some time without any concrete steps forward. Nova desperately needed the Williams family’s support. Officially, I was attending as the daughter of a business partner, not as Andrew’s girlfriend, but I couldn’t help feeling excited at the chance to meet his parents.

At the banquet, I was everything you’d expect from the ideal daughter-in-law in their eyes: poised, polite, and charming. I earned one compliment after another from Andrew’s parents. His mother was so taken with me that she held my hand and declared herself as my Godmother.

Standing nearby, Ezra rolled his eyes, clearly unimpressed.

The evening was going smoothly until Andrew stepped away to take a phone call. When he returned, his face was tense, his expression strange.

I moved closer and whispered, “What’s wrong?”

Frowning, he replied, “There’s a woman on the phone claiming to be your mother. She says she’s outside and wants to… meet her future son-in-law.”

My stomach sank. This had to be Delilah’s handiwork. Even while scrambling to deal with Amanda, she still found time to stir up trouble for me.

Hearing us, Ezra came over. When he learned what was going on, he shrugged and said casually, “If she’s here, let her in. She’s your mom, after all. It’s a chance for the families to meet.”

Clearly, he had no idea what he was suggesting.

I glanced at Andrew, who looked away, his brows furrowed.

I had warned him about my mother before, so I understood the worry etched across his face.

“I’ll handle it,” I said quickly, heading toward the door.

But before I could reach it, my mother’s booming voice filled the banquet hall. “Oh, I’m so late for the in-law’s big birthday celebration! My bad, my bad—I owe everyone an apology!”

Heads turned as she strutted in, her voice echoing like a megaphone. Dressed in a tight pink dress that clung to her figure like it was painted on, with big curls, oversized hoop earrings, and a flashy designer handbag, she looked like a walking spectacle.

The room went silent. Guests exchanged bewildered glances, unsure of what to make of her entrance.

My father’s face turned dark as a storm cloud.

I rushed over to her, grabbing her arm. Keeping my voice steady, I said, “Let’s go home, Mom.”

She shook me off with a dramatic flourish. “Go home? Are you kidding? I’m here to celebrate my in-law’s birthday and meet my future son-in-law!”

With that, she pulled out a gift box wrapped in gaudy, glittering paper. She marched up to Joseph Williams, seated at the head of the table, and placed the box down in front of him with a flourish. “You must be the in-law! Look at you, so distinguished. Wishing you plenty of health, happiness, and lots of chubby grandkids soon!”

Joseph’s face hardened, and he turned his icy gaze toward Andrew.

Andrew lowered his head, stepping back silently.

Stepping in to salvage the situation, Ezra picked up the gift box with a polite smile. “I’ll accept this on behalf of my family,” he said smoothly.

My mother turned to him, her eyes lighting up like fireworks. “You must be Andrew! Such a handsome young man. My daughter has excellent taste! Here, I have something for you too,” she said, rummaging in her handbag and pulling out a smaller gift, shoving it into Ezra’s hands. “No need to be shy. We’re all family now!”

Ezra smiled awkwardly, scratching his nose. Under everyone’s watchful eyes, he had no choice but to take it.

Eventually, my father managed to drag her out of the banquet hall. As for me, I followed her out without sparing Andrew a single glance.

For the next week, Andrew didn’t contact me, and I didn’t reach out to him either. In the adult world, silence often says more than words.

One evening after work, as I left the office, I spotted Ezra waiting outside.

“Do you have time to talk?” he asked.

We ended up at a small café nearby. He ordered coffee, took a sip, and immediately grimaced. “This is the worst coffee I’ve ever tasted.”

I crossed my arms. “You didn’t come here to complain about coffee, did you?”

He set a thick notebook on the table. “Andrew asked me to return this to you.”

I stared at it. It was the notebook I’d given Andrew when we first started dating, filled with notes about his likes, dislikes, and everything I’d learned about him.

“Andrew’s been struggling,” Ezra said, his tone measured. “My brother and sister-in-law have been putting a lot of pressure on him. You understand, don’t you? Love isn’t always enough.”

“I do,” I said calmly. “With my background, my family, and my mother, I was never going to be good enough for your family. And Andrew wasn’t ready to fight for me.”

Ezra seemed surprised by my candor. He shook his head. “It’s not that you’re not good enough. I’ve just always felt the two of you weren’t a good match.”

I laughed softly. “You don’t need to sugarcoat it. I know my worth, and I won’t let your family’s rejection make me doubt myself. It’s not me who doesn’t measure up—it’s my family and the baggage that comes with it.

That scene my mother caused at the banquet? I know it was embarrassing for everyone. I’ve known who she is my whole life. Ever since she gave up on my father, she’s spent most of her life at gambling tables, never coming home unless she was completely broke. When she ran out of money, she’d throw me out and make me beg my father for more. I've been nothing more than a tool to her. The only reason she probably didn't abandon me, was because she needed me—as leverage.

He listened in silence, then sighed after a moment. “Honestly, I’m starting to think it’s my nephew who doesn’t deserve you.”

“Whether he does or doesn’t doesn’t matter anymore,” I said, standing to leave.

“What about the notebook?” he asked.

“Throw it away for me,” I said, walking out the door.

Even so, I couldn’t help but feel hurt. I had loved him, after all. And yet, he didn’t even have the courage to say goodbye in person.

The autumn wind bit at my cheeks as I pulled my coat tighter. The streets were bustling with people hurrying home, their faces a blur as they passed me.

Andrew and I were like passengers on a train—our paths crossed for a while, but ultimately, we were headed in different directions.

To be honest, I knew it was over the moment my mother walked into that banquet. Maybe Andrew did love me, but he wasn’t ready to face the challenges that came with it.",9,1733899247.0,stories,8,0.92,False

Level 1: Purely cultural, no official statements, you will be judged by certain members for doing these, but no outer darkness yet. E.g. no caffeinated soda, take sacrament and pass it with only your right hand.

Level 2: Brought up in conference by non-prophets, not referenced in church materials, you will be judged a bit everywhere. E.g.blue shirts while passing the sacrament, no making out.

Level 3: Old prophet about it, referenced in literature, culturally very important, old people will definitely judge you a lot. E.g. no multiple piercings, no R rated movies, no dating before 16, no swearing, garments.

Level 4: Legit modern commandment spoken of often and intensely, not historically a commandment, supposedly God will judge you but not the people before you. E.g. No alcohol or tobacco, no coffee or tea, tithing as 10% of income, porn and masturbation.

Level 5: Modern and historical commandment that only the big wigs get to break. E.g. chastity/no adultery (exception: Joseph Smith), murder (exception: Nephi), lying (exception: lying for the Church per Boyd Packer), no idols (exception: Nelson rebranding and making that one Jesus statue the one you need to worship), Sabbath (exception: Steve Young AKA my childhood idol), steal (exception: Nephi again), covet (all the profits).

Level 6: The only commandment you must follow or you are out out: obey the current leader and ignore everything else. ",3,1733899015.0,exmormon,0,1.0,False

1hbnhuv,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Sad_Lunch8508/comments/1hbnhuv/why_great_coffee_is_the_secret_ingredient_to/,Why Great Coffee is the Secret Ingredient to Workplace Productivity,"Great coffee isn’t just a comfort; it’s a catalyst for productivity in the workplace. In many offices, coffee is the first thing employees turn to when they need a boost to start their day. While it may seem like a simple pleasure, the quality of the coffee offered at work can have a significant impact on employee focus, energy, and overall performance.

# The Power of Caffeine

At the heart of coffee’s productivity-enhancing power is caffeine, a natural stimulant known to increase alertness, improve concentration, and enhance cognitive function. Studies have shown that moderate caffeine consumption can boost memory, improve reaction times, and even elevate mood. When employees feel more energized and mentally sharp, they can tackle tasks more efficiently and effectively. This increase in focus and energy translates to better productivity, whether employees are working on individual tasks, collaborating in teams, or participating in meetings.

# Boosting Morale and Engagement

Coffee is also a morale booster. Offering high-quality coffee at work shows that a company values its employees’ comfort and well-being. A well-stocked coffee station is a small but impactful perk that can improve employee satisfaction and engagement. Employees who feel cared for are more likely to be motivated, engaged, and productive in their roles.

Additionally, coffee breaks provide opportunities for employees to step away from their desks, recharge, and interact with colleagues. These short breaks can reduce stress and help people return to their tasks with renewed focus. The social aspect of coffee breaks also fosters collaboration and team bonding, which can enhance creativity and problem-solving within the workplace.

# The Importance of Quality

Not all coffee is created equal. Low-quality coffee can have the opposite effect, leading to dissatisfaction, energy crashes, and even bad moods. When employees have access to great coffee—whether it’s a fresh brew, premium beans, or a well-maintained coffee machine—they’re more likely to experience the positive effects that fuel productivity.

In summary, [great office coffee](https://ace-vending.biz/office-coffee/) is far more than a luxury in the workplace; it’s a powerful tool for improving focus, morale, and overall productivity. By investing in quality coffee, companies can create an environment that supports and nurtures employee performance, helping to drive success in the workplace.",1,1733898907.0,u_Sad_Lunch8508,0,1.0,False

This ended up with us having a video chat tonight that turned pretty hot and heavy. During the video call she got a little pushy about coming over to her place to continue what we were talking about in person. At the time I just said no (3-5ish times) and brushed past it. I figured it was just her not being able to differentiate between a genuine no and me playing coy. Now that I’m done talking to her and blood flow is returning to the places it usually occupies I’m feeling kinda concerned about seeing her. We’re supposed to meet for coffee tomorrow, but now I’m not really feeling that interested in her. I don’t know if it’s the whole “come over to my place right now” thing, if I just wasn’t that into her to begin with and am just now noticing since my brain is working the horny out of its system or if casual dating just isn’t for me because I get cold feet.

1hbnc45,https://i.redd.it/6ghz5rbox56e1.jpeg,How can motion graphics benefit small businesses?," “Small Business + Motion Graphics = Match Made in Marketing Heaven” 

1️⃣ ""Alright, Who Stole My Attention Span?""
Let’s start with the elephant in the room—or should I say, the 3-second attention span in the room. You know it, I know it—nobody watches anything anymore unless it moves, sparkles, or dances (preferably all three). Enter motion graphics, the ultimate showstopper for small businesses trying to stand out. Static images? That’s so 2010. With motion graphics, you’re turning heads faster than a two-for-one coffee sale.


---

2️⃣ ""Budget Blues? Motion Graphics to the Rescue!""
Now, I know what you’re thinking: “Motion graphics sound expensive—do I have to sell my grandma’s cookie recipe to afford them?” Relax, nobody’s coming for Nana’s cookies. Motion graphics are surprisingly cost-effective. They’re like that friend who brings gourmet snacks to the party but swears they only spent $10. You can use them to make high-impact ads, snazzy social posts, and website animations—all without breaking the piggy bank.


---

3️⃣ ""From Bland to Brand in 30 Seconds!""
Here’s the thing: small businesses need to build trust, and nothing screams “I’m legit!” louder than professionally crafted visuals. Motion graphics give your brand that polished, “I’m-not-a-side-hustle” vibe. Whether it’s an animated logo or a quick explainer video, it’s like dressing your business in a tailored suit—except it doesn’t itch and doesn’t cost you your entire marketing budget.


---

4️⃣ ""Why Sell Once When You Can Loop Forever?""
You know what’s better than a killer sales pitch? A killer sales pitch that plays 24/7! Motion graphics don’t need sleep, coffee breaks, or PTO. Post them on social media, embed them in emails, or slap them on your website, and they’ll keep working harder than your intern during Black Friday. It’s like hiring a salesperson who never takes a lunch break.


---

5️⃣ ""Making Data Sexy Since... Well, Now!""
Ever tried explaining your revenue growth with a boring bar chart? Yawn. Turn that same data into an animated motion graphic, and suddenly, you’re the Picasso of pie charts. Small businesses can use motion graphics to transform dull numbers into dazzling stories that not only inform but impress. Because who doesn’t love a little razzle-dazzle with their ROI?


---

6️⃣ ""The Swiss Army Knife of Marketing""
Motion graphics can do it all—ads, explainer videos, product showcases, social media posts, you name it. It’s like having a marketing Swiss Army knife, except way cooler and without the risk of stabbing yourself. For small businesses, it’s the ultimate tool to level up your visuals, wow your audience, and make your competitors say, “Wait…how did they afford THAT?!”


---

✨ The Punchline?
Motion graphics aren’t just for big brands with big budgets. They’re for the scrappy, creative, underdog businesses who want to punch above their weight class. So, whether you’re selling cupcakes, consulting services, or custom llama socks (hey, no judgment), motion graphics can turn your small biz into a big deal.

So…what are you waiting for? Time to get moving!

It is one of the few coins that has proven to have grown steadily despite the difficult market conditions in late summer and has developed a hard core with its avid, convinced and unwavering community, similar to memecoin communities such as SHIB and PEPE recently, before experiencing incredible price explosions.

Although the price has dropped sharply, the distribution has improved significantly. Our number of holders has now reached almost 16,000 and the trend is clearly upwards (particularly the last 2 weeks). This means more than double since the ATH. The consolidation phase has eventually brought the community to its highest level. It went up numerically, is battle-tested, experienced, as ambitious and grinding as in the best of times and is now more convinced than ever.

The army is shilling 24/7 and wins each (fair) poll. The chads are promoting KENDU IRL, see much videos on X, competitions too. Even some passionate and highly talented artists are now representing our cult, check it out on the X profile. Some other fellows already made KENDU into a brand, especially with Kendu energy, coffee, jewelry and merch. KENDU energy. According to my information, there are plans to expand the energy drinks distribution from Australia and USA to other continents.

The most recent highlight is the free Certik audit we achieved, what took a lot of perseverance, willpower and conviction to reach 50,000 votes for that (please note: you can only vote once per day on Certik). The KENDU community is the second after Pepe to have managed this. This even impressed Certik so much that they suggested we create a joint awareness campaign. 
In addition to the achievement itself, the audit will massively increase the public credibility of the project and thus raise the interest from the top CEX (for listings) and, accordingly, from many new investors on this market. 

The significant increase in our holder count mentioned above shows that the community’s work has already paid off noticeably. Moreover, the number of X-Followers has more than doubled within 1.5 weeks and is now almost 30,000. On Reddit, the number of members has now risen to over 5,000 and in the TG chat to almost 11,000. KENDU even already maintains a Stocktwits page (as the 2nd meme coin ever).

What’s next:

- listing on CoinDCX (India's largest CEX)

- Certik awareness campaign

- launching NFT platform: revenues will be used to further CEX listings

- bridging to the Solana chain at the eoy (via Wormhole) and to Base (2025): new market accesses means more volume and liquidity

- Kendu event in Melbourne (February 2025)

- introduction of Kendu by DEV Miazaki at Shibcon 

- ...

KENDU is more than just a meme coin, it’s a movement. On the one hand, Miazaki has built an extraordinary community that spreads Kendu as a cult and brand, and on the other hand, he is cooking up the development of technological features such as the NFT platform or the multichain solution, which maximizes the Defi market reach for Kendu. 
KENDU is my alpha conviction play for the upcoming altseason, as it combines proven old-school approaches from well-established meme coins (but even more intense) with cutting-edge technological features. In addition, I have never seen a meme coin promoted by the community with real products for the project, which honestly fascinates me.

DYOR. I have been convinced since the first second I joined and I tell you, if you want to prefer an easier resp. a retired life, now is an excellent time to join the KENDU movement.

We don’t gamble, we work!

I'll let you all decide what you think.  I've had several experiences of waking in the space of in between awake and asleep.  The most recent, that I attributed to exploding head syndrome was hearing my name and snapping awake suddenly.  Before this I've heard knocks, items dropping, and, again, my name being said.  

The most memorable half awake experiences happened in the same house.  One was a sound, but the other was a vision. I lived in a house with multiple staircases and I was in the top floor.  I was sleeping around noon because I was sick, and my cat was sleeping in the bend of my knees but he wasn't visible to me, I just knew he was there.  We had a cat door for him and he could come and go as he pleased. I was half awake when I heard in the stairs a ""thunk, thunk, thunk."" My initial thought was ""I thought the cat was here with me."" At that very moment, at the same time that I looked towards the door to see the cat coming up the stairs, he sat up because he heard it too! I was home alone (my roommate and husband were both at work) so I took my cell phone, and the house phone, and investigated.  I checked all of the doors, each of which were locked,  and made sure some random animal didn't get in through the cat door.  There was nothing. 

The next incident in that house was when I had thrown my back out, I was only mid twenties, but that's irrelevant, and again, around noon,  I woke up and rolled over to look toward my bedroom door. I was watching my husband leave to make coffee, and I saw a small, ghostly, child figure pass by the doorway. Neither of these felt scary out malicious, just odd. The most interesting part is the fact the the landlord's father died in the house falling down a flight of stairs while intoxicated. 

So, you all can decide, was it exploding head syndrome, or some sort of spirit reaching out to someone who is receptive?

Side note - I used to see/feel paranormal things when I was a kid.  Also,  if Justin wants a message from his (great?) Aunt (I'm sorry I can't remember exact details right now!) perhaps he could talk to a close friend who can sense paranormal things about being a go between for that interaction. Not ouji board stuff, but him making a statement to reach out to someone else that might be comfortable with some sort of sign.  He might not have the ability to take the message,  especially if he wants it so much. Isn't Alejandra someone who senses stuff? I swear I can tell the difference between her and Lauren, but I just can't remember which of those beautiful ladies feels paranormalstuff! Perhaps she might be willing to be a catalyst for that.  It's also possible that maybe he's missed a very subtle sign already.

There used to be an SNL skit called ""Coffee Talk"" with Mike Myers, here is a youtube video.  

[Coffee Talk: Mother's Day - SNL ](https://youtu.be/58grYzCcfHI?si=4bs93DsbD6czfUrG)(four-and-a-half minutes, you won't regret watching)

Fun fact: I learned today that the above character is based on Mike Myer's real life mother-in-law, [Linda Richman.](https://www.jewishinsandiego.org/jewish-community-news/linda-richman-is-verklempt#:~:text=Consider%20this%3A%20The%20character%20of,Jordan%2C%20in%20a%20tragic%20accident) who knew! 

# How this skit relates to r/Polishbras 

Since I've changed the forum to ""restricted"" for both posts & comments, I don't want to take away anyone's ""happy place,"" as far as - hopefully you thought of this forum as a light topic, and a place where you could freely discuss your hobby. and hopefully learn something! (To be fair, this forum was only started b/c of weird interactions with the ABrathatFits mods, but that's another post! At the time, I did not understand that the ABraThatFits forum was run by a marketing corporation; that would've explained a lot of the weirdness!).  The more I talk about [the con](https://braforumcritical.blogspot.com/2024/11/the-con-tv-show-that-came-out-in-2020.html), the more I get cyberstalked. That's obviously the purpose of the cyberstalking, to get me to shut up!   
  
I take it as a compliment now though, I'm obviously on to something 😉 ""The struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man's heart."" \~ Camus (disclaimer: I got that from Harvard's Graham Blanks in his [post-race interview](https://youtu.be/dQzzZ-qKVHM?si=SCuDtaeks7qmREGg) over the weekend, LOL. I actually wasn't reading Camus). 

Initially, I just wanted to have this forum like this (in the ""restricted"" mode) for the month of December, but now I'm not sure how long I'm going to keep it like this. It could be 2-3 months, but really I just don't know. Another reason is: the month of December is already 1/3 gone, and I've made very little progress on my book. I'm a task-oriented gal: if I have to shut things down for a while in the discussion realm so I can reach my goal, that's what I'm going to do. 

So, I think that - if you like to discuss Polish bras, but you don't like to make posts on other bra forums. Maybe start your own Polish bras forum! It doesn't have to be a public group on reddit, it could be a private group (invite only), or restricted. There's really no limit, there could be 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 + Polish bra forums. Unlimited Polish bra enthusiasm. 

# In Other News...

Since you have time now (since the forum is ""restricted"" and you can't comment here in December, at least), maybe watch Vlogmas! I'll give you a topic, [Chelsea Callahan: Christmas in New York City. ](https://youtu.be/zyogWE570rs?si=J_Sj4K2RvWR3Z_W4) 🎄🎅🎁 You're welcome. 

[Great vlogmas video I watched on Youtube today. I'm not a shill for Chelsea Callahan, but I just thought I would recommend it.](https://preview.redd.it/pqtcrvcit56e1.png?width=1744&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d2273998ffad86d91178cc33cd4d92fcb660003)
