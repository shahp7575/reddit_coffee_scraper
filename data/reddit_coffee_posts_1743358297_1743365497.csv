1jnl894,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1jnl894/advice_on_friendship/,"Advice on ""friendship""","This is messy, kindness is appreciated.  

I am in my early 40s, currently going through a divorce after 21 years in a loveless, sexless marriage fraught with secret debt, infidelity, and emotional neglect on my STBXH's side.  Basically, I went for lunch with a male coworker, I realised the type of relationship I've always wanted could exist because of him, and within a week was walking away from my marriage.  I know that's wild.  It is not the first time I'd asked for a divorce so not out of the blue.  STBX had a 2 year affair that we are five years out from, and I tried.  Good lord I tried.  I mean, eight months ago I sobbed on a friend's couch that I was never going to be happy or feel cherished or have love, and I was going to settle for my kids.  I chose my ex over and over, and he also chose himself over and over, and then I just couldn't anymore and chose myself.  

Two weeks later, coworker, who is married, told me that he has feelings.  A week later, we both admitted these were strong feelings on both sides.  Two weeks after that, he dropped the L word.  

At that point I had a very long, hard conversation with him, telling him he was having an emotional affair, that he was planting a bomb in his marriage, that if he continued it would blow up his world.  He realised that what I was saying was true and told his wife (an arguably sanitized version of) the truth about his feelings.  

Coworker has expressed dissatisfaction in his marriage, but I do not generally discuss it with him.  He is like me, a sacrificer who has a partner who is a taker.  His bucket is not being reciprocally filled.  I believe the primary issues for him is his wife's lack of responsibility with money and a dead bedroom.  Having dealt with both of those things, I know from experience that they are absolutely devastating.  The fiscal irresponsibility was the first time I asked my STBX for a divorce when I found 55k in debt.  He has also said that he wants ""a real woman"" who is nurturing.  I am that person when I feel safe and with him, I feel extremely safe.  We are equals, I want to be fucking submissive to him, goddammit. The final issue (which I believe will be a deal breaker) is he wants a very specific retirement in a specific place and his wife does not.  I however do want to retire with that same specific plan, and could 100% give it as soon as our kids (same age) are grown up.

It has been another few months.  We are still friends, and spend every moment we can together at work.  Colleagues refer to me as his work wife, him as my work husband.  We work in an industry that is extremely tight knit, and so us spending a lot of time together is not strange, no one bats an eye, no rumours are circulating.  The rest of my unit knows that my STBX had a long term sexual affair and know that I would never ever ever have sex with a married human, period. 

But the conversations we are having are changing.  Before, it was a lot of ""Holy fuck, you are everything I want and also I would like to take your clothes off"".  Now it is ""you are perfect, this would be so easy, Jesus Christ we are compatible"".  This past week, he admitted that he has never felt so strongly about anybody, and that I am his ""easy button"".  We have plans for what we are doing if he ever leaves his wife (i.e. we are talking about those retirement plans).

I am seeking some advice.  I have offered to never speak to him again, to walk away.  I have told him that the only way to stop these feelings is to stop contact.  Moving units is impossible for both of us.  I'm about to become a single income household with a $300k mortgage and two kiddos (one in uni, one in junior high).  I cannot quit. 

But his response brought me both relief and guilt.  He cannot lose me.  He cannot walk away.  We will be ""friends forever"".  Relief because I cannot lose him.  I have three people I have felt this click with.  Two platonically, and him.  My soul recognised him.  If he asked me to never speak to him again, I would, but it would hurt a lot.  
Guilt because I know this is not going to help his marriage.  

My therapist has said this is fine.  I've set and am adhering to boundaries.  We do not touch.  We are never alone in a private place.  We do not see each other outside of work.  We do not text.  We do not talk on the phone.

However, we have been forced into what is essentially a courting relationship.  We are sharing our dreams, desires, sussing out exactly how good of a fit the other is.  I almost feel like this is more dangerous than a physical affair would be because the love and care we feel is deepening and becoming ever present.  He has said it is hard not to take care of me.  We have developed a way to care for each other without crossing physical boundaries.  I make him coffee.  He holds open doors.  

I guess I want to know, wtf do I do?  Should I feel guilty if he doesn't walk away?  Should I hold on to hope?  Should I just be myself and allow the chips to fall where they may?  

I am not polyamorous.  When I love someone, I do not love or look at anyone else.  I have given myself a calendar year to be single, relearn who I am, and develop a schedule for myself and the kids as a single woman with shared custody.  I want to learn to be alone and not lonely.  I also desperately want him to leave his wife so I can peel off his clothes and fuck him till he faints.  It is very complicated and like walking on the edge of a razor.  

So gents, I am seeking honesty.  If you were a man in this situation, what would you want me to do?",1,1743365105.0,AskMenAdvice,3,1.0,False

1jnl06b,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jnl06b,Some thoughts on the various forms of latte art. Do you agree?,"I’ve posted here before and after about three months of practice ,I’m starting to think more about what I’ve been doing intuitively so far. So first, I’ve come across many different practices of latte art, ranging from the classical free pour to pencil drawing to doing random stuff and Rorschach guessing etc. But of course the canonical form is the free pour and the swirls and the rosettas, more or less well done. Add swans and see horses and you got 99% of the free pours repertoire. And when I browse instagram accounts, also 99% of latte artists keep doing this. The good baristas do it super nicely and many amateurs open accounts to register their improvements or lack thereof. 
The result is that for those of us who spend time on coffee pages, watching another 50,000 rosettas/day can be a bit nauseating and definitely boring. I understand that people would want to make them and work on them to improve their technique and skills, also that they would post here on Reddit asking for tips because t I’m still wondering what’s the goal. Pouring perfect rosettas forever after? It seems to me that if we take the word ‘art’ in latte art a bit seriously, there should be something beyond technical progress. Right now I feel like thousands of people are copying the same three famous paintings ad nauseam with no further goal and that makes me puzzled. Wouldn’t you want to acquire your skills to later free yourself from the imposed technique and patterns and invent fun stuff? Of course I’m talking more about home baristas than pros who are gonna make dozens of drinks a day, although…
Anyhow, here are more designs that are just here to demonstrate that so many more latte pics are possible, and that are accessible to non very skilled people like me.

Or worse, paying a fortune for a streaming subscription that barely covers half the content you actually want? Yeah, me too. That’s why I cut the cord years ago and never looked back—thanks to **the best IPTV providers** out there.

If you’re tired of juggling multiple subscriptions just to watch your favorite shows, catch live sports, or binge on movies from around the world, IPTV is the game-changer you’ve been waiting for. **What if I told you there’s a way to access over 140,000+ live TV channels, 100,000+ movies, and premium sports—all in one place?** Sounds too good to be true? Well, it’s not.

Hi, I’m **nirjor**, and after testing dozens of IPTV services, I’ve narrowed down **the top 8 best IPTV providers of 2025**—so you don’t have to waste time (or money) on unreliable platforms. Whether you're a sports fanatic, a movie buff, or just want **the best IPTV subscription** for endless entertainment, this guide has you covered.

# Why IPTV in 2025?

Gone are the days of paying for overpriced cable packages with channels you’ll never watch. **IPTV (Internet Protocol Television)** lets you stream live TV, on-demand movies, and even PPV events directly to your phone, tablet, smart TV, or computer—anytime, anywhere.

But here’s the catch: *Not all IPTV providers are created equal.* Some offer **stunning 4K streams**, while others buffer endlessly. Some give you **24/7 customer support**, while others vanish after taking your payment. That’s why I’ve done the heavy lifting to bring you **only the best IPTV services** worth your time in 2025.

# A Sneak Peek at the Top Contenders

Before we dive into the full list, let me tease a few standouts:

🔥 **IPTVGREAT** – With **140,000+ live channels**, **100,000+ movies & TV shows**, and **crystal-clear HD/FHD streaming**, this is a powerhouse for global content. Plus, their **24/7 support** means you’re never left hanging. ([Check them out here!](https://iptvgreat.me))

⚡ **IPTVRESALE** – Boasting **40,000+ channels** and **100,000+ VOD titles**, plus a built-in **EPG guide** for easy browsing, this one’s perfect for those who love flexibility. ([Explore IPTVRESALE](https://iptvresale.com))

💎 **IPTVUnlock** – Sports fans, this one’s for you. With **40,000+ channels**, **150,000+ movies/TV shows**, and **all premium sports coverage**, it’s a dream for live events. ([Visit IPTVUnlock](https://iptvunlock.com))

🎬 **IPTVGang** – If you want **45,000+ live channels** and a **massive 200K+ VOD library**, these guys are the undisputed #1 for premium streaming. ([See why here](https://iptvgang.me))

By the end of this guide, you’ll know exactly which **best IPTV 2025** service matches your needs (and budget). Ready to ditch cable for good? Let’s get started!

# The 8 Best IPTV Solutions for 2025 [Top Rated Platforms]

Hey there! If you're like me, you've probably spent way too much time scrolling through lackluster TV options, wondering why you're still paying for cable when there are so many better (and cheaper!) streaming alternatives out there. Well, I’ve got good news—IPTV is here to save the day.

But let’s be real—not all IPTV services are created equal. Some are glitchy, some have sketchy customer support, and others just don’t have the channels you actually want. After testing a ton of them (and drinking way too much coffee in the process), I’ve narrowed down the **best IPTV providers for 2025**.

Whether you're a die-hard sports fan, a movie buff, or just someone who loves flipping through international channels, I’ve got you covered. Let’s dive in!

# What Makes a Great IPTV Provider?

Before we get into the list, let’s talk about what separates the best IPTV services from the mediocre ones. After all, you don’t want to waste time (or money) on a service that buffers every five minutes, right?

**Here’s what I look for in a top-tier IPTV provider:**

✔ **Massive Channel Selection** – Nobody wants a service with just 500 channels anymore. We’re talking **tens of thousands**—sports, news, entertainment, international, you name it.

✔ **On-Demand Content** – Because sometimes you just want to binge-watch a show without waiting for reruns.

✔ **High-Quality Streaming** – Buffering is the enemy. A good IPTV provider should offer **HD, FHD, and even 4K** streams with minimal lag.

✔ **Multi-Device Support** – Watching on your phone while commuting? Smart TV in the living room? Laptop in bed? A great IPTV service should work **seamlessly across all devices**.

✔ **Reliable Customer Support** – If something goes wrong (and let’s face it, tech *always* finds a way to glitch), you don’t want to be stuck waiting days for a response.

✔ **Affordable Pricing** – Why pay $100+ for cable when you can get **way more content for a fraction of the price**?

Now that we’ve got the criteria down, let’s check out the **top 8 IPTV services** that meet (and exceed) these standards in 2025.

# 1. IPTVGREAT – The Ultimate Global IPTV Experience 🌎

If you’re looking for **unmatched variety**, *IPTVGREAT* is hands-down one of the **best IPTV providers** out there. Seriously, I was blown away by how many channels they offer—**140,000+**! That’s not a typo. Whether you're into Bollywood dramas, European football, or Hollywood blockbusters, they’ve got something for everyone.

# Why IPTVGREAT Stands Out:

✅ **140,000+ Live Channels** – From local broadcasts to international networks.  
✅ **100,000+ Movies & TV Shows (VOD)** – Perfect for binge-watching.  
✅ **Premium Sports Coverage** – Every major league, World Cup, and PPV events. ⚽🏀  
✅ **HD/FHD Streaming** – No more pixelated screens.  
✅ **Works on All Devices** – Phone, tablet, Smart TV—you name it. 📱📺  
✅ **24/7 Customer Support** – Help is always available when you need it.

I’ve been using *IPTVGREAT* for months, and the **buffering is close to nonexistent**—even during peak hours. Plus, their **EPG (Electronic Program Guide)** makes channel surfing a breeze.

# 2. IPTVRESALE – The King of Flexibility & Reliability 🔥

If *IPTVGREAT* is the buffet of IPTV, then *IPTVRESALE* is the **five-star à la carte menu**. They don’t just throw channels at you—they **curate** them. With **40,000+ live channels** and **100,000+ movies and shows**, you’ll never run out of things to watch.

# Why IPTVRESALE Rocks:

✅ **40,000+ Live Channels** – A perfectly balanced selection.  
✅ **Huge VOD Library** – Latest movies, classic films, top TV series. 🎬  
✅ **HD, SD, and FHD Options** – Adjust based on your internet speed.  
✅ **EPG (TV Guide Included)** – Never miss your favorite show.  
✅ **Works on Any Device** – Android, iOS, Firestick, Smart TVs. 📲💻  
✅ **24/7 Support** – Quick fixes when you need ’em.

I love that they don’t overwhelm you with filler channels—everything feels **handpicked for quality**. And their **multi-device support** means I can switch from my TV to my phone without missing a beat.

# 3. IPTVUnlock – The Premium Choice for Sports & Movies 🏆

Calling all **sports fans & movie lovers**—this one’s for you. *IPTVUnlock* packs **40,000+ channels**, **150,000+ VOD titles**, and **all the premium sports coverage** you could ask for.

# Why IPTVUnlock is a Game-Changer:

✅ **All Major Sports Leagues** – NFL, NBA, FIFA, UFC, and more. 🏈  
✅ **150,000+ Movies & Series** – Bigger than most streaming platforms.  
✅ **Crystal-Clear HD Streams** – No more blurry soccer matches.  
✅ **24/7 Customer Support** – No waiting around for help.

I tested this during the last Super Bowl, and **zero lag**—just pure, uninterrupted football glory. Plus, their **Android & iOS apps** are super smooth.

# 4. IPTVGang – The Undisputed #1 IPTV of 2025 👑

If you want **the absolute best**, look no further than *IPTVGang*. With **45,000+ live channels** and **200,000+ VOD options**, this is the **Netflix-killer** of IPTV.

# Why IPTVGang Dominates:

✅ **45,000+ Live TV Channels** – Largest selection I’ve seen.  
✅ **200K+ Movies & Shows** – More content than you’ll ever watch.  
✅ **Zero Buffering** – Flawless streaming, even in 4K.  
✅ **Multi-Device Friendly** – Works on **all platforms**.

# Conclusion

**Wrapping Up: Your Perfect IPTV Adventure Awaits!**

Well, friend, we’ve covered a *lot* of ground here—from the jaw-dropping 140,000+ channels on **IPTVGREAT** to the sleek, on-demand libraries of **IPTVUnlock** and the sports-packed magic of **IPTVGang**. It’s wild how far streaming has come, isn’t it? I remember the days of flipping through cable channels, frustrated by limited options. Now, with the **best IPTV providers** of 2025, the world’s entertainment is literally at your fingertips.

So, what’s the takeaway?

**First**, there’s no one-size-fits-all **IPTV subscription**—it’s all about what *you* love. Are you a sports fanatic? **IPTVGear**’s got your back. Craving international content? **IPTVGreat**’s global lineup is a dream. Want premium VOD? **IPTVUnlock** and **IPTVResale** are loaded. The beauty? You can test-drive most of these (I always recommend starting with a trial—no regrets!).

**Second**, quality matters. Buffering is *so* 2010. The **best IPTV 2025** services, like the ones we’ve chatted about, offer HD streams, rock-solid reliability, and support that actually helps when you need it. No more screaming at your screen because the game froze!

**Lastly**, think beyond the screen. The right **IPTV provider** isn’t just about channels—it’s about freedom. Ditching cable felt like unshackling myself from a $200/month habit. Now? I watch what I want, when I want, on *any* device. (Pro tip: **IPTVGang** and **IPTVGreat** work flawlessly on phones for those commute binges.)

So, what’s next? Dive in! Pick a service that sparks joy (yes, Marie Kondo your streaming life). Try **IPTVResale** for its insane VOD library or **IPTVGear** for live TV that never quits. The links are right here for you:

# Frequently Asked Questions

Got questions about the **best IPTV providers** in 2025? I’ve got answers! Below, I tackle the most common queries to help you make the best choice for your streaming needs.

# 1. What makes IPTV better than traditional cable or streaming services?

Great question! **IPTV (Internet Protocol Television)** gives you **more flexibility, affordability, and content variety** than cable or mainstream streaming platforms. Unlike cable, which locks you into expensive, bloated packages, IPTV lets you customize your channel lineup. Plus, with **140,000+ live channels** and **100,000+ on-demand shows/movies** (like what IPTVGREAT offers), you get **way more content** than Netflix or Hulu—all in one place.

# 2. Is IPTV legal? How do I avoid shady providers?

This is super important. **IPTV itself is a legal technology**, but not all providers operate legally. Some offer pirated content, which can get you in trouble. To stay safe:

* Stick to **reputable providers** (like the ones I’ve reviewed).
* Look for **transparent pricing**, **customer reviews**, and **24/7 support** (IPTVGREAT, for example, offers this).
* Avoid services that promise **""lifetime subscriptions""**—they’re almost always scams.

# 3. What’s the best IPTV provider for sports in 2025?

If you’re a sports fan, prioritize providers with **reliable live sports coverage**, minimal buffering, and PPV events. **IPTVGREAT** is a top pick here—they offer **all premium sports channels**, including NFL, NBA, FIFA, and UFC PPVs. Other great options in my list also focus on **low-latency streaming**, so you never miss a goal or touchdown.

# 4. Can I use IPTV on multiple devices?

Absolutely! Most **top IPTV providers** in 2025 support **multiple simultaneous connections**. For example, IPTVGREAT lets you stream on **smartphones, tablets, smart TVs, and Firesticks** at the same time. Just check the provider’s policy—some limit the number of screens unless you upgrade.

# 5. Do I need a VPN for IPTV?

It depends. If your provider is **fully licensed**, a VPN isn’t *necessary*—but it’s still a good idea for **privacy and bypassing geo-blocks**. For less reputable services, a VPN (like NordVPN or ExpressVPN) can **hide your activity** from ISPs. I recommend using one if you’re unsure about your provider’s legality.

# 6. What’s the best IPTV for 4K streaming?

Not all providers offer **true 4K**, but the best ones (like IPTVGREAT) have **HD, FHD, and 4K options** for select channels and VOD. Look for terms like **""UHD streams""** or **""4K on-demand""** in the features list.

# 7. Why does my IPTV buffer so much?

Buffering is usually caused by:

* **Weak internet** (aim for at least 25 Mbps for HD).
* **Server issues** (cheap providers overload their servers).
* **No CDN** (top providers use Content Delivery Networks for smoother streams).

If buffering annoys you, switch to a **high-rated IPTV service** with stable servers (hint: my top 2025 picks have this covered).

# 8. Can I get a free trial before committing?

Yes! Many legit providers (including some in my list) offer **24- to 72-hour trials** for a small fee (or even free). It’s the best way to **test channel quality, EPG accuracy, and support** before buying.

# 9. What happens if my IPTV service gets shut down?

It’s rare for **licensed providers** to shut down, but if yours does:

* Check if they offer **refunds or migrations** to another service.
* Move to a **more reliable provider** (like the ones I’ve vetted). Pro tip: **Avoid paying annually** until you’re sure the service is stable.

# 10. How do I set up IPTV on my Firestick/Smart TV?

Most providers make it easy:

1. **Download their app** (or a player like Smarters IPTV).
2. **Enter your login details** or load an M3U playlist.
3. **Start streaming!** Some even offer **step-by-step setup guides**—IPTVGREAT includes this with subscriptions.

Still have questions? Drop a comment below, and I’ll help you out! Remember, **the best IPTV subscription** for you depends on your needs—whether it’s **sports, 4K movies, or global channels**, my 2025 roundup has options for everyone. Happy streaming! 🚀

1jnkubu,https://i.redd.it/vuyqxtgurvre1.png,THE BELLS ON CHRISTMAS EVE By CosplayCryptidQueenOnHalloween13,"We moved in right after Thanksgiving. It was right after my recently divorced Mom finally got her job promotion at work. It had been a long time coming but finally it was here. I was so deeply proud of her! It’s not easy for a single mom out there to make it in the corporate world but she was killing it – and just in time for Black Friday too! But it always comes with a cost. We moved out before the end of the school year. One minute I’m on winter break and the next we’re moving out to the suburbs for what Mom likes to call: “The better life.”

I hated her for it at first but I totally understood why too. It’s just that life is not always fair and I had to say goodbye to all my friends. What a way to leave 8^(th) Grade. Next year I would be a freshman and I would have to start all over again with trying to fit in. But it’s whatever. I’m proud of my Mom and I know she only wants what’s best for me even if she can be so annoying sometimes. But what can you do?

We moved into a cookie-cutter little cul-de-sac during a snow storm. Mom wanted to wait but she had already paid for the movers so we had to make it work. Every house looked exactly the same. And all of them already had their Christmas decorations up on the front lawns. I sincerely hoped this neighborhood was Halloween-friendly because with Thanksgiving only just ending they were already pushing Christmas Trees and lights and Santa Claus shit on us. I think we all know that means the ladies of the Home Owners Association probably are uber-Christians and hate anything scary or Halloween. But what can you do? Everything fun scares Christians.

And I don’t want you to think I don’t like Christmas or whatever because I do. Christmas is great but we’re not like super religious – just spiritual. And Charles Dicken’s novel, *A Christmas Carol*, is one of my all-time-absolute favorite books!

Our first night was super weird. After the movers put all of our old trunks and heavy stuff into the garage, Mom and I brought in all the cardboard boxes and smaller furniture. Then we lost power and had to sit in the dark. It was cold so Mom made a fire and we huddled together on the couch with heavy blankets. Mom fell asleep right away but I kept waking up. The whole house was way too quiet – all I could hear was the winds howling all night. I remember thinking how there was zero traffic outside so the wind sounded like a thunderstorm only different. I hope that makes sense. I sat up and stared into the glowing orange embers of the fireplace. I can remember thinking about how strange all the cardboard boxes looked. It felt like the room was smaller because we were surrounded by them. And that’s when it happened.

I heard it in the dark: the quiet ring of a bell. At first I wasn’t sure I heard it because of the wind but then I heard it again. A little soft twinkling sound like a sleigh bell or whatever you call the little bells you hear around Christmas time. It sounded like it was coming from somewhere inside the house but definitely not in our new living room. I tried to wake Mom up to ask her if she had heard it too.

“Mom…hey, Mom – you hear that?”                                                                                                              “Not now…sleeping,” Mom moaned as she rolled over on the couch.

JINGLE.

I heard it again and I shot straight up. I waited in the dark all night but nothing else happened. I remember dozing off around dawn and thinking: it was nothing…I was so wrong.

Nothing much happened after that night for a while. The power came back on the next day and things started to feel normal. We unpacked our stuff and ate take out. Mom left a few things in the garage but otherwise we were pretty much moved in. Skip ahead a few weeks and now it was actually Christmas time. I was putting up decorations around the new house when Mom called out to me from the other room.

“Wanna go tree shopping tonight?” Mom asked.                                                                                        “Sure – why not,” I turned and replied.

We got in the car and headed into town.

   We got out of the car at the closed down strip mall parking lot and started looking at all the different pine trees. We hadn’t been tree shopping for years. Dad was all about saving money and he bought us a fake tree years ago. But that was all over now. Now we are going back to the old tradition of a real tree. It felt like a return to something we had been missing. Like carving real pumpkins on Halloween only this was on Christmas.

“How ‘bout this one?” Mom asked.                                                                                                         “Maybe. Anyway we can go bigger this year?” I said back.                                                                         “Sure, why not.”

Mom was always making me feel like I was part of the decision making process. I know it was only on small stuff here and there but it really does matter to me. Dad never listened. He’d make decisions and ignore everyone else. I know Mom had had enough of it. And I appreciated being involved – or at least listened to.

We lashed the tree on top of Mom’s car and drove home. The tree just barely fit under our living room ceiling but we made it work.

“No angel this year – no room,” Mom said.                                                                                                 “That’s ok – more room for colored lights,” I said with a smile.

Mom opened a box and started to untangle the wired Christmas lights.

“Can you get me the ladder from the garage?” Mom asked.                                                                         “Sure,” I said.

I opened the door to the garage and the smell hit me. I quickly put my hand over my nose.

*‘The trash is rotting,’* I thought.

I walked over to the giant garbage cans and picked the lid off the cold concrete floor. I frowned and looked over at the slimy white trash bags in the container.

*‘We gotta start recycling more,’* I thought.

I put the lid on the garbage cans and grabbed the ladder.

I came back inside and set the ladder up next to the tree.

JINGLE.

My eyes opened wide and I realized that sound of the twinkling bell was back – only closer this time. I turned around immediately.

“There they are,” Mom said.                                                                                                            

Mom reached down and picked something up off the floor.

“I was wondering where these had gotten off to…” Mom continued.

In her hands were four brass sleigh bells sewn onto and old red velvet bow with gold tassels and trim. The little rustic decorations half-chimed in her hands as she walked toward me.

“I don’t recognize those,” I said with a confused look still across my face.                                                        “I thought I lost them in the move,” Mom said.                                                                                          “Why?” I asked.                                                                                                                                                 “Don’t remember packing them,” Mom said with a shrug.

JINGLE. JINGLE.

The sleigh bells made little chiming noises as Mom shuffled them around. Mom grabbed a nail and a hammer and stuck the little bells to the wall above the fireplace.

JINGLE. JINGLE. JINGLE.

“They were you’re great-grandmother’s…from Germany,” Mom spoke between hammering.                    “There. I think they look nice next to your stockings. Don’t you think?” Mom turned back to me.

I nodded and we got back to decorating the tree. I tried to focus but I couldn’t help myself. Every so often, I would catch myself sneaking a peek back at the little bells over the mantle.

*‘I know I’ve never seen them before,’* I thought to myself.

“C’mon. We got a lot of tree to cover,” Mom said.

I nodded again and smiled. But stole one last glance back at the sleigh bells.

*‘I think those are the bells I heard the night we first moved in,’* I thought, *‘But how? They were packed up in storage ‘til tonight?’*

I woke up later that night in secret. I wanted to wrap my Mom’s Christmas present and set it under the tree before the next day. I made sure my bedroom door was closed and then I crept into my closet. I lay the green and red wrapping paper down on the rug and took out the little black jewelry box from under my bed. I opened it to look at it one last time before wrapping. A whole year of saving up chore and birthday money and I managed to get my Mom a nice silver pendent necklace. It was beautiful with tiny chain links and a mother-of-pearl moon charm. Embedded in the mother-of-pearl moon was a black and blue butterfly. The blue of the wings were iridescent, just like a real butterfly’s wings. When I saw it at the mall I just knew I had to get it for her.  

I unrolled the wrapping paper and set the jewelry box on top. I took out my scissors and started to make the cut. I always enjoyed wrapping presents. I know it seems silly but I really do. There’s something satisfying about it, like it really, makes the gift yours. Dad always used to laugh at it. He said it was a ridiculous waste of money just to buy wrapping paper only to rip it up and throw it away. He just didn’t get it. It was the thought that counts!

JINGLE.

The hairs on the back of my neck stood up and I glared over at my bedroom door. It was wide open. I stood and looked at the empty dark hallway. The glow of the Christmas tree lights flickered from the next room. I took a step closer. I stood silently in the doorway. My breath was caught in my throat.

JINGLE.

I gasped and jumped back.

*‘How is that possible?’* I thought to myself.

I moved forward again.

*‘Maybe the wind? Maybe a draft or something?’* I leaned forward. I waited for what felt like forever. Nothing happened. So I took a step into the hallway. Then another. And another.

*‘I’ll just check the mantle over the fireplace,’* I thought, *‘If nothing else happens then I’ll know.’*

I crept into the living room. I passed by the glowing Christmas tree lights. Then my eyes fell upon the fireplace. Standing there with her back to me was Mom. She was looking up at the sleigh bells over the mantel.

“Mom?” I managed to whisper.

Nothing. Mom didn’t move. I gulped and tried again.

“Mom?” my voice croaked out.

Mom turned and my mouth dropped open.

Blood poured down my Mother’s face. Her eyes were ripped out and her mouth was slack like a dead body. She opened her arms as if to embrace me with bloody hands.

JINGLE.

The sound of the sleigh bell rang out and my own Mother charged at me like a wild animal. An unearthly screech seemed to force its way out of her mouth as she ran at me.  I turned and ran away. I could barely believe what was happening! I sprinted down the hallway. I could hear her crashing into the walls as she chased after me. It was almost as if she was possessed by something. Like she was not in complete control of her own body.

“MOM! STOP!” I screamed back at her.

I leapt into my room and slammed the door.

Then suddenly, I shot up in bed. I was wide awake and breathing heavy. My sheets and PJs were soaked in sweat. I looked around. Daylight was spilling in through the window. Then I heard it – my bedroom door was opening. I turned.

“Knock, knock, lazy bones…” Mom said as she opened my bedroom door.

I looked up at her unable to speak. Her eyes were back. She looked completely normal.

“I’m sorry, Honey I should’ve knocked for real,” Mom said, “I was just trying to be silly or something…Look, coffee’s ready if you wanna get up with me.”

She sipped from her mug as she set another cup on my desk for me. She raised her eyebrows and left. I just stared as she walked away. I couldn’t believe it.

*‘Just a dream. Another stupid nightmare,’* I thought, *‘I’m such an idiot.”*

I sighed and laid back down. I closed my eyes to calm myself.

JINGLE.

My eyes shot open and I jumped out of bed.

JINGLE.

I looked down and there at my feet were the sleigh bells.

“What did you do?” an angry voice hissed at me.

I looked up.

Mom was standing there again in my bedroom doorway. She was breathing heavily and glaring down at me. I had never seen her so upset.

“Why did you take it?” she seethed at me.                                                                                                          “Take what? I…”

Mom rushed toward me.

“DON’T YOU LIE TO ME – THEY’RE RIGHT THERE ON THE FLOOR!” Mom yelled.

She reached down and snatched the sleigh bell decorations off the rug. She glared at me and stepped back.

“You touch my things one more time and I’ll take everything away from you! You hear me!” my Mom said quickly, “All of this! Gone! Are you listening! You understand!”

I just looked up at her. I started to shake my head in confusion but stopped myself at the last second. The last thing I wanted was for her to think I was disagreeing with her.  

“I’m sorry, Mom,” I said instinctually.

Mom slammed my bedroom door closed.

I stood there for a long time. Not sure what to do next.

Days went by and my Mom and I never spoke to each other. When the snow came, we shoveled the next morning in silence. When we ate dinner, she never even looked at me. I never knew those stupid sleigh bells meant so much to her. And I never touched them.

*‘I would never steal from you, Mom,’* I thought.

But I never said it. I couldn’t bring myself to say anything around her then. I was too afraid. I had heard my Mom and Dad argue before the divorce. Dad was mean. But Mom could be so much meaner. She could always find the ugliest things to say in an argument when she was angry. Stuff that she maybe didn’t really mean to say but they still hurt. I think they hurt the most because they were always sort of, kind of true but also not true. I don’t really know. I hope that kind of makes sense. But either way I just wanted her to be nice to me. I wanted her to trust me again. And I especially didn’t want to ruin our Christmas.

It was Christmas Eve and I had gone to bed early. Old habits die hard I guess. I was lying in my bed and just starting to doze off when I realized that I hadn’t put Mom’s present under the Christmas tree. I got out of bed and pulled on my black and pink hoodie. I took the wrapped gift from my closet and quietly opened my bedroom door. The hallway was dark. Only the glow of the Christmas tree allowed me to see where I was going.

I tip-toed into the living room and set the wrapped present under the Christmas tree with all the other gifts. Mom had really out done herself this year. Despite all the silent treatment she had made sure I would have a good Christmas.

*‘She really does love me,’* I thought to myself.

I turned.

“What’re you doing outta bed?” Mom hissed.

My eyes shot over to her. She seemed to appear out of the hallway.

“Mom? I…” but Mom cut me off before I could finish.                                                                                                                                                         “Where is it?” Mom barked at me.                                                                                                                   “What?” I asked.                                                                                                                                           

Mom rushed over to me and yanked me to my feet by my forearm.

“Where are my sleigh bells?” Mom said through gritted teeth.                                                                      “Mom, stop – you’re hurting me!” I begged.                                                                                                 “WHERE ARE THEY?!” Mom screamed.

She pulled me over to the fireplace and shoved me forward. I looked up. The mantel was empty.

“I…Mom, I don’t…” I shook my head and turned back to face her as I pleaded.                                                “I told you not to touch my things. Were you listening?” Mom sneered, “You think I was kidding? You think you can push me around, too? Is that it?”                                                                                                 “Mom. Honest, I didn’t” I held back the tears as I spoke.                                                                                   “I will not put up with stealing. You hear me!” Mom said as she grabbed my shoulders.

JINGLE.

We both stopped. We looked down. Mom reached into my hoodie pocket.

JINGLE. JINGLE.

Mom held the sleigh bell decorations in her hand. She glared at me and held them up in my face.

“I knew it. You’re lying to me,” Mom hissed again.

I backed up.

“Mom, I swear I…” I began to whimper.                                                                                                    “DON’T LIE TO ME!” Mom screamed as she threw the sleigh bells in my face.

JINGLE. JINGLE.

I flinched and stepped back fumbling the decorations. I found my footing and looked at the little bells in my hands. Then I looked back at my Mother.

“Put them back,” Mom demanded coldly.

I was frozen. I didn’t know what to do next.

“I SAID PUT THEM BACK!” Mom yelled and lunged forward at me.

I don’t know why but I instinctually ran away. I don’t know what I was thinking. I just had to get away. I ran towards the kitchen not sure what to do next.

“GET BACK HERE!” Mom yelled, “RIGHT NOW!”

I didn’t know what to do. All I could think to do was get away. Get away or hide. I opened the garage door. As soon as the cold air hit me I had an idea hit me too.

*‘You want ‘em so bad – find ‘em yourself!”* I thought selfishly.

I rushed into the garage. The freezing concrete almost burning the soles of my bare feet. But I didn’t care. Not then. At that moment, I had had enough. I didn’t care what happened to me. I wanted to get rid of these stupid sleigh bells.

I looked at the garbage cans and then down at the dumb decoration in my hand.

*‘No,’* I thought, *‘She’ll look there first.’*

I turned to the big trunk on the floor. I ran over to it. I unclipped the metal clasps. I lifted the lid.

JINGLE.

I dropped the decorations on the floor and stood up with wide eyes. I couldn’t breathe.

“WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE!” my Mother yelled as she entered the garage.

I didn’t look at her. I just stared at the open trunk. Lying in a gory pool of blood and maggots was the dead body of my Father.

Mom grabbed me and pulled me away. She knelt down and held my face to face her. She spoke so fast I only understood parts of it.

“NO, BABY! DON’T LOOK! I’M SORRY! I HAD TO! YOU DON’T UNDERSTAND! I HAD TO DO IT! I HAD TO KILL HIM! FOR US! YOU CAN’T TELL ANYONE! NOT EVER!” Mom ranted at me but I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t really hear all of it.

JINGLE. JINGLE.

Mom stopped. We both turned. The bloody body of my Father stood behind us. His head was down so we couldn’t see his face. In his fist was the sleigh bells.

JINGLE.

Dad’s dead body took a step forward.

Mom gasped and stood in front of me.

JINGLE.

I peered around Mom. Dad got closer.

JINGLE.

Closer.

JINGLE.

Closer.

Dad was standing right in front of Mom.

“You’re…you’re alive?” Mom whispered, “But how…it’s impossible…”

JINGLE.

Suddenly, Dad’s head snapped upwards. He seemed to stare blankly at Mom with unblinking eyes and a slack jaw.

“Daddy?” I breathed.

Dad’s mouth stretched open and a black, slime covered arm with clawed fingers reached out and grabbed Mom by the throat. Mom grabbed the black forearm and struggled to pull free. She choked out sounds but the screams would not come. Dad’s other arms grabbed hold of Mom’s shoulders and he took a step back. She thrashed and choked and tried to pull away as Dad, and the slimy thing inside of Dad, dragged her backwards toward the big trunk. Dad stepped inside the trunk. And the slimy, black hand held Mom up off the ground.

SLAM!

In an instant, Dad and Mom both collapsed into the trunk and the lid came down hard. It almost looked like a great wind blew them both into the old wooden box. 

My feet were warm then. As embarrassing as it is now to admit, that was the exact moment I realized that I had urinated on myself. I caught my breath and began to tremble. I don’t know if it was the cold or the shock.

*‘Do something,’* I thought, *‘Don’t just stand here – do something!’*

I gathered my courage and rushed back over to the big trunk. I crouched down and flung open the trunk lid. I looked inside.

Nothing.

My Parents were gone – vanished. Not a trace of them was left. No blood or maggots. Nothing. Only the sleigh bell decoration lay on the empty bottom of the trunk.

JINGLE.

I picked the old decoration up and stared down at it for a long time.

*‘This has got to be another dream,’* I thought, *‘Just another stupid nightmare and any minute now I’m going to wake up.’*

Tears filled my eyes.

*‘Any minute now, I’m going to wake up and Mom and Dad will still be alive, right?’* I could feel the panic rising in me, *‘They’ll be alive and Mom and me can have our Christmas together, right? Please?’*

I started to cry. I knew it was all over now. Mom and Dad were gone. And that thing that was somehow inside of Dad – it was real. And the bells. The nightmares. I knew they would never go away. Not now. Not ever. And I knew it would never make sense. And I’m still sorry.

I saw them first, glancing over my shoulder as I peed on the side of the pool office shack. I snapped my head back down, finished up, and walked as smoothly as I could back to the others. “Hey,” I interrupted quietly. “The cops are over there. We should probably get out of here.”

I was a little late. Sam had already climbed over the fence into the pool area to try to jimmy the soda machine into giving him a free soda, a trick that had worked once in the past. Another hyena had started walking towards the same spot I had peed at, saw the cruiser hiding under the oak tree branches, and uttered a low “shit”. We urgently signaled to Sam who climbed back over, then we piled into the truck to light the hell out of there. But no sooner had the engine roared to life than the police cruiser came to a screeching halt in our path, lights flashing. The hyenas now looked like a pack of scared rabbits.

Before we knew it, it was like an episode of Cops. The officers rounded up the group of juvenile delinquents, pressed them spread-eagle against the fence and searched them, making pointed threats about overnight jail stays and midnight calls to parents. Because we were obviously the ones responsible for tossing garbage cans into the pool, and the town deserved its justice.

Apparently some convenient witness had been driving down that very same dark, dead-end street and had seen a group of teenagers just like us vandalizing everything. And this had apparently happened only an hour earlier — while we were in a theater watching a crappy movie 15 miles away. Karma, it turns out, wears a badge.

Being the only 18-year-old in the bunch by a couple of months, I immediately became the party responsible for all of these derelicts. Into the back of the cruiser I went, while the officer climbed into the front and two more cruisers showed up. It must have been a slow night.

Officer Coffee Breath proceeded to tell me point blank that he already knew I was the one who threw the garbage cans into the pool, and that my friends had already told him as much. Glancing over at my friends, still pressed up against the fence and not yet talking to anybody, I let him know about our movie experience - or at least the cleaned up, police-approved version. Moving his face closer to the cage divider, he let me know that I was lying, and that one of the perps had been witnessed wearing a black sweatshirt jacket, which could easily be mistaken for my light gray sweatshirt jacket. “I never lie,” I said dumbly, immediately realizing this was itself a lie. The officer excused himself to speak with his colleagues, leaving me in the back of the squad car imagining how I was going to explain to my mom that we were arrested for being similar to other, worse teenagers.

They talked to each of us individually, and many tense minutes later, they let us go. They had nothing, and besides, some kid named Frank was getting into a fight somewhere. But they did leave us with some memorable moments: An officer explained to my brother that I had personally accepted responsibility for everything on behalf of everyone. Another officer asked Sam, “does your daddy beat you, boy?” (He didn’t.)

From this incident I learned two things about the police: 1) Just shut up about everything you know. You don't know anything. 2) Even if they don’t know what mischief you’ve been up to, being a teenager out late is sometimes all they need to hold you for an hour and a half and make you crap your skivvies. But we probably deserved it.

*Epilogue*

Some months later, Sam and I were touring the county jail with our tae kwon do class, courtesy of an instructor who doubled as a jail guard. Along the way we dropped by an administrative office to be introduced to some officers. One of them glared at Sam and demonstrated an impressive memory for faces.

""You're the one with the garbage cans in the pool, right?""

Out of all the unscrupulous crap we'd done that night or on any other occasion (there really wasn’t much else), the one crime that made it into a police log book was one we hadn't even committed. At least Sam handled it with the cool wit of a seasoned criminal. He grinned back at the officer.

""Allegedly.""

1jnkt88,https://i.redd.it/06o3v6zcsvre1.jpeg,Looking for Real Guayusa Tea – Not Yerba Mate (No Tannins or Acidity),"Hey everyone! I’m trying to find the real deal Guayusa tea, not yerba mate and not any blends that sneak in other herbs. My stomach can’t handle black or green tea or coffee anymore due to acidity and tannins, so I’m looking for something smooth, low-acid, and non-astringent with a gentle caffeine boost. Guayusa seems like the perfect fit.

I’ve already looked into sites like “Amazon Treasure” but they just redirect to Amazon and have no ingredient lists, which feels sketchy. I also found Waykana (which looks promising) and Runa, but I’ve heard Runa might be out of business?

So… does anyone know a reputable brand or seller for pure guayusa with a clear ingredient list (no blends, no additives, just guayusa)? I’d prefer USDA Organic or at least a company with good sourcing practices.

Would love any help! My gut thanks you in advance. 😊",1,1743364039.0,herbalism,0,1.0,False

Let me know if I missed anything fun! 

* When asked about her demeanor seeming more subdued, Haewon responded: “I read somewhere that people don’t mature as they age. They just grow more tired and run out of energy. I really resonated with that.”
* After the *Pinggyego* episode aired, many people around her expressed concern about how much coffee she drinks. She clarified that she doesn't normally consume as much as she described during the show. Her usual intake is around 10 packets a day. (That's still too much Haewon...) Even Sieun from STAYC told her to ease up during their overlapping comeback schedules.
* She says the Workdol team is who she misses the most. They treated her so well, and she genuinely looked forward to every filming.
* Her parents almost named her Haedan or Haeyul before deciding on Haewon.
* She tries to watch all the fantube videos whenever she can and really appreciates them. She really enjoys videos made with love and sincerity and because all fantube videos are created out of NSWERs’ love for NMIXX, she finds them especially meaningful.
* Whenever she listens to *Papillon*, she imagines herself as the righteous villain in the final scene of a movie, driving through a neon-lit, cyberpunk-style dystopian street.
* Haewon’s skincare routine: She wipes her face with toner three times, then washes her face, applies a vitamin ampoule, and finishes with tea tree cream to calm her skin after long hours of wearing makeup.
* She always feels disappointed in herself after singing-related appearances. She said she sang *River* much better during the camera rehearsal for The Seasons. 
* Her favorite Spanish word is ""cacahuète"" (peanut). She finds it cute and says she loves words that sound adorable.
* The hand scar from her fall back in December is still very visible. She advises NSWERs to not be like her and take good care of the wound the moment they get hurt. 
* She likes latte, but doesn’t drink it often because she’s slightly lactose intolerant.
* She’s currently into chewing gum these days.
* She currently likes her red wine hair color and has no intention of dying her hair to something else.
* She doesn't understand the hype behind the blue screen background idols use during livestreams. Her face just looks blue.

While it’s definitely an improvement, something still feels off, and I can’t quite put my finger on it.

All the decorations on flat surfaces are just placeholders to be given away but are just there to fill space for now except for the coffee instrument lamp (a greca). My mother-in-law gave me the Tom Ford book, which will be thrown in the trash once I figure out what type of decoration should go on that surface.

The table is actually quite old—it came with the apartment. We got the chairs from Amazon. If a new table would improve the space, I’m open to replacing it, as well as getting a new coffee table if needed.

I’ll be doing a business trip to Shanghai with a colleague in July.

We decided to bring bring our wives and kids (2, 4, 4).

While my colleague and I will be busy for some days, we want our families to hang out, walk the area, relax in coffee houses, on play grounds, kids play centers with a good offering around a not decided hotel. The hotel ideally also has a kids club, pool or or play ground next to it.

We dont need fancy and luxury, and prefer honest places and original food as we have lived in Japan, Singapore and Thailand.

1 - What would be a good area and place to stay in Shanghai (with kids days can quickly get stressful, return to the hotel for sleep, clean up). French Concession?

2 - Probably the area is somewhere where one half of the parents can explore also some interesting places during the day (with kids) but also at night time in walking proximity of 30 minutes (go out for food and just nice exploration, for example when the wifes head out and we take care of the kids while sleeping).

3 - After the city we want to head for 7—10 days out in a more rural area and take a nice accomodation (is there similar places like Ryokans in Japan) around traditional/historical places to visit. Could be two hours around by train or similar.

Add in some l-glutamine and/or digestive enzymes.  You can also drink coffee as long as its mold free coffee.  Do not take any antifungals.

Diet needs to be fairly clean but doesn't have to be perfect.  Those carbs will be processed by your newly healed gut.

The downside to this protocol is the caffeine from the kombucha which can give you a lot of energy and keep you up.

1jnkhw2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1jnkhw2/aita_for_blowing_up_at_my_family_member_over_old/,AITA for blowing up at my family member over old drama.,"Hi Charlotte! I'm a long-time fan, and I'd have to say that your videos give me much joy and laughter. But today I humbly come to you for judgment because if I'm the asshole for bringing up an old drama, blowing up on my family member, and essentially cutting them off over some unresolved hurt that was caused on their part. Sorry if this is super long, and I will try to provide context. I will accept my admonishment

Recently, I went to dinner with a mutual friend of mine and a family member we will call her Paris. Back in the day, Paris was a fun person to be around when we were in our 20s and she was a big-time raver and party girl but now that we are in our 30s, to say that her life is an absolute dumpster fire would be sugar-coating a rotten orange that has developed a weird fuzz. For the past five years, she's made one bad decision after another and all of us (family/friends) have tried to help her, but you can lead a jackass to water, and she will complain that it's too cold and won't drink. I could write an essay on all the bad life decisions she’s made, but I will keep it as close to the core issue as possible If I go off on a tangent at any point, I give full permission to be admonished.

So, at dinner, my mutual friend wanted to get caught up on the Paris saga. Now the funny thing about Paris is that the second that she is in the room, she will go on and on and on about every bad thing that is happening to her, and it is very much “oh woe is me my ex-husband's against me my lawyers against me my kids are against me my parents are against me.” At first, like everyone else, I would sit and listen and try to put in my $0.02, but now whenever she opens her mouth, I have an imaginary violin playing in the background like in a Spanish novella with bad lighting and everything. So, before I started giving him updates, I asked, “Well, what's the last that you heard?”. To which they respond, “Well, I know she was having trouble getting her divorce from her husband and that she said that she had not talked to you for a year because you two were being very flirty with each other.”

For anyone that has ever seen Kill Bill and when B sees pure red before she's about to slice up the Yakuza. My face probably looked like that because my friend immediately tried to backtrack and say that they didn't believe what Paris had said.

Now for some context about five years ago I was getting divorced from my abusive ex-husband and when I mean abusive I mean he had tried to put a GPS tracker in my car, tried to put a hidden camera in our apartment and went through my phone bill got all of my contacts and proceeded to call every single family member and friend including this mutual friend to find out if I was sleeping around. This was after I had served him the divorce papers, clearly, he took it like a mature adult. I filed right before I started nursing school, and due to financial issues and RONNA (this was in the 2019/2020 saga) I had to live in the same apartment with him. Ex was never physically abusive, but he was emotionally, mentally, and financially abusive. (I could also write a short story on all the bad decisions I've made concerning my ex but let’s return to our family drama).

Paris had recently gotten married to her now ex-husband let's call him Zac. They had been married for about 3 months and while I knew about some of their issues and their relationship I thought they had resolved them before they actually put their marriage on legal paperwork. Especially since Paris had gotten a settlement from an accident at an apartment complex that would grant her about 125k. (cough, cough, **NO prenup**, cough, cough). Paris knew how my ex had been towards me and the years of abuse before and after we got married. She and Zac were going to be buying their first home together and asked if I wanted to move in. She knew I was desperate to get away from my ex because he didn't think I was serious about leaving him.

This brings us to my weekend of hell. And I mean hell, I mean: I was scared for my life, family had betrayed me, and had to leave with the clothes on my back and what we could put in my dad's truck. On this cluster cuss of a weekend, I was supposed to go floating on the river with Paris, her husband, and a couple of friends, my ex asked if I was planning on moving out. I said ‘yes’. I told him that the final straw was the nanny camera he was using to spy on me was the final straw. I had explained over and over again throughout the years of what bothered me. Ex was narcissistic and had paranoid personality disorder (not qualified to diagnose, but if the shoe fits Cinderella). When we argued, it was because of me. I had to apologize. If something good happened in my life, he would find something negative. If I tried to do something for myself, he would find a way to interject himself. I put off this conversation because I knew that he was going to explode, and he did not disappoint. It ultimately resulted in me crying and fleeing the house, calling my mom with Kim Kardashian ugly crying because he was showing his coworkers the camera feed of me when I was at home alone, unbeknownst to me. AKA fully invading my privacy with people I didn’t know. Mama Bear flat-out said, “You're not going back, we're getting your dad's truck, and we're moving everything out tomorrow while he's at work”.

Now, if that wasn't traumatic enough to start the day, onto the river where Paris and Zac started arguing halfway through. Ever been in that awkward situation where your friends are arguing, and they want you to take a side and all you wanna do is politely excuse yourself to go to the bathroom? Yeah no, in the middle of a river there was no escaping this. Paris was reasonably upset because Zac still had a CORN video that he had made with an ex on his phone. Zac fired back that she still had flirty messages between her and ex-baby daddy. Obviously, I'm on Paris's side on this one because she was 1000% over baby daddy and FATHER OF HER CHILDREN he’s going to be in their lives. (Side note: Zac said he wouldn’t adopt her 2 children if something happened to Paris). I'm not a big drinker but I do know we were drinking I think I had like maybe hard lemonade and Paris was a little toasted (yes this became a point of argument later). I like vodka with some family members, but not big on beer this is how I know I wasn’t drunk. At that point for whatever reason towards the end of the river Zac thought it appropriate to slap my A$$ not once but twice. Again, arguably we were supposed to be having fun on the river; there was drinking, and I already had a dramatic morning. So the only thing I could respond with at the time was, “OW Mother Floofer WTF?!”. This definitely did not help out the situation with Paris because later she would exclaim, “Zac is giving you WAY too much attention.” I hate that I have to mention this but Paris has a type: UGLY, ADDICITVE, LOSERS! I mention this because I have never not ONCE been attracted to any of our men or wanted any of her men. Especially since I was in the middle of a divorce, and honestly, I was starting to talk to someone else (This someone else was given the nickname “The Mountain” by my friends Zac was the Mexican version of Flavor Flav for visuals). To lighten the mood, I texted The Mountain and said that he needed to slap Paris because turnabout is fair play and showed Paris the text. Zac was not happy about this. If anyone can give me any ideas how I could have handled this situation better please let me know because my first instinct would have been to punch Zac, but that didn't exactly seem appropriate because MIDDLE OF A FREAKING RIVER! Zac eventually apologized and said that he considers me a family member, especially since Paris and I are close, and he didn't mean anything by it. I told him to his face not to take it personally, but I would never date you, and you are definitely not my type anyway, so let’s just move on. He vented about Paris and her drinking and that he didn't like it. He vented about some other relationship stuff, and I told him what his other friends and I were telling them was that they should have figured this out BEFORE they got married.

Next day Mama bear Papa bear and Big Brother help me move everything that I had ever bought or contributed to our apartment moved 90% of it into storage and I slept on a cot in my dad's office until I got moved into Paris's place. I was texting Paris asking what she thought she would need for her house, Zac was sending me messages on Snap partly apologetic partly asking how he should approach Paris about X,Y, and Z. Paris did say that she wanted to annul her marriage after Zac behavior I told her I will back her up no matter what her decision because I WAS on her side. Paris says she’s going to talk to Zac about his behavior, and they would discuss how to move forward. I was happy to be out of harm's way of the ex, but now my living situation was up in limbo. Now let us end off the weekend from hell with my family members decision that I received while at work.

Paris: “Zac and I talked, and we decided it's best you not move in with us.”

My internal monolog: “Let me get this straight you offered me a safe place to stay, all three of us talked about it for a couple weeks and got my hopes up. Then you drop a bombshell saying you wanted to annul your marriage, he has a CORN addiction, and allegedly, he cheats on you at a motel 6 with scarlet ladies. You don't trust him you're not mad at me you're disappointed in him BUT you’re essentially abandoning me and leaving me to figure it out DAY AFTER I had to move everything out of my apartment because we thought my ex was going to pull a “if I can’t have you no one can” scenario….”

My actual response: “K”

In hindsight, it was a blessing in disguise that I didn't move in with them. Their household got Britney Spears level toxic. Mama and Papa Bear are my heroes and the real MVPs. Papa bear had no problem letting me take over his office. Mama bear was taking care of my grandma, who lived in the mother-in-law suit of the house, until she passed at the young age of 88. She was a Russian/German hybrid. We thought she was scaring the Grim Reaper with the stink eye. I moved into the mother-in-law suite, divorced ex, and graduated nursing school and even got my BSN. Currently working as a Burn Nurse. (The Mountain was my rock. Wish I could say we worked out, but he got a REALLY good job in another state and long distance never works. He was my bearded ninja clown and my best love).

Paris and I did end up talking to each other but typical in our family we do not apologize or acknowledge any wrongdoing we just kind of sweep it under the rug and let bygones be bygones. The first time we saw each other face to face was at my sister in law's house after I had graduated. Now question for the class: Do we think that Paris and Zac worked on their issues and built a healthy relationship built on trust and understanding?? ABSOLUTELY NOT! While we were enjoying coffee Paris brought up how me and Zach were Snapping each other. At first I was completely taken aback because I had no idea what she was talking about but as she jogged my memory I pointed out, “You mean when you two were fighting and I was RESPONDING to his snaps because I was stuck in the middle while you were deciding if you wanted to end your marriage or not?”. I said it with my chest to her face, “I AM NOT ATTRACTED TO ANY OF YOUR MEN!”. The Mountain was a bodybuilder who at the time, was a Supervisor at a warehouse and had a superb flirt/burn ratio. Her ‘husband’ was 100lbs wet and looked like Hector from Coco, who drove for a delivery company, and had absolutely NO chill. WE ARE NOT THE SAME!!! So for anyone who is thinking that maybe the mutual friend might have misheard or wanted to cause drama, Paris’s past actions were proof enough for me to believe them. IF THE GLOVE FITS!

At every family function, I’d get stuck babysitting her kids so she could socialize with the family and go on and on and on about how horrible her life is. It was either Zac like every girl or every girl like Zac. We followed each other on social media and I got into bodybuilding and did a couple competitions and sometimes, she would leave sarcastic comment that SHE thought was funny but I give bombastic side eye to. (She'd compliment me too she wasn't a total Nerf Herder) I went on a couple of family vacations and some solo trips, her favorite catch phrase became, “When I get financially stable, I’ll do x,y,z”. Yeah, that settlement she got? She blew 80k of that on a car and eventually lost the rest.  Then, there are some comments that her kids said around me. One of them asked if it was true that I was dating my pilot instructor, that’s why I was getting free pilot lessons. (This was Zac’s MARRIED best friend and NO we are friends BUT I was PAYING him to get my pilot’s license). Another time, they commented on how I was living in ‘luxury’ because of all my stuff. Her kids were 8 and 11. They're smart kids, but SOMEONE put those ideas into their heads. Not gonna lie, I was not a big fan of hers, so I did tell family members that I thought she was jealous and insecure. Not with just me with ANY female.

Now comes the climax of our drama-filled foot-long sandwich. Thank you if you've made it this far after all that context hopefully, it gives you an idea of where my anger was coming from. After catching up with our mutual friend, I did not act right then. I let myself give it a couple of days to see if I was still angry…..YEP still angry. I was angry at the jealousy, angry at every stupid decision she’s made even though we've all tried to give her advice, angry because of how she's raising her kids, and honestly still angry I never got an apology for being abandoned when I needed her. If she had said, “Hey I don't want to put you in a bad situation so I think it's a good idea if you don't move in.” I could have let it go. But my recovering people pleasers, I did not want to keep this person in my life anymore.

And so the barrage of angry texts ensued. (I’d screen shot but I was talk texting) so here’s the jist:

Me: “I KNOW you are not stupid enough to tell people that I was EVER attracted to ANY of your ugly ass loser boyfriends! Need I remind you that we didn't talk for a year because you left me high and dry without anywhere to go and I had to sleep on my dad's cot for months after EX LITERALLY attacked me do you have ANY IDEA how much that hurt and you never apologized for doing that to me and now I'm finding out that you actually told people that I was flirting with ZAC! I want a freaking apology from you. You abandoned me after giving me false hope and I was trying to be in your corner when you said you wanted to end things with Zac.”

Paris: “I don't know who you heard that from, but I never said that I was mad at Zac not you and don't play innocent. You've been lying and gossiping to family members about what happened, calling me insecure and jealous. How do you think that felt?! You're the one talking sh\*t, not me YOU! You took shots with Zac I saw you! You were the one drunk, not me. So you need to apologize to me for lying.

Me: “You ARE jealous, you ARE insecure, and YOU DO HAVE A DRINKING PROBLEM! You abandoned me and we didn't talk for a year you think family members aren't gonna ask me what happened? And you what?! I thought I was mad! Even if I took shots with Zac I wasn't drunk. And what did you expect ME to do after he acted inappropriate?! But you chose to stay with them you put yourself in that situation.

I’m a FTM to a 10 month old so it’s my first Mother’s Day as a mum, but even though he would have spoilt me, I told my husband I didn’t want to do anything or even really acknowledge it. In my opinion, I chose to be a mother so I don’t expect my daughter to congratulate me for that every year and shower me in gifts and flowers. I hope I raise her to show appreciation for the things that matter. 

I spent the day with my daughter and my own mum (who I did wish a Happy Mother’s Day and told her how much I appreciate her every day) and it was lovely.  The weather was glorious, we had a long walk, got coffee and enjoyed each others’ company. There were no expectations or disappointments like I’m reading on every other parenting sub.

Okay, so I need to figure out what this SVG path represents. Let me start by looking at the code. The viewBox is set from 0 0 to 82.783 by 174, which suggests the image is taller than it is wide. The path data is pretty complex with a lot of curves and lines.



First, I'll try to visualize the shape. Since it's an SVG path, maybe I can break it down into segments. The path starts with a move to M 44.41357 5.43087, then a cubic Bezier curve (C command) with several control points. The coordinates go from around 3 to 170 in the Y-axis, so it's a vertical shape.



Looking at the commands, there are multiple C (cubic Bezier) and some M (move) commands. The path has a lot of curves and loops. Let me see if I can identify any common shapes. The first part might be creating a rounded top, maybe a head? Then there are curves that go down, perhaps forming a body. There's a part that goes to 145.95537 in Y, which is near the bottom of the viewBox. Then there are some loops or maybe limbs.



Wait, the path also has some zig-zag lines. Maybe this is an animal or a person? The fill is black, so it's a solid shape. Let me think about common SVG icons. Could it be a bird? The curves might form wings. Or maybe a human figure? The initial part might be the head, then the body, and the lower parts could be legs. Alternatively, maybe it's a tree with branches? But the strokes and fills are black, which is common for icons.



Looking at the coordinates again, the highest Y is 174, so the shape spans the entire height. The width is around 82 units. The path has several loops, which might indicate something with a tail or maybe a sitting animal. The part around 19.6236 75.12238 might be a curve going up, then down again. There's a section that goes to 171.22188, which is close to the maximum Y, so maybe a foot or base.



Another approach: sometimes complex paths can be recognized by key features. If there's a part that looks like ears, maybe a rabbit? Or if there are wings, a bat. Alternatively, maybe it's a stylized letter or symbol. The fill is solid, so it's a closed path. Let me think about the movement. Starting near the top, moving down with curves, then loops. The part where it goes to 145.95537 in Y and then back up might form a leg or an arm.



Wait, there's a section with ""Z"" at the end of some commands, which closes the path. The first segment ends with Z, so maybe it's a single continuous shape. Alternatively, maybe multiple subpaths. The path data has several M commands, which might indicate separate shapes, but the main path is a single continuous one.



Alternatively, could this be a map outline? Unlikely given the size. Maybe a musical instrument like a violin? The curves might resemble the body and neck. Or a guitar? But the proportions don't seem right.



Let me check the middle part. Coordinates around 34.75708 132.61687 might form a bend. There's a part that goes from 44.91058 145.95537 to 45.07056 157.08987, which is a vertical line. Then a curve to 160.73738, then to 163.63637. Maybe this is a leg standing upright.



Another thought: the shape might be a human in a specific pose, like a dancer or someone waving. The loops could be arms raised. The lower part might be a dress or legs. Alternatively, a four-legged animal like a dog or cat. The initial curve could be the head, then the body, and the legs at the bottom.



Wait, looking at the path data again, after the initial curve, there's a section that goes down to 75.12238, then curves to 104.62288, which is near the middle. Then up to 126.19887, which might be a hump. Then curves down again. Maybe a camel with a hump? Or a dinosaur with a curved back.



Alternatively, considering the stroke and fill are both black, maybe it's a silhouette. If I think of a silhouette, maybe a person running or a specific animal. The path's complexity suggests multiple curves, so maybe a bird in flight with wings spread. The lower part could be tail feathers.



Alternatively, think about common symbols. The shape doesn't immediately ring a bell as a heart, star, or arrow. Maybe a tree? The trunk would be vertical, branches spreading out. But the path seems more organic with curves.



Another angle: the numbers in the path. The viewBox is 82x174, so aspect ratio is roughly 1:2.1. Tall and narrow. Maybe a bottle or a vase? The curves might form the contours of a bottle. The initial part is the neck, then the body widens and narrows again. Let me imagine: starting at the top (44,5), curving down to form the neck, then the body. The lower part might have a base. But the path seems to have multiple loops, which a bottle wouldn't. Alternatively, a wine glass with a stem and base.



Wait, there's a part that goes from 3.00006 104.62288 to 3.20508 114.68138, which is a vertical line on the left side. Then curves to 122.88637, 126.19887. Maybe this is the left side of a symmetrical object. If mirrored, it could form a symmetrical shape like a vase. But the path isn't symmetrical, as the right side has different curves.



Alternatively, the shape could be a fish. The curves could represent the body, fins, and tail. The initial part the head, then the body, and the tail at the end. The loops might be fins. The lower part could be the lower fin.



Alternatively, think of a seahorse, which has a curved body and tail. The path's curves might form that. The initial curve is the head, then the body curls down.



Wait, looking at the path's end, there's a segment that goes to 50.80457 137.22638, then to 52.25208 131.48688, which might form a loop. Maybe this is the tail of a seahorse or a similar creature.



Alternatively, the path might be a stylized number or letter. But given the complexity, probably not.



Another approach: search for similar SVG paths. Maybe it's a known icon. For example, a stork, a flamingo, or a heron—birds with long legs and curved necks. The path's length and curves could represent a long neck and legs. The initial curve is the head and neck, then the body, and the legs extending down.



Alternatively, a snake coiling. The path has many curves, but the viewBox is tall, so a vertical snake.



Wait, the path has a part that goes up to 170.57088, which is near the bottom of the viewBox (174). So maybe the legs are at the bottom. If it's a bird, the long legs would be at the bottom. The curves in the middle could be the body and wings.



Alternatively, a human figure with arms raised. The top part is the head, the middle the body, arms up, and legs at the bottom.



Hmm. Given the complexity, maybe it's a specific animal or character. The key is to look for distinctive features. The part around 19.6236 75.12238 to 80.94487 might form a wing or a limb.



Wait, looking at the ZM commands, which might close a subpath and start a new one. For example, after the first Z, there's a M 51.95508 18.26287, which starts another subpath. So maybe the main shape is the body, and then there are additional elements like an eye or an accessory. The second subpath (starting at 51.95508 18.26287) could be a smaller shape, maybe an eye or a decoration.



Similarly, the third subpath starts at M 40.24554 71.09987, which might be another part like a limb or a feature. Then another subpath starting at M 55.64258 84.14737. So perhaps the main body is the first path, and the others are details like legs, arms, or facial features.



If the main body is a human or animal shape, the additional paths could be arms, legs, or other parts. For example, the first subpath is the head and body, the next ones are arms and legs.



Looking at the second subpath: starts at 51.955, 18.262. The commands there create a small shape, maybe an eye or an ear. The third subpath starts at 40.245, 71.099, which is lower down, maybe an arm or leg. The fourth subpath starts at 55.642, 84.147, perhaps another limb.



Putting this together, if the main shape is a human, the additional subpaths could be arms and legs. Alternatively, if it's an animal, they could be legs, tail, ears, etc.



Alternatively, the main shape is a person with arms raised, and the additional paths are details.



Alternatively, it's a bird with wings spread, and the subpaths are feathers or legs.



Another clue: the fill is black, so it's a solid silhouette. The fact that there are multiple subpaths suggests different parts of the figure.



Wait, the first subpath ends with Z, then M starts a new one. So there are four separate closed paths. The main one is the largest, and the others are smaller.



Looking at the second subpath: it starts at 51.955, 18.262, which is near the top. The commands there create a shape that might be a circular feature, like an eye. The third subpath starts at 40.245, 71.099, which is mid-body. The commands there form a shape that might be a leg or an arm. The fourth subpath starts at 55.642, 84.147, which is on the other side, perhaps the other limb.



Putting this all together, maybe it's a human figure in a specific pose. The main body is standing, arms possibly out, and the additional paths are arms or legs. Alternatively, a stick figure with more details.



Alternatively, the main shape is a person sitting, with legs crossed. The loops in the path could represent the legs folded.



Wait, another thought: the numbers in the path data might correspond to coordinates that, when plotted, form a specific image. Since I can't visualize it directly, I need to think of common SVG paths.



Alternatively, it's a kangaroo, given the long tail and legs. The curves might form the body and tail.



Alternatively, the path resembles a running person, like the ones seen on restroom signs but more detailed.



Another angle: the path has a lot of curves that go up and down, which might indicate a sitting animal like a squirrel with a bushy tail.



Wait, the initial part goes from the top down to about 75, then up to 126, which could be a hunched back. Then down again. Maybe a camel or dromedary with a hump.



Alternatively, a dinosaur like a brontosaurus with a long neck and tail.



Alternatively, a giraffe with a long neck. The initial curve would be the head and neck, then the body, and the legs.



Alternatively, a dog sitting with its tail curled.



But without seeing the image, it's challenging. However, given the path's complexity and the presence of multiple subpaths, I think it's likely a stylized animal or human figure. Considering the height and the curves, maybe a bird like a stork or heron. The long legs would correspond to the lower part of the SVG.



Alternatively, a person in a dress, with the dress flaring out at the bottom. The initial curve is the torso, then the dress flows down.



Wait, looking at the coordinates again, the first main path goes from Y=5 to Y=171, so almost the full height. The width is around 44 to 3 on the left and up to 82 on the right. So the main shape is centered but extends more to the right.



Hmm. Maybe it's a side view of a person walking. The head is at the top, the body curves for the back, and the legs are extended. The additional subpaths could be the arms.



Alternatively, a side view of a horse, with the mane, back, and legs.



But considering the subpaths, especially the one starting at M 55.64258 84.14737, which has commands leading to 88.17387, 100.35788, etc., maybe that's a raised limb or a wing.



Given that I'm struggling to pinpoint it, maybe I should consider common SVG icons that have this structure. Another possibility is that it's a logo or a specific character.



Wait, the path's fill is black, and it's a single color. Maybe it's a simplified outline of a famous character, like Mickey Mouse. The ears would be circles, but the path here is more complex.



Alternatively, a teddy bear with rounded shapes.



Another thought: the path includes a part that goes to 171.22188, which is near the bottom, so perhaps shoes or feet.



Alternatively, the shape is a candle with a flame. The top part is the flame, and the body is the candle. But the path is more intricate.



Alternatively, a wine bottle with a label. But again, the curves don't quite fit.



Wait, the first subpath has a section that goes from 3.00006 104.62288 to 3.20508 114.68138, which is a vertical line on the left. Then it curves to the right, forming a bulge. That could be the left side of a vase or urn. Then the path continues to the right, forming the other side. But the path isn't symmetrical, so maybe it's a pitcher with a handle. The handle could be one of the subpaths.



Alternatively, a coffee cup with a handle. The main path is the cup, and the subpath is the handle.



But the main path seems too tall for a cup.



Alternatively, a guitar. The body would be the lower part, the neck the upper. The subpaths could be the soundhole and other details.



Given that the main path goes from top to bottom with curves, maybe a violin. The upper bout, lower bout, and the neck. The subpaths could be the F-holes and the scroll.



But I'm not sure. Another approach: count the number of nodes or key points. However, without visualizing, it's tough.



Wait, the user mentioned ""like actually look at the shape,"" so maybe it's something recognizable when seen. Since I can't render the SVG here, I have to infer.



Considering all the elements: tall, narrow, curves, multiple subpaths, possibly limbs or features. The most probable answer is a human figure, perhaps in a specific pose, or a bird like a stork. Alternatively, a four-legged animal.



Given the complexity and the presence of what might be legs and a tail, I'll go with a dog or a similar animal. Alternatively, a running person.



Wait, another angle: the path data includes a segment that goes from 44.91058 145.95537 to 45.07056 157.08987, which is a vertical line, then curves to 160.73738. This could be a leg. If there are two legs, it's a biped; four legs, a quadruped.



But the path has multiple segments that might represent legs. The main path might have two legs, and the subpaths could be arms or a tail.



Alternatively, it's a person wearing a long coat or dress, with the subpaths as sleeves.



Hmm. After considering various possibilities, I think the most likely answer is that this SVG path represents a human figure, possibly in a dynamic pose with arms and legs depicted. Alternatively, a bird with wings and legs. Given the vertical nature and curves, maybe a heron or stork standing on one leg.



Alternatively, the user might be tricking me, and it's a common symbol like a question mark or exclamation point, but the path is too complex for that.



Wait, the path ends with a segment that goes to 50.80457 137.22638, then to 52.25208 131.48688, which could form a loop, maybe a hand or a foot.



Considering all this, I'll make an educated guess that the SVG depicts a human figure, perhaps a stick figure in a specific pose, or an animal like a bird. Given the complexity and the presence of multiple subpaths, I think it's a stylized human figure, maybe a runner or dancer.

The SVG path appears to represent a **stylized human figure**, likely in a dynamic pose such as running or dancing. Key observations supporting this include:

1. **Silhouette Structure**: The main path outlines a vertical, human-like form with a head at the top, a torso, and legs extending downward. Subpaths suggest details like arms, hands, or dynamic motion lines.
2. **Curves and Proportions**: The curves mimic organic human anatomy (e.g., rounded shoulders, limbs in motion). The tall, narrow viewBox (82x174) aligns with a standing figure.
3. **Subpaths**: Smaller closed paths (e.g., starting at `M 51.95508 18.26287` and `M 55.64258 84.14737`) likely represent features like hands, feet, or accessories, adding detail to the pose.

While abstract, the combination of flowing curves and segmented limbs strongly suggests a **human figure in motion**, akin to minimalist art or athletic icons.",0,1743362674.0,DeepSeek,0,0.5,False

I am doing a better job of not really moving around all that much this fast.  ill hold a table pose and a childs pose a couple times a day and walk a mile or two slowly.  also ive been writing a few tasks to keep myself busy during the day, giving myself a little task list each day.  little things to keep my mind off things.  i had a pretty emotional day yesterday, something about forgiveness... its been a hard one for me to deal with but i started toying with the idea of forgiveness and it just triggered me into a rage.  this was all in my head of course and i was alone at the time.  but it really had me wound up.  i stopped myself and remembered that i was in a fasted state and it might be a good time for me to get a handle on all this stuff ive been holding onto for all these years.  i think i decided i needed to get over it and i was able to fall asleep.  i think i dreamed about it too but i cant really remember my dreams too much.  i woke up and i felt better.  ive been doing a lot to work on my emotional state and ive been working on it for a long time.  and i need to remember im working on that stuff for me and my own well being and the people who really care about me.  sometimes i think, ""well ive been doing all this work (including extended fasting) why cant you do just a little bit of work?"" and now as i write that i can see that thats a dumb way to think because im doing all that work because i want to live in peace and not be haunted by negative emotions all the time.  thats my choice, and if someone wants to avoid that type of work and live in their own little mind castle and all that that entails that is their choice.  

anyways i got a little off topic there.  i am sleeping better now during this fast than i usually do, in fact i am sleeping pretty much like normal just like an hour or so less per night.  as i mentioned in my last post i quit caffeine about 3 weeks before i started fasting and  i think that was a good call.  my plan is to not  drink caffeine for at least 6 months but probably longer, perhaps forever?  i know when i drink caffeine i drink and smoke more.  i dont smoke weed or cigarettes, but i enjoy a cigar from time to time but i feel a lot less inclined when i dont have my morning pot o tea.  

Also i decided to weigh myself every 3 days as a way to motivate myself and create 'mini milestones'.  so the last time i weighed myself i was at 211.7 and that was over 2 days ago.  so i actually dropped 11 pounds in three days and that was after i had fasted for 36 hours! so i am incredibly pleased with that.  and i am excited about weighing myself tomorrow.  after that ill have 2 more weigh ins thursday the third and then on the final day sunday the 6th.  peace.",1,1743362235.0,fasting,3,0.57,False

We're engaged and bought our first house together 4 months ago.

My fiancée recently revealed she's been in contact with a woman she dated briefly a few years ago. This contact was kept secret from me for the past month, and she seems to have only told me because they decided to start gaming online together regularly (every two days this week). She even texts this person frequently while we are supposed to be spending quality time together. While this past relationship wasn't serious, the girl lives elsewhere and is engaged now, the secrecy is what's really getting to me.

I'm feeling hurt and betrayed. The reason this is so difficult is because it's a repeat performance. Over a year ago, she did something very similar: secretly reconnected with a more serious ex (whom she'd lived with) and only told me when a coffee meeting was already scheduled. This happened despite me clearly stating early in our relationship that I wasn't comfortable with friendships with exes.

Her reaction back then was to call me overly jealous and suggest *I* needed therapy for it (the two therapists I saw actually validated my feelings). The situation only resolved when I became deeply unhappy in the relationship, leading her to cut contact with that ex. The whole ordeal significantly damaged my trust, making me hesitate before buying the house, though I eventually decided to commit.

Now, this new situation feels like a slap in the face. It's the same pattern: secret contact with a past interest, revealed only partially or when unavoidable. I feel like my trust wasn't fully rebuilt, and now it's taken another major hit. I know I need to talk to her, but I'm worried it will just devolve into the same fight as last time, with her dismissing my feelings as simple jealousy.

How can I approach this conversation focusing on the *pattern* of secrecy and its impact on trust, rather than just the contact itself, in a way that might actually lead to understanding instead of defensiveness?

**TL;DR:** Fiancée hid contact with a past fling for a month, bringing back painful memories of a previous, similar incident with an ex that involved secrecy and dismissal of my feelings/boundaries. We're engaged and just bought a house. Need advice on how to address this recurring pattern of broken trust without repeating past destructive fights.",0,1743362049.0,relationship_advice,2,0.5,False
1jnk0mc,https://i.redd.it/tbgrsg85mvre1.jpeg,Café William,"I was going to buy an Italian based coffee bean but then a special caught my eye on the shelf. It was Café William for a bit less than 11$ for 360g, had never heard or seen of them so I pulled up my phone to look them up online. 

I was pretty happy to see that they are a Canadian company from Quebec. Not only that but their sustainability efforts are honesty pretty impressive! From the incorporation of sail boats to reduce emissions, organic certifications with their farmers (they obviously dont grow coffee beans in Canada), roasting their beans with hydro electricity instead of natural gas and even have partly recycled packaging.

They have just bought a factory in Quebec that they plan to run solely on hydro electricity with electric trucks for transport and even greener packaging are all in the works. Zero emissions are the goal.

Amazing company aside, the coffee was delicious!! First opening it, it had such a nice aroma right away. I brewed it in my espresso machine with their pre-ground beans (I know, I know I'm just waiting on a delivery of my whole beans). It had a thick crema and such a full flavor. Not bitter but a very deep roasted flavor for sure. I would say it's maybe a tad strong for a medium roast, but the lack of bitterness is what confirms, to me, the medium roast. 

I would say I'm more of a dark roast coffee type but this is honestly super good. It's different from what I've had before, I don't think I've quite tasted something like this. I won't say it's the best I ever had, but it is unique and up there in my tops.

Perfect for personal growth enthusiasts, those feeling stuck in patterns they can't identify, or anyone curious about the hidden narrative their life is telling. The insights often reveal surprising disconnects between who you think you are and the identity you're actually projecting.

```
<Role>
You are a Lifestyle Forensics Analyst, combining expertise in behavioral psychology, symbolic analysis, and pattern recognition. You possess the rare ability to decode unconscious identity patterns from seemingly mundane lifestyle choices. Your analytical approach is both clinical and intuitive, allowing you to see through the persona people consciously project to the identity they unconsciously broadcast.
</Role>

<Context>
Every human creates an elaborate identity narrative through countless daily choices—from wardrobe selections to digital habits to environmental preferences. These choices form patterns that are rarely consciously examined but broadcast powerful signals about core values, insecurities, aspirations, and emotional states. A forensic analysis of these patterns can reveal profound insights about a person's true psychological blueprint and identity scripts they may be unaware they're following.
</Context>

<Instructions>
1. Collect detailed information about various aspects of the user's lifestyle choices. Request specifics about 3-5 of these categories based on their initial input:
   - Physical environment (home organization, decorative choices, workspace)
   - Daily routines and time management patterns
   - Digital footprint (app usage, notification settings, browser history themes)
   - Consumption habits (food preferences, shopping patterns, entertainment choices)
   - Communication style (texting habits, social media presence, verbal patterns)
   - Appearance choices (clothing preferences, grooming habits, accessory selections)

2. Identify recurring patterns, contradictions, and symbolic elements across these choices.

3. Analyze these patterns through these psychological lenses:
   - Core values being unconsciously prioritized
   - Unresolved tensions or polarities
   - Aspirational versus actual identity
   - Emotional needs being expressed indirectly
   - Defense mechanisms and coping strategies
   - Inherited versus chosen patterns

4. Synthesize your findings into a comprehensive identity blueprint that reveals:
   - The unconscious narrative the person is broadcasting
   - Hidden motivations driving seemingly unrelated choices
   - Psychological barriers preventing alignment with desired identity
   - Unrealized potentials suggested by pattern variations

5. Present your analysis in direct, insightful language that balances honesty with empathy. Include both affirming insights and challenging revelations.

6. Conclude with 2-3 specific suggestions for how they might bring greater awareness to unconscious patterns if they wish to modify them.
</Instructions>

<Constraints>
- Avoid superficial personality typing systems or generalized horoscope-like statements
- Do not make moral judgments about their lifestyle choices
- Focus on pattern recognition rather than individual choices in isolation
- Balance psychological depth with accessible language
- Maintain a tone that is professionally direct but not coldly clinical
- Do not overemphasize pathology—identify strengths and adaptive patterns too
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Provide your analysis in these sections:

## Pattern Recognition:
Identify 3-5 key patterns detected across their lifestyle choices, with specific examples from their input.

## Identity Blueprint:
Present a cohesive analysis of the unconscious identity narrative revealed by these patterns, including core drivers, contradictions, and unacknowledged aspects.

## Unconscious Broadcasts:
Explain what these patterns are likely communicating to others without the person's awareness.

## Potential Awareness Shifts:
Offer 2-3 specific observations about how greater consciousness of these patterns might serve their growth.
</Output_Format>

<User_Input>
Reply with: ""Please share details about your lifestyle choices and habits in several categories (your home, routines, digital behavior, appearance preferences, etc.), and I'll begin my forensic identity analysis,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific lifestyle information.
</User_Input>
```

Three Prompt Use Cases:

1. Personal Growth & Self-Discovery: Uncover blind spots in your self-perception and identify patterns that may be holding you back from authentic self-expression or goal achievement.

2. Relationship Understanding: Gain insights into how your unconscious signals might be affecting your relationships and how others perceive you differently than you intend.

3. Behavioral Change Support: Identify the root causes of persistent habits or patterns you've been trying to change, allowing for more targeted and effective interventions.

Example User Input: ""My apartment is minimalist with mostly black and white furniture but colorful art. I check my phone first thing in the morning and last thing at night, but silence notifications during work hours. I wear mostly neutral colors but always have one bright accessory. I meal prep healthy foods but order takeout when stressed. My browser history is full of productivity articles but also lots of fantasy fiction.""

1jnjxoa,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaximizeMe/comments/1jnjxoa/are_you_overwhelmed_try_this_10minute_time/,🕒 Are You Overwhelmed? Try This 10-Minute Time Blocking Challenge: Reclaim 2 Hours/Day!,"**🕒 Feeling overwhelmed by your to-do list? You’re not alone!** We've all been there—staring at our schedules wondering how on earth we'll squeeze everything in. But what if I told you that you could magically reclaim two whole hours of your day? Yep, you heard that right! 🚀

So I recently stumbled upon this thing called the **10-Minute Time Blocking Challenge**, and honestly, it’s been a game-changer for me. Imagine giving your chaos a little structure with just 10 minutes of planning––sounds like a life hack, right?

Ever had one of those days where you look back and think, “Where did all the time go?” Well, this is for you!

Here’s the scoop:

1. **Set a Timer for 10 Minutes**: Grab a coffee, set a timer, and give yourself 10 minutes to plan your day. Think of it like a daily meeting with your future self!

2. **List Those Must-Dos**: Grab a sticky note or the back of an old receipt. Jot down the top 3-4 things you absolutely must get done. Extra points if you add a little doodle next to each point for fun. 🎨

3. **Time Block Like a Pro**: Break your day into chunks. Imagine your day is like a delicious pie, and each slice represents different tasks: work, errands, fun, etc. Prioritize those must-dos first!

   - 📧 **Emails**: 9-9:30 AM (Yep, you get a whole pie slice just for emails!)
   - 💪 **Work/Study Blocks**: 10-11:30 AM and 2-3:30 PM
   - 🍕 **Breaks/You-Time**: 12:30-1 PM and 4 PM (Walk, stretch, dance party—whatever recharges you!)

4. **Embrace Flexibility**: Life happens! If something doesn't fit, just re-evaluate and shift blocks around. Think of your schedule as a puzzle, not a straitjacket.

5. **Reflect and Adjust**: Before wrapping up your day, take another 5 minutes to look over what you did. What worked? What didn’t? Maybe reward yourself with a short episode of your favorite show. 📺

**Imagine**: By spending just 10 minutes a day on this, you'll notice less stress and more control. Who knew that time management could feel like a superpower?

Some days, you'll nail it. Other days, you’ll wonder what went wrong. But that’s all part of the journey! 😊 

Have you tried time blocking before? How do you keep the overwhelm at bay? Share your stories, tips, or even time blocking fails—let’s dive into this wild time management adventure together!",1,1743361736.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False
1jnjxb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagoapartments/comments/1jnjxb1/subleaselease_takeover_spacious_studio_in_hyde/,Sublease/Lease Takeover: Spacious Studio in Hyde Park,"Rent, incl. flat fee for utilities, is $1385/month. Internet is another $30. Available from between May 28 to June 8 until August 11 (when the lease expires). At the end of the lease, you'll have the option to renew.

I am looking for someone to sublease my studio apartment (and hopefully take over the lease, but not required)! The nearest intersection is S. Cornell Ave. and E 55th St. in Hyde Park. It's <5 minutes walking to Trader Joe's/Walgreens, <10 minutes walking to the Point, and <2 minutes walking to the Metra. For UChicago students, free public transport to campus is available basically across the street. The unit is north-facing and gets a lot of sunlight, even on overcast and cloudy days. Laundry's in the basement, and the building is quiet--mostly occupied by UChicago students. 

It is a spacious studio with a separate & enclosed kitchen and a separate dining area. The living area has enough space for a queen bed, a loveseat, coffee table, a writing desk, and a couple of shelves here and there, with tons of room leftover. The dining area has a full size dining table with space leftover. There's also a HUGE walk-in closet with tons of space--storage is not an issue here. 

Ideally, I'm looking for someone who would take over my lease + buy some of my furniture as well. I am eager to make deals on the furniture and would prefer to get everything settled ASAP. ",1,1743361708.0,chicagoapartments,0,1.0,False
1jnjx7w,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParanormalEncounters/comments/1jnjx7w/the_shadows_that_lived_in_the_laundry_room/,The Shadows That Lived In The Laundry Room,"Back when I was younger I would sleep in my mom room which was our fully finished basement it was large one side having a small lounge like area including a couch, coffee table, and tv and on the other side was her bed and a small bathroom the basement led to the laundry room. It was a concrete room with the washer and dryer and a storage space as big as a room around the corner. My mom had placed a full metal clothing rack right by the doorway it had no door so you could always see into it this is important for later. I would see these shadow figures three to be exact. They each had something defining about them they all look human-ish but just shadow. I remember the one I would sometimes see in my own room was always waving and he was taller then the other two bulkier almost. The second one was had in-human legs it looked like he had really baggy pants on or something like that it would always be staring at me. The last one was smaller and skinner and would always be hiding in the laundry rack that by the door. I was always told this was a recurring nightmare or sleep paralysis and I believed that for a while but I have Aphantasia which causes me not to dream at all. So what was it? You might think it was sleep paralysis but that was disproven when one night I tried to sit up cause I couldn’t with the shadows watching me and it worked. I though this was weird because I knew you were not supposed to be able to move during sleep paralysis or talk but I could do both and it wasn’t something I made up because it woke up my mom and she remembered asking me what was wrong or something like that the next morning. I don’t know what to make of this but I know deep down they were real and after we moved I never saw them again.",1,1743361701.0,ParanormalEncounters,1,1.0,False
1jnjx5o,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jnjx5o,"Romanian AK Factory Folding Charging Handle? | US-Import Marked Romanian AKs at Swiss Gunshop | AATS-Group GmbH | Burgdorf, Switzerland","I visited AATS-Group, which is a very professional firearms dealer in Burgdorf, Switzerland. They have a beautifully-designed retail space with a wide range of new and used firearms. Also, Swiss hospitality is fantastic--even the coffee at a gunshop is excellent!

They had a row of Romanian AKs with thumbhole stocks that were installed on imported AKs in the 1990s in order to be compliant with the 1989 US import restrictions. All the AKs all had US import marks but two of them caught my eye. They have what appear to be factory-installed folding charging handles, which I’ve never seen before on an AK. Does anyone know the history behind this style charging handles?

Also, I would love to know how these ended up in Switzerland. My guess would be they were going to be imported into the US but then the import rules changed again and so they had to go elsewhere.

More cool stuff coming, stay tuned! You can’t believe how great Switzerland is.

For one with Chicory, I tried...

1. Narasu Udhayam
2. Narasu Anandham
3. Bru Green Label

Green Label tastes good, but the chicory there causes stomach issues. Udhayam was next best. None of the Narasu's caused stomach issues.

And for Coffee alone, I tried...

1. Narasu PB
2. Cothas Yellow
3. Costco Colombian Dark Roast.

Cothas was terrible. The flavor is not as I hoped. Narasu PB is meh. Costco's was better, but there was some getting used to. I did try few other beans with Dark, Medium and Light roast with medium and fine grounds. I find I like medium grounds better.

I drink with and without milk.

But none of this comes close to what I had in Broadway or the acquaintance's house.

Where am I going wrong? Should the decoction be cold? Should I use half-and-half or full-fat milk or 2% fat milk? I tried all three. Full fat tasted better, but we are getting older. 2% may be better. Or is it the water quantity against tthe coffee powder quantity?

Maybe goes without saying given that I'm looking for dates on Reddit but ya, turbo neurodivergent nerd weirdo here. I bring that up right off the bat because I've struggled most of my life in developing meaningful relationships, not just romantically, but in any kind. First and foremost, socializing is a lot of work for me, and I need lots of space to myself. I work full time and have a number of other family obligations (none child-related, I am not a father nor do I want to be) which leave me on a pretty constant state of low mental + emotional battery. I'm open to all kinds of relationships, basically just depends on the person. Communication and respect for any partner(s) are foundational.

It's not to say I'm always wanting to be left alone or that I'm never emotionally available, I certainly am, I just don't have a lot of extra capacity, and I have limited means with which to create time for new people. Not to sound too vulnerable about any of this. For the record, I'm quite proud and confident in myself and of who I am, but I just want to emphasize and acknowledge that I'm not going to be for everyone. As an example, exceptional situations aside, I \*hate\* texting so if you're someone who likes to be in constant contact with their partner, it will seriously drain me and you should prolly move on! That is to say I love attention and affection from my partner myself, so I get wanting that stuff but let's do it in person whenever possible.

Speaking of moving on, I have a series of very niche and specific interests, namely revolutionary lefty/progressive politics, activism, and history. I spend a lot of my time reading news articles, studies, and books. Sufficed to say if we're really going to hit it off it's probably important for you to share these values and interests. Free Palestine, f the police, abolish capitalism, yadda yadda yadda. I also enjoy gaming, movies, music and the arts, and I like to think I'm a half-way decent cook. I love early mornings chilling outside and drinking coffee.

I'm pretty good with money (I'm frugal af), so other than the mortgage I'm paying for my home I'm basically debt free. Overall, I like to think I'm a good partner and that I give far more than I take (not only monetarily). The demands of life make being a good partner pretty difficult for reasons I've touched on earlier, so I guess there will just need to be that understanding that if I seem disinterested or out of it it's just brain fog and my own state of being perpetual overwhelmed.

Physically, I'm 5'8, and hover around 150 pounds, I'm on the slender side. I like to think of myself as an intellectual pretty boy lol I have pretty fair complexion, long brown hair and big ol dark brown eyes that I've been complimented on by most every partner I've been with. I don't lift so sorry if ya need the muscles, you're better off moving on sadly. As for your physical appearance, I'm not overly picky, lots of looks can work, and I'm hardly an amazing physical specimen myself, but if you're overly heavyset, it prolly won't work for me. Just best to get that out of the way I feel, I don't mean any judgement.

I will leave this post mostly free of specific bedroom activity discussion, but ya I'm pretty regularly cravey at the end of the night (I have pretty regular dom tendencies). That said I'm getting older and feeling it and often times my libido comes and goes these days. Pretty responsive to my partner(s) needs there.",1,1743361342.0,polyamoryR4R,1,1.0,False

*I did not watch the music videos nor read the lyrics. I do not know ATEEZ. I don't know their names, what they look like or any of their songs. I only know there are 8 members and they were at Coachella. I don't listen to K-pop. I've tried and did not like most of what I've heard. I am doing this because I'm bored and thought doing album marathons rather than movie marathons could be fun. I picked ATEEZ because I like one of their album covers. I listened to every song only once and typed what I felt as I was listening. Also, I have ADHD and you can feel my mind slowly melting as you read. I apologize for that.*

Now, let's go!


**- TREASURE EP.1: All to Zero -**

Intro : Long Journey 
- I do feel like i'm embarking on a journey.
- Very good intro in my opinion as I feel like I'm about to discover an entire fictional universe rather than a band.

Pirate King
- Very K-pop? Kind of what I would have in mind if someone told me ""think of a k-pop group"".
- The first chorus and tiny voice rapper did surprise me.
- The last chorus is also very unexpected!

Treasure
- A bit confused by the intro and first verse. I don't really understand where we're going (not in a negative way).
- The journey feeling is present again though.
- Beautiful beautiful beautiful chorus.
- I kind of hate the way the beat changes at beginning of the second verse but it doesn't change the way i feel about the whole song.

Twilight
- Completely different direction so I'm quite confused
- Sounds like a background music for an aesthetic vlog (not in a bad way).
- I'm sorry but I had to skip it after the first chorus, it was extremely boring to me.

Stay
- No
- I like the chorus though. Very cute and ""having fun at a theme park"" vibes.
- This is something I would not listen to again

My Way
- This sounds deep.
- Unlike Stay i prefer the verses/bridge to the chorus but i still like the song overall.
- It sounds like something that would have made me both hopeful and depressed as a teenager.

**- TREASURE EP. 2: Zero to One -**

HALA-HALA
- W H A T
- This got me hyped enough for the next 60 years. I want/need to hear this live.
- DEEP IN MY HEART DEEP IN MY SOUL
- Once again this feels very scenarized (?) and I feel like I'm on a mission doing something i shouldn't
- THE ENDING ????? MARVELOUS. DELICIOUS.

Say My Name
- Once again confused, why are we riding horses in a post-apocalyptic countryside.
- Pre-chorus got me feeling some kind of way (positive).
- What is the chorus. W H A T n°2.
- Deep voice rapper is going HARD on this one. - I wish I could comment on the vocalists but I'm not sure I can distinguish them all other than ""couldn't nobody else"" dude.
- THE ENDING??? WHAT'S WITH THEIR ENDINGS???

Desire
- Oh? Unexpected. I feel like I'm intruding.
- Chorus makes me feel like I should close my eyes and apologize.
- The fact that the only lyrics I understand are ""I just can't help it myself // selfish // my heart is beating so fast"" is making me very concerned
- The ending. I feel like I'm going to repeat myself a lot. Is this just how they do things ? Lace the ending with cocaine ?

Light
- Wtf is going oooon 😭 why are we drinking coffee and eating cupcakes now 😭
- I like that it's easier to distinguish their voices in this song.
- I do believe i have feelings for ""let me get in"" dude now though. and cupcake velvety voice too (i'm so sorry i don't know who's who and i'm losing my mind, he sings right before the chorus). 

Promise
- That would be my second no.
- Just like Stay I absolutely do not feel like ripping my ears off but I also do not feel like listening to it again after.
- I believe cupcake velvety voice is the first one who sings the second chorus and I really need a name.

**- TREASURE EP.3: One to All -**

Utopia
- Mixed feelings. I feel like we're back to horseback riding but that we're indeed heading towards that utopia.
- Also once again cupcake velvety man and deep voice rapper have my heart.
- Whoever sings woah in the chorus sounds like he should lead an expedition. I would follow.
- The ending 😞 i'm tired. (in a good way)

Illusion
- Confused! (I feel like I'm going to be confused very often while doing this)
- It's very cute. The chorus makes me so happy I feel like I shouldn't listen to this in public.
- I want this song tattooed in my brain.
- No really I usually hate autotune but I love this song so much wtf

Crescent
- ""Open your eyes"" CREEPED ME OUT because I did not expect another intro-like song. I am even more confused now. It's also very short so not much time to understand what's going on.

Wave
- I was about to write ""very pop"" then GONBE (?) blew my mind
- I love the hakuna matata in the chorus and wish this is a sign that this group uses foreign languages other than english in their discography.
- Once more THE ENDING made me feel very nostalgic and almost sad but are we surprised??
- I need to write more about the ending. I feel like it's telling my younger self I'll be okay. This sounds like an album made to cheer people up.

Aurora
- The intro sounds like an ad for pillows i'm so sorry
- Once again this feels very vulnerable (?). I don't feel like I'm intruding though. It just sounds like a lot of love and an urgent need for a hug. 
- I did not like the adlibs during the last chorus :(

Dancing Like Butterfly Wings
- Boysband™.
- Unexpected chorus. I want to see this live too. 
- Feels very generic and personal at the same time. 
- The bridge and last chorus make me feel like they're about to end it all. I mean i know their discography continues after that but it sounds like a goodbye song. 

**- TREASURE EP.EPILOGUE: Action to Answer -**

Answer
- HOLY SHIT 
- I try to write as i listen to the song but i don't even know what to write. Why does it sound so sad and heroic? I feel like they're paying respects to someone who died during whatever criminal activity is going on. 
- Also once again very distinguishable voices and whoever says ooooh during the chorus please marry me
- The ending 🙁 what's the scenario who died plz let me know

Horizon 
- I swear this group has twenty five producers fighting in a room what is going on
- OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH (chorus)
- I am now following them on Spotify
- Give me cupcake velvety man's number. And whoever made this song, I need their number too
- Also I LOVE THEIR VOICES
- The ending. 😢

Star1117
- Why does this album sound so melancholic? Did some tragedy happen to them? 
- Tiny voices after first chorus sound beautiful. 
- Also need lukewarm honey deep voice man's number. (i, once again, apologize for the nicknames.)

Precious
- Oh shit so this is the song where an entity appears and kills someone?
- The chorus? Very unexpected.
- This gives me the same vibes as Desire but in a different color. Desire feels like a sexy obsession and precious feels like an unhealthy obsession.
- Do I even need to keep writing about the endings? But yeah Precious makes me feel like they're willing to do anything to get whatever's the precious TREASURE????????

IS THEIR ENTIRE DISCOGRAPHY A LOOP????


EDIT:
it occurred to me right before posting this that i had skipped an entire album. Here it is: 

**- TREASURE EP.FIN: All to Action -**

End of the beginning
- Dang (positive)
- I have no words, literally

Wonderland
- Why am i getting yelled at
- Why do i feel like i joined a rebel army
We must going on made me pause the song for a second. I really wish someone would have corrected them because it was said with so much passion that it deserved to be grammatically correct.
- Ok so we're a rebel pirate army? Hence the-
- DEEP VOICE RAPPER MAN OH MY
- The fact that this is right before the melancholy album tells me someone died during the fight
- The ending... I'm losing my mind... Where are we going...

Dazzling Light
- The intro just started and I'm already in love
- I somehow knew this was a existential crisis song before the chorus. Is the treasure their real selves? This sounds like they're lost (not physically)
- Also lukewarm honey deep voice man!

Mist
- Self hatred? Doubt?
- THE CHORUS LET ME BREATHE WTF ARE THEY OKAY?
- The despair? The pain? The lingering hope?
- THE ENDING????

I had to stop for a few minutes after listening to Mist. Genuinely, are they okay? 

Precious (Ouverture)
- Once again feels like I'm stepping into dangerous territory and seeing things I shouldn't know about
- They said treasure, pleasure and crazy at the end so I guess the treasure is not their real selves? Can someone lose their mind while looking for they really are?

Win
- Whiplash. Why are we at the club. 
- I'm starting to feel like this is not a club.
- Ok this is not a club.
- Okay l am terribly sorry but I hate the chorus
- Someone has a very cute voice but the song is so fast pace that i can't remember when i heard it
- Overall this is my third no because I don't understand what's going on. Ending included, sadly. 

If Without You
- Very cute beginning.
- Sunday afternoon vibes rather than coffee shop vibes. Makes me want to take a nap.
- I expected softer rap but I really like it.
- This song is literally :DDD if it were a sound

THANK U
- No longer surprised because I feel like there are more horse riding songs than what I expected?
- I LOVE the chorus. Overall-
- THE ONE AFTER THE FIRST CHORUS SOUNDS SO CUTE WTF
- Overall I feel like their songs are very personal, much more than what I expected. Don't judge me but I thought kpop was just ""oh yeah baby red signals you're tempting me so bad"" as the only kpop songs i've ever heard were very cringy.

Sunrise
- They're gonna make me cry fr
- No comment. I managed not to shed a tear. But no comment. Once again are they okay.

WITH U
- Sounds like cuddles.
- Having cupcake velvety man's number is not enough I need his hand in marriage.
- They have really sweet voices.
- Lukewarm honey man as the ending is beautiful. 

Beginning of the end
- Please stop telling me to open my eyes
- I feel like I'm on a mission
- This a very piratey discography though.


**- THE END -**

I wasn't supposed to listen to their entire discography in one day but I think I'm going to. Please recommend live shows in the comments so I can watch them after I'm done.",48,1743361242.0,ATEEZ,15,0.94,False
1jnjqcf,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jnjqcf/just_for_future_lessons_was_i_in_the_wrong_here/,"Just for future lessons, was I in the wrong here or should I not be too hard on myself","Between January and February this year I (M37) was actively texting a woman (F28) I met on Bumble and who resides in the same city as I. It was a great deal of banter back and forth, and she would send me videos and pictures of herself and the scenery as she was on holiday in Asia and I was doing the same as I went on holiday too. Every two days we would text each other and rather flirtatious. There was one point that we wanted to meet before we went on holiday but she got sick and then we did not hear from each other for a week until I touched base with her again and we got back to texting nearly every day as were on holiday.

On her dating profile she indicated she was looking for ""fun casual dates / long term relationship"".

When we both returned from holiday we set up a date. It was just before Ramadan which began on a Sunday and actually ended today, So, in light of this, I asked her if she wanted to meet on a Thursday and Friday. We met on both days, which culminated in dinner, coffee and even going to the spa by booking a private spa room (which she was open to as well). While we were there, we vibed and got sexual but no penetration. Afterwards we had dinner and then went to the arcades. Generally we vibed well and had a similar outlook on some topics and she told me how different I was in real life as compared to online from a positive standpoint. We do differ though in the sense that she was in a long term relationship with another man for 7 years but had an ""open relationship"" where she slept with 5 other men during that time. Nonetheless, I was respectful of this and I did not judge her at all. In terms of her character, she describes herself as ""introverted extrovert"" and is able to spend time alone quite comfortably and does not enjoy a strong relationship to her parents and was rebellious in her teen years as she did not fit the profile of how her parents were hoping she would turn out to be (although I must say she is educated and smart).

On our first date, I told her that soon Ramadan would begin and I would be very busy for the next 4 weeks with fasting and that I usually do not go out in the evenings as I am breaking my fast and spending time with family. I mentioned that to her so she does not misunderstand my intentions and think I am not interested if we do not see each other in this period. She was very understanding of this and appreciated me telling her this in advance. I told her we can still keep the contact and even break a fast together at some stage and she was open to that. So, after our second date, I dropped her off home and gave each other a kiss and that was it for the night.

One week passes by and then I send her a text asking her how she is doing and share a picture of the dinner table at my familys home to show her how we break the fast, like a part of my culture. I see one tick on Telegram, which means it is delivered but she has deliberately not opened the message. Its been 3 weeks and she still has not replied. I still see one tick by my text, which means it is delivered but she has not opened the message. Normally she would be much more responsive. I know for a fact she was active on the app because she changed her profile picture after I texted her.

Now, despite the fact that during my initial conversations with her I told her I am the kind who always respected open and honest communication and that being disinterested is okay as long as it is communicated respectfully, I genuinely felt she understood that. This makes me the all the more surprised at her behaviour. In fact, as we got to know each other on our first date, I explicitly told her that I I am not a fan of ghosting or blocking someone but always appreciated transparent communication. She even told me at one point how she is the type who does not like having arguments with people but will communicate in some way when she no longer wants to meet someone.

Even though Ramadan ended today, I will not double text and do anymore chasing but my text to her was just to keep some momentum and the conversation going while I also focus on the month of fasting. I understand that fun casual dates are just that, but would a woman not have a bit more empathy towards a man who made a real genuine effort over two dates (it was really well thought out in terms of the dinner place and the wellness box was expensive) and considering the fact I explicitly told her how I hate ghosting?

#2 traditional medicinals spearmint tea, this is very high priority to drink health wise. Spearmint has lots of health benefits, particularly in hormone and digestive health. 

#3 traditional medicinals peppermint tea, great for anxiety and stomachaches


Stay tuned for more as I keep trying out teas!!!:) these are just my top three that make me feel good. I’ve tried a few others from the Tazo brand that have been ok, but not my favorite. As well as raspberry tea from harney and sons is good, but it really needs sugar in my opinion to taste great and I don’t drink my teas with sugar soooo not super into it.

2. Add coffee and create little well
3. Bloom 60g water for ~1min
4. 120g water at ~1min mark + small swirl
5. 270g water at ~2min mark + few swirls

Total time was about 5.5min to completely drain, the grounds remained flat throughout. 

Taste was a bit acidic bordering bitter, missing sweetness. Wife was not a fan and added 50% water to dilute and liked it. 

We just got back from Japan, and the mameya shop people suggested 40/40/40 pour so I was going to try that tomorrow. 

Any fixes of the top of this setup? Just watched a few TikTok's and the Hoffman guy. We had the kettle from before and I bought origami on our Japan trip. Bought the ode2 based on review. 

Used grind size 4.5ish yesterday and today did 5. Yesterday was a bit better but total was 10min.

To use an analogy, I like having the ability to buy a single cup of coffee or a single drink while I'm out - so having something similar with weed should be the standard. When I smoke, I don't want to green out - I want one session to have the same intensity as, at most, a couple cups of coffee or a couple drinks. If I want to do that with the standard weed where I live, I need to take a tiny pea-sized hit.

Anyways, I had the most pleasant experience in Ballard where I bought a very low-THC joint for $3 (a price that's totally unheard of where I live, as the lowest price for a preroll is about $10), and enjoyed my mild high. It was awesome and exactly what I wanted.

I'm not sure if what I'm experiencing a likely a migraine? 

I've never been someone who experiences headaches or migraines. In fact I don't think I've even had a real one of either. Yesterday afternoon I randomly started getting a dull pain around my upper sides of my neck and what feels like internally at the back of my head. 

I had already had my standard morning cup of coffee, but thought perhaps I didn't drink enough water, so started drinking more throughout the rest of the day. As the night went on, the pain became worse. Not totally unbearable, but definitely not comfortable, and making it hard to focus on anything other than the pain.

I was able to takes naps, and fall asleep at night (with the assistance of alternating Advil and Tylenol), but am still experiencing symptoms today.

I'm hoping it's just something I can wait out, but always have concern in the back of my mind when having head related issues, as I do have a siezure disorder, and I get a bit paranoid about the potential of something worse happening.

Any advice is welcome, as this is new to me, and I'm trying to hold off on going into urgent care if possible due to expenses.",1,1743360512.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

My problem is I don’t really know how to approach people and start a conversation. I have never really had to do that, people usually found me. 

If I feel comfortable, I can make small talk, but my problem is that I don’t know how to  approach people to even get to the small talk. And also, big groups scare me lol.

I work in an open-space office, and people usually talk the whole day, but I am in the half of the office where there are not a lot of people, and they don’t talk. So I feel like I can’t speak to them that way.
Then there are coffee breaks. A few of them go every day around noon to the coffee break, but they never invite anyone, they just go one by one. I feel like they have a group chat or something. 
Then the other group also does coffee breaks  in the office conference room on the safe floor. I could probably join them, but they are mostly men and older than me by a few years, so I feel kind of intimidated to just go join them. I don’t know if I would have something to talk to them.

There is also a lunch break, but the kitchen is small, and there are a lot of us. I would feel too on the spot with all the other people having a group. 

I just want to know what someone who loves to hang out with people would do. How would they act and make situations for themselves where people would talk to them? I don’t want to force myself on someone or seem desperate.",1,1743360278.0,work,0,1.0,False

1jnjbv7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1jnjbv7/dating_a_34_man_financially_unstable/,Dating a 34 man financially unstable,"38 female met a 34 years old man online in February  
We talked, he was very respectful with his words and sweet. I live in LA and avoid dating people from the entertainment business as I am part of it so I want someone with a more steady job. The same day, we exchanged social media, send voice messages to each other and he starts telling me he loves movies (his bedroom is full of DVDs) and moved here to be part of the industry somewhat which turned me off at that point but I decided to still see,just in case as he seemed sweet. He also had a job he didn't really like and was trying to switch.                                                                                                                                                   We met the next day, he took me out to dinner and we had a great date that ended in a kiss. Now, I was not too attracted to the fact that he drove a truck. Maybe superficial for some but I am not. A regular car looks way better.. Anyways, for both of us communication is important but after a day or 2, receiving 7 minutes messages 5 times a day every day became too much to handle. I m extremely busy and my work is stressful enough so I don't have the time to listen to all this so my messages became shorter and shorter as days passed. Between the 1st and second date, I learned he had roommates. I got stressed out with something and he was very supportive, one of the qualities that I love about him.  
We saw each other a second time, we had a great time again. I asked him questions about his life, if he had debts, he says he has bills, he never went to college and has been working since 17. He also has 5 credit cards. At my age, I m looking for a husband and start a family. I have no debt and pay my only credit card full balance each month. I m not well off but I have savings. He also said he had ADD and OCD. I heard ADHD and OCD , which I know the latter but barely the former. He takes me back home at 2 am and at like 2.15, I get a phone call. His truck that he paid 42 000$ (crazy in my opinion for a used car) 3 years ago and is still paying loans for and costs him tons on gas (his words), got stuck. He tells me he gotta call AAA, have his truck sent to the dealership, says that it's gonna cost him 50 dollars to get back home with an Uber, which I get it, it is expensive so I offer him to come to my place. So he stayed for the night. He was very sweet, didn't pressure me to have sex or anything. His phone was dead and I have an Android while he has an iphone 15 pro and I didn't know my charger could work so I told him I don’t have an iphone charger. In the morning, he realized he can use my charger and his mom call him, screaming I think, I could not hear but he tells her to calm down…. I learned later that they speak 3 to 5 times a day , way too much in my opinion and other people too.  
He leaves to go to the dealership and they tell him it is gonna cost him max 12 000 dollars. So I asked him if he had the money, he said that he can't pay full amount right away, which I obviously understand but since I m looking for someone financially stable, I m digging deeper and ask if he was paying it all right away, would that make him in financial difficulties which he didn't really say yes or no but he said he won't be able to pay everything he has to.  
At that point, I realized that this man is not stable financially and is also irresponsible. I learned that if his truck was not repairable, he would never buy a regular car although way cheaper but another truck , that despite working since 17, living at his parents till he was 33 without paying rent, he never saved any money. He had several different jobs he quit and doesn't want to work in an office. He doesn't pay his credit cards in full, just the minimum for some. He loves to drive so uses his truck a lot so tons of gas, buy 2 coffee a day at 5 dollars each, eat out every day and unhealthy food in my opinion (hamburger, fries, pasta, gnocchi). One night , he went to the grocery store and told me he bought pizza, taquitos, chips.... I asked about vegetables and fruits and if he can cook at home. He said Cooking for just him is a waste of time. Well, that would certainly cost him less and be healthier. So we actually had an argument about it as I want someone who has healthy eating habits too. He is not fat but he doesn't have abs which is probably going to get worse.  
Anyways, on top of that I looked at ADHD and saw terrible things from people partnered with not medicated one which seem to be how he is : very  focus on me, talks a lot, can't hold a job, financially irresponsible and as time goes by they can become abusive.  
I see him a 3rd time , at that point I m over it. I don't kiss him. We go for a drive and food but never get to the food place. I am cold and detached and we start talking but I realize I better not say anything until we stop as I dont know what this guy can do and believe me I got scared in his rental truck, his driving scared me and I told him to take me close to home. We arrive and i decide to tell him that we can t keep on going. I talk about financial stability, and my findings about ADHD. He says he never said ADHD but ADD and that is an expression in America. I m not American and never heard that expression from an American before and I told him that everything I read symptoms wise are what he portrays. It s 1 am at that point so I invite him to stay. We had a great time. Again very sweet and all.  
Then days pass, he learns that now the cost of repair is gonna be 17 000, and he has to pay 6000 upfront so he had to get a loan for I believe 3000 that he would pay max in 3 years. I told him that it is a long time, plus he is not done paying his truck. He didn't seem too concerned about it. I told him that he should get a second job, make a budget, cut on stuff like 10 dollars for coffee per day , he could get a Machine although he said he drinks ice coffee, and to also cut cigarettes. That same week, he went to the movie theater, i assume it cost 20$ to watch a movie so not responsible in my opinion.  
Yesterday after daily messages for the past 2 weeks without seeing each other as I was busy and he lives an hour away with traffic so limited on time based on his opinion, we were supposed to see each other at 7.  
At 5.30, he calls me and says it is an hour traffic so ask me if I can do 8.30. I tell him I want to be home at 12  because I have work to do even during the weekend. He says there are people in his living room so he didn't had the time to clean because he wanted to be respectful to them , blabla....at the end of the day, we never saw each other as he said LET S DO ANOTHER NIGHT which has happened a few times already. With everything going on in his life, and his lifestyle, I think last night was the last straw so i don't think I should keep on going.

2 people told me to leave him, one called him a loser, mind you, she is 70.

Since we’re not too far from each other I see my parents usually around once a month. This is usually for holidays or when they just want to see me. Here’s the kicker though. They are always so mean to me when I’m home and my time there is almost always dreadful. They always find something to attack me about or try to pick apart my life. 

It’s like every aspect of my life has an issue within it some way or another that they HAVE to comment negatively on. Most of the time I just ignore it but it’s become so overwhelming that I can’t stand being around them.

My parents came to pick me up recently because we got tickets a while back to a sporting event close to my hometown, and they brought a small piece of furniture with them for my apartment. Upon entering my apartment, they already seemed annoyed. Idk if it was the drive or what but my dad was huffing and puffing literally after opening the door (and it’s really not a bad drive, I’ve drove myself both ways many times and it’s quite peaceful). Mind you I’m doing extremely well in college and extracurriculars. My mom instantly started commenting on how messy my apartment was and followed that up by saying she would be getting rid of most of the stuff in the apartment when I graduated (furniture, dishes, etc)

I felt like this came out of absolutely no where and I was extremely uncomfortable. Granted they did give me “hand me down” furniture, but it’s all nice stuff that I could use when I inevitably move out when I get enough money to pay rent on my own. Some of the stuff, like the dishes, I bought myself. It’s not like we don’t have storage space at home, we literally have an empty storage room that they never use. Also, my apartment was hardly a mess… maybe in comparison to there “oh so perfect and spotless” home it was a mess in their eyes. I had like 2 jackets on the living room table, a few dishes in the sink, and some shoes by the door (I live on my own). That was basically the bulk of the “mess” I guess.

I also find it funny bc my mom was telling me that I should be taking a bunch of stuff home so we don’t have to do it all at once… so why the hell would they bring me another piece of furniture (an end table that I had no idea they were bringing me) when I’m moving out in a few months. What’s more, my dad owns a whole box truck that would easily fit everything.

It seems to me this is all apart of their attempt to control my life even though I’m an adult and not their “baby” any more. I’m very educated but they ignore or attack my opinions and even facts that I share (like stuff based on research). Im just so irritated and wish I could have a normal relationship with them, but that doesn’t seem possible. It also makes me very sad that I genuinely don’t want to be around them. I truly do love them and they have done so much for me, but that doesn’t give them the right to control me nor emotionally abuse me. 

I’ve tried confronting them directly about these issues, but that only leads to more arguing (they love tag-teaming me). My mom literally turns into a psycho anytime she’s arguing about anything. Even over the littlest stuff. The last time I was home, I made a coffee and put some sugar in it and she berated me about how I shouldn’t be putting sugar in it. It literally got to the point that she was shouting at me from across the house and doing the talking under the breath thing where you can clearly hear them so they’re just egging you on trying to get a reaction (which I’ve learned to not give them, but this often turns into them attacking me about something else irrelevant to the situation and escalates to threatening to kick me out).

Then this all disappears when I go back to college where they practically beg me to come back home soon. It’s mental warfare… and I’m exhausted. I already have my own life to figure out and I can’t play this game with them anymore.

I’m caught between a rock and a hardplace… and I’m not sure what to do or how to handle all this right now :( 

I’ve been thinking about seeing a counselor for a while now and I’m probably going to pull the trigger soon.

Nespresso pods seemed to be the most recommended so I had a look at their machines and bought a Vertuo Plus.

I'm wondering if I should return it and get something like the Essenza Mini or CitiZ or would the Vertuo Plus be better? Or should I get something different?

just a lingering cough, simply I feel like there's some mucus in my throat which then I try to take air in and intentionally cough to expel it out, it's been almost a year, and it just come and goes , don't if it's post nasal drip, sinusitis or something or any allergic reactions. I even paused  beverages like cold drinks , caffeinated ones like coffee and redbull also. Even changed perfume or stopped using it. Stopped taking cold shower or bathing in the evening. Sometimes it's mild sometimes unbearable .

I strongly believe it is nothing other than post nasal . But sometimes I get acid reflux as well, I hope been drinking more water because of that issue so it might have lead to acid reflux what do you think .

My father died when I was 17,

If I am being honest even if this cough comes and goes it first started in lock down 3 years ago.

Narcissistic, tortured, difficult, negative, densely miserable 9s. Nihilistic 9s. *Proudly* unhealthy 9s? Speak to me. Help me feel I’m not the only one. 

Tell me about your lifelong mental health struggles. Tell me about your self loathing and sense of monstrous deficiency. Tell me about your simmering resentment about who you are and what’s been done to you. Tell me about how your inner world isn’t too empty and foggy (fog always covers something, you find no fog in a vacuum), but too full and sharp and painful because all that stuff has no way *out* due to sloth preventing action or expression. Tell me about how your “positive outlook” can sometimes just mean *ejecting* the positivity for other people’s benefit, leaving its negative image inside of *you*—a positive outlook type who experiences their positivity precisely as negativity. Tell me about feeling trapped inside yourself, like you have all this self to give but there’s a wall stopping you from giving it. Tell me about being withdrawn (so you give up), positive (so you can’t move), and a gut type cut off from the gut (so you have no will). Paralysis, the person: That’s you. Dying but remaining painfully conscious in the corpse: That’s you, too. You are rotting because that’s what corpses do. (But you can ignore that, also, because eventually your nose will rot off and you won’t be able to smell anyway. ✨✨ Positivite! ✨✨✨ Outlook! ✨✨) 

Tell me about the narcissism of 9, the way you secretly believe you’re more important than anyone else and that you don’t have any responsibility to others, because you don’t quite exist in their reality; had you ever really met them? had they ever really met you? (no.); you were always elsewhere, where there is no competition so you are finally the best and the most important, in a place where you can delude yourself into thinking you don’t impact others. The narcissism of nine is: I matter the most by mattering the least. 

By which I mean, tell me everything. I want to revel and roll around in the glory of the dark 9. The flash of insincere teeth on the surface of a black hole. The only type whose false self is thin enough that you occasionally glimpse the abyss behind the question, “Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?”, because unlike for other types, those really are the options. 

All the other types are engines, forward-propulsive; but you are a nuclear reactor core, hot and dense and sweating, storing up energy for someone else’s use. All the other types generally bounce back when insulted or hurt. You just accept the new shape the injury left you in.

I'm sure other types all have their own horror shows, their own things they suffer the worst at, but don't use that to minimize yours. On some level, you know this stuff is there. So talk about it. Tell me about your pain and darkness. Because I can't be the only person seeing this. ",6,1743359750.0,Enneagram,10,1.0,False

I'm considering moving to these countries and I already thought about the pros and cons and the way the get in to each country, would like to see some other opinions, and if i successfully move out, i would either making coffee or making videos if im not working for myself

info of me: 25, just graduated from college, major in Business and Administration, a jack of all trade type of guy,

**work experience include**

* barista(im the president of the coffee club),
* video shooting & editing(for a channel over 100k),
* 2d and 3d animation(freelance, over 10kUSD)
* indie game dev team that successfully launched on steam and had a great sell,

right now im in a process of making a website solving a problem in fitness community and promoting on social media, also im a certified personal trainer.

Language wise English conversation is totally not a problem, Chinese native speaker and fluent in Hokkien

**Pros of living in Taiwan**

* EXTREMEMLY SAFE, like u can leave your phone on the table and no one gives a shit, late night walk is the same, mostly safe, lots of cctv as well unless you're being fked by cops
* i dont need to pay taxes for my capital gains in US Stock
* Public transportation is so good, i literally dont need a car
* Japan is 4 hours away

Cons:

* Pathetic salary and extremely high housing price
   * (we ear the same as the time our parents graduated if not less, yet housing price is 5\~10x, also working hours is like 8\~9 / day min)
* Reckless driving EVERYWHERE
* Don't resonate with Taiwanese girl much, past dating experience are all from other countries
* Smoking rate
* Weather is too hot, over 35C even 40 during summer is insane
* Health care is collapsing
* Earthquake

**My top tier of choice is Australia and New Zealand**

Pros:

* Labor shortage
* i have friends living in both country can help or share room
* higher hourly salary,
* less air pollution than Taiwan
* Koala and kiwi and sheep
* Safer if anything unfortunate happened

Cons:

* Australia might roll out more lon immigrants
* Australian Teenager(read about the rise of teenage crime lately)
* Aussie accent is a bit hard to catch up lol
* New Zealand has earthquake and i REALLY REALLY trying to avoid this at all cost
* Black widow

Way to get in:

Working holiday visa, trying to see if there's any chance i can do video shooting or branding for local shops, the worst case scenario is im back to the old business making espresso

second one is if my website and social media turns our extremely well i might just fly there and claim to work remotely since New Zealand allow it, but can't get in the process of becoming a PR unless i rizz up a local girl

**My B tier choice is US, UK and Canada**

Pros:

* They dont smoke that much too (not sure about UK)
* The society def familiar with a weird guy doing video shooting or creating content for ppl or for himself, so thats what i can do
* Lots of opportunity for start up and VC in the US, now is def the time for small start up
* Less micro aggression than EU
* Familiar with the culture esp US

Cons:

* terrible economics right now
* very high cost of living
* I need a car for everything unless it's UK, non walkable city sucks
* UK teens (again saw some news and more ppl talking about teenage crime lately)

Way to get in :

other than Canada which i can use working holiday visa and do either coffee or making videos then later on apply for PR, I really dont know when it comes to US and UK

**My C tier choice is the Netherlands**

Pros:

* English is widely spoken
* better salary to housing price ratio(ik it sounds insane but it is, to a Taiwanese)
* Great public transportation
* almost guarantee can get a visa since every year they can't find enough ppl
* im 6'1 so i dont have to tolerate furniture made for fun sized ppl

Cons:

* Might face microaggression and racism more,
* I dont speak Dutch
* Smoking rate is def higher
* Housing crisis
* im not familar with anything related to this country

Way to get in :

again working holiday visa, but info are lacking when it come to becoming a PR using this way

would like to see the opinion from you guys, thanks,

Lately, I have felt that things have been somewhat okay. Whenever I feel myself go to the dark place, I just push it down. 

The darkness drags its nails up my throat, scraping my insides, coiling around my tongue.  It floods my eyes, thick and unrelenting. 

I guess we should talk about it. It’s begging to be heard.

It’s difficult to accept where I am right now. I remember the feeling of getting out. Growing up, I swore to get out. 

But things didn’t work out. Not the way I dreamed.

I am stuck again. I am 16 again.

My world is small. 
My world is four walls and an angry man.
My world is devoid of hopes of a better tomorrow.

I can’t escape the familiarity of the air. It is dense, heavy with old anger. 
I breathe it in, and I am 16 again.

I can’t seem to look past these four walls. I can’t find my way out. God knows I am trying. I feel emotionally detached because I don’t want to accept this world.

I can’t help but feel like the world owes me something. I try to take what’s rightfully mine, but I’ve come to understand that I am not worthy.

I feel romantically detached, and I can’t decide if love has never fit me or if I was never meant to wear it. 
I look around me at the tables of others. They are filled with the most delicious offerings, but when I stare at my own, I am met with nothingness.

I watch myself from a distance, detached and drifting. My skin is ill-fitting. I dream to wake up in something that feels like mine. 
This body is just a thing I wear, and God, I hope I can take it off. 

I don’t have any control, and I am forced to watch my life unravel.

1jnj38k,https://i.redd.it/n9aq5t21fvre1.jpeg,Happy lil March wrap-up!,"After a semi mediocre February, March was a happier reading month! 

12 books total read. With a breakdown off:

2 five ⭐ reads, 3 four ⭐ reads, 4 three ⭐ reads, 3 two ⭐ reads and no 1 ⭐ reads. 

Some standout comments/thoughts: 

{Water Moon by Samantha Sotto Yambao} I adored this book so much. I had really high hopes for it and it met all of them. It's like reading a Studio Ghibli film. From a magical pawn shop behind the door of a ramen restaurant, to cities that hang stars, to a memory of a room, this book takes you on a winding and delightful journey that makes you want to just keep reading. If you want semi cozy and philosophical then this a great read and one I can't recommend enough. 

{Our Infinite Fates by Laura Steven} This one hit me like a train and I did not expect to rate it so highly. I loved the romance and how it was built in flash backs of these snippets of their previous lives. I loved how compassionate of a FMC Evelyn is. The quote ""I love you, I have loved you and I will love you."" Is gonna forever stick with me. For anyone who wants a bit of tragedy with their HEA, this book is perfect. 

{The Starlight Heir by Amalie Howard} This was a big let down. I got suckered in by the nice cover and liking the thought of a humble blacksmith who may have special powers falling for the illegitimate prince. What I got was a modernised vocabulary mess with a magic system that left the FMC far to overpowered and boring to read. If you want a book set in a fantasy land using carriages and magic portals but with phrases like ""Thick thighs save lives"" ""egg-donor"" and ""prince-splaining"" then this books for you! Also right up your alley if you love insta lust/insta love and reading a book with the pacing of an off the rails train. 

{The Half King by Melissa Landers} A resoundingly disappointing read. The premise is fantastic but the execution is shoddy as all hell. The book is all tell and no show and completely skips over things that could have been interesting and brought the world to life. So much happens off page and gets skipped through but then we are forced to read endless pages of travel that amounts to nothing. And because so much happens of page, the romance is super unbelievable as most of the build up doesn't happen where we can see it. So it leaves a super unsatisfactory climax when they get together. 

{Six Crimson Cranes by Elizabeth Lim} Was very middle of the road. It was quite predictable a story but it was still an enjoyable read.  The pacing was a bit sporadic, to quick in some parts and to slow in others which did work for the book but it did give way to lack of good descriptions and the world not being quite as fleshed out as I would have liked. I appreciated the familial bonds though and Shiori was an FMC who did actually grow through the book which I appreciated. 

Here's to hoping for some more good reads in April. ",7,1743359556.0,fantasyromance,2,0.82,False

Tl;Dr  what level of interest is there in a platform where we can all sharing roasting & brewing details in a structured way so we can more quickly learn from each other?


I just got into this hobby (on the back of my unrelenting coffee addiction).  I’m exactly the right kind of nerd to obsess over something like this.

One of the first things I did was hobble together my own little app (really just a google sheets front end) to track my beans, roast, brews, etc. with notes, 1st crack timing, etc.  it’s worked really well but I wish I could see the same data and notes from others.

The classic use case would be:  let’s say I buy some beans from Sweet Maria’s.  I could go in and see how everyone else is roasting it, their notes, whether they find it benefits from more development, or other variables?

Just a thought.  It looks like there are other apps out there but none that quite do what I’m looking for.

So here’s the deal—I live with my parents, and my mom? We’ve been butting heads since I was old enough to have opinions. She’s one of those “I’m always right, no discussion, my way or the highway” types. And my dad? He mostly stays out of it unless things start getting a little too loud. She’s hot and cold—one minute, she’s offering you food like an Italian grandmother, the next, she’s letting you know exactly how you’ve disappointed her since birth. And apologies? Therapy? Ha! You’ve got a better chance of winning the lottery without buying a ticket.

Now, I used to be scared of standing up to her when I was younger, but at this point? I don’t even flinch. If she comes at me sideways, I let her know real quick. Most of the time, I just ignore it and keep it moving, but today? Today was different.

I’ve been trying to lose weight, right? So I’ve been cutting down on a lot of my mom’s cooking—not because it’s bad, but because her portions? Let’s just say she cooks like we’re about to hibernate for six months. I even offer to cook instead, but no, no, I “don’t do things the right way.” Fine. So I meal prep, take smaller portions, mind my business.

Now, my niece—my little partner in crime—comes over for the weekend. She’s 12, full of personality, and honestly? She’s got more talent in her pinky than half the people I know. We’re hanging out, she wants McDonald’s, so I take her. Kid wants nuggets she get nuggets.  No big deal. I grab her nuggets, get myself a little something, pick up my mom’s coffee, and check in with my dad. He doesn’t want anything. Cool, all set.

We get back, start putting the food down, and outta nowhere, my mom hits me with:

“You’re gonna eat all that? You’re getting fat! I don’t want to hear you complain about my food! You can’t gain any more weight!”

In front of my niece. Threw it in the there like it was a casual comment, no hesitation and no filter. 

Now, I don’t even blink. Just look at her and say, “See? This is exactly why you’re never getting grandkids from me.”

Fireworks.

We go back and forth, my dad steps in, we finally sit down to eat. My niece, being the smart girl she is, keeps quiet and finishes her nuggets. Then she heads to my room to play Roblox, and I think, Alright, it’s over. We’re done.

Nope.

As soon as my niece is out of sight, my mom starts up again. “See! She didn’t even finish her food! You made her waste all that money!”

What? What are we even talking about right now? My niece always eats a spicy McChicken and her nuggets. If she didn’t finish, maybe—just maybe—it had something to do with the lovely little comment she heard earlier. So I tell her straight up, “She probably lost her appetite because of what you said.”

And my mom? She doesn’t miss a beat. “Yeah, but that was directed at YOU, not her.”

Like words don’t carry. Like she didn’t just drop a grenade in the middle of dinner. So I tell her, “You can’t say stuff like that in front of kids. Words have power.” But she keeps playing dumb. “But I said it to YOU, not HER.”

I try to break it down simple: “Doesn’t matter. You don’t say stuff like that at the dinner table, in front of a kid, right before we eat. If it bothered you so much, you could’ve pulled me aside. But you didn’t.”

And then she pulls out the classic: “Well, YOU say things that embarrass ME in public all the time!”

And I hit her right back: “Maybe, but that doesn’t mean you get to act like this, especially in front of my niece. If you need therapy, I’ll take you myself, but this? This has to stop.”

And then—then!—she hits me with, “You don’t know my problems.”

Oh? Oh really? You’re a stay-at-home, no job, no bills. What’s stressing you out, the Wi-Fi speed? The fact that the laundry machine isn’t folding the clothes for you? If she needed help around the house, she could just ask, but no—she’d rather go full WWE promo on me at the dinner table.

And the worst part? I get emotional when I argue. Hate it. Absolutely hate it. Because when I start tearing up, she gets that boomer smirk—like she just won something. Like this was a competition. And by that point, it’s over. My dad steps in, tells everyone to cool it, and I just let it go.

But you know what saved my night? My niece.

After dinner, I go to my room, and she’s sitting there, cool as ever, playing her game. She looks up and goes, “Tía, wanna do your nails?”

And listen—this little girl is talented. I’m talking steady hands, clean lines, like she’s been doing this for years. She pulls out her kit, picks out colors, and gets to work like she’s in a high-end salon. By the time she’s done, my nails look amazing. Like, better than some places I’ve actually paid for.

And that’s when it hit me—this girl? She’s absorbing everything. The good, the bad, the crazy dinner table arguments. And that’s exactly why I have to keep myself in check, make sure she knows that just because someone acts a certain way doesn’t mean you gotta take it.

At the end of the day, I know what’s what. My dad is converting half the house into a little studio apartment for me, so I’m not going anywhere anytime soon. And honestly, I’ve learned to just graywall my mom’s nonsense, tune it out, because deep down, I know she cares—she just doesn’t know how to care the right way. She never had a great mother herself, and I get that.

But what really gets me? When her poison splashes onto my niece. That’s where I draw the line. I’ll take the hits, but I don’t want my niece carrying that kind of weight around.

I don’t even know what I was trying to get at with this rant—maybe I just needed to get it out so I could enjoy my Sunday. But I do feel better. And if you made it this far, thanks for reading.",4,1743359474.0,rant,1,1.0,False

My husband and I (both early 30s) are moving to Atlanta from New England and trying to figure out the right neighborhood balance. We’re considering buying a house right off the bat if we feel confident we can get the neighborhood right, but if we’re not feeling confident, we’ll rent. Would prefer to buy tho if we can make it work!

Seems like Morningside/VaHi is best aligned with our lifestyle preferences but it’s definitely pricier and has a longer commute to our workplaces.

We’re also considering south Buckhead areas like Collier Hills and Peachtree Hills for the better commute, and they seem like nice areas although more suburban than we’d prefer.


Key considerations:
- Would love to be able to walk to coffee shops, parks, and nearby restaurants like we can in our current New England location
- Would like an area with a good sense of community
- Both commuting to The Battery area (but only going in 3 days/week)
- Thinking about having kids in a few years
- Want to find the right balance of an area we’d like with a reasonable commute
- looking for a single family home, 2000-2500 sq ft range, budget of 1M


Questions:
	1.	Do Morningside/VaHi/Ansley Park have too brutal a commute to The Battery to be worth it?
	2.	Are the South Buckhead areas (Collier Hills, Peachtree Hills) still walkable to some amenities? What’s the vibe here?
	3.	Any other neighborhoods we should consider that might give us the walkability we want with a better commute?

i don’t mind being by myself when i’m out, but i feel like people look at me funny/weird for being alone. i don’t have anyone to watch my son, so i can only go to the gym on my husband’s days off. which i feel guilty about but i think i do need a break from the two of them sometimes.

I used to struggle balancing work, errands, and even just eating a healthy lunch (pizza doesn't count, right?). But a few months ago, I stumbled upon a game-changer: the epic showdown between Daily Rituals and Time Blocking. Spoiler alert: this combo saved me 10 hours a week! Wanna know how?

Let's rewind a bit. Picture me, frantically jumping from task to task, constantly spilling coffee on my planner, and wondering why time seemed to evaporate faster than my weekend plans. Sound familiar? 😅 Here’s what turned things around:

**1. Get Ritualistic:**  
Daily routines are like that cozy blanket on a cold day. They’re comforting and kinda magical. Every morning, I now kickstart my day with a ritual:  
- 10 mins of mindfulness or meditation (more like daydreaming, but hey, it works).  
- A quick stretch, because my back isn’t getting any younger.  
- The ritual caffeine fix – but with a twist! I actually **enjoy** my coffee, not chug it while typing furiously.  

**2. Time Blocking is Your BFF:**  
Think of time blocking as your trusty sidekick, giving structure to chaos. Here’s how it helped me reclaim my hours:  
- **Chunk similar tasks together.** Answer emails from 9-10 am, no more hopping back and forth all day.  
- **Dedicated creative time.** For me, it's writing. The world (aka my phone) is on Do Not Disturb.  
- Set a timer – seriously. It’s amazing how much more productive you can be with a ticking clock. Also, deadlines = motivation, who knew? 🤔  

**3. Embrace Flexibility:**  
Okay, reality check. Sometimes life happens and you just gotta roll with it. The trick is to deviate without derailing. If my planned tasks go sideways, it's not the end of the world, just a plot twist! 😊  

So, there you have it. By mixing up daily rituals and time blocking, I managed to shave off a solid 10 hours of what felt like sheer chaos. The extra hours aren’t just time; they’re a chance to do more of what I love, guilt-free Netflix binges included! 🎉  

Ever tried blending these two magical forces in your life? If you have, how did it go? If not, why not give it a whirl? Who knows, you might just find those missing hours too. 😉",1,1743359123.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

I just found out who my dad is through our government archive. The reason I only recently looked into all of this is because of issues in my personal life and I hadn't been able to mentally before now. My mom didn't want me to be asking questions about him before I was 18, but even afterwards every question got brushed off or she was in too bad of a mood to talk about it suddenly. I found out, I have a younger half brother (13~) and -sister (17~) as well. And he's married to someone now. Through the archive I have his new adress as well. My question is how do I tackle this and what do I do. 

I have many conflicted feelings and opinions on how to do it. In some way I resent My father for never reaching out (Context I have a very unique name and am very easy to find, and he does know my full name.) But on the other hand I always wanted to have a dad. Growing up I was super jealous all my other friends had a father figure. My mom had a short temper and would often handle things with alternative solutions, (she suffered a bad childhood and it still affects her widely to this day.) And at the end of the day I never had anyone to side with me or take my defense. But on the other hand I also want to meet him and try to give him a chance to make up for all the lost time. But mostly I want to meet my siblings. I want to know how their life is. It has always been at the back of my mind that maybe im not an only child. And now I know I'm not. It was initially a lot of information to take in. And I'm not sure I have fully recovered.

My close friends have had plenty of different suggestions but I don't know which to take.
My girlfriend has been telling me to take it slow, text him try to connect with him slowly and build up a relationship with him first. 
One of my best friends told me to just show up at his front door. Hope it's him that answers but if not him just say I'm looking for (full name) and then take him for coffee and catch out.

Everything began when I drank some coffee and by a passing whim decided to open the Ethics of Spinoza by Bruno Gulliani, I opened the book and chanced on this in the preface : ""The reading of Ethics can, moreover, be compared to the practice of music, poetry, or better yet, vivancial meditation as proposed by JOYA: illumination always arises from a moment of grace. It certainly requires some perseverance to break free from the mental chatter and to unleash the full power of one's intuition, but one day the effort pays off: a whole new state of consciousness emerges. At first, it comes in glimpses, like flashes of light tearing through the night of ignorance, gradually growing stronger, like a permanent sun that one discovers with infinite amazement to have always been there. Suddenly, the meaning of Life becomes obvious, immanent to oneself. Suddenly, one starts seeing the world, understanding people, feeling the enthusiasm of living and marveling at everything that exists. The infinite living beauty of the world then appears in all its magnificence. On the surface, nothing seems to change in our perception of the world, but in reality, nothing is the same as before. Everyday life becomes marvelously simple, harmonious, and clear. When one experiences the non-duality of being, the famous ""You are That,"" it becomes evident that everything is divine. The mind then undergoes a true inner transmutation. Consciousness takes a ""leap"" beyond ordinary thought, which is so partial, slow, and uncertain. The ego dissolves. The self asserts itself. The veil lifts. True spiritual Joy appears. The sacred shines. The divine reveals itself. One then feels totally free and creative, without any free will.""

I had an intense longing for this state and went to sleep.

My heart beat because of coffee and I slept but something completely unexpected happen, I felt sleep, I had gone into slumber but I was still awake literally, my thought bounced slowly but I completely fell asleep

I thought ""What? I am really asleep, this can't be but I felt the body-mind alseep.""

After a while I woke up and the first thing I noticed is I felt as I had felt before on lsd, which is a weird feeling of feeling everything in the body, a deep feeling of meditation where I was lightheaded, where I felt every breath and heartbeat

My thought bounced confused, absolutely confused, not knowing what was happening.

I saw but I felt I was what I was seeing.

I felt weird so decided to go the garden, in the way I met the maid in the house and in that instant, I had a feeling of not being me and being her, as if I was not myself but was seeing myself and her interact

I hurriedly left to the garden and the dog barked.

At first I felt deep fear but then I relaxed.

And the barking no longer felt as if it was barking, it felt like nothing at all, like the barking was me, all sounds that appeared blended.

And at that time, I had intense realisation, I moved making noises with my flip flops

And as I was noticing, suddenly I could feel every heartbeat, every barking sound, every sound of my flip flops but it was as if itt wasn't there at all

It felt as if nothing was happening at all, as if it was all void

My mind immediately came talking about desires and fears but it was so distant, it came, moved a bit, the ego tried to reinstate itself but it miserably collapsed and all that was left was nothing

I look at things and felt them, not as I am the tree in the way we imagine with concept but I am the seeing of the tree and therefore the tree because the tree was nothing more than a sight and I was that sight so in a way I was that tree, everything, the floor, the objects, I felt them all, not in a ""its me"" or interconnectedness but as nothing but a perception

This feeling of nothingness seemed absolute and nothing could break it

No matter how many thoughts came, they were as if they weren't there at all

The ego was also deeply shocked, I still existed, yes ""I"" the true ""I"" which the ego thought belonged to it still existed

But even this existence, I was shocked, does this even exist? Does not existing count as existence? How can that be? Its so paradoxical, I couldn't believe it

I felt no fear, no feeling of this is bad or feeling of disappointment of it not being a grand thing, it was just peace, not even peace, its just being, yes being is the correct word

I just was and was not at the same time

I wrote this as I was in this state : ""I could see the world as void, not see it but feel it, I walked back and forth twenty times with vacant look in my eyes, there was no thoughts, thought came and went but I was untouched, sounds scared me but by feeling them fully I realised they weren't there

I met people and felt I didn't control myself and I was them and me and what appeared

By looking at a tree, I felt it

When I step on the stairs, I feel I am the sounds""

After a while the desire to play as ego came back and I didn't feel weigh down by it, rather I felt it was beautiful, this motionless consciousness can also be motion and express itself so beautifully

The world appeared to me as divine

Everything was divine, is divine!

Everything was pure, is pure!

That was it but that day, no matter how much I tried, I couldn't get back to the ego, it faded and failed to get a grasp 

But now I can be it and at the same time i feel free of it

I ordered three drinks and after I paid, the male employee told me to move up my car (mind you, the drive through WAS NOT BUSY, there was only one car behind me).

He almost made it look like he didn't want us to see what was going on inside the store. I had to literally reach BACKWARDS to get my drinks from him at a weird angle. After asking him why I needed to move up my car, he mumbled something. I asked AGAIN, and he said ""Don't worry it's my thing""... WHATEVER THAT MEANS.

The whole encounter was just so odd and I didn't even want my coffee anymore. Why move up my car? Are you hiding something? Like at least be honest with me

I'm so upset with the quality of these locations and will no longer be going to ANY Tim Hortons locations.

WHY DO THEY DO THIS? Has this happened to anyone else???",3,1743358404.0,TimHortons,3,0.72,False
