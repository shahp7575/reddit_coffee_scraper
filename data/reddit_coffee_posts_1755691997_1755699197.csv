i'm not on any meds except 1) supplementing Butcher's Broom extract for my varicocele issue and 2) pharmaceutical phenylpiracetam for my anhedonic depression (i do drink tea/coffee for same reason, it helps sligthly). 

i think this issue started before i started taking Butcher's Broom. and it does amplify either from anxiety or caffeine.

1mvfscn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mvfscn,I spent 107 days walking 1800 miles across New Zealand on the Te Araroa Trail,"I didn’t do this to break records or prove something. I just wanted to walk. New Zealand felt like the right place for it. Wild, varied, and open. The idea of crossing a whole country on foot stuck with me, so I booked a one-way flight and started making a loose plan.

I landed in Auckland, spent a night in a noisy hostel, and took a bus to Kaitaia. From there, someone gave me a lift to Cape Reinga. I stood at the lighthouse looking south, backpack heavier than it should’ve been, no idea what I was getting into. The first steps on Ninety Mile Beach were full of doubt. Wind, sunburn, blisters. And that was just day one.

But I kept walking. Through forests so dense they seemed to breathe, across farms, up into misty mountains. I slept mostly in my tent, tucked into corners of bush or behind public shelters. Sometimes a stranger would offer fruit or tea. Once, a hostel owner refused to charge me for a second night. Kindness like that really stayed with me.

The Richmond Ranges tested me more than anything else. Long climbs, freezing mornings, food running low. I learned to trust my instincts more than my GPS. Somewhere near Wanaka I realized I hadn’t spoken to anyone in two days. When I finally ordered a coffee in town, my voice cracked from disuse.

1mvfr9f,https://www.reddit.com/r/singleph/comments/1mvfr9f/28_f4m_looking_for_my_coffee_date_adventure_buddy/,28 [F4M] Looking for My Coffee Date + Adventure Buddy for Life,"Hello! Trying this again. I did meet someone to date here before, but it didn’t work out. So here I am, still hopeful to find the one. 😊

I really want to take dating seriously. That means giving effort in getting to know each other, spending time together, and being intentional. So, I hope those who reach out are on the same page and not just here for NSFW.

A few things about me:  
Corporate life takes up most of my weekdays, but I try to balance it out. I read books when I want to slow down, binge Netflix (anime, movies, series, etc. and still no one to watch Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle with 😅) and go for runs/jog/weights at home to clear my head. On weekends, I’m either experimenting in the kitchen (with whatever little ingredients I have 😂), playing Valorant, or planning a hike (that usually gets cancelled thanks to the rainy season), an EK trip, or starting out a new hobby I can think of. I’m a mix of homebody and adventurer and I’d love to have someone to share both sides with.

  
I’m 5 ft tall (fun-sized 😅), long-haired, fair-skinned, average face and build. Not the chinita/mestiza type most guys usually go for and just your typical Filipina look. I’ve been called “pretty” or “cute,” but honestly, I think those are just generic compliments… so I’ll let you be the judge. 😊

 

What I’m looking for:

* Someone taller (5’7” and up because heels exist and I like wearing heels hehe).
* Someone my age or older, since based on experience, younger guys often aren’t ready for something serious yet.
* A guy who’s up for actual dates (food trips, trying new places, cozy nights in, or long conversations over coffee)
* Working and someone who’s stable enough to spend (at least for himself?)
* Someone who’s serious about dating. I’m not here for half-hearted connections or mind games. I want to build something real, meaningful, and lasting. Please don’t disappear when things start going well (ghosting!) and I value honesty, conflict resolution, and consistency.

At this point in my life, I value quality over quantity. I yearn for consistency, honesty, and someone who knows what they want. If you’re the type who can make me laugh, match my energy whether indoors or outdoors, and are genuinely looking for something deeper, we’ll probably get along well.

If you think we’d vibe, send me a message. Who knows? Maybe we’ll end up bonding over coffee, laughing at failed cooking attempts, or planning our next food trip together. Please also tell me something about yourself (more than just “hi” or “hello”  please). See you.",2,1755698738.0,singleph,0,1.0,False
1mvfqrk,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1mvfqrk/discover_if_philips_aquaclean_coffee_filter/,Discover if Philips AquaClean Coffee Filter Review Proves Worthwhile for Pure Coffee Lovers!,"The **Philips Kitchen Appliances CA6903/22 AquaClean Coffee Filter** has been my go-to coffee companion for weeks, and I’ve got a lot to share about it. Between the promise of descaling-free coffee for up to 5,000 cups, convenient installation, and the satisfying purity of every brew, this product certainly delivers on many of its promises. That being said, it’s worth diving deeper into its standout features and areas that could be improved.

**Design and Build Quality**  
I wasn’t expecting much from a coffee filter in terms of appearance, but I’ll admit the thoughtful design surprised me. The compact dimensions (3.4""D x 3.75""W x 5.7""H) and lightweight nature make it super easy to handle, especially when replacing filters. The sleek blue plastic body doesn’t scream luxury, but the build feels robust enough for everyday use. Despite being lightweight, it doesn’t come across as flimsy and fits seamlessly into compatible espresso machines. It’s both functional and minimalist, which I appreciate in kitchen gadgets.

**Ease of Installation**  
Installations can sometimes be fiddly, but not with this one. The click-and-go system is surprisingly hassle-free. Even my less-than-tech-savvy brother managed it without needing my help (a small miracle). It’s intuitive enough that you don’t delve into manuals or internet tutorials to figure it out. For someone like me, who has mornings ruled by caffeine urgency, this time-saving feature earns big points.

**Performance and Filtration**  
The juice—or coffee, in this case—of this product is its filtration abilities, and it’s here the AquaClean really stands out. I could truly taste a difference in my coffee’s flavor after letting the filter work its magic. The micro-porous filter reduces impurities and prevents clogging while the ion-exchange technology naturally removes calcium. I even tested water from my old unfiltered system for comparison, and the coffee was noticeably less smooth. With this filter, I’m confident every cup is as close to pure bliss as possible. However, it’s important to note that it works best when you follow the replacement schedule properly. If you slack on that, you might just miss out on the charm.

**Advantages**  
- Hassle-free click-and-go installation.  
- Micro-porous filter that prevents clogging.  
- Noticeable improvement in coffee flavor.  
- Ensures no need for descaling up to 5,000 cups.  

**Critiques**  
- The fact that descaling is still affected by adherence to the replacement schedule might deter more casual users.  
- Only compatible with Philips and select Saeco espresso machines, which feels a little restrictive.  

**User compatibility and lifespan**  
The filter is marketed for Philips and certain Saeco espresso machines, so you’ll need to make sure your coffee maker checks that box. I tried this out specifically on a Philips LatteGo machine and verified its compatibility without a hitch. However, if you own other brands or models, this filter becomes a no-go, which could be a letdown for some coffee enthusiasts. As for the 5,000-cup lifespan per filter, that’s an absolute game-changer—assuming you follow the replacement schedule diligently.

**Competing Brands**  
Several contenders stand against this coffee filter, such as Brita-style water filtration systems or machines that come with built-in purifiers. Brita filters, for instance, offer broader compatibility but don’t integrate into espresso makers directly like the Philips AquaClean. On the other hand, built-in filters such as the Jura models can deliver comparable quality but come with a significant price premium. After reviewing both, I’d say the Philips filter hits a sweet spot between convenience and cost-effectiveness, especially for users who are already loyal to the Philips or Saeco line of coffee makers.

**Affordable Quality**  
Given the features like the advanced ion-exchange filtration system and the descaling-free maintenance claim, the price-to-quality ratio doesn’t feel unreasonable. You’re not overpaying for fluff here. Similar products in this category don’t often match the capacity and simplicity. While it’s still an investment if considering multiple replacements, the quality of both coffee and machine longevity make it worth the spend.

**Why This Pick?**

This is a high-scoring affair in my mind, friends. Athletics starter J.T. Ginn (5.04 ERA) has allowed 12 runs and 4 HRs and in just his last 3 starts. Meanwhile, the team’s offense has bagged no less than 5 runs in their last 4 straight starts. On the other side, starter Bailey Ober (5.15 ERA) has allowed 16 hits and 3 HRs in his last 3 outings. I think this game turns into a shootout – take the Over to cash.

1mvfowb,https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1mvfowb/100_hours_nonpurist/,100 Hours. Non-Purist,"My Background: I have taken Spanish through high school and middle school; however, I didn't learn a ton. A couple of things fueled this journey  
1: My girlfriend's family does not speak English, and I wanted to be able to talk to them  
2: I go to a majority-Hispanic school, and I wanted to be able to talk to my native friends in their language  
3: My school is doing a trip to Spain next year, and I wanted to be able to speak to the natives

How I learned: I use flashcards, reading, keep a journal in Spanish, and, of course, Dreaming Spanish. I have been learning for about 2 months now.  
What I can do: I can understand up to advanced videos with a little bit of effort. Intermediate videos are easy for the most part (Although, at times, some difficulty depending on the video) 

I do speak to my girlfriend and often when I eat out at a South American take-out spot. In the past few days, I've gotten a job as a deli back where a majority of the kitchen staff exclusively speaks Spanish, I can hold a conversation with all of them (some I have not tried with). For example, yesterday I spoke to my coworker about whether or not his country (Ecuador) was dangerous or not. After some thought he responded ""No, not necessarily, I mean, look, if you're a bad person and you're doing the wrong thing, you will probably be killed but if you're a good person and you surround yourself with other good people, nobody's going to bother you, you're gonna be okay.""  I was very surprised to be able to understand what he was saying as he said it at what I would assume to be a native speed. I no doubt have to thank CI for this. We also talked about a few other things, such as how he likes his coffee, how many kids he has, how old they are, what jobs do they have, and whether or not he visits them often (as he said he is in the states alone, his family is still in Ecuador), At the end he complimented my spanish and walked away which I take as a win  
Of course, this conversation wasn't without issue; I forgot how to say a few things, but other than that, I would say it was probably the best conversation I've ever had in Spanish. My two biggest issues were that I couldn't ask him which kid had which job, and forgetting how to say ""Do you visit often"" (I would later remember and ask him), but like I sai,d other than those, the conversation went pretty well in my opinion.

Our staff and clients often meet up at a local coffee shop downtown. While we were downtown, the coffee shop owner pulled me aside. He asked me “ Does this client do drugs”. I responded “No sir, he doesn’t do drugs”. He asked me “Why, does he dress like that is he homeless?. He told me there’s been a lot of homeless folks just loitering at his shop for hours and that he wasn’t dealing with it no more. I told my team lead and service coordinator. They told me to ignore it and that he’s being rude. But I agree with the coffee shop owner. Clients need to be taking showers before they get into staff’s vehicles before community outings.

Trying this again. I did meet someone to date here before, but I guess it didn’t work out. So here I am, still hopeful to find the one. 😊

I really want to take dating seriously. That means giving effort in getting to know each other, spending time together, and being intentional. So, I hope those who reach out are on the same page and not just here for NSFW.

A few things about me:  
Corporate life takes up most of my weekdays, but I try to balance it out. I read books when I want to slow down, binge Netflix (anime, movies, series, etc. and still no one to watch Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle with 😅) and go for runs/jog/weights at home to clear my head. On weekends, I’m either experimenting in the kitchen (with whatever little ingredients I have 😂), playing Valorant, or planning a hike (that usually gets cancelled thanks to the rainy season), an EK trip, or starting out a new hobby I can think of. I’m a mix of homebody and adventurer and I’d love to have someone to share both sides with.

I’m 5 ft tall (fun-sized 😅), long-haired, fair-skinned, average face and build. Not the chinita type most guys usually go for and just your typical Filipina look. I’ve been called “pretty” or “cute,” but honestly, I think those are just generic compliments… so I’ll let you be the judge. 😊

What I’m looking for:

PLEASE BE SINGLE (not separated, not co-parenting, etc) 

* Someone taller (5’7” and up because heels exist and I like wearing heels hehe).
* Someone my age or older, since based on experience, younger guys often aren’t ready for something serious, yet.
* A guy who’s up for actual dates (food trips, trying new places, cozy nights in, or long conversations over coffee)
* Working and someone who’s stable enough to spend (at least for himself?)
* Someone who’s serious about dating. I’m not here for half-hearted connections or mind games. I want to build something real, meaningful, and lasting. Please don’t disappear when things start going well (ghosting!) and I value honesty, conflict resolution, and consistency.

At this point in my life, I value quality over quantity. I yearn for consistency, honesty, and someone who knows what they want. If you’re the type who can make me laugh, match my energy whether indoors or outdoors, and are genuinely looking for something deeper, we’ll probably get along well.

If you think we’d vibe, send me a message. Who knows? Maybe we’ll end up bonding over coffee, laughing at failed cooking experiments, or planning our next food trip together. Please also tell me something about yourself (more than just “hi” or “hello”  please). See you.",0,1755698489.0,PhR4Dating,1,0.25,False

1mvfivl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1mvfivl/an_article_i_came_across_today_managed_to/,"An article I came across today managed to perfectly describe where my brain has settled after all these years: ""languishing"" or ""quiet surrender""","https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/s-8-quiet-signs-someone-has-given-up-inside-and-is-just-going-through-the-motions/

You can read the full list, but I'll share the Intro and Final Thoughts sections.  This encompasses how I've been feeling for so long now, the resignation over 'what could have been' has become my ""normal"".

>We have language for dramatic breakdowns, for obvious depression, for people who can't get out of bed. But there's another kind of giving up that's harder to name—the kind where someone continues showing up, executing their routines with technical precision, while something essential has quietly slipped away. They're not falling apart. They're perfectly functional. They've just stopped believing any of it matters.

>This quiet surrender often goes unnoticed because it mimics engagement so well. These people aren't crying for help; they're performing normalcy with the dedication of method actors who can't remember why they took the role. The phenomenon psychologists call ""languishing""—that middle ground between thriving and depression—has become our emotional baseline, so common we barely register when someone crosses from coping into merely existing.

---

>My roommate and I talked for another hour that day. She told me about her promotion, her new apartment, her five-year plan. All the right words, properly arranged. But that moment of absolute neutrality stayed with me—that glimpse of someone who'd mastered the choreography of living while forgetting the music.

>The quiet given-up don't need rescue in the traditional sense. They're not drowning; they're floating. But floating indefinitely is its own kind of emergency, a slow-motion crisis that unfolds in conference rooms and coffee shops, in perfectly maintained apartments where someone goes through all the right motions while waiting for a reason to mean them.

>Perhaps what's most heartbreaking about these quiet surrenders is how invisible they remain. We're so impressed by functional depression, by people who ""keep it together,"" that we mistake performance for resilience. We praise their reliability while missing their distress signals, which come not as cries for help but as perfect execution of a life they no longer believe in.

>The spark that goes out doesn't always announce itself with darkness. Sometimes it just leaves someone going through the motions with increasing perfection and decreasing presence, until they become ghosts haunting their own existence, so skilled at seeming alive that no one notices they've already left.",7,1755698215.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False
1mvfex8,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheReliableToolbox/comments/1mvfex8/does_the_klein_tools_cl120_clamp_meter_truly/,Does the Klein Tools CL120 Clamp Meter Truly Deliver Accurate Measurements Review?,"**Compact and Practical Design**  
I’ve been testing various electrical tools for years, and the Klein Tools CL120 Digital Clamp Meter immediately struck me with its thoughtful and compact design. Its dimensions—8.45 x 3.51 x 1.51 inches—make it incredibly easy to handle and maneuver in tight spaces. The lightweight build, at just 9.76 ounces, is perfect for prolonged use without causing hand fatigue. The clamp mechanism feels smooth yet sturdy, a testament to its high-quality craftsmanship. With its green accents and solid matte finish, it not only looks professional but also feels premium. I particularly appreciated the inclusion of a test lead holder on the side of the clamp, which keeps everything in place during use—super handy when juggling multiple tasks.  

**Ease of Power and Controls**  
Running on three AAA batteries, the clamp meter is battery-powered, which makes it entirely portable. It came with the batteries pre-included (a rarity these days!), and setting it up took under a minute. What really caught my eye was the backlit LCD display. I tried it in a dimly lit room, and the screen showed crisp readings without putting any strain on my eyes. The auto-power-off feature—triggered after 10 minutes of inactivity—helped save battery when I got distracted (or walked off to grab coffee in the middle of testing).  

[Don’t miss Klein Tools CL120 deals—check Amazon here.](https://measuringworld.com/p/b08cp6gl49/)  

**Accurate and Efficient Measurements**  
For me, the heart of any electrical tester lies in its precision. The Klein Tools CL120 delivers exceptional accuracy thanks to its auto-ranging functionality. Whether measuring AC current through the clamp or AC/DC voltage via test leads, every test I ran gave consistent results. The non-contact voltage testing feature integrated into the clamp jaw stood out during one of my sessions. Detecting live wires without direct contact was not just efficient but felt significantly safer. I even used it to pinpoint the exact issue in one of my refrigerator circuits without guesswork.  

**Benefits**  
- Auto-ranging technology ensures precise results.  
- Non-contact voltage testing for enhanced safety.  
- Clear LCD backlit display for low-light conditions.  

**Downsides**  
- The carrying case provided was a tad snug; it felt like I had to force the meter in every time.  
- The magnetic hanger accessory isn’t included—sold separately—which was slightly disappointing.  

**Versatile Features for Everyday Use**  
This is not your average clamp meter. Its ability to measure resistance, continuity, and hold data is genuinely useful. I was especially impressed by the Max and Data Hold capabilities. While repairing an AC unit, the Data Hold feature saved me from constantly glancing at the screen, letting me record results hands-free. The instructions provided with the meter were straightforward, although I doubt anyone seasoned in electrical testing will need them.  

**Performance Compared to Competing Products**  
Having used other meters like Fluke 323 and Southwire 23070T, I feel the Klein Tools CL120 strikes a sweet spot at delivering reliability without going overboard on cost. The Fluke’s rugged build feels a notch higher, but the Klein’s auto-ranging feature and compact size make it more practical for my daily needs. Southwire, while decent, often misses out on offering clear backlit displays, which the Klein executes flawlessly. For those focused on portability and versatility, this one edges slightly above its competitors.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
Evaluating whether it’s worth the price often boils down to what the product brings to the table. With the inclusion of batteries, leads with safety caps, and even a carrying case, you’re not left scrambling to buy extras. For professionals or even diligent DIYers, the features balance out the investment nicely. Sure, there are clamp meters out there with a lower upfront cost, but they often compromise on build or accuracy. This tool offers that rare blend of practicality and functionality, making it worth every cent.

1mvfet7,https://www.reddit.com/r/gso/comments/1mvfet7/greensboro_library_concerns/,Greensboro Library concerns,"Hello everyone, I recently took a trip to the Greensboro library because I needed to study for a big exam. I was tired of the normal coffee shops and wanted to revisit a place I had spent a lot of my childhood in, thinking the library is perfect to wrap up my studies…I was very wrong. Outside the doors was a small crowd of homeless, most of whom were bent over with the “Fent-lean”, and others were giving me some bad looks. When I went inside, I saw zero families, and zero children in the kids area; only homeless. I went up to the second floor and at every computer or desk was still more homeless individuals. The man working for the library desk had to repeatedly wake up guys who were passing out from drugs, and constantly tell them to not watch porn on the computers. The police were walking all around and in and out of the bathrooms, and I left after an hour because I could not take it anymore. My family and I would spend HOURS of my childhood in that library or the high point one, and it makes me pretty sad that it’s turned into a homeless encampment instead of a lovely place to read some fascinating books. How did it get to this? And what can be done moving forward??",0,1755697949.0,gso,5,0.47,False

/ˈmʌndənaɪ/



\*\*Definition:\*\* To make something ordinary, commonplace, or mundane; to strip something of its special, extraordinary, or remarkable qualities through repetition, over-exposure, or routine treatment.



\*\*Etymology:\*\* From Latin \*mundanus\* (""of the world, earthly, ordinary"") + English suffix \*-ify\* (""to make, cause to become"")



\*\*Example usage:\*\*

\- ""Social media has a tendency to mundanify even the most breathtaking travel destinations.""

\- ""Don't let routine mundanify the magic of your morning coffee ritual.""

\- ""The constant news coverage managed to mundanify what should have been a historic achievement.""



\*\*Related forms:\*\* mundanification (n.), mundanifying (adj.)



This word fills a gap for describing the specific process by which something loses its specialness through over-familiarity or routine exposure. While we have words like ""normalize"" or ""trivialize,"" mundanify captures the particular way that repeated exposure or routine treatment can drain the wonder or significance from experiences, places, or concepts.

These geniuses would confer with each other for what seemed like seconds before providing the correct answer.

1mvfcpp,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplianceCheck/comments/1mvfcpp/delve_into_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker/,Delve Into the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker Keurig K-Iced Worth It,"Testing devices like the Keurig 5000371871 K-Iced Coffee Maker always has me buzzing—both from the coffee and from the thrill of unboxing another promising gadget. After giving it a good run for its money, I brewed hundreds of cups, played around with settings, and became very familiar with its quirks. This machine promises an all-in-one solution for iced and hot coffee lovers, and I’ve got plenty to say about whether or not it holds up.

**User-Friendly Design and Compactness**  
Straight out of the box, this coffee maker’s compact size stands out. Measuring just 12.9"" by 5.1"" by 12.6"", it comfortably fits my countertop without gobbling up valuable kitchen space. This makes it ideal even for apartments or offices where real estate is tight. The gray finish is subtle but sleek, blending nicely with most modern kitchen aesthetics. Its interface is straightforward—all it takes is a few presses of well-lit, responsive buttons to get it brewing. The removable drip tray is a thoughtful addition, accommodating taller tumblers for iced coffee while being an easy-clean solution for those inevitable spills. However, while it does tick the box for compactness, its lightweight design—only 3 pounds—makes it feel a little less durable than some heavy-duty brewers.

**Performance That Keeps You Guessing**  
The promise of both hot and iced coffee in one machine is what roped me in. I’ll admit, the Brew Over Ice button is genius. With one press, it adjusts the brewing temperature: starting hot to extract rich flavors, then cooling down to reduce ice melt. This minor detail creates an iced coffee that tastes less like flavored water and more like cold, caffeinated bliss. On the hot brew side, I couldn’t resist testing the Strong Brew option, which delivers a bolder, more intense cup. That said, while both functions are fairly even in quality, I did notice that the brew time wasn’t always consistent—occasionally taking a little longer for no apparent reason.  

[Check Keurig 5000371871 price on Amazon.](https://werdink.com/p/b0bsmgnyn3/)

**Energy Savings and Reservoir Convenience**  
As a bonus feature, the energy-efficient auto-off function is a welcome touch. It powers the device down five minutes after the last brew, which helps save energy (and probably a touch of guilt). The 42oz removable reservoir is a lifesaver in busy households like mine—I could easily brew up to four cups—enough to caffeinate myself during those extra-long mornings when the to-do list is endless. However, frequent coffee drinkers might have to refill it more often than they’d like, especially when brewing 12oz cups.

**Winning Points**  
The Keurig K-Iced Coffee Maker has some undeniable highlights:  
- Intuitive Brew Over Ice functionality for standout iced coffee.  
- Compact design that fits tight spaces effortlessly.  
- Strong Brew setting for more intense, flavor-rich hot coffee.  

**Critiques**  
However, it’s not a perfect machine and some hurdles do exist:  
- Slight inconsistencies in brew times.  
- Lightweight material may not appeal to users who prefer sturdier designs.  

**Competing Products**  
Comparisons are inevitable, especially with coffee makers like the Nespresso Vertuo or the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew in the same conversation. While the Nespresso wins on luxury, offering a silky crema and a broader selection of pod options, it falters in flexibility—no iced coffee capability there. The Hamilton Beach, on the other hand, is a strong contender with its dual compatibility for pods and ground coffee. However, its lack of a dedicated iced coffee feature puts the Keurig 5000371871 ahead for those who live for their iced lattes. One area where these rival products outshine the Keurig is in their overall material build, which feels more robust compared to the latter’s lighter construction.

**Financial Value**  
Cost-effectiveness is always a lingering question, right? The versatility of brewing both hot and iced coffee in one machine makes it feel like you’re getting a two-for-one deal, although the lightweight build has me wondering about its longevity. For what’s essentially a fully-automatic drip coffee machine with reusable filter compatibility, it holds its ground reasonably well against pricier alternatives. For people like me who spend way too much on coffee-shop brew, the long-term savings are hard to ignore.

1mvfbnj,https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1mvfbnj/how_do_you_all_handle_online_privacy_and_security/,How do you all handle online privacy and security in 2025?,"Lately I’ve been paying way more attention to my digital footprint than ever before. Between constant data breaches, shady public Wi-Fi networks, and every website wanting to track my behavior, it honestly feels like staying private online is a full-time job. I used to ignore it, but after a close friend had their bank info compromised last year, I realized how vulnerable we all really are.

What’s crazy is that most people don’t even think twice before logging into sensitive accounts while sitting at an airport or coffee shop. I’ve also noticed a lot of ISPs quietly collecting and selling user data, which makes me uncomfortable. On top of that, certain sites and streaming services block you depending on your location, which feels unfair given how global the internet should be.

I’ve started experimenting with different tools to see what actually helps, but it’s kind of overwhelming. Some solutions feel too technical for everyday use, while others are so slow they ruin the experience. Ideally, I just want something that lets me connect, browse, and stream without worrying about leaks or speed drops.

So I’m curious, what are your go-to methods for balancing privacy, security, and speed online? Do you stick with built-in browser tools, tweak your settings manually, or rely on external apps? Would love to hear what’s actually working for people in real-world day-to-day use.

There’s this guy J that has consistently cropped up over the years. I’ve no real idea why. 

Early in our relationship him and my gf were FWB. They were together only twice AFAIk. She had some unresolved feelings for him but claimed there is nothing there any more.

We had a fight about him early in our relationship. At the time met me, she was sending him a postcard for his birthday and clearly had feelings for him. We were only going out a few weeks and weren’t fully exclusive so I let it go. We are allowed to have a past after all?

I asked her later when we were exclusive to stop talking with him. Thats where I thought it was finished. Flash forward a nearly one year later and I use her laptop and I see on facebook messenger they are still friends and even talking. He asked for a coffee. Shes non committal and not exactly shutting it down. 

We’ve a big fight were we nearly break up and she then promises to stop talking to him.

Flash forward 5-6 years later. We start talking about spicing up the relationship. Not exactly opening it but maybe go to a sex club and explore boundaries. She mentions off hand she still considers some people in her past as good people. This specific guy comes up. And she said nothing.

Then a few days ago I get a feeling and check her phone. She wished him happy birthday and initiated a conversation. I can see he is married now and she discusses me and mentions we are building a life etc.

Cue another big argument. Shes hurt I don’t trust her and she said she didn’t do anything wrong and that she would never cheat on me. 

She wants to have kids with me. Make a life. That the guy was ugly and meant nothing. He’s bald and had a belly and used to fuck everything that moved when they were together, that she was just curious. 

I’m like curious about what? Like what the hell does an ex person mean from a long time ago? I can’t even remember what the name of some people I was with. I’ve no interest keeping up contact or being friends with them.

She’s on to say that if she wanted to cheat she wouldn’t trust me with her phone and wouldn’t leave it all open to see. She kind of implied I was a little controlling or jealous but I don’t care if she has platonic friendships but a guy she used to be with that I’ve had repeated problems with?

I just feel so betrayed. Like I don’t get why she keeps this specific guy. This is like the 3rd or 4th we’ve had a fight about him. Now she’s terrified in going to leave and acting all extra sexual and trying to initiate more.  

As far I know I can trust he and she won’t cheat but I’m just baffled what is it about a guy from 10 years ago that has her curious. I’ve asked her and she just sticks to she was curious and can’t really answer it. She is stressed that I might leave her. I it’s feel ending a relationship over it is nuclear but I’m driven by thoughts shes not being honest fully in her words.",0,1755697720.0,WhatShouldIDo,11,0.5,False
1mvfb5e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1mvfb5e/am_i_doing_the_wrong_thing_even_if_it_is_with/,Am I doing the wrong thing even if it is with good intentions?,"This is all written while I listen to depressing music. Through this text, I want to talk about my recent love, which was never meant to happen. But if there is something I’ve learned from this experience, it’s that you can fall in love with anyone.

Life is cruel, and I found out the hard way. One day I decided to walk with a girl to university for a trip without knowing what life had in store for me. I just wanted company; I didn’t want to walk alone. Now I think I’ll have to walk for the rest of my life without her. How can a simple five minute walk mean so much? How is it possible that the smallest interactions are the most valuable of them all? I could have never imagined what that would mean for me in the future.

I didn’t know many people on that trip, but what I did know is that I felt safe and comfortable with that stranger. Me, an introvert. I’m also the kind of guy who sometimes gets afraid of talking to girls. But this one was different. She was so easy to talk to, so easy to relate to, that it made me feel at home. We didn’t interact as much as I would have liked during the trip, but the little we did meant a lot to me. After that day, we didn’t hang out or talk much, but I decided to remind her that she had said she would send me the number of a woman who rents apartments. That’s how it all started from the smallest and most insignificant thing. From there, we just started telling funny stories and laughing. It felt so natural, so nice. I will never forget how she made me feel during those days.

We continued talking day after day, but as you can imagine, topics started to run out. So I did what anyone who wants to keep talking to someone does: I sent her a follow request on Instagram. This would be a decision I’d come to love and be grateful for, but also one I’d come to regret at some point. I never knew the powers that Instagram held back then. I just innocently thought it was a meme sharing app.

As the days went by, I started sending memes, more and more memes, and she reacted, laughed, and sent memes back. It was fun, and I loved the interaction. At the same time, after class, I used to walk with her since her house was in the same direction as mine. Those were my favorite 10 minutes every Tuesday and Thursday. Actually, I’m lying, those were the best minutes of my week. I will never forget the laughs and jokes we shared in those minutes. They were magical. I wish I could go back to those days. The cruelest thing is that time flies, and we no longer have any classes together. She is a business major, and I am an engineering major. It was just a matter of time before our paths split. Neither of us let that kill our bond, though. We kept sending each other reels and texting on WhatsApp. We gave each other daily updates. We were each other’s daily chat, but for me, it was always more than a conversation. It was my way of forgetting about everything else and just enjoying the good things in life. She became the reason I smiled, the reason I did stupid stuff just to tell her so we could laugh together.

While all of this was happening, I managed to invite her to small things where we bonded from time to time. We went out for the occasional ice cream or coffee, or just sat under a tree. It didn’t matter what we did, I just wanted to spend time with her. I must confess that during some of those moments, I would stare at her and think to myself: “How can someone be so beautiful?” But I never said anything. I still looked at her and thought of her as my friend.

A few months later, around July 2024, she told me she was planning on going to Italy as an exchange student. I told her it was a great idea to visit other countries and enjoy European life, another decision I would come to regret. During all this, we usually talked through texts or audio messages, until one day, out of nowhere, she got angry at me for never calling her. I was surprised, as I thought she wasn’t that type of girl that liked calls. So we started planning calls, and yet again, another decision I would come to regret. We usually called after 10 p.m., the best and worst time for a girl and a guy to talk. We discussed every topic under the sun. The main one, though, was love and sexual experiences, and we found out neither of us had any. So we had to rely on Instagram reels for those conversations. I must say, there are a lot of hormonal people who post very lustful stuff on Instagram.

In January, she left for Italy, six months without her. These would be the six longest months of my life, and also the time when I would finally realize what I’d been avoiding since day one. When she left, we kept texting, but it was never the same. There was a five hour difference, when I was free, she was asleep; when she was free, I was in class. In Italy, she met friends who loved parties, and she started partying. I saw nothing wrong with that and I told her to have fun. I enjoyed her funny stories about parties and visiting new cities until the day she told me she kissed a random guy at a club. That day, I discovered jealousy. I was so pissed and angry that I just read her messages from the notification bar and ignored them the whole day. When I finally replied, she asked for my opinion on the matter. I told her she had done nothing wrong and that she should enjoy her life. The greatest lie I’ve ever told. What I really wanted to say was that she should never kiss any guy that wasn’t me but I didn’t have the courage.

That experience made me realize I had fallen in love with my friend, my dear friend, with whom I had shared so many moments. It might seem obvious to you, reading this from the outside, but for me, it was never that simple. She had always told me stories of guys who started as her friends and then ended up hitting on her, and how much she disliked that. I suppressed my feelings for so long. But that day, I couldn’t hide my love from myself anymore. I was lost. I didn’t know what to do. “Should I tell her my feelings? Should I just stop talking to her without telling her what I felt?” These were the questions I asked myself. I was more inclined to just end our friendship without saying anything, simply because I was afraid of becoming one of those guys she used to complain about. So I started distancing myself. I stopped replying quickly, and when I did reply, it was with shorter messages. I kept that up for almost a week, the longest week of my life.

By the end of that week, I realized I wanted her in my life as my soulmate, and if I couldn’t have her as my love, I still wanted her as my friend. So I went back to being the same person I was before the kiss, texting and calling her regularly, but it hurt every time I thought of that moment. Sadly, it didn’t end there. She found a guy she liked, the first guy she said she had ever liked. He was everything she wanted. That opened a deeper wound in my heart, but I kept silent and told her to enjoy her stay in Italy with him. In the end, that guy ghosted her out of nowhere. She told me they never even kissed, he just disappeared. She was mad at him, but I was secretly happy he was out of the picture, or so I thought. She couldn’t get over him. She kept bringing him up, and I just avoided the conversation.

While she was still in Italy, I tried sending her some indirect messages to see if she was interested in me at all. All I got back were either no replies or subtle rejections. I’ll never know if she did this consciously or not.

When the six months were up, she came back, and I was so happy and excited to see her again. I gave her a proper, long hug, a hug with love. We sat and talked for hours, and then she asked me to go grocery shopping with her. It was such a pleasant experience. I forgot to mention that we used to do this during the first months of our friendship. It was fun, but nothing lasts forever. Later that week, during one of our late night conversations on Instagram, she confessed to kissing two other guys, and told me she’d even met up again with the guy who had ghosted her. At that moment, I just wanted to go to sleep, so I started replying slower until the conversation ended.

That day, I understood that what I felt was not reciprocal. I loved her, while she loved her summer fling from Italy. That day, I finally understood the meaning of the phrase: “I could fight 100 men who want you, but I can’t fight the one guy you want.” There was nothing left for me to do. She only saw me as her friend. I was happy to be her friend for a few more days, but I’m an overthinker. If you give me time to think, I start imagining every possibility. And in every one of them, I couldn’t see myself not loving her. Overthinking, that’s what leads us to the end of this text.

While she was still in Italy, she told me we should go to the cinema together to watch a movie. I suggested the new Demon Slayer movie, which releases in September this year. She told me she hadn’t watched the anime, so I said we could watch it together. That’s why, every Tuesday and Friday night, we’ve been watching it on Teleparty.

But going back to what I said about overthinking, I kept imagining more and more scenarios, and in every one, I couldn’t see a world where I didn’t love her. I got tired of hiding my feelings. I decided it was time to make a real decision about our future: either I express how I feel, or I leave her behind. I talked to a friend about it, and the opinions were divided. In the end, I’m a coward, so I chose the easy way out. I’d rather stop talking to her without telling her what I feel than confess and be rejected. My friends told me that one sided love never ends well, that it always ruins the friendship eventually. So I thought, if we’re going to stop talking either way, I’d rather let it fade without becoming another one of her stories about “friends who fell in love with her.”

In life, there are questions we think we know the answers to, and we’d rather stay that way than discover the truth. The fear of rejection has made me suppress my feelings for so long. So my plan is to do the most selfish thing I’ve ever done, even though I’m usually a selfless person. I plan to finish the anime, pretend everything is okay between us, then go to the cinema together, and after that, slowly stop talking to her. The plan is to mute her everywhere so I don’t feel the impulse to text her right away, and instead only reply when I check my phone. I’ll also stop texting her first, something I’ve already been doing for the past two weeks. Lastly, I’ll stop calling her and stop sending the long voice notes we used to call “podcasts” about my day. At some point, I hope she stops texting too. It will be hard to watch my friend fade away, but deep down, I think this is the wrong thing to do, with the right intentions. The longer this friendship stays this close, the harder it will be for me to detach. And when she realizes what’s going on, it will hurt her too.

Loving is also letting go, even if that means it hurts you deeply.

My husband lost his job six months ago. His boss fired him for ""performance issues"" but honestly, the guy just had it out for him. We were drowning in bills and I was getting desperate.

Last month I ran into his ex-boss at a coffee shop. He started flirting and mentioned how sorry he was about the situation. One thing led to another and we started texting. He offered to help with our bills if I was ""open to spending time together."" I knew what he meant.

I told myself it was just business. My husband was getting more depressed every day and the eviction notice was sitting on our kitchen table. So I said yes.

We met at his office after hours three times. He gave me cash each time. It wasn't romantic or anything, just transaction. I felt sick about it but we needed the money.

The third time, my husband showed up. He'd been suspicious about where I was getting money and followed me. He walked right in on us. His ex-boss was scrambling to get dressed and my husband just stood there staring.

My husband started yelling at his old boss about taking advantage of desperate people. His ex-boss got angry and said my husband was pathetic for letting his wife handle their problems. They got into a screaming match and my husband shoved him. His ex-boss called security and had my husband escorted out. Then he called the police and said my husband was trespassing and threatening him.

My husband got arrested. When he got out the next morning, he wouldn't even look at me. He packed a bag and went to stay with his parents.

His mom called me yesterday screaming about what a horrible person I am. She said I destroyed their son and humiliated their whole family. His dad got on the phone and called me names I won't repeat.

I finally snapped and told them they should be grateful I was still trying to bring money into the house while their precious son sat around feeling sorry for himself. I said at least I was doing something instead of just giving up like he did. I told them if they cared so much about the family reputation, maybe they should have raised a son who could actually provide for his wife.

His mom hung up on me. Now his whole family is posting on Facebook about what a terrible person I am. My husband sent me one text saying he's filing for divorce.

But here's what I don't get. We were about to lose everything. I did what I had to do to keep us afloat. Yes it was messy, but I was trying to save our marriage by saving our finances. His pride got in the way of accepting help, even if it came with strings attached.

Designed specifically for convenience and compact spaces, this gadget is perfect for individuals or small households who cherish their morning rituals but don’t necessarily want a full-on barista setup. Admittedly, the stark white finish, paired with its minimalist 4-inch width, makes it fit effortlessly into tighter spaces like dorms, offices, or even RVs. Plus, it’s lightweight—at just 2.6 pounds, moving it around isn’t a chore at all.

**Compact Size, Big Promises**

This petite coffee maker stands out for its size, but don’t let the lean profile fool you; it packs in some decent features. Its slim build, which is only 4 inches wide, is surprisingly versatile. I can easily slot it between kitchen appliances on my counter or place it on a side table in my office. The thoughtful design of the drip tray, adjustable to three different heights, was especially convenient to switch between small cups and travel mugs up to 7.3 inches tall. This makes it adaptable to various mug sizes, so there’s no awkward tilting or splashing.

[Check CHULUX CL-KM807-W price on Amazon.](https://whyjoni.com/p/b0db8dnfx2/)

**Flexibility in Brewing Options**

One of the aspects I appreciated about this coffee machine was how it covers both single-use coffee capsules and coffee grounds via a reusable filter (sold separately). Personally, I tested it using K-pods most times—both 1.0 and 2.0 pods worked seamlessly. It felt like brewing was intended to be a no-brainer here since there’s literally one button to press. You pour in water, pop in a pod, and hit go. The result? A single serving brewed to perfection in less than two minutes. For those who prefer their own grinds and have the reusable filter, it still delivers solid performance.

**Good Points**

• Simple one-button operation and quick brewing  
• Compact design ideal for small spaces  
• Adjustable drip tray to accommodate various mug sizes  
• Lightweight and portable for convenience  

**Rapid Brewing and Energy Efficiency**

The CHULUX CL-KM807-W doesn’t make you wait. It heats water to the optimal brewing temperature of 190°F within two minutes—a blessing when you’re scrambling through your morning routine. The energy-saving auto-shutoff feature is another win. I found myself grateful for this when running out the door, knowing I wouldn’t have to worry about whether the machine was still on. It’s not just convenient but practical for energy-conscious individuals too.

**Tailoring to Flavor Preferences**

The ability to control cup sizes from 6 to 12 ounces felt empowering because it catered to different beverage needs. Whether you’re in the mood for a quick 6-ounce caffeine boost or want to savor a larger cup at 12 ounces, the CHULUX coffee maker ensures flexibility. That said, the water reservoir could be a bit larger since adding water for every brew isn’t the most seamless process. The fill area is easy to access, but having some extra capacity wouldn’t hurt.

**Areas of Concern**

• Limited water reservoir capacity means frequent refilling  
• The reusable filter for coffee grounds is sold separately  
• Regular descaling needs can be an extra step if water quality varies  

**Product Alternatives**

Comparing the CHULUX coffee maker to competitors like the Keurig K-Mini, there are notable distinctions. The Keurig unit supports additional pod brands and offers a larger water reservoir, but it takes up more counter space and weighs nearly twice as much. Meanwhile, the CHULUX feels like it was created with portability and minimalist design at the forefront. It’s a solid alternative if simplicity is your priority and budget matters to you. Another rival, the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, provides dual brewing options (pods and carafes) but again sacrifices the compact size.

**Cost Efficiency**

When it comes to pricing, the CHULUX CL-KM807-W sits comfortably in the budget-friendly territory. Given its build quality and features, you get decent value considering its compact design, fast brewing time, and easy-to-use function. While it may not offer advanced features like a built-in milk frother, it does what it promises efficiently and without complications. Compared to pricier competitors with redundant bells and whistles, this coffee maker sticks to the essentials at an appealing price point.

I’ve had 2 dates and a handful of conversations. Usually when I initially message someone though, I comment on their profile and also say I would love to meet them for a coffee or a beverage. Lately, I also suggest pickleball and then a coffee.  I see a lot of women mentioning they don’t want penpals, get flooded with messages and meeting is what I prefer anyway. If there is space I usually also say I would be up for chatting here too if they prefer that. 

However, I also just propose the coffee/beverage idea because I am about to meet a perfect stranger who I have no idea if I will click with. But then I see some profiles say - instead of drinks let’s “Go for a sunrise paddle then grab coffee on the boardwalk”. While this sounds lovely, is this really the expectation for an initial meetup date?  While I would totally be up for something like this, I would think as a woman it kind of feels unsafe as would “going for a hike in the woods” or other things of that nature. 

Looking for advice here as I was married for over 18 years and clearly I don’t got game… partly because I don’t really play them.

Austin’s startup ecosystem is one of the most exciting in the U.S. Every week, founders are pitching at Capital Factory, demoing products at Techstars Austin, or hustling for visibility at SXSW. But here’s the uncomfortable truth: behind the high energy, too many Austin founders are running themselves into the ground before they even raise their seed round.

The Burnout Cycle in Austin Startups

Founders start with energy, passion, and a network. But the daily reality looks different:

You’re polishing your pitch deck for a VC coffee meeting at Caffe Medici.

You’re onboarding your first beta customers from UT Austin’s student community.

You’re handling customer support tickets late at night from your East Austin apartment.


The hustle is real — but so is the burnout. According to a recent Startup Genome report, more than 70% of founders admit to struggling with mental exhaustion. In Austin’s hyper-social startup culture, where networking and visibility are everything, the pressure is doubled.

The Hidden Killer: Admin Overload

Burnout doesn’t come from the “big vision work.” It comes from death by a thousand cuts:

Inbox triage

Scheduling investor calls

Cleaning up HubSpot pipelines

Coordinating early hires

Social media posting for visibility


Each of these feels “too small to outsource” — so founders keep them on their plates. Before long, they’re working 80+ hours a week, yet making slow progress on the milestones that actually matter to investors.

How Virtual Assistants Break the Cycle

Austin startups that thrive have one thing in common: they protect the founder’s energy. That’s where Virtual Assistants (VAs) come in.

Instead of waiting until Series A to build out full departments, Austin founders are increasingly leaning on agencies like VAConnect to plug in skilled, remote assistants who can immediately take 15–20 hours a week off the founder’s plate.

Imagine walking into Capital Factory on Monday with:

An inbox already sorted and flagged.

A week of social posts scheduled to highlight your product updates.

Investor research prepped for your coffee chats with Silverton Partners or LiveOak Venture Partners.

Your CRM clean and updated for when you run into a potential backer at an SXSW happy hour.


This is what founders call “mental freedom.”

The Smartest Seed Strategy in Austin

Investors love lean, focused teams. When a founder tries to do everything themselves, it signals risk: disorganization, burnout, and lack of focus. On the other hand, when founders use VAs, they send a message that they know how to leverage resources wisely.

That’s why some Austin VCs quietly encourage their portfolio companies to plug in VAs early — it keeps burn rates low while giving founders more bandwidth for growth.

Why VAConnect?

There are plenty of freelancers on Upwork, but Austin founders don’t have time to gamble. VAConnect is different:

Startup focus: Our VAs are trained to work with fast-moving founders, not just corporate teams.

Managed service: We recruit, train, and quality-control every VA. You don’t waste time “managing” another person.

Global talent, local relevance: With a strong South African talent base and experience supporting UK and U.S. startups, we provide reliable, cost-effective support tailored for Austin’s ecosystem.


The Seed-Stage Energy Hack

Austin is one of the best places to start a company — but also one of the busiest. From SXSW networking marathons to Capital Factory mentor sessions, founders are expected to show up everywhere at once. The only way to keep that pace without breaking is to delegate.

If you’re serious about surviving the grind and getting funded, you need to protect your focus. And the simplest way to start is by outsourcing the tasks that drain you daily.",1,1755697331.0,u_VA-Connect,1,1.0,False

\* Belly has a club crash out over Conrad. She's high for the first time in forever, drunk, and freaking out about getting married. Taylor didn't say ""let's not talk about this"", she said, don't run off and tell Jere about Christmas right now, and let's get you some water. When a friend is that upset and wasted in a bathroom, it's not a ""in vino veritas"" situation, it's ""let's help my friend out of this near panic attack"".

\* It seems like they got back to the house and Belly went out to the beach. When Belly comes in, Taylor seems very open to talking about how Belly is feeling. It's really tricky to be a friend in this situation. She already pushed Belly away once by saying that the wedding was probably a bad idea (in the coffee shop), and now she's trying to be supportive. I'm 99% sure Taylor still doesn't love the idea of Belly getting married right now, and it's really hard to balance being supportive, not inserting your own opinions, and identifying that the friend's mind is truly changing.

\* I was braced for mean girl behavior with Denise, but I think she was great to her. She may have 100% had ulterior motives by pulling Denise away from the boys, but I'd argue that that's actually great wingmanning (create some space, some curiosity before they all meet up again). And then when Taylor and Denise talk she has every opportunity to be shitty, and she actually does what she promised Stephen she'd do.

\* She was mean to her mom, that's not great. She's also had a very tough summer with her mom. And she apologized right away. If I said the exact same thing to my mom (or if a friend said it to me) I would be hurt but I'd know that a lot of that was redirected anger of a very hurt person who is also probably drunk haha.

\* Unrelated, but I liked seeing Belly thank Taylor. She has done a lot for Belly this summer and not gotten a lot in return! Taylor has basically almost watched her first love literally die, gotten broken up with, had to watch him move on, had her mom almost lose everything and have to turn her business around, gave up a job and NYC life she was super excited for, had her best friend enter into a very questionable engagement, and had to plan everything for it, all in one summer. Can we give her a break on the judgment!?

  
Edit: ALSO we should reserve judgment because we don't know what Taylor is going to do with this information ('I only pictured Conrad'). That's the first time Belly admitted things so clearly. Taylor is just doing her best.",6,1755697273.0,tsitp,0,1.0,False

I am not a PR professional, and I am asking a broad question and one you could get discussions on in sociology, politics, psychology, marketing, etc subreddits. But I feel like this topic is very front-and-center during PR crises or scandals, and people in this subreddit, who are PR professionals, are very finely attuned to such things and why they occur, so I am very interested in specifically your perspective. But if the mods of this subreddit believe this to be off-topic, I'm happy for the post to be deleted.

I am not American, and don’t live in the US. However, for certain reasons, one of them being very online and an English speaker, I am in touch with American culture and Americans a lot. One interesting behavior I notice among them is the (seemingly) widespread alignment between political preferences and commercial behavior. In other words, it seems to me that when an American buys something, even something trivial like a coffee or a pack of disposable razors, they want to know that the money went to the company/people with values that align with theirs. They don’t seem to think of buying things in terms of just commercial transactions, they think of them in terms of “supporting a cause” as if donating to a charity or political action group.

That’s rarely a thing where I’m from. I’m used to buying a product because I like the product and the price is right, and whether the person/company I am buying from has political or ethical beliefs divergent from mine is a separate question that doesn’t enter into my reasoning. Most people I know in real life are like this.

I want to know two things. First, is that a real thing, or is that only true of a small segment of American population that I’m somehow overexposed to because of the communities I am in online? And if that is a real thing – why is the American consumer culture such that this effect exists? Where is it coming from?

Also, to be clear, this is not supposed to poke fun at Americans, promote any sort of nationalist narrative, or any such thing. American culture is a different culture to mine, it works differently, people do not owe it to me to act similar to me – I understand that.

I picked up The 28 Day Fast Start and a copy of Fast, Feast, Repeat and have been working through them.  Excited for positive change!

Some questions though, mostly for workout IFers.

1- I workout in the morning during my fast.  Prior to beginning IF, I would wake up and do a pre-workout and creatine then BCAAs intraworkout.  Now Im waking up and doing a black coffee with 5 mgs of creatine.  My lifts are AWFUL comparatively.  My energy is low, fatigue hits way faster, and Im just less motivated at 5 am. Is this something my body just needs to get used to?  Anything else you guys are doing to help fasted lifts?  Compared to my BuckedUp pre, the coffee just aint doing it.

2- Along the same lines, and maybe a result of the coffee, I am feeling AWFUL after my workouts.  Super nauseous and feeling like Im going to vomit.  More than once I've broken my fast early because I feel like I HAVE to get something on my stomach to keep from puking. Anyone else have this happen?

3- Am I crazy to feel like Im sweating WAY more now that Im doing IF?

4- How carefully are you tracking protein?  I was tracking it prior to IF, now Im just trying to make sure I skew my eating towards protein rich foods. Not hitting my g of protein like I was before. Is that okay?

5- NOT A LIFTING QUESTION- my eating window currently includes a late lunch at work and goes through dinner (6 hours).  I do great during work and after dinner. My issue is when I get home from work.  I do most all of the cooking in the family, so there's like an hour after I get home that Im prepping dinner.  During that time, since Im in my window Im going crazy on EVERYTHING in the pantry and fridge.  Anyone else dealt with this and have some suggestions to combat it?

1mvevco,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Known_Economist_3791/comments/1mvevco/sarah_creal_back_of_the_cab_mascara_review/,Sarah Creal Back of the Cab Mascara Review,"Okay, so I’ve been testing the Sarah Creal Back of the Cab Mascara for about a month now (yep, the $40 tube that everyone keeps whispering about). And honestly? I have a lot to say. Grab a coffee, because this isn’t just a “yay or nay” review, I’m giving you the full lowdown, like I would if we were sitting on my couch swapping makeup horror stories.

# First Impressions & Ingredients

* Price: $40 for 1 fl oz (kinda steep, not gonna lie).
* Cruelty-free, vegan, gluten-free (points there).
* The formula is pretty straightforward: water base, polymers, shea butter, castor seed oil (hello, lash moisture), and the usual preservatives.

What I *do* like: the brand is clear about what’s inside.  
What I *wish*: a little more transparency about the packaging. Like, can I recycle this tube without feeling like I’m just greenwashing myself? No clue.

# The Application Experience

Let me just say: this brush is the star of the show. It’s an hourglass shape that *actually* gets to those pesky inner lashes that usually make me mutter, “why do I even try?”

* The first coat goes on light.
* But it layers… beautifully.
* No sticky tacky weirdness.
* Clumps? Well, yeah, after a couple weeks I started to notice tiny ones. But they brushed out easily, so I wasn’t panicking in the bathroom mirror.

Rating? Solid 5/5 on application.

# Volume Check

If you’re here for big, bold lashes, this is it. Seriously, it gave me “lash extension vibes” without actually gluing anything to my eyelids.

* Subtle look: two swipes, done.
* Dramatic look: keep layering until you feel like a soap opera star.

It’s versatile like that. Big win.

# Length Factor

Here’s where I’m slightly mixed. Yes, my lashes looked longer, soft, and not spidery (praise be). But it’s not the *longest* effect I’ve ever gotten from a mascara. Like, if we’re ranking, it’s a solid B+ in the lengthening category.

Still, it’s tubing mascara, and for that type, it does better than most.

# Wear Test (aka: does it survive my chaos?)

I’ve worn this through:

* 12+ hour days
* Coffee-fueled work sessions
* One emotional movie (don’t ask)

And it didn’t smudge. At all. No raccoon eyes, no weird flakes on my cheeks halfway through the day. And the best part? It *melts off with warm water*. No makeup remover, no scrubbing, no crying in the bathroom at midnight. Just. gone.

As someone with sensitive eyes and contact lenses, this was a *chef’s kiss* moment.

# Final Thoughts

So, is the Sarah Creal Back of the Cab Mascara worth $40?

**Yes** if you want:

**Maybe not** if you:

Personally, I’m impressed. It’s not 100% perfect (the minor clumps after a few weeks and the “not-the-longest” lashes keep it from holy-grail status), but it’s easily one of the best tubing mascaras I’ve tried.",1,1755696637.0,u_Known_Economist_3791,0,1.0,False

1mvestf,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1mvestf/i_broke_up_with_my_ex_bf_of_1_year_f20_m24/,"I broke up with my ex bf of 1 year (F20, M24) because I need to heal, not sure how people who’ve done this navigate these things (advice appreciated) (lengthy story but skip to the last 2 paragraphs if you don’t want to read it all!)","I’m using my old throwaway account for this, praying he doesn’t see this (if you do, please don’t read this). For context, my ex and I started officially dating late August 2024 and ‘broke up’ late May 2025 (we were basically still dating as literally nothing changed relationship wise, idk I was scared and not ready to properly leave him (I was having some mental struggles, too long to explain but please no judgement here), and from then til last night everything stayed the exact same so it’s easier to say we were together a year to shorten it.

Anyways, deep but relevant but I have been in a few relationships before him and they were very unpleasant. From SA, manipulation, gaslighting, threats of them hurting me or themselves, cheating… all that stuff. I’ve been in therapy and strong meds from ages 14-17 to help heal from some childhood sexual trauma which helped a LOT, however only started therapy back up at 19 during my recent ex boyfriend because (who would have thought!) a lot of the unhealed trauma from my ex’s really showed up during that relationship, especially with trust issues and lack of self esteem. I know it sounds so dumb (and it is) but I thought that because I was with my recent ex (who is an amazing man) I could heal with him and thought I’d trust him because he treated me so well. I’ve never been in a loving and healthy relationship so I just assumed that’s how it went. He treated me so well and reassured me when I would rarely open up, but it wasn’t always easy to, which I whole heartedly regret not doing more. I really struggled to trust because him and one of his old friends (they since stopped talking, she turned out to be not very nice but anyways) were still in contact and they had a history together if you catch my drift. They stopped doing so years ago and remained friends but I could never bring myself to trust him no matter how hard I tried. It eventually ate at me every single day, sending me into spirals then eventually lead to me comparing myself to her everyday. I was so scared he still loved her or wanted her, overthought about all that a lot. Whixh he never did anything to make me think that, I’m just not mentally well. He knew I didn’t totally trust/like their relationship so he’d hide the messages from me because when I’d see them texting I’d (regretfully) go cold on him.. not talk for 30 mins, be in a stinky mood for the day etc- however him hiding it from me made me distrust him even more especially due to my past relationships with being cheated on. Understandable on his behalf but I really didn’t like the hiding of it but we have since talked about it and even though they don’t talk anymore, he understands how it made me feel and will do different (if we get back).

Last night I decided we should go no contact until I heal. He is totally onboard with this and is proud of me and supports me for doing what’s best for me. We’re gonna meet up one last time in 3 weeks for I guess one last ‘goodbye’, say things we need to say, return our items etc. It hurts so much but I simply can’t heal in a relationship even though he is literally the best boyfriend I’ve had in every way. I need to work on myself for myself obviously, and also work on my trust issues and past relationships trauma. I’m changing therapists and going to get properly tested and diagnosed and then hopefully back on meds to start the healing journey.

Onto the main part and where I need advice. We both relate that we have never been in love as much as we have eachother, aswell as never felt more comfortable, mattered and cared for than with eachother. I love that man so much and I hope one day we can get back together. We match eachother so well in so many ways (we’re only young, I know but hey). We briefly spoke about it last night before going no contact and on our own personal terms have stated we don’t want to/can’t move on or be with anyone else, we can’t even imagine it. Is it possible for us to find someone else from now and until I’m ready to go back? Yes, anything can happen. Yet neither of us wish for that or have intentions to. He said he is more than happy to wait for me until I’m ready which is so lovely to me, and I really hope remains true. We’ll speak more about it when we see eachother in 3 weeks. Worth mentioning but (depending on how I go) we plan to meet up every 3 months for a coffee for a catch up, but NO texts or calls or location sharing until then.

If anyone reading has encountered this personally (breaking up so one/both can heal and getting back when ready) and it end up POSITIVE, can you please tell me how it went? Was the relationship better when yous got back? Were things the same or different, if so what? Any advice or pointers that could be help for me? I’m just feeling so alone in this situation so hearing other people’s experiences would help me a lot. I know once I’m better I’ll be so happy to get back with him. He’s all I want/need and more. I loved our relationship and our dynamics so much, I just wish I was healed before I met him. Nothing would of lead us to split (yet, at least) if I was just healed enough. I really truly love him and I know he does back.

1mvesi7,https://www.reddit.com/r/HandsOnTech/comments/1mvesi7/explore_best_wireless_earbuds_jbl_tour_pro_3/,Explore Best Wireless Earbuds JBL Tour Pro 3 Smart Case Worth It?,"I’ve been testing the JBL Tour Pro 3 earbuds every single day for the last few weeks, and I have to say, these little gadgets have been a mix of pleasant surprises and tiny frustrations. As someone who constantly shuffles between music, work calls, and podcasts, I need earbuds that can keep up. Here’s what I’ve learned after putting them through their paces.

**Sleek Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that struck me about the JBL Tour Pro 3 is how polished they look. The rounded earpiece tips are thoughtfully designed, providing both comfort and a secure fit. I’ve worn them on runs, in coffee shops, and even during a four-hour flight (thank goodness for their adaptive noise-canceling capabilities), and not once did they feel loose or uncomfortable. The black matte finish gives a minimal yet premium vibe, and the Smart Charging Case is just *chef’s kiss*. The built-in touchscreen on the case isn’t just gimmicky—it genuinely saves you from constantly reaching for your phone. That lock screen showing battery life and notifications felt like a tiny luxury feature I didn’t know I needed.  

**True Adaptive Noise Cancelling for Real-Time Peace**  
One of the standout features for me was the adaptive noise cancellation. I spend a lot of time in noisy environments—bustling cafes, crowded trains, and my eternally barking dog—and the earbuds seemed to handle each with notable ease. Whether it’s tuning out the barista’s noisy grinder or my neighbor’s DIY project, the adaptive noise cancellation adapts to your surroundings in real time. I also really enjoyed customizing how much of the outside world I let in via the JBL Headphones app. It took a little tweaking to find the perfect balance, but once I did, it was a game-changer.  

**Smarter Than Your Average Charging Case**  
The Smart Charging Case is one of the most innovative features I encountered. Besides being a portable charger, it functions as a mini control hub. You can use it to play and pause music, adjust volume, and even check who’s calling—all without pulling your phone out of your pocket. And the case isn't just limited to charging; it doubles as a dongle for AUX and USB-C sources. During a recent flight, I used one of the included cables to plug into the plane’s entertainment system, and suddenly I was enjoying wireless audio with zero fuss. Such convenience deserves a lot of credit!  

[Check JBL Tour Pro 3BLKAM price on Amazon.](https://wirelessemporium.com/check/b0d3633dvb/)  

**Stellar Audio Performance**  
I have to give major props to JBL for the sound quality. The hybrid dual-driver setup in each earbud produces a blend of deep bass and crisp highs. From electronic beats to podcasts, everything sounds superbly balanced. There’s also support for Hi-Res certified audio, which I tested using LDAC on my Android device—pure sonic bliss. Vocals and instruments come through with a level of clarity that makes you sit and appreciate the finer details of your favorite songs. I noticed spatial audio's immersive effect when gaming and streaming movies, with sounds feeling like they were moving around my head according to character positions on the screen.  

**Convenient Battery Life For All-Day Use**  
Battery life was another strong point. You get 40 hours in total, with 10 hours in the earbuds and an additional 30 hours in the case. This is more than enough for those long-haul trips or back-to-back meetings. More impressively, they charged unbelievably fast! Just an 11-minute charge gave me a solid boost of playback time, which saved me during a hectic day when I forgot to charge them overnight.  

**Positives**  
- The Smart Charging Case is a versatile hub for controlling the earbuds.  
- Phenomenal audio clarity with detailed highs and deep bass.  
- Impressive real-time adaptive noise cancellation.  
- Comfortable fit suitable for extended hours of use.   

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The touchscreen on the charging case can feel a bit too sensitive at times.  
- Lack of an audio jack might inconvenience those who still favor wired connections in some settings.  
- Price point feels slightly on the premium side for the features offered.  

**Competing Products**  
In comparing these earbuds to other popular models like the Sony WF-1000XM5 and Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Gen), the JBL Tour Pro 3 sits in a middle-high range. In terms of audio performance, JBL clearly holds its own and sometimes even surpasses Apple’s bass-heavy profile by providing more refined mids. Sony wins the crown for noise cancellation, offering an even more immersive experience than JBL. On the other hand, JBL’s unique Smart Charging Case offers a level of convenience Apple and Sony simply haven’t matched yet. If Bluetooth 5.0 feels slightly dated to you (compared to Sony’s use of 5.3), that’s one area where JBL plays catch-up.  

**Price Worthiness**  
Considering all the bells and whistles packed into these earbuds, I’d say the JBL Tour Pro 3 provides pretty good value for its price. The Smart Charging Case, in particular, feels like an added $50 feature given the functionality it offers. That said, if you’re primarily focused on noise cancellation alone, you might find better alternatives in Sony’s WF line. However, you really pay for an ecosystem of perks here—top-notch audio, customization options, and seamless connectivity, all wrapped in a sleek package.

I put this replacement filter to the test in our trusty family fridge, and it clocked in as an impressive contender in the world of water filtration. Between the flawlessly engineered design and its practical compatibility with various Samsung models, the Waterdrop DA29-00020B had a lot to live up to when unboxing, and it certainly didn’t disappoint — though there’s a bit to consider before diving in. 

**Flawless Design Without Sacrificing Simplicity**

The sleek design of this filter caught my attention right out of the box. The compact size (6.65"" x 2.2"" x 8.98"") made installation a clean, unencumbered process. Its “tool-free and mess-free” claim wasn’t just a marketing platitude, either. Swapping out the old filter for this one was a breeze, which meant I didn’t need to rope in my equally DIY-averse neighbors for moral support. Given its lead-free materials and certifications (NSF 42 and 372), I also felt assured of its safety, which is a necessity when you're trusting it with your drinking water. 

**Performance That Stands Out**

This little device doesn’t just promise cleaner water; it delivers. I ran the filter for several days and noticed a discernible improvement in water taste and clarity almost immediately. It effectively reduces chlorine, odor, and unwanted particles, which was especially appreciated when making morning coffee or sneaking in a glass during late-night fridge raids. By preserving beneficial minerals while whisking away unnecessary impurities, the Waterdrop filter outshines several flimsy alternatives I’ve tried in the past. 

[Find out if Waterdrop DA29-00020B fits your fridge on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b07f9xjxh6/)  

**Favorable Attributes:**
- Quick, no-tools-needed installation process. 
- Certified by reputable standards (NSF 42 & NSF 372). 
- Superior coconut shell carbon block ensures effective filtration for better-tasting water. 
- Fits a wide range of Samsung refrigerator models without leakage issues. 

**Are There Any Shortcomings? Let’s Break It Down.**

While this water filter excels in almost every way, it’s not without its challenges. The most noticeable, for me, was keeping track of replacement timelines. Although the package includes stickers to remind you when to replace the filter, it feels a bit too manual in today’s digital age. Compatibility can also be a hurdle — if you aren’t 100% sure which filter your refrigerator takes, you might find yourself doing some detective work.  

**Areas of Concern:**
- Replacement tracking is sticker-based; a digital alert feature would be handy.  
- Ensuring compatibility with older or less mainstream refrigerator models might require effort. 

**Alternative Offerings in the Market**

It’s easy to pit the Waterdrop DA29-00020B against similar products when it comes to water filters. Popular brands like EveryDrop or FilterLogic offer comparable options, though often at a notably higher price point. In terms of ease of use, Waterdrop’s engineering stood out with its tool-free approach, while competitors occasionally require more effort during installation. Performance-wise, the consistency in taste improvement kept Waterdrop in the lead. However, EveryDrop sometimes has an edge in inclusive compatibility for off-brand refrigerators.  

**Smart Spending or Overhyped? A Cost Efficiency Breakdown**

In terms of cost, this filter is a shining star — especially considering the pack comes with three filter replacements. It checks off numerous boxes: NSF certification, impressive filtration, and thoughtful, user-first design. When you consider the price-to-performance ratio, it offers excellent value for individuals looking to balance quality and affordability. While it may not be the cheapest option per filter, the longevity and reliability make the price entirely fair for what you’re getting: cleaner, better-tasting water without breaking the bank.

I think I'm feeling a bit better, almost no bloating, my stomach does not bother me any more. 

It feels like it's actually digesting stuff, bubbling and flowing, instead of just packing everything down there and keeping me feeling like a stuffed penguin.

Plus I'm avoiding over processed snacks and junk food, gluten and lactose stuff. That perhaps helps too. Drastically reducing alcohol. Stopped smoking. Less coffee.

I was right. Nightmares came back. With a vengeance.

I did go to sleep late cause I was trying to do all the things I could before I went back to completely useless mode.

First part was a long drawn out running around a psych ward. Not any I’ve ever seen. Things I never experienced in this life.

Was awwwful.

Then I was somehow in this competition but the challenges were really difficult. There was a good chance you’d fail I mean. I was terrified because if you didn’t win you would most likely die. But then even if you somehow won, there was a chance you’d also die. So trying to do these difficult tasks, not sure if you want to win or not or if you can. I think I won. No idea what happened after.

At some point another rendition of that but this time I lost. No idea what happened. Did I die or not die? Who fucking knows.

I woke up and I was so groggy and miserable and it was hot, so I moved downstairs to sleep. Cmon asmr….asmr??

I can’t seem to remember what I dreamt about, maybe a wee bit better? Still woke up feeling terrible. At 6 pm.

What can you do when you’re exhausted but sleeping doesn’t really work? I guess you’d say just get up but you see it takes me like 2 or 3 hours before I feel somewhat awake and that whole thing just makes me want to go to sleep. And sometimes I sit at the table with coffee and fall asleep sitting. Not that coffee does anything. (Still doesn’t work, I’m so mad. Those stupid meds made coffee not work and years later it still doesn’t).

So day after day, week after week, you just can’t. You’re just so tired so you sleep the whole day hoping for even a little bit of rest.

They are utter psychopaths. Always going on about how sleep is important but when I mention the nightmares, nothing. Zilch. It’s been like 3 months of this? Really? Feels longer.

Probably one of the reasons my cortisol is high.

Anyway, that’s all I did today.

I did eat something despite the effort (no seriously, I have to check each item I take out, every step, moved it to the fridge…closed the fridge etc.)

Even just getting ice is sooo much work. Sometimes I think I’m so lazy but then I think how easy is it for most people? They don’t have to check a thing..

Hmm. Just had a thought. Most people don’t check every step which means they are not present for each step which means they could be on automatic and not remember doing the task later. (My mom)

So maybe tracking each single step is a way to not only make sure I didn’t miss anything or not do anything but also remember later in case I need to go over it again. To feel safe. To be sure I did everything and can’t get in trouble for not doing something right.

I kinda suspected this before. Something about being able to remember later. Making sure I do every step of the task. If you did it automatically, you wouldn’t.

I went outside with a cup of milk lol and treats.

“I came here to drink milk and kick ass. And I’m all out of milk.” Looool

When I saw that advert I just about died of excitement.  That is one of the best British shows ever made.

The IT Crowd season 4

I wish they’d made a million more but the British are all about quality over quantity. They stop before it gets old. But I don’t think that show would ever get old.

Anyway, I come out with Soph and there’s the Regmeister. He noticed the treats and got impatient.

So I did what I normally do, one for her and one for him. But he’s so vicious I had to give him his first or else he’d go after hers. So I did that, was fine but then soph’s treat landed too close and he ate it before her. And I felt so bad. She was acting all quiet and shy just like when she was at the cat sanctuary. I think it triggered her. I felt so bad I triggered her.

I gave her hers and continued and then put them away. Reg was like looking around seeing if he could find more. I dunno if maybe he never gets treats. I know he likes junky cat food but still. The impatience was weird. 

(So apparently his people try to give him good quality cat food but cats don’t really like it (ask me how I know lol - cat sanctuary - they tried to switch to better canned food but cats wouldn’t eat any of it). I think maybe if the cat never tried the addictive junk food maybe it would work but once they know, they know). Maybe they started him out on good quality food but he’s a little tramp and went everywhere and people gave him treats and worse quality cat food so now hes addicted to the junky cat food. That’s my theory anyway. Aww, no wonder they were telling people to not feed him. Dang, I’m responsible there.)

A couple times a treat bag accidentally got left outside and reg annihilated it. Got it open and ate so many treats.

Well I started leaving out the wet food that Soph didn’t eat (a lot of times she doesn’t eat it, goes to waste). And Reggie comes and eats it all.

But maybe I shouldn’t have done that.

Now when the door is open he tries to sneak in and eat her leftover food. Which I think bothers her lol

Dang, I never realized till now that I was adding to the problem. I figured he would go elsewhere and get treats/ food but who knows.

Anyway, when he left the yard, I told Soph that it’s ok, she’s not at the sanctuary, he’s gone and it’s her yard. I dunno if it works but maybe.

She meowed so I gave her treats on her own quietly (I was worried he would hear the bag and show up). And she seemed happier.

And what do you know, there he is, coming back.

He saw something in the blackberry and ran over and like stared. So Soph ran over nearby and stared. So then I came over and stared too. lol yea I’m a cat

I don’t know what he saw or heard cause I heard nothing.

Went inside and fell asleep again cause something made me extremely worn out.

I should’ve had better dreams right? Nah.

So anyway, it’s 4 am already and mom is going shopping at 9 so I guess I’m staying up.

How are you?

How is life?

I miss you.

I want to grab an air mattress and put it on the grass and lie on it. Would be nice if you could join me. Look at the stars… I’ll just look at you cause my glasses (both pairs) are stuck.

I could look at you for hours.

Memorizing every detail

I don’t see people in my mind for some reason but I wish I could see you

I wish I could kiss all of you

I wish I could play with your hair and soothe your scalp

Apparently brushing/combing/scalp massages do calm you significantly

I wish I could fall into you and run my hands over you

But maybe you should lie on me, I’m heavier

I don’t mean to go there but somehow when I think about it it goes there as well

Which honestly is strange, you know how I am and I’m in an iffy place too

I love you babe

I just want to be near you

Hold you

Get you some sleep

Do you know there is a complex of coffee shops like 2-3 blocks from the apartment? I could go out and get you anything before you wake up.

I want to be there so bad.

If you’re lying in bed right now, imagine me there, rubbing your shoulder and playing with your hair and anything else you want.

I’m gonna get lost in fantasies again lol

Shhh

I think about you more than you realize

I ache for you more than you think

I dream of a life with you and I worry about losing you

No amount of time could ever be enough for me

I’d always want more

More of you

You can bet that when I finally have you I’m never letting go

Sorry

Sorry if this makes things harder

I don’t want to make your life harder

I’ll wait however long it takes

Baby, you won’t lose me

Even if somehow something happens (but I don’t foresee that) I’m staying in your life. I’m always there for you

Besties

Honestly, it would probably be a temporary thing cause we always come back to each other

And I’d wait for you to come back

I can’t live without you either

I need your presence, I need your heart

I need You

Sorry gotten all sappy

I’m just really missing you

You don’t need to be healed babe

I can take it

You already put up with so much from me, it’s just my turn

Don’t worry about hurting me

We will work through it

Every little thing

Believe it or not but the fights we’ve had in this way were useful

I think I’m more able to handle being misunderstood now

I can handle it and even if I can’t, I’ll get better at handling it

I want to be there for you

I want to help you heal

I love you

Monday I noticed the pendulum may be swinging to the other side as I became really horny which is one of my most telltale signs of hypo. Tuesday morning I woke after only four hours of sleep and I was like YUP,  hypo rn. 

Anyway, I started my day with a client then get to the office and I’m super focused. I’m always kind of in a rush when I’m there bc I like to make it obvious that I’m super busy to try to avoid engaging with a SUPER chatty coworker. So I’m just vibing, acting more busy than I actually am, and then the dial just INTENSIFIES and suddenly the hypo fills my head like I drank too much coffee (haven’t had a drop of caffeine since last weekend) and it’s all hitting me at once. I felt fucking JUICED. And also sorta panicky cus I was like this shit ain’t normal. 

Within an hour of being at the top of the tops with this feeling, I started coming down and the next hour I CRASHED. Felt like the four hours of sleep was catching up with me, but my mind still felt static-y with the residual hypo. I ended my day seeing another client and was super engaged, but honestly nothing too out of the ordinary as I can be a very social person normally/not hypo. 

This intense HIGH THEN FALL in such a SHORT amount of time….maybe I’ve experienced this before my diagnosis and before meds? But since my diagnosis in January and finally being on the proper meds, no. 

The antipsychotic I’m on is a pretty low dose because I complained of my low sex drive and feeling really numb. To me, just a little bit of hypo is okay because I have my libido back but I’m not out of control and I can feel emotions again without becoming overwhelmed by them. The bursts of energy are a plus too. IS THIS CRAZY??? Has anyone else experienced their hypo and crash in such a compressed amount of time?",1,1755695992.0,bipolar2,0,1.0,False
1mveks1,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecideWise/comments/1mveks1/genuinepurity_nmn_supplement/,GenuinePurity NMN supplement,"I went down the NMN rabbit hole a few months ago, tried powders, sublingual tabs, regular capsules from a handful of brands, and honestly most of them felt the same or gave me mild stomach grumbles. The one that stood out was [GenuinePurity NMN](https://nmn.genuinepurity.com/ct/26881?t1=DecideWise). Two reasons jumped out right away, they post third-party testing for purity, and their capsules use a liposomal delivery, so the NMN is wrapped in lipids that are supposed to help absorption and be gentler on the gut. Subjectively, it was the only one that gave me steadier daytime energy without the jittery vibe, and zero GI drama.

I kept the rest of my routine steady for a few weeks, sleep, coffee, workouts, and swapped only the NMN. With GenuinePurity, I noticed fewer afternoon crashes and I felt less beat after long runs and lifts, which is the kind of small but real change I look for with any supplement. I also liked the little quality of life things, veggie caps, no weird smell, easy to store at room temp, and a clear label. The 97-day money-back guarantee is a nice safety net if you are testing it on your own schedule.

Couple of practical notes, I had the best results taking one capsule with breakfast, not close to bedtime, since NAD precursors can feel a bit alerting for some people. If you already take other supplements, especially niacin or other B vitamins, stack carefully to avoid overlap. And, usual disclaimer, talk to your clinician if you have medical conditions or are on meds, because data in humans is still early and you want to keep an eye on the whole picture.

Bottom line, after trying a bunch, GenuinePurity NMN felt like the most dialed in option, clean certificate of analysis, liposomal form that agreed with my stomach, and the most noticeable day to day effect. It is not a miracle pill, but if you are NMN curious and want a low hassle, higher quality pick, this is the one I would buy again.",3,1755695918.0,DecideWise,0,1.0,False
1mvekhb,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlugInWellness/comments/1mvekhb/explore_if_seventh_generation_disinfectant_wipes/,Explore If Seventh Generation Disinfectant Wipes Truly Kill Germs,"Testing out the Seventh Generation SG-068 disinfecting wipes has been quite an interesting experience, and I must admit, they’ve worked their way into my household routine quite seamlessly. These wipes come in a pack of three, with 70 wipes per container, and the Lemongrass Citrus scent is surprisingly pleasant and refreshing—not too overpowering like some cleaning products can be. Designed to kill 99.99% of bacteria and viruses, they’ve become a go-to for quickly cleaning up everything from kitchen counters to bathroom surfaces. They’re also kid- and pet-safe, which is a massive bonus for a household like mine.

**Practical Design and Easy-to-Use Packaging**  
The container design makes these wipes incredibly easy to grab and use. The lid opens and closes securely, so the wipes don’t dry out, which is something I’ve had issues with when using other brands. The wipes themselves are thick, sturdy, and the perfect size for tackling a wide range of surfaces without tearing or getting scrunched up. While cleaning my TV remote one day, I appreciated the no-rinse feature, especially because I didn’t have to go back and wipe it down after disinfecting.

**Convenience Meets Performance**  
Having these on hand makes mess-cleaning ridiculously easy. I’ve used them on everything from spilled coffee on the table to sticky countertops after a few “creative” lunch experiments by my kids. They manage to pick up dirt and grime effectively while disinfecting at the same time. I’ve even tested them on high-touch areas like doorknobs and light switches, and the peace of mind knowing they’re germ-free has been reassuring. Since they’re EPA-registered and safe for food-contact surfaces, I don’t think twice before using them on my chopping board or my toddler’s high chair.

[Find the best price for Seventh Generation SG-068 on Amazon.](https://sanue.com/p/b01gjkfktk/)

**Good Aspects**  
- Handy for both light touch-ups and tougher cleaning jobs  
- Can be used safely on children’s toys and pacifiers  
- Made with Thymol, which is derived from thyme oil  
- Lovely Lemongrass Citrus scent that doesn’t overpower  
- Secure packaging prevents the wipes from drying out  

**Limitations**  
- The scent, while lovely, may not appeal to everyone  
- Thick residues might appear on glass surfaces like windows  
- Sometimes require more than one wipe to clean larger areas  

**Durability of the Product**  
The wipes’ quality is something worth mentioning. Unlike thinner alternatives I’ve tried in the past, these ones don’t fall apart midway through cleaning. They’re moist enough to handle sticky messes without needing constant replacements, making a single container last significantly longer than I initially expected. That said, they may not be the most effective choice for large, heavily soiled areas, as each wipe handles only so much before losing its cleaning power.

**Eco-Conscious Cleaning Made Simple**  
One of my favorite things about these wipes is their eco-conscious approach. As someone who tries to make sustainable choices, I appreciate the effort to use botanical ingredients and essential oils. However, while they’re labeled as eco-friendly and suitable for food surfaces, I did wonder about the overall waste factor of using disposable wipes regularly. In this sense, I reserve them mostly for situations that truly require disinfection rather than as an all-purpose cleaner.

**Product Rivals**  
Compared to competing brands like Lysol or Clorox wipes, these feel a bit more thoughtful in terms of environmental impact and scent profile. I’ve used Lysol wipes in the past, and while they’re effective disinfectants, the chemical smell can be overwhelming. Clorox wipes are another strong competitor, but they tend to dry out faster once the container is opened. Seventh Generation’s wipes strike a balance—they disinfect effectively, smell pleasant, and the packaging keeps the product fresh longer. That said, if you need high-powered degreasing capabilities, other brands might be a better fit.

**Smart Spending**  
In terms of cost, these wipes feel like a solid investment for what they offer. The combination of a plant-based formula, effective cleaning power, and safe usage around kids and pets makes them worth the splurge compared to generic supermarket brands that lack the same level of quality and versatility. While they’re not the cheapest option on the market, they certainly deliver value for the price.

I recently launched my small business, EverBloom Designs, about two months ago. I sell original designs on t-shirts (adult and toddler sizes), coffee mugs, and journals, with plans to expand once I become profitable. My designs center around positive, inspiring sayings, mostly geared toward young adults, women, and moms.

I’m considering adding some trendy phrases or styles to draw in new customers, hoping they’ll discover and connect with my original designs once they land on my site. Right now, I’m working with a tight budget and limited free time, so I’m focusing on Instagram as my main marketing channel—sharing products through flat lays and lifestyle photos whenever I can squeeze in a moment.

I’ve gotten a few likes and followers, but no sales yet. I know my brand is still in its early stages, but I’d love your help figuring out how to move from interest to actual purchases.

I’d really appreciate your thoughts on:

- My designs—do they feel fresh, relatable, and visually appealing?
- The overall look and feel of my Etsy shop
- My Instagram posts—especially the flat lays and lifestyle photos
- What would make you trust and buy from a brand like mine?
- Any tips for making the most of limited time to boost visibility and sales

**Chapter III**

**Pursuit**

The first day Astral spent hunting for daemons he turned up more than a few hidden monsters in the city. They tried to fight back but were quickly sent to Hell as soon as they showed their heads. Most were willing to spill anything to get away from Astral’s pursuit, but he was focused and their hollow pleas fell on deaf ears. He spent his days and nights in constant pursuit of the tell-tale tingle on his spine, desperate to find any lead as to why Casterum was willing to come after Ukiko, knowing it would provoke an all out war response from Astral. None of them knew anything though, so he would sleep in internet cafes or rent a room at a tube hotel for a few hours and then pursue his targets once more. He did this for three days with no contact with his family. He was nearing the end of his willingness to continue when he was stopped in the night by a floating ember that grew and puffed itself up in frustration. The Kami of Mount Fuji had left its home to find him.

“I’m searching.” Astral said, “They went after my family, it’s personal now.” 

The Kami shook itself violently as it had no distinct neck or head, merely a rounded and burning form. It pointed in a direction and snapped and crackled at him.

“I know you can speak.” Astral sighed.

“This way!” The Kami said, “They hide together, we found them through the blood they spilled.” 

Astral blinked, “But...” He paused, “It wasn’t Casterum that attacked her.” 

The Kami blinked, “They do not have the smell of new bodies or blood.” 

Astral shook his head, more than slightly confused. “Lead on.” 

The Kami ascended and waved for Astral to follow and the Nephilim did so. He followed the burning ember in the night until it rested on a dockside warehouse, over a window and tried to open in. Astral chuckled as he slid it open and both slipped in. Astral perched the ember on his shoulder and descended to the levels of high shelves and storage cases. As Astral looked down he saw a table with three men playing a game of poker. One was Casterum and the other two were other daemon-knights. The first one he noticed was a slobish and slovenly possessed man with pustules and boils over his body, he served Baalzebub, more commonly known to the world as Beelzebub. The other was a buff man with a tanned mediterranean skin tone and clothes stained in blood and viscera, Astral’s best guess was this one served Leviathan as they preferred mass and muscle to skill. Astral waited and listened to the daemon-knights before he made his move.

“Nephilim’s on the move Cas.” The Leviathan Daemon-Knight grumbled, “He got to see the botched site.” 

“But he’s been going the wrong direction. He’s only been hunting for Cas.” The Baalzebub Daemon-Knight chuckled. 

Casterum barely looked at his cards, “He thinks I went after his woman. Like I’m that much of an idiot. But if it pulls him off you two for a bit, I can take the heat.” He put forward a few of their drachmas. “I bet two, what about your botched ritual though, what happened Shrithe?” He glared at the slovenly of the two daemon-knights. 

“Oh, big spender.” Shrithe chuckled, “Ah, some lady got her leg freed. Yurich had to kill her separately from the ritual, ruining everything. The neophytes can’t tie proper knots it seems.” 

Yurich, the large Daemon-Knight nodded and spoke with a Greek accent. “I came to help bolster the forces here since you lost the last batch.” The Kami seemed to float above this daemon-knight’s head while it remained oblivious of the small spirit.

“Yakuza fucked that up.” Casterum grumbled, “Their former patriarch found several shipments, turned it over to the tengu and Astral butted his head in with the Fallen.” 

“Using the Nephilim’s name, someone must be impressed.” Shrithe chuckled.

“He beat Mammon. Maybe not in a straight fight, but he still ruined a carefully laid out plan. Only reason I got back as fast as I did was that Mammon wants me to pick away at him.” Casterum chuckled. “I admit it’s a fun game, but he’s getting stronger, and he’s learning how to actually fight us. It’s only a matter of time before he learns how to kill one of us.” 

Yurich nodded, “Either way, we have a backup bunch for the next ritual.” 

Astral had heard more than enough and dove off the edge of the shelves. He didn’t make a sound, he just unfurled his wings and drove his fist into the back of the Leviathan Daemon-Knight’s skull and it shattered like a glass orb as his fist broke the poker table and stunned the other two Daemon-Knights. Astral watched the Daemon-Knight’s body twist and crackle as its host body deformed back to its normal mass and slowly melted like old snow on a spring day. The fire of the Kami, purifying the broken body as the daemon was expunged. Shrithe shrieked and fled on four legs like a wild beast.

Astral went to pursue him, but Casterum grabbed him by his neck and tossed him out a nearby window. Astral rolled as he landed and popped back up, ready to go. Casterum walked right through the wall and produced his Hell-Blade.

“Now that was something!” Casterum cackled, “That’s gonna set us back _months_. I love it.” 

“You need to stay away from my family.” Astral growled.

“Eh?” Casterum stopped and looked around in confusion. “It wasn’t me, Star-boy. I want you at full strength before I tear you apart in front of them all.” Casterum growled, “Besides, she’s just a human, it’s not worth my effort to use her to get to you when I can just find you...” He rushed up to Astral and raised his blade high and kicked Astral down the docks. 

Astral rolled again and watched Casterum take his time on the approach. Astral believed the daemon-knight, he was always very forward about what he wanted. That meant he had to get information from the Baalzebub Daemon-Knight, he quickly stood and started to dash off, but Casterum grabbed him and threw him back towards the warehouse.

“Do yourself a favor Nephilim.” Casterum flicked his arm and the Hell-Blade vanished, “Get a clue, because none of us went after your woman. She’s not worth the effort for us to attack, though she did kill one of us, so that might change things.” Casterum clapped his hands and grew great bloody wings that he used to fly away.

Astral watched the daemon-knight flee and grunted as he came to the only remaining conclusion he could come to; another daemon had set up in Japan. He spread his wings and began the flight back home. He was going to need some ice packs tonight.

**(\o/)-(\o/)-(\o/)**

Astral wandered in just as Lucifer was putting something in the oven for dinner.

“Well he’s back.” Lucifer called out.

Ukiko and Ariane came rushing to Astral and both grabbed him into a hug. 

“Yeah, sorry about not calling.” Astral sighed.

“You’re safe, that’s all that matters.” Ukiko smiled as she leaned over and grabbed his coat and handed it back.

“Yeah, probably should have kept this. Coffin hotels have crappy sheets.” Astral blew a raspberry.

“Take a hot shower and burn those clothes.” Lucifer called out. “Three days and I can smell you from the kitchen stove.” 

Astral laughed and nodded.

“Rain check on the movie?” Ukiko asked, “I think we both need it.” 

Astral, again, nodded. 

“Can I go play my game with Kira?” Ariane asked.

“Game?” Astral asked.

“Kira’s been keeping her busy with a racing game. Turns out Ariane is very good at it.” Ukiko smiled.

“Blue shells!” Ariane laughed and ran into the other room.

Astral smiled and bumped his forehead to Ukiko’s. “I’m gonna shower, then maybe actually burn these clothes, then we need to talk about the attack.” 

Ukiko nodded.

“I’ll make the tea.” Lucifer said with a heavy sigh.

Thirty minutes later Astral was walking out in a fresh set of clothes and a towel around his neck. His hair was a mass of untamed and uncontrolled hair. Once he sat down at the counter Ukiko pulled out her brush and began to brush his hair back. He had to stare at her for a moment, but she just gave him a frustrated look and he shrugged and let her continue.

“My god, that was beautiful.” Lucifer laughed, “An entire conversation without words.” 

Astral laughed, “Yeah. But I found something interesting. It wasn’t Casterum or his allies.” 

“Allies?” Lucifer blinked.

“Baalzebub and Leviathan, but that’s not the important bits.” Astral sighed, “There’s a fourth one in Japan. Whoever it is, that’s who attacked Ukiko.” 

Lucifer nodded and seemed very confused. “Well, Ukiko, what do you remember about your attacker? Any details can help.” 

Ukiko took a moment to sip her tea and closed her eyes to focus. “He wouldn’t take off his glasses. Once I knocked them away his face grew a vertical mouth on his nose.” She opened her eyes and focused on the fridge for a moment. “He had golden eyes, and they were black instead of white.” 

Lucifer paused and looked at Astral with concern.

Astral let out a whistle. 

“What?” Ukiko asked. “Is that, like an Abbadon daemon?” 

“That sounds like an Asmodean.” Astral nodded.

“Let’s not jump to conclusions, they’re the last thing we need up here.” Lucifer laughed nervously.

“Asmodean?” Ukiko asked.

“Sin of Lust, and before you jump to conclusions, no they are not like any and every hentai series.” Astral explained, “Asmodean daemons are body horror incarnate. They’re masters of bio-mass manipulation, body twisters.”

“Can’t all daemons do that?” Ukiko clarified.

“When a Mammon or Leviathan daemon does it they have to kill a human to absorb the biomass, or pick up a random corpse. An Asmodean just drags a living person into the twisted mass, they power themselves by tormenting any and every soul they can. More Dante’s definition of Lust’s punishment than anything. I think they may even have been inspired by him.” Astral explained and quickly and gently grabbed her shoulder as she nervously sat down.

“I’m fine, but that puts everything in a terrifying new perspective.” Ukiko groaned.

“And Casterum’s made not so subtle threats about going after you now that you’ve taken a daemon out.” Astral sighed, “I don’t see him doing it though, not unless it's for something other than getting to me.” 

Kira shouted from the other room and Ariane yelped  but there was a moment of silence before she walked into the kitchen with Ariane. 

“Please tell me dinner is soon.” Kira groaned. “I can’t take losing to this _dorozhnyy d'yavol_.” 

Ariane giggled, “I got the blue shell again.” 

Astral snorted.

“Should be ready.” Lucifer nodded.

“So how has your training been the past few days? I doubt Lucifer let you just rest.” Astral asked.

Kira rolled her eyes, “Fine, except the daemons kept running away.” 

“True, they were, but I’m going to put that on Astral’s warpath terrifying them.” Lucifer confirmed for the Nephilim.

“No, I doubt that, they got scarce after day two for me.” Astral frowned and groaned. “Yeah, once dinner’s done, I’m crashing in my own bed so I can think clearly.”

“A good idea.” Lucifer said, “I’ve made some actually good Salisbury steaks.” 

Astral blinked and looked at the Fallen Angel. “You fancified it, didn’t you?”

Lucifer frowned, “There was a day it was fancy.” 

Astral laughed and shook his head. “Well, I’m not gonna argue.” 

He got up and sat down at his seat at the table and waited for food. The others soon joined him with Ariane pulling out a series of cards she had begun collecting for a game. Astral felt his mind glaze over as she went on to talk about the adorable monsters on her cards.

**(\o/)-(\o/)-(\o/)**

Astral was at the kitchen table a few days later, his knuckles were sore from over exerting himself practicing on his punching bag and he had a bag of ice on them. He was, for the time, enjoying the days at home, not wanting to leave the house unprotected. That had to come to an end soon though, he knew it, he just couldn’t justify staying inactive when the daemons had gone quiet. The Kami had also calmed down since Astral had pulverized the Leviathan Daemon-Knight. His mind was stuck on that meeting as Lucifer walked in and put some groceries on the counter, the Fallen had taken to making sure his new family was properly fed and mostly taken over cooking duties, though he made sure to teach everyone a few things.

“You look like I did when I learned the dodo went extinct.” Lucifer said as he put away some vegetables.

“Sorry, thinking about that meeting I busted up.” Astral sighed. “Can I run it by you?”

Lucifer nodded as he continued to put food away.

“So I was perched above them all, this little fire Kami that I am ninety-nine percent sure is Mount Fuji’s dormant Kami, well it circled around this daemon knight. Big muscular Mediterranean type.” Astral sighed. “I crushed his skull with a surprise attack, but he was a daemon-knight. Leviathan, I think.”

“Leviathan you say? I wouldn’t worry too much, the power of the Daemon Prince of Envy has waned greatly since the arrival of the Rana and the Purge. Turns out having another species that can share your genes and your own fears tends to shatter a lot of xenophobic world views, specifically those that rely on expansion and a united enemy breeds more familiarity.”

“Makes sense, but I ended him.” Astral sighed, “It was too easy. Especially since they were all meeting to discuss their plans on converting people via that ritual.” 

“Yes, Baalzebub’s leftenant is more my concern. He and Mammon do not get along.” Lucifer put away three boxes of the same cereal.

“Fruity Hoops?” Astral tilted his head.

“Someone, I suspect Kira, is eating them all like they’re a vanishing treasure.” Lucifer scoffed. “So I got more so I could have some.” 

Astral snorted, “Good luck.” 

“Astral, if those three were working together then you’ve disrupted their peace keeper.” Lucifer smiled gently, “Leviathan’s Daemon-knight would have had to be the enforcer of peace.” 

Astral breathed a sigh of relief.

“You had a case you were obsessing over. Look into that one for a bit. Relax with normal work.” Lucifer advised, “I’ll even make us a nice simple dinner tonight so you don’t have to worry about it.” 

“I was going to make some of that mac and cheese yakisoba.” Astral shrugged. “And I don’t obsess.” 

“You do...” Lucifer flung open the cupboards until he found the offending meal box and tossed it in the trash. “...And I’m sorry, its existence is an offense to culinary practices the world over.” 

“That was Ukiko’s.” Astral warned.

“She can bill me.” Lucifer huffed.

Astral smirked and stood up to stretch and yawned. “Still curious what made them work together.” 

“Power brokering, dividing up countries.” Lucifer shrugged, “Any number of possibilities, but we do not have the information needed to determine the answer.” 

“What if they finally just realized they would get further working together?” Astral asked.

“They’re aware, it’s their own natures that prevent that. Similar to how an Asmodean will always give itself away in time.” Lucifer advised.

“Yeah.” Astral paused, “You think it was one?” 

Lucifer stopped and slumped a little. “The last time one came up from those twisted bowels it killed over two thousand people before taking a Fallen with it back to hell.” 

“I’m sorry.” Astral winced.

“The worst part is I think she did something to negate it but I can’t tell because I can’t remember her name or her position and it’s not due to time. It’s like she never was.” Lucifer sighed, “We aren’t going to get anywhere if we just sit here discussing it. I’m going to get the rest of this put away.” 

Astral nodded and went to his room and pulled up his work connection and logged onto his work computer remotely. He began to open the documents and videos associated with “Tumbler” and their various crimes. The Interpol chats dedicated to the cases were dead silent for now, the thief's trail had gone cold again, possibly indicating they had left Japan. 

Astral sighed and opened the folders and reviewed the cases. Each one was logically a perfect crime with no feasible scientific explanation. It’s what was leading most investigators to expect Tumbler to be a practitioner of some magical prowess. Astral wasn’t as convinced, there was something off about the scenes, something his mind wouldn’t let go of that screamed this wasn’t a case of magic. Potentially a mutant, yes, but Magic left specific evidence that no scene had reported. Magic impacted the world around it in ways that scarred reality when used to get the results of these thefts. There was something everyone was missing, but he wasn’t sure what it was.

He was looking at the video a French Investigator had made on his visit to Japan to investigate the second theft in Japan. The video panned to the left then the right as the investigator had almost stepped on some broken glass from the glass case that had held a special safe with a special chemical formula that would have revolutionized plastics yet again. Astral paused as he looked at the broken glass, it had fallen outside of the safe’s containment area. He zoomed in and the shape was half of a perfectly cut circle. He quickly jumped to the notes that every investigator had reviewed and none of them seemed to notice the broken glass was on the wrong side, in fact most had assumed the containment area was broke and those that hadn’t were simply silent.  

Astral watched more of the video before going to a 3-D layout of the room. The containment pillar for the safe was housed in a twenty five millimeter thick pane of specially treated glass that warped line of sight and prevented most teleportation. He wasn’t sure why he searched what he did, but he pulled up the Charter-Interpol database and looked up mercenaries with unusual teleportation capabilities. He immediately discounted Deathless as that manic would not have remained quiet. He did focus on another one though; Eye Spy. Eye Spy was estimated to be seventeen and believed to be the niece of fellow mercenary ChemBurn. She was able to produce multiple eyes in various sizes and move herself and others through them as if they were doors. Astral looked at the dimensions between the pillar and glass, it was just enough room that a super slim individual could slip in and move around if they had a way in. Astral went to the notes and typed up a suggestion to look into the possibility of DNA traces from Eye Spy as her eyes would decay, but leave behind traces. 

He leaned back and waited for any response. It came a few minutes later from the French Interpol offices. “Les fils de pute.” was the only response from the French. The rest of the European Interpol Investigators responded with stunned acceptance that they had missed such an obvious clue. The Japanese investigators were all too happy to applaud Astral and offer to run the tests as soon as they could. 

Astral leaned back and laughed. It wasn’t solved and might not lead anywhere but he had provided a new clue to the teams and it felt amazing to get that annoying buzz in his brain to shut off for a few minutes. 

He paused and muttered, “Crap, I do obsess...” He just wasn’t stupid enough to admit it near Lucifer.

Then his phone rang and Kira’s school office number was on the caller ID.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Oakland Athletics vs. Minnesota Twins: A Tale of Frosty Efficiency and Hot Streaks**

The Minnesota Twins (-131) and Oakland Athletics (+110) clash in a battle of baseball’s version of “hot and cold.” Let’s break this down with the precision of a MLB closer and the humor of a解说员 who’s had one too many ballpark hot dogs.

**Parsing the Odds: The Math of Misery and Mastery**  
The Twins, favored at -131, have an implied probability of \~56.7% to win. Historically, they’ve backed this up, winning 60.5% of games when similarly favored. The Athletics (+110, \~47.6% implied) have a paltry 40.3% win rate as underdogs this season. Translation: The Twins are the reliable Netflix show you know won’t cancel you; the A’s are that show you binged once and forgot about.

Offensively, the Twins rank 23rd in runs per game (4.2), which is like a slow-drip coffee maker—uninspiring but dependable. Their pitching staff, however, strikes out 8.6 batters per nine innings, making them the MLB’s most polite crowd at a karaoke bar: “*Strikeout! Strikeout! Strikeout!*” The Athletics, meanwhile, boast a potent 12th-ranked offense (566 runs) and a .254 team average. But their pitching? Let’s just say it’s “adventurous,” like a toddler given a box of crayons.

**Digesting the News: Injuries, Streaks, and Shea Langeliers’ Midseason Magic**  
The A’s are riding the magic of Shea Langeliers, who’s hit 27 homers this year—15 since the All-Star break. He’s the baseball version of a vending machine that only spits out winning scratch-off tickets. Add in Tyler Soderstrom’s 17-game hitting streak (he’s the “I’ll take a swing at anything” of the lineup) and Nick Kurtz’s 3-for-3 heroics from Tuesday, and the A’s offense looks like a loaded slot machine.

But here’s the catch: The Twins’ pitching staff might be the “pul

1mved7u,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricBikeReviews/comments/1mved7u/explore_the_marknig_electric_bike_review_is_this/,Explore the MarKnig Electric Bike Review Is This 500W Ebike Worth It?,"Testing the MarKnig Electric Bicycle (model B0F1CJLK6B) has been quite the adventure. This electric bike for adults promises the perfect blend of power and practicality, with standout features like its 500W motor, 40-mile range under pedal-assist, and robust 432Wh removable battery. The specs are impressive on paper, but how does it fare when taken out on the road? Here’s my firsthand experience.

**Design and Build Quality**

The first thing that struck me about this electric bicycle was its sleek and sturdy design. It's built with a carbon steel frame, which gives it a decently lightweight feel while maintaining durability. The vibrant blue color adds a nice pop, making it an eye-catching ride. I also appreciated the 26-inch non-slip tires, which feel right at home on various terrains, including city streets, gravel paths, and even more rugged trails.

You’ll need to do some basic assembly when this bike arrives since it comes 85% pre-assembled. Luckily, the setup process was straightforward, thanks to the included tool kit and an easy-to-follow installation video online. Personally, I found the task mildly therapeutic, though my neighbor tried to bribe me with coffee to assemble hers.  

[Discover if MarKnig B0F1CJLK6B is on sale at Amazon.](https://expertbiking.com/p/b0f1cjlk6b/)

**Performance and Motor Power**

I was seriously blown away by how powerful this 500W motor is. The electric bike has no problem accelerating smoothly up to its top speed of 20MPH, which is fantastic for urban commutes or weekend adventures. Climbing steep hills was surprisingly easy—it eats up inclines like nobody's business. A friend tried it on rugged gravel terrain, and it performed equally well without losing traction, thanks to the design and the sturdy tires.

Equipped with five pedal-assist modes, the bike caters to different preferences. I toggled between modes depending on whether I wanted an energetic cycling workout or a relax-mode cruise. Pure electric mode made my lazy days feel guilt-free while pedaling with full power assist made cycling far more enjoyable than I expected.

**Battery Efficiency**

Spending hours riding was a breeze due to the removable 36V 12A lithium battery. Charging took approximately 5 hours using the upgraded 2A fast-charge feature, which is on par with similar bikes I’ve tested. The battery is housed securely in the frame but detaches easily for off-bike charging—a feature I find incredibly convenient. An average ride had me covering close to 37-38 miles on mostly pedal-assist mode, which fits the brand’s advertised claims.

For someone like me who often messes up forgetting to charge electronics, the real-time battery indicator on the full-color LED display was exceptionally helpful. One glance at the screen tells me everything from the current charge level to riding speed and assistance mode.

**Comfort and Ergonomics**

The adjustable seat height is crucial, especially since I’m on the taller side, and it was easy to tailor it for a comfortable ride. Even with an hour-long spin, there wasn’t much strain on my back. The front suspension helped absorb shocks when passing over bumps, making long rides enjoyable.

I did find the kickstand useful for parking, especially when stopping to grab quick groceries. Little details like the accompanying bell made navigating through my busy cycling group both functional and fun.

**Highlights**

- Smooth acceleration and reliable 500W motor.
- Flexible 21-speed system for diverse terrain adaptability.
- Impressive 40-mile range in pedal-assist mode.
- Convenient fast-charging removable battery.
- Easy-to-use full-color LED display showing speed, battery life, and distance.  

**Areas for Improvement**

- At high speeds, the bike’s weight becomes noticeable, making sharp turns slightly challenging.  
- The lack of a rear light might disappoint nighttime riders, although this can be fixed with add-ons.  
- The full throttle mode drains battery faster, so relying heavily on it isn’t ideal for longer rides.  

**Competing Products**

When compared to other e-bikes like the RadCity model and Ancheer electric bicycles, this bike stands out for its hill-climbing power and manageable weight. The RadCity may have more advanced braking systems, but it's heavier and comes at a higher price point. Ancheer models, while a bit more budget-friendly, often sacrifice battery efficiency and terrain versatility, especially on gravel or inclines. This bike strikes a great middle ground between affordability, feature set, and ease of use, which makes it appealing for diverse cycling needs.

**Price Performance**

Speaking of affordability, the price tag is neither exorbitant nor bargain-basement. It lands comfortably within the range of similar products offering comparable specs, though its power-packed features like the LED display and multi-level pedal assist justify the cost. If you’re after a reliable e-bike that performs consistently across different settings, this bike is indeed a smart spending choice.

1mvece5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1mvece5/discover_if_the_quqiyso_copper21_french_press/,Discover if the QUQIYSO Copper-21 French Press Coffee Maker Lives Up to Reviews,"The QUQIYSO Copper-21 Coffee Maker has become my go-to choice for brewing coffee every morning, thanks to its efficient design and impressive performance. As someone who enjoys experimenting with different brewing methods, I was instantly intrigued by this 304 stainless steel French press. The promise of a sleek copper aesthetic combined with functionality was too compelling to pass up. After putting it to daily use for several weeks, I’m convinced it’s a strong contender in the world of coffee makers, though it’s not without a few quirks.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that caught my eye was the polished copper finish. It looks absolutely stunning sitting on my kitchen counter, adding a touch of sophistication to my morning coffee routine. The glass beaker, made of borosilicate material, feels robust and resistant to heat damage, which makes it perfect for brewing piping hot coffee. I also appreciated the compact dimensions (3.34""D x 5.27""W x 6.3""H), which didn’t dominate my countertop and added convenience when storing it in small spaces. At 1.26 pounds, it's lightweight enough to handle easily but sturdy enough to remain stable while plunging. However, the lid does feel a bit less durable and could use some reinforcement.

**Ease of Use**  
Operating this French press didn’t take much effort, even as I experimented with various beans and brewing times. The QUQIYSO Coffee Maker is entirely manual, allowing me to fully witness the coffee brewing process—watching the coffee grounds swell and sink through the borosilicate glass was oddly satisfying. Whether you're a coffee aficionado or just someone looking to make their mornings a little brighter, this device is incredibly intuitive. Having the included user manual within arm's reach was helpful at first, but honestly, it was so simple to use that I hardly needed it beyond the first few uses.

[Check QUQIYSO Copper-21 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0b589s46b/)

**Brewing Performance**  
The double-layer filtration system surprised me with its ability to brew an incredibly smooth and sediment-free coffee. The perforated plate efficiently trapped larger coffee grounds while the 80-mesh filter captured finer particles. I did a side-by-side comparison with a cheaper French press I already had, and the difference in taste was noticeable—it produced a crisp flavor profile, making every cup indulgent. It doubles as a versatile tool; I’ve used it to make tea, hot chocolate, and even almond milk. Despite this versatility, the brewing time can feel long for someone in a rush, as it requires a few minutes to steep properly.

**Care and Maintenance**  
Cleaning kitchen tools is not my favorite task, so I was relieved that the glass, filter, and plunger of the QUQIYSO Coffee Maker are dishwasher-safe. That said, the lid requires hand-washing, and I found myself being extra cautious to avoid scratching the shiny copper finish. Making that extra effort to preserve the aesthetic appeal was a price I was willing to pay. If you're someone who prioritizes quick cleanup, the different care instructions for various parts might prove mildly inconvenient.

**Positives**  
- Eye-catching copper exterior that enhances kitchen décor  
- Compact and lightweight for easy storage and portability  
- Durable borosilicate glass resistant to heat  
- Excellent filtration system for a smooth coffee experience  
- Doubles as a tool for brewing tea, cold brew, and plant-based drinks  

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
- The lid feels slightly flimsy compared to the rest of the build  
- Careful handling required to avoid scratching the copper finish  
- The manual brewing process might feel slow for busy mornings  

**Competitive Options**  
Having used other French presses like the Bodum Chambord and the Frieling Stainless Steel Coffee Maker in the past, I noticed some differences. While the Bodum offers a traditional design and a slightly quicker brewing process, it falls short in the aesthetic department compared to the QUQIYSO. The Frieling, on the other hand, feels more premium with its solid stainless steel build but comes at a significantly higher price point and lacks the versatility of the QUQIYSO’s reusable filter. Comparing these, I’d say this French press is perfect for those who value both design and functionality without overspending.

**Quality for Price**  
Investing in a coffee maker means considering both its upfront cost and long-term benefits. What sets this product apart is its affordability paired with features like reusable filters that help cut down on disposable paper filter expenses.

I told my roommates I could survive for a month without eating or drinking—just living off osmosis. They laughed, assumed it was one of my philosophical experiments, and went back to scrolling their feeds.

The trick was to never make a scene. I sat at the dinner table, nodding along as everyone chewed, but my plate stayed conveniently full. “Not hungry,” I’d say, or “Already ate earlier.” Nobody pressed me. At work, I carried a coffee cup everywhere, sipping nothing but air. In meetings, I swirled it like it contained something deep and important.

And strangely, I didn’t fade. If anything, I thrived. My skin looked clearer, my mind sharper, my energy steady. I convinced myself the water in the shower, the moisture in the air, even the condensation on subway windows was enough. I pressed palms against cool glass, lingered under rain, absorbed the world in secret.

People noticed my calm. “You seem different,” a coworker said. “Balanced.” My roommate called me “Zen.” If only they knew it was just osmosis, sliding into my cells like whispers.

The thirty days passed quietly, unremarkably. On the thirty-first, I bit into an apple, its sweetness shocking, almost violent. My roommates didn’t blink. They just asked if I wanted the rest of the bag.

No one ever questioned how I’d skipped an entire month of meals, how I’d lived on nothing but skin and air and the thin membrane between myself and the world. Maybe they didn’t want to. Maybe it’s easier to accept miracles than to look too closely.

So yes, I once lived off osmosis for one month. And nobody questioned it.",0,1755695335.0,confession,3,0.19,False

However, thinking back on my life growing up, there were definitely signs starting pretty early on for me.

Probably around the time I was going through puberty is when I can remember my sleep issues starting. I had so much trouble waking up for school and my father would get so angry, but I could not understand why it was so so hard to get up when everyone else seemed to not struggle nearly as much! In high school, it got to the point where I would have to have 5 different devices with alarms going off all at the same time directly next to my pillow just to ensure I would wake up (and it did not always work).

I would get home from school, go right to bed and sleep for hours, wake up very late to get my school work done, then go back to sleep until it was time for school again. I had no time for anything other than sleep and school. My school would even do paper plate awards, and I would get ones like ""Most in need of sleep"" lol.

After high school, I worked at Starbucks for a couple years, and I self medicated with coffee. I was drinking up to 15 shots of espresso each day just to try to function and I was still so exhausted. I would try to cut back, but I was just so tires I would not be able to so anything without excessive caffeine. 

On my days off (from school or from work), I would often spend the entire day sleeping, up to 20 hours sometimes. My family never understood and they thought I was just very lazy and did not want to do anything, meanwhile I felt like I was fighting for my life to try to stay awake.

Fast forward to now after my narcolepsy diagnosis, I feel much more validated in my struggles and I now know there is a legitimate reason for it! I has been on Vyvanse 60mg to keep me awake, and while the medication is not perfect, it truly is life changing. I take it around an hour before I have to get up in the morning, and I did not realize that trying to wake up in the morning should not feel like you are fighting for your life lol. I am able to be so much more productive! I used to think that waking up in the morning was just as hard for everyone since no one seems to enjoy getting up for school/work, but I could never understand how they were able to do it without all the difficulties I was facing. I thought I was just not trying hard enough or that I was lazy because everyone else seemed to be able to get up everyday while it was such a struggle for me.

After being diagnosed, everything makes much more sense to me. I was not just a terrible, lazy child/teen who was overreacting about how difficult waking up was, I just had a disorder!! I would beat myself up over it so much when I was younger because I could not understand why I was so ""lazy,"" but I wish I could go back and tell my younger self that my problems were valid and it was not my fault.

Anyway, looking back, what did you guys do before being diagnosed? What signs were there before diagnosis that you now realize were due to narcolepsy? Getting a diagnosis was very eye opening for me, and I now know that my struggles have always been valid, even if others could not understand!",3,1755695118.0,Narcolepsy,3,1.0,False
1mve8md,https://www.reddit.com/r/VyvanseADHD/comments/1mve8md/my_messed_up_vyvanse_schedule/,My (messed up) Vyvanse Schedule,"i take 2x40mg, but not at the same time, my duration is a bit more variable than this and has a much longer startup. because the medication takes 1.5-2h to even kick in for me, and doesn’t really peak until about 3-4h (food, water, activity, etc dependant) i space out my 2 dosages and have less delicate control over when i get my focus. i set an alarm and take one at ~6:30am, then fall back asleep, then have a second set of alarms and take my second at around ~8am.

i am awful when it comes to sleeping through alarms or turning them off “instinctively” when I’m 1/2 awake. the 6:30am vyvanse will wake me up at about 9:30-10:30am naturally, but does make waking up at 8am significantly easier. the intense peak, lack of specific control, and duration is why i space out my dosages like this; once the 3-4h peak hits, i know that’s when i only have about 6h left on that pill. the other one will peak in 1-2h giving me full focus till 4pm at the earliest, and tailing off at the latest at around 6-7pm. the effects will continue to degrade till about 10-11pm but these times can be effected by food, activity, sun, etc BUT most heavily by sleep duration.

even prior to vyvanse i had incredible trouble falling asleep and waking up in the morning. often times i wouldn’t be able to fall asleep till 2-5am, and as mentioned before would sleep through my alarms like crazy; less so now (vyvanse has actually helped a bit with this), i still sometimes just stay up entire nights or sometimes multiple in a row getting either 0h, or only 2-3h over the course of 3 days and 2 nights. i definitely notice vyvanse takes a bit of a toll on my body, and skip it on any day i can or reduce my dosage to just 1x40mg when possible. the fist day i skip, i can feel absolutely exhausted the entire day. if I’m able to sleep 12-16h on that fist day the following days are usually perfectly fine, but if I’m not, i will usually be pretty tired for 3-5 days (or more typically my entire 2 day weekend) and unable to properly relax.

thanks for listening/reading to my ranting, this schedule has positives and negatives to it like any other, but has worked the best for me out of what i’ve tried. in the future my plan is to push out this 1st/2nd pill window a little bit longer to see if it helps at all. thinking about 1.5h -> 2.5h, taking the 2nd pill around 9am while leaving the 1st pill time exactly the same. part of the reason the uptake and duration is so long for me is because i (unintentionally) don’t keep up with drinking enough water or eat meals at a proper time, usually lunch at 2-3pm being my first meal of the day. the water is also an issue with it being limited to 1st thing in the morning when i take it, then around either a morning coffee/lunch.",1,1755695076.0,VyvanseADHD,0,1.0,False

I am confused, thought I was doing well keeping meals fairly low carb, not really counting them intentionally but they have been from 50-75g a day.  Yesterday for breakfast, I had farro with chicken sausage and some sautéed bell pepper and it went from 97 to 145 but came down within 1 hr 15 mins and went a bit lower. 

Contrasted with lunch and dinner, when I had pretty low carb lunch (salad and shredded chicken with minimal dressing) glucose went from 92 to 125 and stayed up for 4 hours!

For dinner(Diet Coke, salmon with balsamic glaze I scraped off, sides of sautéed spinach (tasteless so likely no butter), roasted cauliflower and two thin French fries and one small onion ring). After dinner it went from 76\* to 133 and stayed elevated in 100s then 90s all night until 4:30 AM when it finally went down to 92.  Could be the sneaky fries and onion ring but it was only a  tiny cheat!

I was annoyed so I did not do a fasting finger prick test until well after my unsweetened coffee at 7:19 AM when it said 89. 

After reading a lot of commentary here, I think I may ditch the entire idea of low carb, surely it is better to have it go up and then down fairly quickly and relatively in range than to linger over 100 all night long?   And just keep on with the weight loss and exercise and avoid rice/dairy sugar. I should reach my goal weight in a month or two hopefully.

\*there was a sensor error just before this reading during my meal and it went from 91 to 76 in 10 minutes. So the 76 is kind of suspicious.

This is a great interview that caused me to reflect on my own DUI.

Everybody has their own journey post DUI. For me, I chose to turn the bottle down and enter sobriety. I drank religiously for nearly 3 decades and drove drunk countless times without ever getting caught. On the night of my DUI, my BAC was .22 and I barely remember any of the events leading up to getting in my vehicle nor the arrest. I drove thru neighborhoods, the highway, and eventually pulled over on a county road. I had no idea why I was driving where I was nor why I chose to get in the vehicle.

As I sobered up in the drunk tank, I was fearful what I had done. I had no idea if I caused a wreck or done any damage. The guards wouldn't answer my calls thru the window and I just continued to sit and wait. When I finally was released, I was given my court date and just told I was arrested/charged for a DUI. When I got my vehicle from the impound, every second waiting was in terror that my vehicle was demolished.

It turned out, I was lucky. I didn't wreck, my vehicle was fine, and I was charged with only a DUI, nothing else traffic related. As I drove home and sat in shock, I reflected on how much worse it could have been. In the weeks and months post DUI, I searched news articles on manslaughter cases and followed stories on extreme DUIs. I followed a ton of posts in here to listen to everyone's journey. I accepted I had a drinking problem and moderation was never going to be in my future. I had to quite for good.

A year and a half later I'm still sober and do not intend to ever drink again. Stories like this youtube video make me nervous to ever drink again because I couldn't live with myself knowing I caused harm to anyone else. Sobriety isn't for everyone, but it was a personal choice I knew I had to take to never be in this situation again.

A year and a half later I'm in a better place. I could be in prison for causing serious harm or loss of life. When I sit on my balcony drinking my morning coffee, attending my favorite sports team game, enjoying a nice dinner with my family, I occasionally think how life could be different for me if that night had gone horribly south.

To everyone reading this who has a DUI under their belt, I wish you the best in your journey. Whether that's sobriety or moderation. Just please take the situation and make it better for your future.",2,1755694573.0,dui,3,1.0,False

At first I thought it was just something older people did, but I bought a few small pots and sees and tried it out. Watching something grow that you planted yourself is such a calm feeling, and it's weirdly addictive. I started wit herbs like basil and mint because they're easy, and I remember the first time I used my own basil in pasta, I felt like a chef even though it was just basic cooking.

The best part is how much it slows you down. I used to spend every weekend just scrolling on my phone, but now I actually look forward to checking on my plants. Sometimes I'll just sit outside with coffee and it feels like a mini escape. It also gave me something to talk about with my grandma, since she's been gardening for years and now we swap tips. 

I honestly think everyone should try growing at least one plant, even if it's just on a windowsill. It doesn't take much space or money, and you'll be surprised how good it feels.",17,1755694341.0,Hobbies,14,1.0,False

While many people describe Monster as complicated and difficult to watch, for me, it was actually very easy on the eyes. I loved the small details ..  like when characters are simply enjoying their coffee, the deep appreciation of life in the dialogues, the touches of absurdism and nihilism, the incredible character writing, the bizarre comic books... all of it.

Now,in the show, many characters appear ..like almost every 4 episodes there’s a new character. And we usually get to see their flashbacks, past stories, childhood traumas, or moral dilemmas .. and most of them are really well written and actually important to the build-up of the story , HOWEVRE, we never got any flashbacks about the most important character in the show, which is Tenma, of course.  
The only time we see a childhood memory of his is that one scene where he pissed himself while playing hide and seek (and honestly, I don’t know what to do with that information.) I just wished they showed us more about him — like, how did he become such a brilliant doctor? Where did he get his moral code of *“all lives are equal”* from? (Yeah I remember the Turkish lady and her son in the first episodes, but I’m sure there’s more to it from his childhood or how he was raised.)  
I wanted to know why his family never seemed to care about him or stood by him during his struggle .. or the opposite, why doesn’t he ever mention his life back in Japan?

To sum it up: I just wanted to know how he became the brilliant charachter he is .But still, Monster was a great watch and it’s already one of my favorites :D",12,1755694306.0,MonsterAnime,6,0.93,False

The spotting has been brown, to pink, to a small amount of red and even very tiny brown clotting (mixed with what looks like coffee grounds). It’s never a lot but each of my miscarriages start this way.

My last ectopic was similar, raising normally and then stalled then began to double again.

I suppose I should start from the beginning and explain how it all began.

On a Saturday morning, the sun was shining brilliantly, and I was feeling a bit restless, so I decided to take a bike ride around my neighborhood.

As I pedaled through the area, lost in thoughts about my belongings and life in general, I felt an inexplicable pull guiding me toward a specific house. I stopped in front of it and noticed a handwritten sign announcing a yard sale.

I never really cared for yard sales; I wasn't like those older folks who spent their free time rummaging through other people's discarded items.

To me, yard sales were merely the leftovers of others' lives, people trying to offload dusty relics that had long lost their appeal.

Yet, something about this particular yard sale caught my attention, prompting me to dismount my bike and venture into the yard to take a look around.

The yard was cluttered with old furniture and tables brimming with various knick-knacks and toys, but I halted when I spotted a box labeled 'books.'

A smile instantly spread across my face; I adored books. Whenever I was without my phone or needed something to occupy my time, I would dive into a book on any subject.

I hurried over to the box, knelt down, and began sifting through it, pulling out faded paperbacks and yellowed hardcovers.

My fingers glided over the spines of the books until one particular volume caught my eye, standing out from the rest.

I picked up the unusual book, feeling its weight in my hands, and quickly noticed how worn and tattered it was; the spine was cracked.

As I opened the book, I saw that the pages were yellowed and brittle with age, filled with handwritten notes and peculiar symbols that seemed to dance before my eyes.

I opened the book and saw that the pages were yellowed and fragile due to age, filled with handwritten notes and peculiar symbols that appeared to dance in front of me.

It seemed that the person who wrote this book took great care to record something significant. At the moment, I didn’t think much of it, but I could sense a strange energy radiating from the book, a kind of chilling pulse that made me shiver.

I closed the book, brushed off the cover, and read the title, which sent another shiver down my spine.

""Prophetic Pages""

I considered tossing the book back into the box and simply walking away, but it was too captivating to abandon. I couldn't just leave it there, tucked away in a box in someone's yard.

So, with the Prophetic Pages book tucked under my arm, I stood up and approached an older woman who seemed to be managing the yard sale.

I extended the book towards her, and she nodded in acknowledgment before informing me in a raspy voice that it would cost five dollars. Without a second thought, I handed her the cash.

""Be cautious with that book, young man; it's not ordinary,"" the woman warned.

I merely nodded and made my way back to my bike, placing the enigmatic book in the basket before setting off towards home.

Upon arriving home, I parked my bike beside the house, took the Prophetic Pages book, and entered the house.

I went upstairs, not particularly concerned about my family, and shut myself in my room, settling into my reading chair, eager to delve deeper into my discovery.

This intriguing Prophetic Pages had piqued my interest, and I was ready to immerse myself in its narrative and pages filled with wonder.

As I began to flip through the pages, I quickly noticed that each one contained a detailed entry about an individual's life and death, and their names struck me as oddly familiar.

I suddenly realized that the names in this book belonged to people I knew—friends, family, even acquaintances. My hands turned icy, and when I turned to the next page, I nearly hurled the book across the room.

I had stumbled upon a page that appeared different from the rest; its ink was darker, and the writing seemed more urgent. The names and dates listed alongside each entry were accompanied by descriptions.

The first entry appeared to belong to my neighbor, Mr. Thompson.

Mr. Scott Thompson - 63 years old - Passed away from a heart attack on April 12, 2024.

I grimaced, unable to believe what I was seeing. It was far too specific to be mere coincidence.

Then I suddenly remembered that tonight was the night, and I tossed the book aside, pondering its implications. Was Mr. Thompson truly going to die, or was this merely a cruel joke?

In a flash, I understood that I had to warn him about the danger he was in, so I stood up from my reading chair, leaving the book behind. As I reached the threshold of my bedroom, I hesitated.

""Hold on, there’s no way he’ll believe me; he’ll probably think I’m crazy or something along those lines,"" I thought, my breath quickening.

Yet, the thought wouldn’t leave my mind, so I hurried downstairs into the main area, standing by the front door, lost in thoughts of Mr. Thompson.

""William, what are you up to?"" a voice inquired.

I turned around quickly to see my parents in the kitchen, both busy preparing dinner, their expressions showing concern for my unusual behavior.

""I need to go see Mr. Thompson,"" I replied.

""Why? It’s nearly dinner time,"" Dad responded.

A huge lump formed in my throat. What was I supposed to say? That our neighbor was going to have a heart attack tonight, and I discovered this from a book?

""Uh - I need to return something I borrowed from him, and I thought I would give it back tonight,"" I said, grinning nervously.

""You can do it tomorrow because it's too late now, and I'm pretty sure Mr. Thompson doesn't want to be disturbed at this hour,"" Mom replied.

I growled quietly and clenched my fists, but I couldn't voice my frustration because I knew I couldn't argue with my parents about what was supposed to happen.

A few hours later, I lay in bed staring at the ceiling. It was dark in my room, and I couldn't take it anymore. I got out of bed, still in my pajamas, but I slipped on my shoes and dashed out of my bedroom, then out of the house, heading towards Mr. Thompson's place.

I raced down the front steps in the darkness but skidded to a halt when I saw the scene unfolding there.

Bright ambulance lights illuminated the area, and emergency workers were loading a body into the back of the ambulance. I then noticed Mr. Thompson's wife sitting on the porch, crying.

I hurried over to her, bent over with my hands on my knees, breathing heavily. When I looked up, she was staring at me, and despite the darkness, the ambulance lights revealed the tears streaming down her face.

""Mrs. Thompson, what happened?"" I asked.

""It's terrible, William. I got up to use the bathroom, but I couldn't open the door. I tried to wake Scott, but he wouldn't wake up, so I called for help, and they told me he had a heart attack in bed. I can't believe it; he was the healthiest man I ever knew,"" Mrs. Thompson explained.

I instinctively took a step back, realizing that this was exactly what was foretold in the Prophetic Pages. It said Mr. Thompson would die tonight, and it happened just as the book described.

""William, are you okay?"" Mrs. Thompson asked me.

I took another step back, my head pounding, then turned and sprinted back home. I burst through the door to find Mom and Dad standing there, and they didn't look pleased.

""William Johnson, what on earth are you doing up?!"" Mom yelled at me.

I glanced at the front door, recalling what had just occurred, then turned back to my parents. I needed to tell them; I had to let them know.

""Mr. Thompson passed away from a heart attack!"" I exclaimed, gesturing towards the front door.

""Oh my God!"" Dad gasped in disbelief.

I wanted to share the details about the Prophetic Pages book and its contents, but I knew my parents would likely dismiss it as nonsense.

Without uttering another word, Mom and Dad hurried past me and dashed out of the house, seemingly on their way to see Mrs. Thompson.

I simply returned to my room, surveying the dim space and pondering where I had placed that ridiculous book, contemplating whether to burn it or toss it away.

But I decided to postpone that until tomorrow when I had the chance and when Mom and Dad weren't around to catch me in the act. So, I crawled into bed, wondering what would unfold next.

The following morning, I awoke to find the Prophetic Pages resting at the foot of my bed, which left me puzzled. Without saying a word, I picked up the book.

As I began to flip through its pages, my heart raced as I recognized the names of friends from high school, family members, and even acquaintances like Mr. Thompson.







Each page contained a detailed account of a person's death, with dates approaching rapidly. Goosebumps prickled my arms; was this all just a cruel joke?

I attempted to dismiss it as a product of someone's dark imagination, but the more pages I turned, the more dread coiled in my stomach.

Eventually, I became consumed by the book, searching for any means to avert the impending deaths, knowing that if I didn't take action, I would lose everyone I cared about.

I was attempting to reach out to several people to inform them about what might happen to them, but they either ignored me or claimed to be too busy.

Just then, my phone rang, and I glanced down to see it was Ryan, my best friend since elementary school.

""Hey Willy, are you busy?"" he greeted me with a cheerful and carefree tone.

""Uh - not really, but I need to discuss something very important with you,"" I replied, feeling a knot of panic in my throat.

Should I really share the details about the Prophetic Pages book and what occurred with Mr. Thompson? He would probably just laugh or hang up on me immediately.

""Sure, what's going on, dude?"" he inquired.

I fell silent, hesitating as I struggled to find the right words to explain the book that was essentially about death to my best friend.

""Um, just... be cautious, alright? I came across something online that made me worry we might be in danger,"" I said.

""Are you referring to that illness happening in Russia?"" he chuckled, though I could sense the worry seeping into his voice.

""Just promise me you'll take it easy, okay? Don't do anything reckless,"" I snapped back.

""Yeah, alright. I promise,"" he assured me, and I felt a slight sense of relief, though it was short-lived.

I was about to end the call when Ryan mentioned he had a question for me, and since I was already on the line, I figured I might as well hear him out.

""Dude, I'm going to a horror movie showing today and was wondering if you wanted to come along. You probably need a break from whatever's going on in that head of yours,"" Ryan suggested.

""Um - okay, I guess I'll see you there,"" I replied.

After hanging up, I let out a soft sigh and looked down to see the Prophetic Pages book still resting on my lap, now opened to a different page.

Ryan Orangewood - 26 years old - shot in the forehead and robbed on April 15th, 2024.

As soon as I noticed my phone slip from my grasp, I shut the book and picked it up, tossing it across my room and watching it land with a loud thud.

""Oh God no,"" I thought as I rose from the bed.

Without uttering another word, I gathered everything I needed, leaving the book on the floor, and dashed downstairs to tell Mom and Dad everything that had happened.

However, when I reached the lower level of the house, I found it eerily quiet; no one was around. The only thing that caught my eye was a note taped to the front door. I approached it silently, took it down, and read it.

Dear William, I’m sorry, but your father and I had to leave for work early due to an important meeting. We’ll be back by lunchtime. If you decide to go out with a friend or by yourself, please call us. See you later, love Mom.

I didn’t care much for the note, crumpling it up before sprinting out of the house. I hopped on my bike and pedaled away as fast as I could.

A few minutes later, I arrived at the town square, parked my bike in the rack, locked it up, and hurried to the movie theater, hoping Ryan wouldn’t actually be there.

But there he was, leaning against the side of the building, engrossed in his phone. When he noticed me, a smile broke across his face.

""There you are! I was just about to call you and ask what on earth happened to you,"" Ryan remarked.

""I got caught up with something else. Let's just finish this movie so I can head home and wrap up my work,"" I replied, raising my hands in a gesture of exasperation.

I resolved to share everything with Ryan after the movie, once we left the theater. I hoped he would understand, given his love for horror films, and that he wouldn't think I was insane.

A couple of hours later, the movie concluded, and we stood outside the theater. I opened my mouth, ready to explain everything to Ryan, but he quickly silenced me.

""I know you rode your bike here, but let's head to that smoothie shop just a few minutes away. Your bike will be fine, and if it gets stolen, you can hold me responsible,"" Ryan suggested.

Before long, we were strolling down the street in silence, and I let out a soft sigh before clearing my throat.

""Ryan, remember how much I enjoy yard sales and how I love buying things from them?"" I said.

Ryan nodded silently, as he often did when I had something to share, knowing that my words were usually significant.

""At this yard sale, I stumbled upon a box filled with books, and one caught my eye called Prophetic Pages. Initially, I assumed it was just an old, dull read, but it turns out it contains a page that predicts when everyone I care about will die. Just a few days ago, my neighbor, Mr. Thompson, passed away from a heart attack, and his name was listed in the book, along with the exact date of his death, as if it had foreseen it,"" I explained.

""So, is it like a death book or something?"" Ryan inquired.

""I have no idea what it is. There was even a page for you that stated you would get shot in the head and robbed today,"" I replied, my voice tinged with worry.

I anticipated Ryan's reaction, hoping he would show concern or suggest we head home right away, but instead, he burst into laughter as if I had just shared a hilarious joke.

""Dude, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard from you in all our years of friendship,"" Ryan chuckled.

There it was; I knew he wouldn't take me seriously. He was going to mock me and label me as crazy. I regretted mentioning the Prophetic Pages book at all.

As we walked past an alley, a man who appeared older than us suddenly emerged. He wore a white shirt beneath blue overalls and black boots, but what caught my attention was the white mask with black eyeholes and the object he was gripping tightly.

It was a gun, and in that instant, I realized I had to intervene before things escalated.

Before either Ryan or I could react, the man raised the gun and shot Ryan directly in the forehead. I stood frozen, watching in horror as my friend collapsed to the ground, lifeless.

Bystanders nearby gasped in shock and screamed at the unfolding scene, but the man discarded the gun and pounced on Ryan like a wild animal, rifling through his pockets with frantic urgency.

I was astonished that the Prophetic Pages had claimed yet another life; it appeared to have knowledge of all my friends and acquaintances, predicting who would be next.

Before long, days turned into weeks, and I had almost forgotten what had happened to Ryan. However, the Prophetic Pages remained etched in my mind, and I was determined to protect my friends and family.

It wasn't until I stumbled upon a page for my father that I felt an overwhelming urge to scream and tear the Prophetic Pages apart.

Samuel Johnson - 53 years old - dies in car accident on April 30th, 2023

Realizing that this date was less than a week away, I became frantic and desperate to find a way to prevent my Dad's death.

I needed answers, so I began flipping through the book, hoping the Prophetic Pages might offer a solution. That’s when I discovered a name tucked away in the back of the book.

Daniel Roberts - 25 years old - Passed away from loneliness on May 15, 2023 
(Still Alive Owned Book Before)

I was astounded; this guy had owned the Prophetic Pages before me, yet he was somehow still alive. I knew I had to find him.

I took out my phone and began searching online, eventually finding an old news forum where Daniel had shared his experiences with the Prophetic Pages. I felt compelled to reach out to him, so I sent Daniel an email, pouring out my heart and hoping against all odds that he would respond.

To my surprise, Daniel replied. He seemed somewhat withdrawn, yet he agreed to meet me at a downtown coffee shop to discuss things.

Gathering all the essentials, I made my way to the coffee shop, arriving early to secure a seat. Anxiety washed over me, and my stomach twisted into knots.

When Daniel Roberts entered the coffee shop, I instantly recognized him from the photo he had sent. He appeared older, with graying hair and a weary expression. However, his eyes were sharp, as if he had witnessed too much in his life.

""I received your email. You're in trouble, aren't you?"" he asked, taking a seat across from me.

I simply nodded my head, then retrieved the Prophetic Pages from my bag, sliding it across the table.

""I discovered this book at a yard sale and... realized it foretold the deaths of my neighbor and friend - both are gone - and all the names I know are listed in there. Can I prevent it?"" I said.

Daniel gazed at me for a long time without uttering a word; his brows were knitted together, and then he let out a soft sigh before meeting my gaze.

""You can't alter what has been inscribed in the Prophetic Pages. I’ve attempted to do so, and it only worsened the situation. The book has its own will. It unveils the truth, but it doesn’t permit you to change it,"" Daniel clarified.

""What should I do then?"" I inquired, my voice filled with desperation, my hands shaking.

""Just accept it; you can’t battle fate, but you can treasure the time you have left with them,"" Daniel replied gently.

I felt my heart plummet, but something in Daniel's eyes indicated he comprehended my suffering.

""You must assist me. How did you survive the Prophetic Pages?"" I implored.

""I learned to let go. The book is indeed a curse, but it also teaches you to value life. You must confront your fear of loss. If you don’t, it will engulf you,"" Daniel's voice remained calm.

His words struck a chord with me, yet they felt like a harsh reality to accept. I couldn’t merely sit back and witness my loved ones perish. I had to discover a way to resist.

We spent hours deliberating over the book, and with each moment that passed, I felt a spark of hope. Daniel recounted his own battles, the sorrow he had faced, and how he had learned to accept the losses he couldn’t avert.

He talked about finding comfort in the memories of those he had lost, and I began to realize that perhaps I had been so preoccupied with trying to alter the future that I had overlooked the present.

When I got home that night, I reopened The Prophetic Pages, my mind buzzing with renewed resolve. I needed to confront the entries, to face the certainty of death with bravery.

I picked up my phone, calling each of my friends and family, not to warn them but to tell them how much they meant to me.

I hung up, feeling a sense of relief washed over me. I reached out to my mother, my sister, and everyone else listed in the book. I expressed my love for them and how much I valued our shared moments.

As the days passed, I felt increasingly lighter, even though the entries still lingered in my mind. The anniversary of my father’s passing was drawing near, and I dedicated every possible moment to being with him.

We went fishing, exchanged stories, and I made it a point to convey how much he meant to me.

On April 30th, I sat next to him in the car as we headed out for lunch. A wave of tranquility washed over me, and upon arriving at the restaurant, I took a deep breath.

The Prophetic Pages no longer held power over me; I had come to terms with the potential of loss.

As I stepped out of the car, a surge of panic hit me when I noticed a truck barreling towards us, but I was prepared.

I grabbed my father’s arm, pulling him back just in time. The truck veered off course, crashing into a lamppost instead.

My heart raced, but I realized I had finally made a decision. I chose to fight for those I loved, to face the darkness with light.

Later that evening, I revisited The Prophetic Pages, leafing through the pages one final time.

When I reached the last page, I was astonished to see the writing had disappeared, the names and dates vanishing before my eyes. The burden of the book felt lighter, and I recognized that I had altered my destiny.

I closed the book, enveloped in a sense of peace. Daniel had been correct; I couldn’t battle fate, but I could embrace the life I had and the people I cherished.

I was liberated from the chains of fear, and I had learned to value the prophetic essence of life, treasuring every moment as if it were my last.

As I returned the book to my shelf, I understood I would always remember the lessons it imparted. 

Life is unpredictable, yet within that uncertainty lies the beauty of existence. While death may be unavoidable, love will always prevail.

And with that realization, I felt prepared to confront whatever lay ahead.",1,1755693536.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

I suppose I should start from the beginning and explain how it all began.

On a Saturday morning, the sun was shining brilliantly, and I was feeling a bit restless, so I decided to take a bike ride around my neighborhood.

As I pedaled through the area, lost in thoughts about my belongings and life in general, I felt an inexplicable pull guiding me toward a specific house. I stopped in front of it and noticed a handwritten sign announcing a yard sale.

I never really cared for yard sales; I wasn't like those older folks who spent their free time rummaging through other people's discarded items.

To me, yard sales were merely the leftovers of others' lives, people trying to offload dusty relics that had long lost their appeal.

Yet, something about this particular yard sale caught my attention, prompting me to dismount my bike and venture into the yard to take a look around.

The yard was cluttered with old furniture and tables brimming with various knick-knacks and toys, but I halted when I spotted a box labeled 'books.'

A smile instantly spread across my face; I adored books. Whenever I was without my phone or needed something to occupy my time, I would dive into a book on any subject.

I hurried over to the box, knelt down, and began sifting through it, pulling out faded paperbacks and yellowed hardcovers.

My fingers glided over the spines of the books until one particular volume caught my eye, standing out from the rest.

I picked up the unusual book, feeling its weight in my hands, and quickly noticed how worn and tattered it was; the spine was cracked.

As I opened the book, I saw that the pages were yellowed and brittle with age, filled with handwritten notes and peculiar symbols that seemed to dance before my eyes.

I opened the book and saw that the pages were yellowed and fragile due to age, filled with handwritten notes and peculiar symbols that appeared to dance in front of me.

It seemed that the person who wrote this book took great care to record something significant. At the moment, I didn’t think much of it, but I could sense a strange energy radiating from the book, a kind of chilling pulse that made me shiver.

I closed the book, brushed off the cover, and read the title, which sent another shiver down my spine.

""Prophetic Pages""

I considered tossing the book back into the box and simply walking away, but it was too captivating to abandon. I couldn't just leave it there, tucked away in a box in someone's yard.

So, with the Prophetic Pages book tucked under my arm, I stood up and approached an older woman who seemed to be managing the yard sale.

I extended the book towards her, and she nodded in acknowledgment before informing me in a raspy voice that it would cost five dollars. Without a second thought, I handed her the cash.

""Be cautious with that book, young man; it's not ordinary,"" the woman warned.

I merely nodded and made my way back to my bike, placing the enigmatic book in the basket before setting off towards home.

Upon arriving home, I parked my bike beside the house, took the Prophetic Pages book, and entered the house.

I went upstairs, not particularly concerned about my family, and shut myself in my room, settling into my reading chair, eager to delve deeper into my discovery.

This intriguing Prophetic Pages had piqued my interest, and I was ready to immerse myself in its narrative and pages filled with wonder.

As I began to flip through the pages, I quickly noticed that each one contained a detailed entry about an individual's life and death, and their names struck me as oddly familiar.

I suddenly realized that the names in this book belonged to people I knew—friends, family, even acquaintances. My hands turned icy, and when I turned to the next page, I nearly hurled the book across the room.

I had stumbled upon a page that appeared different from the rest; its ink was darker, and the writing seemed more urgent. The names and dates listed alongside each entry were accompanied by descriptions.

The first entry appeared to belong to my neighbor, Mr. Thompson.

Mr. Scott Thompson - 63 years old - Passed away from a heart attack on April 12, 2024.

I grimaced, unable to believe what I was seeing. It was far too specific to be mere coincidence.

Then I suddenly remembered that tonight was the night, and I tossed the book aside, pondering its implications. Was Mr. Thompson truly going to die, or was this merely a cruel joke?

In a flash, I understood that I had to warn him about the danger he was in, so I stood up from my reading chair, leaving the book behind. As I reached the threshold of my bedroom, I hesitated.

""Hold on, there’s no way he’ll believe me; he’ll probably think I’m crazy or something along those lines,"" I thought, my breath quickening.

Yet, the thought wouldn’t leave my mind, so I hurried downstairs into the main area, standing by the front door, lost in thoughts of Mr. Thompson.

""William, what are you up to?"" a voice inquired.

I turned around quickly to see my parents in the kitchen, both busy preparing dinner, their expressions showing concern for my unusual behavior.

""I need to go see Mr. Thompson,"" I replied.

""Why? It’s nearly dinner time,"" Dad responded.

A huge lump formed in my throat. What was I supposed to say? That our neighbor was going to have a heart attack tonight, and I discovered this from a book?

""Uh - I need to return something I borrowed from him, and I thought I would give it back tonight,"" I said, grinning nervously.

""You can do it tomorrow because it's too late now, and I'm pretty sure Mr. Thompson doesn't want to be disturbed at this hour,"" Mom replied.

I growled quietly and clenched my fists, but I couldn't voice my frustration because I knew I couldn't argue with my parents about what was supposed to happen.

A few hours later, I lay in bed staring at the ceiling. It was dark in my room, and I couldn't take it anymore. I got out of bed, still in my pajamas, but I slipped on my shoes and dashed out of my bedroom, then out of the house, heading towards Mr. Thompson's place.

I raced down the front steps in the darkness but skidded to a halt when I saw the scene unfolding there.

Bright ambulance lights illuminated the area, and emergency workers were loading a body into the back of the ambulance. I then noticed Mr. Thompson's wife sitting on the porch, crying.

I hurried over to her, bent over with my hands on my knees, breathing heavily. When I looked up, she was staring at me, and despite the darkness, the ambulance lights revealed the tears streaming down her face.

""Mrs. Thompson, what happened?"" I asked.

""It's terrible, William. I got up to use the bathroom, but I couldn't open the door. I tried to wake Scott, but he wouldn't wake up, so I called for help, and they told me he had a heart attack in bed. I can't believe it; he was the healthiest man I ever knew,"" Mrs. Thompson explained.

I instinctively took a step back, realizing that this was exactly what was foretold in the Prophetic Pages. It said Mr. Thompson would die tonight, and it happened just as the book described.

""William, are you okay?"" Mrs. Thompson asked me.

I took another step back, my head pounding, then turned and sprinted back home. I burst through the door to find Mom and Dad standing there, and they didn't look pleased.

""William Johnson, what on earth are you doing up?!"" Mom yelled at me.

I glanced at the front door, recalling what had just occurred, then turned back to my parents. I needed to tell them; I had to let them know.

""Mr. Thompson passed away from a heart attack!"" I exclaimed, gesturing towards the front door.

""Oh my God!"" Dad gasped in disbelief.

I wanted to share the details about the Prophetic Pages book and its contents, but I knew my parents would likely dismiss it as nonsense.

Without uttering another word, Mom and Dad hurried past me and dashed out of the house, seemingly on their way to see Mrs. Thompson.

I simply returned to my room, surveying the dim space and pondering where I had placed that ridiculous book, contemplating whether to burn it or toss it away.

But I decided to postpone that until tomorrow when I had the chance and when Mom and Dad weren't around to catch me in the act. So, I crawled into bed, wondering what would unfold next.

The following morning, I awoke to find the Prophetic Pages resting at the foot of my bed, which left me puzzled. Without saying a word, I picked up the book.

As I began to flip through its pages, my heart raced as I recognized the names of friends from high school, family members, and even acquaintances like Mr. Thompson.

Each page contained a detailed account of a person's death, with dates approaching rapidly. Goosebumps prickled my arms; was this all just a cruel joke?

I attempted to dismiss it as a product of someone's dark imagination, but the more pages I turned, the more dread coiled in my stomach.

Eventually, I became consumed by the book, searching for any means to avert the impending deaths, knowing that if I didn't take action, I would lose everyone I cared about.

I was attempting to reach out to several people to inform them about what might happen to them, but they either ignored me or claimed to be too busy.

Just then, my phone rang, and I glanced down to see it was Ryan, my best friend since elementary school.

""Hey Willy, are you busy?"" he greeted me with a cheerful and carefree tone.

""Uh - not really, but I need to discuss something very important with you,"" I replied, feeling a knot of panic in my throat.

Should I really share the details about the Prophetic Pages book and what occurred with Mr. Thompson? He would probably just laugh or hang up on me immediately.

""Sure, what's going on, dude?"" he inquired.

I fell silent, hesitating as I struggled to find the right words to explain the book that was essentially about death to my best friend.

""Um, just... be cautious, alright? I came across something online that made me worry we might be in danger,"" I said.

""Are you referring to that illness happening in Russia?"" he chuckled, though I could sense the worry seeping into his voice.

""Just promise me you'll take it easy, okay? Don't do anything reckless,"" I snapped back.

""Yeah, alright. I promise,"" he assured me, and I felt a slight sense of relief, though it was short-lived.

I was about to end the call when Ryan mentioned he had a question for me, and since I was already on the line, I figured I might as well hear him out.

""Dude, I'm going to a horror movie showing today and was wondering if you wanted to come along. You probably need a break from whatever's going on in that head of yours,"" Ryan suggested.

""Um - okay, I guess I'll see you there,"" I replied.

After hanging up, I let out a soft sigh and looked down to see the Prophetic Pages book still resting on my lap, now opened to a different page.

Ryan Orangewood - 26 years old - shot in the forehead and robbed on April 15th, 2024.

As soon as I noticed my phone slip from my grasp, I shut the book and picked it up, tossing it across my room and watching it land with a loud thud.

""Oh God no,"" I thought as I rose from the bed.

Without uttering another word, I gathered everything I needed, leaving the book on the floor, and dashed downstairs to tell Mom and Dad everything that had happened.

However, when I reached the lower level of the house, I found it eerily quiet; no one was around. The only thing that caught my eye was a note taped to the front door. I approached it silently, took it down, and read it.

Dear William, I’m sorry, but your father and I had to leave for work early due to an important meeting. We’ll be back by lunchtime. If you decide to go out with a friend or by yourself, please call us. See you later, love Mom.

I didn’t care much for the note, crumpling it up before sprinting out of the house. I hopped on my bike and pedaled away as fast as I could.

A few minutes later, I arrived at the town square, parked my bike in the rack, locked it up, and hurried to the movie theater, hoping Ryan wouldn’t actually be there.

But there he was, leaning against the side of the building, engrossed in his phone. When he noticed me, a smile broke across his face.

""There you are! I was just about to call you and ask what on earth happened to you,"" Ryan remarked.

""I got caught up with something else. Let's just finish this movie so I can head home and wrap up my work,"" I replied, raising my hands in a gesture of exasperation.

I resolved to share everything with Ryan after the movie, once we left the theater. I hoped he would understand, given his love for horror films, and that he wouldn't think I was insane.

A couple of hours later, the movie concluded, and we stood outside the theater. I opened my mouth, ready to explain everything to Ryan, but he quickly silenced me.

""I know you rode your bike here, but let's head to that smoothie shop just a few minutes away. Your bike will be fine, and if it gets stolen, you can hold me responsible,"" Ryan suggested.

Before long, we were strolling down the street in silence, and I let out a soft sigh before clearing my throat.

""Ryan, remember how much I enjoy yard sales and how I love buying things from them?"" I said.

Ryan nodded silently, as he often did when I had something to share, knowing that my words were usually significant.

""At this yard sale, I stumbled upon a box filled with books, and one caught my eye called Prophetic Pages. Initially, I assumed it was just an old, dull read, but it turns out it contains a page that predicts when everyone I care about will die. Just a few days ago, my neighbor, Mr. Thompson, passed away from a heart attack, and his name was listed in the book, along with the exact date of his death, as if it had foreseen it,"" I explained.

""So, is it like a death book or something?"" Ryan inquired.

""I have no idea what it is. There was even a page for you that stated you would get shot in the head and robbed today,"" I replied, my voice tinged with worry.

I anticipated Ryan's reaction, hoping he would show concern or suggest we head home right away, but instead, he burst into laughter as if I had just shared a hilarious joke.

""Dude, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard from you in all our years of friendship,"" Ryan chuckled.

There it was; I knew he wouldn't take me seriously. He was going to mock me and label me as crazy. I regretted mentioning the Prophetic Pages book at all.

As we walked past an alley, a man who appeared older than us suddenly emerged. He wore a white shirt beneath blue overalls and black boots, but what caught my attention was the white mask with black eyeholes and the object he was gripping tightly.

It was a gun, and in that instant, I realized I had to intervene before things escalated.

Before either Ryan or I could react, the man raised the gun and shot Ryan directly in the forehead. I stood frozen, watching in horror as my friend collapsed to the ground, lifeless.

Bystanders nearby gasped in shock and screamed at the unfolding scene, but the man discarded the gun and pounced on Ryan like a wild animal, rifling through his pockets with frantic urgency.

I was astonished that the Prophetic Pages had claimed yet another life; it appeared to have knowledge of all my friends and acquaintances, predicting who would be next.

Before long, days turned into weeks, and I had almost forgotten what had happened to Ryan. However, the Prophetic Pages remained etched in my mind, and I was determined to protect my friends and family.

It wasn't until I stumbled upon a page for my father that I felt an overwhelming urge to scream and tear the Prophetic Pages apart.

Samuel Johnson - 53 years old - dies in car accident on April 30th, 2023

Realizing that this date was less than a week away, I became frantic and desperate to find a way to prevent my Dad's death.

I needed answers, so I began flipping through the book, hoping the Prophetic Pages might offer a solution. That’s when I discovered a name tucked away in the back of the book.

Daniel Roberts - 25 years old - Passed away from loneliness on May 15, 2023 
(Still Alive Owned Book Before)

I was astounded; this guy had owned the Prophetic Pages before me, yet he was somehow still alive. I knew I had to find him.

I took out my phone and began searching online, eventually finding an old news forum where Daniel had shared his experiences with the Prophetic Pages. I felt compelled to reach out to him, so I sent Daniel an email, pouring out my heart and hoping against all odds that he would respond.

To my surprise, Daniel replied. He seemed somewhat withdrawn, yet he agreed to meet me at a downtown coffee shop to discuss things.

Gathering all the essentials, I made my way to the coffee shop, arriving early to secure a seat. Anxiety washed over me, and my stomach twisted into knots.

When Daniel Roberts entered the coffee shop, I instantly recognized him from the photo he had sent. He appeared older, with graying hair and a weary expression. However, his eyes were sharp, as if he had witnessed too much in his life.

""I received your email. You're in trouble, aren't you?"" he asked, taking a seat across from me.

I simply nodded my head, then retrieved the Prophetic Pages from my bag, sliding it across the table.

""I discovered this book at a yard sale and... realized it foretold the deaths of my neighbor and friend - both are gone - and all the names I know are listed in there. Can I prevent it?"" I said.

Daniel gazed at me for a long time without uttering a word; his brows were knitted together, and then he let out a soft sigh before meeting my gaze.

""You can't alter what has been inscribed in the Prophetic Pages. I’ve attempted to do so, and it only worsened the situation. The book has its own will. It unveils the truth, but it doesn’t permit you to change it,"" Daniel clarified.

""What should I do then?"" I inquired, my voice filled with desperation, my hands shaking.

""Just accept it; you can’t battle fate, but you can treasure the time you have left with them,"" Daniel replied gently.

In other words, the cannabis habit itself probably isn’t the decisive factor. What matters to you, as a sapiosexual, is whether their mind stays sharp, curious, and alive, or whether it dulls into clichés and surface-level chatter.

Last summer I was in a very dark place. In the last year I have turned my life around and have found hope again.

Last summer I was very close to doing something that would have meant I'd no longer be in this realm. Thankfully I was able to reach deep within myself and pull myself out, one day at a time and heal myself.

I was obese (and had been for a decade), I was divorced and grieving, sad about not seeing my kids, I had lost my job due to burnout and poor mental health, and I had no friends and no one to talk to. I was emotionally neglected by my parents as a child and I had come out as a trans as a teen and was rejected. I carried those wounds with me for over 20 years and let them define me and poison every relationship I ever had. I had reach out to acquainatances and family and was open about how I was feeling at got no help. I felt I had no reason to hang on other than to stay around so as to not hurting my kids by leaving. I had lost hope. And I felt like I had failed at my transition. I had no body conidence, no social confidence. I self-isolated at home and ate my feelings.

What I am saying is that I was in a very dark and bad place and felt there was no way to turn it around.

Today, a year on, I am less than 2 weeks away from having bottom surgery, I am social again and making new friends, I lost 25kg (55lbs) in under a year, lost 3 dress sizes, and now love my body. I go jogging 4–5 times a week. I love clothes shopping and find nice things in my size that look good on me. I get compliments on how healthy and happy I am and how great I look. I see strangers look at me when I am out running. I have hope again. I want to live, not just for my kids but for me. I want to live long enough to see my great-grandkids. I want to date again and find out what it's like to be in a relationship with a man as a woman. I have new career goals. I have job opportunities lined up for me after surgery.

I did that. I made that happen. No one else did. I made that happen because I decided to care about that broken child inside me, hold her and tell her every day she was loved and she mattered. I turned up for myself every day. I exercised at home. I ate protein and salads and skipped meals. I learned how to break my emotional connection with food and to instead eat for fuel. I limited my social media and instead read and listened to music. I went for walks and fed the ducks in winter. As I lost weight and started to get a figure (which I had never had before) I found it easier to find clothes in store and I started to regularly shop for new, nice clothes and care about how I dressed and presented myself. I got fitted for my first bra, I got a nice hair cut, I got my eyebrows done professionally, I started laser hair removal.

I overcome my social anxiety and opened myself to others. I healed myself and was no longer afraid to be alone. I became my own best friend, my own parent. I was no longer needy or desperate for attention from others. Ironically, the less reliant on other's attention I became, the more attractive to others I was, and people wanted to hang out with me.

This life is really hard. Doubly so for trans people. And the sad truth of it is that we are really alone. No one else will care about you or your life like you will. No one is thinking about you or paying attention to you. That may sound depressing, but it is a blessing. You have the time and space to better yourself and your life. You have it within you to be what you need. Be your own best friend, be your own parent, be your own older sibling.

Care about your own life because you deserve to be happy. Turn up for yourself every day. Love the child that is within you. Give them the love that should have gotten but never did.

I am not promising your life will change over night. In fact I know it won't. But be kind to yourself every day, put in the work, and one day, in a couple of months, you'll realise that your heart is lighter, your step has a little bounce, your mind is clearer, your thoughts more positive, and your smile bigger.

- Budget £500
- UK based
- Looking to buy in the next few months, not immediately, happy to wait for sales/deals
- We mostly drink flat whites, lattes, mochas but I’m keen to explore and experiment with espresso 
- Relatively small space in kitchen so don’t want massive machines
- Some basic experience with grinding, pulling shots and steaming milk

Current ideas are the Bambino Plus combined with the DF54 or Encore ESP to start, then gradually add accessories and upgrade things like the portafilter.

Midnight (deep blue/blackish shade)

Red (bold pop of color)

Dark green (unique but still wearable)


For context: most of my clothes are black, shades of blue, shades of red, and gray (I think I fall into the “dark winter” palette). That makes me a little unsure — would midnight blend in too much? Should I go neutral for versatility, or lean into a color like red or dark green for contrast?

Ying turned away from the panda enclosure, laughing. 

'You stole that joke.'

'I know, but I've been desperate to say it since we got here.'

Usually, zoos in Asia were pretty harrowing affairs, but in Chengdu, the panda enclosure was big and green, and the bears were chewing on stick after stick of bamboo.

'Did you ever meet any family who had two children?' 

She shook her head. 

'Rich families can do, yes, but not poor, because big fines…People would have children in secret and the children would disappear…'

'Jesus Christ.' 

Whenever I asked my girlfriend questions about the past, I came away feeling depressed, but at the same time, there was this kind of itch that felt good to scratch, even if it resulted in some psychic blood. 

A few days earlier, when we'd been approaching Chengdu from the airport, I'd pointed at a skyscraper, brightly lit in CyberPunk neon.  

'It was rebuilt after the earthquake,' she said. 

'There was an earthquake?' 

'In 2008.' 

She slipped off her sandal and showed me a scar on her left foot. 'A falling roof tile.' And then she continued typing away on her phone.

'Wait,' I said, 'where were you when it happened?' 

'In school. All the kids were taking an afternoon nap—we do that in China—even in middle school, and then everything started shaking and we ran outside.' 

You'd think being in an earthquake would be something you'd tell your boyfriend, but then again, we'd only been seeing each other for six months, and Ying was always coming out with things that'd shocked me.  

We came away from the panda enclosure to get a coffee, and her Mam called her.  

I liked listening to her on the phone. She'd tried to teach me Chinese, but it was as indecipherable as 5 am bird song.

There was something wrong this time. She put her hand to her mouth, and her cheeks flushed red. 

'It's my grandfather,' she said, hanging up, 'he's dead.'

…

We discussed whether I should go home, but it was difficult logistically, and I think she wanted me to stay. 

When we got to her grandparents' farm, we were shown to a shipping container with a wooden floor and no toilet. Our choices were to go inside the farmhouse or use the communal one beside the pigsty. I chose the outdoor one because I didn't really want to take a shit with a dead Chinese man in the next room. 

As we lay on the camp bed that night, she told me more stories. 

'We lived here after the earthquake. Our house in the city was too unsafe.'

'How long for?' 

'Nine months.'

She started unpacking her designer suitcase. She wasn't rich, but she enjoyed nice things and was willing to work to afford them. The pink of the suitcase was garish beside the unpainted, unadorned, corrugated walls of our coffin. 

She reached over to a chest of drawers and stopped. 

'I remember the first night we stayed here. I looked into those drawers and there were six baby rats, all pink with no fur—and they were squirming in there on the torn-up newspaper.' 

She opened the drawer, and it was empty, but I still didn't get much sleep that night. 

…

The following day, we were awoken by the sound of gunfire. 

'What the fuck is that?' 

I jumped out of bed. 

'Firecrackers,' she answered, 'on the first morning we set off firecrackers.' 

We wrapped white bandanas around our heads. Close family wore a white sheet and a kind of KKK hood. It was funny because there was a Buddhist symbol on the funeral wreath, the swastika, which the Nazis had appropriated. 

We went inside the main house, and her grandma sat dull-eyed as different members of the family led her shuffling from one room to the next.  

I tried to stay inconspicuous in the corner, which was hard because I was white, and most of the villagers had never seen a white person before. 

After the firecrackers, A Feng Shui Master went into the dead man's room, lit some incense, and chanted incantations to make sure his spirit had safely departed. 

He was a Feng Shui Master, but he had some leftover breakfast crumbs in his beard. 

Ying's Mam was doing what Chinese Mams do, and Ying was becoming increasingly pissed off because Ying was not a good Chinese daughter. 

We were grandly introduced to the family as 'future husband and wife.' 

'I need to get the fuck away from these people.' Ying snapped 

We walked across the family rice field and into a copse of trees away from the house. 

'You know, I go away and I miss her and I feel guilty, and then I come home and I remember why I left.' 

She reached inside her bedsheet and pulled out a cigarette. 

'It's the same everywhere,' I returned tamely.

'When I was growing up, it was all study study study and now it's all marry marry marry. When the fuck is the rest time?' 

'When you're dead,' I answered. 

'My grandparents, they on this farm 7 days a week for 40 years.' She paused, taking a drag. 'And just when they gonna retire, my grandfather dies…Imagine that, you work all that time for your peace and then you get the ultimate rest…'

We cuddled silently in the grove and then went back inside. Now, her grandma was in the corner, and people filed by her like the Cenotaph. In the opposite corner, the grandfather lay like a waxwork. 

The next part of the ceremony was called the *wrapping of the blankets*. People approached the dead man's coffin and laid a blanket on top of the corpse. Beside the coffin, there was a picture of him. 

'Why does he look so serious?' I said. 

'We always do in official pictures.' 

'But he's wearing an Adidas 3 stripe t-shirt.' I tried to suppress a smile. 

'He was a farmer! Adidas was a very fancy brand for him.'

Behind them was a group of women wailing as the blanket ceremony came to an end. 

'Are they his sisters?' 

She rolled her eyes. 'No, they don't even know each other.' 

'Then why are they so upset?' 

'Tradition. They're paid to be here. It's stupid, I know, but old people think it adds…weight.'

I kept looking at her grandma, who'd remained motionless throughout the whole thing. She was a giant on whose shoulders Ying had stood, looking out over the horizon, past the sludge of Imperial Japan and Mao Zedong and the Cultural Revolution. 

All the blankets were in place. The funeral director went to place the coffin's lid and cover the old man when a guttural cry broke free from the old lady, and she stumbled out of the clutches of the mourners and spread herself over the dead body. 

Everyone rushed toward her, and Ying and I got swept up in the melee. The sound was more animal than human, and then she started screaming in Chinese.

'What's she saying!? What's she saying!? 'I said. 

I knew the old lady was asking a question, and although I had no idea what it meant, I wanted it desperately to be answered. ""谁将和我一起吃这些豆子呢？豆子都该怎么办？""

**\[End of archived thread\]**

**Conclusion:**

I've been staring at this screen for hours. 38 people died that night. THIRTY-EIGHT. I cross-referenced every username with missing persons reports, obituaries, anything I could find. The correlation is impossible to ignore.

Whatever that ""admin"" entity was, it turned a simple forum thread into a feeding ground. And those Foundation people... they treated this ""nullification process"" like a standard operating procedure. Seven of their own people died to stop it.

But here's what keeps me awake: I found this archived thread. Which means it's somwhat still out there. What if the entity is still in there, waiting? What if finding this archive was exactly what it wanted?

I'm posting this because I need help. I need other people to research this, to tell me I'm going insane. Because the alternative - that there are horrors lurking in the depths of the internet, and secret organizations killing people to eraze them - is too terrifying to face alone.

If anyone has information about The Threshold Foundation, please reach out. We need to know what else they're hiding.

**ADDENDUM - FOUNDATION FINAL REPORT**

*Document classification: OPERATION FAILURE - BURIAL PROTOCOL ENACTED*

The above document has been intercepted before publication. Civilian investigation of Exploration Log 2007-10-31 represents unacceptable security breach.

Corrective actions taken:

* Wayback Machine archive purged via technical intervention
* User internet\_digger\_0407 location triangulated and suppression protocols enacted
* Digital forensics team deployed to eliminate remaining traces

This incident demonstrates the catastrophic risks of allowing anomalous entities to proliferate in digital spaces. Future protocols must emphasize immediate intervention before civilian contact.

Jk lol. Well, sort of. 

I’m a 3L who summered at a V30 (DC office) and is a campus ambassador for the firm. Because of the new insane timeline of biglaw recruiting (with 1L summer recruiting happening as early as October and 2L as early as December/January) my firm has enlisted our help to recruit/find people who would be a good fit for the firm personality/culture wise. Obviously, being at Georgetown, the grades will matter to a lesser extent. Georgetown is also the most highly represented school at the firm (at least it was, this summer). 

In any case, the firm will pay for us to have a meal/coffee with 1Ls who are interested in biglaw and the firm specifically, so feel free to comment or reach out via PM if you are interested and we can set something up. This isn’t an interview, but it’s a chance to recruit people who would be a good culture fit for the office and the firm as a whole. It’s also fun because I get to meet cool new people—I’m always impressed at how much everybody here has accomplished. 

Feel free to ask questions if you have any and I hope that orientation week is going well for you all!

1mvd2zf,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFriendsFriendsClub/comments/1mvd2zf/my_review_on_moto_metabolism_pills/,My Review on Moto Metabolism Pills Multi-Ingredient Weight Loss Formula: Comparison with other weight loss supplements,"**My Rating: 2.4/5 stars**

[**Moto Metabolism Pills**](https://wholesomehealth.cc/out/motometabolism.php) represent the classic ""better than nothing but not by much"" category. If you're someone who wants the psychological boost of taking a weight loss supplement and you're already doing the hard work of diet and exercise, it might provide modest support. However, at this price point, you'd likely get better results buying high-quality chromium picolinate and a separate B-complex vitamin.

The reality is that most people would see identical results by simply drinking 2-3 cups of quality green tea daily and taking a basic multivitamin. This formula feels designed more for marketing appeal than therapeutic effectiveness, which is unfortunately common in the weight loss supplement space.

Currently, I'd recommend [**Phen**](https://wholesomehealth.cc/out/phenq2.php) **and** [**HourGlass Fit**](https://wholesomehealth.cc/out/hourglassfit.php) **over this multi-ingredient formula** for one simple reason: focused effectiveness beats scattered attempts every time.

While Moto Metabolism tries to do everything with underwhelming doses, **Phen** delivers serious appetite suppression through proven ingredients like a-Lacys Reset and Capsimax, while **HourGlass Fit** provides reliable hunger control specifically designed for sustainable weight management.

From my first-hand observations, people get frustrated with ""kitchen sink"" formulas like this one because you never know which ingredient is working (if any), whereas Phen and HourGlass Fit have clear, researched mechanisms that actually move the needle on weight loss.

The chromium in Moto Metabolism pills formula might help with cravings, but why settle for ""might help"" when you could get the consistent, predictable appetite suppression that makes the difference between another failed diet attempt and actual results? At this price point, you're better off investing in a supplement that specializes in what you need most - appetite control - rather than getting minimal doses of everything.

After years of testing/reviewing various weight loss supplements, I'd approach Moto Metabolism formula with cautious optimism at best. If you're looking for a comprehensive supplement that hits multiple pathways, this product attempts to cover all the bases - but that's both its strength and weakness.

**How It May Benefit You**

Based on first-hand experiences I've observed with these ingredients, this supplement could provide modest benefits if you're just starting your weight loss journey. The **chromium** component might help with those afternoon sugar cravings that derail many people's progress. I've seen users report feeling more satisfied after meals when taking chromium consistently, though the effects are usually subtle rather than dramatic.

The green tea extract could give you a slight metabolic boost - think of it as adding an extra 50-100 calories of daily burn, not the fat-melting miracle some expect. If you're someone who struggles with energy for workouts, the modest caffeine content might provide just enough kick without the jitters.

The B-complex vitamins are where this formula might surprise you. I've witnessed people discover that addressing nutritional deficiencies significantly reduced their constant hunger signals. If you're eating a restricted diet, these vitamins could help your body function more efficiently during weight loss.

**Where Moto Metabolism** **Falls Short**

Here's my honest assessment: this feels like a ""kitchen sink"" approach that throws multiple ingredients together without optimizing any single pathway effectively. The chromium dose at 600mcg is reasonable, but the green tea extract amount isn't specified clearly, making it impossible to know if you're getting therapeutic levels.

From first-hand observations, multi-ingredient formulas like this often underperform compared to focused, single-ingredient approaches. You're essentially getting a little bit of everything but not enough of anything to create meaningful change.

**Recommended Usage for Weight Loss**

If you decide to try this, I'd recommend taking it with your largest meal of the day to maximize the chromium's glucose-stabilizing effects. Start with one capsule daily for the first week to assess tolerance, especially if you're sensitive to B vitamins or caffeine.

Don't expect dramatic results - this is more of a supportive tool than a primary weight loss driver. Combine it with consistent calorie tracking and regular exercise for any realistic chance of success.

**Pros & Cons**

**Pros:**

* Covers multiple metabolic pathways in one formula
* B-vitamin complex may address hidden deficiencies affecting appetite
* Chromium dose is within therapeutic range
* Convenient single-supplement approach

**Cons:**

* Ingredient amounts may be too low for meaningful effects
* No clear dosing information for green tea extract
* Multi-ingredient formulas often create more side effects
* Expensive way to get basic nutrients you could obtain separately

**Recommended alternatives**

Currently, I'd recommend [**Phen**](https://wholesomehealth.cc/out/phenq2.php) **and** [**HourGlass Fit**](https://wholesomehealth.cc/out/hourglassfit.php) **over this supplement.**

**Ingredient Breakdown**

**Vitamin B12 (2.4mcg):** A basic maintenance dose that won't hurt but likely won't provide the energy boost many hope for unless you're actually deficient.

**Chromium Picolinate (600mcg):** This is the star ingredient here - a solid dose that could genuinely help with glucose metabolism and reducing carb cravings in some users.

**Green Tea Extract (270mg):** Without knowing the EGCG content, this could be anywhere from mildly helpful to completely ineffective for fat burning.

**Black Cumin Seed Extract (200mg):** An interesting addition with potential anti-inflammatory benefits, though the weight loss evidence is limited and mostly from small studies.

**Capsicum Extract (1mg):** This tiny amount is essentially worthless - you'd get more thermogenic benefit from adding hot sauce to your meals.

**Bottom Line**

This supplement represents the classic ""better than nothing but not by much"" category. If you're someone who wants the psychological boost of taking a weight loss supplement and you're already doing the hard work of diet and exercise, it might provide modest support. However, at this price point, you'd likely get better results buying high-quality chromium picolinate and a separate B-complex vitamin.

The reality is that most people would see identical results by simply drinking 2-3 cups of quality green tea daily and taking a basic multivitamin. This formula feels designed more for marketing appeal than therapeutic effectiveness, which is unfortunately common in the weight loss supplement space.

**My Performance Evaluation: Moto Metabolism Weight Loss Formula**

**Performance Ratings (1-5 Scale)**

**Appetite Suppression: 2.5/5** The chromium picolinate at 600mcg could provide modest appetite control for some users, but the minimal capsicum dose and unclear green tea extract potency severely limit overall hunger suppression effectiveness. You might notice slightly reduced cravings, but nothing approaching the reliable appetite control of dedicated suppressants.

**Metabolism Boost: 2/5** The green tea extract and tiny capsicum amount provide negligible thermogenic effects - you'd burn more calories walking to the mailbox than this formula would add to your daily expenditure. Without knowing the EGCG content or having meaningful doses of proven metabolic enhancers, this is essentially metabolic theater.

**Energy Enhancement: 3/5** The B-vitamin complex could provide genuine energy improvement if you're deficient, and the modest caffeine from green tea won't cause crashes like synthetic stimulants. However, if you already eat a balanced diet and drink coffee, you'll likely notice zero additional energy boost.

**Stimulant-like Effects: 1.5/5** This formula is designed to avoid strong stimulant effects, which means minimal jitters or crashes but also minimal noticeable impact. The green tea's caffeine content is so low you'd get more stimulation from a cup of weak tea.

**Fat Burning: 2/5** The combination lacks the proven fat-burning compounds in therapeutic doses needed for meaningful lipolysis - you're looking at maybe an extra 20-30 calories burned daily at best. The black cumin seed extract is interesting but unproven for fat loss in humans.

**Safety Profile: 4/5** This is probably the formula's strongest point - the conservative dosing means very low risk of adverse effects for most users. The ingredients are well-tolerated individually, though some people might experience mild stomach upset from the B-vitamins if taken on an empty stomach.

**User Reviews: 2.5/5** Based on similar multi-ingredient formulas I've observed, expect mixed reviews with many people reporting ""no noticeable effects"" and others claiming modest improvements that could easily be placebo. The lack of standout ingredients makes dramatic testimonials unlikely.

**Price/Value for Money ($29): 2/5** At $29, you're paying premium pricing for basic ingredients in subtherapeutic doses - you could buy quality chromium picolinate and a B-complex separately for under $15 and get better results. This represents poor value compared to focused, effective alternatives in the same price range.
