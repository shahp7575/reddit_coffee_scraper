I‚Äôm looking for a female to take over my lease at **The Dean Campustown (708 S 6th St, Champaign)**. **This post is up = the room is still available.**

* **Lease term:** Dec 20, 2025 ‚Äì Jul 31, 2026
* **Unit type:** D2 floor plan ‚Äì **4 bed, 2 bath (shared bathroom)**
* **Rent:** $1075/month, but I‚Äôm offering it for **$975 (negotiable)**
* **Room:** 10th floor, great light and quiet view
* **Link to floor plan:** [The Dean Campustown ‚Äì D2](https://www.thedean.com/campustown/floor-plans/)

# About the apartment

* Fully furnished (bed, desk + chair, dresser, closet, sofa, coffee table, etc.)
* In-unit washer & dryer
* Kitchen with oven, microwave, dishwasher, full-size fridge
* Central A/C and heating

# Building amenities

* Gym & study lounges
* Pool + rooftop lounge (really nice view)
* 24/7 front desk and security
* Package delivery & free printing

# Roommate situation

* You‚Äôll be living with **two female roommates** (both quiet, respectful, and clean).
* It‚Äôs a **female-only** sublease.

# My honest experience

I‚Äôve enjoyed living here ‚Äì the building is very new, so everything feels modern and comfortable.

* **Maintenance is fast**: whenever I submitted a request, someone usually came within hours. Even late at night (like if I locked myself out or if the A/C broke), staff came to help.
* **Water pressure is great**, showers are quick and efficient.
* **Feels safe** with the front desk and key fob access.
* Downsides: a bit pricey for me; printers occasionally run out of paper/ink; and the walls aren‚Äôt super soundproof, but my roommates are quiet so it‚Äôs not been a big issue. I want to be upfront about both the good and the not-so-good so you know what to expect.

I might not always check Reddit DMs right away, so the best way to reach me is by **email: zisha0068@gmail.com**. Happy to send photos or give more details.

I‚Äôve been in the restaurant industry for about 7 years now, and I think I‚Äôm officially burnt out. Every time I think about going back to this job, I get into a horrible, horrible mood to the point where I don‚Äôt even care about giving good service anymore.

One thing that stood out to me is that when I applied for this job, it seemed like I was the only person who did. My city has a local Instagram page and about a week ago they posted a thread of places that were supposedly hiring. I applied to 4 different places, but this was the only one that called me back.  I thought I could do this thing again cause why not. I also was in a bery food mood while applying but It makes me feel like no one else applied here because everyone already knows the restaurant industry is rough unless you‚Äôre cut out for it.

I‚Äôve realized I‚Äôm not cut out for it anymore. I‚Äôve worked in bars and restaurants for 7 years, and I just can‚Äôt stand another second of it. I‚Äôve already been applying to other jobs like coffee shops, tea shops, receptionist gigs, dispensaries ‚Äî anything that would be a better fit while I‚Äôm still studying.

What makes this harder is my boyfriend. We both need jobs and I don‚Äôt want to disappoint or upset him. I even tried to convince him to try serving, but he knows he‚Äôs not cut out for it either. I feel like I‚Äôm letting him down if I quit this job and i should suck it up but I also know this isn‚Äôt a good fit for me and I won‚Äôt give good service if I‚Äôm miserable.

I guess I just needed to get this off my chest. Has anyone else been in this position? Thank you for your time and please be respectful in the comments",1,1759342233.0,confessions,0,1.0,False

I started having whey from last 3 days. I take it late in evening. I wish to have dinner afterwards to complete my daily intake and calories (limited to 1200-1400 a day) but even though i feel hungry but i am not able to eat anything.

I feel empty hungry but when food is in front of me , i do not wish to eat it. I bought so lil food on the table (50gm paneer sabzi and dahi on table) but was able to complete half only. Like after 2-3 bites i felt full. I barely covered eating 1100 calories today with this.

Yesterday i prepared dinner to eat but afterwards i lost my diet?


No, i am not talking about only healthy food. I have some chips/popcorn lying in front of me but i do not feel like eating anything. But i am in this sleep deprived headache space.


Is it supposed to be like this??

Am i doing something wrong??



Whole diet for today:

Morning empty stomach: Black coffee hot

Breakfast: half papaya (200gm) + half apple 

Lunch: 1 besan chilla (20gm protein) with 1 spoon oil + salt + oregano

70gm Paneer made with milk (made from 600ml mother dairy low fat milk) 

Dahi (from low fat milk) 120gm

Salad one small kheera + half beetroot

Evening: 
Cappuccino small cup
Green tea


Late evening: 
1 sachet of Amul Protein whey 


Dinner: 
Paneer 20gm cooked in 1 spoon oil with rai jeera capsicum and tomato (used 1 medium capsicum and tomato to cook around 120gm paneer)

half katori homemade yoghurt made from low fat milk


I forced myself to have this. I am hungry but not hungry actually.

BACKGROUND: I (16f) have liked my friend (16f) two times including now. I liked her from around august-December 2024 and now have liked her since September. I recently found out when i first liked her that she liked me back but we were both immature. I struggle very bad with internalized homophobia and i dont really know how to cope with it? not just that but its also that we are in a trio and the other girl is very religious and she claims to not care about my sexuality but i still always feel judged.

Story?: okay so it all started with one week where we just happened to hang out on a monday. however then we hung out Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday after that. we had only ever hung out alone before that time. i should mention that our hangs outs were mainly like going to a coffee shop and doing homework together then just getting food and eating together then her taking me home around 11.   recently we have been hanging out alot and it became apparently obvious i liked her, around two weeks ago i actually told her and i couldnt keep it from her. I was scared she would stop hanging out with me and find me weird however she didnt, my plan was to kinda just only let  her know i like her and keep our other friend out of it. recently though its just eating at me and i dont know what to do and ultimately i want to get  over her, theres no particular reason other than i just cant do it yk.. sorry if this was useless i just need advice PLEASEE

UPDATE: i still very much want to keep our friendship normal and no longer akward but i thought i should add that",4,1759342184.0,Advice,5,1.0,False

**CIDRE D‚ÄôAUTOMNE (Freshly pressed heirloom varietal fall apples delicately blended with subtle autumnal spices)** In the vial: this smells like an extremely realistic overripe apple, the mealy red variety specifically. On the skin: similar, though unfortunately it becomes a touch less realistic, a bit more fresh and cologny. It‚Äôs really not a sweet nor tart apple, just an overripe red delicious. I can barely detect any spices, perhaps the lightest touch of cinnamon and clove? Overall I think this is very simple but successful at being exactly what it describes (overripe apples with a very light touch of spices), so if you‚Äôre an apple lover, I think you‚Äôll like it. The only thing I‚Äôll warn about is: something about this smells very fresh (maybe they were going for ‚Äúbreeze‚Äù, or maybe it‚Äôs the alcoholic component of overripe apples), which may push this into freshener territory. For me it‚Äôs a pretty enough scent, **7/10**.

**FALLING LEAVES ALCHEMY (September 2025) (sweet maple sap, fallen heirloom orchard apples, warm blonde woods, a whisper of suede, and sultry gourmand musks swirling like golden leaves in the breath of the North wind.)** In the vial: a rather realistic maple syrup, not overly sweet. On the skin: an acrid note comes out, not detectable in the vial. Some sort of musk that‚Äôs not present in other Alkemias? It smells borderline burnt. The apples are barely there, and crisp. This was my first ever Alkemia and I remember liking it a bit more - my initial notes said this was heavily leather, but I guess it‚Äôs settled after a year? I think I would‚Äôve taken the leather - this burnt musk smell overtakes almost everything else, though there is still a touch of salty leather. I‚Äôm not sure what they were going for with this one - it‚Äôs not maple, not their usual gentle blonde woods, not particularly leathery and not very gourmand. I wish they brought this sort of musk back to experiment with it, because it‚Äôs quite unisex and I enjoy the strange smokiness, but it needs to have other things going on for it. **4/10**

**RUBY AMBER (crimson pomegranates, ruby amber, Tolu balsam, benzoin, styrax, star anise, and guaiac wood.)** In the vial: syrupy pomegranate with a bit of a powdery-balsamic (benzoin?) background. On the skin: the pomegranate luckily does not steal the show, it doesn‚Äôt scream ‚ÄúTHIS IS A POMEGRANATE SCENT‚Äù in the way i.e. Scarlet Kiss screams strawberry. There is something almost boozy/fermented about it. It‚Äôs quite rich. The rest is, as you‚Äôd expect, purely balsams and wood (I don‚Äôt get much star anise). It‚Äôs not lemony-balsamic like myrrh or cozy woods like cashmeran, it‚Äôs more on the powdery and warm-spicy side. I‚Äôm not an expert on what guaiac smells like but I think this is mostly that. It dries into this slightly powdery-spicy, warm resinous wood. While Scarlet Kiss is a very spring-like, bright strawberry lip oil smell, this is an autumn nighttime scent. It‚Äôs a fairly basic spiced amber with a pomegranate twist, I would only warn that the pomegranate borders on too sweet and rich rather than tart and fresh. It‚Äôs comfy and if you‚Äôre very into balsams you may like it, but it‚Äôs a bit too heavy and powdery for me, and in the final drydown all these elements come together into something almost acrid that‚Äôs a bit overwhelming for me. I can‚Äôt see myself ever reaching for this, **3/10**

**CHERIE (white cherries, golden saffron, vanilla orchid, neroli blossoms, nutmeg, coriander, cedarwood, guaiac wood, and ambergris incense.)** In the vial: an immediate punch of cherries! There is also something a bit salty, and definitely orchid. On the skin: still smells very much like syrupy (not fresh) cherries, with a strong helping of neroli. This and the vanilla are making it a very very sweet scent, in a preserved cherries way. Luckily it immediately brightens as it dries, because the opening was way too much! It gets more floral right off the bat, I get a bit of a sugared orchid and still a bright, dewy neroli. The ambergris incense is not very present, the base is sort of a clean cedar. This one smells a bit more mainstream perfume-y, it has the right elements: a clean woody base with a touch of warm guaiac and nutmeg, medium floral notes, and a top cherry note which is sadly quite fleeting - I wish there was a middle point between the opening and the drydown. I think a touch of the cherries are still there and it‚Äôs just easy to go nose blind to them, though. The vanilla doesn‚Äôt shine here for me but it may be contributing to the warmth of the base. The final scent is a bit odd: it‚Äôs a warm-spicy floral, but it has something‚Ä¶ effervescent/sparkly about it? Like it should have a champagne note. Again, the drydown on this is radically different from the opening, it‚Äôs kind of a pretty effervescent cherry smell with some sugary florals but I wish it‚Äôd stayed somewhere in the middle. But it‚Äôs nice enough, **7/10**

**CHERRIES OF THE NIGHT (Black cherries, Maraschino liqueur, cherry amber, musky black amber, dark spiced rum, warm nutmeg, and Peru balsam)** In the vial: a richer, boozier cherry than Cherie. On the skin: cherries and raisins, a bit of liquor. Less overwhelming than I‚Äôd thought, the musk blends it quite well to the skin. Worth noting that this is a very thick oil, rather than some of their thinner, clearer ones that take a while to absorb - it morphs a lot but slowly at the beginning. Compared to Cherie the cherries are very dark, definitely Maraschino liquor, as well as raisin-heavy rum, but there is a very strong amber base to this. It doesn‚Äôt have the scratchy, acrid note that Ruby Amber did that didn‚Äôt gel well with me, but this is very heady and thick. The spices are there, but light, giving this a bit of a mulled cherry wine vibe - vs Cherie‚Äôs lightly cherry-flavored champagne. This is not a bright, realistic cherry, though the cherry note is well done - it‚Äôs very much a nighttime, elegant/mature fragrance that‚Äôs a bit sexy. I like it! It‚Äôs a **8/10** because I‚Äôm not obsessed, but I might or might not consider a vial because I don‚Äôt really have a go-to nighttime sexy scent ever since I finished (and they discontinued :( ) my favorite Rituals perfume.

**PRETTY LITTLE POISONS (amaretto, black cherry ratafia, plum brandy, bitter orange, coconut musk, caramelized black figs, Madagascar vanilla, brown sugar, and botanical pheromones.)** In the vial this smells oddly tropical - I guess I‚Äôm mostly getting coconut vanilla. On the skin: in the opening I think this is a bit sunscreen, but I can still get a bit of fig, something a bit fresh (the bitter orange) and barely any amaretto or boozy notes. As it dries it somehow morphs into a pi√±a colada, and then it hits me: this smells almost exactly like my Cantu hair products. If you‚Äôve ever smelled coconut-scented curly hair products you know exactly what this is. Much more sunscreen than Siren‚Äôs Spell is. I don‚Äôt mind the smell, it‚Äôs sweet coconut, but I don‚Äôt want to smell like the leave-in conditioner I use every time I shower! It would make me feel‚Ä¶ oily, somehow. What a strange fragrance to create based on this name/description. **4/10** I guess.

**ELIXIR OF APHRODITE (Persian apricots, orange blossom honey, peach and plum blossoms, mimosa, white star jasmine, ambrette, guaiac wood, and vanilla musk.)** In the vial: apricot chewing gum! On the skin: still a very syrupy, honeyed apricot, but I also get a touch of the peach and of a spicy star jasmine. It does have a light musk and powdery wooden base that helps ground it to the skin, so it‚Äôs not just the sweet notes - but it is VERY honeyed. Very sugary, pink florals- it just smells like nectar really. Somewhat artificial in the way an apricot shower gel or lip gloss might smell. The vanilla is not there at all for me. As I said, fruity-florals are one of my least favorite category of perfumes - but this one is somehow enchanting to me. It skirts the line between girlish and womanly, so if you‚Äôre looking for ‚Äúmature‚Äù scents the apricot in this can definitely read juvenile (again: roll-on apricot lip gloss). At the same time, there is a light musky edge that comes out as it dries, alongside a light citrus and a bit of a humid star jasmine, which to me manages to push the fragrance over to seductive. I think the first fruity-floral I‚Äôve considered FSing, but mind you it‚Äôs a subjective one - I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll like this if you look for a complex scent. **9/10**, just knocking a point off for not being very long lasting - it turns into a gentle powdery base reminiscent of apricot-scented setting powder, around 2 hours in.¬†

**THE DANGEROUS PEACH (Velvetine peaches, pear blossoms, peach wood, orris root, and musk mallow)** In the vial: a much tarter peach than Elixir of Aphrodite. On the skin: that‚Äôs decidedly less nectary sweet, though it still somewhat smells like peach rings, it‚Äôs missing the thick honey. It smells a tad more realistic and juicy, like a peach you just bit into. The base is heavier on the orris and has a bit of that scratchy-powdery quality. Compared to EoA, this has more of a naturalistic edge, like I can smell the leaves of the peach tree, or the fuzzy skin of the peach. A much tarter, juicer fruit, I think it‚Äôs good if you want to avoid the ‚Äúsmells like shampoo‚Äù feel of EoA. The other notes are very light, just enough to make this work as a perfume, but it is definitely aimed at making you smell like a literal peach. I think I might FS EoA because it works as a nice, seductive perfume any time of the year, but this could be a really fun summer go-to and I‚Äôm obsessed with sniffing my wrist. **9/10** for me, but it is Literally Just Peach. Lasts a bit longer than EoA and stays pretty similar as it dries, maybe the orris becomes a bit more apparent.

**FEMME SAUVAGE (Wild blackberries, voluptuous musk, randy dark patchouli, and the warmth of come-hither ambers.)** In the vial: That‚Äôs a heavyy patchouli, only a tinge of juicy blackberries. On the skin: almost literally just patchouli. Unlike something like Falling Snow Angels, where the other notes (vanilla & mint) are the main thing and the patchouli plays along as the backdrop, this is capital p Patchouli. I get a tinge of blackberries, but this isn‚Äôt a blackberry perfume like Baccante is a blueberry one. It‚Äôs not a medicinal, fresh patchouli, it‚Äôs rich and earthy without much of a metallic edge either - I think what this perfume has going for it is being a slightly more feminine/seductive take on patchouli. It‚Äôs herbal enough that it conjures up the idea of the blackberry bushes without being realistic. A bit more of the syrupy blackberries come out as it dries. **6/10**, I learned I‚Äôd rather have patchouli as the background note.

**SALOM√â (Magnolia, Queen of the Night, black grapes and plums, skin musk, spilled cognac, bitter orange, ancient Arabian love philtre of crushed vanilla and tonka bean, sandalwood, vetiver, cedar, and red oud. )** In the vial: grapes, vanilla, and cedar? A bit of salty sandalwood. Odd scent. On the skin, I‚Äôll just liveblog the journey I went through with this perfume: mm - there is something creamy, but also a bit baby wipe-y in the way Alkemia‚Äôs white musks sometimes are. I assume that‚Äôs what they used for their skin musk note + the white florals. It combined with a dusty, wood-shaving esque cedar it‚Äôs coming across as a‚Ä¶ cleaning product‚Ä¶? Laundry spray? There is a bit of lightly crushed grapes in here. Something here is giving me a headache. The floral notes are a bit sharp and screechy. I think it‚Äôs the vetiver that‚Äôs coming across as bitter here too. I don‚Äôt get any oud, which I would love to help ground this fragrance. Normally I can forgive Alkemia‚Äôs white musks for being inoffensive despite smelling of laundry spray, but there is a tension of this fragrance‚Äôs notes with each other that‚Äôs making me want to AVOID smelling my wrist as it‚Äôll make me dizzy. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ discordant. And this is one of my oldest samples, too, but it‚Äôs waxy and bitter and green. Like a couple of other scents have before, something about it smells like mosquito repellent, too. Gah. A **1/10** feels too harsh because the notes here SEEM like they should come together into something beautiful, but very few scents have made me want to scrub them off (maybe Legal Tender), so I guess that‚Äôs what it gets. Maybe I can knock it up to a 2/10 because once it‚Äôs dry it‚Äôs just baby wipes.

**THE SECRET GARDEN (Orange blossoms, Meyer's lemon, bitter orange, acai, cherimoya, garden mint, bergamot, and blackcurrant buds with fresh papaya, honey mango, and white amber grounded by earthy oakmoss, green patchouli, and soft blonde woods)** In the vial: balsamic bergamot and sugary mint. On the skin: definitely a lot of bergamot, but now there‚Äôs a lot of juicy papaya and mango. The mint is much milder and definitely garden mint, not peppermint, mellow and sweet. Otherwise it‚Äôs mostly a citrusy scent, orange blossoms (which I‚Äôm not mad at - orange trees are one of my favorite smells) with lemon rind, orange juice and a very balmy bergamot. I don‚Äôt get much of the grounding base notes, perhaps a bit of cashmeran. As it dries the very juicy tropical fruits recede and you get the sparkling citrus, orange blossoms, spearmint and a tiny bit of patchouli on a very gentle woods base. While the performance on this isn‚Äôt great (\~30 min, after an hour it‚Äôs Alkemia‚Äôs white amber, which I do enjoy), and the final product is not terribly complex (you could probably find an Eau de Toilette with this vibe), I am going to give it a **7/10** because I just love orange blossoms and spearmint.

**CARMEN 7 (spiced pear, lychees, French pralines, bourbon vanilla, almond blossoms, gardenia, star jasmine, magnolia, sensuously musky amber.)** In the vial: slight spices and something (strangely) that almost smells like cashmeran. On the skin: ah, this one comes alive on the skin. Immediately it‚Äôs a bit creamy and a bit fruity - similar family to The Honored Ghosts. I‚Äôm getting a lot of I think gardenia, sweet and full bodied. The base to this is a very typical Alkemia sweet, musky amber. As it dries you get cleaner white florals, a bit spicy green, and a very fresh magnolia, which is unfortunately not one of my favorite florals (just smells a bit mainstream perfumey to me - very bright and sparkling, reminds me of the bottle of Gucci Flora Magnolia I got as a gift). It‚Äôs totally fine, a boring slightly gourmand, slightly sweet floral. Performance is quite bad. **5/10** I guess, nothing good or bad to say about it.

**ECSTASIES OF LIGHT (white amber infused with pear blossoms, white figs, bergamot, gorse flowers, winter honeysuckle, and osmanthus.)** In the vial: a sort of hard to identify floral, a tiny bit of Alkemia‚Äôs white amber. On the skin: mm, that‚Äôs an interesting floral. Very subtle. Almost like flower-scented oils, rather than blooming flowers? I think it‚Äôs osmanthus, which I‚Äôm not familiar with - it‚Äôs lightly buttery and quite sweet. This stops just short of being a gourmand, just barely makes it into fruity-floral. I think Alkemia has several of these white ambers with florals and gourmand notes (I‚Äôll get around to them, they‚Äôre one of my fave fragrance families) but what distinguishes this one from the others is definitely the fruity touch. They‚Äôre not doing much for me, but if that‚Äôs what been missing in the white ambers you‚Äôve tried, you might like this one. It‚Äôs quite ethereal while still being sweet. **6/10** didn‚Äôt enchant me as much as some other white ambers.

**WINGS OF LIGHT (sun-ripened fig uplifted by ethereal plumes of creamy oleander, neroli orange blossom, freesia, carnations, white marigolds, and cerejeira.)** In the vial: Saltier and creamier, almost sandalwoody. On the skin: still a wood smell with fresh flowers and a creamy, almost salty vanillic smell. Leans a bit sunscreen, somehow. It‚Äôs not overtly fruity, there is a base of fig (to my nose green, not ripened) but it‚Äôs otherwise fresh, watery florals and a sunscreen cream smell. I think if you like the idea of sunscreen smells but they lean too hard on the white florals (or the tropical notes), these florals are a bit more of a ‚Äúbouquet of flowers‚Äù-fresh. I enjoy it much more than I thought I would. It‚Äôs \*almost\* too coconutty (despite not having coconut) but never learns into full-on hair product like Pretty Little Poisons, and I find the florals more original than those of Siren‚Äôs Spell - this one I would actually consider as a summertime fragrance. **8/10**

**GILDED ALCHEMY (January 2025) (Sparkling Blanc de Blancs champagne, green figs, golden quince, vanilla heliotrope, limonette de marrakech, flying wish paper, clove buds, and velvety white musks.)** In the vial: INCREDIBLY fizzy, borderline soapy and citrusy. On the skin: it‚Äôs the same, a champagne smell with a helping of a juicy heliotrope that at least gives it some body - but barely. That and the paper makes this smell like Old Books and Fresh Flowers if you spilled a whole bottle of champagne on the books and the flowers. The fizziness calms down \*slightly\* on the drydown and it becomes a heliotrope and lemon smell. Incredibly airy, but it does have a slight grounding musk base. It‚Äôs fine? Like many of their Alchemies, rather poor performance (though there‚Äôs been worse), but this one makes me feel ethereal and a bit fairy-like. I think they‚Äôre onto something with these notes, they should bring this back and tinker with it a bit. **7/10**

**THE LADY‚ÄôS YES (fresh fig, magnolia flowers, mesmerizing amber, and sophisticated white sandalwood.)** In the vial: heavy on the sandalwood, gentle woods. On the skin: it‚Äôs not overpoweringly floral (luckily), but neither is it too fruity. It‚Äôs a soft, feminine sandalwood with only a bit of dark fig to lift it up. A bit nondescript but pretty, the kind of thing you can wear without thinking twice about it when you want to feel sort of elegant. The magnolia doesn‚Äôt dominate. It‚Äôs perfectly fine, soft and cozy, but doesn‚Äôt speak to me, similar category to B√©guin. **6/10**

1nvfnii,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeLoadout/comments/1nvfnii/explore_best_overtherange_microwave_samsung/,Explore Best Over-the-Range Microwave Samsung ME16A4021AS Review,"Getting the Samsung ME16A4021AS over-the-range microwave set up in my kitchen felt like upgrading my whole cooking game. I‚Äôve been using this microwave for a couple of months now, and I‚Äôve got to admit, it‚Äôs made my busy weekday meal prep so much easier. It‚Äôs designed for convenience and efficiency, and while it‚Äôs not absolutely perfect, it ticks a lot of the boxes for what I‚Äôd expect from a kitchen staple.

**Design and Build**

In terms of design, this microwave scores high for sleekness. It fits seamlessly over my range and doesn‚Äôt stick out too far‚Äîwhat I appreciate greatly given my limited kitchen space. The stainless steel finish gives it a professional look, and it‚Äôs super easy to clean (bye-bye, smudges). The LED display is bright and clear, giving it a modern touch, and I can quickly glance at the controls to operate it. With dimensions of 32 x 18 x 18 inches, it had no trouble fitting where my old microwave used to be. Setting it up was pretty straightforward for someone moderately handy with tools.

**Performance and Functionality**

Using it felt like a nice change from my old microwave‚Äôs slow heating time; this one is powered at 1000 watts, making reheating and cooking food a breeze. Whether it‚Äôs popcorn nights for the kids or defrosting some frozen chicken, the performance has been reliable. The 10 power levels offer impressive flexibility depending on what I‚Äôm preparing. One standout is the ""Add 30 Seconds"" button‚ÄîI use this feature constantly, especially when I feel like my coffee didn‚Äôt get enough of a heat blast the first time. Auto-defrost and auto-reheat also save so much guesswork. 

[Check Samsung ME16A4021AS price on Amazon.](https://windtoons.com/p/b09km7tkyb/)

**Good Points**

- 1.6 cu. ft. of interior space fits mid-sized dishes with ease.  
- Eco Mode cuts down on standby power consumption.  
- The glass turntable ensures my food heats evenly without random cool spots.  
- I quite like the 300 CFM ventilation as it effectively clears out odors when cooking‚Äîthis is a big plus for open kitchen layouts like mine.  

**Areas to Improve**

- The beeping at the end of a cycle can be loud if you‚Äôre trying to sneakily heat up a midnight snack without waking anyone.  
- The LED light could be a bit brighter when used as the range light. It‚Äôs not a dealbreaker but feels like a small missed opportunity.  
- While it‚Äôs efficient, it doesn‚Äôt handle large plates or containers as well as I hoped. You might have to rotate your dish manually in such cases.  

**Competing Products**

When matched up against alternatives, like the Whirlpool WMH31017HZ or the GE JVM3160RFSS, the Samsung model holds its own. The Whirlpool microwave offers a similar 1.7 cu. ft. capacity and easy controls but lacks the auto-cook features that Samsung has mastered. On the other hand, the GE model has a more adjustable 2-speed fan but doesn‚Äôt quite have an eco-friendly mode. The Samsung ME16A4021AS seems to sit somewhere in the middle, balancing affordability and features.

**Affordable Quality**

While prices for items like this can vary daily, I believe this unit delivers great value for its features. You‚Äôre not just paying for a name; you‚Äôre getting thoughtful add-ons like the extra power levels and auto-cook functions that save time every day. Sure, there are pricier models with extra capacity or touchscreens, but they may not justify the cost for everyone.

1nvfn4u,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1nvfn4u/aitah_for_not_wanting_to_go_to_my_partners_moms/,AITAH for not wanting to go to my partner‚Äôs moms house for Christmas?,"I (33F) told my partner (30M) that I didn‚Äôt want to go to his mom‚Äôs house for Christmas this year. We have gone the to her house the last several years for both Thanksgiving and Christmas because she is the closest living relative so it has just made sense. My family lives in the Midwest and the other half of his family lives in Southern California/Colorado. 
Now as for why I don‚Äôt want to go‚Ä¶ 
His mom is‚Ä¶ challenging. She is VERY emotional and also very critical and I am very sensitive. For the most part I understand that‚Äôs just who she is but sometimes it can feel personal.
As far as being emotional, she cries multiple times per visit and I am an emotional gal myself but it can be excessive. My partner and his brother often joke about it and the last time she came to visit landlord/friend came down for five minutes to grab food and meet her and she later asked me if she was okay because she looked like she was on the verge of tears. I responded with ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just how she is.‚Äù Because, well, it‚Äôs true.
She can just be A LOT to be around and is just all around negative. The first time I met her we were at her apartment and a couple comes on the TV to which she responded ‚ÄúOh, great! Another happy couple!‚Äù‚Ä¶ üò≥
She then for a few years complained constantly about the size of her apartment  and wanted to move into a house so she could entertain. Well she found a huge house to rent on 5 acres down the street from her dad‚Äôs and now constantly complains about how outdated it is. She won‚Äôt even use the bathroom in her bedroom because it‚Äôs ‚Äúhideous‚Äù.
I excitedly told her that I made bagels from scratch to which she responded, ‚Äúwell why would you do that when you can just go to the store and get them. Some things aren‚Äôt worth the hassle. ‚Äú She often stands over me anytime I‚Äôm in her kitchen and stares me down and corrects what I‚Äôm doing. (Tells me not enough butter, or to use a different knife)
She also just generally hates anytime I'm in the kitchen. I‚Äôm 33. I want to help cook.
If she does cook, I grew up in a family where it‚Äôs polite to wait for everyone to be seated at the table to eat. Cook included. If I wait she scolds me by snapping ‚Äúgood grief, just eat!‚Äù

And lately things have just felt a little more personal, 
The last time I was there, My partner went to grab lattes at the coffee stand across the street to which she responded ‚ÄúAre you going to go flirt with the cute baristas?‚Äù.
My partner wrote it off as a joke but it still felt inappropriate. 
I also cut my hair super short (over 10‚Äù off) to which she responded to several hours after seeing me. ‚ÄúYour hair is actually kind of cute‚Äù.
And then a few weeks ago she came over to our place and we were all playing uno which she has never played before. She made it a point to ensure I lost which I know is the point but she didn‚Äôt do it to my partner. There was one point she asked whose turn it was (she kept getting confused with the reverse cards) and when she learn it was her sons, she kept drawing cards but then it got reversed so it went her then me and she immediately put down a draw two card. And then later she put down a draw four card and it ended up being her son‚Äôs turn so her had to draw to which she responded ‚Äúoh, I thought it was her turn.‚Äù No smile, no laugh, no look to either of us, nothing. I mean it‚Äôs subtle but it‚Äôs weird.

I just can‚Äôt ever feel like I can fully relax around her. She does have her sweet moments but the energy is always low. I‚Äôm having to console her constantly and then she can be critical and then also take little jabs at me on top of it all. My partner knows and sees all of this and understands my discomfort. I just feel guilty.
He says it‚Äôs okay if we don‚Äôt go there for the holiday but his grandpa is also up there and is old and very pleasant to talk to. We just always spend the vast majority 
of the time with his mom. 
I‚Äôm just worried this is something that he might resent me for later or that I should just suck it up.
My partner‚Äôs dad and his mom divorced after roughly 25 years together like a year before we got together. She was a stay at home mom all those years and then she had to move out of her home and away from all of her community. Should I just keep trying to be empathetic with all this?

Is it a stay at home mom thing to be competitive or critical of the girlfriend because your kids are your whole world? Is this just how it is? Every boyfriend I‚Äôve ever had, their moms have always loved me but they all had jobs?

She did tackle my partner to the ground in front of me a year ago and started kissing him on the face and started calling him her ‚Äúbaby boy‚Äù. He was 29.

Does she like me maybe but is just mourning over ‚Äúlosing‚Äù another aspect of her life?

I‚Äôm not wanting to avoid every holiday with her. I just don‚Äôt want to spend every holiday on guard. I just feel guilty staying home with just my partner when I know she looks forward to seeing my partner at least when we are only 3 hours away.
I don‚Äôt know. AITAH.

For financial and family reasons, I still share a home with my ex-wife (separate parts of the house). Just to be clean there is no romance, intimacy or chance we would get back together. We co-parent our kids under the same roof, and that‚Äôs where it begins and ends.

Semi-fit gym guy, clean shaven(head and face), enjoy going to the gym, bike riding, concerts, and social get together

What I‚Äôm Looking For:
I‚Äôd like to meet a person locally that I can genuinely connect with. Ideally, someone open-minded who understands that life isn‚Äôt always picture-perfect. I‚Äôm not looking to juggle multiple people, just hoping to build something real with the right person. A friends-with-benefits situation could work if that‚Äôs where things start, but if it naturally grows into something deeper, I‚Äôd be more than open to that.

About You:
You‚Äôre mature, understanding, and value honesty. Someone who wants a steady, no-games connection, whether it‚Äôs sharing laughs over coffee, spending time together, or exploring something more.

Everyone's pretty great, apart from this one person (23NB). For the sake of this story, I'll call them Wren. I was the last to move in, but everyone else shared the horror stories of what happened over the summer. They all shared a drying rack but Wren used it as a personal storage unit for their DIRTY washing up. They also used my Coeliac housemate's toaster, then blamed the Coeliac person for leaving it out (It was labelled as a GF toaster). When I came to the house almost three weeks ago, there was a cafetiere out with some coffee in. IT IS STILL THERE.

Anyway, me and some other housemates were cleaning the living room to make it a nicer space for us to share the other week. Wren had left three guitars in there with a promise to take them up to their room when they found the space. They said this back in August so I sent a text asking if they could take them upstairs as there was no room in the living area anymore. They just said no. After they expressed that they prefer to be communicated with bluntly, they then insulted the Coeliac housemate for speaking to them bluntly and left the chat. We haven't seen them since. (They still live here, at least I think they do, as they just broke the shower door).

They now communicate solely through one of our housemates, and even that communication is poor. All we want is for our living area to be guitar-free and for them to wash up. (And a new toaster)

Since ""The Incident"", we have been told that they have PDA (look it up) due to their autism. I would be more understanding of this if we had been told about it when we moved into the house, as it now feels like more of an excuse rather than justification. It also doesn't hold up as there are other people in the household with ADHD, autism, and comorbid AuDHD who also struggle with PDA, yet manage to clean up after themselves and communicate effectively.

So are we in the wrong for wanting this?

P.S: They would have room for these guitars if we weren't getting amazon parcels for them EVERY SINGLE DAY with new books in (most of which they have admitted to not reading and just pile up in their curated ""Communist Corner"" in the kitchen (a corner we did not consent to))",3,1759341418.0,AmItheAsshole,5,1.0,False

1nvfad7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/1nvfad7/a_shell_of_a_time/,A Shell of a Time,"# Camp Half-Blood: Mid-September, 2040

For once in his life, Tyrese desires a cup of coffee. He has an inkling he‚Äôll need it. The boy sits outside the Hermes cabin, drinking a cup of dark roast hot coffee. Ty has a job to complete today. He made sure to wake up bright and early to prepare for it. His preparations just involved caffeine. 

Tyrese heads over to the beach to find the Naiads. They shouldn‚Äôt be difficult to find, right? Two sea spirits have been having a disagreement near the beach for days on end now. From what he‚Äôs heard, the pair have been spotted closer to the Docks. In the distance, two voices fill the otherwise quiet beach with noise. The boy changes directions, heading towards the supposed people arguing. As he gets closer, the voices start to become more audible. Two figures by the shoreline are visibly yelling at one another. Ty would bet drachma they‚Äôre who he‚Äôs searching for.

‚ÄúLet go of me!‚Äù

‚ÄúGive me back my shell!‚Äù

A light walk turns into a jog as it appears two ladies are getting into an altercation. From afar, the two can easily pass for campers or mortals. This becomes less convincing once Tyrese is able to get a good look at their attire. The individual‚Äôs outfits are more ethereal than what most teenagers would wear. That‚Äôs not what‚Äôs important, though. What‚Äôs important is trying to stop the two naiads from fighting. Currently, they‚Äôre engaged in a tug-of-war battle. One of the sea spirits had a bright blue seashell in her hands. The shell shimmers in the sunlight each time it moves around. 

‚ÄúExcuse me!‚Äù Tyrese shouts, trying to get their attention. After a moment passes, the boy calls out to the sea spirits repeatedly to no avail. 

The Niads were either ignoring him or were focused on their disagreement to acknowledge his presence. A moment passes before a weak gust of wind blows past the naiads. Their hair flows in the wind as a result.

‚ÄúWhat the?‚Äù

Only now do they notice the demigod that‚Äôs been calling out to them for a few moments. Bewildered expressions quickly shift into displeased expressions with a furrowing of eyebrows. Tyrese lowered his hands, causing the small gust of wind to cease. Now their eyes were on him. It‚Äôd be best to explain himself before he agitates the two any more. He‚Äôs here to help them after all, not to annoy them.

‚ÄúHello, I‚Äôm Tyrese. I‚Äôm sorry about the wind. I‚Äôve been trying to get your attention for a while now. I‚Äôve been sent here to help a few naiads with the ownership of a seashell.‚Äù 

His brown eyes shift from one Naiad to the other. Scowls are evident on their face as they process the boy‚Äôs introduction. Perhaps they were pondering the truth of his words. Or maybe they were thinking about how to retaliate against him. Tension remains in the air for what feels like minutes to Ty. Before, both naiads‚Äô faces soften before the one holding the seashell speaks up.

‚ÄúHow are you supposed to help?‚Äù

Ty exhales a sigh of relief before answering the question. Angering the two of them makes this job difficult.

‚ÄúWell, first, I want to ask the two of you some questions. What are your names?‚Äù

‚ÄúLuciola.‚Äù The naiad holding the seashell replies.

‚ÄúReis.‚Äù The other naiad answers.

‚ÄúOkay. Luciola and Reis. I'd like to ask the two of you how you found the shell. Oh, and please, try not to interrupt the other.‚Äù

Glances of animosity are exchanged between the sea spirits before they share their stories.

‚ÄúI was the first one to see the shell. It was floating near the shore in the morning. I wanted to go pick it up, but there were too many campers in the area at the time.‚Äù Reis explains. It seems the naiad is a bit of a reserved individual. Her eyes dart to Luciola, being rather eager to hear the other sea spirit‚Äôs explanation for possessing the shell.

‚ÄúWhen I picked up the shell, there wasn‚Äôt anyone present. The beach was empty, and no demigods or *naiads* were around to claim the seashell. So, I decided to grab it because it looked so beautiful. It was probably around noon when I found it.‚Äù Luciola recalls.

Ty takes a moment to think over their stories. Both ladies were justified in feeling like they had the right to the shell. The issue is that their disagreement is at the expense of the campers. Verbal disputes and an outright disruption to anyone wishing to visit the beach. 

‚ÄúDo you mind if I get a closer look at the seashell?‚Äù He asks Luciola.

Though hesitant, she nods her head in acceptance. She places the shell into his hands. The boy takes a moment to admire the shell, now that he has a better view of it. It's small, yet captivating. No wonder it caught their eyes. He‚Äôd even consider picking the shell up if he discovered it. It‚Äôs regrettable that only one of them could have it. There‚Äôs only one‚Ä¶

At this moment, Tyrese‚Äôs eyes gleam with fascination. The gears in his head were shifting.

‚ÄúI have an idea. I‚Äôll be right back.‚Äù He says before handing the seashell back. 

In his next movement, he heads towards the ocean. Reis spotted the shell by the shore. Which means there‚Äôs a chance it washed up on shore from the sea. If he‚Äôs lucky, there might be another seashell nearby. Well, if there are any shells nearby, they‚Äôd be further down. So, he swims farther down once he's in the ocean, keeping his eyes peeled for any seashells along the way.

While not as quickly as he intended, Ty returns to the beach eventually. The naiads are still standing on the beach, anticipating the demigod‚Äôs return. They were also wondering *if* he was going to return. Tyrese being able to breathe underwater is unknown to them. The young man appears to be fine, though. He‚Äôs smiling at the two of them as he makes his way back to the shore.

‚ÄúWhy did you run off?‚Äù Luciola asks.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. I should've explained myself first. I went out into the water to find this.‚Äù 

He holds out his hand to reveal a new seashell. It was a similar size to the one Luciola is holding, but the color is different. The new seashell is blue, but has a purple hue to it. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the same color, but it looked similar to the other shell.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhoa.‚Äù Reis said in awe. In the next motion, she takes the shell from the palm of Tyrese‚Äôs hands. 

The naiad holds it up towards the sun as she gets lost in its beauty. Though a different color, the shell shines just as brightly in the sun. 

‚ÄúI like it. I want this one over the other one.""

‚ÄúWhatever. It works for me.‚Äù Luciola said before clutching her blue shell tightly.

‚ÄúDoes this mean you guys won‚Äôt be fighting anymore?‚Äù Ty asks.

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

The two then proceed to go their separate ways with seashells in hand. He had to take a swim, but it seems he got the situation under control. Hopefully, campers will be keen on going to the beach again.

***

# Later That Day

Tyrese leaves the beach and heads back to the Hermes cabin. He wants to relax for a bit before he starts some training. He walks past a few of his peers, hanging around outside their cabins. He exchanges looks with a view of them, offering either a smile or a wave in return. As he eyes the Hermes cabin, he lets out a sigh of relief. Things seem to have ended decently with the naiads. If they get into another argument, it shouldn't be due to a seashell.

A few gasps from nearby campers snap him out of his thoughts. He stops on his tracks before turning to face the gasping demigods. A few campers sitting outside their cabin were eyeing Ty with astonished expressions. Before he can inquire, one of the guys speaks up.

‚ÄúDude!‚Äù The person says while gesturing for him to look upwards.

A few seconds pass before the boy‚Äôs mind registers what might be happening. He looks up and lets out a gasp of his own. Surprised, but delighted, the boy eyes the projection floating above his head. The image of ocean waves and a thundercloud hovers above him. His mind registers the image, but he can't really comprehend it. This is the first time he's seen a demigod get claimed. Ty also hasn't studied what each symbol for each god or goddess represents. Ocean waves are obvious, so he was right about his assumption. Tyrese really is a demigod of the sea. His abilities probably made this abundantly clear, but you can never be too sure.

""No way..."" He says aloud. Those are the only words his brain can process at the moment. A grin flashes on the boy's face, even after the sea storm image dissipates from his sight.

The deer in my scope had no face, and I've just realized it wasn't the prey.","I‚Äôm a hunter. Not one of those weekend warriors with a brand-new rifle and unscuffed boots. I‚Äôm the real deal. I‚Äôve spent more of my life in the deep, quiet woods than I have in the city. I know the sounds, the smells, the rhythms of the wild. I can tell a deer from a coyote by the way it snaps a twig. I can read a story in a set of tracks. I‚Äôve always felt more at home out there, in a world that operates on a simple, honest set of rules: predator and prey.

Last week, I went on a multi-day hunt in a vast, remote section of national forest I‚Äôd never explored before. It was a primeval kind of place, where the trees were ancient and the silence was so deep it felt like a physical weight. After a day of scouting, I found what I thought was the perfect spot for my tree stand.

It was a small, natural clearing, a sun-dappled oasis in the otherwise dense forest. A well-worn game trail cut right through the middle of it. It was a textbook ambush point, a natural funnel. I could see the tracks of deer, fox, even what looked like a black bear. This was it. This was the spot.

I set up my stand in a large oak tree just outside the clearing, giving myself a perfect, concealed vantage point. I was up in the stand before dawn the next morning, a full hour before the sun was due to rise. I settled in, a thermos of hot, black coffee in my hand, and I waited.

The forest began to wake up around me. The grey, pre-dawn gloom slowly gave way to the first, tentative rays of sunlight. The air was cool and crisp, and the world was hushed, expectant. This is my favorite moment. The moment of pure, quiet potential.

As the sun cleared the horizon, casting long, golden shafts of light into the clearing, she appeared. A beautiful, healthy-looking doe. She stepped out of the trees and into the center of the clearing, her movements graceful and cautious. This was it. A perfect, clean shot.

I slowly, silently, raised my rifle. I settled the stock against my shoulder, my breathing slow and even. I looked through the scope, centering the crosshairs on her vital zone. And my blood ran cold.

The deer had no face.

I pulled my eye away from the scope, my heart hammering against my ribs. I looked at her with my naked eyes. She was still there, perfectly real. But where her eyes, her nose, her mouth, and her muzzle should have been, there was just‚Ä¶ a smooth, featureless, unbroken expanse of brown fur. It was like a sculptor had formed a perfect, lifelike deer, and then had simply forgotten, or refused, to carve the face.

I looked back through the scope, my hands trembling. The magnification made it even more grotesque. There was no detail. No hint of a feature. Just a blank, furry canvas. And she was‚Ä¶ grazing. Her faceless head was bent to the ground, and she was placidly chewing on the grass. Chewing, with a mouth she didn't have. Eating grass she couldn't possibly be swallowing.

I lowered my rifle, a wave of nausea and profound, dizzying wrongness washing over me. This was impossible. This was a dream. A hallucination. I squeezed my eyes shut, then opened them again. She was still there. Still placidly, impossibly, grazing.

I just sat there in my stand, paralyzed by a mixture of terror and morbid fascination. A few minutes later, a flock of small, grey birds descended into the clearing. They landed on the grass near the deer, hopping and chirping. But their chirps were‚Ä¶ wrong. They were a flat, toneless, repetitive sound, like a broken recording.

I raised my binoculars, my hands shaking so badly it was hard to focus. And I saw that they were wrong, too. They had no eyes. No beaks. They were just smooth, bird-shaped lumps of grey feathers, hopping and pecking at a ground they couldn't see, with beaks they didn't possess.

Then, a squirrel. It scampered into the clearing, its movements jerky and unnatural. It was a perfect, bushy-tailed squirrel shape, but its head was a featureless, furry nub. A rabbit followed, a smooth, long-eared automaton, hopping and twitching a nose that wasn't there.

Everything that entered this clearing was a flawed, unfinished copy of a real animal. A gallery of impossible, living taxidermy.

I looked around the clearing, my eyes searching for an explanation. And I noticed it. A strange, almost invisible shimmer in the air, right in the very center of the clearing, rising from the ground like a heat haze on a hot day. But the air was cool. This was something else. A distortion. A warp in the very fabric of the world.

I stayed in that tree stand for hours, a silent, terrified witness to this parade of broken creatures. I couldn't leave. I was pinned there by a need to understand.

Late in the afternoon, while scanning the treeline, I saw a flash of plastic. About thirty yards from my stand, strapped to a tree, was a trail camera. It was an older model, its casing weathered and green with moss. It was pointed directly at the clearing. Someone else had seen this. Someone else had been watching.

I waited until the light began to fade, until the faceless menagerie had dispersed back into the woods. Then I climbed down from my stand, my legs stiff and unsteady. I made my way over to the trail camera. The latch was rusted shut, but I managed to pry it open with my hunting knife. The SD card was still inside.

My hands were trembling as I slotted the card into the portable viewer I carry in my pack. The screen flickered to life. The first few weeks of photos were exactly what you‚Äôd expect. Normal, healthy animals. A handsome buck, a curious fox, a family of raccoons. The clearing was a normal, healthy part of the forest.

Then, the pictures started to change.

It started subtly. A photo of a fox, perfectly normal, except its ears were just smooth, rounded nubs of fur. A few days later, a picture of a black bear, but its paws were wrong. The long, sharp claws were missing, the pads of its feet smooth and featureless.

As I scrolled through the photos, chronologically, the ""glitch"" got worse. The changes became more severe. A coyote with no snout, just a tapering of fur. A flock of wild turkeys that were just feathered, headless bodies, still pecking at the ground.

The last photo on the card was from two days ago. It was the doe. The same one I had seen this morning. Her face was a perfect, horrifying, featureless blank. The glitch, whatever it was, was progressing. It was getting worse. It was learning, but it was a clumsy, terrible student of biology.

That night, I didn't sleep. I sat in my cold, dark tent, the images from the clearing and the trail camera playing on a loop in my head. My hunter's brain, the part of me that understood the simple, honest rules of the wild, was screaming. This was not a natural place. These were not natural things.

The next morning, I was back in my tree stand before dawn. I don‚Äôt know why. I should have packed my things and hiked out of there as fast as my legs could carry me. But I had to see it again. I had to understand.

The faceless deer returned at sunrise, just as it had the day before. The birds without beaks followed. The silent, impossible pantomime of life began again.

And then, a new actor entered the stage.

It was a bear. A massive, healthy, very real black bear. It lumbered out of the trees on the far side of the clearing, its powerful head low to the ground, sniffing the air. It was a magnificent, terrifying animal. The kind of trophy that hunters dream of. But I didn't even think of my rifle.

The bear saw the faceless doe, which was still placidly ‚Äúgrazing‚Äù in the center of the clearing. The bear‚Äôs posture changed. It went from a slow, ambling search to a focused, predatory crouch. This was it. The moment of truth. The intersection of the real and the unreal.

The bear began to stalk the deer, its movements silent and fluid. The doe, of course, did not react. It had no eyes to see, no ears to hear, no nose to scent the danger.

The bear closed the distance, gathering its powerful muscles for the final, explosive charge.

And then, everything happened at once.

From every corner of the clearing, they appeared. The fox with no ears. The squirrel with the nub head. A dozen eyeless rabbits. A flock of beaked birds that descended from the trees like a feathered, silent storm. Every broken, glitched creature I had seen, and more, all emerged from the woods at the same time.

And they all moved towards the bear.

It wasn't a stampede. It was an attack. A coordinated, silent, utterly terrifying assault. The fox with no ears lunged, its jaw snapping at the bear's legs. The eyeless rabbits swarmed, their bodies thudding against the bear's flank. The beaked birds descended, a flurry of silent, pecking motion.

The bear roared, a sound of surprise and pain and fury. It swatted at the creatures, sending them flying, but there were too many. They moved with a jerky, unnatural purpose, a hive mind of flawed creations.

And in that moment of absolute, heart-stopping horror, I finally understood.

The clearing wasn't a glitch. It was a trap.

It was a hunting ground for something else. Something from outside. The flawed animals, they were lures. Poorly constructed, but effective. An entity that didn't understand biology perfectly, but it knew what shapes should be in a forest. It knew what a predator would be drawn to. The faceless deer wasn't the prey. The bear was. This entire, impossible menagerie of broken creatures was the bait. And I was sitting in a tree stand, a silent spectator at a feeding.

I should have run then. But I was frozen, my mind reeling with the terrible, cosmic implications of what I was witnessing. I was watching something that was not of this world, hunt in a way that did not obey its rules.

The bear, roaring in a mixture of rage and terror, finally broke free from the swarm of silent, attacking puppets. It turned and fled, crashing back into the woods, the glitched animals in silent, jerky pursuit.

The clearing was empty again. The silence that fell was more profound, more terrifying, than ever before.

And that‚Äôs when I heard it. A sound that didn‚Äôt belong. The soft, deliberate snap of a twig.

Directly behind me.

I froze. Every muscle in my body went rigid. The sound had come from the base of my tree. Slowly, my heart a block of ice in my chest, I turned my head.

A man was standing there, at the bottom of my tree stand ladder. He was a hunter. He was dressed in the same camouflage gear as me, holding a rifle that was identical to my own.

And he was looking up at me.

Or he would have been, if he had eyes.

Where his face should have been, there was just a smooth, blank, featureless expanse of pale skin.

He raised his rifle, the one that was a perfect copy of mine. And I finally understood the last, most terrible piece of the puzzle.

I didn‚Äôt wait. I didn't scream. I just moved. I scrambled out of my stand, half-climbing, half-falling down the other side of the tree, my expensive rifle abandoned. I hit the ground hard, the impact jarring my teeth, and I ran.

I didn't look back. I didn't dare. I just ran, my lungs burning, my mind a blank slate of pure, animal terror. I burst out of the woods and onto the dirt road where I‚Äôd parked my car, my hands shaking so badly it took me three tries to get the key in the ignition.

The deer in my scope had no face, and I've just realized it wasn't the prey.","I‚Äôm a hunter. Not one of those weekend warriors with a brand-new rifle and unscuffed boots. I‚Äôm the real deal. I‚Äôve spent more of my life in the deep, quiet woods than I have in the city. I know the sounds, the smells, the rhythms of the wild. I can tell a deer from a coyote by the way it snaps a twig. I can read a story in a set of tracks. I‚Äôve always felt more at home out there, in a world that operates on a simple, honest set of rules: predator and prey.

Last week, I went on a multi-day hunt in a vast, remote section of national forest I‚Äôd never explored before. It was a primeval kind of place, where the trees were ancient and the silence was so deep it felt like a physical weight. After a day of scouting, I found what I thought was the perfect spot for my tree stand.

It was a small, natural clearing, a sun-dappled oasis in the otherwise dense forest. A well-worn game trail cut right through the middle of it. It was a textbook ambush point, a natural funnel. I could see the tracks of deer, fox, even what looked like a black bear. This was it. This was the spot.

I set up my stand in a large oak tree just outside the clearing, giving myself a perfect, concealed vantage point. I was up in the stand before dawn the next morning, a full hour before the sun was due to rise. I settled in, a thermos of hot, black coffee in my hand, and I waited.

The forest began to wake up around me. The grey, pre-dawn gloom slowly gave way to the first, tentative rays of sunlight. The air was cool and crisp, and the world was hushed, expectant. This is my favorite moment. The moment of pure, quiet potential.

As the sun cleared the horizon, casting long, golden shafts of light into the clearing, she appeared. A beautiful, healthy-looking doe. She stepped out of the trees and into the center of the clearing, her movements graceful and cautious. This was it. A perfect, clean shot.

I slowly, silently, raised my rifle. I settled the stock against my shoulder, my breathing slow and even. I looked through the scope, centering the crosshairs on her vital zone. And my blood ran cold.

The deer had no face.

I pulled my eye away from the scope, my heart hammering against my ribs. I looked at her with my naked eyes. She was still there, perfectly real. But where her eyes, her nose, her mouth, and her muzzle should have been, there was just‚Ä¶ a smooth, featureless, unbroken expanse of brown fur. It was like a sculptor had formed a perfect, lifelike deer, and then had simply forgotten, or refused, to carve the face.

I looked back through the scope, my hands trembling. The magnification made it even more grotesque. There was no detail. No hint of a feature. Just a blank, furry canvas. And she was‚Ä¶ grazing. Her faceless head was bent to the ground, and she was placidly chewing on the grass. Chewing, with a mouth she didn't have. Eating grass she couldn't possibly be swallowing.

I lowered my rifle, a wave of nausea and profound, dizzying wrongness washing over me. This was impossible. This was a dream. A hallucination. I squeezed my eyes shut, then opened them again. She was still there. Still placidly, impossibly, grazing.

I just sat there in my stand, paralyzed by a mixture of terror and morbid fascination. A few minutes later, a flock of small, grey birds descended into the clearing. They landed on the grass near the deer, hopping and chirping. But their chirps were‚Ä¶ wrong. They were a flat, toneless, repetitive sound, like a broken recording.

I raised my binoculars, my hands shaking so badly it was hard to focus. And I saw that they were wrong, too. They had no eyes. No beaks. They were just smooth, bird-shaped lumps of grey feathers, hopping and pecking at a ground they couldn't see, with beaks they didn't possess.

Then, a squirrel. It scampered into the clearing, its movements jerky and unnatural. It was a perfect, bushy-tailed squirrel shape, but its head was a featureless, furry nub. A rabbit followed, a smooth, long-eared automaton, hopping and twitching a nose that wasn't there.

Everything that entered this clearing was a flawed, unfinished copy of a real animal. A gallery of impossible, living taxidermy.

I looked around the clearing, my eyes searching for an explanation. And I noticed it. A strange, almost invisible shimmer in the air, right in the very center of the clearing, rising from the ground like a heat haze on a hot day. But the air was cool. This was something else. A distortion. A warp in the very fabric of the world.

I stayed in that tree stand for hours, a silent, terrified witness to this parade of broken creatures. I couldn't leave. I was pinned there by a need to understand.

Late in the afternoon, while scanning the treeline, I saw a flash of plastic. About thirty yards from my stand, strapped to a tree, was a trail camera. It was an older model, its casing weathered and green with moss. It was pointed directly at the clearing. Someone else had seen this. Someone else had been watching.

I waited until the light began to fade, until the faceless menagerie had dispersed back into the woods. Then I climbed down from my stand, my legs stiff and unsteady. I made my way over to the trail camera. The latch was rusted shut, but I managed to pry it open with my hunting knife. The SD card was still inside.

My hands were trembling as I slotted the card into the portable viewer I carry in my pack. The screen flickered to life. The first few weeks of photos were exactly what you‚Äôd expect. Normal, healthy animals. A handsome buck, a curious fox, a family of raccoons. The clearing was a normal, healthy part of the forest.

Then, the pictures started to change.

It started subtly. A photo of a fox, perfectly normal, except its ears were just smooth, rounded nubs of fur. A few days later, a picture of a black bear, but its paws were wrong. The long, sharp claws were missing, the pads of its feet smooth and featureless.

As I scrolled through the photos, chronologically, the ""glitch"" got worse. The changes became more severe. A coyote with no snout, just a tapering of fur. A flock of wild turkeys that were just feathered, headless bodies, still pecking at the ground.

The last photo on the card was from two days ago. It was the doe. The same one I had seen this morning. Her face was a perfect, horrifying, featureless blank. The glitch, whatever it was, was progressing. It was getting worse. It was learning, but it was a clumsy, terrible student of biology.

That night, I didn't sleep. I sat in my cold, dark tent, the images from the clearing and the trail camera playing on a loop in my head. My hunter's brain, the part of me that understood the simple, honest rules of the wild, was screaming. This was not a natural place. These were not natural things.

The next morning, I was back in my tree stand before dawn. I don‚Äôt know why. I should have packed my things and hiked out of there as fast as my legs could carry me. But I had to see it again. I had to understand.

The faceless deer returned at sunrise, just as it had the day before. The birds without beaks followed. The silent, impossible pantomime of life began again.

And then, a new actor entered the stage.

It was a bear. A massive, healthy, very real black bear. It lumbered out of the trees on the far side of the clearing, its powerful head low to the ground, sniffing the air. It was a magnificent, terrifying animal. The kind of trophy that hunters dream of. But I didn't even think of my rifle.

The bear saw the faceless doe, which was still placidly ‚Äúgrazing‚Äù in the center of the clearing. The bear‚Äôs posture changed. It went from a slow, ambling search to a focused, predatory crouch. This was it. The moment of truth. The intersection of the real and the unreal.

The bear began to stalk the deer, its movements silent and fluid. The doe, of course, did not react. It had no eyes to see, no ears to hear, no nose to scent the danger.

The bear closed the distance, gathering its powerful muscles for the final, explosive charge.

And then, everything happened at once.

From every corner of the clearing, they appeared. The fox with no ears. The squirrel with the nub head. A dozen eyeless rabbits. A flock of beaked birds that descended from the trees like a feathered, silent storm. Every broken, glitched creature I had seen, and more, all emerged from the woods at the same time.

And they all moved towards the bear.

It wasn't a stampede. It was an attack. A coordinated, silent, utterly terrifying assault. The fox with no ears lunged, its jaw snapping at the bear's legs. The eyeless rabbits swarmed, their bodies thudding against the bear's flank. The beaked birds descended, a flurry of silent, pecking motion.

The bear roared, a sound of surprise and pain and fury. It swatted at the creatures, sending them flying, but there were too many. They moved with a jerky, unnatural purpose, a hive mind of flawed creations.

And in that moment of absolute, heart-stopping horror, I finally understood.

The clearing wasn't a glitch. It was a trap.

It was a hunting ground for something else. Something from outside. The flawed animals, they were lures. Poorly constructed, but effective. An entity that didn't understand biology perfectly, but it knew what shapes should be in a forest. It knew what a predator would be drawn to. The faceless deer wasn't the prey. The bear was. This entire, impossible menagerie of broken creatures was the bait. And I was sitting in a tree stand, a silent spectator at a feeding.

I should have run then. But I was frozen, my mind reeling with the terrible, cosmic implications of what I was witnessing. I was watching something that was not of this world, hunt in a way that did not obey its rules.

The bear, roaring in a mixture of rage and terror, finally broke free from the swarm of silent, attacking puppets. It turned and fled, crashing back into the woods, the glitched animals in silent, jerky pursuit.

The clearing was empty again. The silence that fell was more profound, more terrifying, than ever before.

And that‚Äôs when I heard it. A sound that didn‚Äôt belong. The soft, deliberate snap of a twig.

Directly behind me.

I froze. Every muscle in my body went rigid. The sound had come from the base of my tree. Slowly, my heart a block of ice in my chest, I turned my head.

A man was standing there, at the bottom of my tree stand ladder. He was a hunter. He was dressed in the same camouflage gear as me, holding a rifle that was identical to my own.

And he was looking up at me.

Or he would have been, if he had eyes.

Where his face should have been, there was just a smooth, blank, featureless expanse of pale skin.

He raised his rifle, the one that was a perfect copy of mine. And I finally understood the last, most terrible piece of the puzzle.

I didn‚Äôt wait. I didn't scream. I just moved. I scrambled out of my stand, half-climbing, half-falling down the other side of the tree, my expensive rifle abandoned. I hit the ground hard, the impact jarring my teeth, and I ran.

I didn't look back. I didn't dare. I just ran, my lungs burning, my mind a blank slate of pure, animal terror. I burst out of the woods and onto the dirt road where I‚Äôd parked my car, my hands shaking so badly it took me three tries to get the key in the ignition.

I‚Äôm home now. But I‚Äôm not safe. I keep seeing him. Not the real one. The copy. In the corner of my eye, in the reflection of a dark window, in a crowd of people. A man in my clothes, with my build, but with a face that is a smooth, horrifying blank.

1nvf58w,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nvf58w/is_an_espresso_machine_worth_it_for_occasional_use/,Is an espresso machine worth it for occasional use?,"Hey coffee lovers! I've been wrestling with this question for a while, and after finally taking the plunge, I wanted to share my honest experience about whether getting an espresso machine is worth it, even if you're not a daily user.

I was initially hesitant about investing in an espresso machine because I only drink espresso-based drinks a few times a week. The thought of spending money on something that wouldn't get daily use kept me on the fence for months.

But here's the thing - after doing extensive research and comparing different options (you can check out some great deals here: https://athometouch.com/espresso-machine), I realized that occasional use doesn't mean it's not worth the investment.

Let me break down why:

First off, the money saved from not buying coffee shop drinks adds up quickly. Even if you only make 2-3 drinks per week, you're looking at saving around $15-20 weekly. That's roughly $1,000 a year! My machine paid for itself in about 6 months.

The quality of home-made espresso can match (or even exceed) cafe quality once you get the hang of it. There's something incredibly satisfying about pulling your own perfect shot of espresso. Plus, you can experiment with different beans and techniques without judgment.

Another major benefit is convenience. Those weekend mornings when you're craving a latte but don't want to change out of your PJs? Problem solved. You've got your own little cafe right in your kitchen.

I found some really good options while browsing through https://athometouch.com/espresso-machine - they have machines for every budget and skill level. Whether you're a beginner or looking to upgrade, there's something for everyone.

Some practical tips I've learned:

- Start with a mid-range machine that's user-friendly
- Buy fresh beans (this makes a HUGE difference)
- Clean your machine regularly (it's not as tedious as it sounds)
- Learn the basics of tamping and grinding
- Don't be afraid to experiment

Even with occasional use, my machine has remained in perfect condition. These things are built to last, and proper maintenance means it'll serve you well for years to come.

The unexpected bonus? It's become a conversation starter when friends come over. Everyone wants to try the ""house special,"" and there's something really fun about playing barista for your guests.

Bottom line: If you enjoy quality espresso drinks and make them at least a few times a week, an espresso machine is absolutely worth it. The initial investment might seem steep, but the combination of savings, convenience, and satisfaction makes it worthwhile.

Would love to hear from other occasional users about their experiences! Anyone else make the switch from cafe-only to home barista?",1,1759340875.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

there's something itching at the back of my skull that tells me that something's off. i don't belong here. everyone knows it, but no one will say anything. i feel eyes from all over the place, like i'm a human alien. i thought i knew the way back, but it took me even deeper. i have no idea what i'm doing anymore. my brain feels like mush, like there's a heavy fog inside my skull that i just can't get past.

i'm not safe here, and i can never leave.

certain details in this world are impossible for me to make out. there are signs with written words that everyone else can understand, but somehow i can't even wrap my mind around it all. streets are flipped backwards, maps are impossible to decipher. my phone doesn't even work here, i can't even get a signal. i feel so lost.

i've had to sleep in abandoned buildings and steal from grocery stores just to survive. not like i have much of an appetite anymore, or an ability to sleep for that matter. there's always this everpresent sense of danger here that i can't escape from. i close my eyes and i hear voices taunting me, reminding me of my worst fears, threatening to do horrible things to me or convincing me to do those things to myself. i don't have the drive to sleep anymore. i just keep trying to piece together what led me here, just to keep myself somewhat sane.

the last moment i remember from my previous life was coming home after a long day at work. i felt like shit that day. the manual labor job i did to barely make rent was killing me. i remember my whole body aching by the time i got home. i remember taking a shower, standing under the hot water and replaying all the events from that day in my head. as the warm water ran over the back of my head, onto the sore bones and pulled muscles around my body, all the stupid mistakes i made were flashing before my eyes when i closed them. all of which seem inconsequential now. i can't even remember what i was so upset about back then. i don't think it even matters. maybe it never did. whatever...

i remember getting out of the shower, drying off with a towel, and putting my clothes on. i remember going to the mirror and wiping all the fog from it. i went to put deodorant on, brush my teeth, do all the normal nighttime things. i took some pain meds to help with all the soreness my body had collected from the day. i felt a sickness coming on, unsure if i caught a bug or just felt the collapse of all this long work and lack of sleep catching up to me, so i took some allergy meds to try and nip it in the bud.

i vaguely remember thinking of something this girl i worked with said about me. i had heard it through another coworker of mine, and it really upset me. i can't remember what it was anymore, but i know it left a really deep impact. she was someone i had real loving feelings for, but couldn't express myself properly at the time. i think i came across way worse than i had meant to, and i felt awful about it. she got the worst impression of me ever. i felt like such a coward for how i dealt with the whole situation. i remember wishing i could see her again, just to set the record straight between us. even still, i felt like i could never face her anymore. her image kept entering my mind, and i could no longer tell if it was a reminder or a punishment.

every day that i'm stuck here, my mind feels like it unravels more and more. it feels like the fog in my skull is starting to extend out onto the world, or at least into my vision. everything looks and feels hazy and disjointed. i'll close my eyes and suddenly transport to another place, without the memory of how i even got there. sometimes i'll look down at my hands moving and see light trails emanating from them. the way time and space operate here is insane.

i started to feel more of a sinister presence in the crowds of people i aimlessly trudge my way around. everyone seems like they have this faint dark aura around them, like something just outside of their form is stealing all the light around them. sometimes i'll hear those voices reappear all around me in a subdued way, like everyone is talking behind my back, whispering jokes and insults at my expense, telling me i'm a waste of life. i'll feel those stark, evil stares all around my person more and more until everyone eventually disappears into their comfortable homes. i'll eventually find another place to sit down, try to get some sort of rest. and every night, the voices get louder, more menacing, more dangerous. i'll open my eyes and no one is there. just a thick malaise over everything.

my mind is starting to fail me. i need to get out of here. how did i get here? shake off the voices. think...

i had spit out my toothpaste and washed my hands in the sink, before looking back up at the mirror. the fog was clearing up a bit from the fan being on, but it still clung to the edges like a vignette. the only thing i could see clearly was my ugly, awful likeness reflected back at me. i remember gazing at the small details in my reflection's face, pointing out all the hideous details back to myself. the recession pattern in my hair that made me look like i was sporting a combover in a futile attempt to hide the obvious. all the wrinkles in my face deeper than they should be for my age, highlighting all the stress and exhaustion i've been under. all the yellow pigment collecting on my teeth from coffee and cigarettes. the uneven nature of my eyes and facial details, looking more and more awkward and distorted as i studied it all. my gaze fell deeper and deeper into all the details, everything around me just fading in the background. i remember...

i woke up again. but this time i didn't really feel like i was awake. my eyes still felt shut. matter of fact, my whole body wouldn't move. it was like i was in a straight jacket, struggling to get any of my limbs moving. as i looked forward with my mind's eye, where my reflection was a moment ago loomed a dark, shadowy figure hovering right above my face. all i could make out were his piercing red eyes, like lights shining from the pitch black void of his shape. all around him was darkness and flashing, like someone turned on a strobe light in the middle of the room i was in. the light reflected from all the shattered glass on the floor flashed right back in my face.

i tried to scream but my mouth and lungs failed me. i struggled to move my arms, legs, shoulders, anything just to get out of this nightmare. i couldn't tell for sure, but it felt like this figure was pinning me down to the ground as he spoke to me, sounding like he was whispering and shouting at the same time:

""you're gonna die here if you keep going""

before i had the chance to respond, or even understand what he meant, my limbs finally listened to my brain and i shook myself out of it. my body lunged forward from off the dirty mattress i was laying on, and my lungs breathed in a great big gasp of air. my eyes opened wide and saw the morning sun peer through the dilapidated windows in this empty church. i sat there to catch my breath for a second, let my heartbeat settle for a bit, wondering what the hell just happened.

""keep going""? going where? deeper into this world? i'm trying to find my way out, but i keep finding myself digging deeper into it. this isn't right, none of this is right. everything is backwards. how the hell do i...

that's it. the mirror. i remember now.

i lunged forward with what little energy i collected from that faint bit of sleep i somehow managed to catch, and rushed straight to the bathroom next to me. it was all in complete disrepair; faucets didn't work, dirt and grime everywhere, flies buzzing around the toilet clearly used from whoever squatted here last, with no water to flush it down. it was heinous, but i had to face it all to know. i closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and turned to the mirror next to me. shattered, broken, but still reflecting the room around me. everything but my own body.

what? this isn't right, why can't i see myself? what the fuck am i supposed to do now? wasn't staring into my reflection the whole reason why i found myself here in the first place? i can't find it anymore. what am i, a vampire? what the hell is going on???

i left the church, breaking through the great big wooden board that i had slipped through stealthily the night before, pieces of snapped wood flying everywhere. i had to find another mirror. i had to keep trying.

i ran. i ran so far that my legs were burning and my chest ached. i felt a stitch coming on in my left side and i pushed past it. i bumrushed every bathroom i could find, in every building i came across. nothing. no reflection to find. absolutely useless.

i kept running, scrambling to find mirrors anywhere i could. i noticed all the stares around me, all the piercing eyes and nasty comments, growing more loud and intense. i noticed that dark aura around everyone growing deeper and thicker around them.

over and over again.
i'd blink and find a mirror without my reflection.
i'd blink and find myself running.
blink and see people staring.
blink, the auras grew.
blink, there's another mirror, no reflection.

running.
so much running.

i felt so exasperated, with nothing but my sheer panic to keep me going. the sky got darker again. the fog came back, even thicker this time. everything seemed so jumbled up and led to nowhere. lights started strobing around me again. i felt like how i did in that waking nightmare, completely dizzy and trapped with no way out. no control over my body anymore. it kept running without me even telling it to.

in the midst of all this panic, i noticed those auras had seemingly combined and formed their own autonomy. big dark shadows shaped like people, with nothing but red eyes piercing from their heads. they were now the ones chasing after me. i could hear their voices and threats ring louder and louder in my ears until they all surrounded me. i wasn't running towards anything anymore; i was running from them.

their stares burned into my flesh. their words brought up all my deepseated fears. they told me to give up, to break one of those mirrors i've been so desperate to find myself in and slice my own throat with one of the shards. i couldn't escape them. i couldn't even fathom where i was heading.

i turned a corner on the street, opened a door in the building next to me, and found myself walking out of another door into another street corner. none of the geography here made any sense at all. i was completely losing my mind and all sense of direction. i felt so hopeless and worthless then. why can't i do anything right?

i never confessed to being religious, but i felt like my god had completely abandoned me. there is no god in this world. i'm just lost in this complete state of limbo, with nowhere else to go.

just then, i turned and saw an old church with a great big wooden plank in place of the door. i looked around to see if anyone was there, and i slipped in as quietly as i could. i didn't want anyone to know i was here. i closed the plank door behind me and made sure my tracks were completely covered.

when i walked in, i found an old, empty room with nothing in it but dead bugs, broken shards of stained glass, and a gross, beat-up mattress. there weren't even any pews on the floor. aren't those supposed to be nailed nailed into the floor? 

before i could think too hard about it, my legs started buckling under my body. i went over to the mattress and collapsed on top of it. it smelled awful. everything in this room smelled awful. i looked up at the what was left of the ceiling, big naked wooden planks half-chewed from termites, covered in spiderwebs and mold from rainwater seeping through the cracks. the whole thing looked like it was gonna collapse on top of me eventually. maybe that'd be for the best. at least i wouldn't have to live in a world like this anymore.

somehow i passed out. exhaustion took hold amongst those awful voices that bounce around in my head like a ring echo, until it all turned to noise and feedback loops.

i woke up in the middle of the night, feeling a presence in my room, i looked down and saw a lit cigar held in front of my face. i looked up, and there he was.

i jumped back in the mattress, startled and worried he might hold me down again. he seemed completely unfazed by this. he just stared at me with those searing red eyes, but for some reason i felt no malice in his presence. i took a breath, keeping my gaze pointed to him, trying hard to be ready for anything while doubtful of my ability to be. i took the cigar and, with seemingly no other choice of action, took a great big hit from it.

the sensation burned my throat and i coughed a good amount, but i felt a buzz in my head that helped me breathe easy for a while. i looked up at him inquisitively, critically, never quite letting my guard down fully. was this a gesture made in good faith? why did he look and feel so evil? what did he mean by what he said before? did he know something about this place that i didn't?

before i could say anything, he spoke to me again in that same voice that somehow whispered and shouted all at once.

""i told you not to keep going""

my head shot back in disbelief. ""are you kidding? where was i supposed to go? how do i get out of here?""

he took the cigar from my hand and ashed it on the floor. ""there is no way out anymore.""

my jaw dropped. i struggled to find the meaning in those words, much less trust them. he could tell.

""you should've listened to me"" he said as he passed the cigar back in my direction.

i took it in my hand but didn't do anything with it, just let it hang there like a limp noodle. i was in complete shock. i couldn't understand. i wouldn't. with the last bit of courage and strength i could muster, i stood up and yelled everything i had been thinking up to that point.

""are you kidding me? what was i supposed to do? what do i do now? how am i even supposed to trust you? you're just like everyone else here, just following me around and calling me out, telling me to just give up. how can i give up? how can i leave behind all the people i knew and loved back where i came from? what the FUCK do i do now???""

in all my frantic energy, hot tears started streaming down my face. my mouth filled with spit as i shouted all those words to this entity, this shadowperson in front of me, someone i could barely even tell was real besides his obvious interactions with me. i didn't even know what was real anymore.

the man took a great big sigh and stood up next to me, then turned and walked towards the broken windows of the room. ""come here, take a look outside.""

in all my astonishment, i saw his deep breath and raised him one of my own. i took a second to calm down and regain my sanity, then followed his lead and looked outside, through all the smashed-in stained glass portraits that barely resembled anything anymore. i could barely tell what i was seeing amongst all the blurry, distorted, impossible streets. everyone had left. it felt like we were the only two beings in the whole world. i was sure that would change by the morning, but in all the confusion and messiness of the world, i somehow felt a sense of peace. i took another drag of the cigar and passed it back to him as he continued on.

""this world reflects what you bring to it. it is not a world of hostility, but of indifference. it is simply a mirror. it reflects your confusion, your aimlessness, your self-hatred. you came with all of those things and nothing else, so you will get nothing else from here.""

i took a second to think back at what i could've brought with me. all that pain, sorrow, anxiety that i had felt in my old world had increased tenfold since i came here. all those feelings i was so used to, now i felt i could never escape from. if this being was telling the truth, that notion was right.

""i'm sorry to break it to you this way. i have no power over this place. i don't do anything but observe. i've seen you in your darkest moments, your endless running. in a way, this world is a microcosm of what you felt before. you couldn't leave that feeling behind. you still can't, and that's why you will never return. you'll spend your last waking moments running from your own fears and self-torment, and that'll be the mark you leave behind.""

with every last shred of hope fading away, i turned to him and asked desperately ""there's really no way out? are you sure?""

he turned back to me to meet my gaze. ""what's the one thing you want in the whole world, more than anything? more than getting out of this place and back to your world?""

i thought for a moment, but it didn't take me long. ""there's someone i wanna see again, but i don't think i ever will. i don't expect anything from her anyway. i just want her to know that i'm sorry, and i hope she's okay.""

the shadowman laughed to himself and shook his head a bit. ""i'm sure she knows that more than you realize. don't worry about it. just think of the good, and keep that with you in your final moments here.""

he put out what was left of the cigar on the windowsill, embers still burning out, a smoke trail leading to the broken curling above us. as he walked away, he mentioned one last thing to me out the side of his mouth.

""find your god. not the one you pray to, the one you carry""

i blinked, and he was gone. it was morning again. all the somber peace i had felt in that moment left with him.

i stood there, wondering why i had even felt that peace with him in the first place. he was one of *them*, wasn't he? was he on my side or was he against me? or, true to his word, was he just as indifferent as he said this world really is? i didn't know what to think anymore. i no longer had time to.

the voices grew louder again. the figures reappeared on the street. i could feel them all staring at me through the window, locked onto me even from the small view they had through what was left of this destroyed place. the strobing started again, filling the whole room with this blinding, staticky, uncomfortable sensation. i couldn't take it anymore.

i ran to the bathroom, past the clogged toilet and all the flies surrounding it. i looked up at the broken mirror and still couldn't see myself in it. something snapped in my brain and i started laughing maniacally, barely able to stop myself to even breathe. then i let out a great big bloodcurdling scream and punched the mirror, shattering it even more. i kept hitting it with both of my fists, blood seeping out of my fingers, glass shards sticking out. i didn't care. i kept going. i started smashing my face against it, laughing and screaming as i went on. the mirror had completely fallen apart. i found one large blade of glass that fell into the sink, and i stopped myself.

memories started flashing by my eyes. not the bad ones i had been used to before, but the good ones i had forgotten about. the first time i had ever seen that girl at work. the time i had approached her, when we started talking and flirting together. the budding of true love coming into fruition. before all the complications of life had ruined it all. before all the mistakes and hurt feelings and things left unsaid. i saw her face, plain as day, right in front of me, as if she was really there.

i opened my eyes through all the blood pouring from my forehead. i picked up the blade and looked into the glass. i finally saw myself. i looked deep into my crazed expression, all the torn flesh and broken, mangled features. i started to wish i hadn't, but i couldn't look away. i gripped the blade in my fist, tearing into the skin behind my knuckles. i stared deep into myself and realized what i had become. i lost all hope.

1nvf3rh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1nvf3rh/am_i_being_stalked_feeling_really_uneasy_after_a/,Am I being stalked? Feeling really uneasy after a strange encounter,"Hello all. I (22f) live in a relatively small/medium sized city somewhere in Europe. I always keep to myself, currently work fully remotely & I am pretty introverted. Always head down in public & doing my own thing. 

I went to a bar that I frequent at & have been a regular for a while now (I know the owner & am familiar with a few of the people who work there). I ended up staying until past midnight recently (which is rare, I usually get a drink or two & leave as I do not typically stay out until late), but got carried away enjoying myself & did not have work the next day). 

A man who looked to be in his thirties or early forties who was outside of the bar started speaking to me whilst I was standing within the outdoor seating area outside of the bar late at night (he was seemingly on his own). I did not recognise him at all. He spoke to me the very second my friend went to use the bathroom inside. He said he has seen me many times, & that he always used to see me at a coffee shop & I would often be reading on my own in the corner, & how he had noticed I no longer go there (it has been a good six months or so since I was last there). He then proceeds to tell me he sees me around a certain road (which happens to be the road I live on). Mind you, this area is a good few kilometres away from where we were. I lied & said I don‚Äôt live there, he said I must have a friend or someone there that I visit to which I continued denying it all. Then, he names the church I go to & I act confused as if I don‚Äôt know which one he is talking about & that it couldn‚Äôt have been me. He says that is strange & that I must have a twin then or a sister, implying that he & I know full well it was me. That is the church I have started going to very recently, only briefly visiting two or three times at most so far. It is also in quite a quiet area & once again I have only just switched to this church, so I have absolutely no idea how he knows. I was in so much shock & had drank a couple glasses of wine. All of the conversation with him lasted maybe a minute at most. 

I reluctantly told one of the workers at the bar who knows me about this interaction, but I acted like I was not mortified & played it down. I did not tell the owner as he is quite protective & I did not want to make a fuss, I was even hesitant to tell the worker. The worker looked after me & was adamant to drop me off back home or to get me a taxi & walk me to it, but my father was going to be picking me up. He let one of the bouncers know, too, & kept me behind the bar with them. I was so grateful for his care. The only people who know about this other than that worker is my little sister. I have not told anybody else. I have dealt with a few stalking incidents in the past, which had caused me to not leave the house as much & I am so paranoid as is.

Am I likely being stalked? 

Should I be reporting this to the police already, or would that be considered an overreaction at this stage?

And there was no bench. So I sat on an electrical box. 

On my walk home, I finished the coffee near the fire station. No problem, there's a trash can at Ole Tangen for my empty cup. Nope. No more garbage can. So I'm writing this post with one hand and carrying my garbage with the other.

I'm an able bodied man. These things aren't necessary for me, but they are nice and it's annoying when we had them and the city decided to remove them. Many people, young, old, and in between, rely on basic public infrastructure like benches to be able to enjoy this neighborhood. How many people with mobility issues are going to choose to walk around downtown if they don't have a place to rest? 

And the garbage can thing at Ole Tangen might not seem like that big of a deal, but to me, that seems like it'll increase littering in that area. Ole Tangen is awesome and I don't want to pick food out of a garden that has litter in it.

1nvezzd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crumbleo/comments/1nvezzd/why_easter_coffee_cakes_are_more_than_just/,Why Easter Coffee Cakes Are More Than Just Dessert: 5 Ideas You‚Äôd Love This Spring,"Hey everyone,

As Easter approaches, I‚Äôve been experimenting in the kitchen with some fun coffee cake ideas ‚Äî not just your usual cinnamon swirl, but festive twists meant to bring the holiday spirit to the table. I wanted to share 5 Easter coffee cake ideas I‚Äôve tried (or researched) that stand out, plus tips to make them extra special. Hope someone here finds it helpful or inspiring!

# 5 Easter Coffee Cake Ideas + Tips

1. **Drakes Easter Coffee Cake Remix** A playful idea: take a store-bought Drakes coffee cake and give it an Easter makeover with fondant bunny cutouts, colored frosting ‚Äúgrass,‚Äù and mini candy eggs.
2. **O&H Danish Bakery Style Cake** Think classic: moist cake, cinnamon, streusel topping, cream cheese drizzle. It‚Äôs rich, elegant, and perfect for brunch.
3. **Traditional Crumb-Topped Coffee Cake** Nothing beats a soft cake base with a buttery crumb streusel layer. Add orange zest, cardamom, or nutmeg for spring vibes.
4. **Easter Nest Cake** Shape dough or batter into a nest-like ring, then place mini ‚Äúegg‚Äù treats (chocolate eggs or candies) in the center. Fun for kids!
5. **3-Ingredient Quick Coffee Cake Option** On the go? Use a cake mix, eggs, and sour cream (or yogurt) ‚Äî quick, simple, and still delicious.

# Tips to Make Yours Even Better

* **Texture matters**: Melted butter in the crumb layer = better binding.
* **Play with flavors**: Try cardamom, citrus zest, or nutmeg in your batter.
* **Decoration**: Pastel sprinkles, frosting ‚Äúgrass,‚Äù or fondant cutouts add festive charm.
* **Don‚Äôt overbake**: Remove when a toothpick shows moist crumbs.
* **Pairing**: Light roast coffee or a citrusy drink complements richness.

1nveznn,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1nveznn/dairy_iodine_and_the_potential_insomnia_link/,"Dairy, iodine and the potential insomnia link","Hi everyone, I thought I would post to share with you some insights I've gained in the last 24 hours researching my insomnia problem. My insomnia in the last few weeks has gotten so bad that I am sleeping 3-4 hours per night. I go to sleep around 11-11:30 and I will wake up anywhere from 3-3:30am every morning. I take a one hour nap during the day because I work from home but it's a brutal day. I somehow stay productive in spite of this but it's difficult.

My diet is very clean. I eat lean protein (chicken, fish, egg whites), carbs are vegetables mainly but also some frozen blueberries typically once per day, healthy fats mostly olive oil, water, decaf coffee, steel cut oats, etc. In addition to the above I have plain yogurt in small amounts (one cup or less per serving) a few times per day, low fat milk with steel cut oats (twice per day) zero sugar coffee creamer with my decaf coffee (2-3 cups of coffee with a little cream) and that's basically it. I work out at the gym 5-6 days per week (cardio and weight training) always in the evening and I have done this for years. I also take melatonin, velarian, magnesium and theanine.

What has changed for me is the dairy intake. For a long time I had zero dairy. The reason being is that I have a very active thyroid. What I learned is that the culprit could very well be the iodine in dairy that is causing too much thyroid hormone to circulate in my blood which creates this moment when I wake up around 3-3:30am. Also, that's when cortisol begins to be released into the blood to eventually wake us up. Further amplifying the effect. Starting today I am cutting all dairy out of my diet. So if you have a lot of dairy the iodine my be impacting your thyroid activity. I will keep you all posted throughout this process and let you know what happens.",1,1759340528.0,insomnia,0,1.0,False

The ZWILLING 53101-500 caught my eye as I was looking for an electric kettle that was not only highly functional but also stylish enough to complement my kitchen‚Äôs modern aesthetic. I‚Äôve been using this kettle daily for several weeks now, testing it in every scenario I could think of. There were highs and lows, but overall, it‚Äôs been a noteworthy companion for quick cups of coffee, tea, and even for baby bottles.  

**Elegant Design That Turns Heads**  

Right out of the box, the design had me impressed. Its matte silver finish and seamless stainless-steel body look incredibly polished and sleek. It‚Äôs sizable but doesn‚Äôt feel clunky, striking a nice balance between functionality and appealing aesthetics. The double-walled cool-touch feature is not just for looks‚Äîit genuinely stays cool to the touch, which makes it unexpectedly safe. With toddlers constantly zooming around my kitchen, this feature has been a relief. The integrated cable winder is a small but genius touch; I‚Äôve always hated messy cords cluttering my countertop.  

**Effortless Functionality with Great Features**  

This kettle‚Äôs 50-ounce capacity is perfect for our household needs. Having 6 preset program settings has been a game-changer for me. I can customize the water temperature depending on whether I‚Äôm brewing jasmine tea, preparing an instant coffee, or warming water for baby formula. In addition, the keep-warm function holds the desired temperature for up to 30 minutes, saving me multiple trips back to the kettle when I get wrapped up in other tasks.  

[Check ZWILLING 53101-500 price on Amazon.](https://ikerz.com/p/b085xlz4pg/)  

**Boons That Make Life Easier**  

- Double-walled construction ensures the outside remains cool even when the water inside is scalding hot.  
- Highly precise temperature control with 6 preset programs simplifies preparation for various beverages.  
- Seamless stainless-steel design makes cleanup a breeze, with no nooks or crannies for residue to hide.  
- The 30-minute keep-warm feature is versatile and convenient for busy mornings.  

**Critiques You Should Know About**  

- The top lid opens to a 70¬∞ angle to prevent steam from blowing out directly at you. While useful, a wider opening would make filling and cleaning a tad easier.  
- The kettle is noticeably heavier than standard options, which could be an issue for seniors or people with limited mobility.  
- It‚Äôs not the quietest kettle out there. If you‚Äôre brewing water early in the morning, the noise may be a minor inconvenience.  

**Product Contenders in the Market**  

Comparing it to competitors like the Breville BKE820XL and the KitchenAid KEK1222SX, the Zwilling stands out with its double-walled cool-touch technology, which isn‚Äôt a feature in those models. However, Breville edges ahead with its slightly quieter operation and KitchenAid scores in terms of broader color options for those seeking personalization in design. Unlike its rivals, though, the ZWILLING kettle is immaculate in its easy cleanup, thanks to the seamless stainless-steel finish.  

**Quality for Price**  

This electric kettle falls into a slightly premium price bracket compared to others, but considering its array of features such as the temperature presets, keep-warm function, and overall safety design, I‚Äôd call it a good investment. I do think you‚Äôre paying for both performance and aesthetics here, which matters for those who want kitchen appliances that feel and look premium.

(21M and 20F)‚Ä¶.,"I (21M) had just finished my exams and was heading home from Delhi. I had a reservation in an AC coach. When the train arrived, I went to my seat and found a few waitlisted passengers sitting there, so I asked them to vacate it.

Just then, a girl around my age showed up and asked someone else to move from another seat. (For context, I usually book side upper seats.) She (20F) didn‚Äôt even have a confirmed ticket‚Äîapparently, the station master had assigned her one.

She immediately started talking to me, saying she had sat on someone else‚Äôs seat earlier because she was scared and didn‚Äôt know what to do. She said, ‚ÄúThank God you came, now I‚Äôm relieved. I‚Äôm going to Mumbai,‚Äù and so on. I asked her why, and she said internship.

We got talking: she‚Äôs in B.Com 2nd year, I‚Äôm in B.Com Hons 3rd year at DU. She‚Äôs from Uttarakhand, had applied for DU but didn‚Äôt get in during the first merit list since she‚Äôs from the general category. Out of curiosity, I asked her caste‚Äîshe said Thakur. I asked her surname, and it matched mine (which isn‚Äôt that common). On top of that, we both had a birthmark in the exact same spot.

We ended up talking for hours, even got down together to buy snacks. When we came back, two people had taken her seat, claiming it was theirs. She panicked, so I offered to share mine. She hesitated but agreed. We spent the rest of the journey chatting, playing games, and she even showed me her family members‚Äô Insta accounts.

Later, when it was time to sleep, I told her she could take the seat and I‚Äôd adjust since she‚Äôd already had a rough day. But eventually, we ended up sharing that single seat and fell asleep together.

After the trip, she gave me her ID, and I sent her a request. We chatted for a few days and finally planned to meet (after canceling twice). We went for coffee, shopping, and arcade games‚Äîall on me.

At the end, I told her, ‚ÄúMaybe we should give this a try‚Äîmaybe it‚Äôs a sign from God.‚Äù But she rejected me, saying she‚Äôs just over-friendly, doesn‚Äôt want a relationship, and already has a situationship.",6,1759340128.0,RelationshipIndia,5,1.0,False

1nves3n,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticAdults/comments/1nves3n/i_think_the_guy_i_have_been_dating_is_on_the/,I think the guy I have been dating is on the spectrum.,"I think the guy I have been dating is on the spectrum, but I am not sure. We have been dating for two years actually, but only now am I starting to connect the dots, because if he is, it is fairly subtle. I am thinking either he knows and has decided not to tell me or‚Äîmore likely‚Äîhe does not know or has not been diagnosed. He's a great guy and I love him dearly, but there are sadly some things which are putting a strain on the relationship.

I am just going to describe some of his personality traits and episodes/things I noticed. I would really appreciate it if people could give me some feedback. Is the description below suggesting a shade of autism/Asperger's?  If so, it would explain many things. This is obviously all based on my subjective experience.

Ironically, the first time we went on a date, I was convinced he was autistic, because for the first half of the date he just would not look at me. Initially, I even thought he was ignoring me or pretending not to see me as he literally did not turn to look at me when I walked over until I said hi. We grabbed lunch together and he decided to sit next to me rather than opposite me and spent the whole lunch talking to me without looking in my direction. At the time, I was convinced he was autistic, because one clear impression I always got is that avoiding eye contact is a common trait. Having said that, that stopped soon after and the lack of eye contact has never been an 'issue' since. Still, the first date was awkward. I feel like conversation was stunted and we spent most of the time with him just telling me about mangas he's into, mostly by summarising the plot to me rather than having a two-way conversation.

After that, interaction improved significantly, but here's a few things I have noticed overtime.

\- In the first few months of dating, every time we met, he always looked somewhat broody at the beginning. Overtime, that changed. Now, I have found he actually quite a smiley person. The first few dates were extremely short. He would always have an excuse to leave after a couple of hours. I wasn't sure what to think. Eventually, I told him I would like to spend more time together, if we were to deepen the relationship, and things did change. Now we often spend half a day or the best part of a day together, but at some point he started making excuses to leave early. One day I pointed this out and he said it was because I apparently made a remark that he was dozing off and so he became worried I might be unhappy about this and decided to leave early instead. I told him it was fine and that of course I did not mind him dozing off. I also told him it's fine if he needs his own space or wants to be alone at a certain point, it's normal. It was just that I was feeling like he was making weird excuses for getting away instead of being honest about the reason.

\- Overall, if I say something to him, he will take it quite literally and seems not to grasp nuanced communication or have much of a 'middle ground'. When I first told him I was hoping to spend more time together or even have a whole day out together he obliged. But when, more than a year later, I said sometimes I feel suffocated in the relationship and like I am the centre of his universe and that I'd like for him to also have other friendships or do his own stuff, he highlighted that I was contradicting myself. 

\- He has very, very few friends and spends most of his time alone. Well, he maintains he has friends but they are all online and they almost never meet, they just chat on apps (he says this is because they have all moved to different places). He avoids crowded places like bars or social situation (he says he's very introverted and awkward with new people), but I noticed he doesn't mind crowded streets, at least when we walk together.

\- His days are fairly routine-based. Every day, after work, he goes and takes a walk in the same park. He likes routine when we're together too. We would always go to the same places or do the same thing, or I would always be the one to propose new things, until I complained about that. After that, he started sending me lots of Google Maps links of options every time we're meeting for lunch/dinner or coffee. He seems to have memorised all the places and things I like and just seems to rotate among those options when we are discussing what to do.

\- He has not travelled much at all (just twice with family), not even to cities nearby. In fact, he lives in a big city but mostly hangs out in his area. He does not drive or rides a scooter (the latter is very common here in Asia), but he does ride a bike.

\- He's very tactile and cuddly, especially in the first few months of the relationship, which I like, not gonna lie, though sometimes he would even touch me in public places where it's not exactly appropriate and I would have to be the one to point it out. He also seems to be unaware of other social situations; for instance, he occasionally used to talk about people who were standing nearby on the street very loudly until I pointed out that they could hear it. Similar to that, he once did something which I thought was very odd. We were in a cramped cafe' and there was a guy nearby on the phone. The guy said 'I am sorry' and he immediately echoed him. To be honest, I thought it was kinda hilarious, wasn't sure if he was making fun of him or what, but it seemed benign, so I simply laughed it off and told him to be more careful. To be fair, that only happened that one time and never since.

\- Given the chance, he will sit next to me rather than opposite me. I just pinned it down to him wanting more intimacy, but now I am curious whether it's more than just that.

\- Back to the topic about texting his friends instead of meeting them, I have noticed he seems to prefer or be more articulate with written rather than oral communication. In fact, recently I have noticed isolated cases where we were having discussions and he had to pause and think about what to say before answering. He said he needs to think about what answer he should give me and how to formulate it. For instance, recently, I showed him something I have been writing on my laptop. I did not say anything cuz he knew it was a book I have been writing, so  I just showed him an excerpt and was just waiting for some questions, feedback, or anything really that showed an interest but he literally just remained silent. When later I brought this up, he said he simply did not understand the reason why I showed it to him and did not know what I wanted him to say.

\- He has an amazing memory and remembers extremely detailed things, even random ones, including things that I said to him over the past, including lots of details about my likes, dislikes, and habits.

\- He sometimes looks 'stiff' in social situation or 'like a kid' in the sense that he feels like he's reciting a script or going through the motions rather than going with the flow. He would overemphasise certain words when talking to shop clerks, like 'thank you'. In fact, I was once shopping for something and got stuck listening to the shop owner trying to pitch some product to me. He emphatically said 'we're good thanks!' and dragged me away. Here's the thing though, now every time I am in a shop or at a stall talking to shopkeepers, he does the exact same thing, regardless of whether I am interested or not. He'd just come, emphatically say 'we're good thanks' and drag me away.

\- He is not very sporty. I once took him to play ping pong, which allegedly he has played several times before, and he was very stiff. To borrow his own words, he is quite clumsy. The only sport he's into is swimming. He is quite good at that.

\- More seriously, though, he almost never talks about his feelings and, when he does, it is not a very articulate description, but usually limited to words such as 'angry' or 'unhappy'. I have shared a lot of personal details with him about my childhood and past but it's mostly been one-way. The other day, in the middle of an argument, he mentioned feeling unimportant to me, and I replied that it's not that but probably that he feels like that due to his own past traumas and he got extremely defensive and angry. Besides that, it just feels sometimes like our conversation are about fairly mundane things, such as my job, his job, what to do during the weekend, where to eat. He seems particularly obsessed with asking me and knowing in advance where we're going to eat every time we meet. Generally, I just feel we never talk about so-called 'meaningful' or more abstract stuff, such as feelings, abstract ideas, goals, etc. I cannot put my finger on it precisely, but I feel there is something which I am missing in the relationship. Otherwise, he is a very caring, affectionate guy and, to be fair, sometimes he is so affectionate and accommodating that the attention I get can even feel intoxicating.

That's more or less it. Sorry it feels fragmented or terse, I tried to cram as much into as possible in it without embellishments or linking words. Some of these traits might be related to autism, others might be totally irrelevant and entirely his own thing. I am just trying to piece it together. And I hope not to offend any autistic folks on here (for whatever reason). Thanks a lot!

P.S. he has a brother who, from what I can tell, presents some of the traits I discussed above (lack of social life, shyness) but to a much, much higher degree.",2,1759340077.0,AutisticAdults,2,0.67,False

This sleek and polished silver contraption wasn‚Äôt just about good looks ‚Äî it had a surprising number of features that I realized would spoil you over time. Designed for brewing tea or coffee, preparing baby formula, and even tackling other tasks that require heated water, it promised an elevated level of convenience. At first glance, it looks like any regular water heater, but a deeper dive into its capabilities quickly proved otherwise.

**Polished Design and Noticeable Build Quality**  
The stainless steel finish isn‚Äôt just for show; it actually feels as sturdy as it looks. Weighing just over 5 pounds, the compact size makes it feasible to move around, and the heat-resistant handle? Game changer. Carrying hot appliances can be nerve-wracking, but this feature made mobility feel much safer. Every element of its construction screams durability, crafted with food-grade materials, including a 304 stainless steel liner, spout, and cover. The rust-resistant properties were particularly impressive, especially considering many water heaters lose their charm over time due to rust. What I really loved during testing was how all components, especially the detachable lid, felt designed for practicality without over-complication. Cleaning it was simple‚Äîjust a wipe here, a rinse there, and the job was done.

**Precision Temperature Control Makes Life Easier**  
Being offered four distinct temperature settings ‚Äî 208.4¬∞F, 185¬∞F, 140¬∞F, and 104¬∞F ‚Äî made me realize just how versatile this product can be. Sometimes I needed scalding hot water for making green tea, while other times, I‚Äôd set it to a gentler warmth for baby bottles. Testing all the settings thoroughly made me appreciate the precision of these controls. You know how some dispensers claim to hit certain temperatures but fail? Not this one. It delivered consistently, and I could tell the results were spot-on, even with repeated usage. Combined with its 680-watt high-power performance, it boiled water faster than I expected, which really helped during busy mornings.

**Don‚Äôt Miss This Detail: [Check VEVOR EKA-3.2ED price on Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b0dgpqswpk/)**  

**Intuitive Dispensing Options**  
This feature left me pleasantly surprised. You can choose from three different dispensing modes: auto, manual, or cup switch. Each method worked like a charm during my trials, and having the flexibility made the experience feel adaptative to different needs. What might truly impress some people, though, is its Sabbath-friendly manual dispensing option. I hadn‚Äôt seen that thoughtfulness in other models before. While most water dispensers out there rely on electronic function entirely, the ability to get hot water manually on this device was genuinely refreshing.

**Dry Burn Protection and Safety Features**  
I often forget to refill appliances like this ‚Äî I‚Äôll admit it ‚Äî which makes this water heater‚Äôs dry burn protection invaluable. As soon as the water level dropped too low, the heater would shut off to prevent internal damage. That said, my favorite safety feature has to be the child lock function. I let my niece poke around the kitchen occasionally, and knowing she couldn‚Äôt accidentally burn herself gave me so much peace of mind. These little things highlight why it works for families just as comfortably as it would for office settings.

**Perks**  
- Rotating base for flexible operation  
- Generous 3.2-quart capacity, enough to serve over 10 cups  
- Durable, food-grade materials ensure safe usage  
- Effortless cleaning process minimizes hassle  

**Caveats**  
- Silent operation? Not exactly. It isn‚Äôt excessively noisy, yet the boiling sound reminded me a bit of older appliances.  
- Slightly smaller capacity when compared to some bulkier models, which may fall short for larger gatherings.  
- Its polished design, though beautiful, attracts fingerprints like a new touchscreen phone! A microfiber cloth becomes your best friend.  

**Product Alternatives**  
Competing products like the Zojirushi water dispenser or Panasonic thermal pots often come up in discussions about water heaters. Zojirushi excels in silence and energy-saving conveniences, but I found their models lacking when it came to manual dispensing options‚Äîthe exact opposite of what the VEVOR heater offers. Meanwhile, Panasonic pots are fantastic for multi-user households, especially for those needing bigger capacities. However, they‚Äôre often bulkier and aren‚Äôt nearly as portable. VEVOR might not boast as high-tech solutions as its peers, but it shines where it counts: adaptability, safety, and thoughtful design choices.

**Price Worthiness**  
Is this stainless steel beauty worth its cost? It depends on what you‚Äôre looking for. If you‚Äôre someone constantly relying on heated water for tea, coffee, or beyond, the combination of precise temperatures and dependable design will 100% justify the purchase. Compared to pricier models in its category, this proves to be a smart pick even though it doesn‚Äôt have all the extra bells and whistles. The build quality and safety alone add immense value, clearly aiming for sustainability over mere flashiness.

1nveoaw,https://v.redd.it/5f1yxk21risf1,A weird incident indeed.,"Mystic Cartoons was on the verge of shutting down all its broadcasts in 2011, in the countries where it was still somewhat active (Japan, Mexico, France, Russia, and Spain), even after the company responsible for the channel had ceased all operations, including radio and television stations, and even its video game studio in Paris, which had merged with Ubisoft. As a farewell, the still-active channel, owned by Mystic Solutions Incorporated, created a marathon of several episodes of animated series, which began three years ago (in 2008), rebroadcasting several episodes of different series such as SpongeBob SquarePants, Ed, Edd n Eddy, and even some anime series that are still very popular today, such as One Piece or Pok√©mon.

Throughout October and November 2011, they re-aired the entire 5 seasons of Fundamental Paper Education (both pre-LFKC and post-LFKC), even re-airing the WORST episodes of the series, such as ""Love Is In A Paper Plane,"" ""Basics In Karting,"" and the lowest-rated episode of all, ""Who Else But Bubble?""

For those who don't know what this show is, it's basically a cartoon series aimed at teenagers about paper dolls who go on various adventures at a Canadian high school known as the Paper School. It even won a few awards and even has its own line of video games.

It originally aired on Cartoon Network in 1999 and was featured in iconic '90s series like Johnny Bravo, Dexter's Laboratory, and Ed, Edd n Eddy. However, it was later broadcast on Mystic Cartoons in 2004 as part of their advertising campaign for a game they published called Lana's Fantastic Karting Course, or LFKC (hence the ""pre-LFKC, post-LFKC"" reference I mentioned earlier).

The network ended up shutting down in Japan, Russia, Mexico, and France before the marathon ended, leaving the channel as a lost channel on those countries' television signals. However, the marathon did actually end in Spain. But one thing that the closures of said chain in those countries had in common was the way they shut down, and let's just say it wasn't very... pleasant.

Unfortunately, there's only one recording, the one you're watching here, of the finale of Mystic Cartoons in Spain, but it should give you an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow the other broadcasts ended. Although there are statements, and even some pictures on the internet, written by people who witnessed the end of Mystic Cartoons in different countries.

# France shut down (09/12/2011 - 3:16 AM)

Testimony written by ""SuperBreaker\_1992"" on a French cartoon forum:

""It was around 2 in the morning, 2:01 to be exact. I couldn't sleep at all, so I started watching TV to see if I could get to sleep that way. While flipping through all the channels on my TV, I found the Mystic Cartoons channel, which, if I recall correctly, ceased operations in 2005 in the United States. I saw they were showing an episode of a show I didn't even know about; I only know that one of the characters was named Zip or something like that. I decided to watch the show a bit to see what it was about. At one point in the episode, one of the characters, who calls himself Edward, conjures up some kind of love potion to try to make Zip fall in love with him, but it ends in an explosion; well, classic cartoon trope. Or so I thought it was, since at the moment of the explosion, The signal started to give problems, and after a few seconds of figuring out what was going on, the signal returned to something quite horrible. Edward's character was in the classroom lab, but it was dark. The only thing you could see was Edward's face, or what was left of it, as it was completely disfigured, possibly due to the explosion. It remained that way for several minutes until the signal with the channel was completely lost, exactly at 3:16 according to my iphone clock. Since then, there have been no more Mystic Cartoons in France.""

# Russia shut down (03/12/2011 - 06:32 AM)

Testimony written by ""Sasha\_7712"" on a Russian forum:

""I worked for Mystic Solutions Incorporated in Russia as a voice actress for several characters in popular series, and let's just say that I knew that the Mystic Cartoons channel was still operating in Russia. In fact, I had it in my favorites on my television. One day I woke up quite early, around 5:45 in the morning, so I went to watch TV with a coffee in my hand, hoping to watch a soap opera or something to pass the time, when suddenly I saw that they were broadcasting this series, Fundamental Paper Education, on the Mystic Cartoons channel, so I stayed to watch the series. I remember that my specific job on the series was to dub the voice of the character Petunia into Russian. She's a bunny who acts like the conceited, the high school brat, the rich girl. It was fun to give the character a voice. It was a very good episode I had seen, but suddenly I saw that the channel's signal was lost for a few seconds when they showed the Cartoon Network Studios logo (which appeared in each episode after it ended). When the signal came back on, I was a little horrified to see, between the words of the logo, a drawing of Lana (one of the show's characters), in which she was shown dismembered, with pencils clearly stabbing her eye and head. I decided to take a picture of this immediately to see if any of you saw anything similar.""

# Japan shut down (12/10/2011 - 00:12 AM)

Testimony written by ""Hiroshi Masakura"" on a Japanese news site:

""Cartoon fans have set internet forums ablaze following an incident on a television station that shut down the same day the incident occurred. Mystic Cartoons, a cartoon television network that recently ceased operations here in Japan, rebroadcast an episode of a popular series from the 1990s and 2000s at the early hours of the 12th of December of this year, which fans described as ""very explicit,"" ""gory,"" and ""horrifying."" According to fans of this series, one of the characters was eventually devoured by the math teacher after being impaled on a giant compass, while another character was brutally tortured and dismembered. The reasons why this episode was broadcast on public television are unknown.""

# Mexico shut down (01/11/2011 - 20:36 PM)

Testimony written by ""FanDeLosDibus"" in a Mexican Fundamental Paper Education forum:

""Just in time for the Day of the Dead! Well, it turns out I was checking several channels on my TV when I discovered they were showing some episodes of Fundamental Paper Education on Mystic Cartoons. I decided to watch them, and honestly, the episodes are really good. I think Engel is my favorite. Anyway, when it was 8 p.m. here in Mexico, another episode was rebroadcast, and so I decided to burn it to DVD so I could watch it later while I ran some errands. When I got back around 8:36, I saw that the channel wasn't available, but I didn't care because I already had the episode burned to DVD. I decided to put it on my computer and see what happened, and well, it was a pretty average episode, but out of nowhere it started having sound problems. I didn't know if it was because the recorder was getting a bit old or because of some issues with the broadcast. I fast-forwarded a bit to watch what happens, and the episode ended like that, with video and audio issues. Except it didn't quite end yet, as at the end of the broadcast, I saw a frame of one of the characters dead. And what a coincidence, it's the Day of the Dead here in Mexico, so I'll offer this episode to those interested, just for 500 pesos!""

# Spain shut down (14/12/2011 - 2:34 AM)

Testimony written by ""Jorge"" on Facebook:

""I was watching TV, recording everything onto a DVD to watch later. They were showing a commercial for Forza Motorsport 3 around 2:30 in the morning (what are you saying, why promote a game at 2:30 in the morning?). After the commercial ended, I went back to the last episode of FPE, ""Bye,"" which originally aired in 2005 and is considered one of the best. Back on topic, it started showing glitches from the beginning, with several voice clips missing. Things escalated a bit when, after cutting to a still frame of Lana in profile, the music started glitching in a rather strange way while that frame corrupted into a silent black screen. After this, it returned to a frame of the ground, showing the character's legs. After this, it jumped to a frame of Lana from the front, which flickered for a few moments before changing. Her expression turned into a smile (which actually happened in the episode). The flickering returned until the frame was brutally corrupted. After this, a horrifying scream began to sound while frames of the character continued to be shown in fits and starts. After this, there was a bit of silence until what appeared to be a school alarm sounded, showing a dark image of one of the classroom doors, which corrupted again and then showed the same image, but with a silhouette sticking out of the right door. More silence and darkness appeared on the screen, until for a split second, what appeared to be Lana's head appeared on one side of the screen, hidden, and then the end credits rolled, without text for some reason. After this, a static image with the channel's logo appeared, along with a message that said ""Thanks for tuning in!"" And after some silence, I was abruptly greeted by an advertisement for LittleBigPlanet 2. Seriously, that scared the hell out of me.""

The way you put your bag down, and how we fell into each other in a passionate, hungry kiss. The way your lips felt moving with mine. The way your arms felt wrapped around my body as you pulled me close in our embrace. The way you helped me lift my dress off of my body. The way we sat next to each other on the couch and the smile on your face as you recalled a silly story that made me laugh. The way I stood next to you in the elevator, my stomach sinking as we descended, wishing you didn‚Äôt have to go but trying not to show my disappointment. The sadness I felt watching you walk out of the building and around the corner, weary that it may be the last time. 

I‚Äôll remember running my fingers gently down your back as we strolled through Pike Place Market. And the lookout you showed me. I‚Äôll remember the way you wrapped your arm around my waist to pull me closer to you, wanting to ensure that I felt safe with you. And the way you pushed me against the side of my car in another passionate kiss before we said goodbye.

I‚Äôll remember you driving 2 hours to come see me early in the morning. The way you placed your hand on my thigh as we drove to get coffee and how perfect your hand felt resting there. I‚Äôll remember the way your eyes glistened in the sunlight breaking through the window behind the table we sat at. I‚Äôll remember your eyes studying me as we ate lunch. How your sharp gaze made me feel so vulnerable.

I‚Äôll remember the first time we met. How perfectly my hand fit into yours, resting on the table, as we talked for hours. I‚Äôll remember the way your arm wrapped around my chest from behind as you placed a gentle kiss on my head before sitting back down at the table with me. I‚Äôll remember showing you my favorite park on that cold, windy day, and how we sat in your car where you kissed me for the first time. I‚Äôll remember you showing me some of the music you enjoyed and a song that had a silly but special memory attached to it for you. I‚Äôll remember the smile on both of our faces as you drove me back to my car, and how content and happy I felt to be next to you. I‚Äôll remember sending you a message that read ‚ÄúI really like you‚Äù after our first meeting, to which you responded that the feeling was very mutual.

I‚Äôll remember the years of longing to see you again, but having to come to terms with the fact that the last time I watched you walk out of that building was in fact the last time I‚Äôll ever see you.

The time skip between the first and second page raises a ton of questions. *How exactly did Momo return to the hotel? If it was the shrines helping her, then how would they even know which hotel she was staying at?* She couldn‚Äôt have gone back on her own either, since she supposedly lost her memory right after the curse was lifted.

On top of that, there‚Äôs solid evidence that neither Momo (with her original memories) nor anyone else in the group, except Seiko, had even set foot in the hotel yet. Even if we assume Seiko mentioned their location to the group and someone happened to overhear, that in itself would be incredibly suspicious. If eavesdropping really happened, even by those supposedly ‚Äú*helping*‚Äù Momo return to normal. It would almost feel like everything was part of some greater plan already in motion.

So what really happened here? Honestly, I have no idea. I just hope Tatsu decides to explore this gap instead of leaving it as a plot hole.

# Some of Momo‚Äôs Strange Behaviors:

The first odd thing about Momo is actually her *calmness*. Imagine waking up one day in a completely unfamiliar place, next to someone equally unfamiliar . A normal person‚Äôs reaction would be to panic, to immediately ask ‚ÄúWhere am I?‚Äù But Momo‚Äôs reaction was eerily calm. She simply wandered around the hotel without showing any sign of distress. A little detail is her sleeping posture this time, it was way too normal. No chaotic blanket-kicking or wild positions like in chapter 54 .She also seems to really like coffee.

Even stranger, her very first question wasn‚Äôt ‚Äú*Where am I?*‚Äù but instead, ‚Äú*Is she maybe staying in a different room?*‚Äù Despite supposedly having amnesia, the way she asked gave the impression that she ***already knew*** her grandma was there, even down to knowing she had brought luggage with her. On top of that, she called her grandmother ‚Äú*my guardian*‚Äù rather than ‚Äú*my grandma*‚Äù, like the first time she meet Okarun, which feels strangely detached.

Moreover, Momo‚Äôs attitude toward her grandmother in chapter 210 feels strangely off. Even if we accept that her memories were reset and she no longer remembers reconciling with Seiko, it still doesn‚Äôt add up. From the very beginning, even as a child, Momo always loved and cherished her grandmother, no matter the circumstances.

That‚Äôs why her response here is so unusual. Instead of worrying about Seiko‚Äôs severe injuries, her first question is why she herself is in Shima. Contrast this with earlier moments: back in chapter 182, the mere sight of a few bandages on Seiko‚Äôs face had Momo in a panic. Or when Turbo Granny made Seiko‚Äôs nose bleed, Momo immediately lost her temper. Even when they had their falling out, Momo‚Äôs concern for her grandmother was always present, just unspoken.

So, whether before or after their reconciliation, Momo‚Äôs feelings toward Seiko didn‚Äôt really change too much, what changed was how openly she expressed them. That‚Äôs why her calm, almost detached reaction in chapter 210 feels so uncharacteristic and suspicious.

Another key detail most people probably noticed: she didn‚Äôt recognize Jiji right away upon seeing him again, which is a stark contrast to the Evil Eye arc where she immediately knew who he was.

# The Backpack:

The appearance of the backpack is so strange that it deserves its own section. Before arriving in Shima, during all the packing scenes, we never once saw Seiko preparing a backpack for Momo or Momo preparing a backpack for herself. Suggesting that Seiko had secretly packed one inside her luggage makes no sense, no ordinary person would do that. And leaving it at the hotel beforehand is impossible, since they hadn‚Äôt even arrived there after getting off the plane.

What‚Äôs even more puzzling is how Momo seemed so certain the backpack was hers. The last time we saw a backpack of the same design was back in the Evil Eye arc, but that one was burned down along with Jiji‚Äôs house in chapter 42. So even if, by some ‚Äú*miracle*‚Äù, the backpack had slipped past my eyes, in Momo‚Äôs old memories it shouldn‚Äôt exist at all. But she still carried it to visit Seiko as she had always known it belonged to her.

# Conclusion:

I‚Äôm not really good at *theorycarfting*, but the points above do make me rather skeptical. They make it even harder to determine whether Momo truly lost her memories, or at what point she actually did.

I'm 25, and two months ago started my first salaried role as an administrator, earning 30k a year. I've had some poor money habits in the past, especially at uni, but over the last year working in bars, I managed to build up some savings (but not much at all). So far, I have:  

* 2.4k in Moneybox S&S (about 2000 in Fidelity Global Shares, and the rest in Global Property Shares)
* 1.5k in Moneybox LISA  
* 700 in a Simple Saver (3.5% AER), which I'm treating as my emergency fund. 

After tax, my income is 2.3k a month, which gets split into:

* 1250 on rent and bills (I live in London and pay extortionate rent, but moving to a much cheaper place in January so this will go down to 800)
* 240 on food and transport (TFL ugh)
* I then put 100 into S&S, and 200 into the emergency fund. I'm ignoring my LISA for now as I've prioritised the other two, and will start to add more as I move up the career ladder. 
* That leaves me with 500 over the month, which I use to go out, have pints, grab coffees, have a life, etc. Anything left over, I put back into savings. 

No debts except student loan, which is being paid off directly from my paycheck.   
  
I guess my main questions are: 

1. Is it worth me continuing to use Moneybox for an emergency fund/investing, or should I look into a different provider/platform for lower fees/more choice of funds? 
2. At 25, should I be prioritising extra pension contributions over S&S/LISA savings? My company offers 6% contribution of my salary to my pension. 
3. Are there any mistakes or blind spots in how I‚Äôm managing money right now, and ways to improve on them?

Thanks so much for any guidance or help you can offer. I really want to do the best I can with my money! Any tips, ways that helped you, or articles/books to read are welcome.

IT's a long story I might tell later, but after over a decade of managing my diabetes very well with medication (Metformin), exercise and diet (average a1c of 5.8 over the last 10 years), losing a lot of weight...

I crashed (that's the long story).

I just got out of the hospital after being admitted with a bg of 1020. I had what I thought was a heart attack (as did the doctors), but ended up being my body just wanting to shut down (they had a three word diagnosis I can't recall off the top of my head).

Well, they took me off all my medications (metformin & 2 I take for hypertension) and put me on long acting (20 units) and fast acting (as needed) insulin until I can consult with my doctor (I was traveling).

I HATE IT. I hate sticking myself with needle several times ever day. And monitoring it to keep it under 200 feels sometimes impossible. For example, I woke up this morning at 137 (I take the long acting in the evening) and took 1 unit fast-acting as prescribed.

I had a low carb breakfast.. scrambled eggs, bacon, 1 slice low carb, high fiber bread w/ butter and black coffee. A total of 6 net carbs (6 fiber).

BG quickly jumped to 220?!?  In the past, when well regulated, that breakfast would have barely registered.

Anyway, will my body adjust? will I become reliant on insulin? Can I wean myself back off insulin and get control again without it?

I'm beating myself up over letting it get here (though our lives have been in complete disarray with health life/death emergencies, deaths of parents, loss of job and so much more the last 4-5 months... I'm trying to give myself a little grace).

I just want to go back to where I had it if I ever can.

ETA: The doctors and nurses at the hospital were wonderful and there is one bright side I suppose. They did a full cardiac workup when I first went in since they  thought the symptoms presented as a heart attack. Turns out my heart is strong and arteries clear.

So, let me just start off by saying that I‚Äôm not a believer in the supernatural. Not even a skeptic, and I won‚Äôt be convinced that what has been happening to me is caused by some entity. Despite that, I must admit that I have no idea how I could possibly explain the events of the past few weeks.

I guess I should just start at the beginning. If I remember correctly, I may mix up some things, my memory has been kinda shit lately, the first time something weird happened in my apartment was about three weeks ago.

The morning started off normally. I got up, showered, dressed, drank my morning coffee and then drove to work. At work I didn‚Äôt really do anything (I never do, I work in the IT department of a pharmaceutical company and my job is mainly just to explain basic computer program functions to my coworkers and every now and then do actual work that is IT related, but I‚Äôm getting side-tracked.), except hang out with my work buddy, well, to be honest, he‚Äôs my only real buddy right now, Flynn. So, as I said, normal, boring workday.

But once I got home, the weird shit started. It wasn‚Äôt anything big, but after entering my kitchen and opening my liquor cabinet, I found that my wine stood on the left. To be fair, the cabinet was small and only really had enough space for one bottle per column, but the bottle was snug against the left wall of the cabinet. I could swear to god, that I always placed it slightly to the right, but at the time, I just thought: ‚ÄúWho cares, I guess I put it in there.‚Äù I proceeded to take the wine out of the cabinet, pour myself a glass and then sitting down in the living room to watch, I don‚Äôt even know what I watched, but I watched some show and ordered pizza.

The rest of the day was completely uneventful. The same goes for the next couple days. But then, three or four days later, when I was just getting ready to get comfortable for a weekend filled with energy drinks, some wine probably, Anime and League Of Legends with Flynn.

As I sat down and booted up my pc, I, again, noticed something that seemed strange. The power button of my pc was, this is gonna sound stupid, I know, but hear me out, it was on the wrong side. At least, my muscle memory told me so. Of course, I didn‚Äôt consciously keep track of the button, so it didn‚Äôt look weird to me, but when I subconsciously tried to pressed the button when sitting down, I just pressed against the metal casing.

It felt weird, but again, how the hell would a power button randomly switch places on my computer‚Äôs casing. After a while, I concluded that the button must be on that side on my work computer and that I just got it mixed up in my subconscious.

After that, I just started my PC and basically immediately went into a discord call with Flynn.

‚ÄúHey dude, are you ready to climb to emerald this weekend?‚Äù he asked me immediately. I just scoffed a bit. We have been trying to reach emerald for a month now, without any success, but hey, maybe this weekend would be different. ‚ÄúYea, whatever. Let‚Äôs just get a few warm-up games in, I haven‚Äôt played for like, three days I think.‚Äù I said, as I was opening LoL. ‚ÄúWhat about the games we played yesterday?‚Äù, ‚ÄúOh, you‚Äôre right, my bad. Okay, then let‚Äôs hop into ranked straight up.‚Äù I guess I tried to repress the memories of the five game losing streak we achieved the day before, but anyway.

We then played a few matches that actually went pretty well. I think we played for about six hours or so, before we decided to call it a day.

‚ÄúMan, I hope we have the same luck tomorrow.‚Äù Flynn was always so optimistic. I was sure that tomorrow we wouldn‚Äôt have that much luck, since live never really gives you something good, without throwing you into a pile of shit right afterwards.

‚ÄúYea, me too‚Äù I answered him anyway. ‚ÄúWell, see you tomorrow Flynn.‚Äù, ‚ÄúSee ya.‚Äù

That was that. It was nice, having someone like Flynn. We weren‚Äôt super close, but it was always fun gaming with him.

I got up and went into the bathroom, where, before I could use the toilet, I just randomly passed out, I guess. Whatever, wasn‚Äôt the first time this had happened. But what happened when I woke up was very unusual. I woke up to a loud banging sound, like the bathroom door being slammed shut, and a stinging, burning pain in my neck. I slowly got up and felt my neck, where I immediately felt blood. Not much, but very noticeable nonetheless. I tried to look at it in the mirror and it looked like scratches. Fuck, did I really scratch myself when I passed out? I was so confused by the scratches that I didn‚Äôt even thing about hearing the door slamming shut. I only remembered it after I cleaned up my wounds a bit and went to leave the bathroom.

As I tried to exit, I froze. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck? That- Wasn‚Äôt that‚Ä¶?‚Äù I muttered to myself. The wine and the power button I could write off as nothing, but now, I was 100% sure that something was wrong. My bathroom door was moved about 25 cm (9.8 inch) to the left, so that it ended right at the corner of the room.

I noticed how dizzy I felt and I don‚Äôt know if it was from fainting or from something else, but I wanted to get out. I hastily went to open the door but fumbled it and smashed my hand into the door, causing me to let out a small yell of pain. I then took a deep breath, opened the door and quickly went into the kitchen, where I wanted to drink a glass of water, or five, but then instead decided to drink a glass of wine instead. It would help to calm me down better.

So I did that, opened my kitchen window and stuck my head out of it, catching some fresh air. It was just then that I realised that it was the middle of the night.

After a few minutes, I retracted my head back inside and closed the window again. I looked across the hall to the bathroom and realised that the door was back to it‚Äôs normal place. I guessed I must‚Äôve hallucinated it when I was still drowsy from passing out. After that, I went straight to bed and fell asleep while watching some lore video about a shooter called ‚Äòready or stop‚Äô or something, I don‚Äôt remember.

When I woke up the next morning, I had mostly forgotten about the bathroom incident, since I wrote it off anyway. But as I stepped out of my bedroom, I immediately remembered again. The bathroom door was shifted to it‚Äôs wrong place again.



**Part 1 End.**





**Part 2:**



You know, I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about what has been happening lately, trying to find reasonable explanations for all of this. I mean, I haven‚Äôt even told you about the really weird stuff that has happened to me in the two weeks after the bathroom incident. But anyway, as I already said, I‚Äôm not gonna accept a paranormal explanation for this, there has to be something else that‚Äôs going on. The most obvious answer would be that I‚Äôm just going crazy, but I swear I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôve been crazy before, kind of. I was checked into a mental hospital for three times now due to mental health issues, which I don‚Äôt want to further go into. What I‚Äôm saying is, I am aware of my mental state and I. AM. SANE.

The only other possibility that comes to my mind doesn‚Äôt really satisfy me either, since it‚Äôs really bordering on the paranormal, but I would still call it a ‚Äòscientific‚Äô explanation. I think that my apartment may be, somehow, connected to another version of itself. Parallel dimensions, connected through a wormhole.

But it took me a while to reach this possible conclusion, so let me tell you what else I experienced leading up to this.

First of all, my bathroom door kept switching positions, I got used to it after a few days. The wine bottle and the power button also remained in their switched position. Only the bathroom door wasn‚Äôt static. Most of the time, it was when I got home from work, that the door was normal. But after a few minutes it always went back to it‚Äôs weird position. I never saw it happen, but it always did.

It took a while until something new happened. Well, something new that is worth mentioning. There are probably a lot of minor things that happened that I just don‚Äôt recall. Anyway, one day, I was just grabbing myself some wine, the bottle was of course, in a different position that I had left it in, but whatever. After I had my glass of wine, or better said three glasses, or even four, I don‚Äôt remember exactly how many it was, but I was still feeling fine, I swear. Well, after that, I got up and basically immediately fainted again. When I woke up, I was in my living room. Weird, but my memory before passing out was blurry anyway, so maybe I stumbled into here before fainting. But what happened next made me realise that I was most likely moved.

There were voices. Not even faint, they were clear and they were coming from all around me. I thought my head was gonna explode, they were so loud. I had to get out of there. As I ran for my apartment door, I realised that even though I was hearing the voices clearly and they were speaking in what sounded like English, I didn‚Äôt understand a word they were saying. Was I having a stroke?

I busted open my apartment door and made my way into the hallway. I slumped down against the wall and closed my eyes, taking deep breathes, as the voices started to quiet down, until I couldn‚Äôt hear them any more. It must‚Äôve been at least a few minutes before I heard another voice. But this time, I understood it. ‚ÄúMr. Pitt, are you alright? You look sick, what are you doing out here in the hall anyway at this hour?‚Äù It was my neighbour, her name was Clara White if I remembered correctly. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I was just feeling kind of dizzy and wanted to grab some fresh air and I guess I was feeling worse than I thought, since I kind of, well, since I kind of collapsed here.‚Äù I shrugged slightly. Not the worst lie I could‚Äôve come up with. Thinking about that interaction now, what was she doing out there? It really was late. Maybe she was was going for a late night jog or something.

Anyway, she made sure that I was safe to return to my apartment, I thanked her and then went to bed instantly. At this point, you‚Äôre probably wondering why I was still staying in my apartment with all of this happening. And to be honest, I don‚Äôt know. Somehow, I didn‚Äôt realise how fucked up my situation was, I guess. If I‚Äôm being completely honest, it still doesn‚Äôt feel all that strange. I guess I get used to stuff pretty quickly?

Well, it was weird enough to me, that I decided to talk to Flynn about it the next day. Well, kind of talk about it at least. I‚Äôm not completely stupid, so of course I thought that maybe, since I work for a pharmaceutical company, there were some leaks of some chemicals that were somehow leaking into the IT offices. When I woke up, first thing in the morning, I called Flynn. ‚ÄúGod dammit, why the hell are you calling me this early?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat do you mean, you have to get to work at the same time I do?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhatever, just spit it out‚Äù I swallowed a bit, thinking about how I could talk around what I was experiencing. ‚ÄúWell, I was just wondering if you‚Äôve been feeling, I guess kind of strange lately?‚Äù ‚ÄúHuh, what do you mean?‚Äù I sighed. I didn‚Äôt even know what I meant myself, without sounding like I was crazy, but I would try. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, just kind of dizzy a lot and stuff?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, not really, why? Is everything okay with you?‚Äù Fuck. So it wasn‚Äôt some chemicals in the office. At least I could rule that out. ‚ÄúYea, I‚Äôm fine. I guess I should just drink less energy drinks or something. Anyway, see you at work.‚Äù

With that, I hung up. Kind of rude, I know, but I needed to think. While I got done with my morning routine that day, I came up with the wormhole/parallel dimension stuff I already mentioned. Since then I felt somewhat at ease about the shifting of my things and the occasional voices, but I wasn‚Äôt completely satisfied. But it was the only thing that I could come up with that was at least halfway logical. Well, it‚Äôs still the only explanation I can come up with.

As I said, there wasn‚Äôt anything new in the past few days, but there was something that I was looking forward to. For the upcoming weekend, I planned to visit my brother, who lived in another town. If I‚Äôm being really honest, I almost felt ecstatic at the thought of getting out of this apartment for at least a few days. And luckily, that didn‚Äôt change when the weekend finally came. I went to my brother‚Äôs place and actually nothing weird happened there. This just solidified my theories that whatever was happening was connected to my apartment though.

On my last day at my brother‚Äôs place, he suddenly looked at me with a serious expression and asked: ‚ÄúHow have you been doing? I was worried before you showed up here, is something wrong with your phone?‚Äù I blinked at him, my eyes filled with confusion. ‚ÄúWell, I called you like fifteen times and you didn‚Äôt answer or return any of them.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat, I never got any calls‚Äù I pulled out my phone with a puzzled expression and opened my call history. He was right. Fifteen missed calls. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck?‚Äù I muttered. After a few seconds I looked up at him again and gave him a small, faked smile. ‚ÄúI guess there is something wrong with my phone, I‚Äôll check it out‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay‚Äù he answered but seemed like there was still something bugging me. ‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶ you know that if there is anything going on, if you ever feel like you need to talk to someone, I‚Äôm always here for you, you understand that?‚Äù The look he gave me broke my heart a little. I know that he meant it. He always meant it when he said that, still, I always shut him out. I‚Äôm an asshole excuse for a brother sometimes, I know. I just hugged him tightly and tried my best not to cry.

I knew he‚Äôd always have my back, but if I told him what was happening to me, he would think that I was having a mental episode again and he wouldn‚Äôt really believe me. So I swallowed my tears and the urge to tell him everything. God, I wanted to tell someone so badly. Usually, I always keep to myself, but this time, I wanted to not be alone with it, but I knew that I couldn‚Äôt share this. So I broke away from our hug, gave him another fake smile and said: ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt stay at his place for much longer. I packed my things again, said goodbye and left, back to my apartment. I didn‚Äôt want to go back, but I had to. That day, when I returned and opened my apartment door, I didn‚Äôt notice anything weird. Actually, nothing weird was happening for two hours or so. But what then happened was, well, it wasn‚Äôt like the other things. When I was on my way to the kitchen, I passed the hallway mirror and stopped. I looked into it, stared into, trying to figure out what it was that felt weird about what I was seeing. Then it hit me.

I wasn‚Äôt seeing my face in the mirror, I was seeing the back of my head. ‚ÄúWhat the actual fuck is this‚Äù I was mostly annoyed, that my apartment, or the wormhole, whatever, had found another way to mess with me. Then, my mirror image turned to face me, but it‚Äôs face was‚Ä¶ It was wrong. I don‚Äôt know how I could describe it accurately, but everything in my face was just twisted. My reflection grinned at me with this completely fucked up grin, that still fucks with me every time I‚Äôm dreaming. Then, it seemed to jump out of the mirror. I don‚Äôt know if something hit me or not, but the last thing I remember is blood gushing out of my nose and eyes, before I passed out again.



**End of Part 2.**





**Part 3:**



I awoke to a worried Looking Flynn shaking me as I laid in my hallway. ‚ÄúFuck, finally dude. You‚Äôre awake.‚Äù Flynn looked as if I‚Äôd just come back from the dead. ‚ÄúI just passed out I guess. And I also-‚Äù But I froze mid-sentence. The blood. I bled from my nose and my eyes before I passed out. I was sure that that‚Äôs what happened, right? I must‚Äôve imagined it, since there was not blood on me now.

I then realised that Flynn was still there, waiting for me to continue my sentence. ‚ÄúActually, nothing. I just passed out. How did you get in here anyway?‚Äù I looked at him a bit confused. I had completely forgotten that he was supposed to come over in the first place. We wanted to watch all of the Star Wars movies. The good ones at least.

‚ÄúWell, I still have your emergency key. Remember, you gave it to me when your cat was still alive, so that I could come over and feed him when you were away. You never asked for it back and until now, I never remembered I even had it.‚Äù He shrugged, before then helping me stand up again. I was a bit wobbly on my feet. ‚ÄúYou really scared me dude. I thought you were dead for a second. Maybe you REALLY should drink less energy drinks. They seem to really fuck with your blood circulation.‚Äù

I twitched slightly at his mention of blood, but I don‚Äôt think he noticed. God, I swear there was so much blood. Maybe something happened to another version of me in a parallel dimension? Okay, now I even sounded crazy to myself.

‚ÄúYea, probably. Anyway, it‚Äôs good that you got here I guess. It‚Äôs nice to know that even if I were in a more critical condition, someone would‚Äôve been there to help.‚Äù This was way out of character for me, to say something like this. But him mentioning my dead cat made me realise how few people I had left that really cared for me. I only really had Flynn, when taking my family out of the equation. Even then, my brother was the only one I regularly had contact with. It‚Äôs not like I had a bad relationship with my parents, but we just didn‚Äôt keep up as much.

Anyway, Flynn looked at me a bit weird, before reverting back to his normal demeanour. ‚ÄúSo, are you still up for that Star Wars marathon, or‚Ä¶?‚Äù I laughed a bit at that. I have just shown this man more emotions than I‚Äôve probably had shown him in the past few years we‚Äôve known each other and he still just thinks about watching Star Wars with me. But I kinda liked that about him. It was always really easy to feel at ease around him.

I just nodded and signaled for him to take a seat on my couch. As he turned on my TV and the first movie started to play, I went to the kitchen to get us some drinks and snacks. I actually just chose water for myself this time. For the first time in a while, actually. Anyway, I got him something else to drink, I don‚Äôt remember what, but it doesn‚Äôt matter, and with the snacks, I returned to the living room.

Once I sat back down and started to watch the movie, I started to wonder if anything weird would happen. Actually, I was really hoping that something would happen, so that I finally wouldn‚Äôt have to be alone with this anymore. But for the first trilogy, nothing happened. And by this time, I gave up on it. If after basically 6 hours nothing had happened, nothing probably will happen.

Before we continued with the prequels, we took a little break. For Flynn that meant going out for a smoke, and for me that meant going to the bathroom to splash myself with some cold water, so that I‚Äôll be able to stay awake for at least a bit longer. God, I wanted to just down one or two energy drinks, but I really didn‚Äôt want to fuck with my blood circulation any more, so I just kept to splashing my face with the cold water.

After three or four splashes, I was feeling at least a bit less sleepy. I looked into the bathroom mirror and there it was again. The fucking back of my head. As soon as I saw it, the voices also started to blast in my ears again, louder than they ever had before. I looked to the bathroom door, wanting to get out as quick as possible, but the door, well, it wasn‚Äôt just displaced like it normally was, it was rapidly dashing from one corner to the other, rushing from the left of the wall to the right. In my desperation I tried to catch it when it was in the middle, but instead of bursting through the door, I just smashed into the wall, stumbling back. I definitely hit my head against the wall, and it must‚Äôve been pretty hard, because I‚Äôve never felt so fucking dizzy in my entire life.

I felt blood rushing down my head as I turned it to look for something to help me get out of what was starting to become an active nightmare, as the voices grew louder. ‚ÄúSHUT THE FUCK UP!‚Äù I yelled at the top of my lungs. I felt like I was going deaf, insane and dying all at the same time. ‚ÄúLeave me alone, please‚Ä¶‚Äù I pleaded as I sunk to my knees. I looked around the room and it was then that I noticed two or three blood-stained towels just lying in my bathtub. But I was to busy trying to somehow withstand the voices to think about the towels, since I could now clearly hear what the voices were saying. They were telling me to end it. ‚ÄúKill yourself, kill yourself, kill yourself!‚Äù Blasting through my brain, over and over again, without any pause.

And god, I really wanted to. I wanted to end it all right there, just so that the deafening sound of the voices would stop. By now, not just the door, but basically everything in the bathroom was spinning through the room at insane speeds. They were so fast that they started to blur together, forming a face. It was the face that I had seen in the hallway mirror, before passing out. That horrifying, twisted version of my own face, just grinning at me. I couldn‚Äôt even look away, since my eyes just refused to close.

At that point, taking my own life felt like the only option I had left. Slowly, I looked away from the face, staring at the sink, which was the only thing that was still normal in the bathroom. Well, the sink, and the razor-blade laying on it‚Äôs edge.

I slowly extended my quivering fingers towards the blade. I picked it up and brought it to my wrist. My whole body was trembling now.

Just as I was about to cut into my own skin, I saw something else flash before my eyes. I saw my brother, and me. I saw myself hugging my brother, before I left him to go back here.

‚ÄúFuck you‚Äù I said with a now determined voice, as I looked up, straight into the grimace that was my own twisted face.

‚ÄúFuck YOU!‚Äù I shouted at the face, before throwing the razor-blade straight at it. And then, suddenly, everything was back to normal. No more voices, no more shifting objects. Just my normal bathroom and a razor-blade, that was now lying on the floor. My mind was still racing, trying to comprehend what just happened.

After a few seconds, I shook out of my frozen state and looked in the mirror. I looked normal, except that my head was still bleeding. No, that blood definitely rushed out of my nose and eyes, I didn‚Äôt imagine that. I then looked back to the bathtub, and the bloody towels were still inside.

‚ÄúWhat the hell is going on here‚Ä¶‚Äù Then, the bathroom door opened and there was Flynn. He stared at me, as if he were surprised to see me. He quickly composed himself though. ‚ÄúOh, d-dude, is everything okay? I‚Ä¶ I heard screaming?‚Äù I looked at him for a while, not knowing what to make of it. Something was weird about him. Did he clean the blood off of me? But why would he do that and then pretend like nothing happened? ‚ÄúI just hit my head, that‚Äôs all‚Äù I told me and then turned away from him to grab myself some bandages. Just as I turned, I could‚Äôve sworn that I saw his expression change, like he didn‚Äôt like my answer, like he was angry, or even furious. I didn‚Äôt have enough time to turn back and take a better look though, because as soon was my back was turned to him, I felt something hit my head and everything began to fade to black as I lost consciousness.



**End of Part 3.**

  
If you read the whole story and reached this point, I just want to say: ""Thank you, very much, it means a lot.""

This is the completed version of my first horror story, that I have written. It was originally supposed to be at least a part longer, but in the process of writing, I realised that I had no idea HOW I wanted to end it, so I just decided, that instead of forcing myself to write something, I'll just end it as it is.

I really hope that you enjoyed the story. Any feedback, positive or negative, is very welcome, as I'm still very new to writing stories and english isn't my first language. Just please be nice.

* * * * * 

The office was almost silent, no phones ringing, no overlapping voices spilling out of cubicles, no printers chewing through reams of paper. Just the rattle of the heater against the window and the soft rhythmic tapping of Lauren‚Äôs keyboard from the far end of the room.

Everyone else had gone home hours ago. The chairs were empty, the monitors dark. Most people had packed up last night, slipping out with that pre-holiday cheer in their steps. I told myself I had things to finish, but the truth was I didn‚Äôt want to go home just yet. Empty apartments echo worse on holidays.

When I finally closed my laptop, the snap of it sounded too loud. I reached for my phone, screen lighting up in the dim office.

‚ÄúGonna miss you, babe. But if you change your mind last minute, you know you‚Äôre always welcome.‚Äù

The corners of my mouth tugged into a smile before I realized. That was Leo. He had only been in my life a few months, but already had his way of making the air feel lighter. He was the kind of person who filled space with laughter without trying. He was steady in a way I hadn‚Äôt realized I needed, affectionate in quiet ways that stayed with me after the moment passed. He wanted me at his family‚Äôs Thanksgiving, wanted me to be woven into that world.

I leaned back in my chair and lifted my gaze to the polaroids taped above my monitor ‚Äî my little gallery of proof that my life here was real. Friends from school. A road trip to LA last summer. And then the photo that always caught me like a hook: Thanksgiving 2022, written in my slanted hand across the bottom. My arm looped tight around Julian‚Äôs shoulders, our cheeks pressed together, his mom blurred in the background, waving mid-laugh, and the table spread with more food than I‚Äôd ever seen in one place.

The image punched the air from me the way it always did.

Back home, Thanksgiving wasn‚Äôt really a thing. Every weekend was already a celebration: cousins, neighbors, aunts, uncles, everyone gathered over pots of rice and curry, laughter spilling out into the courtyard. Noise, food and family‚Äîuntil it all blended into one. I hadn‚Äôt realized what silence could feel like until I came here. November in this country was a month of empty evenings, deserted streets while families gathered indoors.

And then there was Julian, my first love. He filled those days without asking, pulling me into his family‚Äôs orbit like I‚Äôd been there all along. That first Thanksgiving in 2022 was a table groaning under plates I couldn‚Äôt name, his dad‚Äôs running commentary on football, his brother sneaking pie before dinner. For the first time since leaving home, I belonged somewhere again.

Even the next year, 2023, when I was too sick to get out of bed, I still ended up with Julian‚Äôs family. His mom wrapped me in blankets on their couch and insisted I wasn‚Äôt alone.

And last year‚Ä¶

My throat tightened. 2024 was the year everything cracked. Julian and I ended after that trip to New Hampshire, both of us worn out by the ways love can be too much and not enough at the same time. His mom still invited me for Thanksgiving, her message full of warmth. But I couldn‚Äôt do it. Couldn‚Äôt sit at that table and pretend. I stayed home. Reheated noodles. Listened to the silence settle around me.

‚ÄúYou should take that photo down.‚Äù

I startled. Lauren stood at my desk, her coffee steaming in the mug she always carried. She nodded at the polaroid, eyes kind but firm. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve told you before, staring at it only makes it harder.‚Äù

I forced a laugh that didn‚Äôt sound like one. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ a memory.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot one you hold on to. And given now there‚Äôs Leo‚Ä¶‚Äù She paused, her gaze softening. ‚ÄúListen, you don‚Äôt have to spend the night alone. My family does Thanksgiving big. Too big. You‚Äôd fit right in.‚Äù

The offer sat between us, generous and heavy. I thanked her. I meant it. But she saw the refusal forming before I even spoke it. She gave a small shrug, the kind that said I tried, and walked back to her desk.

I stared back at the photo long after she was gone, steam from her coffee still faint in the air. It wasn‚Äôt that I couldn‚Äôt let go. It was that I didn‚Äôt want to. A part of me would always love Julian, not just because he was my first, but because those Thanksgivings had been more than meals. They were a world, a family, a warmth that made me feel like I belonged in a place that wasn‚Äôt mine. You don‚Äôt erase that by pulling down a picture. You carry it, even when you‚Äôre trying to walk forward.

* * * * * 

The city outside was damp, streets glistening from drizzle, streetlights bending into streaks across the windshield as I drove. Wipers dragged across the glass with a tired rhythm. Inside, the pieced-together soundtrack of my thoughts played too loudly, looping fragments of Lauren‚Äôs words, the polaroid, the silence of last year.

That silence haunted me still. The one Thanksgiving where I let the day pass like any other, reheated noodles on the counter, television glow flickering against walls that didn‚Äôt answer back. The loneliness of it pressed closer now, as if it had been waiting for me at the edge of memory.

I could still turn the car around. I could call Lauren, admit that her offer had lodged in my chest, let myself be a stranger folded into someone else‚Äôs family chaos. Lauren‚Äôs table would be easy. Laughter, food, noise‚Äîenough to drown out the silence. But would it ever be mine?

My phone buzzed where it lay in the cupholder. The message from last week glowed again, the one I hadn‚Äôt deleted: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll always have a place for you at the table, sweetheart.‚Äù Julian‚Äôs mom.

My grip on the wheel tightened. That table lived in me still, the clatter of forks, the way her hand lingered on my shoulder when she passed a plate, the steady hum of voices rising and falling around me. That was belonging. And wasn‚Äôt that what I wanted again?

But then Leo. His words flickered against the dark windshield as if the city itself whispered them back: Always welcome. His family, waiting. Not knowing me yet, but opening a door anyway.

But that was the hardest thought of all. Because Thanksgiving wasn‚Äôt just Thanksgiving to me ‚Äî it was Julian‚Äôs holiday. His family had made it sacred, had given me warmth when I had nothing else. To sit at another table now felt almost like betrayal, as if walking into Leo‚Äôs house meant overwriting everything Julian‚Äôs family had given me.

The weight of it all sat in my chest, heavy and restless, like the air before a storm.

That was when I saw it: a neon sign blinking OPEN in the misty dark. A pie shop, lights still humming. I pulled in on instinct.

The bell above the door jingled as I stepped inside. The smell hit me first, cinnamon, butter, apples baked into something rich and comforting. Behind the counter, a woman boxed pies with practiced motions.

‚ÄúOne apple, please,‚Äù I said.

She glanced up, her face lighting in surprise. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt think we‚Äôd get another customer tonight.‚Äù

She slid the pie into a box, folding the cardboard carefully. Then she studied me a moment. ‚ÄúHeading to dinner?‚Äù

I hesitated. ‚ÄúYeah. Sort of.‚Äù

She nodded like she understood more than I said. ‚ÄúFunny thing about these holidays,‚Äù she said, quieter now. ‚ÄúYou sit down one year with certain faces, certain voices, and you swear that‚Äôs how it‚Äôll always be. Then the next year, something‚Äôs changed.‚Äù She closed the box gently, pushing it toward me. ‚ÄúBut the old ones don‚Äôt vanish. They just‚Ä¶ sit beside the new ones. Like layers.‚Äù

Her words landed on top of Lauren‚Äôs, soft but firmer somehow‚Äîas if answering the question Lauren hadn‚Äôt meant to ask me: was I stuck?

The box was warm against my palms as I stepped back into the drizzle. But it wasn‚Äôt just the pie I was carrying anymore. It was the weight of what I‚Äôd been given, and the space for what I might still make.

* * * * * 

By the time I pulled onto the quiet suburban street, the sky had deepened into night. Houses glowed with yellow light, laughter spilling faintly through windows. Each doorway I passed felt like a possibility.

I sat in the car with the pie beside me, the smell filling the small space. My heart thudded. Every option replayed itself.

I lifted the pie, holding it close as I walked the path. My hand hovered over the door, breath caught. For a moment, they were all there with me‚ÄîLauren, reminding me not to stare backward; Julian‚Äôs mother, her voice gentle in the text I hadn‚Äôt deleted; the woman at the pie shop, her words quiet but steady: They just sit beside the new ones. Like layers.

And Julian too. Always Julian. His laugh, quick and unguarded, echoing faintly in the hum of memory. The smell of his mother‚Äôs cinnamon rolls cooling on the counter, his father‚Äôs voice booming at the television, his brother‚Äôs sly grin as he slid me an extra slice of pie. Their table stitched itself into me so deeply it became part of my own story, filling the hollow spaces of a life lived far from home. That belonging had been real, undeniable, and I knew it would never come undone. A part of me would always sit at that table, no matter where I went.

The pause stretched, long enough that even I didn‚Äôt know which choice I‚Äôd made until the door opened.

Light spilled out. And there he was‚ÄîLeo. Smiling like I was exactly who he‚Äôd been waiting for.

The warmth of the house rushed at me: turkey and sage, something sweet from the oven, voices rising and falling like a tide. Leo reached for the pie before I could speak, his fingers brushing mine, then holding a moment longer than needed. His smile was steady, but his eyes flickered with something softer, as if he knew the storm I‚Äôd walked through to stand here.

My chest tightened, not with fear this time, but with the thrum of possibility. I stepped over the threshold, the pie balanced between us, his hand still anchoring mine. The noise of the house swelled, wrapping around me, and I let it pull me in.

1nvek0o,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductCheckpoint/comments/1nvek0o/should_you_trust_blue_magic_carpet_spray_for/,Should You Trust Blue Magic Carpet Spray for Tough Stains,"Aerosol-based carpet cleaners have always intrigued me, and I often find myself cycling through different ones to see which performs best. After a chaotic spill during a weekend movie night‚Äîthanks to my clumsy cousin spilling a full glass of red wine on the light-beige carpet‚Äîit was finally a chance to fully put the Blue Magic 900 to the test. Here's where this product really caught my attention.

**Ease of Use Without Complication**

The sheer simplicity of using the Blue Magic 900 Carpet Stain & Spot Lifter is like a dream for someone like me, who prefers minimal fuss. Armed with its handy aerosol spray, I followed the instructions: spray on, wait briefly, and wipe off. No vacuuming required? That felt like I was getting away with a carpet-cleaning hack! You simply spray and blot; it really doesn‚Äôt get easier than this.

[Check Blue Magic 900 price on Amazon.](https://reviews.senaar.com/p/b0002kkixc/)

**Instant Effectiveness on Varied Stains**

The weekend stained carpet was the perfect playground for testing its versatility‚Äîyou name it: red wine, grease from buttery popcorn, and my dog‚Äôs surprise ‚Äòoops‚Äô moment from earlier that morning. Surprisingly, it lifted all those stains quickly, including wine, which in my experience often tortures carpets with its brutal permanence. Even a stain that had dried for over two days, caused by coffee, came off as if it never existed. Between its ability to lift oil-based and water-based stains, I found it incredibly versatile.

**Durable and Packed for Convenience**

Though the can itself feels lightweight (about 1.71 pounds), after a good few weeks of casual and emergency cleaning, I didn‚Äôt find myself instantly needing another. The aerosol can delivers the perfect misted spray that covers just the right amount of area. As someone who deeply appreciates good product ergonomics, this definitely felt well-designed‚Äîit fits comfortably in hand without becoming awkward to use.

**Highlights**

- Effortless application without the hassle of vacuuming  
- Removes both oily and watery messes, from grease to wine stains  
- Lifts older stains nearly as effectively as fresh ones  
- Multi-purpose suitability for both home and auto cleaning scenarios  

**Negatives**  

While Blue Magic 900 performs admirably, it‚Äôs not entirely without flaws.  
- A somewhat strong smell lingers for a while post-cleaning and might bother those sensitive to odors.  
- It‚Äôs frustrating that it‚Äôs unavailable for shipping to Catalina Island; this limitation might impact some consumers.  

**Performance Compared to Competitors**

Anyone who‚Äôs used well-known alternatives like Resolve or Folex Spot Remover would note how they make promises about stubborn stains but occasionally fall short. Blue Magic 900 edges ahead in tackling oil-based stains and operates effectively without mechanical agitation or vacuuming. Resolve, although popular, sometimes demands repeated applications for older soiling, whereas this product manages such issues on the first attempt. However, in terms of odor control post-cleaning, Folex has a slight upper hand‚ÄîBlue Magic could improve here.

Another contender is Woolite Carpet and Upholstery cleaner, which feels bulkier and less targeted compared to the aerosol design of this product. What sets this cleaner apart by far is its instant-no-vacuuming feature‚Äîa lazy cleaner‚Äôs dream come true!

**Quality for Price**

Given its quick action and ability to handle a range of stains, the Blue Magic 900 feels like a cost-effective option. Especially for someone constantly battling unexpected stains, the time saved through its no-vacuuming design is invaluable. Comparatively, I‚Äôve spent more on products that did less, like high-maintenance cleaners requiring extra tools or steps.

It's really bizarre.

While living my daily life, I (27m) can make conversation with women in places such as work, supermarkets, barbers, coffee shops etc. I'm no cassanova by any means, but atleast I'm a normal person with okay social skills.

I think the reason is because there's no pressure to impress, and the women aren't expecting to be hit on at 11am on a Monday, therefore don't have their guard up like in a bar on the weekends.

However, the moment I set foot in a nightclub, I suddenly become mute around women.

It's often said that you should stop focusing on women and instead enjoy your night with friends, but realiscally speaking, I wouldn't go to nightclubs if women didn't exist, it's genuinely the main reason I go.

I'm perfectly content with spending my weekends playing video games and watching YouTube, but women obviously won't magically spawn in my home, I therefore need to go to where they hang out.

What exactly do you talk about in bars? Because I'm not extraverted, charismatic or ""life or the party"". After the basic greetings such as ""Hi, how's it going, you having a good night?"" the conversation typically ends.

Flirting and showing interest are quite advanced for someone like myself, so I'll worry about that later. For right now, I just want to know how to have a conversation in nightlife environments.

1nvehug,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeRoasting/comments/1nvehug/looking_for_advice_on_finding_functional_coffee/,Looking for advice on finding functional coffee suppliers & building my brand," 

Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm working on starting a coffee brand (Eagle‚Äôs Watch Coffee) and I‚Äôm aiming to launch with a functional blend (coffee infused with mushrooms/adaptogens like Ashwagandha, Chaga, Ginkgo, etc.).

I‚Äôve been reaching out to roasters, but I keep running into:

High MOQs ($10k‚Äì$30k+) that don‚Äôt fit my $1k startup budget.

Roasters who only offer stock mushroom blends (not custom).

Bulk coffee suppliers that require me to find my own co-packer for blending and packaging.


For those of you who‚Äôve built coffee brands (especially functional/mushroom ones):

1. How did you find a supplier or roaster willing to work with you at the start?


2. Did you begin with private label stock blends, or did you jump straight into custom?


3. Any recommendations for U.S.-based roasters or co-packers that specialize in functional coffee?


4. What mistakes should I avoid early on (packaging, suppliers, shipping, etc.)?



I‚Äôd really appreciate hearing how others broke into this space and scaled up. My goal is to launch lean (25‚Äì50 bags), test on Amazon + social media, and then scale into larger runs.

Thanks in advance for any advice or supplier leads üôè

Our planner told us that dinner typicaly goes for 3 hours because our catering does a 3-course meal. Here‚Äôs the rough timeline we‚Äôre working with:

6:00 p.m. ‚Äì Welcome drink

6:30 p.m. ‚Äì Ceremony

7:00 p.m. ‚Äì Aperitif

8:00‚Äì11:00 p.m. ‚Äì Dinner (3 courses)

11:00‚Äì12:30 a.m. ‚Äì Band (90 mins)

12:30‚Äì3:00 a.m. ‚Äì DJ / After Party

The sun sets around 9 where we are getting married so we definitely dont want to start any earlier than 6pm- We‚Äôd also really like to celebrate until 3 a.m. because the party is the best part and our friends can always hang super late! Since the sun sets so late, but I‚Äôm a little nervous that 11:00 p.m. feels too late to start the party/dancing. After a 3-hour dinner, will guests feel tired or like things are dragging?

The live band only plays for 90 minutes, so I want to make sure we‚Äôre timing them right to get the best energy out of their set.

Would it make more sense to:

* Start the band around 10:30 p.m. instead, maybe during dessert/coffee?
* Or shorten dinner a bit (2.5 hours instead of 3)?
* Or is this timeline actually fine for a late-night celebration?

I‚Äôd love to hear from anyone who‚Äôs had experience with longer wedding dinners- is 3 hours realistic and enjoyable, or does it kill the energy before dancing?

HW: 196 | SW: 183 | CW: 110 | F, 5‚Äô3‚Äù¬†

Current Maintenance Dosing

Maintenance dose:¬†

\~1-1.2mg R3ta twice weekly +¬†

\~0.8mg Tz twice weekly.¬†

**New Supplement Details**

I started 13 September. Since I still follow a time restricted my eating schedule even in maintenance, I‚Äôve had to make some adjustments, so I am able to take my mid-morning supplements that require food or fat as suggested for maximum absorption.

I‚Äôve selected a few low sugar high fat, gum free coffee creamers and my second go of coffee is more of a high fat buffer for my supplements.¬†

With this new protocol I added a little weight and will try to get to holding around 110

My Renpho scale app now reads all green instead of that pesky ‚Äúmuscle mass‚Äù being low.

With my new supplement protocol my main goal is to address my low end B12, D3 results up to more ‚Äúnormal‚Äù levels.

See comments for my new supplement stack. I welcome and advice, comments, etc

**Hair**

I‚Äôm absolutely certain now that my weight loss phase contributed to excessive hair loss. I now since leveling out and maintaining my current weight range have noticed much more luxurious hair and no fall at all when I shower. I used to clog the drain every time I shampooed. So, there‚Äôs hope for those of you experiencing this phenomena. Almost no fall since in maintenance. Whoot!

**DEXA Scan**

Planning on getting a baseline DEXA scan to see how my bone density is and monitor it. Anyone know of or tried a good independent testing facility? I‚Äôm in The SF Bay area. I‚Äôll of course ask my PCP to have this test, but want to have a backup in case she decides no.

**Planning new subQ stack**

I‚Äôve been following some people online and have decided to start my new subQ stack as soon as they all arrive. Thymosin Alpha-1, Glutathione, Methyl-cobalamin and GHK-cu.

**SKIN**

My face has had multiple compliments in the past few weeks. I‚Äôm thinking it could be the new protocol of nightly Biopelle Emepelle night cream I‚Äôve been using diligently. It‚Äô s claim is to restore some estrogen to menopausal skin without crossing into the system. So, I am not getting the estradiol systemically with some sort of proprietary thing they are calling MEP technology. I will continue using it and maybe check out some other stuff they have. I found this product by investigating estradiol for the face and learning that vaginal estradiol absorbed to crossed systemically and could cause undesired consequences like estrogen overload and/or trigger melasma with hormonal changes by adding the inappropriate dosage of estradiol to the system. I‚Äôll report back on anything new I try. My neck has also improved. Using Strivectin neck cream and I also think that over time the skin does tighten up after weight loss and prioritizing protein in the diet.

**Lab Results**

Had a discussion about my results with PCP yesterday. She ordered more labs to test my higher bilirubin levels. I have stellar liver function so she‚Äôs thinking a benign diagnosis of Gilbert‚Äôs Syndrome. I‚Äôll learn more about this if it‚Äôs confirmed. Lab scheduled for 13 Oct.

**Notes**

My B12 bump up was after microdosing cyanocobalamin (subQ) + sublingual methylcobalamin this past month.

Plan: continue with subQ microdosing, retest with other labs on the 13th to see if it‚Äôs climbing.

New supplement stack started Sept 13

SubQ B12 (micro dose 0.125mg)

Current Maintenance Dosing

Maintenance dose:¬†

\~1-1.2mg R3ta twice weekly +¬†

\~0.8mg Tz twice weekly.¬†

**New Supplement Details**

I started 13 September. Since I still follow a time restricted my eating schedule even in maintenance, I‚Äôve had to make some adjustments, so I am able to take my mid-morning supplements that require food or fat as suggested for maximum absorption.

I‚Äôve selected a few low sugar high fat, gum free coffee creamers and my second go of coffee is more of a high fat buffer for my supplements.¬†

With this new protocol I added a little weight and will try to get to holding around 110

My Renpho scale app now reads all green instead of that pesky ‚Äúmuscle mass‚Äù being low.

With my new supplement protocol my main goal is to address my low end B12, D3 results up to more ‚Äúnormal‚Äù levels.

See comments for my new supplement stack. I welcome and advice, comments, etc

**Hair**

I‚Äôm absolutely certain now that my weight loss phase contributed to excessive hair loss. I now since leveling out and maintaining my current weight range have noticed much more luxurious hair and no fall at all when I shower. I used to clog the drain every time I shampooed. So, there‚Äôs hope for those of you experiencing this phenomena. Almost no fall since in maintenance. Whoot!

**DEXA Scan**

Planning on getting a baseline DEXA scan to see how my bone density is and monitor it. Anyone know of or tried a good independent testing facility? I‚Äôm in The SF Bay area. I‚Äôll of course ask my PCP to have this test, but want to have a backup in case she decides no.

**Planning new subQ stack**

I‚Äôve been following some people online and have decided to start my new subQ stack as soon as they all arrive. Thymosin Alpha-1, Glutathione, Methyl-cobalamin and GHK-cu.

**SKIN**

My face has had multiple compliments in the past few weeks. I‚Äôm thinking it could be the new protocol of nightly Biopelle Emepelle night cream I‚Äôve been using diligently. It‚Äô s claim is to restore some estrogen to menopausal skin without crossing into the system. So, I am not getting the estradiol systemically with some sort of proprietary thing they are calling MEP technology. I will continue using it and maybe check out some other stuff they have. I found this product by investigating estradiol for the face and learning that vaginal estradiol absorbed to crossed systemically and could cause undesired consequences like estrogen overload and/or trigger melasma with hormonal changes by adding the inappropriate dosage of estradiol to the system. I‚Äôll report back on anything new I try. My neck has also improved. Using Strivectin neck cream and I also think that over time the skin does tighten up after weight loss and prioritizing protein in the diet.

**Lab Results**

Had a discussion about my results with PCP yesterday. She ordered more labs to test my higher bilirubin levels. I have stellar liver function so she‚Äôs thinking a benign diagnosis of Gilbert‚Äôs Syndrome. I‚Äôll learn more about this if it‚Äôs confirmed. Lab scheduled for 13 Oct.

**Notes**

My B12 bump up was after microdosing cyanocobalamin (subQ) + sublingual methylcobalamin this past month.

Plan: continue with subQ microdosing, retest with other labs on the 13th to see if it‚Äôs climbing.

1nve7xa,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nve7xa,Update: TSA and flight experience with my pet jumping spider (no issues!),"I wanted to share my experience flying within the U.S. with my pet jumper in case anyone ever needs the logistics, since I couldn‚Äôt find much firsthand info before my trip. Many people recommended mailing it due to the potential stress of air travel, but overnight shipping would have still been via air and I decided this way would give me better control over temperature, pressure, and potential delays. Disclaimer that this is just my experience, I obviously don‚Äôt know that this is how it would go every time, but I would‚Äôve appreciated a first hand account before flying so I decided to share. 

TSA call: I called ahead, and TSA confirmed that as long as the spider was in a clear, secure container, it could go through by hand inspection. The rep mentioned the 3.4 oz liquid rule, but the recording wasn‚Äôt clear on whether that limit applied here. To be safe, I chose a container much smaller than 3.4 oz. I also confirmed that if, for any reason, they decided not to allow it through, I would be permitted to step out of line with the spider to arrange another option, and that TSA would not destroy it.

TSA interaction: At the checkpoint, I told the officer I needed a hand check on one item. He asked what it was, and I explained it was a tiny pet jumping spider in a secure container. He rolled his eyes a little but waved me to hand it over. He walked it around the x-ray machine and passed it to another officer. After I went through the body scanner, that officer was holding the jar and asked if it was mine. When I told him it was Phidippus princeps, he asked what that meant, so I explained it was a jumping spider. He joked, ‚ÄúWill anything cool happen if it bites me?‚Äù I told him no, and that it‚Äôd be hard to even get it to bite at all. He laughed and said, ‚ÄúAw man, I was hoping I could get off work.‚Äù We chatted for a second, then he handed the jar back and wished me a safe flight. That was it ‚Äî no hassle, no issues, and no risk of them destroying her.

Airline rules: Probably not allowed on most airlines, but they don‚Äôt search luggage and I had zero issues being discreet.

Travel setup: I used a tiny jam jar with air holes drilled in the lid (sanded smooth so there were no sharp edges). Inside, I wedged a fake flower so it couldn‚Äôt shift and added a lightly dampened piece of cotton in case she got thirsty. The jar went into a paper coffee cup with napkins around it for stability, lid snapped on (sip hole open). I kept the cup upright the whole time and periodically peeked in on her during the trip to make sure she didn‚Äôt seem distressed. 

Spider‚Äôs behavior: She built herself a small silk retreat in the jar and stayed in it for most of the flight. She was calm and barely moved, which I think was just her way of resting through the noise and vibration. Once home, I placed the jar in her regular enclosure and opened it. She came right out, explored, and settled in like nothing had happened. She‚Äôs now eating, building, and behaving totally normally.

So if anyone is ever looking for actual travel logistics, this setup worked smoothly and there were zero issues with TSA for me.",95,1759338866.0,jumpingspiders,13,0.98,False

Equipped with a handle-tie design, these bags are a blend of practicality and reliability, which caught my eye initially when strolling through reviews. I mean, who doesn't appreciate convenience in a task as unglamorous as dealing with trash? Their 13-gallon capacity is a sweet spot for my kitchen needs, fitting perfectly in standard-sized bins and having just the right durability for those days I overestimate the capacity of my garbage can.

**Functional Design That Speaks Convenience**

One thing that hooked me almost instantly about these trash bags is their handle-tie feature. Unlike typical drawstring garbage bags that sometimes seem to have a mind of their own, the handles on these give you a firmer grip when closing or lifting a filled bag. You know that unnerving feeling when a regular garbage bag tears right in the middle of transferring it to the larger receptacle? Somehow, these bags have managed to avoid that stress completely. That said, I‚Äôve tested the limits with coffee grinds, leftover casseroles, and even broken ceramic pieces‚Äîand they passed the test. Simply tying the handles creates a secure closure that avoids the messiness mid-transfer.

[Check Glad 1258760764 price on Amazon.](https://go.senaar.com/p/b004xjmbq0/)

**Strength and Stretch for the Win**

The stretchability of these trash bags honestly surprised me. They feature some sort of diamond-pattern reinforcement, which I think must be their not-so-secret weapon. While loading heavier items like partially used paint cans or a stack of newspapers, I noticed the bag would stretch but not puncture. That elasticity gives you peace of mind, especially during kitchen deep cleans or spring decluttering efforts. Their ability to handle the weight of full water bottles (yes, I tested that!) without ripping almost feels like a superhero superpower.

**Positives**

- Handle-tie closure makes handling and disposal incredibly user-friendly
- Strong, stretchable design that keeps garbage containment mess-free
- Generous 13-gallon capacity, perfect for everyday kitchen use
- Versatile enough for office and house chores 

**Flaws**

- The material, though durable, doesn‚Äôt mask odors entirely, especially with strong kitchen waste
- White color makes the contents easily visible, which may not be ideal for public areas

**Competitive Options**

Comparing this product against other garbage bags like Hefty and Kirkland‚Äôs generic options, Glad comes pretty close to bridging practicality and reliability. While Hefty bags are thicker, they sometimes fall short on handle design, making Glad bags more convenient for someone who prefers less hassle. Nevertheless, Kirkland‚Äôs trash bags are marginally cheaper, albeit without any specific standout features like the handle ties or reinforcement bands Glad offers. Price-conscious people might lean toward Kirkland, but for those seeking stress-free trash management, Glad has the edge.

**Affordable Quality**

Considering the features versus its competitors, I‚Äôd categorize these trash bags as a product that offers decent ""value for the money."" The slightly higher price point reflects thoughtful design and durability, which justify the investment. Having used cheaper alternatives that split under pressure (let‚Äôs not relive that disastrous spaghetti-night incident), I‚Äôd return to these bags any day, as they consistently deliver what‚Äôs promised.

Same fluorescent buzz, same sticky floors, same stack of rules that made less sense the longer I looked at them. But then everything went quiet. Not ‚Äúnormal quiet,‚Äù like when you forget the music‚Äôs turned off ‚Äî no, this was the kind of silence you only notice right before something explodes. Even the cicadas outside shut up.

That‚Äôs when I realized: the gas station wasn‚Äôt waiting for me to finish the shift.
It was waiting for me to notice it.

The ceiling lights flickered, then died. For a second, the gas station was black and silent.
Then‚Äî

WHRRRRRRR.

Every machine screamed awake at once. The Slushee dispenser erupted, spraying neon syrup until it rolled across the floor like a glowing flood. The coffee maker hissed and howled, steam shrieking through the air like an animal in pain. The bug zapper spat arcs of blue fire across the ceiling until the tiles rattled.

The intercom crackled.
‚ÄúJack.‚Äù

Something in the way it said my name‚Äîtoo loud, too close, too knowing‚Äîmade my stomach clench. For the first time all night, I didn‚Äôt have a joke ready.

‚ÄúYou are not an employee. You are a placeholder.‚Äù

The lottery printer roared. Dozens of tickets shot out, pinning themselves against the walls in a storm of paper. Each one bore the same word in bold, black ink:
VOID.

My throat went dry. I forced a laugh, but it came out thin, shaking.
‚ÄúCool. Guess I didn‚Äôt win the Powerball.‚Äù

The candy machine glass fractured from within. The shelves rattled. One by one, the bags of chips split open, spilling dust and crumbs in tiny avalanches that ran together into words across the tile:
DO NOT LEAVE.

My pen slipped in my fingers. The ink line I‚Äôd been writing smeared across the page like a pulse. For half a second, I almost dropped it.

‚ÄúNot really an option,‚Äù I muttered, my voice steadier now, dragging the mask back on. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ankle-deep in radioactive Slushee. OSHA would have a field day.‚Äù

The voice spread. It came from the cooler, from the floor drains, from the Slushee machine bubbling like a throat full of static.

‚ÄúThis location is not a building. It is a terminal.‚Äù

The air grew heavy, pressing against my chest until every breath felt like drowning in syrup. The humming deepened, vibrating in my teeth, in my skull, in my bones.

‚ÄúIf you quit, there will be no replacement. If you die, there will be no record. You are the only continuity.‚Äù

The lights blazed back to life ‚Äî not white, but a throbbing plaid that crawled across the walls and ceiling like a pulse. For a moment, I swear the pattern twisted into something alive, watching.

The intercom hissed, its final command crawling into the marrow of my bones:
‚ÄúRule #20: If the gas station acknowledges you, do not acknowledge it back.‚Äù

And just like that, silence. The syrup flood stilled. The plaid dissolved into ordinary flickering fluorescents.

I stood ankle-deep in glowing Slushee, surrounded by paper scraps that all whispered VOID when I touched them.

My hand still shook. I exhaled.
‚ÄúGreat. Another damn rule.‚Äù

But otherwise, I can live fairly normal. I struggled far more at first, so maybe after all the time I just became used to it all. 

When talking to my gastro, it was the normal avoid acidic foods, here‚Äôs some famotidine. When I asked how I could actually ‚Äúcure‚Äù it, she said that it‚Äôs not something you cure, that it‚Äôll ‚Äúcome back‚Äù with certain foods, sickness, allergies. I accepted that as the truth and gave up on any sort of ‚Äúcuring‚Äù myself. 

Now I‚Äôm miserable. While I‚Äôm not debilitated by pain, I am exhausted from having it. It‚Äôs such a ridiculous ailment‚Äî I can have coffee every day and have no increased pain for two weeks, then one day I have something I can‚Äôt even pinpoint to be the culprit and I can‚Äôt button my pants and the burn is 10x worse. 

I want to try to cure this again. I made the decision to cut out coffee and avoid anything acidic a few days ago. I still have the famotidine plus a refill, but I‚Äôm so cautious about medications. I tried slippery elm and those types of things in the beginning, so maybe I‚Äôll go back to those again.

Idk, I just needed to get it out there that this feels like such a defeating thing in my life. ",2,1759338541.0,Gastritis,2,1.0,False

1nvdzbf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1nvdzbf/fianc√©_24m_was_drunk_after_an_argument_thinks_he/,"Fianc√© (24M) was drunk after an argument, thinks he hurt me (23F) even though he didn‚Äôt. How do i make him believe me?","so me (F23) and my fiance (M24) have been together for over 7 years, got engaged last year, we arent rushing into marriage but yeah. i have some health issues that make make him kind of (very) protective of and we often have disagreements over my health since he can be strict sometimes but we usually solve them within the same day.



Yesterday we were getting coffee, everything was going well, then he got a call. he told me it was a 'colleague' but he went to the side to take a call, which was quite weird to me (i know its a small thing, but he never really does that yk?) he looked stressed-ish after the call and that worried me. i asked him what happened he just brushed it off, then just within the next 2 minute, my phone rang. it was my dad, i told my fianc√© that hey its dad and he took the phone from me. i was like what is going on?



for context: my fiance and my father both are really close. my dad sees him as his own son and knows hes good for me plus theyre both quite protective of me so they get along well. so it was VERY unusual for me.



he told me to not pick up the call and i was really confused, while i'd trust him usually i had figured the earlier colleague wasn't a colleague so i just asked him if he and my dad had some sort of argument. Yep, they did. apparently it was about me too. my dad can be quite overbearing sometimes about me, my fiance is the same so they sometimes clash because of minor disagreements but its very minor. so i was worried, because i know my dad. he can be stubborn, i just never expected him to be like that with my fiance since he never had a reason to. but now i was scared if my dad would call me home or some crazy thing.



After some yelling back and forth, he admitted my dad had ‚Äúsuggested something‚Äù that he disagreed with, and my dad said ‚Äústuff‚Äù that clearly upset him, so im sure it must've been extreme. He wouldn‚Äôt tell me details. And that really bothered me because 1) if my dad was giving him shit, I deserve to know, right? 2) I just wanted to help him. I offered to talk to my dad, smooth things over, whatever. But my fianc√© shut me down, said I shouldn‚Äôt meddle, he‚Äôd handle it. He probably felt guilty since he knows how close I am with my dad (he‚Äôs my only family besides my fianc√©).



the argument kind of escalated because he just wont understand that im worried about HIM because he just looked so stressed. he had med school, then theres me to worry about and my dad on top of that? it really bothered me. my fiance really has always had troubles in kind of taking help? he has this thing where he needs to do everything himself and its annoying sometimes because im only trying to help.



then he suddenly flipped it into me not respecting his boundaries, when all I wanted was to help. that pissed me off so i just told him to do whatever he wants to and yeah we didnt speak on the way home. i changed and stuff and went directly to bed without checking up on him and i had no idea he was DRINKING outside.



very important context: This floored me because he rarely drinks ‚Äî even at parties ‚Äî and he dealt with an abusive alcoholic at a very young age, so alcohol is a huge trigger for him. The fact that he reached for it at all told me how badly this was weighing on him.



now i was half asleep when he climbed into bed. he pulled me close, kissed me, i kissed him back. i thought he was just trying to reconcile, and honestly i can never stay mad at him for long. and i know he tends to beat himself over little stuff but then i realized he was drunk. i asked him what he was doing and he looked kind of upset/frustrated. he was starting to initiate more and i was going through with it because well üòê but then stopped myself because i knew he‚Äôd hate himself in the morning. so i told him: ‚Äúi don‚Äôt want to stop you but just need you to focus here for a second, you‚Äôll regret this tomorrow if we do it while you're drunk.‚Äù and immediately he relaxed, apologized, said he just wanted to feel close to me. i told him i know, and that i‚Äôd hold him. he apologised about earlier too he was more sleepier by now and well that was that, i thought.



The next morning though, he woke me up looking terrified. He said ‚Äúwhat happened last night? I‚Äôm so sorry.‚Äù He only remembered half of it. He thought he had forced himself on me. he remembered kissing me and he is now assuming that i wouldnt want to kiss him like that so he mustve forced it on me. I told him over and over what actually happened ‚Äî that he didn‚Äôt, that I kissed him back because i wanted to, that I stopped him before anything, and that he apologized immediately ‚Äî but he wouldn‚Äôt believe me. He was crying actually and kept begging me not to lie. It broke my heart. i had no idea what to do.



I made him eat breakfast later on, gave him medicine for his hangover, but he stayed quiet and went to his classes while i kinda was skipping my own (he rarely ever skips so i let him). I tried to reach him later, but he didnt answer my texts. i thought he needed to cool off or something and i figured he mustve been at the library. He finally came home late. i was kind of upset and told him that he cant avoid me and that its hurting me, He apologized to me but still avoided me and was very quiet, then insisted on sleeping in the living room.

I‚Äôve seen so many posts like this on Reddit and never thought I‚Äôd be writing one, but here we are. How do I convince him he didn‚Äôt do anything wrong or bad at all? How do I make him trust me about what actually happened? He‚Äôs shutting me out, and I literally can‚Äôt even sleep without him.

How do I convince him he didn‚Äôt do anything wrong to me? How do I make him believe me when I say I‚Äôm not scared of him?

**TL;DR:** Fiance got drunk after argument, kissed me, stopped when I asked. Now he thinks he forced me and won‚Äôt believe me when I tell him he didn‚Äôt.",1,1759338348.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

1nvdxoi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nvdxoi,Dipping low at night time,"Hi everyone I‚Äôm wondering if this is hypoglycemic or pre? I noticed symptoms of fatigue, weakness, not being able to concentrate, dizzy and headaches. They are always usually in the morning and don‚Äôt get better until evening. I was in the long Covid group and all of my other symptoms after 3 years have gone away. This is one i have had throughout but noticed it more recently. I never had this feeling before covid. Not alot of people could relate to low blood sugar there, they told me to get a glucose monitor so I did and I noticed this. I thought my sugar was too high but it‚Äôs low. I noticed if I skip a meal I would get really weak, panicky and dizzy then when I ate chicken and rice I would feel great and normal 30min later. That‚Äôs when I thought it might be a blood sugar issue. 

The 2nd slide is the daytime yesterday. Mind you I‚Äôm eating all day and have fruit and snacks in between. I work from home so I really made sure to eat all day basically. I noticed I feel better when I‚Äôm around 90-100 but I don‚Äôt stay there. I have to eat constantly to stay above the 70s. I did eat oatmeal and fruit before bedtime and still dipped. I even tried eating my dinner later than usual. It‚Äôs like I have to constantly eat. I‚Äôve never felt like this and I‚Äôve never eaten so many carbs and fruit. At night I‚Äôve felt adrenaline dumps before but it‚Äôs better and basically gone. I thought it was histamine dumps and cleared w the low histamine diet. Now eating late and fruit I woke up a few times lastnight but I was 73 normal. 

The 3rd slide was my 2nd day on my monitor and I ate bigger meals with more carbs and I noticed way higher swings. Is this normal?  It‚Äôs mostly the nighttime that makes me nervous. I‚Äôve had anxiety, waking up w headaches, fatigue. Also skipping lunch or having a little lunch I would feel like I was going to faint. That concerns me also. What if I‚Äôm busy out and about or have an event. So far I‚Äôve been able to plan everyone with taking fruit in a lunch pale but I‚Äôve never been like this before. What if I want to travel? 

Did anyone start like this and get worse? Has anyone gotten better and not been as sensitive? Can this go away on its own? How did you all know you had hypothyroidism? Did it just start one day? I‚Äôm all of a sudden sensitive to sugar. Long Covid gave me histamine intolerance so I stopped eating chocolate, coffee, process foods, sugar. For 3 years it‚Äôs gotten better but this. My doctor said I don‚Äôt have diabetes and I‚Äôm ‚Äúno where close‚Äù was it because I‚Äôm so low. Why didn‚Äôt she tell me about this possibility? How do they even know if they only check you one day at one moment and it changes all day. Any help is appreciated. ",2,1759338249.0,Hypoglycemia,1,1.0,False

At first it was small things  like a slice of bread, a bit of milk, so ignored that, nothing worth fighting over. But then she began ‚Äúhosting‚Äù her friends at our place without even asking me, and I‚Äôd  usually come home to find entire bags of snacks, my coffee, and sometimes full meals gone. So I finally asked her about it, and what she said was ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt mind sharing, right? It‚Äôs not like you‚Äôll finish all this by yourself.‚Äù

I do meal prep for the week, so every missing container throws me off. Last week I came back from work and literally half the dinner I cooked for the week was gone because she let her friends ‚Äúhelp themselves.‚Äù AGAIN, When I told her I couldn‚Äôt afford to feed three extra people, she rolled her eyes and said I was being stingy with food. 

So I decided to buy a small lock for my pantry and started keeping most of my food inside. She was furious when she noticed and said I was making her look bad in front of her friends because ‚Äúnormal roommates don‚Äôt lock up food.‚Äù At this point I knew she started was already feeling entitled to my stuff, which doesn‚Äôt sit well with me 

Now some mutual friends are saying I escalated things by putting a lock on it instead of just setting stricter rules. I feel like I tried that already and it didn‚Äôt work, but now I‚Äôm second-guessing if I was too extreme.

Sonny Grosso‚Äôs biography, Harlem to Hollywood, which includes stories from working with Coppola on The Godfather.]

To get a feel for what the wiseguys were like for Sonny growing up in Harlem, Coppola asked him for stories from the frontlines. Grosso grew up surrounded by local mobsters like Tough Joey Rao, who ran Rao‚Äôs restaurant on 114th street. Later there was Fat Tony Salerno at the Palma Boys social club, who Grosso had to go visit to get permission to film that James Caan street fight scene. Anyway, when Coppola asked Grosso who was the guy even the wiseguys feared‚Äîand they mostly didn‚Äôt fear anyone‚Äîhe gave the director an interesting answer. It was local traffic cop, Officer Delaney, who would ""slap parking tickets onto the wiseguys‚Äô cars like it was going out style."" When they‚Äôd see him coming, they‚Äôd all rush to their cars to move them or plead their case. But he‚Äôd slap the tickets on anyway. And when he turned up at any of the local coffee/pastry places, the owners would go out of their way to give him free coffee and cannoli. Grosso says, ""They‚Äôd suck up to him, but when he left the area, they‚Äôd be cursing him and giving him the finger.""

Apparently, my Mom's father was a hoarder of coins and bills. He hated banks as he grew up in the depression. My grandmother knew he had a stash of money where he carved out a box in their closet and hid ""some"" money.... she thought they were poor as they lived off basically scraps. When my Grandfather passed, she said that he had ""a little saved"" and they should probably put the money in the bank. Needless to say, when she opened the hole in the wall she was completely shocked and couldn't fathom why they had to live like they were dirt poor. Grandma needed help carrying coffee cans full of coins and bills out of the closet, with several trips down the hallway. With the bills he hoarded away ended up being enough to cover the cost of his entire funeral, even in the 90's wasn't cheap. 
My Mom and Grandma  took out and saved all of the Bicentennial quarters ( because that was the year I was born ), the Morgan's, Peace Dollars, Indian Heads, Walking Liberties, mercury,  silver coins, some paper currency beginning in the 20's through the 40's. The rest they turned into the bank. 
Yesterday, Dad sprung on me that he has several coffee cans of old coins from his grandparents, some are from Germany, many are U.S. He also has coins from his parent's, and coins from my parents that everyone saved throughout the years. I had no clue I had a family of coin hoarders. 
Dad told me they are mine to worry about. I'm not taking them right now as I have no room for them nor the muscle power to carry the totes.

Would you start separating out in piles of quarters, nickles,dimes, etc., year? I know very very little about spotting error coins, but do have the ""Red Book"" and a lupe. I did begin my own little coin  collection 6-12 months ago without knowing what headed my way, guess it's in the genes.

While giving this product a thorough workout on various wood furniture and cabinetry around my home, I found plenty of points worth sharing. Every furniture-cleaning task seems to tell a story, and this one is no exception. Let me walk you through my experience with this product!

**Design and Packaging**

The twin-pack design of this cabinet cleaner immediately caught my attention. You get two 16-ounce bottles, each paired with a reusable microfiber cleaning towel. Seems straightforward enough, right? After tugging the sprayer nozzle, I noticed the bottle shape allowed for a comfortable grip‚Äîeven after cleaning for a prolonged period. The microfiber towel included in the package was soft but durable, providing a polished finish without scratching surfaces. Little details like this make a difference because not all cleaning kits come equipped with such thoughtful add-ons. 

**Ease of Use**

Spraying it on wood surfaces was incredibly easy, and the sprayer‚Äôs even mist helped me cover larger areas without oversaturating. I tried it on my kitchen cabinets, bedroom furniture, and even some wall paneling. Each spray dispersed a fine, light almond-scented mist that wasn‚Äôt too overpowering. Using the microfiber towel provided a streak-free shine, making me feel oddly accomplished as I buffed everything to perfection. Heck, even my dusty baseboards looked fancy afterward.

**Performance and Results**

The performance of this wood cleaner was probably its biggest standout quality for me. My wooden dining table had been looking dull, decorated with ghostly rings from old coffee mugs. To my surprise, this product made it sparkle again! I noticed it even warded off grime and prevented new watermarks for about a week. Beyond cleaning, it seemed to leave behind a protective barrier that resisted dirt and fingerprints. Kudos to the protection against cracks and fading‚Äîit gives the sense that my antique desk might survive the next hundred years in one piece.

**Benefits**

- Leaves no greasy residue.
- Protects against grime, watermarks, and discoloration.
- Restores shine to aged or faded wood furniture.
- Versatile and works on wood cabinets, tables, trims, and baseboards.
- Lightweight almond fragrance adds a fresh scent to your home.

**Areas of Concern**

While the list of positives is impressive, I can‚Äôt ignore certain limitations I encountered. 

- The instructions specify it‚Äôs unsuitable for wood flooring, which was a bummer since I intended to use it for that purpose initially.
- Though the almond scent is mild, I imagine some individuals may not appreciate any fragrance lingering on surfaces.
- Despite the excellent results on finished woods, it‚Äôs not ideal for unfinished surfaces or materials that may absorb too much product.

**Other Choices in the Market**

When comparing this product to alternatives like Murphy's Oil Soap Cleaner or Pledge Multi-Surface Cleaner, notable differences begin to emerge. Where Murphy's provides a more traditional, no-frills formula, it lacks the light scent and protective coating that I saw with this cleaning spray. Pledge, on the other hand, works wonderfully across wood and non-wood surfaces but doesn‚Äôt seem to guard against fading or cracking like the Weiman cleaner does. Each has strengths, but this product carved out its specific niche for maintaining and enhancing wood furniture.

**Affordable Quality**

This cabinet cleaning spray felt surprisingly aligned with its price-performance expectations. Considering that two bottles and a microfiber are packaged together, I felt like I was getting decent value. Competitors rarely toss in reusable towels, and even fewer deliver equally effortless results. After realizing how much this touched up my stubborn cabinets and neglected trim, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worth its cost for those looking to restore shine and provide lasting protection.

Background:

I am a man in his 40's with a small family.   I found the church last year and have been attending since August 2024,  I became a Catechumen this year before Pascha.   I attend Divine Liturgy every Sunday.   I attended in person all the Catechism classes.    My wife and son have no interest in this so I am doing this on my own.    

I have a prayer rule,  I am fasting, I am working on almsgiving.  I read the daily life of the saint and the scriptures.   I am trying to be Orthodox and I meet regularly with my Priest.

I am an introvert.  I was an only child.  I have always preferred and enjoyed doing things and being alone.   I am not afraid to do anything alone like a lot of people who won't travel or eat alone in restaurants.   I have never even felt the need for friends or missed friendship.   As of now outside of my neighbor I can't even think of 1 friend (not sad about this).   I don't even live in the same state as my parents and call them but don't feel any longing there.    I think you get the point.   

That said I don't have any issue sitting down and talking with people or being in groups and interacting.   I just am not the one who starts these things.  I take part and am active but I won't initiate.   

The Issue:

I am having a hard time with being part of the community.   I come to church 30-45 minutes before divine liturgy,  stand in my spot and no one says hello or greets me.   After Divine Liturgy is coffee hour.   I have stayed a few time and no one speaks to me so I just decide to leave.   It is painful for me to even stay to be honest.  It is so out of my element.   

I am expected to be part of this community.   I am expected to get close to people and ask someone to be a Godfather.    I just don't see how I can do that.  

I spoke to my Priest and his answer is he can assign me a Godfather but for the rest I just need to at least come to coffee hour twice a month.   

  
If being part of the community is such a big part of Orthodoxy.  I think I am screwed.   Like this is hard.",1,1759337963.0,OrthodoxChristianity,16,0.67,False

Here‚Äôs a quick, practical breakdown:

‚è±Ô∏è **Popular Fasting Schedules**

* **16/8** (fast 16h, eat within 8h) ‚Äî the most user-friendly, good starting point
* **18/6** ‚Äî more restrictive, potentially stronger effect, harder to sustain
* **24h once or twice a week** ‚Äî more extreme, better for those experienced
* **5:2** (normal eating 5 days, calorie restricted on 2)
* **Alternate-day fasting** ‚Äî very strict; can be tough long term

When choosing, match with your work hours, training schedule, and hunger tolerance. Start mild and gradually shift.

**ü•ó What to Eat (During Eating Windows)**

Focus on **whole, protein-rich, nutrient-dense foods**:

* Lean proteins: eggs, chicken breast, fish
* Vegetables & fiber sources
* Healthy fats: olive oil, avocado, nuts
* Complex carbs: quinoa, sweet potato, oats
* Avoid processed foods, sugary drinks, and excessive saturated fat

Also, **black coffee or plain tea** generally won‚Äôt break your fast (as long as no sugar/milk) and sleeping counts toward your fasting time.

**Chapter One:**

**Drowning**  


**February 3rd, 1956**



The revolver rattled in my hand.

I debated between my temple and the roof of my mouth, tossing the possibilities back and forth in my head, which I believed would soon have a hole blown through it. All the thoughts would spill out across the old wooden floorboards and stain the oriental rug by the fireplace if I chose the roof of my mouth. Or maybe they would reach the kitchen if I chose my left temple, surely an easier clean off the linoleum floor for anyone unlucky enough to clean up the mess.

A wild storm raged beyond the walls of my timid sixteen-hundreds farmhouse, . Snow melted to rain as the winds grew all the more barbaric, and the moon offered no light to behold the chaos. And exactly one month earlier, I‚Äôd lost my profession as a journalist, which I‚Äôd long considered to be my last outlet of fulfillment in life. Fired, actually. Fired from fulfillment.



I never fully grasped how dismal my circumstances had become until it was too late. My family left me in this town, moving on to better lives in brighter places; and the inner demons I‚Äôd picked up in the Second World War inhabited the empty spaces my loved ones had left behind.¬†

In another era, or even another town, I might have turned to someone for help, but you had to be *very* careful with who you told these things to. Without caution, the wind might sweep you away to the castle on the hill.



I‚Äôd wondered about that castle all my life. In fact, I was born the same year it was established, thirty-two years earlier. Neighborhood kids shared Folter Insane Asylum ghost stories on the playground, drunks swapped them in seaside bars, and mothers served them as warnings and threats with wooden spoons when their children misbehaved. Folter had known three consecutive homes for the insane within four centuries. Generations upon generations of foul stories washed down like mud from a burial hill, always festering in the present.

These tales of ghosts in the dark, glaring out of shattered windows, stories about corpses found rotting in the unkempt fields surrounding that great fort, devils in the tunnels beneath it, and of course, regular citizens who were never insane at all, winding up in there, and never getting out.¬†

Whether any of it was rumor or reality didn‚Äôt matter, we believed what we believed, and therefore it was the truth. Yet, even knowing this, I‚Äôd always wondered, was there any truth hiding in them?



Despite my long-prevailing curiosity, I *feared* that sanitarium. I thought it best to keep my journalism career far from Winslow Hill‚Äîironic, given the geographical immediacy between itself and my modest home. And even in the desperation of that night, I had no intention of writing about it, the thought hadn‚Äôt crossed my mind since long before I was fired. Even then, it was only a passing thought.

No matter. Too late for all that now.  
  


I could still feel that boulder on my chest. The weight of their watching eyes. The harmonious clattering of typewriter keys altogether silenced as my former employer wet his lips against his Folter Paper coffee mug. He liked it lukewarm and extra-sweet. He liked the heap of sugar huddled against the ceramic wall waiting ‚Äòtill all the rest was gone, like a dessert.¬†

‚Äò*Once you nail the right amount of sugar, maybe then you‚Äôll get on the front page*,‚Äô he used to joke. Half-joking and all in earnest. Shit joke, but I‚Äôd chuckle anyway. Eight years ago, and eight years of five packets of sugar in his two-to-three mugs of coffee every workday, not to mention the bakery goods, formed a man wider than he was tall. But who was I to throw a stone? All the while, I‚Äôd been passing up coffee, tea, and more recently, even water, for the ever-soothing ambrosia called alcohol.

Dust settled through the sweet, stale air of his office, decorating his coffee with micro-hairs and little skin follicles like a film over tepid soup. He sipped. ‚ÄúWade.‚Äù A few micro-hairs were gone.

Heavy under the fluorescent lights above, I mustered a simple, ‚ÄúM-hm.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou *do* realize what I‚Äôm saying?‚Äù His acrid coffee breath was almost a comfort with enough whiskey in my blood. A familiar stench. I liked familiarity, however unpleasant.

¬†‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù this time, I nodded. That would support my case, no doubt. Show that I still cared enough while my low-lidded eyes fretted between his mug and his little steel-gray lower teeth. ‚Äò*Were they always that dark?*‚Äô

‚ÄúWhat did I just say?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm laying off the drinking, O‚ÄôDonnell‚Ä¶ I promise.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt miss a beat, answering him. I even nodded again, this time with a cool, smooth blink. ‚Äò*That‚Äôs good. Good, calm, confidence. Thank you, whiskey-*‚Äô

He sighed. A *sharp* sigh. Or was that a hiss? His stout fingers dug against his brow, hiding a glare I was thankful to remain ignorant of until he adjusted and spoke up again, ‚Äú*Wade.*‚Äù Darkened eyes glared through searing disappointment.¬†

‚Äò*Is that not what he said? What did he say? How long have I been sitting here? Fuck, how much did I drink?*‚Äô I felt hot. A river of sweat formed down the furrow of my back. ‚Äò*No, this is just a talk, that‚Äôs all. Just a warning, right.*‚Äô

He tapped his pen against the rim of his desk, ‚ÄúI hope you do quit drinking, for your sake. I‚Äôve been extremely patient with you, Bythorne. I like you. You were an excellent journalist for years, one of the best. But‚Ä¶ that journalist has been gone for months.‚Äù His thick lower lip suspended from his protruding underbite, a dash of spittle dotted the newspapers between us.¬†

‚Äò*What‚Äôs he saying? Why is he doing this?*‚Äô¬†

He threw the pen against the papers, shaking his head, ‚ÄúWade, I‚Äôm *firing* you.‚Äù

The whiskey in my veins twisted against dizzying reality. Lights above brightened, hummed, and flickered, while the staring eyes of my coworkers reflected in O'Donnell's half-moon wireframe glasses. ‚ÄúOh.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt just keep you here out of pity, I gave you a week‚Äôs notice to clean up your act, but I‚Äôve gotten nothing of substance from you for‚Ä¶ Christ, half a year now? I‚Äôm only losing money with you here. This is a job, not a charity, and if you have nothing to offer, I have nothing to pay you. Maybe someday you‚Äôll turn things around and prove yourself capable, but for now‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre done here.‚Äù Among the reflected stares, one smirk ricocheted.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Jacob, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù



	

‚Äò*It‚Äôs Jacob, isn‚Äôt it*,‚Äô¬†

‚Äò*Where would I be if I hadn‚Äôt been drafted*,‚Äô

‚Äò*If I had worked harder and stayed away from liquor, I would still have my job*,‚Äô¬†

‚Äò*If my life wasn‚Äôt such a train wreck, then I wouldn‚Äôt* have *to drink,*‚Äô

‚Äò*What if I pulled the trigger? What if I died tonight?*‚Äô

After all, it was a gift‚Äîan off-kilter, tonally deaf post-war homecoming gift‚Äîand what does one do with a gift received, if not use it as they see fit? My brother‚Äôs charitable heart was in the right place, doubtless underestimating the grating association I had with guns since the war. A decade later, and the muscles in my face still ached, the smile failing to reach my eyes.

What would my brother have thought of this gift if he knew I would nearly shoot myself with it? What will my brother think when he learns what I *have* done?

Forgive me, dear brother.



‚Äò*Forgive me-*‚Äô

‚Äò*Do not blame* *~~yourself~~* *yourselves-*‚Äô

‚Äò*I love y-*‚Äô

‚ÄúForget it. They‚Äôll be fine without it.‚Äù

I took another swig of scotch, scratched my beard, and flipped both middle fingers at my Underwood No. 5 typewriter. Dad, Ma, Frank, and myself glared blankly over the room from a portrait in the kitchen‚Äîof a set of photos, taken to celebrate my brother‚Äôs going away to university. In them, gleeful pride among the three brightened the sharp contrast beside myself, failing to hide the fear shuddering inside like a pressure cooker. The day before, a letter in the mail informed me that I‚Äôd been drafted.¬†

A friend once asked if I thought it was strange that my parents decided to celebrate like this before my brother had even stepped foot on university grounds, while only a single photo was taken before I left for the war: me in my uniform, my father waiting in the car beside me, my mother behind the camera, and my brother, already departed for a brighter, safer future. I just laughed. I never liked photo albums anyway.

‚ÄúYeah. They‚Äôll be fine,‚Äù I lifted the bottle of scotch to my lips and-

*Thunk.*¬†

*Scratch.*

*Thump.*

A shuffling against the front door‚Ä¶ and a yelp.

\-I took another swig, ‚Äò*Just the dog*.‚Äô

I pulled the unfinished letter from the typewriter, peering, dim through intoxication and the shadow my frame cast over it‚Äîthe fire raged all the more furiously in the fireplace behind me as the storm‚Äôs wind shot down the chimney and wrestled with the flames‚Äîbut peering failed to aleve confusion.

‚Äò*Forgive me-*‚Äô

‚Äò*Do not blame* *~~yourself~~* *yourselves-*‚Äô

‚Äò*I love y-*‚Äô

‚Äò*Drown-*‚Äô

‚Äò*Burn-*‚Äô

‚Äò*Very good work-*‚Äô

‚ÄúWhat? I-I didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù

*Thump*.

*Knock*.

*Scratch*.

‚ÄúWhy would I write that?‚Äù I plucked a split-end hair from my beard, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt write that‚Ä¶ How much did I drink?‚Äù The bottle of scotch was nearly empty. I‚Äôd just bought it that morning. Above my desk, a grand oil painting of two great ships lost in a mid-Atlantic tempest. It had hung there all my life, it was my grandfather‚Äôs creation, yet that night, through the storm within and without, I witnessed the scene in a new, violently ominous light. Was the wind slipping out from the painting? Will a torrent of ocean waves cascade from the brass frame and strangle me in the sea of my living room?

I decided I‚Äôd had enough to drink.

I had enough of everything.

I exchanged the bottle of scotch for the revolver, traced my thumb across the smooth, polished metal, stared down the barrel, double-checked the bullets in the cylinder, and pressed it against my brow. ‚Äò*No. Not there.*‚Äô The barrel flitted between my mouth and my temple, back to my brow, down to my chest, tapped an artery on my neck, and rested on my temple again. I drew in a sharp breath as if preparing to dive into the painting before me and tensed my finger around the trigger, but against every ounce of my will, it would not pull back. I pushed out a sharp breath, growled, and slammed the gun on the desk.¬†

‚Äò*Very good work-*‚Äô

Those three words blinded me, ‚ÄúI know I didn‚Äôt write that,‚Äù I whispered.

*Knock! Knock! Knock!*

‚ÄúHelp‚Ä¶ Please‚Ä¶‚Äù a frail voice called from my doorstep.



Drunkenly cautious, I crossed the room to the front door and opened it to find a shaking, haggard young woman, glaring up from my feet. Beyond and bearing down, the lights of the Folter Psychiatric Institute seemed to glow brighter than ever.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  


**Chapter Two:**

**White Rabbit**

  
  


‚ÄúHere,‚Äù I slung a blanket around her shoulders and sat her on a chair beside the fireplace, ‚Äúthis should help some,‚Äù all the while struggling to think and act as sober as possible, and for the first time, I was thankful for the tolerance I‚Äôd built up over the years. Still, drunk as I was, I don‚Äôt know if I helped steady her to the chair, or if she helped me.

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù she whispered with a freshly busted upper lip, one of the only discernible features behind the heavy black curtain of her hair, festooned with rust-brown oak leaves and pine needles. Hunched over, gripping the blanket like a life raft, she stared at the fire as though she shared some secret with it that I wasn‚Äôt yet privy to.

	‚ÄúAre you in danger, did someone hurt you?‚Äù

	She hesitated, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

	‚ÄúOkay‚Ä¶ do you want me to call the police?‚Äù

	‚Äú*No!*‚Äù She shot a soul-piercing stare at me, ‚Äú*Please‚Ä¶*‚Äù

	I nodded, ‚ÄúAlright‚Ä¶‚Äù The room tilted, spun, and repeated as I closed my eyes, the reality of my drunken state returned to me, ‚ÄúIs it alright if I sit, are you okay for now?‚Äù

	‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you‚Ä¶‚Äù I dropped like a stone into the identical red-cushioned wingback chair beside her. The oppressive heat of the hearth made battling the vertigo no easier, but I was familiar enough with willing my equilibrium back into balance.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm here so late,‚Äù she whispered, as if I‚Äôd been expecting her.¬†

‚ÄúUh-that‚Äôs alright, it‚Äôs‚Ä¶‚Äù What time was it? The mantelshelf clock shivered in my blurred vision, ‚Äò*Twelve-ten? God, I drank too much‚Ä¶ Or not enough.*‚Äô The cool metallic ring of my revolver‚Äôs barrel chilled, hot on my temple. I wondered if the woman could see it, red skin, a perfect circle, liquor-blood begging for that icy touch again.¬†

Through settling vertigo, my dog sniffed the path of blood, mud, and rain she‚Äôd tracked in on her way to the red-cushioned chair, now soaking like a sponge. I‚Äôd hardly noticed him following her inside. ‚Äò*What is happening? What am I doing? I should be dead right now,*‚Äô and now, this lost stranger shivered before me, inadvertently saving my life. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre freezing, would you like tea or water? I‚Äôm sorry, I don‚Äôt have coffee‚Ä¶‚Äù

She shook her head. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright‚Ä¶‚Äù I would‚Äôve asked if she was sure, assured her it was no problem, but the way she stared at the fire, those eyes were certain. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy name?‚Äù Her brow jumped, ‚ÄúBunny.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúBunny‚Ä¶‚Äù A fitting name, no doubt‚Äîsoft, twitching face, oddly bulging black eyes. She might‚Äôve resembled Audrey Hepburn under vastly different circumstances. ‚ÄúWade Bythorne,‚Äù ‚Äò*Folter Paper journalist*‚Äô nearly followed under drunken habit.¬†

Her face answered with compulsory etiquette. For a half-second, the instinct to smile overruled her discomfort.

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt knock at first, did you? All I heard was some shuffling out there for some time, I thought maybe it was just my dog. How long were you out there?‚Äù The dog plopped down between myself and the fireplace with a bassy groan.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ um‚Ä¶ I-I reached your door, and I felt faint. I fell and everything went dark‚Ä¶‚Äù She spoke to the fire, gazing into it as if it had asked her the question. She tugged at her bottom lip as words eluded her. ‚ÄúThen I‚Ä¶ I knocked as hard as I could‚Ä¶‚Äù Her voice was soft, weak, and quiet, gradually growing in strength with each word. Little, dubious, woven flowers speckled her dismally blue frock, pinched and pressed between her thumb and index finger. I felt the coarse-thread fabric grating against itself in the resistance between her fingers. Wide eyed, her dilating black-pit pupils centered on me with such focus that sent the room spinning again. ‚ÄúThank you‚Ä¶ *so much* for letting me in,‚Äù a tear gathered in her right eye, lit up like a spark in the firelight as it crept down to her trembling chin, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôd do if they found me. No one‚Äôs ever escaped before‚Ä¶‚Äù Still, the Folter Psychiatric Institute‚Äôs lights glared through the midnight storm.

‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

She pinched the ugly frock harder.

‚Äò*What have I done?*‚Äô

Her head shook involuntarily, descending into her lap, caught only by her descending hands. A thick hair parting down the center of her skull revealed a pale, white scalp. Rounded shoulders hopped, drawing in sharp, sobbing breaths, and between those breaths, she fit, ‚ÄúYou-*huh* think-*huh* I‚Äôm c-crazy-*huh*!‚Äù

I shifted in my seat, ‚ÄúNo, um‚Ä¶ no, I-I just didn‚Äôt realize‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry-‚Äù

Little white fingers slipped up between her black hair and pressed against her ears, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just like Cora-*huhhh*!‚Äù Each panicking breath was like the sharp strike of an off-key violin. ‚Äú‚Ä¶It‚Äôs just like Cora,‚Äù she shook her head, whispering into her black hair veil, ‚ÄúCora‚Ä¶ all-*huh* over again‚Ä¶ and again, and again-*huh*‚Ä¶ and again-*huh*! And now look what they‚Äôll do to her! Now look what they‚Äôll do! You‚Äôll see! You‚Äôll see what they do!‚Äù

‚ÄúCora,‚Äù I asked, ‚Äúwho‚Äôs Cora? If someone‚Äôs in danger, I can try to help.‚Äù I don‚Äôt know if I really meant it. I just needed to end the panic.

She shifted back against her seat. ‚ÄúSomeone‚Äôs in danger.‚Äù She answered simply. With a deep breath, her shoulders rolled back, head raised, hair fell back away from her face, I could almost see the oxygen pulled into her lungs. She held out her hand before her, a spot of blood, vibrant before the fire, slipped from the base of her thumb, and landed in the fibers of the oriental rug at her feet. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like they want you to think,‚Äù She spoke with full clarity, even as another tear ran from her eye. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a hospital, it is *Hell*. And the superintendent, Doctor Kohler‚Ä¶‚Äù Another tear ran from her eye while a troubled laugh fell from her lips, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a brilliant deceiver.‚Äù She flashed her eyes at me, and momently, I thought I detected a smile in them. ‚ÄúHe disguises himself as a good man.‚Äù It almost sounded rehearsed, ‚ÄúYou *cannot* believe him.‚Äù

‚Äò*She‚Äôs been dreaming of this escape for a long time.*‚Äô

‚ÄúDoctor Kohler?‚Äù Everyone in Folter knew the name, he was after all, the only direct descendant of the eponymous Folter Family. And as an elderly man without a wife or children, he was the final descendant. ‚ÄúHe has a good reputation‚Ä¶ I mean, compared to his ancestors.‚Äù

She scoffed, ‚ÄúHow much have you heard? How often do you see him or hear of him in the news?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot much,‚Äù I shrugged. ‚Äò*Never.*‚Äô

‚ÄúExactly, he means to stay quiet. It‚Äôs no coincidence. There *are no* coincidences with Kohler. *None*.‚Äù

My brow furrowed and words spilled from my lips despite me, ‚ÄúThen how did you escape?‚Äù

She paused, her lips shot aside, lifting over a yellow smile. She laughed, ‚ÄúI escaped.‚Äù She lifted her eyes as if spotting a cobweb, then settled back on me, ‚ÄúThe hospital is understaffed. In all its years, more patients are brought in, the scale tips‚Ä¶ and in such a massive establishment, it‚Äôs getting easier to go about unnoticed‚Ä¶ I had to get out. I *had* to. So when I saw the opportunity, I took it.‚Äù¬†

The girl paused as if I‚Äôd spoken. Then stared past me with peculiar intensity, as if someone had stepped in on our conversation. I glanced over my shoulder, underwhelmed by the kitchen, empty apart from a mess of half-washed dishes and empty liquor bottles.

I rubbed my brow as Boo left my side and cowered under my desk, not abnormal in this weather, and all the while, Bunny‚Äôs gaze never left the kitchen. ‚ÄúAre you alright?‚Äù The low hum of a fly in flight grated through the air.

Her eyes withdrew from the kitchen and landed in the fire. ‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt believe me,‚Äù she whispered from a deeper register in her chest.

‚ÄúTry me.‚Äù I smiled kindly, but her eyes never left the flames to see it.¬†

Her lips quivered, peeling over bared teeth, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre saying.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry?‚Äù¬†

Her body slipped back into the chair, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll see,‚Äù she shook her head with an absurd smile, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù was she trying to comfort me? She laughed, her shoulders melted, ‚ÄúIf they find out what I said, I‚Ä¶‚Äù Another tear fell, yet this landed on a pinched smile, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not afraid to silence us. No tongue is safe.‚Äù She shot her eyes at me with a whisper, ‚ÄúNot even yours.‚Äù

I peered at her, ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù ‚Äò*How many of those rumors are true?*‚Äô

Her nostrils flared, lips curled, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt believe me. Fine. That‚Äôs fine, you don‚Äôt have to.‚Äù She settled her eyes on the flames again.

‚ÄúNo, no I do believe you. I‚Äôm only trying to understand.‚Äù¬†

I leaned forward and she leaned away as if guarding herself. Her stare left the flames and lingered at the windows by the door she‚Äôd come through. The asylum watched us from atop the hill.

I cleared my throat and conjured a journalist‚Äôs question as if I wasn‚Äôt freshly unemployed, ‚ÄúWhen were you first admitted?‚Äù though after asking, I realized she must‚Äôve been distracted by a hideously overgrown fly flitting about the room. In her defense, the buzzing as it flew was especially loud, and the abomination was abnormally massive, in fact, it may not have even been a fly at all‚Äîpaired with my drunken state and its aimless, rapid movements, the insect was utterly indistinct.

‚ÄúUm,‚Äù she met my eyes again, ‚Äúuh, thirteen years ago.‚Äù She traced the scrape along the base of her thumb and pressed her other thumb against it, swelling a ruby bead on her wrist.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a long time,‚Äù she nodded. ‚ÄúWhy were you admitted?‚Äù The insect flew into the dining room, out of sight, and more or less out of mind. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt mind me asking.‚Äù

‚ÄúI um‚Ä¶ I tried to end my life‚Ä¶‚Äù

I cleared my throat, only then did I realize the revolver still laid on my desk for all to see. ‚ÄúOh. Sorry, just one moment.‚Äù I stumbled out of the chair, slipped the revolver on my desk into a desk drawer, and locked it. There was no graceful way of doing this, but having drank as much as I had, even Boo seemed to sense the awkwardness, shuffling underfoot. Beside the abstract, unfinished suicide note, my pen and notepad glowed distinctly in the firelight, and again-¬†

‚Äò*Very good work-*‚Äô

\-whispered at me from the unfinished letter. ‚ÄúAll these years, and I still don‚Äôt know if I should be angry or thankful that they stopped me before I could end it,‚Äù Bunny thought aloud.

I grabbed the letter, crushed it between my hands, and tossed it into the fire. I knelt, peering. Maybe I‚Äôd find some solace watching the flames swallow the words I swear I hadn‚Äôt written, but it all curled inward and collapsed into black ash in seconds before I could see those words burn away. Besides, a drunk man peering into a fire isn‚Äôt a good combination, and that wasn‚Äôt exactly how I wanted to go, even in hopeless desperation.

‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù Bunny asked with unexpected clarity.

‚ÄúNothing. I-um‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry to hear that,‚Äù a weak attempt at consoling her, a self-flagellating curse struck my tongue behind pressed lips as I gripped the mantle for balance. ‚Äò*I‚Äôm not dying tonight. I‚Äôll just fall asleep and wake up with a hangover‚Ä¶ And I‚Äôll have to live knowing this was real. Shit, I need another drink-*‚Äô¬†

I glanced at the kitchen. There, just before the sink, something stared at me. Shadowy, though not as shadows cast silhouettes, nor as dark corners manifest dark imaginations, this darkness was felt before seen, and already disorienting before contemplation like an optical illusion. And the longer I stared back, the more distinctly I felt that it had been staring far longer than I could comprehend.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I uttered.

It smiled. A smile felt in the mind‚Äôs eye, confirmed in the freezing of my blood.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. I should know better than to ask,‚Äù Bunny apologized.¬†

The figure vanished in a moment too brief to carry weight‚Ä¶ but in that final glimpse, I swear I saw a physical form. Pallid-yellow skin rolled and stretched tight over bony limbs, pulsing, itching, screeching, echoing in its absence through ringing in my ears, the fly buzzing through the room again, and my pounding heart, there and gone so fast, was it ever there at all? But the image was too strong, the feeling too frigid to mistake. I dug my knuckles into my temples and dropped back into the chair.

‚ÄúAre you alright?‚Äù¬†

A glimpse at the kitchen‚Äîempty.¬†

I shook my head, ‚ÄúYes. I‚Äôm fine.‚Äù I lied and promised myself I‚Äôd never drink again‚Äîanother lie.¬†

‚ÄúDo you need me to get you anything? Water?‚Äù She asked.

I raised a brow at her, ‚ÄúNo, no‚Ä¶ Sorry, I can‚Äôt recall what we were talking about.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs alright. I was just saying, I‚Äôm much better now than I was back then.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight,‚Äù is that what she was saying?

‚ÄúNo thanks to those doctors and nurses, though. Only because I know true despair now, and I know to be thankful for what freedom out here offers.‚Äù

‚ÄúTrust me,‚Äù the fly hummed into the other room, ‚Äúit‚Äôs not all that great out here.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I thought before I wound up in that prison.‚Äù She spoke without missing a beat. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a matter of perspective, that‚Äôs all.‚Äù She spoke with undiluted confidence. The shift in her tone from earlier was so strong, I hated it.

‚ÄúRight, of course,‚Äù I buried a scoff under the response. ‚Äò*A matter of perspective. Cute.*‚Äô The crackling and popping fireplace struck the ringing lodged in my ears. ‚Äò*What the hell am I doing? Who is this woman? What is she doing here? I should be dead!*‚Äô¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I interrupted your night,‚Äù Bunny said. ‚ÄúYour house was the closest I could find. And it looked so inviting with the fireplace‚Ä¶‚Äù She shifted in her seat and stared at the fireplace again, ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen fire in so long.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, no, don‚Äôt be. I understand.‚Äù I always hated lying to appease someone. I always hated betraying myself, uttering anything glib, like words never bore truth to a soul, but what was I supposed to say? ‚Äò*What am I supposed to do? House this escaped lunatic in my home? What if¬† she‚Äôs completely delusional? What if she‚Äôs dangerous?*‚Äô Dammit. ‚Äú‚ÄòScuse me, I need to use the bathroom.‚Äù



Staff arrived within minutes. A mousy receptionist thanked me for my call, apologized for the disturbance, and Bunny was carried out, sobbing, kicking, and screaming.¬†



I dreamed that night,



*Bunny escaped before the authorities arrived. She must have heard me talking to them. I found her corpse the next morning in the little field in my backyard, not far from an unused, rotting barn, lying face-down in a puddle of melting snow. Her bloated, pale flesh glistened with dew in the overcast morning light. ‚Äò*Poor girl.‚Äô *I thought.*

*Somewhere unseen, the fly‚Äôs erratic flight grated ceaselessly. With it, clicking and chirping like that of a cricket.*

*She shifted on the grass. Her head tilted, the blood had settled on her left side in a sickly purple hue. Her lips separated, yellow liquid trickled down her cheek, and she whispered, ‚Äú*Very good work.*‚Äù*



Between reality and the dream, I don‚Äôt know which I would‚Äôve preferred.

‚ÄúYou lied!‚Äù She shouted, kicking a leg at me, as the authorities held her back. ‚ÄúLiar! You told me you‚Äôd help me! You have to do something! You can‚Äôt trust them!‚Äù I closed the door as the authorities locked her in the back of their stout, white car. Her shouting echoed through the night and awoke me in the morning with a feverish hangover.

‚Äò*I didn‚Äôt lie, did I?*‚Äô I couldn‚Äôt fight the impulse to look out the window and scan the field, looking for the corpse I‚Äôd seen in the dream. ‚Äò*Maybe I do owe her. She saved me without knowing it‚Ä¶*‚Äô Patches of puddles reflected the overcast sky, speckling the pale field with shriveling heaps of snow. A light fog hovered low over the evaporating snow. No Bunny, of course. ‚Äò*What did she save me from? Ending my own misery? What thanks does she deserve?‚Äô*¬†

Without owing her anything, I was still living without a purpose.¬†

Selfishly, I *had* to owe her for my life. Whether that meant ending Doctor Kohler‚Äôs potential reign of terror or somehow leveraging this as a way to regain my position as a journalist at the Folter paper, or both, there was purpose in my life to be found again. And despite rationality, guilt had already taken root, and fear with it, ‚Äò*What if she was telling the truth? If no tongue is safe, what are they doing to her now? And what might they do to me?*‚Äô

Whether the things she‚Äôd said were true or not, her fear was true, and her hope was real. And I delivered her back into a prison she called Hell.

  
  
  
  
  
  


**Chapter Three:**

**The Cure of Folly**

  
	

Downtown Folter, a weary congregation of what may confidently be deemed America‚Äôs most dismal citizens. The euphoric glamor of the nineteen-fifties heedlessly skimmed over the town, perhaps mistaking it for a shambolic tumor on the earth‚Äôs downcast face. Cluttered seaside shops, bars, and diners strangled in the low-tide air, heaped on them after hundreds of years of oceanic wind, apparent in every structure‚Äôs westward tilt. Centrally, a church-turned-library offered wisdom to those daring enough to seek it, though not before demanding visitors bear witness to the town founder, Thomas Folter, immortalized in oxidized bronze.

With billowing cape and forlorn gaze under a wide-brimmed hat, the infamous founder raises a hand, palm-upward, with each finger pointing at the most historic Folter structures‚Äîthough most had come to ruin since the statue‚Äôs construction. West, thumb and little finger touching, they aimed at Winslow Hill‚Äîthe abandoned Folter Manor and the asylum with it. Northeast, ring finger aimed at the Cliff House‚Äîwhich ironically collapsed off its cliff in a landslide and tumbled into the sea. East-aimed middle finger, the House of Three Tears‚Äîdevoured in a fire the same year Cliff House had collapsed. And index finger aimed southeast, the only house both remaining and accessible, and never owned by the Folter family, the Flitting House‚Äîn√©e Baxter House‚Äîwedged along the border of central Folter and the industrial district. The directions of his fingers aren‚Äôt exact in pointing at these locations, but it‚Äôs a fun fact locals like to tell visitors, on the rare occasion anyone visits.

Engraved on the plaque at his feet, ‚Äò*Thomas Folter. Father of the town. Father of the true Folters. Protector of freedom, perseverance, and the corporeal.*‚Äô I glowered at Thomas, proud atop his granite boulder while a stray dog passed by to piss on it. The Folters were a wicked people, but at the very least, the family, and the town they colonized, had lived up to their Germanic name, appropriately translating to ‚Äò*torture*‚Äô. Allegedly, the name originates as the Folters were torturers in service to some Germanic king for generations, countless centuries back.

Three homes collapsed or abandoned and his family line nearly extinct, leaving Doctor Kohler alone with his father‚Äôs name and the sins of his mother‚Äôs lineage. Given the power to rewrite the plaque, I might inscribe, ‚Äò*Thomas Folter. Ever-worthy of scoffs, dog piss, and bird stool.*‚Äô

Even so, the town bore his name, and that Son of Thomas knew no end.

	

  


Sealed in a glass box at the far end of an aisle of bookshelves, an impressively preserved black rabbit watched through thick jet marble eyes.¬†

Two days had passed, guilt had only metastasized, yet the allure of opportunity and the hope of being a savior to those wrongfully imprisoned in the asylum had swelled to a distracting proportion. *If* they were wrongfully imprisoned. The taxidermized rabbit glared suspect as I scanned the single shelf of town history books.

‚Äò*Birds of Folter, Massachusetts*‚Äô

‚Äò*Massachusetts Mysteries: Folter Architecture*‚Äô

‚Äò*Folter Flora and Fauna*‚Äô

‚Äò*Folter Governance: One Town Under Two Powers*‚Äô



‚ÄúFour books in the town history section, none on the asylum.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, I saw that,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAre there any checked out? Or any I could order?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù the heavyset librarian of about sixty years sidled between her desk and the dust-adorned pulpit, raised midway up the far wall of the library, where Thomas Folter supposedly once preached.¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre telling me you only have four books on the town‚Äôs history? Just four?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù the woman groaned, painfully lowering herself shakily into the creaking wooden chair. An oil painting of the town loomed over her head from the pulpit. As if in defiance, the Folter Psychiatric Institute atop Winslow Hill, pierced the overcast firmament with countless towers.

‚ÄúAlright.‚Äù I scuffed the olive-green rug beneath my shoes, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, but frankly, I‚Äôm having a hard time believing there are absolutely no books or documents or anything on any of the Folter asylums here. Or any on the Folter family, for that matter. *Folter Governance* seemed promising but the author barely addresses anything outside of the government.‚Äù¬†

She blinked.¬†

‚ÄúI mean, two of the four books are ecological, they hardly count as town history at all‚Ä¶‚Äù I waited for a response that didn‚Äôt come, and I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh, how the librarian seemed blind to the ridiculous reality of it was beyond me.

¬†A phlegmy cough echoed across the stale air, hardly any warmer than the world beyond the walls of the aged structure.

‚ÄúWould you mind at least double-checking the catalog? Is it possible someone took some books and never returned them?‚Äù

‚ÄúSir,‚Äù she chuckled, the little brass beads of her beige glasses clinked as she shook her head, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve worked here for the better part of my life. I *know* that what you‚Äôre looking for is not here.‚Äù

I raised a brow, ‚ÄúWhere would they be?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot here.‚Äù

I cleared my throat, ‚ÄúListen, I know this is an unconventional request, but I‚Äôm actually a journalist, I‚Äôm trying to research the asylum, and I just don‚Äôt know where to go or who to go to. I don‚Äôt know if you have anything locked up in another room, I know the asylum and the Folters have always been fairly secretive, but please if you have anything at all, I would really appreciate the help.‚Äù I leaned in, ‚ÄúI believe this article could be of greater importance than anything the Folter Paper‚Äôs ever published.‚Äù Stretching the truth was a necessary evil in such times, namely when trying to win back your journalism career.

‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶‚Äù Her white-hair brows lifted high over her glasses as she leaned close, ‚ÄúI think I remember you. Wade Blythe, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúBythorne.‚Äù

‚Äú*Bythorne*, that‚Äôs right. No, we don‚Äôt have anything locked up.‚Äù She smiled, ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm sure my husband would be *glad* to help you. You know, he used to work at the asylum.‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have time for this,‚Äù his heavy boots stomped across the salt-stained docks, reeking of sulfuric low-tide.¬†

	‚ÄúI‚Äôm not trying to sell you anything, it‚Äôll only take a moment of your time, really.‚Äù

The fisherman halted, ‚ÄúDo I know you?‚Äù A forest-green knit cap hugged his graying charcoal hair, falling like a waterfall over dry, cracked skin, calloused after years of violent sea wind and unforgiving labor.

‚ÄúWade Bythorne. Forgive me, I know this is abrupt, but I have some questions that I think you might be able to answer.‚Äù A dour foghorn bellowed in the distant sea fog, seagulls mocked the pulleys and metal rings, clanging against masts in the wind, and the salt in the air coated my tongue.

The fisherman furrowed his brow, ‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶ I know you.‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry?‚Äù

‚ÄúBythorne‚Ä¶ Bythorne, yeah,‚Äù he nodded. ‚ÄúYou were here back in November, weren‚Äôt you? Yeah, that was you.‚Äù It was. The research process for ‚Äò*Fishermen Lost at Sea‚ÄîOne Year Later,*‚Äô was tedious, to say the least. Folter fishermen aren‚Äôt the warmest bunch in town.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about, really I just need a short moment of your time and I‚Äôll be out of-‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt lie,‚Äù he scoffed. ‚ÄúYou interviewed Chuck and Bates last year. You wrote a paper on ‚Äòem. Ring a bell now?‚Äù

I nodded, ‚ÄúAh yes, that was me. Forgive me, I didn‚Äôt want to impose, I understand no one wants to be caught in their tracks by a *journalist*,‚Äù I chuckled, but his flat expression offered no conviviality. ‚Äú... But in all seriousness, it would really be a great help if you could answer just a few questions.‚Äù

He paused. The intermittent slapping of waves against the concrete seawall filled the silence, ‚ÄúWhat about?‚Äù

‚ÄúYour wife told me that you used to work at the Folter Psychiatric Institute.‚Äù He immediately turned with a laugh and raised a stocky middle finger. ‚ÄúOnly a few questions, please!‚Äù

‚ÄúFuck off.‚Äù

I paused, debating how far to take this. ‚ÄúSir, I think you may regret denying me this,‚Äù I shouted, prompting him to halt and scoff again.

He turned back and tilted his head, ‚ÄúYou threatening me?‚Äù

	I straightened up as he approached me. ‚ÄúNot threatening you. Warning you. You may have *vital* information which could benefit the town and its people greatly. *Please*.‚Äù

	He shook his head, chuckling, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what kind of answers you think you‚Äôre gonna find, but I really don‚Äôt have the time for this.‚Äù He turned again, and I followed like a loyal dog.

	‚ÄúCan you tell me anything about your experience there at all?‚Äù

	‚ÄúI worked there a dozen years ago, anything I tell you is old news.‚Äù He crossed a gangway onto a lobster boat.

	‚ÄúWhat about Doctor Kohler? Can you tell me anything about him? How does he treat his patients? His staff?‚Äù

	‚ÄúGreat. Doctor Kohler‚Äôs great,‚Äù he answered stiffly. ‚ÄúPatients are crazy, but he treats them well.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs it understaffed? How are patients‚Äô living conditions?‚Äù I halted, shouting from the dock.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre fine.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you know *anyone* else who might know something about the asylum?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. Now leave me alone and don‚Äôt ever talk to me again. Take it as a threat or a warning, I don‚Äôt give a shit.‚Äù

He stomped into the lower deck and I was left with an empty notepad flapping in the wind. The boat engine thrummed to life and passed the tip of the jetty before long, where a tall, skeletal, iron-framed red-lamp lighthouse moaned with the gulls.

  
  




I‚Äôd managed to interview several townspeople (people I was certain wouldn‚Äôt know that I‚Äôd been fired from the Folter Paper), however, gathering any solid information was as easy as sifting wheat from chaff. The few I suspected knew too much about the asylum and its secrets wouldn‚Äôt utter a word, and those who knew nothing special blathered on about all the aggressively common wives‚Äô tales that had long polluted the town.

*‚ÄòWell I heard most of the asylum‚Äôs actually empty, they only made it so big to scare people off. Who knows what they‚Äôre really hiding in there!‚Äô*

*‚ÄòGood luck finding anyone who‚Äôs ever left that place. Even Superintendent Kohler rarely leaves it*. *I‚Äôve heard some real evil stuff goes on in there.*‚Äô

*‚ÄòOh no, that's all just a bunch of lies, but I did hear Kohler chopped off his own finger to get out of fighting in the First World War. That, or his loony mother chopped it off before she died. And they were* close*, glued at the hip. He‚Äôs missing a finger, did you know that?‚Äô*



I returned home in weary defeat. I inattentively slipped a short stack of envelopes out of my mailbox and flipped through as I opened the front door. Boo greeted me, licking the sea salt off my shoes and wagging his tail as I noticed that one simple envelope had been sent from the Folter Psychiatric Institute.

I read the handwritten, blue ink note with a shaking hand and perspiration lathering my brow,



*‚ÄòMr. Wade Bythorne,*

1nvdnlz,https://www.reddit.com/r/vesperum/comments/1nvdnlz/the_pen/,The Pen,"I don‚Äôt even know where this pen came from. 

Honest.

I just found it one morning sitting on my desk, right between my keyboard and coffee cup. No packaging, no note. Just a pen. Heavy, polished, and old-fashioned.

At first, I didn‚Äôt think much of it. I wrote a grocery list, a couple to-do notes. It worked fine too‚Äîsmooth. Almost *too* smooth, like the ink already knew where I wanted it to go.

Later that night, I looked back at the lists I made and there were words I swear I never wrote. Small phrases, neatly tucked between the lines.

*‚ÄúThe floor remembers the sound.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúDo not look under the stairs.‚Äù*

*‚ÄùSleep cometh not.‚Äù*

Cometh not?

I laughed it off. Maybe I‚Äôd scribbled half-asleep. Maybe my brain was messing with me. But the handwriting, the handwriting was *definitely* mine.

After that, it got stranger.

Sometimes, when the house was quiet, I‚Äôd hear a faint scratching from the desk. Like the sound of a nib dragging across paper. And when I went to check, yeah, there they were. Words curling across the page in dark, deliberate strokes. 

Cursive now. And true.

The writing wasn‚Äôt random. It knew me. My fears, my secrets, things I never told a soul. The words bled out on the page before I even thought them, as if the pen burrowed inside my skull and wrote with my nerves instead of ink.

I tried to get rid of it‚Äîthe damn thing. I swear I did. I hurled it into the trash, the fire, the street. But every morning, there it lay upon my desk once more. Waiting. Watching. Gleaming with that vile, metallic luster.

And oh, how it whispers now.

Not aloud, no.

It trembles through the very wood of the table, hums behind my ribs, coils about my thoughts with the sweet, suffocating patience of a serpent. At night, the air reeks of parchment and ink. The walls seem to crawl with letters unseen. 

The scratching never ceases; scratch, scratch, scratch, like heartbeat that is not my own.

I begin to wonder with dread‚Ä¶

Have I ever been the writer? Or have I merely been written? For the pen‚Äôs strokes are my veins, its ink my blood, and each thought I claim as mine appears already etched, inevitable, ordained.

And tonight, it has carved into my very flesh these words, without my consent, yet with my hand.

*You‚Äôll never be published.*

I get up at 6Am, and at 7AM I'm behind the bar making coffee until 1PM, then I go to class and study when I can. I come home exhausted in the evening. I grab a quick bite, put on the washing machine, try to study for exams. I fall asleep fully dressed on the couch.

Last week, I even had a breakdown. The bar was packed, I was rushing around like crazy, and at a certain point, I felt dizzy, my hands were shaking, and I dropped a whole tray of cups.

I have no one to lean on. No one to turn to for help if I get sick, no one to pay my rent if I'm unemployed. Sometimes I wonder why I'm continuing, if it makes sense to bust my ass like this for a degree that who knows when I'll finish.

I'm writing here because I don't know who to talk to anymore. I don't want sympathy, but practical advice: how the f... do you cope? Has anyone been through this?

1nvdkdb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1nvdkdb/why_choose_insinkerator_f1000_water_filter_review/,"Why Choose InSinkErator F-1000 Water Filter Review for Cleaner, Better-Tasting Water?","The **InSinkErator F-1000 Standard Instant Hot Dispenser Under-Sink Water Filter Replacement** became a staple in my home kitchen setup over the past few months. As someone who values clean, great-tasting water, I put this product through its paces. While it delivered notable results, there are some aspects worth mentioning if you're considering it.

**Ease of Installation and Design**  
The twist-and-lock system is a lifesaver for those of us who dread anything involving plumbing. I managed the entire installation without calling a professional, thanks to the straightforward instructions. The compact size fits snugly under the sink, leaving ample room for storage. Its white plastic finish might not scream ""luxury,"" but it blends well with other kitchen components. However, I do wonder how well the material will hold up over time, especially in homes with hard water.

**Performance and Water Quality**  
This filter excels in removing unpleasant chlorine odors and taste, vastly improving my drinking and cooking water's overall quality. Even the pickiest member of my family noticed the difference in taste when making coffee and tea. That said, it's primarily focused on chlorine reduction and particulates, so if you're looking to filter contaminants like lead or mercury, you'll need to upgrade to the F-2000. The flow rate of 0.75 gallons per minute is decent but slows slightly as the filter nears the end of its lifespan.

[Check InSinkErator F-1000 price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b00dyiymzo/)

**Durability and Filter Replacement**  
I liked that the F-1000 is designed to last six months under typical usage. Over this period, I've noticed a gradual but expected drop in water pressure. Replacing the filters is a breeze‚Äîjust twist, remove, and replace. No mess, no fuss. Unfortunately, these replacement filters aren‚Äôt cheap, so budgeting a bit for ongoing costs is key. Also, the system automatically shuts off water flow when you‚Äôre swapping filters, which is a handy feature for avoiding unexpected leaks.

**Advantages**  
- Quick and intuitive twist-and-lock installation  
- Noticeable improvement in water taste and smell  
- Compact design, perfect for small spaces  
- Prevents mess during filter changes  

**Caveats**  
- Limited to chlorine and particulate filtration; other contaminants require upgrades  
- Replacement filters can be costly over time  
- A slight drop in flow rate as the filter nears its end  

**Target User for the Product**  
This filter is ideal for someone looking to significantly improve the taste and smell of water without an overly intricate system. It‚Äôs perfect for households reliant on instant hot water dispensers or those who don‚Äôt want to deal with advanced multi-stage filtration systems. However, if your water quality is poor or riddled with contaminants beyond chlorine, you might need more comprehensive filtration.

**Direct Competitors**  
Comparing this to the Brita and Culligan systems I‚Äôve used in the past, the InSinkErator F-1000 stands out for its simple installation, which doesn‚Äôt require constant monitoring or fiddling. Brita countertop filters, while great, take up valuable space and need more frequent replacements. The Culligan units are robust but involve more complex under-sink installation. Neither matches the F-1000‚Äôs seamless compatibility with hot water dispensers, a massive perk for tea drinkers like me.

**Cost Efficiency**  
While it isn't the cheapest option on the market, I found it to be a good representation of affordable quality. Its mid-range pricing aligns with what you‚Äôd expect for under-sink water filters. From a cost-efficiency standpoint, the potential savings on bottled water make it an economical choice over time. However, be mindful that the replacement cartridges might nudge your expenses slightly.

I understand the perception- ‚ÄúTexas is paying $20 million dollars for their roster, how can we compete?‚Äù Before we quit reading this and shake our fists at the sky, let‚Äôs go back to 2015 and look at college football.

The top schools in the country hoarded talent, recruiting the best players every year and hiding them on the bench until their 1st round NFL draft pick left. This was accomplished by coaches making between $10-15 million per year, showcasing $100 million plus facilities, along with their gigantic program budgets. WSU could never compete with this. It could never afford those operating costs, construction costs, or salaries, relegating them to the average tier of college football- essentially a caste system. And every once in a while when things would go perfect, they‚Äôd manage a 9-10 win season.

Fast forward to today. We are seeing schools compete at the highest level that have never before been consistently relevant. Vanderbilt, Iowa State, Texas Tech, Ole Miss, SMU, Indiana, Georgia Tech, Illinois, Virginia, Arizona State, Mizzou, Kansas, etc. Consistently at the bottom, or middle of their conferences every year with no real way to break out, are now competing for CFB playoff spots. 

NIL and the transfer portal have evened the playing field. Why go to Michigan and sit on the bench when I could start at Illinois and make NIL money? Teams cannot hoard talent anymore- they transfer where they can play. It‚Äôs not about the $12 million coach with the $150 million facilities, it‚Äôs about how much you can pay the player. Most, if not all, of the schools outlined above are highly competitive with average facilities, cheaper coaches, with $9-12 million in NIL per year.

There is no reason that WSU cannot take advantage of this, unless we as fans do not partake. The Cougar Collective is asking for $18.90 per month. The WSU Foundation offers tax incentives. The pathway is clear, and the opportunity is there. WSU can get better players than they ever have with NIL money. Don‚Äôt believe me? Look at the schools above. Don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs reasonable? Do the math. Of the 250,000 alumni, if 50,000 give $18 bucks per month, we have $11.3 million in NIL- up there with everyone else. No, we will not compete with the top 5 schools in America in spending, that‚Äôs not the point. The point is that we CAN be competitive, we CAN be better than we ever have, we CAN get great players, and we CAN make the CFB playoff. We just have to get out of our own way and contribute to the institution that we love. And frankly, at $19 bucks per month, or a bag of coffee, or a rack of Ol Crimson Lager, that‚Äôs pretty easy. We just have to want it. ",6,1759337194.0,wsucougars,11,0.8,False

I‚Äôll also keep things a little vague in case he ever comes across this. I‚Äôm(21F) just three months into my first tech corporate job straight out of college. Around the same time I started, an intern joined too. He‚Äôs been friendly, and with him plus two other new grads on my team, it‚Äôs been nice having people to bond with. Honestly, it‚Äôs made the adjustment to corporate life feel less intimidating and a lot more fun. I know people say not to get too close with coworkers, especially in corporate, but being cool with them has made work so much easier and less stressful. Also not too sure if this is important to the story, but I‚Äôm the only woman on my team, and having only men as teammates hasn‚Äôt really been a problem until recently.

The intern (45M‚Ä¶, he‚Äôs an intern but older, though he looks early-30s) started off making light jokes. At first, it was that I act like his 5 year old niece, and talking to me like a child. I can‚Äôt remember too many of his jokes, just that they were centered around me being a pouty 5 year old. I didn‚Äôt really care, and just always laughed. That‚Äôs pretty much how I am. Just a smile and laugh kind of person, and I fear that may have led me to this unfortunate position. Anyway, for the past few weeks he‚Äôs started joking about pushing me into bushes, and off the sidewalks. ‚ÄúCan I push you?‚Äù, ‚ÄúCan I throw you into the bushes?‚Äù, ‚ÄúCan I‚Ä¶.?‚Äù. At this point, you might think, ‚Äúwell that‚Äôs a little odd‚Äù, but I find everything funny so silly ole me would just laugh. However, yesterday we went out for a coffee walk, and grabbed lunch along the way. We chatted a bit about my religion and random things, then had about five minutes of silence.

‚ÄúCan I kill you?‚Äù

Hahaha‚Ä¶ what? It was a very quiet question and I really can‚Äôt explain what I felt, except that he seemed to genuinely be asking my permission. That there was a possibility, had I said yes, that he‚Äôd smile and carry out a plan as if I‚Äôd asked him to. So obviously, I said ‚ÄúNo you cannot‚Äù. I then asked if he thought about killing people often, to which he answered, ‚Äúyes all the time‚Ä¶ just joking‚Äù. Hmm. After a few more minutes we headed back, and while he steered away from that specific question, he found other ways to ask it. ‚ÄúCan I throw you off a building?‚Äù, ‚ÄúCan I push you into a river?‚Äù. Guys‚Ä¶is that funny? Am I missing something? Would my smiling and laughing all the time somehow warrant threats as jokes?

Fast forward to today, I kept my distance because I had a really weird feeling. He came to my cubicle, and sat on my side table begging that I go get coffee with him. I declined. He stayed for a minute, left, and then came back 30 minutes later. This time he didn‚Äôt really seem like he‚Äôd get up, so I said no, and showed him that my build was failing and I really couldn‚Äôt afford to delay my task. He kept begging, and I don‚Äôt know if I just have like some kind of killer senses, but I acted like I was texting someone, and turned on voice memo. And 30 seconds later, the quiet question came. ‚ÄúCan I kill you?‚Äù. And so I said ‚Äúcan you stop saying that? It‚Äôs really concerning..‚Äù, he paused, then said ‚Äúcan I murder you?‚Äù. 

So I got up and said I‚Äôd find one of my other coworkers so he could repeat what he just said. I took my phone with me, so I have the recording of the conversation up until he left me. He got up with me and said ‚ÄúI know where he is. Come with me so I can show you‚Äù. I said no, and turned around to go back to my desk and he finally left. 

Long story I know. I said I‚Äôd be vague but also wanted to paint a decent picture. Anyway, here‚Äôs my issue. He‚Äôs being really weird, but it‚Äôs been 3 months of jokes with him and my team. We go out to lunch together, rant about daily life, etc. So while my family says I should report him (since he didn‚Äôt stop after I said to stop), I‚Äôm struggling because‚Ä¶ what if it really is just a joke? And then what about my other male coworkers? Will they just see me as the dramatic woman who ruined the vibe? Maybe I‚Äôm young and don‚Äôt get how these things are meant to go but I‚Äôm scared of disrupting our little work family. I‚Äôm thinking of at least telling my manager, but I already complained about someone else a month ago for being too harsh. What if he thinks he‚Äôs babysitting a new grad that can‚Äôt handle her own problems? I know it sounds a little ridiculous, but does anyone understand what I mean? What would you do?

My whole family is in a completely different state and this terrified them beyond belief. I get it, and is the only reason I‚Äôve been heavily contemplating a report. ",10,1759337101.0,coworkerstories,50,0.77,False

For context she spends every waking moment on self care appointments to avoid taking care of her son. She hands him off to the nanny then immediately starts her day off by getting coffee every morning at Lala Land or Dutch Bros, massages, getting her hair, nails and sometimes hiring a glam squad to go to her house to do her makeup when she needs glam to shoot her Amazon hauls. She goes to Pure Barre or tennis lessons. Lunch with her friends. The only time she ever spends with him is when he‚Äôs strapped into the stroller while she goes on a 3 mile walk for an hour. Where she has two fans blowing on herself and no fan for her son. She also never puts sunscreen on that poor baby so he has been sunburnt the entire summer. When people called her out she doubled down and said he has a red undertoneüôÑ even though you could visibly see the trunk of his body was white while his legs, arms and face were bright red. She doesn‚Äôt cook in fact this week for the first time ever her words - she steamed vegetables not because she needed to feed her son but because she‚Äôs trying to detox. She ended up leaving the stove on after finishing up and burnt her pan up. 

There was a small scandal a few months ago with Moms On Call where she was claiming they advised her to leave her son in his crib for three hours during nap time to get him to nap whether he slept or not. Well he didn‚Äôt sleep. She was stupid enough to go on stories and ADMITTED to leaving him in his crib for five days straight (she‚Äôs left him in the cribs for hours before but this is the first time she said she‚Äôs done it consecutively).

1nvd9jx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Enneagram/comments/1nvd9jx/i_dont_understand_why_people_think_enneagram_8_is/,I don‚Äôt understand why people think enneagram 8 is rare,"On this subreddit? Probably, because most 8s probably aren‚Äôt into typology. Too abstract or introspective for most of them. I‚Äôd say most type 8s on this sub probably have a 4 or a 5 fix that makes them more curious about themselves and abstract theories. But anyhow, no I don‚Äôt think 8s are common here. 

But I really don‚Äôt understand the notion that enneagram 8 is a rare type. It‚Äôs probably a mix of things that make this subreddit the perfect storm for less 8s - apart from the reasons I‚Äôve already listed, most of you are American and I find that America doesn‚Äôt really encourage type 8 traits, it‚Äôs a very 3 culture.

But I think poverty‚Äôs a huge factor in exacerbating type 8 traits. All enneagram types are formed by trauma and a need for survival, it just so happens that poverty isn‚Äôt the only trauma you can have. Social isolation, overwhelm, no guidance, alienation, etc etc. but poverty seems tailor made to bring out type 8 traits.

Many pimps, gangsters, dealers, etc. have strong 8 traits. Dominance, rebellion, low disgust and inhibition, being good in high pressure situations. Are 8s more common in these roles? Probably. But it‚Äôs not just 8s - a lot of them are 6s acting like 8s because it helps with survival.

But it‚Äôs not just in these roles that 8s are common. Really, all I need to assume somebody I‚Äôm not super close with is an 8 is hiding sadness and fear, low shame, disgust, neuroticism, and inhibition, needs to be independent and respected by people around them (not respected as in admired, just showing basic respect), high physicality (doesn‚Äôt need to be a daredevil, can be as simple as needing good food, talking to strangers, exploring environment, etc. just some level of physicality), and quick to defend themselves against perceived attacks. That doesn‚Äôt sound so rare now does it? A person doesn‚Äôt have to party every week or get into fights or be a psychopath to be an 8. For some reason people paint 8 as a very extreme type.

For example, I‚Äôm an 8 that is far from the stereotype. I dress in kawaii fashion, I like abstract philosophy, I have a lot of emotional depth that I just happen to rarely share irl, I‚Äôve only been in a physical fight once, people have described me as kind, and I‚Äôm studying to become a psychiatric nurse. I‚Äôve had genuine mental health struggles that involved fear and sadness. Many of this is because I have an unusual tritype. 

But my defence mechanisms are type 8. I have quite the ego and am overconfident in myself. I snap quickly when someone disrespects me and don‚Äôt back off until they stop. Because of my sp dominance my physicality usually expresses itself through really wanting coffees, snacks, nice clothes, and nice weather (though I do like clubbing and certain sports too). My rage, though not often triggered, is like a tsunami destroying the person completely. I become sadistic. Sometimes I pick arguments for fun. Shame feels performative to me - I can probably count the number of times I‚Äôve felt true shame on my hands. And, most importantly, I want, more than anything else, to be strong and have fun.

So, yeah, in short, 8s aren‚Äôt unicorns. We‚Äôre ‚Äúnormal‚Äù people too, dum dums.",0,1759336803.0,Enneagram,22,0.5,False

I love kids, especially between 2-8 year old kids. I find them very cute, whenever there‚Äôs a friends child around I‚Äôm the one who‚Äôs playing with them, and I always thought I‚Äôd have 2 kids. My husband (30M) also wants kids - 4 of them to be exact. But this past 1-2 years I was super busy, we got married last year and I was really obsessed with the planning. After that we moved countries and that went on for a while. I also have a full time job, not enjoying work %100 but I always felt like I have a greater purpose to fulfill and I‚Äôm not there yet.

Last couple of months my husband started to talk more and more about having a baby, I think he‚Äôs ready. I also feel like I‚Äôm getting too old to start making babies because I‚Äôm not getting any more athletic or energetic. So with all this pressure I started to doubt my decision of wanting kids. My husband is amazing, we do everything together at home but his job requires him being away half of the time.

He is also willing to work less and take care of the baby if I can manage to make more income, but for now it doesn‚Äôt make sense financially. In fact he‚Äôs ok to be a stay home dad, if I can provide for us. Which is really sweet.

My issue is mainly that I recently started to be able to take care of myself. I have severe ADHD. I started to feel like a child is going to limit my life so much and not sure if I can handle that. Lately I had some days that I couldn‚Äôt even make myself get up and go to the kitchen to make a coffee. I don‚Äôt know how it will work out with a baby. I also have the feeling that there‚Äôs no going back once you have a baby and I‚Äôm scared to lose my identity.

I already feel like I lost some of my identity because of being 33 now, which is definitely problematic I‚Äôm aware.

Help me! I am so scared to not have kids and it was the wrong decision or vice versa. I also have this feeling that I want to see me and my husband‚Äôs combinations of genes, it‚Äôd be the cutest baby ever. And my husband would be the best dad ever!",1,1759336739.0,LifeAdvice,4,1.0,False

hey everyone, figured i'd share some parking advice for the georgia football classic coming up. trying to find a spot on game day can be a nightmare so hopefully this helps someone out.  
  
if you're trying to save money, there's some free street parking you can find. i usually head over to the streets around mitchell street by spiller coffee. it's about a 10-15 minute walk to the stadium, but it's free after 7 p.m. on weekdays. since the event is on a saturday, you'll have to pay for a bit, but it's way cheaper than the lots. just make sure you read all the signs really carefully because they sometimes put up temporary restrictions for big events.  
  
honestly, the official lots are expensive and getting out after the game is chaos. i've been using this app called Prked lately. it lets you rent someone's private driveway or garage right next to Mercedes-Benz Stadium. it's usually way cheaper than the official lots, you can book a spot in advance, and you skip a ton of the post-game traffic madness. it's a super short walk to the stadium.  
  
if you'd rather go another route, you have a few options. the official stadium lots like the red deck, blue lot, and home depot backyard are available, but you should definitely buy your pass ahead of time online using something like parkmobile. the lots usually open around 4.5 hours before kickoff. just know that some lots don't allow tailgating, so double check if that's part of your plan.  
  
traffic is going to be awful, no way around it. the stadium folks recommend using the waze app because it has all the game-day road closures programmed into it. trying to use other gps apps might lead you into a closed road. they close a bunch of streets and change traffic patterns, so it's a good idea to trust waze on this one.  
  
taking marta is probably the smartest move if you want to avoid driving altogether. you can get off at the gwcc/cnn center stop or the vine city stop and you're right there. it gets crowded but it beats sitting in gridlock for an hour after the game.  
  
a couple other things to watch out for ‚Äì be careful with unofficial lots and people flagging you down. also, there have been scams with fake qr code parking tickets downtown, so be wary of those. and whatever you do, don't leave your car overnight in an official lot because they will tow it.  
  
anyway, it's gonna be a great game. hope this helps you guys out.",1,1759336591.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

1nvd2v2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundTried/comments/1nvd2v2/find_out_if_the_best_coffee_maker_ninja_cfn601/,Find Out if the Best Coffee Maker Ninja CFN601 Lives Up to Hype,"Ninja CFN601 is a name that has been popping up in coffee conversations recently, so I decided to give it a try myself. As a self-proclaimed coffee addict and someone who appreciates a good espresso, I tested this machine extensively at home, and I'd say it's quite the intriguing option. From its barista-friendly features to some minor hiccups, here‚Äôs my honest take on this coffee maker.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The sleek design immediately caught my eye. The Ninja CFN601 is more than just visually appealing; it feels solid and well-constructed. Unlike some other machines that tend to wobble during use, this one stands firm. The black finish gives it a modern touch, and it doesn‚Äôt take up excessive counter space. Its adjustable cup tray is a practical addition, making it easy to switch between small espresso cups and tall travel mugs depending on the brew size. I tested this out with all kinds of mugs I had lying around‚Äîno spills, no awkward balancing acts.

**Performance and Brewing Experience**  
Testing the 19-bar pressure system was a treat. Whether I brewed a simple espresso shot or experimented with a few cappuccinos, the results were consistently rich and full-bodied. The silky crema on top of the espresso was satisfying every single time. I pushed the machine to its limits, using different espresso capsules and brewing styles, and it didn‚Äôt disappoint. With the ability to brew three styles‚ÄîEspresso, Lungo, and Over Ice‚Äîthe variety is a coffee lover‚Äôs dream. I even ventured into making iced espresso, which turned out pretty great on a sunny afternoon.

**Convenience and Features**  
What stood out most for me in terms of convenience was the built-in frother. Unlike those clunky additional tools you have to attach or clean separately, this frother is fold-away and adds little hassle. Whether I made cappuccinos, lattes, or flat whites, frothing milk felt almost effortless. Also, features like Delay Brew, Keep Warm, and Clean functions came in handy during my oblivious early-morning mumblings when all I need is caffeine to feel human. The storage bin for used capsules is another thoughtful touch, holding up to 20 capsules for easy disposal‚Äîit‚Äôs little details like this that elevate the experience.  

[Check Ninja CFN601 price on Amazon.](https://gogeary.com/p/b0b9yp76fn/)

**Key Benefits**  
- Sleek and modern design fits any kitchen style perfectly  
- Adjustable tray accommodates different mug sizes without hassle  
- Variety of espressos and coffee brewing styles keep things exciting  
- Built-in frother saves time and makes caf√©-quality drinks  
- Convenient cleanup with a used capsule storage bin  

**Limitations**  
Despite all the positives, there are a couple of spots where it stumbles.  
- The water reservoir could have been slightly larger for heavy usage days.  
- Espresso capsules are sold separately, and finding compatible ones locally can require some extra effort.  
- The machine gets a bit noisy during brewing, especially with repetitive use.  

**Rival Brands**  
Comparing it to other espresso makers, like the Nespresso VertuoLine, I‚Äôd say the Ninja machine gives you more flexibility. While the Vertuo focuses primarily on proprietary capsules and convenience, Ninja doesn‚Äôt box you into a single system. That said, the Nespresso units often work quieter and heat faster than their Ninja counterpart, especially in busy households. Breville's Barista Express might offer more advanced manual controls, but it‚Äôs on the bulkier side and might feel overwhelming to those who aren‚Äôt hardcore into espresso techniques. Ninja strikes a balance, providing versatility and simplicity without being intimidating.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Looking at its features, build quality, and versatility, the Ninja CFN601 is a strong competitor in its price range. While other coffee makers stick to either grounds or capsules, this one incorporates both, doubling its utility. If you‚Äôre really into coffeehouse-quality drinks without the daily caf√© budget, it‚Äôs a solid investment. There are, of course, trade-offs‚Äîmainly the reservoir size and slight noise‚Äîbut these are minor inconveniences in the grand scheme, especially for the quality you‚Äôre getting.

### Parse the Odds: Numbers Don‚Äôt Lie (Mostly)

Let‚Äôs start with the cold, hard cash of statistics. The bookmakers are all over this like kids in a candy store, and here‚Äôs the takeaway:

* **Newcastle United** is the favorite, with odds ranging from **1.89 to 1.95** (implied probability: **51-53%**).
* **Union Saint-Gilloise** is the underdog at **3.8 to 4.13** (implied probability: **22-26%**).
* The **draw** sits at **3.5 to 3.7** (implied probability: **27-28%**).

The spread? Newcastle is favored by **-0.5 goals** at most books, meaning they‚Äôre expected to win outright. For totals, the **Under 2.5 goals** is priced slightly lower (1.83‚Äì1.91) than the Over, suggesting bookmakers expect a cagey affair.

Union Saint-Gilloise‚Äôs recent **3-1 win over PSV** is a confidence booster, but Newcastle‚Äôs **2-1 loss to Barcelona** isn‚Äôt exactly aÊÉ®Ë¥• (though tripping over Barcelona‚Äôs shadow is a hazard for any team). The key stat? Newcastle‚Äôs defense has leaked just **1.2 goals per game this season**, while Union‚Äôs has conceded **1.5**‚Äîso the Magpies might have the edge in keeping things tight.

---

### Digest the News: Injuries, Lineups, and Shoelaces

No major injuries are listed, but let‚Äôs dig deeper:

* **Newcastle United**: After losing to Barcelona, their players are likely still processing the trauma of witnessing **Robert Lewandowski‚Äôs third-eye vision** in front of goal. But their manager, **Steve Cooper**, has a track record of grinding out results on the road‚Äîlike a coffee addict who‚Äôs never met a bedtime.
* **Union Saint-Gilloise**: Fresh off a **3-1 thrashing of PSV**, they‚Äôre riding high. But let‚Äôs not forget: **Belgium‚Äôs national sport is underestimating its teams** (see: Euro 2020‚Äôs ‚ÄúWait, Belgium *what*?!‚Äù moment).

The audacity though‚Ä¶ one morning I overslept and was 20 minutes late and he actually gave me shit for it. Like bro, you‚Äôre getting free rides every single day and you‚Äôre mad I wasn‚Äôt on time for your schedule?

He‚Äôs not the worst person in the world but he‚Äôs 100% the type who takes advantage the second you give him an inch. I‚Äôm losing my mind over this.

How do I shut this down without creating World War III at work?",201,1759336084.0,coworkerstories,147,0.95,False

I looked up sa website nila and sabi naman na it's manned and may cctv, but I'm still not very sure sa safety.

I (21F) just came back from a trip with my boyfriend (21M). We‚Äôve been together for 1 year. Something small happened, but it‚Äôs stuck in my head and I don‚Äôt know how to process it.

We were staying at a resort that had some stalls, including a little coffee shop run by a local man (35M). In the evening after swimming, we went there to get something hot. The coffee was made with jaggery, which my boyfriend didn‚Äôt like.

He tried it, made faces, and made comments about how bad it tasted (to me, but right in front of the owner). He asked for sugar, tried it again, and still made faces before asking where he could throw it out. It wasn‚Äôt a direct insult, but it was uncomfortable to watch.

Later, I told him I thought the way he handled it came across as inconsiderate. He said he hadn‚Äôt meant it for the owner, but admitted I was right and that he could have been more thoughtful.

We also accidentally forgot to pay in the moment. The owner didn‚Äôt say anything, but we went back and paid a few minutes later.

The whole thing keeps replaying in my head. I would have just quietly not finished the drink, but I can‚Äôt stop thinking about how differently we reacted to the same situation. I really like my boyfriend, but it left me feeling off.

My question is: how do I figure out whether this is just a small difference in how we handle frustration, or whether it says something bigger about compatibility/values? I don‚Äôt want to overthink, but I also don‚Äôt want to ignore my gut.

TL;DR: I (21F) and my boyfriend (21M, dating 1 year) had coffee at a small stall (owner ~35M). He disliked it, reacted strongly, and I felt uncomfortable with how he handled it. He admitted I was right afterward but didn‚Äôt seem concerned. I‚Äôm unsure whether to treat this as a one-off annoyance or as a sign of a bigger difference in values. How should I think about this?",2,1759336063.0,RelationshipIndia,4,1.0,False

1nvcwjm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nvcwjm,Can't hop out with an abandoned puppy covered in human shit.,"My roaddawg and I were seconds from hopping out, when suddenly as we were walking to the train, a starving tiny puppy covered in human fucking shit ran up to us. Just the thing ya need when you're tryna get out of town, y'know? Train is stopped, sun is rising, random tiny puppy is trying to jump all over us and our gear while reeking of shit but then flinching and screaming anytime we move towards it back... Good times (not).

So I used our train water and my soap to wash crusted fucking human shit off the puppy for an hour so it would stop getting it on us, and I gave him the rest of Bambi's food and water. Then I sat down and took this pic, realizing I was probably gonna have to try to re-home this baby over Facebook marketplace or something.

I took him back to near the hop out while my roaddawg grabbed more water‚Äîthen I wrapped him up and took another breather to accept how horrifying this situation is (I have severe OCD that's centered specifically around feces contamination). Also had an asthma attack. 

Suddenly realized in the midst of it all, I lost my fucking only power bank, my Brisk tea, my coffee, and probably other shit I haven't realized yet. Then suddenly, the older brother of the gas station employee that's been cool with us walked past our spot to go through the yard as a shortcut or something. We exchange ""hello""s, and my roaddawg shot the shot: ""Hey dude, do you want a puppy?"", which was met with an immediate ""no"".

I followed over there and tried  ""Well do know anyone who wants a puppy?"", explaining the situation. I explained that he was malnourished, eating shit and covered, alone, responding like he gets beat regularly, and we can't feed another mouth or train another dirty kid dog but we'll be stuck with him otherwise‚Äîmost of us on the road know what it's like to be abandoned, and therefore can't do it to another.

""How long are y'all gonna be here?"", he asked, to which we said:
""We were literally just trying to leave man... But I guess until this puppy's gone"".

There was a pause... and then:

""I'll be back for him at 2. I just gotta go to work‚Äîlet's exchange numbers"". I swear I almost cried. We exchanged numbers, he left, we realized the shit we lost including our sanity, and then about 20 minutes later... He returned‚Äîsix hours early‚Äîtaking the puppy.

Holy fuck. 

Roaddawg is passed out now, my lungs feel like they're full of battery acid, I feel disgusting and want a shower and laundry so fucking badly, I'm exhausted, have no power bank, sweet drink, water, or dog food for Bambi suddenly, and I'm still in this DAMN CITY after missing the perfect ride. I hope I don't stay here much longer though, it's already been too long.

But that puppy's got a loving human and a yard now, so I guess everything happens for a reason. Damn shit covered puppy... You suck. And I hope no one ever hurts or starves you ever again, you sweet and innocent naaaasty reature. To the original owner: sorry man. Not cool.

I got food poisoning a few days ago and got lucky to be hotel'd up with perfect timing by a stranger for the first time in a long time. Now I kinda wish it was now instead ngl... Cause ugh, yuck. I'm probably gonna pass the fuck out now and hopefully deal with all of this when I wake up. Sorry for any typos. Good morning. Don't abandon puppies please.",274,1759336000.0,vagabond,25,0.97,False
