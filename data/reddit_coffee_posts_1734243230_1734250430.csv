So we bought some snacks and coffee, and the next week when I walked there it was gone…literally it was NOWHERE to find, I remembered well where it was bc I remembered the cafe next to it (I planned to check it out on the next time I go there so I remember the name of it till this day) but the grocery store just DISAPPEARED.

=========

Good morning, Swansea! This is the Swansea Scoop. The local newsletter that’s like snuggling under a blanket to watch a classic Christmas movie 😊

The weekdays are a little quiet now in the run-up to Christmas, but there’s still loads to do!

In this week’s Swansea Scoop:

🎄 Muppets Christmas Carol concert!

😂 Jimmy Carr!

🎅 Big Christmas Paint Along!

… and tons more!

Let’s get to it.



🦢 Well… What did you think? 🤗

A big thank you to everyone who opened the first ever Wednesday edition of the Swansea Scoop this week!

In case you missed it, I shared a huge local guide to over 80 of the best shops and companies to find the perfect Christmas gift in Swansea. You can read it here: [https://www.swanseascoop.com/p/swansea-gift-shops](https://www.swanseascoop.com/p/swansea-gift-shops)

Even as I was putting the list together, I was surprised at the number and variety of great local spots in Swansea for Christmas shopping.

We might not have the big chains and department stores we used to, but there’s still a ton of fantastic local, family-run businesses that would love to welcome us all at this time of year.

Shall we all wrap up warm, prise ourselves away from Amazon, and make a day of it? 😊🎁☕🍰

Days prior, the reason why our plan was made in the first place was because her friends cancelled on their plans to eat at a local coffee shop and instead switched it with a plan for a drinking session, my girlfriend disliked drinking and I guess to fill in with their switched up plan I parred it up with our formerly cancelled plans to go out with her.

Fast forward to the day of the plan, I brought her flowers and was so excited I came early at our meet up place, she had a class prior so I made it a mission to, for once, be so early for her I came an hour before our meeting time additionally, I did not eat for the entire day so that I could par up with her appetite, see, she hates it when someone finishes their meal before her and I get full very quick so I have to have an appetite for heavy meals when I am with her. 30 minutes in, she chatted me that her friends changed their plans once again from a drinking session to a dinner to cater to my girlfriend's request.

Now I have no problems with her meeting up with her friends, in fact, I have been pushing her to bond more with her friends since her time is spent mostly on me, it was just that day was planned, and I was waiting for her. For the past 2 days I have also been pestering her about making sure that she really had nothing going on for that day since that plan that I proposed to her has also been replanned for three times already, it involved walking to a park where the christmas season is being celebrated in and I was not able to walk through it last year so I was looking forward to it today.

Fast forward to the day of the ""plan,"" since I was already in the place of meet-up, she insisted on meeting me before going to her friends, I agreed because I thought we will be, at the very least, eating at a coffee shop nearby to make up for cancelling our plans but then she texted me again if it will be okay for me to accompany her to walk to their dinner destination, agreed. But then 10 minutes came, my order came and she was not even there. This disappointed me so much I threw away the bouquet I brought for her and pretended my order did not arrive yet so that I have an excuse to stay at our meetup place.

She arrived, saying that her friends were already there so I told her to go without me since ""my order was not there yet"" she reluctantly walked away and when I saw that it did not even take her a single look back to check up on me, I proceeded to just go home. I know I am so petty for being mad, I even told her that I don't like her male friend and that she should cut him off because him constantly getting his face close to her did not bode me well.

How could I bring down my pride and make it up to her? I was being mean and it's true, it's only rare for her friends to include her in their plans and omit drinking from their plans. Please anyone tell me what I should do to make it up to her for being so mean",1,1734249280.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

1henv1f,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1henv1f,IB Thai in Imperial Beach📍🪼(South Bay Eats),"This is a small and affordable Thai place in IB with some respectable lunch offerings. I've been craving Thai food after trying it in Pacific Beach and I wanted some despite being down here near home, so I tried this place out for lunch on like a Thursday at 2:50 PM. I got myself the Chicken Pad Thai Lunch at spicy level 5, which comes accompanied with a salad covered in a type of peanut sauce, and 2 pork gyoza. Paired it up with some veggie rolls and my friend wanted her side of rice and we had a pretty hefty meal for only around 24 dollars with our drinks included. The service was also good as the guy was nice and patient with us which is always nice.

I have to say though, that I didn't love the Pad Thai this time and the chicken seemed a bit dry to me. The noodles were also not my favorite and I'm not really sure how to describe why they weren't but the flavor, texture, and vibe was just really not there for me. I also just didn't love the veggie rolls because they had a very mild but still underlying wrong flavor that you get like when you buy those make at home spring rolls and they just don't hit like they're supposed to. 

The lunch deals are cheap and the food isn't bad, but it's not the best Thai i've had here in San Diego (55 Thai is still king) and I can't say I recommend this spot. I'm gonna change the noodle types and I'll be back for a second calling maybe I just need some Pad See Ew, but I really made me sad because I wanted this Thai food to be bomb soooo bad. It's ok thought, they were still very nice and acocomodating, and they have boba so maybe i'll try that too and see what else they have to offer. Also some reviews have mentioned it but this is most definitely a togo focused kinda place, and they gave it to us in togo containers without forks, he was almost surprised we had sat down and wanted to eat it there. People are mean about the interior but hey it's just another small restaurant, but yeah they totally have that togo vibe going on. To sum everything up tho, DO GET the lunches if you can make it before 3 PM because the price makes it worth getting the food every time i mean mann just look at the leftovers I had. DO NOT get the veggie rolls I'm sorry I hate that they were bad but they were not good. And outside of that try this place out once especially if you can catch the deals but do come in with some lower expectations. And I would drop my spice down to like a 3 it's not that I don't like spicy but I'm big on you can always add, never take out and 5 was just a tad bit too spicy for me.

Seven months ago I  
started sitting with a different friend and their friends at school (we will  
call this person poppy 16). these friends included their partner, who we will  
call Nels 17, and two other people, one who i will just call Austen 16 and the  
other a girl who I will call Callie 16 now 17.

Now Austen and Callie  
were very good friend, i end up going on a date and starting a relationship  
with Callie. (to note Callie is transfem and Austen is Agender).

with all relationships,  
things happen. (it is still hard to come to terms with but here we are) i  
wanted to wait till i was 16 to have 'relations' but we ended up doing stuff  
after only a week. (to note this was before her 17th, she was 16). we continue  
like this for another 6 months. throughout of which i had asked if we didnt do  
anything because i have chronic pain, and 'activities' would put me in a lot of  
pain. these 'dry' patches never lasted long bc she would make me feel bad as  
she said it would 'hurt' because she was so horny. (there were some other  
issues that were raised that i thought were normal).

This was my first serious  
relationship, and Callie had just come out of a somewhat abusive relationships  
a few months prior with dating another girl in between the abuser and me. ( the  
last relationship for her the girl had groomed her and 'bred' a lot of the  
abusive tenancies into Callie which affected me).

Just before six months  
with Callie, i became very good friends with Austen ( to people in the LGBTQ  
communities we were Queer Platonic) of which i made to to check with Callie  
throughout that she was comfortable with it. she herself after coming out had  
had a rather large crush on Austen.

Just before seven months  
with Callie, i had had many conversations with her and we wanted to start  
dating Austen as a closed poly. while there was some issues that everyone  
talked though, i started to notice that Austen treated me better, i never said  
anything to anyone but it did upset me a little, partner of a few weeks treated  
me better than my girlfriend of seven months. 

more backstory due to  
Austens personal stuff they are currently staying in my spare room till they  
find other accommodation that isnt unsafe like their last residence (not with  
their mother, she is safe but lives an hours drive away) 

Now! to the breakup:

in my house we have these  
recliner chairs, Callie used to sit on them while i was on them and my mother  
asked us not to because she was worried they were going to break. This Tuesday  
Callie was messing around and got on it with me, after i had asked her to get  
off i tried to put the chair back but it wouldn't move backwards, I (very upset  
because not only would my mother not be happy since we were borrowing these  
chairs from my aunt, but because my chair no longer went back) was kind of  
upset and trying to fix my chair. i had turned over my chair and one which  
worked to see where the problem was. Callie was very insistent that she would  
fix it like she did, LAST time it did this (yes this had happened before) (also  
no the chair still wont recline even Austen tried to help me with it a few days  
after, back to the story). after a short while of both looking at the chairs, i  
figured out what was wrong and asked Callie to help me move the chair so i  
could get a better look at it, she did not. then after another five minutes she  
told me she had figured it out, after learning that I already new what was  
wrong she got annoyed asking why i didn't tell her. 

Austen arrived home to  
find me very upset and Callie kinda of ignoring me trying to fix the chair. my  
small dog, Athena (who Callie finds annoying and overstimulating) got veryyy  
happy at Austen getting home and jumped on/over Callie. this surprised her, and  
she twisted (while laying on the floor) and smashed her elbow onto my fingers  
and into the floor. since i was still upset about the chair, the pain in my  
fingers (which tingled for 10/15 minutes afterwards) made me more upset. i  
started to get angry as well as upset so i removed myself from the situation so  
i didnt say something mean to either of them ( backstory i had been to the  
dentist that day and was still had anesthesia in my system which makes me very  
moody and i have very low filter to what i say when having this, both Callie  
and Austen knew this days prior). 

after having removed  
myself, i sat in my room and started to calm down when Callie came in, she  
started to sit next to me and cry. By the way i was still very emotion and  
didnt really want to talk to her because i knew when im upset i have trouble  
containing my tone (which is why i remove myself to calm down). i tried my best  
to be nice but she said i was snappy and ended up just getting up and leaving,  
biking back to her house. 

Austen came into my room  
and just watched my till i calmed down and was ready to talk unlike Callie who  
tried to make me talk. i calmed down and jut ignored what had happened with  
Callie till that night when Austen came in again and wanted to see if i wanted  
to talk about it, ill be honest i cried a LOT that conversation. 

a few things i told  
Austen: 

1. i felt like i could  
never say no to callie

2. it was like i had to  
say what would make her feel better, i could never tell her how i felt 

3. how i wanted to wait  
till i was 16, and didnt get to.

4. how i felt like i  
couldnt say no to callie in the bedroom

Austen understood what i  
meant, and had been feeling similar about Callie, but not as much because i had  
had several months worth of it. they looked me in the eyes and told me it was  
abuse, something i struggled to come to term with, that Callie had been r\*ping  
me nearly the entire relationship. 

im not going to get into  
the next few days of just processing and talking to Callie, but eventually i  
told her i couldnt be in the relationship anymore. she wanted/wants me to wait  
for her to 'fix' it, to fix herself so we can try again. I loved her, i think i  
may still love her, and part of me knows she hurt me. right now one side of me  
loves her and wants to just put everything behind us and the other wants to not  
talk to her ever again. how do i meet in the middle? neither her nor i have  
anyone else to sit with at school so we have to at least be able to be  
friends/friendly.

i want to be her friend,  
so damn bad. we have entered into not quite friends, and told her we can work  
up to friends slowly, at my pace, i want the girl who didnt hurt me back and  
while she isnt here right now parts of me believe that she is there somewhere,  
right now we are doing fortnightly coffee visits in a cafe. she still thinks  
that we have a chance together once she quote 'fixes herself' but i think deep  
down i know thats not true.

I’m a 24-year-old man living in Gurgaon. For the longest time, I’ve been solely focused on work, striving to build a better life for myself and my family. My top priority has always been earning well, ensuring stability, and achieving professional success.

But in the hustle and grind of it all, I recently realized that I’ve been neglecting an equally important part of life – finding a life partner. It hit me that while work and money are crucial, love and companionship bring a balance that makes life truly fulfilling.

I’m still searching for love, and honestly, it’s not easy. It’s like rediscovering a part of life I had unknowingly ignored. But I’m hopeful and open to the idea of finding someone to share this journey with.

If you’re reading this and would like to grab a coffee sometime, it would be amazing. I’d love to meet someone who values both the grind and the joy of meaningful connections.

Feel free to share your thoughts or experiences too!

(I'm 17, and he's 19.)

A while back I received a follow request from this one guy. I didn't know him, but he did powerlifting, so did I, and we had a lot of mutuals. I accepted his request and I followed him back. I never thought of anything else from there. Until one day, there was this big WWE fight going on, and I was updating my Instagram notes about it, and he replied to one of them. I saw his reply, and we started talking about the match that had just played out. We were talking about everything, like how who could've done what, how we had bet on the person fighting, ect. But during that first conversation, I could have told that he was engaged in the conversation, and I had quite enjoyed it. It was now late in the night, and he had to go to bed as he was sleepy. I felt the same way. We said goodnight to each other, and he said ""talk more tomorrow?"" , followed by a ""You are really nice to talk to"". I thought about it and said ""Sure, of course"". That's how everything started.

The more we spoke to each other and got to know one another, we started realizing that we had a lot in common. From having the same music taste, to having almost similar childhoods, there was a lot to talk about. We spoke a lot about powerlifting as it is a sport we both did and enjoyed doing. And we also spoke about people haha, mainly the mutual friends we had. But honestly, there was never a dull moment when talking to him. He was (and is) honest, funny, respectful and so down to earth. I eventually found myself having a crush on him. 

This crush began to grow more and more. As we spoke, there were subtle hints that the feeling could have been mutual. Until one day, I just told him. And yes, it was indeed mutual. But it wasn't anything to act upon yet. Reason being, that we had never met yet. He lived in the other city. But the decision was made that he'd travel here to meet me. This was around the time we had study week for my exams. So, I decided to sacrifice a day to see him. We both decided that we would meet on my university campus, as it was the safest option (Students are still allowed to come on campus as they wished during this time as well). He had to lie to his boss, and call in sick from work so he would be able to come to my city. So that's what he did.

He arrived on my university campus, and he didn't know his way around the place. So he called me, and showed me where he was at. I laughed as he was all the way across campus. But I told
him that I'd come to get him. The walk to where he was was so nerve wracking. I was so excited yet so nervous. I walked and walked, and there he was. He didn't see me at first, but when he saw me, his face lit up and he immediately hugged me. He was smiling like crazy. I didn't expect him  to hug me so I was a bit in shock when he did. But I hugged him back. He then pulled away from the hug and he looked at me and smiled then hugged me again. Anyone could have told he was genuinely happy to see me. After all that, we just went walking around and we started talking, just like how we did in the messages. Nothing was awkward. He managed to make me laugh and blush a lot, just as he did online. 

I couldn't take my eyes off of him. He was so handsome. Of course I'd seen his pictures and his lifting progress videos, so I knew what he looked like. But just seeing him there, right beside me, it was crazy. We went to the student lounge where we spent most of our morning, we played some games together and talked a lot. We then left to go get lunch together. We had lunch and went back on campus. Hanging out on campus wasn't a bad idea, as there was always something fun to do. But yeah, we were playing a card game together, laughing at each other, and just enjoying each other's company. After the game, he took my hand and held it. I am a slightly awkward person, so I was literally saying ""oh my God, We're holding hands."" He laughed and said, ""yes we are"" and we just grew on each other more and more.

 He placed his arm around me, leaned on me, and places his head on my lap. When he did that, I was playing with his hair, and we were gazing into each other's eyes. I felt maternal instincts directed towards him. I wanted to protect him and keep him safe. I could feel my heart growing more for him. When looking into his eyes, I saw nothing but genuineness. When he got up, I told him this ""I want to kiss you so badly"". He smiled at me and he kissed me. That was the first kiss we shared. We did several times after that. We sat and talked more, until he had to go. We said our goodbyes, and that's how that day went. I felt so happy. We couldn't stop talking about the day when he got back to his city and back home. The more we spoke, the more he told me about his future plans. He was currently working as a bartender, and that he was looking to start university soon. After he graduated highschool, he just wanted to enter the job field to see what it was like. He had been in it for a year. He also told me that he wanted to study Marine biology when he did start university. I looked into the programs and their course outlines, and I saw that the first semester of marine biology aligned with the first semester of what I was studying (Pre-medical science). So, I informed him that when he starts I'd be happy yo help him out with whatever he needed help with. (It was my first semester at uni as well, going into my 2nd.) I was thinking about it as well, I had also really wanted to do marine biology, but I did pre-medical science just because I loved the medical setting. But I also loved working on the field, like at open sea, and to be in a lab setting. So, I spoke to my parents about it, and they said they would support me in whatever decision I decide to make. So, I sent in my program change application. Now I am studying something I love, and that I'd also be able to help him out with his studies.

He was grateful for me offering to help him out. Furthermore, he was gonna move here to my city when he did start uni. I was happy for that. But also, that means that he was gonna get a job as well. So one day, I was on Instagram, on stories, and I say this vacancy for a bartender. It was for a restaurant in my city, and one that's really close to my house. I sent it to him, and he applied. He was given an interview and immediately was given the job. He told me this information, and I was so happy for him. I didnt think that this would have been happening so fast. I was already thinking about a possible future I could have with him. But before he could start working here, he had to send in his resignation letter to his then current workplace. He did that, and began helping out the other guy that was gonna take his spot. He had about a week left there. The time had flied. It was the day he was going to come to my city for his first day. I really wanted to see him again. So, I waited till after he was done with work, and I walked over to the restaurant to get him. When he saw me again for the first time in a while, he almost ran to me, and hugged me again. I hugged him back. We then started walking to a café together to get a coffee. We got our stuff and we sat and spoke, and had a really nice time. We spoke about his day, and what this new job will be like for him. He was worried as he wasn't sure as he would be able to take his new schedule. The maternal instincts kicked in again. I wanted to be there for him, and help out with anything he needs. I told him this, and he smiled at me. But it was one of those ""thank you"" smiles, if you know what I mean. We continued talking more, and he had to go as he needed to catch the bus to go back to his city. We hugged again, and kissed goodbye, and I watched him leave. We called later that night, and just spoke more about anything. So it has been for a while. I go to see him at work sometimes, and we talk every day. I can feel myself falling in love with him, if I'm not already, haha. I just have these feelings; that I'd do anything for him. He is so precious to me, and that I just really want to keep him safe. I really do care about him deeply, and I'm so happy to accept him as he is. When I think about my future, I don't envision it with anyone else but him.  He's so sweet, kind, respectful and he goes out of his way to do nice things for me. I know that we're both young, but what do you guys think? Do you think this is something that could be/is genuine?",1,1734248605.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

Also is not proof reading and written by someone who is dyslexic.

Seven months ago I started sitting with a different friend and their friends at school (we will call this person poppy 16). these friends included their partner, who we will call Nels 17, and two other people, one who i will just call Austen 16 and the other a girl who I will call Callie 16 now 17.

Now Austen and Callie were very good friend, i end up going on a date and starting a relationship with Callie. (to note Callie is transfem and Austen is Agender).

with all relationships, things happen. (it is still hard to come to terms with but here we are) i wanted to wait till i was 16 to have 'relations' but we ended up doing stuff after only a week. (to  note this was before her 17th, she was 16). we continue like this for another 6 months. throughout of which i had asked if we didnt do anything because i have chronic pain, and 'activities' would put me in a lot of pain. these 'dry' patches never lasted long bc she would make me feel bad as she said it would 'hurt' because she was so horny. (there were some other issues that were raised that i thought were normal).

This was my first serious relationship, and Callie had just come out of a somewhat abusive relationships a few months prior with dating another girl in between the abuser and me.

""Luckily I came with a cart, hit him with a cart, and then from there we just started fighting. He bear-maced me, we rolled around on the ground for a little bit and I held him until the cops came,"" said Grant.

The scuffle was caught on the coffee shop's surveillance camera.

Another customer even stepped in to help, and Grant held the man down for seven minutes before police arrived.

San Francisco police said the man is 42-year-old Amir Moner of Concord. He was booked into the San Francisco County Jail for attempted robbery and other charges related to this incident, as well as active warrants for other counties.

""I’m a little sore this morning. I’m still coughing out bear mace. But I’m good,"" said Grant on Saturday morning as he was back at work making coffee. ""I’m not going to let anybody like that stop me from doing what I love.""

Some customers noticed the small cut on Grant's head, one even gave him a hug. Another customer, who works at the Black Heart tattoo shop down the street, came in to show support after seeing the video on social media.

""I think it makes you happy that there’s someone who cares about someone who could’ve been a stranger to him, his backpack or whatever it was. I think that’s pretty cool,"" said Alejandra Ramirez.

Grant said he has a background in security and combat training, so he was able to step in. He said that unfortunately, crime like this isn't new in this neighborhood, and they have had a bad history with police response times.

""I’m just happy I was there. You know it’s one of those things that folks can look away in certain situations, or you can have the moment to act, and I want people to feel more empowered to act,"" said Grant.

I unfortunately caught a cold a few days before we met and was still not 100% during our date, but despite feeling like I may have come across as a little aloof due to my sickness we still had a good time and set up another date later that week at the movies. This date went much better in my opinion. We got on even better than the last date and I felt good going out of it until when we where parting ways she starts telling me that her schedule the following week was gonna be really busy due to finals and that the week after that she was going home for the holidays. I made an exaggerated frown in a joking way when she told me which she responded to by saying we could still see each other one more time on the following Tuesday (we saw the movie on Friday). I said I was down and to text me so we could work out the details and we parted ways. Didn’t hear from her again that night or well into Saturday, but through our entire time talking she always did take awhile to respond to texts, sometimes even a full day would go by without me getting a response. I was slightly surprised though that she didn’t reach out because after our first date she texted me within an hour saying she had a good time. Instead I texted her that it was great seeing her last night and I was still down to do something on tuesday if she was. She said that would be nice and asked if i wanted to go ice skating, I said yes and after ironing out the details we set to meet at 7:30. I didn’t hear from her on Monday and neither did i reach out because i was busy working, but when Tuesday rolled around she hits me with a text saying she’s sorry but she has to cancel because she needs the extra time to study. This was two hours before we were supposed to meet. I’m a textbook over thinker so I started going through all of our interactions in my head trying to see if maybe I had over estimated her interest in me. Maybe i over analyzed a tad bit but i came to the conclusion that the language she used in her texts came across as more her being polite and indulging me than her being actually interested in me. so after about 30mins i responded saying i understood and wished her good luck on her final. in my head i thought that if she really wanted to see me again she would respond asking if we could reschedule to a later date. She didn’t. all i got was a ‘thanks!’ in response. at that point i kind of resigned myself to thinking it was over and that i shouldn’t reach out again. I got busy with work the next two days, but i kept thinking about all our interactions and started to think maybe I should reach out one more time just to be sure. because while her texts seemed one way, I felt like we actually had a good amount of chemistry in our interactions in person. Unfortunately I had a serious family emergency happen and was really busy with that the last couple days which brings us to now, 5 days since she last texted me.

honestly I still feel like i made the right read and that i shouldn’t reach out and probably just leave it alone, but part of me thinks that maybe she is just as confused by my lack of communication as well, and that maybe she thinks I moved on because i was mad she cancelled or something.

I’m also very new to dating because my prime socializing years were stolen by covid lockdown and a couple years spent wasting away in construction post-lockdown so I feel like I need some advice from strangers on what i should do lol.

1henknw,https://i.redd.it/m3001kj6ty6e1.jpeg,My humble collection of 6mo,"I have always loved frags but got into the game 6 months ago. 

Here, it begins 
1. Velvet oud - open up citrusy and a bit woody, the leather comes around 30min later, its a mild but comfortable leather (not too synthetic, not too wet) and from there on it’s kind of linear, nothing else. 
Projection: 1hr 
Longevity: 6hrs on clothes
* I’ve only recently gotten it, I’m sure these numbers are gonna improve after some maceration.

2. Dumont Nitro Green - it’s a very youthful powdery frag, if you’re a teen you’re gonna love it, but definitely not one of my favourites. It’s sweet (but not too sweet, kind of well balanced), woody, floral and powdery. Can be used for workplaces, a good all weather scent. 
Projection: 2hrs
Longevity: 8hrs on clothes 
*good performer 

3. Khamra Qahwa- I’m assuming most of you know it by now. Its smells like sweet date(khajoor) syrup, I don’t get any hints of coffee tbh, not even in the dry down as they usually say. But this thing is seductive af, perfect for cold winter nights.
Projection: 3hrs
Longevity: 12+ hrs on clothes 
*A beast for sure 

4. Raghba wood intense- sweet, very smoky and woody Its like sitting in front of a fireplace where agar wood is being used as the fuel, roasting marshmallows and the smoke from the fire is blowing right at your face.
Projection: 4hrs
Longevity: 24hrs on clothes 
*the most powerful perfume in my collection so far

5. Adidas Champions league Arena edition- 
Aquatic, fresh, sweet, citrusy. A freshy, good enough for gym.
*performance and longevity are shit, its an edt so we better not talk about it

6. Ajmal zeal- a citrusy Sauvage clone, begins citrusy but drys down to a near perfect imitation of the daddy.
Projection: 1-2 hrs
Longevity: 6hrs
*it’s quite unpredictable, sometimes it performs good sometimes it doesn’t.

7. Whisky Smoke: sweet, leathery, dark. I simply love the scent profile on this one, I honestly don’t care about the performance. It’s like a sweet n dark barbershop frag, excellent for its price. 
Projection: 30-45min
Longevity: 5-6hrs
*It’s a ritual for me to put it on after shower🙂‍↔️

8. Whisky Smoke Bourbon: a less sweet, more floral and dark leathery version of the OG, ots just like they took the OG and made it more masculine and better at performance.
The leather in this one is extremely prominent, it definitely isn’t smooth but thank god somebody managed to imitate TF Tuscan Leather at such prices, it’s not a clone but definitely has the Tuscan Leather DNA in it, a great value for money.
Projection: 1 1/2hrs
Longevity: 6-7hrs
*a good performer, won’t let you down 

9. Skinn Raw Instinct- my favourite the collection so far. Open up citrusy, dries down to spicy, cinnamon and cardamom after 2-3 hrs and is linear from there onwards. A smooth n soft blend, it’s got absolutely no sweetness, perfect for workplace environments, an all weather perfume. Excellent masterpiece by Skinn Titan.
Projection: 3hrs
Longevity: 8-9hrs
* it’s the best, I don’t know what else to say.

Feel free to criticise, and also don’t forget to recommend me some amazing frags, I’ll definitely buy the one with the most likes and update you guys on this sub!!

1henikl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1henikl,Today at work: Audi RS6,"Also wrote a text that’s converted from Dutch into English with Ai, so the title and some other thing don’t really translate well: 

Fast, versatile, but above all, heart-pounding... Meet the Audi RS6 Performance.

Exterior

When it comes to the exterior, this RS6 really needs no introduction. Finished in the iconic Nardo Grey, and, of course, fitted with 21-inch performance wheels. Exactly the spec we love to see on an RS6. As the cherry on top, it’s equipped with the black optics package, featuring black side mirrors and tinted windows, which really completes the overall look!

Interior

As soon as we step inside, the stunning Valcona leather sport seats immediately catch the eye. The RS honeycomb stitching perfectly captures the essence of this segment: a high-quality finish with a clear focus on sportiness. Even better, these sport seats come with all the comforts and conveniences, such as a memory function for the driver's seat and seat heating for both the front and rear seats. The exclusive finish continues with small details like leather/Alcantara door panels, a flat-bottomed sport steering wheel, and subtle aluminium quattro and RS badges.

Driving Experience

When starting off in Comfort mode, the RS6 delivers exactly what you’d expect from a brilliant grand tourer. A calm and refined driving experience where the V8 remains subdued, quietly humming in the background. Thanks to the adaptive sport suspension, there’s almost no compromise when it comes to ride comfort. Everything feels effortless, ensuring that you can always arrive at your destination fully relaxed.

But what if you're not in the mood for comfort and just want to have fun with a car that has a truly raw character and offers pure driving thrills? Well, that’s exactly what happens when you press the Drive Select button and the magic word ""Dynamic"" appears on the screen. You feel the V8 biturbo wake up, the suspension tightening its muscles, and the throttle suddenly becoming incredibly responsive. Push the accelerator to the floor, and the gearbox quickly downshifts, overwhelming you with the sheer power the RS6 has to offer. Push even harder, and you're once again surprised by a jolt in your back as the tiptronic transmission swiftly and aggressively shifts to the next gear. It's also reassuring that you can come to a complete stop in no time, thanks to the highly praised ceramic brake system. Subtle? Not anymore. But it’s pure enjoyment for any true fan of super wagons.

Our Conclusion

All in all, the RS6 C7 is a true all-rounder, offering everything we ""enthusiasts"" look for in a daily car: space, comfort, but above all, an immense amount of driving pleasure. Are you already getting excited about this RS6? Ask our sales advisors about the available options, or just visit us at our showroom in Veenendaal – the coffee is ready!

Stormed all day and high winds closed the mountain down early. My girlfriend, buddy and I were drinking coffee upstairs, above the bar,  looking at the mountain and closed lifts. Most people were gone at that point but a few skis and boards were in the racks outside.  We watched an employee, in their full snow kit, knock a board off a rack and kick it a few times till it slid a ways away. A few minutes later another employee in full snow kit ran over smiling and kicked a bunch of snow on it. We thought it was a fun bit they were playing on a buddy or something until a little later a lady kept doing circles around the ski racks and looked confused. At that point I realized what was going on and walked down and told her where the board was and she walked over and dug out her board. She had no affiliation with the guys at all and was pissed. Was super shitty to see happen, especially because both dudes were employees in full palisade snow kits. Stay vigilant out there ",15,1734247352.0,snowboarding,1,0.94,False
1hengi7,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1hengi7/please_help_me_to_actually_enjoy_family_christmas/,Please help me to actually enjoy ‘Family Christmas’,"Obligatory throwaway - long time lurker, first time poster, sorry for the long story to provide ‘enough’ context TLDR at the end.  
  
I’ve learnt a lot from the community here over the last few years, that I’m not alone and some vastly improved vocabulary to describe and unpack my experiences.  
  
Thank you all for that.  
  
I’ll start by saying I’m okay, we’re happy and financially secure with stable housing, my partner and I are great emotional supports for each other. I do not depend on my estranged parents for literally ANYTHING, so they have ZERO power here and I have no fear of any repercussions from them.  
Perhaps I still fear damaging my chance of a healthy future relationship with my siblings?  
  
As per the title I’m posting to ask for advice, as I’ve tentatively agreed to be at the same social event (<8 people) as my birth givers soon for ‘Family Christmas’.  
  
I’m a lot less emotionally connected to ‘what could have been’ these days, and think I may enjoy the opportunity to speak my peace and/or disturb theirs?  
  
Context  
Growing up:  
My nuclear family had zero conflict resolution skills.  
Whoever mentioned a problem WAS the problem, because if you just ignored everything then nothing was wrong.  
Parents emotions > facts, ‘You made me feel bad, therefore you are did something bad’.  
  
Two siblings. GC is the flying monkey, the other grey rocked the entire world and doesn’t acknowledge their emotions, even internally as far as I can tell, just to drift through life.  
  
Recent past:  
My parents are comfortably retired and have no significant obligations on their time that I am aware of.  
  
In 2020 I’d been LC with NMom / EDad (NDad?) since having kids, but that’s a story for another time.  
  
Partner and I had a toddler and a newborn at the time  
Our house flooded – annoying but fully insured.  
COVID hit  
Insurance denied claim, because reasons.  
Work unstable and eventually let go due to COVID.  
9 Months fighting the insurance company to avoid financially crippling consequences.  
The 4 of us, locked down in half a house, whilst the other half grows toxic mold during a respiratory pandemic.  
  
Throughout the year I made half a dozen requests to catch up 1 on 1 with EDad, all rebuffed with nonsense.  
  
Near the end of 2020, I’d just left an appointment with medical professional who suggested I start medication for depression. During the appointment they had asked several times if I had family support.  
  
I just kinda went FUCK IT, I SHOULD HAVE FAMILY SUPPORT. So I called EDad and told him I’d be at the park near his house in 20 minutes.  
He arrived and I poured my heart out for 4-5 hours and begged him to call me weekly just to talk, because I wasn’t coping well with the lack of control I felt I had over my life at that point in time.  
  
\*12 Months later\* I invited EDad back to the same park to ask why he hadn’t even called me ONCE.  
Unbelievably, (or perhaps predicably?) He came out swinging for the fences verbally/emotionally with a list of everything I’d done wrong, in particular to NMom.  
I defused him with a ‘Hypothetical’, along the lines of – you meet a stranger, they are struggling and asked their father for help, their father did not contact them for 12 months, who is in the wrong? –  
  
He started calling once a week, talked mostly about the weather – but hey it’s a start.  
I was still desperate to have the parental relationship I imagined, having not yet acknowledged it wasn’t something my parents are capable of.  
Around 10 calls in he lied about something, something trivial but easily provable, for which I written documentation to the contrary. I came at it obliquely a few times over \~5 minutes, giving him ‘outs’ and the opportunity to revise his statement whilst saving face.  
Even though it was just the two of us on the phone, he doubled down at every opportunity. Eventually I came in directly with “Why did you lie?” and he literally ran through the narcissists prayer in order, voice growing louder progressively as I calmly called BS on each point. At the start of “*And if I did, you deserved it.”* His tone hit the low end of ‘yelling’ so I hung up on him, having endured more than enough disrespect.  
  
That was the last time I spoke with EDad, in early 2022, we’ve been in the same room 3 times since that I recall – which I’d describe as frosty.  
  
Early 2024 I tried the same thing with NMom, had a coffee with her for an hour and a half.  
I hadn’t tried this path earlier because I estimated very low odds of success and didn’t have spare energy to pour into a black hole.  
Highlights include that she had suffered horribly and has been the world’s best martyr, putting her own needs last so that I could “have a good relationship with my father”, who hadn't spoken to me in two years?  
I updated her on some aspects of my life, and made a firm and clear boundary that she will not see my children unless she puts the work in to repair our relationship. I also made it clear that I will not be initiating anything, if she wants our relationship to improve she’s (they?) have to do the leg work.  
  
In hindsight she treated the entire interaction as an intelligence gathering opportunity. Milking as much information as possible, whilst sharing essentially nothing other than attempts at emotional manipulation and crocodile tears.  
Whatever she reported back to EDad probably bore no resemblance to what I actually said, as his vibe was noticeably more hostile next time I was in the same room as him.  
  
A few weeks later she sent a text about literal ‘low hanging fruit’ in her garden. Avoiding the obvious hook I responded about the fruit in my garden. Eventually she broke first and said it was obviously an invitation for the grandkids to pick them, not missing the opportunity to undermine my intelligence at the same time for bonus points.  
  
Not the interaction I was hoping for, but the silver lining here is - this was the first time I did not JADE, just held the boundary firm.  
  
“NO”  
  
Was a complete sentence, She hasn’t reached out since.  
  
For some reason (lingering FOG?) I had still been making a token attendance to ‘Family Christmas’ each year with the partner and kids. It is no longer on Christmas Day due to my insistence.

Neither myself or my partner have received a Christmas gift from them for the last three years, which is fine in isolation as I don’t need anything from them, not so fine in the context that GC and +1 get lavish several hundred dollar gifts each, every year. So it becomes obvious deliberate public disrespect… “fool me once…”, I’ve apologized to my partner for making them endure that, multiple times.  
Our kids have received toys that I presume were rejected as donations at the thrift shop, dirty stuffed animals with parts missing that they were genuinely afraid of. My favorite was the ‘incomprehensible object with no known purpose’, Child was super confused after receiving it and started with the obvious questions; ‘What is this?’, ‘How does it work?’, ‘What does it do?’ None of which could be answered by the gift givers.  
  
So recent years have demonstrated to me that I don’t need parents, I’d still like some, just not the ones I was born with.  
  
I’m confident this year they are expecting unregulated access to my small humans (who are their only grandkids). That isn’t on the table, as they were explicitly told they won’t see them at all unless they put the work in to repair their relationship with me.  
The kids have no idea who they are, so no loss there.  
  
I’m planning to go alone. And I’m not really sure what I want from this… as I’ve dropped the rope.  
  
Blow up their ‘happy family’ vibe and expose them?  
Make them answer pointy questions with an audience?  
Try to break some of GC’s enmeshment so that I can have them back in my life?  
Just make the event uncomfortable for them?  
Enjoy the social experiment?  
Add some more ludicrous quotes to the collection for my partners and I to laugh about over a drink?  
  
For some reason I’ve not shared even the above level of detail with my siblings.  
Attempts with small doses were met with excuses made on parents behalf or gentle apathy.  
I suppose it has to do with us being hardwired on some level to protect my parents fragile and volatile emotions and self-image.  
  
*Whatever I do, I know I’m doing it for my peace of mind and my own nuclear family.*  
*With the expectation that nothing will change. If my birth givers were capable of accepting responsibility, self-reflection or introspection, then changes would have been made long ago.*  
*I suppose I’m just not sure if I’m charging in valiantly to fight the last battle of the doomed crusade, or slinking in to watch the monkeys run the circus and eat popcorn.*  
  
My partners thinks that I should go in there, ignore the parents, be overly jovial and enjoy the company of my siblings. And that I shouldn’t accept presents from my spawnpoint for the kids.  
  
This has been cathartic to write, if you made it this far thanks for reading.  
  
\*\*TLDR\*\* Estranged from parents, enmeshed EDad is incapable of being wrong and therefore incapable of growth. NMom is the victim, who appears incapable of rational thought processes or human emotions. I’m completely independent with my own kids. If I choose to see them over the holidays, what should I say? What should I expect? What would you do?",2,1734247290.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

Enter the BUNN BX Speed Brew Classic 10-Cup Coffee Brewer. I was drawn in by the promise of a super quick brewing process, and yep, it really holds up to that claim.



Initial Thoughts



Unboxing this bad boy, I found myself appreciating the sleek black design. It’s got that sort of understated elegance that doesn’t scream “techy” but sits nicely on any kitchen counter. Setting it up was pretty straightforward as well, and to be honest, I'm not usually good with stuff like that without calling in backup from a tech-heavy friend.

Curious about the price? [See it here.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/product-reviews/brewing-perfection-bunn-bx-speed-brew-classic-review-b000ffilroi/)

Coffee-making Experience



Getting down to business: the brewing. I was honestly impressed by how fast this thing works—about 3 to 4 minutes, and you’re good to go with a whole pot of 10 cups. I tried it on an easy-going Sunday and was sipping my coffee well before my lazy dog had even thought about venturing out for his morning stroll. It was about time my kids commented on something other than video games; they mentioned how the coffee smelled better than the usual. Even my neighbor, who dropped by to return a borrowed gardening tool, mentioned the aroma was heavenly and tasted like ones from those fancy coffee shops.



However, there are Downsides



But of course, it's not all sunshine and unicorns. A couple of things that came up include the not-so-ideal water reservoir situation. You can't detach it to fill it up, which means you have to pour water in carefully. Also, if you’re someone who loves freshly ground beans, note that this doesn’t have a grinder. So, you might want to look into a separate grinder for that fresh taste.



Looking at Other Options



When you compare it to something like the Keurig K-Elite or the Cuisinart DCC-3200, the BUNN stands out for close-to-instant coffee and simplicity. You don’t get the same versatility as the Keurig’s pods or the programmability of the Cuisinart, but if speed and a no-fiddle process are what you’re after, then the BUNN has you sorted.



Value Check



Price-wise, it's alright. It won’t gobble up your budget but it's not dirt cheap either. On the bright side, since it’s pretty energy-efficient and seems well-built, you look like you’d save in the long run if you make multiple pots of coffee a day like I do.



That’s my take on the BUNN BX Speed Brew Classic 10-Cup Coffee Brewer. If quick and uncomplicated coffee is your thing, it’s defo worth pondering over. Just be ready to work around the water reservoir and get a grinder if you love fresh beans.",1,1734246488.0,TastefulCoffee,0,1.0,False

I’m heading to Sandals Ochi in August. We were incredibly lucky and got our Club level garden honeymoon room for a week at just over $3,500 (including flights) during early August. We didn’t know it was around their Independence Day, but are willing to give it a go. We are both frugal people but wanted an enjoyable, stress free honeymoon. We compromised on this, and are very excited but concerned. We love outdoors and are both foodies so this seemed perfect between the forest, blue mountain coffee excursions, and all of the different restaurants they offer. However, we keep hearing mixed reviews ranging from cockroaches in the rooms and rude staff, to wonderful rooms and great service. There seems to be no middle ground. Would anyone who has been within the last year or so mind leaving your experience so I can appropriately manage my expectations? Also, any experience or advice around Jamaica’s Independence Day would be welcome. Thank you! ",1,1734245820.0,SandalsResorts,0,0.99,False

I know it's a bad idea. I kinda used to hook up with a coworker back when I (27f) was 21 because everyone's gotta make that mistake at least once, right? It definitely could've ended worse but it was a lot of social navigating I didn't care for, and too risky for my taste. So when I started working at a different company in an unrelated field, I avoided every advance like the plague. I'm not a very flirtatious person nor do I seek out sexual companionship often if ever. 

About a year ago we hired someone (41m) that caught my eye, unlike the other people at work who have tried taking me out several times. I didn't even know he was as old as he was, I legit thought he was like 35 lol. This new coworker (we'll call John) made a few passing advances towards me that I shut down knowing that I didn't want to be involved with someone I work with. Especially now that I'm establishing an actual career and plan on being in the industry long-term. He works in a different department than me, makes the same as me, and doesn't have any power or tenure over me at this job. It's a different dynamic than I had been in before but I still was too afraid to risk anything. 

We had a company party in the summer where afterwards a few of us went out for drinks at a bar. John and I flirted a bit (I got drunk and couldn't stop talking to him or wanting to be close to him) but it was hard to read how he felt about me. I rejected his previous advances because of my past experiences, so there was no way he still was even interested right? I'm younger, and without getting into details about my personal life, have a hard time relating to people my age with the amount of responsibility/life experience I have. I connect easier with folks who are older than me and I was feeling comfortable with John. I don't date men typically, and none of the men or women I've been with have ever even been more than 7 years older than me. So the dynamic felt comfortable but very different for me. We have a lot of the same interests (I have an older sister his age who raised me with her interests) and have very similar morals. I genuinely feel so validated whenever I voice an opinion or feeling around him. I can't even tell you if I've ever felt that around someone. 

When he looks at me his entire face smiles. Like, behind his eyes and everything. I feel like I can see light radiating underneath his skin when he smiles at me. It's unlike anything I've ever seen or experienced. He's quiet but listens to me so intently, and remembers everything I say. I've never had anyone look at me like that before in my life and it haunted me for months after that company party. A month ago he made a comment to me after I had a medical emergency and missed work that has stuck with me since he's said it. I have been thinking about him nonstop. I don't think I ever had a 'crush' like this when I was a kid. 

I broke this past week and finally asked him out for coffee. He stared into my soul while I ADHD rambled for hours and just kept telling me how amazing I am. I've never believed it from anyone else. He just says things with such... conviction. John's so genuine and direct with me that it's still baffling me. I had to stop myself from jumping his bones in the parking lot. Which is something I've never even considered doing with anyone else. Like, I just needed him so bad. I don't even like having sex with men!!!!!!!! I felt insane. 

So then I invited him to come over on a different day. I have limited privacy with my roommate and our smaller shared space so I only had 6 hours alone with him. I've never even invited someone I was seeing over to my place since I moved into my current apartment because of the lack of privacy. All of this was so new and anxiety-inducing. Then, John was here. All of my worries went away. And I couldn't stop myself. 

We were intimate almost immediately. I took him to my bedroom and couldn't keep my hands off of him. The sex felt spiritual. The way he looked at me, my body. Oh my god. Every part of me was perfect and worshiped according. I didn't even care about climaxing I just never wanted him to stop. After the first time, we just lay together, naked, talking about just everything. Anything. For hours. He was so gentle with me and listened so kindly while I shared my fears, happiness, and dreams. And he shared his. We had sex again and I don't think I've ever experienced intimacy like this with anyone before. I've never heard noises come out of a man like that and even thinking about them again makes my heart explode. Hell, I've never had a man make me climax like that before. I keep replaying everything over in my head and craving him so badly. We watched my favorite show after and he just kept telling me how perfect I am. And for the first time in my life, I believed it. I don't want to mess this up at all because I feel such a spiritual connection to him. I want to crawl inside his skin and breathe him in until my lungs collapse. I can't even begin to think about the logistics of anything I just need John. I'll figure out the future a different day and pray I don't get hurt. But for now, I'll cherish today.

Hello everyone,

I’m a 26-year-old South Asian finance professional living and working in downtown Toronto. A little while ago, I made a post offering a safe, SFW NSA massage. The idea was simple: you could either come to my place or I’d come to yours, and I’d provide a long, relaxing massage. To my surprise (and delight), the post received quite a bit of interest—so yes, there are active women on this subreddit! After chatting with several people, I finally managed to match schedules and meet someone for this unique experience.

The woman I met, let’s call her “L,” is 24, East Asian, and lives on the east side of the GTA. She mentioned that it was her first time meeting someone through Reddit, so I wanted to make sure she felt comfortable and that we stuck strictly to the SFW arrangement we had discussed.

We spoke over Reddit and later on another social media platform for about 4-5 days before meeting. After verifying each other and building trust, we decided to set up a time. Since she lives quite far, I offered to pick her up—a small gesture to make things easier. I drove out east to meet her at a mall (a public place for her safety). We quickly broke through the initial awkwardness with some lighthearted laughter, and from there, we went to a nearby Starbucks for coffee and a chat.

After about an hour of getting to know each other better, we headed back to my apartment. I made sure to create a welcoming, relaxed environment for her. I live in a cozy place with a separate den that has a lockable door, and I had prepared it for the massage with dim lighting, soft music, and a few candles to set the mood. I used pure coconut oil—non-sticky, unscented, and gentle on the skin.

The massage went incredibly well. She seemed to enjoy it, and afterward, we spent some time cuddling and talking, which felt very natural and comforting for both of us. Once we had fully relaxed, we decided to grab some food together and ended the day on a really pleasant note.

Overall, it was a genuinely lovely experience—one of connection, care, and comfort. While the setup might seem unconventional, it’s a reminder of how important trust, respect, and clear communication are in any interaction.

Would I do this again? Absolutely. Any women here on Reddit looking for a NSA SFW full body massage, please reach out.

Here is L’s feedback about my massage - https://imgur.com/a/r4Zl3HA

There will be nine books instead of six. This will allow many of the ideas and character journeys to be properly fleshed out. According to some sources, Phase 2 was originally planned as a nine-book series and for whatever reason, forced to be cut down to six so I won't lay the blame too thick on Derek Landy here. But come on, nine books for each Phase is fair. I'm not overly bothered about splitting them into trilogies like some fans like to but keep reading, you might come up with your own ideas! A pattern will be each book is given one overreaching villain who either dies or is disabled by the end, to keep focus and avoid hodgepodges where bad guys continually overlap and detract from each other until none feel properly utilised - looking at you here, UTE. Part 1, this post, will discuss Books 10-13. Warning: the more divergent the story gets, the thicker my paragraphs are. 

There will be no Phase 3. Everything I've done here is in service of making Book 18, the ninth book of Phase 2, the end for the series. I'm willing to cherry-pick a few ideas from the Phase 3 books so far but nothing big. No unresolved plotlines, no lingering threads, it's done and hopefully in a satisfying manner. This does mean things like the entire core murder mystery of A Mind Full Of Murder, as well as Alice becoming a main character and undergoing her villain arc will have to be jettisoned even if I'm invested in them currently.

I'm aiming to utilise a good chunk of the plots the existing Phase 2 was juggling already because while I'm not averse to slotting in my own ideas, OCs and putting my own spin on things, the vast majority of ideas Phase 2 introduced and played with, I really liked! They just rarely seemed to get used to their full potential.

This is going to get dark and I'm not skimping on the character deaths. This might go the risk of becoming too edgy and there's only so many times you can kill off somebody important to Valkyrie and cause her to spiral into grief but if The Dying Of The Light can handle it, so can this slaughterfest. And if nothing else, I'm convinced Landy has lost his edge when it comes to killing off characters so this will be my attempt to rectify that.

I'm changing nothing about Phase 1. I can count the number of things I would on one hand. That's another, and probably much shorter, post idea.

No character resurrections, period. As much as it hurts me. Ghastly, the original Serpine, Abyssinia for the second time, Wreath and Melancholia, everyone during the Deletion (which is its own can of worms I'll delve into later) are all still dead. There'll be a lot less emphasis on souls flying around and being captured, those will be reserved for the ultra-powerful mages whose souls are less likely to dissipate instantly. Sunbursts can still exist but they need to be applied ASAFP and I have no plans to use them for revival purposes anyway.

Finbar and Cassandra, along with Myosotis Terra, Geoffrey Scrutinous and Philomena Random, all still perish in a simultaneous global Sensitive assassination but it doesn't happen offscreen between books, instead it'll be during the events of Book 12. I don't hate the Night of Knives and I think it effectively shows how dark, jagged the series has become and give the impression of events transpiring between the Phases but Finbar and the others deserve better so I'll be bringing them back, giving them more scenes and giving their exit its due attention. Like in canon, Valkyrie will be capable of receiving visions, but Finbar and Cassandra are there at the cottage to oversee her and will be unnerved that Abyssinia is able to actively engage and touch Valkyrie through the steam. When Valkyrie gets hooked on her visions in Midnight, Cassandra will be there, promising to keep it quiet but disapproving. In Bedlam, the Night of Knives occurs and because of Abyssinia's activities and Sensitive powers, she's the prime suspect. However, she'll profess innocence, stating that her mental abilities are great enough that she could shield herself from any Seers' sight, barring Valkyrie who's a special case. This mystery is left open until Book 15, when the culprit is revealed...

I'll be cutting the following entirely: Cadaver Cain, Malice, the time travel plot of Dead Or Alive, the Faceless Ones returning to our universe in corporeal form, Valkyrie becoming the Child/Mother of the Faceless, the Child of the Ancients vs Faceless legend, Solace being Skulduggery and China's daughter, Caisson being the reason China defected, Mevolent being Caisson's father, the Host storyline, Crepuscular being Skulduggery's grandson, all that family tree junk basically. Concepts I like but will still cut are Obsidian and Darquesse's pregnant/rebirth storyline that culminates in the universal reboot although Sebastian Tao and Darquesse returning in some fashion are, after much deliberation, going to play a part. Naturally, Nuncle is getting booted too and I'm also losing Skulduggery being a demi-god spawn of Gog Magog as well as all his siblings still being alive barring Peccant. Some like Carver, Confelicity etc. and Gog Magog will be characters in-universe but they're not related to Skulduggery.

Valkyrie will be much less OP and have a more consistent power set. I'm 100% ditching the black lightning from the exploding Sceptre of the Ancients and the ability to latch on and adopt anyone's magic. She will retain her lightning powers which can be fired from hands, eyes and after much training, allow her to achieve flight alongside Skulduggery. This energy will, over the course of the books, be harnessed to create protective shields, and expansive waves of obliterative energy like the one that killed Vincent Foe although this risks friendly fire. She'll gain better control over the level of power the lightning emits, so she can choose to stun, shock or char enemies to cinders. I'm keeping the aura-vision because it's rad and we'll be able to catalogue all sorts of new aura colours. She'll retain her Sensitive powers, allowing her to see visions of the future and peer into if not meld with the minds of others, which will lead to some inventive, creative pieces of writing and ways of exploring some character perspectives we otherwise wouldn't have. And in the final two books, she'll unlock the destructive black fire wielded by Darquesse and The Unnamed. Now onto the individual books!

**Book 10: Hearts Of Darkness**

Main Villain: Lethe

Set in September 2018, five years after Devastation Day. I'm including a stamp like this with every book to keep the timeline mapped out smoothly. Valkyrie's age is 23 and her birthday is still 12th February just to avoid inconsistencies around aging. I've cemented Alice's birthdate as March 2011 so she'll be 7 here too. So, Resurrection is my favourite Phase 2 book and apart from a handful of things I'll go on to list, I'm leaving it relatively unchanged. The first four books of Phase 2 actually will all keep their central premises, just with some alterations to the details and iron out what I see as their flaws, it's not until Book 14 where the plots get drastically different. As for the title change, it's because despite 'Resurrection' working well as a dual reference to the main plot of the anti-sanctuary bringing back Abyssinia *and* a meta-reading of the series coming back with new life, the new one references Abyssinia *and* corrupted Skulduggery, the inner guilt of Valkyrie's dark acts and even Cadaverous to an extent. If I don't mention something in the following notes, it still exists and hasn't been altered save for Sebastian Tao who'll be introduced much later in Book 16. Everything else, corrupted Skulduggery, depressed Valkyrie, agent Omen, the anti-sanctuary's movements, are all being kept.

Abyssinia is still Skulduggery's evil ex-girlfriend, her past, story and motivations are intact. Many take umbrage with her powerful past and connection to Skulduggery being plucked out of nowhere but it serves the story and using established creeps like Bubba Moon, Gant and Wallow as her minions, it does offer up some build-up to her threat while still introducing something fresh, new and tantalisingly linked to the main characters.

Flanery is still a thing but he's no longer a Donald Trump-sized caricature and punching bag but a cunning, ruthless albeit arrogant mortal politician who uses magic for his own ends, through the blackmailed Magenta. His future alliance with Crepuscular will be less a string of bullying and more of a partnership although Flanery knows who's keeping the lid on the pot.

Never is less obnoxious and goes through a stronger arc of overcoming their hatred for Valkyrie. It isn't easy and it isn't quick but Valkyrie saving Never from that convict's energy blast will now mean something. Part of me wanted to rename Never too, because I prefer Taken Names that aren't massively common words used in prose but for now Never it is. They still won't be a perfect friend to Omen but I'm going to use that as part of his journey and for Never's arc too.

Tease Valkyrie's bisexuality more in her interactions with Militsa. They're going to be in a relationship and while I imagine Valkyrie is still her confident self once she embraces it, I would love to see some more of her uncertainty and perspective as she realises this. Many of the beats with Militsa will play out the same way but adding more of a *frisson* and more time devoted to their romance. I'd give Militsa more of a spark too, to put her on more equal footing with Val, too often her main personality traits were boiled down to 'nice' and their love story told rather than shown. I'd also combine some of the shorter chapters together if they're from the same perspective like 44-45 or 59-60 to improve the flow but this is the prickliest of nit-picks. 

Tipstaff isn't a traitor. The anti-sanctuary's mole inside the High Sanctuary won't be revealed until Bedlam, by which time several reoccurring staff members will have been introduced and be potential suspects including Tipstaff, Junior Administrator Cerise, Commander Hoc (who's much less obnoxious but somewhat indecisive about the job foisted on him), several City Guard officers, China's bodyguards who will also get names, powers and page-time and the Council of Advisors. The culprit will be Larrup, the respectful and dutiful City Guard that greets the Arbiters on their arrival to Roarhaven City.

Notable Deaths: Lethe (technically), Azzedine Smoke, Memphis, Quibble, Tanner Rut.

**Book 11: The Chimes Of Midnight**

Main Villain: Cadaverous Gant

Set 7 months later during April 2019. Valkyrie is now 24. The main plot is still driven by Cadaverous, gradually becoming more disillusioned with Abyssinia side-lining her masterplan searching for her son, pursuing a mission of vengeance by abducting Caisson and Alice, luring Valkyrie into his sadistic games. The finale still takes place in the Midnight Hotel but some changes will be: the Midnight Hotel is conjured and transports via magical sigils not seeds and Valkyrie creating a new Hotel so her and Cadaverous can have a giant scrap will be done by using the drawing toolkit she purloined from Palter Grey. The sequences with the Axe-Man, the florist and Gant-Town will be less dragged out and restrained to one or two chapters, and there'll be more emphasis on Saw-like scenarios like the Wild Hunt designed to test Valkyrie's resolve and intellect on the path to Alice. Cadaverous and Skulduggery square up but this time they explicitly acknowledge this is their duel promised in the last book - Caddie wins because he doesn't play fair and takes Skulduggery out of action. Valkyrie still mind-melds with Cadaverous, not to implant love but to throw him off guard long enough to eject him outside the Hotel where they have a proper life-and-death scrap. Alice tries to help by shooting Skulduggery's revolver, wounding her kidnapper and when an enraged Cadaverous makes to crush her throat, Valkyrie ends him by grabbing his head and pouring all the lightning she can muster, from eyes as well as hands, into his body, charring his corpse beyond recognition. Listen, I adore Cadaverous as a villain and felt his death via shrinking and getting clapped by Alice was very anticlimactic so I'd have Valkyrie do it and like this because nobody messes with her family. She destroys the Cadillac and the Hotel wards, allowing it to sink into oblivion. She briefly considers having gone too far but crushes any sympathy for Cadaverous and his history by reassuring herself that he went after her from Day One, he refused to see the truth of his apprentice's death, he took Alice, he brought it all on himself.

Omen is still enlisted as Alice's babysitter, is 'killed' by Valkyrie for Cadaverous' test and helps rescue Caisson etc. but several changes to his role here will be cutting his romantic sub-plot with Aurnia. The spaces left by those chapters will be devoted to more Valkyrie-Militsa scenes where we see the two get to know each other more over coffee.  Militsa's Necromancy plays a bigger part of her character and we follow Valkyrie's perspective as she embraces liking girls. During the ending chapters after the Midnight Hotel showdown but before the shock of Alice's broken soul, Valkyrie asks Militsa out on a 'date date'. But back to Omen, I'll be adding more with Auger which is now spelt Augur and his pursuit of Signum Linguistics. It's set up in Resurrection as his interest and we'll see him actually working on his skills in the field with some tense tutelage from Mr Peccant, a magically ambidextrous Elemental-Linguist. Omen will experiment with many powers before his Surge but my endgame plan is for him to be locked in as a Linguist. He might even help Valkyrie more during the climax by being the one to draw the symbol circle which allows a second Hotel to pop up.

The Sadist's Club is much more sadistic and full of sickos, Quidnunc has more advanced liquefactive necrosis to make him stand out and Cormac the doorman is an ogre not a fairy but a surprisingly articulate one. I'm keeping Caisson being the one to kill Mevolent in lore because it explains his torture at the hands of Serafina's forces but instead of the overcomplicated family tree diorama, he was just raised to hate Mevolent for wiping out his mother's family and he was apprehended by Serafina shortly afterwards while trying to escape the palace. Solace, gone mad with longing for Caisson after he's taken away, is committed to Greymire. Also, Skeiri has a different power and has no Murdacles like Razzia, those parasites will be unique to Razzia and be her Neoteric trait. They are permanently attached to her and can't be given over to others. 

Notable Deaths: Cadaverous Gant, Vox Askance, Skeiri, Avatar, Isidora Splendour, Palter Grey, the Wild Hunt Master.

**Book 12: Bedlam**

Main Villain: Abyssinia

Set during September 2019, 4-5 months after The Chimes Of Midnight. Now Bedlam is juggling about four plots as it is, those of Abyssinia's masterplan, Crepuscular working behind the scenes on magic-imbued soldiers and Blackbrook Contractors, Valkyrie going off the deep end trying to reform Alice's soul and Creed's Kith experiments. Only the last one will be downplayed a lot, many of the details about the Kith will be saved for Books 13/14, Creed is just a sinister background figure. Furthermore, I'm changing Temper slightly by having him be unaware of the Kith and the Activation process, he's still an ex-Church member but he left simply because he lost faith - this is so he doesn't look either suspicious or idiotic by not immediately blabbing about the depraved things Creed is up to. I'd also spice up Temper's chapters considerably by adding in italic sections relaying the Gist's hostile, murderous urges, delving deeper into the mindset of what a Gist-user endures. The other plots can all function as they are - Abyssinia still colludes with Flanery to attack Naval Magazine Whitley with a combination of Neoterics, First Wave and Coldheart convicts with Crepuscular pulling the strings, Omen and Augur become involved despite Valkyrie's warnings, Valkyrie descends into a Splash-marked, music box-fuelled madness after a stint in Greymire Asylum and is obsessed with curing Alice.

The corrupt City Guard officers like Yonder aren't working for some secret mastermind. They're just assholes. Yonder perishes in the convicts' attack on the Sanctuary and good riddance. So does Tipstaff but heroically. The attack will also be when Larrup or whoever the anti-sanctuary's spy is, will be outed and die themselves in the melee.

The soul fragments are found with the assistance of Doctor Nye with Whisper now acting as its permanent bodyguard, the encounters with the Clockwork House, ghost pirates, underwater laboratory, Necropolis etc. all feature however instead of the random fortune teller lady, one of the soul shards is located in Africa, where it's found its way into a repository of souls kept by the Necromancer Temple there. Apart from learning some tidbits of Necromancer lore throughout Egypt's history\* this is when we first meet Tanith again in Phase 2, in charge of Black Sand, with Frightening Jones as a lieutenant. The Arbiters strike a deal to help them fight against a sect of China's tyranny in Africa which has evolved far beyond simple control (more of this and China's descent into zealotry later. Skul and Val's actions here will also be recorded and be another factor as to why Valkyrie is imprisoned later along with their visit to Greymire) in exchange for Black Sand's aid in storming the Temple repository and recovering the soul piece. Relations are strained between Tanith and the Arbiters but Tanith pledges Black Sand's resources to battle Abyssinia in Oregon for the finale. Tanith still accompanies the missions to Blackbrook Base and hooks up with Oberon. Also now Black Sand's assistance in defeating Abyssinia gives China stronger reason to rescind the call for Tanith's arrest. One of the investigations into America and Blackbrook can lead to Valkyrie clashing with Mr Glee again, assigned to keep watch at key areas, to further their feud. Valkyrie still saves the Sea Hag from the mermaids and receives a bell of gratitude, which Valkyrie will actually use and the Hag joins the battle against Abyssinia. Like come on, they're on a *Naval* Base! Valkyrie is able to give Alice all her soul back and...that's it. No vision of Malice, this is an earned victory that allows Valkyrie to conquer one more aspect of her guilt-ridden conscience.

Valkyrie is still a descendant of the Faceless Ones. I was tempted to cut this but the secret Dusk tasted in her blood is so glaringly unresolved and there's a surprising amount of foreshadowing to it in books 1-4 so it's being kept. This is the major revelation that despite Alice's soul-fix, causes Valkyrie to be in a state of depression during book 13 which she'll battle to overcome. I'm also going to use Dusk way more in the books and cut that line about how his past evil was just a phase vampires go through - as well as many lines I find cringey or nonsensical in general like Nero, a part of Abyssinia's conspiracy to dominate mortals, being 'a liberal at heart'. Dusk's story of the Kith will hint at what Creed is up to when that gets spilled later although Dusk doesn't know the purpose behind them or of Creed's involvement. I'm slightly changing the history of this bloodline though, because I never liked the implication that after being taken over by a Faceless One, the God can abandon the vessel and the person remains, to me the person's existence should be wiped away utterly upon possession - that's what gave Batu and his plans of godhood the perfect touch of poetic justice. Instead, a group of the oldest Faceless Ones worshippers will collect the blood of a dead Faceless vessel - killed by a God-Killer other than the Sceptre - and drink it in a magic ritual much like the Grey Wardens' Joining ritual in Dragon Age. Some die but the more resolute mages survive and receive a boon of great power that puts them in closer touch to the Source, eventually passing it on to their descendants, including the bloodlines of the Unnamed and Abyssinia, the Unveiled and of course Valkyrie.

About halfway through the all-new Night of Knives I mentioned in the general notes will occur and afterwards, the three battle sequences will commence drawing us into the momentum of the book's climax starting with the convicts' attack on the Sanctuary. During this, the standoff between Skul, Val, China, Serafina vs Abyssinia and her anti-sanctuary won't be cut short by the reveal of Caisson's father but will become an all-out clash. China's two bodyguards I mentioned earlier will feature and be casualties of Abyssinia's wrath since there aren't enough scenes of Abyssinia slaughtering people (Sev and Zephyr 2: Electric Boogaloo anyone?). The anti-sanctuary escape, albeit with Nero's unstable Neoteric power on the blink, and return to Coldheart which the gathering Sanctuary forces infiltrate and besiege in another epic action sequence. The Obsidian Blade and Abyssinia's gift of power from her dying father told via memory remains to set up the Unnamed's grand return later although it'll be done by Valkyrie forcefully entering after a mental duel. After this, the finale ensues at the naval base and will all take place there, no Dark Cathedral. Omen escaping Lapse by outwitting him won't be as dragged out and will likely end with a K.O. Furthermore, half the First Wave kids will perish in the convict-Blackbrook trooper crossfire and more importantly, Abyssinia will be shown no mercy whatsoever. There's several times in Bedlam when Abyssinia, powerless or restrained, is rescued by the heroes and it's infuriating especially after three books' worth of build-up to such a dangerous adversary.

There'll be a scene where Skulduggery persuades the anti-sanctuary to betray Abyssinia, citing the fates of Skeiri, Cadaverous, First Wave and his own past with her as evidence of her manipulations - Destrier and Razzia, whose perspective and doubts we'll have followed, defect but Nero and Lilt do not. Razzia dies in the crossfire but her change of allegiance will make the good guys all sympathising and comforting her on her death bed make sense. Hansel and Gretel wither away and die, no Murdacle transplant here. Destrier's technical trickery allows them to pin down Abyssinia and barrage her to within an inch of her life and afterwards he becomes one of the Sanctuary's chief scientific staff - his work on the stun-kill guns will feature onwards and they'll be rolled out during any major conflict the Sanctuaries face in the coming books as will the binding, gunk guns but by Blackbrook and Crepuscular. Lilt, who will still be a menacing figure thanks to Abyssinia not torturing him in front of her enemy like a fool, fights on and is killed by Tanith's sword - Omen mulls on seeing one of his teachers dead and isn't as traumatised by it as he expected. It's Caisson, rejecting his mother's doctrine, who saves the day after Abyssinia is beaten into submission, he embraces his mother only to drain her of enough life force for Skulduggery to finish her off - he won't commit matricide but he will engineer her downfall. Desperate, she lashes out and kills Caisson whose corpse she imbues with the Unnamed's power in a vain, mad attempt to revive her son and once done, Abyssinia dies to Crepuscular and Flanery's joint attack as in canon, as does Nero. A grieving Solace, as neither a powerful Sensitive nor anyone's daughter of note, is re-committed to Greymire.

Omen's involvement proceeds as normal although the amount of time spent on forging the First Wave documents will be lessened and the Senior Year Agenda, a guide for students to list seven disciplines they want to practice to prepare for their Surge, will be a writing guideline for his continue training. As relatable as Omen can be, I'm developing his character and fighting skills much more to make his ability to keep up with many of the adult sorcerers realistic. The seven powers he'll have listed by the end are Signum Linguistics, Elementalism, Ergokinesis, Enhancement, Sensitivity and just to give them a go, Necromancy and Teleportation even if his natural aptitude is lacking. A big change though is that Jenan attacking the Darkly brothers at the end results in Augur dying from the stab wound. Yep, dead. For reals. This has major ramifications. Some further notes: Militsa will be introduced as Valkyrie's girlfriend in this book, she'll still reluctantly help her and Tanith acquire the necronaut suit from the Magical Museum and because I love it, retain the mini-arc of Valkyrie being ever so slightly scared of her parents' reactions to her having a girlfriend but of course they're accepting. I'd have Militsa meeting Val's parents actually happen in the books too - we saw Fletcher take this step, I'd see Militsa do it too - but I'll reserve that for the next entry, maybe in lieu of the Edgley family meetup near the start - although for added drama, Militsa meets not just Val's folks but also Fergus' side of the family! The China chapter at the end will instead be her meeting with Drang, her most trusted advisor, and order him to start forming relations with high-up mortals, the close call in Oregon prompting her to pre-emptively soften the blow in the event of magic being revealed to the world. And if there's a way to have the Arbiters attend that offscreen dinner with Serafina, Rune, China and the Advisors, I'd slot that in neatly. Final note, whether Vex is in this I'm not sure but if he is, there'd be some more dialogue with him and definitely some about the Dead Men-Diablerie team up to take out Abyssinia during the War.

Notable Deaths: Finbar Wrong, Cassandra Pharos, Abyssinia, Caisson, Razzia, Nero, Augur Darkly, Parthenios Lilt, Tipstaff, Yonder, Geoffrey Scrutinous, Philomena Random, Myosotis Terra, Larrup, Sabre, Disdain, Perpetua Darling, Immolation Joe, Clerihew Montgomery, Slyboots, Argosy Pelt

**Book 13: Apocalypse Rising**

Main Villain: Mevolent

Despite the title change, Book 13 still takes place over the course of a full year and split into four sections or 'seasons' beginning in March 2020 and ending in December of the same year. As it's one of the stronger Phase 2 books, Seasons Of War won't be changed too much overall with the exception of the sub-plots taking place in Prime Universe and drastically improving the ending. The main plot remains steadfast as a new seven-member Dead Men squad of all the same individuals journeys through a draugr-infested wasteland to assassinate Mevolent using the God-Killers before he completes his plans for invasion. The tensions in the group, the Shunter's demise, the sojourn to different locations, Valkyrie's perseverance over her demons and breaking her addiction, all takes place, But as for the changes, let's kick off with SOW's bum note ending.

The final battle begins at Tahil Na Kurge, where the Necromancers strike and break through the gates and begin to besiege the city. Mevolent vs Lord Vile, a duel between two titans of magic, is described in much greater detail and lasts several pages but Vile's sneak attack and the Necromancers' overwhelming forces have Mevolent on the back foot. In the ensuing chaos, the portals open and the battle spills out into Roarhaven. Forced to transform into his armoured alter ego to fight back Leibniz Vile, Skulduggery's transformation is witnessed by *everyone*. Tanith, Vex, Serpine, the cameras on Roarhaven - surveillance picks it up and the shock is staggering. After a destructive duel between the Viles, Skulduggery is bested by his counterpart because he's no match for a Vile centuries more versed in dealing out death and turns back to a skeleton. Valkyrie, Sceptre in hand, destroys Vile, causing the Necromancers to be free of his control and the draugar to scatter. Meritorious' Resistance forces mop up Tahil Na Kurge back through the portal and Roarhaven's forces are now marshalling. But Mevolent, recovering from his scrape with Vile, is up again and in battle mode. No break where his dead body gets revived by the Unveiled, no exalted march and reflection fakeout, the momentum continues and it's Mevolent vs everyone. Skulduggery, Valkyrie, Tanith, Vex, Serpine, China, Creed, Drang, the City Guard, the Cleavers all pile on Mevolent and his remaining soldiers and when killing him seems impossible, Creed proposes they trap him in Destrier's Eternity Gate which is teleported in by Fletcher. This time, Mevolent doesn't step in willingly, they have to battle him into it every step of the way. We get to witness how ridiculously powerful and experienced Mevolent is and some next-level Elemental magic as he draws on every last resource to survive the onslaught. The Sceptre is snapped in two in the process but a wounded Mevolent is trapped in time and the battle is won. The Unnamed never shows up and the Unveiled are never part of Mevolent's invasion plans. But the death count is high and Lord Vile's identity is on full display for the magical world.

To expand on the fate of some of the Leibniz counterparts in an admittedly fan service fashion, Vengeous still perishes from a God-Killer blow but his interactions with Serpine are more nuanced and he might even battle the Warlocks alongside the Dead Men before being hopelessly crippled and desiring a warrior's end. Mevolent's personal Teleporter Alexander Remit and bald, insane Eliza Scorn feature and both die in the final assault to Fletcher and Serpine respectively. Emmett Peregrine is there as the Resistance's chief Teleporter; Meritorious is the released Resistance leader but has scars from where Mevolent's special shackles were burned off to allow his escape, Tanith would also recognise him from Book 1 just to clear up that inconsistency. The Unveiled are mentioned to be dead in this reality, the result of a last attack that claimed the lives of Drang and others, including the Dead Men unaccounted for like Ravel, Saracen etc. The Diablerie may feature and the faceoff between the Dead Men and the Unveiled in SOW can now be them vs Gallow, Rose and Krav who fall to Skulduggery, Tanith and Vex respectively. Scarab in his prime and Burgundy Dalrymple may also feature during the explorations of the City and Tahil Na Sin. Many of the Necromancers encountered will be ones shown during Phase 1 such as Tenebrae, Quiver, Craven, Dragonclaw, Adrasdos, Kaiven etc. Finally, Professor Nye is slaughtered when the Redhoods attack its hideout for betraying Mevolent and with the portals a day away from activating, its services are no longer required.

China suffers a massive mental attack that puts her into a coma but this isn't the work of Solace who I've benched. Regardless, her coma allows Creed to ascend to Supreme Mage, the usual procedures bypassed because of the emergency posed by Mevolent. Vespers and a reluctant Praetor endorse it and outvote Drang who objects but is forced to concede. When this power shift happens I'm unsure, I'm torn between before the invasion begins during China giving a speech to the forces of Roarhaven or during a respite in the final siege. For now, let's go with the latter so we can still have China talking to Skulduggery about Saracen's death and why Serpine hasn't been disposed of, again highlighting her almost unnaturally ruthless nature which will be answered in book 14 along with the culprit behind her coma.

Omen's story is getting juicier. With his brother dead, pressure from his parents increases to train him and forge him into a new Chosen One who can slay the King of the Darklands. Omen, embittered by Augur's death and his parents' reactions more akin to losing a tool than a son, calls them out coldly and channels this frustration into his studies. Omen, who at this point will be entering his 5th year, becomes one of the most capable students in school and receives extra lessons from Militsa, Miss Wicked (who is *not* Militsa's petty, bitter ex), and Peccant on combat class and advanced magical theory. He'll also enroll and flourish in the duelling competitions around school, becoming newly popular and even ask out Axelia again which she'll say yes to and they become a couple. His friendship with Never is strained due to Never going behind his back for Augur's adventures and essentially abandoning him only to return to his side now. With a new determination, he goes after the Obsidian Blade with Axelia and Never in tow and obtains it thanks to the timely arrival of Crepuscular Vies who becomes his new mentor. Especially because it seems Skulduggery and Valkyrie, supposedly his friends, are always too busy to check up on him these days. Crepuscular still tells Omen his backstory about being Skulduggery's ex-partner left to die and Rake and Tancred will kidnap Axelia, not Augur. We'll discover later that among other things, Rake and Tancred were hired by an agent of Crepuscular's to procure the Blade hence why he knew where the two were hiding out and for them to kidnap Axelia in order to test Omen's resolve.

Temper's role in this book will be to investigate the murder, not of Sturmun Drang, but of an OC mage detective and trace it to Kierre of the Unveiled, a frame up job he deduces is orchestrated by Creed or one of his agents. Adam Brate is part of his search and has his sinister moment at the end, hinting he's a spy for someone else in the Church of the Faceless but isn't the murderer. During this investigation, Temper pairs up with a fugitive Kierre who he falls for and we'll get more time devoted to that relationship and the two come across Drang who, despite a distaste for Kierre's presence, covertly reveals he hired the murder victim to investigate Creed's illicit activities in the Dark Cathedral. Temper also clashes with Mr Glee but without his Murdacles, has to rely on his Gist, lessening his control over it even more and only Kierre's influence reining it in. The culprit turns out to be the unnamed female captain of the Cathedral guard mentioned in Midnight who wields a halberd but this discovery is made by sneaking into the Cathedral via Christopher Reign's smuggling tunnels, and as trespassers, any discovery of Temper's is rendered useless and he goes on the run with Kierre. Before running however, Temper discovers the storage tunnels full of Kith and for the first time, he realises the enormity of Creed's crimes.

Serpine continues to be amazing and steal every scene he's in but his redemption arc will be slow going and there'll be more show, not tell. After Mevolent's defeat, he gets his wish granted by Creed and becomes a denizen of the Humdrums, indulging in mortal past-times and living anonymously. Creed has plans for the ex-General however.

Saracen's power will possibly change. I have zero issue with him being a Lynceus who has X-Ray vision - if anything I'm more generous towards it than most fans since it neatly explains every use of his power in the past with no caveats. But part of me wants to make his magic more like purplejabberwock's idea of a temporal manipulator, a Saracen who can travel back in a short space of time so he can avert dangerous decisions that result in his friends' deaths. There's an ambush for them waiting around the corner? After falling into it, Saracen can travel back a couple of minutes, tell the Dead Men and they go another way. It fits his name, it's more impressive and *magic* than X-Ray vision and can even be foreshadowed by Valkyrie noticing Destrier's aura is a shade of purple like Saracen's in past books indicating this colour applies to time mages. Either way, Saracen still gets bitten by a draugr because random chance throws all the best-laid plans into disarray - Saracen can go back but in the same condition he would have been in the alternate future, so his draugr bite can't be reversed. If I kept the X-Ray vision, I'd cut Vex's little tangent about how Saracen was so mysterious and now his power turns out to be an anti-climax because that really wasn't helping to sell it to the readers. 

Notable Deaths: Saracen Rue, Luke Skywalker, Professor Nye, Alexander Remit, Leibniz Lord Vile, Baron Vengeous, Eliza Scorn, the Diablerie, various Necromancers and Mevolent sycophants.

That's a wrap for Part 1. See you soon for Part 2 where I'll dive into the next couple of books! I kind of wanted to end with my revised Book 14 because it's the first one where it feels like a completely changed book and not just the original but with improvements but it seems that'll have to wait until next time. This took me a good few hours to write so upvotes and any feedback is appreciated.",3,1734244698.0,skulduggerypleasant,5,0.72,False

When it arrived I discovered that this model no longer has an Americano button, that location has been replaced by an 'Iced Coffee' button, which isn't of much use in my climate. Bummer.. 

---Question: Is there any way to may an equivalent Americano with the 3300? --- I tried adding hot water to the 330's Espresso, but it is missing the froth the 3200 Americano function created (something I enjoyed). I may try adding hot water first (a long black I believe) next, but thought I'd ask here for advice.

Breaths of the morning fill the air, eyes fluttering open to find a simple stare. A stare I didn't even realized I climbed stairs to stare into. Just out of the blue...no...Brown...my eyes are blue and hers are brown...but they were so beautiful that I swear I could just drown.

A perfect nose to boop every time I'd see it, my favorite thing in the morning was the forehead kisses I'd give her before I made the coffee to sit. The conversations we'd have when we found a subject keen to throw at each other for a back and forth bit.

But the true best part about her...her hair. So thick, and beautiful like a lions mane. A Lioness in the pride of her terrain... she's never not left my mind,...I'm not sane...

When she'd surprise me with a delicious salmon dish with heavy cream and cherry tomatoes. We'd sit down at the end of the day and watch our shows. 

Doze off into the night with the TV on. Cuddling until the morning where I get to see the rays from the Dawn light my Dawn's skin for tender easy touches, but ....now gone....

I miss her...I'm sorry....for everything...I miss everything about you...all of it...

(Ok stop..) (What's wrong?) (It's not working....he should be completely capable of using his tongue in a more gentle tone than this. What gives?) (How long has it been since we've ""tried"" to write something romantic that isn't raunchy?) (How about you ask ""how long has it been since we've tried to write anything romantic at all?"")
(Why does it come so easy for him or us to let the poetry come out the way it has? Yet we can't be sensual) (boys?) (?) (.... you're doing it wrong. Let me help a little ok darlings?) (ok fine.) (thank you.)

Inhale. Exhale.

In the fields graze, her skin lay shining with a silken haze, magnified by the rays that splay her beauty and incomprehensible faze. 

Her talent unmatched by her wit and tender ties, her cries, her amazing thoughts that leave me speechless Everytime.

Creative in a pinch, and a hunger for more, her cravings only outmatched by her thirst for Dr Pepper from the store.

Airheads were her favorite nighttime treat, an airhead for our airhead before she sleeps.

Beautiful isn't a word to us that matches her, succulent doesn't even compare, there isn't a single jacket of the finest fur I could make that would give justice to her radiance and care. 

She was beyond anything we could compare, perfection could never describe this creature, she will always be beyond the worlds desolate stare, a woman of so much greatness that she supercedes any kind of flare.
