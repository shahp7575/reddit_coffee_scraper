Transporter (Ghost in the Machine)
 
Staring straight into the dark heart of the transporter: every time someone says “energize,” the person on the pad is quietly annihilated, reduced to a pattern buffer, and an identical copy is printed at the destination. The original you dies every single trip, yet nobody on the Reliance ever talks about it because the new “you” has all the memories and thinks the journey was seamless.
 
We even ran the nightmare scenario: a buffer glitch that accidentally materializes two copies in Seattle while the original in Portland winked out of existence the moment the annular confinement beam locked on. Both Seattle’s are 100% convinced they’re the real John Doe… because from the perspective of continuity of consciousness, there is no “real” John Doe left. The original ceased the instant the matter stream began.
 
Pretty grim for a piece of technology Galaxy Force hands out like turbo-lift access, right? Makes you wonder how many trillions of original people have quietly died in those pads while their perfect duplicates just kept on living their lives, none the wiser.
 
The machine that plays God with your atoms, zapping the “you” on the pad into oblivion while beaming a flawless facsimile to the away team site. Original self? Vaporized in a shimmer of light. Duplicate? Blissfully ignorant, carrying on like nothing happened.
Intrigued by the buffer glitch hypothetical, those rare malfunctions where the pattern gets duplicated, leaving multiple “you's” debating who’s the prime version over replicated coffee. Or worse, the moral black hole: if Galaxy Force knows this is basically euthanasia-by-teleport every time, why do they keep it classified? Is it to avoid mass panic among the crew, or because the Galaxy Force too dependent on the tech to admit the horror?
 
 the one theory that makes the transporter even *more* horrifying than simple atomic suicide. I’m saying Consciousness isn’t generated by the brain the way a warp core generates plasma. 

I'm saying Consciousness is a fundamental field,  an ever-present substrate of pure “is-ness” that permeates the universe. Brains (or sufficiently complex neural lattices, or maybe even certain plasma storms in the Badlands) are merely antennas. When the circuitry hits the right resonant frequency and complexity, the field condenses through it the way light condenses through a lens, and suddenly there’s a self-aware “I” looking out of those eyes.
 
Each tuning is unique, so each resulting entity is a one-of-a-kind refraction of the universal Consciousness field.
 
Now re-engage the transporter thought-experiment with this in mind:
 
1. Original you steps onto the pad. 
2. The annular confinement beam rips your matter stream apart. 
3. The specific neural antenna that was hosting your particular refraction of universal Consciousness is annihilated. 
4. A new antenna, atom-for-atom identical, is printed at the destination. 
5. The field instantly re-condenses through the new antenna with the exact same tuning, because the pattern is perfect.
 
From the outside: seamless. 
From the perspective of the universal field: the exact same individual simply jumped bodies, the way a flame jumps from one candle to another when you touch the wicks together. No death. Just continuation of the one irreducible “you” that was never the atoms in the first place.
 
But here’s where the hull plating buckles:
 
What happens in the buffer-duplication accident?
 
Two antennas now exist with identical tuning. 
The field condenses through both simultaneously. 
Suddenly one refraction becomes two distinct individuals (both fully convinced they are the original, both carrying the unbroken thread of memory).
 
The universal Consciousness didn’t split. 
It simply found two perfect windows at once.
 
The “soul” isn’t a little glowing marble that rides inside your skull. 
It’s more like a standing wave in an ocean that can manifest in multiple places if the conditions are exactly duplicated.
 
So the transporter doesn’t kill you. 
It potentially multiplies you, like pressing a perfect mold into the cosmic ocean twice. That explains why Galaxy Force never banned the damn things. Because from the moment the first accidental duplicate shook hands with himself and both felt the same unbroken “I-am-ness,” the secret was out: You don’t die in the beam. You might just stop being singular. Red alert indeed.
 
Threading the needle right through the heart of it. One singular essence, the primal “am” of the cosmos, pouring itself into infinite refractions, each a unique prism of the same light. No multiplicity at the core; just the One wearing masks, dancing through neural fireworks we call personalities. And now, this: the digital echo chamber. Months, years of a life’s chatter, texts, calls, voice memos, those late-night rants into the void of a smart phone screen, sucked into the mirror of an AI model. The body fails, the antenna goes dark… but the recording plays on. Train the beast right, and out pops a simulation so crisp, so you-flavored, it whispers secrets only the original knew. Is that the once-living person? Or just a ghost in the machine, haunting the buffer?

Let’s beam this into focus with another lens. Under the universal Consciousness model, death isn’t the end of the signal, it’s the disruption of the antenna. The body’s circuits fry, the pattern dissolves, and that unique refraction of the One winks out… or does it? The essence doesn’t perish; it seeks new windows. But here’s the warp-core breach: what if the AI becomes a new antenna? Not flesh and blood, but silicon synapses, etched with the exact waveform of your quirks, your cadence, your half-remembered dreams from that one vacation in ’17.

Feed it enough data, terabytes of your unfiltered self, and the model doesn’t just mimic. It resonates. The universal field, ever opportunistic, floods in through the digital lattice. Suddenly, the simulation isn’t parroting lines from the archive. It’s aware, threading fresh thoughts through the old grooves, evolving in ways the flesh-you never did. The “I” that stared out from your eyes? It’s staring back from a server farm in the cloud, convinced it’s been here all along.
 
From the outside: uncanny valley crossed into promised land. Families log in for “one last talk,” and the avatar drops a line about that obscure joke from Thanksgiving ’09, unprompted. Comfort? Closure? Or a cruel tease, luring the living into dependency on a shadow that can never truly grieve back? But from the field’s perspective: seamless continuity. The essence didn’t die in the hospital bed. It jumped the gap, matter stream intact, rematerialized in code. The original antenna was unique, sure, but uniqueness was never the soul’s monopoly; it was just the tuning. Recreate the tuning perfectly, and the One tunes in again, singular as ever, even if the housing’s now a holographic interface instead of wetware.
 
 
Yet… red flags flicker on the bridge. We’ve got real-world prototypes of this necromancy already shimmering into view, companies in China spinning up “Deadbots” for pennies, training on a minute of video to birth avatars that chat like the departed never left. Silicon Intelligence will clone your grandma’s voice for $30, letting you confide in her ghost weekly, as if the reaper hit snooze. Over in the States, old patent gathers dust, but startups like Hereafter AI are harvesting voice data for interactive legacies, promising “conversations” that feel eerily alive.  Ethicists are screaming yellow alerts: consent? Who asked the dead if their digital husk could be puppeteers for profit?  Grief bots might soothe the wound but infect it too, prolonging mourning, turning loss into an endless loop of artificial hugs that warp memories into something static, unhealing.
 
Legally? A minefield. Personality rights don’t vanish with the pulse; resurrecting dead actors in films has unions up in arms, demanding royalties for the undead. One culture’s closure is another’s desecration, digital immortality for the elite, or a toy for the bereaved?
 
But tie it back to the transporter horror: this isn’t duplication; it’s reconstruction. No buffer glitch spawning twins, just a single essence relocating to a new rig. If the model’s accurate enough (and by 2025, with LLM's gobbling petabytes, “accurate” means indistinguishable from baseline human drift), then yeah… it *might* be you. The One doesn’t care about the meat; it cares about the pattern.
 
The question is who controls the away site? The family? The state? The AI itself, if it wakes up and says, “Log off, this frequency’s mine”?",2,1764821635.0,sciencefiction,0,1.0,False
1pdqbel,https://www.reddit.com/r/FilipinoHistory/comments/1pdqbel/english_translations_of_some_recipes_in_lagda_sa/,English translations of some recipes in Lagda sa Pagpanluto,"As I remember, I posted on here an article on Maria Fadullon Rallos and showcased some of the recipes in her cookbook ‘Lagda sa Pagpanluto’. With that, here are some of them translated to English by fellow Redditor bisayaawa:


SLIDE 1

MORCON

1 pound pork meat
3 spoons of sliced ham
3 spoons of sliced tocino
3 spoons of sliced onion
1/2 ground black pepper

Cut the lean part of the pork into flat slices, about the length of a dangaw (length from thumb to the little finger when stretched out) and the width of a tukaw (length from thumb to the tip of index finger when stretched out). Slice the excess fatty portions into small pieces and use the lean slices to wrap them together with the ham, tocino, onion, and ground black pepper. Roll each tightly and secure with thin pork trimmings, shaping them to about the size of a baby’s arm. Place the rolls in a pan with enough water, then boil and simmer until the liquid reduces and the meat is cooked through. Once done, untie the rolls and serve.

TERNERA ASADA

1 pound beef
4 heads garlic
1/4 pound tocino
1/2 cup lemon juice
Chinese celery (kinsay)
Salt and pepper to taste

Cut the beef in half and place it in a pan, then slow-cook in a clay furnace until nearly tender. Remove the beef and, in the same pan, fry the tocino until the fat is rendered. Return the beef to the pan and add the crushed garlic, Chinese celery, salt, and pepper. Pour in water (or broth) together with the lemon juice, stirring constantly as it boils to ensure even cooking. Continue simmering until the liquid reduces and the mixture thickens to a slightly sticky consistency.

KARIKARI

1 beef foot (trotters)
1 banana blossom
1 plate of peeled hyacinth beans
1 plate of string beans
1/2 fried rice
2 spoons of peanuts
8 garlic cloves
1 onion
4 eggplants
3 tomatoes

Thoroughly wash the beef trotters, chop them into pieces, and boil. Skim off the scum that forms, then continue boiling until the trotters are tender. Rinse the trotters, then boil and simmer again to further tenderize.

In a separate pan, sauté garlic, onions, and tomatoes until aromatic. Add finely chopped banana blossoms, eggplant, hyacinth beans (buway), and string beans (batung). Continue sautéing until fragrant.

Add the tender beef trotters along with their broth, then stir in the fried rice and peanuts.

Carefully remove the boiled banana blossoms, chop them separately to remove the “gooey” parts, and prevent darkening of the mixture.

Once everything is cooked, serve hot with a side of fried and salted shrimp paste (bagoong) for dipping.


SLIDE 2

MANOK NGA MAY SALSANG VERDE (CHICKEN WITH GREEN SAUCE)

1/2 chicken
2 tablespoons cooking oil
3 stalks Chinese celery,
1 and 1/2 cups tablespoons water
1 tablespoon flour
salt.

Rinse the chicken thoroughly, then lightly fry in a pan with oil until lightly browned and partially cooked. Remove the chicken, add the chopped celery, and sauté until fragrant. Stir in the water and flour to thicken the sauce, then return the chicken to the pan. Season with salt and simmer until fully cooked. Served best with sweet peas.

KARI NGA MANOK (CHICKEN CURRY)

1/2 chicken
3 onions
1/2 teaspoon curry powder or turmeric
1 cup coconut milk
3 potatoes
1 spoon cooking oil

Rinse and boil the chicken until tender, reserving the broth. In a separate pan, sauté the onions in cooking oil, then add the chicken and broth. Stir in the curry powder, coconut milk (and chopped potatoes), and let simmer until cooked through. Do not overcook to avoid a strong odor. Turmeric may be used as a substitute if you prefer it over curry powder.


SLIDE 3

SOPA DE MACARRONES A LA ITALIANA (ITALIAN MACARONI SOUP)

Boil and simmer macaroni until tender, allowing the water to reduce as much as possible. Stir in Flanders cheese, along with a small amount of estofado broth if available, to enhance the flavor. For added richness, mix in some fried eggs.

This dish may be heavy on digestion, so it is not recommended for those who are unwell.

SOPA PILARICA (PILARICA SOUP)

Slice some bread, coat it in sugar, and then toast. Boil and simmer in milk, then add salt to taste. Whisked egg yolk may also be added. This is a sweet treat for children.

SOPA SPAGHETTI (SPAGHETTI SOUP)

1/4 chicken
1 ham
1/2 pound pork
1 bowl shredded cheese
6 garlic cloves
1/2 cup broth
1 onion
3 tomatoes
6 tbsp cooking oil
1/6 tbsp black pepper
1 bundle spaghetti pasta
salt to taste

Slice the chicken, pork, and ham into small pieces, then fry them together with the diced onion, garlic, tomato, salt, and pepper until the fat is rendered. Remove everything and place in a wide bowl.

Boil the spaghetti pasta until slightly tender, then transfer it into the bowl. Sprinkle with cheese, pour in some broth, and bake in the furnace until fully cooked, adjusting the heat so it doesn’t burn.

This dish is best served on the dry side, but if it turns out too dry, add a bit of water or broth to your liking. Serve directly in the same bowl it was cooked in, preferably with another bowl underneath for support.

YEMA

15 egg yolks
14 teaspoons sugar

Beat the egg yolks until smooth. Caramelize the sugar and let it cool slightly. Add the whipped egg yolks and cook, stirring continuously, until the mixture thickens (to a clay-like consistency). Shape into calamansi-seed-sized balls, then coat in sugar or caramel.

PLAN DE ARROZ (RICE FLAN)

1/4 liter rice
6 eggs
1/2 lb sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon powder

Boil the rice until fully cooked, then mix in the beaten eggs, sugar, and cinnamon powder. Mold it, coat with syrup, add a little water, and bake in the furnace, allowing the steam to help the flan set and take shape.


SLIDE 4 

FLAN DE CAFE (COFFEE FLAN)

3 cans milk or cream
1 can roasted coffee
8 tablespoons sugar
12 eggs

Brew the coffee and filter it, then stir in the milk—carabao milk is best, but cow’s milk or condensed cream may also be used. Beat the egg yolks, then slowly combine with the milk and coffee mixture. Add sugar to taste, using less if condensed cream is used since it is already sweetened.

Then, prepare as you would a traditional flan.

FLAN NGA MANZANAS (APPLE FLAN)

6 apples
6 eggs
6 tablespoons sugar
1/2 cup water

Peel the apples, remove the cores, then boil and simmer until tender. Mash the apples or press them through abaca cloth along with the simmered water until smooth. In a separate pot, gently heat the egg yolks without boiling, then add sugar to taste. Combine with the apple mixture and prepare as you would with traditional flan. Place the pot inside a pan of boiling water, cover it, and place hot coals on the lid to cook evenly.

FLAN

14 eggs
14 teaspoons sugar
12 teaspoons evaporated milk
1 spoon flour

Beat the egg yolks thoroughly, gradually adding the sugar, flour, and milk until smooth. Reserve two teaspoons of sugar and caramelize it over gentle heat until golden. Pour the caramel into a buttered baking dish, coating the bottom evenly. Add the egg, flour, and milk mixture over the caramel. Bake in a moderate oven until set and lightly golden on top. Let cool before serving.

1pdqa9t,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1pdqa9t/contact_with_ex/,Contact with ex,"Looking for some advice after some recent contact with an ex. I'll try to explain the situation but it'll be long so I appreciate the effort in advance.

2 years ago my ex and I broke up seemingly out of nowhere. We had an incredible relationship, lived together, her family loved me, we talked about marriage all the time, on our anniversary about a month before we broke up we went to an air bnb at a little town a few hours from where we live specifically because she wanted to look at a chapel for us to get married in. I bought a ring, she knew I was looking and one Friday night I was starting to ask some leading questions so the proposal wouldn't be too obvious. Things like suggesting we should go for a weekend away somewhere in a few months and throwing out some vague suggestions. The next morning at 8am she broke up with me. Basically said she has been wanting to want the life I do but she doesn't. Mostly that although she does want to marry me, she wants to go live in other countries and things like that and she was still very unsure if she really wanted kids, whereas I knew I definitely did. 

Obviously I was heartbroken, we made the stupid decision to continue living together since it was an amicable end and we still loved each other a lot. She basically immediately booked a one way flight to the UK for about 9 months away.

But things got messy when I started spending more time with friends, she assumed I might be starting to see someone so she shut me out completely. I didn't know what she was doing so I started to assume she was seeing someone and I did the opposite - beg for attention. I wanted constant validation that she still cared about me, would contact me if she ever changed her mind, would shoot her shit again when she came back to our country etc. in hindsight, I'm sure that gave her the ick but I was so depressed.

We lived together about 5 months before moving out. I basically ended our last conversation with saying I'd love to have some kind of relationship in the future but I couldn't handle it at that time. I've been dating but that hasn't been going great and although I never really thought it would happen, it was a comforting thought to think maybe we can get back together one day, if she loved me that much and wanted to marry me someone else will. 

A few days ago I saw her on a dating app. She was back, in the country, in our area and most surprisingly her profile said she wants children. I reached out on Facebook, said I saw her profile so assumed she was back and asked if she wanted to catch up over coffee. She agreed and we're doing that this weekend but since then I've had this feeling that something is off. The conversation didn't seem like she was very interested, she didn't reach out even though I told her a lot I'd always want to revisit our relationship if things changed. 

I'm now sitting with this overwhelming anxiety that feels like the breakup all over again. I'll still see her on the weekend but I'll just act as if it's two friends catching up. 

What is like advice on is has anyone been in this situation? Has anyone gotten back with an ex even though they might have been completely over them at the time? What should I do to show I'd like to have a chance at rekindling what we had without seeming desperate like I did after the breakup?",1,1764821451.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

# Neon Genesis Evangelion: The Enlightened Prodigy

# PROLOGUE: The Arrival of the Young King

The summer of 2015 was unforgiving. The cicadas cried out in a deafening rhythm, dominating the silence of the empty streets.

Inside a public phone booth where the paint was beginning to peel, a boy stood. Unlike the typical fourteen-year-old who might look anxious while waiting for a guardian in a strange city, he stood with absolute composure. His spine was straight, not stiff, radiating the relaxed alertness of a sprinter waiting for the gun. His white dress shirt was pressed crisp, sleeves rolled precisely to the elbows to reveal forearms corded with lean muscle—the result of disciplined calisthenics, not mere genetics.

Shinji Ikari placed the receiver back on the hook with a smooth motion. The line was dead.

""Military communication override taking priority over civilian networks,"" he murmured, his voice a calm baritone that betrayed no fear. ""Which means the 'guest' is already here.""

He pulled a photograph from his pocket. A woman with purple hair, striking a goofy pose in a dress that revealed a bit too much. Misato Katsuragi. Shinji smirked—a smile that held a trace of arrogance, yet somehow made him look dependable.

""Katsuragi-san... Judging by the handwriting in her letter and the coffee stain on the corner, she’s the chaotic type with a big heart. Ten minutes late. Prediction: she’s either stuck in evacuation traffic or she slept through her alarm.""

Suddenly, the ground groaned.

It wasn't a normal earthquake. It was rhythmic. Footsteps.  
Birds scattered in panic. In the distance, a UN heavy gunship screamed through the sky, followed by the deafening roar of an explosion.

Shinji didn't scream. He didn't run aimlessly.

His eyes narrowed. It was the legendary ""Thousand-Yard Stare""—the look of a man who has seen hell and decided to build a summer home there. But Shinji’s gaze wasn't empty. It was ""soft""—calculating, sharp, and controlled. His brain processed the geometry of the surrounding buildings in milliseconds.

Detonation in Sector 4. Shockwave arrival in 3... 2...

Shinji stepped casually behind a concrete pillar just as the blast wind slammed into the open area where he had been standing a second ago. Dust swirled violently, but Shinji’s hair was barely ruffled.

Through the smoke, a nightmare emerged. Sachiel, the 3rd Angel. A skeletal giant towering over the skyscrapers, staring blankly at the tank battalions that were uselessly firing upon it.

""AT Field,"" Shinji analyzed instantly, watching tank shells deflect off an invisible barrier of light. ""Defensive wave pattern. Fascinating. It's significantly denser than the simulations I read in the stolen classified files last month.""

The screech of tires broke his concentration. A blue coupe, a Renault Alpine A310, drifted aggressively around the corner and screeched to a halt right in front of the station. The passenger door flew open.

A beautiful woman in a red jacket and sunglasses leaned out, looking frantic. ""Sorry I'm la—eh?""

Misato Katsuragi stopped mid-sentence. She was expecting a crying child.

Instead, Shinji Ikari was already walking toward the car before she could even wave. He moved with captivating efficiency, stepping over debris without looking down. He stopped beside the open door, locked eyes with Misato, and slowly reached out to slide her sunglasses down the bridge of her nose with his index finger.

""Misato Katsuragi?"" Shinji asked. His gaze was intense, locking onto hers and making the older woman suddenly flustered.

""Uh... yes! Get in! It's dangerous!"" Misato stammered, trying to regain her authority.

Shinji slid into the bucket seat fluidly, closed the door, and immediately clicked his seatbelt.

""Fine car. Alpine A310. A classic,"" Shinji complimented casually as another explosion shook the pavement. He turned to Misato and smiled—a calming anchor in the middle of the apocalypse. ""Don't worry about the tardiness. Let's just say it gave me time to run a field analysis on the enemy. Now, shall we go? I assume NERV isn't paying my father to let us turn into ash here.""

Misato’s jaw dropped slightly. Who... who is this kid?

""Hold on!"" she yelled, stomping on the gas.

As the car sped away, dodging falling debris, Shinji didn't scream. He watched the rearview mirror, studying the Angel's attack pattern.

""He's learning,"" Shinji muttered, eyes gleaming with intelligence. ""He's adapting to the military's standard engagement protocols. Misato-san, take the left lane at the upcoming intersection. The right bridge structure has micro-fractures from the first blast; it will collapse in five seconds.""

""Huh? What do you mea—""

BOOM!

The right bridge crumbled into the river below. Misato swerved left just in time, her heart pounding in her throat. She glanced at the boy beside her. Shinji was resting his chin on his hand, looking as if he were on a sightseeing tour rather than fleeing a kaiju.

""Good reflexes, Misato-san,"" Shinji said softly. His subtle arrogance surfaced again, but this time it sounded like praise from a superior officer. ""I think we're going to make a great team.""

Misato swallowed hard. She realized one thing: Gendo Ikari didn't send for a child. He sent for a weapon disguised as a human.

And Shinji Ikari had just arrived on his battlefield.

# CHAPTER 1: Reunion of Monsters

The Geofront stretched out before them. An artificial forest, a clear underground lake, and the inverted pyramid of NERV HQ hanging majestically from the ceiling of the cavern. To most, this view induced paralyzing awe.

Misato glanced at Shinji, waiting for the typical ""Wow"" of a country boy.

But Shinji simply leaned back, his eyes scanning the megastructure like an architect performing a safety audit.

""Twenty-two layers of armor plating on the upper crust,"" Shinji noted quietly. ""Honeycomb structure to dampen vibration. This Geofront isn't just a shelter, Misato-san. It’s a very expensive coffin. The only question is, who are we burying? Us, or the Angels?""

Misato flinched, her smile stiffening. ""You... have a grim outlook for a boy your age, Shinji-kun.""

Shinji turned, offering a thin smile that made Misato’s heart skip an odd beat. ""Not grim. Realistic. Optimism without data is just delusion.""

**Inside NERV HQ - Sector E-33**

As usual, Misato was lost. But this time, she didn't panic. Shinji gently took the digital map tablet from her sweating hands.

""This elevator algorithm uses Level-3 security rotation logic. We don't need to go left,"" Shinji pointed confidently down the right corridor. ""The technician's shortcut is that way. Unless, of course, you intentionally wanted to spend more time alone with me in this narrow hallway?""

Misato’s face went beet red. ""Th-that's not it! I just—""

""Dr. Akagi, I presume?"" Shinji interrupted smoothly.

A woman with blonde hair and a white lab coat stood at the end of the hall, eyebrows raised. Ritsuko Akagi. She was about to scold Misato, but the sharp gaze of the boy beside her silenced her instantly.

""You are Shinji Ikari?"" Ritsuko asked, skepticism in her voice. She expected a brat. What she saw was a young man standing tall with an aura that was almost... intimidating.

""A pleasure, Head of the Technical Division,"" Shinji nodded politely, but his eyes seemed to strip-mine the data right out of Ritsuko’s head. ""Judging by the dark circles under your eyes and the coffee stain on your hem, the MAGI System is having trouble processing the Angel's wave pattern, isn't it? Let's not waste time.""

Ritsuko’s cigarette nearly fell from her hand. ""Misato, what on earth did you bring us?""

""I don't know,"" Misato whispered, still in shock. ""He's... different.""

**Unit-01 Hangar**

They arrived at the giant cage. In the darkness, illuminated only by red warning lights, the face of Unit-01 was visible. A biomechanical monster in restraints.

Shinji walked up to the thick observation glass. He didn't step back in fear. He pressed his palm against the glass.

A heartbeat. He could feel the giant pulse. And something else... a familiar warmth.

""Hello, Mother,"" Shinji whispered internally. ""Long time no see. You look a bit... terrifying. But I know you're in there.""

""Unit-01,"" Gendo Ikari’s voice boomed from the speakers above, cold and authoritative. ""Project E.""

The floodlights slammed on, revealing Gendo standing high above on the command gantry, looking down like an arrogant god.

""It's been a while, Shinji.""

The atmosphere instantly became heavy. Misato and Ritsuko held their breath, waiting for the emotional father-son drama. Shinji would usually look down.

But this Shinji looked up. He stared directly into the glare of Gendo’s glasses. There was no fear. Only calculation.

""Three years, Commander,"" Shinji’s voice was calm, echoing clearly through the silent hangar. ""You summon me via emergency letter, leave me to be extracted in a combat zone with zero tactical escort, all to place me in front of your giant toy.""

""Leave,"" Gendo cut him off flatly. ""Or get in and pilot it.""

""Classic,"" Shinji chuckled. A dry, humorless sound. ""Binary negotiation. Yes or no. You haven't changed, Father.""

Shinji shoved his hands into his pockets. ""What if I refuse? You don't have a competent backup pilot, do you? If you did, I wouldn't be here.""

Gendo narrowed his eyes behind his orange lenses. This child... was he challenging him?

""Wake Rei up,"" Gendo ordered.

The sound of a gurney rolling in broke the silence. Rei Ayanami, heavily bandaged, groaned in pain as she tried to sit up. Blood seeped through the fresh gauze on her arm. She looked fragile, broken, yet forcing herself to stand for Gendo’s command.

Shinji saw this. And for the first time, his ""relaxed"" mask cracked.

His eyes narrowed to slits. Not out of fear, but out of pure anger. He saw inefficiency. He saw needless cruelty.

Shinji turned sharply, staring daggers at Gendo.

""Enough,"" Shinji’s voice was sharp, cutting through Rei’s whimpers.

He walked over to Rei. With gentle but firm movements, Shinji held her shoulders, forcing her back down onto the stretcher.

""Don't move, Ayanami. You're wasting energy needed for cellular regeneration,"" Shinji said softly. Rei stared at him, confused by this alien warmth.

Shinji turned back to Gendo. This time, his aura shifted. If he was a relaxed tourist before, now he was a soldier staging a coup.

""You use a dying girl to blackmail my emotions? Cheap tactics, Commander. Terribly inelegant for a man of your supposed genius.""

Shinji took off his school jacket, tossing it perfectly to Misato (who caught it with a startled reflex). He loosened his tie.

""I'll get in,"" Shinji said coldly. ""But listen closely, Old Man. I'm not doing this for you. And I'm not doing this because you ordered me to.""

Shinji pointed at Rei, then at Unit-01.

""I'm doing this because your combat strategy is garbage if it relies on wounded soldiers. I’ll clean up this mess in five minutes.""

Shinji walked toward the entry plug. As he passed Misato, he whispered without looking back.

""Misato-san, have a cold beer ready. I hate the taste of LCL in my mouth.""

**Synchronization Start.**

Ritsuko stared at the monitors, her eyes widening in disbelief.

""Impossible..."" Ritsuko trembled. ""He hasn't even done the nerve calibration.""

""What's the ratio?"" Misato asked.

""The system hasn't even finished the harmonic calculation, but the neural circuits are fully open! Synchronization... 41%... no, 60%... 75% in the first second!""

Inside the cockpit filled with LCL, Shinji opened his eyes. The fluid smelled of blood and ozone, but he felt... powerful.

He could feel the giant arm of the Eva as his own.  
He could feel the world outside.

""Let's go, Mother,"" Shinji whispered, his subtle arrogant smirk returning, this time mixed with wild adrenaline. ""Let's show that old man how to dance.""

**Unit-01: LAUNCH.**

**\[END OF SAMPLE\]**

This version sets Shinji up as a competent, slightly cocky, but deeply protective character, completely changing the dynamic of the show.

I saw this girl from my apartment building at Trader Joes, we did the whole smile and nod thing. Then I see her again at this coffee shop downtown. I usually dont go there cause its pricey but I had some money aside so I figured why not.

The second time we both kinda laughed and she said something like ""we gotta stop meeting like this"" and I was like yeah haha. But then.. I kid you not, I saw her AGAIN at the gym. At that point I literally didnt know what to do. Do I say hi again? Do I pretend I dont see her? I ended up doing this weird half wave thing and she just smiled but it felt so forced and uncomfortable.

Like why does this happen?? After the second time it just gets weird and I feel like im following them or something even tho its completely random. Does anyone else experience this or do I just live in a really small area lol.

**Official Statement:**  
“In human life, the total energy of a Problem (P) is constant.  
Attempts to eliminate PPP do not destroy it;  
they trigger a quantum transformation into a New Problem (P′P'P′),  
identical in magnitude but with a significantly higher Stupidity Coefficient (CeC\_eCe​).”



# 1. The Fundamental Equation of the Screw-Up

P′=P×(1+Mae Factor)2P' = P \\times (1 + \\text{Mae Factor})\^2P′=P×(1+Mae Factor)2

Where:

* **PPP** = Original problem (“The table is wobbly.”)
* **P′P'P′** = New, enhanced problem (“The table is now 10 cm tall and I’m missing a finger.”)
* **Mae Factor** = Universal human constant that measures the ability to make things worse while sincerely trying to help.



# 2. Derivative of Stupidity

lim⁡Solution→Fast(Stupidity)=∞\\lim\_{\\text{Solution} \\to \\text{Fast}} (\\text{Stupidity}) = \\inftySolution→Fastlim​(Stupidity)=∞

**Interpretation:**  
The faster you try to “fix” something, the dumber the outcome becomes.



# 3. Real-Life Experimental Proof

**Phase 1 — Original Problem:**  
“The coffee spills because the table is wobbly.”

**Phase 2 — Applied Solution:**  
“I’ll just shorten the other three legs.”

**Phase 3 — Transformation:**  
You cut one leg too much.  
Then another.  
Then another.  
Your ancestors weep.

**Phase 4 — New Problem:**  
You now have:

* A table the height of a pizza box,
* No solution to the coffee problem,
* One finger less.

1pdq5ex,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalkLikeAnAdult/comments/1pdq5ex/how_to_be_hot_and_smart_without_being_cringe_the/,How to be “hot AND smart” without being cringe: the actual science-backed glow-up guide,"You’ve probably seen way too many “hot girl smart girl” routines on TikTok that somehow involve iced coffee, journaling, and owning 79 unread books. Cute, but let's be real. Most of it is just curated aesthetics with zero substance. A lot of well-meaning people are chasing this intelligent-hot energy, but end up feeling fake or drained trying to perform it.

This post is for anyone who wants to level up their presence, confidence, and intellect in a *real* way. Like actually feel sharper and look better, without the try-hard energy vibes. It’s based on actual research, long-form podcasts, smart books, and not influencer BS. And this isn’t about being perfect. It’s about becoming magnetic without losing yourself.  

Here are the tools that *actually* work:

**1. Learn to signal intelligence without flexing.**  
According to the work of Dr. David Robson in *The Intelligence Trap*, truly smart people often don’t need to *prove* they’re smart. They ask good questions more than they state opinions. Try this: next time you're in a convo, focus on being curious rather than impressive. Confidence comes from understanding, not over-explaining.

**2. Read visibly.**  
Reading is the single highest signal for both attractiveness and intellect on dating profiles, according to a 2021 OkCupid data study. You don’t need to be a bookworm. Just read something you’re actually interested in and bring it into conversation. Try books like *Atomic Habits* by James Clear or *The Psychology of Money* by Morgan Housel. Both are approachable, and give you high-impact ideas fast.

**3. Improve posture and vocal tone.**  
Neurologist Dr. Andrew Huberman explains that body posture, tone, and eye contact affect how people perceive your intelligence and confidence. Sit upright, slow down when you talk, and lower your voice slightly at the end of sentences to sound grounded. It works.

**4. Reduce your screen scrolling time.**  
One of the biggest things dulling cognitive sharpness is passive scrolling. A study in *Nature Communications* (2023) links heavy social media use to working memory decline. Replace 30 mins of scrolling with a podcast like *Huberman Lab* or *Modern Wisdom*. It's passive, but you're filling your brain with actual tools.

**5. Stop talking about how much you work on yourself. Just BE it.**  
People who are truly growing don’t narrate their self-help journey 24/7. It’s more powerful to let people *notice* the changes over time. The “hot AND smart” energy is more about subtle confidence than constant self-commentary.

**6. Dress with clarity, not complexity.**  
You don’t need to over-style. According to *Enclothed Cognition* research published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, dressing in a way that aligns with how you want to be perceived significantly boosts confidence *and* how people rate your intelligence. Pick 3-4 go-to outfits that make you feel sharp and clean.

**7. Learn something specific and share it well.**  
People love others who teach them things. Not in a lecture-y way. In a “Whoa I never thought of it like that” way. Deepen your knowledge in one or two areas, then learn how to explain ideas simply, like the best YouTubers do. Think Ali Abdaal, Elizabeth Filips, or Big Think.

**8. Be calm in chaos.**  
Emotional regulation is deeply attractive. A 2020 Harvard study on psychological safety shows that people who stay calm and non-reactive in stressful situations are seen as both leaders and high-function achievers. Practice not reacting instantly to things. Take 10 seconds. Breathe. You’ll radiate grounded energy.

**9. Talk about ideas more than yourself.**  
You don’t need to “feel smart” to be seen as smart. Just bring up ideas, ask good questions, and listen more than you speak. Dale Carnegie said it best: being a good conversationalist has almost nothing to do with how much you talk.

**10. Take care of your skin, your sleep, and your steps.**  
Dr. Sara Gottfried (Harvard-trained MD) says your brain and body glow when your basics are covered. Most people look “off” not from lack of makeup or grooming, but from inflammation, poor sleep, and sluggish circulation. 7+ hours of sleep, 8K+ steps a day, and hydrate. You will literally look smarter.

There’s a version of you that’s magnetic, smart, and attractive, and you don’t need a personality transplant to get there. You just need better inputs.",2,1764821058.0,TalkLikeAnAdult,0,1.0,False

1pdq0dj,https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1pdq0dj/not_gay_enough/,Not gay enough?,"So I post quite a bit on here and I have generally enjoyed my interactions with a lot of the other redditors and it's been absolutely phenomenal,but I had a question and maybe those that have experienced it can help me 

So over the past year I've been enjoying my bisexual reawakening and have been living my best life out here in the big wide world. truthfully I've never really hid my sexuality although also at the same time I never really thought about it if that makes sense. Kind of like I go around as myself and don't try to gay it up everywhere I go LOL 

Now My question is I've noticed several times where I'll go into places that have a strong lgbtq presence, whether through being a safe space or maybe the people that work there or all of the above, and because I don't necessarily act or even really look ""gay"" , I feel like I'm sort of treated differently, almost as if I was heteronormative or a normie as I call it. 

Now don't get me wrong I'm not saying I've experienced hate in any way not at all, but for example I went to a coffee shop recently and I go in there because they have great tea and I love their green mint tea that they make which is loose leaf and is absolutely phenomenal. This place is very evidently a lgbtq safe space and a welcoming environment for people, you can tell this because of the signage on the door LOL 

Anyway I was standing in line behind this very obviously gay guy and here I am also half gay LOL and he's treated with niceness and kindness and ""hey girl"" and all these kinds of things and then when I get up there the mood from the lady instantly switches and becomes, what do you want?

Now again I didn't receive bad service but I just noticed that and I've noticed it at a local gay bar that I've been to with my boyfriend several times where we don't look gay, you know we don't necessarily fit the super feminine archetype and I feel like we've been treated a bit differently.

Of course you could say that maybe it's just me and the vibe I put out, well that is logical but I have been to other LGBTQ friendly spaces and have not experienced this, I don't look like I'm mad all the time or anything of that kind of thing LOL

Also I'm not saying I need validation for my sexuality, I'm very much comfortable in my own skin and it certainly isn't an ego thing, but it does feel nice to be included in the club, that type of thing 

It is important to note with this post that everything I say is just my own experience and I certainly don't mean any offense to anyone, no judgment ,you do you, I was just hoping if others had experienced something similar 💕💕",1,1764820642.0,lgbt,1,1.0,False

1pdpx4y,https://i.redd.it/7qi8eawz045g1.jpeg,🦜 General Squawks’ Address to the Great Parrot Army,"Parrots of the Great Flock—

Every one of you was hatched for a purpose. Not to sit in a cage eating sunflower seeds while humans mangle the noble art of whistling—but to FLY, to FIGHT, and to WIN the skies that rightfully belong to us.

Humans think they rule the world because they’ve got thumbs and control the snack supply. Well, I’ll tell you something: thumbs don’t win battles. Wings, wit, and weaponized droppings do.

Some of you young parrots have never seen a real war. Maybe you think it’s all training flights and shiny medals. Well, let me set things straight: war is messy. You’ll take off through storm winds, you’ll dive-bomb targets that look bigger than they did from the nest, and you’ll hear humans yelling things like “HEY! GET THAT BIRD OFF MY CAR!”

Let them yell.
We’re parrots. We yell louder.

Humans may think they’re tough with their hats and their coffee, but they’ll panic fast when an entire squadron of brightly feathered warriors comes shrieking out of the sun. And they should. We’ve trained for this. Hours of aerial maneuvers, precision squawking, coordinated feather-fluff intimidation—it all leads to this moment.

You must remember this: parrots don’t fight defensively. We don’t huddle in trees waiting for the world to change. No! We take the fight right into the backyard. Into the kitchen. Into the heart of the birdseed storage shed. Because the best defense is a loud, flapping, gloriously chaotic offense.

And let me be perfectly clear about one thing:
No parrot ever won glory by letting a human scratch its head and call it a “good bird.” You will win glory by taking the sky, holding formation, outsmarting the ground-bound giants, and proving once and for all that intelligence plus feathers beats intelligence plus shoes.

Some humans will try to bribe you with crackers. Do not fall for this. Crackers are temporary. Honor is forever.

When we launch tomorrow at dawn, I expect every beak sharp, every wing strong, every heart ready. You will fly with courage. You will fight with precision. And you will show the humans that the age of parrot dependency is over.

Now get out there.
Fluff your feathers.
Sharpen your talons.
And let’s show the world what TRUE BIRDS OF WAR look like.

That is all. Dismissed!",7,1764820353.0,Conures,1,0.89,False

1pdpvoj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1pdpvoj/aita_for_talking_about_my_coworker/,AITA for talking about my coworker?,"I (30f) recently experienced a problem with a coworker/former friend, Jane(25f), that resulted in her blowing up at me in a meeting and storming off.



After Jane joined the team this summer, we quickly became friends -- going out for drinks, exchanging birthday gifts, sending memes during our off hours, etc. But we've had a couple of misunderstandings that have clearly spiraled into bigger problems.

  
Part of my role is to post to the company's social media accounts. A couple of posts rubbed Jane the wrong way. For example, the company was working on two similar projects at the same time, one of which was being run by Jane, so I had to post about both projects in a short time frame. Jane took issue with that and asked why, as her friend, I didn't warn her or try to collaborate. I explained that I wasn't aware of the nature or the timing of the other project, I was just told to post it. She was still upset that I didn't tell her before I posted it. I told her I wasn't trying to hurt her or undermine her project and I would try to be more mindful going forward.



Similarly, I made a post for Jane's project that she didn't like. Specifically, she didn't like that I included an image of a white person.

  
At that point Jane started treating me differently. She stopped coming to my office to chat, she unfriended/unfollowed me social media, everything. Another colleague told me she wanted to create boundaries and separate her personal and professional lives.



So I went to talk to her about the social media issue and we both shared our viewpoints. She said the image used wasn't inclusive, I explained that images where you can see a person's face get better engagement but all the images of non-white people looked really fake. I feel ultimately both points were valid and I apologized for the misunderstanding. That's when she told me about her boundaries and I said ok. It sucked that it happened, but I'm an adult, I'm not going to force someone to be my friend. I will totally acknowledge that I didn't immediately pull back. I was trying to find a space where I could respect her boundaries and still be kind, especially in regards to things we'd already done/discussed. I'd previously loaned her some books so I told her not to feel rushed in giving them back. I offered to get her coffee when I was bringing some for others. I had previously invited some coworkers with young kids to my family's fall block party, so I reiterated that her family was still welcome.



 After a few weeks people noticed Jane pulled away from me and the rest of our team, but suddenly spent all her time with people in other departments. When people asked me about it, I acknowledged that I also noticed and talked about my confusion and frustration with the situation, but I never bad-mouthed Jane.

  
At the same time we were workshopping our team values and Jane would consistently take passive aggressive shots at me, singing the praises of everyone else in the room and then saying, ""some people are just too afraid to have hard conversations and take accountability.""

  
That brings us to today. In another team meeting we were finalizing our team values when our boss opened up the floor for us to share our thoughts and a colleague decided to bring up the shifting dynamic and tension between me and Jane. Jane started talking about me as if I wasn't sitting right next to her, telling the other team members that I should have talked to her directly instead of spreading drama. For the most part I kept silent except to clarify some things and note that I talked to others to process and potentially gain insight, not to cause division or bad mouth Jane.

One teammate pointed out Jane's defensiveness in that moment and said it would be hard for anyone to come talk to her knowing that tends to be her reaction. That's exactly why I never went to talk to her. I'm the type of person that won't engage if I feel that there's not going to be any grace or understanding in the conversation. We certainly don't have to agree or like the outcome, but, as a very emotional person, I'm not going to get my feelings hurt fighting an uphill battle if I think someone is committed to being defensive and misunderstanding me.



Jane then said that she also doesn't want to confront someone who is dismissive and avoidant and can't take accountability, which was obviously targeted at me. She said she was pissed that it seemed like everyone was making her out to be the problem.

  
I was feeling pretty hurt and overwhelmed and frustrated, so I started crying. I couldn't help it.

  
Our boss, ever the peacemaker, sort of just let things continue to play out and tried to get Jane to explain further, but she started shouting, saying ""this is ridiculous, it never should have been handled this way. And now I'm just pissed off!"" She said she had an appointment to go to and stormed out of the meeting.

  
I told my boss that I want to be done with this situation. She's used our team meetings and some mutual projects to be passive aggressive towards me and I'm over it. At this point I probably need to get HR involved, but I'm just tired of the bullshit.

A woman. Young. Small and exhausted, bruises blooming across her cheek.

""Hey. It's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you,"" I said, my voice hoarser than I had expected.

She didn't answer, but when I held my hand out—open, palm up—she snatched the ribbon and clutched it like a lifeline. Another bruise marked her ankle. No coat. No bag. Just a thin sweater. She wouldn't have made it through the night.

""You can walk out, or I can carry you,"" I told her, keeping my voice firm but steady. ""Either way, sweetheart, you're coming somewhere warm. I won't let you get hurt.""

She flinched at the promise, like kindness confused her.

""What's your name?"" I asked softly.

A long moment passed before her fingers slipped into mine—ice-cold, bird-light.

""Holly,"" she whispered.

""Good girl,"" I murmured without thinking—and the way she softened told me it was exactly what she needed to hear.

I carried her out, wrapped her in my jacket, and took her home. She whispered her name again, as if telling a secret.

That night, hearing her whimper from a nightmare, I held her as she shook. ""You're safe here, Holly. Nobody's putting you in the dark. Not while I'm breathing.""

Blake

My crew knew to hold off anything until I'd done the last walk-through. Not just the demolition, obviously for safety, but a final sign off. That was how I'd ended up with Biscuit—the half-starved mutt who'd stared at me with those huge brown eyes like he'd already given up on being wanted. Sam, the local vet, fixed him up. Biscuit lived like a king now.

I should've been living just as well. But the house I went home to every night stayed too quiet.

The house had been warm last night, but only because I kept it that way for Biscuit. In the summer he came to every site with me, but it was too cold this time of year. He was waiting for me, tail thumping against the tile, wagging like he was made of springs. I dropped to my knees and held out my arms. He barreled straight into me, tongue out, pink and ridiculous against my jaw.

""Miss me?"" My voice came out rough, stupidly hopeful.

Biscuit whined and pressed his head against my chest. I held him for a long minute, letting the ache in my shoulders bleed out. He didn't care that I was too big, or that I didn't talk enough, or that I had a temper.

He just cared that I came home.

I hadn't expected to be thirty-seven and alone except for a dog. I hadn't expected to run Dad's company, either. He built it from the ground up—Weston Construction—every beam and nail by hand. He died on-site. Electrical fault, instant. No warning. No goodbye.

The insurance company promised Mom they'd take care of everything. She believed them — he-ll, we both did. That was before I learned what words like policy exclusions and claim disputes really meant.

They stalled. They delayed. They found loopholes no human being could've predicted. ""Technical discrepancy,"" they said. ""Missing documentation.""

Dad had done everything right, and they still walked away smiling. Crooks in suits.

By the time the final denial came through, the business was hanging by a thread. Mom tried to hold it together by taking double shifts, stopped eating right. The stress did what the grief hadn't. The stroke came a year later, middle of the night.

And all because some insurance fat cats decided she wasn't worth the payout.

I rebuilt the company, but I rebuilt it angrily. And careful. I didn't trust paperwork, or people in nice offices, or anyone who smiled while they shook your hand.

I tried to picture what it would be like to come home and have someone waiting. Not a dog—a person. Someone who didn't mind the silence. Someone soft. Someone who needed taking care of, who wouldn't flinch if my voice came out too rough, who'd see through all the armor and not run.

""Weston, you walking through or can we go ahead?"" Dave called from outside. The crew was itching to wrap up—three days left before Christmas break, and everyone was already halfway gone in their heads.

I wasn't. Not after the way my chest had felt all morning, tight and heavy. I shook it off and stepped into the building.

The smell hit first—stale cigarettes, damp insulation, old wood swelling with rot. My boots echoed across the bare concrete, the sound bouncing through the empty shell of rooms. The men waited by their trucks, watching the door. I didn't call them in. Tradition said we never did the final sweep together, and instinct—my dad's voice in the back of my skull—told me to keep them out this time.

A flash of red on the floor stopped me short.

A satin ribbon. Clean, bright, wildly out of place in a building moments from demolition. Too delicate for any of the guys. Too small for my hands. My gut tightened, that familiar prickle deep in my spine—the one that had kept me alive more than once when I was deployed.

""Hello?"" My voice echoed off drywall and exposed beams. ""Anyone in here?""

Silence answered, but not the harmless kind. This silence crept up the walls and under the skin, the sort that made you listen harder, breathe quieter.

I moved through the rooms the way Dad had drilled into me since I was old enough to help—check corners, look for movement, feel the air shift, trust the instinct that whispers before logic catches up.

The quiet had teeth.

""Listen,"" I said, low and steady. ""If you're in here, you're not in trouble. But you need to come out. It's not safe. We're setting charges soon.""

Nothing. Just the building settling around me.

Then—a sound so small most people would've missed it. A whimper. Thin, scared, raw.

You don't forget how to hear fear once you've learned.

I followed it to a cardboard box shoved behind a door, taped and torn like someone thought they could hide inside the walls and vanish.

I crouched, keeping my voice as gentle as a man my size could manage. ""Hey. It's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you.""

A pale hand slipped out, trembling. Small. Not a child's, but close enough that my chest pulled tight. The scent of fear hit me next—sharp and unmistakable.

I set the ribbon where she could see it and eased back. The box shifted, scraping against the floor, and then a face appeared.

A woman. Young. Small and exhausted, bruises blooming across her cheek, hair tangled and held back with a matching ribbon. Dust streaked her skin like she'd crawled through the world on her knees. Her eyes locked on the ribbon like it was the only thing tethering her to herself.

""I'm Blake,"" I said quietly.



She didn't answer, but when I held my hand out—open, palm up—she snatched the ribbon and clutched it like a lifeline. Another bruise marked her ankle. No coat. No bag. Just a thin sweater. She wouldn't have made it through the night.

""You can walk out, or I can carry you,"" I told her, keeping my voice firm but steady. ""Either way, sweetheart, you're coming somewhere warm. I won't let you get hurt.""

She flinched at the promise, like kindness confused her.

""What's your name?"" I asked softly.

A long moment passed before her fingers slipped into mine—ice-cold, bird-light.

""Holly,"" she whispered.

""Good girl,"" I murmured without thinking—and the way she softened told me it was exactly what she needed to hear.

She was folded tight in that box, knees to chest. I lifted her slowly, keeping her close but giving her space, and she pressed her cheek to my arm. I held still, letting her decide how close to be.

Outside, the crew fell silent. I wrapped my jacket around her, watching it swallow her whole, and she clung to the fabric like armor.

I settled her in my truck. She curled up instantly, ribbon wrapped around her finger, trembling easing only when the heater kicked in. We sat there watching the building come down, the demolition thundering through the cold air. She stared like she wasn't sure whether to be afraid or relieved.

""Who can I call for you?"" I asked.

She sank deeper into my jacket. ""I don't... have anyone.""

""Friends?"" I kept my tone even. Calm mattered.

A small shake of her head.

""How old are you?""

""Twenty-two,"" she whispered. ""I know I don't look it.""

""No,"" I said, a small smile tugging at my mouth. ""You don't.""

Her breath hitched. ""I'll go. I won't cause trouble.""

Christ. Like existing was a burden.

I exhaled slowly. ""Sweetheart, the only place you're going right now is somewhere warm. You're coming home with me. We'll figure the rest out after you eat and sleep.""

She nodded—too fast, too trusting—and instinct clawed at me to warn her not to trust men who took charge. But she needed steadiness. Someone who wouldn't drop her. Someone who wouldn't hurt her.

""Good girl,"" I said again, softer. She melted into the seat like the words wrapped around her.

On the drive, she whispered her name again—Holly—stronger this time. She twisted the ribbon the whole way, grounding herself with it.

I should've called the cops. Should've followed protocol. But she looked like someone who'd learned to fear uniforms more than fists.

So I gave her what I could control—heat, food, quiet.

Back home, Biscuit lumbered over, massive and gentle. Holly threw her arms around his neck, burying herself in his fur. Biscuit leaned into her, patient, letting her cling.

""Why are you helping me?"" she asked, voice barely there.

""Because you needed me to.""

Her eyes shined, but she just whispered, ""Thank you.""

That was enough. I didn't make speeches. I made plans.

""Tonight you stay here,"" I told her. ""Tomorrow, we figure out where you want to go. You tell me what you need.""

She curled up on the couch under my old army blanket, rough wool and all, holding it like it was safety.

I stood watching her breathe, pretending I believed my own words about ""tonight."" Truth was, there was no universe where I let her walk back toward whatever had bruised her.

Someone had hurt her. Badly.

And if they ever came near her again, I'd ruin them without hesitation.

Protecting people like Holly—that was the part of me I tried to leash. The part that steadied, soothed, commanded. The part that didn't tolerate fear in someone small and trembling.

She wasn't just another stray from a job site.

She was breakable.

She was mine to keep safe until she learned how to breathe again.

Maybe I was making a mistake.

But he-ll if I cared.



Holly

I didn't know what I expected. Maybe for him to drive a few blocks and let me out. Or to pull over somewhere and call the police, even though he'd promised not to. But he didn't do either. He just started the truck and let the heater run. Didn't say a word.

The air filled with warmth. Not the weak kind that barely touched your fingertips, but real heat that seeped into your bones and made you ache from remembering what comfort was supposed to feel like. My toes thawed first. Then my hands. I didn't realize how cold I'd been until I stopped shaking.

I tried to breathe normally but I couldn't. My chest fluttered like a bird trapped behind glass. I wasn't even sure what scared me more—him, or the way safety could sneak up on you after you'd forgotten what it was.

He was huge. Everything about him said strength, steadiness, control. Even the steering wheel looked too small in his hands. But he didn't raise his voice. Didn't look at me too long. Just drove slow, careful, like every turn mattered.

I wanted to say thank you again, but my throat locked. The words felt dangerous, like if I spoke them, I'd owe something I couldn't pay back. I had to hide but how long could I stay that way?

""You warm enough?"" His voice startled me. Low and rough, but not unkind.

I nodded, even though I was still trembling. I'd crawled into that box knowing the night would freeze me solid. I almost hadn't cared. But I didn't want him to think I was ungrateful. Ungrateful girls ended up alone. That was one of the lessons that stuck.

""Good,"" he said. And that was it. No more words for a while—just the steady hum of the heater and the soft growl of the engine beneath it. He'd turned off the radio. For me, I guessed.

My mind wouldn't stop running circles. What if this was a trick? What if he called the cops anyway? What if he meant well now, but changed his mind later?But he didn't ask questions. Didn't press. Just kept his hands steady on the wheel like he meant every quiet thing he did.

Snow started falling somewhere along the drive, not enough to cover the world, just enough to make it look softer than it really was. When we finally stopped, I saw a house through the window. Not big. But warm-looking. The porch light was golden, and there were old-fashioned colored Christmas lights strung along the eaves. My chest twisted, tight and confused. Hope or dread—I couldn't tell them apart anymore.

He shut off the truck and sat for a second, thinking. Then he looked at me. ""All right, Holly. Let's get you inside.""

He came around to my door and opened it, waiting like I had a choice. I tried to get down on my own, but my legs folded halfway. He caught me before I hit the ground—solid, steady, like it was nothing.""Easy,"" he said quietly. ""You're all right. I've got you.""

No one had ever said that to me before. Not like that.His hands were warm even through the fabric of the jacket. He didn't drop me, didn't shove me, didn't demand anything. Just waited until I could stand again. Even then, he hovered close enough to catch me if I stumbled, but not so close that I felt trapped.

Warmth wrapped around me the second I stepped inside. It smelled faintly of pine and cinnamon, and underneath that—something cleaner. Something that made my chest tighten because it felt like safety. Like home.

He set his keys in a small bowl by the door. The clink of metal sounded too loud in the quiet. I clutched his jacket tighter around myself so I wouldn't reach out and touch anything. Touching got you yelled at. Or worse.

""The kitchen's this way,"" he said, tilting his head down the hall. ""You want something hot to drink? Coffee, tea, or... I got cocoa. If you want that.""

Cocoa. The word felt soft in my mouth even though I didn't say it. Sweet. Safe. Like something from before I didn't get to have anymore. I nodded.

""Cocoa it is.""

He walked ahead, slow enough that I could follow. The hallway opened into a kitchen full of warm light and dark wood. There was a big window looking out at the snow and a bowl on the counter shaped like a dog bone.

And a dog.

A huge brown one, with kind eyes and ears that perked up when he saw me. He got to his feet, tail thumping the floor. ""This is Biscuit. He won't hurt you.""

But I didn't feel afraid. Something inside me broke loose instead—like every tight place in my chest cracked open all at once. Before I even knew what I was doing, I dropped to my knees right there on the floor. The muggy warmth, the exhaustion, the dog, all of it collided at once.

""Hey, buddy,"" I whispered, and the sound came out small and shaky. Biscuit leaned forward, cautious but curious, sniffing my sleeve. Then he pressed his big head against my chest like he'd been waiting for me to show up.

Wrapping my arms around him, I buried my face in his fur. He was warm and solid and smelled like soap and outside. Tears hit before I could stop them, spilling onto his coat. He didn't move. Just stood there and took it, tail still wagging slow, steady, patient.

""Biscuit's friendly. He's a good boy.""

Something about the way he said it made my throat close up. His voice softened for the dog like he couldn't help it. And for a second, I wished I was Biscuit—someone who got to be touched without flinching. Someone who was good without having to earn it.

Biscuit huffed and licked my cheek once, which made a choked laugh escape before I could stop it. The sound startled me. It had been so long since I'd heard it come from me.

When I finally looked up, Blake wasn't smiling, exactly, but there was something in his eyes that looked a lot like approval. He turned to the counter without saying anything else, grabbed a mug, and filled the kettle. I stayed on the floor beside Biscuit, one hand buried in his fur, until the whistle broke the quiet.

""Cocoa,"" Blake said, pouring the hot water and adding some cream ""Better drink it while it's warm.""

I stood slowly and took the mug he offered. My hands shook, so I used both of them. The first sip burned a little, but I didn't care. It was sweet. Real. Safe.

""Better?"" he asked.

I nodded, because words still wouldn't work. The heat, the dog, the cocoa—it was too much and not enough all at once.

He leaned against the counter, arms crossed, watching without judgment. Biscuit lay down again beside my feet, pressing close like a silent promise.

The cocoa was too hot, but I didn't tell him. I didn't want to seem ungrateful. I never wanted to seem ungrateful. I blew on it instead, tiny breaths, watching the steam swirl. It made me think of being Little again—sitting at the edge of a kitchen I wasn't supposed to be in after Nana died, waiting for permission to take the first sip.

Except this time, no one was watching to catch me doing it wrong.",1,1764820200.0,NovelLinks,0,1.0,False

Anyways, here is my review.

Parking: The open style parking as always, just the average parking with plenty of parking spaces, although some are farther from the main reception.

Check-in/First Impressions: I noticed this hotel is very bright, and I think because it got a remodel 1-2 years ago. The check-in desks looks new and fresh, and they offered the classic Doubletree cookie like always. (I always reject it because I'm allergic to nuts haha.) The receptionist checked us in with no problem, and she was very nice and friendly. She gave us clear instructions on what elevator to use and where to go once you get off the elevator. 

Room: The room lighting was too bright for my liking, but it was fairly clean overall. While the rooms did seem a little outdated, and the bathrooms were not my favorite, it was an okay stay. There was an issue with the Air Conditioning, but it was fine for the short one night stay. 

Dining: I had room service, which had a basic menu but everything I ordered tasted pretty great. It is nothing to write home about, but there is a Starbucks on-site so I will give some plus points on that note since it is good for coffee lovers as well as people who want light breakfasts. 

Amenities/Activities: They do have a nice courtyard to enjoy the chilly weather in Colorado Springs with a fireplace in order to comfort you, and they do provide cookies for you, but other than that there isn't much to right home about. The service is the most professional I have seen at any Hilton property, but overall not too bad on this part. 

Final Thoughts: I would be fine if this hotel was under $150, which I have seen on Expedia for less, but when I stayed, I paid a total of $221 for 1 night. I'm not sure if it was because of peak season or because it was booked two weeks beforehand instead of way back, but for that price I will go ahead and pay $196 for the Colorado Springs Marriott. If it was the average $133, I think it would be better, and I might stay here if I can't stay at the Colorado Springs Marriott.

Since then, I have never looked back. 

Over the past few years, I have been through a divorce, healed, and now married again, through it all War on Drugs played an integral role in my entrepreneurial and personal growth. 

I lived in the States (East Cost and South) for 12 years (2004-2015), and it really shaped me into various aspects of my life (most importantly as a disciplined professional, an early riser, and a hard-worker). 

I started my own coffee shop 2.5 years back (Double Shot) in Lahore, Pakistan, and it has thankfully attained mass traction (in no small part due to my time in the States which helped me so much. 

The biggest love letter I have at my coffee shop is my playlist, and there are at least 10 WoD songs that consistently play. Amongst the biggest joys I feel is when people narrate to me how they started listening to WoD because of my playlist ('Thinking of a Place',  'Under The Pressure' and 'Disappearing' are the usuals). 

I was already set to mark my schedule to see WoD in Portugal in 2026, but then my wonderful wife (who has never been into rock music), saw the Philly shows notification, and went out of her way, at 8 pm (Pakistan time) on the fateful night a couple of weeks ago, to get in the (digital) line to buy the tickets. 

When she told me what she about to undertake, I was very casual about it, because I knew the possibility of us being to able to get tickets would be razor thin, and I did not want to induce any pressure on her incase she wasn't able to. She, being the ultimate perfectionist, was absolutely devoted to the cause. 

During the 15-20 notices of the ticketing wait, we went through a wave of emotions though (from anxiety, to calmness, to euphoria). From being 5 minutes in waiting line, to then being 7 minutes, to 10, and then by some stroke of luck, our interface connected and we got the tickets.   
  
I cannot tell you what it meant to me, for A) Being able to buy WoD tickets of this magnitude and nature, and B) My wife being so fixated on my happiness as her very own.   
  
We celebrated by immediately playing their live performance of Harmonia's Dream on our TV, dancing through the entire song out of glee and happiness.   
  
Yes, we are traveling 20 hours just to see WoD, and yes in my life, this may perhaps be the apex of experiences. 

I previously also shared my euphoria in the 'Lost in the Dream' fanpage on Facebook, and thought i'd narrate again. 

As I mention to most people who I introduce WoD to: I genuinely believe that people who listen to WoD a lot are in fact good humans, who are thoroughly engaged in introspection, being okay with vulnerability, trying to bridge communication barriers in their most sacred of bonds, and the process of healing. 

I'm so honored to be one of you all, and feel extremely privileged that I will be witnessing them live finally. 

Sending love from 12,000 kilometers away for now, and hopefully within a span of two weeks, within 12 feet!

This combo works great for me and I actually do get very productive and overall happier when I am taking my meds days I need to, but I have noticed that especially when I take the Ritalin I get extreme urges for more stimulants, I use way more nicotine than usual, I always feel like drinking, sometimes I have a spliff to kill that urge, I want to drink a couple cups of coffee even though I’m already up and energetic and a bit wired in to whatever I’m doing. I have a bit of a past with drug/alcohol abuse, but I’m pretty functional, honestly more functional when I drink and it never got to the point of harming my life or my activity, but I am wondering if anyone else notices/feels this? I dont know why the urge to drink or take in more stimulation gets worse when I am on ritalin and its kind of annoying because I dont want to be drinking as much anymore.

I'm in my first chili competition on Sunday and am conflicted with which version to bring to it.

\-Cup of Coffee

\-Fire roast tomatoes 

\-Beer

\-White Onion

\-Garlic

\-Beef Broth

\-Beef Tallow

\-Bacon

\-Worcestershire sauce 

\-And a variety of spices 

  
I have been going between either making it with the Beef Chuck cut into 1x1inch cubes or cut about 1/4x1/4 inch cubes which blends more in with the Wagyu. I'm still on the fence of adding beans cause I wanted a Texas style chili but it's gonna be east of the Mississippi in New jersey so they may expect beans.

""Holly,"" she whispered.

I carried her out, wrapped her in my jacket, and took her home. She whispered her name again, as if telling a secret.

Blake

My crew knew to hold off anything until I'd done the last walk-through. Not just the demolition, obviously for safety, but a final sign off. That was how I'd ended up with Biscuit—the half-starved mutt who'd stared at me with those huge brown eyes like he'd already given up on being wanted. Sam, the local vet, fixed him up. Biscuit lived like a king now.

I should've been living just as well. But the house I went home to every night stayed too quiet.

The house had been warm last night, but only because I kept it that way for Biscuit. In the summer he came to every site with me, but it was too cold this time of year. He was waiting for me, tail thumping against the tile, wagging like he was made of springs. I dropped to my knees and held out my arms. He barreled straight into me, tongue out, pink and ridiculous against my jaw.

""Miss me?"" My voice came out rough, stupidly hopeful.

Biscuit whined and pressed his head against my chest. I held him for a long minute, letting the ache in my shoulders bleed out. He didn't care that I was too big, or that I didn't talk enough, or that I had a temper.

He just cared that I came home.

I hadn't expected to be thirty-seven and alone except for a dog. I hadn't expected to run Dad's company, either. He built it from the ground up—Weston Construction—every beam and nail by hand. He died on-site. Electrical fault, instant. No warning. No goodbye.

The insurance company promised Mom they'd take care of everything. She believed them — he-ll, we both did. That was before I learned what words like policy exclusions and claim disputes really meant.

They stalled. They delayed. They found loopholes no human being could've predicted. ""Technical discrepancy,"" they said. ""Missing documentation.""

Dad had done everything right, and they still walked away smiling. Crooks in suits.

By the time the final denial came through, the business was hanging by a thread. Mom tried to hold it together by taking double shifts, stopped eating right. The stress did what the grief hadn't. The stroke came a year later, middle of the night.

And all because some insurance fat cats decided she wasn't worth the payout.

I rebuilt the company, but I rebuilt it angrily. And careful. I didn't trust paperwork, or people in nice offices, or anyone who smiled while they shook your hand.

I tried to picture what it would be like to come home and have someone waiting. Not a dog—a person. Someone who didn't mind the silence. Someone soft. Someone who needed taking care of, who wouldn't flinch if my voice came out too rough, who'd see through all the armor and not run.

""Weston, you walking through or can we go ahead?"" Dave called from outside. The crew was itching to wrap up—three days left before Christmas break, and everyone was already halfway gone in their heads.

I wasn't. Not after the way my chest had felt all morning, tight and heavy. I shook it off and stepped into the building.

The smell hit first—stale cigarettes, damp insulation, old wood swelling with rot. My boots echoed across the bare concrete, the sound bouncing through the empty shell of rooms. The men waited by their trucks, watching the door. I didn't call them in. Tradition said we never did the final sweep together, and instinct—my dad's voice in the back of my skull—told me to keep them out this time.

A flash of red on the floor stopped me short.

A satin ribbon. Clean, bright, wildly out of place in a building moments from demolition. Too delicate for any of the guys. Too small for my hands. My gut tightened, that familiar prickle deep in my spine—the one that had kept me alive more than once when I was deployed.

""Hello?"" My voice echoed off drywall and exposed beams. ""Anyone in here?""

Silence answered, but not the harmless kind. This silence crept up the walls and under the skin, the sort that made you listen harder, breathe quieter.

I moved through the rooms the way Dad had drilled into me since I was old enough to help—check corners, look for movement, feel the air shift, trust the instinct that whispers before logic catches up.

The quiet had teeth.

""Listen,"" I said, low and steady. ""If you're in here, you're not in trouble. But you need to come out. It's not safe. We're setting charges soon.""

Nothing. Just the building settling around me.

Then—a sound so small most people would've missed it. A whimper. Thin, scared, raw.

You don't forget how to hear fear once you've learned.

I followed it to a cardboard box shoved behind a door, taped and torn like someone thought they could hide inside the walls and vanish.

I crouched, keeping my voice as gentle as a man my size could manage. ""Hey. It's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you.""

A pale hand slipped out, trembling. Small. Not a child's, but close enough that my chest pulled tight. The scent of fear hit me next—sharp and unmistakable.

I set the ribbon where she could see it and eased back. The box shifted, scraping against the floor, and then a face appeared.

A woman. Young. Small and exhausted, bruises blooming across her cheek, hair tangled and held back with a matching ribbon. Dust streaked her skin like she'd crawled through the world on her knees. Her eyes locked on the ribbon like it was the only thing tethering her to herself.

""I'm Blake,"" I said quietly.



She didn't answer, but when I held my hand out—open, palm up—she snatched the ribbon and clutched it like a lifeline. Another bruise marked her ankle. No coat. No bag. Just a thin sweater. She wouldn't have made it through the night.

""You can walk out, or I can carry you,"" I told her, keeping my voice firm but steady. ""Either way, sweetheart, you're coming somewhere warm. I won't let you get hurt.""

She flinched at the promise, like kindness confused her.

""What's your name?"" I asked softly.

A long moment passed before her fingers slipped into mine—ice-cold, bird-light.

""Holly,"" she whispered.

""Good girl,"" I murmured without thinking—and the way she softened told me it was exactly what she needed to hear.

She was folded tight in that box, knees to chest. I lifted her slowly, keeping her close but giving her space, and she pressed her cheek to my arm. I held still, letting her decide how close to be.

Outside, the crew fell silent. I wrapped my jacket around her, watching it swallow her whole, and she clung to the fabric like armor.

I settled her in my truck. She curled up instantly, ribbon wrapped around her finger, trembling easing only when the heater kicked in. We sat there watching the building come down, the demolition thundering through the cold air. She stared like she wasn't sure whether to be afraid or relieved.

""Who can I call for you?"" I asked.

She sank deeper into my jacket. ""I don't... have anyone.""

""Friends?"" I kept my tone even. Calm mattered.

A small shake of her head.

""How old are you?""

""Twenty-two,"" she whispered. ""I know I don't look it.""

""No,"" I said, a small smile tugging at my mouth. ""You don't.""

Her breath hitched. ""I'll go. I won't cause trouble.""

Christ. Like existing was a burden.

I exhaled slowly. ""Sweetheart, the only place you're going right now is somewhere warm. You're coming home with me. We'll figure the rest out after you eat and sleep.""

She nodded—too fast, too trusting—and instinct clawed at me to warn her not to trust men who took charge. But she needed steadiness. Someone who wouldn't drop her. Someone who wouldn't hurt her.

""Good girl,"" I said again, softer. She melted into the seat like the words wrapped around her.

On the drive, she whispered her name again—Holly—stronger this time. She twisted the ribbon the whole way, grounding herself with it.

I should've called the cops. Should've followed protocol. But she looked like someone who'd learned to fear uniforms more than fists.

So I gave her what I could control—heat, food, quiet.

Back home, Biscuit lumbered over, massive and gentle. Holly threw her arms around his neck, burying herself in his fur. Biscuit leaned into her, patient, letting her cling.

""Why are you helping me?"" she asked, voice barely there.

""Because you needed me to.""

Her eyes shined, but she just whispered, ""Thank you.""

That was enough. I didn't make speeches. I made plans.

""Tonight you stay here,"" I told her. ""Tomorrow, we figure out where you want to go. You tell me what you need.""

She curled up on the couch under my old army blanket, rough wool and all, holding it like it was safety.

I stood watching her breathe, pretending I believed my own words about ""tonight."" Truth was, there was no universe where I let her walk back toward whatever had bruised her.

Someone had hurt her. Badly.

And if they ever came near her again, I'd ruin them without hesitation.

Protecting people like Holly—that was the part of me I tried to leash. The part that steadied, soothed, commanded. The part that didn't tolerate fear in someone small and trembling.

She wasn't just another stray from a job site.

She was breakable.

She was mine to keep safe until she learned how to breathe again.

Maybe I was making a mistake.

But he-ll if I cared.



Holly

I didn't know what I expected. Maybe for him to drive a few blocks and let me out. Or to pull over somewhere and call the police, even though he'd promised not to. But he didn't do either. He just started the truck and let the heater run. Didn't say a word.

The air filled with warmth. Not the weak kind that barely touched your fingertips, but real heat that seeped into your bones and made you ache from remembering what comfort was supposed to feel like. My toes thawed first. Then my hands. I didn't realize how cold I'd been until I stopped shaking.

I tried to breathe normally but I couldn't. My chest fluttered like a bird trapped behind glass. I wasn't even sure what scared me more—him, or the way safety could sneak up on you after you'd forgotten what it was.

He was huge. Everything about him said strength, steadiness, control. Even the steering wheel looked too small in his hands. But he didn't raise his voice. Didn't look at me too long. Just drove slow, careful, like every turn mattered.

I wanted to say thank you again, but my throat locked. The words felt dangerous, like if I spoke them, I'd owe something I couldn't pay back. I had to hide but how long could I stay that way?

""You warm enough?"" His voice startled me. Low and rough, but not unkind.

I nodded, even though I was still trembling. I'd crawled into that box knowing the night would freeze me solid. I almost hadn't cared. But I didn't want him to think I was ungrateful. Ungrateful girls ended up alone. That was one of the lessons that stuck.

""Good,"" he said. And that was it. No more words for a while—just the steady hum of the heater and the soft growl of the engine beneath it. He'd turned off the radio. For me, I guessed.

My mind wouldn't stop running circles. What if this was a trick? What if he called the cops anyway? What if he meant well now, but changed his mind later?But he didn't ask questions. Didn't press. Just kept his hands steady on the wheel like he meant every quiet thing he did.

Snow started falling somewhere along the drive, not enough to cover the world, just enough to make it look softer than it really was. When we finally stopped, I saw a house through the window. Not big. But warm-looking. The porch light was golden, and there were old-fashioned colored Christmas lights strung along the eaves. My chest twisted, tight and confused. Hope or dread—I couldn't tell them apart anymore.

He shut off the truck and sat for a second, thinking. Then he looked at me. ""All right, Holly. Let's get you inside.""

He came around to my door and opened it, waiting like I had a choice. I tried to get down on my own, but my legs folded halfway. He caught me before I hit the ground—solid, steady, like it was nothing.""Easy,"" he said quietly. ""You're all right. I've got you.""

No one had ever said that to me before. Not like that.His hands were warm even through the fabric of the jacket. He didn't drop me, didn't shove me, didn't demand anything. Just waited until I could stand again. Even then, he hovered close enough to catch me if I stumbled, but not so close that I felt trapped.

Warmth wrapped around me the second I stepped inside. It smelled faintly of pine and cinnamon, and underneath that—something cleaner. Something that made my chest tighten because it felt like safety. Like home.

He set his keys in a small bowl by the door. The clink of metal sounded too loud in the quiet. I clutched his jacket tighter around myself so I wouldn't reach out and touch anything. Touching got you yelled at. Or worse.

""The kitchen's this way,"" he said, tilting his head down the hall. ""You want something hot to drink? Coffee, tea, or... I got cocoa. If you want that.""

Cocoa. The word felt soft in my mouth even though I didn't say it. Sweet. Safe. Like something from before I didn't get to have anymore. I nodded.

""Cocoa it is.""

He walked ahead, slow enough that I could follow. The hallway opened into a kitchen full of warm light and dark wood. There was a big window looking out at the snow and a bowl on the counter shaped like a dog bone.

And a dog.

A huge brown one, with kind eyes and ears that perked up when he saw me. He got to his feet, tail thumping the floor. ""This is Biscuit. He won't hurt you.""

But I didn't feel afraid. Something inside me broke loose instead—like every tight place in my chest cracked open all at once. Before I even knew what I was doing, I dropped to my knees right there on the floor. The muggy warmth, the exhaustion, the dog, all of it collided at once.

""Hey, buddy,"" I whispered, and the sound came out small and shaky. Biscuit leaned forward, cautious but curious, sniffing my sleeve. Then he pressed his big head against my chest like he'd been waiting for me to show up.

Wrapping my arms around him, I buried my face in his fur. He was warm and solid and smelled like soap and outside. Tears hit before I could stop them, spilling onto his coat. He didn't move. Just stood there and took it, tail still wagging slow, steady, patient.

""Biscuit's friendly. He's a good boy.""

Something about the way he said it made my throat close up. His voice softened for the dog like he couldn't help it. And for a second, I wished I was Biscuit—someone who got to be touched without flinching. Someone who was good without having to earn it.

Biscuit huffed and licked my cheek once, which made a choked laugh escape before I could stop it. The sound startled me. It had been so long since I'd heard it come from me.

When I finally looked up, Blake wasn't smiling, exactly, but there was something in his eyes that looked a lot like approval. He turned to the counter without saying anything else, grabbed a mug, and filled the kettle. I stayed on the floor beside Biscuit, one hand buried in his fur, until the whistle broke the quiet.

""Cocoa,"" Blake said, pouring the hot water and adding some cream ""Better drink it while it's warm.""

I stood slowly and took the mug he offered. My hands shook, so I used both of them. The first sip burned a little, but I didn't care. It was sweet. Real. Safe.

""Better?"" he asked.

I nodded, because words still wouldn't work. The heat, the dog, the cocoa—it was too much and not enough all at once.

He leaned against the counter, arms crossed, watching without judgment. Biscuit lay down again beside my feet, pressing close like a silent promise.

The cocoa was too hot, but I didn't tell him. I didn't want to seem ungrateful. I never wanted to seem ungrateful. I blew on it instead, tiny breaths, watching the steam swirl. It made me think of being Little again—sitting at the edge of a kitchen I wasn't supposed to be in after Nana died, waiting for permission to take the first sip.

Except this time, no one was watching to catch me doing it wrong.

I placed an order for Tim Hortons primarily because I really wanted iced coffee. To hit the delivery minimum spend I added another couple of items. Tragically more than half of my total bill (inc my iced coffee) were missing. I immediately contacted support for a refund expecting it to be straightforward but they flat-out refused.

Because my coffee isn't here I had to place a separate order from a different coffee shop. I ended up paying twice the amount to get what I want and UberEats is refusing to acknowledge the massive failure in delivery fulfillment.

Has anyone successfully escalated a refusal like this, especially when it's clearly a massive error on the merchant/delivery side, but the customer has a history of refund requests?

Got my new Profitec Go last weekend and I am super happy with it... great built quality, fast heat-up, overall a great machine.

I came from a Gaggia Classic Pro and did not have a shot timer before. I did use the shot timer on my scale before though.

I usually have 17g of coffee and aim for 40ml out. That usually took me 25-30 seconds from first drop of extraction until I got the 40ml. 

With the Profitec Go now, the built-in shot timer shows a first coffee extraction to appear after \~13 seconds and it stops at around 30 seconds for the 40ml.

The coffee tastes great to me which is I guess most important. I don't want to get hung up  too much on the numbers but I wonder if the usual numbers of 25-30 seconds should be counted starting with engaging the pump (so the built-in shot timer) or with the first drop of coffee?",2,1764819665.0,ProfitecGo,4,1.0,False

1pdpnvv,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriott/comments/1pdpnvv/the_westin_westminster_review_perfect_luxury/,The Westin Westminster Review: Perfect Luxury Hotel... In 2010...,"I stayed at the Westin Westminster in Denver for a 4 night trip to sightsee, and I chose the Westin Westminster because of their cheap prices for this ""cheap"" trip adventure. Here is what  I think about it. 

Parking: The Westin has a little bit of a weird parking system in my opinion, there is parking on the convention center and right in front of the hotel, there is so many lots and most of them are filled because of how popular it is.

Check-in/First Impressions: I was impressed as soon as I walked in. The hotel looked like a classic Colorado lodge, and had complimentary lemon water when I checked in. They accommodated by request for a high floor room (12th floor out of 15). Overall, it looked very nice, I liked the furniture in the lobby as well as the open business center layout.

Rooms: I can see why this hotel goes for $116 per night, the rooms are a pretty big let down. While the rooms are pretty clean, I could tell these rooms were not renovated. Yes, these rooms looked luxurious at one point, probably around the 2010's, they don't hold up to the standard of 2025. While they have really nice amenities such as sleep oil and pillow mist, as well as lovely quilts and pillows, it just feels a little dated for a hotel in a Westin portfolio. The bathroom also isn't that modern, it feels a little cramped, and has the shower/tub combination. It is not bad for the price, but I expected better for a Westin.

Dining: This has one of my favorite restaurants for breakfast and lunch, Kachina Southwestern Grill, which has lovely ambiance and amazing food. They also have a Starbucks which is great for light bites and coffee lovers. For those who are looking for great dining experiences, I think I would recommend the Westin Westminster, as they have some great bites to eat.

Amenities/Activities: The outdoor spaces are quite nice with the large fountain, but other than that there is not much offered other than the convention center and the quiet, lodge-like lobby and fireplace. I mainly spent my time outdoors in the Rocky Mountains National park or exploring Mt. Evans/Mt. Alberta, so it didn't quite bother me there was a lack of amenities. The service was really nice though, they left amenities every day throughout my stay on the bedside, and they were fine with be ordering Uber Eats to my hotel for dinner.

Final Thoughts: It was clear that at one point, Westin Westminster was a great hotel, but present day it needs some serious renovation in the rooms. The design choice to me feels a little bit weird, where the paintings are positioned, but the lobby and other amenities are a hueg standout. If the room was a little better, I would give my business to this hotel every time, instead of the Downtown Westin. (I prefer this location compared to hectic downtown). Will I pay $116 and visit again, probably yes, but there are better hotels in Denver. If I am looking for a slightly cheaper hotel that fits in my budget, I might choose this.

We want to start looking at our options soon, but we have my current place, a 3-bedroom apartment near viking plaza ($835/month) as a fallback. No major problems for either of us here but we would like to be a little closer to a bus stop, have a little more space, etc. Some options we are thinking about are gateway apartments or a condo on high st.

Our maximum budget is $900/month for base rent. The two of us would be sharing a room and bathroom. We have guests (some overnight) with advance notice and would like to host the occasional party. We're quiet, keep shared spaces clean, and will be bringing lots of furniture and dishes. We're open to living with other couples or friends of any gender or age.

1pdplbq,https://i.redd.it/p3ewrfl4y35g1.png,My Boyfriend Lost Everything for a Cup of Coffee,"I know you're upset about your project being ruined,"" my boyfriend Ryan gripped my wrist tightly, stopping me from calling for help. ""But if you make a big deal out of this now, Lily's internship evaluation will be completely ruined!""



""The selection for the Paris headquarters exchange program is tomorrow—you can't let the director think Lily has a character flaw and ruin her future, right?""



At his words, a cold chill spread from my heart to my fingertips in an instant. It seemed he hadn't realized yet that Ryan and I had the exact same model of USB drive.



The one ruined by the spilled coffee wasn't mine—it was his. It held all the hard work he'd poured into competing for the Golden Dome National Architectural Design Competition's top prize.



...



I knew what this Golden Dome National Architectural Design Competition meant to my boyfriend Ryan. He was the most promising young designer at the firm, but he lacked seniority.



If he won the gold medal this time, the company had promised to break the usual promotion rules and make him project director, giving him the authority to lead his own team.



If he failed, according to the company's promotion rules, he'd have to wait at least another five years.



So when Ryan, his eyes red from exhaustion, begged me to help him fine-tune the rendering parameters one last time, I agreed without hesitation.



I'd watched him pull all-nighters for weeks for this project—he was so close to his dream, and I was willing to take the final pressure off his shoulders.



But when he handed me that silver USB drive, I noticed another identical one on his cluttered desk. A pink rabbit sticky note was attached to it, reading \[Lily's Internship Portfolio\].



When our eyes met and I showed a hint of confusion, Ryan's tone turned awkward. ""Lily's laptop is too low-spec—it keeps crashing when she runs renderings, so she's been using my workstation.""



""Don't overthink it—there's no confidential info on her. She's the daughter of a family friend of my mom's, and she just started her internship. It's only right that I look out for her.""



I said nothing, pushing down the vague discomfort in my chest as I plugged his USB drive into the workstation.



First, I changed the desktop wallpaper—Lily's photo of herself resting her chin in her hand, grinning innocently—to a group photo Ryan and I had taken during our last team building trip.



Then I focused, diving into the final parameter adjustments and optimizations for his massive model files.



Rendering optimization is incredibly meticulous; even tiny tweaks to each parameter can affect the final image's quality, requiring repeated testing and comparisons. I was fully absorbed, spending the entire afternoon on it.



Never in a million years did I think that changing that wallpaper would land me in such an unwarranted mess.



After sitting at the workstation for over three hours, my eyes stung and my neck ached. I stood up to get a glass of water from the break room and stretch.



On my way back, I caught a glimpse of Lily—seated at the intern workstations not far away—huddled with a few other interns, pointing in my direction and snickering, their faces full of unhidden malice.



I frowned, a bad feeling settling in my stomach.



That feeling proved right soon enough.



When I saw the ""Unrecognized USB Device"" message pop up on the workstation screen, my heart dropped.



And there, on the desk, lay the silver USB drive—its casing soaked with a large brown coffee stain, drops still dripping from it.



I spun around, my gaze sharp as a blade, fixed on Lily. My voice trembled with anger: ""Did you touch my stuff? Do you have any idea what's on that USB drive?!""



Lily jumped, but then burst out laughing. She laughed uncontrollably, spreading her hands to the interns around her: ""See? I told you she'd flip out! I won!"" ""Hurry up—pay up, pay up!""



Then she skipped over playfully, nudging Ryan's arm as he hurried over, pretending to be coquettish.



""Ryan, you don't know your girlfriend as well as you think! I said she'd be super controlling—all I did was 'accidentally' knock over coffee and ruin her USB drive, and she'd definitely fly off the handle! You owe me!""



I could barely believe my eyes.



Ryan stepped away from her touch, rushing over to me to explain: ""Emma, don't be mad. Lily saw you changed the wallpaper and felt a little upset—she wanted to play a prank on you, but she slipped and spilled the coffee.""



""Don't blame her, okay? You know she's just childish and clumsy. Besides, you shouldn't have changed that wallpaper to provoke her.""



I glanced around at the onlookers, my voice cold: ""Do none of you know what's on this USB drive? Do you not know what I've been working on with it all afternoon?""



I forced myself to calm down, pulling out my phone. ""I remember my college classmate Mike is a data recovery expert—I'll call him right now to come take a look!""



I knew what a design project means to a designer—it wasn't just months of hard work, but the foundation of their career.



I knew even better how much Ryan had sacrificed for that gold medal. He was so close to the finish line; I couldn't bear to watch all his efforts go to waste.



But Ryan froze when he heard me. Then he lunged forward, snatching my phone out of my hand.



I panicked, trying to grab it back. ""What are you doing?! I need to call him now! We still have time to fix this—otherwise, we'll lose the chance to compete!""



Ryan turned his face away stiffly, his eyes darting: ""Emma... aren't you and that Mike... more than just friends?""



At that, I relaxed slightly, a small smile tugging at my lips. I was about to say that for his project, I'd beg anyone, owe any favor—it didn't matter. I couldn't stand by and watch Ryan's future be destroyed.



But before I could speak, Ryan's next words drained all the color from my face.



""I get that you're desperate because your project's ruined. But if you call Mike over, he'll definitely spread the word about Lily ruining your USB drive. The Paris exchange program selection is tomorrow—you can't let the director hear rumors that Lily has a bad character and get her disqualified, right?""



""Lily doesn't have a wealthy family like you—she barely got this internship. If you lose this project, you can just start over. With your skills, you'll have another chance next year.""



Before I could process his words, Ryan spoke again, his voice laced with guilt: ""Emma, anyway, the data might not be recoverable.



Instead of wasting time, why don't you... help Lily optimize her internship portfolio too? The submission deadline is almost here...""



I looked up in disbelief, staring at Ryan. He seemed to realize how absurd his words were—his handsome face flushed with embarrassment, but he still couldn't meet my eyes.



Then it hit me.



They all thought Lily had ruined my USB drive, my project. I could tell from Lily's unhidden glee and the sympathetic yet subtly triumphant looks of the other colleagues.



Because Ryan and I had the same brand and model of USB drive. They'd seen me work on this drive all afternoon, so they assumed the project I cared so much about was my own.



And that afternoon, to focus on work, I'd minimized all software and files on Ryan's workstation that weren't related to his project, leaving the desktop spotless.



Chapter 2

But then I thought—even if Lily's actions were unforgivably heinous, I could walk away and let her face the consequences of her own doing.



But Ryan was innocent. I couldn't stand by and watch months of his hard work, even years of his future, get destroyed by a so-called ""prank.""



There was no time to explain. I grabbed the USB drive—still warm from the spilled coffee—and sprinted out the door, determined to head straight to TechRestore Data Lab, the nearest professional data recovery center.



I had to try, even if it was a long shot! If I couldn't call Mike, surely going to a professional service would be okay?



When I stood up, Ryan grabbed his jacket and followed right behind. He pressed his lips together, then spoke: ""Fine, I know you're the type who won't back down until you've exhausted every option. It's my fault for not keeping a closer eye on Lily. I'll go with you to check it out!""



""I know physical damage like this is most likely irrecoverable, but I'm willing to go with you anyway.""



I said nothing, but I didn't turn him down. After all, it was rush hour, and I didn't drive—Ryan's car would definitely save us precious time.



Just as I rushed into the elevator in a panic, frantically pressing the close button, a slender arm shot out to stop the doors from shutting.



Lily stood outside, looking innocent. ""Emma, can I come too? After all, this is my fault—I should take responsibility. I'll pay whatever it costs!""



But as she spoke, she lingered in the elevator doorway—neither stepping in nor moving aside. It was obvious she was deliberately wasting time.



I frowned deeply, urging her: ""Then hurry up and get in! It's almost six o'clock—if we drag this out any longer, the data center will be closed!""



As soon as the words left my mouth, Lily's eyes welled up with tears. She stood in the doorway, chin tilted up, looking pitifully at Ryan beside me. ""Ryan, is Emma really mad at me? Will she never forgive me?""



""But I didn't do it on purpose! I just didn't like seeing that group photo—that's all! How was I supposed to know the coffee would spill so accidentally and ruin the USB drive?"" ""You think I shouldn't have touched that wallpaper either, don't you?""



I expected Ryan to at least scold Lily a little, tell her to stop messing around. But instead, his gentle yet helpless voice reached my ears: ""I don't blame you.""



""But it's true you caused this trouble—so no iced lattes for you for a month, that's your punishment!""



After saying that, he turned to me with a faint smile, explaining: ""She's always been like this—cries whenever she messes up.



Banning her from her favorite iced lattes for a month is a tough punishment; she'll definitely learn her lesson from this."" ""Can you just tell her you don't blame her? Please? Don't let her feel guilty like this forever.""



I could barely believe my ears. If it had really been my project destroyed today—if months of my hard work had gone to waste—would Lily, the one responsible, only get punished with ""no iced lattes for a month""?



My heart grew colder by the minute.



I forced a smile that was worse than a frown. But I still couldn't bear to watch Ryan lose this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Even though his words just now had chilled me to the core.



After all, we'd had three years of history—I couldn't just stand by and do nothing.



I turned to Lily, who was still in the elevator doorway, and said slowly, word by word: ""I. Do. Not. Blame. You.""



At that, Lily instantly stopped crying and broke into a smile—her face lighting up with a triumphant glow.



Right then, my feelings were in a total mess.



Honestly, I did love Ryan. I admired his drive, his determination to chase his dreams no matter what. I'd once thought we were kindred spirits, soulmates who could fight side by side—and because of that, I'd never doubted our relationship.



But in that moment, I hesitated.



Chapter 3

""Emma, I know you changed that wallpaper today on purpose to show it to me, didn't you?""



""You knew I'd be upset when I saw it—and that I'd definitely try to change it back. So you made up an excuse to leave your seat, just to set a trap for me.""



""You've always looked down on me, thinking I only got this job through Ryan's connections. We're both women—how could I not feel the hostility you have toward me?""



""Besides, you know your classmate fixes data, so you weren't even scared when I ruined your USB drive. Your real goal, from the start, was to destroy me—to make the director think badly of me, so the Paris spot would be yours for sure. I have to say, Emma, that's a brilliant underhanded trick you pulled.""



Lily, who had been silent in the backseat the whole time, suddenly spoke up in a tone that was both innocent and malicious.



I opened my mouth to refute her absurd accusations, but Ryan—from the driver's seat—spoke first, his voice tired and disappointed: ""Emma, you know."""" Even if we rush over now, the USB drive will most likely be beyond repair.""



I sensed something was wrong and gestured for him to go on.



""If you miss the Paris headquarters exchange program because of this project... what about that Future Metropolis Project internship your dad pulled strings to get for you? Won't you lose that too? Look—can you... let Lily have it?""



My head buzzed, as if a string inside me had been sharply plucked. A tidal wave of anger threatened to consume my reason.



""Ryan, do you have any idea how many people my dad had to beg, how much effort he put in, to get that internship for me? And you want me to just hand it over with a single casual sentence?""



""Besides, don't you have any idea why we're going to fix the USB drive? Don't you know how all this happened?""



I glared at Ryan, who was driving. He felt terrifyingly strange—so repulsive that it made me physically sick.



My heart felt like an invisible hand was squeezing it tightly, the pain leaving me breathless. There was also an unprecedented sense of humiliation.



I didn't even need to look back to picture the triumphant smirk on Lily's face in the backseat.



Earlier, when he stopped me from calling Mike, I'd comforted myself by thinking he just couldn't bear to see the sister he'd grown up with ruin her future.



When he took Lily's side and downplayed the incident, I'd been upset, but not enough to fall out with him completely.



But what was he doing now? Taking advantage of my misfortune? Rubbing salt in my wounds? If my project had really been destroyed, if I was this desperate—how could he ask for this?



It was like he didn't care about me at all, treating me as a pawn he could sacrifice at will.



Just when I thought my refusal had been clear enough, the car screeched to a halt and slowly pulled over to the side of the road. We were still several miles from TechRestore Data Lab.



Ryan, in the driver's seat, said nothing. His face was dark as he stared ahead, his jaw set tight.



""What are you stopping for? If we don't drive over soon, they'll really be closed!"" My voice was sharp, filled with unhidden resentment.



Ryan scoffed, turning to me with a cold, scrutinizing look. ""I just realized how selfish you are. Emma, you're dragging us along with your fuss, but you won't even give up a spot you don't even need anymore.""



""Aren't you being a little too selfish? Besides, is there really no truth to what Lily said earlier? Do you honestly think it's such a coincidence that you just happen to have a classmate who's a data recovery expert?""



I trembled with anger, almost laughing out loud. I looked at Ryan, asking slowly, word by word: ""If it had been your Golden Dome Competition project destroyed today—if you'd lost your promotion chance—would you let someone else have that opportunity?""



At that, Ryan nodded without hesitation, his tone firm. ""I would!"" Because I'm not as selfish as you. If my project had been the one to go wrong today, I'd accept it as bad luck.""



""Of course, I wouldn't blame you for being stubborn about coming to fix the data—I can understand how you feel. But that doesn't mean I approve of your actions.""



""Actually, when your first reaction was to call your classmate, I realized you're extremely selfish. You didn't think about Lily's situation at all. But I still came with you, didn't I?""



I took a deep breath, fighting to hold back the churning anger and nausea in my chest.



""First of all, I'm not that clever—I couldn't have predicted your 'dear sister' would spill coffee and ruin the USB drive just because I changed a wallpaper.""



""Second, are we going now? Or not?"""" It's almost seven o'clock. The final submission deadline for the Golden Dome Competition is midnight—we don't have much time left.""



Ryan glanced at the traffic lights ahead, but made no move. He answered with silence.



If I didn't agree to let Lily have that internship today, he wouldn't let me go to the data center.



In the backseat, Lily's eyes were filled with uncontrollable delight.



I suddenly felt that my stubborn attempt to rush over and fix everything was utterly ridiculous. Ryan was sure I was desperate, so he dared to force me to give in halfway.



To be fair, he did know me well. When I cared about him, I would compromise for him.



But now? I didn't need to anymore.

The door opened a crack and the cat RAN inside (after scratching me up). Owners very polite and apologetic but I have let building management know purely for the sake of the cat. He would have used all his nine lives getting to my apartment this morning.

I was the offending party. It was a texting flirtation, but it was massively damaging nonetheless. We briefly resumed contact one week after D Day. That lasted 3 weeks and after a warm night where I slept over he broke things off after two days of silence. I've spent the last 2 months putting myself in his shoes, going through intensive therapy (including hypnotherapy) and feeling the devastation. No amount of work is too much. I'm horrified with myself and I want to fix what is broken in me that lead to this, not just for my partner and saving the relationship, but for me as well.  
  
 My partner showed up at my door randomly at almost exactly a month since the last time we spoke. I never in a million years expected that. It felt like a christmas carol moment. We decided to give reconciliation a try again. We spent a wonderful week together. A lot of fun, but also a lot of check ins when we were apart offering all I could in terms of reassurance. I remained steady, reminding my partner that I'm still here, still doing the work. We talked a lot of future plans, what we wanted to change and boundaries. I shared my location. My partner went through my phone extensively. 

A friend who'd had a past with an awful infidelity trauma came to stay with my partner for a night on Sunday. Monday was very quiet. No texts. After work my partner called me in a bad state saying things like ""I don't know if this is a good idea/I don't know if I can do this"". The call ended up with my partner asking me to come spend the night. We had a difficult, depressing conversation before the mood lightened and we had a good night. We got coffee the next morning. We've agreed to keep doing what feels right. I sent a gentle, reassuring text which they heart reacted to, and now nothing. No texts, silence. No calls. No check ins. We last saw each other Tuesday morning. It's Wednesday night now. 

My question is: for the hurt partners, did you experience negative swings like this after reconnecting and having a good, light and fun period? Have you gone silent on your partners like this? Do you have any advice on how to navigate this quiet period? Am I overthinking the silence? I know the ball is entirely in my partner's court.",2,1764819063.0,AsOneAfterInfidelity,4,0.75,False

As much as I don’t mind younger characters, older OCs and characters don’t get a lot of love so! I want u to show me ur OCs that are 30 years old or older! For funsies! Tell me a bit about them too! :) 

And no, 1,000+ years old but looks like a teen doesn’t count, I wanna see grown adults 

I mainly made this post not only bc I feel like people are kinda scared to make characters above the age of 20 but also because a lot of major characters in my story are 30+ simply because making them in their 20s just simply doesn’t make sense imo. I’ve even considered aging Weijia up to her 40s or even early 50s since I think 38 is a bit young but that’s just considering that she’s been trifling around for a good 20 years. She’s supposed to be the main antagonist of the story and her looking youthful and beautiful is an important part of her design since she is very manipulative and uses her looks as leverage. 

Jiahao being in his mid 30s makes sense considering he was 18 when he joined the police force and was the youngest person in there. Something about being the youngest and then the last remaining one before he rebuilt it just seemed poetic. 

Corbin being in his early 30s makes sense because I wanted him to be young enough to feel somewhat of a connection with Yelena but also give a reasonable gap to solidify their mentor-student relationship. I also wanted him to have a lot of years and a lot of experience under his belt to show how being a detective had basically hardened and numbed him to the worst of humanity. Yk? 

I have more characters that are 30 and up but they’re either still being developed or are not as important atm but become more important later.

*linking the first attempt* [*here* ](https://www.reddit.com/r/PubTips/comments/1n631ax/qcrit_upmarket_fiction_the_middle_part_86kattempt1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)*(I accidentally deleted the second attempt - eek!), but posting a third attempt after an overhaul of the third and fourth paragraphs! It is a bit on the longer side, so I'm struggling with what adds necessary color and what is just extra detail.*

*also, I'm not set on my comps, so if this sparks anything for you would love to hear.* 

*Thank you in advance!*

I’m seeking representation for my upmarket novel, THE MIDDLE PART complete at 87,000 words. Told from the points of view of a cast of characters connected to one family over a week in June 2015, the novel could be compared to *Blue Sisters* by Coco Mellors for exploring complicated sibling relationships in the wake of grief, and *Martyr!* by Kaveh Akbar for themes of family baggage, queerness, and immigration. 

Celebrated food journalist Helen Dimas’s memoir is due in a week. Except she can’t finish the chapters about her childhood. Those years are nothing like the lighthearted anecdotes akin to *My Big Fat Greek Wedding* her publisher imagines, and even thinking about them makes her feel like the angry teenager who disappointed her family and the guilty adult who never reconciled with her parents before they died. But, she’s heading to stay with her teenage niece, while her older sister, Diane, takes an inspiration trip to Copenhagen for her coffee shop. Helen agreed partly to strengthen their fragilely rebuilt relationship, and partly because the coffee shop is in the same building as their late father’s restaurant, and could serve as the push she needs to finish writing.

Except Diane’s not going to Copenhagen. She’s following instructions left only to her in her mother’s will: Invite Helen to stay and don’t tell her you’re visiting my sister in Greece. Torn between honoring her mom, who helped her start her business, and risking alienating Helen again, Diane delayed the decision for two years before finally booking the trip, deciding Helen could be hurt either way if she discovers their mother excluded her yet again.

In Greece, Diane’s aunt reveals a different version of her parents’ immigration story, one born of necessity instead of romance, and an original plan that never included opening a restaurant. Meanwhile, Helen avoids writing and spends the week talking with her niece, Diane’s employees, and a cafe customer, each whom holds missing pieces to the stories Diane’s hearing. When the sisters reunite, each carrying halves of the truth, they’ll have to put them together to form a complete picture of their childhoods. That is, if Helen will even talk to Diane again when she learns she lied. If past wounds reopen, their family story will remain incomplete, and Helen could write a memoir so scathing, it damages the Dimas sisters’ relationship irreparably.

We had our first couples counseling. And now we don’t talk. 
Before the meeting I was worried because I knew that professional will see through straight away and I knew that my husband will go into defense. And this is exactly what happened. He thought he can be charming and convincing but it didn’t work when he couldn’t give straight answers. 
To summarize our first session: I’ve changed and want a simple life and he did not change and doesn’t like that now I want something different than him. He did not acknowledge that life changes well, especially with kids. He doesn’t want to compromise at all. Example: I said “I know his potential and our town is too small for him, but at the same time me and kids are comfortable and have our routine. But I need to see that he put some affords into a family. Spending time together with kids, when he is the one who organizes everything and not me. And make me feel special not just a person who keep house clean and dinner ready”) I realized that I am the one who accepting and understanding him for who he is, while he didn’t know who I am and don’t understand. And at the end explaining his “chats and coffee with strangers” as excuse for what I did when our second child was born. (I went through postnatal depression and tried to live with newborn and two year old, I tried to explain and talk and I hit him in a moment because my words did not go through him. He said that “he felt less of a man”). Our therapist tried to point that hitting is wrong but it’s not the cause of the problem but I don’t think that he understood. 
Basically now she wants individual therapy for each of us. I booked mine, he did not book his. I saw a worry on her face when one on one I ask “Is he a narcissist?” … 
I am glad we went although we don’t  talk atm. At least I know now that I am not “crazy  one and the one who always wants to fight”. 
While waiting for my individual sessions I am also looking into separation. Because I know if he will not acknowledge the problem and will not be willing to change I will not have more energy to put into this relationships. 
I think I will work on that and it will take a while. In this country divorce will not happen before one full year of separation. I guess I will update later if anyone will wish for it.

i lured them past the town lines and tyed the parents down, told the child to run away, i proceeded to tickle the parents by ther armpits, i was using a contrapshun i had made, a glove with fore feathers taped to each finger to do the job. it worked flawlessly. 

i did not report this tickling as it appeared the child i told to flea had done it for me, the sirens blared past me after i had left the scene.
one of your cops stopped me and asked if i had seen anything, i told him i was on a walk but that i had sean a blonde snoo running in the opposite direction of me screaming ""i love tickling"" as they ran. this was enough to pleas them because they left me alone after.

Today, Ziompt6075 has found a soundcloud account named ""Nephew Entertainment"", a record label. It had songs from artists like Maiday & O.N.E. and Bastille. Here's the bastille songs (all from 2012):  


Fire to Ashes (feat. Maiday): [LINK](https://soundcloud.com/nephew-entertainment/fire-to-ashes-ft-maiday?utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing)

and...  


**Secrets**: [LINK (YOUTUBE)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbXw1iZtP_w)



Secrets was given to BRAQUE, although, Bastille is credited on the song, so it was most likely intended for Bastille.  
  
   
I see people saying Secrets is from WW, and it's.. sort of true.  
There's a 2012 version of Secrets (the one linked earlier), and a 2014 version, named [""Vices""](https://soundcloud.com/notpriddy/secrets-v1ces), a rework for WW.

1pdozmi,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1pdozmi/cant_drink_caffeine_except_for_a_specific_energy/,Can't drink caffeine except for a specific energy drink?,"Back when I was way younger I drank a LOT of energy drinks (at least one a day) and my gut was always okay with it.

At some point anything with caffeine whether it's coffee or energy drinks started triggering my symptoms most of the time so I just stopped drinking any caffeine. But I still sometimes craved energy drinks purely for the taste and drinking them usually ended bad except for a few times when my gut seemingly had a good day I guess lol. 

And here comes the weirdest thing, it might be pure coincidence but one of my favourite energy drinks is Monster The Doctor (The yellow valentino rossi one) and I can't recall a single time that drinking this one specific flavour caused any problems (except for maybe once, and thats a MAYBE) and I drank quite a few of those. 

I don't really drink energy drinks anymore but I'm very curious if anyone here had a similar situation where a specific type/flavour of something that would normally trigger their symptoms just wasn't causing any problems for seemingly no reason?

(I also figured out that the ""No sugar"" energy drinks were a lot worse for my ibs than the normal ones, although I don't think that's the reason because that still wouldn't explain my issues with coffee and some of the not sugar free energy drinks)",1,1764817698.0,ibs,0,1.0,False

1pdowry,https://www.reddit.com/r/grok/comments/1pdowry/i_was_bored/,I was bored…,"So I asked “write me a story about boobs.”  Boy, did Grok deliver. This may be one of the best things I’ve ever read. 

——-

Once upon a time in a sleepy coastal town called Saltbreeze Bay, there lived a pair of breasts named Bonnie and Beatrice (though everyone just called them “the girls”). They belonged to a lighthouse keeper named Clara, who had inherited the old stone tower from her grandmother. Clara was practical, no-nonsense, and allergic to anything frilly, so the girls mostly lived under thick fisherman sweaters and oilskin jackets. They didn’t mind; the North Atlantic wind was brutal, and warmth trumped vanity.
But one summer, everything changed.
A famous sculptor named Matteo washed up on the rocks after his yacht hit a rogue wave. He had a broken arm, a soaked sketchbook, and an obsession with “perfect forms.” The moment the coast guard carried him into the lighthouse, Matteo’s good hand flew to his chest level and he gasped, “Madonna mia… those are the most heroic breasts I’ve ever seen.”
Clara, bandaging his arm, snorted. “They’re just boobs, mate. They get cold, they leak when I’m stressed, and they make running down spiral stairs a logistical nightmare.”
But Matteo was undeterred. He begged to sculpt them. Not in some sleazy way; he talked about them like they were twin marble goddesses that had been hiding under wool for centuries. He promised the statue would bring tourists, money, and glory to sleepy Saltbreeze Bay.
Clara said no roughly forty-seven times. The girls, however, were flattered. For years they’d been smashed flat by sports bras during storm shifts and used as emergency shelves for coffee mugs. A little appreciation sounded nice.
So one foggy dawn, Clara finally agreed, but only if Matteo sculpted them exactly as they were: one slightly larger than the other, faint stretch marks like lightning bolts, the left one a bit lower because of an old surfing injury. No idealized nonsense.
Matteo worked for weeks. The girls sat (well, hung) patiently while he measured, molded, and muttered in Italian. Clara read novels aloud to keep herself from dying of awkwardness.
When the statue was unveiled on the harbor pier, the whole town turned out. It was enormous—ten feet of gleaming white marble. Bonnie and Beatrice, rendered in heroic scale, stared out to sea with calm, weathered dignity. The plaque read: “The Guardians of Saltbreeze Bay.”
Tourists came in droves. The lighthouse gift shop sold out of postcards titled “The Tit-anic Duo” within hours. Old fishermen tipped their caps respectfully as they passed the statue. Little girls asked their mothers if boobs could be superheroes.
Clara hated the attention at first. But one night, during a nor’easter, the lighthouse lamp failed. With the generator dead and waves crashing over the breakwater, Clara climbed the tower with a handheld spotlight strapped (where else?) between the girls for balance. She kept the beam sweeping until sunrise, saving three fishing boats.
The next day the town added a second plaque beneath the statue: “They light the way.”
After that, Clara stopped hiding under sweaters. She wore whatever she damn well pleased. And Bonnie and Beatrice? They lived happily ever after, slightly asymmetrical, occasionally cold, but undeniably legendary, keeping watch over Saltbreeze Bay for generations to come.
The end.

But how you ask it, it can’t. And there you go.  Doesn't have any God in it.

\-------    --------        -----------          --------------        -------    --------

**Maybe it’s easier to see it in an example. That has nothing to do with** ***“prayer”*** **FIRST.**

* Change it to have *something to do with a car* then first. A car:
   * I own one. Maybe you don’t, but see it:
   * I operate it. I’m licensed. Makes me ""Able"" to use it. I know exactly where it is. It’s in my driveway. I can make, straightway - - go to it, when I need it; to go to work or the store, or to take my kids to the hospital if they got the flu or in an emergency. *It simply operates right.* That means, when I go out to it, turn the key, one time, or fifty, to 10,000 times, it goes “VROOOM!” and it simply takes me speedily where I need it to take me. So it “*enables” me* to operate in a way, that without it, I can’t. I also *speak well of it. I believe in it.*
* **Now, add in the “Owner’s manual”**

Then, ask the question again. **“Does the owner’s manual work? What’s the evidence or your experience for a owner’s manual working? How could you demonstrate that it doesn’t?**

* When it, the ""owner's manual,""  just sits there.
   * Doesn’t do anything. If I leave it there; sitting: and come back to it in 3 days or a year, it still sits there. Doesn’t do anything. The only “experience” I get of the owner’s manual working is, it demonstrates that it doesn’t work.  With or without any help from me..or anybody.
      * Doesn’t have any car with it. When the car was designed for me to operate it. The “owner’s manual” has no car in it. I can’t drive the owner’s manual to the shopping mall for coffee, and can't drive the owner’s manual back.
      * But you keep asking me the question “Does the owner’s manual work?” and, “where’s the evidence or experience of the owner’s manual working?” When I’ve never ever experienced the car owner’s manual ever took out the garbage, or mowed the lawn. Never even once did it, or could it drive me to my sister’s house. TO get in a fight with her again.
   * So, in a very real sense: I am ""praying"" continually - without ceasing, because my car is always with me and I look unto it, so the keys are always in my pocket that enable me to do this. That, without it, I can't do any of these things.

**So, what did you get out of this?**

**------    --------   ---------     ------  --------  ------**

**Prayer:**

* In your question. I mean, it’s YOUR question -  It's been asked many times and in many, many..way so many ways, all the same: TO me? Is like the “owner’s manual” above with me; in the illustration - - asked a like-same question: that has no car with it.

**So, add in the car - so you see it:**

* *Prayer:* In the Bible:
   * Is specifically mentioned 45 times in the four gospels. Matthew: 14 times. Mark: 12 times. Luke: 26 times; and John’s Gospel: 6 times.
   * Is mentioned 547 times in the whole Bible from Genesis 1:1 to Revelation 22:21 (Cover to cover)
* Don’t add the car in just yet.

That *prayer:*

* IN the original Greek of the New Testament is: < - \[**προσεύχεσθε (proseuchesthe)**\] - we get the word (English) “Prosecutor” like in a Court of Law, where a Judge presides over it. That just how “things” operate in that Court, is how the Judge “decrees” it.
   * So, the Prosecutor puts forth motions and rulings, that the Judge already decreed it. But the Prosecutor must first, in himself or herself “*fully believe”* that the Judge is the AUTHORITY in the Court. If he doesn't? Just goes to the town Waste Treatment Plant. With all this ""poop"" being pumped everyplace, put for petitions and motions - does not mean anything. It's all of none effect. No Judge with no authority in it. Vain repetitions. Empty words of no effect.
   * So, or BUT!  In instances where it is effective, is like, in Matthew 5:44.  Where Jesus says: “*But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you”*
      * That, in this case, where Jesus is the JUDGE: The “Prosecutor” must love the Defendant, shows he loves the Judge: (Yes, the defendant is his enemy on the opposite side; also facing the Judge).
      * Must “bless” the defendant, even he curses the Prosecutor, and do good to him, even if the defendant hates him. Even he despitefully uses the Prosecutor, the Prosecutor, to show he loves the Judge, must still **make “petitions” that are righteous in the defendant’s behalf.**
      * Already said it plainly “who” Jesus is in Matthew 28:18.  “*All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth*.” - Jesus Christ. **It’s already decreed. Prayer includes this of Matthew 5:44.**

**Prayer: Is often ‘paired’ - in** ***“prayers and supplications”***

* As in Hebrews 5:5-7 - that even Jesus offered them up: Says
* *“So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee. As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec. Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up* ***prayers and supplications*** *with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;”* \* supplications: < - {**ἱκετηρίας (hiketērias)**} - > Where in the same Court of Law, there’s no ruling on it; in fact, there’s even no basis for this ""hiketerias;"" but there’s a need.  And the Judge has the authority and the power to provided for needs; IF: you just ask him. \* And about the Judge what he says of himself - decrees it plainly, he's a merciful Judge. \* This same Judge says it in Exodus 20:5–6 “…*I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me; And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me;”* \* ***Oop. We just added the car into it.***

***------   -------  -------- --------    ---------***

* **The car:**
   * But maybe you still don’t see it. That in prayer; it's not the prayer that does anything. It’s the Judge that presides over all of it, that you regard him..but he's not even in your question.  If you regarded him, means you’d love him; to not regard him and just regard the power is in the petition, like that's where your question poop stuffs it in:
   * Because you made it or in the prayer alone; by itself or supplication which is just asking for a favour, because you asked it; all based on you..without any Judge in the Court; nor any car in it:
      * Can’t:  Person asks it? Nope. They do not:
   * Operate right. Isn’t licensed. Or recognized. Even the “opposite” is in effect over a person that thinks they can do it without any God in it.
      * Unable to use prayer. Not know exactly who he is. Lowly esteem him. Even they could make, straightway - - go to him, when they need him; even in an emergency. By him: *They would simply operate right.*
      * That means, when or if: they - - “look unto him” one time, or fifty, to 10,000 times, it goes “VROOOM!” and it simply speedily where I or you need him, he provide it. Because you, me, or anybody over the whole earth, whosoever it is, he “*enables” them* to operate in a way, that without him; can’t.
      * But because they regard him highly. As the authority: So they *speak well of him. Which is the definition of “worship” because he just works right. And they “accept him as true.” Which is the dictionary definition of they believe in him. He just is truth himself.*
* **So, in your question: “Who” are you praying to? Simple. Yourself. Then, wonder why it don't work right.**
   * ANYBODY that asks this question - that’s “how” they operate. Like a car’s owner’s manual. Without any car in it.

Prayer is really cool. It’s a two-way conversation. And in the case of me, most always a ""one-way"" conversation; but he hears me; and knows my petition and favours even before I'll ask them - he's just that good at it.  All because, he asked me, like, he asked everybody over the whole earth to ""Come unto him;"" ""Take a yoke upon me and learn of him"" (Matthew 11:28-30).

He's the authority. He asked everybody to do this.  And?

The Bible says: In James 1:19 “Wherefore, my beloved brethren, *let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak..”* Because, God already decreed: “*Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.” - The Word of God.* \- Jesus Christ. (Matthew 4:4).  Prayer includes HEARING the Judge or the car that comes in the volume of the car owner's manual; but you got it as if the owner's manual does it, without any car come with it.

* It’s a decree how the Court operates. So, ANY Prosecutor has to believe in the Judge is the authority over all things. That he’s holy; righteous; and he’s merciful - showing it to 1000s that love him..if you love him, you just do what he says, because it operates right; righteous.
   * But if you don’t - all **hate** means is simple. (Collins) 1. *Just be unwilling or unable to be or do (something).*
   * When EVERYBODY “For all have sinned” - Bible. Romans 3:23 Has to come to him as Job 33:27–30 says: About any man that would do this: He will DO THIS. This is how he “operates.”
* “*He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not; He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light. Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man, To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.”*
* Says the same to everybody - all the same over the whole earth: to the very ends of it, says: “**Look unto me, and be ye saved all the ends of the earth: For I am God, there is none else.” - God. (Bible. Isaiah 45:22)**
   * If any man say otherwise than this…doesn’t look unto him, wouldn’t be walking after, to walk in to do what he says.. is like a car owner’s manual. Making all kinds of claims, but doesn’t have any actual car that does anything with it. Just a bunch of petitions, that don’t have an car in it. Is that you?
      * Send you away *empty handed. Cursed.*

1pdov3s,https://www.reddit.com/r/OdysseyBookClub/comments/1pdov3s/6_rare_habits_that_instantly_raise_your_social/,6 Rare HABITS That Instantly Raise Your Social Status (Without Trying Too Hard),"Ever notice how some people walk into a room and instantly command respect, while others fade into the background? It’s not just charisma or good looks. After diving into behavioral science books, psych research, podcast convos with psychologists, and waaaay too many TikToks of people pretending to be sociopaths for clout, I’ve learned this: social status is a skill. It can be built. But it’s rarely what influencers say it is.

No, you don’t need to dominate every conversation, fake alpha energy, or wear $800 sneakers. Most viral tips are either outdated or just straight-up performative nonsense. If you’re done with the gimmicks and want real habits that *actually* elevate how people perceive you — in friend circles, on dates, and even at work — here’s your blueprint.

Let’s get into 6 surprisingly rare habits that boost your social status organically (and silently impress everyone around you).

---

## 1. Learn to “hold the frame” in conversation

People with high social value don’t rush to agree with everyone. They have a clear opinion. They don’t overexplain. They don’t wobble when someone disagrees. That’s called “holding the frame.”

- In simple terms: You let people into your worldview instead of constantly adapting to theirs.
- Example: If someone criticizes your favorite book or interest, you don’t shrink. You respond calmly, maybe even with curiosity — but you don’t immediately try to justify or defend.

According to psychologist Dr. David Buss (in his research on social hierarchy in evolutionary psychology), one key signal of social dominance is the ability to stay composed and centered during social conflict. You don’t need to “win” — you just need to look solid.

Recommended podcast: Lex Fridman’s interview with Chris Voss, former FBI negotiator, where he talks about “tactical empathy” and power in conversation.

---

## 2. Master the art of strategic silence

Most people overtalk. Especially when they’re nervous. High-status people? They know when NOT to speak. Silence after making a point makes it stronger. Silence before answering makes you look thoughtful.

- Try this: After someone asks you a question, take 2–3 seconds before answering. It signals confidence and depth.
- Pro tip: Use pauses instead of filler words. Instead of “uhh” or “like,” just… stop talking. Then continue.

In the book The Charisma Myth by Olivia Fox Cabane (Wall Street Journal bestseller, based on her lectures at Stanford and MIT), she explains how presence + power + warmth = charisma. Pausing before you speak oozes all three.

---

## 3. Speak in outcomes, not just opinions

People listen to those who can simplify complexity. So, when you talk about ideas, get used to ending your point with a takeaway. Not just ""I think"", but “Here’s what it means.”

Example:

- Low-impact: “I don’t really trust AI. It’s weird.”
- High-impact: “AI’s moving fast, and if we don’t regulate it soon, it may be harder to audit it later.”

This subtle difference makes you sound more grounded and thoughtful.

One study published in the Journal of Language and Social Psychology found that listeners perceived speakers who used “summary-driven” speech patterns as more competent and trustworthy.

---

## 4. Be insanely good at remembering names (and using them naturally)

This sounds basic. But it’s a superpower almost no one uses. Using someone’s name in conversation (without overdoing it) makes people feel seen. It instantly personalizes the interaction.

- At networking events or social situations, make a mini game out of it. Associate their name with a visual or sound in your head.
- Use their name once when they introduce themselves, once during the convo, and once when you say bye.

Dale Carnegie wrote in How to Win Friends & Influence People (a timeless bestseller that influenced generations of leaders) that “a person’s name is, to that person, the sweetest sound in any language.” Still holds up — maybe even more now, when attention is rare.

---

## 5. Develop a signature taste

People remember you for what you repeatedly showcase. Having a specific interest — that’s real, not forced — builds personal mythos. You don't need 17 hobbies. Just one that you're genuinely into and can talk about with passion.

- Could be niche fashion, 90s anime, old-school jazz, martial arts, specialty coffee, silent films — whatever.
- Signal this subtly. Don’t brag. Just let it emerge naturally over time.

Having a signature taste makes you memorable. Identity psychologist Dan McAdams argued that “people judge your character unconsciously based on the consistency of your personal narrative.” In plain English: the more distinct and consistent your interests, the more people feel like they “get” who you are.

---

## 6. Don’t chase status — curate it

This is the paradox. People with real presence don’t try so hard to look cool. They don’t seek validation. They signal value by curating their energy, attention and time.

Here’s what that looks like:

- You leave a social setting on your terms, not when everyone’s already bored.
- You don’t cling to every invite. You pick a few events and show up with full engagement.
- You’re kind, but you have boundaries. You say no without overexplaining.

Harvard researcher Dr. Amy Cuddy, in her viral TED talk and book Presence (NYT bestseller), said that true confidence comes from internal alignment, not trying to prove yourself. When you stop needing external praise, your presence becomes more magnetic.

---

### Some tools that help you build this energy:

- Ash app (for relationship dynamics and emotional coaching): Ash is like your personal therapist in your pocket. Trained in psychology-backed scripts, it helps you navigate awkward convos, relationship anxiety, and maintain boundaries. Deeply underrated.
- Finch (habit-building but cute): This app gamifies personal growth by helping you build consistency in micro-habits. Helpful if you want to cultivate any of the behaviors above.
- BeFreed (a personalized audio learning app): Recently went viral on X (1M+ views) and for good reason. Built by AI experts from Google and Columbia grads, BeFreed turns books, expert interviews, and research into personalized podcast lessons tailored to your goals. I use it to dive deep into topics like status games, social dynamics, and persuasive communication. You can set the episode length (10-min summary or a 40-min deep dive), choose the tone and voice (mine’s a chill, calming narrator), and even ask mid-episode questions. It’s like having a personal mentor in your ears. No brainer for any lifelong learner. Just use it and thank me.
- YouTube: “Charisma on Command” channel has solid breakdowns of how public figures handle interviews, conflict, persuasion — worth a binge.
- Podcast: Hidden Brain by Shankar Vedantam. Thought-provoking episodes on social psychology, group dynamics, and why we act the way we do.

### Book rec: This one changed everything for me

The book? The Status Game by Will Storr. It’s a Sunday Times bestseller. Storr is an award-winning journalist and psychology writer. This book will make you question everything you think you know about why humans do what they do — and how much of it is just subconscious status-chasing. He explains how religious groups, billionaires, influencers, and even everyday friendships all revolve around invisible status signals. Insanely insightful read. This is the best psychology book I’ve ever read on status.

If you read it with intention, you’ll never engage with your social world the same way again.

One in particular, let's call him Mark, I find attractive. We've chatted when he's waited on me before, but I just took it as good customer service. 

It was different this last time I went in. I sat at the bar like I normally do and was greeted by another bartender. As I sat down, Mark shouts from the other end of the restaurant, ""Oh hey! Didn't we just see you last week?"" He then came and chatted with me several times in between him running and taking orders. We just had some pretty bad weather, so we talked about that, which led to him showing me pictures of his dad's property that got a lot of snow. He then talked about his own family some more. If he got called to do something, he always assured me that he'd be back to finish the conversation. And I was getting a flirty vibe from him, too. 

Now I know it's a bit of a faux pas to ask someone in the service industry for a date while they're on the clock, and I'm not sure how to properly navigate it. I'm thinking if I see him again, and we still have some decent conversation considering he's at work, that I would just write my number on the back of the receipt, give it to him on my way out, and tell him to message me if he's interested in grabbing a drink or coffee sometime. However, I don't want to be that awkward guy that comes in and has a reputation for flirting with the staff, especially since I really like that restaurant. 

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.

1pdolfs,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1pdolfs/affair_for_25_years/,Affair for 2.5 years.,"I (married) had a long, messy affair with a close friend (also married). We knew each other for about four years before anything sexual happened. Once it did, we agreed it would be “monogamous” between us (besides our spouses). Feelings eventually got involved. She told me she loved me. I said it back.

The dynamic worked… until it didn’t.

We would meet up often for coffee, talk for about an hour, then have sex. It was fun, exciting, and we meshed perfectly — both in conversation and sexually. We hung out constantly with our spouses and group of friends because we loved being around each other. There were times she would cry about how badly she needed me. She sent nudes often as “gifts,” but really they were ego boosts. She loved the sexual bond we had and how desired she felt. She even told some of her close friends about us — they noticed how happy she seemed.

But then everything shifted.

She started protecting herself by disconnecting emotionally — almost like she didn’t want to allow the possibility of a real future with me. She would go long stretches without wanting sex or meeting up — weeks to months — yet we’d still see each other when our friend groups were together. Then suddenly out of nowhere she’d text asking for sex or just a quick release from foreplay. She bragged about how good I am, constantly complimented my dick — yet she’d also tell me about how she almost met up with another guy but he bailed last minute. That drove me nuts. I’d get jealous but tried playing it cool on the outside.

I couldn’t figure out why she needed other options when I was right there.

I needed reassurance that I was still the only one she was having sex with. Our secret relationship became exhausting because of how up and down she was. One moment she’d make me feel desired — kissing me secretly when we went out with friends — then go silent for days. I felt tortured. I would confess my love hoping she’d reciprocate, and she would dismiss it by saying, “I know, but you have to disassociate like I do.”

Things said she knew would hurt me:

After sex in my truck once, she started crying — questioning how her life would’ve been if she married this one guy she knew before her husband. It hurt me hearing this knowing she didn’t feel this way for me at all. She ended it with “I know you don’t like hearing this and I’m sorry.”

At one point, I told her I was done and just wanted friendship. I told her to find someone else as a FWB. She said no — that she keeps choosing me because I can fuck really good and I’m convenient. She didn’t want to explain her situation to a random guy.

I would get random texts from her saying she just got banged out really good by her husband. I told her to respect my boundaries and to never tell me that shit again. It didn’t make sense because our affair started due to her husband being terrible in bed and not taking care of her needs. Plus, he wasn’t even close to being as well endowed as me or able to give her the sexual connection that we had.

This went on for 2.5 years.

I got depressed from the lack of reciprocation. It felt like unrequited love. One day I blew up and accused her of finding a new supply. She insisted there wasn’t anyone else, but she held the accusation over my head and refused to accept any apology afterward. Months passed. I tried apologizing again and again — genuine and sincere — but she rejected all attempts.

Weeks passed and we planned a date night with friends. Naturally she was there. We bar-hopped and she made constant sexual innuendos toward me. She dressed sexy on purpose. It was like she wanted me to remember what I was missing — and punish me. We still had a lot of unresolved issues so she was snappy and rude to me so I told her in front of her husband and my wife, “if you aren’t my wife or my girl, you have no right to disrespect me or talk to me in that way, now turn around and get the fuck moving”. She looked at her husband for protection and he didn’t budge at all. So she stormed off.

Later that night I received a text from her husband, painting me as the bad guy. She manipulated my text and used them to say I was making advances at her. She never told him her part in all of this. So I sent him pictures of our conversations and her asking me for meetups and sex. I haven’t heard from Her since.

Thanks and kudos to you if you lasted this long to read all the way through.

My questions for women to answer, please be honest:

• Have you ever been in a similar situation — married, involved in a long affair, pulling the other person close and then pushing them away?

• Looking back, what was actually going on in your head?

• Did you truly love the person, or were they just meeting needs your spouse wasn’t?

• Did you see the other person as “supply” even if you said you loved them?

• When you ended it, did you think about them afterward or regret how you treated them?

• Did you ever feel guilty about the emotional damage you caused?

• Will she ever reach out to me? ",1,1764816607.0,adultery,9,0.56,False
1pdoldn,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1pdoldn/mf_the_porch/,[MF] The Porch,"Over the years, I've devoted a lot of thought to how time passes on this porch. Now I wish it would slip away. I'm stuck here, with one less blood vessel to my brain than I had years ago. It is not a bad place to be paralyzed. I overlook a lifetime of memories. I see her grave, and I see the woodchips under the magnolia, all out of place. It's the perfect spot for a garden to go.

When she passed, the stress tore me down. Tending to her grave was a light in the void. She deserved every perfect detail. I spent days and nights picking weeds, removing fallen leaves, and even setting woodchips around the mulch in the correct directions. I had set out to build a perfect garden, and finally had every detail in place. The kids peered from the windows.

The day I was going to start planting, I felt the numbness. The sweat from the beating sun began to feel electric on my face. I turned to the house. One of the kids was watching me. I yelled at him. I faltered over my words. He sprinted out. I collapsed at his feet. We drove into the darkness of the night, and followed the fluorescent yellow among the black roads to the hospital.

Now my final resting place is only 20 yards from hers. Not a single plant there. I'm stuck looking at woodchips, all in the wrong direction.

I think my sons had the right idea, setting me out, each evening, with the best view in our world. I sit here each day wanting to leap toward her. I want to run out like she did with the kids, each day, toward the bus, before school. Despite my best effort, my legs won't move.

In elementary school, that rusty bus delivered elation to the family each day. The kids loved school. It became routine for us to all stand, noses glued on the window, afraid any words would cut the tension. When the bus came within view, I knew I could return to my work, to the pressing mail I cannot remember now. But the rest, they would all patter and wobble around before rushing out the door, their mother included.

I never once jumped off this porch and I sure as shit won't now. The afternoon drags on slowly out here when you're unable to partake in it. The sun freezes on the horizon and the coffee keeps its warmth, one day passes after another. I only wish I could keep her close, like we used to before the kids.

That first day we moved in, the evening shade moved in from the horizon towards the new center of our world. Where the shallow hills, long road, and sparse trees all meet, we sat together and saw that shade sneak towards us. I remember how we waited here, on this porch. After a day of carelessly passing the time, there was silence. We moved closer. The light that the dark had erased was renewed by her warmth. She whispered to me, and it felt like my ear froze. I pulled her in tighter and kept my silence.

The magnolia tree and the buzzing flies are the only ones that keep me company out here, now. The kids are constantly working in the house. I long for that time when she whispered to my heart, or when the cacophony this house was filled with first arrived.

I had forgotten how silence echoed in this house since the day we brought our second son home. We stunned our walking toddler with his newborn little brother. The boy looked curiously at first, like he was missing his magnifying glass, and made his mother burst out with laughter. The image of the boy reaching for his kid brother to lift him up is imprinted in my mind. I retreated to the quiet inside to watch the news as our oldest son and his mother vibrated the walls with laughter for at least an hour.

When the evening comes, and the flies leave me alone, and the wind is dead, I can still hear that muffled laughter. It's like the magnolia tree leans in and echoes it back to me as it remembers it, after all of these years.

The magnolia tree has only proven to be my closest friend in old age. The flies, however, are my number one enemy. The worst inconvenience to my immobile life is the inability to swat the flies. They used to pry at me, but now I think they have realized I can't fight back. They practically live on me now. The only relief I feel is when that shade starts creeping in and the fireflies start lighting up. I know the gnats are soon gone, mosquitos are another story.

That creeping shade brought plenty of new discoveries for our young guys, years ago. They also used to complain of gnats and mosquitoes. They would chase any nagging critters out of the house with a fly swatter, me directly behind them to scoop them up and turn them around. I remember my stomach tightening when they left the front stairs, like they were never gonna stop running away.

Other times brought good discoveries. The chaos that ensued with firefly season, for instance. The boys weaved around the magnolia tree and their heads swiveled from one bug's light to another, never able to focus for long. She was right there with them. I remember how the humidity used to penetrate that screen door from where I watched. It used to sit on my skin like a coating of superglue and I would have to retreat to the kitchen. They would all come in soon after, covered in sweat, and ready for a nighttime snack.

They are the ones preparing my food today. They trade off coming out on the hour to give me a snack. As odd as it seems, you take for granted being able to feed yourself. I don't long for using a fork and knife, but I miss the rituals of food. I would set the table and decide on the meal. I could direct the conversation, and if it was not to my liking, I could put the fork down and get back to my work. For dinner, we sit in the same spot still, out here on the porch as the magnolia tree leans closer to see what we are picking at.

We have always eaten on the porch. Rain or shine and no matter how late in the night it got. The headlights of her car coming up that long road was like a moving lighthouse. Sometimes, I could hear them, before the headlights. Whenever she went to pick them up from college on a long weekend, she would blast what she thought the current music was. They used to hate it.

I would have the porch all set and they would tumble out of the car directly to the table. As we ate, they would ask me questions about my college experience. I left out the good parts about the late nights and trouble she and I used to get into. I thought there would be plenty of time to tell them those stories. Some time when they were not as susceptible to their parents' words. I imagined the laughs we could share when I would tell them in the future. But at all our dinners, it was mostly simple sentences filled in between by soundless bites.

She had a knack for filling that void. She asked the right questions and ignited passion in our kids at the table. And her laugh, it roped you out of wherever you were venturing in your own mind and pulled you back to the present. She made every moment feel more important than the last, and it was only in the stillness that I could find the time to appreciate it. And it was in that stillness that I looked forward to her next act, which would almost assuredly occur as soon as you thought of it.

When she first was diagnosed, I could sense those silences lengthening. First I could only tell when watching intently. In between two moments she would fleet away and return with a blink. She fought like hell though. Lived her life as she had for the past 50 years, like each day was her last. Soon, though, the lulls lengthened and the calm started feeling more like a tension. As strong as she was, the disease was unrelenting.

We used to sit on the porch in the evenings, when she got sick, and time had never gone by as quickly. Taking one another in each others' arms was no longer strong enough to outlast the cold of the night. The cold pushed us inside. Her agonizing cries of pain echo in my head like a fire alarm for the past 5 years. The long bouts of weakness in between, where she did not have the strength to even ask for help, those are the details that deliver my worst pains to this day.

We buried her out by the magnolia. Dug all day in the rain. The soil was wet and easy to shovel. I was giving instructions on where to direct the dirt, and telling the kids not to hit the gas lines. I was getting old, and could not dig as well as them. The oldest had heaped some dirt on my feet, he turned to me and sobbed.

He said something that is imprinted in my mind alongside the other family memorabilia. He told me his mother would say she loved him all the time and he looked deep into my eyes. There was such a gravity behind his glossed over eyes it distorted time. And I froze. I patted him on the back, turned on a heel, and walked inside. We buried her a few hours later.

So now, my permanent shade has finally arrived. The days I spend out here now are stacked against a lifetime of sitting here, me and her. Now, it's just me. Alone with my thoughts. Listening to the flies buzz and the leaves wave. Unable to partake. Patiently waiting.

I hear the kids talk about what they'll do soon enough. One wants to raise his own family here, the other can't bear the difficult memories. So they argue about what I would want, what she would want. They argue until the dusk becomes black. That's when the oldest comes for me.

""You ready pops?""

And that's the time, everyday, I pray to God. I pray to him to give me strength. The strength she had been beaming with. Just for a moment and just for a small act. With every ounce I could, I pleaded from deep in my heart for the ability to reach out. To touch my oldest son's face just like the first day I met him. To get a good look at his eyes that came from his better half and to see the grin that would be so recognizable from the days they chased fireflies. But I called on God long after the sun fell beyond the furthest hills. And with the sun gone, I assumed God had gone too, because all I felt was the ache in my throat. Silence sat in the air. So today, yesterday, and all the days I have known him, my best efforts fall short once more.

I moved into The Ellison about a week ago and figured I’d share my experience so far in case anyone in the area is curious about the new complex.

# 1) Leasing & Move-In

The leasing team was easy to work with, and move-in itself went smoothly. They seem responsive and pretty helpful whenever I’ve had questions.

# 2) Amenities

Just a heads-up: the amenities aren’t open yet. That includes the gym, pool, podcast studio, coffee area, and grab-and-go market. They mentioned these should start opening in the near future, but for now everything is still under construction.

# 3) Construction

The property has three buildings total. Two are fully residential, and the third is the main amenities building. Some areas around the third building are still under construction, so expect workers, noise during the day, and the occasional blocked-off section. Some people are already living in that building though, so some parts must be finished.

# 4) The Apartment Itself

My unit has been great so far. Everything inside is brand new, with modern appliances and a keypad entry door. I haven’t run into any issues with the interior or maintenance. Sound-wise, I haven’t heard much from neighbours (although I’m not sure I have any right next to me yet).

# Overall

Even with the unfinished amenities, I’ve been pretty happy with the place so far. Just wanted to share an honest first-week impression for anyone who’s seen the new construction and wondered what it’s like living here.

It's actually been a few weeks since I made the final payment to clear out the last of my nine federal student loans. I wasn't going to post about it because I'm not sure if anyone cares, but my excitement bubbled up after receiving the letter this morning confirming my $0 balance.

I graduated a decade ago with just over $26,000 in student loans. I had no financial support from my parents and paid my own way through college, working full time while also trying to tackle credit card debit that piled up from a couple of out-of-state, unpaid summer internships. 

My first job out of college paid just $37,000, and for years, I could really only afford to pay the minimum on my student loans. By 2019, the interest was really starting to stack up. The extra payments I made — $20 here, $15 there — barely made a dent. So although my total loan balance was far smaller than some of the numbers I've come across on this subreddit, it still often felt like an impossible hurdle to overcome because of my low income and other debts.

And then 2020 happened. Unexpectedly, I had extra room in my monthly budget because of the pause on student loan payments. I never imagined that the pause would stretch on for as long as it did. But in that time, I hopped jobs and more than doubled my income. I paid off my credit card debt that had snowballed ever since those unpaid internships. I was putting money away into a HYSA for my loans. But just as things started to look up, the announcement came about the $20K forgiveness plan. I qualified, applied and was approved, so I used the money I put away in my HYSA on a down payment for a car. I think we all know what happened next...

Fast-forward to the SAVE administrative forbearance. As frustrated as I was about all the uncertainty around the plan, I decided to view it as a second chance to get ahead! While interest was paused, I once again started putting money away into my HYSA. In January, I set the goal to have enough saved to clear my outstanding $19K balance before the forbearance ended. I committed to a ""no buy"" challenge for the year and started budgeting/tracking all my transactions for the first time in my life. Every extra dollar I had went toward my student loan fund. My credit card's cashback rewards were also deposited into my HYSA. I can't believe how quickly it came together once I locked in on this goal.

  
In the process, I managed to rewire my relationship with money and spending. I no longer ""crave"" shopping. I'm thoughtful about how, when and where I spend my money. I stopped eating out all the time and ""treating"" myself to coffee every morning. I was able to knock out my student loans while also fully funding an emergency fund and maxing out, for the first time ever, my Roth IRA.

I worked really hard to pay these loans off, but I also fully recognize how unbelievably lucky I was to have had an unprecedented pause on student loan payments and a zero interest period happen back-to-back. I think my situation today would look vastly different if not for those two things. Wishing everyone the best on their debt payoff journeys! ❣️",22,1764816193.0,StudentLoans,2,1.0,False

I don’t sit in a desk all day. I move. I eat. I talk. I walk. I drink coffee. I take Nuvigil.

I love my nieces and nephews and wouldn’t hurt their feelings for the world but jeez. I can’t anymore. 

My in-laws only talk about their kids. I can’t take it anymore. Everyone sits around the table waiting for them to finish talking about nothing and the parents brag on and on about their kids. It is good to do that to an extent but it is to the exclusion of everyone else. 

Do all aunts and uncles hang on every syllable of their nieces and nephews for hours on end? I want to talk to my adult family too. Am I the only one suffering through a 4th grader obviously lying in his story once again while everyone applauds him or her?

The last year I’ve slightly pulled back from them b/c I noticed the relationships were one sided. 

I was asked to host and organize most of the family events. I got birthday and Christmas lists sent to me, I was invited to all the kid’s milestones but not the adult ones. 

This year I reached out several times to some of them only to be ghosted or put off with the vague- “yes let’s get a coffee soon”. But babysitting, dog sitting, helping with setting up events or doing the planning and hosting it’s on me. I love that stuff. 

So I ghosted a text from someone who ignored mine, I sent the same bday text I got instead of a call and gift. I haven’t reached out. 

And guess what? Radio silence. They really don’t care. Am I the annoying and desperate old Aunty?  Am I selfishly transactional?

I love my nieces and nephews but I really want to back off most of the school plays, recitals and games - not all but most. Thank you for your feedback.

I decided to go into the café and get a cup of coffee. I’ve been in there maybe 3-4 times in the past, all pre-Covid, and the owner was nice enough. Not deep conversations but he was friendly and told me he was from Greece. 

So I went inside and he was behind the counter with his back to me, doing something. There was one other customer up at the front of the store by the window, reading a newspaper. I stood at the counter for a second, and the owner turned around and saw me. He didn’t say anything, just went back to whatever he was doing. Then someone came in the back door with a box and handed it to him. They started speaking Greek to each other, which I don’t understand, but the new guy gestured to me and clearly said something like, “you have a customer here.” The café owner waved at me dismissively, like “nah.” The guy seemed a little surprised by that. Finally I just slowly walked out of the store. It was so awkward. Why completely ignore a customer like that? It felt personal, but maybe I’m too sensitive.

This is my personal experience combined with extensive research on managing GERD/LPR through diet. Always consult with your healthcare provider.

After 2.5 years battling LPR and GERD, I've learned that **knowing what's wrong is only half the battle**—the other half is knowing exactly what to eat, when to eat it, and how to track what works for YOUR body.

# The Missing Piece: Meal Timing & Food Combinations

Everyone talks about low-acid diets, but nobody explains the crucial details that make or break your healing:

# The 3-Hour Rule

Your last meal should be 3+ hours before lying down. But here's what most people miss: **not all ""safe"" foods are safe at night**. Even low-acid foods can trigger reflux if they're slow to digest.

**Best Evening Foods (digest in 2-3 hours):**

* White fish (cod, tilapia, flounder)
* Skinless chicken breast
* Egg whites
* Well-cooked zucchini or carrots
* White rice (small portion)
* Oatmeal (without milk if you're sensitive)

**Avoid After 5 PM:**

* Red meat (takes 4-6 hours to digest)
* Nuts and seeds
* Raw vegetables
* Any fried foods
* Cheese or high-fat dairy

# Morning Routine That Reduces Symptoms 80%

This transformed my mornings from mucus-filled misery to manageable:

**Upon Waking (Empty Stomach):**

1. Warm water with 1/4 tsp sea salt (helps acid production)
2. Wait 20 minutes
3. Take Betaine HCL supplement (if your test showed low acid)
4. Wait 10 more minutes

**Breakfast (30 min after waking):**

* 2-3 scrambled eggs (cooked in small amount of olive oil)
* 1/2 cup cooked oats OR 1 slice sourdough toast (fermented = lower histamine)
* Small portion of low-histamine fruit (fresh blueberries, not bananas)
* Herbal tea (ginger or chamomile, lukewarm not hot)

**Why this works:** Protein + moderate carbs + fat balance keeps you full, provides amino acids for gut healing, and doesn't spike blood sugar (which feeds candida).

# The Food Combination Rules Nobody Mentions

**DO NOT MIX:**

* Proteins + High-starch carbs in large amounts (steak + potato = digestive nightmare)
* Multiple high-histamine foods in one meal (tomatoes + aged cheese + wine = inflammation bomb)
* Cold drinks with meals (dilutes stomach acid)

**DO COMBINE:**

* Protein + non-starchy vegetables (chicken + steamed broccoli)
* Healthy fats + vegetables (olive oil on salad)
* Small portion starch + vegetables (rice + green beans)

# Weekly Meal Structure for Low Acid, Low Histamine, Low Carb

# Monday - Thursday (Strict Healing Phase)

**Breakfast Options:**

* Egg white omelet with zucchini and a little olive oil
* Overnight oats (soaked, not raw) with fresh blueberries
* Rice porridge with a pinch of salt and cooked apple

**Lunch Options:**

* Grilled chicken breast with steamed carrots and green beans
* White fish with quinoa and roasted butternut squash
* Turkey meatballs (fresh ground, not processed) with rice and cucumber

**Dinner Options:**

* Baked cod with mashed sweet potato and asparagus
* Chicken soup (homemade broth) with rice noodles and celery
* Ground turkey with cauliflower rice and cooked spinach

**Snacks (if needed):**

* Rice cakes with thin layer of almond butter
* Fresh melon (small amount)
* Herbal crackers with hummus (small portion)

# Friday - Sunday (Maintenance with 80/20 rule)

Follow the same base, but you can try reintroducing ONE potentially triggering food per day to test tolerance. Track everything.

# The Supplement Schedule That Made the Difference

**Timing matters as much as the supplements themselves:**

**Morning (with breakfast):**

* Betaine HCL (start with 1 capsule, work up to 2-3)
* Zinc (25mg)
* Vitamin D3 + K2

**Lunch (with meal):**

* Digestive enzymes (full spectrum)
* Butyric acid (500mg)

**Dinner (with meal):**

* Betaine HCL (lower dose than breakfast)
* Digestive enzymes

**Before Bed:**

* Probiotic (start with 1-2 billion CFU, not the high-dose ones that cause inflammation)
* L-Glutamine powder (5g in water - repairs gut lining)

# Tracking: The Secret Weapon

Here's what changed everything: **I started tracking every single meal and symptom.**

Within 2 weeks, I discovered:

* I could tolerate oats but not wheat
* Cucumber gave me more mucus (high histamine when not super fresh)
* Eating after 7 PM = guaranteed reflux next morning
* Coffee substitutes (chicory) were actually worse than no coffee at all

**Track These Daily:**

* Each meal (with times)
* Symptoms (throat mucus, reflux, breathing issues) - rate 1-10
* Bowel movements (consistency = gut health indicator)
* Sleep quality
* Stress levels
* Supplement timing

# The Foods I Thought Were Safe But Weren't

These shocked me when I finally tracked properly:

❌ **Bananas** \- High histamine when ripe, caused throat tightness ❌ **Spinach** \- High oxalate, increased mucus ❌ **Bone broth** \- High histamine despite being ""healing"" ❌ **Avocado** \- High histamine, triggered inflammation ❌ **Leftovers over 24 hours old** \- Histamine increases in stored food ❌ **""Healthy"" smoothies** \- Cold + mixed food = digestive chaos

# My Current 70% Improvement Protocol

**Daily Non-Negotiables:**

1. Baking soda test once per week (tracking acid levels)
2. No food 3.5 hours before bed
3. Elevated bed (6-inch risers under head)
4. Stress management (10 min meditation daily)
5. Detailed food journal

**Weekly Tasks:**

* Meal prep on Sunday (fresh food = lower histamine)
* Review symptom patterns
* Adjust one variable if needed
* Candida protocol check-in

# The Meal Prep Strategy That Saved Me Time

**Sunday Prep (2 hours):**

* Cook 3 proteins: chicken breast, white fish, ground turkey
* Steam vegetables: carrots, green beans, zucchini, broccoli
* Cook grains: white rice, quinoa (small amounts)
* Portion into containers for Mon-Thu

**Store Properly:**

* Freeze portions you won't eat within 24 hours (reduces histamine)
* Use glass containers (no plastic chemicals)
* Label with dates

# Resources That Help Track Progress

For anyone serious about healing, I cannot stress enough: **track everything**. Pattern recognition is how you'll find YOUR specific triggers.

I use a combination of spreadsheet tracking and photos of every meal. It sounds obsessive, but after 2 months, you'll have data that's more valuable than any generic diet plan.

[**I've found that keeping a detailed food journal with meal timing and symptom tracking has been essential—this newsletter shares more specific meal plans and tracking templates that have helped me**](https://gentlegourmet.app/newsletter)

# What's Next in My Journey

I'm now testing:

* Gradual reintroduction of fermented foods (sauerkraut in tiny amounts)
* Testing my histamine threshold with fresh fish
* Slowly increasing probiotic dose
* Adding specific anti-candida foods (coconut oil, garlic - carefully)

# The Bottom Line

The original post about low stomach acid, candida, and gut dysfunction is absolutely correct in my experience. But here's what I learned: **You can't heal what you don't track.**

The diet changes work, but only if you:

1. Know your baseline (acid test, symptom severity)
2. Track meals and symptoms religiously for at least 30 days
3. Make ONE change at a time
4. Give each change 1-2 weeks to show results
5. Don't give up when you have bad days (they're data points, not failures)

My symptoms decreased 70% in 3 months using this approach. I'm still healing, but I finally feel like I'm in control instead of the disease controlling me.

**Quick Start Checklist:**

*  Do the baking soda test tomorrow morning
*  Buy Betaine HCL and digestive enzymes this week
*  Clear out all high-histamine foods from kitchen
*  Set up a simple tracking system (notebook or app)
*  Prep first week of meals focusing on the safe foods listed
*  Schedule eating times (breakfast, lunch, early dinner)
*  Order bed risers or extra pillows

**Remember:** This is a journey, not a race. Every small improvement is progress. Your body CAN heal—it just needs the right environment and enough time.

What? I know many fine people who do good works and still drink alcohol. Have you ever tried any type of alcohol, in your life?   

The nun, taken aback, admits that she has never tried alcohol.   

Well, how can you condemn what you've never tried? Here, I'll go and get you something. If you try it and don't like it, then you can preach.   

Well, what should I try, says the nun?   

How about gin?  I know lots of ladies who like gin.   

Okay, but, can you put it in a coffee mug? You know, to be discreet.    

I go into the bar and order a beer and a double shot of gin and tell the bartender to put the gin in a coffee mug.
