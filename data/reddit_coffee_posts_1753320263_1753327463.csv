1m7tm9d,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1m7tm9d/i_graduated_yesterday_my_birth_story/,I graduated yesterday! My birth story,"It's been a bit of a whirlwind, and a bit challenging, but I wouldn't change it for the world!  
Funny enough, I had a late growth scan on Monday to see how big our baby girl was, and they measured her at 8lbs 1oz. I originally had an appointment earlier today to discuss what the plan would be based on this information. But then at 3:30am Tuesday morning, my water broke. Baby girl had other plans.  
I called the hospital, but they said there were no OBs on-staff that night, and to call back at 8am to see if anyone would be in, and to just monitor fetal movement or if I experienced any pain, to go to the nearest hospital.  
So we set an alarm and tried to go back to sleep. But between the sudden rush of adrenaline of my water breaking and the mild contractions that were starting, I didn't manage to get any more sleep.  
We called back at 8am, and they told us to go in and they could exam me and go from there. We had a quick breakfast and coffee, and off we went.  
They recommended inducing me to get things moving, because if I just waited for labour to happen naturally, it could take longer and only increases the risk of infection. They hooked up the IV with saline and pitocin, and we were off to the races. About an hour and a half later, they did a cervix check and said I was already 7-8cm dilated. So it was already too late for the option of an epidural.  
Then the contractions started getting intense, and fast. I am forever grateful for my partner being there beside me to help me through it.  
After a bit, they told me she wasn't quite low enough, so I had to help her along. And to do so, I had to hold my breath once a contraction happened, and ""push like you're trying to fart"", but not a full push. So I did, and it was getting to the point where I just had the urge to push. Then they told me it was time to actively start pushing.  
An hour later, and our baby girl made her appearance. And she was healthy. I was so relieved.  
Surprisingly, from the time my water broke to baby girl coming into this world, it took 13 and a half hours total. Active labour lasted about 5 hours, and I only pushed for 1 hour.  
I unfortunately burst several capillaries in my face and a bit on my chest. It looks like I had a bad reaction to some skin cream. We currently have to stay in the hospital longer than anticipated because her blood test results came back and her bilirubin number was high risk for jaundice, so they're currently doing UV light therapy on her.  
It's been a challenging couple of days, with lots to learn, but I'd do it all over again for her.",1,1753327345.0,pregnant,1,1.0,False

1m7tljc,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1m7tljc/very_long_lost_my_best_friend_and_feeling_more/,[VERY LONG] - Lost My Best Friend and Feeling More Alone Than Ever (could use some kindness but just wanted to put it out there to feel it),"I've tried to sit down and write this several dozen times it feels like. I've been alone for almost 3 years and have had to move at least once, sometimes twice, a year for 10 years now.

My best friend (C), her fianc√© (W), and I lived together for 7 of those years, moving every single year. It was fine because I had them and they were great people, but during the 7th year they broke up and my best friend moved out without even talking to me about it. I got a text asking to take care of him. I did, of course. I loved both of them.

She came back a couple weeks later crying as she hugged and apologized to me. It was so much anxiety off of my back. I was so relieved that she wasn't just gone. We talked it out and hung out many times over the next couple of months until W and I moved into a smaller place that was another 30 minutes away from C, who had moved to the city about an hour away.

It made seeing her hard, and I didn't have a car at the time because I worked from home and lived in an area with amazing public transit (rare, I know) I had a card for work even though I worked from home, so I rode for free always, so it made sense.

Anyway, C and I saw less and less of each other. I offered to come to her via bus, even though it was a 5-hour trip (though I didn't tell her that) or I'd offer to give her gas money for picking me up for a weekend. But that meant 3 hours on either end of the weekend. It was hard.

She was having issues with her antidepressants not working and was constantly getting new ones until she ran out. As a result of the constant side effects of her medications changing constantly, weeks or months without it, or when she started clinical trials for ketamine, things got really stressful.

I suffer from depression but not nearly on the same level as C, but I have terrible separation anxiety as well. Months of calling off plans last minute, getting mad at me about things then ruminating on them silently, and eventually yelling about something that we'd normally have laughed off in person, or played back and forth with over-the-top insults and whatnot, eventually wore me down.

I started getting angry back. Saying awful things, ignoring her, also ruminating on things. I started firing back more than she did to me and more consistently. I got lost in it.

We still tried to mend things and there were plenty of ""I love you"" moments between us and reminding each other it was just hard and we missed each other. I couldn't tell you who did it more often, but I meant it, and I believed she did too.

9 or 10 months of this, and we finally sat down in the same room. I hashed out all of my reasons and why I had been so upset and I apologized for very specific things and just for hurting her in general. I can't blame my anxiety alone, and I wouldn't try to excuse myself, so I apologize if it sounds like that.

She did the same and explained the trials and having her mom come stay with her because of suicidal thoughts. This is legitimately something she had happen alongside panic attacks and her seizures lately, and I had seen both plenty when we lived together.

We hugged in silence for a long time just crying. I felt so much weight off and we had made plans for her to come visit me since her and her family would be vacationing in Florida, near where I was going to live, and she wanted me to come with them. Her family knew that and she would often invite me to big life events. As a matter of fact, she always insisted I come, and they agreed. I was happy for a few days.

She died just 3 days later. Something about the ketamine and her seizure medication that I never got a clear answer on.

I was devastated. I didn't leave my room basically at all for the next week until I realized my cat needed food.

My roommate W, at this point, was not talking to me for several reasons. I had taken care of him and reintroduced him to new friends about 6 months prior and after I lost my job, I had been unemployed for 6 months and not having a car was becoming a problem, he stopped talking to me. He admitted to resenting me because I was a freeloader and decided he'd go out all the time and start sleeping around, until he met his current girlfriend who they would then ask me not to come out of my room while they were hanging out in the living room.

I told them that was fucking stupid and a terrible thing to ask, but there we were when they'd stare me down for walking out of the house or just into the kitchen to get water.

Anyway, with C dead and W not speaking to me, I was alone. More than I had ever been in my life. The constant moving and no car meant my friends were always an hour out and while a few visited me immediately to help, it didn't last more than 2 weeks.

I spent the rest of my lease alone in my room, unable to talk to the one person who might understand, but he was too bitter about their breakup and angry at me to care. He went on like nothing had changed.

I moved to Florida with my mother. It was supposed to be a short ""get back on my feet"" period, which turned into a year because I made plans to live with another friend in Ohio pretty early on, but it would be a year out, and that would give me time to get a car and save money.

I thought things would be better, but my grandmother who lives there too has dementia and I helped take care of her (which isn't a problem, but it was hard sometimes). My older brother was there and he is a bitter man with polarizing beliefs for lack of a better way to say it here who would yell at the top of his lungs whenever he could if anyone disagreed with him.

My depressed mother was just unable to stop to catch herself because of my grandmother and my older brother, who openly hates on her for ruining his marriage. She didn't, but he wants to blame someone that isn't himself or his ex-wife.

Whenever I'd talk to my grandmother, she'd forget I was speaking and walk off, or ask what I was talking about halfway through responding to her. It would often be as quick as 2 or 3 sentences, but she'd glaze over or forget.

My older brother couldn't hold a conversation without moving it to those polarizing things I mentioned like how our gay brother and his husband are dramatic and that violent crimes against ""his kind"" are overblown because they're such a low statistic compared to everyone else who gets murdered. MISSING THE POINT ENTIRELY.

I am bitter about him turning out the way he is, I'm sorry. But because of those things I couldn't talk to him peacefully or without him trying to gaslight me / convert me into hating our mother or convincing me our brother was a piece of shit.

My mother tried, but she was so depressed over her mom getting worse and my older brother disrespecting and badmouthing her to anyone who would listen that she didn't have it in her to talk to me without losing focus or having nothing to say.

I was alone again, and for a year this time. Closest I'd been with family in about a decade and I couldn't enjoy any time with them.

I moved to Ohio earlier this year. It was supposed to be a 14-hour drive over 2 days and then a day of recovery followed by going to a wedding as my friend's +1.

Her (K) and I had been friends for almost 15 years, and we even went on a few dates 2 years in, but we both agreed it wasn't gonna work and we didn't have it in us at the time and chose to remain friends.

We had been talking every day, almost all day over text, for about the whole year I was in Florida. I mean 6am to 12am almost EVERY DAY. It felt like we had become very close. We were joking around a lot in the same ways me and C did. I felt that hole being closed a little bit. It never will close fully.

I truly believe C was my platonic soul mate. I've never had a friend like her and don't believe I ever will, but this felt like something that was missing had come back and it was immensely comforting after so much time. K and I made many plans to binge shows, go on trips, and to introduce to some of the friends I met when she invited me to her group chat after it seemed like I got along really well with them.

The time of the move came and my boss asked me to give up one of the days because he mismanaged the PTO but said it was fine if not. I said it was fine and I'd leave a day late. Still had time to get there with some rest.

But then K told me she had gotten the date wrong and that it was the next day after I left at like 9am. I should have said I couldn't make the wedding, but I wanted to keep my word to her and I proceeded to drive it all in one day.

Though I didn't drive 14 hours. I drove 19. I left at 8:30AM and got there at 3:30AM. I got stuck in Atlanta for several hours, but I made it in one drive. I stopped 6 times for about 15 minutes at a time just because I needed to.

I didn‚Äôt go to the wedding and I nearly slept for 12 hours.

K and I talked about hanging out on Monday after she was done with the wedding and family stuff, and that was fine by me.

Monday comes and she says she has plans. I thought, okay, I'm new here and she probably got swept up in the excitement of me being there and forgot she had plans. That was fine to me. I just got there and was a new addition, so it made sense that she probably forgot.

She suggested Thursday or Friday, and I said Thursday because I had plans Friday. Cool, we had the game plan.

Wednesday comes by, I hadn‚Äôt seen her basically at all because of her job, by the way, and I suggest seeing a movie the next day because Thunderbolts was apparently pretty good for a Marvel movie.

She said, ‚ÄúMy Sunday should be free,‚Äù and I asked, ‚ÄúWhat about Thursday? We had plans?‚Äù and she said, ‚ÄúYeah, my Sunday is probably good‚Äù again.

I made a passive-aggressive joke saying, ‚ÄúOof, I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd have to wait all week to hang out with you haha‚Äù and started walking toward my room a bit.

She looked at me with the most disgusted look I have ever seen someone use on me in my life. Not that it‚Äôs happened, but it was completely jarring. She just says, ‚ÄúI thought you just needed a roommate,‚Äù and walks off.

I was stunned. I had no idea what that meant.

Saturday rolls by, and we had talked a bit here and there, had a few good laughs, so I thought my anxiety had just spiked for a moment and it was cool.

I asked if we were still on for the next day during the evening and she texts me, ‚ÄúDo you even want to hang out?‚Äù as part of her message, which really confused me.

The rest of the text fucked with my head because what she was referring to was a joke regarding some fuzzy cuffs she pulled out of a dresser while cleaning. I had made some comment about ‚Äúplaying dress up‚Äù that was just in the moment and we laughed about it.

We had both said much ‚Äúworse‚Äù things to each other over the last year. Nothing ever aggressive or inappropriate, just basic ‚Äúoho someone likes to play‚Äù kind of stuff. This wasn‚Äôt even graphic, just a comment about playing dress-up to the extreme. Stupid and probably not funny, but we shared a laugh because it was stupid.

Anyway, she says in this text, ‚ÄúI gotta be honest I did not appreciate the comments when I was getting the rest of my stuff out of my drawers.‚Äù

I, not remembering, text back ‚Äúcomments?‚Äù because nothing registered in my head regarding it. It was such a throwaway line. I decided I didn‚Äôt want to go over it in text and immediately walked upstairs after and asked her what was up. She told me about it.

I apologized. I said:

‚ÄúI apologize. That was definitely not my intent. We had both made tons of jokes like that and we both laughed about that specifically. I had no idea you had been holding onto that for a couple of days.‚Äù

I said more about how we had made worse jokes in DMs over the last year so it didn‚Äôt feel out there, but regardless of what I think, I apologized. It wasn‚Äôt my intention to hurt her feelings.

She said thank you, but then also, and this crushed me, ‚ÄúYou make me feel uncomfortable and you came on too strongly.‚Äù

I‚Äôve never been told my friendliness makes anyone uncomfortable before. Not to mention, I basically hadn‚Äôt seen her. I bought coffee for both of us twice, but that was because she recommended some places and I thought I‚Äôd repay her for the suggestions and it‚Äôd be nice as a new roommate.

But besides those moments and following up on when she wanted to hang out, I didn‚Äôt see her except for less than 5 minutes a day where I generally just would say hi and ask how her day was.

To be told I make her uncomfortable and that I came on too strongly... OBLITERATED me. I asked how and what I was doing that made her feel that way and she said ""I don't know"" and I suggested just shelving it for now and talking about it in the morning so she had time to process if need be. She said ok. The next day she brushed off my attempts to ask about it saying she had a long day. I never got an apology.

I‚Äôm still upset about it 3 months later as I‚Äôm getting ready to move out. We didn‚Äôt hang out that Sunday. I decided I wanted to take a day or so to myself and meet other people.

From that point on though, she actively walked away if I said hello and would never engage me if I asked how she was doing. She‚Äôd never return that politeness or listen when I told her about some weird thing I found exploring the city.

She would either walk away or start looking at her phone partway through and I‚Äôd have to ask after a few seconds if she was there, and she‚Äôd go ‚Äúyeah sorry‚Äù then go back to her phone after I repeated myself. This would be one or two times and then I‚Äôd walk away, and she‚Äôd say sorry but never ask further.

I dropped a 20lb weight on my foot at the gym and had a severe limp. I asked her to help out if I needed to go to the doctor and to get some ice packs. She didn‚Äôt even ask if I was okay and just kept looking at her phone and didn't answer.

In the 3 months I‚Äôve been here, she has never come to me to talk about anything, chat when we see each other, or even invited me to hang out. I would sometimes pop by her room when she was just scrolling her phone to say what‚Äôs up when her door was open. I did that several times over a couple of months and her door has remained closed since.

I‚Äôve felt more alone than ever because now I‚Äôm a stranger living with someone who seemingly resents me and won‚Äôt look at me. I live in my room alone and roam an empty house on occasion. I‚Äôve met some people in the city, but no one I‚Äôd call a new friend really. I‚Äôve been too depressed, and I‚Äôve slipped back into the same feeling as when C died.

I‚Äôve been miserable and alone here, and I drove 19 hours to have this be my life. I‚Äôm moving 10 hours away in about a week, but I just feel like crying and I can‚Äôt for some reason.

I‚Äôm so hurt from this on top of the last 2 years. I just don‚Äôt know how to function and I know I shouldn‚Äôt be airing all of this, but I‚Äôm at my wits‚Äô end and I feel completely alienated by K now and I don‚Äôt think the friendship is going to last after this.

But I honestly can‚Äôt tell what I did wrong.

Without C, I don‚Äôt have anyone close enough who has the emotional maturity to say more than ‚Äúthat sucks‚Äù and that‚Äôs not a dig on them because I love my other friends, but it‚Äôs not helpful and I don‚Äôt have anyone while I stew in the basement with my cat.

I feel broken and I can‚Äôt cry and it just sucks so badly. I don‚Äôt even have the words to describe how the last 2 1/2 years have been.

I don‚Äôt even know if this all makes sense or will read well. I just wrote it and needed to get it out there. I know it's very long and I appreciate anyone who read it.",1,1753327287.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

Hemifacial Spasm? Sinus Pressure?,"Hi all, in October 2024 I started to get intense sinus pressure and radiating headaches. I started having some tingling sensations on the left side of my face - around my mouth and cheek and some numbness too. I got a brain MRI to rule out anything sinister (because the pressure and headaches became so strong) in December 2024 which found that I had chronic sinusitis. I eliminated a lot of inflammatory foods from my diet and made sure I got a lot of rest etc and the pressure mainly subsided. 

3 months ago I started getting a persistent and fast twitch under my left eye. Very noticeable and has been something I‚Äôm feeling pretty self conscious about when socialising. I started to notice other twitches in different parts of my body but these are more random, short lived and move around. I‚Äôve been to the doctor and they have done some blood work to check Vitamin B levels and magnesium and all is fine. 

I‚Äôve looked into BFS but the under eye twitch seems too persistent and constant for that. I‚Äôm concerned it could become a Hemifacial Spasm. Hoping that my maxillary or ethmoid sinus is just putting pressure on a nearby nerve but thought something like that would have shown on the brain MRI back in December. 


I take magnesium, zinc and get about 8-9 hours sleep a night. Don‚Äôt drink coffee or even have caffeinated tea! Not under any intense stress/anxiety aside from this starting to drive me a bit crazy. 

Have some concern about MS, ALS, spinal tumour although feels unlikely‚Ä¶

1m7titj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1m7titj/aitah_for_wanting_to_cut_my_brother_off_after_he/,Aitah for wanting to cut my brother off after he threatened to hit me?,"This is going to be long and messy. I (19F) am an international student studying in the US. I came home for the summer to spend time with my family. I have two older sisters and one older brother (27M, turning 28 this year). I‚Äôve been wanting to book my flight back to the US for this August and usually I do so with the help of my brother so I approached him about it. Initially I wanted to go on the 1st, but he told me that it was early and I took his advice and chose to travel on the 6th, which I agreed upon with my roommate and friend. School starts on the 21st, however we just got an apartment and we want to have time to furnish it and settle into our new home before school starts again. 

My parents are divorced, so we only really see my dad on random occasions, or when we choose to sleepover there. My sister and I chose to sleep over around 2 weeks ago, and my brother and my other sister came by one day and had dinner with us and my dad. My brother brought up the idea of flying a little later then and that‚Äôs when I told him I‚Äôm okay flying on the 6th. After that, they went home to my moms and we stayed at our dads. When we got back home to our moms, my sister and I admittedly had a fucked up sleep schedule so we didn‚Äôt see much of my brother or my other sister. However, we‚Äôve slowly started fixing it this week. 

Around two days ago, my mother told me to ask my brother to book my flight since obviously we‚Äôre approaching August and flights aren‚Äôt getting any cheaper. Then she leaves for work and my brother eventually wakes up. I leave him be for around 30 minutes. He does his laundry and tidies up and once I see him in the kitchen making his coffee, I take the opportunity and ask if he can book me a flight for the 6th. Keep in mind, I don‚Äôt need my brother to book me a flight. My mom wanted to herself, but my brother told her he wanted to do it, which is the only reason I spoke to him about it in the first place. 

My question ends up opening a whole can of worms, and he argues with me that I don‚Äôt need to be traveling on the 6th, that my friend and I made a thoughtless decision when we chose that day (not true. our move in date is on the 8th and it takes 24 hours to travel from our country to the US, so that‚Äôs basically the entirety of the 6th and we‚Äôd take advantage of the 7th to relax after a days worth of travel before moving in on the 8th). He argues I don‚Äôt need to be back that early, but I want to and that‚Äôs what my friend and I agreed upon. I told him we‚Äôd take a week to furnish and the other week to relax and prepare for school, to which he argued there was no need to prepare for school. This was all really annoying since it‚Äôs my life and I know what I need, and because my friend already booked her flight and we agreed on staying at a hotel together, so he‚Äôs just throwing a wrench in our plans for no reason. Then he mentions that my cousin is getting married on the 8th, and that I knew that and still chose to travel on the 6th, as if I planned it all maliciously this way. My cousin announced his wedding 2 weeks ago. My friend and I have been planning this for a while. Not to mention, I‚Äôm not close to him and we haven‚Äôt spoken since we were kids, so my presence doesn‚Äôt matter. I also found out my brother himself won‚Äôt be attending the wedding since he‚Äôll be ‚Äútraveling with friends‚Äù, but makes it such a big deal for me to attend it, even though he‚Äôs closer to my cousin than I am. 

After arguing for a decent 20 minutes, he ends it with raising his voice and telling me that I started this whole conversation disrespectfully anyways and basically ordered him to book me a flight. To which I was like?? What? I asked if you could book me a flight? It was a question. And because he knew I was telling the truth, he then said, yeah but the look on your face was just a disrespectful agitated one. And I was like?? What? Just because you don‚Äôt like how my face looked doesn‚Äôt change the fact that I asked you to book me a flight respectfully and you chose to twist that. He ended up storming off into his room and I had to leave to pick my oldest sister from a friends so we could see my dad. We go to my dads and I tell him all this, and he says my brother just cares about us, which I understand, but he‚Äôs so insanely aggressive and agitating with his ways that I can‚Äôt stand it. 

Anyways, we head back to my mom‚Äôs and the next morning, (yesterday), I‚Äôm up with my mom again and she asks if my brother booked me a flight. I said no, and she says she‚Äôll just do it. So she finds me a flight and asks me if I‚Äôm sure he hasn‚Äôt, so I tell her I‚Äôm pretty sure, but she decides to get up and check so we don‚Äôt end up booking two tickets. My brother is sleeping, so she knocks on his door and asks if he booked me a ticket. He says no and she tells him she‚Äôs doing it, which I guess starts a whole argument that I can‚Äôt hear too well. My mom ends up leaving his room and closes the door behind her, which one would assume would be the end of the conversation. Instead, my brother gets up and flings the door open and storms into the living room after her, where I was sitting, and immediately starts yelling at me when I haven‚Äôt said a thing. My mother than defends me and says she‚Äôs the one who wants to book me a ticket, and they start arguing. He starts yelling about why I need to go on the 6th, not the 7th or 8th or 9th, and my mom says ‚Äúlet her go on the 6th! I don‚Äôt care.‚Äù. But for some reason he does. She asks if there aren‚Äôt flights on the 6th and only on the 7th or 8th or something, and he says there are flights on the 6th, so she‚Äôs confused on what the big deal is. 
It all starts a long argument, and he brings up how my friend and I didn‚Äôt think before booking or plan it properly, to which I argued that just because it wasn‚Äôt run by him doesn‚Äôt mean it wasn‚Äôt thought out. He said that we‚Äôre supposed to book together, but my friend and I wouldn‚Äôt have gotten on the same flight anyways (we live in different cities and she flies on a different airline), and either way, her father is the one booking for her, and he has work and travels a lot, so he‚Äôs going to book for her based on whenever he‚Äôs free, not based on whenever my brother plans for us to do this. 

Besides, I don‚Äôt understand the point of this because there are still available flights on the 6th, and we can still get there the same day together. Just because we‚Äôre not booking at the same minute together, doesn‚Äôt mean anything. He complains that he‚Äôs been telling me to book a ticket since a week ago, and my messed up sleep schedule won‚Äôt let him do anything, but I mention how it‚Äôs weird that he‚Äôs complaining because when I did approach him yesterday, all he did was yell and come at it aggressively. Keep in mind I haven‚Äôt yelled this whole conversation. He literally woke up and started yelling at me and my mom and my mother kept telling him to calm down. At some point in the conversation I had to point out to him that he was the only one yelling. 

Anyways, because I mentioned our conversation the day before, he decided to replay it and set the scene for my mother, telling her he had just woken up and I ordered him and told him aggressively to book me a flight for the 6th yesterday. To which I was like, what? I reminded him that I asked him respectfully, to which he brought up the look on my face again. My mother told him there was no point to bringing this up, and even if there was, what was I supposed to do about my face? He argued that there was a point, so she doesn‚Äôt hear a twisted version of it, which is ironic since he‚Äôs the only one twisting versions. My mother didn‚Äôt care and just wanted to book a flight for me using her miles, and he kept arguing and saying no because he knows better or whatever, and my mom says to show her the better option, which he argues and yells asking why he would be lying about that. And what she gets out of seeing it. She said she just wants to see it to be reassured, to which he kept arguing until he finally tried to show it to her, and lo and behold, the flight was no longer available just like my mother said. 

There was a lot of arguing being done, and at a certain point he was being so ridiculous that I guess I said something petty (I genuinely can‚Äôt remember what it was), to which he told me to stop being idiotic or something, and I was so fed up so all I said was that I wanted to be idiotic, and his reply to that was threatening to slap me across the face if I kept speaking that way. I didn‚Äôt have a chance to respond to that because my mother stepped in, but i find it funny that he can‚Äôt use his words to prove a point. Keep in mind, I didn‚Äôt say anything disrespectful. Maybe my tone was off and maybe I was acting childish, but I wasn‚Äôt disrespectful. I was just fed up. I didn‚Äôt say anything about him or his actions or his behavior (even though I could‚Äôve). 

Anyways, my mom mentioned wanting to go to work (she was 30 minutes late at this point) and he told her to go, but she said she wasn‚Äôt leaving if we were gonna keep arguing. Honestly, I think he could‚Äôve just gone back to sleep ages ago. Anyways, after all that, he told my mom to give it a day or two before booking just to see if prices get better (obviously at the risk of me not finding a flight back on the day I want to, but who cares right?) and he went back to bed. 

I‚Äôve just been stressed and feeling heavy ever since that argument. It‚Äôs not the first time he‚Äôs threatened to hit me or my sisters. When they were kids, he actually used to hit my eldest sister. He threaten us often, but if we argue with him (which we don‚Äôt usually, since we usually just let things go or don‚Äôt interact with him much, for good reason), it can get to that point. Thing is, if my dad was living here, he couldn‚Äôt make that threat. He wouldn‚Äôt dare saying that in front of him. If he hit me once my dad would hit him 10x harder. But idk why this time it‚Äôs still making me so insanely angry. I don‚Äôt feel comfortable in my own home. I feel tension everywhere even when he‚Äôs asleep and I don‚Äôt want him around. My mom texted me and told me to send him back some money I owed him when she left for work (it was for something he offered to pay for but I was waiting on getting compensated for it before sending him the money.). I think she just doesn‚Äôt want me to be indebted to him. I just took money from my savings and sent it to him because I don‚Äôt want to owe him anything. It‚Äôs been a day since this happened and it‚Äôs still bothering me. I wanna tell my dad since I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll make him angry, and maybe he can take it out on him. I wanna leave this house just because he‚Äôs in it but I want to stay with my mom. I just don‚Äôt want him in my life. I don‚Äôt want his help with anything. My mom can book my flight, I don‚Äôt want him involved with that. He‚Äôs almost 30 threatening to hit a teenager. And he‚Äôs bigger and he works out. He‚Äôs on the lowest bar of masculinity there is. I hate him. I was okay with letting go of the argument we had the other morning when he was making coffee, but I don‚Äôt want to let this one go. I‚Äôm calm and collected, but he‚Äôs insane and needs therapy and makes me feel insane. I don‚Äôt know what to do. The crazy thing is, he thinks he‚Äôs in the right, that we all need him and we‚Äôre all idiots. But he‚Äôs just a controlling asshole. He even tries to control my mother. But then he wonders why my sisters and I leave him out. I just don‚Äôt know what to do. Would I be the asshole if I cut him off? If so, how would I even do that? Thanks and sorry for the long post.

I'm a graphic designer and artist and love things like stationery, paper, books, and cute plushies. I also try to buy a teddy bear from every state I visit. I've only been to NYC once before for a design conference, but my camera roll was more or less just buildings and architecture.

While the main purpose of this short trip is visiting the Met, I was hoping for any suggestions for other interesting sights around the area. Otherwise, I'm just planning to wander.

Current itinerary: 

::Sunday

+ Landing at JFK (8:30am)
+ Uber/Cab to hotel in Chelsea
+ Hotel check in ~10:30am
+ Brunch: Best Bagels & Coffee
+ Meet up with a friend from Brooklyn
+ Kinokuniya
+ Nintendo Store
+ FAO Schwarz
+ Magnolia Bakery
+ New York Public Library
+ Dinner: All'Antico Vinaio (8th Ave)

::Monday

+ Breakfast: Culture Espresso
+ Walk to the Met through Central Park
+ Visit Balto statue
+ The Met until closing
+  No clue...is Economy Candy Shop worth a visit?
+  Head back to Chelsea
+ Dinner: Ichiran Ramen (open to other suggestions)

::Tuesday

+ Best Bagels & Coffee to buy bagels for my mom
+ Check out/store luggage
+ Chelsea Market
+ Very Fresh Noodles
+ Hotel/pick up luggage
+ Cab from hotel to JFK ~3:00pm
+ JFK, flight out (7:00pm)


I'm a little meh on Ichiran for the second day's dinner because I'm from Los Angeles and we have a pretty good breadth of Japanese food here. My hotel's also close to Koreatown, but we have great Korean food here too lol So any suggestions for dinner are welcome.

This vibrant street has such a rich history that it's been designated as one of America's ""Great Streets"" by the American Planning Association.

Walking down 7th Avenue feels like stepping back in time. The street is lined with historic brick buildings from the late 1800s, when Cuban, Spanish, and Italian immigrants made this area Tampa's cigar manufacturing hub. Today, these buildings house an eclectic mix of restaurants, bars, boutiques, and entertainment venues.

During the day, you'll find locals and tourists exploring the unique shops, grabbing Cuban sandwiches (which were actually invented here in Tampa), and taking photos of the iconic architecture. At night, the street transforms into Tampa's entertainment district, with live music pouring out of venues and people bar-hopping between historic establishments.

One of my favorite experiences was joining a guided adventure tour near Tampa Bay. While exploring the city's famous streets is great, I also discovered an amazing zipline course at Mobbly Bayou Wilderness Preserve. It gave me a totally different perspective of the area - soaring above the landscape while seeing Tampa Bay from unique angles. If you're interested in adding some adventure to your Tampa visit, you can book this experience here: https://athometouch.com/tampa

Back to 7th Avenue - don't miss these highlights:
- Columbia Restaurant (Florida's oldest restaurant, established 1905)
- Centro Ybor (historic shopping and entertainment complex)
- Jose Marti Park (dedicated to Cuban independence)
- The many cigar shops and coffee houses
- Historic streetcar rides

The best time to visit is during special events like the Fiesta Day celebration or the weekly Saturday Market. The street gets especially lively during these times, with street performers, food vendors, and cultural demonstrations.

Pro tip: Park in one of the public garages just off 7th Avenue. Street parking can be challenging, especially during peak hours and weekends. Also, many of the historic buildings offer guided tours if you want to learn more about the architecture and history.

Whether you're a history buff, foodie, or just looking for a good time, 7th Avenue has something for everyone. It's more than just a street - it's a living museum of Tampa's multicultural heritage and a testament to the city's ongoing evolution.

Remember to bring comfortable walking shoes and a camera - there are plenty of Instagram-worthy spots along this historic stretch. And if you're up for more adventure after exploring the street, don't forget to check out that zipline experience I mentioned earlier.",1,1753326230.0,LetsGoTravelers,0,1.0,False

I had a really good time and I think she did too because we continued to meet almost on a daily basis after that.

Meetings for a quick coffee or a sandwich afternoon turned into hours of wandering the city together, enjoying the sites, laughing, having conversation.

I was finding myself thinking about her more and more and couldn't let a day go by without initiating some kind of contact and suggest that we meet. She always said yes and she even initated a meeting herslef a few times.

2 days ago we were sitting together in my hotel room, talking and listening to music. I felt that I couldn't just let the evening end without taking things forward.

So I gently put my hand on her shoulder while she was talking. She continued to talk as if not being aware of what just happened. I thought to myself, ok maybe you got your answer, just take your hand off and forget it ever happend. Thats what a normal person would do, but I just couldnt leave it at that, so I started playing with her hair very gently, just moving some of it from her face to behind her ear. She does have a long hair and it was all over. Ok, so this was something she could not ignore anymore. She stopped talking, looked at me and said: Did I give you somehow the wrong impression ? I was too far gone at this point so I answered: No, you gave the right impression. I like you. She didnt laugh (I thought it was a little bit funny) and looking at me she said: I like you too, but you know, in this platonic friendship which I thought we are having. I am not interested in anything romantic. I said that I understand and that i am sorry that I made her feel uncomfortable. 

Roll the tape forward 24 hours, we met again for a few hours, had a great time together and I am hopelessly in love with her.

I think about her all the time and just want to be with her.

I grew up very secular and for the past month or so I‚Äôve been looking into Orthodoxy bc my husband had expressed interest in it. I bought my first bible and began reading it and would look up information on Orthodox Christianity and the differences between the different denominations. I was looking at it purely out of interest and wanting to understand it since my husband is passionate about it. I had never been drawn to investigating religion as I never experienced anything otherworldly, good or bad, and am the type of person who would need that kind of unexplainable experience to take that first step.

Almost two weeks ago on Friday, my husband and I eloped, and I suggested we visit a local Orthodox Church together the following Sunday (he has been alone previously and I now wanted to see what it was like after learning a bit more). We had a great weekend celebratory getaway and everything was great, after all, we just got married. However, on that Saturday night before church, I got sleep paralysis for the first time in my life. I saw an old woman leaning over me and was very close to my face. At first she was only smiling at me, but it was a very sinister smile and I felt pure fear. Then she started yelling at me and threatening me. I tried moving my hand to try and pat my husband awake since I couldn‚Äôt speak but of course, wasn‚Äôt able to. She then yelled ‚ÄúHe isn‚Äôt going to help you, no one is ever going to save you.‚Äù At that point I closed my eyes and eventually went back to sleep. 

After liturgy and coffee hour (both were great btw) I remembered how scary the sleep paralysis was and looked it up seeing how I was unfamiliar with it/sleep paralysis demons. I guess what I saw was the old hag who is common in folklore around the world. And while I know what I experienced scientifically was sleep paralysis, I can‚Äôt find any explanation for why people around the world see this woman. I couldn‚Äôt find any biblical ties to her specifically or maybe I‚Äôm not being thorough enough. I also read something sources on spiritual warfare and how the devil will attack you out of fear of losing you. 

If I knew anything about sleep paralysis/spiritual warfare before this happened, I wouldn‚Äôt even have questioned why I saw and heard what I did. All I do know is that it felt genuinely evil and it happened while I was exploring the faith and right before I attended church willingly for the first time in my life. 

Since then I‚Äôve continued to learn more about Orthodox Christianity and began praying and I haven‚Äôt experienced it since.

He drops to one knee. The way he used to when he still prayed.
The zipper groans as he draws it back.

Inside: brown paper.
Soaked.
Tied with twine on the verge of snapping.

The paper clings to his fingers.
The stain has spread.
Wet. Dark. Heavy.

Unlabeled.
Clean.

1m7synp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1m7synp/relationship_anxiety_just_broke_up_the_best/,Relationship anxiety just broke up the best relationship I‚Äôve ever had,"I fucked up so badly, that I broke up a relationship that has been everything I could ever hope for. Honest, communicative, loving, supportive, and truly amazing. 

I (M 31) was dating my partner (NBGF 28) for 2.5 months. We‚Äôd known each other for about 8 months prior. The first night we met was at a group meet up in my area, and being the nervous ball of anxiety I am, I saw them sitting alone and asked if I could join them. We talked together most of the night. I wanted to ask for their number right then and there. I didn‚Äôt, as I didn‚Äôt want to seem too pushy for being the first time we met. We would meet up at a karaoke night function with the same group and talk on occasion. I got so excited seeing them, and honestly started going more often because they would show up. They always came into the bar from the outside area to listen to me sing. About 8 months after that first night I finally worked up the courage to ask them on a date, and they said yes. A few weeks later we‚Äôd agreed to become partners. They went on a trip to Japan at one point and I missed them so terribly, and when they returned I ended up giving them a promise ring at our first dinner after they returned. They wore it everywhere. They were so happy with it and it was always a joy and comfort for me to feel it when we hugged or when I was sad and they would put my hand over my heart. 

My anxiety has always been an issue, and past relationships have never been very helpful in that regard. I‚Äôve been cheated on multiple times, ghosted out of the blue, and am basically always ready for the other shoe to drop. For 2.5 months they put up with it, reassured me, listened to me, offered support. They finished their masters degree and have been seeking a job, which has been supremely stressful for them especially given that their family, whom they live with, has been on their ass about it and not understanding that the job market as a whole is not great, and that even for entry level jobs it‚Äôs not always as simple as walking in and handing in an application and resume, especially since most of those jobs won‚Äôt hire people with advanced degrees because they know they will leave when something better arises. 

My now ex-partner has been stressed to high hell, and they started taking birth control a little after we started dating, which I‚Äôm sure hasn‚Äôt helped with stress with the hormonal changes they can cause. I noticed a pull back in dates and coming over and sex. I voiced my concerns but reassured them that I would work through everything with them. I did request they come over and cuddle a bit more often like when we started dating. We‚Äôd talked before about getting a couples counselor just to make sure we were able to work through everything together and build a healthy relationship foundation. 

Wednesdays were our main date days, and yesterday (Tuesday) we‚Äôd ended up having a conversation because my anxiety flared when they didn‚Äôt say goodnight or good morning the way they typically did. The typical anxious ‚Äúdid I do something, are they mad at me, are they upset, is something wrong.‚Äù We ended with me asking if they were still coming over today (Wednesday) and they said yes. After the conversation and a couple hours of reflection, I sent them a long message apologizing and saying that I would get better control of my anxiety, and that I would give them space for the day to make up for it. 

Then I continued about my day, and went for a D&D game with friends. I got drunk. Wasted drunk. While drunk I thought about how I missed them coming over to cuddle and I wanted them to. So at 1am I called them. (Not so bad inherently right? It gets worse) i ended up calling them 4 times in 20 minutes and I remember leaving a voicemail practically begging them to come over. Then I got home and passed out. 

This morning instead of waking up to their smile and a coffee like usual, I woke up to ‚ÄúI‚Äôm done. I‚Äôm walking away. This relationship isn‚Äôt healthy for either of us. Don‚Äôt contact me again.‚Äù And I was floor, devastated, and shocked. I admit in that shock I reached out again, against my better judgement, asking to talk it over like we always do and for them to give me one more chance. I obviously never got a response, but they‚Äôve also blocked me on everything. They are the avoidant type when they get overwhelmed, so while I was shocked, this is not fully surprising. 

A few hours later, the promise ring was on the front porch. 

I‚Äôm hoping without holding out that they will reach out in a few days to at least talk about it. If not, then I will drop off everything of theirs with a final letter of apology and well wishes with full intent to respect their request. I don‚Äôt know what will happen, and I know that the issues here are ones I need to address with a professional no matter what, and am seeking counseling to address it as an individual. 

I fucked up. I‚Äôll admit it every day. If they do reach out, I hope that we can work through it and at the very least remain very good friends. 

TLDR/ I got drunk and anxiously blew up my partner‚Äôs phone at 1am because they hadn‚Äôt been over for cuddle time in a month and I was sad and missed them. They ghosted me after. ",1,1753325375.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1m7sy2t,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConservativeKiwi/comments/1m7sy2t/the_price_of_everything_the_value_of_nothing/,"The price of everything, the value of nothing","I posted this in TOS on yet another thread about the price of dairy. It's hasn't been downvoted to oblivion yet, but it's still early. 

As I've been reading in a lot of threads both here and on TOS there‚Äôs a recurring theme and it's the obsession with price over any talk about value.

It‚Äôs always ‚Äúhow can I get this cheaper‚Äù, ""this is a rip off‚Äù, ‚ÄúI haggled the hell out of them‚Äù, ‚Äúwhy is X cheaper in Australia‚Äù.

But we almost never ask ""why don‚Äôt we invest in making things better instead of just cheaper"" or ""what‚Äôs the actual cost of driving every supplier, tradie, or business down to their margin floor"".

Yes, there are absolutely players out there who gouge and they should rightfully be called on it and forced to do better. But that doesn‚Äôt explain everything. Not every high price is profiteering. Sometimes it‚Äôs just the actual cost of doing business in a low scale, geographically isolated country.

This price mindset though seems to trickle through everything. We demand cheap butter but don‚Äôt want to hear about the global market cost of milk solids or freight. We expect tradies to be fast, skilled, and available immediately but god forbid they charge more than $60 an hour. We‚Äôll moan about a $6 coffee from a cafe paying living wages, then drop $90 on yoga pants made in a sweatshop.

When we do talk about wages, it‚Äôs usually through the lens of entitlement or blame. ‚ÄúBosses are greedy‚Äù or ‚Äúthe minimum wage is too low‚Äù. We treat it as a moral issue (which it is, in part), but almost never in the context of how to lift the value of the work being done. There‚Äôs little conversation about improving productivity, investing in skills, creating higher value jobs, or supporting industries that do more than just resell stuff made somewhere else.

Right now we‚Äôre stuck in this loop where everything is too expensive, wages are too low, and any attempt to fix one gets torpedoed by the other while trying to find someone else to blame. If we want a higher wage economy (which is actually the real issue here), we need to stop fixating on cutting prices and start building value.

But that‚Äôs not going to happen while everyones pushing prices to the floor. You can‚Äôt expect better wages, better service, or better products in an economy where the default instinct is to squeeze every dollar out of the other guy. If the national psyche is built on ""cheapest wins"" then there‚Äôs no margin left to invest in people. No incentive to train, to innovate, or to pay fairly. It's a race to the bottom and we‚Äôre all hitting it together.

And no, government intervention isn‚Äôt the magic answer. You can‚Äôt regulate your way to a high value economy. You can‚Äôt subsidise your way to prosperity. At best, government can grease the wheels by improving infrastructure, support skills training, or level the playing field in concentrated markets. But it can‚Äôt force people to invest, innovate, or shift their mindset about price versus value. That has to come from the ground up.

And before someone jumps in with ‚Äúbut we just exports commodities‚Äù no, we don‚Äôt. Not in the way people think. Our dairy, meat, wine, etc are positioned as premium goods in their global markets. Fonterra isn‚Äôt selling bulk milk powder as a cheap filler. Our beef and lamb aren‚Äôt going into low end pet food. NZ wine isn‚Äôt a bargain bin product in the UK. We‚Äôve spent decades building a reputation for clean, traceable, sustainable, high quality exports and we charge a premium for that. The problem isn‚Äôt that we‚Äôre commodity producers. It‚Äôs that we treat ourselves like we deserve commodity prices at home, while demanding first world wages, infrastructure, and services. That contradiction between what we want to pay and what we expect in return is a big part of the whole mess.",3,1753325325.0,ConservativeKiwi,6,1.0,False

Honest, communicative, loving, supportive, and truly amazing. 

I (M 31) was dating my partner (NBGF 28) for 2.5 months. We‚Äôd known each other for about 8 months prior. The first night we met was at a group meet up in my area, and being the nervous ball of anxiety I am, I saw them sitting alone and asked if I could join them. We talked together most of the night. I wanted to ask for their number right then and there. I didn‚Äôt, as I didn‚Äôt want to seem too pushy for being the first time we met. We would meet up at a karaoke night function with the same group and talk on occasion. I got so excited seeing them, and honestly started going more often because they would show up. They always came into the bar from the outside area to listen to me sing. About 8 months after that first night I finally worked up the courage to ask them on a date, and they said yes. A few weeks later we‚Äôd agreed to become partners. They went on a trip to Japan at one point and I missed them so terribly, and when they returned I ended up giving them a promise ring at our first dinner after they returned. They wore it everywhere. They were so happy with it and it was always a joy and comfort for me to feel it when we hugged or when I was sad and they would put my hand over my heart. 

My anxiety has always been an issue, and past relationships have never been very helpful in that regard. I‚Äôve been cheated on multiple times, ghosted out of the blue, and am basically always ready for the other shoe to drop. For 2.5 months they put up with it, reassured me, listened to me, offered support. They finished their masters degree and have been seeking a job, which has been supremely stressful for them especially given that their family, whom they live with, has been on their ass about it and not understanding that the job market as a whole is not great, and that even for entry level jobs it‚Äôs not always as simple as walking in and handing in an application and resume, especially since most of those jobs won‚Äôt hire people with advanced degrees because they know they will leave when something better arises. 

My now ex-partner has been stressed to high hell, and they started taking birth control a little after we started dating, which I‚Äôm sure hasn‚Äôt helped with stress with the hormonal changes they can cause. I noticed a pull back in dates and coming over and sex. I voiced my concerns but reassured them that I would work through everything with them. I did request they come over and cuddle a bit more often like when we started dating. We‚Äôd talked before about getting a couples counselor just to make sure we were able to work through everything together and build a healthy relationship foundation. 

Wednesdays were our main date days, and yesterday (Tuesday) we‚Äôd ended up having a conversation because my anxiety flared when they didn‚Äôt say goodnight or good morning the way they typically did. The typical anxious ‚Äúdid I do something, are they mad at me, are they upset, is something wrong.‚Äù We ended with me asking if they were still coming over today (Wednesday) and they said yes. After the conversation and a couple hours of reflection, I sent them a long message apologizing and saying that I would get better control of my anxiety, and that I would give them space for the day to make up for it. 

Then I continued about my day, and went for a D&D game with friends. I got drunk. Wasted drunk. While drunk I thought about how I missed them coming over to cuddle and I wanted them to. So at 1am I called them. (Not so bad inherently right? It gets worse) i ended up calling them 4 times in 20 minutes and I remember leaving a voicemail practically begging them to come over. Then I got home and passed out. 

This morning instead of waking up to their smile and a coffee like usual, I woke up to ‚ÄúI‚Äôm done. I‚Äôm walking away. This relationship isn‚Äôt healthy for either of us. Don‚Äôt contact me again.‚Äù And I was floor, devastated, and shocked. I admit in that shock I reached out again, against my better judgement, asking to talk it over like we always do and for them to give me one more chance. I obviously never got a response, but they‚Äôve also blocked me on everything. They are the avoidant type when they get overwhelmed, so while I was shocked, this is not fully surprising. 

A few hours later, the promise ring was on the front porch. 

I‚Äôm hoping without holding out that they will reach out in a few days to at least talk about it. If not, then I will drop off everything of theirs with a final letter of apology and well wishes with full intent to respect their request. I don‚Äôt know what will happen, and I know that the issues here are ones I need to address with a professional no matter what, and am seeking counseling to address it as an individual. 

I fucked up. I‚Äôll admit it every day. If they do reach out, I hope that we can work through it and at the very least remain very good friends. 

TLDR/ I got drunk and anxiously blew up my partner‚Äôs phone at 1am because they hadn‚Äôt been over for cuddle time in a month and I was sad and missed them. They ghosted me after. ",1,1753325208.0,dating_advice,1,0.67,False

We were 19, sitting outside having coffee one morning, and I started telling her about a random dream I had the night before. In the dream, we were throwing a party at our parents house. A bunch of our friends were there, and out of nowhere, a huge fight broke out. The part that stood out most AND was the most random part?

1m7st1h,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAVoyager/comments/1m7st1h/what_is_the_best_oahu_island_tour/,What is the best Oahu island tour?,"After exploring nearly every tour option on Oahu, I can confidently say the Circle Island Tour with Waimea Waterfall stands out as the most comprehensive way to experience the island in a single day.

I initially hesitated about booking an organized tour, preferring to explore independently. However, this decision turned out to be one of the best I made during my Hawaiian vacation. The tour perfectly balances major attractions with hidden gems that most tourists miss.

The journey begins with an early morning pickup in Waikiki, which I appreciated because it helps beat the crowds. Our first stop at Diamond Head offered breathtaking coastal views - perfect for those sunrise photos. The morning light hitting the ocean created some incredible photo opportunities.

What really impressed me was our guide's knowledge of Hawaiian history and culture. Unlike some tours that just drive by locations, we got fascinating stories about each spot. At Nu'uanu Pali Lookout, we learned about King Kamehameha's historic battle while enjoying spectacular views of the Windward Coast.

The North Shore portion of the tour was a highlight. We stopped at famous beaches like Sunset Beach and had time to grab lunch at the legendary shrimp trucks. Pro tip: Giovanni's Shrimp Truck is worth the wait, but bring cash.

Waimea Valley was arguably the tour's centerpiece. The botanical garden walk to the waterfall is stunning, and yes, you can actually swim there! Just remember to pack your swimsuit and a quick-dry towel. The water was refreshing, and the whole experience felt magical.

One unexpected highlight was the stop at Tropical Farms. The Kona coffee tasting was excellent, and I ended up bringing home some macadamia nuts that were far better (and cheaper) than what you'll find in Waikiki shops.

If you're considering booking this tour (which I highly recommend), you can reserve your spot here: https://athometouch.com/Oahu-Island. They offer free cancellation up to 24 hours before, so there's no risk in securing your spot early.

A few practical tips:
- Wear comfortable walking shoes
- Bring a water bottle
- Pack both sunscreen and a light rain jacket
- Don't forget your camera
- Bring cash for lunch and souvenirs

The tour costs $154 per person, which initially might seem steep. However, when you factor in individual entrance fees, transportation costs, and the convenience of having everything organized, it's actually quite reasonable.

The 8-hour duration is perfect - long enough to see everything without feeling rushed, but not so long that you're exhausted. The air-conditioned vehicle between stops was always a welcome relief from the Hawaiian sun.

After trying several island tours, this one offers the best balance of sightseeing, cultural insights, and activities. It's particularly great for first-time visitors who want to see the whole island without the hassle of renting a car or planning a route.

In conclusion, if you're looking to maximize your time on Oahu and want to see the island's highlights in one well-organized day, this tour is your best bet. Just remember to book in advance as spots fill up quickly, especially during peak season.",1,1753324905.0,AskAVoyager,0,1.0,False

I had been seeing the posts go around of this Hoohill Pico in the Wes Anderson color scheme so I decided to get one. Normally I don‚Äôt buy knockoff pens but I love the color scheme and would never pay the Montblanc markup for it. 

The pen has a nice feel to it. It‚Äôs a slip cap pen but has a screw to post system that is pretty neat. I knew from the start that I wanted to put a vintage nib on the pen as a got a stockpile from restoring pens. I found an Eversharp Skyline nib fits with no trimming of the feed necessary. The one I used is a flex nib so I widened the ink channel on the feed to supply plenty of ink. I then heat set the feed to the nib. It‚Äôs a plastic feed (meaning it‚Äôs water safe) so I boiled some water in a coffee mug in the microwave. Then I held it in the water for about 20 seconds, pulled it out, and bent it slightly upwards to fit the nib snugly. It may sound like a lot but it‚Äôs not too bad once you get the hang of it.

All in all it turned out great and I think the pen will stay in my collection. It‚Äôs going right next to the vintage Kaweco Sport and other small pocket pens I have.

What do you all think? Does this pen justify a vintage nib? Does this knockoff make you mad or do you want one now? Was my doodle good? üòÇ ",6,1753324542.0,fountainpens,1,1.0,False

1m7so0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/AyeshaErotica/comments/1m7so0p/horny4u_how_i_would_do_it/,HORNY.4U: How I Would Do It,"We all know the whole H.4U remaster was... weird. The delays, the scattered singles that missed cohesion, and the fact that the album wasn‚Äôt even made yet, it just all felt off.

In my opinion, the project lacked direction from Ayesha herself. She seemed torn between her classic sound and her new style, between giving fans what they wanted and pursuing her own artistic vision. But I believe there‚Äôs a way to balance both worlds.

Here‚Äôs how I would approach H.4U if I were Ayesha:

**The Core Issue: Style Clash**

The biggest problem with the remaster was the awkward blend of old and new tracks. The two styles just don‚Äôt mesh, they clash instead of complementing each other. That‚Äôs why I think Ayesha have three options:

**1. Scrap the new songs and just release the old demos.**

**2. Turn H.4U into a fully new project.**

**3. Or the best idea in my opinion: make it a double album/project.**

Think SOS and LANA by SZA: two distinct but connected parts. One would focus on the old material, and the second would give space to her newer sound.

Now let‚Äôs talk about the actual remastering process:

***For old known songs like Vacation Bible School:***
I‚Äôd remaster them lightly, not remake them beyond recognition. Just polish up the instrumental and vocals with a blend of old and new Ayesha flair. Hot Dog Hooker is a perfect example of how this can work.

***For old unknown songs like Anna Nicole:***
They‚Äôd need to be recorded, of course. The beat should also reflect the fusion of styles, something fresh, but still rooted in the original vibe.

***For old unfinished songs like From the Back:***
Again, finish them up with the same approach, a mix of the classic and the current sound, blah blah blah.

***For the new tracks:***
You know the drill by now, right?

In the end, everything should reflect a blend, bridging the gap between Ayesha's past and present. The goal is to create something authentic that doesn‚Äôt water down the essence of the original H.4U concept.

Now let's get to the tracklist..


#***HORNY.4U: ACT I (the old songs)***



**1. h.4u theme**

**2. iconic**

**3. we can do it!**

**4. vacation bible school**

**5. anna nicole**

**6. cum c my tits**

**7. anal queen**

**8. star**

**9. from the back**

**10. alice**

**11. all around the world**

**12. how great is our god?**

#***HORNY.4U: ACT II (the new songs)***



**1. condom (prod. mkx)**

**2. all-star anal weekend**

**3. i wanna fuck**

**4. friday**

**5. darla**

**6. hot dog hooker**

**7. coffee cake**

**8. handjob (ft. baku)**

**9. superpuss**

**10. hands on me**

**11. house party**

**12. get down on you**

This is how I‚Äôd structure HORNY.4U, two acts that works separately but also complement each other. It respects the legacy of the old while fully embracing the new.",6,1753324487.0,AyeshaErotica,0,1.0,False

Ive been going to the same coffee stand like 3ish times a week for a year now with my mom in the morning. I moved in to care for her because of medical needs and it's one of our happy rituals we do together.

Part of that is the 6 baristas who work there are extremely kind, friendly, caring people who treat us really well every time we come in. We always tip but lately I've been thinking about giving them large sum tips with personal thank you notes because they are seriously such a geniune positive presence in our life, no matter how busy or stressed their day is, and im extremely thankful.

One of the baristas is non-binary and quite obviously so, they wear they/them tags so people can see it.

Im not gonna lie my mom has had some extremely disappointing opinions on trans/nonbinary identities in the past. Very much in the vocal ""it's a mental illness and why do they need a pride month"" kinda crowd. But the presence of this barista in our life, along with a few conversations ive had with her, has genuinely completely changed her entire opinion on LGBTQ+ identities. Like she has called me extremely upset at herself because she thought she might have misgendered someone and felt truly horrible about it. Im so fucking proud of her, but i honestly dont think she'd be anywhere near where she is in growth at her age (over 70) without having this near daily interaction with someone who was so fully truly openly themself as a nb person and just was so nice to us for no other reason than they are just a lovely human.

This was all really long winded just to ask i guess, would it be appropriate to say something along the lines of ""thank you for being true to yourself every day. Just by being you, you have made a genuinely deep positive impact on me and my family.""? Is that weird and  crossing the line for someone who makes our coffee?

## Key Features Analysis

The Body Glove water filter boasts a number of compelling features designed for optimal performance and user satisfaction.

**Advanced Filtration Technology:**

The Heart of the body Glove water filter is its multi-stage filtration system. This system typically includes sediment pre-filtration, followed by activated carbon filtration, and sometiems additional stages like reverse osmosis for enhanced purification. The initial sediment pre-filter removes larger particles such as sand, silt, and rust, preventing them from clogging subsequent filters and extending thier lifespan. The activated carbon filter excels at absorbing chlorine, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and other contaminants that contribute to unpleasant tastes and odors. Advanced models may also incorporate specialized filters for removing lead, pesticides, and other harmful substances.

**Compact and Space-Saving Design:**

Body Glove water filters are generally designed with space efficiency in mind. Whether it's an under-sink system, a countertop model, or a whole-house filter, the units are typically compact and don't require extensive plumbing modifications. Under-sink models, for example, are engineered to fit neatly within standard kitchen cabinets, maximizing available storage space. Countertop filters have a streamlined profile, minimizing their footprint on the kitchen counter. This compact design makes Body Glove water filters suitable for apartments, small homes, and RVs where space is at a premium.

**Easy Installation and Maintenance:**

Body Glove strives to make their water filters user-pleasant, from initial installation to ongoing maintenance. Many models feature swift-connect fittings and straightforward instructions,allowing for a relatively simple DIY installation. Filter replacement is also designed to be hassle-free. Cartridge filters can typically be swapped out in a matter of minutes,often without the need for special tools. Some models even include indicator lights or alarms to alert users when it's time to replace the filter, further simplifying maintenance.

**NSF Certification:**

Many Body Glove water filters are certified by NSF International, a reputable association that tests and certifies products to meet stringent public health and safety standards. NSF certification ensures that the filter has been independently tested and verified to reduce specific contaminants to the levels claimed by the manufacturer. This provides consumers with added assurance that the filter is performing as advertised and delivers safe, clean drinking water. It's crucial to look for NSF certification when choosing a water filter to ensure its reliability and effectiveness.**Durable Construction and Materials:**
body Glove water filters are built with durable, high-quality materials designed to withstand the rigors of continuous use. The housings are typically constructed from robust plastics or stainless steel, providing resistance to leaks and corrosion. The filter cartridges themselves are manufactured using food-grade materials to prevent contamination of the filtered water. This focus on durability ensures that the water filter will provide reliable performance for years to come,minimizing the need for repairs or replacements.

## Core Benefits

Investing in a Body Glove water filter can yield several significant benefits for consumers.

**Improved Water Quality:** The primary benefit of a Body Glove water filter is the substantial improvement in water quality. By removing chlorine,sediment,heavy metals,and other contaminants,the filter delivers cleaner,healthier,and better-tasting water. This can have a positive impact on overall health and well-being, as it reduces exposure to potentially harmful substances. Users frequently enough notice a significant difference in the taste and odor of their water, making it more enjoyable to drink and use for cooking.

**Cost Savings:** While there is an initial investment in purchasing a Body Glove water filter, it can lead to significant cost savings over time. By filtering your own water at home, you can eliminate the need to purchase bottled water, which can be expensive and environmentally unfriendly. The cost of replacing filter cartridges is generally much lower than the ongoing expense of buying bottled water. Additionally,cleaner water can also extend the lifespan of appliances that use water,such as coffee makers and ice machines,by reducing the buildup of scale and mineral deposits.**Environmental Friendliness:** Choosing a Body Glove water filter over bottled water contributes to a more enduring lifestyle.Bottled water produces a significant amount of plastic waste, much of which ends up in landfills or oceans. By filtering your water at home, you reduce your reliance on single-use plastic bottles and help minimize your environmental impact. Some Body Glove filters also use eco-friendly filter media, further enhancing their environmental credentials.

## FAQs Section

**How often should I replace the filter cartridges in my Body Glove water filter?**

The replacement frequency for filter cartridges varies depending on the model of the Body Glove water filter and the quality of your incoming water. Typically, sediment pre-filters need to be replaced every 3-6 months, while activated carbon filters may last 6-12 months. Some advanced filters, such as reverse osmosis membranes, can last even longer, up to 2 years or more.Regularly checking the filter's performance and following the manufacturer's recommendations for replacement is essential to maintaining optimal water quality.

**Are Body glove water filters compatible with well water?**

While some Body Glove water filters can be used with well water, it's crucial to test your well water first to determine its specific contaminants and mineral content. Well water often contains higher levels of sediment,iron,bacteria,and other substances that can quickly clog or overwhelm standard water filters. for well water applications, it's generally recommended to use a more robust filtration system specifically designed for well water, which may include a sediment filter, an iron filter, a UV sterilizer, and other specialized filtration stages. Contact Body Glove or a water treatment professional to determine the best filtration solution for your well water needs.

**Can a Body Glove water filter remove fluoride from my water?**

Not all Body Glove water filters are designed to remove fluoride. Standard activated carbon filters do not effectively remove fluoride. To remove fluoride, you'll need a water filter that utilizes specific technologies such as reverse osmosis, activated alumina, or bone char. Check the product specifications of the Body Glove water filter you're considering to ensure that it is certified for fluoride removal. If fluoride removal is a priority, opt for a model specifically designed for this purpose.

1m7sjg8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1m7sjg8/how_i_made_my_high_school_best_friends_life_a/,How I Made My High School Best Friend‚Äôs Life A Living Hell: Here‚Äôs What It Taught Me About Revenge,"TLDR; My high school best friend turned out to be a manipulative, toxic person who hurt people close to me. In senior year, I secretly orchestrated a psychological revenge plot ‚Äî feeding his paranoia, isolating him socially, and ruining his reputation. He later claimed it drove him to self-harm. I felt conflicted, but saw it as karmic payback. We haven‚Äôt spoken in years.

As a disclaimer before I write this, I want to take a second to make my own position on my actions clear. This happened about 5 years ago and I don‚Äôt think about it that often. It‚Äôs one of those things I regret but am glad happened; it served my development and made me reconcile with the destructive way in which revenge can take you over.

To start the story, I moved in 8th grade. The school I went to was very different than all my other experiences; I had moved a lot as a kid. I didn‚Äôt have that hard time making friends, as I had gotten so used to moving so often; however, something was still missing. The people that I was hanging out with afforded me social connections; however, they were relatively shallow. I didn‚Äôt really enjoy lunch unless I was in some sort of political debate. I tended to stay quiet because none of the conversations amused me.

 I then became closer to a friend from math class, let‚Äôs call him Leo. He wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúpopular‚Äù but I was never one to mind about that. In a sense, our friendship was likely a combination of me looking for a friendship that didn‚Äôt feel superficial and him leaching onto me because I was in ‚Äúthe popular group‚Äù and was nice to him. His mother texted my mom to invite me over winter break (mind you, 8th grade was a weird time to be having your mother text your friends mom to invite you over but I didn‚Äôt think much of it because I knew that he lacked social skills and it didn‚Äôt bother me). At the time, he was just a nice kid that I felt like I could talk too about real stuff going on in my life and it felt nice. There was also a weird component of me being some sort of ‚Äúmentor‚Äù to him (writing this out makes me cringe). I was hesitant to hang out with him and later declined, however, I was interested in getting to know him and saw him as a school friend. 

Fast forward to Freshman year and we had hung out a bit over summer. I was never one to value popularity when I saw most the people I sat with at lunch as superficial; however, it felt important to have a place to sit during lunch. Although the general consensus was that Leo was weird, I ended up inviting Leo to sit with us during lunch. At this time, people were starting to talk about sex. I asked a girl (Let‚Äôs call her Haley) who was more nerdy and she seemed relatively interested, although there was no emotional connection between us. We talked about having sex at school but it never came into fruition because we were both young and scared. I don‚Äôt want to get too attached to this story because it is a bit of a side plot but it will be important later. It ended up blowing up when her friend ratted her out and told the counselors what she did. Turns out, she had been doing this and sending nudes to 10% of the guys in our grade. Haley ended up getting slutshamed, dropped by all her friends, missing prom (and not being asked), and essentially being the scapegoat for everything (even though there were at least 20 guys implicated.) I feel bad for my complicity in Haley‚Äôs story and don‚Äôt have excuses for it.

Fast forward to the end of Freshman year, Haley and Leo took the bus together and seemed to bond. People had told me that they were potentially romantically interested in each other; however, Leo told me he wasn‚Äôt and I had no reason not to take him at face value.  A picture of them walking in the neighborhood together ended up being leaked to the whole school and, after asking him about it, it became clear that Leo and her were dating. I had reason to believe that Leo was likely insecure about my past with Haley so I tried not to pressure him into talking about her. Even when everything came out about them to the school, he denied it when asked and got made fun of for liking her. It was sad to watch from the outside but I felt I couldn‚Äôt help because my past involvement with it. To add to this, Leo‚Äôs family was opposed to him dating her for cultural reasons, meaning everything had to be kept a secret. He didn‚Äôt feel like he could tell his classmates because he was possessive and insecure about her past, he couldn‚Äôt tell his family because they banned him dating, and he couldn‚Äôt tell me because I had a past with her. 

At the end of that summer, going into Sophomore year, Haley broke things off with Leo in a respectful way. As she had been slut shamed her entire freshmen year, Haley and her parents thought it would be optional for her to change schools for a fresh start. They had a lot of money and sent to her to a good Christian private school. I‚Äôm not sure the exact reasons as to why they broke it off but I know that it was something related to her having a fresh start in a new environment. However, Leo was vengeful. Although they were still hooking up in the start of freshman year, Leo dedicated his life to making sure that she would pay for breaking up with him and wouldnt be afforded the change of scenery she so desperately needed. He ended up finding out who asked her to prom, making friends with him through my mutual friends and setting a long plot to leak her nudes to the entire school that she just moved too. I can only imagine the pain she went through. He ended up cancelling their prom date, took someone else, and, again, she was slutshamed by her entire grade. This was a long plot & I won‚Äôt go too far into the details but he really put a lot of time and effort to put her humiliation into fruition. 

In sophomore year, he progressively got more spiteful. He ended up holding resentment towards me, as well. I‚Äôm sure a lot of it was his anger at his parents (he was acting out and saying really mean things to them (e.g. you will never meet my children)), and the bullying he dealt with for dating Haley. Our friendship got out of control and he would weirdly try and assert himself and tell me that he‚Äôs better than me. 

During this time, my brother, who is one grade younger than I was, had a girlfriend. This is a really long story but to sum it up, he ended up turning my brother‚Äôs girlfriend against him and sabotaging their relationship. I didn‚Äôt know this at the time. 

As he progressively got more out of control, we began to distance ourselves while still maintaining ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù status. He had ventured out into the different groups with friends that I had introduced him too (I was a floater, he had poor social skills) and bonding with them. It felt good he was making friends but at the same time I felt boxed out.

COVID had happened and not much went on junior year. I would say that he got progressively more spiteful and I started to seek out other friendships. In the end of Junior year, a friend I had introduced him too, (lets call him Joseph) had confided in him and got closer with him. Joseph, a well-intentioned, open-minded, caring person let Leo into all his secrets. Amongst those, was a complicated relationship he had with a girl (let‚Äôs call her Eve) who Leo got progressively closer too. It got to the point where they would do group calls and then Eve would call Leo one on one. Eve never saw Leo romantically, though I believe Leo might have. He ended up sabotaging that relationship because Leo was playing Joseph the entire time. He thought Joseph was dumb and had no direction in life (which isn‚Äôt true). 

The summer going into senior year, I had learned the ways in which he sabotaged my brother‚Äôs relationship a year ago. I was shattered. Though the signs were always there, I wondered how my best friend could ever do something like that to my brother. I became enraged and felt culpable merely by association. One day in the summer, as we were smoking weed, I had a neighbor that looked like one of our deans come outside to take out her trash. I told him that it was the dean and he and I both ran to the car. He was paranoid about it because our school had drug tests. It wasn‚Äôt a piss test either; it was a hair test. I told him to shave his head and his eyebrows; that‚Äôs the only way he could be safe. He ended up shaving his head bald, buying a wig, and no eyebrows to start the senior year.

It didn‚Äôt take long for senior year to start off and for him to start blackmailing me (he told me his uncle (a minister from a foreign country) would call all the schools I wanted to apply too and put in a bad word for me). I didn‚Äôt take the bait. He crashed out and said he no longer wanted my friendship.

Immediately, right after he did that, I told Joseph everything that had happened. He had also done many terrible things (another 10 page story) to my friend (let‚Äôs call him Robin) and I had screenshots to prove everything. I went to school that next day, told them both everything that Leo had done to them and we trauma-bonded. I left the ‚Äúpopular‚Äù group and started sitting with them at lunch; we started a new table with many different assortments of people that we liked. 

Leo, as I‚Äôm sure you all might gather, is paranoid. Joseph, Robin, and I all knew this. I used that paranoia to tell him that Robin and Joseph know about the thinfs he has done and are plotting to ruin him. It might sound crazy but you have to understand I was speaking this kid‚Äôs language. I ended up acting as somewhat of a double agent. Robin, Joseph, and I would devise different subplots for what we would say they were plotting and we would laugh at them. It felt like a game to us. This kid had all fucked us over in various ways and he trauma bonded off of his pain. Meanwhile, I was using the double agent excuse whenever I would hang out with them all weekend and he had nothing to do. It was clear that he had burned all of his bridges and didn‚Äôt have any friends left. Still, he trusted me to gather intel as to what there plans were. I would spend hours everyday, feeding off his anxiety and pain. I thought about all the people he hurt, me, Haley, Joseph, Robin, my brother; all this did was motivate me and expose a side of myself I had never seen. It got to the point where Joseph and Robin were progressively less engaged in the plot and I was the only one feeding off this. I ended up secretly starting a rumor that he impregnated someone from another school, exposed that he was a year older than everyone (which was (weirdly) his deepest, darkest secret) through public records from voter registration. All the while, I was just the double agent gathering intel and giving Leo selective intel Joseph and Robin wanted. This would included staged voice memos of them pretending to be angry, among many other things. 

Leo graduated senior year without any friends; wasn‚Äôt invited to a single graduation party. All the rumors came about and he was pretty much known as the weird kid. Meanwhile, Joseph, Robin, and I would throw parties and had a very fun end to our high school experience. I loved watching him crumble; lose all his friends and being ostracized within the grade. It became clear that Leo was suffering immensely and I fed off of it.

Fast forward to the summer, I can‚Äôt remember the exact circumstances but I told Leo everything that I did. That the whole time I said Leo and Robin were plotting against him, I was playing mind games with him. It was a contested conversation and I‚Äôll never forget it. At first, it felt good to get off my chest; however, what he told me mind-boggled me. He told me there was a reason he would wear hoodies everyday: he was having panic attacks every single night and cutting himself. He claimed to even have tried to hang himself and his father walked in on him. I don‚Äôt know if I believe that because this is a manipulative person that lies to guilt people but I felt remorseful about my actions. He told me I had mentally handicapped him and destroyed his family and wanted me to pay for his therapy. I apologized but I didn‚Äôt cry. So long as he didn‚Äôt die, in my eyes at the time, I have no emotional culpability and I owe him nothing. In a way, I felt like I was supposed to be his Karma. I had watched him destroy so many people around him and thought the only way he‚Äôd learn is if he faced someone smarter than him; someone who can beat him at his own game.

We ended up meeting for at a Barnes and Nobles for coffee a year later. He seemed fine. He claims to have a girlfriend. Although he tried to flex that he was going to a better university than me (mine is objectively better), I didn‚Äôt take the bait, I just laughed. I could tell that I changed him but I wasn‚Äôt sure in what ways. I‚Äôm not sure I can ever take him out of his self-indulged ways but he seemed like a more introspective person who had at least been to some therapy. I left it off, blocked him, and haven‚Äôt spoke to him since. I plan on reaching out to him in another 6 years (4 years have passed.)

I feel remorse for him but not as much as I feel for myself. I know not to let myself stoop that low and indulge myself with that hate and negativity. It was the inception of my substance-use (as it was my only escape from the altering of my hateful psyche) and now here I am, four years later, picking up all the pieces.",0,1753324105.0,ProRevenge,13,0.24,False

(cheerful) well, here we are, honey! Mt. Jarlstorm, the tallest mountain in the Rintelo region, but also the safest. Should be perfect for your first climb\~

‚Ä¶

(chuckles) Aw, don‚Äôt feel so bad! You‚Äôve kept up so far today, right? A run through the Ipa fields, followed by a swim through the Sreng river. For an artificer, you did pretty good against those slimes too.

‚Ä¶

(laughing gently) Well, that‚Äôs part of being an adventurer, baby. (kiss) sometimes, you get a little slime on you. Besides, you said you wanted to see what it‚Äôs like to be an adventurer like me, right?

‚Ä¶

(teasing) That‚Äôs why I saved the best for last. Come on, let‚Äôs start climbing up the mountain. Don‚Äôt be scared, I‚Äôll be with you every step of the way. And I‚Äôm not just saying that cause I‚Äôm your girlfriend. As a top ranked adventurer, I have responsibilities, ya know?

\[Click\]

(kiss) There, now your harness is attached to mine. So even if you fall? I‚Äôll be able to pull you back up, easy peasy sugarcube.¬†

‚Ä¶

Oh don‚Äôt gimme that look! You are a sugarcube, sweet enough to be irresistible to anyone who knows ya. Gaia knows I‚Äôve had to beat back a few strumpets with an eye on you.¬†

‚Ä¶

(bemused) of course ya never saw them. Made sure I did it where you couldn‚Äôt see, darling. It wouldn't be right to have your opinion of me diminish because I got a bit rough in the fight.

\[shifting rocks\]

(grunting and exerting effort) well, of course I fought with em, you are my boyfriend. Ain‚Äôt no way I‚Äôm sharing you with anyone else. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs particularly selfish, is it?

‚Ä¶

(pouts) and there you go being philosophical again. Cute as it is, I am a little confused honey. What do you mean it‚Äôs selfish? (grunt)

‚Ä¶

(intrigued) Ohhhh‚Ä¶I see! SO being selfish isn‚Äôt inherently a bad thing, in terms of being self interested. But it‚Äôs only harmful when you let it create conflict and hurt others?

‚Ä¶

I suppose that makes‚Ä¶ (yelp) hey! You are totally calling me the bad kind of selfish, not fair! I wouldn‚Äôt have to fight people if they just accepted you were mine!

‚Ä¶

(sighs) And you‚Äôve lost me again, my selfishness against their own? What does that mea- (shouts) careful! That ledge is unstable-

\[slip, grasping of hands\]

(panicked) Careful! You almost fell! (concerned, shaky voice) are you alright? Are you hurt? Did you bruise your head or bump your shoulders?¬†

‚Ä¶

(sighs) thank goodness‚Ä¶ Let me think, let me think‚Ä¶ There should be a safer ledge nearby. Room enough for us to sit down and catch our breath. Can you make it over there, darling?

‚Ä¶

Good, good. Just follow me, exact movements. Don‚Äôt touch anything but the ledges and grips I‚Äôm on, alright?

‚Ä¶

(chuckles) Still as good a listener as always, I see‚Ä¶¬†

\[a few seconds of silence, just the wind and some slipping rocks\]

(gasp of air) alright, we‚Äôre here. Set yourself down, carefully‚Ä¶ Back against the wall, and we should be alright. How do you feel now?

‚Ä¶

(sigh of relief) I‚Äôm so glad to hear that my love‚Ä¶ but your legs are shaking now. It‚Äôs like you can barely stand, let alone climb!

(stern) answer me, how long have you been like this? I know you aren‚Äôt sick, otherwise the symptoms would‚Äôve shown sooner. So tell me, when did you start feeling exhausted?

‚Ä¶

(still stern, but with a hint of gentleness) Darling, I promise I won‚Äôt be upset, no matter what you say. So please, tell me the truth.

‚Ä¶

(sigh, guilty tone) I should have expected as much‚Ä¶ I figured starting the day with a run through the Ipa fields would be a good warm up for our adventure, but I should‚Äôve remembered you weren‚Äôt as experienced as me.

\[sudden hug\]

Please, don‚Äôt look so sad, sugarcube. It ain‚Äôt your fault, you and I are just in different fields. I chose the adventurers lifestyle, and you do your best work studying at the university. And it is pretty good work, I might add.¬†

(playful) after all, it‚Äôs where you came up with that stamina formula, right? The one which kept you going during that slime fight and our swim? Don‚Äôt try to deny it, I saw you slip that blue potion into your canteen before our swim\~

‚Ä¶

(laughing) Of course I was listening to ya talk about it! Darling, I may be a barbarian, but I still love hearing every lil thing you say. Even if I don‚Äôt understand when you go into the specifics, you get the cutest grin when you're teaching me. And my heart soars every time I see it.¬†

‚Ä¶

(soft, gentle teasing) Am I mad at you for lying and taking a stamina potion? Hmm‚Ä¶Well I‚Äôm cuddlin ya, keeping you close to my chest, and whispering in a soft, gentle voice‚Ä¶ So I think I‚Äôm pretty livid, honestly\~

(kiss)

(stern) The only thing I‚Äôm upset about is you pushing yourself. You told me those potions lose their effectiveness the more you use them in a day. By the third dosage, the effects usually end in 15 minutes, right?

‚Ä¶

(sighs) Sugarcube, is now really the time to be muttering about alterations to the formula? Here, up on a mountain with me?... (chuckles a bit) there‚Äôs that smile‚Ä¶

\[hair scratches\]

What? I‚Äôm just scratching my partner on the head, is that such a bad thing, darling?¬†

‚Ä¶.

No need to get all flustered, sugar. (teases) I can tell you like it, always have. So just sit back and enjoy it, alright?

‚Ä¶

(concerned) what do ya mean you don‚Äôt deserve it, baby?

‚Ä¶

Sweetheart, I told you that it was okay. We just live different lives, you don‚Äôt need to worry about keeping up with me.

‚Ä¶

(scoffs) Yes, I know who Avery is. What did that jerk tell you?

‚Ä¶

\[the wind is still running, but it slows down as the listener describes what Avery told them\]

(clicks tongue) ugh, doesn‚Äôt surprise me. That creep has been staring at me since they joined the guild. I swear, they‚Äôd be out the door if they hadn‚Äôt taken down a wyvern before they joined. It makes sense he‚Äôd try to claim I should only date an adventurer.

And knowing you‚Ä¶my sweet, wonderful Artificer? His words probably wormed their way inside of your handsome head, didn‚Äôt they?... Before you say anything, let me look you in the eyes?

‚Ä¶

(sighs) I don‚Äôt know why you decided to give Avery‚Äôs taunts the time of day. But you really shouldn‚Äôt, alright? Cause I‚Äôm with you, not them, or any of the other adventurers in the guild.

‚Ä¶

(shushing) hey now, quit that kinda talk. I told ya, it doesn‚Äôt matter if you aren‚Äôt as in shape as me. Your size and strength have nothing to do with why I love you, sugarcube.

(gentle) do you understand that, or do ya need a recap?

‚Ä¶

(laughs) alright, alright. Fine, suppose I can explain a tad. Now let‚Äôs see, I think it was a few months after you started working down at the alchemy labs‚Ä¶ You were dropping off a potion for us, the first test batch of that stamina brew.

I had to be the one to answer the door, since there were only a few of us at the guild hall that day. And Avery certainly wasn‚Äôt going to do it, that bum. So, when you brought me that package, our eyes met‚Ä¶ And then you went on a little tangent about my necklace.

(chuckling) you really were adorable, telling me all about the heritage of my homelands jewelry craft, and our traditions. Even if I knew that our dragonfang necklaces were worn as a symbol of our heritage, it felt fresh when you told it.¬†

I didn‚Äôt really go to the laboratory often, before that day. But I managed to find a few excuses after we met. Seeing your cute face was always worth the trips down there. Even if I didn‚Äôt always know what you were talking about. But that never stopped you from trying to help me understand, darling.

‚Ä¶

(warm and loving) Honestly, that patience of yours is just one of the many reasons I love you so much. You never looked at me and assumed I was too stupid to understand, just because I was a barbarian. You treated me like a friend, and a student, never talking down to me, or letting me feel foolish.

Of course, your bravery was a big part of it as well. Some might call it foolish, but the way you stand up to help whenever a monster invades the city, evacuating individuals to the labs under stress? That‚Äôs not something everyone can do while staying calm, but you manage. And for someone without combat training? That‚Äôs a miracle.

\[kiss\]

(cheerful) And let‚Äôs not forget, you were the first one to ask me out, on a date. That took guts as well.

‚Ä¶

Please, even if I had a crush on you too, I wasn‚Äôt gonna ask you out. Slaying a dragon is easy, no fear of the dragon saying no and crushing my heart.

When you mustered up the courage to finally ask me to coffee, well‚Ä¶my heart wouldn‚Äôt stop pounding. I honestly couldn‚Äôt tell which of us had more red in the cheeks. And I‚Äôd just come back from a goblin hunt without washing up! (laughs)

‚Ä¶

(flustered) you are the only one I know who‚Äôd call me beautiful while I was dripping with goblin blood and mean it‚Ä¶ But that‚Äôs just one of the things I love most about you. You always accepted every aspect of me. Woman, barbarian, girlfriend, adventurer, heavy eater, snorer‚Ä¶ You accepted all of it.

(wistful) Every disagreement we had over the past year we‚Äôve been together felt like nothing. You know how to calm me down when I work up, and try so hard to stop yourself from breaking down‚Ä¶ Which meant I knew it was serious, whenever you did. And those were the times I knew to just‚Ä¶

\[tightening hug\]

(whisper) wrap my arms around you, pulling you close to me‚Ä¶and brush my hand along your back, and tell you to let everything out‚Ä¶¬†

‚Ä¶

(softly) Even if you wanted to go on an adventure with me, because you were afraid of Avery‚Äôs words. That I couldn‚Äôt settle for a non adventurer‚Ä¶the fact you were willing to try, means more to me than anything else.

They would tear others down, and you would try to build yourself up to stay with me. That alone tells me everything I need to know. Your love for me? Shines, through the effort you put into making this date special.

\[flicks forehead\]

‚Ä¶

(teasing) I didn‚Äôt flick you that hard, sugarcube. It‚Äôs just a small lil tap, to remind you that insecurity ain‚Äôt necessary. I‚Äôm with you, cause I love you. Not some big, muscle bound adventurer. I‚Äôm in love with my sweet, adorable bookworm. And I wouldn‚Äôt have anyone else as my partner, plan n simple.

\[the couple hold a kiss for a few seconds, as the wind slowly dies down\]

(focused) Seems like the winds died down, should make our descent a lot easier now.

‚Ä¶

(stern) Darling, you aren‚Äôt feeling well, we‚Äôre heading back home, getting you some soup, and cuddling till you fall asleep.

‚Ä¶

(soft, but still stern) No ifs or buts, sugarcube. I‚Äôm not pushing you till you pass out. We can come back and try again another day, without doing a lot of physically intense work beforehand. I want you to be safe and well rested, when I show you the full view. Do you understand?

‚Ä¶

\[Kiss\]

That‚Äôs the bookworm I love‚Ä¶Take my hand, and we‚Äôll head back down, ok?

In senior year, I secretly orchestrated a psychological revenge plot ‚Äî feeding his paranoia, isolating him socially, and ruining his reputation. He later claimed it drove him to self-harm. I felt conflicted, but saw it as karmic payback. We haven‚Äôt spoken in years.

As a disclaimer before I write this, I want to take a second to make my own position on my actions clear. This happened about 5 years ago and I don‚Äôt think about it that often. It‚Äôs one of those things I regret but am glad happened; it served my development and made me reconcile with the destructive way in which revenge can take you over.

To start the story, I moved in 8th grade. The school I went to was very different than all my other experiences; I had moved a lot as a kid. I didn‚Äôt have that hard time making friends, as I had gotten so used to moving so often; however, something was still missing. The people that I was hanging out with afforded me social connections; however, they were relatively shallow. I didn‚Äôt really enjoy lunch unless I was in some sort of political debate. I tended to stay quiet because not of the conversations amused me.

 I then became closer to a friend from math class, let‚Äôs call him Leo. He wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúpopular‚Äù but I was never one to mind about that. In a sense, our friendships inception was likely an amalgamation of me of me looking for a friendship that didn‚Äôt feel superficial and him leaching onto me because I was in ‚Äúthe popular group‚Äù and was nice to him. His mother texted my mom to invite me over winter break (mind you, 8th grade was a weird time to be having your mother text your friends mom to invite you over but I didn‚Äôt think much of it because I knew that he lacked social skills and it didn‚Äôt bother me). At the time, he was just a nice kid that I felt like I could talk too about real stuff going on in my life and it felt nice. There was also a weird component of me being some sort of ‚Äúmentor‚Äù to him (writing this out makes me cringe). I was hesitant to hang out with him and later declined, however, I was interested in getting to know him and saw him as a school friend. 

Flash forward to Freshman year and we hung out a bit over summer. I was never one to value popularity when I saw most the people I sat with at lunch as superficial; however, it felt important to have a place to sit during lunch. Although the general consensus was that Leo was weird, I ended up inviting Leo to sit with us during lunch. At this time, people were starting to talk about sex. I asked a girl (Let‚Äôs call her Haley) who was more nerdy and she seemed relatively interested, although there was no emotional connection between us. We talked about having sex at school but it never came into fruition because we were both young and scared. I don‚Äôt want to get too attached to this story because it is a bit of a side plot but it will be important later. It ended up blowing up when her friend ratted her out and told the counselors what she did. Turns out, she had been doing this and sending nudes to 10% of the guys in our grade. Haley ended up getting slutshamed, dropped by all her friends, missing prom (and not being asked), and essentially being the scapegoat for everything (even though there were at least 20 guys implicated.) I feel bad for my complicity in Haley‚Äôs story and don‚Äôt have excuses for it.

Fast forward to the end of Freshman year, Haley and Leo took the bus together and seemed to bond. People had told me that they were potentially romantically interested in each other; however, Leo told me he wasn‚Äôt and I had no reason not to take him at face value.  A picture of them walking in the neighborhood together ended up being leaked to the whole school and, after asking him about it, it became clear that Leo and her were dating. I had reason to believe that Leo was likely insecure about my past with Haley so I tried not to pressure him into talking about her. Even when everything came out about them to the school, he denied it when asked and got made fun of for liking her. It was sad to watch from the outside but I felt I couldn‚Äôt help because my past involvement with it. To add to this, Leo‚Äôs family was opposed to him dating her for cultural reasons, meaning everything had to be kept a secret. He didn‚Äôt feel like he could tell his classmates because he was possessive and insecure about her past, he couldn‚Äôt tell his family because they banned him dating, and he couldn‚Äôt tell me because I had a past with her. 

At the end of summer, Haley broke things off with Leo in a respectful way. As she had been slut shamed her entire freshmen year, Haley and her parents thought it would be optional for her to change schools for a fresh start. They had a lot of money and sent to her to a good Christian private school. I‚Äôm not sure the exact reasons as to why they broke it off but I know that it was something related to her having a fresh start in a new environment. However, Leo was vengeful. Although they were still hooking up in the start of freshman year, Leo dedicated his life to making sure that she would pay for breaking up with him and wouldnt be afforded the change of scenery she so desperately needed. He ended up finding out who asked her to prom, making friends with him through my mutual friends and setting a long plot to leak her nudes to the entire school that she just moved too. I can only imagine the pain she went through. He ended up cancelling their prom date, took someone else, and, again, she was slutshamed by her entire grade. This was a long plot & I won‚Äôt go too far into the details but he really put a lot of time and effort to put her humiliation into fruition. 

In sophomore year, he progressively got more spiteful. He ended up holding resentment towards me, as well. I‚Äôm sure a lot of it was his anger at his parents (he was acting out and saying really mean things to them (e.g. you will never meet my children)), and the bullying he dealt with for dating Haley. Our friendship got out of control and he would weirdly try and assert himself and tell me that he‚Äôs better than me. 

During this time, my brother, who is one grade younger than I was, had a girlfriend. This is a really long story but to sum it up, he ended up turning my brother‚Äôs girlfriend against him and sabotaging their relationship. I didn‚Äôt know this at the time. 

As he progressively got more out of control, we began to distance ourselves while still maintaining ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù status. He had ventured out into the different groups with friends that I had introduced him too (I was a floater, he had poor social skills) and bonding with them. It felt good he was making friends but at the same time I felt boxed out.

COVID had happened and not much went on junior year. I would say that he got progressively more spiteful and I started to seek out other friendships. In the end of Junior year, a friend I had introduced him too, (lets call him Joseph) had confided in him and got closer with him. Joseph, a well-intentioned, open-minded, caring person let Leo into all his secrets. Amongst those, was a complicated relationship he had with a girl (let‚Äôs call her Eve) who Leo got progressively closer too. It got to the point where they would do group calls and then Eve would call Leo one on one. Eve never saw Leo romantically, though I believe Leo might have. He ended up sabotaging that relationship because Leo was playing Joseph the entire time. He thought Joseph was dumb and had no direction in life (which isn‚Äôt true). 

The summer going into senior year, I had learned the ways in which he sabotaged my brother‚Äôs relationship a year ago. I was shattered. Though the signs were always there, I wondered how my best friend could ever do something like that to my brother. I became enraged and felt culpable merely by association. One day in the summer, as we were smoking weed, I had a neighbor that looked like one of our deans come outside to take out her trash. I told him that it was the dean and he and I both ran to the car. He was paranoid about it because our school had drug tests. It wasn‚Äôt a piss test either; it was a hair test. I told him to shave his head and his eyebrows; that‚Äôs the only way he could be safe. He ended up shaving his head bald, buying a wig, and no eyebrows to start the senior year.

It didn‚Äôt take long for senior year to start off and for him to start blackmailing me (he told me his uncle (a minister from a foreign country) would call all the schools I wanted to apply too and put in a bad word for me). I didn‚Äôt take the bait. He crashed out and said he no longer wanted my friendship.

Immediately, right after he did that, I told Joseph everything that had happened. He had also done many terrible things (another 10 page story) to my friend (let‚Äôs call him Robin) and I had screenshots to prove everything. I went to school that next day, told them both everything that Leo had done to them and we trauma-bonded. I left the ‚Äúpopular‚Äù group and started sitting with them at lunch; we started a new table with many different assortments of people that we liked. 

Leo, as I‚Äôm sure you all might gather, is paranoid. Joseph, Robin, and I all knew this. I used that paranoia to tell him that Robin and Joseph know about the thinfs he has done and are plotting to ruin him. It might sound crazy but you have to understand I was speaking this kid‚Äôs language. I ended up acting as somewhat of a double agent. Robin, Joseph, and I would devise different subplots for what we would say they were plotting and we would laugh at them. It felt like a game to us. This kid had all fucked us over in various ways and he trauma bonded off of his pain. Meanwhile, I was using the double agent excuse whenever I would hang out with them all weekend and he had nothing to do. It was clear that he had burned all of his bridges and didn‚Äôt have any friends left. Still, he trusted me to gather intel as to what there plans were. I would spend hours everyday, feeding off his anxiety and pain. I thought about all the people he hurt, me, Haley, Joseph, Robin, my brother; all this did was motivate me and expose a side of myself I had never seen. It got to the point where Joseph and Robin were progressively less engaged in the plot and I was the only one feeding off this. I ended up secretly starting a rumor that he impregnated someone from another school, exposed that he was a year older than everyone (which was (weirdly) his deepest, darkest secret) through public records from voter registration. All the while, I was just the double agent gathering intel and giving Leo selective intel Joseph and Robin wanted. This would included staged voice memos of them pretending to be angry, among many other things. 

Leo graduated senior year without any friends; wasn‚Äôt invited to a single graduation party. All the rumors came about and he was pretty much known as the weird kid. Meanwhile, Joseph, Robin, and I would throw parties and had a very fun end to our high school experience. I loved watching him crumble; lose all his friends and being ostracized within the grade. It became clear that Leo was suffering immensely and I fed off of it.

Fast forward to the summer, I can‚Äôt remember the exact circumstances but I told Leo everything that I did. That the whole time I said Leo and Robin were plotting against him, I was playing mind games with him. It was a contested conversation and I‚Äôll never forget it. At first, it felt good to get off my chest; however, what he told me mind-boggled me. He told me there was a reason he would wear hoodies everyday: he was having panic attacks every single night and cutting himself. He claimed to even have tried to hang himself and his father walked in on him. I don‚Äôt know if I believe that because this is a manipulative person that lies to guilt people but I felt remorseful about my actions. He told me I had mentally handicapped him and destroyed his family and wanted me to pay for his therapy. I apologized but I didn‚Äôt cry. So long as he didn‚Äôt die, in my eyes at the time, I have no emotional culpability and I owe him nothing. In a way, I felt like I was supposed to be his Karma. I had watched him destroy so many people around him and thought the only way he‚Äôd learn is if he faced someone smarter than him; someone who can beat him at his own game.

We ended up meeting for at a Barnes and Nobles for coffee a year later. He seemed fine. He claims to have a girlfriend. Although he tried to flex that he was going to a better university than me (mine is objectively better), I didn‚Äôt take the bait, I just laughed. I could tell that I changed him but I wasn‚Äôt sure in what ways. I‚Äôm not sure I can ever take him out of his self-indulged ways but he seemed like a more introspective person who had at least been to some therapy. I left it off, blocked him, and haven‚Äôt spoke to him since. I plan on reaching out to him in another 6 years (4 years have passed.)

I feel remorse for him but not as much as I feel for myself. I know not to let myself stoop that low and indulge myself with that hate and negativity. It was the inception of my substance-use (as it was my only escape from the altering of my hateful psyche) and now here I am, four years later, picking up all the pieces.",0,1753324008.0,revengestories,10,0.47,False

He is autistic and has a compulsion to throw food. He is not very verbal, but one thing he does say is, ‚Äúthrow food‚Äù very excitedly. It seems like he thinks it‚Äôs funny.

On the first day when walking to class, he got away from me and ran into another classroom, grabbed a teacher‚Äôs iced coffee and threw it all over the room.

Later during lunch, I guess he walked up to another student who was eating salad, picked it up and threw it all over the lunch room. I have had very serious talks with him and told him that we cannot throw food and that it‚Äôs wrong/unkind/etc. He seems to understand that it‚Äôs wrong. I asked him how he would feel if someone threw his food and without hesitation, he said ‚Äúsad‚Äù.

The behavior is escalating. He‚Äôs quick! He will elope and find any food wherever he can and just chuck it. 

With another teacher today, he got out of her reach and ran into the teacher‚Äôs lounge and threw a whole casserole that one of the teachers brought in. It just continues, cereal, cheez its, whatever he can find! I had no idea how many snacks are around our school.

This is a private school and we are very small. Honestly, I don‚Äôt even know if we have the resources to help. But he is a sweet kid and I want to see if there is some sort of solution. What causes this compulsion and how do you deal with it? I spoke to mom and she cried to me, she doesn‚Äôt know what to do. Admin is trying to figure it out, but they‚Äôre also at a loss I guess?

6‚Äô
280lbs
High cholesterol and major depressive disorder, both well maintained. I take Vilazodone(40mg daily) and Rosuvastatin (40 mg daily).


Apologies in advance for all the detail that follows. It‚Äôs been a long and frustrating journey.
Bloodwork has been completed regularly throughout the last 5 years and aside from cholesterol ratios (low HDL) and low-ish testosterone (300-ish) results haven‚Äôt shown anything interesting.


My main complaint - I have been experiencing constant headaches for the last 5+ years. Onset was gradual with no obvious cause. Pain is almost always a 3, sometimes up to a 6, and never less than a 2. They are accompanied by dizziness, light headedness, brain fog, difficulty finding words, difficulty concentrating, and very mild tinnitus. No sensitivity to sound, lights, smells, etc.. the only time my discomfort is slightly improved is when I‚Äôm laying down.
I have had occasional episodes of vertigo lasting from a few seconds to a couple of days. 3 episodes in the last 5 years, never prior.


Around the time of onset I did have a pinched nerve in my neck. Again no obvious onset here - slept on it funny or something. The associated tingling in the arm went away with physical therapy.


I saw a neurologist for the pinched nerve and he ordered a brain & spine MRI. Results were unremarkable except for the mildly slipped disc/pinched nerve in my neck.
I saw another neurologist who tried treating the headache with a variety of medications, including but not limited to topiramate, NSAID, Sumatriptan, CGRP, and Botox. None of them lead to any improvement in symptoms whatsoever.


The neurologist posed that the symptoms may be related to the 2 anti-depressants I was taking at the time (Effexor & Wellbutrin). I tapered off of them (with psych approval) and had no improvement over the course of 6 months. I ended up starting back up on a ‚Äúnewer‚Äù antidepressant after that as a result of significant worsening in depression symptoms.
I was referred to a cardiologist to see if it may be POTS or something else cardiology related. Cardiac ultrasound was normal. Stress test showed vasovagal syncope but negative for POTS.
Around this time my psych thought perhaps my symptoms were anxiety related. I enrolled in an outpatient anxiety support group and found that while I could somewhat relate to some of the symptoms, my anxiety is exceptionally mild (nervous in social situations, avoid confrontation, etc.).


After that the psych tried to address the difficulty with attention using adderall. Interestingly, this was the most effective medication I took to improve any symptoms, but I found the downsides of the meds to be hard to overcome (trouble sleeping, short tempter, etc.).
Eventually I got my PCP to refer me to a major academic university. I saw approximately 5 different neurologists there with varying specialties and was referred to a headache clinic. The headache clinic had me reduce caffeine intake (3 cups of coffee -> 2 or less daily). No improvement. They referred me for a sleep study. Sleep study showed mild sleep apnea. Got a CPAP and wore it daily for over a year with zero improvement to symptoms.


The headache clinic also referred me to a specialist who was doing a study related to spontaneous CSF leaks. Physician had me take some self-assessments at home and eventually suggested I would be a candidate for more invasive imaging (CT myleogram with contrast injected in the spine) followed by an epidural blood patch.

Although the imaging was negative, the doctor suggested I would still have a ~30% chance of having a CSF leak that didn‚Äôt show up in imaging. He identified a few areas that looked ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù. I ended up getting 4 different blood patches to attempt and fix the suspicious areas. Although I would have improvement in symptoms for a few days during recovery (I would lay flat), the improvement never lasted.


The academic medical center neurologist team also referred me to Otolarynogy for vestibular testing (VNG, vHIT, VEMP and rotary chair).

Something‚Äôs off.,"This moment came from a real feeling I had. One of those days where everything looks almost the same, but off by just one click. Like the world slid one inch to the left and forgot to tell you.

So I wrote it into my novel. Here‚Äôs an early scene where the main character notices something wrong at a Starbucks he knows too well. He suddenly can‚Äôt tell if the change is in the barista, the world, or himself.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

There‚Äôs a Starbucks at 5th and Market that I frequent infrequently. I can‚Äôt remember how long it‚Äôs been there. But I know it well enough to know something was off. Same barista behind the counter. Always looks at me like he knows a secret I don‚Äôt ‚Äîsmug, half-smile, arms inked to the knuckle.

But today‚Ä¶ something looked, well, different.
His tattoos were all still there, winding up his arms like ivy, but they weren‚Äôt the same.
Last time, I could‚Äôve sworn there was a koi fish
twisting around his left wrist, flames licking at its tail. Now, it‚Äôs an anchor. A heavy, old-school sailor tattoo that wasn‚Äôt there before.

‚ÄúGrande Americano, right?‚Äù he asked, like he always did.
‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said, eyes still on his wrist.
Just an anchor. No koi. No flames.
But I could still feel the heat.

‚ÄúRough night?‚Äù he asked.
His eyes bored into me like he already knew.
I nodded, even though it wasn‚Äôt. Not technically.
Just another night that could‚Äôve been dark and stormy but wasn‚Äôt. Just another night where the world felt slightly‚Ä¶ off.

‚ÄúRight,‚Äù he said, sliding the cup across the counter. ‚ÄúStay grounded.‚Äù

I glanced down. My name was scrawled across the cup in black marker. But it wasn‚Äôt my name. Not Tekel. Something else.
Something that felt right but wasn‚Äôt.
Something that tasted like copper and static and the smoke of a life I almost lived.

I blinked. Looked again.
Just ‚ÄúTekel.‚Äù
Same as always.

But for a second there, it was something else.
And that‚Äôs when I felt the ground shift beneath me ‚Äî like the world slid one inch to the left and forgot to mention it.

1m7s7y6,https://www.reddit.com/r/MauLer/comments/1m7s7y6/people_think_they_want_soul_but_they_want/,"People Think They Want Soul, But They Want STANDARDS.","Something that really bugs me is when people talk about old reviewers on Youtube like MovieBob, Angry Video Game Nerd, Nostalgia Critic, and Zero Punctuation and claim that the reason that era of Youtube was so good was because the reviewers were working on their reviewers FOR FREE because they enjoyed it and the money came later.

THIS. IS. NOT. TRUE.

It really pissed me off seeing TheGamerFromMars say that MovieBob started out making review videos for fun because that was NEVER, EVER the case. From the very beginning MovieBob was making his videos for websites because he got into media criticism at a time when, yes, Youtube wasn't paying creators, but websites like ScrewAttack, Escapist, ThatGuyWithTheGlasses, Machinima, and Destructoid were paying people to make videos for them.

It annoys me because the aesthetic being sold to people was that they were normal dudes in their basement talking about nerdy things, because that's what they were, and people assumed that they were doing it because they genuinely enjoyed it, not because they were being paid and signed contracts. It's like how people think that Nirvana songs were mostly played live with minimal overdubs and that Kurt Cobain didn't even want Smells Like Teen Spirit to be a hit and tried to sabotage it when the truth is that Nirvana's Nevermind album is one of the most overproduced albums of all-time, with Smells Like Teen Spirit alone allegedly having around 30 vocal dubs. If you don't believe me, listen to the isolated vocals on Youtube where you can clearly hear that it sounds like a choir of Kurt Cobains.

Heck, if you want to go really mask-off, most pop music that you think is overproduced actually has very few tracks. I could go on a bit of a tangent on this, but the gist is that if everything sounds fine while recording it (bass, keys, guitar, vocals, drums) you don't need to do much aside from ensuring the volume levels are good. With genres like punk, metal, and rock, touch-ups and dubs need to be done. If you need an example, check out the difference in sound quality between Venom's Welcome To Hell, which had very little production and was mostly recorded live with minimal, if any, overdubs, and compare it with Iron Maiden's The Number Of The Beast, which was released around the same time and much more heavily produced.

My point is mainly that what people thought was happening with the content being shown to them and the reality of that content was often radically different, to the point where even MovieBob saying ""I'm being paid to do this,"" repeatedly, wasn't enough to make TheGamerFromMars think that MovieBob was doing anything without the expectation of being paid by somebody at any point during his videomaking career. That's also likely why his content never improved, because he never had any incentive whatsoever to even purchase a better-quality microphone for himself.

Anyways, what inspired this angry outburst was a comment saying that what they want from content creators nowadays is SOUL, like what Nostalgia Critic had, not 12-hour videos, but I don't think that's what they want.

What I think people want is what Nostalgia Critic offered, and what EFAP offers, which is the following:

Consistency - You always know what you're going to get and you get it on a regular basis. No matter what EFAP is talking about or how they experiment with the production, it's always going to be a group of guys chatting about something, just like you're always going to get skits and commentary from Nostalgia Critic on a somewhat consistent schedule.

Quality - Admittedly this is somewhat debatable on EFAP, but what I mean by quality is the expectation that, regardless of the topic chosen, the amount of effort going into the presentation of the topic is consistent from video to video, with occasional productions that exceed the baseline level of quality. It basically means that if Nostalgia Critic is known for 20-minute videos on everything he does, you can expect that he'll make a 20-minute video with the same level of effort expended if the topic is the banned Aqua Teen Hunger Force episode Shake Like Me as he would for his favourite episode of Doug (his favourite cartoon). That's just not really something you see these days, with it being considered an acceptable thing for Youtubers to be like ""Yeah, this video is going to suck and I barely did any research, but whatever, donate to my Patreon to watch better videos that are paywalled, and also I have Subscribestar, OnlyFans, and a Discord that you have to pay to access. Don't you go having a parasocial relationship with me unless you're giving me money, don't you do it, unless you're giving me money. I need money or else my family will starve, but don't feel pressured to donate, unless you're a true fan that really likes me.""

Standards - This is something that EFAP kinda offers, but not really. There's something of a misconception that standards means quality, which is part of the equation, but it isn't really what it's used for in this context. Standards in this context refers to how in the golden age of The Simpsons there was a list of rules that were applied to the characters and the plots of the show. One of those rules was that The Simpsons could be stupid and inconsiderate but not malicious, which basically meant that Homer could steal a bunch of things from Ned Flanders, but never anything that directly harmed Flanders and always giving the things back if Flanders asked for them. As in, Homer could steal Ned's lawnmower, but could not destroy the lawnmower or deny Ned his lawnmower if he wanted to use it.

It's a reason why Jerk-Ass Homer is seen as the moment when The Simpsons started to decline in quality even if people didn't know why. Basically, the showrunner who was in-charge during the classic era left and a new showrunner was put in-charge, which resulted in the standards generally being discarded and the most noticeable change was that Homer became noticeably more cruel, and also became very intentional with his cruelty, and often showed very little remorse to the damage he would cause.

It's why pretty much every Youtuber who has a persona of any kind drops that persona eventually and just speaks normally. It's also why it's become such a trope in 'lazy' movies like Illumination movies that every character basically talks like a normal person. Even the characters from other franchises with established ways of talking and acting, like Mario and The Grinch, will basically just talk and act like normal people (Chris Pratt's normal speaking voice as Mario, The Grinch's ""Now that's a good cup of coffee,"" in the Illumination movie) in those kinds of movies.

It bugs me because, as a writer, the temptation is always there to just not give my characters personalities because not only would it be easier, but my fans and fellow developers behind-the-scenes are always like ""You gotta make them talk and act normal, you need to have your characters be relatable,"" and, well, I hate feeling like I'm being punished and scolded for writing a character like Cheese The Vampire that isn't normal, but is arrogant, narcissistic, violent, and manipulative. I don't want her to be relatable if being relatable means shaving away her personality, but the temptation is always there to just make her 'normal' and have her give up her wicked ways to hang out with a cute animal, drinking coffee, and saying ""Now that's a good cup of coffee.""

How does this apply to EFAP? Mainly to the fact that the hosts (Mauler, Fringy, Rags) have avatars that are non-human, and they used to incorporate that into the show by talking about Fringy as though he is actually green and has a long nose, Mauler as though he's actually some sort of demon wearing a weird mask, and Rags as though he's actually a dog. There was a time when Rags would say ""Let's try to stay in character, I'm a dog not a human,"" and I think we've passed that time, which is a shame because it's a pretty subtle shift in the general tone of EFAP, but I feel like it's a noticeable one mainly because it's a subtle indication that Rags isn't trying as hard anymore to maintain the standards he once set for himself.

The lack of standards is something that I'm kinda passionate about because I really hate that it feels like the vast majority of Youtube is just normal dudes talking normally about the same general topics. There are outliers, sure, but it's annoying that it feels like if a Youtuber isn't already just speaking normally in their videos, they eventually will be pushed into doing that. It happened with Logan Paul, it's happening with MrBeast, it's probably happened to your favourite creators, and if it hasn't happened to a creator you like, it probably will.

I just don't like living in a world where my entertainment consists roughly 95% of dudes recording stuff in their basement (or a set) talking normally about whatever was popular on Twitter the previous day (or week). It feels dystopian, but at least in a dystopia the leaders feel like they have to put in effort to keep the citizens from rebelling in a meaningful way. We've got a lamer dystopia than China, and I'd like our standards for a dystopia to be a little higher, which is another way of saying that I wish our manufactured pop stars were more like BTS and less like that prick who sang Ordinary, and I wish that our thought leaders were charismatic and put more effort into controlling the conversations we have instead of dudes like Captain Midnight voluntarily doing it because it's easy money.",1,1753323160.0,MauLer,1,0.6,False

1m7s6sd,https://i.redd.it/xcmo18mndqef1.jpeg,El Pistol√≥n,"This is El Pistol√≥n, a drink I put together as a nod to Puerto Rican ingredients and flavors.

It‚Äôs a simple riff on the Revolver (which, if I‚Äôm not mistaken, is itself a modern riff on the Manhattan: bourbon, coffee liqueur, and orange bitters). I‚Äôm originally from Puerto Rico, and I try to incorporate ingredients from the island whenever I make drinks at home, so this was my interpretation of the Revolver using Puerto Rican flavors.

My first attempt was a straightforward substitution: I swapped bourbon for Ron del Barrilito 3 Estrellas, kept the Kahl√∫a, and used orange bitters. It didn‚Äôt quite work. So I tried splitting the base with a touch of Cointreau to balance the coffee notes and bring out the citrus, which helped, but still didn‚Äôt feel quite right.

Then, on a recent trip to PR, I picked up a bottle of Crab Island Coffee Infusion rum. I‚Äôd had it in a few cocktails before and thought it might work for this. I removed the Kahl√∫a entirely and used the coffee-infused rum as the base. The result was a much cleaner, more balanced drink, with the coffee coming through nicely and the citrus notes complementing it well.

Here‚Äôs the recipe I settled on:

El Pistol√≥n
1.5 oz Crab Island Coffee Infusion
0.25 oz Cointreau
2 dashes orange bitters
Stirred and served up with an orange peel garnish

I find the drink to be balanced and approachable. The coffee and orange notes play well together, and while the finish could be a little longer, it's a pleasant sip overall. Since the coffee rum is lower proof than something like bourbon, the drink ends up a bit lighter. 

I‚Äôd love to hear any thoughts, feedback, or ideas for refinement.

As for the name: Pistol√≥n is a loose Puerto Rican Spanish slang translation of ‚Äúrevolver,‚Äù and it also happens to be the name of a popular reggaet√≥n track from the early 2000s. It felt fitting enough to go with.

Is that normal?","For context: I met Xavier in college, we were in the same class and worked on a group project together. Of course, we had to exchange numbers to communicate details regarding the project, but we just kept texting throughout the whole semester in a private chat (LOL should've noticed sooner that he was interested), talking about classes, professors, and stuff, cause we're both engineering majors. There were a few times during the semester when he was really helpful, and I was so grateful for this help, so it made me realize he was a really kind person. Well, after we graduated, X and I kept texting. He asked about my summer plans and asked me to grab a coffee with him. I said yes, but kinda ended up planning the whole thing? cause he said he was open to anything and unsure where we should go or what we should do. I didn't like that, to be honest, maybe cause my idea of dating comes from movies, but I find it very attractive when the other person plans the whole thing, or at least as an idea \*eye roll\*. But I get it, maybe he was trying to be considerate cause I was nervous and at one point, gave him the impression I did not want to hang out, so he kindly offered me a way out.   
Anyways, that hangout was fun (even though I was freaking out prior), and we did another one a week or so later. I ended up planning that one as well.... but he did offer for us to check out my favorite spot, which was nice ig since it was like sharing something personal to me. Again, super fun, we talked and talked, and I genuinely enjoyed spending time with him even though I was again freaking out prior. He's very straightforward, kind, very gentlemanly (in the sense, he moves me to the inside of the sidewalk, and offers to hold my purse), he pushes me to talk about myself because I struggle with that (thinking no one wants to hear about me), and he ALWAYS cheers me up or makes sure I don't downplay or talk bad about myself. 

Here's the problem: whenever he texts, I spend so much time thinking about what to say or how to answer (Like some very serious overthinking), when I am a very smart person, so I don't know why I am like this with him. I literally spend 1-2 hours thinking about what to say, and when I respond, I just try to imagine that he's like one of my friends. He has a pet name for me that he recently started using for me, which I find sweet, but I can't use one back because the only one I like is babe and that feels too much because we haven't put labels on us yet. And he'll use kissing emojis, but I can't, I literally just got comfortable with putting a heart on messages. He's always texting me very sweet messages, and complimenting me, but I just say ""me too"" or something and I meant it but I just can't say more. I do like him but I am kind of unsure and insecure about the relationship, worried about getting hurt, him knowing too many details about me(cause I value privacy so much), and the difference in our financial status. I like talking on the phone more but he doesn't so there are often things that just remain unsaid/unsend on my end because I'd rather say it. Texting and then waiting for him to reply makes me overthink if I said too much or something weird, even though the few times I have taken the risk, he reciprocated with the same feeling if not more. So is this normal? How do I go about handling it? Do I need a therapist \*crying emoji\*? How do I get more comfortable if I want us to stay together? really any advice is appreciated.

I also love cooking, especially healthy stuff that tricks my brain into thinking I'm a responsible adult. If you‚Äôre into fitness, we might just be accountability buddies and can hype each other up üí™

I‚Äôve recently fallen down the skincare rabbit hole. At this point, my face has become an experiment ground but glow goals xD üòå

I‚Äôm a huge history nerd. Give me ancient legends, epic battles, or ghost stories and I‚Äôm hooked. Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones are my comfort shows. I game too Red Dead Redemption 2 is my favourite

As I‚Äôve looked through a few of your guys‚Äô posts I can see a handful of you can probably get where I‚Äôm coming from here. 
I‚Äôve been sick for about 15 years (half of my life), and have never found a solid diagnosis, or a comfortable treatment plan. My list of complaints is long (chronic pain, chronic stomach issues, pre cancer, heart disease, mental health stuff, the works), and honestly I‚Äôve just felt like I am one of the unluckiest people alive, since it‚Äôs constantly something new. Nothing ever gets better, something worse just moves in and I get over complaining about it. As many of you can guess, my labs are normal. Almost always. My teenaged years were spent rotting in my bed, severely malnourished due to the stomach problems. Boy, do I wish I could go back to that. My stomach is still a problem, but it‚Äôs not the thing I feel is killing me. My doctor constantly told me ‚Äúif you exercise and drink more water, you‚Äôll get better‚Äù. Finally in my mid 20s I started to feel a little okay. So I started working out, 4-5 times a week. I drink a minimum of 1.5 liters of water, I‚Äôve taken vitamins, I did therapy, physical and mental. I stopped smoking (vaping and mj), stopped drinking coffee/energy drinks/soda, I don‚Äôt eat out anymore, less processed food, and tbh, I feel worse. 
I‚Äôve never felt this bad in my life. My cardiologist is very kind to me and seems to understand a little, but every other doctor brushes me off. Like my life, or lack thereof, just doesn‚Äôt matter. I have zero quality of life, I have no friends (who wants to be friends with someone whose stuck in bed, I guess), no family (mom died of a mystery illness when I was a kid), and I just feel trapped. I can‚Äôt work so I have no money. I read books, play video games, listen to music, but I know I‚Äôm missing out on life. This was kind of a rant but if you made it this far, do you have any advice?

*Where Math Meets Mayhem at Progressive Field*

### 1. Parse the Odds: Numbers Don‚Äôt Lie (Mostly)

The Cleveland Guardians (-118) are the sensible pick here, with implied odds of \~51% to win, while the Baltimore Orioles (+195) offer a tempting 51% implied chance to pull off an underdog upset. But let‚Äôs not let math dull the drama.

* **Win Rates**: Cleveland‚Äôs 61.5% success when favored? That‚Äôs the statistical equivalent of a vending machine that actually dispenses snacks. Baltimore‚Äôs 42.9% win rate as underdogs? More like a vending machine that spits out loose change and a half-eaten granola bar.
* **Run Production**: The Orioles average 4.1 runs per game, just edging out Cleveland‚Äôs 3.9. But context matters: Cleveland has outscored opponents by **18 runs in their last 10 games**, while Baltimore has lost six of seven. The Guardians‚Äô offense may not blow the roof off, but it‚Äôs reliable as a microwave‚Äîpredictable, if not exciting.
* **Pitching Matchup**: Logan Allen (Cleveland) vs. Charlie Morton (Baltimore). Morton‚Äôs experience is no joke, but the Orioles‚Äô bullpen? A cautionary tale. Their July road ERA of 5.33 is like a leaky faucet you keep ignoring, eventually flooding your basement.

### 2. Digest the News: Injuries, Streaks, and Oddities

* **Cleveland‚Äôs Secret Sauce**: Jose Ramirez is hitting home runs with the frequency of a Netflix reminder email‚Äî**four in five night games against sub-.500 teams**. Steven Kwan‚Äôs .348 OBP makes him the Guardians‚Äô human highlight reel. And let‚Äôs not forget Logan Allen, who‚Äôs as steady as a coffee shop barista on a Monday morning.

The card came in pretty quick (like 4 days), and I started using it for just normal stuff such as groceries, coffee, gas, even a few random Amazon orders. Nothing crazy. What surprised me most is how fast the cashback added up. I think I spent around $1,100 for the month (normal stuff, no big purchases) and I already saw a solid amount sitting in my cashback balance. That 1.5% on everything adds up way faster than I thought, especially when you're not chasing categories or doing mental math.

# Best 10ft USB C Cable 2025: Top Rated Options

The 10Ft USB C cable has become an essential accessory for modern technology users. As devices increasingly adopt the versatile USB C standard, the need for longer, more flexible cables grows. This article evaluates the premier 10ft USB C cables available in 2025, highlighting their features, benefits, and target users to help you choose the best option for yoru needs.

## Key features Analysis

The ideal 10ft USB C cable combines durability,fast charging,and high-speed data transfer capabilities. The following outlines vital features to consider.

**Charging speed:** The cable's ability to support Power Delivery (PD) is critical. It should be capable of handling at least 60W, ideally 100W, to fast-charge laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

A cable supporting Power Delivery enables rapid charging for compatible devices. This feature is paramount for people who need to quickly replenish their batteries, minimizing downtime and maximizing productivity. The higher the power delivery capability, the faster devices charge.

**Data Transfer Rate:** USB C cables should support fast data transfer speeds in alignment with USB 3.1 Gen 2 or USB 3.2 standards for efficient data syncing.

data transfer rate is essential for efficiently moving large files such as videos and images between devices. A cable compliant with USB 3.1 Gen 2 or USB 3.2 ensures considerable data throughput, reducing the time to transfer files. Slower data transfer speeds can impede productivity and cause frustration.

**Durability:** The cable's construction is vrey importent. Look for reinforced connectors, braided nylon exteriors, and overall build quality designed to withstand daily wear and tear.

Durability equates to longevity and reliability. reinforced connectors prevent breakage at stress points, while a braided nylon exterior protects the internal wires from damage caused by bending, twisting, and abrasion. This feature is of paramount importance for cables frequently used in mobile environments.

**Connector Type:** The quality of USB C connectors directly impacts their performance and lifespan. Connectors should be designed to fit firmly and securely.Well-designed connectors prevent connection drops during charging or data transfer.The connectors should resist corrosion and maintain good electrical conductivity over time, ensuring a stable and reliable connection. This is an essential, yet often overlooked aspect of cable quality.

**Compatibility:** The cable needs to work with a diverse range of devices, including smartphones, tablets, laptops, and gaming consoles.

Broad compatibility guarantees the cable can be used in manifold situations. A universal USB C cable will eliminate the need for multiple proprietary cables. Device compatibility is central to versatility and user convenience.

**Cable Material and Construction:** The materials used in construction are of core importance.A cable made from quality materials will last longer and perform better.

Quality materials include copper wiring, robust insulation, and durable outer sheathing. These components work together to facilitate efficient power delivery and shield the internal wiring from harm. The cable's structural integrity directly results in its longevity and reliability.

## Core benefits

**Enhanced reach and Flexibility:** The extended length eliminates the restriction of nearby outlets, enabling users to comfortably use their devices while charging or tethered to another device.

The added length allows users to settle comfortably on a sofa or in bed while continuing to use their devices. This makes it advantageous for individuals who like to remain linked to their devices without being constrained by limited cable length.the resulting freedom improves productivity and user experience.

**Improved Convenience in Workspaces:** With greater length, users can connect devices that are further apart without needing extensions or rearranging furniture.

A 10Ft USB C cable facilitates more ergonomic setups in multiple workspace environments, from office desks to home studios. It eliminates the need for awkward adjustments to reach devices or power outlets. Work efficiency is, in turn, bolstered by smoother integration between devices.

**Greater Versatility for Gaming:** Gamers can continue playing without being restricted by the length of a customary cable,even when seated far from the gaming console or computer.

This cable length is especially useful for gamers using external controllers or charging their devices while gaming.It facilitates relaxed play without having to sit uncomfortably close to the console or suffer the consequences of short cord limitations. Long 10ft USB C cables free the user from device-proximity restraints.

**Simplified Connections in Automobiles:** The 10ft USB C cable provides ample length to connect devices from the dashboard to the back seats of a car,making it ideal for passengers needing to charge their devices.

This facilitates easy device charging for passengers in the back seats, making it a convenient choice for longer trips. this flexibility is useful for keeping passengers' devices charged and ready for use upon arrival. This is beneficial for both entertainment and work uses during long car rides.## FAQs Section

**Does a longer USB C cable affect charging speed?**
The cable length can theoretically affect charging speed, but high-quality 10ft USB C cables are designed to minimize this impact. A cable must be well-shielded and of adequate wire gauge to deliver power efficiently over this length. Using a cable certified for Power Delivery (PD) ensures optimal charging performance.**Will a 10ft USB C cable support high-speed data transfer?**
Yes, a 10ft USB C cable is capable of supporting high-speed data transfer, provided that it adheres to USB 3.1 gen 2 or USB 3.2 specifications. Confirm that the cable specifically states that it supports these standards for optimal data transfer performance. Lower-quality cables may not be designed for high-speed data.

**Is it safe to use a generic, unbranded 10ft USB C cable?**
Using generic or unbranded cables can be risky. Poorly constructed cables may not deliver power efficiently, could damage your device, or not meet safety standards. It is indeed always best to select cables from reputable brands that have undergone testing to ensure quality and compliance with industry certifications and safety protocols.

1m7rre6,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1m7rre6/a_family_curse_or_hereditary_clairvoyance/,A family curse or hereditary clairvoyance?,"Hi reddit, this is funky but a fun story to share with those who are into spooky stuff! Probably better saved for october, or fall at the least, but it was on my mind recently so why not. Can someone chime in on what may have caused this wild chain of events in my family?

To start with some backstory: Since i can remember, both my great grandmother, grandma, and aunt + my mom have told the same story over and over. At some point during their childhood/young adult lives they‚Äôve seen a ‚Äòfigure‚Äô looming outside of their bedroom door‚Äî or in the corner if the door is shut (my personal experience. thought shutting the door was fool proof lol). the figure is a darker than black shadow, taller than most men. picture a skinny, 8ft tall, humanish shaped void looming in the middle of the night. gives me the heebie jeebies to TYPE that let alone see it with my own two god forsaken eyeballs, but anyways. that‚Äôs not the weirdest part of it truthfully, because past those points in our lives we have all had other paranormal experiences that are super random. 

My great grandmother, a devout christian woman, said she felt something push her off a ladder while she was dusting in her bedroom. Like a shove on her chest backwards, and she said god saved her by pushing her again towards her mattress, which was not lined up with where she should‚Äôve fallen. She wasn‚Äôt fond of ladders after that. Her house is to this day haunted, but whatever it is sticks to itself in one corner of the house rarely occupied by her. (this is a lil ol‚Äô lady living in a huge house) 

My grandma, mother, and aunt lived in a house for a few years (my mother was later years of high school, aunt was in middle school) where they frequently had paranormal experiences. 

My grandma had a dream before moving into the house of a little girl walking from one door to another in the master bedroom. the original doors had been hallways in the dream but in the house it was really a closet, the other room a bathroom. she had many dreams following, of a little girl showing her to rooms of the house. She later did research on the house when it was originally built and found that many of the rooms had been remodeled, turning excessive hallways into rooms and closets. 

My aunt, soon after they moved into the house, fell asleep in the living room on the couch watching tv. She clearly remembers hearing footsteps and seeing feet appear in front of her. she thought it was either my mom, or grandma coming to wake her to go to her room. But when she sat up, she saw no one and heard footsteps running away across the empty kitchen behind her. she RAN to her bed and spent the night with her blankets over her head. as would i. 

My mom‚Äôs stories are perhaps the most interesting because she has a special familiarity with the other side of spirituality. Her bedroom was the largest of the extra bedrooms, and was only ever occupied by her. no one else would even walk INTO her room unless she was home (may seem like a basic boundary lol‚Äî this was the 90s though and my grandparents don‚Äôt respect space). My grandma always says she would reach around the door to turn the light on before she would bring in laundry, and even then she would have goose bumps the entire time. What caused those goosebumps? George. Because yes my mom named the ghost haunting her bedroom, and became friends with him?? I don‚Äôt get it either but moving on. George was a funny guy apparently, he would change her radio (physically turning the knobs), disassembled her desk and stacked the pieces behind her bedroom door while she was at school one day. they had to bust the door in to get into the room. she said she would talk to him, and based on her emotions he would be more or less active accordingly. I asked her how she knew george was a guy and she said she just had a gut feeling.

A year after they moved out of that house, it burned to the ground. 

my personal experiences? well i‚Äôve had many a ghost goof around with my stuff. one notably being a ghost in an old apartment i had, he/she/they (im not as intuitive as my mom) would get a kick out of knocking my skateboard over throughout the night. i didn‚Äôt have pets at the time, and the board would be laid grip side against the paint most often, meaning there was no reason for me to find it knocked back onto its wheels at 2am every night. yet i did. I also had ‚Äòsomeone‚Äô knocking my coffee spoons across the kitchen every morning. me and my mom lived ALONE, more often me being alone in the morning with her gone to work. Faucets turned on alone. you get the gist. 

the men in the family have had a couple experiences, but nothing touches what connection the women have to the spiritual realm. I myself am not religious, but i cannot doubt that there are things we cannot completely comprehend following life and death. As someone who won‚Äôt believe until i see it, I‚Äôve seen it, and it‚Äôs FREAKY but also kinda cool. I‚Äôm curious if there are any other families with a lineage of paranormal stuff like that, and if so do you know why??

1. First they bring up the fact that she tried to strip shirone naked and sell him into slavery. Which is wrong, she only wanted to see his face and mess with him a bit, the thugs misunderstood her.


2. Again some bring the fact that she wanted him expelled. Which is also wrong since she was afraid shirone would spread rumours that she liked hanging out with older men and what not .

3. Again, the whole coffee thing was just a way of ensuring he doesn't say anything about her, since shirone knew Amy was aware of his status as a commoner he accepted it because his identity being revealed would bring a lot of issues to the school and the Ogent family 

4. People also bring the fact that she didn't apologize for what she did . But, the fact is her actions after she got attacked by Jake and his friends till the end of the story shows she was sorry. Even in real life there are people who say or do things that offend or hurt us, they may not say sorry but the way they act towards us after it shows their sorry and we move on.

1m7rfg7,https://youtu.be/HJWY5dh6rrM,4 Very Scary TRUE Off-Grid Water Horror Stories,"# ""Dead Water"":

No neighbors, no noise, just the wind rustling through the trees and the occasional chirp of a bird. I built my cabin here, deep in the forest, years ago. It‚Äôs off-grid, just the way I like it‚Äîno electricity, no city water, nothing tying me to the outside world. My water comes from a natural spring, a short walk from my cabin. It‚Äôs crystal clear, cold, and pure. Every morning, I trek down to the spring with my jugs to collect enough water for the day. It‚Äôs my routine, my ritual, and I‚Äôve always felt at peace there.

But that was before.

It was a Tuesday morning, just like any other. The sun was barely up, casting long shadows through the trees as I made my way down the familiar path. The air was crisp, and the ground was damp from the night‚Äôs dew. I could hear the gentle trickle of the spring before I saw it, a sound that usually brought me comfort. But that day, something felt off. The birds were silent, and the usual hum of the forest was gone. It was like the woods were holding their breath.

As I stepped into the small clearing around the spring, I froze. Floating face down in the water was a body. A woman, from the looks of it, her long hair spreading out like dark seaweed in the current. My heart stopped. I dropped my jugs, the sound of them hitting the ground loud in the stillness. I wanted to run, to scream, but there was no one to hear me. I was alone, miles from anyone who could help.

I stood there, staring, trying to make sense of what I was seeing. The water around her was tinged with red, and her clothes were torn and muddy. She looked like she‚Äôd been there for a while, but not long enough for the spring to wash her away completely. My mind raced. Who was she? How did she get here? This was my spring, my water source. No one else came here. No one even knew about it except me.

I backed away slowly, my breath coming in short, sharp gasps. I couldn‚Äôt leave her there‚Äîshe‚Äôd contaminate the water, and I needed that water to survive. But I couldn‚Äôt touch her either. I wasn‚Äôt a doctor or a detective; I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I ran back to my cabin, slamming the door behind me, and locked it, though I knew it wouldn‚Äôt keep out whatever had brought her here.

I sat on the edge of my bed, trying to calm down. My hands were shaking, and I could feel a cold sweat breaking out on my forehead. I had to think. I couldn‚Äôt call the police‚Äîthey‚Äôd never come out here, not for miles. And even if they did, they‚Äôd ask questions I didn‚Äôt want to answer. Questions about why I was living out here alone, why I didn‚Äôt have a phone or any way to contact the outside world. I‚Äôd built this life to escape all that, and I wasn‚Äôt about to let it slip away.

But I couldn‚Äôt just leave her there. The thought of drinking water from the same spring where she lay dead made my stomach turn. I had to move her, at least far enough away from the spring so the water wouldn‚Äôt be tainted. I grabbed a shovel and a pair of gloves from my shed, steeling myself for what I had to do.

When I got back to the spring, she was still there, motionless. The water had shifted her slightly, and her face was now partially visible. She was young, maybe in her thirties, with pale skin and dark hair. Her eyes were closed, and there was a small cut on her forehead, still oozing blood. I didn‚Äôt want to look too closely, but I couldn‚Äôt help noticing her hands. They were clenched into fists, as if she‚Äôd been fighting for her life.

I used the shovel to gently push her body to the side, away from the spring. As I did, I saw something glint in the sunlight. It was a necklace, half-buried in the mud near where she‚Äôd been floating. I hesitated, then reached down and picked it up. It was a simple silver chain with a small pendant‚Äîa tiny bird, its wings spread wide. On the back, there was an engraving:¬†*For my love, always.*¬†It felt wrong to take it, but I couldn‚Äôt leave it there either. It might be important, a clue to who she was.

I buried her near the spring, under a pile of rocks. It wasn‚Äôt a proper grave, but it was the best I could do. I marked the spot with a larger stone, just in case someone came looking for her. Then I filled my jugs with water from the spring, trying not to think about what had just happened. I needed to act normal, to pretend everything was fine. But as I walked back to my cabin, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that I was being watched.

That night, I couldn‚Äôt sleep. Every creak of the cabin, every rustle of the wind outside, made me jump. I kept thinking about her‚Äîthe woman in the spring. Who was she? How had she ended up there? And why did she have to die in my water source, of all places? I felt guilty, like I‚Äôd somehow failed her by not being there to help. But that didn‚Äôt make sense. I didn‚Äôt even know her.

The next morning, I went back to the spring to check on the grave. The rocks were undisturbed, but as I filled my jugs, I noticed something strange. There were footprints in the mud‚Äîfresh ones, not mine. They were larger than my boots, and they led from the spring into the woods. Someone had been here, and recently.

My heart raced as I followed the prints. They led me about fifty yards into the forest, where they stopped abruptly at a small clearing. There, scratched into the bark of a tree, was a single word:¬†*Help.*¬†My blood ran cold. Had she written that before she died? Or had someone else been here, looking for her?

I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I couldn‚Äôt stay here, not with that grave so close to my water source. But I couldn‚Äôt leave either‚Äîthis was my home, my sanctuary. I decided to stay put, but I started carrying my rifle with me everywhere, just in case.

Days turned into weeks, and nothing else happened. The footprints faded, and the grave remained undisturbed. I started to think maybe I‚Äôd imagined it all‚Äîthe footprints, the word on the tree. Maybe the stress of finding her had gotten to me. But then, one night, I heard it.

A knock on my door.

I froze. No one ever came to my cabin. No one even knew where it was. I grabbed my rifle and crept to the door, peering through the small window. There was a man standing outside, his face obscured by the darkness. He was tall, broad-shouldered, and dressed in dark clothes. He knocked again, louder this time.

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs there?‚Äù I called out, my voice shaking.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking for my wife,‚Äù he said, his voice low and gravelly. ‚ÄúShe disappeared a few weeks ago. I think she might have come this way.‚Äù

I felt a chill run down my spine. His wife? Was this the woman I‚Äôd found in the spring? I didn‚Äôt want to open the door, but I couldn‚Äôt just leave him standing there either. I unlocked it and cracked it open, keeping the rifle close.

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen anyone,‚Äù I said, trying to sound calm. ‚ÄúI live alone here.‚Äù

He stepped closer, and I could see his face now. He was older, maybe in his fifties, with deep lines etched into his skin and eyes that looked like they hadn‚Äôt slept in days. ‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù he said, his voice breaking. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been searching for weeks. Her car was found abandoned on the highway, not far from here. I think she might have wandered into the woods.‚Äù

I hesitated. Should I tell him about the body? But what if he was involved? What if he‚Äôd killed her and was now trying to cover his tracks? I couldn‚Äôt trust him.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen anyone. You should check with the police.‚Äù

He stared at me for a long moment, his eyes narrowing. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lying,‚Äù he said finally. ‚ÄúI can see it in your face. You know something.‚Äù

I slammed the door shut and locked it, my heart pounding. I heard him pounding on the door, shouting, but I didn‚Äôt open it. After a while, he stopped, and I heard his footsteps fading into the distance.

I didn‚Äôt sleep that night. Or the next. Every sound outside made me jump, every shadow seemed to move. I knew I couldn‚Äôt stay here anymore. The next morning, I packed up my things and left, driving away from the cabin and the spring, from the woman in the grave and the man who came looking for her.

I never went back. I sold the cabin to a developer who turned it into a vacation rental. I heard later that they found the grave when they were clearing the land. The woman was identified as a missing hiker, and her husband was arrested for her murder. He‚Äôd killed her in a fit of rage during an argument, then dumped her body in the woods. He must have thought no one would ever find her.

But I did. And sometimes, late at night, when I‚Äôm alone, I still see her face in my dreams, floating in the spring, her eyes closed, her hands clenched into fists. And I wonder if she‚Äôs really at peace, or if she‚Äôs still waiting for someone to find her, to tell her story.





# ""The Reservoir"":

I‚Äôve been diving for over ten years, swimming through murky rivers, inspecting dam walls, and cleaning out industrial tanks. But nothing prepared me for what happened in that underground reservoir. It was supposed to be a routine job, just another day in the water. By the time I climbed out, I was shaking, and I swore I‚Äôd never go back.

It started at the water treatment plant, a sprawling complex of pipes and concrete on the edge of town. I pulled up early in the morning, my gear rattling in the back of my truck. The maintenance worker, a guy named Jack with a weathered face and a quick smile, was waiting for me by the entrance.

‚ÄúMorning,‚Äù he said, handing me a clipboard with the day‚Äôs paperwork. ‚ÄúYou ready to dive into the beast?‚Äù

I grinned, signing the forms. ‚ÄúAlways. What‚Äôs the deal with this one?‚Äù

Jack led me to a heavy metal hatch set into the ground. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a big one‚Äî40 by 80 meters, about 10 meters deep. Holds half the city‚Äôs water supply. Your job‚Äôs to clean it out. Scrape off any algae, check for debris, and make sure there‚Äôs no damage to the walls. Standard stuff.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds straightforward,‚Äù I said, pulling on my drysuit.

Jack hesitated, then added, ‚ÄúOne thing, though. Some of the guys have mentioned weird noises down there lately. Like banging or something. Probably just the pipes settling, but it spooks them.‚Äù

I raised an eyebrow, adjusting my mask. ‚ÄúBanging? Like what?‚Äù

He shrugged, scratching the back of his neck. ‚ÄúDunno. Loud, like metal on metal. They say it echoes through the whole place. But it‚Äôs an old system‚Äîmakes all kinds of noises. Nothing to worry about.‚Äù

I nodded, brushing it off. Old structures always creak and groan. I‚Äôd heard stories like that before‚Äîworkers spooked by their own imaginations. I checked my gear one last time: oxygen tank, regulator, torch on my helmet, backup light on my wrist. Everything was in order. Jack opened the hatch, and I lowered myself into the water.

The reservoir was cold, the kind of cold that seeps into your bones. My torch cut through the darkness, revealing smooth concrete walls covered in a thin layer of slime. Small fish darted away from the light, their scales glinting like tiny mirrors. The place felt ancient, like a forgotten tomb, even though it was man-made. The only sounds were my breathing through the regulator and the occasional drip from the ceiling high above.

I started working, moving methodically along the walls, scraping off algae with a small tool. The reservoir was vast, stretching out into the shadows beyond my torch‚Äôs beam. It was quiet‚Äîtoo quiet, maybe. Then I heard it: a loud bang, sharp and metallic, like someone slamming a hammer against a pipe. It echoed through the water, vibrating in my chest.

I froze, my heart skipping a beat. What was that? I listened, but the silence returned, heavy and oppressive. Maybe it was just the pipes, like Jack said. I shook my head and went back to work.

Then it came again, louder, closer. My pulse quickened. There was no one else down here, no machinery running. What could be making that noise? I swam toward the sound, my torch sweeping the walls. Nothing. Just concrete and water.

I turned back to my task, but the banging started again, more insistent now, like a drumbeat. It felt wrong, like the reservoir was alive and angry. My unease grew, a knot tightening in my stomach. I told myself it was nothing, just the system settling, but the sound was too deliberate, too rhythmic.

Then my torch flickered. ‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù I muttered, tapping it with my glove. It steadied for a moment, then went out completely. Darkness swallowed me. I was blind, surrounded by cold water and concrete walls. I tried to turn the torch back on, but it was dead. How? I‚Äôd checked the batteries before the dive‚Äîthey were brand new.

I reached for my backup light, strapped to my wrist. I flicked the switch. Nothing. Both lights were out. That wasn‚Äôt possible. My heart pounded, and I could feel the panic rising. I was alone in a pitch-black underwater cavern, with no way to see where I was going.

The banging continued, now coming from all directions, like the reservoir was closing in on me. It was disorienting, making it hard to think. I took deep breaths, trying to stay calm. I knew the layout; I just needed to find the exit. But without light, everything was a blur.

Then I felt it‚Äîa current, gentle at first, like a whisper against my skin. It grew stronger, tugging at me, pulling me deeper into the reservoir. My mind raced. Was there a leak? Was the system draining? If I didn‚Äôt get out soon, I could be swept into some unknown part of the structure‚Äîor worse.

I swam against the current, but it was relentless. I bumped into a wall, then another, losing all sense of direction. The banging grew louder, more frantic, as if whatever was causing it was getting closer. My oxygen was running low; I could feel the tank getting lighter. I had to get out.

In my panic, I remembered the safety line attached to my harness, leading back to the hatch. I‚Äôd forgotten about it in my fear. I grabbed it, my gloved hands shaking, and started pulling myself along, hand over hand. The current fought me, but I kept going, following the line toward what I hoped was the surface.

The banging stopped abruptly, replaced by an eerie silence that was somehow worse. My breathing was loud in my ears, the only sound in the darkness. Finally, I saw a faint glow above me‚Äîthe hatch. I kicked hard and broke through the surface, gasping for air.

Jack was there, his face pale as he helped me out. ‚ÄúWhat happened down there?‚Äù he asked, his voice sharp with worry. ‚ÄúYou look like you‚Äôve seen a ghost.‚Äù

I sat on the edge of the hatch, still shaking. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù I said, my voice unsteady. ‚ÄúThere was this banging‚Äîloud, like metal. Then my lights went out. Both of them. And there was a current, pulling me deeper.‚Äù

Jack frowned, his brow furrowing. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs weird. Let me check the seismic records.‚Äù

He disappeared for a few minutes, then came back with a clipboard. ‚ÄúThere was a small earthquake earlier today‚Äîa minor tremor, nothing big. That could‚Äôve caused the banging. As for your lights‚Ä¶ maybe the vibration messed with the batteries.‚Äù

I nodded, but I wasn‚Äôt convinced. ‚ÄúAnd the current? There shouldn‚Äôt be a current in a closed reservoir.‚Äù

He shrugged, looking uneasy. ‚ÄúCould be a pressure shift from the quake. These systems are sensitive.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt say anything. It made sense, logically, but it didn‚Äôt feel right. As I packed up my gear, Jack said something that made my blood run cold.

‚ÄúYou know, they say this reservoir was built over an old mine shaft. Some of the workers talk about hearing voices or seeing shadows down there. Probably just stories, though.‚Äù

I looked at him sharply. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt think to mention that before I went in?‚Äù

He chuckled nervously. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt want to spook you. It‚Äôs probably nothing.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt respond. I just wanted to get out of there. As I drove away, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that there was more to it than a tremor and faulty batteries. The darkness, the banging, the current‚Äîit all felt too deliberate, too alive.

I‚Äôve never gone back to that reservoir. I still dive, but I always carry extra batteries now, and I never work alone.¬†





# ""Upper Arrow"":

Laura told me about her annual trip to Upper Arrow Lake. Her eyes lit up as she described the crystal-clear water, the towering mountains, and the quiet that made you feel like you were the only person in the world. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs our special place,‚Äù she said, her voice warm with affection for Peter, her husband. Laura was my colleague at Pembina North Community School in Dapp, Alberta, and over the years, we‚Äôd become close friends. She was cautious, especially around water‚Äîshe couldn‚Äôt swim and always wore a life jacket. So when I heard she‚Äôd drowned, it didn‚Äôt make sense. It still doesn‚Äôt.

It was August 18, 2010, and Laura and Peter were on their yearly fishing trip to Upper Arrow Lake, a remote spot in British Columbia‚Äôs Rocky Mountains. They‚Äôd driven their motorhome to Shelter Bay, a quiet area where the lake‚Äôs beauty hid its dangers. The water was deep, cold, and unforgiving, surrounded by dense forests and jagged peaks. They took their small Zodiac boat out that afternoon, just the two of them, like always. Laura was reading a book, and Peter was fishing, the boat bobbing gently on the lake‚Äôs surface.

Around 4 p.m., Laura called out, ‚ÄúPeter, it‚Äôs getting hot. Can we move to the shade?‚Äù I can imagine her voice, soft but firm, the way she always spoke when she wanted something done. Peter nodded, starting the motor and steering toward a cluster of trees near the shore. That‚Äôs when it happened. The boat hit a wave, and Laura, standing to get a better view, lost her balance. She fell into the water with a sharp cry, the sound swallowed by the lake‚Äôs vast silence.

Peter later told me he dove in after her, but the water was too buoyant, and he couldn‚Äôt reach her. He swam to shore, grabbed a rock to weigh himself down, and tried again, but by the time he pulled her up, she was gone. Her face was pale, her eyes closed, her body still. He raced to shore, called for help, and tried CPR, but nothing worked. The police arrived around 8 p.m., and despite their efforts, Laura was pronounced dead. The autopsy said drowning, with no signs of struggle. Just an accident, they said.

I was at home when Peter called me that night. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs gone,‚Äù he said, his voice flat, almost mechanical. ‚ÄúShe fell in, and I couldn‚Äôt save her.‚Äù I sat there, phone pressed to my ear, trying to process it. Laura, gone? The woman who double-checked her life jacket every time she went near water? It didn‚Äôt add up. ‚ÄúWhat happened, Peter?‚Äù I asked, my voice shaking. ‚ÄúShe just fell,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt was so fast.‚Äù He sounded distant, like he was reading from a script. I wanted to believe him, but something felt wrong.

The days after were a haze of grief. At Laura‚Äôs memorial, friends whispered about the life jacket. ‚ÄúShe always wore one,‚Äù said Mary, another teacher. ‚ÄúAlways.‚Äù I nodded, my stomach twisting. Peter was there, quiet, handling the arrangements with an efficiency that felt cold. He didn‚Äôt cry, not that I saw. I kept thinking about the lake‚Äîits isolation, its depth. If something happened out there, who would know?

A year later, everything changed. I was at school when I got a call from another friend. ‚ÄúThey arrested Peter,‚Äù she said, her voice low. ‚ÄúThey think he killed her.‚Äù My heart stopped. Murder? The police believed Peter had pushed Laura into the water, maybe for her insurance money or her pension. They pointed to his behavior after her death‚Äîtoo calm, too quick to move on. And then there was the informant, a man who shared a cell with Peter, who claimed Peter had confessed and even planned to kill witnesses, like Laura‚Äôs parents and the lead investigator. It was chilling, the kind of thing that makes your skin crawl.

The first trial, in Kamloops, was a mess. The jury couldn‚Äôt agree, and it ended in a mistrial. I sat in the courtroom one day, watching Peter. He looked older, his face lined with stress, but he never wavered. ‚ÄúI loved her,‚Äù he told the judge. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd never hurt her.‚Äù His words sounded sincere, but I couldn‚Äôt shake the image of Laura, alone in that cold water, her screams unheard.

The second trial, in Kelowna, was worse. The prosecution painted Peter as a calculating man, desperate for money. They said he knew Laura couldn‚Äôt swim, knew she wasn‚Äôt wearing a life jacket that day. They claimed he saw his chance on that isolated lake, where no one could see or hear. The jury found him guilty of first-degree murder, and he was sentenced to life. But in 2020, the conviction was overturned. The evidence was too thin, the informant‚Äôs story too shaky. By 2021, the charges were stayed, and Peter was free.

I still drive by the school sometimes, thinking of Laura. She loved her students, her books, her quiet life. I picture her on that boat, trusting Peter, unaware of the danger. Did she slip, or was she pushed? The lake knows, but it‚Äôs not telling. Upper Arrow Lake is beautiful, but it‚Äôs a place where secrets sink deep.¬†





# ""Alice and the Lake‚Äôs Secret"":

I worked at the Lake Crescent Tavern, a small wooden building perched on the edge of Lake Crescent, where the water sparkled like glass under the towering Olympic Mountains. The lake was beautiful, but folks around Port Angeles whispered it was cursed. An old Klallam legend said it formed when a mountain spirit smashed a boulder to stop a tribal war, drowning warriors and trapping their souls. They claimed the lake never gave up its dead. I never believed those tales, but they made my skin prickle when I walked home alone at night.

My name‚Äôs Alice, and I was a waitress at the tavern in 1936. That‚Äôs when I met Hallie Latham, a new girl with a quick smile and tired eyes. She was 35, same as me, but life had worn her down. Hallie had moved to Port Angeles after two failed marriages, hoping for a fresh start. She poured drinks, laughed with loggers, and never complained, but I noticed the shadows under her eyes, the way she flinched when someone moved too fast.

‚ÄúHallie, you alright?‚Äù I asked one evening, wiping down the bar. She was stacking glasses, her hands shaking just a bit.

She forced a smile. ‚ÄúJust tired, Alice. Long day.‚Äù

But I saw the bruise on her wrist, peeking out from her sleeve. ‚ÄúThat from Monty?‚Äù I kept my voice low. Monty Illingworth was her new husband, a beer truck driver with a temper. They‚Äôd married in June, just months after meeting.

Hallie‚Äôs eyes darted to the door, like she expected him to barge in. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt mean it,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúHe gets mad sometimes, but he loves me.‚Äù

I wanted to believe her, but I‚Äôd seen men like Monty before. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to stay with him,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou could leave, stay with me for a while.‚Äù

She shook her head. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôd find me. Besides, I can handle it.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt push. I wish I had. Over the next few months, Hallie came to work with more bruises‚Äîon her arms, her neck, once a black eye she tried to hide with powder. She stopped talking about Monty, but I heard stories. He‚Äôd been seen yelling at her outside the tavern, his hands balled into fists. One night, the police broke up a fight between them. Hallie told a coworker he‚Äôd choked her, broke one of her teeth. I begged her to leave, but she‚Äôd just say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be fine, Alice. Don‚Äôt worry.‚Äù

Then, in December 1937, Hallie didn‚Äôt show up for her shift. I waited, thinking she was late, but hours passed. I went to her small house near the lake, but it was dark, the door locked. Monty was there, sitting on the porch, a bottle in his hand.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Hallie?‚Äù I asked, my heart pounding.

He looked at me, his eyes cold. ‚ÄúShe left. Packed her things and took off. Said she was done with me.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt believe him. Hallie wouldn‚Äôt leave without a word, not to me. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôd she go?‚Äù I pressed.

‚ÄúHow should I know?‚Äù he snapped, standing up. He towered over me, and I stepped back. ‚ÄúMind your own business, Alice.‚Äù

I went to the sheriff the next day, told him Hallie was missing, that Monty was lying. But they didn‚Äôt take it seriously. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a grown woman,‚Äù Sheriff Kemp said. ‚ÄúProbably ran off. Happens all the time.‚Äù I wanted to scream, but I had no proof. Days turned to weeks, then years. Hallie was gone, and the town moved on. But I couldn‚Äôt. I kept seeing her face, her scared eyes, every time I looked at the lake.

July 6, 1940, changed everything. I was at the tavern, serving coffee to a couple of regulars, when Louis Rolfe burst in, his face pale as death. ‚ÄúAlice, you gotta come see this,‚Äù he stammered. ‚ÄúWe found something in the lake.‚Äù

I followed him to the shore, where a small crowd had gathered. Louis and his brother had been fishing when they saw something floating near the reeds. At first, they thought it was a bundle of blankets, but as they got closer, they saw it‚Äîa body, wrapped tight in heavy rope, bobbing in the clear water. My stomach twisted. I didn‚Äôt want to look, but I had to know.

The sheriff and coroner arrived, pulling the body to shore. I pushed through the crowd, my heart hammering. The blankets were soaked, the rope knotted like it was meant to sink forever. When they unwrapped it, I gasped. The body was a woman‚Äôs, but her face was gone‚Äîmelted away, they said later, by the lake‚Äôs cold depths. Her skin wasn‚Äôt rotten; it was soft, like putty, like soap you could scoop with a spoon. I‚Äôd never seen anything so horrible. The crowd whispered about the lake‚Äôs curse, how it held onto its dead, but now it had given one up.

‚ÄúWho is it?‚Äù someone asked.

‚ÄúNo idea,‚Äù the coroner said, his voice grim. ‚ÄúFace is too far gone. But look at this.‚Äù He pointed to her mouth, where a glint of gold caught the light‚Äîa dental bridge, six teeth long.

I froze. Hallie had a gold bridge. She‚Äôd shown it to me once, proud of the dental work she‚Äôd saved for. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Hallie,‚Äù I whispered, my voice breaking. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Hallie Illingworth.‚Äù

The sheriff looked at me, skeptical. ‚ÄúYou sure, Alice? She‚Äôs been gone years.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs her bridge. And Monty‚Äîhe did this.‚Äù

They took the body away, and the town buzzed with fear. People locked their doors, whispered about the ‚ÄúLady of the Lake.‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt sleep, picturing Hallie‚Äôs body in that water, preserved like some ghastly statue. I kept thinking of Monty, out there, free. What if he knew I‚Äôd spoken to the sheriff?

Weeks passed, and the investigation dragged. They sent pictures of the dental bridge to dentists across the country. A dentist in South Dakota confirmed it was Hallie‚Äôs. The sheriff started asking about Monty, but he‚Äôd moved away, claiming he was heartbroken over Hallie leaving him. I told them everything‚Äîher bruises, her fear, the night she vanished. ‚ÄúHe killed her,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI know he did.‚Äù

One night, I was closing the tavern alone when I heard footsteps outside. My heart stopped. I grabbed a knife from the counter, my hands shaking. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs there?‚Äù I called.

The door creaked open, and Monty stood there, his eyes glinting in the dim light. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been talking, Alice,‚Äù he said, his voice low. ‚ÄúTelling lies about me.‚Äù

I gripped the knife tighter. ‚ÄúI know what you did to Hallie,‚Äù I said, trying to sound brave. ‚ÄúThe sheriff knows too.‚Äù

He stepped closer, and I backed against the bar. ‚ÄúYou should‚Äôve stayed quiet,‚Äù he growled. ‚ÄúAccidents happen, you know. People fall into the lake.‚Äù

My blood ran cold. I thought of Hallie, tied up, sinking into that dark water. But then I heard voices outside‚Äîloggers coming for a late drink. Monty froze, then turned and slipped into the night. I collapsed, gasping, the knife clattering to the floor.

The next day, I told the sheriff about Monty‚Äôs threat. They tracked him down in Seattle, living under a new name. When they brought him in, he denied everything, but they found rope in his truck, the same kind that bound Hallie. Witnesses came forward, saying they‚Äôd seen him hit her, heard her scream. In 1941, Monty was convicted of murder. They said he‚Äôd strangled her, wrapped her body, and dumped it in the lake, thinking it would never surface.

I still work at the tavern, but I don‚Äôt look at Lake Crescent the same way. Its beauty hides something dark, something that holds onto secrets until it‚Äôs ready to let them go. Sometimes, at night, I think I hear Hallie‚Äôs voice, whispering from the water, warning me to be careful. I‚Äôll never forget her, or the horror of what that lake gave up.",1,1753320876.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

1m7rf2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Contrave/comments/1m7rf2o/one_year_update/,One Year Update,"I started last July so just wanted to share for those of you starting out. Poor man's from hers. Nothing happened until I titrated up to the full dose. Like nothing. I don't know what my starting weight was but I'm guessing 150s easily. Devastating for me, as I'm only 5'3. Perimenopause was when intermittent fasting no longer worked for me. Weight crept on and nothing I did worked. 

Once I got to the full dose, I started to notice clothes getting looser and zero appetite. Like, none. By end of September there was noticeable weight loss. I was in a pair of size 28 Reformation jeans I could not get zipped prior to starting. You know that really stiff denim that has no give? Fit beautifully by then. 

Beginning of this year, people started commenting on weight loss. I got a bit concerned because I was never hungry. Coffee in the morning, and usually late lunch or early dinner + snack at night. Sometimes had to make myself eat. But clothes were super loose at this point. 

Spring comes. I'm in the South, so it gets warm early. I go to put on my old reliable size 10 denim shorts from Gap that were comfortably loose the previous summer and no lie, they FALL to the floor. Talk about a non scale victory lol. Got to go to Old Navy and buy some very cute new size 4s. Because NONE of my summer clothes from last year fit. None. I used to be a size 6. Now a 2 or a 4. 

This is the first summer in years I'm not self conscious in a bathing suit. I feel great. No flab hanging over the side. Just went to a pool party and didn't think about my body the entire time. Just had fun. All my clothes actually fit instead of feeling snug and uncomfortable. I don't have to relentlessly exercise and feel frustrated at no results. I just walk and do normal things like a normal person. 

This was the only thing that worked for me. I feel totally different. Happy. Finally got on a scale and I'm 127. Incredible. The medication did all the work. What people say about food noise is true. It's just absent. It feels great. 

To those of you just starting, this takes time and patience. It will be slow in the beginning. Take a probiotic. I swear by Digestive Advantage (Amazon or Walmart) - no worries about constipation that way and it's insanely great for your immune system. I pretty much never get sick. Just trust the process. 

A year goes quickly. I'm totally different and thrilled with how things worked out after thinking nothing was going to work. Feel free to ask questions. Thanks everyone! This sub was super helpful when I was getting started. 

ETA: The Reformation jeans are now too big as well. Crazy how they literally didn't fit a year ago in one direction and now they don't fit, but in the other direction. ",13,1753320844.0,Contrave,2,1.0,False

I recently was given furniture that I dearly want to keep. It‚Äôs all shoved helterskelter in my living room, which was not laid out well to begin with. Just kind of there. 

The TV was also an unexpected addition as I found a broken 50‚Äù and fixed it and now I have it and it stays on the rolling coffee table, which you can see is currently stacked in front of the bearded dragon cage. We just roll it hither and thither as needed. 

The rat cages (Cookie‚Äôs) do connect but can be done so over distance via tunnels I connect overhead. 

Some points of note: 

the turquoise line is a sliding glass door. I do not care if this is behind coffee TV partially, as it‚Äôs rarely used and can roll as needed during viewing, AND rarely overshadowed by backlighting sun. The opening side is easily accessible when other half is blocked visually.

The mustard line on right is the entry to hallway. On left, open entry to the rest of the house.

The drawn on square in front of hall entry was just a visual reminder for space I wanted to keep open.

1m7rde2,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1m7rde2/hr_from_the_corner_of_her_heart/,[Hr] From the Corner of Her Heart,"Neil slipped into Destiny‚Äôs life like the final jigsaw piece slotting into a puzzle.

They met at a gallery. She was standing alone, studying a painting most people had walked past. With quiet footsteps, he came to stand beside her, the crook of his elbow leaving just enough room for a breath between him and her arm.

‚ÄúWhat does it make you feel?‚Äù he asked, fixing his eyes on the edge of her jawline.

She turned towards him, irritated at first, but feeling her heart begin to gallop as their eyes met. There was electricity there. An electric pulse that disrupted the rhythm in her chest.

‚ÄúLike ‚Äî something‚Äôs trapped inside it,‚Äù she stammered.

He smiled, leaning close to her and whispering in her ear. ‚ÄúMaybe something wants to be.‚Äù

Their first date lasted seven hours. Their second was the next day. Then the next. He remembered everything, seeming to recall every word, every story she told him ‚Äî her childhood dog‚Äôs name, how she liked her coffee, the way she snapped her fingers when she was overstimulated. He filled her inbox with thoughtful notes, left her voicemails that felt like poetry. He showed up at her office with lunch when she forgot to eat, and texted her right before panic attacks hit, as if he could sense them.

‚ÄúI just feel you,‚Äù he said once, brushing her hair back, resting his hands on the sides of her face. ‚ÄúLike, I live inside you, or something.‚Äù

She smiled. It felt fated.

But something crawled inside her chest ‚Äî a creeping sense of unease. Fate can also be a trap.

The footsteps began a month later.

Soft, light ‚Äî almost playful. Like a cat‚Äôs paws whispering in the dark.

She was alone in the kitchen the first time she heard it ‚Äî bare feet against a wooden floor. She turned quickly, trying to pinpoint the source, but there was nothing. So, she brushed it off. She explained it away to herself as the sounds of an old building settling into its bones.

But then they came again. And then again ‚Äî and always when she was alone. They began to sound closer, louder, but nothing was ever there.

She told Neil about it, curled up with him on her couch. ‚ÄúI think my apartment‚Äôs haunted,‚Äù she said, forcing a laugh.

He placed his hand on her head, cradling her into his chest, smoothing her hair. His voice was soft, almost a hiss. ‚ÄúMaybe you‚Äôve just finally let someone in.""

She blinked, pulling away to look at him. She had scrunched her nose upwards, her eyes knit together in confusion. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

He smiled, but there was something almost sinister in the angles of his lips. A heartbeat later, he giggled and kissed her forehead. ‚ÄúNothing. I‚Äôm teasing. It‚Äôs probably just the pipes.‚Äù

Destiny carefully searched Neil‚Äôs face, looking for that flicker of ‚Äî something ‚Äî she had seen. All that was there now was the love, adoration, and care that she had grown accustomed to. Still, somewhere deep in her chest, that cold dread continued to coil.

Weeks passed. He never raised his voice, never got angry. She never saw the sinister smile creep in again, but his presence began to fill every space of her apartment. A second toothbrush, his shoes by the door, a playlist he had created that played in the background of their lives. Each piece of him seemed to displace a small sliver of her.

And with each small change, the footsteps only grew louder. They became faster ‚Äî more insistent. And near impossible to ignore, but something told her to keep it to herself, to lock it away.

Yet, somehow, Neil always managed to know when she was upset.

‚ÄúYou seem distracted,‚Äù he said to her once, tilting his head and staring at her, unblinking. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù

It felt romantic. Almost.

Destiny forced a smile, ‚ÄúEverything‚Äôs brilliant. I‚Äôve just never been so safe, so loved. It‚Äôs taking time to adjust.‚Äù

But soon, she felt herself shrinking, as if her space was slowly being redecorated without her consent, and she was fading into the walls. Her voice sounded quieter, her emotional responses delayed, as if she had to wait for him to feel them first. She felt like a marionette whose strings were slowly being rewired.

And the footsteps‚Ä¶ they filled what spaces she had left. They were no longer just in the room. They were somehow inside her.

At first, she tried convincing herself it was simply anxiety, just a phantom rhythm under her sternum. But she felt it again, and again, and then again ‚Äî each step vibrating through her chest cavity like a drumbeat.

She pressed her hand to her ribs, holding her breath.

Nothing. Silence.

Then‚Äî

Step.

A hollow thud beneath her skin. Stronger than a heartbeat.

Her breaking point came on a street corner, ironically just outside the gallery where she had first met Neil.

She was speaking with a friend she hadn‚Äôt seen in months, laughing at a dumb joke he had just told her, when suddenly, her vision blurred. She felt like a hand had reached through her chest and was squeezing her heart.

BOOM. BOOM. BOOM.

The footsteps. Louder than they had ever been.

There was an excruciating pounding now. Not a whisper. Screaming.

She collapsed to the ground, gasping for air that she could not get. Her chest felt bruised, like someone in heavy boots was stomping on her lungs.

‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù her friend knelt beside her, pulling his cellphone from his pocket.

She stared up at him, eyes wide and wild, and couldn‚Äôt answer.

Because she now knew, with terrifying clarity:

Someone was pacing. Inside. Her. Heart.

A small crowd gathered. Her friend called an ambulance, holding her hand as they waited for it to arrive.

At the hospital, they found nothing. No strange throbbing in her chest. Her vitals were all normal. They told her it was likely just a panic attack, but she knew better. She had felt someone there, living in a place they were never invited to.

That night, she lay quietly in bed, her knees tucked into her chest, shivering. Neil pulled close to her, rubbing her back, cooing softly.

‚ÄúI think something‚Äôs wrong,‚Äù she whispered, a sadness in her voice she had not expected. ‚ÄúI hear‚Ä¶ I feel things. It‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ like someone‚Äôs inside me. Walking.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt pull back. Didn‚Äôt laugh.

He kissed the back of her neck and said, ‚ÄúMaybe you‚Äôre just overwhelmed. You‚Äôve been so open lately.‚Äù

She rolled over suddenly, staring at him and unable to hide her fear. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt let anything in.‚Äù

He smiled, slow and sad, and she caught a brief glimpse of the sinister edges around the corners of his mouth.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt always notice when doors are open, sweetness. Sometimes they‚Äôre already open, and you don‚Äôt realize it isn‚Äôt safe.‚Äù

He kissed her cheek. ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre okay now. You‚Äôre not alone anymore.‚Äù

She wanted to scream. To run. She could feel a growing alarm pressing against the back of her eyes.

But something inside her growled, ‚ÄúStay.‚Äù And she began to feel the urgency to flee wane.

Slowly, he pulled her into his arms, his embrace just ever too tight, his breath on the nape of her neck eerily matching the footsteps in her heart.

She moved away two days later to a city on the far side of the country. She had packed her bag, slowly at first, but then with a blinding fury that made her think the building was on fire and she was about to be engulfed. Before her plane even took off, she blocked his number and deleted all her social media accounts.

But the footsteps never stopped. Even now, in a new apartment with bare walls and three locks.

She doesn‚Äôt date, doesn‚Äôt try to make new friends. She doesn‚Äôt even own a phone. But every night, that same familiar rhythm:

Step. Step. Pause.

She presses her hand to her chest and feels it, not a heartbeat, but a patrol ‚Äî still searching for his Destiny. Pacing through rooms he was never meant to own. And sometimes, when she sobs into her pillow, she swears she feels him stop to listen.

Recently, he‚Äôs begun to hum. She hears his tune coming from her lips.

She tells herself she‚Äôll find a way to force him out.

But in her quietest moments, she still wonders:

What if she‚Äôs just a hallway now?

What if he doesn‚Äôt live in her?

What if she lives in him?

Still, some part of her holds onto hope. Maybe it will fade. Perhaps it is just an echo of him she‚Äôd forgotten to leave behind.

Then, one afternoon, the sky an angry smear of gray, she stops by a neighborhood caf√© ‚Äî one of those quiet places with chalkboard menus and shiny vinyl booths. The girl ahead of her in line begins to hum, low and melodic, freezing Destiny in place.

The tune ‚Äî the same one she‚Äôd begun hearing from her own mouth ‚Äî dripping from this girl's lips like it had always belonged there.

The girl turns, smiling. Warm. Unaware.

‚ÄúOh, sorry,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt mean to sing out loud. My boyfriend‚Äôs got it stuck in my head.‚Äù

Destiny feels her throat begin to tighten.

‚ÄúHe moved here a few weeks ago,‚Äù the girl continues, beaming. ‚ÄúSaid he just knew he had to come. That he‚Äôd finally found his destiny.‚Äù She giggles. ‚ÄúCorny, right? But romantic.‚Äù

Destiny feels the world tilt, her heart stuttering. Not in panic ‚Äî but in rhythm.

Step.

Step.

Pause.

The girl leans in, playful now. ‚ÄúHe said something kind of sweet last night, actually. That he knows every corner of my heart. Well, he said his destiny‚Äôs heart, but he had to mean me, right?‚Äù

She giggles again. ‚ÄúSwoon.‚Äù

Destiny steps back. Her purse sliding from her shoulder, nearly causing her to trip.

People turn. The girl finally notices something is off and steps towards Destiny, now concerned. ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù

But she isn‚Äôt listening. She is already turning and walking away, fast, then faster, until she is running. Her lungs burn. Her ribs ache.

Inside her chest, the footsteps aren‚Äôt just pacing.

They are sprinting.

And she knows ‚Äî they have found her.

A dedicated suede cleaning kit offers a complete solution, providing the tools and cleaning agents necessary to remove dirt, stains, and restore the material's soft texture. Investing in a quality suede cleaning kit is essential for anyone looking to preserve the longevity and aesthetic appeal of their suede belongings, saving money on professional cleaning services and preventing irreversible damage from inappropriate cleaning methods.

A proper suede brush allows for gentle agitation without causing scratches or damage to the delicate surface.

**Suede Eraser:** This eraser mimics a standard pencil eraser but is constructed from a material that gently lifts stains and scuff marks from the suede.

The eraser should be firm enough to provide effective stain removal yet gentle enough to prevent damage to the suede fibers. It operates with micro-abrasive action, carefully lifting away blemishes without altering the color or texture of the suede. A high-quality eraser will leave no residue or discoloration behind.

**suede Protector Spray:** This spray forms a protective barrier on the suede, repelling water, dirt, and stains.

The suede protector spray should be a breathable formula that does not alter the color or texture of the suede. It creates an invisible shield that prevents liquids from penetrating the fibers, making it easier to wipe away spills before they stain. A good protector spray should be long-lasting and easy to apply evenly.

**Crepe Brush:** A crepe brush with rows of textured rubber is highly useful for restoring the nap and dealing with stubborn dirt.

Composed of natural crepe rubber, the textured ridges of the crepe brush effectively agitate the suede fibers, loosening embedded dirt and grime. It restores the natural lift and texture of the suede material without causing undue wear or damage. these are particularly effective on heavily soiled or matted suede.## Core Benefits

[[Explore Top Rated grasscloth coffee table on Amazon.]](https://site.trendsupplier.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=grasscloth coffee table)

## Key Features Analysis

The selection of a grasscloth coffee table frequently enough hinges on several key features that determine its longevity, functionality, and aesthetic appeal. Understanding these specifications is crucial for making the right choice.

**Material and construction:** The foundation of any quality grasscloth coffee table lies in its construction materials and craftsmanship.

The grasscloth itself should be tightly woven and securely adhered to a sturdy frame, typically made of solid wood or engineered wood like MDF. Look for tables that specify the type of grass used, as different varieties offer varying levels of durability and texture. Quality construction minimizes the risk of tears, fraying, or detachment of the grasscloth over time. The frame's construction involves strong joinery methods that withstand regular use and prevent wobbling or instability.

**Dimensions and Shape:** The size and shape of the coffee table should complement the dimensions of your living room and the layout of your seating arrangement.

Consider the available space and the number of people who typically use the area. Common shapes include rectangular, square, round, and oval. Rectangular tables are well-suited for larger sofas and provide ample surface area for placing items. square tables work well in smaller spaces or when paired with sectional sofas.Round and oval tables offer a softer aesthetic and are ideal for creating a more intimate seating arrangement, but consider the placement in tighter corners or narrow rooms. Dimensions should allow for comfortable legroom and easy circulation around the table.

**Finish and Color:** The finish and color of the grasscloth play a significant role in the table's overall aesthetic appeal and its ability to blend seamlessly with your existing decor.

Natural grasscloth typically comes in earthy tones like beige, cream, and light brown.However,many manufacturers offer dyed or stained options in various colors to match different interior styles. The finish can range from a matte, natural look to a more polished, lacquered surface. Consider how the color and finish will coordinate with your existing furniture, flooring, and wall colors.A well-chosen finish enhances the table's durability and protects the grasscloth from stains and spills.

**Storage Options:** Some grasscloth coffee tables include built-in storage options, such as drawers, shelves, or compartments, to help you keep your living room organized and clutter-free.

These storage features can be incredibly useful for stowing away remote controls, magazines, books, or other frequently used items. Drawers should have smooth gliding mechanisms and sturdy construction. Shelves offer open storage for displaying decorative objects or storing books within easy reach. lift-top coffee tables provide hidden storage space beneath the tabletop, ideal for storing blankets or pillows. Consider your storage needs and choose a table that offers the right combination of functionality and aesthetics.

**Leg Design and Height:** The design and height of the table legs significantly affect its stability and visual appeal.

Leg designs can range from simple, straight legs to more ornate, tapered legs or hairpin legs. The height of the table should be comfortable and proportional to the height of your sofa. A coffee table that is too high can be awkward to use, while one that is too low may not provide sufficient surface area. Ensure that the legs are securely attached to the frame and made of durable materials to prevent wobbling or breakage.

Key features include:

* Durable grasscloth material
* Solid wood frame construction
* Appropriate dimensions for the living room space
* Drawers and shelving built-in
* Sturdy leg design

I am not part of a union for my trade, but nonetheless, I have worked alongside them many times and I have always had a deep respect for them, and the Union. It just ain't my style and that's okay.

Somebody very close to me works for Republic, however their home facility is not unionized unlike many other Republics who are. So, because of the strike, many Republic merit folk have been going on SOS and traveling to cover these people for the time being. These picket lines, specifically teamsters 25, Unfuckingbelievable. It's so bad that the SOS temps have to be shuttled in and out of facilities. These picketers are screaming heinous, dehumanizing things. Threatening physical violence, hell, somebody the other day had a hot coffee thrown at them. They're acting like complete animals. These are grown adults in society. And here they are bringing their YOUNG CHILDREN to these protests so that they can hear mommy and daddy yell, ""your mother should've aborted you"" to a complete stranger going to work to put food on the table. Pounding on car windows telling people they're going to follow them home and beat them up. 

It's a fucking embarrassment. It's a disgrace to the foundation of why people started unions in the first place. This isn't just about better treatment for the union, apparently it's also about demonizing and threatening other working class people too. I've seen bad pickets, I've seen plenty of people embarrass themselves like that. When will it end? Why has it gotten this far and this evil? Absolutely vile. Alright, this soap box is hurting my ass now. Thanks for reading if you got this far :D

How's it working for you?""","I recently gave the Liven app a shot after seeing a lot of buzz around it. The concept seemed interesting, offering rewards in the form of Liven Coins for every purchase you make at participating restaurants, cafes, and even retail stores. It caught my attention because, who doesn‚Äôt like earning something while spending money?

The first time I used it, I wasn‚Äôt sure how it would turn out. I picked a local cafe that was partnered with Liven and ordered a coffee. The process was pretty straightforward. I ordered, scanned the QR code, and waited for the app to track my purchase. To my surprise, I got 10% of my purchase back in Liven Coins almost immediately after payment. That felt pretty cool!

What I like so far is the app‚Äôs simplicity. You don‚Äôt need to juggle multiple accounts or complicated steps. Just make the purchase and get rewarded. I‚Äôve noticed more cafes and restaurants joining the platform, which is definitely a plus. However, my only gripe so far is that you need to build up quite a bit of Liven Coins before you can redeem them for anything decent. But hey, it‚Äôs still better than getting nothing, right?

1m7r7vo,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m7r7vo/hole_in_the_sky/,Hole In The Sky,"I have been working as an astrophysicist for years, today was the first time something interesting has happened. The day began like any other day, I woke up, drove up to the lab, and brewed myself a cup of coffee. I took my drink and carried myself through the hall and to the second last door where I would be working on my current project, but there was no one there, where there would usually be machines whirring, fluids bubbling, and just people talking in general. Was replaced by an almost uncanny silence. Most notable was the absence of Lance. Lance was one of my best friends from university, and always stayed late and came half an hour early, he was strange like that. I put down my cup and sat down until I heard yelling down the hall. I ran over and stumbled in to see everyone. They were standing or sitting around the table talking. ‚ÄúWhat the hell is going on?‚Äù I asked them. Patel spoke up. He was a small scrawny man, with glasses and messy hair. He was unconfident, stuttering¬† and then spat it out in his scared little quiet voice. ‚ÄúThere's a hole in the sky.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat the fuck? What do you mean there's a hole in the sky?‚Äù I tried to yell, but the pure absurdity of the situation kept my voice down. ‚ÄúLast night Lance was looking through the telescope trying to study Callisto, and he saw it right by jupiter, a fucking hole in the sky!‚Äù I scanned the room but couldn't see Lance anywhere.¬† ‚ÄúWhere is he now? Did he tell you this?‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, we found this on a notepad he wrote, next to his body. He shot himself last night.‚Äù I tried to scream, I tried to say something, but before I realized what was happening I fell to my knees and I felt tears streaming down the sides of my face. Next thing I could remember it was the next week. I must have got through the week, I ate and I slept, but it is a complete lapse in my memory. After that I started going back to work. It was quiet there, no one wanted to talk after what happened, but it was hard to ignore. All work there had focused on the hole in the sky. This place has become so surreal and confusing. At least I still had the shitty coffee in the break room to take solace in.¬†



As I walked I was greeted by my coworkers. ‚ÄúHi Neil‚Äù ‚ÄúHi John‚Äù ‚ÄúHello Neil‚Äù ‚ÄúHi Patel.‚Äù I went over to the machine and tried to pour myself some coffee, it was out but at this point I didn't even care anymore. As I sat down, no drink in hand, I couldn't help but overhear my colleagues' conversation. ‚ÄúWhat do you think of all this?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat is there to think about, why would you think about it? God knows I try not to.‚Äù ‚ÄúI think it's god punishing us.‚Äù ‚ÄúOk.‚Äù I couldn't sit back and listen anymore. I had to interject and ask questions. ‚ÄúWhat does it look like?‚Äù I stammered, they were surprised to hear me, Patel even spilled his coffee a bit. ‚ÄúNo ones seen it since Lance, of course.‚Äù John answered.‚ÄùWhy not?‚Äù ‚ÄúHe killed himself.‚Äù ‚ÄúWell we‚Äôll need to look eventually and what are we going to do for-‚Äù Patel cut me off. ‚ÄúUm, we're trying to get some uh less privileged people to test this out.‚Äù I understood, they were going to get homeless people to look at the hole. ‚ÄúWell, more power to you if that's how you're going to do it.‚Äù¬†



Today the first homeless person came in. His name was David, he‚Äôs been on the streets for a while and wrapped up in a lot of bad shit, a perfect target for the likely possibility that this goes wrong. He looked through it. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck is in this tellerscope?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat the fuck, holy shit what the fuck is that whats in the fucking-‚Äù he paused for a moment ‚ÄúThis is the most beautiful thing I‚Äôve ever seen, Its so beatiful, you have to look!‚Äù We looked at each other uneasily, then he got violent. ‚ÄúLook, you have to fucking look!‚Äù He came at Patel ‚ÄúFucking look!‚Äù three other men restrained him ‚ÄúIts so beautiful, so fucking beautiful!‚Äù He was dragged out screaming. Patel was visibly shaken by this. I was the first to approach him. ‚ÄúYou okay buddy?‚Äù No response. ‚ÄúHere let's go sit down in the break room.‚Äù I held his shoulder and led him into the break room while the rest of the lab just watched solemnly. I wanted to get mad, I wanted to scream at them for how they dismissed Patel, he was a real human being like the rest of them and he was basically being ignored, but when I saw their expressions I decided to bite my tongue. Everyone in that room went through the same thing, we all saw what happened, I was just the only one numb to it all. We both sat down on the old couch, it was comfortable but still a bare minimum for this lab. I was zoning out hearing the hum of the lights and pipes until Patel broke the silence. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to look at the hole.‚Äù¬†



It‚Äôs been a week since Patel looked at the hole, I thought it would be a bigger thing but it just kind of came and went. After arguing with us for hours he ran up to the telescope, looked at it, simply said ‚ÄúOh‚Äù and then left. We didn't see him for a few days then he came back in. When we questioned him about the hole he just said ‚ÄúIt is a hole, not much more to it‚Äù and wouldn't elaborate. We were at a standstill, one man had looked at the hole and killed himself, one had seemingly gone insane but that may not have been an effect of the hole, and one seemed completely fine. After a long evaluation we decided to cut our losses and start looking. There was no other way to study it, and if anyone was looking it should be us. We started taking shifts looking at it and documenting what we saw. Everyone had a partner, mine was Patel, just my luck.¬†



The first time I looked at the hole gave me an indescribable feeling. I thought it would just look like a strange galaxy or a colourful circle, but it was a full on hole in the sky. It was black, black doesn't even describe it, it's the blackest black ever observed, it's blacker than the middle of the night, it's blacker than an eclipse with no moon, it's blacker than a night sky, without a single illuminating star. It was noticeably darker than the rest of the sky, and noticeably indented into the sky with small cracks around it, but nonetheless it was beautiful. When my turn ended I was angry at first, I wanted to keep this beauty to myself, no one else should get this, it should be mine! Then I realized how insane I sounded and ran to the break room. I sat down, and I was greeted by John and Gerald. Gerald immediately started questioning me about the hole. ‚ÄúWhat was it like?‚Äù ‚ÄúDeep‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, what did it look like?‚Äù ‚ÄúLike a hole‚Äù ‚ÄúI know it looked like a hole what did it-‚Äù ‚ÄúJesus would you leave him alone, he just looked through the hole!‚Äù It was John who finally interrupted him. Weeks started going by, blending together and life finally started to feel mundane.¬†



The hole started growing. We noticed it yesterday, it's definitely been growing, slowly but definitely. We have been observing the hole, but not learning about it. The hole still is a mystery. Late into one night we started proposing theories. ‚ÄúI think it's something from another world, looking in, trying to see more, but something much too large to truly experience the beauty this world has to offer‚Äù This was Lisa, she had been working here almost as long as me, she was smart poetic, and i'm not ashamed to say it beautiful, I held onto every last word. ‚ÄúI think its a fucking hole‚Äù It was Gerald ‚ÄúShut up Gerald‚Äù It was John ‚ÄúThis whole thing has just made me more religious, isnt this obviously god the rapture is imminent!‚Äù ‚ÄúSpeaking of religion, what do you make out of all this Patel‚Äù it was Gerald again ‚ÄúGerald I'm an atheist, I think this is a tear in the cosmos just a random possibility of probability that demonstrates the true randomness of the universe.‚Äù The rest of the night followed similarly with people proposing everything from aliens to time travel. The next week the hole grew more, then shrank then became larger than ever.¬†

The hole has gone public. Long story short, Gerald got drunk and told some reporters he met at a bar. To his defence he said she was really hot. We told him he shouldn't come back to the lab and so far he hasn't. It started small, we didn't think anyone would really believe in this hole, maybe a few crackpot conspiracy theorists, but otherwise we would be fine.¬†



We were wrong. As soon as the story hit the news cycle everything started to crack and crumble. Every country's government has made a statement on it, every podcast has something to say about it and no one knows what to do. Some sort of new religion has started up and is already the fourth largest in america. From what I can tell they worship the hole as some sort of deity. I went to the lab today and there were CIA agents everywhere, looks like we won't be the lead researchers in this anymore. I‚Äôm going to call Patel. It‚Äôs been a week since the news went public, there's now a constant video public online of the hole, it's getting bigger and can now be seen in the night sky, tiny but still there. I've been meeting up with some of the guys from work, and it seems like we‚Äôve all been laid off. Real shame, but I don't know how much longer this will matter. It seems like every day they predict the economy will collapse, but it's been fine for now. Also there's a million news reports of people who have gone crazy from the hole. The streets are full of them, many preach about the holes in religion, many are just insane the more I speak on this topic, the more dread gets filled through me as I wonder if I can make it to tomorrow.¬†



I was bored and decided to go to the park today, a bad idea. The parks are just filled with people who aren't inside churches, or other places of worship. These people are driven mad by the hole, and find solace in treating it as though it was a deity, fear is how this religion must grow, fear and anguish. Some of these people seem sane or lucid, but most are just standing there staring ahead barely listening to what the ‚Äúpastor‚Äù was saying. I looked around and jumped when I realized there was a man standing right behind me smiling, silently. ‚ÄúWould you like a flyer?‚Äù He reached out his hand and I noticed it was filled with an absurd amount of flyers advertising his religion. ‚ÄúNo thank you‚Äù ‚ÄúOh you must take one‚Äù ‚ÄúNo I‚Äôm fine‚Äù ‚ÄúYou must‚Äù Then he put his hand on my shoulder firmly, and I ran. I had to maneuver through the never ending labyrinth of the crowd. No matter how far I got I would look back and see the man following me. As I traveled inevitably deeper through this maze more and more people offered me flyers of a religion based on the discoveries of my deceased colleague, a gross cacophony of flesh and grass, the more men I pushed out of the way the more of an open path I left behind me for him to follow. I ran, and then I walked. I don't know for how long, but I do know that when the chase had ended and I was out of the park, it was dark out. I was sweaty and delirious, but I didn't see him anywhere and then I threw up, right outside the park and then I walked home. I stayed in my home for days just eating out of the fridge and sleeping, and watching the ever changing news cycle, although it stays stagnant on a topic now.¬†



This was until I ran out of groceries and knew I needed to go out. I walked out, I felt like the last man alive, there was noone around it was uncanny. I felt like I had to sneak around the town. There were people just sitting outside churches, and the parks were full of thousands of people, there were even people spilling into the streets. I went into the store and it took a while to find anything close to fresh, and then it took me even longer to find an open cash register. I would have just stolen it but then I noticed some teenage girl standing at the counter and felt bad for him. ‚ÄúHey, I'll just get these‚Äù ‚ÄúYou want a bag‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah I guess‚Äù ‚ÄúYou want a flyer‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù A flyer, what would she have a flyer for? Then she handed me the flyer for this religion. I took my food and ran out without leaving. I looked around and there was no one¬† around me right until I turned the corner and saw him. I ran home and almost dropped my food, but got there safe. At nine pm there was a knock at the door. It was him again, I didn't answer, and the knocks got louder, and I went to my room, and the news wouldn't work, and the knocks got louder, and I sat down, and I plugged my ears, and the knocking stopped, and he went away. I tried to sleep but I couldn't so I took some melatonin and eventually fell asleep. The next day I barricaded my door.¬†



Several days later I woke up in the middle of the night to a window breaking. I stayed in my bed and pulled the covers higher. I heard creaking and I knew I couldn't stay put forever. The bed was warm and hard to leave. The bed was safe. I didn't know if I could bear to run into possible danger. Then I decided that if there was an intruder they might not know I was home, and who knows, maybe the glass was from a different house? I spent around a half hour just rationalizing this for myself until I worked up the courage to go downstairs. I snuck around, my own house like I was in some villain's lair, I kept the lights off and made no noise. I patted the carpet, ever so slowly with my feet, I heard a creak, it was from my own feet, and it was the loudest thing I had heard in hours, my sweat went cold, and I froze. I didn't move for ten minutes, ten minutes spent just standing, then I prayed to god, not some hole in the sky, that anyone in this house had not heard me. I stepped, waited then stepped again. This went on for what felt like hours but I‚Äôm not quite sure just how long it took. After what felt like an eternity of feeling the walls and sometimes crawling because I couldn't see a thing, I made it to the kitchen. This had been my goal, my end point, I was here to grab a knife from the kitchen, although it didn't feel like mine anymore. I felt around and I found them, the knives, I felt instantly more confident and I grabbed my largest knife. This was my moment of hubris, the single moment in my life where I was so overconfident it could have led to my downfall.¬†



I yelled. ‚ÄúTry to fucking come at me now!‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah I got a fucking knife!‚Äù Then another smaller ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre fucked.‚Äù Then I saw his silhouette in the hallway, smiling at me ear to ear. He was watching me in the dark, I don't know for how long. He could've been by the kitchen the whole time but from his reaction I could tell he had been following me around my house, just out of sight, but I wasn't out of his. Stalking me, treating me like prey in my own home. For all I know he could have been watching me from my bedroom hall, and he likely was there when I stepped on the creaking step, in the darkness watching me thinking I was safe. I stepped towards him, a feeble intimidation attempt, then he stepped back, away from me. I could notice he still had the flyers in his hand, then he rushed at me. It caught me so off guard I almost fell back, and then I did when he pounced on top of me. He said in the most jarring calm voice based on the situation ‚ÄúHow about taking a flyer?‚Äù I hit my arm on my cabinet and it started bleeding, I felt so helpless in my own home , I wasn't going to die like this I would let it happen. Then the next thing I realized the knife was in his chest, then out, then in again, and again, and again, until his body went limp on top of me. A tear started dripping down my cheek, then again, then again, and then I was crying.



¬†I've killed someone, I can't come back from this, I can't ever. I didn't know what to do so I called nine one one. I didn't know what to expect, but there was no answer. Then I called the next best thing John. Turns out he‚Äôs been staying at his family's old cottage outside of town, he says he can come get me but it will take a few days. I don't feel safe here anymore, but I have nowhere else to go so I just have to stay put in my room. I put a towel over my cut arm, and stayed there. The news still didn't work. I could hear people walking and talking just outside my house but no one came in.



I was beyond relieved when I got the text I‚Äôm outside, hop in. I was so happy to see John's car parked on the curb of my street. We drove up for a couple hours and talked. ‚ÄúHow's this been for you?‚Äù ‚ÄúHorrible those cult members have been following me around, and one attacked me.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the deal with them? I went up to the cottage as soon as we got laid off and this is the first time I've seen them.‚Äù I couldn't believe that he had completely avoided these people while I was subjected to it? It felt bad, it felt unfair. Then I calmed myself down for the rest of the drive.¬†



We got to his cottage, it was a small place in the woods secluded next to a beautiful lake. We stayed and had an honestly good time. We would swim and cook, there was an insane amount of food there. When I asked where he got it he just said he took a lot when he left town, ominous. I had no objections. One night we made a fire and sat by it talking late into the night. ‚ÄúHow do you think the hole started‚Äù ‚ÄúI think it's a mistake, an accident by some higher being, living out there in the cosmos, what do you think?‚Äù ‚ÄúI think it's a black hole, and if it's growing it might not be good for us‚Äù ‚ÄúThat would suck‚Äù ‚ÄúAren't the stars beautiful out here? Ever since I was little I've loved just staring up at it, I guess that's why I became an astrophysicist.‚Äù I looked up, it was beautiful. I could see all the stars, but the hole in sky was fucking huge, as big if not larger as the moon. ‚ÄúThe hole has gotten bigger‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy do you think Lance killed himself when he saw it, he's the only one‚Äù ‚ÄúWell everyone else pretty much has gone insane, have you seen the cult, and I‚Äôm sure there's others.‚Äù This world had become bleak, not a future worth living in. ‚ÄúYou think?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah, I think and if it makes you feel any better you are really brave for not‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat‚Äù? That night at the fire John came on to me. I was taken aback, I‚Äôm not gay, I never have been. I ran back to the cabin and went to my room, making sure not to talk to John anymore, I couldn't believe he would use a vulnerable moment like that to get to me.¬†



I woke up late to someone knocking on the door then breaking in. I got up confused and made my way to the door of my room only to see him. ‚ÄúI thought you fucking dead?‚Äù How he was alive it didn't make sense. ‚ÄúYou sure you wouldn't like a flyer?‚Äù I ran from him, I ran out the door and into the night, he was following me he chased after me into the forest, I ran for hours and even when I was exhausted in the woods leaning on trees. He was still following me. He wasn't slower than me, and he wasn't faster. He would always match my pace. After hours I thought the sun had started to come up, but it was just the hole. It had gotten so large. I fell over. He lept, or pretty much fell onto me. ‚ÄúWould you like a flyer?‚Äù The man's mouth frothing saliva all over my face. I couldn't overpower him and I couldn't get away. I finally exclaimed ‚ÄúFine!‚Äù ‚ÄúIll take a fucking flyer!‚Äù ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù He crawled back on all fours through the woods backwards; it was uncanny. I was going to look at the note but it was night, then I realized it was day and the sun was shining, it was hot, how had I not noticed this? I looked at the flyer but all it read was Kill Yourself! The new age religion, join us! Lance didn't, and you know what happened to him. What? How did the flyer know? Then I woke up.¬†



It was around three am. I couldn't fall back asleep and when six am came I knew what must be done. I needed to go to one of their gatherings and talk to a religious leader, take the flyer, and make that next step. I got up and took John's car. I felt bad but I really needed to get out of there. I'll apologize to John the next time I see him. I drove back to the city, back to the place I never thought I‚Äôd return to. The drive gave me time to think. A place where all of my nightmares come from and all of my friends and family have become distorted versions of themselves, and religion a mockery of the skies, and angels that came before. I‚Äôm not sure what's happening in other cities, states, and countries. Similar things must be happening. It was strange, knowing how important I had felt when this whole thing started. We were the ones that discovered this hole, and we felt like we were the lead researchers, keeping this huge secret from the rest of the world. Now I was as insignificant as anyone, I was a nobody, this wouldn't feel as bad if it didn't feel¬† like I used to be somebody, somebody important well, now where I go I‚Äôm going to get answers, whether the answers are true or answers are what I want will be subjective, but I will have a answer and that's what matters to me now.¬†



I got back into town and pulled into my driveway. Then I started walking to the park. Where there were once huge crowds of people there were buildings, they were like huge old wooden monasteries that must have been built by the crowds, giving them a true place of worship. I went in and was shocked, there were hundreds of more people than there used to be here and they were all packed into this space, just standing there. It didn't look like they had eaten anything, or slept, or moved from that spot in days. I made my way through the crowd. Coming now to the centre of the labyrinth very intentionally sacrificing any self respect I may have had. Once I got to the front I saw someone I never thought I would see again, Patel. ‚ÄúPatel what are you doing here I thought you were an atheist?‚Äù ‚ÄúI've decided I might as well take something up this time, everyone in the city has.‚Äù ‚ÄúWell everyone else here is crazy, are you?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo but I stick with the crowd, it gives me food and shelter.‚Äù ‚ÄúWell can you take me to whoever the leader is here?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat do you need?‚Äù ‚ÄúI need the answers.‚Äù ‚ÄúIll take you to the prophet.‚Äù Patel led me back out through the corn maze with walls of flesh, he knew how to maneuver through it so well. He took me out which took forever, then took me through this park to the only relatively small tent. ‚ÄúI can't go in with you‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù ‚ÄúI have been baptized by the cosmos, he will only talk to those virgin to the stars.‚Äù¬†



I thanked Patel and then made my way into the tent. All there was in there was an old man sitting on a rock in front of a small pond. He was completely bald, wearing a long robe, and blind. ‚ÄúHello‚Äù ‚ÄúHello Neil.‚Äù He knew my name already. ‚ÄúAre you the prophet?‚Äù ‚ÄúSome people call me the prophet, some the oracle, some the moon man, some lesser minded call me a fortune teller, I will happily take on any of these names for our purposes.‚Äù ‚ÄúOk Oracle‚Äù ‚ÄúI have foreseen you coming here, but the future paths split from there, what do you seek from coming here?‚Äù ‚ÄúI seek answers oracle.‚Äù He just fully launched into an explanation. ‚ÄúThe hole opened in the sky, homunculi were not ready for it. The first man to gaze upon this hole could not live with the knowledge it granted, but the knowledge was granted only to him, and now there is no way for him to communicate it, No vessel for the hole. Humans always want answers and the fact the only one who could give it to them couldn't, caused them to find solace in false prophets. Religion is their ultimate form of escapism, they won't allow the questions gone, no matter how they are, no matter what position they place themselves in the will to continue, that's stubbornness, that's the beauty.‚Äù ‚ÄúThank you oracle.‚Äù This explanation didn't help me at all. I still have no clue what's going on. I left the tent and went with Patel. ‚ÄúDid you find the answers you seeked?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, do you want to leave Patel?‚Äù ‚ÄúI would love to‚Äù Patel and I left the strange group of wooden churches and just started walking. We walked for hours, we just kept walking, it was night and we looked up the hole was bigger than ever. The hole has grown so large it has eclipsed the moon. I don't know if there is a moon anymore, I don't know how much of anything is still there.¬†



The abyss eclipsed the moon, the abyss eclipsed the sun. It may have swallowed them, it may have swallowed the entire galaxy. The abyss grew for months, it grew for years, it might have even grown for decades. Humanity changed throughout that time. It didn't develop, it stayed somewhat stagnant. Technology regressed, and people regressed. The abyss didn't care, the abyss kept growing. It eclipsed the stars, it eclipsed the planets, swallowing everything like some, foreign creature from another world. There was no more history, there were no more nations to rise or fall. There was the abyss, and the abyss was all encompassing. As humanity collectively opened its eye to the abyss, it was unable to comprehend it.
