I’m a 27-year-old guy living in Australia , and I’m looking to meet some new female friends. I’ve been here for a while, but I feel like I could really use some more connections, especially since I’d love to explore the city and its surroundings more.

A bit about me: I enjoy outdoor activities, like hiking and biking, and I’m also into movies, music, and trying out new cafes. I’m pretty laid-back and love having good conversations, whether it’s about life, interests, or just sharing a laugh.

If you’re interested in hanging out, grabbing coffee, or exploring new places together, feel free to reach out! Looking forward to meeting some new friends.

 **I was standing in front of the glass conference room, still clutching the stupid cardboard tray of lattes I’d brought for everyone, watching my business partner — my best friend — and my girlfriend screw each other against the projector screen.**

**The startup we’d built from my garage.**  
 **The pitch deck I’d written.**  
 **The woman who said I was “too intense.”**

**And I just stood there.**  
 **Hot coffee soaking my shoes.**  
 **Her laugh cutting through the glass.**

**That was the exact moment I realized:**  
 **I was expendable.**



**Before that morning, I really believed I was building something. Not just a product, not even a company — something bigger. A future I could point to and say,** ***that was me*****.**

**We called it Pulse. The name was Leo’s idea. He said it sounded “alive,” something that could “feel the market’s heartbeat.” I liked it because it felt human, even if what we were building was anything but. An app that claimed to** ***predict emotion*** **— measure it, graph it, sell it. The kind of Silicon Valley promise that feeds off hope and caffeine until both run out.**

**I handled the real work — code, systems, data pipelines, infrastructure — all the things that kept the dream standing. Leo handled the theater. He had a gift for convincing people he cared, even when he didn’t. His smile was expensive and permanent, like something he bought in a backroom deal with God.**

**He called me “the engine.” Said he was “the face.”**  
 **I used to laugh when he said that. I thought we made a good team — the thinker and the talker. I didn’t realize that when people say they’re “the face,” what they mean is** ***you’re replaceable.***

**The office was this old converted warehouse in downtown LA — exposed brick, fake greenery, a neon sign that read** ***FEEL MORE.*** **I slept there most nights. The place smelled like burnt coffee, server heat, and ambition that was starting to rot. I’d crash under my desk for a few hours, wake up with keyboard marks on my cheek, and keep coding.**

**Mia used to show up with Thai takeout, teasing me for being a cliché. She’d sit on the couch, barefoot, scrolling through her phone while I talked to her about algorithms like they were children I was raising. She’d smile, nod, pretend to listen, and then say, “You’re obsessed.” She meant it like a compliment. Or maybe that’s just how I chose to hear it.**

**Back then, I thought obsession was the same as purpose.**

**When we got our seed funding, it felt like winning the lottery. Suddenly we had interns, custom mugs, matching hoodies — all the superficial signs of success. Leo started showing up in tailored suits. He’d clap me on the back and say, “We’re almost there, brother.” Then he’d leave early for “investor dinners.”**

**By month ten, he barely came to the office.**  
 **By month eleven, I was debugging code that no one would ever see, while he was doing photo ops for tech blogs.**  
 **By month twelve, the only thing I recognized anymore was the server uptime graph — flat, steady, reliable. Like me.**

**I noticed small things then, little betrayals disguised as habits. Mia’s perfume lingering longer in his office after she left. Her lipstick smudged on the rim of a coffee mug that wasn’t mine. The way she started defending him in arguments that had nothing to do with her.**

**Still, I didn’t want to see it. I told myself they were just close because we were all building the same dream. I buried it under work — the easiest way to silence suspicion.**

**One night, after a pitch event downtown, I saw Leo leaning in close to a stranger by the bar. The man had the look of money — old money, patient money. I didn’t mean to listen, but Leo wasn’t exactly whispering.**

**“We’re cutting Cross out,” he said. “He doesn’t have the vision. He’s too… mechanical.”**

**I remember that word —** ***mechanical*****. It stuck to me like oil.**  
 **I went home, lay awake under my desk, staring up at the underside of it like it could answer for him.**

**By morning, I’d convinced myself I’d misheard. I even laughed about it, told Mia over takeout that Leo must have been drunk. She smiled too quickly and said, “You’re overthinking it.”**

**That’s the thing about denial — it’s not loud.**  
 **It hums. Soft, steady, like white noise in the background of a collapsing world. You learn to live with it until the silence becomes unbearable.**

**And that silence… it was already growing.**

**The next morning, I came in early. Too early.**  
 **The city was still half-asleep, the sky bruised purple over the skyline, and I was running on a mix of caffeine, paranoia, and blind hope. I’d spent the night debugging a server crash, watching lines of code blur into static. My brain felt like wet cement, heavy and half-dry. But I told myself it was fine. I just needed one good day — the Series A demo, the pitch that would finally prove we’d built something worth bleeding for.**

**I balanced the coffee tray in one hand, four cups, one for each of us. A peace offering, maybe. A ritual. I’d done it every morning for months — because that’s what you do when you still believe in** ***we*****.**

**The office was quiet when I got there. Too quiet. The hum of the servers in the back room, the faint buzz of the fluorescent lights, the smell of cold air and cheap espresso. The kind of silence that feels like someone hit pause on your life.**

**I remember reaching for the door to the glass conference room, the one with the words** ***Pulse HQ*** **etched across it. I didn’t open it. I didn’t have to.**

**Through the glass, I saw it all.**

**Mia’s hand on Leo’s chest.**  
 **His tie looped around her wrist like some kind of trophy.**  
 **And behind them — my face on the projector. Frozen on a company document. My name crossed out in red.**

**For a second, my brain refused to process it. Like my mind couldn’t decide which betrayal to feel first — the personal or the professional.**

**The sound that broke the silence wasn’t a scream or a gasp. It was the soft creak of the cardboard tray in my hands as my grip tightened.**

**They didn’t see me at first. They were too wrapped up in whatever that was — lust, power, the thrill of erasing me. No words, just movement.**

**Something inside me shifted. It wasn’t rage. Not yet. It was quieter, colder. A mechanical click deep inside my skull. Like a switch flipping from** ***hope*** **to** ***no more.***

**The tray slipped. Coffee hit the floor, splattering across the white carpet, hot enough to sting through my shoes. I didn’t even flinch. I just watched the stain spread — dark, fast, permanent.**

**Mia’s head turned first. Her hair fell across her face, eyes widening just slightly, like she’d been caught mid-lie. Then Leo turned, his shirt half-buttoned, his smirk forming too easily.**

**“Ethan, hey—this isn’t—”**

**I didn’t let him finish. I didn’t need to.**  
 **There’s a kind of silence that says everything.**

**I turned and walked out. Slow, deliberate, like leaving the scene of an accident I didn’t cause but somehow deserved.**

**Outside, the sunlight hit me like static. Everything looked too sharp — the cars, the pavement, the street signs. I remember thinking:** ***So this is what it feels like when your life implodes quietly.***

**By noon, my keycard stopped working.**  
 **By one, my email password was invalid.**  
 **By three, my name was gone from the company Slack.**  
 **By six, they posted the press release.**

**“Pulse announces strategic restructuring. Co-founder Ethan Cross transitions out to pursue new opportunities.”**

**I read it on my phone while sitting on the curb outside my apartment. Gas station ramen in one hand, phone in the other. I laughed when I saw the words** ***“new opportunities.”*** **The kind of laugh that doesn’t sound human.**

**Then my banking app pinged — rent payment declined. My last bit of savings had gone to server costs for a company I no longer owned.**

**So I just sat there, chopsticks in hand, watching the sun disappear behind the high-rises. The asphalt radiated heat through my jeans. My reflection shimmered in the puddle beside me — distorted, cracked.**

**Everything I’d built — the code, the name, the dream — stripped from me in less than a day.**

**People talk about losing everything like it happens in slow motion. It doesn’t. It’s instant. One minute you’re holding coffee, planning a pitch deck; the next, you’re a ghost sitting on a curb, eating dinner out of a Styrofoam cup.**

**I didn’t cry. Didn’t rage. Not yet.**  
 **I just sat there, numb, repeating one truth over and over in my head until it lost meaning.**

***It’s gone.***

**My company.**  
 **My girl.**  
 **My identity.**

**All gone.**

**In one day.**

**The first week was survival.**  
 **No plans, no pride — just instincts. I pawned my MacBook, sold the last thing that still smelled like ambition. Slept in my car behind a strip mall in Echo Park. Showered at the gym with strangers who looked like me — people pretending they still had somewhere to be.**

**LA looked different when you had nothing left to lose. Billboards weren’t ads anymore; they were sermons from gods you’d stopped believing in.** ***You can do it.*** ***Dream bigger.*** ***Trust the process.*** **All lies. The only thing I trusted was that hunger and humiliation make a person quiet in a way success never does.**

**I spent my days applying for jobs I didn’t want and nights scrolling through Pulse’s site — my code still running in the background like a ghost I’d built to haunt myself.**

**Then came the stranger.**

**It was around 2 a.m., at a 24-hour diner off Sunset. The kind of place that always smelled like bacon grease and burnt hope. I was hunched over a plate of cold fries, arguing with my landlord on the phone, pretending I still had a plan. When I hung up, the seat next to me creaked.**

**Big guy. Rough beard. Broad shoulders that made his leather jacket look too small. He sat like someone who didn’t ask for permission.**

**“You sound like a man who got robbed,” he said, voice low, unbothered.**

**I didn’t even look up. “You spying or just bored?”**

**He chuckled. “A little of both. Name’s Ronan.”**

**That name hit like a thud — heavy, old-fashioned. He had this military stillness to him, like someone who’d seen things he couldn’t unsee. He didn’t blink much.**

**“I overheard your call,” he said. “Guy who owes rent but sounds too smart to be broke. What happened? Partner screw you over?”**

**I smirked. “You psychic or just good at reading losers?”**

**He grinned — not offended, just amused. “Neither. I’m good at recognizing anger that’s waiting for a target. You want to make things right?”**

**I laughed, tired and hollow. “Unless you’ve got a time machine or a million dollars, I’m good.”**

**He leaned back, studying me. “I’ve got something better. Information.”**

**That made me look up.**

**He slid a small flash drive across the counter. The plastic clinked against the Formica. “Everything your partner thinks he deleted. Code. Emails. Contracts. You’re smarter than he is — I can tell. Might as well take back what’s yours.”**

**I stared at it. “Who the hell are you?”**

**“Let’s just say I help people recover… what’s been taken from them. Digital recovery, mostly.” He smiled, but it wasn’t kind. “Corporate justice, if you want to dress it up nice.”**

**I didn’t touch the drive. “And what’s the price tag?”**

**He sipped his coffee. “A favor. Later.”**

**Simple. Too simple. Which meant it was dangerous. But desperation doesn’t care about fine print.**

**So I took it.**

**For the next month, I lived like a ghost with Wi-Fi. Crashed at motels with flickering lights, worked out of libraries and laundromats. I opened the drive. It was all there — every buried email, every hidden repo, even the contract drafts proving Leo had cut me out illegally. My fingerprints were still on every line of code. It was like holding my own past, raw and unedited.**

**I rebuilt everything from scratch. A new name. A new platform. No grand mission statement this time — just code that worked and didn’t belong to anyone else. I called it** ***Helix.*** **Sold a prototype to Pulse’s biggest rival, Emotiv, for just enough to breathe again.**

**Every dollar they wired me felt like oxygen.**  
 **Every bug I fixed felt like revenge.**

**But guilt? No.**  
 **Just momentum.**

**I told myself I wasn’t angry anymore. That this was just business. But deep down, I knew that was a lie. Revenge is just anger with good posture.**

**Then one night, my burner phone rang. Blocked number.**

**I hesitated, then answered.**

**“Ethan?” The voice was low, shaky. Mia.**

**For a moment, I didn’t breathe.**  
 **She whispered, “He’s not who you think. Leo’s in deeper than—”**

**I hung up.**

**Because I didn’t want to hear it.**  
 **Didn’t want to play the game of half-truths and trembling apologies.**

**She was trying to save me from something, maybe. Or maybe she was just trying to save herself. Either way, I didn’t care about redemption stories anymore.**

**What I cared about was control.**

**And for the first time in a long time, I could feel it again — cold, sharp, and humming beneath my skin.**

**The day of Pulse’s big public launch, the city felt cleaner than usual — too bright, too glassy, like it had been scrubbed of anything real. I showed up at the downtown convention center dressed in black: shirt, tie, nametag, all borrowed from a catering service that didn’t know I existed. My smile was fake, my badge misspelled, but nobody looked twice. People rarely do when you’re holding a tray.**

**Inside, the air buzzed with money and ego. Investors in tailored suits, influencers in rented confidence, cameras flashing like synthetic lightning. I could smell the arrogance — expensive perfume mixed with burnt coffee and the kind of champagne people drink just to prove they can.**

**Ronan’s voice came through the tiny earpiece tucked behind my collar.**  
 **“Signal’s clean,” he said. “On your mark.”**

**I was standing near the back, next to a wall draped in LED lights. My hands were steady, though my heart wasn’t. The tablet in my pocket vibrated — the code was ready. Months of sleepless nights, half-truths, and dirty favors, all distilled into one elegant act of revenge.**

**Then I saw him.**

**Leo.**  
 **Standing center stage in a custom navy suit, microphone clipped to his perfect jawline. He looked like the man I used to believe in — confident, unstoppable, untouchable. He grinned at the audience with that same fake warmth that once fooled me.**

**“Today,” he said, voice booming, “we redefine what it means to feel connected.”**

**He loved that word.** ***Connection.*** **He built an empire on it.**

**Behind him, the massive LED screen pulsed with color — a live demo of Pulse’s “emotion recognition engine.” The crowd leaned forward, hungry for the next digital miracle. I took a slow breath, slid my finger across the tablet.**

**Upload initiated.**

**The lights flickered, subtle at first. Then the feed glitched — a pixelated shimmer rippling across the display. I could almost hear my code unfolding, rewriting the illusion line by line.**

**At first, people thought it was part of the show. Then the app on their phones began to react — violently. Notifications poured in, not curated data, but** ***raw truth*****.**

**Their private messages.**  
 **Their unfiltered emotional profiles.**  
 **Affairs. Lies. Financial fraud.**

**Every heartbeat, every hidden impulse, projected live on-screen.**

**I didn’t build a demo.**  
 **I built a confession booth.**

**The room went silent for a beat, then chaos bloomed.**

**Phones buzzed. People shouted. Screens glowed red with panic. One investor’s face went pale as his wife’s messages flashed overhead — proof of a second life in Singapore. Another man dropped his phone and bolted for the door.**

**And Leo — my perfect, smiling partner — froze mid-sentence. The mic slipped from his hand, feedback screaming through the speakers. I could see the moment he realized what was happening. His eyes darted toward the screen — where my old emails appeared, timestamped, undeniable. His words.**

**“Cut him out quietly. I’ll keep his equity under my shell company.”**  
 **“Mia’s fine with it — she knows he’s too naive to fight back.”**

**Gasps filled the room like oxygen returning to a dying fire.**

**Mia was near the front. Her face drained of color as the texts kept coming — their messages to each other, my name between their sentences like a bruise. She screamed something, maybe at him, maybe at me. I couldn’t tell.**

**Ronan’s voice crackled in my ear. “You sure you wanna go through with this?”**

**I watched Leo stumble, trying to explain, to spin it, but no one was listening anymore. The great man was unraveling, his empire of charm collapsing in real time.**

**I whispered back, “Too late now.”**

**Security moved fast, whispering into earpieces, scanning the crowd for the source. But I was already walking — not running — toward the service exit. Calm. Detached. Like I’d already left my body behind.**

**As I passed the corridor mirrors, I caught my reflection. For a second, I didn’t recognize the man staring back. His eyes were cold, almost proud.**

**Ronan’s voice snapped again: “Get out. Now.”**

**I slipped through the back doors, heart hammering like an old machine struggling to restart. Outside, the air hit me — thick with heat, smog, and something like freedom.**

**Ronan was waiting by the van, engine idling, laptop still open on the dashboard. When he saw me, he let out a low whistle.**

**“Hell of a show,” he said, grinning wide. “You really outdid yourself.”**

**I tried to smile, but it didn’t reach. The adrenaline was fading, replaced by something hollow and heavy. “Guess we’re both in the business of recovery now.”**

**He nodded, eyes glinting. “Yeah. About that…”**

**That’s when I noticed it. The grin stayed, but his hand was different — steady, deliberate. And in that hand was a gun.**

**For a moment, the world shrank to the sound of the engine and the soft click of metal.**

**“About that favor,” he said again, almost kindly.**

**I didn’t speak. Didn’t move. The night around us buzzed with distant sirens, the kind that follow consequences.**

**And just like that, my victory — the one I thought I wanted — started to taste a lot like fear.**

**Ronan didn’t want money.**

**He wanted access — the master key. The servers, the backdoors, the network I’d spent years building. He wanted the chaos I’d unleashed to be his weapon. Turns out, the man who’d handed me a flash drive and called it “justice” wasn’t a savior. He was a data mercenary. My revenge was his payday.**

**He smiled like it was personal. “You built something dangerous, kid. I’m just giving it purpose.”**

**I remember the smell of oil and dust in that warehouse — stale air, old rust, flickering light from my laptop casting shadows on his face. He’d tied me to a chair with plastic zip ties, not cruelly, just efficiently. There’s something worse than malice — indifference.**

**On the screen, lines of code bled like veins. My code. Only now, it was being rewritten, multiplied, spread into networks I didn’t even recognize. “You don’t know what you’re doing,” I told him.**

**He chuckled. “Sure I do. You wanted truth. I’m just scaling it.”**

**Then he left.**

**The sound of the metal door closing was louder than the gun ever was.**

**Hours passed. My wrists burned from struggling against the ties. The laptop screen dimmed, glowing faintly in the dark. I could still hear the hum of the fan — the quiet labor of something alive, something I’d made and lost. I hated how proud part of me still was.**

**Finally, I found a shard of metal under a pile of broken pallets — thin, sharp enough. I dragged it across the tie, inch by inch, cutting into my skin before the plastic snapped.**

**When I got free, the warehouse was empty. The code was still running.**  
 **But I didn’t stop it.**

**Maybe I should have. Maybe I wanted to see how far the damage went.**

**By dawn, Pulse was everywhere. Not as a company anymore — as a curse.**  
 ***“The App That Killed Privacy.”***  
 **The headlines blurred together: government inquiries, lawsuits, whistleblowers coming out of nowhere. The whole idea of emotional data — reading people like algorithms — it imploded overnight.**

**Leo vanished from every public record. Mia too. Their social accounts went dark. I don’t know if they ran, or if Ronan made sure they couldn’t.**

**I didn’t stick around to find out.**

**I drove north. No plan. Just a bag, a cheap phone, and what was left of me. The freeway stretched into fog, the kind that swallows things whole. Somewhere around Big Sur, I stopped at a gas station, bought a burner laptop, and created a new name.**

**No more Pulse. No more Cross.**

**Just Ethan North — another ghost with a Wi-Fi signal.**

**I rented a cabin by a lake, small enough to disappear in. I built again — not a company this time, not an empire. Something quieter. Code that didn’t predict people, but helped them stay hidden. Encryption tools for journalists. Anonymous payment platforms for whistleblowers. I stopped chasing connection. I started protecting it.**

**I didn’t advertise. Didn’t hire. Didn’t tell anyone who I was.**

**Some nights, I’d stay up late, fingers hovering over the keyboard, the glow of the screen reflecting off the window — the same color as the sky before dawn. That was when I’d hear it.**

**That click.**

**That quiet snap inside my head — the one that started it all.**

**It used to mean something breaking: trust, sanity, illusion.**  
 **Now, it meant something else.**

**Control.**

**I wasn’t naïve enough to call it peace. But it was close enough.**

**Sometimes I still dream about that morning in the glass conference room — the smell of coffee, the sound of Mia’s laugh, the shock of everything collapsing at once. In the dream, I don’t walk away. I just stand there, holding the tray, frozen between past and future.**

**But when I wake, I know better.**

**Some things have to burn before they make light.**

**So I keep typing.**  
 **Not to build a world this time — just to understand it.**  
 **And somewhere in that rhythm — the tap, the silence, the click — I hear what I lost becoming something else.**

**Not revenge.**  
 **Not forgiveness.**

**Just the truth, finally clean.**

**I lost everything in one day.**

**But maybe I needed to.**

**It’s strange — how destruction can feel like clarity when you’ve been living blind for so long. I used to think my work defined me, that success was a kind of love you could measure in downloads and investors’ smiles. But when it all burned down, when every line of code turned against me, I finally saw what was left underneath all that noise.**

**What survived wasn’t the company, or the girl, or even the dream.**  
 **It was the part of me that refused to die.**

**I used to think revenge was the opposite of peace — that you had to choose between them.**  
 **Now I think maybe you don’t.**  
 **Maybe revenge is just peace with teeth.**

**Some nights, when the roads are empty, I drive past the city — that glittering lie of light and ambition. Through the smog, I still catch the faint outline of the old Pulse billboard. The logo half-burned, still pulsing in red.**

**It flickers like a heartbeat.**

**And for a moment, I can’t tell if it’s the city’s or mine.**  
 **Either way, it reminds me that I’m still here.**  
 **Alive. Changed. Unfinished.**

It was mostly FWB, but there seemed to be real feelings involved. One night he invited me out with his friends and I acted in ways I am not proud of (flirting with other men outside after having too much to drink). After that I night I basically got demoted from potential gf to booty call. I decided I had had enough and ended it with him. We didn't speak for a month and in a moment of weakness, I reached out. I was surprised he picked up and spent a good hour on the phone with me, just catching up. Later that night I texted him I missed him and he said ""are you sure lol?"" and when I asked if he missed me too he said ""you already know"". I am pretty sure he is a hardcore DA, so of course trying to decode the nature of these responses is not easy. Finally, I asked him is he has plans this evening and he said yes but lets have coffee this week. I asked if he was seeing anyone and he got very annoyed, so I assume it is a yes but he kept repeating it ""lets discuss it all face to face over coffee"". 

  
Is this guy just trying to get me off his back and/or be polite or is there something else ... Is the answer ""you know already"" to I miss you just a way of saying no?

1or7rzw,https://www.reddit.com/r/prediabetes/comments/1or7rzw/small_incremental_changes_hoping_for_the_best/,Small Incremental Changes - Hoping for the best,"Hi all, glad this group is around. Thought I'd just share some stuff about my journey and hoping that I am on the right path.

  
I'm 38 m, was diagnosed with prediabetes (6.7!). I'm pretty active; well, the activeness went down a bit due to injury. 



Long story short, I had knee surgery, and before that, they had to run some blood work. And that's where they detected that I was prediabetic. If it weren't for my knee surgery, I probably would have done blood work waaay later. My doctor offered me metformin or to immediately change my diet. I decided to change my diet first. 

  
Anywho, I kinda disregarded it (changing my diet) post surgery, with the ego that ""meh. I'm still 38, I'm prediabetic. I can still eat like crap."" 

  
About two months ago, I felt extremely fatigued. I was eating a breakfast burger and felt tired. And so I thought I needed coffee; therefore, I had Vietnamese coffee (I'm sure some of you know, that thing is like crack lol). The weird thing is that I IMMEDIATELY passed out after having vietnamese coffee. Usually, I'd be up for hours and hours with that thing. That's when I knew something was off. 

  
Since then, I made changes. The big one was that I immediately stopped drinking lattes, and went for black coffee instead/chaggachino (tastes good and doesn't spike up my glucose).

  
I have a Stelo as well, so I've been watching closely what seems to be spiking my glucose, etc.

I mainly drink just water now. If I'm drinking alcohol, it would be hard liquor or a seltzer. I've cut down rice (this was a bit tough being Filipino lol), and increased my protein even more so. 

I've also increased my physical activity since surgery, which should help. The biggest win so far is that I lost 13 pounds literally in a month (from 181 to 168). That's great and all, but I'm really more focused on getting my glucose down. 

  
I'm planning on getting bloodwork done at the end of the year and I'm hoping for better results.  

  
I'm noticing several threads here about reversing prediabetes, etc., and I, too, am now trying to understand it a bit better. 

It seems like once I reverse prediabetes (and I hope I will), I can't just revert to my old ways. And this can be a huge challenge for many of us, especially if our loved ones are eating whatever they want, with no repercussions. 

  
But I'm also learning to accept that hey, maybe I shouldn't revert back to my old ways anyway, as it's just going to impact my health (beyond diabetes). I presume that yes, I can eventually have some cheat days here and there, but it just can't be like the old days. And this is even when I fully reverse prediabetes. 

  
Anyway, I wanted to say hello, and I love the support in this group. I hope i'm in the right track. Would love to hear any advice from any of you! 

  
My avg glucose has been at 120 but has now dropped to 110. I'd love for it to be in the 90's.

I would like to thank you everyone regardless communicating before, if you are in this subreddit and participate to make this community bigger, thank you for each one of you. Although I don't have anyone to consult in my environment, you guys are the greatest source ever to navigate me.

My story:

After quitting an extremely intense PM job in August by my own will, I wanted to spare my free time to get PMP as a 31-year-old civil engineer(MSc). Started with AR Udemy course around september yet couldn't manage to sustain it earlier than October. As I finish the course on mid-October, I have watched couple videos of AR and DM. To be honest after completing course with 77% mock exam result, I felt confident unnecessarily.

I explain that confidency as unnecessarily; cause I applied the exam and accessed Study Hall prior to 15 days before the exam. Even if I trust my conversational skills in English which led me to become a successful PM in international projects; it's not my native language. With bad sleep habits and distracted attention, it was hard to focus on even 10 questions in a row. At that level I found out that I must build a muscle to avoid that blur in my mind.

I studied consistently in the last 15 days, 1 hour minimum and 5-6 hours maximum. Kept going with videos of AR, DM and MR. Solved 20% SH practice questions as 68%, all the 15 mini exams with a range of 47-87% (average 66%) and took 2 mock exams of SH as 66 and 70%. Completing mocks were compelling, I managed to simulate it with exact breaks. Expert questions were pulling me down and damaging my own structure of mindset. Third3Rock notes was really useful, just read main sheet once and skimmed the cheatsheet a day last night. I know that I have enough skills to make it done, just wasn't confident even 5 mins before exam.

My exam:

I couldn't sleep well the night before, I had still a good breakfast a nice coffee. I simulated 25 questions last night from Pearson website, so skipped the instructions. First 60 was a bit tougher than moderate, lots of D&D and multiple choices than I expected. Ordinary questions were alright. Second 60 was easy and boosted my morale, I finished around 45mins and 5min review was enough. The last 60 part was really hard, not only cause of last part but also questions were mostly challenging. Managed to finish exam and had time to review last part around 7-8 mins. I used both of my 10 min breaks and best thing about it there was a balcony in test center to smoke a cigarette each. It was life-saver as I am a heavy smoker :) Due to tough last 60 questions I was 51% sure to pass in the end and to read ""PASS"" calmed down my heartbeats.

Summary of questions:

* Agile weighted more than 50%, predictive 30% and the rest hybrids were hard to detect mostly. I chose best approach relevant with mindset.
* 15+ multiple choices
* 8+ D&D at least
* No calculations, one CPI-SPI to interpret and take resource action for contingency.
* One graph for Burn-up chart to interpret on not adding tasks by PO during sprint.
* Very close to SH, less wordy and slightly clearer vocab.

Now I could update my CV and enjoy the dopamine by exact achievements. This target was a milestone about the desired change of my life and career and hopefully it will be useful. All the best wishes for all!",1,1762552991.0,pmp,0,1.0,False

**Key Financial Metrics:**

- **Revenue:** $84,431 for the nine months ended June 30, 2025, a decrease of 94.86% compared to $1,641,955 in the prior year period. Q3 2025 revenue was $61,578, down 83.2% from $366,888 in Q3 2024.
- **Net Loss:** $(2,990,047) for the nine months ended June 30, 2025, a lower loss compared to $(5,242,739) in the prior year. Q3 2025 net loss was $(1,068,242) vs. $(1,192,434) in Q3 2024.
- **Gross Profit:** $20,612 for the nine months ended June 30, 2025, versus a gross loss of $(178,185) in the prior year.
- **Operating Expenses:** $3,387,725 for the nine months ended June 30, 2025, down 28.65% from $4,748,076 in the prior year.
- **Cash Position:** $35,958 as of June 30, 2025, a significant decline from $464,222 at September 30, 2024.
- **Total Assets:** $13,309,302 as of June 30, 2025 (vs. $5,587,655 in 2024).
- **Total Liabilities:** $2,671,985 as of June 30, 2025, reduced from $6,238,323 at September 30, 2024.
- **Stockholders’ Equity:** $10,637,317 (improved from $(650,668) at September 30, 2024), with an accumulated deficit of $(85,335,700).
- **Shares Outstanding:** 196,514,084 as of October 27, 2025.

**Operational Highlights:**

- The company transitioned to focus on the “Maca Series” of health-focused beverages, launching new products (Maca-Noni, Maca Peptide Coffee, Maca Purified Powder, Maca Wine).
- Revenue now derives primarily from the PRC; North American revenue dropped to zero in the current period.
- Major customers are highly concentrated—one customer (XG) accounted for 56% of revenue in 9M 2025.
- Significant cost reduction achieved—operating expenses fell by over $1.3 million year-over-year.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources:**

- The company is heavily reliant on continued capital raises to fund operations. Cash burn remains high, with net cash used in operating activities totaling $(11,233,693) for the period.
- Financing was primarily through equity: $10 million raised via common stock issuance and $2.45 million through private placements. Also, $1.49 million short-term loan repayments made.
- Subsequent to the quarter, two major private placements: $4 million for 16,666,666 shares (Aug 2025) and $55 million in bitcoin for 220 million shares (closed September 2025).

**Risks and Uncertainties:**

- **Going Concern:** Continued existence hinges on successful future capital raises. The company’s own statement: ""We anticipate that it will need to raise additional capital immediately.""
- **Nasdaq Listing Deficiency:** On October 8, 2025, the company received a notification of delinquency regarding timely filing, which could potentially impact listing status.
- **Customer Concentration:** Revenues are highly reliant on a small number of customers, increasing sales risk.
- **Legal Proceedings:** The company is or has been subject to litigation risks (Curtin litigation, Kim litigation, Ex-directors lawsuit). No adverse outcomes to date, but they may have future impact.
- **Discontinued Operations:** The company exited businesses in Korea, resulting in significant past-period losses and impairment, and the transition to new business lines remains underway.
- **Geographical Transition:** All current revenues are now from the PRC, exposing CIMG to regulatory and market risks specific to China.

**Other Notable Factors:**

- No income tax expense due to continued operating losses and full valuation allowance on deferred tax assets.
- Inventory increased to $11.88 million from $4.55 million, indicating build-up of raw materials or finished goods for new product lines.
- Accounts receivable balance is low ($75,630), but risk is mitigated by allowance for credit losses.
- Warrants outstanding at quarter-end: 25,798,750 at a weighted average exercise price of $1.31.

**Conclusion:**

CIMG Inc. is undergoing a major transition, shifting geographic and product focus to health-oriented beverages in the PRC. Significant cost reductions have not offset the collapse in revenues to date, and losses remain substantial. Liquidity is a critical, near-term risk, with the business highly reliant on continual equity issuance. Investors should be aware of the high customer concentration, listing compliance issues, and ongoing legal risks. Aggressive capital raising (notably, large unregistered private placements) may be dilutive. The turnaround potential exists if new product lines gain traction, but current fundamentals remain challenged.

Maybe I just need to get the words out 'fore the tide takes the rest of me.

The sea's been creepin' closer these last few years.  
You can hear it at night--gnawin' at the pilin's, chewin' 'em down to gray splinters.

Down here, the fog don't roll in--it *settles* across the land.  
Presses on the world like a suffocatin' wet hand.  
Some mornin's it' so thick you can't tell sky from swamp, can't see the buoy floatin' twenty feet off the dock.

Feels like livin' at the edge o' the world, with *nothin'* beyond that wall o' gray.

Our little town's dyin'.  
Shrimp plant shut down last winter--post office followed soon after.  
Ain't nobody sendin' letters to this ol' backwater no more.  
Ol' Miss Maggie still lights her window come dusk, though ain't nobody stopped by in years.  
The rest done packed for Baton Rouge or Lafayette long ago.

Ain't much left here in Saint Odile but ghosts and old memories.  
The tide keeps eatin' what little's left, one day at a time.  
Us few still hangin' on--we were born here, and here's where we'll stay.  
'Til the sea swallows us too.

Even the egrets quit callin'.  
Maybe they heard somethin' I ain't.

I keep my skiff tied behind the bait shack, though I don't take her out much these days.  
The traps come up empty more often than not, and the harbormaster don't even bother takin' notes no more.  
Still, old habit digs in deep.  
Every dawn I walk down with a thermos of coffee, check the lines, and listen to that foghorn moanin' from the point.  
Used to sound mournful.  
Now it just sounds *tired.*

Every mornin' I walk the same stretch o' shore, pickin' through driftwood and busted crab pots for the stove.  
Most of it's nothin'--junk wood, old rope, bones of boats too tired to float.

But sometimes... sometimes I find stranger things.

One mornin' I spotted somethin' wedged 'tween the rocks.  
Looked like a chunk o' driftwood at first--dark, waterlogged, half-buried in the muck.  
When I kicked it loose, it clanged against the stone.  
Metal.

Heavier'n it looked, it was cold and slick as river rock.  
It was about the size of my hand.  
Didn't look rusted like scrap oughta be.  
Smooth. Polished.  
Veins crawlin' along its length like somethin' that used to be alive.

Told myself it was part of a motor, maybe a propeller housin'.  
But I ain't never seen one shaped like that.  
When I picked it up, it was warm to the touch—*too* warm for somethin' fished outta the Gulf.  
And underneath the warmth, there was a *pulse*.  
A slow, steady hum I could feel in my bones.

Can't rightly say why, but I brought it home.  
Felt... familiar somehow.  
Like I'd seen it in a dream.

Cleaned the muck off and set it by the window.  
Sunlight hit the metal just so, and I saw the words etched on the side, neat as machine work:

***DURATH / UNIT 1317-A / PROPERTY OF—***

The rest was gone, eaten by salt and time.

I left it sittin' on the mantle—that night, the hum filled the house.  
And my dreams... changed.

Weren't nightmares, not exactly.

I was standin' on the shoreline, starin' out over the black water.  
Waves lappin' against my bare feet.  
That low, thunderin' drone rollin' through the night.

Only it wasn't no foghorn.  
That slow, rhythmic vibration felt familiar.

Beneath the tide, a blue light bloomed—soft, shimmerin'.  
Then another. And another.  
'Til the whole damn Gulf was lit up like the stars had fallen from the sky.

I woke up before dawn, my feet cold and wet.  
Sand all over the floor, and a skull-splittin' headache.

Look, I know how it sounds, but I ain't crazy.

A few days later, another piece washed ashore.  
Smaller'n the first, shaped like a bent rib, black as old oil.  
It thrummed the same as the other, faint and low, and when I set it near the first piece, the sound deepened. Harmonized.

Wasn't no coincidence.  
Next mornin', I found another. Then another.

I had the same dream night after night.  
Black sea, blue lights. The bone-rattling hum.

Only... they weren't no dreams.

I started keepin' what I'd found in the shed out back, laid 'em out on the workbench like puzzle pieces.  
Couldn't make sense of it at first, but when I closed my eyes, I could *feel* the hum.

When I put the pieces together, they came *alive*.

Little threads that looked like electrical wirin' reached out n' pulled the two pieces together 'til they weren't two pieces no more, but one. Try as I might, I couldn't get them apart again.

Didn't take long 'fore the thing started takin' shape.  
It wasn't no motor, that much I can tell you. No pipes, no fuel lines.  
The insides glowed faintly, like the heart o a smolderin' ember.  
And then when I stepped close, I could feel it *breathin'* in time with the hum.

The hum's deeper now—steady as a heartbeat.  
Sometimes, when I'm sittin' quiet, I can feel mine beatin' right alongside it.

Last night, I dreamed again.  
The lights under the sea were closer this time—rising toward the surface like a thousand eyes openin' all at once.

And above it all, a voice. Low, calm, and big as the ocean itself.

It called to me—said my name.  
I couldn't look away.

That hum's been gettin' louder.  
Not in a way you'd notice right off, but it's everywhere now—buzzin' in the pipes, in the stove, even in my teeth when I drink my coffee.  
Sometimes I catch the radio flickerin' to life on its own, playin' a voice that ain't speakin' any language I know.

Then there's the sea—she don't smell right.  
Ain't brine nor rot, but somethin' else, like the air before a thunderstorm.  
Last night I saw lights movin' under the waves again. Brighter this time. Closer.  
And for a heartbeat, I could swear the fog pulsed in time with the hum.

Like it was alive.

The fog's thicker an' stays longer with every passing day.  
Ol' Miss Maggie says her pacemaker *sings* in harmony with the hum each night.

The hum's stronger now.  
Nothin' drowns it out no more—not the wind, not the foghorn, not even the storms that roll through these parts. The house shakes when it gets goin', almost like it's breathin'.

Last night, I dreamed I was standin' at the shoreline again, but it was different this time.  
The sky was black as pitch, thunder rumblin' out past the breakers.  
I was holdin' the machine—the thing I built without meanin' to, veins of blue light runnin' through it like blood. The sea was waitin' for me, wide and endless.

Then the lights rose up out of the deep.  
Hundreds of 'em, glowin' blue beneath the waves, risin' into the storm like stars fallin' in reverse.

Lightnin' cracked, and for a breath, I saw it hangin' over the water.  
Wasn't no ship. Wasn't no god, neither, but somethin' in between.  
A machine made of metal, sinew, and wire.  
Reachin' down with its cable tendrils that minded me of roots, or veins.

It wanted what I'd made.

I offered it freely.

I could neither refuse nor look away.

The blue light died, turnin' blacker'n pitch.  
Colors rippled 'cross its metal shell like oil on water.  
It *drank* *in* the starlight.  
The blackness around it deepened, thick as tar.

The hum rose, low and hungry, 'til it felt like the world itself was groanin'.  
I dropped to my knees, clutchin' my head.

And then the thing spoke.

Not in words, not the way folks talk, but through the otherworldly grindin' and churnin' of its own makin'—still, I understood three words:

***""RECONSTRUCT... HOST... RETURN.""***

Three commandin' words, heavy and cold as iron.  
I screamed as they were burned into me like a brand.

When I came to, the hum was gone. The shed was empty.

Now, the silence feels wrong, and the fog never clears.  
The tide's gone out too far, and the sea's holdin' its breath.

I can still feel it callin' to me.  
I don't know how much longer I can resist.  
Soon, the tide'll swallow me too.

1or7liy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1or7liy/aitah_lack_of_comms_killed_the_friendship/,AITAH lack of comms killed the friendship,"Let me preface this with I (32f) have only in the last year started properly cultivating a girl friendship group.

I had a friend we'll call L(30s). L 'broke up' with me today after months of stilted communication. She'd moved out of town with her new fiance. Happy for her, it all seems to be going well for her. Except she said she felt left out because the friend group is not reaching out as much as they could have done. We (including herself) are all crap at staying in touch. I tried a couple of times, but the idea that I should reach out to prove we're still friends is puzzling.

Our schedules don't line up. Literally the only place we met at (when she was single and lived nearby)was our local; never coffee, the occasional gig outside it. I don't think we spoke much outside of that.

It wasn't my biggest brain moment, but after she sent the break up text, I asked a friend, C(30s), to add her to a group chat. This group chat began with 4 girls, including me. I asked to add a couple of people recently. I think I held off on inviting L because I was afraid her reaction would not be pleasant, given she wasn't ""picked first"".

In my big brain moment, I decided that if she wasn't my friend, that's fine, but here's where everyone else congregates now. I'm now second guessing; she probably thought I'd immediately gone to bitching about her and I'd invited her for an execution (no one knew we'd been struggling with comms for a bit, or the way she wording the text). I made the mistake of not asking her if she wanted to be added, probably for the reason listed above. C added L, who immediately stated her intention to leave before doing so.

Now I think I shouldn't have gotten C involved at all, because apparently the next thing to happen was L sending a copy/pasted message to C, in addition to all the ways she was a crappy person.

On the one hand, I feel I did wrong by getting L added to the group, the timing, not picked first etc. On the other, I'm feeling like a bullet dodged? If someone can think so poorly of me and the other friends she supposedly missed so badly, how can she say those things?

Not sure I mind if L sees this. She ironically chose cutting off over communication. A message where I invited her to tell me if everything was alright went ignored before the break up.

Buddy and I are on our way back from a little off-roading adventure and pop into the one Tim Horton's for an hour to grab a coffee and a snack for the long drive home. I needed cigarettes so we went inside instead of the drive-thru and ordered. I got a bagel and a coffee, he got a wrap and potato wedges. I tapped my debit card, he handed him a $20 and got his change.

We get our food and buddy's potato wedges aren't there. So of course he asks the guy for his wedges.

The cashier, with his bare hand, reaches into the potato wedge tray (after just handling money), grabs a fistful of wedges (in a not gentle way), and places them in a bowl and hands them to him.

I was mortified.

Asa says ""No, REAL adults who pay bills."" 

OKAY ASS. First of all, don't play, your daughter is paying all your bills, funding your vacations, and providing you all of your ""fun money"" so that YOU never need to act like adults. Only the mindless sycophants believe otherwise. It's not Slimelife. It's 90% the channel, which would be nothing without Abbie. She is more of a ""bill-paying real adult"" than any of them are because, through no intention of her own, she is carrying the household. 

Second, if he really doesn't think of her as a ""real adult,"" why does he force these ""typical adult experiences"" on her? Why does he allow his wife to take away her toys and anything that she actually enjoys and has fun with because ""it makes her too sad to see an adult playing with toys?"" If she's not a ""real adult"" why does she need the birthday party bus and a ""real job"" (when he doesn't even have one!) working as a barista in an ""autism-friendly coffee shop?""

Another shit energy day :( Dad is getting worried again and is saying he can't do much more of this cycle, doing well then slipping back and I completely understand. The voice is back and it is strong! I am scared of sweets again and 'extras', I feel I can't go to my grannies because I can't have a pre-made sandwich, portions are smaller, energy is low, dizziness is back, lighter options are favourite. But I am determined to get myself out of this shitty hole. It's been 2-3 days of it, so it is not the end of the world if I nip it in the bud ASAP! But I REALLY need to get my energy up particularly as I am back to work TOMORROW! For 6.5hrs! 

This is where I *really* need some help with rationalising my thoughts because the thought of meeting my 2600 goal is stressing me out and feels wrong and excessive because all the 2000 crap and because I have been gaining on less. My ED is telling me it is 'too much', 'I am well enough now' and 'I can gain on less', stick with the 'safe amount' blah blah blah. I do worry aiming for this number is quite a lot given my weight etc but I know I should just trust the plan. If anyone has any thoughts/advice on countering these thoughts it would be appreciated? I have been trying to think I am gonna gain weight anyways so I might as well do it properly whilst rewiring my brain and giving my metabolism an actual consistent intake instead of all this back and forth! But is 2600 excessive, I can’t rationalise this!?

In terms of an actual plan to get my energy up, a lovely commenter suggested leaning into the foods I enjoy and I think this is such a good idea. I love trying new foods and like to challenge something new everyday because I have been restricted for many years. But ultimately I have also discovered so many foods I really enjoy (sandwiches, jacket potatoes, biscuit curls, jam, cheesecakes, ice cream, cakes, dark chocolate, honey, sourdough, dairy free choc, stew, champ) and if it makes it easier to just rotate these new favourite foods but ACTUALLY meet my energy I think it could be a good idea as a way to get me started/make it easier to meet my energy. I have roughly 7 dinners and 4 desserts I really like, so for now I am just gonna rotate these instead of getting overwhelmed trying to come up with new ideas. As I have found a *massive* trigger for me is when I can't decide what to have or I try something and don't like it, this is why having a rough plan also helps. So *finger crossed* this might help. Also should save me money lol. I still do want to challenge myself everyday with something new, so the ED doesn't become compliant but the priority needs to be energy and not just talking about it actually meeting *at least* 2500 (btw not strictly tracking and never will again but roughly)! Particularly going back to work, being more active and still needing to gain!",2,1762552220.0,recoveryplates,4,0.75,False

I’m always kind to baristas and tip every single time. But this is the first time I’ve ever felt like taking my tip back. The owner was the most microaggressive person I've seen. I’ve never seen a business owner roll their eyes at a customer while they were still in the store.

I checked the Google reviews and realized I wasn’t the only one who felt this way. When a small business owner accuses customers of being unfair for leaving an honest review just because they’re a “small business,” that’s a huge red flag to me.

The coffee and drinks were mediocre — another spot where TikTok hype and aesthetic outweigh the actual quality. Spend your money somewhere that truly deserves the support and recognition.

**Edit:** You may have a different experience than I did, and I’m sure they’ll still attract plenty of customers. But I do think that constantly highlighting the fact that you’re a “small business” whenever you receive a mediocre review or an honest recommendation is what’s ruining people’s perception of small businesses.

If you have the [American Express® Gold Card](https://oc.brcclx.com/t?lid=26737147), you get up to $7/month in Dunkin' credits ($84/year). Industry data shows 40%+ of cardholders never use this. Don't be that person.

**The basics:**

* $7 monthly credit at US Dunkin' locations
* Must enroll manually (takes 60 seconds in the app under Benefits) - [here's the link](https://global.americanexpress.com/card-benefits/detail/dunkin-credit/gold)
* Use it or lose it - doesn't roll over
* Still earn 4X points on the full purchase amount

**Strategy 1: Just buy stuff at Dunkin'**

Obviously you can grab coffee/breakfast. The $6 meal deal (breakfast sandwich + hash browns + iced coffee) is basically free with the credit.

**Strategy 2: Load your Dunkin' account (the real hack)**

This is clutch if you don't have a Dunkin' nearby:

1. Open the Dunkin' app
2. Add your Amex Gold to saved payments
3. Load $7 to your Dunkin' Card each month
4. Credit posts in 2-3 days
5. Use the accumulated balance when you travel/find a Dunkin'

**Important:** This ONLY works by loading your Dunkin' account. Buying physical gift cards does NOT trigger the credit.

**Strategy 3: Use it at Baskin-Robbins**

Lesser-known: Some Baskin-Robbins locations accept Dunkin' stored value cards. Load $7 on your Dunkin' account, use it for ice cream. YMMV by location.

**Pro tip:** Set a recurring calendar alert for the 1st of each month. Takes 2 minutes to load $7, and you'll never miss it. 

We'll also remind you not to miss out on this credit - and all the credits for your cards - for free in the Kudos app. 

That's it. Stop leaving free money on the table. What's better than free coffee, donuts, and ice cream? We'll wait.

1or6y4o,https://i.redd.it/pkou6fldlwzf1.jpeg,How to Quickly Prepare For a Real Estate Listing Photo Shoot,"First impressions matter, especially in real estate. Professional listing photos can make the difference between a property that sits on the market and one that generates immediate interest. But even the most skilled photographer needs a well-prepared home to capture its full potential.

Whether you're a homeowner getting ready to list or a real estate agent preparing a property for a shoot, proper preparation is essential. Here's your comprehensive guide to getting a home photo-ready quickly and efficiently.

# Start With a Deep Clean

A sparkling clean home photographs infinitely better than one that's merely tidy. Focus on these key areas:

**Windows and glass surfaces** should be spotless inside and out. Smudges, fingerprints, and water spots are magnified in photos. Clean windows also allow maximum natural light to flood the space, which photographers rely on for bright, inviting images.

**Floors and carpets** need to be vacuumed, mopped, or steam-cleaned. Any stains or dirt patches will be glaringly obvious in professional photos. Consider professional carpet cleaning if needed, especially in high-traffic areas.

**Kitchen and bathrooms** require extra attention. Wipe down all countertops, polish fixtures until they shine, clean the stovetop thoroughly, and make sure there's no soap scum or mildew anywhere. These rooms can make or break a listing.

# Declutter Ruthlessly

Professional real estate photography is about showcasing the home's features and space, not the current owner's belongings. Take a minimalist approach:

Remove personal items like family photos, children's artwork, and memorabilia. Potential buyers need to envision themselves in the space, and personal items make that difficult.

Clear all countertops in the kitchen and bathroom. Put away small appliances, toiletries, dish soap, and anything else sitting out. A few carefully chosen decorative items are fine, but less is definitely more.

Thin out furniture if rooms feel cramped. Photographers need space to position their equipment and capture wide angles. A room that feels cozy in person can look cluttered in photos if there's too much furniture.

# Enhance Curb Appeal

The exterior shots set the tone for the entire listing. Spend time making the outside as inviting as possible:

Mow the lawn, edge walkways, and trim any overgrown bushes or trees. Pull weeds from flower beds and add fresh mulch if needed. A tidy landscape suggests a well-maintained property.

Power wash the driveway, walkways, and exterior siding if they look dingy. This simple step can dramatically improve the home's appearance.

Add welcoming touches like potted plants near the entrance, a new doormat, or fresh flowers. These small details create an inviting first impression.

# Maximize Natural Light

Natural light is a photographer's best friend. Before the shoot:

Open all curtains, blinds, and shades to let in as much natural light as possible. This creates bright, airy photos that appeal to buyers.

Turn on all lights in the home, including lamps, overhead fixtures, and even closet lights. This supplements natural light and ensures no area looks dark or shadowy.

Replace any burnt-out bulbs and make sure all light fixtures have bulbs of the same color temperature for consistency.

# Stage Key Rooms Strategically

You don't need professional staging to prepare for photos, but thoughtful arrangement helps:

**Living areas** should look comfortable and inviting. Fluff pillows, straighten throws, and arrange furniture to highlight the room's best features. Add a coffee table book or fresh flowers as a focal point.

**Bedrooms** benefit from neatly made beds with neutral, quality bedding. Remove excess pillows and keep nightstands minimal. Open closet doors slightly to show storage space, but make sure they're organized.

**Dining areas** can be set with simple place settings to show scale and purpose. A bowl of fresh fruit or a vase of flowers adds life without distraction.

# Handle the Details

Small touches make a significant difference in professional photos:

Hide trash cans, pet bowls, and litter boxes completely. These everyday items distract from the home's features.

Remove vehicles from the driveway and garage to showcase parking space and create clean exterior shots.

Put away garden hoses, children's toys, and any outdoor equipment. The goal is to present a pristine, uncluttered property.

Close toilet lids and remove bathroom rugs (they often look messy in photos).

# Create Focal Points

Every room should have something that draws the eye:

A vase of fresh flowers, a bowl of lemons in the kitchen, or a artful arrangement of throw pillows can create visual interest without cluttering the space.

In empty rooms, consider bringing in a few pieces of furniture or decor to give the space context and help buyers understand its potential.

# Final Walkthrough

Thirty minutes before your photographer arrives, do a final walkthrough:

Walk through each room as if you're seeing it for the first time. Look for anything you missed: clothes draped over a chair, magazines on a coffee table, or soap bottles in the shower.

Check all faucets and fixtures to make sure they're clean and there's no water spotting.

Adjust window treatments one last time to ensure they're even and symmetrical.

Turn on all lights again and verify that each room looks bright and welcoming.

# The Bottom Line

Preparing for a real estate photo shoot doesn't have to be overwhelming. Focus on cleanliness, decluttering, and maximizing light. Remember that the goal is to showcase the property itself, not the lifestyle of its current occupants.

With these preparation steps, you'll help your photographer capture images that highlight your property's best features and attract serious buyers. The time invested in preparation will pay dividends when your listing goes live with stunning, professional photos that make buyers eager to schedule a showing.

I confess that with every passing week, I get angrier about my three-year online relationship — and I think I might be ready to leave. Yet something keeps holding me back: here are some of my dailey thoughts. They seem to be hitting me the hardest while I am at work. 

1. Am I just falling in love with potential, and it would be smart to walk away?


2. Or am I being impatient — should I give him the same time, grace, and blind trust he once gave me?



Lately, I’ve been catching myself in angry thought loops — especially while I’m at work. Stuff like:

1. How can a 34-year-old man want a family and kids but not even want to support himself?


2. How can you be 34 and too lazy to set up a bank account?


3. How can you refuse mental health help, life coaching, or family support — and instead blame everyone else for your problems?


4. How do you stay up all night gaming, have your family and girlfriend invest in your streaming setup, and then do absolutely nothing with it?


5. How the fuck am I supposed to build a future with a lazy man when our work ethics are polar opposites?


6. Dude won’t even work an hour to buy me flowers — and when he does, he complains like he deserves a gold star.


7. How can I expect someone who won’t put effort into himself to put effort into us?


8. I’m losing faith in our future.


9. Am I trauma-bonded again? Because I’m exhausted.


10. Is it okay to give up and start over?



There’s more — but I’ll spare you the darker ones.

I know resentment is the death sentence of any relationship, and I can feel it growing. Everything I’ve said here, I’ve already said to him. I’ve asked for change. Now I’m waiting — not with an ultimatum, but with limits. When I’ve had enough, I’ll communicate that and leave respectfully.

I’m not someone who blindsides people. I speak plainly, with compassion but also accountability. I’ve been through enough to know that love doesn’t survive without action.


The Backstory

To understand where I’m coming from, you need a little context.

About eight years ago, I met a man online — not the one I’m with now. I ignored all the red flags. I was young, eager, and honestly just wanted to love and be loved. I grew up with an amazing example of a healthy marriage. My parents modeled partnership built on mutual respect, communication, and commitment. That’s what I thought I was stepping into.

But instead, I walked into hell.

He was a DACA kid who needed his papers, and I thought love could fix everything. I sold my home, moved states, and married him. Within months, the control started — isolation, financial abuse, cheating, emotional degradation, starvation, manipulation, and eventually physical intimidation. His family was part of it.

I was cut off from my own family, friends, and financial independence. Every dollar I made was taken. I had to ask for permission to eat or spend. I had to live for his family who has done nothing but make poor choices and hurt people for instant gratification.  If I made the “wrong” choice — even something as small as picking the wrong meal — I was punished with days of cold silence, gaslighting, or humiliation.

It got dark enough that I stopped recognizing myself. I became small — scared, quiet, just surviving.

When I finally sought help, it was through BetterHelp, couples counseling, and eventually a women’s shelter therapist — the woman who, honestly, saved my life. She once told me I had been trapped in what she called a “Portuguese Narcissistic Family Cult.” I’ll never forget those words.

It took over a year to get out. And during that time, my ex went through the motions of therapy for “domestically abusive men,” where I got monthly updates from his counselor. Those reports got worse each time — his aggression, his entitlement, his refusal to take accountability. Most men in that program don’t reform, and he didn’t either.

He grew angrier, controlling, and petty — he’d trash the house to “punish” me, drain our accounts, and eventually starved me out again when he felt his control slipping. He’d steal my belongings, threaten my family, and eventually hurt my cat (he survived, thankfully).

But the day I got free? It was surreal.

I remember my ex asking to watch a movie randomly. He said ""you can order anything you like"". (It was a big deal because I was never allowed to decide what we ate and if I did and it was wrong I got emotionally punished for it). I chose Pizza and Fried Calamari with a Coke. I remember sitting at the dinner table crying from joy after he read a scripted note off his phone about how he was ready for a divorce. I gave him a hug and thanked him for setting him free after I handed him the mountains of proof I had to put him in jail if he countined to abuse me through the process of divorce. 

I asked for 3 things. 
1. A ticket back home. 
2. Our shared cat that he neglected. 
3. And the chance to go to the doctors/dentist for the first time in years. 


After seeing the fear in his eyes I knew I was walking out alive. All I could think about in that moment was my now current boyfriend. 

I ran outside to get safety in my car and I called him. I was more excited to tell him the news. I felt no pain of finding out my marriage was ending. 

Told him, “I never want to do poly again. I’m finally free. And I can finally tell you I love you and only you.” We both spent the whole night together just talking and processing.  It was night I'd never forget. 


When the divorce was final — via Zoom court — my cat literally sat in the camera frame, glaring at him. I took that as the universe’s applause. Let me know if you want to see that picture. Because it's internet breaking. 

The best revenge is happiness. And I chose it.
I made a 13 hour drive with my father and three cats and it was the best drive of my life back to safety and freedom. My ex paid for my shit to be shipped to my new state. 

Now I’m 30, divorced, thriving, and free. I have a house, a solid career as an armed security officer, a growing art business, a published book, great friends, and a loving family I’m close with again. I still carry debt from that abusive marriage — about $8k — but I’m working through it.

I made it out. And I refuse to believe that rebuilding isn’t possible.

Enter My Current Relationship

Three years ago, while I was still healing, I met a man online. One of the first things he said to me was:

> “I’m in the hospital dying right now, but I’ll recover. Nice to meet you — and I get it if you’re not interested.”

That humor, that bold honesty — it drew me in.

We talked for months, slowly and meaningfully. He never pressured me, never love-bombed me. It felt safe. Like oxygen.

He supported me through the hardest moments of my life. He was there through Discord calls while I gray-rocked my ex, while I went to court, while I rebuilt my identity. He was my anchor.

When I finally escaped and got my divorce, I called my boyfriend crying. He has been there for me every step of the way. I remember getting in my car to get a chicken sandwich from Wendy's and a chocolate frosty.  Best post divorce meal. 

And for a long time, it was beautiful.


---

The Present

He’s 34 now. He has hemophilia, severe dental issues, and depression. He lives with his parents. He’s capable of working, even from home — but doesn’t.

Depression has turned him inward and bitter. The man who once helped me find my confidence has lost his own. He stays up all night gaming, has no consistent goals, and rarely follows through on anything.

His excuse for not visiting me? “I don’t want you sitting next to someone with a rotten mouth.”

I told him, “I don’t care about your teeth. I just want to see you.”

But love can’t fix laziness, self-pity, or a lack of drive. His own family is starting to give up on him — and I’m starting to, too.

To want change isn’t a feeling. It’s a choice. And he’s not choosing it.

He’s shown flickers of effort lately, and I’ll give him that. But I fear that if I leave now, those sparks will die out — and he’ll sink deeper. I’ve been honest with him about that fear.

He asks me for blind trust. But I’ve learned never to give that again.

He apologizes for “disappointing me,” promises to “work harder”… but my spark is fading.

We still laugh, game, and share beautiful moments. But it’s not enough anymore. I want a life, not just a screen. I want love that shows up. I want flowers more than once a year. I want a partner who builds a future beside me, not one who watches from the couch.

He says, “Just because you don’t see it doesn’t mean it’s not happening.”

But I’ve been alive long enough to know when something isn’t.


---

The Good Stuff (Because He Deserves It)

He is so smart. This man could literally figure out anything. HES LIKE A WALKING CHAT GBT. He's great at teaching. He's really good at video games. He's helpful. He's talented. He's kind. He feels safe. He's so quick and funny with his thoughts, it's one of the biggest reasons I fell in love with him. He makes me laugh. It's simple. 

And a little NFSW  info for you kinksters, tell me how online sex has been better with him than most of my irl sexual experiences? Someone make that make sense to me cause I'm still fucking tripping about it. This dude can make me finish 10 times in like 30 minutes. Lovense is great my Dear Guests. Check it out if you havent. Life changing for online relationships.  #LovenseSponserMe JUST KIDDING. (But like - why not? )

Anyways. I light up when I talk about him because honestly it always stumped me. ""How can someone so smart be so destructively lazy""

But none of that can cover up what’s missing: drive. And that lack of drive is killing us.

I can feel myself becoming frustrated and bitter — someone I promised myself I wouldn’t be again.

The Crossroads

So here I am, laying it all out.

How do you walk away from someone you truly love — someone who’s been good to you — when they’ve stopped being good for you?

Do you think:

1. I’m falling in love with potential, and it’s time to walk away?
or


2. I’m being impatient and should give him the time and trust he once gave me?

Because I honestly don’t know anymore if I’m trauma-bonded… or self-sabotaging.

Thanks for listening, Brain Chat. Hope my noggin' was somewhat warm and your coffee/tea was even warmer. 

I’m open to your thoughts, stories, and advice.

1or6ve8,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1or6ve8/the_destiny_3_of_my_dreams/,The Destiny 3 of my DREAMS,"Destiny 3

This past few months have been a dark time for destiny fans. Sentiment has been at all time low and its because of that I've been daydreaming. Daydreaming of a better tomorrow or in this case of Destiny 3. I've been writing out this for a few days and its a mix of a new story and some gameplay things. So it might sound like a bunch of ramblings but I wanted to post this cause I thought it was cool.

This is the Destiny 3 from my dreams.

So I'd start the game in three big missions. I'd start the game with the history of the traveler and humanity's discovery of it. The traveler going through our main enemies and allies that it interacted it before it reaching us on Mars. Then we would see a prime golden age earth and we hear how lifespans tripled, the advances in technology, and so on. We would then cut to deep space. The empty vastness speckled with infinite stars. The Pyramid fleet slowly grows from the horizon approaching the solar system.

We would then see a sort of conference room in the theme of the pyramid architecture. The only being standing in the room being a large alien draped in blue surround by holograms of firstly the witness, the disciples of the witness that we know, and a few more that we never seen before. \[ I was inspired by Dima Goryainov, the Bungie Senior Art Lead's post on Artstation [https://www.artstation.com/artwork/oJw46B](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/oJw46B) \] They're discussing how near they're are to the Final Shape and their plans. The meeting ends all leave except for a few. These few disciples would be our main villains for the next few years. A new darkness pantheon.

\[As to why these disciples weren't with the Witness in Final Shape. I'm going with that the Nine time traveled them after the collapse so the Witness just assumed they were defeated by the Traveler when it pushed back at the end of the collapse.\]

Then the scene cuts to golden age Chicago. The sprawling cityscape, beautiful vistas of the lake and it's piers. The camera starts to settle towards a small coffee shop and you hear conversations as you get closer. After that it puts you in first person in the coffee shop, cup in hand. There's a new broadcast that can be heard faintly in the background and you can barely make out something about an object making its way to earth, but its just background noise to most of the shop's patrons. You get up and go out for a stroll to a nearby park with a view of lake Michigan. You settle on a bench and as you stare out into the distance one of the Pyramids jumps into the sky above Chicago.

Hive and dread drop pods rain from the pyramid and other smaller pyramids shock jumps into the city. You gain control of the character and you start running. The whole situation has everyone screaming and in panic. You duck away from the park and off the main street through alleyways until you hear a police officer directing people into the subway. You head in there and find other survivors and make friends with a child and their mother who share their supplies.

You sit down to rest for a while until sometime later you hear some shouting and gunfire. The area is quickly swarmed by the flying dread crawling on the wall and through the air trying to get at all the survivors. You run out back into the city and its destruction. You try to duck down again into the alleyways and buildings to escape your pursuers. You find a pistol next to a fallen police officer. You find yourself cornered on to a pier on lake Michigan. You try to fight back but quickly run out of ammo and become cornered at the end of the pier. Just as you are finally out places to run near the water the enemies stop in front of you and bow. Behind you a ship opens and reveals a tall dread dressed in blue, the one from the cutscene on the ship. He looks at you and says something in a language you don't understand. He raises a glaive/spear and stabs you with it. Your vision begins to dim as he raises you into the sky and just as the light is about to fade from your eyes there's a earthquake from the far distance but its not an earthquake. Its the Traveler making its stand. You feel your body drop and you look up and see no one. The Nine moved the blue disciple but we wouldn't this at this point. Your vision finally fades and you fall to the darkness.

You are presented with your Destiny 2 characters or just the option to pick one of the classes if you don't have a Destiny 2 account. After choosing one you are thrusted to the Destiny 2 tower with a subtitle that says after the collapse. The tower is full of commotion just like any other day until your character is called in. There's an emergency. The game snaps back to a first person view of the balcony staring out into the Last City. Ghost mentions that Zavala and Ikora is summoning you. You make your way down meeting all sorts of allies that we gotten throughout the years of Destiny 2. When we finally reach the door to the room it opens to all of the leaders of the allies we have. They all look very serious while they discuss something. A discussion that ends immediately as you enter the room. They quickly inform you that they detected a Pyramid ship that has arrived at the very edge of the system and the coalition has decided they wont wait till it reaches Earth. The guardian and their allies are told they are to going to head off the Pyramid fleet before it can get any closer. You run through the tower and as you do you see several ships leave the atmosphere. From Cabal to Eliksni to Humanity to the Awoken.  All the allies of humanity are called into this battle. You pass by numerous nervous civilians asking whats going on but ghost assures them that everything will be fine. They have you after all. You finally reach the hanger where a special ship is awaiting you. A new hanger master is there to greet you with Banshee. They say that your going to love the modifications that they done. So you approach the ship and interact.

The game loads you into orbit and matchmakes you into a 6 player fireteam. When it finishes your POV switches from the classic orbit screen to right behind the ship. Where then Ghost tells you to hit the warp drive and a prompt comes up. When you come out of warp speed you are presented the stars and dark of deep space. The view pans from center to the left and right as five other guardians drop next to you along with your other allies. That's when the sharp edges of the pyramid begins to appear in the distance and Zavala orders the attack. The HUD appears on your screen and you are given full control of the ship. You start firing at the first wave of fighters that are deployed from the pyramid. Eventually you notice that the big pyramid is moving, trying to get past you so you have to find a way to stop it. You begin an assault on the main Pyramid to board it. Your main weapon laser or missiles don't work so Ghost directs you to weak points where you can channel your light to fire a prismatic missile from your ship. Finally you make an opening in the ship where you can board. You fight off a few more elite ships before boarding.

Your guardian wields the prismatic subclass. Your ghost directs you towards the leader is most likely is. Along the way Ghost notes traces of dread beasts that they haven't encountered before. The drifter urges you to be careful because of something familiar he's encountered before. You push on slaying dread after dread until you find yourself in a throne room. The room is decorated in a crystalline deep blue. And you see someone sitting in a huge chair. It's the tall blue dread from the end of the first section in golden age Chicago. He greets you and laments he could not be there with the witness when you defeated it, he's been watching you or at least learning about you. You begin a boss fight with it but just as soon as you get some headway a huge dark beast attacks you from the side and drains your abilities. Ghost even seems a little drained when speaking to you. Drifter chimes in to tell you its a light drinker beast and for you to run. Those monsters are something he encountered in his past that could drain the light but as you turn to leave another light drinker beast appears at the door you entered. Then from the shadows of the room eyes gaze at the guardian. They been in the room with you the whole time. A cutscene starts where the guardian valiantly puts up his last stand using all the powers of the class that they can but ultimately your left without the light. Ghost gives you another boost but eventually the beasts overwhelm you. You and the ghost overcharges you one last time to damage the blue dread and the Pyramid ship in half. Meanwhile in all this time the Pyramid reached Earth's atmosphere just outside of old Chicago and the halves crash into the outskirts of the city.

The guardian wakes up and tries to fend off the giant light drinker beast but it approaches and siphons off you and your ghost's light. The Guardian clutches Ghost's shell in their hand as the blue dread walks over to them. The blue disciple of the witness gives a great speech where he commends you and understands how you defeated the Witness. He is honored to be the being that slays you and finishes the guardian piercing your body with his lance.

We cut to the title screen, Destiny 3. Where all players are directed to create a new guardian. After we cut to a black screen with a time skip in the corner. It's been 5 years since the defeat of the Destiny 2 guardian. You see old Chicago but now taken over by the dread. I would make the dread act a little like orcs from the Lord of the Rings, pushing civilians around and laughing at their general suffering. Civilians cowering as their new masters ordering them around. The narration tells us that after the initial battle the blue dread assumed control of old Chicago and started a campaign to rule over earth. Similar to the warlords of the dark age. He is now known as the Blue King. You get the notion that instead of hasting the universe to a final shape these new dread have decided to become conquerors. We cut to a family bowing to dread passing by them. After confirming that the dread were gone, one of the traveler's ghost appears out of the jacket of one of the children. It gives what seems to be a nod and the player assumes control. You search through old Chicago trying to find a person that could save the people from the dread. You recognize the streets from the when you were playing the golden age version of Chicago and make your way towards the person you were playing in the beginning.

When you arrive at the pier you find your skeleton and your ghost speaks. ""There you are"" \[Voiced by none other than Jen Taylor, just kidding but imagine though.\] The scene cuts to black and you hear the muffled voice of your ghost. It explains who you are similar to Destiny 1. It gets cut off though as a dread patrol passes by and it disappears. It explains that you're in the territory of the blue dread now calling himself a king and he is not fond of light bearers. Your ghost leads you back to the encampment with the rest of the inhabitants of old Chicago where they basically live under the rule of the king. They explain that most of the guardians are stuck defending the Last City. The Blue King has been trying to get into the city for years. As you get to know the people you find a group of fighters that you escape with and form a resistance. Among them Suraya Hawthorne, who was there setting up old chicago as a new home for humanity before the invasion.

The map is similar to Destiny Rising in where you have a safe zone and you can go out into the open world but obviously much larger, large enough to include a lot of the city and the area outside of the city. Your task is to explore old Chicago and the area around to recruit people to your cause. Sometimes you find refugees who escape just you or you have to go in the city and rescue prisoners of the Blue King. Basically upgrade your home base with people and buildings to go to war with the King. People like Suraya, gunsmiths, maybe even the drifter. So you go around collecting supplies and doing missions around the map, slowly getting used to your light bearer powers. After some while you can do a mission where you can attack a base to gain territory and move up in world tiers. As a part of each area you have to trap and defeat one of the dread light drinker beast or another boss to be able to thin down the danger to you. One particular mission almost goes wrong and you almost lose an ally, Hawthorne. She's hasn't gotten story in a while so this would be a great way to expand her character maybe make her a little more patient.

I'd use the world tiers to put changes in the environment and add different missions to areas you already been. Throughout the game you also work on constructing communications and a ship to get help from the Last City. You eventually find out that the King has been attacking the Last City so you're not likely to get help. So every once in a while you go out and do a strike to weaken his hold. You go in on your ship destroying key locations around the Last City and defeat generals sometimes in the air with your ship that you would be putting together. Other times on the ground in a gunfight. Until finally the King is forced to retreat to his Pyramid turned castle.

The Vanguard/Last City is finally able to assist us and tells us whats been happen since the original invasion. They had started making other places for humanity outside of the Last City when the new threat arrived.  The Blue King arrived out of the wreckage and offered one term of peace. Serve or die. Thus began a war that has lasted since. The Blue King started his kingdom out of his broken pyramid converting it into a castle and began his conquest. At first it was an even fight but eventually the dread's numbers pushed back the Vanguard to the Last City. So a lot of humanity and its allies was outside the Last City but they were pushed back into the Last City, having to leave behind civilians. This where they been stuck for years. One of their hail Mary plans was to send an unpartnered ghost to see if they could get a guardian on the outside among others.

I want make it clear that while you are a guardian you have some hesitancy with working with the vanguard. There would be a mission where you find survivors but the vanguard wont take them cause they're low on resources so you have to take them back to your camp. There would be other things like how they handled their retreat but the point would be to separate the d3 guardian from the vanguard. There's obviously characters that would never leave people behind and those characters would most likely be outside of the city defending their own settlement.

So at this point with the help of the vanguard gives you details of an exotic fighter ship and weapons to retrieve. This would be our first beginner dungeon. It would be matchedmade and fairly simple. With access to the Last City, you're sent to a secret ship factory that contains the ship you're looking for. It was originally being prepared for the Destiny 2 guardian but the attack caught them by surprise. The one you wielded in the intro of the game was a prototype and this one was the finished product. You traverse the factory trying to stop rogue Fallen trying to get this ship. The encounters would have you reach the facility, bypass the security, enter a simulation and proving you are fit to fly, and finally fighting off the boss that was attempting to steal the exotic ship.

With this new ship in your arsenal you finally begin the final battle. The skies of old Chicago are filled with smaller pyramids and elite fighter pilots.  You and the everyone else fight till you can reach the castle. There you invade the pyramid turned castle and take on a final general. Inside you see the empty cages for all the light drinker beasts you defeated and one particularly big cage to one you haven't faced yet. You arrive at the throne room where the Blue King speaks. He's surprise that you were able to defeat his army when so many couldn't. Obviously it was cause you were doing hit and run strikes. He also senses something familiar about you but quickly brushes it aside and picks up his lance and shield and you do battle.

At first he approaches you slowly, bashing and stabbing stoically if you get too close. Occasionally he dashes at you with his lance. Eventually when you bring him to half health and he drops the shield. He starts to get angry about you ruining his carefully laid out plans and rushing you more often and slashing with his lance. As you near the end of his health his attacks keep becoming more ferocious. When you get his health to around 5 percent he drops his lance and reaches for a giant shuriken on his back. All his health returns for a second phase.

From behind the throne a large light drinker beast emerges to join the fight and the Blue King retreats to throw his shuriken from up high. You use the experience from fighting all the other light drinker beast to take it down while dodging the Blue King's shuriken throws. Eventually the Blue King comes down and joins the attack with the beast until you defeat both of them. The Blue King is furious at this point and erupts/transforms into a vaguely werewolf form and revealing his final health bar. You're out of ammo at this point and your ghost suggest for you to use your light on one of the weapons that the Blue King dropped. Your guardian depending on your class grabs the shield \[Titan\], lance \[Warlock\], shuriken \[Hunter\] and unlocks new melees and supers.

The Titan uses this new shield more like a ram/drill. Where they rushes in shielded and spins on contact. The Warlock wields a lance where they fly up kind of like a Valkyrie and crash down and explode. The hunter uses a giant shuriken that when thrown bounces around several times then detonates.

When you get around five percent of his health he starts to tire out is overwhelmed by his darkness beast powers and dies. You go to the room behind him and find the D2 guardian and their ghost. Although the Blue King was a tyrant, he still had great respect for the Destiny 2 guardian. You bring them home to be laid to rest, but just as you turn to leave you see two new giant glowing pair of eyes, another light drinker beast but easily twice as big as the one larger one you fought. This was the one that took the destiny 2 guardian's light. It looks at its dead master and leaves towards the city, into the sewers of old Chicago. There would be a post-campaign quest where you would track it to the sewers to unlock the new raid.

But before all that you unlock the tower and meet all the characters that come with it. You'd unlock the pvp playlists, the portal \[to replay missions/strikes/future content for light level\]. You can still go into the open world of old Chicago to level but if you just wanted to use the portal to replay content that would be there.

As a nice sendoff for the d2 guardian, there will be a flower that you can pick at the edge of Lake Michigan in the open world. It'll start a quest where you would talk all the npcs that knew the guardian and end with a final cutscene of the d2 guardian and their ghost being laid to rest with, of course, the young wolf's howl. The speech that Saint-14 from Season of the Dawn would fit perfectly here mixing with the credits and Journey soundtrack from the red war.

Post-Campaign would have you gearing up to hunt the mother light drinker beast in the first raid of destiny 3, the Hunt for the Guardian Slayer.

At this point you could wander the open world at its hardest difficulty to keep leveling. Fighting world bosses with randoms on the map, finding secrets of old Chicago, or playing the playlists. And of course flying your fighter ship in space, both in a crucible setting and a pve gamemode.

Alright I'm mostly done but I wanted to put out some ideas that I couldn't fit in the main story/game.

1. The first DLC would have someone wish through riven's last egg/child that they wish they got to experience the great Ahamkara hunt. Obviously they wouldn't be true ahamkara's but close enough to cause problems. There would be factions that you would work with because you're not guardian of the last city. You prefer to work with the people than being a part of the vanguard. This would be how we would could get faction wars finally. This would all take place on Pluto terraformed by the wish into a battleworld with tons of loot and treasure. This DLC would end with a reveal of the second disciple. This dlc would have a new raid where you fight the strongest of the ahamkara.
2. There would exotics of course but I'd introduce new exotics that go into a new slot that changes your super and melee. That's what the three new supers would be from the end of the main quest. Things like a mech, scythes, a orbital laser, that strand minigun, flamethrower, and so on. Just a way to get new supers and abilities without having to invent a new subclass.
3. The second dlc would have the second disciple, or the new part of a new pantheon of darkness as I would call it, appear. I would have someone close to the guardian, maybe hawthorne, die by this new villain and send the guardian a dark road where they would gain a new darkness subclass. This new villain would be a buff aura farming menace. \[I was inspired by this reddit post of the witness. [https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/11t8hdd/woe\_the\_final\_shape\_be\_upon\_ye\_the\_fitness/](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/11t8hdd/woe_the_final_shape_be_upon_ye_the_fitness/) \] He would be someone just looking a challenge and took a interest in you. He basically has a coliseum ship where he fights the strongest he can find. We would get a new activity similar to the prison of elders where this new disciple would watch you fight and comment on your performance. He was sent forwards in time from the collapse too but way out of the galaxy/solar system so he had a long time to change his interest in the final shape. He's been watching since the Blue King's conquest on earth but has been trying to get back since the original collapse. Basically through this campaign you've been leaning towards the darkness and unlocking a new monster subclass. The titan would get a werewolf/beast form similar to the final form of the Blue King. Warlocks would get a reaper/necromancer form. Finally the hunter would get a vampire-like form that would see this new villain also turn into at the end of the campaign. I'd market this dlc as Unleash the Beast, lol.

The warlock darkness form would be a hint at another darkness pantheon member/disciple that be like a grim reaper but i haven't thought about how that would go. Maybe a dlc that leans into the space combat part of the game a bit more.

That's all I got for now. Let me know what you think.  I know this is all never happening but you never know some Bungie employee might read this and get inspired. So in case that ever happens, Bungie, make this game. I dont want any money, any credit, I just want this game. lol",0,1762550938.0,DestinyTheGame,7,0.17,False

What draws me to coffee is the whole ritual and how it anchors my morning, but I can definitely find alternatives. I also enjoy the communal aspect of it, but again I can find ways around this.

My question is for those of you who currently minimize caffeine to zero, does any amount of caffeine negatively affect you? Suppose you have a decaf on occasion, do you notice and/or feel it(good or bad)? Perhaps you eat a whole chocolate bar? 

For context I have one large cup of coffee per day, usually 2 hours after I wake up, that is made with half decaf and half regular. It is going pretty well for the most part, but I do want to get down to zero or close to it. Perhaps I need to stay away from decaf and chocolate too.

1or6nka,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1or6nka/aita_for_causing_tension_with_the_bride/,AITA for causing tension with the bride?,"About a year ago, my close friend, we’ll call him Paul, asked me to be one of his groomsmen for his wedding. I was ecstatic to be invited and was happy for him, despite not knowing his bride Abby that well.

A few months pass and Paul approaches me, telling me that Abby would like it if I were to cut my hair cause it’s pretty long. (I feel like it’s important to give the context I’m a dude) and the reasoning I was given was that Abby “doesn’t want her bridesmaids walking down the aisle with a dude with long hair.” I laughed this off and said I wasn’t gonna do it, and Paul said he’d talk to Abby about it some more.

Months pass by, and Paul informs me I pretty much HAVE to cut my hair short since it’s a “formal event”. Begrudgingly I go along with it but Paul is atleast nice enough to pay for the haircut. It’s a lot shorter than I’d like but it definitely could be worse.

Day of the wedding rolls around, I put on the suit I had to pay a good amount of money to rent (it’s like $270 I don’t actually know if that’s a lot to rent a suit but I don’t make a ton of money rn) and I’m super out of it. I’ve been off my meds for the duration of this trip since I’m visiting for this wedding, and I knew there would be lots of drinking so I decided to stay off of em. Admittedly bad idea on my part to do that.

I get a bit overwhelmed with everything and step outside to try and relax, turns out this stresses out the bridesmaid and bride as I’m chilling by myself outside. I can’t really understand why but I guess it’s just a general vibe of I’m “checked out” of the wedding.

Then I learn that I have the wrong socks on for the wedding. I got loafer socks thinking that would be good for this but apparently I needed black socks and that stressed a lot of people in the bridal party out as they scrambled to get me some black socks. I looked through messages n stuff and didn’t find ANYTHING on needing black socks but apparently that’s just something that’s common sense?

The ceremony starts and I see despite being the shortest member of the groomsmen I’m on the very end which sucks, but I’m atleast walking down the aisle with someone I know. The ceremony goes fine despite the fact I can’t see past the other titanic groomsmen infront of me but it’s whatever it ain’t a big deal.

After the ceremony we all walk to the bridal changing room and everyone is hugging eachother. I decide to go for a hug to Abby to congratulate her and she walked right past me to hug the person behind me. At this point it’s pretty clear she doesn’t like me very much, this is compounded by the fact she hasn’t spoken to me at all during day of rehearsal or day of the wedding. We actually went the entire day without her talking to me.


After their honeymoon, we meet up over coffee, and Paul wants me to apologize to Abby. I eventually settle on “You can tell her I’m sorry, but I really am not understanding what all I did wrong.” I just wanna get some unbiased opinions if I’m being a huge d-bag

1or6klc,https://www.reddit.com/r/relocating/comments/1or6klc/relocating_from_appalachia_best_for_a_solo_fresh/,Relocating from Appalachia - best for a solo fresh start?,"Hi! I'm planning to move from a small town in Virginia, and would like some location suggestions. I traveled in a van for a while with a goal to get across the U.S., But it broke down midway through, so only got about halfway. Instead of visiting somewhere, I'd like to just take the leap. I'll be moving alone- no family, relationship, children, so distance doesn't matter from this point. I'm also considering the price and availability of one bedrooms, studios, etc. I know it's more expensive and harder to find, but anyone have ideas for a solo fresh start? 


I'm looking for somewhere that's: 
- closer to a bigger city
- a hub for arts and entertainment. I write books, sing, dance, and need to find more creative people in a community
- work wise, I also want to be somewhere that has more entrepreneurs if that makes sense? I've been working on a business, am always open to jobs and projects, especially in Sales and Science 
- also has opportunities for activism. Right now, I drive at least 30 miles to get anywhere to meet with certain groups or go to events and it's not sustainable 
- nature around - am ok with driving to any trails, waterfalls, parks. 
- more queer friendly, or at least a level up of from small town prejudice 


It would also be really nice if somewhere: 
- has more walkability for movement and air
- is close proximity to or on a coastline or shorter distance to the ocean 
- warm or at least not cold 24/7
- actually good coffee 
- antiques and places of history would also be a plus 

I'd like to leave the U.S. in the future, so I'm open to suggestions from anywhere. But that was the later plan, so I'd prefer to explore here before leaving. Lived in Charlotte, NC and liked a lot of aspects of it. I survived a hurricane in FL, so weather honestly isn't as much of a concern. traffic sucks in larger areas, but car concerts are normal anyway. And cost of living is an issue everywhere, but would also rather pay for somewhere that feels more enjoyable and aids in those goals. I'm researching a few areas, but I'm curious what y'all think. 

With my hodge podge list, do any places come to mind?

They're constantly being fought over by coffee makers, air fryers, and a whole host of gadgets that promised to change our lives but now just collect dust. For a long time, I resisted the mini waffle maker trend, assuming it was another one of those single-use novelties.

I was wrong.

After finally caving and getting one, I can say without a doubt that this little powerhouse is the most underrated gadget in my kitchen. It’s not just for making tiny, adorable waffles (though it does that perfectly). It’s a tiny, versatile workhorse that solves a lot of common kitchen frustrations. If you're on the fence, let me break down why a mini waffle maker might just become your new favorite thing.

---

## More Than Just a One-Trick Pony

The biggest mistake people make is thinking this is only a waffle machine. The magic of the mini waffle maker is that it's essentially a tiny, fast-heating, dual-sided griddle. Once you start thinking of it that way, a world of possibilities opens up.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://govacation.pages.dev//?q=mini%20waffle%20maker)

Think beyond the breakfast syrup and consider these uses:

-   **Grilled Cheese & Paninis:** A perfectly melty, crispy-edged single-serving sandwich is just minutes away. No need to haul out a big panini press.
-   **Hash Browns:** Press leftover or refrigerated hash brown patties in here for an incredibly crispy exterior and fluffy inside. It's a game-changer for a quick breakfast side.
-   **Cinnamon Roll ""Waffles"":** Place a refrigerated cinnamon roll segment in the maker. It cooks it into a gooey, crisp-edged treat that’s ready for icing in minutes.
-   **""Chaffles"":** For the keto and low-carb crowd, this is a staple. A simple mix of egg and cheese bakes into a delicious, bread-like waffle perfect for sandwiches or topping.
-   **Brownies & Cookies:** Pour in a small amount of brownie or cookie batter for an individual dessert with perfectly crispy edges and a soft center.
-   **Pizza Bites:** Press a piece of dough into the iron, top with sauce, cheese, and toppings, and close the lid. A personal pizza in minutes.
-   **Quesadillas:** A folded tortilla with cheese is all you need for a crunchy, cheesy snack.

## The Charm of Compact: What Makes It So Special?

So it's versatile, but what else makes the mini waffle maker so special? It comes down to a few key things that address real-world cooking annoyances.

### ### Blazing Fast

We're talking preheated and ready to go in two or three minutes, and most things cook in another three to five. While your big oven is still thinking about warming up, you can already have a hot snack on a plate. This speed is perfect for impatient mornings, after-school snacks, or late-night cravings.

### ### Effortless Cleanup

This is arguably its best feature. The non-stick cooking surface is incredibly effective. Most of the time, a simple wipe with a paper towel while it's still warm is all it takes to clean it. There's no soaking, no scrubbing, and no disassembly required. It makes cleanup so painless that you'll actually want to use it.

### ### Perfectly Portioned

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://govacation.pages.dev//?q=mini%20waffle%20maker)

Cooking for one? The mini waffle maker is your best friend. It eliminates food waste and the temptation to overeat by creating perfect single servings. It's also fantastic for families with picky eaters—everyone can have their own custom-made waffle, panini, or hash brown patty, cooked exactly how they like it.

### ### Tiny Footprint, Huge Impact

Unlike bulky specialty appliances, most mini waffle makers are about the size of your hand. They can be stored upright in a cabinet or even tucked away in a drawer. This small footprint means it doesn't have to live on your counter, but its sheer convenience might just make you want it to.

## A Few Things I Wish I’d Known Sooner

To help you get the most out of yours from day one, here are a couple of quick pro-tips I picked up:

1.  **Less is More:** You don't need a lot of batter. A spoonful or two is plenty. Overfilling is the only way you'll make a mess, as it will ooze out the sides.
2.  **Trust the Non-Stick:** After the very first use (where a quick spritz of oil is a good idea), you usually don't need to add any extra butter or spray. The surface is designed to be release-friendly on its own.
3.  **Experiment with Leftovers:** Got leftover mashed potatoes? Form them into a patty and press them in the waffle maker for a crispy potato cake. Leftover stuffing from a holiday meal? Same thing. It’s a brilliant way to give new life to leftovers.

## So, Is It Actually Worth It?

If you couldn't already tell, my answer is a resounding **yes**. The mini waffle maker isn't just another fad gadget. It’s a genuinely useful, incredibly convenient tool that delivers on its promise of speed, simplicity, and versatility.

It's one of those rare purchases that makes you wonder how you ever lived without it. If you're looking for a small, affordable way to add a lot of fun and function to your kitchen, the mini waffle maker is one of the best investments you can make.",1,1762550085.0,WaffleNationHQ,0,1.0,False

What can I do?","Hi all, 31F here! I’ve built a solid nonprofit career and have always been a high performer in hybrid/remote roles with clear metrics.

I joined my current org in Oct 2024 to learn major gifts, sponsorships, and grants. The job was supposed to include:

* Manage the women’s auxiliary group
* Re-launch the young professionals’ group (with a major fundraiser in 2026)
* Lead major gift asks for North Texas Giving Day (NTGD)
* Oversee a two-week third-party event
* Run an end-of-year giving campaign
* ""Other duties as assigned""

Since starting, almost everything has shifted:

* **No fundraising growth.** Leadership cut NTGD goals by 25%, so I wasn’t allowed to do major asks and revenue dropped accordingly.
* **No sponsorships.** I was told to wait until *2028* (four years in!) to organize the young professionals' fundraiser.
* **Scope creep.** I now handle admin for a third auxiliary group (a 50+ group that I can't serve as the relational lead ""because of my age"") in exchange for ownership of my end-of-year giving campaign despite repeated asks to not lose a fundraising metric.
* **Networking is policed.** I need VP/CEO approval for any outreach to organize a coffee/lunch meeting with industry peers.
* **Metrics stripped.** I can track event attendance and dues but am not to know the market value of in-kind donations I help to secure or additional funding made possible through my networking.
* **Zero support.** Leadership regularly ignores requests for collaboration or prep before events I’m measured on.

After voicing frustration, my VP asked me to complete a **task tracker** to show how I spend my time. I declined, saying it’s my busiest season and asked instead for clarity on priorities and where I can set boundaries to keep my work quality high. I’ve since learned this same tracker was used for a colleague as a *soft PIP* before they left.

At this point, I know I need to get out — but I’m trying to cover myself and plan the exit right.

**Questions:**

1. What should I do now to protect myself if declining the tracker backfires?
2. Is there a smart way to stay long enough to gain something from this job without burning out or being set up?
3. How do I explain this “career slide” in interviews without sounding defensive?

**TL;DR:** Hired to grow in fundraising. Leadership removed measurable work, gave me admin tasks, and micromanages everything. Now they’ve asked me to do a “task tracker” that’s a soft PIP. What’s my next move?",1,1762550082.0,careeradvice,0,1.0,False

I ‘M30’ have been with my partner ‘30F’ for 8 years. Our relationship has been deteriorating in the past few years and h th is year has already brought its challenges. Fair to say that we have communicated openly, however I can’t stop but think I have acted past the talk. 

The past few months have been a challenge for me emotionally and mentally. And I spoke openly about it to her. Especially, we’ve discussed about my love languages (physical touch and words of affirmation) and hers (quality time and acts of service). I have done my part (she also confirms generally) of adopting and showing up for the relationship. I had been available during her most lows (even where her family wasn’t around or involved). She recently got into a might-be losing a job situation and I gave up important stuff from my end, like studying for my bar exam, and being there for her. I genuinely don’t regret these but I do get a lot anxiety/stress on what if I failed the bar again(this is my 3rd time taking .) I further indebted myself because she has this new way of thinking that I as a man should be making her life easier, so I honestly took the decision to do these, I won’t say that I was pushed. So, dinners out, coffee dates, driving her around, really doing my part of showing up in the relationship. 

For my end, we’ve not had intimacy for 8 months. Which really plays in my physical touch. I had later agreed to this given our issues. So I didn’t really fight it but I do communicate how this has been affecting me in the relationship. Next, the past months have all been about her, and her plans. So the words of affirmation part also was neglected. I have communicated with her multiple times that I would appreciate sometimes you know a “I miss you can’t wait to see you” and all of this while she’s on a trip personal/worked-related on in Brazil. All I got was just dismiss, rejection, you are too needy. I remind her that we communicated and discussed this, that you should do your part to show up for us. I recently literally got into a mental breakdown, and I was in need of speaking to someone and especially my significant other.. that phone finished with her hanging up with a bye, and I called her back like 8 times and she had gone off her phone. All this while she’s in Brazil. Instead of showing up when I most need her (all of this related to my mental wellbeing, bar school, emotional neglect). Rather most times we talk she prefers talking about her stuff, or always asking for her for her things. Things like I did x, I am applying to this job (and surprised I once found out she’s looking for a job in Dubai without telling, and she was like I rather tell you when things are concrete…). I really got hurt to know about this by myself rather than her telling me. 

I spoken numerous times that we should have a teamwork mindset! We are in this together, and we openly discuss our needs and we need to show up for us in the relationship if not, things will fade away. The constant unavailabliktiy (especially every time I have my bar exams, it’s been a coincidence that she travels), the constant travelling, the building up neglect for my love languages. Recently she was due to flight back in Canada. She calls up her family to try to pick her up at 6 am, they all said no. Mind you I had offered to do this, but because I told her to show up for us you know do the part of my love language, it might have dissuaded her. She later then asks me after her family.

My intentions with her were to get married. But this kind of situation scares me. Someone not showing up for us. I would love to hear your thoughts and apologize in advance for my unlinear scattered thoughts. ",3,1762549924.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

I met him in the gym, he asked my ig when we were leaving - it happened we left at the same time that day. it was on Thursday, on Friday we saw each other in the gym and he walked me home, Sunday was a first actual date - he started to get touchy and I didn’t mind. He tried to kiss me and then apologised for it because I wasn’t ready. i told him later that day, in messages that we’re not going to gym together as we planned to because I didn’t feel good after our date. Idk I just knew something wasn’t right. The next day we met at gym, it was quite cold and he didn’t even say bye. Yet we met on Wednesday for coffee, and the rest of the week was weird. We were really touchy, even though I did not mind I came home every time and I felt used. I slowly got cold towards him, then he told me he really likes me in texts. He said he never felt anything like this to a girl (he was shaking when we met, mind you I’m 18 he’s 23). I thought that’s weird and sounds to cliche, like a typical manipulation tactic. He said he’s ready to wait no knowing if I will ever like him. I said it’s okay and that I’m not comfortable with how touchy we are. The next time we saw each other he was just as touchy, I noticed it.. but idk, I ate that up because I liked it. I know I should’ve noticed this and see this huge red flag, I know. So the next week everything was really good. At that time I thought I didn’t like him that much (now I think I didn’t feel sae enough to accept it and didn’t wanna move forward). The day things changed. It was my first day of period, he was walking me home, and left half way leaving me at the park - I felt really lonely and made a big deal out of it for myself, but said nothing, he said he needed to go to work. I felt really bad physically, told him about it later that day on messages, he said you’re too dramatic. I cried (i;m sorry if anyone thinks I’m drama queen). The nest 3 days I was really cold and we didn’t see didn’t meet, until on Thursday I said we better stop communicating. Month later he unfollowed, but kept watching stories. And then this week, I noticed he blocked me on telegram - idk why because we were not chatting or communicating. It was a month after we stopped talking (2 weeks to be precise bc I texted him to say sorry for treating him so badly the past few days we talked)



He’s a foreigner in my country, older and more experienced than me, different mentality.

Guys just tell me whatever you think because I’m trying to process it, ive trying to for a very long time and I need some outside perspective.

When I was younger, a new category of relationship emerged: ""ficar"" (literal translation: stay; would be the same of ""situationship""). People who would hang out here and there, make out, but not having an actual relationship. Nowadays, there are all kind of categories of relationships, going from ""ficar sério"" (""serious situationship"", which means you just hang out with that person, but it's still not a relationship, for some reason) to ""conversante"" (someone you just chat with, with no intentions of meeting and developing anything). It's ridiculous. And then, going to MSM community, it's just hook-ups.

Now, I'm not saying how special I am, and how I'm such a gem of a person, who gets constantly rejected by those bad people. I just want *a date*. Why is asking for a coffee *so much*? Why people *can't deal* with this? And like, I'm not even exaggerating, those are really how people react and responses I had have to when I'm trying to take someone out for some time together to know each other. ""You're too caring"". ""You're too mature"". People act as if there's only hook-up and marriage, absolutely nothing in between. You either just want to fuck or spend your whole life with them.

It's so frustrating. I wish I didn't feel like a piece of shit with hook-ups. I've tried them already and I can't deal with it: I either can't have a boner or get attached.

And don't even tell me about dating apps, those are the worst. And I'm not even talking about how dating apps work against you, by making you spend time and money on them, I'm really talking about people there. I've already seen people using it on public transportation, and they will literally swipe *everyone* right and check the profile after the match - and that's when they decide if they like you or not. Tinder, Bumble, Inner Circle, Happn, Bumpy, Boo, you name it, that's how people use it here.

I really feel that I'm just being alone for the rest of my life. Sometimes it's easier to accept that, sometimes it hurts, sometimes it just gets on my nerves like today and I start fuming about it. ",1,1762549780.0,LGBTForeverAlone,0,0.6,False

1or6d1m,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1or6d1m/service_is_sorely_lacking/,Service is sorely lacking,"I won’t go into whether Nespresso is “good”, that’s a subjective thing. It wasn’t for me, but I wouldn’t presume to say those who like it are wrong. I’m just going to talk about their service, or lack thereof.

Ordered a new Virtuoso bundle with the frother. Ordered some assorted coffees. Got a pod drawer, and even got some descaling kits. $430 of what I was hoping was going to be coffee goodness. Order shows up, half of the items are missing. Customer service call, 2nd replacement order setup. Before the 2nd half of the order even arrives, already reached the decision that this isn’t for me. Tried 3 different coffees, none of them were palatable to me, no sense trying to “make” it taste good when you’re dropping good money so I contact them to setup a return and refund. Let insanity commence.

First Contact:
“You can’t return the unopened pods”. But your site says you can. “Ok, well you don’t need to return them, I’ll setup a full refund, just throw them away.” No case number or anything just random notice in my email from UPS with a label. Ok, pack it all up, ship it all back except for the coffee. Since refunds can take 30 days, I wait 32, nothing. We call them again.

Second Contact:
“Hmmmm…..you have a credit on your Nespresso account for xxxx”. Um, why would I want a credit on an account where I’m returning all of your stuff because I don’t like it? Oh, and that amount isn’t correct, that was just the machine. “No worries, I’ll get this credited back to your actual card with the correct amount.” 30 days later, have a credit back to my card but only for the machine.

Third Contact:
“Hmmmm, you had a reorder on your account”. That reorder was you sending out what you missed sending the first time. Everything but the coffee has been returned. “We don’t refund coffee”. Your site says you do and you were the ones who told me it would be refunded and to just throw it away. Lots of yak yak back and forth, finally credited back the remainder minus some of the coffee but after nearly 3 months, the sunk cost on my loss of productivity because I’m jacking with them is costing me more than all of this to begin with.

Bottom line, no return case numbers, nobody to touch back with if your return is jacked up, and nobody who seems to actually care about doing their job right the first or second time. All I can say is if you love their coffee, then fantastic, hope you never have an order or service issue because you’re screwed if you do. If you’ve never tried them but are thinking about it, then hopefully my experience adds into your calculations as to whether they’re worth trying. When it takes 3 calls to get it right, that’s not a one off, that’s systemic.

1or6av6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1or6av6,Meet Alyssa- the sunshine girl who hides her rain.,"Hey everyone! I’d love to introduce you to **Alyssa Joy MacLeod**, one of my original characters. She’s 19, from Pine Bluff, Arkansas — a red-haired burst of sunshine who can brighten anyone’s day without even trying.

Alyssa’s the girl who waves at passing dogs, skips when she walks, and gives everyone cute nicknames. She’s got **tiny fangs** that peek out when she smiles — her dentist teases her about them every visit — and she laughs it off, calling them her “built-in personality.” She’s always in her comfy **pink jeans, turquoise cardigan, and aqua sneakers**, humming or tapping her foot like she’s keeping time to a song no one else can hear.

Dancing has always been part of her — she took **ballet classes for years** and still spins gracefully when she’s happy, sometimes twirling in her kitchen just because the moment feels light enough. Her movements carry that dancer’s poise, even when she’s being her usual goofy, bubbly self.

But behind her sunshine is someone who carries a quiet ache. Alyssa feels like she has to keep others happy, even when she’s not. In her journal, she once wrote:

>

She never lets people see her break — not her parents, not her friends. But **Tessa**, her older sister, senses it. They know she’s not lost… just tired. Deep down, Alyssa hopes someone will tell her, *“You don’t have to earn love — you already have it.”* 

  
**Quirks:**

* Has small fangs that make her smile uniquely charming (and her dentist’s favorite joke).
* Always walks on her toes — an old ballet habit she never lost.
* Keeps sticky notes with pep talks hidden in drawers and notebooks.
* Makes puns when she’s nervous or trying to lighten a tense moment.
* Can’t start her morning without apple juice — says coffee “takes itself too seriously.”

1or692y,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1or692y/rf_the_tablet/,[RF] The Tablet,"What if a once-a-day pill could make you healthy, but you could never eat again? 

(5900 words)



“Just once a day with only water? That’s it?” Sally asked and looked at Rachel.

Rachel blushed and rushed to answer. “Yeah, but it’s perfectly safe. They’ve been testing it for thirty years now.”

“Why have I never heard of it then?” Sally’s soft lips pressed against the wine glass as she took another sip.

“It’s one of those FDA things. They couldn’t publicize it for so long because of what they were promising. But they just announced it and said they came through the last round of approvals. It’s hitting the market next week. I dunno. I might try it.” Rachel tried to be as demure as Sally in her sipping, but a bit of red wine trickled down her chin. She immediately wiped it away and subtly scanned the table to determine if anyone had seen her. Sally had turned back to her plate of chicken piccata and was twirling a bit of house-made spaghetti on her fork.

Rachel looked down at her plate. The peppered salmon lying on a soggy lump of creamed spinach hadn’t tasted good, despite its menu description, and she regretted not going with the smothered steak she had initially wanted. She eyed the others’ plates and analyzed whether anyone was watching hers. Everyone else had finished at least half their food by now. Rachel had only taken a few bites. Most people at the table knew about her long-ago bariatric surgery, but judging by the confused looks she sometimes got at their food-related functions—not to mention her still-heavy frame—she was sure more than one person had forgotten by now.

Rachel turned to Sally, but she was engrossed in conversation with the friend on her left. Rachel looked to the right and across from her, but those friends were equally occupied. She sat in silence and pushed her spinach around the plate to make it look like she had eaten more before she could finally ask for a to-go box she would just throw away at home.

\#

Rachel’s knee bounced, and her thighs rubbed together uncomfortably under her dress as she waited for the doctor to enter the room. She’d been to the clinic for six appointments before this, and the testing process had been extensive—the blood tests, stress test, sleep study, MRI, and mental health assessments had been just the beginning. But getting this tablet was important enough to endure a few hurdles.

The door opened, and a handsome man entered the room. “Hello, Rachel, I’m Dr. Jhaveri. How are we doing today?” He only looked up from his laptop as he spoke his last question.

Rachel put on a smile. “I’m great. Excited to be here.”

“Excited?” Dr. Jhaveri raised an eyebrow as he closed the door and sat on the rolling stool.

“I just mean, I’m interested in getting started.”

“I understand,” he said, placing the laptop on the low counter and clicking through a few screens. “We’re very excited to have such interest in our little miracle.”

Rachel cringed. She hated that word. Too many “miracle” solutions had come before this. She didn’t need another miracle. She needed a result.

“What?” Dr. Jhaveri said as he looked up.

“I just . . . I thought this was a real solution.”

Dr. Jhaveri looked hurt. “I know *miracle* gets a bad rap in the health and diet community. But I mean it in a much broader sense. Just imagine it”—Dr. Jhaveri leaned forward and started gesturing—“A world without hunger. Being able to feed millions around the globe without the need to overfarm or overfish or raise cows that release methane into the air and kill our ozone. If everyone on the planet took our drug daily for just twenty years, the world’s oceans and farmlands could recover. And with the weight-stabilizing property, think of how many obesity-related conditions we could eradicate in that time. Not to mention the time it would save. No more grocery shopping, cooking, dishes. Don’t even get me started on the possibilities for long-distance space travel—”

He cut himself off and placed his hands in his lap. Rachel didn’t know what to say. She’d never thought of it that way. Compared to the global and future changes Dr. Jhaveri was mentioning, Rachel’s reasons for wanting the drug seemed insignificant.

“But anyway,” Dr. Jhaveri said, “that’s years, if not decades, in the future. First, we need interested participants like you.” He smiled.

Rachel bit her lip and nodded.

The next twenty minutes were filled with Dr. Jhaveri asking her questions and giving a long lecture on the social and mental side effects of never eating again. He reiterated for the fourth time how she would be a new breed of human, something the world wasn’t ready for. It would be an uphill battle.

As she listened, her brain was sarcastically repeating, *Yep, a real miracle*.

\#

Dr, Jhaveri had warned her that the first few days would be difficult. It would likely be a week before she should even be around food again, he had said. Rachel had prepared.

On her way to pick up her prescription from the clinic that morning, she had emptied the fridge, freezer, and pantry, tossing two bags of old and used food in the trash and carting the unopened items to a food bank. With the white paper bag in hand, she puffed a little as she climbed the single flight of stairs to her apartment.

Oreo met her at the door and rubbed against Rachel’s legs as she kicked off her shoes in the entryway. Rachel had loved the name at first, having been so perfect for a black cat with a white stripe down her back, but now it just made Rachel uncomfortable.

She plopped down on the couch and studied the container she pulled from the paper bag. It looked like a normal pill bottle, but Rachel knew the tablets inside were anything but ordinary. At least, she hoped so.

She reached over for her new water bottle. It had a timer and lights and was supposed to alert her every so often to take another sip. She had the timer currently set for ten minutes. She flipped the lid and cracked open the pill bottle.

The tablet that spilled into her palm was a pale green oval the size of a shelled pistachio with a big “M” imprinted on it. Rachel knew it stood for the makers of the tablet, but she couldn’t stop the word “Miracle” from flashing in her head.

“Bottoms up,” she raised her water bottle toward Oreo and swallowed her first tablet.

\#

Rachel could have sworn it had been ten hours, but her water bottle had only vibrated nine times, so it had definitely only been an hour and a half.

The bottle sprung to life with a soft beep and a blinking light, so Rachel took her next few sips of water. The indicator showed she had already had twenty-one ounces, which was a good start to the ninety ounces she was supposed to drink each day. With no food to fill her stomach, it should be easy enough to get that much fluid in daily. Well, water. All other fluids were off limits, they had told her.

She walked over to her refrigerator out of habit. She had unplugged it that morning and, just to stop her problem of mindlessly opening them, had handcuffed the doors together. The key was in the garbage with her rotted food. She was pretty sure the landlord wouldn’t be happy about that. But she’d figure that out whenever she ended up moving out.

Rachel considered what to do next. She had all Saturday and Sunday to adjust before she had to get back to work Monday. She took some deep breaths and set her jaw firm. She would be strong. She just needed to distract herself.

But despite her best efforts to stay away from food and drinks, it seemed to be everywhere. Turn on the TV—actors eating during scenes, commercials for sugary drinks, cooking shows, for god’s sake! Social media was no better. No matter how many times she down flagged a post or how many people she unfollowed, she would still get suggested posts for healthy recipes and local eateries.

Eventually, she started up some music, but when the algorithm decided to put “Banana Pancakes” from Jack Johnson on the mix, she gave up on that too. Finally, she grabbed a book but wanted to throw it across the room fifteen minutes later as the author detailed a lavish banquet at a New Year’s Eve party.

Was everything ruined now? Is this what she had signed up for? No, she calmed herself. She knew this was just the first day of no food, and she would eventually be able to interact with food and drinks in healthy ways without imbibing, just as Dr. Jhaveri had assured her. That would include going back to regular media.

For now, she decided she could use some motivation.

Rachel grabbed her water bottle and headed for the full-length mirror in her bedroom. She pulled off her T-shirt and bra and dropped her shorts and underwear to the floor. Standing there naked, she surveyed what she was doing it all for.

She stood close to the glass and stared at her face. She twisted her head left and right in the mirror. When she noticed a particularly long black hair sticking out of one mole on her cheek, she got her tweezers and plucked it. She continued this examination down the rest of her body, stopping at her pits, where ingrown hairs were making angry red hills, to her belly overhang, underneath of which was sweating profusely, to her toenails, which she desperately needed to trim, but it took so much effort to bend that far with her body shape.

“This. All of this is why I’m doing this.” She smacked her belly, and it jiggled slightly.

Sighing, she marched into her bathroom and started the water for a shower. She ignored the pathetic beeping of her water bottle as she tried yet again to wash away her familiar self-judgments.

\#

By the time Monday rolled around, Rachel’s stomach was cramping every few minutes and sour bile kept rising in her throat. She’d only had three tablets so far, not enough to cause any actual change. Dr. Jhaveri had warned her that the mental adjustment would be far worse than the physical adjustment. But she still felt horrid from the forty-nine hours she’d been without food.

*The tablet is all I need,* she assured herself as she sat at her computer and started up her work for the day. At least that didn’t have anything to do with food, and thank god she worked from home and didn’t have a breakroom to avoid. Rachel smiled as she lost herself in spreadsheets of numbers.

During her late-morning virtual meeting, Rachel felt embarrassed as they called her name twice. She had been counting the number of coffee cups she saw (and couldn’t drink) and hadn’t been paying attention.

“How are the forecasts looking?” her boss asked.

Rachel snapped from her coffee daydreams and managed to make it through the rest of the meeting without incident. A little salivation had escaped the corner of her lips when her colleague lifted a pastry to his mouth, but she was pretty sure no one had seen. Her camera wasn’t the sharpest focused on purpose.

The rest of the day went without incident, and Rachel was actually sad when it was over. What would she do next? There was nothing to entertain her and no more meals to cook, eat, or clean up from.

She wandered around her apartment for a bit. As she moseyed into the bathroom, she remembered that her shampoo was about to run out. Perfect! A quick trip out for shampoo. She could go to a drugstore. There would be some food there, but it would be better than a grocery store.

Rachel grabbed her purse and headed out the door.

\#

It was worse than she had ever imagined. Despite almost three days without food, she hadn’t felt delirious from hunger, but she may as well have been by the feelings she experienced upon being in the presence of food for the first time since she had started taking the tablets.

Rachel imagined herself tearing open chip bags and letting them rain down on her as she caught them in her mouth. From across the store, she glimpsed the refrigerated section and truly tried not to imagine being showered in the teas, sodas, energy drinks, and juices behind the glass.

But it was no use. Halfway into the store, she turned around and bolted. Delivery it would be for now, even for the little things.

\#

After almost two weeks, Rachel really thought she was getting the hang of things. Despite how much she had loved—and also hated—food in the past, she was glad for it to be gone. She was also glad the stomach pains had gone away. With nothing but the tablets, she was also starting to see a little more definition in her cheekbones.

Her ankle boots splashed in a puddle as she jogged across the street toward the marquee. Today would be her first social test. She was meeting three friends at the theatre for a Broadway show they had all been dying to see. Although her friends had done dinner first, Rachel had politely excused herself from that event, citing a need to do an errand for another friend.

As she waited in front of the theatre now, she wondered if anyone would notice her cheekbones. She prayed to god that they wouldn’t notice if she had nothing but water and went home right after. She certainly wasn’t ready to be around late-night snacks or alcohol.

“Rachel!” Marcie shouted and waved from a few yards down the block.

“Hey,” she replied as they approached. “You ready?”

Each woman scanned her ticket at the entry, and the usher directed them to their row. Rachel slid down the seats, excusing herself as her large body passed in front of those already sitting. Finally, she plopped down in her seat.

“Hey.” Marcie elbowed her. “Look what I got.” Marcie brought her purse into her lap and lifted the top flap. Rachel could see a box of Milk Duds, her favorite. “For the show. They charge too much here.”

“Maybe later,” Rachel whispered and then thanked fate that the lights dimmed at that moment. She settled in to enjoy the show.

Twenty minutes in, Marcie had already cracked open the orange box and was picking chocolate pieces apart in her hand and sliding them stealthily into her mouth. Rachel gave everything in her to try and only stare ahead at the show. But her eyes kept darting to the side, envying her friend’s gusto. When intermission came, she shot up from her seat and scooted past all the other rising patrons to run to the restroom.

She was one of the first in there, but she didn’t head for a stall. Instead, she hung a left through the door and entered the ladies’ powder room, a marble and gilded anteroom with a few couches for resting and a large mirror for primping. She sat on the farthest couch from the door and put her head in her hands. Women from the theater began pouring into the main room, forming the inevitable line that came with any social excursion.

A few minutes later, Rachel felt a hand on her back, and she looked up.

“Is something wrong?” Marcie asked. “You ran out of there so fast.”

Rachel cringed. Only her parents and long-distance friend from college knew she was taking the tablet. And she wanted to keep it that way for now.

“I just—I think it’s a stomach bug. I need to go.” Rachel rose and pushed past Marcie. Squeezing between the door and the next person in line, Rachel exited the bathroom and sped walked to the exit, not looking behind to see if Marcie was following.

\#

“Yes, Mom, I’ve lost a little weight.”

“How much?”

 “Fourteen pounds.”

“That’s excellent! I’m glad this is working out so well, as opposed to those other programs. And this one will stick?”

 Rachel pinched the bridge of her nose. “I’m committed,” was all she replied.

“Great—Oh, honey, I gotta go. I’m at my appointment now.”

Rachel ended the call and let her phone slide out of her hand onto the floor as she fell back on the couch. Oreo immediately ran over and laid on it, purring as he tucked his feet under him. With his paws tucked like that, he looked even more like his namesake.

“Come here.” Rachel picked him up and held him to her chest. She rubbed her face on his fur. “You care about me for real, right?” He purred, and Rachel’s heart lightened a bit.

\#

One month in, Rachel accepted another invitation to be social, this time, a trip to the mall for some retail therapy. Rachel wanted some new clothes anyway. She’d already dropped almost twenty pounds and was ready to adorn herself with some new fashions to match her growing confidence.

She was also pretty confident she could brave the mall without too much trouble. Walking by the food court might be a bit troublesome, but she could handle it if Stephanie didn’t stop. If she did, Rachel figured she’d just fake the stomach bug thing again and leave.

As she walked through the mall’s east entrance, her emotional support water bottle in her hand, Rachel immediately regretted her choice. The contained nature of the mall meant the smell of food wafted around every corner. Cookie aroma filled her nostrils, and the sound of patrons slurping their smoothies and coffees made Rachel’s stomach lurch.

She managed to keep walking straight as she sucked down a few ounces of water and headed toward the store Stephanie was waiting at. As she arrived, Stephanie darted out from behind a clothes rack and ambushed Rachel with a hug. “Oh my gosh, so good to see you!”

Rachel smiled. Stephanie had a way of making her feel like the most important person in the world when Rachel was with her. “I know. It’s been too long,” Rachel replied.

“Too long?” Stephanie held Rachel at arm’s length. “Girl, you’ve been MIA for like six weeks.”

“No,” Rachel countered. “Only like a month.”

Stephanie waved her comment away. “Regardless, it’s good to see you. And dang, look at you. Have you been doing something different with your beauty routine?”

Rachel was glad her weight loss was noticeable. Staring in the mirror every day made it hard to judge for herself just how different she might look. “Just being healthy, I guess.”

Stephanie shrugged and pulled Rachel over to the wall, where Stephanie fawned over a blue crop top with a camel pleather jacket. Rachel smiled, glad to be doing something normal again. And at least the scent of food had dissipated upon entering the store.

Rachel took her time combing the shelves and racks for new clothes. She wanted to feel different, but she wasn’t that different yet. Dr. Jhaveri had said the weight-stabilizing effect of the tablet would take a couple of years to work fully. She’d spent thirty-five years so far trying to get to a more acceptable weight. What was two more years? At least there was a clinical guarantee it would work.

Rachel slid hangers across a bar and looked for her size. Probably still a 3XL, but she saw a few loose shirts that she might fit with just a 2XL. She grabbed a few things and brought them with her to the dressing room, where Stephanie waited with at least twenty items in her hands.

“Didn’t find much?” Stephanie asked upon seeing Rachel’s meager haul.

“Just taking my time,” Rachel replied. The truth was that at least half of the items she had found cute hadn’t been available in her size. She had been relegated to grabbing the last hanger in the back of the rack and finding the sale rack items that no one seemed to think were fashionable but actually might fit.

In the dressing room, things didn’t fare much better. Rachel was struggling to zip a flowered skirt when she heard Stephanie call out. “Oh my god, look at this, Rach!”

Rachel pulled back part of the curtain covering her alcove. Stephanie’s long, thin body was poured into a skin-tight emerald-green minidress. “Isn’t it just fabulous?” Stephanie asked as she flicked at the dangling charms around the neckline.

Of course, it was gorgeous. Rachel had conceded long ago that everything Stephanie wore looked good on her. She was pretty sure Stephanie just had a good fashion sense, but having a standard-sized body that actually fit into the clothes in the store certainly didn’t harm her image either.

Rachel swallowed and gave a thumbs-up as she ducked behind the curtain again. She didn’t want Stephanie to catch her tears. Her water bottle began to softly beep and flash, and Rachel kicked it across the small changing alcove. It clanged on the back wall, and she heard a “You okay?” from Stephanie.

“I’m fine,” Rachel called as she threw the skirt down and wiped at the falling tears.

After they left the clothing store, they meandered around the mall. Rachel followed at Stephanie’s side, chatting about their friends and what had been happening at Stephanie’s work. They stopped in a few stores to look at T-shirts or knick-knacks they had seen in the window. It wasn’t until Stephanie pulled Rachel into a candle store that Rachel felt she might be in trouble.

Colored glass surrounded her, each vessel carrying a scent she really didn’t want to smell right now. While she might be able to sniff a jasmine or eucalyptus candle without incident, she didn’t think she could smell the wine berry pie or coconut macaroon candles without barfing or perhaps taking a bite of the wax.

Stephanie was already ten feet inside the store with her nose in a candle. Rachel lingered near the entrance, sipping on her water bottle, trying to avoid getting too deep into the surrounding aromas. But Stephanie approached with a candle a few seconds later and shoved it into Rachel’s hands.

“Isn’t this just divine?”

Rachel checked the label: iced mocha latte. She inhaled the tiniest bit she could while appearing normal, but Stephanie seemed to catch on to her ploy.

“Are you all right? You’ve been acting kind of strange today. And I thought you loved iced mocha lattes.”

Rachel sighed. She would have to start telling people if she didn’t want to be a hermit forever. She set the candle on a table and pulled Stephanie out of the store to a bench in the middle of the corridor.

“I have to tell you something.”

“Anything,” Stephanie said with sincere eyes.

Rachel took in a deep breath to steady herself. “Have you heard of that new drug? The one that’s supposed to be nutritionally complete so you no longer have to eat food?”

Stephanie nodded. “I think I heard something about that.”

“Well, I’m on it.”

Stephanie’s hand flew to her mouth. “Wait, what? You mean you’re just completely not eating?”

Rachel looked down at her hands. It wasn’t something easy to explain. “It’s not like anorexia or anything. You’re getting all you need to survive and be healthy. Food just isn’t necessary anymore. That’s all.”

Stephanie bit her bottom lip. “I mean, is it safe?”

“So far, so good,” Rachel joked, but inside, she wanted to cry and run as fast as possible out of the mall.

“But . . . why?”

This was the question Rachel had been dreading most of all. How could she explain to someone succinctly that food, whether the overindulgence or restriction of it, had been such a dominant and emotional part of her life that she just wanted to be done with it forever? Instead of saying anything, a few tears brimmed in her eyes, and she clenched her hands tighter around her water bottle.

Stephanie placed her hand on Rachel’s knee. “Hey,” she said. “If this is what you want, I’m behind you. I can’t say I understand it, but I’ll be behind you.”

“Thanks,” Rachel replied and smiled. “That’s actually a huge help.”

\#

With her confidence boosted by Stephanie, Rachel dared something a week later that she wasn’t sure she was ready for but might not ever be ready for: She accepted an invitation to a dinner party at her friends Mike and Henry’s house.

Walking toward the door, she saw Andre and Claire entering the brownstone with a big tray of cookies in their hands. She swallowed her saliva down. This might be harder than she expected. But she was already there and had agreed, so she set her shoulders square and followed her friends inside.

“Rachel!” Stephanie waved and came over for a hug. “You ready for this?” she whispered in Rachel’s ear.

Rachel pulled away and nodded. It had turned into a good-sized group, more than Rachel had expected. But she should have known that when Mike and Henry said a “small get-together,” they really meant ten or more people.

Hors d’oeuvres lined the coffee table and kitchen counters for guests to pick at before dinner. Rachel did her best to ignore them completely and went to pour herself a glass of water. Upon seeing only wine and sodas on the drink table, she ended up filling one of their fake crystal glasses with tap water from the sink. It was better than nothing.

Rachel made small talk with a few guests she knew and was introduced to some she didn’t. At some point during each conversation, someone she was talking to would look down at her clear, half-drunk drink and ask if they could get her anything. Each time, Rachel had to put on her biggest smile and fake her way through with an “Oh, I’m good for now.”

Eventually, everyone made their way to the table and found their seat, labeled nicely by an origami place tag. Rachel was near the middle of one side. To her right was someone she hadn’t met yet. To her left was a mutual friend she didn’t like all that much. Stephanie was her closest ally, and she was two seats down and across the table.

Mike and Henry ushered the rest of the guests to their seats and then began bringing baskets and plates and bowl after bowl of food to the table to be passed around. This was the part Rachel had been dreading. But she took a deep breath and imagined herself standing in the mirror before tonight’s dinner. She would stay strong.

She passed the tray of sliced ham to the man on her right but didn’t take any for herself. By the fourth dish she passed, he began to take notice.

“Are you okay?” he asked.

“Yeah,” Rachel said, fake smiling again. “I’m great.”

“It’s just . . . you haven’t taken any food. Just a picky eater?”

Great, the first question. She looked over at Stephanie for support, but she was engrossed in conversation with Andre and Claire.

“I’m not eating at the moment,” was all she decided to say and passed the next dish.

The man looked both confused and worried. “What do you mean? . . . You know, there are places that help with that kind of thing.”

Rachel looked away quickly, her cheeks hot. She really didn’t want to cry at this dinner party, but it was proving more difficult than she had imagined. The food she had been somewhat prepared to face. The questions she was truly terrified of.

“No, it’s a medication thing.”

“Oh.” The man continued passing dishes as Rachel handed them to him, but he kept looking down at Rachel’s empty plate with concern. Eventually, Andre took notice from across the table.

“What’s wrong, Rachel?” he chided. “Mike’s cooking not good enough for you?”

Rachel gulped as Stephanie met her eyes. The warmth and encouragement from Stephanie’s gaze steeled Rachel for her reply. “I’m not eating right now,” she echoed from her conversation with the stranger.

Andre scoffed. “What does that even mean? That’s not how to lose weight, if that’s what you’re going for.”

Claire nudged him in the ribs.

“Oww.”

“That’s rude,” Claire whispered loudly.

Rachel shook her head. Better to just come out with it.

“I’m taking that new nutrition tablet. Since it supplies me with everything I need, there’s no need for extraneous food.” She sat back. She had said it louder than intended and several people around the table were now staring.

“Why would you do that?” Claire asked, open-mouthed.

God, this question again.

Rachel stared them down. “I’m tired. I’m tired of eating. I’m tired of cooking meals and doing dishes and spending money on food that just goes bad in my refrigerator. I’m tired of counting every single calorie just to look the way I do.”

“And this drug is supposed to fix that? You can’t expect magic from a pill,” Andre retorted.

“It could be a miracle,” Rachel countered.

Andre smirked and crossed his arms. “Miracle?”

“Yeah . . .” Rachel tried to remember some of what Dr. Jhaveri had said at their first meeting. “Imagine it. A world without hunger, without farms, without fishing, without obesity-related issues.”

“Oh yeah? And what about farmers? What about fishermen? What about companies that make drugs to solve those obesity-related issues? Even restaurants and grocery stores. What happens to all of them, huh? You think a world without food would be a miracle? No thanks.”

Rachel’s cheeks were getting hotter, and her makeup no longer hid her anger or embarrassment. “You wouldn’t understand,” she mumbled, a bit deflated.

“Then enlighten me.”

Rachel looked at his smug face and wanted to reach over the table and punch him. Instead, she stood, opened her mouth, and began speaking loudly. If some people at the table hadn’t been paying attention already, they were now.

“Fine. You want to know what it’s like? Imagine being six years old and not realizing you were bigger than other kids, so you were teased for a reason you didn’t really understand. Imagine being on so many diet programs that by the time you got to high school, only the more and more extreme diets were left, causing your friends and even some teachers to express concern. Imagine going through a major surgery just to try and change the shape of your body because people like you make us feel like we don’t belong. Shall I go on?”

The smirk had dropped from Andre’s face.

“I’m doing this”—she looked around the table—""because every time I think about food or buy food or touch food, it’s just another reminder of my entire life and every societal expectation ever placed on me. I hate it. I’ll never chew anything again in my life, but I’m going to be happier for it. You’ll see.”

At that, she turned and headed for the front door. The table was mostly silent as she walked the few rooms to the exit. As she opened it to leave, she heard Andre back at the table say, “Well, now that the wet blanket is gone . . .”

Rachel rushed out the door, pulling it shut too hard behind her. She almost tripped going down the stoop because her eyes were brimming with tears. After she had made it only ten steps down the sidewalk, she heard a noise from the brownstone. She turned to look.

Stephanie and the stranger who had been sitting to her right were coming down the stoop. Stephanie’s arm was halfway in the air to flag her down.

“Rachel, stop,” she called.

Rachel stood where she was, hands on her hips, and waited for them to approach.

“What?” she asked more tersely than she intended.

“That guy is an asshole,” the stranger explained. “You expressed yourself truly and deeply, and I appreciate that.”

“Yeah,” Stephanie cut in. “I don’t need all my friends to be the same, I just need them to be authentic, and you were that tonight. Screw Andre.”

Rachel smiled. She hadn’t felt this supported in a long time and it was a nice feeling. She didn’t know what to do from here though.

“So . . .” the strange man broke the silence. “Do we all want to go grab a water or something?”

Rachel laughed and smiled at him.

\#

Rachel’s leg bounced under her dress as she waited for Dr. Jhaveri to enter the exam room. It’d been fourteen months, and the intake nurse had congratulated her on losing her first hundred pounds. Rachel was smiling as she picked at her cuticles.

“Rachel, how are we doing today?” Dr. Jhaveri said as he entered the room. “I see you’ve dropped a full hundred pounds already. Any lingering physical or mental side effects?”

Rachel shook her head. “Not really. I’ve been able to go out regularly, and Jacob and I even watch some cooking shows together. I think it’s going well.”

Dr. Jhaveri smiled. “Excellent. I like to hear these things. All your vitals look good. The bloodwork came back stellar. Overall, I see no issues with continuing. And in fact, I was wondering if you’d consider being an ambassador for our drug.”

“Ambassador? What would I have to do?”

“Well, to start, we’d want to do a short video testimonial. And we were thinking it would be beneficial for others starting on the drug to hear from someone experienced. Would you mind mentoring a few folks looking to change their lives?”

Rachel paused. A lot had changed for the better, that was for sure. She was happy enough with her choice and her life, but she didn’t feel near qualified enough to counsel others on it. After all, it was only yesterday when she had stood in the mirror and plucked that damn cheek hair and squeezed a few ingrown hairs in her pits. Plus, her refrigerator doors remained handcuffed, and she didn’t want to admit that she sometimes had to change the pillowcase in the middle of the night because she woke up drooling from a food dream.

“You don’t have to decide right now,” Dr. Jhaveri said to cover her silence. “Just think about it.”

Rachel nodded. “I will. Thanks.”

Out on the street, Rachel dropped the white prescription bag in her purse and slid on her designer sunglasses. She was about to make her way to the park, where she was meeting Jacob to sit with him during his lunch, when her phone rang.

“Hey, Mom,” she answered.

“Hello, darling! I got the pictures you sent last night. You look so beautiful, and congrats on losing a hundred pounds.”

Rachel smiled. “Thanks. I’m really happy about it.”

“Good. Just don’t forget to touch up those roots before the next big party. Oh, I’ve got to go. All my love!”

The phone went silent.

Rachel looked at her reflection in the black screen, then dialed the medical office number. “Hi, yeah, it’s Rachel. Can you tell Dr. Jhaveri that I want to be an ambassador? I’m ready to help change people’s lives.”",1,1762549468.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

This week I have mostly been working on tariffs and a financial transaction tax.

The tariff system uses real life data and divides the tariffs into 36 categories. The categories include things like food, fuels, pharmaceuticals, plastic, clothes, and so forth. In real life, there are 77,000 categories.

Each tariff category has its own default tariff rate. These were calculated by taking the tariff revenue for the category and dividing it by the category import value. This provides an average tariff rate for each category. In real life, it is more complicated, and each category might have a different tariff rate for each country.

There will be several ways to adjust tariffs in the game. First is to just create new legislation and try to pass it through congress (with a presidential signature). The president, or a member of congress, can use this method.

There are three other methods that relate exclusively to the president. One option is to issue tariffs related to unfair trade practices (Trade Act of 1974 - Section 301). This is sort of generic: it will give the president the authority to adjust all tariffs based on some arbitrary claim of unfair trade practices. I'm not sure how it will be implemented yet (in terms of congressional oversight). Perhaps congress can just create a new tariff law to set their own rates to overwrite the rates of the president. They will also have the ability to eliminate the law that grants these tariff authorities to the president.

A second option for the president is related to national security (The Trade Expansion Act of 1962 - Section 232). These tariffs will be limited to categories related to national security (such as steel). If a country imports too much steel, there is a risk that it will not be able to maintain its military capacity (in instances where those imports are cutoff). As such, the president can try to encourage domestic production of those categories by increasing tariffs on the relevant imports. A category like ""toys"" does not influence national security, so the president would not be authorized to adjust toy tariffs using this law. Again, congress can eliminate the law that grants these tariff authorities to the president.

The final option the president has comes from the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The president will be able to declare an emergency and then use tariffs to address the emergency. Congress can draft a resolution to end the emergency, but it requires a presidential signature to pass (so it will essentially need a veto-proof majority). The emergency declaration only lasts one year before it expires - at which point the tariffs revert back to previous values. But the emergency declaration can be renewed each year.

There are two broad categories of tariffs: first there is the category-specific tariff and second there is a flat rate tariff. Both of these can be used in combination. For example, you can have a 3% tariff on Coffee imports and a 10% flat rate tariff on all imports, which would create an effective rate of 13% on coffee imports.

The Financial Transaction Tax (sometimes known as a Wall Street Tax), taxes financial transactions such as buying/selling equities on the stock market. As such, it is targeted mostly towards high-wealth earners.",15,1762549344.0,ThePoliticalProcess,2,0.94,False
1or664z,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1or664z/aita_for_kicking_my_dad_out_of_my_wedding_after/,"AITA for kicking my dad out of my wedding after he introduced his girlfriend (26F) as my ""new mom"" when I'm 28F?","My dad brought his 26-year-old girlfriend to my wedding and introduced her to people as my new mom, and now he's crying because his entire family cut him off and he lost his job.

I'm 28. My dad is 52. His girlfriend just turned 26 last month. She's literally two years younger than me.

They started dating about eight months after my mom died. Cancer. It was brutal. I spent six months watching her waste away. My dad was there too, or at least I thought he was. Turns out he met this girl at his gym three months before my mom passed. I found out later from my aunt that people saw them getting coffee together while my mom was still in hospice.

I didn't know any of that when I sent him a wedding invitation. I just knew he was dating someone younger and it made me uncomfortable. My fiancé and I had been engaged for two years. We wanted to wait until I felt ready after losing my mom. My dad knew how hard it was for me.

Two weeks before the wedding, my dad calls me.

""Hey sweetie, can I bring a plus one?""

""Sure dad. Is it serious?""

""Yeah, actually. I think you'll really like her. She's mature for her age.""

That phrase. I should have known right then.

The wedding day comes. Everything is beautiful. I'm standing in the bridal suite with my bridesmaids when my cousin rushes in.

""You need to see this.""

My dad is in the lobby with this girl. She's wearing a white dress. Not like white white, but cream colored. Close enough that people are staring. She's got her arm looped through his and she's giggling at something.

I'm trying to stay calm. It's my wedding day. I go back to getting ready.

The ceremony goes fine. It's the reception where everything falls apart.

My dad stands up during the toasts. I didn't ask him to give a speech. We agreed my uncle would do it since my dad and I had been kind of distant.

He grabs the mic anyway.

""I just want to say how proud I am of my daughter. And I'm so glad I could be here with my beautiful girlfriend. I know it's soon after her mother passed, but life goes on, right? And I think her mom would want her to have a new mother figure in her life.""

The room goes silent.

Then he looks at his girlfriend and says, ""Stand up honey. Everyone, this is going to be my daughter's new mom.""

She stands up. She's smiling. She actually waves.

I lose it.

""Get out.""

My dad looks confused. ""What?""

""Get the hell out of my wedding. Both of you.""

""Sweetie, don't be dramatic. I'm just trying to integrate our families.""

""She's two years younger than me. My mom died less than a year ago. You're not integrating anything. You're embarrassing yourself.""

The girlfriend chimes in. ""I really think we could be friends. Like sisters.""

I laugh. I actually laugh. ""You need to leave. Now.""

My dad gets angry then. ""I paid for half this wedding. You can't kick me out.""

My uncle stands up. He's a big guy. ""Yeah she can. Let's go.""

That's when my dad says the thing I'll never forget.

""Your mother would be ashamed of how you're acting.""

My uncle physically escorts them out. My dad is yelling the whole way. His girlfriend is crying.

The wedding continues. People are supportive. But it's tainted now.

Here's where it gets worse.

My aunt, my dad's sister, she was at the wedding. She's horrified by what happened. She goes home and starts making phone calls. She digs into when my dad actually met this girl. She finds out about the coffee dates during hospice. She tells everyone.

My dad's entire side of the family cuts him off. His parents, my grandparents, they're disgusted. They were married for 50 years before my grandma died. My grandpa especially is furious.

Then someone at my dad's work sees a video from the wedding that got posted online. One of the guests filmed the whole toast debacle. It goes semi-viral in our city. My dad works at a family-owned company that's big on values and image. They fire him. They say it's for other reasons but everyone knows why.

His girlfriend leaves him two weeks later. Apparently she was in it for the stability. Once he lost his job and his family, she bounced.

Now my dad is alone. He's been calling me every day for three weeks. Texting. Emailing. He says he's sorry. He says he didn't realize how bad it looked. He says he needs his family back. He wants me to talk to my grandparents and my aunt and everyone else.

""Please, I made a mistake. I was grieving too. I handled it wrong. But I'm still your father.""

I haven't responded to anything.

My husband thinks I should at least hear him out. He says my dad is clearly suffering and maybe he really didn't understand how inappropriate he was being. He thinks family is important and I might regret cutting him off completely.

My best friend says I owe him nothing. She says he made his choices and now he gets to live with them. She's worried that if I let him back in, he'll never actually take responsibility.

My grandpa called me yesterday. He says it's my choice but he won't be reconciling with my dad either way. He said what my dad did, cheating on my mom emotionally while she was dying, then parading that girl around at my wedding, it's unforgivable.

I don't know what to feel. Part of me misses having a dad. Part of me wants to see him hurt the way he hurt me. Part of me wonders if I'm being too harsh.

He lost everything. His job, his family, his girlfriend, his reputation. All because he couldn't read the room at my wedding and because he started something with someone while my mom was dying.

Is that enough punishment or do I owe him a chance to apologize?

If you're a teenager reading this, 13-18, I'm not writing this to scare you more. 

I want to tell you the truth.

The televised press conference we all just watched terrified me, but I'm here to tell you the experts are afraid of telling you the truth. This isn't intentional, they're just as scared as we are. They're terrified: 

Not knowing what this thing is or how to stop it terrifies them. 

But this sickness affecting the teenage population is NOT new. 

It infected my town this time last year and took my brother. 

Those who *do* know what it is tried to burn us to the ground to stop it from spreading. I spent half a year in a facility in their attempt to extract whatever this is from my veins, cruel procedures drilling into me and testing my bone marrow. 

But it's already around you. It's in the air, melded into your brains. 

It's November 28th, so you're already feeling it. It's not like fomites, anything you can catch. It's deeper than that. 

I don't think I can describe just *how* this thing spreads without sounding out of my mind. 

This thing is going to spread. You've seen it on the news, right? 

It's contagious, except not in the way you think. 

But it's not going to kill you.

Kill you permanently, anyway. 

If I'm honest, I wish it did kill us. I wish it killed me. 

OC, California, was what my younger self had called a ""sunshine state.""

Our little town, just on the edge of the coast, was paradise.

Aside from winter weather and the occasional freak storm, I had grown up in the sun. 

I had known the beach my whole life—the soft sand underfoot and between my toes. 

The shallows I waded into every morning without fail, trailing after my older brother and his friends, chasing the surf under shallow pinks streaked across the sky.

I knew salt and sweat, Ray-Bans perched on my head, the grossness of sunscreen gluing my hair to my neck. The memories of sandcastles, and the relentless, yet beautiful scorch of the sun on my skin. 

The heat clashing with the coolness of the sea as I dipped under, waiting for that one wave that would toss me into the air, sending me spiraling with the ocean itself before tumbling me back down into the depths.

The surf that eventually carried me back to the shallows and spit me out to where Mom waited with ice cream, always ready to lather me in Factor 50.

Presently, I bit back a hiss when my school bus took yet another sharp turn, jerking my head into the window. 

I was slowly starting to regret my decision to come on this stupid school retreat. 

Why was it snowing?

Leaning my head against the ice-cold glass, I could only stare outside, confusion and slight panic prickling up and down my spine. In the seat in front of me, Sara Lakewood had sneezed again, a violent wet-sounding sneeze, and refused to cover up her damn mouth.

I was used to snow sometimes. Like, maybe a sprinkle, or even just a few inches if we were lucky.

""In OC California today on Wednesday, November 22nd, 2023: sunny, with a high of 75°F and a low of 61°F,"" that's what Alexa had said. “Sunny, with cloudier conditions as we move into the afternoon!”

Pressing my face into the glass, I squinted through spiraling snowflakes that seemed abnormally large, thicker, already obstructing my view. I wouldn't exactly call this cloudy conditions. 

This was freak weather, the type I would expect to be on the national news or fear-mongering TikTok pages. 

I tried my phone again; still no signal. I did get one single bar when the bus stopped, and we got stuck in a snowdrift (I still wasn’t sure how we were still alive let alone why this driver kept going), but it was gone before I could try Mom’s phone. 

There was barely any visibility outside, and I was having a hard time believing our driver when he assured us that everything was going to be fine.

That slight shudder in his tone wasn't helping. This guy had no idea what the fuck he was talking about. 

The blanket of snow outside shouldn't have freaked me out as much as it did—but staring out into what would normally be golden landscapes and endless ocean, I only saw... white. 

With my cheek uncomfortably pressed against the pane, I wrapped my jacket tighter around myself, surprised by my breath dancing in front of me in sharp wisps. 

I shouldn't have been shocked that the school couldn't afford heating on the bus. 

We were a tiny town, and most of our funding went into our sports department. 

However, the least they could do was supply half a dozen kids who were not used to this type of weather, this deep-rooted cold sliding into every bone in my body, with heat packs. 

I wasn't dressed for arctic conditions. 

That morning, I was pretty sure my wardrobe would only be light sweaters and jeans. 

California weather could be spotty at times, but it was always a guarantee that we were never going to get a literal fucking snow storm. 

Still, if I really strained my ears, I could maybe trick myself into believing the blizzard outside was, in fact, ocean waves crashing against a shore where I once felt safe.

“Summer.”

The familiar voice barely registered. I ignored it, curling into my seat and willing my body to stop shaking. 

“I know you're ignoring me.”

I kept my focus on the snow piling up on the windows. 

The sheer amount that had fallen in just under an hour was almost impossible. 

I could already sense my classmates' chatter shift from TikTok and Twitch streamers to ""what the fuck is going on outside?""

I was also unlucky enough to get seated in front of Wes Cameron. I had to bite back a hiss when he kicked my seat yet again in an attempt to balance on his seat to get a perfect shot of the storm. 

He was acting like he'd never seen snow before, jabbering to his seat mate, who was currently my other least favorite person on this bus.

“Summahhhhhhhh.”

That annoying voice had turned into a sing-song.

“Go awaaaaay,” I mimicked his taunt. “I’m trying to sleep.”

“You don't *look* asleep.” 

I shifted in my seat, trying to get comfortable. “Key word, *trying*.”

“Mom says you're not spending the holidays with us.”

“So?” I didn't turn around.

“That's not very festive of you, sis.” 

When I didn't respond, he sighed. “So, you're going to ruin Christmas for everyone.”

“Ouch! Jeez man, you didn't have to do her like that!”

I wasn't expecting Wes to chime in, poking his head through the gap in my seat. 

He shot me a grin, and I shoved him away, with a finger-poke to the forehead. 

“Ow!”

I wasn't sure what made me snap. Wes Cameron trying to squeeze his head through the very small gap in my seat, or the idea that my brother still believed in the magic of fucking Christmas– when he treated the holidays like spring break. 

He wasn't even conscious for the special day a year prior, passed out on the beach after his holiday party went sideways.

Since Mom was too embarrassed to acknowledge Wes’s behavior (or admit it to our neighbors), I was the one running to and from our house, with a barf bucket and fresh cans of soda when everyone else was tucking into their Christmas dinners. 

Ah yes, the festive cheer of cleaning up your brother’s puke!

Dislodging myself from the window, I lifted my head to find the Golden Child himself looming over me, arms crossed, eyebrows raised, mimicking our mother. 

He was wearing a reindeer sweater, which was already a flashing red flag. 

The light up antlers sticking out made me feel nauseous. 

The sweater was too big for him, baggy and hanging off his slim frame, definitely an attempt to get on Mom’s good side. His bobble hat was a… choice. Mom was obsessed with holiday-themed clothing.

Fallon, or ""Fall"" since, apparently, our parents were comedic geniuses with names was exactly one year older than me. 

And despite his growing list of almost felonies, according to Mom, still the *”golden child”*: while I was the kid she avoided talking about during family gatherings. The socially awkward one who was *just going through a phase*. 

Mom named us after the seasons we were born under.

While I was born in July, summer months, long days, and an increasingly painful pregnancy (thanks for the tmi, Mom), Fallon was born in the fall, under cozy red skies and fallen leaves. 

My brother was the literal fucking Golden Child. 

But I didn't blame her for giving up on me. 

Unlike my brother, who actually had a life, I had ditched surfing and the beach when I found my individuality, choosing to stay at home all day playing Stardew Valley. 

I didn't abandon the outside completely, but I did stop traipsing after my brother and his friends, finding comfort in my own room.

The last time I hung out with my brother, Fallon left to get takeout pizza. I wanted to go with him, but he was crushing on a guy, and apparently, having his little sister third-wheeling was social death. 

I made the mistake of heading back to my brother’s friend's, who were complaining of my presence. 

They didn't want a fourteen year old kid hanging out with them, and I guess they were too polite to tell my brother.

So, I distanced myself. 

That was until I was forced to acknowledge his existence on this stupid field trip. Since his friends were joining us for the entire holiday, Mom insisting on this huge party bringing all our families together, my brother’s friends were *also* invited. 

Hence, I was planning on spending my holidays elsewhere. My plan was to ignore Fallon’s existence, and once the field trip was over, jump on a flight. 

However, the universe had other plans. It was pretty hard to ignore him when he was clinging to my seat, our janky bus rocking him side to side. 

Fallon and I were like carbon copies of our mother and father. 

While I had inherited Mom’s brunette curls and darker complexion, Fallon was a pale redhead. 

You could see the resemblance… if you squinted. 

It was mostly in our eyes and the shape of our faces. According to someone in class, we had the exact same resting-bitch face.

The same one he was pulling at that moment, eyebrow cocked, lips pricked into a slight smile. I quickly decided that I hated his stupid fucking reindeer sweater, another ploy to get on Mom’s good side. 

Fallon *loved* family interventions– especially when he was the one holding them. 

I decided to humor him, trying to ignore our growing audience. 

“I’m not interested in playing happy families,” I spoke through what I hoped was a gritted smile. I could already feel my cheeks growing warm, and it wasn't even a relief. It was *uncomfortable* warm, like sticking your head in an oven. “Can we talk about this later?”

“Mom told me to talk to you.”

It was always “Mom says” with him. Jeez, it was like talking to a toddler. 

“I have nothing to say,” I said. “It's just two weeks. You can survive without me, Fallon.”

Fallon folded his arms. “So, where are you going?”

“Florida.” I said. “I have friends I’m staying with.”

I hated the way he smirked, like what I was saying *couldn't* be true. “Friends?”

“I met them on a discord server.”

He curled his lip– yet another Mom-ism. “You're fifteen.”

I rolled my eyes. “They're my *age*, Fallon.”

When the bus jerked again, this time setting off a cacophony of cries behind us, my brother was oddly calm, tightening his grip on my seat. 

“Okay, well,” his voice wobbled when he was violently thrown backwards, only just managing to keep his balance. “Can you at least let me drive you?”

“Fallon Cartwright,” our driver shouted, tackling the wheel, snow pounding down on the windshield. “Please sit down!”

Fallon shot me a look, his eyes widening. I knew exactly what he was thinking. 

Since when did a random bus driver know my brother’s name? 

I think I was about to question it, amused and maybe a little panicked. Maybe this guy knew our mother? She was a well known name in the town, after all. 

I remember reaching out and grabbing his arm, wrapping my hand around his wrist and tugging him into the seat next to me. 

But in the corner of my eye, the driver fucking exploded. 

I don't mean he burst into meaty chunks, a total gore-fest. 

I mean one minute he was there, frantically trying to brush snow from the windscreen with his bare hand, sticking his head out of the window– and in a single disorienting moment, *pop!*, and he was gone, exploding into a vivid red mist. 

“Summer?”

Fallon’s voice was barely scratching the surface of my mind, when I was staring at what almost reminded me of stardust, a crimson tide of red sparkles suspended in the air, lightly coating the driver’s seat. 

It took me half a second to realize that somehow, this man had just spontaneously combusted and it slowly began to dawn on me that *nobody was driving the bus*. The world turned mute. 

Voices were ocean waves slamming into my skull. 

Outside, I could just make out the jagged edge of a cliff we were careening towards, the bus swerving again and sending my classmates into a fresh panic. 

In that moment, I wanted to be the hero, jumping forward to grab the wheel myself and steer us from the cliff face we were teetering on the edge of.

But I could only sit there, paralyzed, dazed. Watching the road get narrower and narrower, it reminded me of going through the tunnel in that old Willy Wonka movie. 

No light, no hope, just darkness slowly enveloping us. 

I never felt the bus tip over the edge. Initially, it was a single sharp jerk that slammed my head into the window. 

I should have felt the lurch, the weightlessness as I was hurled forward and propelled off my feet, and the crushing force of fifty thousand megatons of steeI obliterating my internal organs. 

I remember screams erupting and something wet hitting me in the face, followed by a blinding white light that grew brighter and brighter and brighter. 

When I think back, it felt like living in a movie except the movie was ending in one, vivid, fiery explosion so powerful that I was yanked from my body. 

I should have felt my death but whatever death was, it spat me back out. I remember distantly thinking it must not have liked the taste.

I awoke to wails and sobs and my body lodged between two seats. I couldn't feel my legs. I couldn't *feel* anything, only a growing numbing sensation severing my nerve endings. 

I didn't realize my mouth was already open in a silent scream, and I was choking up blood. 

When I managed to open my eyes, and keep them open, something was looming over me, swaying back and forth, back and forth. It was like a pendulum, hypnotizing me and lulling me to sleep, my eyes focusing and blurring, black spots growing big and small, big and small.

“Summer!”

Someone was shaking me, prodding my face. I felt their fingers try to find a pulse in my neck and wrist, but I still couldn't feel my legs. 

I sensed someone's breath in my face, unusually warm, dancing across my cheeks. When they coughed, I assumed fumes, but I wasn't expecting something warm and wet to coat my face. 

“Fuck.” The voice suddenly had an identity, my muddled brain briefly finding clarity. 

“Summer, stay with me, all right?” Wes Cameron knelt in front of me, slapping my face, trying to keep me awake, and when I did open my eyes, I ignored his frantic gaze and blood speckled lips, focusing on the weird swinging object dancing above his head. 

It was too big to be a backpack. Flickering in and out of view, I could see the twisted, mangled skeleton of our bus wrapped around me, crushing my chest in a suffocating embrace. 

“I've got you!” Wes’s cry was laboured with sobs. I could feel his hands on me, another disorienting wave of dizziness, and then– “I did it!” His sharp breath barely grazed my ears before I could *feel*. 

The numbing cold underneath me, blood pooling around the wreckage. Wes didn't hesitate, wrapping me into an awkward hug and violently wrenching me from where I was wedged between what was left of the crumpled seats and window. 

Lying on my back, I saw the carnage from a different angle. I followed the intense red smear. It was so cold, and there was so much pain, coming in sharp pulses rattling my body. 

But I could feel my legs—they were intact, folded underneath me. Wes gently pulled me into a sitting position. 

Blood ran from my nose, my mouth, my ears, choking me. But I was alive. 

When my gaze found the swinging shape looming over me, it hit me that I wasn't looking at an object lit up by the bus emergency lights. 

I was staring at what was left of a bright green holiday sweater, illuminated antlers illuminating a reindeer nose that was now soaked in red. 

Delusional, I remembered it hadn't been Rudolph before… I only saw the torso, and that was enough. 

It didn’t fully register that it was my brother’s corpse swinging back and forth until someone, Wes, grabbed my shoulders and forced me to look at him. 

Fallon was dead. 

I wasn't sure what grieving was yet, or even how you were supposed to react to a death.

But in that intimate moment where it was just me and my tumultuous thoughts, that poisonous and selfish part of me could only think of one single word: 

Finally.

And then it well and truly fucking hit me. Fallon was dead. 

Fallon wasn't coming *back*. 

Sound came in and out, like whooshes of air. 

Wes’s lips were moving, but all I could hear was my frenzied heartbeat. 

Before. 

Whoooosh.

“Hey!” Wes’s voice was loud and invasive. “Look at me!”

I didn't look at him. I looked at my brother. Corpse. His corpse.

Somebody was screaming. It wouldn't stop. Distantly, I realized it was me; *I* was screaming.

The noise was horrifying, a shrill screech exploding in my skull. 

“Summer, we need to get out of here,” Wes’s heavy breaths hit my face. Warm arms were already wrapping around me, pulling me like a doll out of the wreckage and straight into swirling snowflakes. 

It was still snowing. The thought felt muddled and wrong as I sat on my knees, shivering and numb, at a loss for words. 

Around me was a cacophony of my screaming classmates, some missing limbs, others barely alive, pleading for death.

Fallon was *still* in there, my thoughts screamed. I didn't see a head. 

I didn't see his full dead body. So, maybe… I was already on my knees, crawling through blanketed white, before another pair of arms held me back. 

I didn't know her name. Poppy, or Holly, or something like that. 

The girl dropped down in front of me, her eyes wide and unseeing. 

She had been on the track team. 

I vaguely remembered her from our yearbook—always at the front of every photo, always smiling, her blonde ponytail swinging and doll-like smile perpetually picture perfect. 

Now, her blonde hair hung in scarlet, tangled rat tails glued to her face.

“Did you see it?”

The girl’s words caught me off guard, sending me shuffling back. 

The bus driver exploding into red mist. She saw it too. When she came closer, so close her breath prickled my face, I noticed blood seeping from her lips and dribbling down her chin. 

The girl coughed, and I found myself with a face full of bloody mucus. She was ill. 

She wasn't just shivering from the cold, if her feverish skin and bloodshot eyes were any indication. I didn't respond. 

She slowly got to her feet, swaying from side to side as she stumbled away, muttering to herself. 

Holly coughed again, this time covering her mouth, and then stared down at her blood streaked palm, her lip wobbling. Holly was sick, I thought, dizzily.

In a daze, I think I batted her bloody snot from my cheeks. 

 But I don't think I cared. 

I sat there for a long time waiting for Fallon to appear from the wreckage. 

Wes finally dropped down in front of me, grasping my hands. 

I hadn't fully taken in his injuries until that moment, noticing the scary looking gash slicing through his forehead, his thick brown curls hanging in half lidded eyes. He was mostly intact, but each of his words accompanied a violent cough, his chest wheezing. Oh. The thought was like a wave crashing into me. 

Wes was sick too. 

His lips parted and then moved, shaping into what I could only guess was sympathy: I'm so sorry, Summer.

But I couldn't hear him this time. 

Instead, I was wondering why his hands were so *warm*, slick and sweaty, tangled with mine. 

While I was ice cold. 

I found my voice, when I was able to stand, breathing into my hands to stay warm. 

“You don't look so good,” I told him, and to my surprise, he laughed. 

Then coughed, this time into his hands, and then wiping them on his jacket. 

“Neither do you!”

There were approximately nine survivors, out of twenty kids on our bus. The majority of our class were dead, but that fact had yet to sink in. I was still looking for familiar faces among the shadows of the survivors. 

It quickly became apparent that we were on our own. There was no signal, and when we did manage to find a single bar, 911 was disconnected. 

Kids started to panic, but I just kept telling myself it was because of the weather. 

This snow was unprecedented, not what our town was used to. So, of course our emergency lines would be busy. 

Elizabeth Banks, however, made sure to keep reminding me that the emergency lines were not busy. They were dead. 

Wes took over as our leader, announcing that we weren't that far away from home. 

He was right. Even with the snow, I could still make out where our bus had toppled down a shallow embankment. 

So, gathering as many resources as possible, we started the hike back to town while doing our best to haul the injured on makeshift stretchers. 

I was lucky to be able to walk, driven by pure adrenaline. 

I dreaded seeing my mother, and explaining that Fallon wasn't coming back. Somehow, she would make it all my fault. 

I was already rehearsing the words in my head. 

“I'm sorry, Mom. I’m so sorry I couldn't save him.” 

There was no right way to tell my mother her son was never coming back. 

And yet again, that selfish part of me didn't want to. 

Why was it my responsibility? Why was I trying to fucking apologize?

Wes’s initial idea was to hitchhike back to town. But when we got back onto the main road, we realized that was not going to happen. 

Traffic had simply stopped—cars crashing into each other, jamming the road. 

It's because of the snow, I told myself. 

Wes and two other guys were already checking each car, their faces growing progressively paler. 

We could have blamed it on the treacherous conditions; in fact, we tried to, at first. 

Our town had never experienced snow like this. The type that grounds entire cities to a halt and freezes people in cars.

I was knee deep in snow drifts, wading towards a flipped over ranger, when Dom Hudson voiced my thoughts. “Where is everyone?” he spoke up, cutting through that unnerving silence and voicing what none of us wanted to acknowledge. 

I poked my head into each car and found exactly the same thing: the seatbelts were still in place.

Wes was already losing his cool, his voice breaking.

“We’re okay,” he announced, his tone saying the opposite. “It's probably because of the storm! I'm sure everyone's… evacuated.”

He didn't have to voice his conclusion after checking every car in the vicinity, because we all knew it. 

None of these drivers had left their seats. 

It wasn't until I stuck my head in a fancy Prius, did the magnitude of the situation truly hit me. Just like with our bus driver, I found myself staring at sparkling red mist splattering the steering wheel. 

Wes had an answer, or at least what he thought was one. He was trying to find logic and science, when I was pretty sure we were looking at spontaneous human combustion, on a catastrophic scale. 

I had no idea just how widespread it was until we reached home in the early hours of the morning. I couldn't tell what time. 

It was still snowing, and by then, we were up to our knees in it. The whole town had come to a grinding halt. 

I went straight home in a panic that turned to dread at the sight of our wide open front door. 

Alexa cheerfully greeted me with “Welcome home! The time is 3am on Thursday November 23rd, and the temperature is currently 15°F with a real feel of 7°F.” 

Water was running upstairs. When I stumbled up to the landing, I stepped straight into suds flooding the bathroom. 

I turned off the faucet, my hands shaking. Mom was running a bath. 

I could see exactly what she was doing in what was left behind. The TV was still switched onto the weather channel, her laptop open on the coffee table, our school’s website on display. 

Her phone was on the floor, the screen shattered. 

But I saw my name between the cracks. 

Summer ♥️ 

She tried to call me 54 fucking times. 

Hesitantly, I followed the trail, backtracking into the main hallway where a glass of wine lay shattered on the floor. 

Dropping to my knees, I dragged my fingers across the carpet; the same red smear clung to each fiber. 

I didn’t want to admit that the scarlet smudge on our hallway carpet was my mother and not her wine or that, before she exploded, she had been desperately trying to contact me. 

Going into shock again, I did everything I could to distract myself. 

I checked the refrigerator and pantry, taking note of every item. 

We still had power, so I grabbed my mom’s phone and tried, once again, to reach an emergency line. 

I washed my face once, twice, three times, four, scrubbing at my face until my skin was raw. I felt like I was caked in him. 

When I pulled out my ponytail, I could feel *him* stuck in my hair and glued to my neck. Fallon was dead.. Mom was dead. 

I spent hours in the shower, hours I don't even remember, sitting with my knees to my chest, trying to imagine if I had only pulled Fallon into his seat sooner. 

He would be with me, trying to calm me down– the logic in this fucked up mess. The survivor's guilt was eating me alive. 

I was alone. Still though, I found comfort in  my usual bedtime routine, trying to ignore the excited screaming from outside. Younger kids were running in the snow way past their bedtime, happy or hysterical, and still not fully registering that their parents were dead. 

Hours passed by and I was already expecting my mother to come yell at me for not being asleep, or placing warm milk with honey by my bedside. 

But I was alone inside a freezing cold house that was no longer home. 

I started to break apart. I tried and failed to sleep in my room.

It was supposed to be my safe place, but it felt simultaneously too big and like the walls were closing in. I tried Fallon’s, and I couldn’t even step over the threshold. 

Everything was still exactly where he’d left it, like he was coming back. I hadn't been in his room for a while, and he'd revamped it. Fallon’s personality was lit up in every Marvel movie poster, in his surfboards hanging from the walls. 

His bedroom didn’t make sense against the backdrop of the storm outside—heavy, blanketed white clashing with his beaded curtains and multicolored beach towels. 

I could see unfinished college applications on his desk, his laptop still open, frozen on the Minecraft menu screen. Before the field trip, he'd stuck his head through my door. 

“Yo, do you wanna hang out? I'm setting up Minecraft right now.”

I ignored him, corking in my headphones. 

I never told him about his friends because I didn't want to fuck up our relationship. 

But I had fucked it up, I pushed him away. 

Closing my brother’s door, I went back to the dark red stain on the hallway carpet. 

I don't even remember curling up, passing out right there. 

When I woke up, it was daylight, and it was still snowing. 

I was almost snowed in, stepping straight into untouched white.

I was trying to make coffee when there were three singular knocks on the door. 

Wes, still in his pyjamas, and carrying a  bag full of Dunkin Donuts. 

“Want one? They're fresh from yesterday, so I'm handing them out.” he thrust the bag in my face, his mouth full, chocolate dribbling down his chin. 

I noticed significant perspiration  glistening on his forehead, soaking strands of hair glued to his skin. 

His eyes were… bigger, somehow, the proportions of his face were different. I had to be hallucinating, or maybe concussed. 

But no… when I blinked rapidly, the boy's face was somehow narrower. 

He was either delirious from his fever, or was slowly splintering apart mentally. When I hesitantly took a rainbow sprinkle donut, his smile started to falter. 

He was trembling, barely able to keep himself upright. 

“There's a meeting in the school auditorium,” he smiled, handing me a caramel donut too. “It starts at twelve, so don't be late, all right?”

I swallowed down donut barf. “Meeting?” 

He nodded. “Yep! There are around two hundred of us. Thirteen to eighteen year olds. Whatever this thing is, it's sparing teenagers.” He shrugged. 

“Well, that's our hypothesis, anyway. Everyone over the age of eighteen, and under the age of thirteen have…” Wes mimed an explosion with his hands, his eyes growing manic. “Bye-bye!”

His words felt like knives pricking into my back. 

“Everyone.” I managed to spit out. 

“Yep! *Everyone*!”

His expression darkened, and I started to see the splinters in his mask, his lips curling. “I found my parents reduced to red sludge, and my baby sister was her own flavor of strawberry shake in her crib.” 

Wes’s eyes widened, and he startled me with a choked laugh. 

“Wait.” He ran his hands through his hair. “Do you think that's what it is? What if it's aliens turning us into milkshakes?!”

Wes laughed, holding out his palms– slick with red– “So, that's what this is, right? My little sis. She just turned into fucking Nesquick, man.”

I wondered if his fever was doing all of the heavy lifting. He was speaking in tongues. 

“You're sick.” I said, laying my hand on his forehead. 

I had to pull it back, biting down on a hiss. He was burning up. 

Literally. I could barely touch him. 

When I tried brushing soaking strands of hair out his eyes, he wafted my hand away.

“I'm not sick,” Wes mumbled. “It's from the crash.”

I took a slow step back, suddenly very aware of him being contagious. “You're burning up.”

“I’m fiiiiine!” he rolled his eyes, but then he coughed, which surprised even him, a startled, choked splutter sending him stumbling off balance. I pretended not to see the slew of red seeping down his chin. 

He inclined his head, and I caught something in the slither of his iris. 

Wes had brown eyes. I knew that because I had a silent crush on him all the way through my freshman year, before he started dating Tommy Fields. 

I used to get lost in his eyes, warm coffee grounds with flecks of orange. 

But right then, I couldn't ignore the unmistakable green streak bleeding into his iris. “It's just a cold, dude.” he spread out his arms, doing a clumsy twirl.

“What do you expect? It's snowing! We’re all gon’ be a lil’ sniffly.”

To demonstrate, he swiped his nose, pretending not to see the scarlet smear. 

“Oh fuhhhhck, maybe I'm the one turning into strawberry Nesquick.” Wes giggled, and his laugh turned into a cough, this time into his hands. He held up the bag of donuts, offering me a two fingered salute. 

“I'll be…”

Another spluttered cough choked his words, his chest heaving. 

“Fine!”

I thought Wes was going to collapse when he swayed left and then right, his eyes flashing, before Wes seemed to catch a hold of himself, finding balance. 

He pivoted on his heel and waded back down my driveway, struggling through growing snow drifts. “Seeya at twelve, Summer!”

I didn't end up going to the meeting after the snow officially locked me inside. 

But thanks to a mass-text sent to our parents' phones (smart), I was informed we were a group of two hundred kids, aged thirteen to eighteen years old– and we were well and truly alone. 

According to several senior kids, our town was cut off from the rest of the world by the freak weather. I checked the news, and somehow, there was nobody talking about it. The huge snow storm that had hit a small californian town? 

There was nothing. 

Instead, the rest of the world was gearing up for the holidays. 

It almost felt like we had been yeeted from reality itself. 

The Internet was acting weird. I could see what was happening, but I couldn't *post* anything. When I flicked through TV channels, they were always the same ones. 

The mass text also detailed that, starting that afternoon, we had to report to the school auditorium for daily crisis meetings. 

Like every other kid in town, I was numb from losing my family and life itself crumbling around me in a single afternoon—and yet the underdeveloped part of my brain still wanted to take advantage of zero adult authority. 

Retail therapy it was; I went shopping. 

I forced myself through towering snow-drifts, lugging a wheelbarrow with me, and stocked up on ramen, soda, all the fresh goods that were still there, and of course, candy. The rest of the store had been stripped of every branded soda and candy you could think of, an army of thirteen year olds leading the charge. 

I was supposed to attend the crisis meeting, but in my head, what was the point? We were all going to die anyway, so what was the point of trying? 

So, I went home, and slept away twelve days. 

I didn't eat or shower, and the fresh food I’d dumped on my bedroom floor was starting to smell. 

Day 1: I slept for most of it, only getting up to down a bottle of water. 

Day 2: I was barely conscious, only half aware of the lights flickering out. 

Day 3: Loud banging woke me up, and I dragged myself downstairs, opening the door to two boys. I vaguely knew them. Henry Mara and Dalton Atlus. 

The two of them were shivering, and when I peeked past them, the snow had let up slightly. 

“Freddie Fawner and his group of freshman freaks took over our house.” 

Henry held up a bag of apples. I think he was offering them as a gift. “Do you mind if we stay here for a while?” his hopeful expression and frostbite lowered my barriers. 

I nodded and let them in, offering them blankets and letting them have the living room. 

I went back to bed, crashing onto my pillows, the world tilting. 

Day 4: Henry and Dalton were arguing over cereal. I ignored them, and went back to sleep. 

Day 5: My Mom’s phone woke me up at 5am. **Wes Cameron is dead**, the words headed my notifications. 

**His body was found inside a pharmacy.** 

Something ice cold slipped through me. Wes had a cold, right? 

I sat up in bed, suddenly very conscious of the dryness in my throat. 

I remembered that slither of green creeping into his iris. 

His clammy forehead. 

Day 6: I was woken up by another text. This time, ten fifteen year olds were found dead in their homes. All suspected of the flu. 

Day 7: Henry started coughing downstairs. I jumped out of bed and taped my door shut. I opened my window, and took three tylenol. Another text vibrated my phone: three more fifteen year olds dead. 

Day 8: I couldn't get out of bed, my bones felt like lead. I coughed up something onto my pillow, but I didn't look at it. There were three texts on my phone. 

The first one was alerting us that they were going to stop reporting deaths, the second was that they felt sick, and the third was that they wanted their Mommy. 

Day 9: I was burning, rolling around in sweat-soaked sheets with a mouth full of blood. Henry had stopped coughing. 

I could hear the boys moving around. 

I hallucinated my brother standing over me with abnormally pointy ears, a grin splitting his mouth wide. 

I felt his ice cold fingers tip-toe across my clammy forehead, and when I looked at him, blinking rapidly, I could have sworn his eyes were... different. 

But he was beautiful. Grotesquely beautiful, like a fairy. 

Wes climbed through my window, followed by the girl from the crash.

Holly.

Day 10, I think I died, my body no longer mine. 

Day 11: I was still dead, on my bedroom floor, choking up wet, slithering red chunks. I couldn't speak or breathe, or eat, my body was scorching, my screams strangling through my lips after bypassing my cooked vocal chords. 

Day 12: 

I could move again. Not well, but well enough to stand. My body felt strange, too light and yet also heavy, like I was both floating, and dragging myself. 

Calling out for the boys, I headed downstairs, covering my mouth with a soiled pair of pajama pants, and stepping straight into sticky red pooling across Mom’s prized rug. 

Henry lay on his back, choking on bubbling scarlet dribbling down his chin. 

Dalton was vomiting in the sink, his trembling body convulsing—lumps of fleshy red splattered on the floor.

Henry’s face looked sharper, paler, his eyes sunken, ears *pointier*. 

I found myself choking down hysterical giggles that were choking me. Before the thought could graze my mind, my brain was suddenly on fire. I dropped to my knees, coughing, red filling my mouth. 

My limbs contorted, my head swimming. The sickly stench of *peppermint* seeping into my nose. Bells rang loud and invasive in my ears.

A voice echoed through my skull: 

“Don’t worry, children. The transformation is painful, but only if your body rejects it. Right now, your human tissue is converting to *elf* tissue. I know it hurts! But I lost quite a lot of my workforce this year! So, I have no choice! The show must go on!” he boomed. 

“Human children aren't quite ideal, but they should do the job. I need at least 500 of you to compete with this year's demand.”

He laughed, and Henry collapsed, his head smacking on the edge of the sink. 

**“I'm sure your parents will become fine meat-scraps for my reindeer!”**

I screamed, my body contorting, his words forcing me onto my side. 

I choked up what I was guessing was my internal organs. 

All I could think about was my brother. 

Did this *thing* work on the dead too? 

Wes. 

Was he a failure, or was dying just the start? 

When my body lurched onto its side, and I choked up something wet and slimy, the floorboards creaked behind me. 

Henry and Dalton stood. They didn't speak. 

They just walked out of the door, straight into a blizzard, stardust dripping from them.

I waited for my body to twist, just like theirs. 

But I kept bleeding, all over myself, sticking my hair to my neck. 

My eyes flickered, Santa's laugh bouncing in my skull.

I waited to die, or at least become an elf. 

But I didn't. 

I still felt light and wrong, and when I looked in the mirror, my face was twisted out of shape, my ears too pointy, too *sharp*. 

I resemble fae, almost. 

When I was well enough, I left my house, finding a wasteland of snow and bodies, kids who rejected the transformation. 

Santa had taken the others, and left me. 

When the snow did start to melt, I had people in masks banging on my door. I let them throw me in an unmarked van and take me out of town. 

I spent the next several months being experimented on. 

The man who tested me said the experts has known about Santa's existence for a while. 

But they hadn't seen what they call a *conversion* on this scale. 

Dr Mycroft, the man who prodded and poked me every day, told me the conversion is the process of human cells and tissue being forcibly transformed. 

The only way to stop it is to reject the idea of Santa Clause. 

So, that's what I want all of you to do. Right now. 

Before this thing spreads globally, please. 

Stop believing in my friends, who forcibly became elves against their will. 

Wes, Holly, Dom, Henry and Dalton, all the kids he took away. 

Stop believing in this psychopath who murdered my parents. 

Stop. 

Believing. 

In.

1or638p,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1or638p/does_anyone_know_what_reaching_is/,Does anyone know what “reaching” is?,"When people talk about my sister, they always start the same way. “It’s such a shame,” they say. “She had so much potential.” They think it’s comforting, as if potential is some kind of protection — like the mere suggestion that a person could have done great things keeps their memory safe from what actually happened. I hate that word. I hate it because it sounds like an excuse people make when they don’t want to face the truth that we all waste something. Everyone throws away time, talent, love, purpose — whatever their particular currency is — and the idea that some people “had potential” while others didn’t is a lie we tell ourselves to feel safer. It’s a shield. It lets you look at someone else’s wreckage and pretend you’re immune to it. That word, potential, feels like a kindness but it’s really a quiet form of distance. My sister had potential too.

She wasn’t just bright — she was brilliant in the kind of way that made people uncomfortable. She’d studied physics and metaphysical science, the kind of dual interest that made her both fascinating and impossible to categorize. She said she wanted to understand “the fabric between realities,” which sounded like poetic nonsense when we were kids.

Later, I realized she meant it literally. She believed consciousness was an instrument — that the mind could perceive and even touch things outside the measurable world. It was her obsession, and, I guess, her undoing. When she died, everyone said it was the heroin. That was easier to understand than whatever she’d actually been chasing.

Cleaning out her apartment felt like trespassing. Everything was still in place, right down to the half-drunk cup of coffee on the counter. I kept thinking she’d walk in and ask what I was doing there. Most of her notebooks were full of formulas and diagrams, notes about wave functions and energy fields that went over my head.

But one small black diary stood out.

No formulas. No numbers. Just words — strange, lyrical fragments, and something that looked like rules. The first page said, “Reaching — an experiment in expanded perception.”

At first, I thought it was some sort of guided meditation, maybe something she’d written to help her come down from a high. But the more I read, the less it felt like that. There were instructions that sounded simple enough, but the phrasing bothered me.

“To begin the First Reach,” one line said, “close your eyes until the dark starts moving. Keep your attention still — it will try to divide.” Another said, “When you feel the hum, don’t flinch. It isn’t outside.” There were references to “layers of contact,” and something called “the Fold,” which she described as the place awareness goes when it stops pretending to be alone.

I didn’t understand it, but I couldn’t stop reading. The entries became increasingly erratic near the end. One said, “Third Reach — something answered. I think I saw what’s after.” Another was just, “Don’t trust the echo.” And then nothing. A week later, she was gone.

I told myself it didn’t mean anything, that it was just more of her mystical rambling. But I couldn’t let it go. I thought about her sitting there, trying this “experiment,” eyes closed, breathing slow, believing she was peeling back the edge of reality. I thought about how much I’d judged her, how easy it was to say she’d wasted her life. Maybe she hadn’t wasted it at all. Maybe she’d found something no one else had the nerve to touch.

Two nights ago, I sat down in my room with the diary open in front of me and decided to try the First Reach. I don’t know what I was hoping for — closure, maybe, or some sign she’d been right. The instructions were simple enough: sit in total darkness, close your eyes, and wait until the dark starts moving. I didn’t know what that meant, but after a while, I started to understand. There’s a point where the black behind your eyelids stops feeling flat. It deepens, like it has weight. I tried to keep my breathing steady. After a few minutes, I felt something like a vibration behind my skull — a faint humming that wasn’t sound but sensation.

The book said not to flinch. So I didn’t.

And then, in the dark, I saw something — not an image, exactly, but a structure. Like distance folding in on itself. I couldn’t see it, but I could feel it the way you feel your way through a dark room.

Something in me reached back. For a split second, it felt like my thoughts had edges, like I could touch the space behind them. And then everything stopped. The hum vanished. My ears rang in its absence.

I turned on the light and just sat there, breathing hard. Nothing else happened that night. But ever since, I can’t stop noticing that the dark doesn’t look the same anymore.

I used to think darkness was just absence — the default state of a room without light. Now it feels like an active thing, a presence that presses back. When I turn the lights off, I feel watched, but not by eyes. It’s more like the dark itself is aware of me.

The edges of things seem too sharp. Shadows don’t merge cleanly anymore; they cling to corners like they’re reluctant to let go. The first few nights, I barely slept. Every time I closed my eyes, I felt that hum waiting for me, just beneath thought, the same faint vibration I’d felt that night. It doesn’t happen when I’m awake in daylight. It’s only when I let myself drift toward sleep, when the world starts dissolving around the edges, that I sense it again — patient, steady, almost familiar.

I told myself I was imagining it. Grief does strange things to the mind, and I’d been thinking about her too much. But then, last night, I dreamt of her. Not the way I used to dream of people — blurred, symbolic, half-memory — but vivid, solid. She was sitting on the edge of her bed, her hands folded, looking at me like she’d been waiting for me to wake up.

The room behind her wasn’t hers, though. It was endless. The walls stretched too far, then curved, like the space itself was bending inward. When I asked her where we were, she just said, “You shouldn’t have reached.” Then her voice deepened, splitting like an echo that didn’t follow the sound. I woke up gasping, the word echo still ringing in my head.

The diary was open on my desk this morning. I know I didn’t leave it that way. The page had changed — it was the same handwriting, but there was an extra line beneath her old note about the Third Reach. It said, “The first is observation. The second is correspondence. Don’t confuse them.” I don’t know if I wrote it in some half-conscious state, or if it was always there and I just missed it. But it doesn’t look fresh. The ink’s faded, like it’s been there for years.

I’ve been thinking about what “correspondence” could mean. In her notes, she wrote about consciousness as a mirror — not the way we see things, but the way things see back. Maybe that’s what the Reach does: it opens the channel both ways. You look into it, and it looks into you. Maybe that’s what she meant when she wrote about “the Fold,” about awareness stopping its act of pretending to be alone. Maybe that’s why she didn’t stop after the first or second.

I’m not ready to try again, but I can feel it calling. That’s the only word that fits — calling. It’s not a voice, it’s not even sound, it’s a pull. Like some part of me recognizes the shape of what I touched and wants to finish it. I keep thinking about her final entry: “Third Reach — something answered.” I used to read that as a warning. Lately, it feels more like an invitation.

I replaced the battery in my escape on Tuesday (wow what a pain by the way).  It ran fine the last two days, and immediately this morning after making two separate drop offs to my kids school.  On my way into work, I stopped to get coffee.  When I got back into the car to leave, I noticed none of the electronics came on after opening the door.  When I went to start the car, literally nothing happened.  Nothing.  No noises or sounds of the starter being engaged.  After waiting a minute or two, it miraculously started.

On the drive into work, the performance was really sluggish, the tachometer had a hard time getting below 2000 RPM's despite being at multiple stand stills, the live fuel economy was fluctuating all over the place, and the engine temp never went up from it's resting location.  Typically, when I'd take my foot off the accelerator on the freeway, it would read 99.9MPG, but today it was reading 0.0MPG.  Once I got to work, I popped the hood, and the engine sounded much louder than usual.  I double checked that the air filter housing wasn't jostled or something popped loose.  All the connections seemed okay.

I've read these engines begin to act up around 100k miles, and I am approaching that.

I was so thrown off at her reaction I couldn't think through the list of people it may belong to which was my sister. I was trying to navigate her total meltdown. 

Anyway, I didn't tell anyone what happened, I was too embarrassed and just said it fizzled out. I get back on track and start moving on. People begin to realize something happened and  a few friends ask me directly so I eventually tell them that my ex found my sister's earring and chapstick and she exploded on me. A few people said I should call her or talk to her and explain. Others said no way. 

I left it alone, but I guess through a grapevine she heard that it was my sister's earring and not believing me, she got in touch with my sister. My sister knew we weren't together but had no details beyond that. Well, ex proceeds to say she feels bad and it was a huge misunderstanding if it was her stuff. My sister, unaware of what's going on, says it was her stuff and probed to find out what happened. Ex proceeds to tell my sister everything. 

Sister called me which made me think someone was dead. She tells me she talked to ex and had the whole story. Sister was annoyed that I hadn't told her and I asked her not to share anything with anyone. Not an hour later I get an email from my ex begging for forgiveness. She outlines how her ex was a cheater and she is overly reactive and said she needed help and had been in therapy. She wanted to ask that I come to a single session with her or we could meet for coffee. 

I initially ignored the email. Like a week later another comes, this time more apologetic. And along with that email two friends reached out. They said she's been working on herself and her therapist suggested, based on my willingness, to attend therapy with her. I suspect the therapist will try to pin something on me, so I'm really not interested in any of that. 

Before this meltdown, we had never had a fight like that. It was out of nowhere and I had never seen that before. It was strange and not at all in character for her. What I've gathered is that after we broke up she redoubled with a therapist and was working through these issues. By way of background she had been engaged to a guy and he had been having a long-term affair. She had found suspicious items but he played them off but it eventually came out. 

In my case I genuinely was *not* cheating. She indicated my career is full of cheaters, but I'm not. I don't have weird unexplained absences. I'm not out at clubs alone. I don't ever flirt. It came entirely out of nowhere. Not to mention that she *knew* my sister was coming over because I was doing something for her and she wanted to make sure I wasn't going to back out and needed to prep me. She apparently forgot and when she saw the items, freaked out. 

Honestly, the whole thing was stunning. We had talked about moving in. We had been in a great place. We were planning a vacation. I was shocked. And then the last time I saw her she just bellowed ""fuck you"" as she stormed out of my apartment. It was all so strange. 

I've not responded to her. I'm not sure what to say. I don't want to ignore for, but I really don't know what to say or what to do. Part of me is curious about what happened and to hear that her therapist  thinks there is value in talking is strange.  Part of me wants to put it behind me. It was embarrassing and awkward having to explain to people I was single and she yelled at me. I've already gone to social functions single and I'm okay on my own and don't need to run back into a relationship. 

Maybe if it was even just closure, it's worth it. I don't know.  I've never had a situation like this and honestly I don't want to share this information with lots of people because I don't want to talk to people in my inner circle about it. And I'm not sure why. I think it's just embarrassing. 

  
tl;dr ex-GF found chapstick and an earring at my place. She went nuclear, was screaming and arguing with me for hours. It was totally out of character and out of the blue. She dumped me and left. Then learned it was my sister's stuff and wants me to attend a therapy session with her. I am embarrassed by the whole situation and not sure how to proceed.

1or5ta4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1or5ta4,"Yet another Quonset General Store Home Base. Day 500, Stalker.","500 days and about 400 hours of game time later, I finally came around to being satisfied with my Quonset shop home base, which was initially inspired by some builds I saw on here, while I put my own spin to the ideas. A build fueled by a form of OCD I developed from growing up in Ma's pet store.

Please pardon the mess. I've moved as much as I've been able from all the corners of Great Bear Island.

It looked a lot like this since around day 460, so I spent much of that time since crafting clothes and filling up as many of the jerry and gas cans with lamp oil as possible. Aside from the five red cans on the big ""living room"" shelf (one tucked behind a partially filled can on the middle shelf, beside the quality tools), they have all been topped off, making that a total of 108.51L of lamp oil.

One of the first things I did after starting to stack cans, was fill the front cooler with a total of 260 liters of water. That was finished before day 75, and some rapid need for water for the Trader aside before being replaced, I haven't touched them since. All-in-all, I've opened only 61 cans across this game, mostly once the space for said type was full on the shelf and until I decided to stack any remaining cans in the backroom. I have since lived entirely on meat, fish, cat tail stalks, pemmican bars, and the rare fine dish made on renewable ingredients.

I spent about two hours painstakingly cataloguing and adding up, and in the store room alone, I have accumulated exactly 842.262kcal worth of food (incl. potatoes, carrots, and a few processed foods that I moved to the backroom shelf afterwards). OG game and modded food alike. Adding to this is 48kg of cured meat, 447,3kg of various cooked saltwater fish, and 819 hours worth of fuel. I thus have enough to last me more than a whole more year without leaving the building, were it not for the accursed Cabin Fever.

I counted the stacked coal in the backroom: 304 pcs. Beside them, 70 pcs of cedar and in the half-shelf, 30 pcs of fir firewood. More of all is out back in the supply bin I yoinked from the Pensive Lookout.

For anyone interested, each box of ammo behind the counter counts 20 rifle cartridges and 42 revolver cartridges, making it 378 revolver cartridges and 180 rifle cartridges back there, with 41 revolver and 60 rifle cartridges on the workbench; much of the latter coming from the Trader.

Salt, some of the pickles, five tins of coffee, and Trader items aside, everything in the store room was found across Great Bear Island. Some of the found items that didn't fit, alongside everything else that I got from the Trader, has been stacked up in the backroom or spread out across the living room for visual storytelling.

Some stuff that SC+ allowed me to snag from across the GBI, was the wood stove from Trapper's Homestead and the Abandoned Lookout's pot belly stove. Maybe because I installed the mod mid-game, there was a glitch that prevented me from grabbing a PBS from the fishing huts, and while a new game allowed me to nab the flare gun cases, in this game, I cannot, as they just reset to their original locations once I pass through a loading screen door.

If anyone is wondering what the wood stove is standing on, it's a coffee table clipped through the floor. Gives the setup some flair and bridges the chimney pipe with the ceiling. Might go to the Desolation Point and snag that safe just because. Haven't decided yet since I don't know where to put it.

I did find the fourth and fifth teddy bears, but somehow lost them while moving stuff from the Camp Office to the Quonset. Game glitch, I fear. Karma for my thieving.

Also outside is about 500 pcs of photo ID cards that the SC+ mod bugs into spawning every other time I pass through a loading screen door or load into the game. My OCD is going nuts from this, and is why I will proceed with the next game without said mod. It's just not worth having it if I have to micromanage hiding the fudging things to retain my sanity.

Next up is to light about 520 more fires for that badge, as all my badges and progress disappeared years ago after I migrated to my new PC build. Before or after that, I'll finally enter the Blackrock Gold Mine, and then I don't know. Might take this game to day 1000, or I may do it on my next game where Settled Minds frees me off the accursed Cabin Fever.

What I do know is, that the next game I'll make my Home Base in the camp office, as inspired by another fellow on here's quality base build a few weeks ago.

I hope somebody can find the easter egg I left in there.",55,1762548448.0,thelongdark,7,0.98,False

The problem is that he never texts me, I have to start the conversation, but then he is very nice with the replies. I actually don't know how to interpret all this. I would like him to invite me and not to be me again inviting him out. So of course I became limerent.

Fyi we work in the same place so once or twice a week I see him, and I will keep seeing him, so I really don't know what to do or not do.

1or5sfu,https://www.reddit.com/r/DropPodGreen/comments/1or5sfu/ship_sizes/,Ship Sizes,"I was rereading chapter ten yesterday and came across the stated crew complement of the Murphy Class Corvette that Rhidi and the others were assigned to, 7000 crew, at least according to Drill Sergeant McPhiston. This possibly indicates that the spaceships found in universe are of colossal size and scope. 

I'll explain; 7000 personnel is a larger complement than the USS Gerald R Ford Class Aircraft Carrier has at 6000 and that is a 337 meter long boat with a displacement of 100,000 long tons and lacks all the life support equipment that a spaceship would need on top of lacking the armor, shielding, and heat management systems that would also be required. Trying to fit all of this into a ship that would be at scale with modern vessels would be impossible without exceptionally advanced technology or a lot of hand waving or divergence from reality. I think it's quite likely that spaceships here are much larger than were expecting.

Spaceships are like giant submarines, and generally have a smaller crew than would be expected for their size. If we compare the Ohio Class Ballistic Missile issile Submarine with the Ticonderoga Class Cruiser we can see that the cruiser has a crew size of 30 officers and 300 enlisted, contrasted with the submarine which has 15 officers and 140 enlisted. They are of similar dimensions but have very different crew capabilities owing to the differing circumstances of their missions and medium of operation. The cruiser operates on the surface and can get away without life support systems while the submarine cannot, leading to huge vessels in the void. 

One other thing that makes me think this way is the size of crew accomodations we've seen aboard the ships. The Wild Hunt has it's own PX described as being the size of a gas station and The Moose has a full mall plus multiple bars, taverns, coffee shops, and specialty stores for whatever the crew may need. Rhidi's own quarters are also discovered in terms that make it sound more like a single bedroom apartment than a room aboard a naval vessel. There is enough space aboard The Wild Hunt that a junior enlisted officers of a specialist MOS can have a superior level of accomodations to officers on modern naval vessels. That speaks to an absurd amount of space aboard these ships, at least in my opinion.

Given this I suspect that the Wild Hunt is at least the size of a modern Aircraft Carrier, if not larger, and that The Moose is at least the size of several Star Destroyers put together. I will also point out I don't think that Earth has many ships this size or a particularly numerous navy in general. I expected likely hundreds of ships across many classes to exist with The Moose and its support fleet being one of maybe 10-14 such fleets Humanity has in general. It's an arbitrary estimate, but one that feels feasible based on my understanding of the setting's scope and the presence of multiple other space faring species allied with Humanity.

1or5rfd,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1or5rfd/my_october_review_of_japan_with_takeaways/,My October Review of Japan with Takeaways,"A bit about me: 30’s white man traveling with my white husband. We traveled to Japan from the Southeast of the US in mid October for 11 days. I was a Nintendo and Pokemon kid. My husband was a PlayStation and Monster Hunter kid. My husband loves fish and tea. I enjoy some tea and am not a fan of fish. Traveling to Japan has been on my bucket list of places to go and experience since I was a child.

Culture: The public does open mouth sneezing/coughing. They don’t cover their mouths, they just let everything out without obstruction or care. They are quiet on transit. They aren’t silent, but definitely more quiet than any public transit in the US. They have a queuing culture and line up for everything. The onsen’s are wonderful. They have plastic everywhere and in everything. There have plastic napkins, plastic “paper” takeout bags, plastic bags to put your plastic bag in that has plastic wrapped candy that is on a plastic tray. I never experienced anyone being mean/rude to me for being a tourist (maybe it’s because we have our stuff together and are planned out/not in the way). They were very kind, considerate, and accommodating to tourists. Japan is the cleanest country I have ever been to. I barely saw any litter on the streets and even saw shopkeepers mopping the streets in front of their businesses. I came across several animal cafe locations. Initially I planned to go to an otter cafe, but I changed my mind once I read more into it. I’m glad I didn’t participate in that activity as I am an animal lover and feel that it would have put a stain on the trip. Stumbling across a pet shop at the top of a shopping complex with animals in super tight cages with no stimulation and overcrowded, I believe the stories have read.

Personal: My husband and I both experienced vertigo throughout the trip. It could have been jet lag or using the trains (unfamiliar transportation to us). We think it’s all of the earthquakes the country experiences, which is something our bodies are not accustomed to in the southeast. We never had difficulty finding a restroom or a trash can. Just eat where you bought the food and then throw the trash away there. If you are going to eat/drink on transportation, just throw that away at those stations. We packed lite for this trip with just two backpacks and two carry on roller bags. We fit our backpacks inside our roller bags flying over them fit shopping in amongst the four bags with no issues on weight. Highly suggest packing lite and doing laundry during the trip to save space/weight. On the last day of our trip we packed our bags, saw we had more room, so went out to buy more snacks to bring back with us.

Nature: Sadly we were too soon for most fall colors. I was surprised to see kudzu as prolific/aggressive as in the southeast (what monster thought that would be a good plant to bring over). I was surprised to see goldenrod is invasive in Japan (very pretty yellow flowers everywhere and appears to be the only thing that can compete with kudzu as they are often the only things growing together). The countryside is very pretty with the mountains and valleys. The climate was the same as the southeast US. I was expecting it to be cooler, but it wasn’t.

Food: I don’t like fish generally. I assumed I would have limited options on menus due to this. I ordered a pork broth ramen with no mention of fish, there was fish stock in the broth. Fish is in most things. It’s in the air. I saw it in ice cream. Pizza was the worst I’ve ever eaten and gives me nausea thinking of the Kyoto style pork and broccoli pizza that for some reason was smothered in mustard. The convenience stores were amazing with the affordable diversity of food and drink options. The egg salad sandwiches were a frequent breakfast option for some morning protein for me. The desserts were great. Red beans were a surprisingly nice experience. The mochi was good! I’ve only experienced mochi with a rubbery texture, so to get mochi that is soft and with great pull was nice! Curry is great! We tried several KitKat flavors and were not blown away by any. My husband is a huge KitKat and wafer fan. Happy we tried the 9 flavors, but they aren’t anything we will miss.

Shopping: I LOVED gashapon. It is fun and there are a ton of stores with new/different ones at each place. I did these every day as a self imposed challenge. There is so much noise in Tokyo. Everything is beeping/talking. Tax free shopping is a hassle as shops do it differently. Definitely enjoyed shopping local once we got out of the big cities. We fit all of our shopping in two carry on roller bags and two backpacks with some room to spare. 

Technology: Google translate app is great, iPhone translate app is garbage. I used suica on apple wallet and it worked great. I only put 1,000 yen on it and it worked for my Tokyo city transportation without having to reload more funds.

Transportation: We flew in/out on Zipair lay flat seats in/out of NRT. Both directions had turbulence but I thought we would fall out of the sky on the way over. The only way I would return to Japan is on a lay flat seat, I couldn’t imagine doing 11 hours in a standard airplane seat. Definitely worth the increased seat price. We did the direct Shinkansen from Tokyo to Kyoto and sat on the right side and were lucky enough to see Mt Fuji with snow on top! Very pretty countryside and scenery. We purchased the Hokuriku Arch pass and used that for our remaining Shinkansen rides. We could NEVER get the machines to work with getting our tickets. Staff were always helpful and available though. I’d recommend this rail pass as we saved a bunch of money on tickets and the arch was the Japan that I expected and wanted to see on my trip. We used taxis to get from and to the airport, it’s more expensive than trains, but we just didn’t want to bother with public transportation with our luggage. I would do this again for ease.

Hotels: Their pillows are definitely lacking. They’d provide a hard pillow and soft pillow but using one wasn’t enough and two was too much. They’ll provide extra on request though. Half the hotels had uncomfortably firm mattresses. Check in/out was easy. They provide toothbrush and razors, toothbrushes great, but I’d bring your own razor. Shaving cream was provided only at half of the hotels. The toilets are great, water pressure in showers is great. The bathroom set up is vastly different from US but you get the hang of it. They have umbrellas you can borrow which is awesome. Our last hotel had a luggage scale you could borrow which was great. They also had a money exchange so we could exchange all the smaller coins for larger coins.

Tokyo, Shibuya: lots of shopping, busy, crossing doesn’t appeal to me and is just a crosswalk, not a spot for experiencing culture, definitely a concrete jungle feel. 

Kyoto: lots of temples, more cultural experiences (tea house), things further away so more walking but pretty ally ways made it enjoyable, felt more like a typical US city to me with nice cultural spots throughout.

Iga: castle was nice to look at but nothing crazy good to see inside or buy, ninja experience was interesting and a little cheesy but in a good way.

Wazuka: tea tour was nice, Shinto shrine experience was unexpected and very nice.

Fukui: a lot quieter and more enjoyable, lots of dinosaurs and fun shopping, finally got good coffee here.

Katsuyama: dinosaur museum is up to date and huge/impressive and has most things also in English, difficult to get to though. Definitely a world class museum! Stayed at a ski resort that ended up having just as many children as adults. There were even babies in the onsen. I wouldn’t have stayed there had I known it was going to be Disney World. None of the reviews for the hotel mentioned being overrun with kids.

Kanazawa: very pretty, lots to see and experience, very walkable, gardens are great, castle is nice, market is primarily food not shopping. 

Nagano: stayed at an onsen hotel and it was FANTASTIC! Loved that onsen experience. Only dining experience where we were turned away for being tourists at dinner.

Matsumoto: castle was great, frog street was amazing, oyaki were the best we had!

Narai: got there in the afternoon, no food was available, venders were shutting shops down, it was cold. Streets looked nice and historic. 

Tokyo, Ueno: great train station! Andersen bakery had some apple cream pastries that were DIVINE! Natural history museum had a fantastic video about evolution that walks you through the big events. The rest of the museum would be good for a regional museum, not a national museum. It has the space to have more, and it needs to. The National Museum was definitely the better of the two museums we visited. It was a very pretty main building and had multiple other buildings to go into. We didn’t see everything because we didn’t have the time to devote an entire day, but the half day we spent there was nice. Lots of nice art and artifacts from Japan and abroad.

Tokyo, Akihabara: the maid cafe girls on the street made me feel icky. I felt like they are being objectified and had to pull people into their establishments or they wouldn’t be paid. The was the dirtiest area of Tokyo or Japan we came across. We saw more foreigners here than locals. We went into a few shops, but the amount of barely clothed women figures is strange and off putting. 

Pokémon Centers:
Shibuya: sad, small, crowded, disappointing, if they had exclusive merch it wasn’t anything I noticed or that wowed me.
Kyoto: larger, more products, less disappointing, decent exclusive merch.
Kanazawa: finally a good one! Lots of products even some brand new ones I hadn’t seen announced yet. Good exclusive merch.
DX: good exclusive merch, busy, great selection.
Tokyo Station Pokemon Store: small selection, decently busy, disappointing exclusive merch.
NRT Pokemon Store: good selection, not busy, very nice experience, good exclusive merch.

Pokelids:
I did go after these throughout the trip. They were a fun thing to collect if it wasn’t too far out of the way and we had time. I would love if there was a way to get these lids as stickers or keychains!

Takeaway: I am happy to have gone. I knew fish would be a problem for me and it was. I was disappointed by the Pokémon Centers, but they did get better as the trip went on. Highly recommend the gashapon experience! Loved the variety of tea options. Loved the convenience store food options/prices. Sweets were great. I kept seeing posts about people being backed up due to the lack of fiber in the tourist diet, but I did not have that issue. The trip started out on a bummer note, but it got better as we got away from the standard traditional tourist places/things. I’m happy I went, but due to the travel time required to go there, I do not see myself returning this decade or maybe ever. Definitely would recommend folks go if they have a desire to see Japan, just get away from the golden route!",0,1762548328.0,JapanTravelTips,2,0.2,False

T/W: Self-Harm, Suicide, Murder.

**Introduction:**

I am not sure I can describe the ecstasy and invincibility that a mania can give you. I’m not sure I can adequately tell you the way it feels to be so near to the sun; to tell you about the sensation of hot wax as it runs down your lower back and onto your calves. It feels like meteoric victory. It tastes like golden sunlight. For the briefest of moments you can feel the dawn breaking; you can see with electric eyes the sun shining bright and clear before a decadent horizon. I can’t describe to you the ineffable or the immaterial. 

What I can tell you about is the absence. I can tell you about the fall. I can tell you about Hell incarnate as doctors and nurses rip the wings from your broken body with the chemical precision of a child pulling legs from a spider. I can tell you about the depths.

I checked into a hospital at the urging of my wife. She was concerned for my physical and mental wellbeing. It was all well and good, but I didn’t think I had a problem. How could I explain that I wasn’t crazy? Have you ever noticed how difficult it is not to sound insane when someone fully believes that you are? Anything you say is a kind of confirmation. 



“But you’re not making any sense!” 

“It makes sense to me, Tracy. What doesn’t make sense?” 

“Baby, you said that you can see your father? Am I understanding? Is that what you’re saying?” 

“Yes, love.”

“Edgar. Honey, I’m so sorry.. baby we’ve been over this… I.. baby, your father is dead.”

“He’s right there!”

“No.. no honey he isn’t!”

“B..But he… B..But I can see him. I can see him right there! You.. you can’t see him?” 



It was impossible to convince someone that was so purposefully obtuse to a plain reality. He stood in the doorway of my kitchen and smiled at me. I forgave him then. I actually whispered the words “I forgive you.” He had this kind of half smirk that twisted his face into a running joke. His 5 o’clock shadow melted along with his aquiline features into the inky darkness of the kitchen. The glint of his eyes as he turned could light a candle. I could never get him to say something —anything. No matter how hard I begged or pleaded, he remained silent as a statue. He walked away from me and out the back door. I sat on the floor pleading for him to come back to me. I told him I forgave him. I asked him to forgive me.

Surprisingly, I felt hot tears make slow trails down my face. It was like wax melting. It was like a car crash. My wife pulled me into a hug and held me as I rocked. She thought I was talking to her. She thought I was talking about an argument we had a few hours before about nothing. She kept whispering that she was there, forgiving me, telling me that it was okay, and that we could get me some help. I didn’t feel like I needed help. I felt like my father could’ve ended this pain and confusion by announcing himself to my wife. I felt a deep betrayal — Shakespearean and malevolent. 

The phosphorescent glow emanating from my blood had given me energy until this moment. The sun and the warm rain had kept me lofted above the canopy of Heaven. The electric wire in my spine had made my vision blur with hazy light. Within moments of the embrace, I had collapsed in on myself like a dying star. I crumpled into my wife and sobbed. It was a few minutes more before I noticed the blood dripping down my arms —before I began to feel the itch and pain of what I’d done to myself. I dropped the boning knife I’d used to write my own destruction and surrendered. 

This was not the first time I’d used a knife to orchestrate my future. My father had taught me, and I was pretty good with a knife.



**Intake:** 

I won’t bore you with the entirety of the intake process. There is a lot to be said about it, and at the same time nothing really to describe that you can’t imagine yourself. At one time or another you’ve had to check yourself in to the welcoming clinical arms of the ER. You’ve walked into a waiting room filled to the brim with sick and injured people. You think, “they must not be that sick or injured, or else they would’ve been seen already.” You wonder how many of them could’ve waited for their Primary Care appointment they already had scheduled. You ponder how many of them are waiting for family members who have already died. You consider the strange liminal space that the ER occupies. It is perennially filled, like a vase against a gravestone, with blossoms and people that will never bloom for long. It is an outgrowth of mushrooms on a log. It is the putrescent bacterial growth on the petri-dish of humanity. It is an intersection at the nexus of the worst days many people will ever experience. 

It was the worst day of my life. They rushed me past the waiting room straight into triage. I was bleeding so heavily from both arms that I was light headed. Tracy had packed my arm with bandages and gauze from the first aid kid we kept under the sink. She’d brought the knife with her thoughtlessly, like it was a weapon from a crime scene they could swab for clues. They didn’t need it. They could see who was at fault. 

They stopped the bleeding. I’m not sure how. I know it involved stitches because they would start to itch that night. They gave me an IV for the pain. About ten different medical professionals tried talking to to me immediately. I can’t remember their faces or their titles. They made sure to tell me. Dr. Jack. Nurse Jane. Ken and Barbie playing dress up. They asked me personal questions and medical questions in an alternating pattern. As they sutured me, they opened me up in more ways than one. They probed and prodded through my recent memory and worked their gloved hands through the body I tried to break. I talked to them in ways I know they noted in their charts.

*Appearance disheveled. Mood consistent with injuries. Speech erratic and thought process non-linear.* 

The fluorescent lights were deafening. I couldn’t make sense of my words and I couldn’t stop talking. Nothing I said made sense to them. I couldn’t make them understand me, and I had a hell of a time trying to be understood. I talked about my father as though he were there. I started crying again when I realized where I was, and where I knew he wasn’t. I spoke to them with the manic madness of full delirium. I can see the bed they strapped me to. I can hear the sounds of monitors and alarms going off in perfect asynchrony in the rooms and desks outside the curtain they’d cloaked around my bed. I felt the jab of a needle.

I remember these things in the way you remember a dream you had as a child. I can’t recall everything, and most days I don’t try. I know I bit someone bad enough they needed stitches. I remember because they told me. Later, when the haloperidol wore off and I was alone, I spat a chunk of skin that didn’t belong to me into my hand. It was about the size of a dime. I grinned. I had apparently gotten them good. 



 **Evaluation**:

I’m not sure how much you know about psychiatric hospitalizations. There are basically two types, and regardless of reason, they hold you for seventy-two hours under observation. That seventy-two hours doesn’t start until you, or a medical professional, initiates the hospitalization. To do that you must be evaluated. Like any other hospital visit, you are required to wait on the physician. I went in at 10pm on a Thursday night and it took me four hours after stabilization to be evaluated.

My evaluator was one of those “mental health professionals” that should probably leave the profession before they’re either murdered by a patient or they stick a gun in their mouth themselves. She was a miserable shrewish bitch of a woman. I hated myself then. I hated her more. It was at that moment that I started to feel my feet on the ground again.

Her evaluation was full of self-righteous bullshit. She sat there in her U-Madison t-shirt and her overstuffed jeans staring at me like I owed her an explanation for bringing her out of her house, and trotting her down here, just to disappoint her with boring answers. She was taking it out on me. I was almost back in my right mind, but I wish I’d bitten her then. 

Her exact words don’t really matter. She said terrible things to me — things I’ll never forgive her for. 

“Didn’t you want to die? How could you have failed when you tried so hard?” 

I wanted to cut the smirk off her face with a steak knife — I wanted to inflict pain upon her for inflicting it on me.

“Aren’t you upset that you were unsuccessful? Aren’t you ashamed of yourself? What would your family think? Don’t you ever think about anything but yourself?” 

I have only ever felt intentionally homicidal one time in my life. This was that time. I wanted to use the boning knife to open up her jugular and feel the hot gouts of blood coat my hands and arms. I wanted to open her the way I’d opened myself and laugh maniacally as the life drained from her eyes. 

I promise, I’m not crazy. 

Her gaze was a hot iron and her presence a monotony. I answered her questions as fully as I could bring myself to. The rage built, but I managed to release the desire to kill. The desire passed as the desire to harm myself had. I wanted to die, but I didn’t need it in the same way now. I didn’t tell her that I could still see my father. I didn’t tell her that he stood in the corner next to her and had finally begun to whisper to me. He told me things then, things I wished I could remember later. Things I wish I could forget. It was then that he first told me I was in danger. The irony of that statement is not lost on me. 

The putrid stench of the doctors breath wafted over the clipboard towards me, ruining all the good will I’d ever had in my life toward mental health workers. I know what she wrote on her chart. 

*Patient cooperative but in an altered mental state. Patient is a danger to themselves or others. Patient requires further observation.* 

I also didn’t tell her that in her haste to leave the room that she somehow managed to drop her pen. She never even noticed. I kept it like a secret in the bottom of my sock. I clung to it. It was an escape plan of a kind. I loved the pen for its possibility.

I don’t remember what time she left, but I could still smell the stink of her cheap perfume for hours afterwards. It was like the room was saturated in it. I needed a shower, but I wasn’t allowed at that time. I would be allowed later. Before she’d left, she’d told me I was just waiting on transport. I waited for another ten hours. My seventy-two hours couldn’t be initiated yet, as I needed to see the psychiatrist. I was still in purgatory. 

I can’t remember what time it was, but it was before dawn. I could tell by the hollow looks the nurses at the observation station had. You could always tell a graveyard shift from the daytime. Graveyard had the look and smell of death about them. They walked around like toy soldiers or wind-up robots. Their clothes were always wrinkled and they always smelled like stale diner coffee. They were the kindest and best people I’ve ever met. 

They let me read a book I’d brought with me. They gave me a breakfast tray and let me drink decaffeinated coffee. I was allowed to shower unsupervised. Not for the first time, I felt like I was wrapped in bubble wrap. I was held together by an amalgamation of medication and packing tape. I was a vase that had been shattered. 

These lock-down wings have round edges everywhere. There were reminders I was under a microscope. The bed was too heavy to lift and made of the same plastic used to make play kitchens. The coffee cup I drank from was styrofoam — the tray was too. The shower I took was in a room with heated floors and buttons on the wall to call the water. There was nothing that could be used as a hard edge. There were no places to hang bed sheets. There was a camera in my room; it was a great eye, ever watchful. The door had a window on it. I was surveilled at all times. 

Even the best of cameras have blind spots. Around 4 in the morning, I waddled to the corner underneath the camera and out of the way of the window. They would be checking on me in 15 minutes. I pulled the pen from my pocket. It was one of those pretentious fountain pens you have to fill yourself — a small aluminum cylinder monogrammed with her initials. It wouldn’t break without an enormous amount of force, but the nib was kite shaped and pointed. It was a promise and a contingency. 

The entire pod was blanketed in a vague half-glow. The lights were on a dimmer. 6 other rooms faced inward towards what I thought of as “the fishbowl.” There was a nurses station behind glass. They had those speakers you see at movie kiosks. They had drawers like the bank they could use to dispense pills. As much as they were angels, they were also lab technicians looking at me and the other patients under a microscope. When I was alone, I was never alone. I had my father. 



**24 Hours:**

Transport arrived sometime after breakfast. They put me in a wheelchair, even though I could walk fine, and pushed me into an elevator. We went to the 7th floor and they pushed me through a door locked with a security badge. I entered the lock-down wing of Middletown Hospital on Friday morning. I could conceivably be released on Sunday afternoon.

I smiled at the desk clerk as I got to my feet. They handed me a bag of personal effects. It felt like carrying around the outfit I’d been murdered in. They hadn’t bothered to launder the blood soaked clothing I’d come in with, and I don’t really blame them. At some point I’d been given a set of modified scrubs. The shirt was sleeveless (for obvious reasons) and the pants were ill fitting. 

They walked me to my room, past the morose figure of my father, and into the shoe box that would be my home for the next three days. I had a roommate. His name was Russell. 



“Hey, nice to meet you,” he said in a nasally voice.



Russell was about 50-ish. He had dark hair and a slouch that bordered on a physical deformity of the spine. His face had the tell-tale twitch of someone recovering from amphetamine addiction. That same twitch could’ve also been a side effect of long-term antipsychotic medication treatment. There was really no way to tell. 



“Mhm.”

“I’m Russell.” 

“Edgar.” 

“Don’t worry. Meals are always on time. They got a phone too.” 

“That’s nice.” 

“You gotta share though.” 

“Right, makes sense.” 

“Bed’s aren’t that bad.” 

“Mhm.” 

“Curtains are a bitch, though. I guess.. well, the lack of curtains are a bitch.” 



I followed where he pointed and sure enough there was a 6 foot window above the bed without any blinds or curtains. I guess they counted on people trying their luck with the pull strings. You have to think about the capacity of human creativity when you’re in a lock-down wing. 



“Anyways, I’m sorry in advance, mate. I snore.” 

“That’s alright. Me too,” I lied. It didn’t matter anyways. Nothing mattered to me but the figure standing over the shoulder of my roommate. My roommate looked a bit odd to me also. 

The medication they gave me at intake made it difficult to feel or have any kind of normal emotional response. They called it stabilization, since the emotion is what got me there. I called it a lobotomy of the soul. 

Russell carried on for a while. I tuned him out and brought my personal effects to the dresser. I’d brought a few books and a few photos. No phones and no TV. We had to keep ourselves occupied somehow. I’d walked past a patient library on the way down the hall. I wasn’t sure if I’d be doing anything relaxing. They’d gone through the bloody bag with me and let me pick out the sweatpants I’d worn in. They weren’t that blood stained. I changed out of the scrub pants in front of Russell. What’s one more person looking at my ass anyways?



“…and I’m not actually sure, but they said I’m here because of the voices. You know about-t-t v-v-voices, mate?” His face and mouth twitched violently on occasion. It gave him a stutter on some words.

“I know about voices.” 

I could hear the whispers around the edges of my hearing. It was TV static. It was a record scratching and replaying. Over, and over, and over, and over. I thought I might go mad. 

*They’re going to try and kill you, Edgar. Son, they’re going to try and kill you here. They’re going to try and kill you, Edgar. Son….*

When Russell wasn’t looking, I slid the pen in the fold of a clean shirt and placed it in the top drawer next to my bed. I looked back at him with careful eyes.



**Later**:

The psych ward was divided down the middle. On the one side, behind another keypad entry, were the violent and delusional patients. On the other side were the likes of me and Russell — the patients “more obviously” sane. If they only knew. We called the other side “the looney bin.” Irony and humor are a balm in times of trial. We talked amongst ourselves and thanked our lucky stars we were on the side with reasonable neighbors. I don’t remember their names. I think there was a John. There was definitely a Carol and a Lindsay, but their faces blur together. Faceless and nameless they still visit me in my dreams just the same. I sometimes wake up with their features etched on the inside of eye eyelids like I have been staring at the sun too long. Their names aren’t what’s important. 

There was a schedule. I guess treatment courses had progressed beyond sticking you in a padded 5 x 5 cell with a dozen other patients wrapped in straight jackets. No, this was modern medicine. The cells belong to the criminals. They let us color. They hosted group therapy sessions. And, Russell had been right. They did bring the food on time. 

Preschool and Psych wards have a few things in common. You aren’t allowed near scissors. You can’t use pens or pencils, only crayons and markers. You aren’t allowed unsupervised time. The people in charge don’t really give a shit if you participate or not, they just want you to be quiet. There are sometimes afternoon naps. 

I floated up and down the linoleum floor like a ghost. I walked to the desk to ask the time and wandered back to my room. I laid down and tried to sleep. I hadn’t slept since the day before. The other patients were waiting for their turn on the phone. Who could I call? I didn’t want to call my wife. She was hysterical when she dropped me off. Now that my feet had been on exposed tile for long enough I felt like a different person. Frankly, I was embarrassed. Furthermore, there was no way she’d believe me about my father. She was so willfully obtuse. There was also no way I was going to take the medicine they gave to me; not when I knew there was someone on the floor trying to kill me; not when I knew I was sane. 

They did a few rounds after dinner. The phone was turned off and the wing was shut down. They passed out the nightly doses around nine. I palmed my pill and managed to mimic swallowing well enough to escape notice. Graveyard was on by this point and they had the attention span of a father falling asleep in front of the TV. They were truly lovely people. 

I couldn’t sleep. I’d started seeing other figures standing next to my father. They were made of shadow; I was made of light. They told me someone was trying to kill me. A few tried to say I was already dead. I could feel the feathers and limbs break the skin on my back. There was a wet ripping. An exquisite radiating pain descended on me as I was taken in by the floating tendrils of a golden cascade. I was floating. I was flying. 

They tell me I woke up the entire floor with my screaming. 



**48 Hours:** 

I tried to tell them it was a night terror, but there was no convincing them. They gave me something to help me sleep, but I palmed that too. I passed out for 12 hours. 

Russell turned on the light when breakfast was served. I groggily sat up and joined him. Breakfast was stale cereal, powdered eggs, lukewarm coffee (decaf), and some potatoes that were some blitzed cafeteria workers interpretation of hash browns. He narrowed his eyes at me when he saw me looking. My look was a look of knowing. I understood who he was. I didn’t like what I saw.



“Th-th-the food really ain’t that bad.” 

“Mhm.”

“Th-That was a hell of a sound you made last night.” 

“Yeah, sorry.”

“Scared the hell out of me.” 

“Right.""

“No, n-no it’s alright.” His face said otherwise, even though I didn’t repeat my apology.

“Won’t happen again.” He didn’t look like he believed me. 



I started to think then that Russell was keeping tabs on me. He kept looking at me with his deep-set eyes and wrinkled brow. His eyes were two emerald marbles suspended under the shelf of his Cro-Magnon brow.  It reminded me of the figures in my room last night. He looked out at me like a prisoner of war. He looked with the absence of the empty dead. My suspicions grew like a fire. 

I “took” my morning dose like he did. My collection was growing by the hour. I wandered out and decided to join the morning session. I wished there were name tags. It felt like a fucked up version of AA or something. I guessed that wasn’t entirely inaccurate since all group therapy operates essentially the same. 

You have your joiners who are willing and ready to spill their guts like bloated roadkill. You have your silent observers who are listening but engaged. You have your openly hostile imbeciles that think they’re better than everyone else. You have your soliloquists that talk your ear off about nothing. You have the leader, in this case an Occupational Therapist with a face like the angel Gabriel, who is trying to make everyone respect each others time and space. They have an impossible job. 

There is never anyone normal who attends group therapy; It’s just that some are able to hide the grotesquerie better than others. I like to think I am a silent observer; I know that my father is. 

I know what the therapists will say before they say it. I’ve heard it all before. Aphorisms and platitudes. Coping skills and self-help drivel. I have to ground myself. I have to breathe deeply. I have to examine the relationships I have and build connection where I’ve lost them. I have to bash my identity in the head and pull it apart it like Victor Frankenstein, sewing limbs and knitting sinews. I have to remake myself. 

I thought about remaking myself. I decided against it. I started planning my escape.



**Later:**

Most of my time was reserved for rumination. I liked to dwell on things. I would crawl into my mental swamp and breathe in the smell of decaying vegetation while I sifted through the muck and mire of my thought processes. I soaked my thoughts in a bog before committing to them. My stitches itched and burned. 

Also, you can work out the truth of a matter much easier when the world is tinged with light. Patterns emerge you never thought possible. You can see the fabric of reality unfold before you like so many lines on a map. I saw the thread where my father warned me of my impending death. I watched as the thread joined up with another connection I’d made. I saw the look Russell gave me and thought about it. I thought about it some more, and then I thought about it some more. 

I didn’t speak that day unless spoken to. I took my meals and guarded my secrets. I scratched at my bandages. A nurse noticed and had someone come to redress my wounds. She was kind and smelled like peppermint. After the wound was redressed, I asked for something for the pain. She smiled at me and said in a kind and soft voice, “They can get you Tylenol at the desk.” The bitch.



**Before**: 

I can’t tell you which detective determined my father’s murder was unsolvable. They couldn’t find the murder weapon. The evidence had been destroyed because the killer had left him in Longfellow State Park to rot in the open weather. All possible evidence had been scrubbed and left to the animals. They’d left him there in high summer, when the heat was scorching, partially buried in leaves left over from the previous autumn. He was curled against a downed tree in a difficult to reach stretch of woodland. His rib cage was mangled by at least twenty-two stab wounds. Someone walking a dog had discovered his decomposing remains when the dog had returned a fetch with a human femur. They told me this with the brutal efficiency of a small child. I was stunned. 

When I stood before his casket, closed due to the state of decomposition, I remember thinking that it wasn’t possible. Somehow that thought grew as I ruminated. Something that used to see so possible, even doable, became improbable. From improbability I leapt to impossibility. I’ve been clinging ever since. 

My father revealed himself to me the night of the funeral. I was sitting in my room, thinking as I always did, when he walked into the doorway. The bloat of his corpse had collapsed in upon itself and somehow righted. He looked similar to how he did in life. The more I watched the more I realized he was the same as he’d always been. A little blood-soaked maybe, but he was there. He was alive! I shot to my feet and bounded across the room trying to catch him in an embrace. He didn’t say anything, but retreated from my arms. His eyes were filled with tears. Maybe they were my eyes, I can’t remember. 

I can tell you that in the months and weeks after his death I tried to convince Tracy that he was alive. I started subtly because she wasn’t open to the idea. She thought it was something my brain had created as a way to cope. I thought it was logic. It was so hard to explain through tears. She was being crazy. He lived with us and she couldn’t see him. He was alright! 

I left it alone for so long. I spoke the truth to myself and in a mantra. It was like praying the rosary. 



**72 Hours:**

I awoke on my own in the early hours. I had no idea what time it was since I didn’t have my phone and I was disoriented. I couldn’t see the numbers on the clock hanging above the door. I rolled over and stared through the crack in the door. After the first night, I’d figured out that they were doing bed checks every hour. Through the door, I saw them. Like night watchmen at corporate properties, like geese counting ducks, they would push open the door and count the occupants. After they passed, I got to my feet and walked calmly to the nurses station. They spoke to me from behind plexiglass. 



“Hey, I’m having trouble sleeping.” 

“Alright, gimme a sec.” 



The nurse was on the phone. I craned my head to examine the back wall. She pulled out a bottle and dumped a few pills into a paper cup. She poured a cup of water as well and handed me both. 



“Thank you.” 



She nodded without looking up. While she had been turned, I had checked the schedule that was posted on the wall. I tried to see when shift change would be. There are always some moments when there are less staff on the floor than others. I knew that if I could time it right, they wouldn’t get to me until I was already done. The whiteboard was a little vague, but today it seemed like 5AM was my time to shine. According to the clock on the wall, it was 3:30AM. Plenty of time to plan. I had been planning for two days. I would make my escape.

——

In the darkness of my room I laid awake. Thoughts, dark and brooding, descended upon me like God upon the mountain. I was covered over with the single sheet they allowed and slightly shivering, but not from the cold. My body was electric. I was a closed circuit — a live wire. I was a charge without a ground. Great creatures of light floated in and out of my room. They had wings like me. The exquisite pain erupted from my back as my wax coated wings emerged once again. I clutched the fountain pen to my chest. The feel of the cold metal felt nice against the crackling of my skin. 

I had convinced myself a few hours before that I needed to escape. They had sent an operative in to the hospital to spy on me. They wanted me to confess my sins to them. They occupied the space of my schizophrenic roommate, but I knew that he was false. He was a surrogate. He was an effigy. He needed to burn. 

An hour passed. The wall clock ticked slowly while I waited in my swamp. I was a bog body — pinned and held by ceremony. The time approached. The door creaked open on old hinges. The face of a cherubic nurse looked in at both of us. She shut the door. I rose to my feet with the pen in my right hand and the pillowcase wrapped in the other. 

My father stood in front of the door. He smiled at me softly. He smiled at me in the way he did when I was a child. When I was a child and he stole my innocence. I was just a child. 

I reached the bedside of my roommate Russell. He looked like a china doll laying on its side. I couldn’t even see his chest rise as he breathed deeply. His face changed before me and twisted. As it shifted I uncapped the pen. I pressed the pillowcase to his mouth and stuffed it like a gag. My wings spread out behind me as I reached towards the sun. 



“I’m sorry Tracy,” I said as I pulled the pen back. This was my escape. I was never going to be released. I was never going to be evaluated. They sent him here to kill me. 



Russell's eyes went wide as he began to struggle. I stabbed the metal nib underneath his jaw, just like I had those weeks before with the knife. His flesh gave way. His screams were muffled by the pillowcase. He stood no possible chance, since I had crawled up onto his chest and pinned his legs with my knees. He struggled and fought as the blood fountained with each jab of the pen. I was coated in it — a tactile memory so familiar. I found, to my complete surprise and delight, that stabbing someone in the throat was far easier than trying to punch a blade through a rib cage. 

I smiled as I looked to the heavens. The sky opened before me and winged creatures descended to lift me free. Bathed in the blood of my enemy, I was baptized. 

Memories flooded back to me as I stabbed over and over. A stretch of abandoned woodland. The unbearable heat of summer. Dumping the body of my abuser. Laughing when they called me to say they’d identified the remains. Crying uncontrollably into the shoulder of my wife. 

As I stabbed, tears came to my face. I looked into the eyes of my sacrifice to learn that Russell's face was not his face. It was mine. 



**Later**: 

I await trial. They have not yet sent someone to evaluate me. I doubt they’ll let me go though. The authorities are confused. They can’t seem to figure out where I had gotten a pen. They have me on different medications now, though I’m not certain if they will work. I mean, they aren’t working currently. They have only dimmed my experience. They have only neutralized my soul. 

I’ve been given a certain amount of paper to try and help explain my case. Tracy has visited trying to get me to tell the truth. I don’t think think it will work. If anything, this will prove I am not my own. I am a god. I am untouchable. I’m floating above the clouds right now as I write. I am alone now in my cell. Well, that isn’t entirely accurate either. Russell stands in the corner. He smiles at me softly. Tears coat his cheeks, or are they mine? I can’t tell anymore. ",1,1762548121.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

 * the 2025 Thanksgiving bundle is also smaller than the 2024 package.
 * My company tracks these costs year to year, using the exact same items year over year, with the majority coming from walmart. We found you'll see a 5% increase. Surprisingly proteins were significantly cheaper: turkey is down 25% and Ham is down 13%, but that is easily offset by an 88% increase in coffee, 100% increase in tea, 34% increase in wine. Thanks tariffs. Also, basically every other thanksgiving meal food besides the proteins was up by double digits: stuffing (11%), cranberry sauce (25%), sweet potatoes ( 10%), gravy (18%), and frozen veggie mix (16%). Beer was only up 4% and crescent rolls are actually down 12%, so maybe just make your thanksgiving meal turkey, ham, beer and crescent rolls to make your meal actually affordable this year.

I was his unpaid intern. He was a late-career PhD.  
  
We were building algorithms for detecting diseases based on a patient's biomarkers, and he had ideas on how to make that process run faster with a certain way of coding it up. I learned some basic coding, and we met once a week to discuss my progress.  
  
And in this meeting, apparently I was asking too many questions.  
  
If I wanted to know more about the ""why"" of it, I should go take a computer science course, rather than ask him so many questions. And so he spits out this vitriol at me in the middle of the coffee shop, with people all around us, them all avoiding eye contact.  
  
He went on to criticize me for asking for equity in the project, and he said, ""What do you know about selling this to healthcare buyers? You'd never be good at it.""

But I realize that most people walking around only notice the cost of living and they are pissed of by a $20 bag of coffee.

I think that there's an opportunity to tie these things together.  Corruption is a tax.  The money that is skimmed off the top has to come from somewhere.  If it comes from inefficient government like bloating ICE or corrupt government contracts to his friends, that's us paying it.  If it comes from corporations or bribes, that is passed on to us, also, in the form of higher prices.

I think we should start hammering home about Trump getting rich and tie it back to the cost of living.  That marriage of turds might be our way out of this.

I’m relocating to Chicago (Hyde Park) for work and need to be moved in by January. I’m in my mid-20s, moving from Southern California, and trying to figure out where to live and what kind of place makes the most sense.



A little about me:

I’m pretty social and like being near fun areas (restaurants, bars, coffee spots, etc.) but would also like something that feels a bit more residential/quiet\ day-to-day.

My boyfriend will be moving out later so I’m looking for a 1–2 bedroom that could comfortably fit both of us eventually.

I have a dog who’s an ESA through my therapist, so dog-friendly housing is a must.

My top priorities: 
in-unit washer/dryer, some kind of outdoor space or being close to parks, and parking options street or off-street).



They’re offering a relocation stipend, but I’m still torn between going for a furnished place (to make the move easier) or unfurnished to save long-term and make it feel more like home). My budget is about 2,200 a month *ideally*! 



Neighborhoods I’ve been looking at include: 
Lincoln Park, Lakeview, Wicker Park, Bucktown, Logan Square, West Loop, and Avondale but I’m totally open to other suggestions if there’s a better fit for my vibe.



Would love any advice or insight on:



Areas that fit what I’m looking for (young, social, dog-friendly, but not chaotic)

Realistic rent ranges I should expect

Good sites or property managers to check out

Any tips for moving across the country with a dog / ESA paperwork

Pros and cons of furnished vs unfurnished rentals in Chicago



Thanks in advance for any help — I know January is coming fast, so I’m trying to get my bearings early!

EDIT: I unfortunately seemed to jump the gun by making this post and left out a lot of useful information to help me on my search. I’ve added in some more information and will continue to in order for me to receive the best advice, I really appreciate everyone taking the time to help!

***#2.*** **Myers**

A week had gone by since we were assigned the case. And we had made as much progress as a public contractor “repairing” the downtown roads. God, I wish they’d get on with it. It takes me an hour to drive to the office, for what should be a twenty-minute commute.

Walsh was silent most of the time. On day one he prepared an ordered list of all the leads we had in the case. We’d been chasing them down one by one, with no luck. We still hadn’t gotten the chance to speak to his family – more accurately, Walsh had chosen not to speak with them. “They were grieving,” he said. “We should give them some time.”

There had not been a reported anomaly since Isabel went missing two weeks ago. The anomaly that took  Corbin was two days before that. It was the longest we’ve gone without one since the disappearances started.

“Maybe they’re afraid of us crashing their party.” I muttered, forgetting that Walsh was next to me. He shot me a look – was it contempt? I couldn’t tell. His words and actions felt oddly heavy. Like a construction worker, carrying a steel beam. I don’t know. The Lieutenant visited us occasionally. We had no good news to tell him, hell we didn’t have any news.

“Let’s go. We’ll look into 11-C today.” Walsh said. He had classified and divided his list of leads in his little homework project.I couldn’t be arsed to remember it, but I just nodded and got ready to leave. I did manage to sneak a glance at the list before we left though, on it said:

*Section 11, Item C: Ridges Iron Works*. A metalworks plant in the outskirts of the city. Corbin worked here. The plant was a good hour's drive and there wasn’t much traffic in this part of town. No one seemed to be in a hurry, cruising down the road at a leisurely pace. I wish Walsh would go a little faster though. I offered to drive this time but he declined. Knocked-down street lamps and dysfunctional traffic lights decorated the path, along with people sleeping in the shade of alleys with nothing but a piece of cardboard to shield them from the elements.

Walsh did not speak during the drive. I’d figured quite a while ago that he was also against the idea of having a partner. That old bastard, he put us together on purpose. What did he expect to happen? Sometimes I wonder if he would put this much hope on me even if he hadn’t known my father. Eh, who knows. The old man’s dead. He left those left behind to mop up his mess. As he always did.

Soon the buildings became scarce, and more industrial. There were more people here, workers on their lunch break. As I scanned the crowds, I saw a person staring back at me, but the moment he realised I saw him, he bolted. He was oddly shaped for the lack of a better term. It looked as if he were starving, with hollow cheekbones and his ribs poking through the shirt he wore. His arms were too thin to be that of a working man, and the way he scurried along reminded me of a baby running for the first time. I felt my stomach twist into a knot.

“Walsh, stop the car.” I asked.

He did not comply. Instead, he turned to me and spoke. “We’re not stopping for that.”

“I’m not fucking around; I need to investigate a suspicious character.” I replied.

“What did they do that was suspicious?” He asked.

“H-He was thin, like just bones and skin an-and he uh stared at me.” I stuttered out a response. I realised that it was futile against Walsh. A nice car in this part of town, it would be a surprise if nobody was staring at it. And the way we’re dressed, at least the way Walsh is, even a half-wit wouldn’t have a hard time telling we’re cops. But the unease I felt, It was almost as if  something was trying to grab me, to trap me inside a clenched fist. I could have been wrong. He was quite far away, maybe I misjudged his proportions. Or maybe it was my mind trying to rationalise what I had seen.

“Nevermind, forget it.” I said.  Walsh nodded and set his eyes back on the road. Still, I could not let it go.

We reached the plant not long after. It was largely empty, except for one or two workers smoking outside. A man dressed in blue overalls walked out of the door. He was probably in his late forties, but the lack of hair and the protruding belly made him look a decade older. As we got out of the car, he approached us with an obviously fake smile. Now that he was closer, I could make out scrapes and scratches all across the chains on his neck, revealing a silvery gray color underneath the golden coating. He had rings on all ten of his fingers, and a golden bracelet completed the look. His uniform appeared old and worn down, but his shoes looked fancy and brand new.

“Ey Welcome Detectives. Name’s Frankie. I run this joint right’ere.” He spoke through the grin. “What can I help you with today?”

Walsh was the first to speak, although I had a feeling he didn’t want to. “Good Afternoon, Mr. Frankie. I’m Senior Detective Walsh, and this is Detective Myers. We are here on a case regarding the disappearance of Mr. Corbin Reme, I believe he used to work here.”

““Oh yeah, Cobbie – good kid. Used to ask for extra shifts all the time. Guess he needed the cash, y’know?” He paused, almost as if he was pondering on what to say. “ Makes sense though, he was takin’ care of his whole family. Lotta mouths to feed over there.” He replied. His smile faded a bit. “Go on, detective. Take a look around. Least I can do to help the poor kid.” He seemed a little less happy with that last line. Although I could chalk it up to what happened with Corbin, my gut told me otherwise.

“Thank you, Mr. Frankie.” Walsh said, and immediately went to scribble something in his notebook. “Now if we may.” He signalled me to follow him as he walked into the plant. Most of the workers had gone down to get their lunch, only a couple remained. As was his routine, Walsh took the statement from them, but I doubt he got anything worth noticing in that.

By the time Walsh was finished with his inspection it was already half past four. The other workers had come back in that time, and he had taken all of their statements. All of them had the same thing to say about Corbin – how he was a good kid trying to provide for his family, how he cared for them.

“Glad to be of help. Detective. I hope you find the kid. He must be scared to death, being abducted by ghosts and all.” Frankie said. I looked over to Walsh if he had caught that. The paranormal influence in the disappearances were not made known to the public. Although a person who had followed the news could come up with theories as such. Walsh thanked the man and got back in the car. After we were out of the gate, I asked him.

“How did he know that?” Walsh looked at me, doubtful as to what I was talking about. “About the case, how did he know there were paranormal forces involved?”

“I don’t know. Might have been a lucky guess.” Walsh said. I didn’t respond. He’d kept a lot to himself and his little diary, perhaps he didn’t see it as an important lead to the case.

I took in the ever-beautiful scenery of rusted metal and homeless tents as we cruised down the road. I saw the board for a diner on the way, the lights were on even though it was barely five in the evening. “Freddie’s Diner - 1 mile ahead” it read. It was the most interesting thing I’ve seen on the road, so I kept an eye out. As we passed Freddie’s Diner, which was only a few yards outside the Industrial district, I saw that man – or thing again. Pale skin, unnaturally thin body with a hollow face and deep, haunting eyes. It stared through me, past my face into my soul, or whatever was there. Compulsively I closed my eyes, as I felt physical discomfort from the staring man. When I looked back, it was gone. Who was that – no what was that? It did not seem like any anomaly we had records for. My muscles tensed up, I could feel beads of sweat forming on my forehead. My hands grew cold to the touch. I didn’t want to bear the sight of the man again. But I was a detective after all, it was in my blood to search for the truth. Damn old man hadn’t left me with much, but he sure as hell passed on his genetic defects.

“Walsh, Please stop the car.” I said. He shot me an unsure look, but pulled over nonetheless.

“Is this about the suspicious person you saw earlier?” He asked. I nodded. Walsh sighed and looked at his watch. “Ten minutes.”

I walked towards the diner. It was filled to the brim with factory workers who’d come to get a meal after their shift. I took three or four laps around the diner, and scanned the whole area. I couldn’t find anything. Maybe it was all in my head after all. Maybe sobriety was getting to me.

“I forgot my notes at the plant.” Walsh said, as I opened the door to get in. “We have to go back.”

“Yea” I replied. ""Sure” 

The plant was old, like the rest of the factories in the area, but it still held together pretty well. Walsh had picked up the pace, and disappeared into a corner.I loitered around a bit, expecting him to return quickly with his notes. For a man like him, it was odd he forgot them in the first place. After a few minutes of waiting, I got impatient and walked ahead . I felt unnatural friction while turning the corner, almost as if I’d passed through a very thin sheet of jelly. I didn’t think of it much, I was more focused on finding Walsh.

Ahead of me was a long corridor with machines on either side. The metallic sounds of the machines ran across the corridor. Strange, I hadn’t heard it before I’d turned the corner. There was no place Walsh could have gone, except the  fire exit at the end of the corridor. A few steps later the sign came into view, and I could make out the letters – they were mirrored. I walked towards the sign and opened the door, only to reveal the same hallway I was already in.

I stepped back from the door, and turned around to leave. Maybe Walsh had made it to the car. Maybe he was waiting for me. But something was not right – The corridor seemed longer than it actually was. I kept walking, but I was barely covering any ground. It took me double the time to cover the corridor to walk halfway through it.

I had this sensation I couldn’t shake. I felt like I was being watched. Often I saw shadows from the corner of my eye, but when I turned to face them, there was nothing there. When I was almost two thirds of the way through I saw a lean and lanky figure in my peripheral vision. I turned to face it, only to be met with dust covered machinery.

The air had gotten colder. It felt as if the room itself, the machinery, the floors, the lights hanging from the ceiling, all of them were laughing at me. They took enjoyment in my plight, as if I was a monkey dancing in a circus.  

Suddenly, I felt a familiar sense of dread. I turned back to face the thin man, staring at me with his hollow eyes – did he even have eyes? There was a deep darkness where his eyes should have been. His limbs were elongated and asymmetric. He was walking towards me. His left leg was double the size of the right one. He crawled forward with his left knee and right foot. He dragged his left arm along the ground. With each passing step I could hear bones cracking. As he came closer his face became clearer. He did have eyes. Two black spheres adorned his eye socket. They looked similar to the finest pearls one could buy. In the middle of each there was a white dot, which kept moving erratically.

As he creeped closer, silence enveloped the corridor. No metallic clangs from the machinery, no buzzing from the lights. No cracking of the bones.

I froze. I yelled for it to stop but nothing came out.  I screamed at my muscles to move. I commanded my legs to run. I begged my eyes to look away. None complied. The air got colder as the thin man got closer.

He raised his bony arms and pointed a finger at me. A grin stretched across the man’s face, showing his unnaturally sharp teeth.

He was smiling.

***#3.*** **Myers**

I'll admit, I’m not a brave man. I have found myself in a myriad of situations that would hurt me very badly throughout the years, but most of them I’d chalked up to my own stupidity. I remember this one time in high school; I made a bet with my friends. In hindsight it was stupid, but so was I. I'd stay in a haunted house for a whole night, alone, and they’d buy me lunch for a week. That was the bet. Naturally, I accepted. Most haunted houses were fake, rumours made up by the masses for their own twisted enjoyment, but this one was not. My dad found me the next day curled up in a ball on our front doorstep, petrified and muttering gibberish. I still don’t remember what happened that night, I just remember the fear I felt. It was the most scared I’ve been in my whole life until it smiled.

Why was I so afraid? The thing in front of me could barely walk. It was creepy, for sure, but the amount of dread I felt when my eyes landed on the lean and bony figure was irrationally large. I crawled back on my back, my face fixed on its rapidly twitching eye sockets. With shaky hands I unholstered my service pistol. I tried to pick it up, but it wouldn’t budge. Either the pistol was made with pure tungsten, or my arm had given up following the orders of my brain.

The thing was almost at my feet. It stretched its left hand towards me. I pulled the pistol up in front of me in a jolt, the fear was subsiding, my brain was getting used to it. I started counting the fingers the thin man had. It was ten, but the counting helped. It was a little trick my father had taught me. I still didn’t have the strength to pull the trigger. I just faced the abomination with my pistol in shaky hands. Its hand creeped closer towards my face, and I shut my eyes. The moment it touched me, a gunshot went off. I opened my eyes to see the thin man laying motionless on its side, and Walsh behind it with a smoking gun.

Blood drained from the thin man’s body. Walsh held the gun pointed straight ahead, then he moved the muzzle to my face. I shuffled up, but the muzzle seemed to follow me.

“Walsh?” I called out. “Put the gun down man, You’re creeping me out.”  Walsh didn’t budge. His silhouette cast an unnatural shadow on the ground below, enveloping the now deceased body of the thin man and slowly creeping up to my feet. I backed up carefully, the pistol in my right hand pressed against my back. I didn’t know if he’d seen it already or not, I couldn’t risk exposing all my cards. Walsh didn’t speak, he advanced towards me as slow as a falling feather. His face projected an emotion I’d never seen him express — sorrow. His eyes hung low, his lips curled up into a frown that seemed all too familiar with his face. The stern look he always maintained was gone, almost as if it was not there in the first place. A lifetime of sorrow reflected on his face. “I didn’t want to do this Owen…” He spoke softly.

“Do what? Come on man, don’t be reckless.”I protested. He sighed and armed his pistol. Before I could even think of raising the pistol in my hand to shoot at him, I felt an arm grab me from the back. It had put me in a headlock and pressed a wet cloth against my nose and mouth. I struggled to break free, dropping my gun in order to grip the hand covering my face, but to no avail. It started with my legs; they stopped responding to my commands.

Over a few minutes that crept up to my arm, and then to my eyes. Before I shut them for good, I saw the man’s hand. They had golden rings in every finger.

**\* \* \***

I woke up in my bed; in the same clothes I’d worn the previous day for work. Or was it the previous day? I don’t know. My memory is a bit shaky. Gosh, Don’t tell me I got wasted again… The Lieutenant will let me have it this time. I dropped back into my bed and stared at the ceiling for a good ten minutes. After that, I mustered enough energy to get out of bed. I stepped on a half-filled coffee cup as I got off, dunking my boots into week old coffee. I kicked the cup to the side, and it landed against the half eaten, three day old chinese take out. I stumbled my way to my kitchen, my body strangely weak and unresponsive.a thin line of sunshine pierced into the room through the opening in the curtains. I opened them fully, illuminating my apartment. It seemed to be afternoon. I checked the clock to find out it was almost half past three. “Shit.” I muttered, utterly defeated by my own doing. I grabbed my keys, slammed the door shut and ran down the stairs. There was no time to wait for the elevator.

Driving through the city with no regard for the speed limit got me to the precinct seven minutes earlier. It also helped me refresh my memory of what had happened. I guess the adrenaline helped. I had to tell the Lieutenant. I rushed in through the front door. “Good afternoon, sir, how may we ass-” Shawn stopped midway and stared at me. “Owen! Where have you been!”

“I overslept.” I answered, scanning the precinct for the Lieutenant. “Shawn, Is the Lieutenant in today?” 

“Oh, I’m here alright.” Before Shawn could answer, I heard a voice from behind me. I turned to see the Lieutenant. He looked tense. “Come with me Owen.” He commanded. I’d never heard him talk with such terrifying authority. Guess I’d really done it this time.

“You have to hear me out. Detective Walsh knocked me out at the plant and he-” Before I could finish, the Lieutenant shouted. “Detective Walsh? Who’s that? You’re making up people now?”

I was perplexed. I tried to explain about the case, about him being my partner, but the lieutenant didn’t heed anything I had to say. The Lieutenant's face dropped from anger to pity.

“Now look here, Owen. I made a promise to your father to look after you. And I tried. But you cannot expect me to bail you out over and over again without any consequences. This case was the last chance I gave you. I even let you do it solo, as your request. Everyone wants you out of the precinct, Owen. The captain, the top brass. But I held on. Fought all of them. I thought I saw potential in you, but..”  He paused to regain his composure. The old man was frighteningly close to breaking down. “But what did you do? You got inebriated and accused – no, threatened a normal, working class man. You broke into his factory after hours and when he tried to protest – rightfully so – you pointed your gun at him.Then you disappeared for three whole days. No contact.” The Lieutenant stopped. I stood there, mouth agape. Having no idea what had happened, I approached the Lieutenant. “Please hear me out. I can explain. Walsh-” I was rudely interrupted by one of the officers, who grabbed and cuffed me.

“Detective Owen Myers.” The Lieutenant spoke. “Hand over your badge and your gun.”

I looked around the room, my eyes pleading for anyone to take my side. To pitch in for me. No one did. I reluctantly handed over my service pistol and my badge. “Please escort Mr. Myers to the holding cell.” The Lieutenant said, and the officer complied.   I turned to Shawn, as a last-ditch effort, “Shawn! Tell him about Walsh. We were partnered together!” Shawn looked away, trying to avoid eye contact with me. “There is no Detective Walsh, Owen. I hope you get the help you need.”",2,1762547040.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

My life was basically the smell of gasoline and stale coffee, working a soul-crushing job at a gas station for maybe $10 an hour on a good day. I had dropped out of college and just felt like I was watching life happen to other people. Every day was the same miserable loop, and I was desperate for a way out but had no idea where to even start. It felt like I was destined for a life of just barely getting by.

Then one night, mindlessly scrolling through YouTube, I saw an ad. Normally I’d skip it, but this one was for a digital marketing course. It promised a new career, the ability to work from anywhere, and a real, livable income. Honestly, it sounded way too good to be true, but a tiny spark of 'what if?' lit up in my brain. I was so desperate for a change that I took the plunge and bought the course with money I really didn't have.

For the next three months, my life was work, sleep, and studying. I dove headfirst into everything—SEO, Google Ads, social media marketing, you name it. I got my Google certifications and started applying for every remote marketing job I could find. I sent out over a hundred applications and got maybe two responses. It was discouraging, but I remembered the feeling of that gas station and pushed harder. Finally, I landed an entry-level gig. It wasn't glamorous, but it was my ticket out.

Fast forward to today, and that one YouTube ad completely changed the trajectory of my life. I've switched jobs a couple of times, my income has grown to over six figures, and I have the freedom to work from home. The feeling of being in control of my own life is something I'll never take for granted. I'm not a special genius or anything; I just found a path and refused to give up. I went from feeling worthless to feeling like I actually have valuable skills, and it all started with a random ad I almost skipped.

So, what's the one random video, article, or piece of advice that completely changed your career path?",1,1762546907.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False

1or53dc,https://www.reddit.com/r/fermentation/comments/1or53dc/from_scoby_to_silicon_i_used_my_fermentation/,From SCOBY to Silicon: I Used My Fermentation Science Background to Build an AI System,"\*\*Background:\*\* Professional brewer → kombucha production → coffee quality manager. Over a decade of staring at SCOBYs, watching fermentation kinetics, and thinking about how bacteria and yeast work together.



Then I had a weird thought: \*\*What if fermentation is literally a form of computation?\*\*



\*\*The Observation:\*\*



Working with kombucha, kefir, sourdough - these systems are:

\- \*\*Distributed:\*\* No single organism controls the culture

\- \*\*Adaptive:\*\* Change temperature? pH? Substrate? They adapt

\- \*\*Efficient:\*\* Billions of years of optimization

\- \*\*Resilient:\*\* Kill half the colony, it recovers

\- \*\*Emergent:\*\* Complex behavior from simple organisms



These are the same properties computer scientists want in AI systems.



\*\*The Question:\*\*



Can we design AI that works like a SCOBY instead of like a traditional computer program?



\*\*LUCA AI Project:\*\*



\*\*Biological Principles → Computational Patterns:\*\*



1. \*\*Symbiotic Resource Allocation\*\*

   \- SCOBY: Bacteria produce acid, yeast produce alcohol, both benefit

   \- AI: Different processing modules ""trade"" results



2. \*\*Quorum Sensing\*\*

   \- SCOBY: Chemical signaling coordinates colony behavior

   \- AI: Event-driven architecture for inter-process communication



3. \*\*Metabolic Flexibility\*\*

   \- SCOBY: Switch carbon sources based on availability

   \- AI: Dynamic task allocation based on resource availability



4. \*\*Layered Complexity\*\*

   \- SCOBY: Pellicle forms layers, creating micro-environments

   \- AI: Processing layers that self-organize, not pre-programmed



\*\*Why Fermentation Specifically?\*\*



Could have picked neurons, immune systems, ant colonies. But fermentation has advantages:



\- \*\*Observable:\*\* I've watched thousands of fermentation cycles

\- \*\*Quantifiable:\*\* pH, acidity, sugar consumption, microbial counts

\- \*\*Scalable:\*\* Works from 10mL lab scale to 1000L industrial

\- \*\*Ancient:\*\* 3.5 billion years old (LUCA = Last Universal Common Ancestor)

\- \*\*Practical:\*\* I actually understand it from hands-on experience



\*\*Technical Implementation:\*\*



\- FastAPI backend (Python) - each service is an ""organism""

\- React frontend - visualization of colony behavior

\- Event-driven (like chemical signaling in cultures)

\- No central controller (like real fermentation)



\*\*Fermentation Metrics → AI Metrics:\*\*



| Fermentation | AI Equivalent |

|--------------|---------------|

| pH stability | System homeostasis |

| Microbial diversity | Processing module variety |

| Metabolic rate | Computational throughput |

| Pellicle thickness | Complexity layers |

| Adaptation time | Learning speed |



\*\*The Weird Part:\*\*



Traditional programmers: ""Where's your main() function?""

Me: ""There isn't one. It emerges.""



Traditional AI: ""Where's your training dataset?""

Me: ""The system self-organizes based on rules, like bacteria.""



\*\*Fermentation Community Question:\*\*



Has anyone else thought about fermentation as computation? I haven't found much literature on this specific angle.



\*\*Current Status:\*\*



\- Multiple iterations completed

\- Reaching out to tech companies (NVIDIA, AMD, Anthropic)

\- Open source documentation

\- Still working as Quality Manager at Tchibo (gotta pay bills)



\*\*For Fermentation Folks:\*\*



Next time you're watching a pellicle form, think about it as distributed computing. Billions of organisms coordinating without a brain, without a plan, just local rules + interaction = complex system.



That's what I'm trying to build digitally.



\*\*Questions:\*\*



1. What fermentation systems would make interesting AI models?

2. Sourdough? Different properties than SCOBY?

3. Sake fermentation? More complex organism interactions?

4. Industrial beer fermentation? High stress environments?



Anyone want to collaborate on the intersection of fermentation science and AI?



Also: This might be the weirdest post this subreddit has ever seen, but it felt like the right place to share.



\*\*TL;DR:\*\* Spent 10 years making kombucha and beer. Used that knowledge to build an AI system that works like a SCOBY. Yes, seriously.

So I’m posting again to see if I can find the real ppl who’s also looking for some real friendship.  

I’ll be honest about myself because I don’t want fake or shallow connections. I live with BPD, depression and social anxiety. That means I get attached really quickly if I like someone. So I’m serious about building a friendship with you.

I used to be Muslim, but I’ve left religion. And I’m an atheist now. 

What I like & value: Honest, genuine people who appreciate feelings. Deep talks, not shallow convos or cold replies. Space, astronomy, music (I’m obsessed with songs), nature, rain, coffee, matcha, and sometimes video games. People who can respect boundaries and give back the same energy. I love when people value me as much as I value them.

What I dislike: Narcissists (stay away, I can’t stand them). Fake, exploitative people if I notice someone is using me, I cut them off like they never existed. Surface-level friendships that disappear fast.

And to be honest, if I love you, I’ll get very clingy, obsessed, and stalker-ish haha. I can be crazy and weird sometimes, and other times quiet and sad for no reason. I’m shy in real life, and it takes time for me to feel safe, comfortable enough to show my true self.

What I usually listen to: Melanie Martinez - Lana del rey - Billie Eilish - Cigarettes After Sex - Arctic Monkeys - the smiths - Halsey - Radiohead - Aurora - Beach House - The Neighbourhood and more..

1or51hz,https://github.com/lennartwuchold-LUCA/LUCA-AI_369,Built an AI system inspired by how bacteria make kombucha. Here's the tech stack and architecture.,"\*\*TL;DR:\*\* Spent months building LUCA AI - an AI architecture based on fermentation symbiosis. FastAPI + React + some weird biology-inspired patterns. Open source. Here's what I learned.



\*\*The Idea:\*\*



I'm a fermentation scientist by training (brewing, kombucha, coffee quality). Spent years watching how SCOBY cultures (bacteria + yeast) self-organize. Thought: ""This is literally distributed computing that evolved over billions of years. Can we code it?""



\*\*Tech Stack:\*\*



\*\*Backend:\*\*

\- FastAPI (Python) - chose for async capabilities

\- Event-driven architecture (mimics chemical signaling)

\- Microservices pattern (each service = organism)

\- No centralized orchestrator (it's all emergent)



\*\*Frontend:\*\*

\- React (TypeScript)

\- Real-time state management

\- Visualization of ""colony"" behavior



\*\*Architecture Pattern:\*\*



Instead of:

\`\`\`

Request → Router → Controller → Service → Database → Response

\`\`\`



We have:

\`\`\`

Signal → Colony Network → Self-Organization → Emergent Response

\`\`\`



Each microservice:

\- Operates independently

\- Communicates via events (like quorum sensing)

\- Competes for resources

\- Cooperates for system goals

\- No single point of failure



\*\*Interesting Code Challenges:\*\*



\*\*1. Resource Allocation Without Central Control\*\*

\`\`\`python

\# Traditional

def allocate\_memory(task):

central\_manager.assign(task, resources)



\# LUCA approach

def compete\_for\_resources(task):

broadcast\_need(task)

listen\_for\_offers()

negotiate\_with\_peers()

self\_assign()

\`\`\`



\*\*2. Emergent Behavior\*\*

How do you debug when behavior emerges from 100+ microservices interacting? You don't. You observe patterns and adjust rules.



\*\*3. No Traditional State Management\*\*

State is distributed. Each service has local state. Global state ""emerges"" from interactions.



\*\*What Worked:\*\*

\- Async/await patterns map beautifully to biological processes

\- Event-driven architecture feels natural for this

\- Surprisingly resilient - services die, system adapts

\- Energy efficient (comparatively)



\*\*What Was Hard:\*\*

\- Debugging is philosophical (""why did it do that?"" → ""it emerged"")

\- Testing requires new frameworks (how do you unit test emergence?)

\- Documentation is weird (describing behavior vs. code)

\- Explaining to other devs: ""No, there's no main controller""



\*\*Code Smell or Feature?\*\*

Traditional linters hate this code. ""Where's your entry point?"" ""Why no central state?"" ""This violates separation of concerns!""



But it works. And scales.



\*\*Open Questions:\*\*

\- How do you version control emergent behavior?

\- CI/CD for self-organizing systems?

\- Monitoring when there's no single point to monitor?



\*\*Status:\*\*

\- Multiple iterations completed

\- Reaching out to NVIDIA/AMD/Anthropic

\- Everything open source (will post link if allowed)



\*\*For Devs Interested in Bio-Inspired Code:\*\*



This is weird programming. It violates almost every pattern you learned. But it's fascinating. If you've ever wondered what code would look like if we designed it like nature...



Happy to discuss specific technical implementations, architectural decisions, or why I chose FastAPI over alternatives.



\*\*Background:\*\*

Professional brewer → kombucha production → coffee QA → somehow building AI



Also neurodivergent, which probably explains why I thought this was a good idea.

i had an actual meltdown panic attack from my first injection because new things entering my body absolutely terrify me. after an hour of shaking and crying i realized i wouldn't have an allergic reaction, so i calmed down. and boy i'm glad i just did it!
when i tell you the liberation i felt throughout the week having the ability to NOT binge eat for the first time in DECADES, i could almost cry! even at 2.5mg, i feel an effective appetite suppression. i lost 5 pounds already this week!

the scary part i'm trying to understand is last night, night 6, i had gone to the gym for my usual 1.5-2 hour workout (4x a week) and i felt off immediately. my heart rate sustained around 100-120 at rest for HOURS afterwards... my normal is 65-75. i have been eating 1700 calories daily, around 12,000 calories a week now. before, i was having 17,500 calories weekly. so now working out with the same intensity and apparently not enough fuel was almost putting me in the ER. i nearly passed out! i immediately went home and drank NSA grape juice and ate 2,200 calories total thinking it was low blood sugar. when i woke up today, my heart rate shot to 140 rolling out of bed & i was dizzy. it came back down to 120 and regardless how much i ate it wasn't leveling out. i had such bad anxiety. the ONLY thing that brought me back down was electrolytes but i have them every day i work out already. i'm just confused as to what happened, and why on day 6 and 7. 

i have abused diet pills/legal amphetamines in the past, but i have been sober for 4 years and every EKG shows normal. do you think i should just cut back on working out or force myself to eat more with more electrolytes? hopefully my body adjusts, because i would hate to not be able to continue/up this miracle medication

edit: i did speak to my Ro physician and if it happens again i have to discontinue treatment. also, i stopped coffee today & haven't had much nicotine to help. i've been stable all day. ",2,1762546613.0,Zepbound,5,0.75,False

Referencing first that I’m going to pay for it myself, and I think I’ll end up doing it on my break so I’m not on company time.

So this woman comes in the past couple days all bundled up at open and just gets a coffee and sits in a booth for like my whole 8 hour shift. 

Today she couldn’t afford a coffee so just got a water. I told my dad about it this afternoon and told him I want to buy her a coffee and he’s on board with me. 

Does anyone have advice on how to go about this and if I would get in trouble at all and which parts I could possibly get in trouble for? Would I be able to buy it with my lunch and use my discount or would I have to buy it as a separate with no discount. 

I am somewhat trying to figure out how to go about it and how to not come off as rude or anything to the woman. Any advice is nice. I may be a little too empathetic because it hurts to see her not able to buy just coffee (like my heart just stings for a couple minutes after I see her there)

I want to give it to her but also not come off as like I’m gonna do it often yk? ",5,1762546490.0,McDonaldsEmployees,11,0.78,False

Like everyone else, I've been through this multiple times.


It's even more fine when the outgrowing is mutual - growing apart from your friends as they grow apart from you. You dont get as hurt in this case and you might even still stay friends, albeit not as close. It's fine, whatever 


But when you still see them as your ""main"" friends as they get closer to other people, oh this hurts. 
When they keep mentioning their new friends and their adventures together, when they dont make as much time for you as they make for them, when they seem obviously uninterested in your conversations bc they have other interests now or whatever. It hurts a lot


This is happening to me now with some friends from uni where BTW we just recently graduated. So its not like they're friends from long ago. We used to be so close, spend so much time together. And now one of them has found other friends in the context of a club they've joined and its so painfully obvious they prioritize them over us, and over any other friendships they've had for years. We all went to get coffee, a big group of people, and they only spoke to the others the entire time. They drove us back cause we live closer and the whole car ride they didnt say a thing while the rest of us had a conversationthey could participate in.
