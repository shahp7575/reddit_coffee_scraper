Sumali lang sa group na ito kasi I have this Gorgeous woman that I'm about to take on a date. Taga Mandaluyong siya, ako naman ay sa Pampanga. Hindi pa ako nagawi dyan, or nasubukan lumabas sa Pampanga.

Baka mayroon kayong alam na place sa Mandaluyong na ideal for a first date. Preferably around Megal Mall.

For context, ang plano ko ay nasa dalawa. Either:

1. Dinner date (Chinese)

2. Casual date. Coffee/Tea and snacks, then walk habang food trip, tapos kwentuhan lang para mas feel niya na safe siya.

1n1b1vf,https://i.redd.it/yydcjnuhrilf1.jpeg,I think I’ve arrived,"Some say that once you fall into the espresso loophole, you’ll never be satisfied, you’ll always be craving more. I was on that train too, admiring your beautiful machines and grinders in this sub, watching youtube videos about the latest coffee gear, all while pulling my own shots. But now, I think I’m finally satisfied with what I have. I don’t crave more or better anymore.

This is just my opinion and feel free to share yours, but after three years of pulling shots on my ROK, the ritual itself feels less important than the cup in the end. I’d say I’ve maxed out both this espresso maker and my skills, I don’t think I could get much more efficient. Sure, even an entry-level espresso machine would be faster, but over time I’ve learned to enjoy the process that comes with this manual “machine” the silence, the flexibility, and the simplicity.

Alongside the ROK, I use a Kinu hand grinder. It didn’t give me the best espresso experience at first, until I tried a slightly darker roast. Not only do I enjoy it more than light roasts (I still drink light roast but as pourover), but it’s also much easier and faster to grind. So yes, the coffee itself is just as important as the gear 😃

Then there’s the cup. I tried ceramics, double-walled glass and many others, but I didn’t realize what I really wanted was something sturdy, something that feels solid, just like the ROK or the Kinu grinder. I found that in this notNeutral glass cup. It’s heavy, feels great in the hand, and is versatile, designed for cortados but perfect for espressos as well. It was more expensive than I’d normally spend on a cup, but I bought it as a reward after passing an exam, and I haven’t regretted it once.

With this setup, I feel like I’ve arrived. I no longer feel the need for more or better, and yet I haven’t lost my interest either.

What about you? Have you ever reached that point where you feel content with your setup, or the chase is part of the fun for you?

And what’s your favorite cup to drink espresso from?",5,1756281801.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

*By Your Humorously Analytical Sports Oracle*

---

**Odds Breakdown: The Math of Mayhem**  
Let’s start with the numbers, because even in baseball, math doesn’t lie—unlike Yordan Alvarez’s bat in his last start. The **Houston Astros** are heavy favorites (-150) with moneyline odds of \~1.3, implying a **56.5% chance to win**. The **Colorado Rockies**, meanwhile, are +350 underdogs (\~22.2% implied probability), which is about the same chance I have of explaining a knuckleball without using the word “weird.” The spread? Astros -1.5 (-150) and Rockies +1.5 (+130). The total is set at **8 runs**, with the **Under** getting better odds (1.82–1.87) than the Over (1.95–2.05).

**Why it matters**: The Rockies’ starter, **Tanner Gordon**, has a 7.11 ERA but has made three straight quality starts. The Astros’ **Hunter Brown** is a 2.36 ERA stud… until he’s not. In his last start, he gave up 6 runs in 6⅔ innings. Translation: Brown’s been a rollercoaster, and Gordon’s been a leaky faucet.

---

**News Digest: Injuries, Errors, and the Eternal Struggle of the Rockies**  
The Rockies’ recent win over the Astros was a “snatch victory from the jaws of an 11-game Houston skid” kind of moment. They beat them 6-1, thanks to Hunter Goodman’s 26th homer and Mickey Moniak’s “I-didn’t-need-a-plate-of-noodles” three-RBI double. The Astros? They had **7 errors**, went **0-for-7 with runners in scoring position**, and Yordan Alvarez returned from injury to go 0-for-2. It was like watching a cooking show where the chef forgets to add salt—and then blames the recipe.

**Astros’ defense**: The Astros committed errors, including a Jeremy Peña gaffe that let in a run. Their fielding? A “I-put-the-salt-in-the-coffee” moment.

**Rockies’ pitching**: Gordon has a 1.67 WHIP, which is like a leaky roof in a hurrica

1n1az50,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1n1az50/i_taught_my_buddy_new_tricks_part_two_final/,I Taught my Buddy New Tricks (Part two final),"It's hard to go through withdrawal symptoms, it's even harder finding a job under withdrawal symptoms. Not only is the job market buggered right now, but with my credentials it was near impossible finding a job that was worth anything above minimum wage. Buddy was my burden, I needed to care for him but he scared the shit out of me. I was a mess walking around in public, giving a nervous glance to every dog walking down the street. Could they talk too? How about if I give my roommate liquor, could he hear dogs? Buddy became my life, I needed to uncover his secrets. 

Shit out of luck, I was standing on the corner of my block leaning on a post. Putting my hand in my pocket I felt around for anything. *A five dollar note and a 50 cent coin, great.* The block was near empty except for the odd homeless guy planted on their usual spots. Store wise there was a cafe, some second hand stores and a grocery store in between two bars. Quite the miserable sight. So I went up the street into the cafe to think of my predicament. 

Spending my last 5 dollar note, I sat down to wait for my coffee. *I heard online that if you hold your breath for 1 minute, breath for 30 seconds and repeat that process, you can achieve something similar to being wasted. I'd need to try that later-*

“Excuse me, sir?” Pulled out of my thoughts, I looked up to see a waitress hand me my coffee. 

“Oh thanks. Hey, I was wondering if I could get a job here, do you need any work done around the place?”

She gave a flat faced look, a strand of her hair escaped her bun, lying on her apathetic frown. I immediately knew I wasn't getting the job.

I got up and began to walk out of the place, “It's alright dont worry about it never mind.”

“Wait sir, we're not hiring right now. I'm sorry, but my friend might have a job for you.”

Turning around I returned to her, I was startled by my own pace. “ What have you got? For my expenses I need a job that is above minimum wage but not by much! I'll do anything.”

She was visibly taken back by my outburst.

“Sir… Do you like dogs?”

I rubbed my face, wiping my disappointment off in a clean swipe, “I can deal with dogs, I'm actually taking care of one now.” I sighed reluctantly.

“Well my friend runs a pound a couple blocks over, If you want I can get his number for you? Put in a good word?” She then bent over, scribbling the name, address and number of the place onto a napkin before handing it to me.

“You're a lifesaver, thank you so much.”

I left that store a different man. The sun was brighter, the humidity was warmer and people were smiling. What a day. I didn't even care that I had to walk an hour a day to my new potential job. Even though I had to deal with more dogs, I came up around to the dog issue. Potential experiments were endless.

Making my way there was quite the mission. Not a wonder in the world why I miss this shop everytime I pass by here. My local pound was placed in between two long brick buildings, it looked like the letter H. It opened up slightly when you walked into the glorified alleyway, a rusty gate to the left with a dilapidated building in the middle. At the top of the building lay a deflated inflatable wiener dog, its head flopped over the front roof, a strangled neck, barely keeping the head from falling off.

Swinging the door open came the sound of a ring and a choir of barking dogs. A symphony of muffled barks and howls echoed around the waiting room and the front desk. The sound was emanating from behind the desk in a long corridor, sealed by a wooden door. Behind the front desk sat a large man with a rotund frame.

“Hi, do you work here?”

The man folded his arms, they looked like tree trunks. “Work here? I own this place, how can I help you?”

“I was looking for a job sir.”

“A job? What's your credentials?”

“Dropped out of highschool, I worked at a corporate building for a while, I was the paperboy.” His brow stayed in a stern manner, clearly unimpressed. “I like dogs, I have a dog.” An uncomfortable silence followed this. The Man still had his arms folded, I could see a small patch of mustard in his moustache.

“Well son, are you fine with cleaning up dog shit? Are you fine with putting dogs down? What about handling potentially dangerous animals, with rabies and all of that.”

“Sir please, I'm desperate, I'll do anything.” 

“Show me any form of registration.”

I handed him my old highschool ID from a few years prior, I didn't have a drivers license just yet so that ID was all I really had at the time.

“Youre hired, we can do the paperwork later.”

“Great! When can I start?”

“Right now son, I need an extra pair of hands today” He got up grabbing a key from his key ring to the holding room.

“Got some mess you need to clean.”

I had no clue what they fed those dogs and I did not want to find out. The shift was long and tedious but pay was pay. I hated my apartment door late at night, the loud whining and squealing of the hinges would always wake up half the building. Before I could close the door, my roommate stormed out of his room and gave me his classic friendly welcome home.

“Let me smell your breath.”

“No I'm not doing any of that shit anymore I promise.” Buddy was no longer in his usual spot under the fridge, I had no clue where he was.

“Well then why have you been out so long huh? I care about you man, you can't be treating your body this way.”

“I told you I wasn't doing anything of that kind.” I closed the door behind me, “I got a job.”

“A job?” He looked like he was looking for the definition before returning to me in a friendly gaze. “Oh man, that's actually really cool. I'm sorry, where's your work?” 

“At the pound, let me tell you it's not a pretty job.”

“Work is work man, hey maybe next time you go there you can take Buddy with you, he's been weird as shit recently.”

“Besides constantly avoiding you?”

“No no I've gotten used to that,” he wiped his jaw downwards, “yea no its weird ill just show you.”

My roommate led me into my bedroom where Buddy was. He was seated up right a few feet away from my small bookshelf. 

“Yea he's been doing that ever since you left, he hasn't even eaten anything. His eyes have just been darting up and down each book. It's weird.”

“Buddy?” I walked up to the dog's large frame, he was so still. “You alright Buddy?” Peering closer I realised that the dog was dead still, he lacked the animation of breathing. Just a slight turn of his head and eyes peering at each book was the slightest clue to tell us that he wasn't a statue. He looked like a puppet. Shaking the dog did nothing, he was stationary. His folds rippled at the shake of my hands and yet I couldn't move his large frame. I grabbed a blanket from my bed and flung it over the shelf. Buddy immediately stood on his fours and walked out of the room, nudging my roommate out of the way causing him to stumble. Following him out of the room, we saw him seated at the base of the kitchen, staring up into the top shelf. This time he was looking at an Edmonds cookbook.

“Okay Buddy, it's late, time for bed.” I said, nervously shifting the book to the back of the shelf. Buddy made many rounds around the apartment after that, analyzing each room he went into. Meanwhile, my roommate and I would attempt to hide every book Buddy laid eyes upon. Finally, when there were no books in sight, the dog went to rest. There was no more stomping, no scrambling around the place, nothing. I walked back into my room to rest (I had a big shift the next day). When I took a look at the bookshelf, I was surprised to find that I must've missed the bottom shelf as there was a solitary book sitting in the corner. I'm surprised it was there in the first place as I hadn't seen it in months. There it was, standing upright with an imprint of a golden colour. Completely observable to the naked eye was a King James Bible.

The pay wasn't bad but the smell of the place was rancid. A harsh mix of dog food, stale air and a touch of hot dog breath. I had to clean the stalls and work the front desk, begging people to take the animals home. I had that job for about 2 months, my roommate was so proud of me it was actually pretty sweet. Things changed however back at home, Buddy wouldn't bark. He wouldn't speak anymore. He would just lumber about the place causing the wooden floorboards to groan under his weight.

I wasn't finished with Buddy though, after paying back my debts I found myself once again at the local bottle shop. Just another visit, I promise. This time however I needed to make a detour. Grabbing 3 bottles of Absolut and placing them into my bag, I made my way out of the luminescent store. I hated the bottle shop, it was like my old job with a cubicle. A place you'd always force your way into with a tough time getting out.

So ever since I worked at the pound, I always had this deep itch. A deep obsession with this theory, and that night was the night I would succumb to my desires. I had built enough cash for a few more weeks at the apartment with some more bottles to boot, getting fired really wasn't much of an issue. Besides, I'd have more time on my hands, more time for Buddy.

Under the yellow glow next to the side gate of the pound, I gently placed my bag to the ground. I was very conscious not to be too harsh, I didn't want the bottles in there to break as a result of my tools. Snapping the lock with my bolt cutters I opened the whining gate bringing my supplies in. there were 3 cameras on my way into the holding room for the animals, I didn't care I was gonna get caught. Most of the dogs were sleeping so it was pretty quiet. There were about 22 cages, each containing dogs of different size, stature and breed. So many variables, this will be perfect. Folding my legs onto the ground I zipped down the bag and got a bottle of Absolut, my old stereo and my boxset of the audible Oxford Dictionary. *Let the experiment begin.*

“You want some? Huh? Cmooonn it's good for you.” I was swinging my bottle left and right in front of an old Border Collie Labradour cross. Its chocolate eyes were that of a void like nature. Taking out my notepad I jotted down some notes. ‘Labradoor Bordr ColLy crosS Is not GOod,’ sober me would have to figure that one out later. I rested my head against the wire cage, “You know I was gonna put you down right? What? You got nothing to say? Okay okaaayyy,” I took another swig, “nooooo I wasn't, you thought for a second though don't lie to me.” I turned up the stereo.

“Formula, formulae or formulas. Noun. A group of letters, numbers, and symbols which stand for a mathematical or scientific rule.” The deadpan voice from the speaker echoed through the hallway, causing an eruption of barks and growls. Now the sound was too loud, headache inducing. *Must've turned it too far up again,* I brought it back to a low hush, some nice background noise for the occasion.

“ROUGH ROUGH!”

“What's that? I should give you some? I already gave you some buddy you didn't want it!”

“Buddy yeah right Buddy, why can he speak but you cant, you're a dog. Come on, please speak.”

“ROUGH ROUGH ROUGH!” Its nose was buried by its small paws.

“Who am I kidding, you can't speak for shit.” There's my cue, the dog was a failed experiment, time to head home. “No I can't spend the rest of my bottles on you, my further studies lie on Buddy, salut my furry friend.” 

I tucked my Absolute back into my bag, the bottles joined together in a clinking sound and I zipped up the bag carefully. Looking up I heard the jingle of the front door. This was followed by a few high pitched yelps, they mostly dissipated as footsteps swung around the front desk with sounds of swinging keys.

“Whose in here hello?” Shit my boss. He must have a silent alarm in here. Opening the door to the all I was in he shone a flashlight on me in my pile, halfway from getting up.

“Oh uhhhh hello there,” *Shit how do I get out of this,* “Hey look ill pay for the gate I'm sorry.”

“What are you doing here at midnight?” When I got up he saw my bottle, about half done.

“Okay look man I can explain.” That was when the flood gates opened, I told him everything. I told him about my roommate, my alcoholism and the fact my dog tells me to kill my roommate but only when I drink. I even told him why I was there in the first place, all through a flurry of drunken speech. I couldn't see my boss’s face, he was still shining that light, blinding me from seeing his expression.

“I'm calling the cops.” He said with a soft tone.

“Please don't I have more work to-” I stopped in my trail of speech as I could see my ex boss lowering his flashlight, his face was unforgettable. You know the one, the one of disgust mixed with prolonged disappointment.

“Get out.”



The journey back to my apartment was quicker on the way back, streetlights blurred as I booked it down the middle of the street. I would say it was about 20 minutes before I was back to the base floor of my apartment. If I wasn't wanted for breaking and entering, I would've loved to look at the street a little longer. The red corolla parked slightly on the curb, the reflective nature of the puddles pooling. I thought it was odd that there were no stars out.

Slowly opening the front apartment door I saw Buddy seated on the couch. He looked as if he was my therapist. “*How are you mate, doing okay? Why don't you sit on the chair and tell me about this dog problem of yours?”* Of course the dog wasn't talking, he would soon however. Dragging a wooden chair over and sitting adjacent to Buddy, I cracked the next bottle of Absolut open.

“Hey Buddy we talk again.” I slurred, Buddy remained stationary. “What not got anything to say man? It's been monthhss let's catch up a bit.”

“Kill your roommate.”

“You're still going on about this? Still no I won't do it.”

“Kill your roommate tonight, it must happen.”

“First some answers Buddy, why were you read-”

“The police will arrive at your premises in 10 minutes in order to prosecute you for your previous actions. Throw your third bottle of liquor at your roommate.”

“How do you-”

“He will fall to the floor breaking parietal bone which will induce brain bleed. Death will occur usually within 3 to 4 minutes so you should perform this action-”

“NO! I SAY NO! I WON'T DO IT!” I wiped the spit from my face. 

“Kill your roommate or you will suffer the most dire of consequences.”

“I know what you are now, you are a BAD dog, you're bad for me!” Buddy remained unphased, “You used to be a good boy! What happened, why did you change?!”

“If you follow me you will be a king of kings, defy me and you will live in eternal darkness, with the rest.”

I had my jaw wide open, there was truly no time for discussion. I had the choice that would determine the rest of my life. The beady chocolate eyes of Buddy remained unblinking, paused until my next answer. Reaching into my duffel bag I grabbed the extra bottle of the liquor, wielding my last two bottles in both hands. Buddy changed form. No longer was Buddy in his sedentary state, his two front paws propped his mass off of the couch. A low growl hummed out of him. Raising both bottles above my head I was prepared to give it all away, to let this evil vanquish. Buddy smacked its paws onto the creaky floor once more, letting a fierce bark out. He began to charge, teeth bared, thick drops of saliva stuck to his neck like pale worms. 

He was about 2 meters away from me when he launched at me. As his left paw connected with my right shoulder, I slammed both bottles of glass down onto Buddy’s forehead. I then felt the full weight of Buddy as we both slammed into the tv behind us. I was winded, bad. I heard a deep rolling pop as my shoulder exited from its socket, it laid lagging behind my body as it slooped onto the floor. A deep fire burned as 221 pounds of weight pushed it further and further away from the socket. I was screaming with gritted teeth. Buddy rolled over, off my left shoulder, feeling the weight release off of me. *Steady breaths in and out.* I was choking on air, uncalculated motions of my lungs prevailed, wild frantic breaths. Air was entering but not filtering, I caught myself from falling to my right with a sturdy hand and I stayed there. *In and out*. When I caught my breath, I looked over to see Buddy regaining motion. First his head lolled up facing the corner, with the underside of his paw still trapped under his belly. He dragged his paw out from his frame and slammed it into the wooden floorboards. Buddy’s head swung up and down like was nodding at a statement the corner made. He turned his head at me, fragments of glass stuck to Buddy’s forehead. A thick drizzle of blood flowed down between his eyes, mixing in with the froth surrounding his snarl. The eyes were still dark but with a hint of red, his eyes were stinging.

When Buddy raised himself from the floor, I cowered backwards, attempting to grab anything else I could throw. Buddy stumbled around the back of the couch, hiding from my sight.

“HEY! Get out of here! The dog! Get out!” I yelled out. My roommate was already around the corner.

“What the hell is going on?!” His thin hands grabbed onto the side of the breakfast bar. Craning his neck behind the couch, he slowly began to walk backwards. I could now see Buddy’s head appear on the right of the couch, about a few meters away from him. When Buddy fastened his pace from a stumble to a gallop, my roommate sprinted for the door, swinging it nearly off its hinges. Buddy was gaining fast, my roommate raised up his leg and sent a swift foot into the direction of Buddy’s snout. Buddy opened his jaw, disappearing the foot into the mouth. A scream followed as my roommate yanked his foot away. His right foot was filtered through Buddy’s sharp fangs. Deep rivers of red emanated out of his foot right up to the top of his ankle. His foot sat in a weird position in comparison to the rest of his leg, his heel connecting for a second with the base of his calf, swinging effortlessly. The next and last thing I saw of my roommate alive was him letting go of the door, hobbling out into the hallway outside the apartment. Rumbling erupted from the floor as Buddy launched into a hot pursuit.

I don't know in what order, but I heard screams mixed with thuds and growls. I was planted. The liquor in my system was still prevalent but was fading quick. A harsh reality was washing over me. I needed to get up, to help. Flames licked the left side of my top half as my arm swung like a pendulum clock. Limping my way into the hallway I turned to face a stained row of doors. The only light present being the moonlight sifting through the back window at the end of the hall. 

*Growl, rip, thud.*

*Thud, rip growl.*

*Rip thud thud.*

The dog had my roommate in his jaws. Buddy’s fangs seeped into the side of his torso effortlessly. My roommate's head and limbs were knocking on the sides of the walls. Back and forward over and over again. Sharp angles of bone stuck out from all appendages, making Buddy's job of carrying him even easier. Buddy turned his head around to face me, my roommate's temple dragged along the right wall as the dog forcefully turned around, his chew toy still in his jaws.

I was sniffling. I was tired. I was walking towards that thing I once called my Buddy. 

The dog was standing firm, territorial. I leaned on the side of the wall and just watched the sight for what felt like minutes. I whispered through a raspy breath.

“Go.”

The dog swung his body around, and my roommate's head hit the wall with a crack on the left wall in a whip-like manner. The hall shook as the dog began to gallop away. The change in motion caused me to slump down into a pile on the floor. Squinting at an irregular angle, I saw the dog with his prey launch himself through the window at the end of the hall. My roommates head and feet gave way on either side of the window, causing a synchronized snapping sound, complimenting the sound of glass breaking. The shattering glass seemed to freeze midair, reflecting pale moonlight like a macabre disco ball.

*Silence* 

I was alerted back into the action with the sound of a siren and an earth shattering crash. A metallic howl pierced its way out from the opening in the window made by the dog. It took me a while to reach the window, by then I completely lost the effects of alcohol so it was only pain that resided within me. My shoulder felt irreparable and I must've twisted my ankle in an odd fashion when I hit that corner. Either way I made it to the window. My limbs were illuminated in a fierce pale light as I rested over the base of the window, cutting my arms in the process on the jagged breakage of the glass.

The dog was inanimate, sideways on top of a red Corolla, a mangled mess of exposed bone and shards of glass. The dog's jaw was wide open, a pool of red drool was dripping out. My roommate was face down about a metre to the left of the smashed car, his innards pooling in the shadows. A large crater wrapped around the dog. The headlights of the vehicle were flashing sporadically, screaming for attention. The howling siren from the car echoed through the block, combining with the sounds of police sirens. Exhaling, the steam from my breath greying out the scene. I found the stars. There they were sprinkled around the scene, shards from the window reflecting moonlight.



Commotion from the street became muffled as I turned away. Hobbling back into my apartment I seated myself on the couch. It smelled like dog. I turned my head into the kitchen. Sitting alone was a spilt tin bowl of water and a torn collar.

1n1az14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creepypastastories/comments/1n1az14/it_was_my_creepiest_night_ever/,It Was My Creepiest Night Ever,"I never thought I’d be the kind of man who aims his rifle scope at another living person.  
But boredom has a way of twisting your routines into something you’d rather not admit out loud.

I’d rented this apartment in Detroit, East Side. Cheap place, temporary deal—three months tops, just to be close to a contracting job. It was one of those tall, worn-down complexes: brown brick, peeling paint, neighbors arguing in the hallways. The rent was low because the landlord knew no one sane wanted to stay here longer than necessary. And me? I didn’t care. I wasn’t planning on putting down roots.

Evenings were the problem. Work was boring, sure, but at least it kept my hands busy. Back home, I had nothing. No cable—I wasn’t about to waste money on that. Mobile data was enough, and signing a long-term internet contract didn’t make sense when I knew I’d be gone before the ink dried. I had a couple books, but I burned through those in the first week. That left me with long nights, a thin mattress, and silence thick enough to choke on.

So I turned to the only hobby I’d brought with me: my Remington 700. Bought it second-hand at a gun show a few years back. Cleaned it up myself, fitted it with a decent scope. Nothing fancy, just a reliable bolt-action rifle. I’d never fired it at anything living, and I didn’t plan to. But I liked the weight of it, the precision. Looking through the glass made me feel steady, like the world narrowed into a clean circle where everything was sharp and in focus.

At first, it was innocent. I’d set it on the table by the window, draw the curtains just enough to leave a slit, and line up the scope with rooftops and street signs. Ranging distances, testing how steady my hand was after coffee, after a long day, after two beers. Just practice.

Then, one night, I slid the crosshairs across the building opposite mine. Another twelve-story complex, maybe two hundred yards away. A whole wall of glowing rectangles, each window a little TV screen playing a different channel. And once I started, I couldn’t stop.

The first night hooked me right away. Dozens of glowing windows across the street, each one a private stage I wasn’t supposed to see. People arguing, eating, laughing, living. I told myself it was just curiosity, just something to pass the time. But the truth is, it felt wrong—and that was part of the pull. The fact that they couldn’t see me, while I could see everything, gave me a rush that was half excitement, half guilt. Like I’d crossed into a place I wasn’t supposed to be, and found it too fascinating to leave.

It’s funny how boredom makes you cross lines you swore you’d never cross.  
Loneliness teaches you habits you’d never admit in daylight.

Over the next few nights, the habit stuck. I’d come home, heat up some leftovers, maybe drink a beer, then pull the curtains just enough and lean into the scope. The apartment complex across the street turned into my private theater. Dozens of shows, none of them knowing they had an audience.

Most people would probably call it sick. And maybe it was. But for me, it was survival. Better to be the watcher than the man alone in the dark with nothing but his thoughts.

When you stare into other people’s lives long enough, you realize how predictable we all are. Most windows replay the same story, night after night.  
But every now and then, something new slips through the cracks.

It was on the eighth night that I noticed him.

A window on the eighth floor. At first glance, nothing unusual—just a dim, bare room with yellowing wallpaper and a single bed pushed into the corner. A naked bulb dangled from the ceiling. The rest was empty: a couple chairs stacked in the corner, a rug that had seen better decades. The kind of space you’d expect in a building like this—cheap, forgotten, temporary.

But the figure on the bed was what stopped me.

He was sitting cross-legged, back straight, facing the wall. His head was completely bald, skin pale under the light. He was shirtless, skinny to the point of wrong—his spine curved under the skin like a row of knots pulled too tight. His arms dangled long at his sides, fingertips brushing his knees. He didn’t move. Not once.

I held my breath, watching him. Maybe he was meditating. Maybe asleep sitting up. Maybe dead. Hell, maybe it wasn’t even a person—maybe a mannequin someone left behind. I tried to convince myself of all those things, but none of them stuck. Something about him made the hair rise on the back of my neck.

I swept the scope across the wall he was staring at. Nothing there. No posters, no pictures, not even cracks that might hold his attention. Just peeling wallpaper, water stains, the color of old teeth. I shifted back to him. Still motionless. Still staring.

Most people move, even if just to scratch their nose.  
But that night, he didn’t. And I knew I’d be back at the window tomorrow.

The eighth-night discovery should have scared me off. Any reasonable man would have looked at that pale figure in the bare room, muttered something about “not my business,” and turned away.  
But the truth? It made me hungrier.

Soon, watching the building across the street wasn’t just a way to kill time—it was my ritual. Every evening after work, I’d heat up something cheap, crack open a beer, and settle into my spot at the window. Curtains drawn just enough, scope angled across the gap, my eye drinking in those glowing rectangles.

I had plenty of windows to choose from, but a few became my favorites.

There was the single mom with two kids. Her boys treated the living room like a trampoline park, bouncing off the couch while she dragged herself in after work. Sometimes she’d yell, sometimes she’d laugh, sometimes she just sank into the sofa with a bottle of cheap wine and stared through the TV like she was miles away. I didn’t pity her—I respected her. She kept going, even when it was obvious she had nothing left in the tank.

Then there was the young couple. They were relentless, like they’d made a bet with themselves to see how many ways two people could wear each other out before sunrise. At first, it was entertaining—like stumbling across a pay-per-view show for free—but eventually it was just predictable. Still, I kept watching. Predictability can be comforting.

And then the gymnast girl. Twelve, maybe thirteen. Every night she stretched, jumped rope, practiced handstands in her tiny living room. Always in that faded leotard, hair pulled tight. No distractions, no breaks, just pure repetition. Watching her was like seeing focus distilled into a kid’s body. She reminded me that discipline was possible—even in a place where everything else seemed to fall apart.

I never told myself they were “neighbors.” Neighbors are people you wave to in the hallway. These weren’t people I knew; they were characters in a show only I could watch. And each of them pulled me deeper into the habit.

But the bald man—he wasn’t just another character. He was a puzzle. And puzzles have a way of eating at you if you leave them unsolved.

A week passed. Every night, the same scene: him sitting cross-legged on the bed, motionless, eyes fixed on the wall. Sometimes the sheets on the bed looked slightly different, as if someone had changed them while I wasn’t looking. But him? He never moved.

One night, after two beers, I decided to break the script. I wanted to see if I could force something to happen.

I pulled up my phone and ordered a pizza. Large pepperoni, extra cheese. Delivery to apartment 8B—the bald man’s floor, his window. My hands were sweating as I typed in the address. I told myself it was harmless. If he was a normal guy, he’d answer the door, pay, and eat. And I’d finally know.

Half an hour later, I spotted the delivery car pulling up to the curb. My heart thudded in my chest as the driver walked inside with the box balanced on his arm. I tightened the scope on 8B’s window, waiting for movement. Any movement.

Five minutes passed. Ten. Then, out of the corner of the scope, I caught the driver coming back out the front doors of the building.

He wasn’t carrying the pizza anymore.

Instead, he had the box open in one hand, munching on a slice, earbuds in, nodding his head to whatever he was listening to. By the time he reached his car, he was whistling, chewing happily, like nothing strange had happened at all.

I sat back, cold all over. Where had the pizza gone? Why hadn’t he taken money? Why hadn’t anyone answered? Did he just… keep it for himself? Or had he gone up there, knocked, and walked away with the box untouched?

I wanted to believe the driver was just lazy, that he figured no one was home and he might as well eat it himself. But that explanation didn’t stick. Something had happened in there—something I couldn’t see.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. I lay awake with the rifle beside me, scope pointed at the window, curtains cracked just enough for me to keep watch. He was still there, sitting in the same position, like nothing had changed.

Most people, I reminded myself, live entire lives without ever being noticed. But once you notice someone like that, you can’t stop.

And the worst part?  
I was starting to feel like he’d noticed me back.

The pizza stunt should have been my wake-up call. A normal person would’ve felt embarrassed, maybe laughed it off as a dumb idea, and moved on. But I wasn’t normal anymore. By then, watching that window wasn’t just a habit—it was an obsession.

Every night I found myself glued to the scope, waiting for the slightest twitch of movement. Nothing ever came. The mom yelled at her kids, the couple broke their own records, the gymnast girl trained until her arms shook. Life went on in all the other windows. But in 8B, nothing changed. A pale body sitting cross-legged, staring at the wall.

And the more nothing happened, the more it burned me alive.

I started timing how long I could keep my eye in the scope without blinking. Sometimes I sat so long I forgot to eat. Sometimes I went to bed dizzy, with black rings floating in my vision. But I kept watching.

That’s when I noticed the woman.

It was a weekday afternoon—I’d left work early. Through the scope, I saw her slip into the room. Mid-thirties, maybe older, dark hair pulled back, moving carefully, like a nurse on rounds. She carried a tray: a small vial, a couple of boxes. She set it down on the bed beside him. Then she leaned close, pressed something against his arm. I couldn’t see clearly from my angle, but it looked like an injection. He never flinched.

When she finished, she crossed the room to the window. Instead of turning her back on him, she shuffled sideways, her face always angled toward the figure on the bed. She cracked the window, lit a cigarette, and smoked it down to the filter. Then she stubbed it out, closed the window, gathered the tray, and backed out the door—never once turning away from him.

I told myself she was a caretaker, maybe hired to look after a relative. But something about the way she moved chilled me. The way she never let him out of her sight, like she was afraid he’d pounce if she turned around.

For the next few nights, I tracked her routine. Every other day, almost to the hour, she entered with her tray, gave him the injection, smoked her cigarette, and left. Always backing out. Always keeping her eyes locked on him.

It gnawed at me until I couldn’t stand it anymore. Watching wasn’t enough. I needed to know what was happening inside that room.

So one Friday night, when I saw her leave the building with a shopping bag, I grabbed my jacket and headed across the street.

The building’s hallway smelled of dust and old cigarettes. Fluorescent lights flickered overhead, buzzing like dying insects. I climbed to the eighth floor, every step heavier than the last.

The corridor stretched out in front of me, lined with dented doors. At the far end, junk was piled high: broken furniture, boxes, a bicycle frame, a rusted wheelchair tipped against the wall. And in that cluttered corner sat the door I’d been staring at for weeks—Apartment 8B.

I stood there, heart pounding, palms sweating. What the hell was I doing? Breaking into a stranger’s apartment? Looking for what, exactly?

I told myself I’d just listen at the door, maybe confirm he was even real. But then, beneath the thud of my heartbeat, I heard it.

A sound.

“Shhhwaaaark… shhhwaaaark…”

Slow, dragging footsteps. Getting closer.

I froze. The noise stopped right behind the door.

And then the handle began to rattle.

Not just a twist—violent jerks, like someone was yanking it back and forth, trying to tear it off. The door groaned under sudden pressure, hinges squealing as if something heavy leaned against it from the other side.

My blood turned to ice.

Through the thin wood, I heard it: breathing. Wet, ragged, wheezing like air being forced through a crushed windpipe. Each inhale whistled, each exhale hissed, closer than I’d ever wanted it to be.

The handle kept thrashing. The frame shook. For one terrible second, I was sure it would burst open.

That broke me.

I bolted. Down the hallway, down the stairs, feet barely touching the steps. I don’t even remember crossing the lobby. All I know is I hit the cold night air like a drowning man breaking the surface.

By the time I circled the block and made it back to my own apartment, my lungs were on fire. I slammed the door, locked it, and stumbled to my window. My rifle was waiting, scope already aimed across the gap.

I pressed my eye to the glass—

And there he was.

Not cross-legged anymore. Not facing the wall.

He was standing at the window, hands spread against the glass, pale fingers scraping downward with a squeal I swore I could hear from across the street. His enormous head tilted forward, and in the glow of that naked bulb, I saw his face for the first time.

No nose, no lips. Just two cavernous pits sinking too deep into his skull, eyes that weren’t eyes at all but endless dark holes, as if they could swallow the light from my scope. And yet—at the very bottom of that darkness, something moved. A shimmer, a twitch, like a pupil shifting in a place where no eye should be. His mouth gaped open and closed, smearing spit across the glass, fingers scraping with nails too long, too sharp.

And the worst part?  
I knew he was staring directly at me.

I don’t remember pulling away from the scope. One second I was frozen there, staring into those bottomless eyes, and the next I was stumbling backward, knocking over the chair. My hands were moving on their own, reaching for the box of ammo I kept in the closet.

The rifle had always been a comfort to me—steel and wood, simple and reliable. But loading it now felt different. My fingers fumbled as I shoved cartridges into the magazine, each metallic click ringing too loud in the silence of the room. I kept telling myself: if he moved, if he tried anything, I’d put a bullet straight through that window.

By the time I racked the bolt and raised the rifle again, my heart was beating so hard I could feel it in my teeth. I pressed my eye to the glass.

The window across the street was no longer empty. The curtains were drawn tight, swaying slightly as if someone had just pulled them shut. No pale face. No black holes for eyes. Just heavy fabric, rippling in the glow of the ceiling bulb.

I held there, waiting, the crosshairs steady on the center of the window. Sweat slid down my cheek, caught in the corner of my mouth. My finger hovered on the trigger, but there was nothing to fire at.

I stayed like that for what felt like hours. My shoulders ached, my eyes burned, but I couldn’t lower the rifle. Every second I expected those curtains to twitch, to slide open, to reveal that face pressed against the glass again.

They never did.

When I finally lowered the rifle, the apartment felt colder, emptier than before. Sometimes silence doesn’t mean safety. Sometimes it only means something dangerous learned how to wait. The moment something breaks its own pattern, you realize you were never the one in control. As if he hadn’t disappeared, just… stepped out of view. As if he was still there, inches from the fabric, waiting for me to let my guard down.

And I realized something that made my stomach twist: he’d never once moved while I was watching. But tonight, he had chosen to.

I moved out the very next morning. No questions, no excuses—just cash on the table for the landlord and a half-hearted promise to forward the mail I knew I’d never see. He didn’t ask why. Maybe he saw the look on my face and decided he didn’t want the answer.

The weeks that followed blurred together. New job sites, new temporary housing, different walls to stare at when sleep refused to come. I told myself I’d left it behind on that street in Detroit, left him behind.

But the truth? He followed me.

Not in the daylight—no. In the daylight, I can almost convince myself it was nothing, that I imagined the whole thing. But at night, in dreams too sharp to be dreams, I hear it. The frantic rattle of a doorknob, the hinges straining as something leans its weight against my door. That wheezing, broken breath sliding through the cracks.

And every time, I reach for my rifle. I load it, I raise it, I press the trigger—  
and every time, it jams.

So I clean it. Again and again. I polish the barrel, I oil the bolt, I run patches until the cloth comes out white. I tell myself it won’t fail me again.

But what bothers me most isn’t the dreams.  
It’s the memory of that night—when he saw me.

You can leave a place behind, but not the things that noticed you there.  
A weapon is supposed to give you certainty. But once doubt creeps in, even steel feels fragile.

And since then, I’m not sure I trust my rifle anymore.

If you're craving island life that’s chill, clean, and easy to explore, without the traffic jams, noise, and party overload of mainland Bali - let me introduce you to Nusa Lembongan and Nusa Ceningan.

I've visited both many times and often recommend them to friends who want the Bali feel but without the chaos.

# Where Are They?

* Just off Bali’s southeast coast - a 30-minute fast boat from Sanur.
* [Lembongan](https://mybalitrips.com/en/tour-nusa-lembongan/?utm_source=reddit) and Ceningan are two of the three Nusa Islands (the third is [Nusa Penida](https://mybalitrips.com/en/oneday-nusa-penida/?utm_source=reddit)).
* Lembongan is bigger and more developed; Ceningan is smaller, greener, and quieter.
* Connected by a cute yellow suspension bridge - you can walk or scooter across in 2 minutes.

# Why Go?

Relaxed pace & easy access

* Great for 2–4 day escapes from Bali or slow travel stays.
* Easy to get around on a scooter or even on foot — no long distances, no Grab, no stress.

White sand beaches & turquoise water

* Dreamy swimming coves like Sandy Bay, Tamarind Beach, and Secret Beach.
* Most beaches are clean, swimmable, and never crowded.

Laid-back island life

* Wake up with the sun, scooter to the beach, grab a smoothie, read a book, repeat.
* Very few hawkers. Locals are chill and used to respectful tourism.

# Water Activities

* Snorkeling: You can snorkel right off the beach, or join tours to Manta Point (on nearby Nusa Penida).
* Diving: Several reputable dive shops on Lembongan - marine life is solid here.
* Surfing: Three main breaks — Playgrounds, Lacerations, Shipwrecks — mostly for intermediate surfers.
* SUP/Kayaking: Calm mangroves and bays are perfect for paddleboards and exploring.

# Where to Eat & Chill

Lembongan has a decent (and growing) food scene:

* The Deck – oceanfront sunset cocktails.
* Tigerlillys – great brunch and coffee.
* Ginger & Jamu – plant-based with a view.
* Oishii – surprisingly good sushi.
* Kaya Point (Ceningan) – epic view, relaxed vibe.

Don't expect Canggu-style variety, but for a small island, it’s excellent.

# Where to Stay

* Budget: Guesthouses in Jungut Batu (Lembongan) or hidden homestays on Ceningan.
* Mid-range: Bali Hai Tide Huts, Dini D’nusa, or Nusa Indah Bungalows.
* Luxury: Batu Karang Lembongan Resort, Tamarind Resort, or Le Pirate on Ceningan.

Many hotels offer seaweed farm views, volcano views, or direct beach access.

# How to Get There

* Fast boats from Sanur, Serangan, or Padang Bai (\~30–45 minutes).
* Operators: Rocky, Arthamas, D’Camel — prices start \~250k–300k IDR one way.
* Most offer hotel pickup/drop-off in South Bali or Ubud.

# Who Will Love It?

* Couples, solo travelers, small groups
* Families with kids (the beaches are super safe)
* Surfers & divers who want a base without the Penida crowds
* People who hate Bali’s traffic and just want to chill, swim, scooter, and eat well

# Who It’s Not For

* Hardcore party people (there are beach bars, but no clubs)
* People who can’t live without Grab or GoFood
* Digital nomads who need co-working hubs (Wi-Fi is decent, but work culture isn’t a thing here)

# Bonus Tip: Combine It!

* Do a Nusa Islands loop: 👉 Lembongan → Ceningan → Penida 4–6 days total is perfect if you're island-hopping.
* Or do a mainland detox: 👉 Ubud → Lembongan → Sidemen → Amed For max peace and minimal crowds.

# Final Thoughts

Nusa Lembongan and Ceningan feel like what mainland Bali used to be - relaxed, scenic, and not too busy (yet).  
If you’re burned out on traffic and TikTok spots, come here to reset and actually enjoy the island energy Bali was once known for.

For the last photo, I don't know which one to choose. Should I use a picture of me hiking, or one with my friends?

Running and hiking were my old hobbies, and I wish to get back to enjoying them again.
Now, I am active and I lift weights five days a week.
I can work, cook, and do chores.
I do not wear make up or use filters.(Should I learn to use make up?)

Bumble frequently pushes my fitness photo to be the first one. How can I fix this? I want a guy to focus on my character more than my physical body.

I have been on two dates:
1. At a coffee shop: I bought him a donut, and he bought me a drink.
2. At a restaurant: He paid, but I bought him a relief balm because he said his legs were sore from running.

I am a bit tired of dating. I am considering to quit. 😅 Could you please suggest how to create a profile to meet a serious guy?

Should I get more fit and toned before I join dating pool again? I am quite chubby in my country’s standards.

English is not my first language, so I apologize in advance for any mistakes. I am working on improving it.

1n1av9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineEmbroidery/comments/1n1av9b/raster_to_vector_conversion_turning_images_into/,Raster to Vector Conversion: Turning Images into Precision Artwork,"We live in a digital-first world where high-quality graphics are more important than ever. Whether you’re a business owner, designer, or print shop operator, you’ve probably faced the frustration of working with pixelated or blurry images. That’s where Raster to Vector Conversion comes in.

This process transforms low-resolution, pixel-based images into scalable vector files that maintain sharpness and clarity at any size. From logos to artwork, vector graphics are the gold standard for printing, embroidery, signage, and digital use.

Let’s break down why Raster to Vector Conversion matters, how it works, and why it’s a game-changer for businesses and creative professionals alike.

# What is Raster to Vector Conversion?

Raster images (like JPG, PNG, or BMP files) are made up of tiny pixels. While they look fine on screens, they lose quality when resized. Ever zoomed in on a picture and seen it turn into a blur of colored squares? That’s the limitation of raster images.

Vector images, on the other hand, are built on mathematical formulas—lines, curves, and points—meaning they can be scaled infinitely without losing sharpness. Converting a raster file into vector format ensures your design remains crisp, no matter the size.

# Why Raster to Vector Conversion is Important

1. **Scalability:** Vector files can be resized for small tags or giant billboards without distortion.
2. **Print-Ready Files:** Printers, embroiderers, and engravers prefer vector files for accuracy.
3. **Professional Branding:** A clean, scalable logo enhances credibility.
4. **Easy Editing:** Colors, shapes, and details can be adjusted effortlessly in vector files.
5. **Compatibility:** Vector formats (AI, EPS, SVG, PDF) are widely accepted across industries.

If your brand’s logo is only available in JPEG format, converting it into a vector ensures it’s usable for every medium—from business cards to embroidered caps.

# Industries That Rely on Raster to Vector Conversion

* **Embroidery & Digitizing:** Converting artwork into vector files ensures precise stitching.
* **Printing & Packaging:** Printers need scalable files for labels, boxes, and banners.
* **Advertising & Signage:** Billboards, posters, and vehicle wraps require high-resolution graphics.
* **Apparel & Fashion:** Custom t-shirt designs often start as vector files for screen printing.
* **Architectural & Engineering:** Technical drawings often need vectorization for accuracy.

# How Raster to Vector Conversion Works

1. **Image Analysis:** The original raster image is assessed for clarity and detail.
2. **Manual or Automated Tracing:**
   * *Manual conversion* (done by designers) ensures higher accuracy for complex designs.
   * *Automated tools* can quickly vectorize simple images but may lack precision.
3. **Clean-Up Process:** Irrelevant details, background noise, and rough edges are removed.
4. **Final Output:** The design is saved in vector formats like AI, EPS, or SVG for professional use.

# Raster vs. Vector: A Simple Example

Imagine you have a logo in JPG format. It looks fine on your website, but when you print it on a banner, it turns blurry and unprofessional. After Raster to Vector Conversion, that same logo can be scaled to fit an entire wall without losing sharpness.

That’s the difference—a raster logo limits your possibilities, while a vector logo opens endless opportunities.

# Benefits of Choosing Professional Conversion Services

While free online tools exist, they often produce rough, inaccurate results. Professional Raster to Vector Conversion services provide:

* **Attention to Detail:** Clean edges and precise color matching.
* **Editable Files:** Giving you flexibility for future design changes.
* **Fast Turnaround:** Essential for businesses working on tight deadlines.
* **Industry Expertise:** Skilled designers understand how to prepare files for embroidery, printing, or signage.

# Common Uses of Raster to Vector Conversion

* Converting old scanned logos into modern, print-ready versions.
* Preparing artwork for embroidery digitizing.
* Re-creating low-resolution clipart into sharp graphics.
* Transforming hand-drawn sketches into digital vector art.
* Preserving historical or vintage artwork in a scalable format.

# Real-World Example

A small coffee shop wanted to print custom mugs and t-shirts with its logo. The only file they had was a low-resolution JPG pulled from their old website. When they tried to print it, the image came out blurry. After Raster to Vector Conversion, their logo became sharp, editable, and scalable—ready for embroidery on aprons, printing on mugs, and large signage outside their café.

# Tips for Best Results in Raster to Vector Conversion

1. **Start with the Best Available Image:** The higher the quality of your raster file, the better the vector result.
2. **Choose Professionals Over Auto-Tools:** For complex designs, manual conversion gives the cleanest output.
3. **Specify the End Use:** Whether it’s for embroidery, printing, or signage, inform the service provider so they can optimize the file.
4. **Save in Multiple Formats:** Having AI, EPS, and SVG versions ensures flexibility for different applications.

# Conclusion

In the world of design, presentation matters. A pixelated, blurry logo sends the wrong message, while a sharp, professional graphic builds trust and credibility. [Raster to Vector Conversion ](https://www.digitizingusa.com/vector-services)is the bridge that transforms outdated, low-resolution images into high-quality, scalable artwork that works across industries.

Whether you’re a small business owner, fashion brand, or marketing professional, investing in vector files ensures your designs always look their best—no matter the size, surface, or medium.

So, next time you come across a blurry image holding back your brand, remember: Raster to Vector Conversion is the key to unlocking crisp, professional, and versatile designs.",1,1756281055.0,MachineEmbroidery,0,1.0,False

I am absolutely loving it for milk-based drinks. It has definitely earned a spot on my new favourites list. Unfortunately, the sample pack only had 50g, so between carefully dialing in and tasting, I managed to finish it all too quickly.

The cup hits a beautiful balance of chocolaty, nutty, and fruit-punch notes. If you enjoy light-roast espressos but dislike when fermentation pushes the fruitiness too far, this one sits right in the sweet spot.

I didn't know what to think about that church. I didn't know how to feel about what I had seen. Did the pastor really have a gift from God? The only thing I know is that those people were really floating in thin air. The couple that came back from being “blessed” were younger too. That wasn't made up either. I had to go back.

The whole next week felt unimportant. Work was boring. Home life was boring. I wanted it to be Sunday morning everyday that I woke up. Unfortunately for me, the days moved at an abnormally slow pace. I had hoped the excitement would make the time fly, but it didn't. It felt as though that week took a month. That was until Saturday night. I decided to go to bed early that night. I wanted to be awake for the sermon. I also didn't want to be hungry like last week. I was worried my excitement would keep me awake all night. My head hit the pillow and before I knew it, it was morning.

I was ecstatic. I jumped out of bed. Church didn't start for an hour so I had plenty of time to make a small breakfast. After that, I decided to wear something nicer than some second hand slacks and a sweater. I dug through my wardrobe to find my nicest button up shirt that I would wear for job interviews. The shirt was thick, white, and fit me well. I found a gray cardigan that I stole from my friend a few years back. All that remained was the pants. I didn't have much in the way of fancy pants. I decided to wear the same khakis I wore when I worked retail. They were a part of my uniform and I never considered them nice. However when you toss the pieces together, I looked rather presentable. I inspected myself in the mirror for multiple minutes before I convinced myself that I didn't look ridiculous. I hardly dressed up and it was odd seeing myself try.

The morning was cold that day. No rain, thankfully, but still cold. The dew on the ground was thick. Looking around my neighborhood, there was a slight fog. I shivered, glad that I wore the cardigan. I sat in my driver's seat and cranked the engine. My frigid leather seats were very good at cooling me down even further. The heater in my car could not heat up fast enough. I was shivering and losing the dexterity in my fingers. I had to drive about halfway to the church before the temperature in the car was comfortable.

The parking lot was just as packed as last week, but I didn't have to worry about the grass being mush this time. The dirt was as solid as a rock. I hopped out of my old vehicle and felt the morning dew seep through my shoes. It was frightening how fast the water got to me. I jogged to the church doors hoping that it might warm me up a bit as well as get me inside sooner. The door of the church was heavy, but once inside I could feel the wonderful sensation of heat wrapping itself around me once again.

I decided to skip the coffee today. Not only did I not need it, I also didn't want to pay for it this time. However, I waved to the barista. She didn't seem to notice, but I wasn't too concerned about it. I walked to the same section I sat in last week. The former octogenarians were sitting near me again. I decided to ask them about the “miracles.”

“So are the miracles always the same?”
I asked a little more intrusive than intended.

The man replied politely.
“Oh, no. We never really know what's going to happen.“

His wife added, excitedly.
“Yeah, we got lucky”

I quickly replied.
“Wait what do you mea-”

Before I could finish my thought, Zacharious’ voice boomed from the speaker. He sounded excited. He came out in the same checkered suit as last week. He wore a big smile showing his perfect teeth. He had wrinkles on his face from smiling so much. I could have sworn he looked at me and winked. He captivated his congregation.

“Hello hello hello. Welcome to Saint John's. I hope we're all having a good morning. I know the Lord is looking down and guess what people. He is happy. Why? Because we are here to worship him. Shall we sing to our Lord.”

I noticed he didn't mention anything about miracles. Everyone rose and grabbed a hymn book. We sang and sat down. No rushing of the stage. No floating church members. I felt so let down. Feeling let down made me feel guilty. I was here to worship, not to watch the pastor do magic. I was lost in thought. That was until I heard him say something.

“Alrighty folks, as you may know we have a new member in need of baptizing.”

I panicked because I wasn't ready for this. I was relieved to see someone else join the pastor on stage. He was wearing an all white jumpsuit. 

“He says he swears his body and soul to our Lord. But this will be no ordinary baptism. This will be a test of faith. Now, many people know the story in the book of Daniel. The men did not burn in the furnace because why? Their faith in the Lord. They had faith that they would be protected. Dipping yourself in water doesn't prove you trust your Lord and flame can cleanse better than any amount of holy water.”

With that a bed of flames emerged from a grate in the stage. No one was startled besides me and the man in white. I could see his face contort into terror. I could tell he was not involved in the planning. He clearly had no idea this was going to happen. He gave a nervous laugh to try and break the tension. It didn’t work. The pastor beckoned him to the flames.

“Do you trust the Lord to protect you son?”

He looked at the flames in terror, but threw himself closer and closer to the fire. Step by step. The flames nipped at him causing him to wince in pain. He jumped back out of instinct. The pastor looked disappointed in the man. 

“Sonny, you have to believe in the Lord to save you or else you won't get into the kingdom of heaven.” 

The man in white shook his head in an attempt to shake his doubts. He looked at the fire with determination. He got into a starting stance. Then, he ran. He ran ,and jumped, right into the flames. For a second he held off the screams, but only for a second. He started his shouting soft at first, but it soon gave way to blood curdling screams of pure agony. He shouted and begged for someone to help him to put out the flames. Zacharious looked at the man in contempt. The disgust was then verbalized.

“Well if you had truly believed  in the gospel, you would have been fine.”

The man was still burning. He was now rolling around on the floor of the stage, but the flames wouldn't die out. He left behind trails of blood and black soot that stained the stage. The flames roared on. They kept burning him as if he were doused in gasoline. The man reached his hand towards Zacharious, but the pastor just walked away with his head hung low. The man in white screamed even harder. I bet he'd be crying if his tear ducts hadn't been signed into burnt flesh. 

I found it hard to look away. I was repulsed by the sight, but it was so captivating. No one in the room got up to help the man. Especially not the pastor. Was this really happening? I sat with my jaw open, just watching. I saw a man burn alive and no one did a thing. Am I to blame for his death? Then the pastor walked into the flames. I was shocked at first, but to my surprise he did not ignite. It's as if the flames were ignoring him.

“See people? It's not hard to trust God. He protects me the same way he protects each of you.”

Behind him, the man in white was no longer moving. He ceased rolling around and he ceased screaming. He had died right there on stage behind the pastor. The pastor stood in the flames for many moments seemingly unphased by the heat. He just kept preaching.  Eventually, the flames turned off and he did the rest of the sermon. After the sermon, people got up, conversated for a bit, and went home. It was a normal day for them. By this time, the body on stage was no longer ablaze. 

I didn't know how to react. I was afraid that Zacharious would want to see me, but he walked behind the stage curtain without another word. I was slightly relieved. I was  ready to leave. This whole ordeal made me very nauseous. I was uncomfortable with the people that attended this church. I felt sick to my stomach. I walked outside of the stuffy church to get some fresh air. I was bent over a railing regretting my decision to have breakfast. I thought to myself. 

“Next week I won't eat before coming.”

Would deeply appreciate any full system recommendations. 🙏🏽,"Hi r/ubiquity. I’m Opening a small study lounge for local students on a small(ish) town. I’d never heard of ubiquity before, but it was recommended, I looked into them, and I love everything I’ve read about it so far.  

I’ve decided to use Ubiquiti gear but I’m not 100% sure what kind of system would be best for this type of space, and search returned results that are year or more old. 

Details:

The lounge is about 800 sq ft (roughly 20x100), with students coming in to study, work, or whatever else. I’d like the joint to be known for its solid connection and reliability across the whole room and have features that support time limits, speed throttles, and block lists, ideally with the ability to configure those per user. A high schooler caught downloading a car might get put on time out, for instance. 

There’s also a small counter in the back where people might order drinks and basic school supplies, but I’m keeping all transactional and business stuff hardwired. That being said, The camera footage I’ve seen in this sub has convinced me to include a wireless security camera system. 5 cameras to be exact: Street, door Entrance, register, exit, and a super wide view of the whole hall. Less for shoplifting students than for documentation of potential liabilities like fights, bad actors, etc. 

Knowing all that:
	•	What gear/setup would you recommend?
	•	Any must-haves (controllers, AP models, switches, etc.)?
	•	Any mistakes I should avoid when designing the network?

Also, if any of you is ever in Hilo, Hawaii hit me up. I’ll pour you a coffee.

Thank you in advance r/Ubiquity 🙏🏽

As naive as it may sound to search for love here, I genuinely believe in destiny. If two people are meant to cross paths, they eventually will. Maybe this is just one of those paths.

A little about me: I enjoy simple things—catching a good movie, going for a walk or bike ride, vibing to some retro 90s music (though my playlist isn’t stuck there forever), and spending time with pets 🐾. My weekdays are pretty structured with a 9-to-5 job because I strongly believe work-life balance keeps your mind and health in place. Weekends are my time to unwind. I love reading and talking about life, irony, human emotions, and honestly, the mystery of this universe. I take hill station trips once a year to reset, I’m almost apolitical, Hindu by identity (but neither strictly religious nor atheist), and I drink/smoke socially.

What I’m looking for? Someone I can share both silly and significant moments with—sending each other lame selfies, making each other laugh on lame jokes, maybe even waking up on lazy Sunday mornings to share a virtual coffee. Someone who can talk career dreams, life struggles, or just nonsense when needed. Ultimately, yes, I hope for something long-term, but I’d like to take it one step at a time.

""Elías, baby, did you hit your head during your last race? Check the deed, genius.""  
  
  
""This penthouse is my pre-marital asset. Daddy bought it for me before our wedding. Your family doesn't own jack shit here.""  
  
  
His face went blank. Clearly, nobody had mentioned this little detail to the golden boy.  
  
  
Behind him, Clara leaned against the doorframe like some Victorian ghost, pale as porcelain with just the right amount of wounded fragility.  
  
  
""Elías, let's just go,"" she whispered, voice barely audible. ""I don't want to upset... Noah... any more than we already have.""  
  
  
She tugged at his sleeve with trembling fingers.  
  
  
Oscar-worthy performance, truly.  
  
  
Elías looked at her like she was made of spun glass, his eyes practically dripping with devotion.  
  
  
He whipped back to face me, absolutely seething.  
  
  
""This isn't over, Noah! You'll pay for what you've done!""  
  
  
""I'll make sure you never work in this industry again!""  
  
  
I stood up, walked right up to them both, and smiled sweetly.  
  
  
""Bring it on, champion.""  
  
  
""I'll be waiting.""  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
  
I looked past Elías straight at Clara, my voice cutting like glass.  
  
  
""Next time you want to stage a suicide attempt, Clara, maybe get actual medical records to back up your little performance.""  
  
  
""Because faking hospital documents for sympathy? That's some amateur-hour bullshit that'll get you laughed out of Hollywood.""  
  
  
Clara's whole body went rigid, her already pale face turning ghost-white.  
  
  
Elías immediately stepped in front of her like some knight in shining armor.  
  
  
""SHUT UP, Noah! I won't let you hurt her anymore!""  
  
  
I watched his pathetic protective display and nearly burst out laughing.  
  
  
""Hurt her?"" I smirked. ""Baby, you're the one hurting her.""  
  
  
""You gave her false hope. Made her think she could step on me to get what she wants.""  
  
  
""Elías, you're the root of this whole fucking tragedy.""  
  
  
The Castro blacklist hit like a nuclear bomb.  
  
  
Every shoot canceled. Every contract terminated. My entire team dissolved overnight—only Lucia stuck around.  
  
  
The internet became a cesspool of death threats and harassment.  
  
  
Clara's psychotic fans doxxed my address, spray-painted ""MURDERER"" on my penthouse door, mailed me packages filled with dead roses and razor blades with love notes.  
  
  
Lucia called building security and the police, but these nutjobs kept coming like rabid zombies.  
  
  
Meanwhile, Elías and Clara were living their best lives.  
  
  
They showed up together at some charity gala, looking like the perfect tragic couple. Elías gazed at her on camera like she was made of diamonds.  
  
  
""I'll handle my personal matters soon and give Clara the commitment she deserves.""  
  
  
The internet exploded with hearts and crying emojis, celebrating their ""epic love story.""  
  
  
And me? I became the evil ex-wife standing in the way of true love.  
  
  
Mrs. Castro called again, her voice dripping with smug satisfaction.  
  
  
""Having second thoughts yet, Noah? I warned you—you're out of your league.""  
  
  
""Here's your last chance. Get on your knees and beg.""  
  
  
""Write a public confession taking full responsibility. Admit you were jealous of Clara and made everything up.""  
  
  
""Do that, and I might let you crawl back to whatever trailer park you came from.""  
  
  
I listened to her delusional rambling and almost felt sorry for her.  
  
  
""Mrs. Castro, I think you forgot something important.""  
  
  
""My last name is Hildago.""  
  
  
My father is Diego Hildago—majority shareholder of Banco Solaris, founded in 1857 in Santander, Spain. One of Europe's largest banks, top ten globally for assets, with major operations across Europe, Latin America, the UK, and significant power here in the US.  
  
  
My mother is Isabella Montenegro-Hildago, one of Europe's most celebrated contemporary oil painters. Her work hangs in the Louvre, MOMA, the Prado. Critics call her the ""Mistress of Light and Shadow.""  
  
  
I never needed the Castros for anything. Ever.  
  
  
I'd been playing nice, trying to keep things civil for everyone's sake. But apparently, they didn't want civil.  
  
  
Mrs. Castro's voice turned arctic.  
  
  
""So you're going to be stubborn to the bitter end.""  
  
  
""Perfect. I love breaking stubborn little bitches.""  
  
  
""Noah Hildago, I'll show you what real despair looks like.""  
  
  
She hung up.  
  
  
Five minutes later, my phone rang. Dad.  
  
  
The moment I heard his warm, familiar voice, my entire badass facade cracked.  
  
  
""Mija,"" he said softly. ""I've been watching the news.""  
  
  
My throat tightened. Suddenly I wasn't Noah Hildago, ice queen of the modeling world. I was just Daddy's little girl who'd gotten hurt.  
  
  
""Papá..."" My voice came out smaller than I intended.  
  
  
""You don't have to be strong right now, mi amor. Not with me.""  
  
  
The tears I'd been holding back for days finally spilled over.  
  
  
""They're trying to destroy me, Papá. They think... they think I'm nobody.""  
  
  
""Ay, mija."" His voice carried that protective edge that meant someone was about to get very, very sorry. ""Let Papá handle this.""  
  
  
""Whatever you need to do, daddy's got your back. No limits.""  
  
  
I wiped my eyes, feeling the steel return to my spine.  
  
  
""I'm okay, Dad. Really.""  
  
  
After we hung up, I scrolled through my contacts and dialed a very specific number.  
  
  
""Interested in making a deal?""  
  
  
A low, amused chuckle came through the line.  
  
  
""An invitation from Noah Hildago? I'm all ears.""  
  
  
""Tell me, sweetheart—how do you want to play this?""

1n1abi3,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/1n1abi3/how_do_you_explain_this_behavior/,How do you explain this behavior?,"I (47m) a little neurospicy and this is my first OLD match (39f)

Keep in mind this is Facebook dating which has the lamest chat. You can’t tell the other person is typing, has read anything and you don’t get an alert for 2-20min. 

Fri - morning we match. She is super easy to talk to and I’m actually excited to talk to her. Afternoon we’re eyeballing LTR dealbreakers. Evening I can’t wait and ask her out for a coffee date. She says yes. I suggest time (Saturday) and ask her to pick the location she feels most comfortable. 

Sat
around noon I message her that if she doesn’t get back to me soon Saturday is a no go. Later that night she messages me, apologizing she had something come up and didn’t check on FBD. She’s busy sun so that’s not good. 

Sun
she messages me with a phone number. Asks me to text her there so she can get alerts. 

I text her and no response. after a while I post back in FBD that I texted her. I wasn’t sure if she got it or not. 

In FBD she says no. She didn’t get an alert. After a while I give her my # (what I texted her with) and asked her to text me. 

This works and she sends me picks, asks for pics and I send her some and we rapidly type back and forth complimenting each other and joking about future plans

She asks if I want to go out after work m/t/w. I say Tue and suggest a time. We keep talking (no she hadn’t confirmed). 

It takes me a minute to get some pics together and it appears she’s off the text thread. I send her my pic, confirm the time again. 

Mon
nothing from her. I message her again towards the evening asking to confirm the date. 

At this point I feel weird. I don’t want to pester her with 12 messages while she’s out. She doesn’t owe me responses in a speedy time.

Tue
day of the proposed second date attempt. Nothing at all. 

If she returns to the chat,,there is already too many messages stacked up there. 

My feelings
1. Having matched less than a week ago, I don’t know that someone being busy with life is out of the question. I’ve no right to expect to be any priority. 
2. Having accepted a date and proposed a date, I would expect follow through, even if it was to jump in and say she can’t do it. 
3. I do really like our chemistry when we chat. This is why I was excited to meet and see if that spark was real in person. I’m terrified of meeting new people and things being awkward, I had no fear only excitement. 
4. While I acknowledge I’ve no right to expect/demand attention as a random match, this sort of communication wouldn’t be acceptable from a gf. If I’m thinking about her so much, has she not thought about me for two days? If so, wouldn’t she check on our convo?
5. If she messaged me again I’d need to confront her on this style of communication and ask how she feels. 

So my head is spinning, I feel disrespected that she’s blowing off potential unconfirmed dates. But I also wonder if I’m being “too much”. Am I being needy? 

Every time I look at FBD I see our match and I want to ping her again, which feels sad. Like if she forgot all about me it must not mean much to her. 

Part of me wants to set a boundary in communication with me. Acknowledge her breezing by suggested dates and this hot/cold communication. Let her know I’m not angry and that I like her and would be interested in hearing from her she has more time/bandwidth for this to be a thing. 

As of two days ago I may have been ghosted. How long until you call in a ghosting?

I know she’s a cute girl and 100% possible she’s got 3 other better options sniffing around drawing her attention. Also possible she’s overwhelmed by something big. I don’t know her that well and what is normal. 

The only fact I am sure of is that this is hitting me so hard bc this is the first time I’ve clicked with anyone in 20 years. I know my feelings are disproportionate to the short time we’ve messaged. 

This might be a sign I need to toughen up and not get invested so soon. 

Sorry this is long and rambling.

Most of the time, we just don’t have the right strategies in place. I recently came across a breakdown of 9 practical saving tips that really stood out because they’re simple, science-backed, and easy to apply in daily life. Thought I’d share them here for the community:

**The Pineapple Pizza Rule**

Reframe your spending in terms of something you love. For example, if a candle costs $70 and your favorite pizza costs $7, ask yourself: “Do I want this candle, or 10 pizzas?” It makes spending decisions a lot clearer.

**The Absolute Price Rule**

Don’t just look at the sticker price—look at cost per use. A $500 espresso machine used daily can be cheaper in the long run than buying coffee every day.

**Savings Challenges**

Join or create savings challenges. Accountability and structure can rewire habits. People save more when they have a clear road map and community support.

**The 0–3–6 Rule**

Instead of blindly saving “3–6 months of expenses,” adjust it based on your life.

* Start with 3 months as a baseline.
* Add up to 3 more months if you have dependents.
* Add up to 3 more months if your job/industry is unstable or you lack multiple income streams.

**The Wealth Triangle Rule**

A quick way to see where you stand:

* Multiply your age × annual pre-tax income ÷ 10.
* Compare it with your net worth. If you’re at half or less → Under Accumulator of Wealth. If you’re on target → Average Accumulator. If you’re double or more → Prodigious Accumulator. It’s not to shame you, but to give you a target.

**401(k) Match Rule (or Local Equivalent)**

If your employer offers a retirement match, always contribute enough to get the full match. It’s free money that too many people leave on the table.

**The 20/4/10 Car Rule**

* Put 20% down.
* Finance no longer than 4 years.
* Keep car expenses under 10% of gross income. This keeps your car from becoming a wealth killer.

**Price vs. Value**

Don’t just chase the cheapest option. Spend more on things that truly bring value and joy, while cutting ruthlessly on things that don’t.

**The Separation Rule**

Create a separate email just for store promotions/ads. This way, you avoid daily temptations but can still access deals on your terms when you actually plan to shop.

Saving money isn’t about depriving yourself, it’s about making smarter choices, reframing spending, and setting systems that work for you. Even adopting a couple of these can add up to thousands saved over time.",1,1756278733.0,PersonalFinanceTalks,0,1.0,False

# Conclusion

After months of late nights and way too much coffee, I’m genuinely excited to finally share this with the community.  

I built **Pwnagotchi Companion** because I wanted a native iOS experience that felt reliable and smooth, and I’m really looking forward to hearing what others think. Whether it’s feature requests, bug reports, or just thoughts on the approach — all feedback is welcome.  

Thanks for checking it out, and I hope it makes your Pwnagotchi just a little more fun (and a lot easier) to work with.

Chapter 1.

""Ma'am, seen the whole collection now? Nothing catches your eye?""

""Ma'am?""

Rosalind Johansen blinked, pulled from her thoughts.

Her finger landed at random on a diamond necklace.""This one. Wrap it up.""

Relief washed over the clerk's face.""Right away.""

A wave of satisfaction rippled through the boutique staff.

Rosalind's daily visits for three months were legendary.

""Ms. Johansen,"" one associate ventured, envy clear in her voice,""your husband must cherish you! Treating jewels like everyday trinkets... Incredible.""

""They're right,"" another added.""Follow the money, find the love. A man spending like that? He's utterly devoted.""

""Rich and a hopeless romantic. Life truly favors you, Ms. Johansen...""

Rosalind offered a thin, distant smile at the flattery.

Her attention stayed fixed on the associate across the room, the one quietly packaging her purchase, not jostling for favor.

Her hands were particularly striking, delicate, pale, and graceful.

Rosalind felt a flicker of self—disgust, like some kind of stalker.

She needed to see up close the woman who'd shattered her husband's famed self—control.

What magic did this ordinary shop girl possess to make her husband discard their fifteen years together, trample every sacred vow, and choose her?

The associate's name was Latoya Middleton. Her face wasn't classically beautiful, just pleasant.

But those hands were exquisite, delicate, and perfectly formed. Even a woman could appreciate them. It was no wonder a man would be captivated.

As Rosalind was leaving, she asked,""Could you do me a favor?""

As a top—tier VIP client, the answer was always yes.

She slid the ring off her ring finger and handed it to the associate.""Melt this down for me, please.""

The associate looked shocked.""But ... this is your wedding ring? And ... it looks like there's an inscription?""

There was indeed an inscription: CF and RJ, the initials of Christopher Foret and Rosalind Johansen.

Christopher had engraved it himself.

The associate double—checked,""Ms. Johansen, this ring must hold such significance. Are you sure you want it melted?""

""Yes,"" Rosalind stated firmly.""Please do it as soon as possible.""

...

Rosalind arrived home as evening fell.

She had barely stepped through the front door when Christopher barreled out, nearly knocking her over.

She stumbled back several steps, almost losing her balance.

Luckily, a strong hand shot out and caught her around the waist, preventing the fall.

Christopher frowned, a light sheen of sweat on his brow.""Where were you? Why are you only getting home now?""

""Yes, Mrs. Foret,"" chimed in Liza Lester, their housekeeper.""It's past seven. You should let Mr. Foret know if you'll be out late. He was ready to call the police...""

Standing slightly behind Christopher was his assistant, Joshua Pruitt.

Seeing her, Joshua visibly relaxed and spoke into his phone.""Sir, my apologies. Mrs. Foret is home now. Thank you for your time.""

Christopher leaned down slightly, quickly scanning her for any sign of harm.

Seeing she was unhurt, the tension in his face eased a fraction.""Your phone was off. I thought something had happened to you.""

He instinctively reached out to touch her cheek, then frowned again.""You're freezing.""

Rosalind pushed his hand away and moved past him into the house.""Just needed some air. Felt stifled in here. My phone died.""

Christopher caught up in two strides, shrugging off his suit jacket and draping it around her shoulders as he guided her inside.""The wind picks up at night. Don't catch a chill.""

Rosalind tried to pull away, but his arm held firm. She stopped resisting.

Once inside, Christopher started issuing orders.""Liza, make Rosa hot coffee to warm her up.""

Then he turned to Joshua.""Go to Blossom Eatery. Get her usual favorites. Tell them easy on the salt and sugar.""

""Right away, Mr. Foret.""

Soon, they were alone in the living room.

Christopher kept his arm firmly around her shoulders, a gesture both possessive and protective. His voice, however, was gentle.""I was a bit frantic earlier. I'm sorry if I sounded harsh, Rosa. Please don't be angry.""

Hope Bappa brings lots of positivity and good vibes (aur shayad kuch mast fragrances bhi 😅).

I recently got a haul of decants from u/Kratos304 and thought I’d share my experience. First off, seller experience was excellent, very quick to respond, guided me on a couple of picks I ended up liking, and kept me updated when the package was packed, picked up by courier, and finally out for delivery.

Ab seede mudde pe

Fragrance Impressions

1) Versace Man Eau Fraiche
Refreshing, citrusy, watery clean frag 🍋. Doesn’t last long (3–4 hrs), but feels classy and very easy to wear in the heat. One of my favorites here.

2) Rayhaan Lion
Hyped as a beast, but the drydown didn’t deliver. Loud opening, flat later. Expected lion, got more like a house cat 😭🐈. I'll give it another shot after letting it sit for 2 weeks.

3) Hawas Elixir
Fruity bubblegum opening, turns into a warmer, amber-woody frag. Strong projection, very compliment-friendly.

4) 9PM Rebel
Sweet, vanilla-heavy, with strong performance. A proper nightlife frag, but not really my style compared to the others.

5) Lattafa Khamrah Qawha
This one stole the show. Rich coffee + spices with a gourmand sweetness. Cozy, long-lasting, addictive. Perfect for winter evenings. ☕🔥

6) Rasasi Fattan
Clean, green, versatile on paper but on my skin it felt flat. Mujhe laga thoda room freshener jaisa.

7) Afnan Supremacy in Heaven
Sharp citrus opening, musky-woody drydown. Fresh niche-like vibe, but didn’t wow me.

8) Al Haramain Amber Oud Aqua Dubai
Sounds fancy, but fragrance itself felt ok ok. Just a safe aquatic. Might let it sit for a couple of weeks and see if it grows on me.

My Top 3 from this haul:
• Lattafa Khamrah Qawha.
• Hawas Elixir.
• Versace Man Eau Fraiche.
The rest were okay, but not FBW for me.

1n1a2ua,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n1a2ua,Daily commute fit check: jeans + tee + Panthère dupe,"Not every day is about suits and boardrooms. This morning I just threw on light jeans and a plain white tee for my commute. Simple, nothing fancy. But honestly, the Panthère bracelet-style dupe on the wrist instantly pulls the whole look together — casual but still polished.

What I like about this piece is the flexibility. The bracelet links move smoothly, so it doesn’t feel stiff when you’re typing at work or grabbing coffee on the go. The slim square case isn’t bulky, so it doesn’t scream “look at me,” but it still catches the light in a clean, classy way.

I’ve seen people say they only wear their nicer pieces on special occasions. Personally, I don’t see the point — life’s too short. This watch feels just as right at a coffee shop, on the subway, or even at a night out. The whole “refined but effortless” thing is why Panthère is such a classic design, even in dupe form.

Curious if anyone else here wears their “nicer” pieces with casual fits too? Or do you save them just for events?

It was a long but fruitful journey, especially while balancing my personal and professional life. I’d like to share the resources I used during my preparation:

**1. Mike Chapple LinkedIn Videos**  
Great to start with, especially for building foundational knowledge. However, they don’t cover everything required for CISSP. Still, they’re a good way to get familiar with core concepts.

**2. Destination Certificate (Book)**  
An amazing book with simple language and clear explanations. It was my primary resource throughout my preparation. While it doesn’t cover all topics, it’s a solid starting point. I’d rate it **9/10**.

**3. LearnZapp App**  
Some say it’s too technical and doesn’t reflect the actual exam style and they’re right. The exam’s wording was very different. However, it’s still valuable for strengthening technical concepts. I especially benefited from reading the explanations for both correct and incorrect answers. I’d rate it **8/10**.

**4. Prabh Nair’s Coffee Shots**  
Extremely helpful and to the point. In fact, I watched one on the morning of my exam, and a similar question appeared in the test! Highly recommended for clearing doubts quickly. **9/10**.

**5. Destination Cert Mindmaps**  
A fantastic visual resource. I watched the mindmaps for each domain after reading the respective chapters in the book. They helped me see how topics connect and reinforced my understanding. Not a replacement for a book, but a great compliment. **9/10**.

**6. Quantum Exam (QE)**  
These questions were brutal but in the best way possible. They closely resemble the real exam’s tricky, ambiguous style. They trained me to focus on keywords, analyze scenarios, and eliminate wrong answers logically. During the actual exam, I got maybe 3–4 straightforward questions; the rest required deep analysis, and QE prepared me perfectly for that. To be honest, I don’t think I could have cleared CISSP without Quantum Exam (QE). It truly prepared me for the real test. **10/10**.

**7. ChatGPT**  
This AI tool was a game-changer for me. I asked questions in my native language and received explanations like a friend teaching me with real-life examples. I also used it to clarify confusing topics, verify answers from question banks, and get alternative perspectives. Sometimes ChatGPT agreed with official answers, sometimes it explained why they were wrong and that critical thinking helped me a lot. **100/10**.

**Final Thoughts**  
There’s no single resource that will guarantee success in CISSP. You need a mix of books, practice tests, videos, and most importantly critical thinking which you can develop using QE.

If you’re preparing for CISSP, especially if you’re based in the Middle East, feel free to reach out. I’d be happy to share my experience and resources to help you on your journey.

It’s a question that might pop into your head as you sip on your morning brew.**

Coffee is a beloved ritual for millions, but have you ever stopped to think about how much caffeine you’re actually consuming? Understanding the caffeine content in your cup can help you make informed choices for your health and lifestyle. Whether you’re looking to boost your energy levels or moderate your intake, knowing the caffeine levels can guide you in the right direction.

Stick around to uncover the details and make your coffee experience even more enjoyable.

# Caffeine Content In Filter Coffee

Filter coffee is a favorite morning ritual for many. It offers a rich, aromatic flavor. But how much caffeine does it actually contain? Understanding the caffeine content can help coffee lovers manage their daily intake. Let’s delve into the specifics of caffeine in filter coffee.

# Caffeine Content In A Standard Cup

A standard cup of filter coffee contains about 95 mg of caffeine. The amount can vary depending on the coffee beans and brew time. Some cups might have more; others less. But 95 mg is a good average to start with.

Several factors influence caffeine levels in filter coffee. The type of coffee beans is crucial. Arabica beans generally have less caffeine than Robusta beans. Brewing time also plays a role. The longer the coffee brews, the more caffeine it extracts.

# Comparing With Other Coffee Types

Filter coffee has a moderate caffeine content. Espresso, for example, has more caffeine per ounce. But a cup of filter coffee has more caffeine overall. This is due to its larger serving size. Instant coffee usually has less caffeine than filter coffee.

# Health Considerations

Moderate caffeine intake can have health benefits. It can improve focus and alertness. But too much caffeine might lead to restlessness or anxiety. Knowing the caffeine content in your filter coffee can help you enjoy it responsibly.

She hasn’t spoken to me for the last 5 months and it’s killing me. 

In My dream I’m with her, she is taking me and showing me her new house , she is taking me around, we pass her husband and the kids but they are just doing normal things without really noticing me… 
Not invisible , but no real Acknowledging of me.  

It’s not like there is any resolution, but  I remember her taking me from room to room.  

I miss her so much. I love her so much. 
I still don’t understand why she has cut me out.  When I have txt her ( she won’t answer the phone to me ) she’s very spiteful, spewing hate about things  that I thought we had worked thru and resolved a long time ago. 

I nearly died earlier this year with acute kidney infection/turning into sepsis. And said some crazy out there things to everyone whilst I was in hospital  ( I lost a chunk of time , 7 days where I have no memory of anything ) and she hasn’t spoken to me since.  

Does my dream mean anything about resolving things with her.

Of course falling overboard, whether suicidal or foul play, seems the most likely, but there are multiple eyewitnesses that say they saw her with Yellow between 5:30 and 6PM. If it was just one person it would be easy to dismiss, but three? And then all the witnesses who saw her afterwards. I know there mistaken sightings all the time, but these sightings reported specific details that weren't released to the press. There is just too much evidence to ignore.

I also don't buy any of the drug theories. Yes....she did tell that Navy guy she owed money for drugs, but all her friends and family said she never took them. Maybe your family might not know you did drugs. But your college friends? If they said she didn't do it then she probably didn't do it. And even lets say she decided to start taking them - why do it on a cruise with your parents? Back when I was 23, I couldn't imagine doing such a thing.  

Like many in this group, I don't believe Yellow was a trafficker. I believe he was a scout. His goal was to get Amy  isolated, so he could get her off that ship. I don't think she planned to meet him. If she did she would have told Brad. My guess is that she left her room to get some coffee and take some photos. That's why she took her camera. On the way she ran into Yellow. He told her of a good spot to take photos - maybe it was even off the ship. I don't know if the ship was fully docked at this time and staff were disembarking. She didn't see it as a big deal. After all, she was just going to get a couple of pictures and then meet up her family in a few minutes. Yellow might have even told her family she would let them know. Once she was off that ship, she walked into the traffickers hands. ",0,1756277501.0,AmyLynnBradley,1,0.5,False

Everywhere I looked (YouTube, social media, even ChatGPT prompts), I only got **generic ideas** — stuff that’s been around for years. Nothing unique, nothing that could actually make me money or solve real problems.

So I built my own tool. Here’s what it does:

* Generate **unlimited personalized startup / business / SaaS ideas** (based on real-world problems)
*  Instantly **validate any idea** → demand, competition, profitability, market gap
*  Create & organize **AI-powered roadmaps** (edit + customize as you go)
*  Download full reports → saves hours of research & guesswork

Now, I’m testing it with **my first 100 early-access users** → unlimited use for **3 months for just $5** (literally the price of a coffee ).

Why I think this matters:

* A **good idea = foundation of everything** → without it, execution doesn’t matter.
* Most founders waste months chasing ideas that don’t work.
* Validating fast can literally save thousands of dollars + 1000s of wasted hours.

Would love honest feedback from this community:

* Is this something you’d actually pay $5 for?
* What features would make it 10x more useful?
* Anything that feels missing / unnecessary?

As a result of losing my job and what happened, I'm not able to return into a corporate environment again as its had a real mental toll on me. I wasn't at the bottom, but not the top either but had various direct reports, and people around me I cared about.

I decided that I wanted a career shift for both my mental and physical health and going to something more hands on, so I've started my own business that I'm optimistic about but it'll take 12-18 even 24 months to become steady I think, during this time I will have little to no income, but trying my absolute best to organise jobs and other items in the business to boost myself a bit. 

During this time, she's the sole income for the house, but its not forever and we have runway. I have offered to find casual work that I can try and add some extra cash into our flow if she wants.

Obviously the setup costs of a business is somewhat high, but not insane for what im doing ( no retail or commercial etc yet ). This means I am spending money investing into the business with cash from my payout etc but being reasonable and planned about it. 

This will also allow me to be present for my kids and perform daycare and school duties etc as my kids are bit of a handful for other non doxing reasons.

Now, my wife works as a shift worker ( and I know its rough and stressful etc ), She's tired all the time but also goes to bed late, spends time on social media doom scrolling and podcasts to late hours. I'm cooking meals for the family all the time, she doesn't cook. I do the house maintenance, laundry and as much as I can. I do school drop offs and go to bed 11pm, up at 6 daily. 

During these times, she's not willing to get up in the mornings and see the kids before school, if she's off work and around, she wont come and pick them up, she's laying on the couch all the time. 

What's driving me mad and emotionally hurting me is that if I ask small items like hey, can you get some clothes out for the kids, or can you get them breakfast whilst I run this task or errand, or even just get out of bed to see them in the morning its always an tired excuse. I think she's drained mentally, but doesn't listen to my advice about sleep patterns, disconnecting from media, doing some exercise or walks etc. 

My wife is really into investing our money which i support and we've done well, however the investment podcasts I feel are playing a role, as she's always listening and into media and her algorithm is money, money, money and I'm more about family time, being happy with a roof over our head, anything else is a perk. 

Since I have no income, I feel she's shorter with me, i dont get verbal responses, just a grunt if I ask her if she'd like a coffee or a tea in the morning, or what she'd like for dinner. 

We have arguments as I bring up things like kids starting school, or a birthday, and she's stating she wont take days off for the first day of school, or doesn't want a cake or even just a little home dinner with the kids and these comments are snarky and killing me inside. She just wants more investing and seems to have forgotten us it feels like. Meanwhile, I have the home load, the kids and barely get any help. 

I also have the burden of my mother in law living with us who's a drain financially, she's mentally unstable ( in a safe way ) and just clueless on life, cost of living and handling things, but she does help with direct tasks if ordered, ie get the kids today or make some rice. Her and her mother don't get on well, but her mother is still her mother. 

I've asked her to be more present for the kids, at least getting out of bed to see them and that resulted in her not talking to me for 2 days which I then raised more about that I can't have these days when im trying to hold a house together, cook, clean, kids, school and start a business. On top, I then get comments, when is this happening, have you done X task for the business yet, basically demands for things on stuff she doesn't understand like complexity of reporting, taxes etc and just wants to see $$$. 

I've asked her to be more present, just for the kids, ill keep doing everything else, but the part that she's not around for the kids when she could is killing me inside, I get she's tired but this feels wrong.

We've had some conversations, not yelling arguments but they don't seem resolved. Asking her to disconnect and get to bed at a reasonable time result in nothing.

On top of this, the kids are started asking more about why their mother isn't here, or ""is she at work again"" but even that from them doesn't seem to drive her to at least sit with them or say hello in the morning. 

I love my kids, she wanted kids badly, her mother also pushed for kids and here I am doing every single thing, and can't even get a small task like grabbing a jacket or finding a pair of socks in a morning rush done and then get comments about how I parent, like being strict about screen time, or dinner first before a treat, or sticking to a schedule which is important for the kids due to their nature. 

What next, she's not responding to my asks, advice for even small things.

tl;dr wife working all the time, I lost my job, but trying to start a new one, she's taking pot shots at me, wont take days off every now and then for important days for kids, generally negative sentiment which is destroying my mental health.",1,1756276684.0,marriageadvice,0,1.0,False

Turns out, there’s a reasson for this obsessive brain behavior! It’s the Zeigzrnik effect. Named after psychologist Bluma Zeigarnik, this little metal quirk means our brains remember incomplete tasks more vividly than the ones we’ve already done. Basically, our minds are nagging us about what we left hanging as a way to push us towards comoletion. Makes sense, right? Might be annoying, but I guess it’s like a brain nudge to ensure things don’t go forgotten.

So I met this girl on hinge and we really hit it off. She's funny and has a vibe I find super attractive. We made plans to meet up in person for coffee and it was great, we shared a lot about ourselves and I mentioned I have ADHD (keep this in mind because it comes up later).

So we make plans for a second real date. We saw Weapons because we're both into thrillers (it was kickass) and then had a light dinner with drinks before we went back to her apartments. So things look like they're going really well when all of the sudden she gets a phone call that she says is really important and has to take but should be over fast. So she goes to her bedroom and leaves me in the living room watching Netflix. Well something you should know about me is that because of my ADHD I get really bored fast and like to snoop. So I resisted for a really long time trying to wait it out but after about 5 minutes I start walking around snooping through her bookcases and photos. I noticed one picture in particular looked weird and so I started trying to open up the back to see if there was any part cutoff by the frame or if it had any secret note.

Well of course she comes out mid me plying her picture open and acts like I'm being a complete psycho for being curious. I told her I already told you I have ADHD and have to snoop around when bored but she was acting like I was a total freak. Needless to say it didn't end on good terms and I left.

It's been a day and I've been thinking about it. What should I do? I really like her and it was going great until the snooping, and I kinda feel like its her fault for answering the phone during the most exciting time of the date. How can I salvage this?",0,1756276455.0,Advice,9,0.25,False

Hey folks! I just wanted to talk about the whirlwind ride we’re all taking with ChatGPT lately. Honestly, is anyone else completely amazed at how quickly this tech is evolving? It almost feels like magic, but it’s real—and we get to see it unfold right before our eyes.

Let’s highlight some *amazing* ways ChatGPT is popping up in our daily lives:

- Homework helper when your brain’s out of steam
- Coding partner that doesn’t judge your silly mistakes
- Conversation buddy at 3AM (because sleep is overrated)
- Email writer, resume expert, note-summarizer—the list goes on!

Not gonna lie, I smile every time I watch developers (and even non-coders) referencing ChatGPT to solve problems in seconds that used to take hours. Suddenly, the barriers between imagination and creation have become lower. Sometimes I’ll literally sit back, coffee in hand, and ask ChatGPT the wildest questions just to see *what happens next.*

Imagine where this is going! If OpenAI keeps releasing upgrades at lightning speed, what will be possible in a year? Five years? Will we have personalized AI friends who *actually* remember our life stories? AI teammates for work that do the boring parts, so we can focus on creativity?

What absolutely delights me is that ChatGPT lets us:

- Explore new subjects fearlessly; there’s no “stupid question”
- Supercharge productivity, even when we’re in a lazy mood 😀
- Communicate across languages and cultures with less awkwardness

But beyond all that, it’s just FUN. Seriously, how many of us here have made silly poems, RPG adventures, or just weird fiction together with ChatGPT, laughing the whole time? No shame in saying my ASCII art skills have improved by leaps and bounds thanks to my tireless AI co-author.

Every day, something new drops—plugins, voice, vision, brilliant third-party apps. It’s like opening a surprise gift again and again. And the best part: you can *turn your wildest ideas into something real* for the first time ever.

Let’s swap stories! Tell me how you’ve used ChatGPT—whether it’s a wacky experiment, a productivity hack, or just a random funny chat when you were bored. What features are you wishing for next? Do you get that same electrifying sense of possibility every time you fire it up?

We’re the early adopters. Every day putting ChatGPT to work, we’re shaping what the future feels like. And honestly... I’ve never been more excited to see what happens next!

Picture 2: same plaques patches swelled and became a more noticeable histamine response, became larger across the board, no relief from topical steroid. Derm took biopsy from another plaque, prescribed oral steroid and .25% topical steroid. 

Picture 3: plaques and patches swelling went down after first day of treatment, itching has become manageable.

I work(ed) as a receptionist at a holiday park, and I was paid 31 AUD an hour (way above the min wage) My boss was kind of annoying, but earning over a grand a week was more than enough compensation for me to deal with her demanding I make her coffee or her leaving me to work alone.

Today, she caught me texting my friends on our work computer. My mess up, totally, and I tried to apologise, but as I did it’s like she just decided to unleash on me. She told me that I barely worked, that I was always making mistakes, that I answer the work phones too quick so that shows I’m not actually working (the work phone is at my desk, I can easily answer it and type at the same time, and always do?)

she sent me home early and told me to “think about my job” (after I managed to prove to her that I had actually been working all day). I ended up crying on the way out.

I really don’t want to lose my job, the money is amazing and the other people at the park are great, but I never want to see that woman again.",1,1756275850.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

I’m 25 and moving from Chicago to Salt Lake City soon for a new job. I’ve only ever lived in big cities, and I don’t know anyone in SLC, so I’m both excited and a little nervous about the transition. I’d really appreciate any advice from locals or people who’ve made a similar move!

1. **Neighborhoods** – Which areas are good for someone in their mid-20s? I’d love a neighborhood that’s social, walkable, and has things going on.
2. **Fitness** – I’m really into working out. Are there any great gyms or fitness communities you recommend?
3. **Food & Shopping** – Any must-try restaurants, coffee shops, or unique local stores?
4. **Meeting People** – What’s the best way to meet new people in SLC around my age? Any places I should go to or clubs, sports leagues, or social groups worth joining?
5. **Positives About SLC** – I’d love to hear what you personally love about living in Salt Lake City. Anything that might ease my nerves about this move would be amazing.

Thanks so much in advance for any insight!",0,1756275829.0,SaltLakeCity,1,0.33,False

We are all similar ages too, but I am older by a few years. Our job is in daycare. I've been working at the location longer than anyone else has, but it has never gotten this bad. All my coworkers do nowadays is sit on the table and go on their phones and talk to each other, while the children play in different areas. I am normally the one having to go to the area in the back to watch them, that's fine I guess, they have an eye on the children in the front.

However lately they've been ordering coffee, without asking if I want any. I am the only one in the shift that doesn't get asked if I want any. It just seems very rude to me?? Like yea, I'm in the back, but I can still see the coffee in the office... they openly leave it in the office where I can see it. They've done this before already too, I asked them once why I didn't get offered any, they didn't respond.

Guys, what am I doing wrong? I get that I'm not very social person, but isn't it still common curtesy to ask?? I understand it's just a workplace, but regardless my feelings got hurt, I don't want to go to work tomorrow.",3,1756275430.0,workplace_bullying,7,0.72,False
