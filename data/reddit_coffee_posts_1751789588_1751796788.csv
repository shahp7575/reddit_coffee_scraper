Over the past month, I built a project called SkipSchool, and surprisingly, it’s already bringing in about $200 a month — not life-changing, but hey, coffee money pays for itself. I figured I’d share how I did it because I know a lot of you are experimenting with AI tools too.



SkipSchool is basically an AI-powered homework solver designed to make getting answers stupidly fast and stress-free. Imagine ChatGPT, but tailored entirely for homework — no nonsense, no character limits, just straight-up solutions when you need them. I threw together the site using AI agents to accelerate development — honestly, I probably spent more time choosing the domain name than building the first version



After just 4 weeks, we’ve already got 20 paying customers on board, and I haven’t even started real marketing yet — it’s mostly word of mouth and random TikTok clips. The project’s been a fun way to test AI automation while making something people actually find useful. If you wanna see how it works or roast my website design, check it out: SkipSchool.LOL (Domain)

1lsxsb9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lsxsb9/i_attempted_a_kiss_and_it_ruined_everything_help/,I attempted a kiss and it ruined everything. Help me understand.,"I \[34M\] met this girl \[30F\] in a bike trip two weeks ago. Got along pretty well and honestly I felt some attraction towards her. Did not act on it, but was definitely interested in seeing her again.



The following week we went on a hiking trip that was unintentionally just the two of us. We spent pretty much the day together. She brought a bottle of wine that we drank at the top. It wasn't a date per se but a lot of things happened that I could interpret as she's being interested in me: I felt she was staying closer to me than normal at certain points in the trip, she complimented my lips (will spare the details but tbh best compliment I've ever heard, we laughed about it for 5 minutes straight), even told me ""I love you"" for a small thing I did which to be honest slightly weirded me out but I attributed it to alcohol. She gave me a small massage on our way back.



This whole trip had me fall for her to be honest. I woke up super early that night and all the details of that trip just kept replaying in my head over and over again. I really thought shecould be the one.



I invited her to a coffee for the afternoon of the following day and told her I kept thinking about last night and I would like to be more than friends. She was surprised, and wanted to clarify what exactly I was looking for, which is a serious relationship. She told me we don't really know each other for that, which is absolutely true, but I explained my intent with the time I want to spend with her moving forward is for building a relationship that ultimately goes there. She was receptive to this.



We kept texting from that day -- nothing remarkable other than two people interested in each other talking about their daily lives and making plans. I started feeling the usual love symptoms physically: loss of appetite, inability to sleep, butterflies in stomach, couldn't stop thinking about her... you name it.



Because of a recent issue she went through with another guy she explicitly avoided another man paying for her, you know, things like coffee and food. Spending time with her was a priority for me, instead of paying for things I opted to put my time into her: when she said her new work application was accepted, I prepared a dessert for her from scratch and we had it while watching the sunset to celebrate. It was a good time, but nothing physical happened -- not even holding hands.



On our way back I told her I want to take her out for a proper date which she accepted, but this did not materialize because she felt very sick that evening. I wasn't sure if she did it to avoid me at that instant but knowing her more, I'm sure she was really sick. We did not see each other that day.



Come July 4th. I cooked her a soup and brought it to her place. She liked the soup I think. Following that she prepared coffee and ice cream for us. I wasn't sure if she would recover enough to go out to see July 4 fireworks so I made other plans, but she straight up told me she does not want me to go and wants to spend the rest of the day together as we originally planned. I wholeheartedly obliged.



Since it was early, we went to a park that she hasn't seen before. We walked through it, and at its middle point I asked to hold her hand, which she agreed. From that point on we were virtually always holding hands. We went back to the car to get some food, and there she herself held my hand in her hand placed on her lap, not too close to her intimate area but close enough that I would definitely not dare putting my hand there on my own. I absolutely did not move from there even a single bit fearing she might get it as an inappropriate movement. I caught her a few times looking at me while I was driving, followed by smiles and laughs.



We had a pint of beer each and a pizza. The discussion between us became flirtier than usual, I could see her eyes lighting up. In hindsight maybe it was due alcohol, even it was a small amount.



From there we waited for more than an hour in a good spot to watch the fireworks, during which time we kept holding hands, she put her head against my shoulder, her leg against my leg, we hugged nicely, where she was caressing my lower back like she was exploring it -- I have a small benign growth there which she found out, played with it a bit in an attempt to figure what was that.



Fireworks ended and we looked to leave. Traffic was kind of a mess, so I took the initially-easy-way to get out from the crowd, fully knowing that it'll take more to get back. I told her that and she laughed, all the while my hand still being in both her hands, placed on her lap.



We arrived at her place. She insisted a lot to keep talking on phone on my drive back so I would stay awake. Me being absolutely in love, and the experience of the day, I decided to go in for a kiss. We hugged first like we usually do. I told her I'd like to see more fireworks, which I think she correctly understood it like me wanting to kiss. She avoided me first, and then I explicitly told her I wanted to kiss her to which she said she's not ready for this. I immediately stopped, hugged her a moment longer and separated. Honesetly, I saw her maybe 3-5 seconds more after that moment, she said goodbye in a soft and sweet voice which I replied in kind, and then we separated.



When I woke up, I texted her to see if she's feeling sick (it was breezy at the fireworks), to which she said no. I asked her out to breakfast, and she replied that she has to take care of herself, has chores to do, and so on, but offered to make a plan to spend a good chunk of Sunday together. The dialogue we had was a bit awkward -- it was generally full with smileys but not this time -- but I didn't think too much of it, as I was anxious virtually all the time I didn't see her and it was unwarranted so far. I was euphoric the whole day, I could not wait for tomorrow and asked her to meet in the evening for an hour -- just to take a small walk and chat a bit, I really wanted to see her.



I went to meet her and it all came crashing down. She said my kiss attempt overstepped her boundaries and asked me where did I got the idea from. I honestly could not explain myself at all on the spot, as I was mortified and absolutely shocked that this is how it was turning out. I pretty much just garbled words for about an hour. Honestly, I cannot remember a majority of the conversation other than the key points I said above. She was very upset with me. The whole discussion felt like an interrogation, she questioned how can a person can develop feelings this quickly.



I texted her after I got back, pretty much explaining everything I could not explain, and ended things. I knew there were some very important familial problems we'd have to solve and all of this gave me the idea that we won't be able to get past it given this situation. Not to mention from this point onward I would feel walking on eggshells all the time.



In all my honesty, if I knew she'd react like this, I would not do this in the slightest. I was ready for the next step, I thought she was too given the affection we had for each other during the day, which was obviously not the case but I can't understand why an attempt to kiss was such a big deal for her. I won't question at all why she wasn't ready -- every person is different, and this must simply be respected. But her take on this simply feels like an overreaction to me. Given what we went through the day, a kiss does not feel like a far fetched idea. I certainly did not try to force myself on her and immediately stopped when she said no. I would be happy to just let things stay where they are and don't escalate anything from that point on. Instead, we had a discussion which utterly felt like an interrogation, what I felt was questioned and dismissed, and what I've done was accused of having a sinister ulterior motive.

1lsxs1w,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1lsxs1w/severe_mental_fatigue_urge_to_lie_down_after/,"Severe mental fatigue & urge to lie down after sitting/standing - not POTS, no diagnosis for 3+ years","• Age: Early 26s  
• Sex: Male  
• Height: \~180 cm  
• Weight: \~65kg  
• Race: Caucasian  
• Duration: Over 3 years, daily and disabling after I quit lexapro(exitalopram)  
• Location of symptoms: Brain, full-body fatigue  
• Existing diagnoses: None confirmed; no heart, neuro, or endocrine disease  
• Current meds: (SSRIs-sertraline, lemotrigine, quetapine, phenibut, anxiolytics — no lasting effect)  
• Country: Georgia (limited access to autonomic labs/testing)

Summary of the main issue:  
For 3+ years, I’ve suffered from positional cognitive shutdown and a constant urge to lie down. Mental clarity rapidly degrades the longer I sit or stand. Relief comes almost instantly after lying flat, especially combined with deep breathing. No dizziness or fainting. No abnormal heart rate. All standard workups come back to normal.

I suspect Orthostatic Cerebral Hypoperfusion Syndrome (OCHOS) or Hypocapnic Cerebral Hypoperfusion (HYCH), but can't confirm without specialized testing.

Detailed symptoms:

* Mental fog & shutdown that worsens with upright posture
* Strong inner pressure to lie down, especially into sitting/standing
* No vertigo, no tachycardia, no fainting
* anxiety, low mood, lack of emotions. I'm stuck in blur state 
* mental fatigue, Cognitive slowing, sluggish reaction, weak focus
* Derealization-like blankness, emotionally flat
* Episodes of muscular tightness or urge to stretch after light exertion
* Normal oxygen levels, no tachycardia — so I don't qualify for a POTS diagnosis
* Breathing irregularities: frequent deep sighs, occasional need for forced breathing
* High irritability to noise/light, especially when tired
* Symptoms worsening after:
   * Meals
   * Smoking
   * Emotional overload
   * Mild physical activity (short walks or standing still)
* Relief from:
   * Lying flat
   * Deep breathing (briefly)
* Better in the morning after coffee and a cigarette, but worsens by early afternoon
* No diagnosis despite MRI, bloodwork, ECG, thyroid, iron, B12 — all normal
* Past different kind of medications (SSRIs, anxiolytics) didn’t solve it, only masked some symptoms temporarily

My ask:  
Has anyone dealt with this urge to lie down, with symptoms worsening upright despite no orthostatic tachycardia or hypotension?

If you've experienced similar, what helped you get a diagnosis or relief?  
Which non-invasive tests or measurements (e.g., CO₂ levels, CBF) should I push for or attempt myself?

Not asking for a diagnosis — just trying to find people who’ve dealt with the same pattern.

My parents still force me to go to church, though I’ve expressed several times I don’t want to anymore. My church places a large emphasis on “serving”, which is basically volunteering at the church, whether you’re doing coffee or looking after the kids. My parents really want me to start helping out with coffee at my local church, and this morning they started nagging me about it, ignoring me when I said no, I didn’t want to. 

I don’t have anything against the church, I just don’t want to help out with coffee duty because I’d rather spend as little time there as possible, plus I’m really shy and socially awkward. Besides, I just don’t want to. I don’t think everything needs a convoluted reason- I don’t really want to. 

But my parents kept nagging me this morning, with my mum trying to make a point with everything I said about how I should be volunteering at my church and it’s a good thing to do. She thinks that if I have time to go to events in my community like the Pride Party at my local youth club, then I have time to serve in church. She didn’t say it explicitly, but she implied I was being difficult and an asshole by saying no. Eventually my dad screamed at both of us to shut up because “you were really going at each other” (we weren’t.)

So— AITAH for not wanting to serve at my local church? I’m starting to feel guilty now and I don’t know if I should change my mind. ",1,1751796591.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

1lsxre3,https://youtu.be/FFjJapKd6v4,3 Very Scary TRUE Backcountry Hiking Horror Stories,"# ""Stillness Beneath the Cliff: A Hike I’ll Never Forget"":

I’ll never forget that day in Heart Creek, Alberta. It was early September, and my friend Alex and I had driven up from Calgary for a day hike, eager to escape the city’s hum for the wild beauty of the Rockies. Heart Creek was new to us, recommended by a coworker who raved about its turquoise waters and towering cliffs. We arrived at the trailhead just after dawn, our backpacks heavy with water, sandwiches, granola bars, and a small first-aid kit. The parking lot was nearly empty, just two other cars, their windows fogged with morning dew. The air smelled of pine and damp earth, and I felt a thrill of anticipation as we laced up our boots.

The trail began gently, weaving through a dense forest of pines and aspens. Their branches arched overhead, filtering light into golden patches on the ground. Squirrels darted across the path, and the distant call of a hawk echoed. Alex, always the talker, was in high spirits. “You should’ve seen the Yukon,” he said, adjusting his cap. “The Northern Lights were unreal. Dancing green ribbons, like something out of a sci-fi movie.”

I laughed, stepping over a root. “You’re making me jealous. I’m planning Banff next month. Maybe I’ll finally see those lights.”

“Better bring a good camera,” he teased, nudging me. We kept a steady pace, our boots crunching on gravel, the trail gradually climbing. My legs burned, but the fresh air and the rhythm of hiking kept me going. About two hours in, we reached a rocky outcrop overlooking the creek. The water below was stunning—bright turquoise, rushing over smooth stones, creating miniature waterfalls that sparkled. I pulled out my camera, snapping photos of the scene.

That’s when I noticed movement across the creek, on a sheer cliff face. Two climbers—a man and a woman—were scaling the rock, their bright red and yellow harnesses standing out against the gray stone. Their helmets glinted as they moved with practiced ease, ropes trailing behind them. The man was higher up, calling down to the woman, who nodded and adjusted her grip.

“Look at them,” I said, pointing. “That’s some serious skill.”

Alex shielded his eyes, squinting. “Yeah, that’s a tough route. Must be locals who know these cliffs. Bet they’ve done this a hundred times.”

We watched for a few minutes, impressed by their confidence. The man reached a ledge and signaled to the woman, who started climbing faster. Their voices carried faintly over the creek’s rush, cheerful and focused. “They’re making it look easy,” I said, pocketing my camera. “Come on, let’s find a spot for lunch.”

The trail dipped closer to the creek, and the sound of water grew louder, a constant roar that drowned out the forest’s quieter noises. We found a flat rock overhang, shaded by pines, and spread out a picnic blanket. As we ate our sandwiches, I kept glancing across the creek, wondering if the climbers had finished their descent. I didn’t see them, but the cliff was steep, and they could’ve been out of sight. Alex was halfway through a story about a bear he’d seen in the Yukon when I felt a prickle of unease, though I couldn’t place why.

“Let’s keep moving,” I suggested, packing up our trash. “There’s a path along the creek. Maybe we’ll see something cool.”

Alex nodded, brushing crumbs off his shirt. “Lead the way.”

We followed a narrow, unofficial path, hopping over rocks to cross shallow parts of the creek. The water was ice-cold, soaking my boots when I misjudged a step. I was about to complain when I froze, spotting something odd on the opposite bank. At first, I thought it was abandoned gear—a backpack or a tarp—but as we got closer, my chest tightened. Two figures lay sprawled on the rocks, their climbing ropes trailing into the water like lifeless snakes.

“Alex, do you see that?” I called, my voice sharper than I meant.

He hurried over, splashing through the creek. “What is it?” His eyes widened as he followed my gaze. “No… is that them?”

We crossed the creek, careful not to slip on the slick stones. My heart pounded as we approached. It was the climbers we’d seen—the man and the woman, still in their harnesses, ropes tangled and anchored to a bolt high on the cliff. They lay on their backs, eyes closed, faces pale as the rocks around them. The man’s arms were limp at his sides, one hand clutching a carabiner. The woman’s head was tilted slightly, her lips parted, as if she’d just exhaled and never breathed again.

I knelt beside the man, my hands trembling as I reached for his wrist. His skin was cold, like touching marble. No pulse. “They’re dead,” I whispered, my voice barely audible over the creek.

Alex stumbled back, his face drained of color. “No way. No way! We saw them climbing, what, two hours ago? They were fine! Laughing, moving like pros!”

I stood, my legs shaky, and scanned the scene. The ropes were still clipped to their harnesses, suggesting they’d been lowering when something went wrong. But there was no blood, no broken limbs, no sign of a violent fall. Their faces were serene, almost peaceful, which made my skin crawl. It was as if they’d just decided to lie down and stop living.

“What happened?” I muttered, my mind racing. “Did they fall? Hit their heads?”

Alex shook his head, his voice tight. “If they fell, there’d be marks, right? Bruises, something. This… this doesn’t look right.”

I fumbled for my phone, but the screen showed no bars. “No signal,” I said, frustration mixing with fear. “We need to get help. Back to the trailhead, now.”

Before we could move, footsteps crunched behind us. A man in his forties approached, wearing a dark jacket with an RCMP patch. He was with a family—two kids and a woman—but stepped forward alone. “What’s going on here?” he asked, his voice calm but authoritative.

I swallowed hard, pointing to the bodies. “We found these climbers. They’re… they’re not breathing.”

He introduced himself as an off-duty RCMP officer and knelt beside the woman, checking her pulse, then the man’s. His face stayed composed, but his jaw tightened. “They’re gone,” he confirmed. He pulled a radio from his belt and called for backup, his voice steady as he relayed our location. “Stay here,” he told us. “I need to know exactly what you saw.”

We explained how we’d seen the climbers scaling the cliff earlier, full of life. “They were so confident,” I said, my voice cracking. “The man was leading, and the woman was following. They reached the top, then we lost sight of them.”

The officer nodded, his eyes scanning the ropes. “Looks like a dual lowering maneuver,” he said. “It’s advanced—both climbers have to manage the rope tension perfectly. If one slips or misjudges, they can both go down.”

I shivered, picturing it. “But why do they look so… calm?” I asked, unable to shake the image of their serene faces. “Shouldn’t there be some sign of what happened?”

He hesitated, glancing at the bodies. “Sometimes, with a fall like that, it’s quick. Head trauma, internal injuries—you don’t always see it on the outside.” His words were meant to reassure, but they only deepened the chill in my bones.

As we waited for the rescue team, the silence was oppressive, broken only by the creek’s relentless rush. I couldn’t stop staring at the climbers. The woman’s helmet was slightly askew, revealing a strand of dark hair plastered to her forehead. The man’s hand still gripped the carabiner, his knuckles white. I wondered who they were, what their lives had been like. Had they been friends? A couple? The thought made my chest ache.

Alex paced nearby, muttering to himself. “This is messed up,” he said, running a hand through his hair. “We were just eating lunch, joking around, and now… this.”

I nodded, my throat tight. “I keep thinking, what if we’d stayed longer? Watched them descend? Could we have done something?”

“Don’t go there,” Alex said, but his voice wavered. “We didn’t know.”

When the rescue team arrived, they moved with quiet efficiency, their radios crackling as they set up a perimeter. They took photos, measured the ropes, and jotted notes. The officer spoke to them in low tones, then turned back to us. “The woman was likely less experienced,” he said. “Probably lowering the man when something went wrong. A moment’s distraction, a loose grip, and the rope slipped.”

I pictured it: the woman’s hands slipping, the man’s weight pulling her down, both plummeting to the rocks. My stomach churned. “How do you know it was her?” I asked.

He pointed to the rope setup. “The way the knots are tied, the angle of the anchor. She was likely the belayer. It happens sometimes—people overestimate their skills.”

We gave our statements, describing every detail we could remember. The officer thanked us and said we could go. The hike back to the trailhead was agonizingly slow. The forest, once vibrant, now felt oppressive, the shadows deeper, the air heavier. Alex was quiet, his usual chatter gone. I kept replaying the scene in my mind—the climbers’ still faces, the ropes trailing into the water. My hands wouldn’t stop shaking.

At the car, I sat in the passenger seat, staring out the window as Alex drove. “You okay?” he asked finally, his voice soft.

“No,” I admitted. “I don’t think I’ll ever forget this.”

He nodded, gripping the steering wheel. “Me neither.”

Weeks later, I read a brief article online. The climbers were a couple, avid adventurers. The woman’s family didn’t share much, and the official report listed “accidental death due to climbing mishap.” No further details. The lack of answers haunted me. What had gone wrong in those final moments? A slip, a distraction, a knot tied too loosely?

That day changed how I see the wilderness. It’s breathtaking, but it’s also merciless. One wrong move, one fleeting mistake, and it can take everything. I still hike, but I’m different now—checking my gear obsessively, listening for every sound, always aware that danger can lurk in the quietest corners. The memory of those climbers, lying so still by the creek, follows me like a shadow I can’t shake.





# ""The Last Trip We Took Together"":

My wife and I had been planning this trip for nearly a year. It was our fourth anniversary, and we wanted something special, something to mark the occasion with an adventure we’d talk about for years. Missinaibi Lake Provincial Park in Ontario was our choice—a vast, remote wilderness with glassy lakes, winding rivers, and forests so dense they seemed to swallow sound. We were no strangers to camping. She was a doctor, always steady in a crisis, and I’d spent my childhood hiking with my dad, learning to read maps and tie knots. We packed our kayaks, a lightweight tent, bear spray, and enough supplies for two weeks of freedom.

“This is going to be the best trip yet,” she said, her eyes sparkling as we stuffed the car with gear. She was folding our sleeping bags, her hands quick and precise. “No patients, no paperwork—just us and the wild.”

I grinned, tossing a cooler into the trunk. “No traffic, no deadlines. Just you, me, and a million stars.”

When we reached the park, the air was sharp with the scent of pine and damp earth. The lake stretched out before us, its surface so still it reflected the trees like a painting. At the ranger station, a man with a weathered face and a thick beard handed us a map. His voice was low, serious. “Bears have been active this season. Hang your food high, at least a hundred meters from your camp. Make noise on the trails, and keep that bear spray on you, not in your pack.”

“We’ve got it under control,” I said, trying to sound confident. I’d read about bear safety, and we’d camped in bear country before. But his words lingered, a quiet warning in the back of my mind.

We set up camp in a clearing by the lake, surrounded by towering cedars and spruce. Our tent was small but sturdy, and we strung our food bag high in a tree, just like the ranger said. The first few days were perfect. We kayaked down the river, our paddles slicing through the water, laughing as we raced each other. She’d splash me, her laugh echoing across the lake, and I’d pretend to be mad before splashing her back. At night, we’d build a fire, the flames crackling as we roasted marshmallows and talked about our dreams—maybe a cabin one day, or a trip to the Rockies.

But on the third day, something shifted. I woke up early, the forest too quiet, like it was holding its breath. As I boiled water for coffee, I noticed odd marks in the dirt near our tent—deep, uneven prints, too big for a fox or raccoon but not quite like the bear tracks I’d seen in books. I called her over, my stomach tightening.

“Look at these,” I said, pointing to the ground. “What do you make of them?”

She crouched beside me, her brow furrowing as she traced the marks with her finger. “They’re strange. Maybe a bear, but they’re not clear. Could be old.”

“Bears don’t usually come this close to camp,” I said, trying to convince myself as much as her. “We’ve been careful with our food, right?”

She nodded, but her eyes flicked to the trees. “Yeah, we’ve followed all the rules. Let’s just be extra loud today, okay?”

That day, we hiked a trail along the river, singing silly songs to scare off wildlife. She belted out an old folk tune, her voice bright, and I joined in, butchering the lyrics until we were both laughing so hard we had to stop. But even then, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was watching us. The forest felt too still, the shadows too deep.

That night, as we sat by the fire, she stared into the darkness beyond the glow. “Do you ever feel like we’re not alone out here?” she asked, her voice soft.

I forced a smile, poking the fire with a stick. “What, like a sneaky chipmunk spying on us? Don’t worry, I’ll fend off any rogue squirrels.”

She laughed, but it was short, and her eyes stayed on the trees. I reached for her hand, squeezing it. “We’re safe. We’ve got the spray, and I’m basically a wilderness warrior.”

She rolled her eyes, but her smile returned. “My hero,” she teased, leaning her head on my shoulder.

The next morning, I found more tracks—closer this time, circling the edge of our camp. They were fresher, the edges sharp in the dirt. My heart sank, but I didn’t tell her. I didn’t want to scare her. Instead, I suggested we stick to the lake that day, kayaking instead of hiking. We spent hours on the water, her paddle dipping in rhythm with mine, the sun glinting off the lake. For a while, I forgot the tracks, the unease, everything but her.

But that night, I heard it—a low, guttural sound, like a growl but deeper, coming from the trees. I sat up in the tent, my pulse racing, and grabbed the flashlight. The beam cut through the darkness, but I saw nothing.

“Did you hear that?” I whispered, shaking her gently.

She stirred, rubbing her eyes. “Hear what?”

“That noise. Like a growl. It was close.”

She sat up, listening, her face tense. After a moment, she shook her head. “I don’t hear anything. Maybe it was a dream?”

But I knew it wasn’t. I lay back down, my hand on the bear spray, my ears straining for any sound. The forest was silent, but it felt wrong, like it was waiting.

The fifth day, I checked the food bag. It was still high in the tree, untouched, but the rope looked frayed, like something had tugged at it. I tightened it, my hands shaking. When I got back to camp, she was packing our day bags, her movements quick.

“You okay?” I asked, noticing her frown.

She hesitated, then nodded. “Just… feeling a bit off. Like we’re being watched.”

I wanted to reassure her, but the words stuck in my throat. Instead, I said, “Let’s stay close to camp today. Maybe fish by the lake.”

She agreed, and we spent the day casting lines, catching a few small trout. She smiled as she reeled one in, but her eyes kept darting to the forest. That night, I double-checked the tent zippers, made sure the bear spray was within reach, and tried to act normal. We played cards by lantern light, her laughter easing my nerves, but I couldn’t shake the dread building in my chest.

On the sixth night, it happened. I was half-asleep when her scream shattered the silence. My eyes snapped open, and in the dim glow of the lantern, I saw it—a massive black bear, its fur matted and eyes wild with hunger, tearing through the tent’s fabric like paper. Its claws glinted, and its breath was a low, guttural snarl.

“Get back!” I yelled, scrambling for my knife. The blade was small, a pathetic defense against the beast’s size. It swiped at her, its claws ripping through her sleeping bag and into her side. Her scream was raw, piercing, and it broke something inside me.

I lunged, stabbing the bear’s shoulder with the knife, my hands shaking but desperate. “Leave her alone!” I shouted, stabbing again, the blade sinking into its flesh. The bear roared, turning on me, its paw slamming into my arm. Pain exploded, hot and sharp, blood soaking my sleeve. I didn’t stop. I kept stabbing, screaming, anything to make it back off.

She was crying, clutching her side, blood seeping through her fingers. “Help me,” she gasped, her voice weak.

The bear hesitated, maybe from the pain of my knife, and I seized the chance. I grabbed her, dragging her toward the back of the tent, tearing at the fabric to make an exit. The bear lumbered out the front, its heavy steps crunching in the dirt, but I knew it wasn’t gone. I could hear its low growls in the darkness.

“We’re getting out of here,” I said, my voice trembling. “Hold on, please, just hold on.”

Her breathing was shallow, her face pale as I lifted her, stumbling toward the lake. My arm throbbed, blood dripping down my fingers, but I didn’t care. I got her into the kayak, laying her across the seat, and pushed off into the water. The park office was ten kilometers away, a beacon of hope in my mind. I paddled, my muscles burning, my eyes locked on her still form.

The lake was dark, the water like ink under the stars. Then I heard it—splashing behind us. I turned, my heart in my throat, and saw the bear in the water, its massive head breaking the surface, eyes fixed on us. It was swimming, fast, its growls echoing across the lake.

“No, no, no,” I muttered, paddling harder. My arms screamed, my wounded arm barely working, but I couldn’t stop. “Stay with me,” I begged her, though she didn’t answer. Her chest barely moved.

The splashing grew louder, the bear closing the distance. I screamed into the night, “Help! Somebody, please!” My voice cracked, raw with panic.

Then, a miracle—lights on the shore, faint but real. “Over here!” a man’s voice called, followed by a woman’s. “Keep coming!”

I steered toward them, hope surging. The bear was close now, its breath hot and heavy in the air. As we reached the shore, two figures—a man and a woman—ran to the water’s edge, pulling the kayak in. The man knelt beside her, his hands moving quickly, checking her pulse.

“She’s hurt bad,” he said, his voice tight. “I’m a doctor. We need to get her to the office.”

The woman, an off-duty police officer, grabbed a flashlight, scanning the water. “That bear’s still out there,” she said. “We need to move, now.”

They helped me carry her to their truck, parked nearby. The doctor worked on her as we sped toward the ranger station, his hands steady but his face grim. I held her hand, whispering, “You’re going to be okay, please, just stay with me.”

But her hand was cold, her eyes closed. At the station, the rangers called for help, but it was too late. She was gone. The doctor put a hand on my shoulder, his voice soft. “I’m sorry. We did everything we could.”

I collapsed, sobbing, the world blurring around me. The rangers later tracked the bear, a starving male, and killed it. They said it had been stalking us for days, drawn by hunger. They gave me a medal for fighting it off, for trying to save her, but it felt hollow. Every night, I hear her screams, the bear’s growls, the splash of water as it chased us. I see her face, pale and still, and I wonder if I could have done more. The wilderness is beautiful, but it’s cruel, and it took the person I loved most.





# ""The Shadow on the Trail"":

I’d always wanted to hike the Appalachian Trail. The idea of leaving behind the city’s chaos—honking cars, crowded sidewalks—for the quiet of endless forests and winding paths felt like a dream. I spent months planning, packing my backpack with care: a lightweight tent, a water filter, a stove, and enough food for two weeks. My name is Laura, and I’m a solo hiker. This is the story of how my dream turned into a nightmare that still haunts me.

I started in Georgia, heading north. The first ten days were everything I’d imagined. The trail wound through dense woods, where sunlight dappled through tall pines and oaks. I crossed streams that gurgled over smooth stones, and at night, I’d sit by campfires with other hikers, swapping stories about blisters and breathtaking views. The trail felt like a community, a place where strangers became friends under the stars. But on the eleventh day, everything changed.

I reached a small campsite, just a clearing with a fire pit and a few logs for seats. As I set up my tent, I noticed a man sitting by the fire, strumming a battered guitar. His clothes were worn—faded flannel shirt, dirty cargo pants—and his beard was scruffy, like he hadn’t shaved in weeks. His eyes, sharp and unblinking, locked onto me as I worked.

“Hey there,” he said, his voice low, with a strange, almost mocking tone. “I’m Sovereign.”

“Hi, I’m Laura,” I said, keeping my voice polite but distant. I focused on hammering a tent stake into the ground, hoping he’d take the hint.

“You hiking alone?” he asked, his fingers pausing on the guitar strings.

“For now,” I replied, not looking up. I didn’t want to share too much with a stranger, especially one whose stare made my skin prickle.

“Trail’s no place for a woman by herself,” he said, leaning forward. “Lots of bad folks out here.”

I forced a smile, my stomach tightening. “I’m careful. Thanks for the concern.” I turned back to my tent, willing him to leave me alone. His gaze lingered, heavy and unsettling, until he finally picked up his guitar again and started humming a tune that sent chills down my spine. I told myself he was just odd, maybe lonely. But that night, as I lay in my tent, every rustle of leaves outside made me grip my pepper spray tighter.

The next morning, I packed up quickly and hit the trail early, hoping to put distance between me and Sovereign. The forest was dense, the path narrow and lined with ferns. I hiked fast, my boots crunching on gravel, my breath steady but my mind uneasy. Around noon, I stopped at a rocky overlook to eat a granola bar and check my map. That’s when I saw him again—Sovereign, sitting on a log about a hundred yards down the trail, sharpening a knife with slow, deliberate strokes. He looked up, his eyes meeting mine, and he smiled—a cold, knowing smile that made my heart skip.

I shoved my map into my pack and kept moving, faster now. Over the next two days, he kept appearing. Sometimes he was ahead, leaning against a tree, watching as I passed. Other times, I’d hear his footsteps behind me, just out of sight, the crunch of leaves too steady to be an animal. It felt like he was playing a game, keeping me on edge. I tried to tell myself it was coincidence—the trail was long but narrow in places, and hikers often crossed paths. But my gut screamed otherwise.

One afternoon, I stopped by a stream to refill my water bottle. The water was cold and clear, rushing over moss-covered rocks. I knelt by the bank, letting the sound of the stream calm my nerves. I was alone, or so I thought. Then Sovereign stepped out from the trees, silent as a shadow, and sat on a boulder just a few feet away.

“Hey, Laura,” he said, his voice smooth but laced with something dark.

I flinched, nearly dropping my bottle. “Hi,” I said, my throat tight. I focused on the water, avoiding his eyes.

“Been thinking about you,” he said, leaning closer. “You’re real pretty out here, all alone.”

“Thanks,” I muttered, screwing the cap on my bottle. My hands shook slightly. “I need to keep moving.”

He grabbed my wrist, his grip like iron. “Don’t rush off. Let’s talk.”

My heart pounded. I yanked my arm free, stumbling back. “I have to go.”

He laughed, a harsh, guttural sound that echoed in the quiet forest. “Suit yourself, Laura. I’ll see you soon.”

I turned and walked away as fast as I could without running, my pulse racing. His words replayed in my head, each one heavier than the last. That night, I camped in a small clearing, far from the main trail. I set up my tent under a thick canopy of pines, hoping the shadows would hide me. But when I woke up, my backpack was unzipped, my food bag moved to the other side of the tent. A small, folded piece of paper sat on top of it. My hands trembled as I opened it. Scrawled in jagged handwriting were the words: *You can’t hide.*

I stuffed the note into my pocket, my stomach churning. Someone had been in my camp while I slept. I checked my gear—nothing was missing, but the violation made my skin crawl. I packed up and hiked faster than ever, desperate to find other people.

That afternoon, I reached a wooden shelter where a group of hikers was resting. One of them, an older man with gray hair and a kind face, introduced himself as Tom. We shared a meal of instant noodles, and as the group chatted, I mentioned Sovereign, trying to sound casual.

“Have you seen a guy calling himself Sovereign?” I asked, stirring my noodles. “Scruffy beard, plays a guitar?”

Tom’s face darkened, his spoon pausing midair. “Yeah, I know him. Be careful, Laura. A week ago, he was at a shelter near Springer Mountain. Got drunk, started yelling about how he’d burn the place down with everyone in it. A hiker called the rangers, but he was gone before they showed up.”

My blood ran cold. “That’s awful,” I said, my voice barely above a whisper.

“He’s bad news,” Tom said, his eyes serious. “Stick with others if you can. Safety in numbers.”

I nodded, grateful for the warning but shaken to my core. For the next three days, I hiked with Tom and his group—four other hikers, all experienced and friendly. Their presence was a lifeline. We laughed over shared meals, swapped stories about the trail, and for a while, I felt safe. Sovereign didn’t appear, and I started to hope I’d lost him for good.

But on the fourth day, Tom’s group planned a longer hike to reach a town for resupply. I couldn’t keep up with their pace—my legs were sore, and my pack felt heavier with each mile. “I’ll catch up tomorrow,” I told them, waving as they pulled ahead.

That was my biggest mistake.

By late afternoon, I was alone again, hiking through a stretch of forest so dense the trees seemed to close in around me. The path was narrow, overgrown with roots and vines. I glanced back, a habit I’d developed, and my heart stopped. Sovereign was there, maybe two hundred yards behind, his figure unmistakable. His eyes locked onto mine, and he raised a hand, waving slowly, his lips curling into that same cold smile.

I quickened my pace, my boots slipping on loose dirt. He matched my speed, never closing the gap but never falling behind. My breath came in sharp gasps, panic rising like a tide. I veered off the main trail onto a faint side path, hoping the thick underbrush would hide me. The forest swallowed me, branches scratching my arms, leaves brushing my face. His footsteps followed, steady and relentless, like a predator tracking prey.

I ducked behind a massive oak, pressing my body against the rough bark. My chest heaved, but I forced myself to breathe quietly, my hand clutching the pepper spray in my pocket. The footsteps stopped. Silence pressed in, heavy and suffocating, broken only by the faint chirp of a distant bird. I waited, every muscle tense, praying he’d given up.

Then I heard it—a low, guttural chuckle, so close it made my skin prickle.

“Laura,” Sovereign whispered, his voice slithering through the air. “I know you’re there.”

I bit my lip to keep from screaming, my fingers tightening around the pepper spray. My mind raced—run or fight? The seconds dragged on, each one a lifetime. Then, slowly, his footsteps moved away, fading into the forest. I stayed frozen, too terrified to move, until the silence convinced me he was gone.

That night, I found a group of hikers at a crowded campsite and begged to stay near them. I told them about Sovereign, my voice shaking as I described the note and his pursuit. They were kind, offering me food and promising to keep watch. But sleep was impossible. Every snap of a twig, every rustle of wind, made me bolt upright, expecting to see his face peering through my tent.

The next day, I stuck close to the group, my eyes scanning the trees constantly. We hiked through rolling hills, the trail opening to meadows dotted with wildflowers, but the beauty felt hollow. I couldn’t shake the feeling that Sovereign was still out there, waiting. As evening fell, we reached a small campsite near a creek. I was setting up my tent, my hands still unsteady, when I heard it—crunching footsteps, slow and deliberate, coming from the woods.

My heart stopped. I grabbed my knife, a small but sharp blade I kept in my pack, and scanned the clearing. Sovereign stepped out from the trees, his eyes wild, a large hunting knife gleaming in his hand. His flannel shirt was stained with dirt, his face twisted with a mix of anger and excitement.

“Found you,” he said, his voice low and menacing.

“Please,” I said, backing away, my voice trembling. “Just leave me alone.”

He laughed, stepping closer, the knife catching the fading light. “You’re not going anywhere, Laura.”

I turned to run, my legs shaky but fueled by fear. He lunged, grabbing my arm and yanking me back. I screamed, swinging my knife blindly. The blade grazed his forearm, and he snarled, raising his weapon. I braced myself, my mind flooded with terror and regret—why had I hiked alone? Why hadn’t I stayed with the group?

A shout pierced the air. “Hey! Get away from her!”

It was Tom, sprinting into the clearing with two other hikers, their faces set with determination. Sovereign froze, his eyes darting between them. I seized the moment, kicking his shin as hard as I could. He stumbled, loosening his grip, and I wrenched free, running toward Tom.

The hikers tackled Sovereign, pinning him to the ground as he thrashed and yelled. One of them, a woman named Claire, pulled out a satellite phone and called for help. I collapsed near the creek, my body shaking, tears streaming down my face. The rangers arrived hours later, their flashlights cutting through the darkness. They cuffed Sovereign, who glared at me as they led him away. I later learned his real name was James Jordan, a man with a history of harassing and attacking hikers on the trail.

I was lucky. The fear still lingers, waking me at night with memories of his voice, his knife, that note. The Appalachian Trail is a place of beauty, but it taught me a brutal lesson: danger can lurk in the quiet of the wilderness, hidden behind a stranger’s smile. I’m grateful for Tom, Claire, and the others who saved me, and for the strength I found to keep going. But I’ll never hike alone again. The forest is too vast, too unpredictable, and some shadows never leave you.",1,1751796545.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

Bonus brownie points, should you know where that's from!

As a little preamble of sorts, and I guess you could say a warning, let me state the obvious: this advert is *long* and yes, it *could* be much, much shorter. However, the reason it *is* so long is because a lot of the things that I talk about here are matters concerning compatibility. Meaning, whether there even *is* a point to us taking this into the DMs. So! Let me ask you this: would you rather waste fifteen minutes reading this, or an entire week worth of planning? I leave the choice up to you!

In any case, if I didn't scare you off, you may as well get yourself a cup of tea, or coffee, and get comfortable!

Now, let's carry on, shall we?

\----✂︎-- Basic Introductions and Expectations! --✂︎----

So, I am a 24 year old female roleplayer hailing from the dark, mysterious lands also known as Eastern Europe! To be more specific, I come from Poland and this puts me in the CEST time zone. I have been engaged in this hobby for pretty much half my life at this point, and while there's no such thing as perfect, I consider myself to be at least decent! Other than writing, I also love tea, reading, j-RPGs, anime, fantasy fiction of all sorts, as well as anything that's got fur and walks on four legs!

Oh, and I also happen to be a transgender woman. If you've got an issue with that, do me a kindness, and do not message me!

Now, let me get some things out of the way, first:

1. Please be at least 20 years old of age, or older; this has got nothing to do with writing ability, and everything with my personal comfort. So, I will not make any exceptions. At the same time, I prefer to write with people close to my age, so my upper limit is around 35 years old.
2. At the moment, I prefer not to write with men. Sorry!
3. As of currently, I only write on Discord and nowhere else.
4. I require the reply rate of **at least** once per day, and I also highly prefer that multiple replies a day are possible at least every now and then. But, **no**, by no means do I require that every single day, and naturally, real-life always comes first.
5. I am advanced literate; I will elaborate on this more further into the advert, but my replies typically take between 300-600 words and may even reach 1000 words and I am looking for people on a similar level.
6. Strong OOC contact is required; half of the fun in this hobby comes to me from the OOC fangirling and brainstorming that surrounds it, and yes: I do prefer to befriend my writing partners. While that should come about naturally, I will already tell you that we will not be a good fit if you are opposed to that.
7. I am against the use of face-claims of any kind, and it's a deal-breaker, even if it's to be a one-sided arrangement.
8. NFSW the way it is usually understood is unlikely; I highly prefer fade-to-black. Should you message me from an account with *any* amount of ERPer content, you will be rejected on the spot no matter what.

Please note that while I am more than happy to elaborate on any of these, none of them really are up to discussion, debate or meaningful compromise. You will particularly make a very poor first impression, should you lead with point no. 8. I really mean it, too. You will only end up wasting your time, should you message me from a smut account.

Another thing that's important is schedule compatibility. To put it in a way that's short and sweet: if you are only going to be available prior to 12 PM my time, or after 10 PM my time, this is not going to work. As the planning stage tends to take a while with me even at the best of times, this is not negotiable. So, please take that in mind before you decide to message me.

I would also appreciate if you had a good amount of free time on weekends; I can usually do some back-and-forth during the week, but it's on the weekends that I can promise the most of my undivided attention.

Thaaaat... should be it! Now, let us carry on!

\----✂︎-- What do I want to write! --✂︎----

So, what is it that I want to write?

Adventure! A(n epic) fantasy tale that will be equally rife with the power of love and friendship, but also drama and angst! What I want to write is a plot-driven piece of fiction with an expansive ensemble cast of diverse and vibrant characters with a dense plot-line, rich lore and tons of world-building! The kind of story that I wish to write would be something akin to a DnD adventure, with a band of heroes traveling from town to town, braving perilous wilderness, conquering ancient dungeons, meeting new friends and allies and defeating fearsome foes, while a powerful evil looms behind the horizon! With the 'twist', of course, that all this should happen within a world that has at least reached the steam engine!

Or, at least, that's the general gist. The details are for us to work out together!

What is also important is that, as a collaborative writer, I wish to build everything in our little story from the ground-up... except for monsters, creatures and other sorts of beasts. In this case, I am no stranger to shamelessly stealing preexisting concepts! It is not a perfect approach, but I don't believe in perfect, and I would love to write with someone interested in the same!

This also means that if you have a highly fleshed out world and/or story idea of your own, I will not be very interested. Still, I wish you the best of luck with it!

I have mentioned that what I want to write is post-industrial fantasy. Still, I should let you know that my brand of modern (or urban) fantasy is still closer to medieval fantasy classics like Lord of the Rings, rather than your average urban fantasy YA as I still make liberal use of many tropes, cliches and storytelling tropes present in the former!

How advanced should our setting be? Let's discuss that together! So long the world has at least reached the early industrial revolution, and so long it hasn't achieved quick, and convenient interstellar travel! I am open to anything in-between!

Oh, and I love a strong element of action so it is best that you enjoy writing out action scenes, and feel at least somewhat comfortable AND confident while writing them. I am also not the right partner for you, if you care much for realism in the aspect. The action I write *would* be pretty grounded compared to, say, Dragon Ball Z or the Invincible, but by objective standards... not very. Do expect anime/action movie sort of BS while coming in!

Oh, and I may want to spell it out as it has been an issue before: I am really not interested in primarily character-driven stories. Characters give life to the story, but I *need* a central, larger-than-life conflict to move the story along, and I do prefer for there to be very high stakes. It's not everyone's yum, but it is my yum, so just take that in mind!

Now, let us get onto...!

\----✂︎-- Writing! --✂︎----

Ah, writing – that is, the bread and butter of this hobby.

I have already talked briefly about it in the 'about me' section, but let me elaborate a bit more. As I said, my replies typically range between 300-600 words, with my larger responses reaching up to 1000 words and sometimes even more, and no, I couldn't tell you how much is that in paragraphs. Still, I don't believe in quotas, nor do I believe in padding the replies to fit said quotas and my approach to the beautiful, flowery kind of language is that it is like salt when used in cooking. Amazing when you use it in moderation, and not-so-amazing when you just dump a whole kilogram into the pot.

Oh, and I write exclusively in third person and past tense, and I require the same of my writing partners.

Still, while I do agree some degree of flexibility is required, this only goes so far with me. I generally prefer replies do not get much smaller than 150 words at the least, and no matter the situation, I will not accept a response that is only a couple sentences, or a one-liner.

I am happy to exchange writing samples in private messages, but that is entirely up to you. I don't require them myself and it's rare that I ever ask if not asked first.

\----✂︎-- The Characters! --✂︎----

So, the most important thing is that I create and tailor all my characters from scratch for every single story and I prefer to write with those who share a similar approach.

That also means that what sort of lead character I will come up is anyone's guess! Still, I write exclusively female characters in the lead roles for all my stories, and I usually tend to make them on the slightly more older side. (That is, between late 20s to mid-30s.) As a rule, I prefer to write protagonists experienced in their trade, but that isn't *necessarily* a deal-breaker if I like the story idea enough! Oh, and of course, given the sort of story I am looking for, she will kick ass. Though, I would think that's probably stating the obvious!

I should also probably mention this, as I have had a couple promising conversations go nowhere because of this... but, unfortunately, I am not interested in writing against lead characters who are amoral, or morally gray. That is, *not* if you intend for them to stay that way throughout the story. I *do* love such characters, do not get me wrong! Still, I unfortunately do not like them as the lead characters, specifically. Which is *not* to say I expect for your lead character to be a morally pure goody two-shoes without a mean bone in her body or any character flaws. Absolutely not! I simply prefer characters that, when push comes to shove, will at least *try* to do the right thing and for their heart to be ultimately in the right place. That's all! 

Personally, I also just find it emotionally draining when no one in the story is truly neither good nor evil, but that's just a side note.

Overall though, it is a requirement that you feel comfortable writing any characters that may vary by gender, age\*, personality, social background, romantic orientation, as well as moral alignment. Is it a tall order? Perhaps! But, I do offer the same on my end! I also simply love the process of character creation, and I seek those matching my energy!

\*That said, all major characters ought to be at least 21 years old of age.

I should also say a word or two about romance, as that makes or breaks the hobby for many people if not most of them. I love to write it, I love to have it, and I probably wouldn't enjoy a fully platonic roleplay, ***but*** I also do not want it as the centerpiece of the story. It can be important (and it should be, if our main characters are involved together) and it can take a lot of page time, but it cannot be the main plot and it shouldn't be the only thing you care for about in the story, either.

I also do prefer slow-burn, especially as far as the leading duo is concerned. Now, I will not *force* it if it doesn't make sense or requires active meta-sabogating, but I will naturally lean into it, so please be aware!

I also have a hard requirement for FxF for the main pairing, *but* I also prefer partners able and willing to also write FxM/MxF and MxM ships for the other characters. Although, the MxM isn't a deal-breaker if you'd rather not write that or do not feel confident with it.

\----✂︎-- My writing dislikes and what I prefer to avoid! --✂︎----

Okay, so this is going to be a more cynical section.

Still, since a fair amount of my dislikes happen to be staples on the roleplaying scene, I prefer to get them out of the way as to help some of you from wasting your time. So, the things that I prefer to avoid in my stories are:

Fandoms, pre-industrial fantasy settings, sanitized immoral groups, fluff/grimdark extremes, slice-of-life (as a genre), vampire/werewolf stories, arranged marriage, enemies-to-lovers, the Masquerade (when the existence of magic is a secret), magic being banned/persecuted setting-wide, stories with no true heroes nor villains, police/military settings (as the primary background), school settings, stories taking place in a single location, settings based off the real world (e.x. HP, Marvel, PJO), love at the first sight, large age gaps involving young adults, shock content for its own sake, evil protagonists,

... and that is it! Probably.

In truth, there are very few storytelling tropes and conventions I would never use, so I am more than happy to elaborate on any of this! For example, the reason I dislike 'enemies to lovers' is because this either necessitates for romance to be the centerpiece of the story, or for the 'to lovers' part to happen very quickly. But, should it happen naturally between side characters, I will probably love it and eat it all up! *Still*, I wouldn't lead with any of the tropes mentioned above when messaging me, regardless, as I either dislike them, am very particular about them or may simply not be in the mood for some of them at the moment.

As for what I actually enjoy, my advert thus far has hopefully given you at least a rough idea, and I would be unfortunately beside myself to make an organized list of what I want and do enjoy. Especially since I want each story to be its own unique creation!

(That said, I would love to write with a fellow Final Fantasy fan!)

Hopefully this section hasn't discouraged you, and if it has, then I'm glad it at least saved you some time!

\----✂︎-- Fin! --✂︎----

So, that pretty much does it!

Anyway, when you choose to message me, I would like to know: how may I call you, what is your age, your pronouns, the time-zone (as well as country, if you feel comfortable enough to share!), any potential story triggers and, most important. some starting pitch for a story! Now, to be clear, I don't expect for you to come at me with anything detailed! In fact, I actually prefer that you don't. Especially not when this advert provides no concrete ideas in and of itself. All I really want is just a starting point for the two of us to gauge our compatibility together.

Oh, and if you're going to ask me for a sample, then you might as well lead by sending one, first! Since I'll ask for one in return, anyway!

If I managed to pique your interest, then I would love to have your message! Otherwise, I hope you have a great day, or night!

1lsxoke,https://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/1lsxoke/calling_all_freelancerscreatives/,Calling all freelancers/creatives,"Hi everyone,

I’ve launched an app in London called Werksy (https://werksy.io)

The app itself allows you to work from inspiring workspaces without needing a membership at any of them. You can just tap-in, tap-out only paying for the time you spend there. Perfect for if you’re on the move for work or want to get out the house.

I’m working on a new feature and looking to do some 1:1 chats with freelancers, entrepreneurs and creatives (basically anyone who works remotely and hops around spaces or coffee shops).

💸 As a thank you, I’ll give you a £20 credit to use on the app - enough to get you a solid half-day somewhere.

If you’re up for a quick call (15–20 mins), here’s the link to book:

Bonus brownie points, should you know where that's from!

As a little preamble of sorts, and I guess you could say a warning, let me state the obvious: this advert is *long* and yes, it *could* be much, much shorter. However, the reason it *is* so long is because a lot of the things that I talk about here are matters concerning compatibility. Meaning, whether there even *is* a point to us taking this into the DMs. So! Let me ask you this: would you rather waste fifteen minutes reading this, or an entire week worth of planning? I leave the choice up to you!

In any case, if I didn't scare you off, you may as well get yourself a cup of tea, or coffee, and get comfortable!

Now, let's carry on, shall we?

\----✂︎-- Basic Introductions and Expectations! --✂︎----

So, I am a 24 year old female roleplayer hailing from the dark, mysterious lands also known as Eastern Europe! To be more specific, I come from Poland and this puts me in the CEST time zone. I have been engaged in this hobby for pretty much half my life at this point, and while there's no such thing as perfect, I consider myself to be at least decent! Other than writing, I also love tea, reading, j-RPGs, anime, fantasy fiction of all sorts, as well as anything that's got fur and walks on four legs!

Oh, and I also happen to be a transgender woman. If you've got an issue with that, do me a kindness, and do not message me!

Now, let me get some things out of the way, first:

1. Please be at least 20 years old of age, or older; this has got nothing to do with writing ability, and everything with my personal comfort. So, I will not make any exceptions. At the same time, I prefer to write with people close to my age, so my upper limit is around 35 years old.
2. At the moment, I prefer not to write with men. Sorry!
3. As of currently, I only write on Discord and nowhere else.
4. I require the reply rate of **at least** once per day, and I also highly prefer that multiple replies a day are possible at least every now and then. But, **no**, by no means do I require that every single day, and naturally, real-life always comes first.
5. I am advanced literate; I will elaborate on this more further into the advert, but my replies typically take between 300-600 words and may even reach 1000 words and I am looking for people on a similar level.
6. Strong OOC contact is required; half of the fun in this hobby comes to me from the OOC fangirling and brainstorming that surrounds it, and yes: I do prefer to befriend my writing partners. While that should come about naturally, I will already tell you that we will not be a good fit if you are opposed to that.
7. I am against the use of face-claims of any kind, and it's a deal-breaker, even if it's to be a one-sided arrangement.
8. NFSW the way it is usually understood is unlikely; I highly prefer fade-to-black. Should you message me from an account with *any* amount of ERPer content, you will be rejected on the spot no matter what.

Please note that while I am more than happy to elaborate on any of these, none of them really are up to discussion, debate or meaningful compromise. You will particularly make a very poor first impression, should you lead with point no. 8. I really mean it, too. You will only end up wasting your time, should you message me from a smut account.

Another thing that's important is schedule compatibility. To put it in a way that's short and sweet: if you are only going to be available prior to 12 PM my time, or after 10 PM my time, this is not going to work. As the planning stage tends to take a while with me even at the best of times, this is not negotiable. So, please take that in mind before you decide to message me.

I would also appreciate if you had a good amount of free time on weekends; I can usually do some back-and-forth during the week, but it's on the weekends that I can promise the most of my undivided attention.

Thaaaat... should be it! Now, let us carry on!

\----✂︎-- What do I want to write! --✂︎----

So, what is it that I want to write?

Adventure! A(n epic) fantasy tale that will be equally rife with the power of love and friendship, but also drama and angst! What I want to write is a plot-driven piece of fiction with an expansive ensemble cast of diverse and vibrant characters with a dense plot-line, rich lore and tons of world-building! The kind of story that I wish to write would be something akin to a DnD adventure, with a band of heroes traveling from town to town, braving perilous wilderness, conquering ancient dungeons, meeting new friends and allies and defeating fearsome foes, while a powerful evil looms behind the horizon! With the 'twist', of course, that all this should happen within a world that has at least reached the steam engine!

Or, at least, that's the general gist. The details are for us to work out together!

What is also important is that, as a collaborative writer, I wish to build everything in our little story from the ground-up... except for monsters, creatures and other sorts of beasts. In this case, I am no stranger to shamelessly stealing preexisting concepts! It is not a perfect approach, but I don't believe in perfect, and I would love to write with someone interested in the same!

This also means that if you have a highly fleshed out world and/or story idea of your own, I will not be very interested. Still, I wish you the best of luck with it!

I have mentioned that what I want to write is post-industrial fantasy. Still, I should let you know that my brand of modern (or urban) fantasy is still closer to medieval fantasy classics like Lord of the Rings, rather than your average urban fantasy YA as I still make liberal use of many tropes, cliches and storytelling tropes present in the former!

How advanced should our setting be? Let's discuss that together! So long the world has at least reached the early industrial revolution, and so long it hasn't achieved quick, and convenient interstellar travel! I am open to anything in-between!

Oh, and I love a strong element of action so it is best that you enjoy writing out action scenes, and feel at least somewhat comfortable AND confident while writing them. I am also not the right partner for you, if you care much for realism in the aspect. The action I write *would* be pretty grounded compared to, say, Dragon Ball Z or the Invincible, but by objective standards... not very. Do expect anime/action movie sort of BS while coming in!

Oh, and I may want to spell it out as it has been an issue before: I am really not interested in primarily character-driven stories. Characters give life to the story, but I *need* a central, larger-than-life conflict to move the story along, and I do prefer for there to be very high stakes. It's not everyone's yum, but it is my yum, so just take that in mind!

Now, let us get onto...!

\----✂︎-- Writing! --✂︎----

Ah, writing – that is, the bread and butter of this hobby.

I have already talked briefly about it in the 'about me' section, but let me elaborate a bit more. As I said, my replies typically range between 300-600 words, with my larger responses reaching up to 1000 words and sometimes even more, and no, I couldn't tell you how much is that in paragraphs. Still, I don't believe in quotas, nor do I believe in padding the replies to fit said quotas and my approach to the beautiful, flowery kind of language is that it is like salt when used in cooking. Amazing when you use it in moderation, and not-so-amazing when you just dump a whole kilogram into the pot.

Oh, and I write exclusively in third person and past tense, and I require the same of my writing partners.

Still, while I do agree some degree of flexibility is required, this only goes so far with me. I generally prefer replies do not get much smaller than 150 words at the least, and no matter the situation, I will not accept a response that is only a couple sentences, or a one-liner.

I am happy to exchange writing samples in private messages, but that is entirely up to you. I don't require them myself and it's rare that I ever ask if not asked first.

\----✂︎-- The Characters! --✂︎----

So, the most important thing is that I create and tailor all my characters from scratch for every single story and I prefer to write with those who share a similar approach.

That also means that what sort of lead character I will come up is anyone's guess! Still, I write exclusively female characters in the lead roles for all my stories, and I usually tend to make them on the slightly more older side. (That is, between late 20s to mid-30s.) As a rule, I prefer to write protagonists experienced in their trade, but that isn't *necessarily* a deal-breaker if I like the story idea enough! Oh, and of course, given the sort of story I am looking for, she will kick ass. Though, I would think that's probably stating the obvious!

I should also probably mention this, as I have had a couple promising conversations go nowhere because of this... but, unfortunately, I am not interested in writing against lead characters who are amoral, or morally gray. That is, *not* if you intend for them to stay that way throughout the story. I *do* love such characters, do not get me wrong! Still, I unfortunately do not like them as the lead characters, specifically. Which is *not* to say I expect for your lead character to be a morally pure goody two-shoes without a mean bone in her body or any character flaws. Absolutely not! I simply prefer characters that, when push comes to shove, will at least *try* to do the right thing and for their heart to be ultimately in the right place. That's all! 

Personally, I also just find it emotionally draining when no one in the story is truly neither good nor evil, but that's just a side note.

Overall though, it is a requirement that you feel comfortable writing any characters that may vary by gender, age\*, personality, social background, romantic orientation, as well as moral alignment. Is it a tall order? Perhaps! But, I do offer the same on my end! I also simply love the process of character creation, and I seek those matching my energy!

\*That said, all major characters ought to be at least 21 years old of age.

I should also say a word or two about romance, as that makes or breaks the hobby for many people if not most of them. I love to write it, I love to have it, and I probably wouldn't enjoy a fully platonic roleplay, ***but*** I also do not want it as the centerpiece of the story. It can be important (and it should be, if our main characters are involved together) and it can take a lot of page time, but it cannot be the main plot and it shouldn't be the only thing you care for about in the story, either.

I also do prefer slow-burn, especially as far as the leading duo is concerned. Now, I will not *force* it if it doesn't make sense or requires active meta-sabogating, but I will naturally lean into it, so please be aware!

I also have a hard requirement for FxF for the main pairing, *but* I also prefer partners able and willing to also write FxM/MxF and MxM ships for the other characters. Although, the MxM isn't a deal-breaker if you'd rather not write that or do not feel confident with it.

Few months after that we started dating. Kind of, because most of the time he was busy with work. For that reason often I drove to city where he lived and worked, to parking lot near his workplace to bring him food and coffee. And whenever he had time, we spent weekends together. From the very beginning he had this weird request/expectation that I has to ask him out instead of him asking me. If I did not ask that often enough, he became irritated and said that I don't even want to see him., accused me of not caring, often deleted our messages. I  did ask him out, but me having to be the only one who was always asking, made me a bit uncomfortable. Fast forward a few months - he got into trouble with law and went to prison for more than half a year. I agreed to wait for him, because I cared enough to want to give this a chance and could not stand the thought of abandoning someone in hard times like that. So I spent almost all of my free time writing letters to him as support, we talked on the phone each day, but he was allowed only very short conversations. I sent him money each month and clothes, to the point I was having hard time to put food on my own table. Unfortunately I was not able to visit as he was far away and my financial situation was not good at all. I even ended up paying part of his legal bills - as much as I could afford. I also had to buy another car, because before he left, my car had issues and I gave it to him for a week or so, to look at those issues, as he said he could do that. When we talked on the phone on several occasions he accused me of ""having fun without him when he is in such a place."" Sometimes he just hung up on me without warning. I would not say I had fun. Most of my free time consisted of writing  letters. My whole life at that period was planned around his calls and writing letters, because I wanted to support him. After he came back, I hoped that my waiting had proved to him that I cared. When his sentence ended, he did not come back for a few weeks. And when he did, in the beginning of course we were happy to see each other after all this time. But from the very beginning he was very moody and kept accusing me of not caring, not doing things his way, for not listening to him. He often criticized me for all kinds of things. For example - if I made food, he sometimes complained that he cannot eat that. When I did not, he accused me of starving him. If he had come from work early and fallen asleep - he was angry that I did not woke him up. And on different day, when I woke him up, he was angry that I woke him up. Not long after he came back, he found a job and after approximately one month left it in such a hurry and resentment, that he did not even manage to get his months payment from this place. To be precise, after he left, he refused to pick up calls from that workplace. We were in a very bad financial situation. I could barely support us both. After that came two more jobs, where he worked just a little and then moved on. For these later workplaces he even refused to disclose their locations. And not to mention - he rarely brought any money home, at least for food. Then it turned out that there is a court case against him about debts. He kept that to himself. Also after he came back, I found out that he had stored this my ""repairable car"" in unsafe environment and that now it was stolen. I gave him this another car I purchased, so that he could drive to work. Meanwhile we often had arguments and one of worst things is that he almost every time in an argument, screamed at me, called me names and usually stormed out just to disappear for hours and then came back and pretended like nothing happened, saying that I was saying hurtful things and therefore such behaviour is expected.  On several occasions he even threw things in my direction, saying that he would have hit me with that throw, if he wanted. Called me a gold digger when I was sharing with him my concerns that I am struggling to put food on the table. He often threatened to leave. In between jobs he was at home and spent almost all time just laying around and scrolling his phone. No cooking, no housework, nothing. He was often saying that because I do white collar job, I cannot be tired and should do all the housework. For extra money he had the idea of doing doordash, but he never started doing that, which I could not comprehend because if he did not paid off his debts, there was a high chance that he would go back to prison. After all these arguments I started growing colder. I felt like he is deliberately keeping things from me, always trying to tear me down and that he is the only one hurting. That was his ""go-to"" argument in every fight we had - that he did all these things because I am hurting him. I felt like I am going crazy - my mind could not comprehend how it is possible to be so emotionally violent in arguments towards the person he says he cares about. One of the final straws was when he threatened to hit me in the face with chair and later tried to convince me that it is nothing special to say things like that, and that he would never do that. For more than a year I was supporting him emotionally and practically, and yet in every argument I was the bad one - always hurting him and demanding too much. Is expectation to talk about things calmly, share important information and help with housework too much? After some time he even refused to eat and drink saying that he could not do that, because he was too distressed about our arguments. And then blamed me for ruining his health. I'm just too tired of not being heard and supported. I supported him as much I as could, but he always ended up saying that I have done nothing.

Cups using advanced thermochromic materials will exhibit faster and more dramatic transformations,providing a more engaging visual experience.furthermore,higher-quality pigments are less prone to fading or degrading with repeated use and washing.

Ceramic cups provide a more premium feel with better heat retention, ideal for enjoying hot beverages. High quality glass options are also available that offer the best look and feel, but may also come with a larger price tag. The material should be BPA-free and food-grade to ensure safety, and resistant to cracking or chipping under normal usage conditions.

**design and Aesthetics:** Beyond the color changing aspect, the design of the cup itself is a crucial factor. Cups come in a wide array of shapes, sizes, and decorative patterns. Some feature minimalist designs that highlight the color conversion,while others incorporate intricate artwork that complements the changing hues. Consider details such as the handle design, the ergonomics of the cup, and the overall visual appeal when choosing a cup that matches your personal style.

**Temperature Sensitivity & Range:** The effectiveness of a color changing cup hinges on its ability to react to various temperature ranges. A well-designed cup should trigger a noticeable color change with both hot and cold liquids. Specifics should be included such as “turns colors at 60 degrees farehneit"" or other temperature ranges as needed. The ideal temperature range for color transformation is typically between 50°F (10°C) to 120°F (49°C), ensuring a dramatic shift without requiring extreme hot or cold.

**Ease of Cleaning:** Practicality is key when selecting a daily use cup. Color changing cups should be easy to clean either by hand or in a dishwasher. The thermochromic coating should be resistant to damage from detergents and the high temperatures of dishwashers. Some cups may require hand washing to prolong the lifespan of the color changing affect. Check manufacturer guidelines for specific cleaning instructions to maintain the cup's performance and appearance.

(I live in USA but currently travelling in EU)

Hi all,

I’m hoping to get some legal insight into a situation that feels off.

I subscribed to a 3-month premium plan on the dating app Coffee Meets Bagel (CmB). A few days later, my account was suddenly banned without warning, even though I hadn’t violated any rules (at least from what I could tell). When I reached out to their support team asking for a partial refund (since I barely used the subscription), I got vague responses, then a final message stating:

“Your account is banned. This decision is final. For privacy and safety reasons, we won’t share more details.”

What’s especially strange is the ban happened right after I asked for a refund, not after any chargeback or formal dispute. I hadn’t gone through Apple yet — just asked CmB directly. So it feels like they retaliated just for requesting a refund.

Now here’s where it might be a bigger deal:
I found out Apple punishes developers if they get too many chargebacks. It made me wonder — is CmB banning users who complain or ask for refunds to avoid chargebacks and protect their developer status with Apple?

That’s potentially 

- Retaliation for a good-faith refund request
- A violation of consumer protection laws
- A scaled issue that could affect many other users

It’s not a huge dollar amount (less than $130), but if this is happening to hundreds or thousands of people quietly, the pattern becomes really problematic.

I’m currently having a business travel in Italy for 5 weeks, so I’ve also filed a complaint under the Digital Services Act (DSA) and requested full deletion of my personal data under GDPR — especially since they still have my passport and ID photos, which I submitted during account verification. I no longer trust them with my data.

My questions:

- Is it legal for a company to ban a user with no specific reason right after they ask for a refund?
- If this is part of a broader pattern, what agency (in the US or Canada) would be appropriate to file a complaint with?
- Can I take further action if they’ve essentially kept my money and personal data without offering due process?

Thanks in advance for any insight. I know this isn’t a huge amount of money, but I believe small-scale cases like this are how some companies quietly exploit users at scale.

I (F, 21) and my ex — let’s call him J — have known each other since childhood, but we were never close until college. We both joined the youth committee of our community. It’s a pretty popular group — kind of like the “in-crowd” within our society. Slowly, as people left, a smaller core of us remained. That core eventually became our own little circle.

J became pretty popular after joining the group, especially with the girls. He was already known by the guys, but suddenly he was everyone’s favorite. I had a soft corner for him — not a full-on crush, but I liked how we had similar upbringings. Both of us were introverts, never really social in the community, mostly had school friends.

But while I stayed invisible, J bloomed. Everyone knew him. Everyone wanted to talk to him. And while it did sting a little, I didn’t think much of it.

That’s when I noticed two girls in the group — A and F.
A is… honestly the biggest pick-me girl I’ve ever encountered. I’m not saying this out of jealousy. She literally brags about only having guy friends, thrives on attention, and has a long track record of “being friendly” with almost every guy in our group. She’s always hated me — and the moment I got slightly included, she worked extra hard to make me feel unwelcome. She did everything she could to isolate me.

F is slightly better. She’s been nice to me sometimes, so I’ll give her that. But she’s also the same kind of “cool girl” archetype who slides in just enough to stay popular without ever being genuine.

What hurt the most was J — the one guy I thought was different — got *very* close to A and F. Weirdly close. All while telling me “they’re like sisters to me.” I didn’t buy it, but I stayed quiet. I wanted him to be my best friend more than anything. But it felt like he kept getting promoted socially while I was still on the outside looking in.

Then one day, he asked me out.
I was shocked, honestly. I had pushed away feelings for so long, thinking he wouldn’t see me that way. We agreed to keep it private for a month, just to make sure things worked before going public.

And then… it began.

Within a week, F (who lives abroad and visits once a year) asked J to hang out *alone*. He told me about it and asked if I wanted to come, but I was pissed. She clearly didn’t want *me* there — just him. So I said no, go ahead. I brushed it off, but I felt uneasy.

Mind you, me, J, A, and F all grew up together. A and F are a year older. And they were *never* this close to J before. Suddenly, it’s late-night video calls between the three of them, group hangouts, flirty stories, and me watching it all unfold through his Snapchat and Instagram.

And while we were dating — he never asked me to hang out publicly. No mall dates. No coffee shop plans. He only wanted to come over to *my house*.
Whenever I asked why we couldn’t go out like normal couples, he’d say “people might see” or “I’m shy.”
But somehow he was never too shy to go out with *them*.

I started making excuses like “my house isn’t empty” just to avoid the situation because I was so uncomfortable.

Then came the moment that broke me.

He sent me a sweet mail from his internship one day. I was happy, thinking it was a thoughtful gesture — until I saw that he had **cc’ed A** in the exact same email.
Same words. Same everything.
I didn’t yell. I just stopped replying. I ignored his texts. We slowly drifted and broke up.

After the breakup, he casually told me that he had already told A and F that we were dating.

That was it. That was the last straw.

I had *one* boundary. *One*. I told him how uncomfortable A made me. How she treated me. And he still went ahead and did the exact thing I begged him not to.
And A? She was *thrilled* when we broke up. She’s the kind of person who’ll have everything in her hands and still try to snatch what someone else has — just because she can.

Right now, there are fewer boys left in our committee group. That’s probably why she clings to J. The minute someone newer or better shows up, she’ll drop him like nothing happened.

No, I don’t think he was dating either of them. But I *do* think he had feelings for one or both. It’s just something my gut tells me. The way he’d act — sending me texts like “me and F took a good pic today” to make me jealous, or A biting his finger in a story — it wasn’t normal “best friend” behavior.

After we broke up, he was suddenly living his best life — hanging out with them all the time. There are 15 people in our committee, and a core 10 of us in the active team. Out of those, 6 hang out together — 4 boys and 2 girls (one being A, who *chooses* the other girl). They exclude me entirely. Even when the rest of us join, they tone it down and leave quickly.

If I’m not there, they’re hanging at each other’s houses, clicking pictures, having the best time.
If I *am* there, it’s stiff. Cold. Polite conversations until they can dip.

And it sucks.

As an introvert, all I ever wanted was to feel like I belonged. Just a few people who cared. A place to laugh and feel safe. And people like A ruin that — not just by what they do, but by convincing others that *you’re* the problem.

This group… it was the only social thread I had. And it’s gone.

I’m not writing this for sympathy.
But what a lot of people don’t know is — my dad has stage 4 cancer. I’m the eldest daughter. I handle a lot. I barely go out. My life is heavy. All I ever wanted was a little peace, some company, some laughter to balance the chaos.

There are days when I look at their pictures and cry myself to sleep.
Nights when I ask God — *Why me?*
Why did I have to lose my place in the one circle I tried to build?

I really really do hope karma is real

I don’t want pity. I just want this *time* in my life to pass.
The loneliness. The betrayal. The fake smiles. The pain of watching people you once loved — laughing without you.

I just hope someday, I find better people. People who value me. People who don’t make me feel like a stranger in my own life.

Until then, I’ll just keep going.

(Also Just a rant lol)

You've done it. The single worst airport terminal where I've ever had the pleasure of being touched inappropriately by security. Here's my review after flying through it twice. 

Arbitrary baggage requirements - It started at the first interaction where I was forced to remove my cpap device (no battery, no combustibles) from my checked bag because it was ""too valuable"". Never mind that idgaf about that and would vastly prefer replacing it to lugging it around and taking up bin space. 

Long, long, long lines EVERYWHERE - Self check in had lines. Bag drop had lines (incl. SP and D1). Security had lines. Amex lounge had lines. Restaurants have lines. Gate has lines. Toilets have lines. Oh and a ton of airport workers in high viz just standing around doing nothing to speed things up or help.

Incredibly aggressive security - I have a flying outfit that's passed security flawlessly worldwide. Here they flagged something in my pocket and didn't let me go even after I'd turned it inside out. Cue a bodywide heavy pat down that included my underwear. I wanted the pay the guy to continue to a hand job since he was already there. But he had to go, probably up harass someone to take off their hat or vest in case they have a howitzer hidden in there.

ZERO seating - I wandered the terminal from one end to the other and found THREE open seats. The entire rest of the main seating areas  were completely full. I have never been to an international terminal where you couldn't find a place to sit.

Hot - Turns out when you overfill a building, the HVAC can't keep up. 

Gates announced late - For some absurd reason they don't announce gate numbers till right before boarding (15 mins for my flight). Which is just awesome when it takes about 10-20 minutes to reach some of the gates, even as a relatively mobile person. 

Long walks everywhere - Because why use architecture to reduce the misery of your passengers. They've specifically blocked off some shortcuts in the duty free stores to make you walk even further. Also you'll walk a lot regardless of whether you're connecting or checking in at this terminal. 

Oh and status won't save you. The only way you can survive this absolute shithole is by flying premium or upper class/D1 and getting the concierge service + Clubhouse lounge. As a diamond, the one perk I got was special security where I didn't have to take my laptops out (but where I almost had my dick out). 

As a Amex platinum or delta reserve you get access to the Centurion lounge (after a 45 waitlist). Enjoy a lounge that has no windows whatsoever, is crowded and needs to go up to the bartender to get anything other than tea/coffee, water. Currently filled with an obligatory screaming child as I type this. 

Thanks Delta for making this my experience flying with you. I saw a dad lose it on his kids, screaming and I suspect that sort thing happens frequently in this chamber of misery.

Honestly it's embarrassing to see a shithole like this in a country like this. Some of the worst terminals I've been to have a small selection of these issues but not all together.",3,1751795171.0,delta,2,1.0,False

Within a week, F (who lives abroad and visits once a year) asked J to hang out *alone*. He told me about it and asked if I wanted to come, but I was pissed. She clearly didn’t want *me* there — just him. So I said no, go ahead. I brushed it off, but I felt uneasy.

Mind you, me, J, A, and F all grew up together. A and F are a year older. And they were *never* this close to J before. Suddenly, it’s late-night video calls between the three of them, group hangouts, flirty stories, and me watching it all unfold through his Snapchat and Instagram.

And while we were dating — he never asked me to hang out publicly. No mall dates. No coffee shop plans. He only wanted to come over to *my house*.
Whenever I asked why we couldn’t go out like normal couples, he’d say “people might see” or “I’m shy.”
But somehow he was never too shy to go out with *them*.

I started making excuses like “my house isn’t empty” just to avoid the situation because I was so uncomfortable.

Then came the moment that broke me.

He sent me a sweet mail from his internship one day. I was happy, thinking it was a thoughtful gesture — until I saw that he had **cc’ed A** in the exact same email.
Same words. Same everything.
I didn’t yell. I just stopped replying. I ignored his texts. We slowly drifted and broke up.

After the breakup, he casually told me that he had already told A and F that we were dating.

That was it. That was the last straw.

I had *one* boundary. *One*. I told him how uncomfortable A made me. How she treated me. And he still went ahead and did the exact thing I begged him not to.
And A? She was *thrilled* when we broke up. She’s the kind of person who’ll have everything in her hands and still try to snatch what someone else has — just because she can.

Right now, there are fewer boys left in our committee group. That’s probably why she clings to J. The minute someone newer or better shows up, she’ll drop him like nothing happened.

No, I don’t think he was dating either of them. But I *do* think he had feelings for one or both. It’s just something my gut tells me. The way he’d act — sending me texts like “me and F took a good pic today” to make me jealous, or A biting his finger in a story — it wasn’t normal “best friend” behavior.

After we broke up, he was suddenly living his best life — hanging out with them all the time. There are 15 people in our committee, and a core 10 of us in the active team. Out of those, 6 hang out together — 4 boys and 2 girls (one being A, who *chooses* the other girl). They exclude me entirely. Even when the rest of us join, they tone it down and leave quickly.

If I’m not there, they’re hanging at each other’s houses, clicking pictures, having the best time.
If I *am* there, it’s stiff. Cold. Polite conversations until they can dip.

And it sucks.

As an introvert, all I ever wanted was to feel like I belonged. Just a few people who cared. A place to laugh and feel safe. And people like A ruin that — not just by what they do, but by convincing others that *you’re* the problem.

This group… it was the only social thread I had. And it’s gone.

I’m not writing this for sympathy.
But what a lot of people don’t know is — my dad has stage 4 cancer. I’m the eldest daughter. I handle a lot. I barely go out. My life is heavy. All I ever wanted was a little peace, some company, some laughter to balance the chaos.

There are days when I look at their pictures and cry myself to sleep.
Nights when I ask God — *Why me?*
Why did I have to lose my place in the one circle I tried to build?

I really really do hope karma is real

I don’t want pity. I just want this *time* in my life to pass.
The loneliness. The betrayal. The fake smiles. The pain of watching people you once loved — laughing without you.

I just hope someday, I find better people. People who value me. People who don’t make me feel like a stranger in my own life.

Until then, I’ll just keep going.

I (F, 21) and my ex — let’s call him J — have known each other since childhood, but we were never close until college. We both joined the youth committee of our community. It’s a pretty popular group — kind of like the “in-crowd” within our society. Slowly, as people left, a smaller core of us remained. That core eventually became our own little circle.

J became pretty popular after joining the group, especially with the girls. He was already known by the guys, but suddenly he was everyone’s favorite. I had a soft corner for him — not a full-on crush, but I liked how we had similar upbringings. Both of us were introverts, never really social in the community, mostly had school friends.

But while I stayed invisible, J bloomed. Everyone knew him. Everyone wanted to talk to him. And while it did sting a little, I didn’t think much of it.

That’s when I noticed two girls in the group — A and F.
A is… honestly the biggest pick-me girl I’ve ever encountered. I’m not saying this out of jealousy. She literally brags about only having guy friends, thrives on attention, and has a long track record of “being friendly” with almost every guy in our group. She’s always hated me — and the moment I got slightly included, she worked extra hard to make me feel unwelcome. She did everything she could to isolate me.

F is slightly better. She’s been nice to me sometimes, so I’ll give her that. But she’s also the same kind of “cool girl” archetype who slides in just enough to stay popular without ever being genuine.

What hurt the most was J — the one guy I thought was different — got *very* close to A and F. Weirdly close. All while telling me “they’re like sisters to me.” I didn’t buy it, but I stayed quiet. I wanted him to be my best friend more than anything. But it felt like he kept getting promoted socially while I was still on the outside looking in.

Then one day, he asked me out.

Let's be blunt. You are the most perfectly managed subject in the modern world, and the funniest part is, you think it’s a virtue. You bust your gut for 60 hours a week, drown in debt for a concrete box you call a home, and then swell with pride when some foreign publication calls your city ""competitive.""

Competitive? You're not competing. You're the prize pig being fattened up for slaughter. Your entire life is a testament to how successfully a population can be conditioned to celebrate its own castration. You traded your soul for a CPF statement and now you have the audacity to complain that the numbers don’t quite add up.

# Part I: The System You Defend is Laughing at You

You genuinely believe you are part of a grand, successful enterprise. The truth is you are merely a cog in a machine designed to enrich a tiny, untouchable elite and their foreign clients. And you polish that machine every day.

**Pillar 1: You Beg to be a Doormat for Global Capital**

Your national identity is now built on being the most accommodating servant to the world’s rich. It’s pathetic.

* **You Justify Your Own Poverty:** You actually repeat the talking points. ""We have no natural resources."" ""We need foreign investment."" You say this as your wages are driven into the ground by a state-sponsored flood of cheap labor—**nearly 40% of the workforce**—designed to ensure you are always replaceable, always terrified. You see the **1.5 million foreign workers** not as a tool of your oppression, but as a sign of your ""vibrancy.""
* **You Worship at the Altar of ""Singapore-Washing"":** When your Prime Minister says he wants **""another 10 billionaires""** here, you nod along like a good little employee. You watch as laundered money pours into your property market, making your own home a distant dream, and you call it ""capital inflow."" You are cheering on the very forces that are pricing you out of your own country. You have been trained to see your own displacement as a sign of success.

**Pillar 2: You've Been Convinced the Fox is Guarding the Henhouse**

You speak of GIC and Temasek with a hushed reverence, as if their **trillion-dollar** portfolios are your family inheritance. Wake up. That is your money. It is the wealth siphoned from your labor through decades of forced surpluses and endless fees. It’s your retirement, your healthcare, your children’s future, commandeered to play on the global stock market. And you are proud of it.

The ""tripartite"" system is the ultimate insult to your intelligence. The establishment sits on both sides of the table—as the capitalist and the regulator—and you are told this is a ""consensus."" You have been so thoroughly broken that you see your own exclusion from power as a form of good governance.

# Part II: A Snapshot of Your Pathetic, Self-Inflicted Life

Look at your life. Look at the choices you celebrate. They are not signs of wisdom. They are symptoms of a deep-seated psychological Stockholm Syndrome.

* **Your HDB Flat is Your Ball and Chain.** You don’t own a home. You have a 99-year lease on a shoebox that you willingly go into a lifetime of debt for. You obsess over its ""resale value,"" a paper-thin fantasy of wealth that distracts from the crushing reality of your mortgage. You are a debt-serf who thinks he's a property investor because the G, your landlord who owns **90% of the land**, tells you so.
* **The Numbers Have You Pegged as a Loser.** Let’s say it again, slowly. From 2008 to 2023, the *average* wealth here, bloated by foreign oligarchs, soared **116%**. Your wealth, the wealth of the median person, **FELL by 2%**. This isn't a statistic. This is a mugging. An entire generation of ""growth"" was a direct transfer of wealth from you to them. And what is your response? ""I need to upskill."" You are a lamb asking the wolf for tips on how to be more delicious.
* **Your Kiasu Parenting is Just Child Abuse.** You call it ""parenting,"" but it looks more like a ritual of self-flagellation played out on your own children. You have transformed education, the supposed sacred ladder of meritocracy, into a grotesque torture chamber where you are the willing warden. You bleed yourself dry for a **$1.4 billion tuition industry**, a monstrous monument to your collective panic, all to give your child a ""fighting chance"" in a system that the PISA data has already exposed as a sham rigged for the rich. 
* And here is the punchline to this cruel joke: while you brutalize your own child to conquer the Everest of local exams, the system you worship rolls out the red carpet for foreigners waving fake and worthless degrees from paper mills in India and the third world. You enforce an impossible standard on your own flesh and blood, only to watch them be sidelined for someone who simply bought a shortcut. You are not giving them an advantage; you are meticulously preparing them for a race where the rules apply only to them. You are passing on your anxiety, your desperation, and your crippling fear of failure, raising a perfect product for the system: a generation of burnt-out, over-qualified, and ultimately, defeated runners-up. Congratulations on raising your child to be the most well-prepared loser in the room.

# Part III: You Don't Want a Solution. You Want to Complain.

The most contemptible part of it all is your feigned helplessness. You know the system is screwing you. The reports from the **2010 Economic Strategies Committee** and **""Forward SG""** prove that even the establishment knows it's unsustainable. But nothing changes. Why? Because you won't let it.

* **You Can Be Bought for Pennies:** A few hundred dollars in CDC vouchers is all it takes to shut you up. A GST rebate makes you forget they hiked the GST to **9%** in the first place. You are the cheapest date in the world, easily placated with trinkets while your house is being robbed.
* **You Love the Illusion of Being ""Heard"":** You eagerly participate in their ""National Conversations,"" believing your ""feedback"" matters. It's a focus group. You are providing free market research on how to better manage your own discontent before they roll out the next pre-decided policy.
* **You are Terrified of Having a Spine:** The idea of a minimum wage, of real unions, of genuine political opposition—it terrifies you. You have been so conditioned to fear instability that you prefer the certainty of your managed decline. You will whine endlessly over coffee, but the moment you are asked to take a real stand, you will retreat into your shell, citing the need for ""stability.""

You are not a victim. You are an accomplice. You are living the life you have chosen through a million tiny acts of cowardice. The stress, the burnout, the quiet desperation—that is not your tragedy. That is your contribution. And from the outside, it is a truly pathetic spectacle.

This summer I’ve driven from Guangdong to Yunnan and back again. 

When it comes to driving around China I’ve been there and done that and can offer some friendly advice if you like. 

Driving a hybrid to Yunnan was quite interesting. I didn’t need to charge the electric that much but I wanted to especially as it was cheaper than adding gas. 

The charging network was phenomenal, really cool using the fast chargers across the country. Some charging posts were run by Li Auto - I charged up successfully once and then the second time I noticed some bays were a slightly different color and I couldn’t charge - those bays were specifically for Li Auto cars. No problem, move to the any car bays. Some of the charging posts were run by Huawei, I wasn’t expecting that. To get 100km on the electric it cost me about 30 kuai, usually. Gas I could usually drive more like 50/60 kuai for 100km. Motorway tolls add up. About 500rmb for 12 hours of driving, that’s ballpark. 

Getting espresso coffee - forget it save for one or two service stations in Guangdong. Nowadays they’ve started to stock zero-sugar bottled Americanos across the network which are a bit of a god send. 

The roads get emptier as you head west and the scenery slowly gets more beautiful ;)

I am quite aware that no one can answer this question with 100% certainty, but I guess I just need a human to answer me anyhow, and maybe an answer from a priest is the best.

There is a priest with whom I have a very friendly relationship. He is in his 50s, I am in my early 30s, female. We have known each other for almost 15 years. We speak very often, after the Sunday mass, he always invites me for a coffee in the Monastery cafeteria, and I also play the guitar on Tuesday mass, so this is where we also sit and talk. I highly respect him and I love his way of teaching me many things, explaining, or simply sharing. I think I can safely say he is also fond of me. I trust him deeply and he knows almost everything about me.

Now, I confess to him and he always says something in a confession, whether advice, guidance, anything. He personally believes it is important to always say something and he said this himself.

However, this morning I asked him for a confession. I confessed very reckless behavior (getting drunk, riding my bike drunk and wanting to do all that for attention and need to feel something). This is unfortunately a repetitive sin, although this time I confessed I did it on purpose and that I rode bicycle drunk. I don't do it all the time, but yes, from time to time.

And this time, he literally didn't say antything. He just said ""Ok. After confession say one Our Father. Now repent.""

I felt extremely abandoned and hurt and confused and even a bit pathetic. It was like he became so disappointed with me and sick and tired of me that he couldn't even speak. I feel horrible and really upset and anxious. After the mass, he did invite me for coffee as usual, but I thought he was just polite and distant and we didn't talk much because some other people also joined us.

The problem is I cannot ask him why he did this, why he didn't say anything because that is within the confession, right? This hurts me even more because I feel the door is locked and I cannot unlock it and I am so scared and upset about it. Is there anything I can do?

And also, why do you think he reacted this way?",1,1751794877.0,AskAPriest,0,1.0,False

I was shocked, honestly. I had pushed away feelings for so long, thinking he wouldn’t see me that way. We agreed to keep it private for a month, just to make sure things worked before going public.

And then… it began.

Within a week, F (who lives abroad and visits once a year) asked J to hang out *alone*. He told me about it and asked if I wanted to come, but I was pissed. She clearly didn’t want *me* there — just him. So I said no, go ahead. I brushed it off, but I felt uneasy.

Mind you, me, J, A, and F all grew up together. A and F are a year older. And they were *never* this close to J before. Suddenly, it’s late-night video calls between the three of them, group hangouts, flirty stories, and me watching it all unfold through his Snapchat and Instagram.

And while we were dating — he never asked me to hang out publicly. No mall dates. No coffee shop plans. He only wanted to come over to *my house*.
Whenever I asked why we couldn’t go out like normal couples, he’d say “people might see” or “I’m shy.”
But somehow he was never too shy to go out with *them*.

I started making excuses like “my house isn’t empty” just to avoid the situation because I was so uncomfortable.

Then came the moment that broke me.

He sent me a sweet mail from his internship one day. I was happy, thinking it was a thoughtful gesture — until I saw that he had **cc’ed A** in the exact same email.
Same words. Same everything.
I didn’t yell. I just stopped replying. I ignored his texts. We slowly drifted and broke up.

After the breakup, he casually told me that he had already told A and F that we were dating.

That was it. That was the last straw.

I had *one* boundary. *One*. I told him how uncomfortable A made me. How she treated me. And he still went ahead and did the exact thing I begged him not to.
And A? She was *thrilled* when we broke up. She’s the kind of person who’ll have everything in her hands and still try to snatch what someone else has — just because she can.

Right now, there are fewer boys left in our committee group. That’s probably why she clings to J. The minute someone newer or better shows up, she’ll drop him like nothing happened.

No, I don’t think he was dating either of them. But I *do* think he had feelings for one or both. It’s just something my gut tells me. The way he’d act — sending me texts like “me and F took a good pic today” to make me jealous, or A biting his finger in a story — it wasn’t normal “best friend” behavior.

After we broke up, he was suddenly living his best life — hanging out with them all the time. There are 15 people in our committee, and a core 10 of us in the active team. Out of those, 6 hang out together — 4 boys and 2 girls (one being A, who *chooses* the other girl). They exclude me entirely. Even when the rest of us join, they tone it down and leave quickly.

If I’m not there, they’re hanging at each other’s houses, clicking pictures, having the best time.
If I *am* there, it’s stiff. Cold. Polite conversations until they can dip.

And it sucks.

As an introvert, all I ever wanted was to feel like I belonged. Just a few people who cared. A place to laugh and feel safe. And people like A ruin that — not just by what they do, but by convincing others that *you’re* the problem.

This group… it was the only social thread I had. And it’s gone.

I’m not writing this for sympathy.
But what a lot of people don’t know is — my dad has stage 4 cancer. I’m the eldest daughter. I handle a lot. I barely go out. My life is heavy. All I ever wanted was a little peace, some company, some laughter to balance the chaos.

There are days when I look at their pictures and cry myself to sleep.
Nights when I ask God — *Why me?*
Why did I have to lose my place in the one circle I tried to build?

I really really do hope karma is real

I don’t want pity. I just want this *time* in my life to pass.
The loneliness. The betrayal. The fake smiles. The pain of watching people you once loved — laughing without you.

I just hope someday, I find better people. People who value me. People who don’t make me feel like a stranger in my own life.

I (F, 21) and my ex — let’s call him J — have known each other since childhood, but we were never close until college. We both joined the youth committee of our community. It’s a pretty popular group — kind of like the “in-crowd” within our society. Slowly, as people left, a smaller core of us remained. That core eventually became our own little circle.

J became pretty popular after joining the group, especially with the girls. He was already known by the guys, but suddenly he was everyone’s favorite. I had a soft corner for him — not a full-on crush, but I liked how we had similar upbringings. Both of us were introverts, never really social in the community, mostly had school friends.

But while I stayed invisible, J bloomed. Everyone knew him. Everyone wanted to talk to him. And while it did sting a little, I didn’t think much of it.

That’s when I noticed two girls in the group — A and F.
A is… honestly the biggest pick-me girl I’ve ever encountered. I’m not saying this out of jealousy. She literally brags about only having guy friends, thrives on attention, and has a long track record of “being friendly” with almost every guy in our group. She’s always hated me — and the moment I got slightly included, she worked extra hard to make me feel unwelcome. She did everything she could to isolate me.

F is slightly better. She’s been nice to me sometimes, so I’ll give her that. But she’s also the same kind of “cool girl” archetype who slides in just enough to stay popular without ever being genuine.

What hurt the most was J — the one guy I thought was different — got *very* close to A and F. Weirdly close. All while telling me “they’re like sisters to me.” I didn’t buy it, but I stayed quiet. I wanted him to be my best friend more than anything. But it felt like he kept getting promoted socially while I was still on the outside looking in.

Then one day, he asked me out.
I was shocked, honestly. I had pushed away feelings for so long, thinking he wouldn’t see me that way. We agreed to keep it private for a month, just to make sure things worked before going public.

And then… it began.

Within a week, F (who lives abroad and visits once a year) asked J to hang out *alone*. He told me about it and asked if I wanted to come, but I was pissed. She clearly didn’t want *me* there — just him. So I said no, go ahead. I brushed it off, but I felt uneasy.

Mind you, me, J, A, and F all grew up together. A and F are a year older. And they were *never* this close to J before. Suddenly, it’s late-night video calls between the three of them, group hangouts, flirty stories, and me watching it all unfold through his Snapchat and Instagram.

And while we were dating — he never asked me to hang out publicly. No mall dates. No coffee shop plans. He only wanted to come over to *my house*.
Whenever I asked why we couldn’t go out like normal couples, he’d say “people might see” or “I’m shy.”
But somehow he was never too shy to go out with *them*.

I started making excuses like “my house isn’t empty” just to avoid the situation because I was so uncomfortable.

Then came the moment that broke me.

He sent me a sweet mail from his internship one day. I was happy, thinking it was a thoughtful gesture — until I saw that he had **cc’ed A** in the exact same email.
Same words. Same everything.
I didn’t yell. I just stopped replying. I ignored his texts. We slowly drifted and broke up.

After the breakup, he casually told me that he had already told A and F that we were dating.

That was it. That was the last straw.

I had *one* boundary. *One*. I told him how uncomfortable A made me. How she treated me. And he still went ahead and did the exact thing I begged him not to.
And A? She was *thrilled* when we broke up. She’s the kind of person who’ll have everything in her hands and still try to snatch what someone else has — just because she can.

Right now, there are fewer boys left in our committee group. That’s probably why she clings to J. The minute someone newer or better shows up, she’ll drop him like nothing happened.

No, I don’t think he was dating either of them. But I *do* think he had feelings for one or both. It’s just something my gut tells me. The way he’d act — sending me texts like “me and F took a good pic today” to make me jealous, or A biting his finger in a story — it wasn’t normal “best friend” behavior.

After we broke up, he was suddenly living his best life — hanging out with them all the time. There are 15 people in our committee, and a core 10 of us in the active team. Out of those, 6 hang out together — 4 boys and 2 girls (one being A, who *chooses* the other girl). They exclude me entirely. Even when the rest of us join, they tone it down and leave quickly.

If I’m not there, they’re hanging at each other’s houses, clicking pictures, having the best time.
If I *am* there, it’s stiff. Cold. Polite conversations until they can dip.

And it sucks.

As an introvert, all I ever wanted was to feel like I belonged. Just a few people who cared. A place to laugh and feel safe. And people like A ruin that — not just by what they do, but by convincing others that *you’re* the problem.

This group… it was the only social thread I had. And it’s gone.

I’m not writing this for sympathy.
But what a lot of people don’t know is — my dad has stage 4 cancer. I’m the eldest daughter. I handle a lot. I barely go out. My life is heavy. All I ever wanted was a little peace, some company, some laughter to balance the chaos.

There are days when I look at their pictures and cry myself to sleep.
Nights when I ask God — *Why me?*
Why did I have to lose my place in the one circle I tried to build?

I really really do hope karma is real

I don’t want pity. I just want this *time* in my life to pass.
The loneliness. The betrayal. The fake smiles. The pain of watching people you once loved — laughing without you.

I just hope someday, I find better people. People who value me. People who don’t make me feel like a stranger in my own life.

Until then, I’ll just keep going.

2. Megan Markle was unfairly criticized and constantly compared to Princess Kate they are both known to give back (As what royals do) but when Megan tries to, she gets backlash, at one point, when visiting at a children’s hospice, Markle felt “bitter” (at least what a source said). At the end of the day, Markle was still acknowledged for her efforts 🙏🏽

Critics called Anna for being a gold digger bc Marshall was 63 years older than her (Which a lot of people think what a gold digger is, dating someone 40 or 50 years older than u when it’s not) These criticisms similarly let to drug addiction like like Judy (albeit for different reasons). When Anna died in 2007 at just 39, her death was considered the “remake of Marilyn Monroe’s death” as they have very similar stories and struggles 😬 

6. Princess Diana was in a manipulative press (some even called her a “airhead” which is fucked up to me😔.) She finally pointed out in a 1995 interview with the bbc. She even mentioned there were her, Charles and likely Camila in the marriage (Pic: People.com)

7. Rita Hayworth was dubbed “The love goddess” by the press after starring in the 1940 film Gilda. To me, I think the name “Love Goddess” has some negative connotations (at least to Rita considering her ethnicity; she’s Spanish and Romani btw). One of her famous quotes “Men go to bed with Gilda but awaken with me” shows the difference between her onscreen persona and as a real person 😤✊🏽 

8. Meat Loaf the artist was known for his operatic voice and his epic power ballads. When people talk about him he becomes the butt of every joke bc of his name 😔 To me, I don’t think his amazing voice gets talked about enough bc when u look up something like “Singers with High note voices”, Youll see someone like Steven Tyler or Barbra Streisand but not Meat loaf.

Mind you, me, J, A, and F all grew up together. A and F are a year older. And they were *never* this close to J before. Suddenly, it’s late-night video calls between the three of them, group hangouts, flirty stories, and me watching it all unfold through his Snapchat and Instagram.

And while we were dating — he never asked me to hang out publicly. No mall dates. No coffee shop plans. He only wanted to come over to *my house*.
Whenever I asked why we couldn’t go out like normal couples, he’d say “people might see” or “I’m shy.”
But somehow he was never too shy to go out with *them*.

I started making excuses like “my house isn’t empty” just to avoid the situation because I was so uncomfortable.

Then came the moment that broke me.

He sent me a sweet mail from his internship one day. I was happy, thinking it was a thoughtful gesture — until I saw that he had **cc’ed A** in the exact same email.
Same words. Same everything.
I didn’t yell. I just stopped replying. I ignored his texts. We slowly drifted and broke up.

After the breakup, he casually told me that he had already told A and F that we were dating.

That was it. That was the last straw.

I had *one* boundary. *One*. I told him how uncomfortable A made me. How she treated me. And he still went ahead and did the exact thing I begged him not to.
And A? She was *thrilled* when we broke up. She’s the kind of person who’ll have everything in her hands and still try to snatch what someone else has — just because she can.

Right now, there are fewer boys left in our committee group. That’s probably why she clings to J. The minute someone newer or better shows up, she’ll drop him like nothing happened.

No, I don’t think he was dating either of them. But I *do* think he had feelings for one or both. It’s just something my gut tells me. The way he’d act — sending me texts like “me and F took a good pic today” to make me jealous, or A biting his finger in a story — it wasn’t normal “best friend” behavior.

After we broke up, he was suddenly living his best life — hanging out with them all the time. There are 15 people in our committee, and a core 10 of us in the active team. Out of those, 6 hang out together — 4 boys and 2 girls (one being A, who *chooses* the other girl). They exclude me entirely. Even when the rest of us join, they tone it down and leave quickly.

If I’m not there, they’re hanging at each other’s houses, clicking pictures, having the best time.
If I *am* there, it’s stiff. Cold. Polite conversations until they can dip.

And it sucks.

As an introvert, all I ever wanted was to feel like I belonged. Just a few people who cared. A place to laugh and feel safe. And people like A ruin that — not just by what they do, but by convincing others that *you’re* the problem.

I (F, 21) and my ex — let’s call him J — have known each other since childhood, but we were never close until college. We both joined the youth committee of our community. It’s a pretty popular group — kind of like the “in-crowd” within our society. Slowly, as people left, a smaller core of us remained. That core eventually became our own little circle.

J became pretty popular after joining the group, especially with the girls. He was already known by the guys, but suddenly he was everyone’s favorite. I had a soft corner for him — not a full-on crush, but I liked how we had similar upbringings. Both of us were introverts, never really social in the community, mostly had school friends.

But while I stayed invisible, J bloomed. Everyone knew him. Everyone wanted to talk to him. And while it did sting a little, I didn’t think much of it.

That’s when I noticed two girls in the group — A and F.
A is… honestly the biggest pick-me girl I’ve ever encountered. I’m not saying this out of jealousy. She literally brags about only having guy friends, thrives on attention, and has a long track record of “being friendly” with almost every guy in our group. She’s always hated me — and the moment I got slightly included, she worked extra hard to make me feel unwelcome. She did everything she could to isolate me.

F is slightly better. She’s been nice to me sometimes, so I’ll give her that. But she’s also the same kind of “cool girl” archetype who slides in just enough to stay popular without ever being genuine.

What hurt the most was J — the one guy I thought was different — got *very* close to A and F. Weirdly close. All while telling me “they’re like sisters to me.” I didn’t buy it, but I stayed quiet. I wanted him to be my best friend more than anything. But it felt like he kept getting promoted socially while I was still on the outside looking in.

Then one day, he asked me out.
I was shocked, honestly. I had pushed away feelings for so long, thinking he wouldn’t see me that way. We agreed to keep it private for a month, just to make sure things worked before going public.

And then… it began.

It sounds insane and it isn't nearly optimal but I'd really like for it to work.

It wouldn't be just espresso drinks, some cold brew and pourovers as well, but i'd imagine most people prefer espresso-based drinks (like lattes) and was curious if this can be possible. 

We wanted to provide coffee and use beans from a company that does fair trade processes and gives back to the farmers, and promote as well as showcase how coffee trades are in the world right now.

The month this occurs is a bit hot, and i'd imagine that most guests would choose ice over hot. Maybe if I, though it wouldn't taste nearly as good as fresh, make espresso beforehand it'd be manageable?

*“It’s hard to explain how someone can ruin your sense of safety without ever touching you. She smiles, she chats, she never raises her voice. But every time I turn around, she’s there—always too close, always pretending like it’s nothing.”*

**Jan, 2025**

It all started with my first job.

I was a normal guy, who studied in a boys’ school and never batted an eye towards a girl in the college. Never knew what that connection felt like. Then i got a job in this company, where we had a bunch of hires from the same college. I thought, I have never socialized before, this is a good opportunity to get on with like-minded people. And we barely had any work at the beginning, so we all got on pretty well.

It started small. A casual “hi” in the pantry. Asking me if I knew how to do some thing. Laughing at a joke I didn’t even realize I made. At first, I thought maybe she was just friendly. The kind of outgoing person who makes you feel seen in a room full of strangers. It felt... good. New. A little exciting, even.

Then it started getting weird.

She’d always be near. Not just around — ***near***. Desk moved a little closer. Started showing up early and leaving late, just like me. She'd ask what I was working on. Always smiling. Never anything you could report. Everyone else thought we were a thing. Trust me, we were not. It was just platonic.

Sometimes she’d get very angry on the things that she disagrees about. Same with everyone else, but she only listened to me. And I felt powerful. Eventually, due to her character. Everyone else stopped talking to her, except me. I was so dumb I didn’t know the signs (red flags, I could say), and with no one else in the way, we were getting closer and closer.

**Feb, 2025**

She called me daily, and we used to talk about everything and nothing for hours till late nights. And even in the early mornings. At this point, I saw her as just a good friend. My first female friend, who cared about me at times, won’t go out without me, always insisted i must come, be it lunch, or just a walk across the street.

**Mar,2025**

She was easy to talk to — smart, funny in a dry way, and somehow always seemed to *get* what I was saying, even when I fumbled through it. I liked that. We’d share memes, talk about how clueless our team leads were, grab coffee during breaks. For a while, it was one of the few bright spots in a stressful new job.

I didn’t expect to feel that kind of connection with anyone, let alone someone like her.

It wasn’t romantic. Not for me, at least. I don’t think it was for her either. It just felt... comfortable. Like she had my back. Like she saw me in a way others didn’t.

But slowly, it changed.

She started getting possessive in small, quiet ways. She’d get annoyed if I made plans without telling her. Once, I mentioned going for lunch with a guy from another team, and she said, “Wow, guess I’m being replaced.” And it didn’t sound like a joke.

I shrugged it off. We were close friends. Friends tease each other, right?

That’s what I kept telling myself.

But the comments that we were a thing were increasing, not just coworkers, even my actual friends. A few joked about it early on, back when we used to hang out more. “You two are always together.” “When’s the wedding?” Stuff like that. I laughed it off at first, but it kept coming up.

One friend even said, “Come on, man. Don’t play dumb — she *clearly* likes you. Go make some moves!”

I got used to it until we both were tired of it, and seriously confronted our friends, like it is getting out of hand and they should stop it. And they did, to some extent. But there was a change of tone in our daily calls, she was getting worried about us (and our friendship), I told her there’s nothing like that and I’d never think of her like that. She would always gaslight me saying we are best friends and stuff. And i brought it up. She was dead silent.

**Apr, 2025**

At this time, her character was worsening and i was too dumb to notice all that. I just wanted to talk to my friend. Before all this, we used to casually chat, sitting in parks alone at night, talking about random things. She suddenly stopped doing all this, even when i would call her, she wouldn’t come out, giving me all kinds of excuses. I reassured her, telling her she can talk to me about anything and that we were best friends and all that.

I didn’t notice it at first, but somewhere in the middle of all that silence, I started waiting for her texts. Checking if she’d come online. Wondering if I had said something wrong. Every time my phone buzzed, I’d hope it was her. But it rarely was. The calls stopped completely. She barely replied to messages — and when she did, it was short, cold. Like she was a different person. And it messed with my head.

I tried to play it cool. Tried to pretend I didn’t care. But I did. Way more than I should’ve. She wasn’t just my friend anymore — she had become part of my routine, my day, my peace. When i woke up, i thought about her (first thought) and I started losing my sleep. And now, she was just... gone. No warning, no fight, no reason. And I couldn’t stop thinking about it. About *her*. It was like something was unfinished.

I started reaching out more. Calling. Messaging. Asking if everything was okay. I’d write out long paragraphs, then delete them. Rewrite them. Sometimes I’d just send a simple “Hey.” Nothing back. That’s when it hit me — I was lowkey obsessed. Not in a romantic way, not even in a “want her back” kind of way. I just needed closure. Something. Anything to explain the switch. Because it felt like emotional whiplash.

So I stopped. I told myself, if she wanted to talk, she would. I stopped messaging her, stopped calling. Took her off my close friends list, archived our chats, muted her stories. Out of sight, out of mind — or at least, that was the plan. She did call sometimes, but that was like a pity call, just for the sake of it. I showed how worried I am but she didn’t express anything. Finally, I *blocked* her.

**May, 2025**

It was like, at this point, she didn’t care who I was, like she didn’t know me. So I did the same. I pretended like I didn’t know who she was and, even if we were in the same room, we had no contact whatsoever.

Again, whenever we cross paths in work, she suddenly started saying like “Miss the old days” or “Hope you’re okay” — stuff that sounded sweet on the surface but just reopened the wounds I was trying to close.

Once, she left a note on my desk at work — something small, just an inside joke — and smiled at me like nothing ever happened. And I was back in square one, confused, thrown off, questioning everything.

But I didn’t engage.

I ignored the messages. I stopped meeting her gaze. I walked the other way if I saw her in the hallway. It felt dramatic, but it was necessary. I had to pull myself out of whatever twisted loop we were in.

There were days — hell, *weeks* — when I missed her so much it felt physical. Not in the cliché romantic way. It wasn’t about love or heartbreak. It was something stranger, harder to name. Like my brain had gotten wired to her presence, and now that she was gone, everything felt... off.

I’d reach for my phone out of habit, only to remember there was nothing new from her. No late-night meme dump. No “you up?” messages at 2AM. Just silence.

It was like withdrawal. That dull ache in the background of my day. I’d be in a meeting, nodding along, but my mind would flash to something we once joked about. A shared look. A dumb pun. A memory no one else would understand.

Music became dangerous. Certain songs would hit like a punch to the gut. The ones we used to send each other with no context, just vibes. I stopped listening to entire playlists because they felt like letters to a ghost. I started crying whenever I listen to some tracks.

I missed the way she *got* me. The way I didn’t have to explain myself, and she’d just nod like she already knew where I was going with it. I missed the weird comfort of knowing someone always had something to say, even if it was just to call me out on my crap.

And I hated that I missed her.

Because I knew how unhealthy it had become. I started drinking. I knew she wasn’t good for me, not anymore. But knowing didn’t stop the ache. The body doesn’t care if a habit is toxic. It just craves what it’s used to.

And I was used to her.

My friends tried to bring me out of it, and they thought I was in a relationship with her. Why else would I hurt this much? Hell, she wasn’t even my type, not even 1%.

But slowly, I started moving past it.

Not in a big, dramatic way — no grand epiphany, no “one day it just stopped hurting” moment. It was quieter than that. Subtle. Like realizing one morning that I hadn’t thought about her the first thing when I woke up. That was a big win in my book!

I started focusing on myself. Actually *focusing*. Picking up the hobbies I’d forgotten. Spending time with people who didn’t drain me. Having conversations that didn’t leave me second-guessing everything I said. It was uncomfortable at first, trying to fill the space she’d left behind. But over time, that space stopped feeling like a void and started feeling like *room* — room to breathe, to grow, to exist without feeling watched or needed in ways that weren’t fair.

There were still setbacks. Some nights I’d catch myself rereading old messages, or hovering over the unblock button. But I didn’t press it. I reminded myself that missing someone doesn’t mean you belong with them. That comfort isn’t always safety. And that silence, however painful, is sometimes the kindest boundary you can give yourself.

Healing didn’t mean I stopped caring. It meant I stopped *chasing*. I’m still healing. Some memories still sting. But now, I choose peace over patterns. And for the first time in a long time, I finally felt like I’m mine again.

**Jun, 2025 till date**

I keep going, day after day, buried in work and trying to build a life that isn’t defined by her. I tell myself I’m done with the chaos, that I’ve moved on. And for the most part, I have.

But she’s still there. Still keeps watching me at work, daily.

Watching my social media through fake accounts. Showing up where I least expect it. Once, she even confronted me—face-to-face, out of the blue—demanding I unblock her, wanting me to talk to her like we used to. She said she missed me like nothing else, like she wanted me back.

In reply, I have nothing to say. What is there to talk about? The past is tangled and broken, and I’m not sure there’s any conversation left that doesn’t pull me back into that mess.

I don’t know what she feels exactly. If it’s love, obsession, or something I can’t put a name to. And honestly, I don’t know if I want to find out.

I’m caught between wanting to close the door completely and the strange pull of those old memories — the comfort, the familiarity, the mess. So I keep my distance. I keep my guard up. Because sometimes, survival means choosing the silence over the noise.

I still wonder sometimes — why is she like this? What drives someone to hold on so tightly, even when it hurts both people? Does she have feelings for me? Is it love, loneliness, obsession, or something else I’ll never fully understand?

I don’t have the answers. Maybe I never will.

But writing this down, sharing it, feels like a step forward. A way to make sense of the chaos and reclaim my story.

Thank you for bearing with me through this long post. It means more than I can say to have someone listen.

  
**TLDR**  
I got close to a female coworker at my first job. What started as friendship turned into emotional manipulation, possessiveness, and unhealthy dependence. When she suddenly pulled away, I was left confused and mentally drained. I blocked her and started healing, but she still watches me, shows up unexpectedly, and tries to reinsert herself into my life.

I’ve chosen distance and peace, but part of me is still affected by it all.  
**How do you deal with someone who won’t let go, even when you’ve walked away?**

I met my best friend in 8th grade. We're in our mid 30s now. Our friendship over the years has been carried equally we both were always there for one another. My friend is a mom as am I, but she had more kids. I have 2, she now has 5. She has a busy life beacuse of them I know this, which is why our friendship went from going on friend dates and coffee nights to her never coming to my house and instead me only going to hers and always coffee in hand. Our conversations for the last 2 yrs I could barley get a word in edgewise with her. Literally she would interrupt me taking a deep breath. The last conversation we had, she brought up something very negative when I was in a really good mood and I ask her if we could change the subject, she just alittle upset it seemed like. That was the last time we spoke, 1 yr ago. She hasnt responded to my texts or phone calls. Her family says everything is ok and she hasn't mentioned to them why. She has ghosted me. Should I go knock on her door? Is that what shes waiting for? Am I an asshole for not having had done that already? I just dont feel like i should have to force her into making contact. Idk.

1lswzcz,https://www.reddit.com/r/bollywood/comments/1lswzcz/brahmastra_rewrite_part_2_the_astras/,Brahmastra Rewrite part 2 _ The Astras.,"Continuing from the part one we dive straight in. 

Isha and Shiva are able to get away from the city out to a hotel along the highway. They get in the room, lock the door and sit. 

No one has a word to say. Their world flipped upside down. Then Isha asks Shiva how he made the fireball. 

He tells Isha he has been able to do that since he was 14. Isha feels betrayed, kept in the dark. But Shiva holds her. He tells her that he shouldn't have hid this for so long. He never thought people would come after him. Now he is scared and confused. He needs Isha. 

He asks her if she will run away with him. Somewhere away from all this. Somewhere remote. 

Isha reminds him about Srk's sacrifice by holding up his locket. How he left the hope to Shiva. He can't run, his family is somehow involved in this and innocent people are dying. If they run, more will die. Mohan (srk) ran and in the end, people behind him were the ones who died first. 

Note - I kept Shiva's character consistent as he didn't want to help at first either. But instead of guruji blackmailing Shiva into joining Brahmansh, Isha is Shiva's moral guide. So she has a bigger effect on the plot. 

Shiva checks the news to see what happened. The fire fighters are still cooling down the area and the attackers ran away before police got there. They are at lose but their faces are now public as they got tagged by cameras when following Mohan. 

We cut to Junoon. She and her goons are sneaking out through a rural pathway to avoid police. 

While under normal conditions Junoon would just kill her way through the police, she is weakened and needs to get to Dev. But she did send Raftaar with Vanarastra to find Shiva. 

Shiva decides to leave for Varanasi. They get tickets for the Train and start moving. 

Raftaar uses a bike to drive around the entire area of the highway and checks his Vanarastra for Shiva as he is told by Junoon. After finding them he hides the Vanarastra in his bike (so Shiva doesn't sense him when they get close) and follows them to the Train station. 

He strikes up a conversation with Shiva who is buying snacks for them to eat as they had to run away empty stomach. 

He comes off as friendly, eventually asking them for a favour to hold the ticket line place behind them for him because he has to go to the washroom. This is all just a ploy to see what ticket they buy. 

He gets a ticket for Varanasi too but a later train so he can get the Vanarastra with him while altering Junoon. 

Next Day, 2 PM. 

Junoon finally reaches Dev's statue. She tells him that she will need more power for the mission. She says that if Vanarastra could damage her then she cannot fight Guruji and Brahmansh with only this much. 

Dev responds. Everything shakes. Junoon is lifted in the air. Lightning tears into her. She screams in pain. We cut to a wide shot of the island with Junoon's screams in the background. 

Next day. 

Shiva reaches Varanasi with Isha. Now he has to find Manish Shetty. But among this many people ? It would be impossible.

Isha pulls out her phone and checks internet for any profiles with Manish Shetty with Varansi as the location. 
(No Kesaria, it makes no sense they are being hunted they need to hurry) 

They keep walking along the road and a BMW pulls up on the side. Inside there is a man, he asks them the way. The way to Dr Mohan's house.

They understand who he is and ask him. He tells them to hurry and get in. 
(translate in your mind)

Manish - I saw the news about the bomb blast in Mumbai. Mohan is dead isn't he. Damn it, I told him to keep running. 

Shiva - He did sir. But he felt guilty, and in the end he decided to die fighting. 

Manish - I know, he was a great man. A good friend. 

Isha - How did you know where to find us.

Manish - I sensed a Astra. Mohan knew I would be able to sense you the moment you stepped in Varanasi. Nandiastra's senses are second to only Vanarastra.

Manish takes them to his safe house. But like he said, Nandiastra's senses are indeed only second to Vanarastra. So Raftaar for far away was following Shiva and Nandiastra to the safehouse. 

Manish calls Guruji. Asks him what to do next. Guruji tells Manish to train Shiva. It is his destiny. Manish obliges. 

He sits down with Isha and Shiva. Giving them coffee. 

""Now is about time you learn about this world. Our world."" 

""Astras are weapons given to us by gods. Thousands of years ago, great sages meditated in the Himalayas to recieve this boon""

"" Not for themselves. But for humanity. During their time, demons held too much power. They were undefeatable to mortal weapons. So rose the need for humans to wield weapons of magic""

"" For thousands of years Brahmansh kept the world safe. And we still do. But this new threat we face wants to turn our biggest weapon against us, The Brahmastra. ""

What is the brahmastra ? Shiva asks. 

"" Brahmastra is the power source of all Astras. If wielded correctly it can control every astra. But in wrong hands ? Total annihilation. ""

So where is it then ? Isha asks.

"" You are holding it. Give me the locket. This locket was his idea. Rhkat Brahm. A spell anyone can use. Illusion tied to blood. His locket tied to mine, a mine his""

He pulls out his locket and rubs the cloth with Mohan's blood on the locket. Revealing a part of Brahmastra. He puts his blood on Mohan's locket. Revealing a second part. 

He explains to Shiva that it was broken into three pieces in a fight that happened before he joined brahmansh.

Shiva asks him if anyone in Brahmansh uses fire. Manish tells him that the one who did, died decades ago. No one talks about him. No one even takes his name. 

Dev. 

"" Shiva. I can train you to fight. But every Astra is different. You will have to discover Agni Astra yourself. ""

Shiva trains with Manish for 2 days. Learning better control as well as physical combat. 

On the third day it starts raining hard. As Isha was enjoying the rain. A massive circle wall of ice forms around the house. 

It is Junoon. She didn't do it. She summoned Dev. This is to trap Manish. If they got close before trapping them, then they would run away as Manish would sense them from far away. 

Junoon melts a hole in the wall. She tells them to give up the Brahmastra to Manish. 

But Manish laughs. Isha and Shiva left at night. Junoon calls it a bluff as they were staying out of Nandiastra's range. 

Manish tells them he didn't sense them. Shiva did. After training for two days, he gained focus. He can't sense other astra as far as Nandiastra but he can sense Agniastra. Because he is Agniastra. 

Junoon tells him no matter. She already knows where they are headed. She will take the fight right to Brahmansh. 

Note : Junoon already knows where Brahmansh is. She never attacked it because Guruji was too powerful for her weak ass. But now she has been amped to max by Daddy Dev. 

Junoon tells Manish 

""Save me the trouble, kill yourself. You don't stand a chance at even slowing me down""

Manish pulls out a bomb remote and blows up the house. 

""That won't be able to hurt me."" Said Junoon 

Manish - 

""I know. I didn't come to Varanasi for vacation you know. I will die first. Let's see if you make it out in one piece""

Just then the ground shatters, pitch black smoke comes out and morphs into a giant dark silhouette. 

Manish came to Varanasi for a case of black magic summoning gone wrong which tore a hole to hell. He had sealed the place until someone strong from Brahmansh could come to slay the demon. 

The mist immediately vaporizes Manish, Raftaar grabs Zor and runs out telling Junoon that they need to follow Shiva and this is just a stalling tactic by Manish. 

Junoon shielded herself with Kavachastra. She is about walk away but then, the demon speaks.

""I sense you, Dev was it."" Junoon stops. 

"" I heard so much about you. The human who slayed the most demons in the history of mankind. Agnidev. But I find you hiding in this woman's vessels.""

"" Not another word "" Junoon finally speaks. 
"" You have sinned. Sinned by insulting him. Brahmansh can wait. I will slay you first. Zor, Raftaar. Follow Shiva.""

Zor and Raftaar leave. 

"" Ahahaha YOU ? With your borrowed power ? We shall see, Human "" said the Demon. 

And thus Junoon summons fire, water and kavach astra. The demons summons a flaming sword with pitch black smoke pouring out killing the grass and trees it flows through. They face off. 

Anddd Interval.

Note - 

Now if you are wondering why Junoon is getting so much spot light. It's because a good villain elevates the story. No I am not going to show junoon fighting the demon, it's offscreen for 2 reasons 

1. I want to introduce demons but still keep them mysterious. 

2. I am still talking the screen time and budget into account. 

As for Manish going the I lose, so you all do too route. Well I already gave the epic last stand to SRK. And he does this in the movie too by pushing the truck into the valley in. The attempt to take them out with him. So iI character. 

As for him investing a Demonic case. Yes that's very important. The movie never told us what Brahmansh even does. This gives you the idea that Brahmansh is a active working organization that keeps supernatural threats under check. 

As for Junoon. So one rule of my rewrite was that the cast stays the same (except one, you will know in pt3) so how do I make a good villain that works the best with 10/10 baddie like Moni Roy? 

Make her a total evil badass. Dommy mommy as they say on internet. She does get pissed when Dev is insulted which adds to her worship of him. 

Well how was the second part of this rewrite. I wrote this one a bit more detailed and not just jumping scene to scene. ",0,1751793342.0,bollywood,1,0.5,False

1lswv8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/1lswv8b/sharing_some_things_that_have_been_working_for_me/,Sharing some things that have been working for me lately,"I have burnt out both my sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, it decreases my ability to feel. At especially bad times, it's not just a lack of feeling emotions but lack of any physical feeling like pain or pleasure. At a certain point I think the lack of feeling landed me in some pretty deep brain fog, it decreases the need & ability to think. Although it doesn't seem to make much sense, brain fog has caused me deep over thinking and thought spirals & repetitions. These constant negative thoughts reinforced my view of them, I was always finding ways to prove the negative beliefs because it was the only thing I was able to recognize. Not being able to think things through properly meant over-thinking. Over-thinking meant further disconnection from myself and my life, and resulted in heavier brain fog. I experience brain fog as the loss of time, slowed critical and analytical thinking, lack of working memory (forgetting siblings and best friends names), lack of spatial awareness, inability to recognize bodily needs (like water, food, having to pee), social withdrawal, physical slowness in movement, and moments where I am so far from the present that when I am pulled back into it I can't process what is happening, where I am and who I'm with and struggle to even speak. 

I would have regular brain fog and these deeper spells of it for 6-7 years, but this last year these things have changed in many ways. 

I have swelled in my sleep my entire life, even as a baby, and it was just a normal thing for me. About a year ago it suddenly got a lot worse, I was swelling so badly in my sleep that I would wake up choking on my tongue, and bruised around my joints and eyes. I tried a few things to change this but cutting out gluten completely proved to be a solve. I haven't swelled in my sleep since, I am less puffy in general, I don't feel slow or sick after eating anymore, and my brain fog lifted a noticeable amount. 

I was still struggling a lot with my mental health at this point, I was getting really bad lows, and I ended up in the psych ward for a week. Here they switched me from bipolar meds to Wellbutrin, and my mood improved and tasks were easier to start. A month after that I found out my root canal I had gotten was botched and went into my bone and was infected. They needed to remove it immediately because they said I could get a blood infection and theres a possibility it could already have caused some blood poisoning or brain damage. I had it fully pulled out and immediately, I MEAN IMMEDIATELY as it was out of my mouth I felt a sense of relief that came from years of built up pain I hadn't been able to place. There was a pressure in my head that I had gotten used to that was suddenly gone and this certainly helped decrease brain fog. 

I had been going to therapy for about a year and a half and never really made any progress, it was all about damage control and getting through days. After getting meds that helped and getting relief from physical ailments, I was starting to think more clearly, and I had a break through in therapy. We finally made progress and started to move forward through things. Talking about the stuff I had never spoken about before, not withholding anything from my therapist helped majorly with the brain fog. My head was less full of daunting stuff, and speaking about it placed it in a time where I was no longer threatened by it. 

I have been fortunate enough to have access to a great massage therapist for my chronic back pain, a nice GP, a clinical counsellor, out-patient services, and get to attend a beautiful university where I can mentally engage with content that I am deeply interested in. My work is also highly social and in the arts so every shift is new and engaging. I have great friends that I can confide in and be silly with and present myself honestly to. I was able to go no contact with abusers and have the decision making power over my life as an adult now to not remove myself from harmful environments and people. All these privileges allow me to have parts of my life that I want to be engaged with, which makes the brain fog less of a survival tool for getting through trauma and more preventative of joy and fulfillment. And yes, the brain fog is very much still there. I think that my experience has programmed my brain to be like this and now I must make the effort to re-program it. 

I'm not sure how ""healthy"" my solution to this is, or how long it will work for, but my therapist doesn't seem to take issue with it. Which is this:

Adrenaline mixed with a clear task = mental focus. Sustaining this mental focus after the task is complete by immediately moving onto something engaging allows you to stay fully engaged in that next thing longer. At first it doesn't last very long, and the adrenaline might not be felt as much. But the more you practice the better you get. 

Example: I got a big empty flour barrel from behind a bakery (i asked if I could take it), I fill it with ice and hose water and sit in it and try to hold my face under the water for a full minute. This produces adrenaline, and to complete this task you must focus on your breathing and your body and regulation. Then I would grab a towel and dry off and then start on an assignment, or start writing in my journal. Sometimes if I can't be bothered to get ice or don't have it I just turn the shower to full cold and stand in there for a while, which can do the job sometimes. This process has shown an increase in my grades, my friends have told me I seemed more ""there"" and that they could really see me again, and my journalling has changed from the same repeating negative beliefs to changes in perspective and the way I associate my experience with my environment. 

Just adrenaline without a task can be nice to feel something for a moment, but it doesn't last. It's also a drug, and the more that you use it to take the edge off the less effective it is and the more harm you do to yourself trying to achieve it. I'll stay away from the darker side of my experience in this, but on a road-trip once my friends saw a sign for bungee jumping and jokingly suggested I do it. I said okay, walked up to the edge of the bridge tied in and jumped far without any hesitation or any reaction and I felt nothing and was completely unfazed. Also with tattoos, or just amusement park rides or whatever I just felt nothing because I wasn't engaging my mind in the process. 

It really didn't work well at the beginning. I took a cold plunge and got out because I noticed I was turning blue, but I never started shivering. So please be careful if you try something like this, maybe do it with friends so you're forced to be more mentally engaged. Just look out for yourself. 

Alongside these nervous system ""resets"" there are daily practices/habits I work on. I find that however I'm engaging in the first hour or two of being awake is generally the mode my mind and body wants to stay in for the rest of the day. If I wake up and look at my phone, or do something that is very passive and mind numbing, then all tasks in that day tend to be harder to find motivation for. On the opposite side, if I wake up and take my Wellbutrin, hit my vape, and have a coffee or energy drink, then my brain moves very quickly - which requires me to have more nicotine and energy drinks to maintain a working brain, otherwise I crash out badly and can get really low. I actually did a little record keeping and when I vaped in the first two hours of waking up my nicotine use tripled what it was when I waited to vape until I had gotten moving and started on my daily tasks. I must also separate my days, I need to do something outside every day to expand my world, and I have morning and evening practices (just little ones) that bookend my days so that they are more recognizable in chunks. This helps with the time and productivity thing - it also just makes me feel more like a living being. 

I still get brain fog, some days I cannot complete any tasks and other days I will complete an inhuman amount of them. Sometimes I can't remember ever feeling good or what I'm working towards or why I do things, and others I can really feel the beauty of the world and the energy of my friends and the wisdom of my body and the wisdom of others. It is a bumpy road but it is going somewhere, and I do feel far from the end, I have no idea what will come next - could be a cliff - but as for now I can say that thanks to these things there has been improvement.

I have done a lot of nothing much today. I’ve written random thoughts so.. I guess here? 

-

I can’t wait for autumnal days/evenings with him. Rainy, cold weather outside. Warm, heater on inside. Make a bed on the sofa with blankets and pillows. Freshly showered and in pyjamas. Snacks or pizza or something for dinner. I could bake for us earlier, maybe some brownies or something. We can watch HP because that’s autumnal to me, or just anything. Just being cosy and cuddling and kissing and together with no external distractions like our phones or other people. Just me and my honey and our little evening together. That is my *dream*. 

I think my dream is to work fully remotely, three days a week. Maybe even as a contractor so I can take breaks if I want. And in this dream life I can easily afford that. I would live in the country,  but not too far out. I would have a gorgeous little home with Andy, we would also have two dogs and possibly a cat in our family. We would have a garden we could sit in in the morning and have a coffee and chat. I’d have patches in the garden I could try growing vegetables and herbs. We’d have a handful of fruit trees. We would also have a dedicated patch for the insects - an absolute nirvana for the bees. We would live somewhere beautiful. We would have a fireplace for the winter, and only a short drive from a gorgeous water hole for the summer. We’d have a spare room or two for our family and friends to come and stay for a weekend. I’d have friends to come and stay. It would be a long, slow life in the very best kind of way. 

- 

So evidently I am missing him. I also woke up and daydreamed about making him feel SO good and SO relaxed - I’m talking setting up a candle lit shower for him and then him coming out to his bedroom where I’ve set up little candles around the place and the lights are heavily dimmed and I’ve laid a linen sheet on his bed and ask him to lay on it and proceed to give him a massage and little kisses and he has a lightly weighted eye mask on for peak relaxation and I think it’s fun to just focus on feeling the touches not seeing them annnnnd finish with a long, slow bj - still with his eye mask on so it’s a surprise - and finish with a light last little massage and then a cuddle :) I thought about that longer than I’d care to admit. I think about ways to make him feel good and happy a lot, like my forever fantasy about him having a rough day and making his favourite dinner etc etc. Or waking him up on random days with a bj. So in short I actually fantasise a *lot* about going down on him… hm. Well whatever I also think about non sexual things like making him a coffee when he wakes up or cooking/baking him things he loves and when he’s having an unwell spell doing his laundry and keeping our bedroom and living areas nice and clean and tidy for him so he doesn’t even have to think about chores. I just ACHE to be a wife to him. Is that bad? I don’t think so. I don’t even want to necessarily ever be married and I most certainly do *not* want a relationship where I am forced to take care of my partner because he’s a useless overgrown child but I think I fantasise about it with Andy because I know he isn’t that sort of a man, and I know he will take care of me in turn, yknow. I just love him so much and so deeply and I just want more than anything to make his life good. Okay shush. 

I’m going to go to the office tomorrow. I have a couple meetings here in the morning because idk it’s just easier and then I’ll head in around mid morning. Yay me. Which I guess means no leaving early, but that’s okay. I just like to leave a bit earlier or a bit later so I can avoid peak public transport rush. 

My hair is so soft and so shiny. I used a gloss on it this morning, just the chroma absolu one which has been sat in my bathroom cupboard for MONTHHHSSSSSS unopened. Potentially a year. Idk why I haven’t used it. I hate the smell of it, but the results are really quite lovely. 

So I guess my period is… over? It barely even started/existed though so is over the correct word? Unsure. I wish I had gone to mum & dads, I didn’t go because I prefer to just be home when I have my period if I can be, I just feel comfier. I guess I’ll go up next weekend :) 

I had the best avocado on toast earlier today. Perfect avocado, I’m talking a blessed avocado, and delicious sourdough and my Manuka chilli salt and YUM. I’ve watched Gilmore Girls again much of the day, I’ve just felt so tired. 

Okay well it’s 9:22pm now soooo night night 

P.S I still feel quite flat and not great but I definitely feel better today :)

1lswuk7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futuresmove/comments/1lswuk7/what_100_can_still_do_and_why_it_matters_for/,🌍 What $100 can still do (and why it matters for trading),"



Just for fun, here’s what $100 can buy around the world:



✅ \*\*New Delhi:\*\*

\- Prawn curry – $15

\- One night in a hotel – $20

\- McDonald’s meal – $5



✅ \*\*Lagos:\*\*

\- Famous jollof rice – $11

\- Beer – $1.05

\- Local transport (petita) – $0.85



✅ \*\*Brazil:\*\*

\- Fresh coconut – $0.50

\- Premium sandwich – $4.50

\- Coffee – very cheap



✅ \*\*Cape Town:\*\*

\- $10 gets you a huge Gatsby sandwich you can share



\> \*\*Point:\*\* $100 still has real value. So why wait forever to save up a bigger amount before you start trading?



\---

 💸 Can you really turn $100 into $1000?



Yes — but there are two very different ways to do it:



⚡ \*\*The gambling way (not recommended):\*\*

\- Use very high leverage (like 50x)

\- Hope the market moves in your favor

\- Usually ends in getting liquidated and losing your money



🧠 \*\*The strategic way (recommended):\*\*

\- Grow slowly and consistently

\- Use lower leverage

\- Choose your coins carefully

\- Focus on small profits that add up over time



\---



\## 📊 Step by step: the strategic way



\### ✅ 1. Choose your coins carefully



When starting with $100, it makes sense to look at small-cap coins — but avoid meme coins.



What to look for:

\- Coins that are at least 2 years old

\- No celebrity-driven hype

\- Show clear price cycles (follow the broader crypto market)

\- Have a real use case or utility



\> \*Example: Jasmy\*  

\> ⚠️ This is not financial advice — always do your own research.



\*\*Why focus on small-cap?\*\*  

You don’t need huge leverage to see meaningful gains.



| Coin   | Price      | Typical leverage needed |

|-------|-----------:|------------------------:|

| Jasmy | $0.000012  | Works well even at 5–10x |

| Monero| $200       | Needs much higher leverage to see gains |



\---



🛠 2. How to actually trade with $100



✅ Use \*\*limit orders\*\* so you pay lower fees  

✅ Trade on higher timeframes (like 15min, 1h, or even 4h) to avoid market noise  

✅ Use trailing stops to protect profits  

✅ Be patient and disciplined with your entries and exits — no FOMO



\---



\### 🚫 3. Do’s & Don’ts for new traders



✅ Be patient and consistent  

✅ Limit yourself to a maximum of 2 trades per day  

✅ Take profits regularly — small wins keep you motivated  

✅ Focus on established trends instead of chasing every move



❌ Don’t scalp on very short timeframes like 1–5 minutes (too unpredictable)  

❌ Don’t set deadlines like “I must 10x my account by Friday”  

❌ Don’t over-leverage



\---



 🐱 TL;DR

\- $100 is still meaningful and enough to get started

\- Avoid gambling; trade patiently with a plan

\- Small wins add up and help you learn without blowing your account

However, last night I woke up and discovered that the EB70 shut off completely. The display was flickering, and when I hooked up another EB70 to jumpstart it, it showed 100%, which was odd, as it was 40% last time I checked. Then, it showed 0, the recharge logo, and after 5 mins, shut off.

I can't help but think I'm responsible for this, as I bought a microwave, plugged it in earlier that day, and although it hovered around 950w in use and worked fine after, here we are.

I've got another EB70 has a backup that I'm now charging at a coffee shop, then the plan is to hook that up to the other one that's at 0.
But I'm wondering if anyone has come across something similar to me, and whether there's something else going on?",1,1751792738.0,VanLifeUK,1,1.0,False

But buying it from cafes every day can get expensive fast. That's why I started making big batches of cold brew at home. It's surprisingly easy and lets me have delicious iced coffee whenever I want.

The key to great cold brew is using the right equipment. I recently got an iced coffee maker from https://athometouch.com/Iced-Coffee-Makers and it's been a game-changer. But even without special gear, you can make cold brew with basic kitchen items.

Here's my simple process for making a big batch:

1. Grind your coffee beans coarsely. You'll want about 1 cup of grounds for every 4 cups of water.

2. Put the grounds in a large container or pitcher.

3. Add cold or room temperature water. Stir gently to make sure all the grounds are wet.

4. Cover and let it steep in the fridge for 12-24 hours. The longer it steeps, the stronger it'll be.

5. Strain the coffee through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth to remove the grounds.

6. Store your cold brew concentrate in the fridge. It'll stay good for up to 2 weeks.

When you're ready to drink, just dilute the concentrate with water or milk over ice. I usually do a 1:1 ratio, but you can adjust to your taste.

Making cold brew this way is super cost-effective. One batch can last me a whole week or more. Plus, it's less acidic than hot brewed coffee, which is easier on my stomach.

If you make cold brew often, investing in a good iced coffee maker can save you time and hassle. The ones at https://athometouch.com/Iced-Coffee-Makers are designed to make the process even simpler.

Cold brew is versatile too. You can use it in smoothies, bake with it, or even make coffee popsicles. I love experimenting with different beans and flavors. Right now, I'm into a medium roast with hints of chocolate and nuts.

Remember, the quality of your beans matters. Fresh, whole beans that you grind yourself will give you the best flavor. And don't be afraid to adjust the ratios to find what works for you. Some people like it stronger, others prefer it milder.

Making big batches of cold brew at home has seriously upgraded my summer coffee game. It's easy, economical, and lets me enjoy top-quality iced coffee whenever I want. Give it a try and see how it works for you!",1,1751792711.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

“My family *sells* puzzles, and sometimes jam at the farmer’s market, man.”

**CHRIS (leans in):**
“Or it’s a *clandestine relay*. What if this whole puzzle is a *map*?”

I’m a 22-year-old student going into my fourth and final year of a BBA degree at a university in Canada. I’m also an immigrant, and when I first came here, I didn’t really know about internships, networking, or the Big 4. In my first year, I had no idea how important those things were, and it reflected in my GPA as well.

By second year, I started learning more. I got involved in coffee chats, applied to internships, and worked hard to improve my grades. My GPA picked up, and I even landed an interview with EY Toronto, but unfortunately, I didn’t make it through. I didn’t have any internships that summer.

In third year, I kept applying but still didn’t get anything. So I shifted my focus to full-time opportunities. Around April, I finally got an interview with KPMG for a full-time role after months of networking and showing up to events. I felt like I did better this time, but again, I got rejected. That rejection hit me hard. I’ve worked a lot on my interview skills and feel like I’ve genuinely improved, but I still don’t know where I’m falling short.

With my final year starting in two months, it’s tough seeing my friends with internships at the Big 4 while I’m still struggling to find stability. The pressure of securing a full-time job is starting to take a toll on my mental health. I really want to get into the Big 4 because I’m interested in the CPA route and everything they offer. It feels awkward sometimes because I hear people talking about wanting to leave these firms while I’m out here doing everything I can just to get in.

So I’m asking for honest advice, what should I do from here? Is there still a realistic way to break into the Big 4 without having prior internship experience? What can I do differently to finally make it happen?

We’ve met around 6 times  coffee, walks, graduation, and a birthday picnic. She brought me a gift, we laugh together, and conversations are good. But I’ve noticed there’s been very little physical contact initiated from her. A couple of hugs were initiated by her early on, and the rest by me. When walking, she tends to keep hands pocketed. We’ve never sat next to each other (she moves across to talk face-to-face).

As a guy with no prior dating experience, I’m trying to figure out if a lack of physical cues early on means someone isn't interested romantically  or if it can still grow over time.

Does physical escalation matter that early on? Should I bring it up gently or let it evolve?

1lswn5x,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lswn5x,The Queen and the Wind.,"Review: The Queen and the Wind
by Estelle Marchant
Published in Aperture & Artifice: The Magazine of Modern Aesthetics
Autumn Issue 2025


---

In an era where promotional films are slick, safe, and conceptually bankrupt, The Queen and the Wind arrives like a breeze from another world—one that does not ask for your attention, but quietly commands it.

Commissioned by a wind energy company seeking to highlight the aesthetic harmony of their new turbine installation near the East Anglian town of Fenland, the project might have easily been consigned to the genre of greenwashing ephemera. But thanks to an unexpected confluence of eccentric genius and creative integrity, it has emerged instead as a haunting meditation on landscape, power, and presence.

At its heart is Professor Jemima Stackridge, known to her academic and artistic circles alike as Queen Jemima—a title she wears without irony. Stackridge, who once operated in the shadows of East Germany during the Cold War and later re-emerged as a performance artist of startling conviction, delivers what is perhaps her most quietly radical work to date. In flowing embroidered ivory, crowned and barefoot, she moves slowly through the Fenland grass as if born of it—her body in communion with the turbines that rise around her like modern obelisks.

It is important to understand that Stackridge does not perform at the turbines; she performs with them. Her gestures are neither theatrical nor overtly choreographed, but rather drawn from a deep well of intuition and metaphysical contemplation. As she lifts her arms, the turbines seem to turn in response. As she pauses, the air holds its breath. The camera lingers, unhurried. Director Marcus Haldane, known until now for polished commercial projects, deserves real credit for surrendering his own aesthetic instincts and allowing Stackridge’s vision to take the lead.

But what truly elevates The Queen and the Wind from atmospheric oddity to poetic artefact is the soundtrack, composed by Dr. Heather Wigston. While initially assumed by some to be a mere acolyte of Stackridge’s regal persona, Wigston reveals herself here as an artist of exquisite discipline and sensitivity. Working with analogue synthesizers, reel-to-reel tape, and field recordings of the turbines and their environment, she constructs a soundscape that hums with mystery and grace. The music never dominates—it haunts. It rustles through the reeds and pulses with the rhythm of the unseen.

Wigston’s approach—entirely devoid of digital polish—feels like a deliberate act of resistance against the sterile sonic tropes of contemporary media. Her score is hand-built, human, and beautifully flawed in the way that all living things are. One hears echoes of Pauline Oliveros, touches of early Stockhausen, but always with Wigston’s own pastoral restraint. It is less a soundtrack than a collaboration with the landscape itself.

Visually, the film is elegant in its restraint. Cinematographer Lena Rajiv (whose hand can be felt in the patient compositions and subtle greyscale tonality) treats the turbines not as objects, but as characters—monolithic dancers alongside Stackridge. Mist softens the sky; reeds bend as if to listen. The final long shot, where Jemima slowly retreats towards the gothic silhouette of an old manor house, gown trailing, turbines slowly turning behind her, feels like the last page of a folk tale never written down.

Of course, not everyone will understand The Queen and the Wind. Those expecting a corporate film, or even a conventional art piece, may be unsettled by its ambiguity. There is no voiceover, no branding, no neat message. But therein lies its power. It trusts the viewer to see, to listen, and above all, to feel.

Stackridge’s Queen is no ruler in the traditional sense—she exerts no control. Her majesty is in her witnessing. She bears silent testimony to the possibility of human grace amid machines, of wisdom ageing within progress. In her presence, the turbines cease to be merely functional—they become sculptures of air and intention.

The Queen and the Wind is not a film for the impatient. It is a hymn, a whisper, a weathered crown laid gently on the grass. It may be the most honest thing you’ll see this year.

“Field Notes from Fenland: Art, Wind, and the Queen”
by Marcus Haldane, Director
Published in MediaCraft: Journal of Contemporary Production Practice
Issue 42.3 (Autumn 2025)


---

When I was first approached about directing a promotional film for a wind turbine company, I assumed it would be routine. A standard project, beautiful visuals, slow-motion blades, uplifting music, clean transitions—everything I’d done before, polished and presentable. The turbines had recently been installed on the flat plains near the town of Fenland, and the client wanted to portray them as graceful, even poetic, structures—modern contributions to a changing countryside.

The surprise came with the brief’s final paragraph:

> “Please note: the Vice-Chancellor of Fenland University College has arranged for Professor Jemima Stackridge to contribute a live performance for the film. Her segment is to be treated as central, not peripheral.”



At the time, I had never heard of Professor Stackridge. I did a cursory online search and was met with a haze of conflicting information: a performance artist, a philosopher, a Cold War figure of some kind, an aristocratic persona called “Queen Jemima.” The client assured me she was a respected academic and a beloved figure in the local community. That turned out to be true—but it didn’t prepare me for working with her.

The Queen in the Wind

Jemima arrived on location dressed in a full-length ivory gown embroidered with thistles and lilies, wearing a silver crown that glinted faintly beneath the overcast Fenland sky. She never broke character. Not once. She didn’t ""play"" Queen Jemima—she was Queen Jemima, addressing me as ""Master of the Image"" and referring to the turbines as ""my alabaster dancers.""

At first, I was irritated. I come from a world of schedules, shot lists, and multiple takes. Jemima didn’t “do” takes. She performed in long, fluid sequences—no stops, no restarts, no do-overs. Any suggestion that she might repeat a gesture was met with the sort of bemused disdain one might expect if you’d asked a swan to flap again for the camera. She was not difficult out of arrogance—she was difficult because she was genuine. Her art was live, instinctive, and utterly uninterested in the mechanics of film.

I’ve worked with actors, dancers, athletes, even politicians. None challenged my assumptions more than this elderly woman dancing solemnly between turbines in a sea-mist, every movement guided not by choreography but by an inner metaphysical compass.

I began the project baffled. But by the end of the third day, I realised I was watching something remarkable. Jemima moved like someone communing with the turbines rather than interpreting them. To her, they were not infrastructure—they were spirits. The footage, once I surrendered to her rhythm, became strangely powerful. But I knew we’d need a soundtrack that could hold it.

The Composer in the Café

That’s where Heather Wigston came in.

I was told Heather would compose the score, and given her close association with Jemima (they live together, as it turns out), I braced myself for another whirlwind of performative abstraction. I couldn’t have been more wrong.

Heather met me in a small bohemian café in town—Fahrenheit, her unofficial studio—wearing a plain blouse and skirt, with a notebook under one arm and a portable reel-to-reel under the other. She ordered us coffee, sat down, and said:

> “Jemima wants something that sounds like crystal breathing across reeds. I’ll try to keep it under four minutes.”



From that moment, we worked in a calm, focused rhythm. Heather is grounded—thoroughly practical, thoughtful, and intellectually formidable. She composes not on a laptop but using analogue synthesizers and magnetic tape, often recording natural sounds from the local environment and then manipulating them through filters and oscillators.

To me, raised in the world of clean digital stems and neatly sync’d timelines, it was like watching a weaver work by hand when I'd only known power looms. At first, it was disorienting. Her tools whirred and hissed; her process was slow, intuitive, almost meditative. She used wind recordings from the site itself, shaped into texture rather than melody. The turbines’ mechanical drone became a bass bed. Subtle harmonic pulses followed Jemima’s gestures, not the camera cuts.

Heather’s philosophy was simple: ""The music should grow from the land, not sit on top of it."" I was skeptical—but when she played back the first full mix, something clicked. Her score didn’t ""accompany"" the film. It was the film.

The Result

The final piece, titled The Queen and the Wind, was not what the client expected. But to their credit, they embraced it. What began as a corporate promotional video ended as a kind of pastoral tone poem—part art film, part landscape meditation. Jemima gliding through fields like a vision from a half-remembered myth. Heather’s synth tones rising and falling like breaths of earth. The turbines, towering and slow, seemed to bow to them both.

It wasn’t an easy process. At times, I felt adrift—unmoored from the familiar structures of my trade. But I left Fenland with something I hadn’t expected: humility. These women—so different, yet united in discipline and vision—showed me what it meant to approach art not as control, but as collaboration with the world.

I’ve made tighter films. I’ve made more accessible films. But The Queen and the Wind is the one I’m proudest of.

I created an ingredient checklist to help me pick where to go each week. It has most of the information encompassed on this infographic, so I thought I would try my hand at creating one.

* It shows the top two or three farmers for each ingredient. If there's only two, that's because the third falls off in terms of production so much I don't think it's worthwhile hunting them, at least for their ingredients.
* When multiple Pokemon can be found for the same ingredient on the same island, they are shown in order of production, from most to least (left to right). There are some cases, like with Shinx, where not all Pokemon appeared in the same cell - I could not figure out a clean way to indicate which was the most productive in those cases. I think this is the most glaring omission - if you have suggestions how that information might be included, please let me know.
* Sleep type is shown by the color outline - yellow for Dozing, teal for Snoozing, and blue for Slumbering, matching the color coding in the game.
* When a Pokemon unlocks the ingredient at level 30 or 60, that's indicated by that number by their image.

I hope this is helpful for your ingredient farmer hunting. Please let me know if you find any mistakes. I'd be surprised if there aren't any...

Happy sleeping!

# Notes

With every update so far, people have asked why I left particular Pokemon off this infographic. There are several alternatives for most ingredients, and most of them are viable. In the interest of readability, I have shown only the top two or three Pokemon for each ingredient. The intent of this infographic is to help people hunt for ingredient farmers for which they have poor or no coverage - it is NOT meant to tell you to switch to any of these if you already have a farmer that works for you, even if it's not shown on this infographic.

Hope you're all doing fantastic! 😊

Before I get to the point, just want to say how grateful I am to call Berlin my home. It’s chaotic, creative, confusing and I love it.

I am a mid-30s, male, expat who is been here for quite a while. By day, I’m a full-time robot (aka working adult). By weekend, I try to rediscover my human side—mostly somewhere near a lake, on foot or cycling. I don’t smoke, don’t drink, and I genuinely enjoy nature more than nightlife.

I have dipped my toes into dating here… and let’s just say Berlin is great for techno and brunch, not so much for commitment. I have met some lovely women, and some of them are still good (platonic) friends. Maybe I was hoping for something more serious, but Berlin seems to have a different idea. So now, I am shifting my perspective.

**Here’s what I’m looking for:**  
A *Friendship+* situation with a women. Casual, stress-free, and built on mutual respect and connection. No pressure, no drama, and definitely no ghosting-after-3-coffees kind of thing. Just good company, laughs, honesty—and yes, some benefits too.

English-speaking is ideal, but I can fumble my way through “so-la-la” German too. I am more introverted than outgoing, so if you are also someone who prefers deep conversations over small talk or people-watching over partying, we might get along well. I am Height: 181 cm, Build: Athletic (or at least I still pretend to be), Personality: Kind, respectful, definitely not Brad Pitt, but hopefully not Quasimodo either :)

I know it’s not easy to respond publicly to something like this—so my DMs are open. And if you're just here to troll, that's okay too. We all play our parts. 😄

You can call me Addy and here are some things about me. 

I live in the west coast of the United States (California, to be exact) but there’s nothing I dream about more than relocation. I like to describe myself as an extroverted introvert because I tend to never stop yapping as soon as I get comfortable with someone. If i were to describe myself with a song, it would be mirrorball by Taylor Swift. I have so many interests and hobbies, I can easily mold myself into discussing whatever you want to talk about. When it comes to music i love pop, R&B, hip-hop/rap, and I got back into country music last year. I also love pop punk and other types of rock music. 

Gaming wise, I used to have a PC but now I mostly stick to my Switch and Playstation 4. I definitely miss having a PC though and i want to get one again very soon. I’ve tried the popular FPS games (very badly) and found out that i mostly love cozy games with open worlds. I’ll be down to try whatever you want though.  I’ve played Animal Crossing, Stardew Valley, Cozy Grove, Dreamlight Valley and so much more. 

For the astrology people my big 4 are Cancer Sun, Taurus Moon, Libra Rising and I have a Gemini Venus. I’m emotionally intelligent, a hopeless romantic, and I will unironically write you poems, letters, and curate playlists just for you. 

I’m very huge on TV shows, books and movies and regularly use apps like Goodreads, Letterboxd and Serialzd to track the media i’m consuming. I’m kinda in my semi- retired cinephile era so mostly just watching TV shows at the moment. The shows on my rotation right now are Prison Break (just started), Love Island US S7, and last year’s Love Island Australia. Reading wise, I will read anything other than self help books, respectfully. I love thriller books, memoirs, romance books, manga, and so much more. 

I’m looking for someone chill, kind, and emotionally aware who’s down to chat about anything from life goals to what snack you just impulse bought at the store. I’m open to friendships that feel easy and meaningful, with space for honesty, laughter, and late-night spirals about our favorite songs or TV shows.

I’ll never be putting pressure on anything  just hoping to connect with someone who vibes well, shows up genuinely, and values intentional conversation. If we end up besties? Amazing. If there’s more? Also amazing. No expectations, just good energy and mutual effort.

Let’s talk about music, drop random voice notes, romanticize ordinary things, and hype each other up like it’s our job 💫

Bonus points if:
You’re a little artsy, a little thoughtful, a little chaotic in a fun way
You wear rings, are into the same music as me, or have great taste in literally anything

No real explanation other than I was no longer loved or needed. Some of her words over the phone were “it’s not worth it for me anymore.” I’ve known her since I was 14, I still remember the day I first saw her. I didn’t even talk to her until a few months went by, but I never forgot her face. About 2 years ago we had gotten into a small talking phase, nothing serious as we’re both young, and I was strong in my faith. That went along for roughly 3 months, when abruptly I was tagged in a photo in which she was cuddling with a guy who had bullied me pretty bad. That hurt. So obviously only option was hitting the gym daily, and trying to get over her (spoilers, wasn’t an option) In January of this year, I was about to move to Florida. I was extremely torn about moving because I still thought of her, so I took it to God one last time. My prayer was that I trusted him, I knew he had a plan for me and he would help me move or, or if he had other plans I would trust him. Well the next day she texted me out of the blue. I remember it was 2 am, I was reading my Bible, I looked across the room at my phone and just felt something was off, so I checked it and I had gotten a text from “C” for the first time in a year. 2 days later I took her out for coffee and we talked. She had some explanations for her experiences with the other guy, pretty much none of it was her fault and it’s not what it seemed. PROBABLY A LIE CONSIDERING THE OUTCOME. Well i figured this was God and his plan, so we started dating. We kept things pretty simple, saving ourselves for marriage and such. I couldn’t really see her more than twice a week because my mother didn’t like me in a relationship. It seemed like everything was going great, and I really really wanted to marry this girl. Last time I saw her, we were in my car and she was complaining about how hard it is to wait for marriage. I told her I know, but we needed to tough it out because that’s what God wanted. After that night, she started texting less, didn’t have anytime to see me, and then she broke up with me. I suspected cheating, and I did ask her if had been with someone else, to which she responded “I would never.” Well today I found a video of her with someone else. This is what really got me messed up. I’m going to let my pride get the best of me here. I’m a good looking guy, I have a good job, I was a good Christian but this really impacted my relationship with God unfortunately, I’m a musician, and I’m not boring lol. This other guy is pretty much the opposite of me we’ll just say that. Did she break up with me just because I wanted to wait for marriage? I’m just so confused, and very hurt. It’s messed me up big time, I’m getting very tempted to get satisfaction from other girls, which really wouldn’t be hard for me. Was this girl really from God? She’s also a Christian. Idk what im asking for really, I just don’t know what to do. I know I’m still young and i shouldn’t let this affect me or whatever, but I’ve had mental health issues in the past, chronic stuff, and this hasn’t made it better. PS. This is going down in the south, I’m NOT southern I’m from colorful Colorado, and I’ve experienced a very different lifestyle here.
Again I’m not sure what im asking for, I’m just frantically writing this down at 3 am because I can’t sleep, and i literally don’t have anyone to talk to. My mom is away in Florida right now, and my one friend isn’t the talking type",2,1751790290.0,teenrelationships,1,1.0,False

 Okay. I know how this sounds. Just... let me explain before you judge me. I’m already judging myself  

My life is… not great. Two years ago, I blew up my marriage by sleeping with my coworker. My ex-husband (rightfully) left me, took half my friends in the divorce, and now I’m just… here. A 38-year-old divorced single mom who spends her nights crying into Trader Joe’s frozen gyoza and rewatching dr.who (my favorite show)

Then oneday there’s Ethan (20M). Sweet, awkward, way-too-nice-for-me Ethan. We met at the library—yes, the library, because apparently I’ve become the sad cliché of a lonely divorcée haunting public spaces—when he shyly asked if the chair next to me was taken. He was wearing a attack on Titan shirt and blushed when I recognized it.  

I know the age gap is weird. Trust me, I know. But he was kind. He brought me coffee ""just because."" He listened to me vent about my life without making it weird. He played Minecraft with my daughter and he didn’t treat her like some annoying kid. For the first time in years, I felt… wanted. Not as a mom, not as a pity case, just… me.  

But then I walked in on him watching a anime and...

Look, I get anime. I watched sailor Moon as a kid. But this? Little girls in frilly, skin-tight outfits I tried to be cool about it. I really did. But when I asked him why he liked it, he got all flustered and said, ""It’s part of a universe of show that he already watched so he wanted to finish the whole Franchise"" in a voice that sounded like he was trying to convince himself.  

I panicked. All my ex’s ""she’s just a friend"" bullshit came rushing back, and suddenly, I was that woman again—the paranoid, insecure mess who sees threats everywhere. So I ended things. Blamed it on the age gap. Said it was ""too complicated.""  

Ethan just… nodded. Didn’t fight me. Just said, ""I get it,"" in this quiet, hurt voice that made me feel even worse. Now my daughter keeps asking when he’s coming back, and I’m sitting here wondering if I just ruined the one good thing in my life because I couldn’t handle a stupid cartoon.

Since then I have been suffering from sexual arousal which I feel when I overstimulate the pudendal nerve. I do not feel pain but it destroys my pleasure in life because to get rid of this arousal I cannot do many activities and if I do I have to fight with myself not to masturbate which I really do not want to do and after which I feel mentally weak. It is difficult for me to find a specialist who would help with this and there are also few options for help because I do not want to take prescribed pills, the anesthetic injection works for a moment, the only option left is a surgical operation which is used in extreme cases. What causes irritation of the pudendal nerve in my case is: running, jumping, hanging on a bar, sitting for a long time, coffee, cigarettes (dopamine), alcohol.  What helps is excluding these activities but also stretching the body, the abdomen the most and the most abstaining from orgasm after about 10 days the symptoms disappear and the longer you abstain from orgasm the more the symptoms disappear. So most of the things that I love/like I have to avoid, it hurts me the most that I have to limit running and riding a scooter (jumping). It is so painful for me that in the past I was addicted to porn and the only way to heal the brain is complete sexual abstinence for a very long time, which I want to do but it is doubly difficult. Does anyone have an idea what to add to the things that harm or help that I have listed, I hope that I have also given someone a few tips on what can harm.",1,1751790190.0,PudendalNeuralgia,0,1.0,False

""Mrs. McKenzie, you have already waited for several hours. I'm afraid Mr. McKenzie will not be coming back.""    
  
""It's fine. I'll wait a little longer.""    
  
After three years of marriage, she wanted to properly celebrate their anniversary for once.    
  
However, her husband was making headlines with another woman.    
  
""World-Class Couple! Gabriel McKenzie Personally Picks Up Sienna Sullivan at the Airport! So Sweet!""   
  
Sienna was her husband's first love. The whole world supported him in winning her back.    
  
But none of them knew that Gabriel was married.    
  
No matter how many times she called, all she ever heard was the cold, automated message that the phone was turned off.    
  
In the end, she did not wait for Gabriel, but instead, she received a call from a nurse at the hospital.    
  
""Ms. Weston, your grandma's condition has worsened. Please come immediately.""    
  
The nurse's anxious tone exploded in her ears like a thunderclap, making her entire body tremble.    
  
She grabbed a coat, picked up her car keys, and rushed out.    
  
Running countless red lights on the way, Eleanor Weston arrived at the hospital with shaking hands.    
  
She had been picked up from the trash by her grandma, Margaret Grant. To her, Margaret was her only family.    
  
Margaret was still in the emergency room. Distraught, she clutched the nurse's arm and asked, ""What happened? Wasn't she fine yesterday?""    
  
""I... I don't know either,"" the nurse quickly explained. ""Ms. Weston, you know me. I've always taken care of your grandma with all my heart.""    
  
""Did anything unusual happen before she collapsed?""    
  
""Oh, right, there was a Ms. Sullivan who came by today.""    
  
*Ms. Sullivan? Sienna!*    
  
Like a bolt of lightning, Eleanor's mind buzzed, and her entire body turned ice-cold.    
  
Sienna had no connection to Margaret. She wouldn't have visited for no reason.    
  
Eleanor forced herself to stay calm and asked, ""Do you know what she talked about with my grandma?""    
  
""The door was closed at the time. From outside, I only heard her say something about marrying someone. Then your grandma argued with her for a bit. Later, Ms. Sullivan left, and when I went in to check on your grandma, she had already collapsed...""    
  
Eleanor clenched her fists and braced herself against the wall, trembling with rage.    
  
She had always hidden bad news from Margaret, afraid that she would find out about Sienna and Gabriel.    
  
But Sienna had gone straight to Margaret!    
  
The emergency room light turned off, and a doctor walked out.    
  
Her heart pounded violently.    
  
The doctor removed his mask and said wearily, ""The patient suffered an acute cerebral hemorrhage, likely triggered by emotional distress. My condolences.""    
  
She had imagined a thousand possible outcomes, but never this.    
  
The doctor's words felt like a steel wire tightening around her chest. Forcing herself to stay upright, she walked to the hospital bed.    
  
The only person who had ever been good to her now lay beneath a white sheet, forever separated from her.    
  
Grief swallowed her whole. She couldn't even cry. She clutched Margaret's cold hand as memories flooded her mind, warm moments from the past, now turned into heavy blows, crashing down on her, leaving her breathless.  
  
She let out a sob, covering her mouth as she slowly slid down the wall into a crouch.  
  
It was unclear how much time had passed before a familiar voice brought her back to reality.  
  
""Eleanor.""  
  
She slowly looked up.  
  
The man before her exuded a powerful presence, his handsome features striking.  
  
""It's you..."" she muttered, her gaze empty. ""Grandma's gone...""  
  
Her only family had left her.  
  
She wore a thin nightgown, huddled in the corner, like an abandoned child.  
  
Gabriel's throat was dry as he crouched down beside her. ""Margaret wouldn't want to see you like this, if she were still here.""  
  
Eleanor's heart felt hollow.  
  
Some pain cut deeper than bones, and no matter how much she breathed, it couldn't ease the tightness and anxiety within her.  
  
Numbly, she watched as Gabriel handled everything. By the time they arrived at the funeral home, she had regained just a little strength.  
  
On the first night of the vigil, an unexpected guest arrived.  
  
Sienna, dressed in black and holding a wreath, walked in.  
  
It was the first time Eleanor saw her.  
  
In person, she was even more beautiful than on TV. Her long black hair, straight and flowing to her waist, cascaded like water, her features small and delicate, especially her eyes, which seemed as if they had been washed with water, deep, pure, and exuding an innocent, almost seductive charm.  
  
She walked up to Eleanor and spoke in a clear, crisp voice, ""Ms. Weston, please accept my condolences.""  
  
Eleanor remembered what the nurse had said.  
  
*Does Sienna really have nothing to do with Grandma's sudden passing?*  
  
As Sienna turned, Eleanor hoarsely called out to her. ""Ms. Sullivan, the nurse said you visited my grandma the day she passed.""  
  
Sienna froze, her movements awkward.  
  
Eleanor's voice remained steady. ""Ms. Sullivan, you and my grandma had no connection. Why did you visit her?""  
  
Sienna turned, looking completely innocent. ""What are you trying to say?""  
  
""I want to know what you said to my grandma,"" Eleanor demanded.  
  
""I had my foreign friends video-call your grandma to ask about her condition. I didn't say anything else,"" Sienna pouted in grievance. ""I was trying to help your grandma.""  
  
""Help her?"" Eleanor let out a soft laugh. ""You were strangers. The day you visited, my grandma collapsed. I don't think you were trying to help her. I think you were trying to harm her.""  
  
""It was my decision,"" Gabriel's voice came from behind, low and deep, his eyes dark and unreadable. ""Sienna's friend is an expert in tumor surgery, well-known abroad.""  
  
""It's alright, Gabe. She's just lost her loved one, and I understand her emotions,"" Sienna moved closer to him, her eyes shimmering with tears. ""If it helps her feel better, I'm willing to apologize.""  
  
""It's just a coincidence,"" Gabriel said softly, looking at Eleanor. ""I was the one who arranged for her to visit. If you want to blame someone, blame me.""  
  
Eleanor's face turned pale as she struggled to hold herself upright. She pinched her cold fingers and bit her lip.  
  
The man she had loved for years was now firmly shielding someone else.  
  
""Blame you? How could I blame you..."" She shook her head bitterly, her eyes, already drained of tears, reddened once more.  
  
Seeing her like this, Gabriel frowned. ""You're exhausted. Let me have someone take you to rest.""  
  
""No need."" She forced herself to stand, her lips ashen.  
  
Sienna's eyes were as pure and clear as two black jewels. Her cherry lips moved, and her crisp voice clearly reached Eleanor's ears. ""If you suspect that I caused your grandma's death, you can report me to the police and have them investigate.""  
  
*Investigate?*  
  
She had already reported it to the police. They said the surveillance was broken and there was not enough evidence to proceed. Even after hearing Sienna's name, they urged her to give up.  
  
That only made her more certain that Sienna was the culprit.  
  
What a coincidence, the surveillance had worked fine the day before, and then, on that very day, it broke.  
  
She knew that the Sullivan family had great influence, and finding evidence on her own was nearly impossible.  
  
But she wouldn't give up. She would find the truth, sooner or later.  
  
""Sienna, people may deceive, but the universe knows all. One day, you will pay for this.""  
  
""Eleanor!"" Gabriel's gaze turned sharp, his voice icy, ""Watch your words.""        

**Chapter 2 That Man Was Not Him**



His warning felt like needles, digging deep into her heart.  
  
""You can just consider me as making a scene,"" Eleanor suddenly laughed, ""but I will find the evidence.""  
  
She couldn't stand to stay any longer. Steadying herself, she stumbled out of the room.  
  
After she left, Gabriel subtly explained to Sienna, ""Margaret was very important to her. She may have spoken too harshly. Don't take it to heart.""  
  
Sienna shook her head, biting her lip in grievance. ""I always thought she was a gentle person. I didn't expect her to have such strong hostility toward me.""  
  
She added, ""Gabe, does what you said before still stand?""  
  
Gabriel lowered his gaze, remaining silent.  
  
""Hasn't she already mentioned divorce to you?"" she asked cautiously, probing. ""She's so fragile right now. She probably needs someone by her side, doesn't she?""  
  
Gabriel pressed his lips tightly together, his fist clenching tighter as he thought about the reasons Eleanor had given for the divorce.  
  
The man she loved. Unfortunately, that man wasn't him.  
  
They had been married for three years, and he had kept his desires in check. But a few days ago, he woke up to realize he had slept with Eleanor.  
  
He was angry at being manipulated, but Eleanor vehemently denied it and handed him a divorce agreement.  
  
""Gabriel, let's get a divorce.""  
  
She had always been obedient, never once bringing up the topic of divorce.  
  
""Is there someone else?"" He toyed with the divorce papers, mocking her.  
  
To his surprise, she smiled and admitted, ""Yes.""  
  
""Does he mind that you've been married?"" he asked again.  
  
""He knows.""  
  
""Mm.""  
  
He wanted to ask more, but didn't know where to start.  
  
It had been three years, and with their constant separation, he never had the chance to truly understand her.  
  
She really had found someone she liked. She hid the man so well that no matter how much he searched, he couldn't find any clues.  
  
Since she had found someone, he should let her go.  
  
In Sienna's eager gaze, Gabriel slowly nodded.  
  
After the funeral, Eleanor began to handle the divorce matters.  
  
But Gabriel seemed to have disappeared. He wasn't at the villa, and when she called, he didn't answer. People at the company said Gabriel was on a business trip and wouldn't be back for a week.  
  
This week, Eleanor went through the hardest week of her life.  
  
The media widely reported on Gabriel and Sienna's trip abroad.  
  
In the photos, Sienna wore a beautiful smile, exuding happiness, while the man beside her wore sunglasses, standing tall and exuding charisma. They looked like a couple madly in love.  
  
She tried to convince herself that they were getting divorced, so she shouldn't care.  
  
But every time she thought about him and the woman who had killed her grandma, she couldn't sit still.  
  
When Gabriel returned, and she got word of his whereabouts, she grabbed the divorce papers and left the house.  
  
To the outside world, she and Gabriel were still in a secret marriage, and everyone believed Gabriel was still single.  
  
Sienna had used this gap to flaunt her love with Gabriel, so Eleanor decided to tear off this mask herself.  
  
At the Maze Bar, a place rumored to be where rich young men liked to do business.  
  
On the dance floor, women dressed provocatively and swayed their waists, while men drank crazily. It felt like another world, bizarre and wild, where everyone was indulging and lost in pleasure.  
  
She endured her discomfort and walked through the noise, heading toward the private room where Gabriel was.  
  
Inside the room, the music was loud, and empty bottles lay scattered on the floor.  
  
A few men sat on the couch, each with a woman in their arms, all blooming like fresh flowers.  
  
Gabriel sat with his legs crossed, coldly leaning against the leather sofa, his eyes chilling and imposing.  
  
Unlike the other men, only Sienna was beside him.  
  
""Mr. McKenzie, having just one woman by your side is so boring. Why not call a few more over?""   
  
The man's handsome face wore a wicked smile, with a natural upward curve to his lips, exuding a rebellious charm.  
  
Gabriel lowered his eyes and said nothing.  
  
He was here to discuss business with Ethan Xander, not interested in this game of playing with women.  
  
""Ethan, I'm still here,"" Sienna flirted, taking over the conversation. ""How dare you introduce women to Gabe in front of me? What will you do when I'm not around?""  
  
These past few days, she'd done everything she could to cling to Gabriel, even leaking their time together to the media, just to show everyone that she was back.  
  
Ethan whistled with a mischievous grin. ""Women are like clothes. What's the point of wearing the same one every day? Besides, you and Gabriel aren't even married, so what's with the Mrs. McKenzie act?""  
  
Ethan and Sienna had always clashed, and he didn't hold back any of his words.  
  
Sienna, a daughter of the Sullivan family, wasn't used to being treated this way.  
  
She blinked her innocent eyes, angrily saying, ""I remember your sister went missing and was never found. Aren't you afraid she might end up like these girls, being played with?""  
  
With a crash, the bottle in Ethan's hand smashed in front of her, the glass shattering all over the floor.  
  
The entire room fell silent.  
  
The Xander family was the richest in Newayne, operating in both the legal and illegal spheres, essentially ruling Newayne. However, the Xander family had a widely known secret.  
  
The Xander family had four children. The first three were boys, and after a long wait, they finally had a girl. But on her hundredth day, she was stolen.  
  
Unexpectedly, Sienna, fearless as always, dared to mention this matter.  
  
For a moment, the expressions of everyone in the private room varied.  
  
At that moment, a sudden noise came from outside the door.  
  
""What's all the noise about?"" Ethan, already in a bad mood, felt the effects of the alcohol kicking in at the sound of the argument.  
  
The waiter awkwardly replied, ""A woman came, insisting on coming in to find Mr. McKenzie.""  
  
*A woman?*  
  
Gabriel narrowed his eyes, a person flashing across his mind.  
  
He snuffed out his cigarette, his voice lazy as he spoke, ""Let her in.""  
  
Hearing the sound from inside, Eleanor tightly gripped the divorce papers and walked in.  
  
In the dimly lit private room, pairs of curious eyes all turned to her. The air was thick with the smell of alcohol and perfume, which made her feel nauseous.  
  
She forced herself to ignore the discomfort and walked toward them.  
  
Sienna, sitting next to Gabriel, showed a surprised expression upon seeing her.  
  
Thinking about the news about them, Eleanor's last remnants of affection disappeared.  
  
Under the gaze of everyone, she slightly parted her lips, her voice sweet and sickening. ""Oh my dear husband, so this is where you are!""  
  
*Husband? Mr. McKenzie is married? So, Sienna is the mistress?*  
  
Everyone in the room gasped and turned their eyes toward Sienna.  
  
Sienna's face turned a mix of pale and red.  
  
Now, everyone knew that she had meddled in Gabriel's marriage.  
  
Sienna nervously gripped Gabriel's shirt, as if clinging to her last hope.  
  
Gabriel looked at Eleanor, his eyes like water, deep and inscrutable.  
  
This scene made everyone in the room feel like they were sitting on needles.  
  
No one dared to watch Gabriel's drama. People in the room quietly left.  
  
Only Ethan remained seated on the couch, unmoving, his gaze tightly fixed on Eleanor's face, filled with excitement.

**Chapter 3 What Is Your Relationship With Her?**



""Mr. Ethan, aren't you leaving?"" Someone lightly patted his shoulder.  
  
Ethan remained motionless. Where no one could see, his hands trembled.  
  
Eleanor noticed someone staring at her.  
  
The man had rebellious, sharp eyebrows and narrow, deeply expressive eyes. His features were strikingly perfect, yet the corners of his lips carried a wicked smile, arrogant and flamboyant.  
  
The curiosity and excitement in his gaze made her uneasy.  
  
Most people had already left the room, yet he remained seated, showing no intention of leaving.  
  
Eleanor no longer hesitated. She held out the divorce papers to Gabriel.  
  
""I don't want anything. Just sign the original agreement.""  
  
In their three years of marriage, he might not have loved her, but at least he had never cheated.  
  
Yet after seeing him openly appear with Sienna these past few days, she knew it was time to finalize the divorce.  
  
Gabriel gave the papers a brief glance before sneering. ""Is that man really so important?""  
  
*Is he really that important that she has to force my hand in front of everyone?*  
  
Eleanor bit her lip slightly, knowing he had misunderstood.  
  
But it no longer mattered. Their marriage was bound to end anyway.  
  
Seeing her lower her eyes in silence, Gabriel felt a wave of irritation.  
  
He wanted to ask who the man was but knew this wasn't the time.  
  
The atmosphere grew heavier, pressing down on his chest.  
  
Frustrated, he yanked at his tie and rasped, ""Pen.""  
  
When she didn't move, he slowly lifted his gaze. ""Didn't you want me to sign?""  
  
""Oh,"" Eleanor murmured. She quickly fumbled in her bag, hesitated for a second, then handed him a pen.  
  
Without lifting his head, Gabriel signed his name in bold strokes and handed the papers back.  
  
Eleanor took the heavy documents, forcing herself to suppress the ache in her chest. She had achieved her goal, yet an emptiness lingered inside her.  
  
""Since the papers are signed, shouldn't you head to City Hall next for the divorce certificate?"" Sienna suddenly chimed in.  
  
Eleanor turned to Sienna, watching her widen her eyes with an innocent expression. But all Eleanor could think about was the missing nurse.  
  
The day she confronted Sienna, the nurse had resigned and vanished without a trace. Margaret's death remained a mystery.  
  
Seeing Eleanor's sharp glare, Sienna tensed and instinctively stepped back.  
  
Gabriel noticed the burning hatred in Eleanor's eyes and immediately understood that she was thinking of Margaret again.  
  
""Eleanor, how many times do I have to say this? Sienna didn't harm your grandma.""  
  
*Didn't hurt Grandma? He's determined to defend Sienna.*  
  
Eleanor looked at him, her voice hoarse. ""Gabriel, you know Grandma was my only family.""  
  
She had been abandoned as a child, left to fend for herself. If not for Margaret, she would have frozen to death on the streets.  
  
Margaret had given her all the love she had ever known, and had been the sole reason she kept going.  
  
Yet not only had she failed to repay that kindness, but she had also let Margaret die without answers.  
  
She tilted her head back, forcing her eyes wide open to keep the tears from falling.  
  
""I know."" Gabriel's lips pressed into a thin line. ""I was the one who arranged for her to be in the hospital. Sienna had no reason to harm her.""  
  
Eleanor let out a soft laugh, but there was no warmth in her eyes.  
  
""I don't know if she had a reason, but the nurse said they argued that day.""  
  
If Sienna had truly cared for Margaret, they never would have argued.  
  
Margaret had always been kind, living peacefully with her neighbors for years. Even in illness, she somehow ended up arguing with Sienna, which only convinced Eleanor that Sienna must have said something.  
  
The thought that Margaret had been angered to death made Eleanor's hatred endless.  
  
Sienna had been the only visitor that day. Margaret's sudden brain hemorrhage wasn't just a coincidence.  
  
""If you trust her so much,"" Eleanor said coldly, ""then I'll see you in court. I will find the evidence.""  
  
She cast a fleeting glance at Sienna before quickly turning to leave.    
  
Maybe it was the exhaustion of the past few days, but as she reached the door, a sudden wave of dizziness hit her. Just as she was about to collapse, a hand caught her.    
  
Eleanor steadied herself and looked up gratefully, only to meet the gaze of the man who had been watching her all along.    
  
""Thank you.""    
  
Seeing her up close only deepened Ethan's suspicion.    
  
From the moment he first laid eyes on her, he had been shaken to his core.    
  
She looked too much like his aunt.    
  
Everyone said the lost Xander daughter resembled their aunt.    
  
Genetics could skip generations, and it wasn't uncommon for a niece to take after her aunt.    
  
There was a real chance this woman was his sister.    
  
As his grip on her arm unconsciously tightened, Eleanor frowned and subtly pulled away before turning to leave.    
  
""Wait!""    
  
Ethan instinctively stepped forward, only for Sienna to block his path.    
  
""Mr. Ethan, have you taken a liking to her?"" Sienna batted her lashes, teasing. ""She comes from poverty, probably not even worthy of stepping through the Xander Residence's doors.""    
  
Everyone knew Hudson Xander had strict requirements for his future daughters-in-law. Background and education were non-negotiable.    
  
No one questioned the Xander family's high standards. They had the power to be selective.    
  
""Poverty?"" Ethan raised an eyebrow, deep in thought.    
  
*If she really is my sister, she must have had a hard life all these years.*  
  
Gabriel had kept his marriage a secret, even from him. That alone made it clear that the McKenzie family had never truly acknowledged Eleanor.    
  
""Yeah,"" Sienna smirked. ""Margaret picked her up off the streets. No one even knows who her parents are.""    
  
Ethan's expression darkened.    
  
Sienna continued, fanning the flames. ""Your family would never accept a woman like that, would they?""    
  
Every word dripped with mockery.    
  
Ethan glanced toward Gabriel, then recalled how Eleanor had stormed out earlier.    
  
*If my sister had gone missing and been raised by strangers, would people mock her like this too?*  
  
Leaning lazily against the doorframe, Ethan shot Sienna a sidelong glance.    
  
""If she was good enough for the McKenzie family, why wouldn't she be good enough for mine?""    
  
Sienna stiffened, awkwardly glancing at Gabriel.    
  
Gabriel approached just in time.    
  
""You've been watching the show for so long, why rush off now? Why not sit down and have a cup of coffee first?""    
  
Ethan regretted getting caught up with Gabriel.    
  
All he wanted now was to dig into Eleanor's past.    
  
She looked so much like his aunt, and she just happened to be adopted. When coincidences piled up like this, they stopped being coincidences.    
  
""Gabriel, I have urgent matters to handle. Whatever you want to say, save it for another time.""    
  
Without waiting for a response, Ethan turned to leave, but Gabriel blocked his path.    
  
His gaze was deep and unreadable.    
  
From the moment Eleanor had walked in, Ethan hadn't taken his eyes off her.    
  
Ethan might be reckless, but he wasn't the type to stick around just to watch the drama unfold.    
  
Eleanor had told him she wanted a divorce because she had found someone else.    
  
*Is that person Ethan?*    
  
Gabriel's expression grew colder.    
  
""Mr. Ethan, what exactly is your relationship with my wife?""

**Chapter 4 When Did You Meet Ethan?**



*What kind of relationship? Probably siblings, but is there any need to explain that to an outsider?*  
  
Ethan crossed his arms, a smirk playing on his lips as he glanced between Gabriel and Sienna like he was watching a show. ""Mr. McKenzie, didn't you already divorce your wife? Why are you still so invested in her personal life? I always thought Ms. Sienna was your girlfriend, but it turns out you have one outside and one at home. Mr. McKenzie, when it comes to being a playboy, I have to hand it to you. You win.""    
  
*No wonder Eleanor brought the divorce papers straight to a bar. With a husband that is unfaithful, who could blame her for losing patience? Gabriel, you'd better hope Eleanor isn't my sister. Because if she is, the entire Xander family will make you pay!*  
  
Ethan never actually answered his question.    
  
This time, Gabriel didn't stop him.    
  
Ethan, who usually didn't bother standing up for anyone, was genuinely angry.    
  
""Gabe, I've never seen Ethan defend a woman like this before,"" Sienna said, both flustered and aggrieved.    
  
*Ethan, taking Eleanor's side? When did they get close? And why haven't I heard a single rumor about it?*  
  
Gabriel's lips pressed into a thin line, his gaze turning icy.    
  
The seed of doubt had been planted. Now, it only needed time to take root.    
  
After leaving the bar, Eleanor returned to the house Margaret had lived in.    
  
Margaret's last wish had been for her to find her family. She had said that even if Eleanor's parents weren't good people, having a sibling would still mean she had someone to rely on.    
  
Margaret had lived her whole life without children or family. She had placed all her hopes on Eleanor, scrimping and saving to raise her. But before she could enjoy any comfort, she had passed away.    
  
""Grandma, I will get justice for you.""    
  
Even if Sienna was a towering tree, Eleanor would find a way to bring her down.    
  
She searched through the house all night but couldn't find the box Margaret had mentioned, the one that held the truth about her origins.    
  
Early the next morning, Gabriel called. ""Where are you?""    
  
""Do you need something?"" Her voice was colder than ever.    
  
""Come home. We need to talk.""    
  
""That's not my home."" She glanced at the dimming sky, her throat tightening. ""If there's something you want to say, just say it over the phone.""    
  
""When did you meet Ethan?"" His voice was direct. ""Are you divorcing me to be with him?""    
  
*Ethan?*   
  
The name sounded familiar to her.    
  
Then it clicked. He was the third son of the Xander family.    
  
Eleanor didn't understand how Gabriel had come to that conclusion, but since the divorce papers were already signed, she had no interest in clearing up his misunderstanding.    
  
""Gabriel, we've signed the divorce papers. I hope you'll stop meddling in my affairs.""    
  
""We signed them, but we're not divorced yet,"" Gabriel said, his voice chilling. ""Didn't you say Sienna harmed your grandma? I found the caretaker.""    
  
*The caretaker is at the McKenzie Residence?*    
  
Eleanor's grip on her phone tightened.    
  
After that day, she had tried everything to contact the caretaker but had found no trace of her. She never expected Gabriel to track her down.    
  
""Alright. I'll be there soon.""    
  
If they wanted the truth, she would give them the truth.    
  
When Eleanor arrived at the McKenzie Residence she didn't see the caretaker. Instead, she saw Sienna sitting leisurely at the dining table, enjoying breakfast.    
  
Sienna dined gracefully while Zelda bustled around serving her. Anyone who didn't know better would assume she was the lady of the house.    
  
Eleanor's gaze fell on the seat Sienna occupied. It was hers. The best spot by the window, where the air was fresh, the light was warm, and the view of the lake stretched far into the distance. Now, another woman had taken it.    
  
""Mrs. McKenzie..."" Zelda hesitated, looking embarrassed.    
  
""Oh, you're here?"" Sienna smiled, all innocence. ""I didn't have breakfast prepared for you. You don't mind, do you?""    
  
It was only then that Eleanor noticed that the table was set with nothing but light, delicate dishes, all clearly meant for Sienna.    
  
Adapting to the situation was human nature. Let alone someone like Zelda, whose paycheck came from the McKenzie family.  
  
Eleanor's smile didn't reach her eyes. ""Ms. Sienna is, after all, a guest. Zelda, it's your duty to entertain guests.""  
  
This word ""guest"" was both a sarcasm and a reminder.  
  
However, Sienna didn't mind, grinning as she said, ""Right now I'm a guest, but soon I'll become the lady of the house.""  
  
""That depends on whether I want to leave. If I don't want to, you can never become the lady,"" Eleanor said. As she spoke, she suddenly realized that this idea was actually quite good.  
  
If she left happily, she would help these two b\*stards get together.  
  
If Margaret hadn't been harmed, she would have withdrawn. But since Sienna killed Margaret, staying instead would allow her to take revenge on Sienna.  
  
As expected, as soon as the words left her mouth, Sienna's expression changed. ""What do you want to do?""  
  
""I just think it wouldn't be bad for you to always be the mistress.""  
  
Always being the mistress meant all her efforts had been in vain!  
  
Sienna absolutely couldn't allow such a thing to happen.  
  
""Eleanor, if it weren't for Gabe, you wouldn't even have the right to speak to me here."" Thinking of Gabriel's warning, Sienna was so angry that she scratched her palm.  
  
Gabriel had told her that Eleanor had been his wife for a few years, and while she had no merit, she had suffered. He asked her not to go too far.  
  
But if she pushed Eleanor to the extreme, there was no telling what outrageous things she might do.  
  
""You're really pathetic. Gabe doesn't love you anymore, and you still cling to him.""  
  
Sienna's words were like a sharp sword, accurately stabbing at Eleanor's heart.  
  
Eleanor smiled but said nothing.  
  
There was no love, nor was there any lack of it. Gabriel had never loved her, from the beginning to the end.  
  
""Ms. Sienna, the most shameless one is the one who interferes with others' relationships.""  
  
""You're talking nonsense!"" Sienna angrily rushed forward, reaching for her face, but Eleanor quickly dodged.  
  
Sienna couldn't stop in time and went crashing forward.  
  
There was a fish tank in front.  
  
With a *bang*, the glass shattered everywhere.  
  
Time froze.  
  
Then, a heart-wrenching scream echoed through the house.  
  
Sienna's hand had been cut deeply, blood pouring out.  
  
""My hand! My hand hurts!"" Sienna was stunned.  
  
She was a jewelry designer, and her hands were the most important part of her career. The Sullivan family even insured her hands.  
  
But now, a terrifying gash ran from the back of her hand all the way to her palm.  
  
""Eleanor, I'm going to kill you!"" At that moment, Sienna couldn't feel the pain, only wanting Eleanor to experience the same agony.  
  
She grabbed a long piece of glass and charged at Eleanor, determined to slash her face.  
  
At that moment, a shadow blocked in front of Eleanor. The person reached out, catching the shard.  
  
Blood flowed from the glass.  
  
""Gabe!""  
  
""Gabriel!"" Eleanor froze.  
  
Sienna stood stunned.  
  
Gabriel's hand, oddly enough, had the same wound in the same spot.  
  
""Gabe, why are you protecting her?"" Sienna collapsed.  
  
Gabriel didn't answer. He glanced at her bleeding hand, frowned, and said to the maid standing by, ""Go get Dr. Liam.""  
  
Liam Clarkson was the McKenzie family's doctor, living next to McKenzie Residence.  
  
Eleanor ran to the side, grabbed a first-aid kit, and walked toward Gabriel with disinfectants. In a fit of anger, Sienna shoved her hard.  
  
""Get lost! It's all your fault! Now both Gabe and I are injured because of you.""  
  
Eleanor stood still, staring at Gabriel. ""I didn't mean to.""



**Chapter 5 Is This What You Wanted?**



Sienna's tears fell in large drops. ""Gabe, look, she's always like this, hurting others and not even realizing it, always playing the innocent.""  
  
Gabriel looked at Sienna's wound, and as he thought about the news his assistant had given him, his brows furrowed deeply.  
  
Sienna was the only daughter of the Sullivan family, and it was rumored that after the funeral, Eleanor's words blaming Sienna had reached the ears of the Sullivan family members. They were preparing to sue Eleanor.  
  
And this wound, most likely, would leave a scar. The Sullivan family wouldn't let this go easily.  
  
Thinking of the Sullivan family's methods, Gabriel frowned.  
  
He looked at Eleanor, his gaze coldening a little more. ""Apologize.""  
  
""What did you say?""  
  
*Apologize?*  
  
Eleanor couldn't believe what she was hearing. ""But she ran into it herself...""  
  
""If it weren't for you, she wouldn't have run into the fish tank,"" Gabriel's eyes darkened, his tone cold as ice.  
  
*So, he's seen it. If I don't avoid it, am I just going to let Sienna hurt me?*  
  
This was blatant favoritism.  
  
Eleanor's heart trembled violently, her gaze slowly shifting toward him. For the first time, she found his handsome face unfamiliar and terrifying.  
  
She stared at Gabriel as if looking at an executioner. ""What if I don't apologize?""  
  
""Then you will never leave McKenzie Residence,"" Gabriel said coldly, as if explaining something simple and ordinary.  
  
There were two meanings to this statement. One was that she should forget about the divorce, her life would be miserable if she stayed. The other was that she would forever be targeted by the McKenzie family.  
  
*Oh, Gabriel, I never thought you could be this ruthless.*  
  
Eleanor felt like her heart had been torn open, a cold, sharp pain as if wind was rushing in with every breath.  
  
The power of the McKenzie and Sullivan families was indeed something she couldn't fight against.  
  
After all, she was just a pathetic, helpless person to them.  
  
Her eyes reddened, and she looked at Gabriel resolutely.  
  
""Fine, I'll apologize.""  
  
She suddenly smiled. As she smiled, the tears streamed down.  
  
""Sienna, I'm sorry.""  
  
*Grandma, I'm sorry. I'm powerless, causing your untimely death. Grandma, I'm sorry. I will get justice for you.*  
  
Each word of the apology felt like a steel blade stabbing through her body.  
  
It was as though only such blunt pain could make her wake up.  
  
*Eleanor, you can't cry! Don't cry in front of these two scoundrels!*  
  
She bit her lip hard, facing the tears in her eyes.  
  
Unable to stay any longer, she staggered as she turned to leave, but at that moment, someone walked in from outside.  
  
""Ms. Weston."" It was the caregiver, dressed in work clothes, with a gentle expression.  
  
""Didn't you say she saw Sienna kill Margaret?"" Gabriel's voice came from behind, cold as a frozen lake, sharp enough to pierce the heart. ""Then let's confront her directly.""  
  
*What does this mean? Is he really willing to give Grandma justice?*  
  
Eleanor's heart raced wildly.  
  
""Do you believe her?"" she asked Gabriel.  
  
If he was willing to believe the caregiver, there might be a chance to get justice for Margaret.  
  
Gabriel didn't answer her, instead turning to ask the caregiver, ""Did you say that Sienna caused Margaret's death?""  
  
The room fell silent, not even a pin drop could be heard.  
  
Eleanor could hear her heart pounding, as if it would leap out of her chest.  
  
She watched the caregiver, who was just as nervous, and gently reassured her, ""Don't be afraid, just repeat what you told me before.""  
  
Encouraged, the caregiver took a deep breath, blushing as she said, ""No, I never said that.""  
  
*Clunk.* Eleanor's heart sank to the bottom.  
  
""You clearly said that after Sienna left, my grandma collapsed. Why are you changing your story now?""  
  
""Ms. Weston, I never said that. There's no change in my story.""  
  
Sienna's smugness, Gabriel's indifference, and the caregiver's words were like cold water, drenching her completely.  
  
""Has someone threatened you?"" Eleanor tried to maintain her composure.  
  
The caregiver shook her head, looking miserable. ""No one threatened me, Ms. Weston. Please don't force me to accuse Ms. Sienna. I can't betray my conscience. I can't offend the Sullivan family. Please, spare me, Ms. Weston...""  
  
The caregiver gave her a deep bow.  
  
Eleanor suddenly felt cold, from her feet to her thighs, from her fingers to her shoulder blades, as if she had been frozen completely.  
  
She stared at the caregiver until her eyes began to sting, but the caregiver only avoided her gaze, not saying another word.  
  
It was clear the caregiver wasn't going to tell the truth.  
  
No wonder Sienna and Gabriel had the nerve to bring the caregiver in for a confrontation. They had already set up a trap, waiting for her to fall into it.  
  
Eleanor looked at Gabriel, her eyes red. ""Is this the result you wanted?""  
  
The caregiver's change of story had cost her another piece of evidence to accuse Sienna.  
  
""You must have paid her a hefty sum to change her story.""  
  
Eleanor's words frightened the caregiver so much that her legs nearly gave way, almost causing her to kneel.  
  
""Ms. Weston, you need to speak with conscience. I didn't take any money. Please stop forcing me to falsely accuse Ms. Sienna.""  
  
""Eleanor, are you planning to force a confession?"" Sienna, trembling with anger, stood from the side.  
  
Just then, Liam entered and quickly began treating Sienna and Gabriel's wounds.  
  
Eleanor knew that staying here would get her nowhere.  
  
She looked at the caregiver, who wore a face free of guilt, and a vague suspicion began to form in her mind.  
  
Money could make anything happen, especially when it came to a family as powerful as the Sullivan family, ranked among the top five in the city.  
  
People naturally seek to flatter the powerful and avoid danger.  
  
She didn't blame the caregiver for choosing Sienna. She only blamed herself for being isolated, helpless, and incapable.  
  
But no one stays at the bottom forever, and the Sullivan family won't stay on top forever, either.  
  
Eleanor suddenly straightened her back and walked out with steady steps.  
  
Watching her leave, Sienna felt an unexpected sense of dread.  
  
She suddenly recalled a saying, *The most terrifying person is the one who has nothing left, because they have nothing to lose.*  
  
The sunlight outside was blinding. Even though it was early winter, the sun felt hotter than in summer.  
  
Outside the villa, a flashy Lamborghini was parked.  
  
""Eleanor!"" The person in the car suddenly waved at her. When she didn't respond, the person got out and walked toward her.  
  
The newcomer had striking features, and diamond earrings glinted from his ears, making him hard to miss.  
  
""Do you remember me?"" he asked with a playful smile, as if afraid she might forget him. ""I'm Ethan.""  
  
Eleanor pursed her lips, not speaking. She recognized him, of course. He was the man from the bar.  
  
Not wanting to get involved with him, she forced a smile and began to walk away.  
  
Ethan, seemingly aware of her thoughts, followed closely behind.  
  
""I know you don't like Sienna, and I don't either. Why don't we team up?"" he suggested.  
  
Eleanor stopped walking. ""Team up?""  
  
So, she did care about Sienna.  
  
Ethan's smile deepened, his eyes sparkling. ""I found out that Sienna is already looking for a lawyer, planning to sue you for defamation and slander. Even if you face her in court, with the Sullivan family's resources, it's more likely that you'll end up in jail.""  
  
His words made Eleanor's heart sink.  
  
The law relies on evidence. At the moment, she didn't have the solid evidence to land a blow against Sienna, but Sienna could use the Sullivan family's money and power to make things difficult for her.  
  
Lawsuits and gathering evidence require both money and connections, and those were the two things she lacked most right now.  
  
She looked at Ethan, and with his confident gaze on her, she asked in a hoarse voice, ""What kind of cooperation do you have in mind, Mr. Ethan?""",1,1751789939.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

when he announced he was marrying his first love.

She cut ties decisively and married Houston's richest man in a flash.

After getting married, her husband stayed away but she received money daily,

studied abroad on his dime, and her career soared.

When she made a stunning return to the country,

Brendan suddenly proposed, claiming he regretted everything and wanted her back.

As if! Belated affection is worth less than weeds—she flatly refused to look back.

\###Chapter 1

A thirty-year-old man's desire was raw and unfiltered.

Arlene Hurley had lost track of how long this had gone on. Her body felt shattered, submerged in the intensity of her craving, barely able to breathe.

Brendan Dudley knew her body too well. Every touch landed with unerring precision, nothing wasted, nothing accidental.

""All next week, clear my schedule. I'm taking time off. Book two tickets to the Maldives,"" Brendan said finally, standing by the bed, dressing at his usual unhurried pace.

Arlene shifted slightly, trying to ease the numb ache in her waist. A flicker of joy crossed her eyes.""Brendan, you're taking me on vacation?""

Brendan paused, glancing at her with a faint frown.""I'm going with Paige.""

The smile on Arlene's face froze, her gaze dropping awkwardly.""Understood, Mr. Dudley.""

Noticing her expression, Brendan spoke again.""Arlene, you're an orphan. You're young. I'm never going to marry you.""

Arlene looked up at him, forcing a bitter smile.""I've never expected you to. But now that Ms. Hilton's divorced and back in the country. Maybe it's time we end this hidden affair?""

Brendan's face darkened. He sighed and reached out, ruffling her hair as if she were a child. Then he placed a card on the nightstand.""Buy whatever you like.""

""I'm not going to be your mistress anymore, Mr. Dudley."" Arlene's voice trembled with quiet defiance. She knew he and Paige Hilton were bound to marry sooner or later.

""It's too soon for this conversation. When I do get married, then we'll talk. Don't get emotional. It's not your call to end things."" His tone turned dismissive. He gave her one last look and walked out.

Even after the front door shut behind him, her ears were still ringing. It was like the world had gone silent.

Arlene was an orphan. During her first year of college, her beauty drew the jealousy of Wilma Dudley, a spoiled rich girl who bullied her mercilessly, leaving her partially deaf in one ear, her pinky finger broken, and nearly blinding her with a lit cigarette.

Someone had filmed the attack. The video went viral.

The school had to call in the families. Representing Wilma that day was her older brother, Brendan Dudley.

Maybe it was for the sake of the Dudley family's reputation. Maybe it was a pity. But Brendan had extended a hand to Arlene when she was bloodied and broken. The first words he ever spoke to her were,""Don't be afraid. I won't let anyone hurt you again.""

It was weak. It was foolish.

But Arlene fell for him. At a time in her life when she craved love the most, Brendan fulfilled every dream she'd had about men, about safety, about being wanted.

She used to believe Brendan was her salvation. But now, it was clear he didn't love her, he just refused to let her go.

\*\*\*

The Dudley Group.

Brendan had a meeting to attend and needed to hand off some projects. Paige was waiting in his office.

They were flying to the Maldives together soon, seven days of sweet escape.

Arlene set a cup of coffee in front of Paige, her chest tightening like something sharp was twisting inside her.""Ms. Hilton, your coffee.""

Paige gave her a soft, elegant smile.

Paige came from a prestigious family. She and Brendan had grown up together—the perfect match. She had poise, intelligence, and that quiet kind of charm only wealth and breeding could polish. Just sitting there, she radiated confidence so blinding that it made Arlene's eyes ache.

Arlene knew she'd lost. She'd never even stood a chance.

The prince never really loved Cinderella. He just used her to pass the time.

Setting the cup down, Arlene practically fled the office in embarrassment.

She had no confidence. Being an orphan, being poor, being left scarred and half-disabled. It all left a stain of shame in every pore of her being.

""Mr. Dudley and Ms. Hilton are going on their honeymoon, right? Heard they're officially a couple now. Their families already approved the match. It's all going public when they get back.""

In the break room, coworkers gossiped freely about Brendan and Paige's impending wedding.

Arlene, filling her water bottle, scalded the back of her hand with boiling water.

The glass slipped from her fingers and shattered on the floor. She didn't even register the pain at first, just scrambled to run her burned hand under cold water.

Brendan and Paige were getting married.

That meant her time with Brendan was truly over. Her internship at the Dudley Group was probably ending too.

""Arlene, Mr. Dudley asked you to drive him and Ms. Hilton to the airport at eleven.""

A colleague called her from across the office.

Arlene forced a bitter smile. Brendan really was cruel.

There were drivers available, but he insisted she take them just to remind her of her place, to crush any remaining illusions she might have.

In the end, Brendan and Wilma were alike. They both bullied her just in different ways.

One had scarred her body. The other shattered what was left of her heart.

Pulling out her phone, Arlene hesitated for a long moment before dialing a number she had once blocked.

""Hello, Albert? You once said if I agreed to marry you, you'd fund my studies in Italy. Does that offer still stand?"" Her voice trembled slightly.

Marriage. Maybe it was her only way out of Seattle and out of Brendan's life.

""Think it through,"" came the deep voice on the other end.""Come to Riverside Manors,7 PM on the 13th of this month. We'll talk details.""

1lsw2ym,https://i.redd.it/8qsatzcxp7bf1.jpeg,Filter coffee / powder recommendation similar to A2B,"I usually love the filter coffee from A2B (Adyar Ananda Bhavan) - strong, smooth, and perfectly balanced with a hint of sweetness. I tried their packaged powder and really liked it.
Tried Costa's Specially Blend (yellow pack) and AVT but didn't enjoy the taste — they were slightly bitter and lacked the depth and flavor I'm used to.
Any recommendations for filter coffee powders with a similar taste to A2B's? Preferably available in India.
TIA
